the epistle to the reader

courteous reader

having presented these few following observations to your view desiring your serious meditation your moderate sensure on what have here inserted and if have offered nothing more to thy view then what was manifestly known to thee before yet do not disdain it nor the day of small things but rather rejoyce to see the same light break forth in me as thou hast prised in thy self and know that he that goeth up to heaven by jacobs ladder must not disdain the first

step but suppose that this my small treatise should meet with no acceptance within thy more solid fiction but that it may seem altogether oposite to those thy friendly guests that have had admittance granted to asociate themselves within thy more noble confines yet seeing have tendered my mind to thee so freely expecting rather to involve thee in the circumference of my love than any waies to render thee the object of my envy let it suffice thee rather to passe by those things that may seem opposite to thy understanding with a dubious sensure and not conclude rashly that all things that may scem difficult to thy apprehension must enforcedly be false but rather imagine there may be wrong construction enforced upon my endeared intention as well as an ignorance in my writing for many things may possibly seem current to thee in thy own agitations when it may be if they should but be brought to the of christ and his apostles would prove no better then held by custome and use from others rather then from the reall grounds of the scripture even so it is very probable that several constructions will be concluded upon this my small treatise for he that doth appear in

print to the open view of all men must not think it harsh to receive the retorting frowns of a disliking spirit in some things wherein it may be he may be void of offence or at least of offending them
and as for my part had not learned to have born such a burthen it had been in vain for me to have taken a pen in my hand seeing intend not my present to any particular person yet to every one and amongst so many several imagined waies of worship am necessitated to be lookt at awry by some and in case my dislikers should take a pen in hand with any other intent it is very probable they might be frustrated in their aime and if had looked for an applause from men might have injoyed more in silence then in manifesting my mind and laying my self openly to the view of my enemies if any such there be but let all men conclude if they expect any answer from me in that nature they will be far mistaken in their intentions for have not so learned christ as to make him my stalking horse to carry my envy but rather desire his assistance as an ayd to admonish all men for love hath so much of the nature of truth that it will abolish all envy and pride and and fear so that would have all men

to understand that account it below me to take notice of any any ones praise or dispraise in this thing yet not below me to manifest what have received and to contend for the truth and not to bind my talent up in a napkin least should neglect the doing of the will of my master and so be called to an account for it therefore do not prise the sensures of any having such a freedom in my intention as to my writing this my weak and more reall information

and as for what any one is pleased to state me either their friend or enemy have this hope that as shall not be much moved by any various manifestations in men so likewise shall endeavour to keep my self from deserving any envy from any one knowing that truth may have many batteries yet the fort will be resigned fully to it at the last happy is he that is a souldier in this undeprivable conquest great will be his reward above all the endowments of this life he need not presse after the enslaving rudiments of this life to serve where he ought to be served so as to captivate that noble grain of wheat by any unseemly tares of mans inventions but his delight is in a more higher and bright lustre far transcending any injoyment in this

life or of this fabricating what though his time here in this his earthly tabernacle seem as it were a pilgrimage of distresse to what others do enjoy yet when he looketh homeward he hath more cause to rejoyce then to mourn for what pleasure can any man assure himself of in any thing that is decayable if he do but cast his eye toward the rock from whence he was hewn
suppose thou shouldst be made heir of all the promising delights that the whole earth could afford yet if thou dost not improve them to the advantage of thy lord and master it had been good for thee if thou hadst never known any thing of that nature but suppose thou shouldest make a right use of them yet canst thou not assure thy self of any continuance with them for thou art not at thy own disposing but must give up thy power to him of whom thou rentest or borrowest thy time since thy appearance in thy first state
loose not the substance for a few fading vanities which are but as dry husks that can never satisfie any though they have never so many of them it is the nature of them to breed desire and not to quench desire nor to enrich your treasury of content that is but a pearl but that must be received from the bridegroom when he

cometh to welcome his guests and to adorne each of his friends with a crown of glory and immortality and eternal life which every one shall receive that hath the wedding garment on when he shall appear in his glory to shew us the heavenly mansions that he hath prepared for us therefore let us use all endeavours possibly we can to nourish that more noble seed and let us beware we do not stifle it in its womb but rather seek to cherrish it by feeding upon moderation that so its birth may be hastned and its glory manifested and then thy pleasant pastures will be beautified with that incomparable lilly even righteousnesse that so it may produce the effectual crop of peace and holiness without which no man can see god let us not become only hearers of the word but doers of it also knowing that the time past may suffice us to walk as we have walked in the vanity of our minds therefore now let us seek to lay aside all such superfluities of naughtiness that we may learn to receive the grafted word in meekness that is able to save our souls and not to spend our time in eying the seeming delights of this world but rather manifest your selves to be such as seek a kingdom whose foundation is laid in truth

and righteousness and to lay up our treasure where neither moth nor canker can polute nor thieves break thorough to steale away that so we may ayme at that mark in which we may have just cause of joy in the end for where our treasure is there will our hearts be also so shall we approve our selves to be the friends of god by doing the will of god and then our beauty will become perfect thorough his comeliness and we shall receive an unction from the holy one whereby we may come to know all things yea even the deep things of god and to persist from one degree of righteousness to another and to treasure up for our selves that hope that will purge out all uncleanness and cause us to walk more wisely and to mourne over him whom we have pierced that neither grave nor death may have any more then what was assigned them from the beginning that so we may joyfully and conqueringly sing death where is thy sting grave where is thy victory this is the conquest that we have gained if we love god we shall not want that spiritual food because he loveth us and hereby shall we know if we love him or not for he that loveth god keepeth his commandments and his commandements

are not grievous unto him
thus desiring each one that shall peruse this my vulgar yet more loving present to wholly uncloath themselves of all envy least whereas they think to dart my weak endeavours with any envions dart they their hand in venting it and so make themselves altogather unfit for their more expedient war by seming to inflict any former grudge upon this my present treatise but would advise any one that hath any thing against me to let me suffer for that in that nature that they do suppose me to be guilty in rather then to defame any one thing here that their conscience may tell them is truth and let them render me what they please hope shall have love enough to banish all thoughts of envy that may seek to encroach into my delightful treasury from whence this small treatise did proceed
know many may be retorting upon me for the vulgarness of my speech but let them conclude had had as much leasure to indite as they may have to peruse each word might have mended some of those expressions that they may judge correctible but let not any envy my mean instructions knowing that they might proceed from as effectual a fountain of fervency as if they had had the

glosse of more curious wits assuring themselves it is an easier thing to correct an error in anothers book or to think they can then to write a book void of others sensuring the same by them if not proving it thus let it suffice each of my superiours that have not any ways hindered the building of the temple intentionally but rather endeavouted to lend them my helping hand to hew one small stone fit for the builders use and if finde that my endeavours may any wayes further or hasten the work shall have great cause to rejoyce and it will be a great encouragement for me to persevere in my intended work and to continue seeking to pleasure you with one more effectually wrought therefore let me entreat you not to dispise the workmanship of this knowing my self altogether unworthy to be employed so far as to take theis work in hand yet if my willingness stir up the spirits of any in the persuance of this work let them attribute the honour of it to the chief owner of the work by whom was both employed and instructed and if any thing may prove advantagious to you in this my invitation of love repay it to my instructer and do not set up an image in your hearts to bestow any thing of obedience to it but sacrifice your whole heart to him

from whom you receive your life and beeing that so we may presse forward toward the marke of the price of the free calling of god by yielding him all the preheminence of what he hath wrought for us and let us manifest our selves to be his servants by planting the fruitful vine of love that so our lords vineyard may yield him its propper fruits in due season and as he hath demonstrated himself to be a god and a father to us so we may resign up the strength of our minds to serve him in his commands and then we shall receive the reward of good servants which will be unto us of more value then all the delightsome husks of this life which at the best are but transitory and changeable as in respect of our more durable riches
what though all the unfrequent gusts of persecution may meet us in our progress into the several revolutions in this world whence possibly we may receive the losse of all other seeming pleasures by those that are contradictors of the truth yet here will be our comfort that we have a treasure that no man can take from us if we keep close to the truth no one can take away that treasure that is laid up for all those that shall be found conquerours by the overcomming of the lusts and pride of this world in

their exactness in the wayes of truth their pleasure will be in desiring to be at their home and center knowing that there they shall take their repose whereas before they are dissolved from their earthly tabernacle or house of this life persecutions and afflictions are or ought to be as welcome guests as joy is expedient in that that is to come and herein is that ancient saying verefied that the way to heaven is thorow a hellish state of persecution therefore in thy highest aspirings let this be thy aim that gods pleasure may be thine and take up thy crosse and follow him not valuing all the lets and impediments that may seek to hinder thee from returning to thy constant and abidable rest by desiring thy beloved to make hast to involve thee in his arms where thou mayst sing unanimously all praise be to thee god and in the mean time desire thy beloved to set thee as a seale upon his heart as a seal upon his arm for love is strong as death and jealousie is cruel as the grave the coals thereof are coals of fire which hath a most vehemene flame
many waters cannot quench love neither can the floods drown it if a man would give all the substance of his house for love it would utterly be contemned the
of canticles or solomons song the and
verses

this is the jewel that when a man hath found he selleth all that he hath to purchase it even the hidden manna that a man may eate and satisfy himself with all which is food only for those that have the white stone given them and a new name written in it that no man can read save he that receiveth it this is the new commandment and the old even that which was from the beginning love worketh no evil neither rendreth evil for evil but contrarywise good and forgiveness to his brother yea if he offend seventy and seven times a day this is perfect love that abhorreth slavery by casting out fear he that getteth this pearle insureth to himself a safe hiding place where his enemy cannot dert him by his reioycing over him for though he seeme to fall yet he shall arise and the lord will be a light unto him and psalm

jerusalems glory or the saints safety in eying the churches security
epigraph psalm
for there they that carried us away captive required of us a song and they that wasted us required of us mirth saying
sing us one of the songs of sion
how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land if forget thee jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning
if do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy

this psalm in general was a repeatal of the children of israel in remembrance of their captivity as you my read in the first and second verses and hath relation to their weeping and being oppressed for the decays and wastings of sion and also their sensiblenesse of their enemys

derision both in deriding them for their present sufferings and for their former mentioning of zion and that their deliverance should be by the hand of him who had been manifestly known to them in times past by the name of the god of zion
this text was israels repeatal and it is or may be any one mans or any peoples that can by experience condole these sad essects
shall not stand to repeat a further rehearsal or catalogue of the general discourse of the repeaters of this psalm but shall in perticular insist upon the words before mentioned in my text in which shall only observe these five perticular heads

the people demanding

the people demanded of

the thing demanded

their answer to the thing demanded

and astly the answer of god to them in the thing answered

the people demanding were the babilonians or men of babel for so it is plainly understood in the first clause of my text for there they that carried us away captive if any one be so scrupulous as to know where it is detracted from let him but cast his eye to the first words of this psalm and he may answer himself it was by the rivers of babylon or the rivers in babylon for there was it that these prisoners of hope were carried

the people demanded of was the jewes as is instanced in the verse if forget thee jerusalem

the thing demanded is mirth or one of the songs of zion as is plainly instanced in the last clause of the ver saying sing us one of the songs of zion

the peoples answer to the thing demanded that is plainly understood by these words how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land or rather as some do read it how can we sing the lords song in a strange land judging it an impossibility so to do

the answer of god to the jewes in the thing answered the thing answered you have plainly in the verse how shall we sing the lords song in a strange land but do but mark the answer of god to these cast down and dejected jewes in the and verses if forget thee jerusalem let my right hand forget her cunning
if do not remember thee let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth if prefer not jerusalem above my chief joy

the doctrine in general will be this that gods dearest and choisest people may be left in such a streight that they may not know how to sing the lords song
say that those people whom god intends chiefly to make use of to manifest himself to in love and kindness and to set his

name as a pillar in the midst of may be driven to such a streight that it may seem impossible in their apprehension to sing the lords song
but before proceed any further let us consider these particulars

what this song of zion signifies or rather what is here meant by the lords song
what it is that disinables or captivates a people from singing this song of zion
in what land or state this song of zion may be said to be really experimentally and truly sung in

by what means a people may be said to be made capable or learned in this school to sing the lords song


what this song of zion is or what the jewes enemies might here mean by the demands of israel zion is the city that god doth accept of for the improvement of all those that are of the stock of ahraham and the linage of david in that state wherein it is witnessed that abraham was gods friend and david a man after cods own heart and therefore god giveth this restimony of it as he witnesseth that he would and did delight himself in them to wit abraham and david even so he witnesseth that his dwelling is in zion that he hath desired it for his habitation psalm
and as he hath it psalm
zion is the city of the living god

and psalm
and
they go from strength to strength every one of them in zion appeareth before god
and so the song of zion ariseth from the occasion of gods dealing with his people in that dispensation that he shewes and manifests himself to his people in

but it is generally observed that wheresoever there is any mention made of israel singing of zions songs there is mention made that the occasion of their song hath relation to some conquest or other that they had gained either over moral enemies as men or spiritual lustful wickedness in their hearts wherein they had experienced gods love in some way or other more then usual but suppose the song that these baby lonians did require of them was only that song sung unto god at the time of their deliverance from the egyptians and other such like enemies therefore shall not speak of the former in this place but shall refer it till come to open my text further and shall chiefly insist upon this part because it is most suitable to this our purpose in this particular for that song that was demanded of israel was such a hymne wherein was mirth to be used as their enemys did understand mirth not that they thought that the israelites should ever again be delivered forth of that servitude that they by conquest had subjected them under as is plainly instanced in nehemiah
and the beginning of the chapter by

sanbalat and tobiah the amonite who stood and mocked them saying what will these feeble jewes do will they fortifie themselves will they sacrifice will they make an end in a day will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish that were burnt even that which they build if a fox go up he shall break down their stone wall which words was spoken by the same enemies that israel is here in this psalm making mention of as you may read in the book of chronicles the chapter the and verses and that these were the people that were carried away captive in the time of jeremiah and is made mention of in the
of ezra and the
that the word of the lord by the prophet jeremiah might be fulfilled
say these are the people of whom is required a song

now let us search what song it is that israel had used to sing to the god of zion if we do but turn to the of exodus we shall find what it is that israel makes their mirth and what is the occasion of their mirth or singing
the cause of their song was chiesly occasioned by their being delivered from the hand of pharaoh and the fury of the egyptians the song chiefly consists of prayses to their god whom they owned to be their strength and their salvation and their deliverer as is manifested quite through the whole song therefore say the song of zion that is

here made mention of is praises to their god for their deliverance from their open and manifest enemies and in deuteronomy the
there we have moses singing another song of the same nature as this praising god for all his mercies in keeping and delivering his people saying it was the lord alone that had delivered them and that they had not in the least deserved it at his hands
again we have debora and barak singing a song of the same in judges the
in remembrance of what the lord had done for israel in making use of so mean an instrument as a woman to take a king prisoner it was god say they that went forth to fight the battel yea the stars fought in course against sisera yea they fought from heaven
thus say the song of israel or the hebrew song as some translate it or the song of zion as is here spoken of and demanded of these jewes is praises to our god for their deliverance and ascribing of him the honour and now they being taken carried captive by their enemies was deprived of singing this song by being deprived of the victory and so the egyptianish or babylonian deriders might justly laugh at them and deride them by reason of their restraint saying sing us one of the songs of zion or praises to your god for your deliverance from us when god had given them into their hands as prisoners
will not say but there

may be more gathered forth of these words in a higher nature but suppose may safely avouch this to be the song that was demanded and so shall passe it over at this time having not time to enlarge my self so far as could wish had or then should open every particular clause so plainly as god hath given me ability but shall scarcely give a touch to each thing that have intended
secondly or the second things is this what it is that disinables or captivates a people so that they cannot sing this song shall be very brief in this place shall only give you these particulars and so shall passe to the third particular of my text

the first and greatest debarment that a people can meet withal that may hinder a people from singing this song is chiefly their sins this am sure will hold with the opening the text to the full scope of these words
say that sin is the first stumbling block that occasioneth a peoples unsufficiency to sing this song of being delivered from the hand of their enemies as you have it in the of the lamentations of the prophet jeremiah and the verse jerusalem hath grieviously sinned therefore she is removed all that honored her despise her yea this prophet was the messenger sent oftentimes to bid and warne these people to teturn from their evil wayes

as you may read at large in his prophesie as in the chapter and the verse and so to the end of the chapter is very plainly declared that his love and zeal for jerusalem is not a little manifested for though the king did burn the role that he had presented in defiance of his words yet is he as willing to write another at the command of the lord as ever he was to write the first that if it had been possible to have wrought any good upon them he would not lack means to intreat them to repent but all was in vain the people were altogether bent after their own willfulnesse even from the king that sat upon the throne to the priest that sat in the temple as the prophet lamenteth sorely in the
of lamentations
verse thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee they have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment
it seemed a pleasing and melodious vision that these prophets did see for israel as indeed it is too to frequent with most if not all people if they once bend their minds to any one vanity to hear such prophesies as will secure them as they think from being in any guilt if they should practise and follow that vanity therefore it was the opinion of an ancient
heathen that if any man did speak well of any of his practises that he would ask him what it was that he ask'd him for for he supposed that if any man did speak highly

of him it was to deceive him that he might gain honour or a reward by it and therefore he had a fervent affection for those that did most seem to envy him saying he had none that instructed him more then his enemies for be sure that if they knew that he did offend they would not hide it but would reproach him for it whereby he came to know in part how far he did offend in the thing wish many christians have not a worse rule then this

secondly gods sury is the second cause by which a people are made destitute of singing this song for as sin is the first motive cause so gods fury is the effected cause of their unsufficiency for when god is moved by sin to afflict a people and that he hath waited a long time it may be day after day and week after week and year after year and yet can see no hope of their return then his fury is moved and it may be he will slay some of them with the sword and give others to the famine that so he may revenge himself of them for their high provocations wherewith they have provoaked him to do it so that they shall know if his sword once be gone forth in fury it will tot return void of effecting the cause of its being moved so that whilst god is a taking vengeance upon a people they cannot in any wise be said to be sensible of singing this song for the song is praises to god for deliverance

and no people can sing this song unlesse the lord be reconciled to them as a friend in love and peace
thirdly or the third thing that hinders a people from singing this song is the want of the lords presence in times of tryal for though his love may be as great to them in the time of tryal as in peace yet if it be not manifestly known to them to be so they are very much disinabled to sing this song as it is recorded of job in the chapter of job and the verse and so along the lord hath overthrown me says job and hath caught me in his net cry out of wrong but am not heard there is no judgement
he hath set darkness in my paths am destroyed on every side am gone and my hope hath he removed like a tree
and as solomon instances elsewhere oppression maketh a wise man mad so that say whosoever doth not see the face of the lord to shine victoriously in his sight cannot experimentally and knowingly sing this song but is as it were a stranger to the real and punctual harmony that the singers sing in by whom this song is and must be sung by but shall speak more fully to this in my following discourse

the third particular is in what land or state this song may be experimentally and really sung in for this first we must understand it is only to be sung in the land of deliverance and herein

doth it answer with a perfect coherence to the text as it is opened for it is not the place that hinders them from singing this song but it is the want of gods power to assist them in any place that makes the land seem strange for a people to sing this song
israel could not account the wilderness a strange land by reason they could sing it there though it was as strange a land as babylon as in respect of their acquaintance with the place but as in respect of their participating of the love favour of god in the place the land of babel was stranger to them then the wilderness for in the wildernesse they were delivered from their enemies and in babel they were restrained from their liberty by their enemies so that they cannot say but they were restrained from singing this song so long as they were confind to be prisoners and therefore did they complain of the decays of zion because zion was the city of their deliverance and that being wasted they were by that means made heirs of a strange land by being strangers to the song of zion for this song cannot be sung out of zion or the lords fortified city and therefore saith the prophet zachariah in the of his prophesie and the verse and the lord sholl inherit judah his portion in the holy land and shall chuse jerusalem again the lord is pleased to call judah his portion and he will inherit him in the holy land
now there is

no place that can be said to be unholy as to what it was made at first but by a peoples pollutions in the land as you have it in the
psalme and the verse the lord hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary to heare the groaning of the prisoners and to loose them that are appointed to death well for what purpose did he loose these prisoners it follows in the next words to declare the name of the lord in zion and his praises in jerusalem and as you have it in the psalm and the verse the lord is great in zion and he is hie above all people that is as much as if the prophet should have said the inhabitants of zion have set the praise of the lord high above all people or the praise of all people yea even the lord to reign in their hearts and so you have it in the last verse of that of zechariah be still or silent all flesh before the lord for he is raised forth of his holy habitation for when the lord is raised forth of his holy habitation it is to conquer and subdue and silence all flesh that he himself may be lifted up in zion in judah or in jerusalem or in the inhabitants of those places that are jews indeed and in action and not by being jews or sons of zion by name or profession only for those are the true jews and sons of abraham that build up the decayes of judah and do the works of abraham for as

paul said we desire to know no man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet henceforth know we him so no more and as you have it more plainly romans the third the
verses he is not a jew that is one outwardly neither is that circumcision that is outward in the flesh but he is a jew that is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit not in the letter whose praise is not of men but of god so as said before the people that willingly and joyfully do seek to repaire the breaches of judah are such as must inherit the promises of god made to abraham isaac and jacob and shall surely be inhabitants in this land where this song of zion may be really and experimentally and truly sung in but shall leave this perticular at this time and shall desire every one that is desirous to be an inhabitant of this land to take notice of what his duty must be in zion or in judah to which shall speak more fully when come to shew you the lawes and the ordinances that are in this land
and so shall proceed to the fourth perticular by what meanes a people may be said to be made capable or learned in this school to sing this song
shall endeavour through gods assistance to make manifest unto your view these two following observations
first it chiefly concernes us to search who is the in zion or who it is that instructeth jacob or israel
secondly what these lawes or statutes are that are taught or ought to be taught in israel and how to be observed

first let us consider that god is made mention of in several places to be the instucter of israel as psalm
he established a testimony in jacob and a law in israel and in isaiah the
and
verse thus saith the lord thy redeemer the holy one of israel am the lord thy god which teacheth thee to profit which leadeth the by the way that thou shouldest go
and in the of isaiah and the
verse hearken unto me my people and give ear unto me my nation for a law shall proceed from me and will make judgement to rest for a light to the people
if any one be not satisfied that it is spoken to israel the foregoing words will certifie him better and as you have it in the of isaiah and the verse zion and jerusalem that bringeth good tydings lift up thy voice and be not afraid and say unto the citys of judah behold your god
might instance hundreds of places more to prove this truth to you but suppose it to be needless for wherever there is any mention made of the author of israels lawes and statutes god is made mention of in some

one degree or other to be the giver of them if it be mentioned of israel as israel or as have defined israel in my forementioning of them which is not israel in name or shew but in truth verity it may be some one or other will be inquisitive to demand of me what god is as have oftentimes had objected against me but shall speak very little to that in this place but in case any one be desirous to know farther if find him willing and desirous to be satisfied in this or any other particular that shall make mention of shall endeavour to satisfie him if it be possible at any time or in any place convenient
first god is said to be the alpha and omega the first and the last
secondly god is said to feed his flock and that he is their shepheard and in other places to be god of fury to the wicked it is one thing to look upon him as he is in himself and another to look upon him as he is in us or in his manifestations but shall deferr this discourse in this place supposing the unfoldng of it would be rather a stumbling block then any thing of edification to many therefore shall advise every one whatever to assure himself that there is no iniquity in him and that he is a hater of lyes and a destroyer of all the devices of the wicked
thus shall proceed to the second particular what these lawes or statutes are that are given to israel in zion or the holy

land as some read it or judah or in jerusalem and how to be observed

first let us consider that as the is holy so are his statutes and lawes holy also as you have it in the psal the verse righteous art thou lord and upright are thy judgments thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithfull and as you have it in the verse of this psalme will prayse thee with uprightness of heart when shall have learned thy righteous judgments so that you see plainly that the statutes and lawes and commandements of the to these inhabitants is righteousness and truth and equity and love and faithfulness and as you have a righteous and righteous lawes so you must observe to serve him in righteousness if you intend to be a subject in this land as you have it in the psalme and the
verses open to me the gates of righteousness will go into them praise the lord this gate of the lord into which the righteous shall enter thou must not stand to frame a service to seek the bounty and gifts of men in it but the commands of god happy is that people that is brought to that uniformity that it may be truly said of them that the statutes of the lord are duely observed in their land but before proceed any further let us consider what danger

may ensue upon those that are inhabitants in this land if in case they should obey and keep the statutes and lawes in this land

first say that no man as man but is very apt to deserve the being cast forth from inhabiting in this land but the is a god of mercy as well as justice but in case thou art as strict an observer as may be yet thou canst assure thy self of no constant content in all things for whilst thou art in this thy decayable and frail building or house of this world there will be strivings and turmoilings in the several revolutions and changes and whilst we are striving to conquer them by our more high aspiring the world the flesh and the devil will be striving to shew us their present seeming delights thinking to intermingle out more serious and reasonable undertakings with those things that have nothing but a shew onely of godliness in them and nothing of the power this is the great warfare in which you must engage as a combitant if you come into this land for the flesh will be striving against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh and those two are contrary so that if you will seek after any dutable riches any treasure that the moth and rust will not destroy but it will abide all trials that are of this life and will be the purer each time that it is cast into the fire say if you seek to deal in

such commodities you must expect the frowns of these your enemies nay your king will be trying you how your zeal is agreeable to your profession
but least you should think to escape this scourge or correcting hand of god will endeavour to shew you that it is good to bear it and continue stedfast to the end though there be a twofold affliction incident to the peculiar and chiefly beloved of god yet they shall receive a diadem at the last that will cause them to acknowledge it was good for them they were afflicted
first there is an affliction that god suffers his children to be exercised withal as in respect of their having to do or dealing with things of this life

secondly there is an affliction as in respect of our dejections in things appertaining to our chiefest content as when we are hindred of our commerse with our god and ly sighing complaining as job and several others of his servants have done job sayes look for him on the one side but he is not there and behind me but cannot find him no he hideth himself
he would not appear to answer job in what job did desire neither would he plead with him till his time was come job cryed out of oppression as you have it job
and
this is the burthensomest

affliction that may befal the children of god yea yea it seemeth so burthensome sometimes that they may be brought to question their condition to be worse than meer worldlings that have no joy in any thing else but what they grapple after in this life as david plainly instances said it fareth better with the wicked than with the righteous but when went into thy sanctuary found it was better to abide one day within thy courts than in the presence of wicked men for ever psal
how doth god see them say the wicked though we scourge them nay david sayes therefore are his people brought thither and water of a full cup are wrung out to them

but let not any man mistake me herein and think that speak of gods withdrawing his affection from his people but my meaning is only thus that god withdraws himself in love to us even as the apostle hath it heb
every son whom love do rebuke and chasten to keep our thoughts from vain constructions that all men are very prone unto to have high thoughts of their own strength and their own ability and their own righteousness and peradventure never dive into our own hearts to acknowledge to whom we are obliged for it but forget the fountain from whence it flowes and springs to us as the apostle paul sayes of the romans they had a zeal to god but not according to knowledge

rom
and the beginning of the chapter they being ignoraut of gods righteousness went about to establish a righteousness of their own and did not submit to that righteousness that was of god even so we are apt to conclude with our selves we have this good qualification or this good blessing or am so just or more righteous in such a degree than such and such are when we do not consider if we are so that it is gods mercy to us more than our deserving but rejoice in our selves far above our sphere and look not back to him that gave it us for this take one scripture more of the same apostle cor
verse if ye have received it why glory ye as though ye had not received it let him that glorieth glory in the lord

be sure of this that whosoever doth receive any gift of grace or any benefit to his spiritual refreshment or any enjoyment to his souls happiness or in general any blessing from the lord and doth not attribute all the praise all the glory all the preheminence and honour to god that gave it him it had been better that that man or woman had never receiv'd it for he doth nor here in forget god that gave it him but robbeth him of that praise and honour that is due to him also or employeth that to his own praise or the praise of some other thing that is due to god alone so that that which might through due

obedience and thanks to god have been a blessing nay herein become a curse to him that employes it thus for to whom much is given much will be required and if that servant shall be accounted an evil servant that laid up his talent in a napkin and restored it safe to the owner again without any loss mat
what will he be accounted that robbeth his master and devideth the talent and takes part of it himself for his own use and yet hath the face to say have improved my talent better than such and such men and doth not account but it is well enough with him that he hath not been behind with the lord in giving him what is his due and if any man make any thing fit for his use hee will look to have the preheminence of it to himself yet he will not render the same to god

learn of the beasts of the field and do not envy their service unless ye will act above pretence the oxe knoweth his owner and the ass his masters crib but israel hath not known me my people have not known their god isa
and as you have it in the eighth of the prophesie of the prophet jeremiah and the
verse yea the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed time and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming but my people know not the judgments of the lord and remember the prophet ezekiel being

shewed the transgressions of the people in his time that the lord shewed him some that did not let to work abominations in the temple of the lord as you have it ez
and he brought me into the inner court of the lords house and behold at the door of the temple between the portch and the altar were about twenty men with their backs towards the temple of the lord and their faces towards the east and they worshipped the sun toward the east by the east as some translate it in this place is meant these peoples looking for the chiefest light to consist in the worshipping of the sun this is a sad omen of the stirring or awaking of gods fury when a people shall bend their mindes to idolize any imaginary conceit of their own devising and bestow that honour to it that is due to god he will have thy whole heart if he hath any thing of thee and that in the right worship too and not in any way that we think is most rare because it is most harmonious in our sight but in the exact way of the foregoing admonishers even christ and his apostles and the martyrs that were made to seal it with their blood not by praying to saints and martyrs but to observe and do the things that they did mean the works that they did and to praise god in the same way as they did and in the same thing and let us seek to press forward toward the price of the high calling

of god and ascribe honour to whom honour is due

desire you my beloved friends yea every one to whom this smal treatise shall come to seriously consider with your own hearts how far you are behind with the lord in this particular by reason of our unthankfulness that we have secured our selves with under the banner of forms and customary services and have not looked into the inside of things to eat the kernel of the nut as well as gather the husk and the shell as the nut can in no wise grow without the shell and husk so no man can experience the taste of the kernel by eating and feeding of nothing but the leaves and the husk of the nut god looketh as well to thy heart as to thy tongue therefore if thou prayest to god look that thy heart be joined to thy tongue and that thy tongue speak no more but the real symptomes of thy heart and that thy heart be chiefly bent upon the doing of the will of god and not upon the beggerly rudiments of the world for if thorow practice or custom of others you frame any prayer only so learned as by book and not by heart you might justly think your selves far short of the receiving any benefit by them from god do not say but learning is very good take it in its place for we can be no servants of god but by utterance manifestation but this is my

end that no man set a higher price of words than they should do but consider the word is chiesly to thy self in thy heart and therefore consider that thy heart be joined with thy tongue especially in prayer and praises to god for if thy prayer or praises to god be builded upon no more durable a rock than formal or customary uses it will be in danger of being blown up by the incroaching gusts of covetousness and hopes of worldly honour and preferments of mens applause and these will get uppermost in thy agitations and so thou wilt cause the more noble and excellent wheat corn to be choaked by the tares and thistles in thy more worthy land or vineyard for if thou hast no deeper root in religion than this thou wilt soon be brought and easily be won to leave this upon any small occasion for if one must be left then farewell prosession for must leave thee to embrace honour riches pleasures the good words of men thou shalt have the name so long as my better friends can have their free entertainment but if one must be left then farewell prayer and farewell praises for can pray as well in another dispensation but shall get nothing but the ill will of men and the loss of honour and estate if continue in this way it was good and honourable but now it is base have have had the company of my friends wealth and honour and applause

but must now follow them further or else they will leave me it is a sad thing when religion sayes god is one thing to day and a contrary the next day onely for money and this is one way of worshipping god so called but fear it is no better than a worshiping of thy self and that in the worst sence too for thou dost but herein toyl to gather coals faggots to consume thy self in the last day without the great mercy of god for this manner of serving god or rather thy self it may be performed in any dispensation or any sort of profession but if thou takest up thy rest in any such like abess or centerest thy self in any fabrick of this nature know assuredly god will blast it in the end if it be builded upon no surer a foundation than selfends and notional expressions it may be god may let thee alone for the time that thou hast to spend in this world but the end will prove the bitterer the wickedst of men may seem to have a rest yea a pleasant one to their minds and desires it may be but it is not lasting it is not abidable as the prophet hath it esay
the last verse there is no peace to the wicked sayeth my god that is no abiding nor continuing peace therefore value thy future peace beyond any present seeming content in this life for thou must give an exact account of all thy actions in the end do but mind what solomon sayes of it

eccles

rejoice young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in the dayes of thy youth and walk in the wayes of thine own heart and in the sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgement therefore remove sorrow from thy heart and put away evil from thee therefore say look well yea narrowly to thy wayes lest whereas you think to build a tabernacle fit to entertain the holy ghost in your professions you deceive your selves and build an altar to sacrifice to the prince of datkness in deceit to thy souls ruine and eternal torment but toshew you more plainly the description of the afflictions that gods dearest and choisest children are incident and lyable to in this life shall onely give you as brief a definition as can onely to give you an introduction into the rest it being my intention to speak more fully to the duty of a christian in this life as well as in other things how to bear the afflicting trying scourge of gods lovely chastisements but before proceed any further give me leave to lay this down as a maxim undeniable that god never tryeth a nation or a people generally with such tryals as to deliver them into the hands of their enemies unless it be for their sins but these tryals that intend to enter further into are such which the children of god are lyable to in particular

when their father doth withdraw his presence from them as in respect of shewing them what he hath done for them although his love may be as great to them at that time as ever these are many times in many things not only struke at but overturned in their expectation not that ever read that god did ever hide himself to any of them so far but that ere long time was over they found it was not in vain to serve him but that he did appear one way or other to them to manifest himself a loving and a tender god as solomon hath it in the canticles
and the verse speaking of gods withdrawing himself from the church for their high thoughts of their own righteousness as you may read in the third verse have put off my coat and how shall put it on have washed my feet how shall defile them she thought her self secure enough and clean enough yea too clean to entertain her beloved though he told her that his head was filled with dew but his locks was filled with the drops of the night so that his calls was too dark for her to understand although his voice seemed to be like the voice of her beloved yet she could not think by the drops of the night that hung upon his locks but she was too clean to entertain him then but when christ had put in his hand by the hole of the door then her bowels were

moved for him and presently her hands drops with mirh as soon as christ put his hands into the holes of the door she desired to have more society with him but when she opened that door she could not find him for he had withdrawn himself and was gone from her view and would not appear to her in that dore or manifestation although she acknowledgeth that her soul failed her when he spoke which is as much as if she should think that that dispensation was not so efficacious to her in which she thought her self so clean in as that in which christ did desire admittance in and therefore her soul failed her or her confidence and she sought him but could not find him she called for him but he gave her no answer so that she seemed to be at a loss now whereas before she thought her self to be clean

the watchmen found her as they walked about the streets and they smore her and wounded her and the keepers of the wall took away her vail from her this is the greatest tryal that can any wayes befal the church of god to want the presence of god to answer them in their afflictions and indeed it is no more but the absence of god or his not appearing to answer them in what they think to find him in that causeth this affliction to be so great as this church did not perceive that she had any

need of such guest as christ seeing he did not appear in that cleanness that she thought her self blessed in but when she had smelt of the pleasant odour that proceeded from him then she falls to enquiry after him and chargeth the daughters of jerusalem to tell her beloved if they found him that she was sick of love when she had experienced the smell that he left behind him then she could not be satisfied without him and she doth not go to expect him in babylon or to bear tidings of him in egypt or edom but of the daughters of jerusalem and there it was that she found him examining her what her beloved was more than another beloved as you have her demonstrating or anatomizing of him from the verse of that chapter of solomons song to the end and when she hath set him in as magnificent an applause as she could well manifest then she comes to sum all up in one word he is altogether lovely but before christ appeared to manifest himself to this church to open their eyes they were laid down to sleep securely supposing themselves righteous enough and clean enough and pure enough in that which she had received look well to your selves all you that profess your selves to be actors upon the stage of religion that you do not entertain this guest of and so shut christ out of doors for

this church had not long before as high a sight and as sensible an understanding as any that ever read of in the old testament as is instanced in the second chapter of solomons song and the seventh verse charge you ye daughters of jerusalem by the roes and hinds of the field that ye stir not up nor awake my love till he please and yet now he is awaked she will not open the door to him nor give him any entertainment and all is occasioned by his locks being filled with the drops of the night but when he had shaken them off then she comes to find the same truth again to feed of as is instanced in the eighth chapter of that song of solomon and the fourth verse if you do but mark the third verse you shall plainly find how she is enabled to let him take his repose his left hand should be under her head and his right hand shall embrace her these words are mysteriously spoken for the left hand of god is seldom made use of to administer his embraces to the people or church of god unless it be such embraces as he bestoweth upon them when his locks are filled with the drops of the night for god doth most gloriously unvail our minds with the strength of his right hand when he hath laid his left hand under our head and then he shall not be awaked till he please oh it is one of the fullest sayings in the whole scriptures

it is as much as if they should have said not my will but thy will be done god and yet this church not to know her beloved now this is a sad and sudden alteration as remember the prophet jeremiah hath something of this nature concerning the daughters of zion jeremiah the fourth and the last have heard a voice as of a woman in travel and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first born the voice of the daughter of zion that spreadeth forth her hands and bewaileth her self saying woe is me now because of murderers
why what is the matter zion why dost thou cry out what need is there for thee to complain thou that art the spouse of christ can the husband forget his beloved wife no surely he hath promised great things for thee look what the lord thy redeemer hath promised to do for thee esayah
the lord is exalted for he dwelleth on high he hath filled zion with judgment and righteousness and wisdom knowledge shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation the fear of the lord is his strength and in the verse not one of her stakes shall be removed nor any of her cords thereof be broken and in the eighth of the next chapter for it is the day of the lords vengeance and the year of recompences for the controversie of zion

oh zion zion what need is there for thee to fear the lord is exalted in thee yea he hath accepted to dwell with thee and to be lifted up in thee he hath set the two pillars of his name in the midst of thee yea what greater pillars is there to manifest his name upon the earth than wisdom knowledge then to give this character of him the fear of the lord is his strength oh what stronger fortress canst thou have zion than the fear of the lord than the love of thy god for thus it is here meant for this is not a slavish fear nor a dreadful fear nor a terrifying fear no this is such a fear that is here made mention of that may well be compared to that that the apostle calls love yea perfect love that casteth out all such slavish fears and god promiseth further to be her security no one shall ever move any of her stakes neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken and he will not only be her safety to keep her secure but he will take vengeance of her enemies also and plead her controversie with those that rise up against her surely any one would think that zion might sleep securely but zion is here spreading forth her hands crying woe is me now my soul is wearied because of murderers as if she should have said my comforter hath left me my beloved is gone my joy is turned into bitterness my melody into sadness my mirth into sighing

and sobbing yea as she plainly expresseth esai
the lord hath forsaken me and my god hath forgotten me yea just now was this prophet a proclaiming her deliverance and the opening of her eyes as you may read in the following verses though a woman forget the child that sucketh at her brests yet will not forget thee no he then shews her that he had engraven her upon the palms of his hands and her behold it so that as said before the church of god and the people whom he loveth with an unmeasurable and ever abiding love may be at such a loss that many times they may think the lord hath withdrawn his affection clean from them but seldom find but god stayeth up their hearts so as to trust in him that their deliverance must be through him though many times he tryeth their fidelity and zeal to him and his name and at other times doth afflict them for their backsliding and careless walking to bring them to a more clear understanding that so they may walk worthy of such a god who hath laid up so good things in store for them might speak a great deal more to this manner of gods dealing with his choicest and peculiar people in this life but shall forbear to speak any more in this particular but shall refer what my intention is to speak further till we come to speak of them mean

the children of god yea those that are dear unto him jointly in their duty

there is a second affliction incident to these beloved ones but whereas you have them conquered in the former as it were you now have them conquerours and champions for now the captain of their salvation bids them go on and fear not so that now neither life nor death nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come is able to separate them from the love of god which is in christ jesus now here you have the shepherd leading forth his sheep into the pleasant pastures of content and now they know his voice so well that they will not give ear to strangers what though they be tempted with all the strangers seeming delights with his rich rewards according to appearance with all his promises of preferments and all the inchantments that he seemeth to present them withal yet all these will not intice them from those fruitful pastures nothing can allure them from this contented medow where they have the presence of their delightful shepherd giving them their meat in due season so that stolen waters do not seem sweet to them nor bread eaten in secret pleasant to them no they know that the assotiates and resorters thereunto shall have their portion with unbelievers in a place or degree far remote from their rest from their

content from their delight for their delight is in the law of the lord their god and to manifest his praise and his glory in working wonderfully amongst the sons of men and to declare unto others what god hath done for them and for the welfare of their souls and all sorrow and sighing will flee away from them neither the voice of mourning shall any more be heard in the midst of them for the lord that is their redeemer is also their husband who bideth them awake and put on their strength their beautiful garment for the uncircumcised and unclean shall no more come into thee what though thou hast drunk the cup of the lords fury in times past yet thou shalt henceforth drink it no more but it shall be taken forth of thy hand and given to them that spoiled thee esa
and the last verse of the ch so that now thou maist arise from the dust and sit still for the lord will redeem you from all your captivities that have been the occasion of your distressedness that have caused you in times past to howl and weep you shall be delivered from all your burthens that ye have unjustly born for the lord hath taken upon him to plead the controversie of his people so that now they need not fear what befals their bodies for they have a sufficient and satisfactory content that it shall fare well with their soul they fear not him that is able to kill the body and can do no more but him that is able to kill

both body and soul and to cast them into hell what though the world rage against them and their neighbours envy them and their kindred and chiefest of their relations here below do make a mocking and scoffing at thee is it any more than the captain of your salvation hath engaged you to by his sufferings know you not that if you will be his disciples you must wear your masters livery yea though it be dyed in as deep a crimson as his was on the cross is it not sufficient that the servant is made equal with his master am sure any earthly servant would account it a great favour that he should be admitted to have a garment made of the same piece of cloath that his master doth wear himself even so will all these that have experienced the honour and reward that is laid up at the end of their journey which no man can prevent or hinder them of receiving

therefore say these are not at all amazed at these things no they are no more than the honourable garments that all the guests of the must put on yea and that with much willingness too if it be laid down for you or tendered unto you for surely there is no man but will rather chuse a diamond than a cornelian if he hath experience of the worth of both in mens esteem even so will all those that have experienced the love of christ jesus and the

content that is in his wayes and the reward that shall be received by owning of him in truth and righteousness upon the face of the earth in the presence of all contemners of it and all contrariers of it they will shew themselves to be children of their father and servants of their master and stewards that will manifest their master to be one that is not onely able but willing also to give unto all those that will labour in his vineyard of the abundance of the pleasant fruit thereof yea they will tell unto others what a loving and tender god he hath been to them and what content they have had in obeying him and what safety there is in his paths as solomon hath it proverbs
all his wayes are pleasantness and all his paths are peace yea surely the way of the lord is great pleasure to them that know the plainness and the evenness and exactness of it aright to them it is a great pleasure to walk in this way but the slothfull cryeth out there is a lyon a bear in the way and therefore he will not venter he will lye down and take his ease and fold his eyes a little more in sleep or in his dark and obscure rest he will rather put things to the hazard as men had use to say then he will encounter with this lyon that will meet him and bereave him of all his lustful desires and of all his worldly pleasures and of heaping together the unrighteous mammon of

this world by couzening and defrauding the simple and by usurping the just priviledges of the poor the innocent and the harmless but here is something more yet for here is a bear also which he must meet if he will take his progress into this way that he must encounter with which at the best will affright and scare him if not tear him in pieces and devour him

whereas those that have been exercised to such a manner of walking in this way as to enjoy the pleasant of gods most glorious and unfathomable love they know after the dimest and darkest night the morning will produce light again and dispel the darkness so that though they see never so dark a cloud of gods fury in the way yet this shall not be a bear to them no they know that the sun will break thorow it if it be so that they keep constant in this way and do not run astray from the punctual rules thereof it is not a prison or a dungeon that will fear them
nor any earthly power that is contrary to the truth that wil daunt them no they know that if the powers of men do not stand according to the truth of god say their lives will not be dear to them not so dear but that they will rather part with their lives than part with that portion of truth that they have received so as to call light darkness and darkness light to dishonour him whom

they know is able to keep them safe in their evillest and worst of dayes look well to it beseech you every man and woman and lay not any burthen upon one another by unjust and unrighteous walking for this is the end a christian that god shall have no dishonour by his walking for if you deny god in this particular pray that he may not deny you before the angels in heaven
but before we proceed any further let us consider what observation we ought to take in the performance of these holy laws for as have shewed you in the forementioned lawes you must observe that as the is holy just and good so are his lawes righteousnesse and peace and love and faith and truth and patience and equity and justice and forgiveness and whosoever doth not observe and fulfil these lawes will lye lyable of being cast forth of this land and from participating of the benevolence and fruition of this

therefore let us walk wisely in our station for this short time that we have to abide in this our frail house or fabrick of earth that when we come to give an account of all our actions we may approach before his throne with all boldness by laying fast hold upon him that is our righteousness peace and sanctification and redemption knowing nothing of evil by our

selves and yet knowing nothing of justification in our works or by our works as proceeding from them that is there's no one that is an inhabitant in this land of zion but must observe and do the will of him that is the lawgiver and these are the duties of the subjects in this land the which when israel did discern they had broken and that it was onely the decayes of the statutes and lawes of zion that had been the occasion of their imprisonment the which now considered causeth their grief yea and that in such a nature too that they could not keep it in but it burst out
therefore that all captives that are in captivity in any respect as to their inward freedom may know which way to ease and release themselves let them observe and keep these following invitations that in case they have broken these lawes they may mourn for the decayes thereof and amend their wayes by walking more wisely that so they may be delivered for that is repentance to amend your wayes therefore take my advise and press forward

first let us consider what these lawes are that so ye may know how to keep them the first and greatest commandment is to honour the lord thy god with all thy heart and with all thy soul and the second is to love thy neighbour as thy self on these two depend all the laws instanced

in the law and the prophets mat
not that they are differing but hold all in one or both in one for thou canst not honour god more in any one thing than by loving thy poor neighbour it is the poor god as may so say or rather the sons of god that hath need of thy charity and not he that is the creator of all things for christ says plainly biding them to stand on his right hand for was hungry and ye gave me meat and a thirst and ye gave me drink and sick and in prison and ye administred unto my necessities verily verily say unto you inasmuch as ye did it unto these little ones ye did it unto me mat
verses so that say if thou art minded to praise god on the earth or whilst thou livest here deal justly with all men and as near as possible thou canst make that thy direction to deal the same bread to others that thou wouldst have god deal to thee for fear thy heart should so far deceive thee in doing to others as thou wouldst they should do to thee say that is a rule of rules if truly observed but beware thy heart do not deceive thee in this and thou thinkest thou dost it when thou fallest far short of it and so deceive thy self

for account it the one and onely way to set forth gods praise to deal faithfully with all men in all things especially to them that are

without or of another mind for who knoweth but hereby thou maist gain him to do the like whereas if thou should do to the contrary he would not onely be imboldned to do the like but would reproach and defame thy way of worship and bring a scandal upon all others that walk in the same profession as thou walkest in and not onely so neither but dishonour thy god also would desire all professors whatever to be wary in this respect lest the heathen condemn us in that great day of tryal and do not enquire concerning the unconstancy of the times nor the evil of the dayes but take the apostles direction if any man desire to live long and to see good dayes let him refrain his tongue from speaking evil and his lips that they speak no guile

and as it is beneficial to us to speak and act the truth so as said before it is the only way to manifest gods praise for as for what is done in private is done onely upon the account of our souls it is onely a conference between god and us so far as concerns our souls welfare or reward but what we do before men is either to set forth the praise or dispraise of god and whereas christ sayes give not your almes before men he doth not command you to hold up your charity before men but not to give it only because men do behold it we must not make it

our chief end to give it to be praised of men for if we give it thus we have our reward but if we give it before thousands and could as freely give if there were no man by and give it onely to nourish their bodies knowing that we are but stewards of it and our master may take it away from us when he pleaseth for it is given us but for this intent to feed the hungry and cloath the naked and to administer to the necessities of such as are in distress and in such cases it ought to be as really theirs as ours for we are but stewards of it and if the lord of the husbandry do find that we do not distribute faithfully according to his will he can take it forth of our hands in a moment and call us to an account for our stewardship do but mark what the apostle john sayes if any man hath this worlds goods and seeth his brother in want and shutteth up the bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of god in him the first of john
chap
not that conclude that the love of god must be in every man that doth relieve the needy but be sure these are the manifestations of god in his people there are some it may be will relieve the poor because their fathers have done the like before them and so they will not have their name decay but will seek to uphold it amongst men
and others it may be will give to the poor because they will exceed such and such men that have as great estates as they have that they may have more praise than their neighbours but alas all this doth not reach the mark of a christian for thou maist give all thy goods to the poor and thy body to the fire to be burned and yet have no charity and it profiteth nothing of the corinthians and the thirteenth chapter and the third verse no the poor widows mite mark the twelfth and the forty third and fourth verses is more than all this and that is as little as may be if it be so that you cast your gift into this treasury with any acceptance therefore do not stay your selves upon this as any sure foundation that it is enough to give but you must give it with all your heart yea even as to the lord knowing that it is one of the greatest presidents of a christians verification


and as you must be willing and cheerful so you must be careful too in your almes you must not do it as if you did not care how you did it or when you did it or as though you did not care whether ever you did it or not as there is too many do now a dayes it is to be feared they do the work of the lord negligently religion is too too commonly lookt upon with too careless an eye only for outward shews and ceremonial traditions

as shall shew you more hereafter
say you must study to do good works yea how to do them that you may glorifie god in your doing of them and advance his interest and magnifie his name and that he may have the preheminence of all and therefore christ bids them math

in the beginning take heed when you give your almes and that you must not let your left hand know what your right hand doth so that it seems there is a left hand that is contrary to the right that is prying into thy giving of thy almes yea it seems such a left hand that is apt to declare thy bounty to be praised of men and therefore christ bids thee take heed as in the next verse he plainly intimates so much that thy almes may be in secret and thy father that seeth in secret shall reward thee openly this left hand is a member of that body of which you have mention made of the right hand in the former chapter verse that if it offend thee you must cut it off lest it should be the occasion of the whole body being cast into hell wish that we have not too too many such hands in our professions in these times that rather administer to our applause in religion here before men than to the glory of god or the relieving of others that are in distress

look well into your hearts beseech you and

examine them thorowly that you may repent if any such thing be while it is day for god will find you out in the end therefore say you must be careful in your deeds of charity if you intend either to glorifie god or reap any benefit to your selves in it do it with all diligence and fervency of spirit even as paul chargeth timothy so ought every one to make it his charge and duty to be careful in this particular lest you deceive your selves and wait for a reward when you have had it already of men from whom you sought it in your intent of parting with your gift must confess in this thing or particular you may come very near to the mark in your own conceits for to feed the hungry and cloath the naked and relirve the oppressed that is a very good work if done to a good end but how canst thou say thou dost it to any good end or aim at gods glory when thou settest thy self in the highest and first degree in thy almes and hast respect unto thy own praises that men should adore and praise thee for it

no no do not not mistake thy self for no man can serve two masters for either the one or the other must be neglected and not honoured god will admit of no partners he will either have all thy service or else he will not accept of any say he will have no partners but as he created and formed all things so he will have the

preheminence of all things both by thee and all others either to your eternal happiness or else by shewing his power upon thee to thy destruction therefore you must resolve to be careful if you expect the praise of god or have any love to his name to do his work willingly and zealously and to be wary that the devil do not deceive thee in any one thing and so take away the efficacy of it from thee by any of his cunning wiles for he will watch all opportunities to ensnare thee in thy charity knowing it to be one of the grand pillars of a believers warfare


as you must be willing to give your almes and careful how you give them so you must be ready to give them for if you say you are or would be willing that any one that is in distresse should be relieved yet many times when your conscience tells you that such and such poor people are in distress you are not so ready as to give them that relief that may in any competent measure diminish their grievances as the apostle hath it do all things with all readiness and cor
for know the forwardness of your minds therefore boasted of you to them of macedonia that achia was ready a year ago the apostle doth make his boast of their readiness to administer to the necessity of such as were in distress yea he urgeth it to others that they might walk by this example as not knowing

any of more use in this life it being one of the needfullest effigies of a christian as paul saith of it that your zeal in it had provoked very many to do the like therefore say as you profess your selves to have received the love of god so let your love abound toward your brethren as christ sayes let your light so shine before men that they seeing your good works may glorifie your father which is in heaven matth

for god is the father of such love and he will not be ashamed to own those that do this work with willingness and carefulness and readiness for we do herein as it were represent him on earth for he bestoweth his blessings upon us meerly of his own willingness and freeness as it is expressed of his own will begat he us in christ jesus and he is also careful of us and shall not we be careful to serve him as you have it the true watchman of israel neither slumbers nor sleeps and he is also ready no bestow his mercies and blessings upon us for it is expressed matth

he knoweth before hand what we have need of as if he studied to know our wants and to keep those things ready for us against we have need of them for he that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it is opened unto him matth

so that if you will but go to the fountain you may drink freely it is not locked from you unless you bring a

poysoned pitcher with you to destroy your selves defame the fountain then hope you will acknowledge his love to be as great in this as in any thing surely men would be willing and careful and ready to serve such a god who is so good to them if they did or do any waves render their own welfare wish you could but experience the apostles words in this particular although he was speaking of another when he uttered the words which are these the love of god constraineth me yea am accursed if do not do according to his will

so surely any one that doth profess himself to have received more than others he will and must enforcedly man fest it in the sight of men upon every or the most part of his occasions do not put this most part in to keep any from striving to walk in the highest and exactest manner that may be but knowing the choisest of gods people may be overtaken in a fault but not that any of them can pass by this fault without great remorse and grief of heart for it and they could willingly redeem the time if it were possible either by a private repentance or publick instruction to others but this is a stile too high to speak of in these dayes fear and yet assure your selves it is no more than ought to be in every professor for if you do but seriously consider in your own hearts you will find it is not a

careless thing to profess christ and acknowledge your selves to be his servants for you must expect to do his will if you will be approved worthy of such a master as shall shew you more plainly hereafter


as you must be willing to bestow your charity and careful how you do it and ready to bestow it so you must be bountiful and liberal in your deeds of charity you must not lay up in your corrupt treasuries to buy such a lordship no nor such a small cottage neither if you see that your poor brethren are in necessity or want it was an excellent observation of a late deceased scholar who when the officers of the parish came to him for moneys they argued the needfulness of mens bounty in such a good work saying there was none of more concernment than to repair the temple of the lord he answered them it was both needful and justifiable before god and man but he bid them beware they did not respect the dead temple for the living temples and so fail in their intent in both so would entreat all those that profess themselves to be religious in their actions here of obedience to gods will that they do not mistake themselves and adorn the dead temple with superfluous varieties when the living temples wants a sufficiency to keep themselves alive look well to your selves account it my duty to deal plainly with you fear

it is too too common in our dayes for that love beat you in christ jesus could wish it were otherwise with many of you for if you neglect the repairing of the living temples there is nothing that will hold in any harmonious tune in religious obedience it is not enough to say the temple of the lord the temple of the lord but you must shew your selves to mind the temple of the lord for it is not a fained profession nor a guilded ceremony that will serve your turn nor mine in the last day but as we profess our selves to have received more than others so let us walk more righteously and more faithfully than they do that we may not condemn them with our tongues seemingly and condemne our selves in our actions in the sight of god and men for we may seem here before men to be zealous for the lord and it may be think really that we are so do but mark what solomon says there is a way that seemeth right but the end is the end of death proverbs
and in esayah
unto what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me am full of your burntofferings and your sacrifices desire not so much of this manner of ceremonial services without you will work the effects of them that is to cease to do evil and that they would learn to do well and seek judgment and relieve the oppressed and judge the fatherless and plead for the widow and then come unto me and will reason

with you and though your sins be as red as scarlet they shall be as white as snow yea though they be as red as crimson they shall be made as wool if we bring these sacrifices before the lord he accepts of them and will delight himself in us but if we forget to bring these with us we had better to stay away than come before god in vain to expect a blessing when there is none assigned for us it is to as much purpose for a man to think he hath a true faith in christ when he hath not charity as it is for a builder to think to build a tower when he hath but one stone to build it do you not mind what the apostle james saith to such sort of men james
and last as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead it is true thou maist have a faith to believe there is a god even so pharaoh king of egypt exod
he did believe there was a god in israel yet he would not obey him nor leave the worshipping of idols till the lord did overthrow him and his host into the midst of the sea and as you may read of nebuchadnezzar daniel
he did believe that the god of daniel was the god of gods and lord of kings dan

yet he did set up an image contrary to what daniel did worship and commanded all people to fall down and worship it so as said before it is not enough to have a faith but you must have a working

faith a living faith a stedfast faith and an upright and charitable faith for as paul saith cor
he that soweth sparingly shall reap sparingly and he that soweth bountifully shall reap bountifully let every man give as he hath purposed in his heart not grudgingly or of necessity for god loveth the cheerful giver not but that god is able to provide a sufficient satisfaction for his children without your aid or help but know he will try thee man how far thy charity will extend toward thy weak and helpless brother god doth not make use of us for need but for his pleasure that he taketh in seeing us improve our talents and that we should manifest to all the world that we are a people that have a god exceeding all other gods in love and tenderness and bounty and strength how would all people stand reviling of our god and disdaining our way of worship if they should see us walk undiscretly and loosly they would be apt to say lo behold how prophane and vain a thing it is for such and such men who profess they walk in a higher and more clearer light than they have done or than we do but they can let their brethren lack bread and cloaths and can wear such needless tryphles and build such and such brave houses that we can live without and content our selves without say these things may be done if that thing that is more needful bee

not left undone but if one must be left undone say look that you leave the less needful useful undone for know the life and body of thy poor brother is altogether as precious in the sight of god as thine this thy undiscret and vain carriage doth give thy enemies advantage to revile thee and to defame thy brethren and to blaspheme the worthy name of our god whereas if we walk more strictly more wisely and more charitably the mouths of all such people will be stopped and they will be ready to commend thy way of worship to praise those that you do associate your selves withal and to glorifie the name of god by which you are called so that if you will profess your selves to be servants of god you must walk in the wayes of godliness and think not that it is the performance of your duty to talke of charity and love but you must make it your business to administer and distribute your charity to all such as are in distress and want knowing that if you will manifest your selves to be imployed in his work you shall receive a recompence worthy of your labour for if god spared not his onely son but delivered him up to death for us that we might be freed from the power of death surely thou wilt not think thy sabout too much to serve him in thy estate or rather in his ovvn say thou vvilt not be so unjust a steward to let thy masters servants dye for vvant

of food when he hath provided enough for them no certainly thou wilt rather walk up and down from one end of the vineyard to the other to see that all thy fellow servants have their meat in due manner and due season if thou dost respect the love of thy master and the praise of it will redound so far to thee in the end if thou performest his will as that he will make thee one of his family for ever and thou shalt reign in joy and gladness to eternity now he which doth this work of charity must observe that he have not more respect for himself than for god in his heart for look for it for the devil will never leave searching to find out one tradition or customary self setting up to find out some one devise or other if thou take this work in hand to represent thee unstable in thy undertakings in one respect or other knowing it to be one of the greatest forts that a christian can acquire for his unattemtible and unanimous residence if truly and exactly built for without this uniformity it is impossible to put on the whole armour of god nay dare be bold that no man what ever can assure himself to put on any part of the armour of god and not take up this with it for how can it be said that you have armed your selves with truth when you have not obeyed the god of truth or how can any man say that righteousness is his when he

hath neglected to do his masters business and hath left his masters commands unobeyed or how can any man say his feet are shod with the preparation of the gospel when he walketh in obscure and dark wayes if you have your feet shod with the gospel you will walk in the path and way of the gospel now christ is the true and righteous way described in the gospel and he thought it not too much to sacrifice his life for us and greater charity thou canst not have than to yield up thy life in obedience to the god of love and no man can come to the father but by and in him

and as for thy taking faith to be thy shield when thou goest to withstand the devil thou wilt be overcome if thou dost not take love along with thee for the devil will quickly find out a place to dart thee in if thou leave charity behind thee for this take what the apostle says shew me thy faith by thy works and then thou maist put on the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit for as he that redeemed you is holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation pet

and elsewhere hereby shall all men known that ye are my disciples if you love one another john
and the fruits of the spirit are love joy peace gal

so that say it is in vain to think of withstanding the devil but that he will wound thee in one respect

or other if thou dost not put on all thy armour even the whole armour of god


he that undergoeth this duel or maketh war against this enemy had needs be very studious to know yea knowing what it is that he is to encounter withal for thy enemy goeth about daily to seek to circumvent thee so that when thou makest war against lying and deceit beware he doth not overcome thee by imputing a strength to thy self in thy striving and so get into thy harbour and weaken thy strength and fort likewise when you fortifie your self against unrighteousness he will be presenting thee with a seeming righteousness that if you are not very watchful shall give you more content seemingly than any that you have chosen if you do not know experimentally the odour that is in your choise for he will endeavour either to delude thee that thou art more righteouss than such and such men and so set thee a judging of others and a taking gods office forth of his hands that he may bereave thee of the efficacy of thy labour that way or else endeavour to sow some tares amongst thy wheat make you delight your self in embracing for righteousness for some one self end or other for his tares are many times so like thy wheat that it is hard to gather them out of it without it be so that thou art very well insenced of the nature and taste of them and as for thy fervency

for the gospel of god in opposing all his assaults for this likewise he will not want endeavours to stir up enemies both of thy seeming friends and known enemies that if he cannot entice thee to a false understanding of them he will endeavour to screen thy mind to abuse thy knowledge in matter of action if it be possible and so hid it from thy discerning of it but in case he finds thee so watchful that he cannot make a conquest of the according to his will or desire this way then possibly he will try thee further if god permit him power so as to put thee into prison nay it may be to take away thy life also for thy servent zeal for the gospel but know if thou art brought so far thy god will not leave thee then though thou maist seemingly have a cloud for a season yet the sun will presently break thorow and expel the darkness of the time at an instant yea in a moment of time happy is he that overcometh all the rest to give testimony of his fidelity in this to all beholders but shall speak somewhat more to that hereafter so shall defer it at this time

but you must press forward still you are not yet come to discern the difficulty of this your urgent and needful care for we are now to discuss the grand part of his enmity in seeking to keep us from believing in the captain of our salvation and in relying upon him for all out

strength now he is labouring to deceive us of taking up this wapon of faith so he will endeavour to fix our minds upon our own strength and to trust in what conquest we have it is meerly of our own care and of our own vvatchfulness yea he vvill not leave any corner of thy heart unattempted if he see that there is any possibility of getting vvithin thy vvalls under a pretended notion of friendship that so he may deceive and rob thee of this thy weapon it being the chief weapon of our defence if truly fixed by vvhich vve are enabled to quench all the fiery darts of the vvicked and so keep our rare jevvel from all his demonical delusions for if he once get this shield of faith from thee by any deceitful contrivance he vvill make a conquest of thee at his pleasure for he knovveth it is not for him to assault any that have this shield in their hand to defend themselves vvithal say it is not for him to attempt the overthrovving of these by any ordinary vvay that is contrary to their vvay of vvorship or to stand in opposition to maintain a pitcht battel against such vvho have their faith truly grounded and fixed upon the love and strength of christ jesus but he vvill not lack flatteries such as may seemingly sympathise vvith the true and grand emulations of truth in shew profession though it shall differ in the intent or end of their doing it therefore say he

that is a warriour in a christian warfare must not war onely against known waverings and unconstancy and unstability of mind but against seeming stedfastness and seeming confidence and seeming unmoveableness also for you must stand upon your watch and examine every thought that cometh by you and try it whether it will abide the or not in every particular before you grant it admittance for you may be deceived if you do not take great heed for the devil may appear in the likeness of an angel of light and do many things unlikely it may be as thou thinkest for him to do for he can be as faithful and as religious as the scribes and pharisees but he will not be willing that you should attribute any thing to god as proceeding from him or that you should aim at his glory in the performance of it but as said before though your work of faith be seemingly the same in shew or ceremony yet it will not be the same in event and effect yet it hath been so like the true faith as that the people of old have cryed peace peace when the lord hath not said it yea he hath been so subtil in his end as that he hath deceived both prophet and people and he did appear very subtily with these scribes and pharisees for they did give the effigies of true faith in many respects seemingly for it was built upon almes and the fulfilling of

the law and prayers for their success in it but they gave their almes to be seen of men and therefore they had their reward for as they gave them to be praised of men even so they had the praise of men for their gifts and as for their aim to fulfil the ceremonies and rites of the law they were very exact in many respects as to pay tithes of mint and anise mat
but to relieve the oppressed and plead the cause of the needy they had small care of that and they would make a conscience sermingly to god as to pray often to him that under a pretence of religion in this they would devour widows houses so as they seemed to be exactly religious in the fight of men they were not religious hardly in any one thing before god

for it is not so easie and idle a thing as many think it is to be a christian or a man for if you build your faith upon any other rock than christs death and resurrection say if you do not war against all other fabricks you cannot exercise your faith with any good warrant say if you do not pull down and root up all other appearances that are not one with this and hold in concurrance in this as proceeding from the same root center which christs undergoings have meritoriously crowned us withal you can in no measure exercise a faith with any good warrant but we shall yoke our selves with burthensom

impediments in our more higher agitations and divine aspirations for no clear eye can discern things of so bright and clear an appearance so divine manifestation much less believe them it is not to believe that it is any thing of our own merits that a true faith must be built upon but all such thoughts and conclusions strike at the original grounds of a true faith as and is contradictory an enemy to it as may be do but mark what the apostle paul sayes of the grounds of a true faith rom
being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in jesus christ whom god hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness for the remission of sin through the forbearance of god to declare say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in jesus christ will not look upon you as partners in the grounds of your faith for as he hath conquered all such enemies who did lead us captive at their will by his suffering for us to pacifie the devine fury of his father and to be a propitiation for to interceed with his father for us that he might reconcile all differences that did hinder us from having a peaceable and compleat union and ownness with our god that so he might be our father as well as his father and our god as well as his god and

that he might rejoice in us as brethren being united and annexed with him by what had undergone for us that so we might jointly declare the manifold love of god and sing praises to his name say this was the intent of christ in his interceeding to the father for us onely he would not have us slight his undertakings for us and so deceive our selves and dishonour his mockings and his scoffings and deridings that he did bear for our offences when we should have perished to all eternity had not he stept in between our sin his fathers wrath and did that for us that we were not able to do for our selves so that he will have us to own him to be the authour and finisher of our faith heb
so as said before you must war against every appearance of evil and every thing that seeketh to oppose this vvay of grounding your faith but shall leave it to your study to examine how many such guests you have given entertainment to as thinking them to be your friends intending to speak a vvord or tvvo more of it in some of my follovving discourse if god permit time and leave

and as you have resisted and must resist all the foregoing invocations of this your invious yet more subtil enemy so you must engage against all his extrinsical and seeming vvayes of ensnaring you in your charity for he vvill not leave

striving to conquer thee by craft if it be possible if he see that it is in vain to tempt thee otherwayes he will promise thee great gain and great content yea he will give thee all the inticements and the allurements that the whole world can afford and he will perswade with thee that thou maist keep all these and be charitable too he doth not care how fair a pretence thou makest of being charitable but be sure of this he will strike at the very root of it if it be put in practice with any true intent to gods glory and that if you are not very exact in your deliberating your selves he will be too hard for you in one respect or other for if you war against him in maintaining your deeds of charity and do not war against his ends in your charity or against your own pride and selfseeking you had as good lay your weapons down and do not pretend to withstand him when you go about to fortifie his strength for he had as live have you profess and practice both so as he can but delude you to set up an idol to offer it to for it is no better if we offer any praise to any imagined thing that is due to god for an image or an idol is no more nor less than to set up any thing in our devine worship and attribute more honour to it and have more esteem of it than is due to it by gods appointment this will be a hard saying for many professors to pass by and yet it is no more than you will find to be true in

the end the prophet jeremiah hath a notable expression to this purpose jeremiah
the people would not be beaten down from offering spiced cakes to the queen of heaven not that you read any thing that they had any formed substance but an imaginary fancy and as the apostle said in his time there are gods many and lords many bue unto them there was but one god and father of all things and as he hath it in another place concerning others they worshipped the creature more than the creator who is god for ever amen as you may read rom
as he plainly expresseth in the foregoing verses that they changed the glory of the incorruptible god into an image made like corruptible man and birds four footed beasts and creeping things even as if the apostle should have said that they worshipped themselves and bestowed and attributed that glory that was gods own by due right to themselves and gloried in so doing and delighted themselves in birds and four footed beasts and creeping things more than in the creator from whence they had their being and therefore he sayes god gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts to dishonour their own bodies between themselves besure that when they came to that degree of apostasie god would not leave them without punishment for it but lets them run into all unseemly

behaviour as you may read the
vers of this chap when god gives up a people to their own lusts desires of their own hearts they run on from one degree of unrighteousness to another till at last they are so captivated by their own lusts that though they come to see that they act contrary to the rules of natural reason yet they have small or no desire to leave it but run on still and persist from one evil device to another from committing fornication with their own lusts to covetousness and malignity and so to murther and debate and having no understanding they become as the apostle instances they were without natural affection implacable and unmerciful therefore say beware of idolatry and do not make it your business to worship these and such like gods as the apostle hath it plainly phil

whose gods are their bellies and whose glory is their shame but fix your faith aright in gods prescribed rule and then you will be able to wage war with the devil in his cunningest designs but it will require your fervent care continually to watch that you may know and be sure to be provided for his coming

for if you seek to do the will of the father which is holiness and purity you must observe what his commands are and do not think to secure your selves by notional pretences and literal

expressions rudely reasoning with your selves in the worst of sences and the extravigants of courses accounting it a small sin to offend god or to walk contrary to his commandements of love and chartly peace and truth for if you walk contrary to this you may profess what you please but if your actions and intentions do not answer what your pretences seem to blaze forth into notional extreams as may so account them will not value that opinion though they pretend to be saints or angels for if they walk so loosly as that their own hearts condemn them in their intention much more may god condemn them who seeth in secret and knoweth in secret happy is he that can try all things with solomon and yet not be linked in his affection to any thing speak as in respect of his serving or idolizing any thing below god he can rejoice with a heroick spirit not onely that devils are made subject to him but that his name is written in the book of life he can try and search into the secondary powers of the world and yet not like to the phylosophers of the heathen conclude that the images of them should be worshipped because as they say they represent their gods to them and that the reverencing of god is the uncovering of the head or the sprinkling with holy water and exterior expiations and exteriour ornaments for our devine prayses as musical harmony

and burning of wax candles and light and ringing of bells and adorning of temples altars and images in which as they say is required a special reverence and comeliness

this is not a garden for such to plant their vine in who by the spirit of jehovah can like the bee suck honey out of the thistle and yet account the the more rarer flower he that is truly grounded in this will well know what mean in all the rest it is not the sun moon nor any inferiour light by which they walk or act but acknowledge a more supream and splendant brightness to be their guide in all things and that they can try all these and make it experimentally appear that they seek the honour of him which governeth and ruleth all things even as he pleaseth and when he pleaseth to alter them they are made subject to him at all seasons yea he giveth them a brighter splendor at one time than at another to our appearance and what is the glory of any thing but in the manifestation of it oh happy is he that like the bee can go to thistles and suck vertue out of them as well as forth of the sweetest flowers though they are more in esteem in their sight it argues the spirit of discerning as well as the spirit that tryeth and searcheth he needs not fear the being deceived that knoweth honey when he tryeth it much less he that knoweth it by

sight he will not like the waspe lye prying after the bees nest when he can suck the purest forth of the flower and peradventure there may be a more bitter sting in the nest than he bringeth power to expel as the snake doth commonly keep both bee and waspe away though they have both stings yet let this be your observation that the lesser must be swallowed up of the greater or else be put to flight thrice happy is he that is truly conquered by the true swallower up of all things

he can plead a true and certain interest with any man or all men for whatever doth branch forth it self if really engrafted into this stock it will be abidable although the winter frosts may seemingly eclipses the beauty of our professions yet it cannot reach our root but we shall retain so much sap there as will cause our branches to flourish again in their season for as the phylosophers conclude the sun will not spend all his year in a sign where he hath his detriment or fall but will by his progressive motion in his exactness in his line or circuit go strait forward and doth not look backward as though he was afraid of those captivating powers that have as may say so dominion over him at such times as is apparent in our horizon that that power that he assureth himself of in march he is deprived of in september and that glorious shew of heat yea even

to scorch us as it were in july is overswayed by the unequal frequenting of a januaries approach yet say they the sun doth continue going forward still notwithstanding all his repulses by the unfortunate solicits of his most potent enemies
even so he that doth really know the worth of grace and the benefit of his endeavours that christ hath purchased for all them that will believe and lay fast hold upon him in his death and resurrection say such a one that is truly sensible of what worth and value christs death and life is to all those that enjoy a portion of it effectually operating over all the lets and impediments that are in the way to hinder his true discerning of it he cannot but press forward accounting himself happy in each step that he addeth to his journey wherein he discerneth that he getteth ground you need not to urge such a one to be wary for he cannot but discern when he getteth ground and when he hath lost for if all men speak well of him and assure him of peace yet if he in searching find any corner of his heart not swept be sure he will not cry peace to himself but will take the besom of righteousness and truth and will carefully sweep it out and make all clean within for he cannot sleep in quiet till he hath got his house clean

as no earthly man can take his rest when he knoweth that there is a thief within his house

that will take all advantage to rob him but will rather rise and lock up his chiefest jewels that they may not be taken away from him if in case he cannot get him forth of the house but though they are locked never so fast and there be not any thief within his house yet if he hath any treasure that he taketh much delight in he will be watchful lest any one should break into his house unexpected and bereave him of that in which he so much delighteth

even so a discerning christian that knoweth there is a thief within his house he cannot but dread the worst of things so long as any suspected enemy is within his confines but if he know that there is none but he hath tryed all of them thorowly yet he will stand upon his watch and keep his doors locked about him when he is at home and when he goeth abroad he is wary with whom he doth confer as associates fit for his result so that whether he is with the lord at his home or whether in the turba of the mind yet he will be watchful that strangers do not intermedle with his joy in any way to deprive him of that enjoyment by which he can convey his soul to its most fixed bliss no man can beat him off of this his watchfulness when he hath once tasted the love of god so as to witness that he is satisfied with it not that think it is enough to seem satisfied or to talk of being satisfied but speak

of them that are really and indeed satisfied you have a notable text of scripture in the of john christ tells the woman of samaria that he that drinketh of that water that he shall give them shall never thirst again and in the of john he tells the jews that their fathers did eat manna in the wilderness and were dead but whosoever shall eat of that bread which shall give them shall live for ever will not say but many may taste of this bread in some measure in many degrees and yet never hardly stand upon their watch to keep dogs from eating of it out of their mouths as may so say and carrying it away out of their sight and bring them some of their old dyet even garlick and onions these are such as were taken in the parable for the stony ground in which the seed wanted root yea the heat of the sun caused it to wither but that which fell on good ground brought forth plentifully even unto the harvest therefore say he that warreth in this life must be sure to watch when the enemy doth seek to assault and batter down his walls and to defame his weapons and to poyson them with his intermingled seeming delights whereby he doth lye in wait to infect us even as a fisher doth lay baite for to catch his intended prey

so that you shall have baited hooks such as you will think are very rare and agreeable to suit

with your disposition as near as may be and to advance his own ends he will fit you if it be possible for he hath variety of pleasant dainties if you will but be perswaded to deal with him he will deal for small profit rather than loose your acquaintance if it be but a making slight of your word or a in your worship or to worship for custom or to believe because others say it is true when it may be you have no warrant in your own hearts that it is true but because others say it is so therefore you will believe it for you are sure that such men would not say it if it were not so as have heard many say when they have had no other reason to believe it but because other men have affirmed it

alas my poor friends you that have no other ground for your faith than what another doth give you say that you that satisfie your selves with what others say and do not enquire whether it be according to gods holy word that is left us for an example you are far from knowing what you fix your faith upon and you will be like to the children of israel that could follow moses because they saw that god did work many miracles by him but when moses was longer in the mount than they supposed he would have stayed they are presently at a loss and charge aaron to make them a god to go before them exod
and as we read they were

forty years under his preaching to them and yet it is recorded of them that they knew not the wayes of god there is many writers that affirm them to be a peculiar and absolute people by their deserts but find no such thing recorded in scriptures therefore shall speak what is made manifest to me though know it will seem harsh to many to believe what have here inserted but would have them to take notice that it is one thing for a people to be made happy by desert and obedience and it is another to be made happy by gods infinite mercy and forgiveness as you have israel made happy by gods love and compassion to them in the wildernesse but not by desert there is a great difference between gods loving a people a peoples obeying god therefore would desire every one to seriously consider when they read or hear what is the occasion of the words spoken and the time when it was spoken and the dispensation that the people were under when it was spoken and what degree of faith the people were heirs of by knowledge that it was effectually to be made theirs for if your enemy can but intrap you he will soon be more potent if it be possible for he hath an apple for eve and so to betray adam and a discontended pride in cain to bring him to murther abel gen
and a fear in abraham to make him deny that sarah was his wife and

a feast for noah to make him commit fornication with his two daughters and a covetousness in jacob to deny his brother a mess of pottage unless he would assign him his gen
and afterwards he feared that god was not able to help him to the blessing of isaac without his deluding of his old father and belying the truth and a pride for david that he might number the people and so displease his god sam

and a lovely delilah for sampson that he might take away his life judg the

might instance several things more of these his forementioned stratagemes and cunning devices which he hath made use of as is apparent in the old testament and new to which shall refer you happy is he that keepeth his watch and standeth closely armed ready to answer him in any of his attempts that he may rejoice over all his workes that hath gained the victory by keeping close to the rule of his preserving and defending saviour knowing that it is by his strength that he doth stand by giving heed to the narrowst and difficulst of his command observing it meerly for the glory of his father knowing that he can no wayes shew himself to seek a kingdom that is not of this life unless he renounce the pleasures of this life for whosoever calleth god father and abideth in sin is a lyar john the

first the chapter and
because he calleth god father when he hath not known god in his manifestations neither doth god own his actions
there is a people whom have heard much of that when they are going about any thing that they imagine will hardly bear the raste of the scripture they will say that they will enquire of god whether they may do it or no and so will through the strength of the desire of their own wills draw the sence and intent of the scriptures to what they please or what pleaseth their fancy best and think themselves secure enough too if they have but framed a prayer for god to direct them in it though it may be they will not hearken to what god putteth into their mindes at that time neither but adhere rather to what is more beneficial as they think for their own ends not that they will blot the scripture clean out in shew but it shall seem difficult to them in such cases and so will under a pretence of religion do those things that neither reason equity nor scripture will bear them any testimony of this is as much as if they should go to enquire of god whether they might freely murther a man or not and if their desire be drawn out to it and in case god do not shew them some wonder or sign or presently pour down some judgement upon them they should be free to do it
this is as a great a delusion of the devil to draw any mans mind to prayer for god to direct them in any thing when their minds are absolutely bent to do wickedly say it is one of the highest provocations to provoke gods fury that you can invent as the psalmist hath it the prayers of the wicked are abomination unto the lord it is a thing too common in our dayes for many men to content themselves with a form of prayer when it may be they understand not any one petition of what they require nor that the thing that they require be according to the will of god or not which he hath left for our instruction but rather seek to bring the will of god to those things that may stand with their advantage and their benefit and if they can but keep themselves from the laws of men taking hold of them they think they shall be safe enough so that they can but have the praise and applause of the great rabbies of the times they look no further but it was moses choice rather to suffer afflictions with the children of god than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season heb

but those that seek a kingdom in this world they take little or no care for their future joy but think it shall alwayes go well with them because they imagine it is rather better with them than with the righteous at present and they see

no alteration but gods love is as much to them as to any one sort of people and they flourish as david sayes like a green and have no frowns from god neither see any change therefore they go on securely as they think and they will persist in their own wayes still as the psalmist hath it psal
god shall hear and afflict them even he that abideth of old because they have no changes therefore they fear not god it is not enough to think of being secure because they see no change god may let thee alone it may be for the time that thou art to live or abide in this life but be sure of this you must come to give up your account at the last day where all your actions will be tryed by the fire whether they will abide or not and whatever we have done in this life must be brought before the judgment seat of god where great mens words will not serve our turn nor all our former seeming friends can bayle us but justice will be justice as well as mercy will be mercy god cannot lay neither of them aside therefore stay not your minds upon great mens ability neither upon the pretended friendship of any man or men for it is thy own conscience that must appear to excuse or else accuse thee so that say rather loose the friendship of all other seeming friends than wrong this thy chief friend which if he be forced to be thy enemy will do thee more wrong

than all thy other friends can do thee good setting christs sufferings aside and they will be of small or no effect to thee if you give admittance to any unrighteous guests therefore rather loose all the friendship that may any wayes seem to prefer thee in this life yea thy right hand than endanger the being shut forth of heaven it is not any other friend save thy conscience that must give an account for thy actions in this life it will lye upon thy self either for good or evil the kingdom of heaven is like unto a pearl that when a marchant hath found he selleth all that he hath to purchase it math


even so he that hath ever experienced the love of god will leave his father and mother and all other seeming friends whatever rather than loose this pearl or act contrary to the truth yet christ doth not any wayes advise children to be disobedient to their earthty parents in respect to their obedience if it be possible to content them or obey them but rather adviseth them to be just obeyers of god by keeping the commandments of god commanded to be kept in the presence of god and men and not that any one can imagine himself to be an approved fulfiller of the laws of god so long as he acts unjustly between man and man as remember it was historically expressed of the judgment of some heathens concerning

the opinion of the christians that they judged the god of the christians was not a good god by reason of their unfaithfulness one toward another and their unhumane carriage toward them it is a sad omen of conversion when they that should become a pattern to others to walk by become a reproach and defame to their god or rather the god of truth in their actions towards men never did read that christ or his apostles did leave them any such example but rather to approve our selves to be examples of the flock and not lords over gods heritage and ro offer no offence neither to the jew nor gentile cor
but rather shew our selves to be such as seek to glorifie the name of god by our uprightness and exactness to men
even as it is recorded of the prophet daniel dan

then the presidents and princes sought to find an occasion against daniel concerning the kingdom but they could find none occasion nor fault forasmuch as he was faithful neither was there any errour or fault in him then said these men we shall not find any occasion against this daniel except we find it against him concerning the law of his god faithfulness is a happy ornament though they that wear it may be persecuted by men yet they will be upheld by god

oh let us not pretend to be spiritual walkers when we have not acted the things

that meet moralists account no less than their duty to do lest we become heirs of that wo pronounced against the seribes and pharisees math

for pretending to be more righteous than any one sort of people in their time and under a pretence of long prayers devour widows houses and pervert the cause of the needy oh let me intreat you to look to your souls and do not make your liberty a cloak of maliciousness and deceit but go to the light that your deeds of darkness may be reproved and know you can no wayes tempt god more than to pray to him with any you do no better than seek to pull a curse upon your own heads but whenever you would be directed to pray take these three directions first desire with the help of god to banish all and that so you may come to understand the will of god in the scriptures
secondly consider really with your self that the thing that you do desire is not to the prejudice of any one but that you do as you would have others do to you in case they were in your condition

thirdly be sure that you use as much mercy in your undertakings as you would have god use to you in the last day and then if you find that all these agree in and with your undertakings

you may expect an answer assuredly from the lord that is to say a blessing
for do but mind the strange appearances of men in our times in their intercessions to god in prayer one prayeth for the restoring of one thing another prayeth for the throwing of that thing down and one will persecute another because he will not worship god as he would have him worship him and another will seek to take away the life of others because they will not be conformable to what they conceive is the right way of worship so that religion may but be your cloak you value not what rule you have for your actions oh england england hast thou forgot a people that the prophet complains of that drew near to god with their lips but their hearts were far away from observing his wayes oh that could but cause thee to understand the things that belong to thy peace before they are hid from thy eyes then surely you would own god to be a god of peace and love and not such an imagined fancy as most men imagines him to be and then you would come to understand that obedience is better than sacrifice and to hearken is better than the fat of rams and to cry who is paul and who is apollo and who is cephas paul plants and apollo waters but it is god that must give the encrease cor

it is far better for us to leave off professing

our selves to be religious than to pretend to a great height of religion and walk in the unhumane rudiments of the world for whosoever will be a disciple of chirst must take up his cross and follow him in his wayes as he walked in he must not turn back to fetch any to carry along with him for if he do he will endanger the being shut forth of the neither may he be freed from many encounters with the perverse enemy of all mankind but must take up his cross and march forward thorow persecutions and afflictions and crosses in this life and the more he seeketh to serve his master the more he will be had in disdain not that any can tax him with injustice either to god or men but wherever christ hath a church the devil will be labouring to lay one stone or other you may go on a great way and build a very fair tabernacle with moral stones and have the love of men and not the hatred of the devil but if you come to understand your task what it is that you are to build be sure he will seek to torment you and make your wages as uncomfortable as he can he will have a cain to persecute abel and a ishmael for isaac and an esau for jacob and ten brethren against joseph and whole cities and nations against the prophets and apostles nay he would not leave christ unattempted
so that as said before if you will enter into this company to be one of their society you must not think it too much to be a false prophet in others esteem but as all your fore runners have done count it your joy that you do not deserve it at their hands what though you are counted a magician with moses and daniel or a worshipper of a contrary thing with the most part of the prophets or a changer of customs and a prophane person or a or a mad man or a breaker of the sabbath with christ and his apostles account it your joy to bear the reproach of these things but be sure to keep your selves free from deserving any of them but approve your selves to be his friends by doing what he hath commanded you and then let the world rage and the devil spit his venemous poyson how he please god will provide you that that will expel it

and whenever you are brought to that maturity of knowledge as to experience the love of god as it is in christ jesus you will not sell your for all the seeming preferments and advancements that any unrighteous tempter shall seek to betray you withal look to the branch and you will most commonly find what it is that nourisheth the root if it be nourished by any inward spring or grow by the river side it will flourish although the showres of rain do not

come so frequently as they were used to do for he that knowes not how to suffer with him never knew how to rejoice with him and he that is his knowes how to do both
but let not any one mistake me herein and think that conclude that every one that suffers must suffer for christ
must confess hardly did ever read that any moralist could suffer for what he did maintain or seek to maintain if he could any wayes prevent his suffering but in case he could not avoid suffering any man will rather chuse that in which he hath had most experience as a phylosopher for his phylosophy and a marshallist for his adventures in war but happy is he that can lay down his life as freely as keep it upon the account of his lord and master in due respect to his honour and glory and not for or
many know will be harping at these expressions but let them know that as do not conclude the scriptures to be void of reason so also conclude that it is beyond the moral reason of men to find out the depths of the scripture

and as concerning war must count it is a thing in fashion in our dayes and for me to seek to alter this fashion shall lye liable to the censures of men yet let the scriptures be true and have that respect to them that you should have

and then let me be what you please shall be brief in this particular at this time onely refer you to those words of christ that he left with his disciples mat the
and
verses put up thy sword again into his place for all they that take the sword shall perish with the sword thinkest thou that cannot now pray to my father and he shall give me more than legions of angels but how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled that thus it must be and cor
for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalteth it self against the knowledge of god this is beyond the work of a moral sword and epkes

endeavouring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bonds of peace and james
from whence comes wars and fighting amongst you come they not hence even of your lusts that war in your members ye lust and have not ye kill and desire to have and cannot obtain ye fight and war yet ye have not because ye ask not ye ask and receive not because you ask amiss that ye might consume it upon your lusts he that is a friend of the world is an enemy to god and as you read in the first book of the chronicles
and
but god said unto me thou shalt not build a house for my name because thou hast been a man of

war and hast shed blood so that if that temple of god could not be builded by blood that was but a type of the true temple surely the true temple cannot be builded with blood or war but in peace it is not that egypt is righteous enough to build the temple of the lord though they may be made a scourge to edom as nebuchadnezzar was to israel will not accuse a defensive sword because have seen that the manifestations of god are not all of them made known to any one man but cannot find that any disciple of christ should use a morral sword as he is a disciple of christ or a builder of the true temple for he that is a builder of the true temple ought not to take revenge against his enemies but commit his cause to the lord to whom vengeance belongs and therefore christ bids us to forgive our enemies least we should seek vengeance where god seeks none for we are apt to condemn where god justifies and to set our selves upon his seat where is any of gods messagers but have received this censure from the men of their times therefore lest we should be liable to this failing christ warns us not to judge our brethren lest we be judged for to his own master he standeth or falleth nay we are forbid to judge according to what it appears to us john
judge not according to appearance but judge righteous

judgement and no man can judge by appearance in many things but he will doubt whether he judgeth right or not therefore as we cannot measure gods love let us forbear judging our selves to be better than others lest we undervalue christs sufferings
but as concerning an offensive war find not any grounds in scripture for it and if any man can shew me any scripture for it since the death of the testator at which time the testament was of force shall not take it ill at his hands for have not so learned christ as to flatter any one job
he that speaketh flattery to his friend the eyes of his children shall fail prov
open rebuke is better than secret love faithful are the wounds of a friend but the kisses of an enemy are deceitful
but some one may object why did not christ bid the souldiers lay down their armes that came to ask him what they should do he did not disencourage them in their undertaking but bids them do violence to no man and be content with their wages

answer that any man that is a perfect performer of this part of his duty may give a just account of his actions but you must observe that he that advises them to that commanded also that they should love their enemies and bless them that curse them pray for them that despitefully

use them mat
so shall you approve your selves children of your father which is in heaven

but suppose that christ did never advise any of his disciples to go to war with the worst of their enemies nor to fight for a kingdom of this world but rather suffrr by the men of this world if one must be and as for his advise to the souldiers suppose it was rather that they should not break their engagements in what they were engaged in as in respect to their governours or their loyalty to their promise rather than his owning of the war to be according to the will of god for those for whom they fought were such as christ doth condemn to be meer worldlings and therefore how could their cause be good and yet he would not advise them to break their engagements but to act truth that those whom he had spoke against for doing of injustice might not have any thing to accuse him of neither in advise nor action for what difference is there between the righteous and the wicked but onely in their actions as in respect of their honouring or dishonouring of god it is a very vain thing for any one to think they are spiritually righteous when they are not morally just for how can any man spirituallize himself and not use morality for whatever is manifested to be acted between man and man is external

in respect of decayableness and noncontinuance therefore god expects that as you have received a talent of righteousness and truth so you should act truth and deal justly with all men and not to boast of a talent of truth and righteousness when you act contrary and do not improve it but abuse the true use of it for god is better pleased in the just demeanour toward men than with thousands of sacrifices by your pretences in religion even as that is instanced of the children of israel in the time of joshuah as you may read joshuah
they could not kill the gibeonites because they had made a promise that they would not destroy them although the lord had commanded to destroy all those people and places shewing them the danger of making a league with them as you may read deuteronomy the
oh how would many in our dayes swallow such an oath and never think themselves hardly the worse for so doing should such a thing extend to their own ends in any one particular these people might have pleaded that they could not disobey the commands of the lord who had commanded them to destroy both young and old and that they entered into oath with them upon no other account but as being a people that lived at a distance from the place which god had given them and that it would be a great danger of their

sons marrying with their daughters and their daughters with the gibeonites and so intice them to follow other gods therefore being forewarned by the lord they would prevent the worst being it was upon a spiritual account as indeed it would have seemed with many of our most zealous professors but the princes of israel say they may not do it for they had entered into covenant with them to let them live therefore they would not become but would make a covenant to be a covenant in deed as well as in words will endeavour to shew you reasons why the princes of israel would not break this covenant when the people did earnestly desire it

first in respect they had not broken the command of god willingly or knowingly and in case they should break this league with the gibeonites they should offend against him in both for that god that is the god that bid them keep those covenants and commands bids them also act truth and lye not one to another that they may demonstrate to all people that they worship a god of order and a god that will not lye therefore seeing that they could not keep both but that they were circumvented in one they would be as exact as they could in the other many look at what god sayes in one respect but not at others it had been good if israel had not

entered into league with them to the contrary to have destroyed them but seeing they had though it was upon an account as they thought of strangers nay they asked them if they did not live amongst them and they said no they came from a far countrey
fear very few professors in our time would be so exact in their carriage for the praise of their master

secondly they knew they should very much dishonour their god in not confiding that he was able to keep their sons and their daughters from believing or worshipping the gods of the heathen if they should marry one with the other it would seem a very dishonourable part for israel when they had engaged to gibeon to break their covenant for fear the gibeonites should draw them or their sons or daughters from worshipping that god whom they served it must needs argue that they give evident witness that their god is not strong enough to encounter with the god of the heathens and that is the way to worship a god that is not but in case thou art engaged find no scripture grounds that you should ever falsifie your word for others being worse than you for that is the way to make thy self worse than they whereas if gibeon live with israel who knoweth but israel may convert gibeon however israel will be israel so long

as they keep in this mind it was the opinion of an antient heathen that no man could be spiritually good if he was not morally just and his reason was that the spiritual god was a god of order
but some one may object suppose that those that have engaged to should give me any just occasion to break my covenant they being as deeply engaged as was it is they that became and not hope may freely break mine without wronging my conscience at all

answer it is one thing to be found an offender in the sight or judgement of men or their customary institutions and another to be found an offender in the last day before the just judge of heaven earth the laws of men it may be may clear thee and so thou canst not be said to be an offender of them but if thou approvest thy self not to be guilty of refusing the advice of christ and his apostles thou must look further than what the lawes of men do intimate in some things the lawes of nations are differing many kingdoms allow that which others condemn but god is one intire being and his law the one edifying truth which teacheth us not to render evil for evil contrariwise but good suppose you are but engaged conditionally even as by indenture where there are obligations laid upon both sides and thy partner breaks his part

of the obligation thou canst not but account it evil in him and wilt thou commit the same evil by breaking thy part when thou condemnest the same thing in another christ adviseth us that if any man compel us to go with him a mise to go two and if any man strike thee on the one cheek turn to him the other thou shalt not answer for this offence but for thy own
and must confess it is my opinion that no one can with any safety break their engagements for the time they stood engaged at first though you may receive great in juries by the other parties default the apostle peter doth plainly intimate as much in his first epistle
chapter
verses for this is thank worthy if a man for conscience toward god endure grief suffering wrongfully for what glory is it if when you are buffeted for your faults ye take it patiently but if when you do well and suffer for it ye take it patiently this is acceptable with god the apostle doth not advise the servant to break his covenant to his master because the master doth break his but rather suffer what punishment the master shall inflict upon him yea herein is a believers joy that he is accounted worthy to suffer for maintaining the truth in any one particular for all are not called to suffer in one manner or way though flesh and blood may not seem satisfied with it by reason

of the present anguish of spirit for no affliction seems joyous for the present but grievous yet after ward it yieldeth the pleasant fruit of righteousnes heb
so that though it may seem to terrifie thy outward man yet thy inward man will be strengthened the which ought to be rather nourished than neglected and though it may seem to prove disadvantagious to thee in this life yet here will be thy joy that thou hast obeyed the truth and canst look death in the face with great boldness by thy exactness in thy word to all men even as david speaks in psalm
concerning those that shall be inhabitants in zion amongst which one thing that is found needful is to keep his word though he sweareth to his hurt yet he changeth not revenge belongeth to the lord if you receive any wrong commit your cause to him and do not seek any revenge upon any man but let not any seek to circumvent me in this my description put a difference between the people of god promising and a people that are in darkness but speak of them that engage when they are in the tuition of the lord or at least wayes own themselves so to be and a difference between the promises of the law or under the law as they were understood and the promises under the gospel for under the law any man might put away his wife onely giving her a bill of devorcement but christ tells us

that it is adultery to do it in the gospel and causeth them to commit adultery also that are put away in that nature so it is not every thing that is customary with men that is justifiable in the sight of god

israel had experienced that god did make it his desire to keep those engagements that he had made to them as it is often mentioned in the scriptures though they had broken their engagements as to their particular and general failings yet god was so tender least he should break his part as that he doth as it were stand and meditate before he will any wayes insist upon any urgent or austere punishment and doth often invite them to return and review their wayes and turn to repentance for their that he may have mercy on them and defer his anger god is just and merciful and it cannot be said of him that he did ever break any engagement to any person or people for as his promises have been to his people many times but conditionally

for as he engageth to be a god and a defender to them if they will keep his laws and observe and do his commands so likewise he often engageth that if they will not keep his law or perform their part that he will punish them and leave them to their own wills and their own desires and let them go on in their own filthiness until they have fulfilled the desires of their own wayes and then he will take the rod and scourge them so as said before in this parricular god is as just

in performing this part of his covenant as he was in performing the other by reason of the entailment of truth that did force him to it but in respect to those promises that are made absolute he is so exact in keeping them where there is no entailment to the contrary as that he will keep his word though a people do offend him and vex his holy spirit as is instanced by his promise to abraham isaac and jacob in relation to his causing their seed to inherit the land of canaan and although his people did oftentimes offend and vex his holy spirit yet nevertheless he being a god of truth he would not be moved so far as to make his promise null and void of effect


as he had promised that he would render up the onely beloved of his delight his son christ jesus to the mercies of wicked men even to do after the imaginations of their own hearts with him so far as concerned life to their appearance so he did fulfil it to the full although they had denied to own him in his intercessions for a condiscention of love and unity yea they did not own him to be their god they would have none of him nor none of his instructions but did beat his messengers and imprison and kill his prophets and shewed him all the unhumane respect that possibly could be and did him all the dishonour that lay in their power yet nevertheless god had promised that he would provide an acceptable sacrifice for the seed of abraham a lamb without blemish or spot and though the people were never so

wicked and unhumane and breakers of all the ordinances laws and commands that he had given them to observe and do yet he could do no lesse than perform his promise otherwayes how could it be said that he was a god of truth so as it is plainly understood that god hath been compelled by truth many times to bestow his gracious favours and mercies upon his people when they have deserved a curse and oftentimes though it might with true acknowledgment and obedience become a blessing to them that receive it so it proves to those that are obstinately bent even a curse by their not prizing of it as they ought to do even as christ was to judas and several other of the jews

besides the israelites durst not break their promise with gibeon for fear of dishonouring their god and provoking him to anger by making him odious in the fight of the heathen who do hold of this judgement that if they do once promise a thing their gods will afflict them if they do not effect it and should israel act below the heathen the very heathen would condemn their god of injustice as indeed it was jacobs answer to his sons simeon and levi ye have troubled me to make me stink before the inhabitants of the land and being few in number the canaanites and the perizites will gather themselves together and slay me and all my houshold as you may read at large in the chapter of genesis and the verse jacob accounted it a greater offence for simeon

and levy to break their covenant than to let their sister remain with hamor as indeed seeing she had been the occasion on the one part of working the defame in israel even so they had made israel to stink before the nations on the other side and so consequently the god of israel
and if you do but mark in the following chapter you shall find that god doth take notice of it in the first verse god calls to jacob to go up to bethel and dwell there if you do but turn to the chapter of this book you shall find what jacob did promise in bethel whether he is commanded to return that is to his promise in bethel that if god would bring him safe to his fathers house he should be his god now god had performed his promise but jacob had failed in his in that his sons had broken their covenant with shechem and hamer
object
well but what doth god call jacob to go to bethel or to his promise in bethel to do answ
it was to take notice that he had broke his promise and therefore he commands jacob to build an altar there for he would not answer him on that altar el elosie israel or in the breaking of the covenant but in bethel or his owning of him to be his god and therefore jacobs first work is to cleanse and purge his house of idols as you may read in the chapter and to bury them in shechem before he could go up to bethel and tells his family that they must change their garments and be clean and then arise and go to build an altar

in bethel and seek the lord that answered him in his distress and by that means a terrour did strike into the hearts of the neighbouring cities that they journed safely

secondly israel had purchased gods displeasure not long before this engagement was made with the gibeonites as is instanced in the chapter of joshuah and the verse israel hath sinned saith the lord in breaking their covenant which commanded them they have also stolen and have put it amongst their own stuff and therefore they could not stand before their enemies so you may see plainly that god is very exact to have israel keep his law and commandments and had they not entered into covenant with the gibeonites to let them live they durst not have preserved any of their lives but seeing they had engaged to do it though it was unknown to them of their living in that place god was pleased better with it than if they had broke their covenant and gibeon is not the last in process of time that laid their helping hand to build the temple of the lord in judah as you have in the third chapter of nehemiah and the verse which shews that god was well pleased with israel for their keeping their covenant in accepting of the gibeonites into his favour for israels sake whereas achan offending against him when there was no obligation to urge him to it he will not be friends with him nor with israel till they have destroyed him but israel must fall before the men of aie yea and those that have not offended with

polluting themselves in the forbidden inticements therefore it is not that men do fall before their enemies alwayes for the sins that they commit themselves but for the pollutions of others israel is said to sin in that one had sinned even achan and god would suffer even of the israelites to dye before the men of aie and the rest to flee for achans offence therefore would entreat every man whatever that professeth himself to be a christian to take heed of offending god in this or any other thing for be sure if god do not take up a controversie against us for our backsliding yet we may be the occasion of his fury against others that are more innocent than we for god will not be friends with israel till the babylonish garment be burned and achan stoned

look to it as well as you please you know your pay will be according to your work need not tell you that there are more babylonish garments than one and sear some that profess high notions have clothed themselves with them from the crown of the head to the sole of the foot onely wearing a religious cloak over it to deceive men look well to your selves and let not your own hearts condemn you before god and before will not condemn you but speak my mind plainly because there is too too many that heal your wound too slightly even as the prophet jeremiah complains in the chapter of his prophesie and the verse they have healed the hurt of my daughter slightly crying peace peace when there

is no peace so it hath plainly appeared in our time that we have pretended to a great measure of light in religion but where is the man that cryed we are all fell short but rather accounting that the judgement that is fallen upon thee england belonged to rome and the beast accounting of christs reign in person and not minding to set up his power in our hearts just as the children of israel did account themselves happier in the land of canaan whilst they were in the wildernesse than they did in the pleasure of god by which they were to enjoy it and so fell to murmering and repining at gods dealing with them according to his pleasure therefore he slew that generation of men and would not suffer them to enter into the land at all so may say of thee england that hast had more discourse of the throwing down of babylon than thou hast had zeal to the god that should throw babylon down into the bottomlesse pit if pretences could have done it must confess thou mightest have gone a great way in it but you sought to cleanse onely the outside and did not furbish the inside to answer it it would be a very small satisfaction to thee to have christ reigne a thousand years upon the earth and to begin his reign before he hath been lifted up in thy heart therefore first seek the kingdom of god and the righteousness thereof and then sure all other things shall be added unto you and do not think to dwell with the father unless ye eat the flesh of the son and if ye eat the flesh of the son ye shall live

by him even as he liveth by the father john
therefore do not think of satisfying your selves with any thing below him but be sure to eat that which the scriptures doth manifest to be in him thus wishing the one almighty and infinite being to direct both you and that we may not look at things as they appear customary but as they are in reality and truth that we may believe in him that is our peace by adding vertue to our faith and to vertue knowledge and to knowledg temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity and if these things be in you and abound you will neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of jesus christ pet
for so is the will of god that with you might put to silence the ignorance of foolish men as free and not using your liberty for a cloak of malitiousness but as the servants of god pet
and if you have so learned christ as observe and do these things that you are invited to you need not fear what man can do unto you but you will get into a stronger harbour take your repose and wait till you hear the voice of the bridegroom crying come my people enter thou into thy chamber and shut thy doors about thee hide thy self as it were for a little moment until the indignation be esay
finis

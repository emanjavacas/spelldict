In which Sett the highest part singeth the Church tune.
Published for the recreation of such as delight in Musicke: By W. Swayne Gent.
TO THE RIGHT HONOrable, Sir VVilliam Cecill Knight, Baron of Burghley, Lord high Treasorer of England.
William Swayne wisheth long life, and the same to be most healthie and happie.
RIght Honorable my singuler good Lord, there came to my hands of late a booke conteyning all the tunes of the Psalmes, as they are ordinarilie soung in the Church, composed into foure parts by M. William Damon late one of hir Maiesties seruaunts, which booke being found not onely in my poore opinion, but in the riper iudgement of some speciall Musicions to be excellentlie sette, either to serue for voices or instruments: for the great vse that might come thereof, and partlie to preserue the labours of the Auctor, so worthie and skillfull a man in his profession: also to leaue his Religion and pietie herein witnessed, that so carefullie and speciallie laboured to aduaunce the vse of singing the Psalmes: was earnestlie dealt with all not to deteyne that as a part of my priuate store in Musicke, that of it selfe conteyned matter so worthie publiquelie to enterteyne and to receiue enterteynment.
Therefore with their perswasions and reasons, was brought to publish them for the vse and comfort of all, especially of the godlie.
And now right honorable my verie good Lord, calling to minde the dutie, honor, and seruice due by mee vnto your good Lordship, for the great loue and fauour which haue alwaies receiued at your L. hands.
(For acknowledge my selfe to none more bound then to your honor:) haue beene the more emboldened to present this simple worke to passe vnder your L. fauour and protection.
Wishing that the same may chieflie serue to the glorie praise of God.
And then at your L. pleasure, at some times for the recreation of your minde, after your worthie and great trauayle from day to day taken in the most weightie affaires of this commonwealth.
And so commend your good L. to the mercifull keping of thalmightie God.
HEretofore gentle Reader, M. William Damon one of her Maiesties Musitions, being earnestly requested by a friend of his did at sundry times when he resorted to his friends house compose the tunes of Dauids Psalms as they are ordinarily soung in the Church note for note, intending the~ for his friends priuate vse.
These Psalmes so set, made without labour or purpose to publish them, were notwithstanding published by the same friend of M. Damon; which not answering thexpectation that many had of the Auctors skill, gaue him occasion to take vppon him a new labour to recouer the wrong his friend did in publishing that that was so done, as might well please him, but was not purposed or framed for the learned eares of our times.
Therefore at his best leisure fittest times he composed the same tunes againe in so excellent a manner that by comparison of these and the former, the Reader may by triall see that the Auctor could not receiue in his Art such a note of disgrace by his friends ouersight before, but that now the same is taken away, and his worthie knowledge much more graced by this second trauaile.
Now to acquaynt thee with the Auctors order in this second woorke, he hath for varietie gone through the Psalmes twice, which are now deuided into two Setts: whereof in the former the ordinarie singing part is caried in the Tenor: In the second set it is conueyed in the highest part.
Herein ther is required of the Reader, if he be a louer of Musick, that he would accept of their labour that haue taken paines in publishing exactlie a worke of such singuler skill, and speciall vse for them, that after the serious labour of their calling are desirous rather to recreate them selues in singing of Psalmes, then in other exercises of lesse comfort, and euill marke.

an elegy upon the most lamented death of the right reverend dr john cauden late lord bishop of worcester who deceased on friday september

in worcester

now deaths decrees seem'd to be out of date but mark the spleen of unregarded fate no learned funerall had infam'd the year nor was the state yet pensiv'd with a tear the throng of coarses bid us only see and transiently view mortality but this most sorrowed herse commands us weep and grief as his memoriall keep and in the swollen confluents of our eyes loves universall tribute to comprize

here shall the different opinions meet and their divided streams each other greet here shall the murmuring floods in grief conform and their sad passions raise without a storm while to the ocean of his fame they run not minding whence their rivulets begun for in this ceremony all unite and joyne devotions in his funerall rite mixing their sighs and prayers in concent and tax the parcae not the parliament

but let us parentate who know to mourn the churches sorrow in this prelates urn
and is our father our restorer dead who'l peace begin or mediate in his stead on whose blest lips gasping realms did wait and from his oracle did receive their fate he hath resign'd the life he onely breath'd the use to us was long before bequeath'd

he that the perplext discords of our peace with his harmonious unison did cease

he that the gangreen of the state did cure

first made it willing able then endure open'd the splendour of the dawning day and like the baptist first prepar'd the way him orpheus galen prayers could not save nor free the captive from the conquering grave time was obliged twas in vain to sue blest restitution thy first fruits were due
for th heavenly powers when they held their hand and crost their arms at rebels bold command when the defencelesse sword had lost it's edge against that scaly monster priviledge when its continuall renascent strength gainst single loyalty prevail'd at length proud with this champion did the host defie conviction's greater far then victory and having prov'd him to the wisht event withdrew the hero to his heavenly tent

adieu great chrysostome our danaan showrs shall ever water thy sepulchrall flowr's so heaven plants thee in a diocesse by thy translation to eternall blisse

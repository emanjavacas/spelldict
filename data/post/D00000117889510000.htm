to the reader
tho some of these speeches were printed some years since and generally received by all sorts of people with great concern but being in loose sheets they are not so well preserved therefore have thought fit to collect them together that so they may be often reviewed and that the present and future may with abhorrency behold the iniquity of the late violent times when so many excellent persons were destroyed by forms and subtilties of law and scribere est agere was brought in for an evidence as in the case of col sydney when no other could be found
and whereas the business of the plot has been received by some as an article of faith and a smooth history of it has been imposed on the nation therefore thought good to add colonel rumbald speech to undeceive the world by which it is evident if we may believe the dying words of a good man that was a meer to bring an odium on protestants

it has been always the practice of the papists to make to render protestants odious and to hide

the foulness of their own real plots of which this nation has had sufficient experience especially in their late damnable plot
for when it was clearly proved on them that they conspired against the life of the late king and our government they presently contrived to cast that wickedness on protestants and too many of our easie were impos'd on to believeit
but through the goodness of god and the auspicious arrival of the prince of orange the eyes of the nation are opened and now we hope we have an opportunity to be delivered if our sins prevent not from the plots and tyranny of the church of rome which god in his infinite mercy grant

amen

the speech and carriage of stephen colledge at oxford before the the castle on wednesday august
taken exactly from his own mouth at the place of execution

mr
mr colledge it is desired for the satisfaction of the world because you have profest your self a protestant that you would tell what judgment you are of

colledge
dear people dear protestants and dear countrymen have been accused and convicted for treason the laws adjudg me to this death and come hither willingly to submit to it pray god forgive all those persons that had any hand in it
do declare to you whatever hath been said of me was never a papist or ever that way inclin{us}d they have done me wrong was ever a protestant was born a protestant have lived so and so by the grace of god will die of the church of england according to the best reformation of the church from all idolatry from all superstition or any thing that is contrary to the gospel of our blessed lord and saviour

do declare was never in any popish service prayers or devotions in my life save one time about some or years ago as near as remember was out of a curiosity one afternoon at st james chappel the queen's chappel at st james except that one time never did hear any popish service any thing of the church of rome mass or prayers or any thing else private or publick
know you expect that should say something as to what die for it

hath been charged upon me when was apprehended brought before the council some of the council the secretary and my lord killingworth and mr seymour they told me there was treason sworn against me truly they surprized me when they said so
for of all things in the world thought my self as free from that as any man
asked them if any man living had the confidence to swear treason against me they said several three or four as remember then they told me it was sworn against me that had a design to pull the king out of and to serve him as his father was served or to that purpose the his father or that kind of language did deny it then and do now deny it upon my death
never was in any manner of plot in my days neither one way nor another never knew any such persons nor ever had such communication with any man hitherto know of no plot in the world but the popish plot and that every man may know as much as if had had such a design as these men have sworn against me to have seized his majesty either at london or this place at oxford take god to witness as am a dying man and upon the terms of my salvation know not any one man upon the face of the earth that would have stood by me and how likely it was that should do such a thing my self let the whole world judg

dugdale swears that spoke treason to him treasonable words in the and in the by the angel he could not pretend to see me any where else but it is false and a very unlikely thing that should speak treason to him
must confess was in his company at the and that before went out of town but there could be no communication between us for he was writing at one end of the room and eating a piece of bread and lighted a pipe of tobacco at the other end and took it till sir tho
player and sir rob
clayton came to me and we went to my lord lovelace out of town that night so when they came we took horse and went out of town with the rest for my part can't sum up my witnesses was under most strange circumstances as ever any man was was kept prisoner so close in the tower that could have no conversation with any though was certain the popish lords had it every

day there but could have none could not tell the witnesses that were to swear against me could not tell what it was they swore against me for could have no copy of the indictment nor no way possible to make any preparation to make my defence as ought to have done and might have done by law

had no liberty to do any thing as am as dying man
and as to what dugdale smith turbervill and heins swore against me they did swear such treason that nothing but a mad man would ever have trusted any body with and least of all to papists every one of them that had been concerned with plots and treasons among their own party and under the greatest ties and obligations of damnation and to be sainted if they kept it secret and to be damned if they did reveal it
if these men will not keep things private for their own party how could trust them take god to witness and do freely acknowledg have sought my god with tears several times to inform me if so be had with any word transgrest at any time
knew not of any part of what they swore against me till such time as heard it sworn against me at the bar

this is very hard gentlemen but this is the truth and there be a great many other strange reports that have heard since have been a prisoner that should be a means to convert the countess of rochester by bringing one thompson a priest to her
truly all that was concerned in was some or years ago
lodged at colonel vernon that married the lady brooks the family were papists the brookses were papists and there was this thomson and did suppose him a priest in the house though never saw him at popish service or worship though was there half a year but coming afterwards to my lord rochester's about some business had to do for him and several other persons of quality he sent for me one afternoon from the parsonage in adderbury to his house and his lady and he stood together he sent to me and asked me if my horse were at home said he would have you carry this letter to mr thompson if you are at lessure this afternoon my lord am at leisure to serve you so took a letter from his hand and his ladies too as remember he made an offer that way sealed with his own seal

and carried it to thompson and delivered it to him and he old me that he would wait upon my lord for it was for some lands my lord did offer to raise mony for some occasion this is the truth of that scandal

it is said that had a priest several years in my house viz
sergeant that came over from holland to discover
about some ten years ago that very same man came to me but was a stranger to me and he came to me by the name of doctor smith a physician and there was an apothecary in the and a within ludgate that came with him they brought him thither and took a chamber and lay about half a year or three quarters at times by the name of doctor smith and as a physician this is the truth of that and no otherwise
this is the entertainment of sergeant
so the occasion of my coming to oxford do say was voluntary the last parliament at westminester and several lords dined together the day before they sat the last sessions of parliament at westminister they sent for me to the sun tavern behind the exchange and when came the duke of monmouth and several lords were together and believe above of the commons the duke of monmouth called me to him and told me he had heard a good report of me and that was an honest man and one that may be trusted and they did not know but their enemies the papists might have some design to serve them as they did in king jame time by or any other way and the duke with several lords and commons did desire me to use my utmost skill in searching all places suspected by them which did perform and from thence had as think the popular name of the protestant joiner because they had intrusted me before any man in england to do that office

this same heines one of them that swore against me had discovered to me and several others as to macknamarra and his brother and this ivey who are now all of another stamp that the parliament was to be destroyed at oxford and that there was a design to murder my shaftsbury by fitzgerald and his party and that they did endeavour to bring macknamarra over to him and said then it would be well with him and they would not be long before they had shaftsbury's life and

he made depositions of this to sir george treby as heard afterwards for was not with him when it was sworn
wish the commons of england as well as wish my own heart and did not understand but when served the parliament served his majesty too and let them be miserable that make the difference between them for my part never did
came to oxford with my lord howard whom look upon to be a very honest worthy gentlemen my clare my paget and my huntington and this captain brown and don lewis were in my company and came along with us as they were my lord howard friends brown have known believe two or three months but lewis never saw before that day they said they came with my lord howard
take god to witness never had one or any thing else to carry on any design and if it were to save my life now cannot charge any man in the world with any design against the government as god is my witness or against his majesty or any other person

as for what arms had and what arms others had they were for our own defence in case the papists should make any attempt upon us by way of massacre or any invasion or rebellion that we should be ready to defend our selves god is my witness this is all know
if this be a plot this was in but in no other but never knew of any numbers or times appointed for meeting but we have said one to another that the papists had a design against the protestants when we did meet as was a man of general conversation and in case they should rise we were ready but then they should begin the attempt upon us this was my business and is the business of every good subject that loves the laws of his country and his king
for england can never hope to be happy under those men whose religion is blood and murder which do with all my soul and did ever since knew what religion was abhor and detest viz the church of rome as pernicious and destructive to humane societies and all government

beseech god that every man of you may unite together as protestants against this common foe
gentlemen it is my sense and do in that believe am as certainly murdered by

the hands of the papists as sir edm
bury godfrey himself was though the thing is not seen
these witnesses certainly are mercenary men and beseech god almighty to have mercy upon their souls and forgive them and either by his judgments or mercies reclaim them that they shed no more innocent blood there is not a man of them that know of that ever heard me say or do any bit of treason in my life
this is the first may not say it is but almost the twentieth that they have endeavoured to put upon the nation to delude the people and put off their own damnable plot
this is not the first but think the sixteenth or seventeenth pray god that my blood may be the last
pray god defend every man's blood and all protestants in england from the hands of these bloody papists by whose means die this death and if they shall go on in this nature hope the good god will open every man's eyes to see it before he feels it
and beseech you if you have any love for your king your country and the protestants unite together if you are protestants
pray god those that deserve the name let them be called how they will either dissenters or church of england men that they may unite together like men like christians against the common foe who will spare neither the one side nor the other but beat you one against another like two pitchers the last that stands they will certainly destroy if they can
this is my sense and god is my witness speak my conscience do not know mr sheriff whether there be any thing else have to say or no we have a good god and beseech every man that hears me this day for we live in a sinful age good people and it behoves every one of you it cannot be long before all that look upon me in this condition must lie down in the dust and god knows must come into an eternal state either for mercy or for judgment
beseech you in the name of god he is a god of mercy and a god of patience and that you would break off your sins by repentance and serve a good god who must be your friend at last or else you are lost to eternity

lord how ungrateful wretches are we that have a god of such infinite mercy and goodness that affords us our life our health and a thousand mercies every day and we like

ungrateful people not deserving the name of men or christians live riotous lives in debauchery and swearing in malice and the lord knows how many evils
beseech god that may be this day a means in the hand of god to bring some of their souls over to him beseech you remember what say indeed do not know have been so strangely used since have been a prisoner what to say being brought from one affliction to another that my body is worn out and my memory and intellects have failed me much to what they were
cannot remember what have to say more but that the lord jesus christ would bless my country and preserve it from popery and in mercy bless his majesty good god be merciful to him make him an instrument in thy hand to defend his protestant subjects lord in mercy defend him from his enemies
good god bless this people good lord continue the gospel of jesus christ thy gospel in its purity to us and our posterity as long as the sun and moon endure
lord save all that call upon thee be merciful to all thy servants all thy people that put their trust in thee good lord deliver them from the hand of their enemies good god let their lives and bodies and souls be all precious in thy sight
put a stop to these most wicked conspiracies of thy enemies and the nation's enemies the papists
let no more protestant blood be shed but this of mine beseech thee my god
lord look upon me lord bless me good god receive me into thy blessed presence by jesus christ my alone saviour and redeemer in whom alone put my trust for salvation it is thee god that trust in thou righteous judg of heaven and earth all popery all pardons all popes and priests all dispensations disown and will not go out of the world with a lie in my mouth
from the sincerity of my heart declare again that what have said to you is the very sentiments of my soul as god shall have mercy· upon me and to the best of my knowledg

desire the prayers of you good people while am here and once more beseech you to think upon eternity every one of you that hear me this day
the lord turn your hearts and souls if you have been wicked livers if you do live wicked lives the lord in mercy convert you and shew you

your danger for as little thought to come to this as any man that hears me this day and bless god have no more deserved it from the hands of men than the child that sucks at his mothers breast bless my god for it and do say have been a sinner against my god and he hath learn'd me grace ever since have been a prisoner
bless my god for a prison bless my god for afflictions bless my god that ever was restrained for never knew my self till he had taken me out of the world
therefore you that have your liberties and time and precious opportunities be up and be doing for god and for your souls every one of you

to his son
where is my dear child

mr sheriff
made one request to you and you gave me an imperfect answer you said you were of the best reform church in the world the church of england according to the best reformation in the world desire you for the satisfaction of the world to declare what church that is whether presbyterian or independent or the church of england or what

colledge

good mr sheriff for your satisfaction for twenty years and above was under the presbyterian ministry till his majesty's restauration then was conformable to the church of england when that was restored and so continued till such time as saw persecution upon the dissenting people and very undue things done to their then went among them to know what kind of people those were and do take god to witness since that time have used their meetings viz the presbyterians others very seldom and the church of england
did hear dr tillotson not above three weeks before was taken
heard the church of england as frequently as heard the dissenters and never had any prejudice god is my witness against either but always heartily desired that they might unite and be lovers and friends and had no prejudice against any man and truly am afraid that it is not for the nation's good that there should be such between them that some of

the church of england will preach that the presbyterians are worse than the papists
god doth know that what say speak freely from my heart have found many among them truly serving god and so have of all the rest that have come into my company men without any manner of design but to serve god serve his majesty and keep their liberties and properties men that am certain are not of vicious lives found no dammers or those kind of people among them or at least few of them

to his son kissing him several times with great passion
dear child farewel the lord have mercy upon thee
good people let me have your prayers to god almighty to receive my soul
and then he prayed and as soon as he had done spake as followeth the lord have mercy upon my enemies and beseech you good people who ever you are and the whole world that have offended to forgive me whom ever have offended in word or deed ask every mans pardon and forgive the world with all my soul all the injuries have received and beseech god almighty forgive those poor wretches who have cast away their souls or at least endangered them to ruine this body of mine beseech god that they may have a sight of their sins and that they may find mercy at his hands let my blood speak the justice of my cause
have done and god have mercy upon you all
to mr crosthwait
pray sir my service to dr hall and dr reynall and thank them for all their kindnesses to me thank you sir for your kindness the lord bless you all
mr sheriff god be with you god be with you all good people
the executioner ketch desired his pardon· and he said do forgive you
the lord have mercy on my soul

the speech of the late lord russel to the sheriffs together with the paper delivered by him to them at the place of execution on july


mr sheriff

expected the noise would be such that could not be very well heard was never fond of much speaking much less now therefore have set down in this paper all that think fit to leave behind me
god knows how far was always from designs against the king's person or of altering the government and still pray for the preservation of both and of the protestant religion
am told that captain walcot has said some things concerning my knowledg of the plot know not whether the report is true or not hope it is not for to my knowledg never saw him or spake with him in my whole life and in the words of a dying man profess know of no plot either against the king's life or the government
but have now done with this world and am going to a better
forgive all the world and thank god die in charity with all men and wish all sincere protestants may love one another and not make way for popery by their animosities

the paper deliver'd to the sheriffs
thank god find my self so composed and prepared for death and my thoughts so fixed on another world that hope in god am now quite weaned from setting my heart on this
yet cannot forbear spending some time now in setting down in writing a fuller account of my condition to be left behind me than i'll venture to say at the place of execution in the noise and clutter that is like to be there
bless god heartily for those many blessings which he in his infinite mercy has bestowed upon me through the whole course of my life that was born of worthy good parents and had the advantages of a religious education which have often thank'd god very heartily for and look'd upon as an invaluable blessing for even when minded it least it still hung about me and gave me checks and has now for many years so influenced and possessed me that feel the happy effects of it in this my extremity in which have been so wonderfully thank god supported that neither my imprisonmenr nor the fear of death have been able to discompose me to any degree but on the contrary have found the assurances of the love and mercy of god in and through my blessed redeemer in whom only trust and do not question but that am going to partake of that fulness of joy which is in his presence the hopes whereof does so wonderfully delight me that reckon this as the happiest time of my life tho others may look upon it as the saddest
have lived and now die of the reformed religion a true and sincere protestant and in the communion of the church of england tho could never yet comply with or rise up to all the heights of many people
wish with all my soul all our unhappy differences were removed and that all sincere protestants would so far consider the danger of popery as to lay aside their heats and agree against the common enemy and that the churchmen would be less severe and the dissenters less scrupulous for think bitterness and persecution are at all times bad but much more now

for popery look on it as an idolatrous and bloody religion and therefore thought my self bound in my station to do all could against it
and by that foresaw should procure such great enemies to my self and so powerful ones that have been now for some time expecting the worst
and blessed be god fall by

the ax and not by the fiery tryal
yet whatever apprehensions had of popery and of my own severe and heavy share was like to have under it when it should prevail never had a thought of doing any thing against it basely or inhumanly but what could well consist with the christian religion and the laws and liberties of this kingdom
and thank god have examin'd all my actings in that matter with so great care that can appeal to god almighty who knows my heart that went on sincerely without being moved either by passion or
have always loved my country much more than my life and never had any design of changing the government which value and look upon as one of the best governments in the world and would always have been ready to venture my life for the preserving of it and would have suffered any extremity rather than have consented to any design to take away the king's life neither man the impudence to propose so base and barbarous a thing to me
and look upon it as a very unhappy and uneasy part of my present condition that in my indictment there should be so much as mention of so vile a fact tho nothing in the least was said to prove any such matter but the contrary by the lord howard neither does any body am consident believe the least of it
so that need not think say more

for the king do sincerely pray for him and wish well to him and to the nation that they may be happy in one another that he may be indeed the defender of the faith that the protestant religion and the peace and safety of the kingdom may be preserved and flourish under his government and that he in his person may be happy both here and hereafter

as for the share had in the prosecution of the popish plot take god to witness that proceeded in it in the sincerity of my heart being then really convinced as am still that there was a conspiracy against the king the nation and the protestant religion and likewise profess that never knew any thing either directly or indirectly of any practice with the witnesses which look upon as so horrid a thing that could never have endured it
for thank god falshood and cruelty were never in my nature but always the farthest from it imaginable
did believe and do still that popery is breaking in upon the nation and that those who advance it will stop at nothing to carry on their design am heartily sorry that so many protestants give their helping hand

to it
but hope god will preserve the protestant religion and this nation though am afraid it will fall under very great tryals and very sharp sufferings
and indeed the impiety and profaneness that abounds and appears so scandalously gives to just reason to fear the worst things which can befall a people
pray god prevent it and give those who have shewn concern for the publick good and who have appear'd hearty for the true interest of the nation and the protestant religion grace to live so that they may not cast a reproach on that which they endeavour to advance which god knows has often given me many sad thoughts
and hope such of my friends as may think they are touch'd by this will not take what say in ill part but endeavour to amend their ways and live suitable to the rules of the true reformed religion which is the only thing can administer true comfort at the latter end and revive a man when he comes to die

as for my present condition bless god have no repining in my heart at it
know for my sins have deserved much worse at the hands of god so that chearfully submit to so small a punishment as the being taken off a few years sooner and the being made a spectacle to the world
do freely forgive all the world particularly those concerned in taking away my life and desire and conjure my friends to think of no revenge but to submit to the holy will of god into whose hands resign my self entirely

but to look back a little cannot but give some touch about the bill of exclusion and shew the reasons of my appearing in that business which in short is this that thought the nation was in such danger of popery and that the expectation of a popish successor as have said in parliament put the king's life likewise in such danger that saw no way so effectual to secure both as such a bill
as to the limitations which were proposed if they were sincerely offered and had pass'd into a law the duke then would have been excluded from the power of a king and the government quite altered and little more than the name of a king left
so could not see either sin or fault in the one when all people were willing to admit of the other but thought it better to have a king with his prerogative and the nation easie and safe under him than a king without it which must have bred perpetual jealousies and a continual struggle
all this say only to justifie my self and not to enflame others though cannot but think my earnestness in that matter has had no small influence in my present sufferings

but have now done with this world and am going to a kingdom which cannot be moved

and as to the conspiring to seize the guards which is the crime for which am condemned and which was made a constructive treason for taking away the king's life to bring it within the statute of edward the
shall give this true and clear account
never was at mr shepheard with that company but once and there was no undertaking then of securing or seizing the guards nor none appointed to view or examine them some discourse there was of the feasibleness of it and several times by accident in general discourse elsewhere have heard it mention'd as a thing might easily be done but never consented to as fit to be done
and remember particularly at my lord shaftsbury there being some general discourse of this kind immediately flew out and exclaim'd against it and ask'd if the thing succeeded what must be done next but massacring the guards and killing them in cold blood which lookt upon as so detestable a thing and so like a popish practice that could not but abhor it
and at the same time the duke of monmouth took me by the hand and told me very kindly my lord see you and are of a temper did you ever hear so horrid a thing and must needs do him that justice to declare that never observed in him but an abhorrence to all base things
as to my going to mr shepheard went with an intent to taste sherry for he had promised to reserve for me the next very good piece he met with when went out of town and if he recollects he may remember ask'd him about it and he went and fetch'd a bottle but when tasted it said twas hot in the mouth and desired that whenever he met with a choice piece he would keep it for me which he promised
enlarge the more upon this because sir george gefferies insinuated to the jury as if had made a story about going thither but never said that was the only reason
and will now truly and plainly add the rest

was the day before this meeting come to town for two or three days as had done once or twice before having a very near and dear relation lying in a very languishing and desperate condition and the duke of monmouth came to me and told me he was extremely glad was come to town for my lord shaftsbury and son hot men would undo us all how so my lord said i· why answered he they'll certainly do some disorderly thing

other if great care be not taken and therefore for god's sake use your endeavours with your friends to prevent any thing of this kind
he told me there would be company at mr shepheard that night and desired me to be at home in the evening and he would call me which he did and when came into the room saw mr rumsey by the chimney though he swears he came in after and there were things said by some with much more heat than judgment which did sufficiently disapprove and yet for these things stand condemned
but thank god my part was sincere and well meant
it is know inferred from hence and was pressed to me that was acquainted with these heats and ill designs and did not discover them
but this is but misprision of treason at most
so die innocent of the crime stand condemn'd for and hope no body will imagine that so mean a thought could enter into me as to go about to save my self by accusing others
the part that some have acted lately of that kind has not been such as to invite me to love life at such a rate

as for the sentence of death passed upon me cannot but think it a very hard one
for nothing was sworn against me whether true or false will not now examine but some discourses about making some stirs
and this is not levying war against the king which is treason by the statute of edward the third and not the consulting and discoursing about it which was all that was witnessed against me
but by a a strange fetch the design of seizing the guards was construed a design of killing the king and so was in that cast

and now have truly and sincerely told what my part was in that which cannot be more than a bare misprison and yet am condemned as guilty of a design of killing the king
pray god lay not this to the charge neither of the king's counsel nor judges nor sheriffs nor jury and for the witnesses pity them and with them well
shall not reckon up the particulars wherein they did me wrong had rather their own consciences should do that to which and the mercies of god leave them
only still averr that what said of my not hearing col rumsey deliver any message from my lord shaftsbury was true for always detested lying though never so much to my advantage
and hope none will be so unjust and uncharitable as to think would venture on it in these· my last words for which am so soon to give an account to

the great god the searcher of hearts and judge of all things

from the time of chusing sheriffs concluded the heat in that matter would produce something of this kind and am not much surprized to find it fall upon me
and wish what is done to me may put a stop and satiate some peoples revenge and that no more innocent blood be shed for must and do still look upon mine as such since know was guilty of no treason and therefore would not betray my innocence by flight of which do not thank god yet repent though much pressed to it how fatal soever it may have seem'd to have proved to me for look upon my death in this manner thank god with other eyes than the world does
know said but little at the trial and suppose it looks more like innocence than guilt
was also advis'd not to confess matter of fact plainly since that must certainly have brought me within the guilt of misprision
and being thus restrained from dealing franky and openly chose rather to say little than to depart from that ingenuity that by the grace of god had carried along with me in the former part of my life and so could easier be silent and leave the whole matter to the conscience of the jury than to make the last and solemnest part of my life so different from the course of it as the using little tricks and evasions must have been
nor did ever pretend to a great readiness in speaking wish those gentlemen of the law who have it would make more conscience in the use of it and not run men down and by strains and fetches impose on easie and willing juries to the ruine of innocent men for to kill by forms and subtilties of law is the worst sort of murther
but wish the rage of hot men and the partialities of juries may be stopp'd with my blood which would offer up with so much the more joy if thought should be the last were to suffer in such a way

since my sentence have had but few thoughts but preparatory ones for death yet the importunity of my friends and particularly of the best and dearest wife in the world prevailed with me to sign petitions and make an address for my life to which was very averse
for thank god though in all respects have lived one of the happiest and contented'st men of the world for now very near fourteen years yet am so willing to leave all that it was not without difficulty that did any thing for the saving of my life that was begging
but was willing to let my friends see what power they had over me and that was not obstinate nor

sullen but would do any thing that an honest man could do for their satisfaction
which was the only motive that sway'd or had any weight with me

and now to sum up all as never had any design against the king's life or the life of any man whatsoever so never was in any contrivance of altering the government
what the heats wickedness passions and vanities of other men have occasioned ought not to be answerable for nor could repress them though now suffer for them
but the will of the lord be done into whose hands commend my spirit and trust that thou most merciful father hast forgiven me all my transgressions the sins of my youth and all the errors of my life and that thou wilt not lay my secret sins and ignorances to my charges but wilt graciously support me during that small part of my time now before me and assist me in my last moments and not leave me then to be disorder'd by fear or any other temptation but make the light of thy countenance to shine upon me for thou art my sun and my shield and as thou supportest me by thy grace so hope thou wilt hereafter crown me with glory and receive me into the fellowship of angels and saints in that blessed inheritance purchased for me by my most merciful redeemer who is trust at thy preparing a place for me and is ready to receive me into whose hands commend my spirit

the very copy of a paper delivered to the sheriffs upon the scaffold on on friday december

by algernon sidney esq before his execution there

men brethren and fathers friends countrymen and strangers

it may be expected that should now say some great matters unto you but the rigour of the season and the infirmities of my age encreased by a close imprisonment of above five months doth not permit me
moreover we live in an age that maketh truth pass for treason dare not say contrary unto it and the ears of those that are about me will probably be found too tender to hear it
my tryal and condemnation doth sufficiently evidence this
west rumsey and keyling who were brought to prove the plot said no more of me than that they knew me not and some others equally known unto me had used my name and that of some others to give a little reputation unto their designs
the lord howard is too infamous by his life and the many perjuries not to be denied or rather sworn by himself to deserve mention and being a single witness would be of no value though he had been of unblemished credit or had not seen and confessed that the crimes committed by him would be pardoned only for committing more and even the pardon promised could not be obtained till the drudgery of swearing was over

this being laid aside the whole matter is reduced to the papers said to be found in my closet by the king's officers without any

other proof of their being written by me than what is taken from the suppositions upon the similitude of an hand that is easily counterfeited and which hath been lately declared in the lady car's case to be no lawful evidence in criminal causes

but if had been seen to write them the matter would not be much altered
they plainly appear to relate unto a large treatise written long since in answer to filmer's book which by all intelligent men is thought to be grounded upon wicked principles equally pernicious unto magistrates and people
if he might publish unto the world his opinion that all men are born under a necessity derived from the laws of god and nature to submit unto an absolute kingly government which could be restrained by no law or oath and that he that hath the power whether he came unto it by creation election inheritance usurpation or any other way had the right and none must oppose his will but the persons and estates of his subjects must be indispensably subject unto it
know not why might not have published my opinion to the contrary without the breach of any law have yet known
might as freely as he publickly have declared my thoughts and the reasons upon which they were grounded and persuaded to believe that god had left nations unto the liberty of setting up such governments as best pleased themselves
that magistrates were set up for the good of nations not nations for the honour or glory of magistrates
that the right and power of magistrates in every country was that which the laws of that country made it to be
that those laws were to be observed and the oaths taken by them having the force of a contract between magistrate and people could not be violated without danger of dissolving the whole fabrick
that usurpation could give no right and the most dangerous of all enemies unto kings were they who raising their power to an exorbitant height allowed unto usurpers all the rights belonging unto it
that such usurpations being seldom compassed without the slaughter of the reigning person or family the worst of all villanies was thereby rewarded with the most glorious privileges

that if such doctrines were received they would stir up men to the destruction of princes with more violence then all the

passions that have hitherto raged in the hearts of the most unruly

that none could be safe if such a reward were proposed unto any that could destroy them
that few would be so gentle as to spare even the best if by their destruction of a wild usurper could become god's anointed and by the most execrable wickedness invest himself with that divine character
this is the scope of the whole treatise the writer gives such reasons as at present did occur unto him to prove it
this seems to agree with the doctrines of the most reverenced authors of all times nations and religions
the best and wisest kings have ever acknowledged it
the present king of france hath declared that kings have that happy want of power that they can do nothing contrary unto the laws of their country and grounds his quarrel with the king of spain anno upon that principle
king james in his speech to the parliament anno doth in the highest degree assert it the scripture seems to declare it
if nevertheless the writer was mistaken he might have been refuted by law reason and scripture and no man for such matters was ever otherwise punished than by being made to see his errour and it hath not as think been ever known that they had been referred to the judgment of a jury composed of men utterly unable to comprehend them
but there was little of this in my case the extravagance of my prosecutors goes higher the treatise was never finished nor could be in many years and most probably would never have been
so much as is of it was written long since never reviewed nor shewn unto any man and the fiftieth part of it was produced and not the tenth of that afford to be read
that which was never known unto those who are said to have conspired with me was said to be intended to stir up the people in prosecution of the designs of those conspirators
when nothing of particular application unto time place or person could be found in it as hath ever been done by those who endeavour'd to raise insurrections all was supplied by innuendo's
whatsoever is said of the expulsion of tarquin the insurrection against nero the slaughter of caligula or domitian the translation of the crown of france from merovins his race unto pepin and from his descendants unto hugh capet and the like applied by innuendo unto the king

they have not considered that if such acts of state be not good there is not a king in the world that has any title to the crown he bears nor can have any unless he could deduce his pedigree from the eldest son of noah and shew that the succession had still continued in the eldest of the eldest line and been so deduced to him

every one may see what advantage this would be to all the kings of the world and whether that failing it were not better for them to acknowledg they had received their crowns by the consent of willing nations or to have no better title unto them than usurpation and violence which by the same ways may be taken from them
but was long since told that must die or the plot must die
lest the means of destroying the best protestants in england should fail the bench must be filled with such as had been blemishes to the bar
none but such as these would have advised with the king's council of the means of bringing a man to death suffered a jury to be packed by the king's solicitors and the admit of who are not freeholders receive such evidence as is refuse a copy of an indictment or to suffer the statute of
ed to be read that doth expresly enact it should in no case be denied unto any man upon any occasion whatsoever the most important points of law without hearing
and whereas the stat
ed
upon which they said should be tried doth reserve unto the parliament all constructions to be made in points of treason
they could assume unto themselves not only a power to make constructions but such constructions as neither agree with law reason or common sense

by these means am brought to this place
the lord forgive these practices and avert the evils that threaten the nation from them
the lord sanctify these my sufferings unto me and tho fall as a sacrifice unto idols suffer not idolatry to be established in this land
bless thy people and save them
defend thy own cause and defend those that defend it
stir up such as are faint direct those that are willing confirm those that waver give wisdom and integrity unto all
order all things so as may most redound unto thine own glory
grant that may die glorifying thee for all thy mercies and that at the last thou hast permitted me to be singled out as a witness

of thy truth and even by the confession of my opposers for that old cause in which was from my youth engaged and for which thou hast often and wonderfully declared thy self

the last speech of col richard rumbold at the of edinburgh with several things that passed at his tryal june

about eleven of the clock he was brought from the castle of edinburgh to the justices court in a great chair on mens shoulders where at first he was asked some questions most of which he answer'd with silence at last said he humbly conceived it was not necessary for him to add to his own accusation since he was not ignorant they had enough already to do his business and therefore he did not design to fret his conscience at that time with answering questions
after which his libel being read the court proceeded in usual manner first asking him if he had any thing to say for himself before the jury closed his answer was he owned it all saving that part of having designed the king's death and desired all present to believe the words of a dying man he never directly nor indirectly intended such a villany that he abhorred the very thoughts of it and that he blessed god he had that reputation in the world that he knew none that had the impudence to ask him the question and he detested the thoughts of such an action and he hoped all good people would believe him which was the only way he had to clear himself and he was sure that this truth should be one day made manifest to all men
he was again asked if he had any exception against the jury he answered no but wished them to do as god and their consciences directed them
then they withdrew and returned their verdict in half an hour and

brought him in guilty
the sentence followed for him to be taken from that place to the next room and from thence to be drawn on a hurdle betwixt two and four of the clock to the cross of edinburgh the place of execution and there to be hang'd drawn and quartered
he received his sentenc with an undaunted courage and chearfulness
afterwards he was delivered into the hands they brought to him two of their divines and offered him their assistance upon the scaffold which he altogether refused telling them that if they had any good wishes for him he desired they would spend them in their own closets and leave him now to seek god in his own way
he had several offers of the same kind by others which he put off in like manner
he was most serious and fervent in prayers the few hours he lived as the sentinels observed who were present all the while
the hour being come he was brought to the place of execution where he saluted the people on all sides of the scaffold and after having refreshed himself with a cordial out of his pocket he was supported by two men while he spoke to the people in these words

gentlemen and brethren it is for all men that come into the world once to die and after death to judgment and since death is a debt that all of us must pay it is but a matter of small moment what way it be done and seeing the lord is pleased in this manner to take me to himself confess something hard to flesh and blood yet blessed be his name who hath made me not only willing but thankful for his honouring me to lay down the life he gave for his name in which were every hair in this head and beard of mine a life should joyfully sacrifice them for it as do this and providence having brought me hither thick it most necessary to clear my self of some aspersions laid on my name and first that should have had so horrid an intention of destroying the king and his brother
here he repeated what he had said before to the justices on this subject
it was also laid to my charge that was antimonarchical

it was ever my thoughts that kingly government was the best of all justly executed mean such as by our ancient laws that is a king and a legal free chosen parliament
the king having as conceive power enough to make him great the people also as much property as to make them happy they being as it were contracted to one another
and who will deny me that this was not the just constituted government of our nation how absurd is it then for

men of sense to maintain that though the one party of this contract breaketh all conditions the other should be obliged to perform their part no this error is contrary to the law of god the law of nations and the law of reason
but as pride hath been the bait the devil hath catched most by ever since the creation so it continues to this day with us
pride caused our first parents to fall from the blessed estate wherein they were created they aiming to be higher and wiser than god allowed which brought an everlasting curse on them and their posterity
it was pride caused god to drown the old world
and it was nimrod's pride in building babel that caused that heavy curse of division of tongues to be spread among us as it is at this day
one of the greatest afflictions the church of god groaneth under that there should be so many divisions during their pilgrimage here but this is their comfort that the day draweth near whereas there is but one shepheard there shall be but one sheepfold
it was therefore in the defence of this party in their just rights and liberties against popery and slavery

at which words they beat the drums to which he said they need not trouble themselves for he should say no more of his mind on that subject since they were so disingenuous as to interrupt a dying man only to assure the people he adhered to the true protestant religion detesting the erroneous opinions of many that called themselves so and die this day in the defence of the ancient laws and liberties of these nations and though god for reasons best known to himself hath not seen it sit to honour us as to make us the instruments for the deliverance of his people yet as have lived so die in the faith that he will speedily arise for the deliverance of his church and people
and desire all of you to prepare for this with speed
may say this is a deluded generation vail'd with ignorance that though popery and slavery be riding in upon them do not perceive it though am sure there was no man born marked of god above another for none comes into the world with a saddle on his back neither any booted and spurr'd to ride to him not but that am well satisfied that god hate wisely ordered different stations for men in the world as have already said kings having as much power as to make them great and the people as much property as to make them happy
and to conclude shall only add my wishes for the salvation of all men who were created for that end

after ending these words he prayed most fervently near three quarters of an hour freely forgiving all men even his greatest enemies begging most earnestly for the deliverance of sion from all her persecutors particularly praying for london edinburgh and dublin from which the streams run that rule god's people in these three nations

being asked some hours before his execution if he thought not his sentence dreadful he answered he wished he had a limb for every town in christendom

the last speech of madam lisle beheaded at winchester in september

gentlemen friends and neighbours

it may be expected that should say something at my death my birth and education being near this place
my parents instructed me in the fear of god and now die of the reformed religion always being instructed in that belief that if popery should return into this nation it would be a great judgment
die in expectation of pardon of my sins and acceptation with the father by the imputed righteousness of jesus christ he being the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth
thank god through christ jesus depart under the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of abel god having made this chastisement an ordinance to my soul
did as little expect to come to this place on occasion as any person in this nation therefore let all learn not to be but fear
the lord is a sovereign and will take what way he seeth best to glorifie himself by his poor creatures therefore humbly desire to submit to his will praying of him that in patience may possess my soul

the crime was my entertaining a minister which is since sworn to have been in the duke of monmouth army
am told if had not denied them it would not have affected me have no excuse but surprize and fear which believe my jury must make use of to excuse their verdict to the world
have been told that the court ought to be counsel for the prisoner instead of advice there was evidence given from thence which though it was but might possibly affect my jury
my defence was such as might be expected from a weak woman but such as it was never heard it repeated again to the jury

but forgive all persons that have wronged me and desire that god will do so likewise
forgive col penruddock although he told me he could have taken those men before they came to my house
as to what may be expected for my conviction that gave it under my hand that discours'd with nelthrop that could be no evidence to the court or jury it being after my conviction and sentence
acknowledge his majesty's favour in revoking my sentence and pray god he may long reign in mercy as well as justice and that he may reign in peace and that the true religion may flourish under him
two things have omitted to say which is that forgive him that desired to be taken from the grand jury and put upon the petty jury that he might be the more nearly concerned in my death
and return humble thanks to god and the reverend clergy that assisted me in my imprisonment

some passages of henry cornish esq before his sufferings

coming into the and seeing the halter in the officers hand he said is this for me the officer answer'd yes he replied blessed be god and kissed it and after said blessed be god for newgate have enjoyed god ever since came within these walls and blessed be god who hath made me fit to die
am now going to that god that will not be mocked to that god that will not be imposed upon to that god that knows the innocency of his poor creature
and a little after he said never did any poor creature come unto god with greater confidence in his mercy and assurance of acceptation with him through jesus christ than do but it is through jesus christ for there is no other way of coming to god but by him to find acceptance with him there is no other name given under heaven whereby we can be saved but the name of jesus
then speaking to the officers he said labour every one of you to be fit to die was not fit to die my self till came in hither but blessed be god he hath made me fit to die and hath made we willing to die in a few moments shall have the fruition of the blessed jesus and that not for a day but for ever am going to the kingdom of god where shall enjoy the presence of god the father and of god the son and of god the holy spirit and of all the holy angels am going to the general assembly of the and of the spirits of just men made perfect that god should ever do so much for me that god should concern himself so much for the good of poor creatures for their salvation blessed be his name for this was the design of god from all eternity to give his only son to die for poor miserable sinners
then the officers going to tye his hands he said

what must be tyed then well a brown thred might have served the turn you

need not tye me at all shall not stir from you for thank god am not afraid to die
as he was going out he said farewel newgate farewel all my here the lord comfort you the lord be with you all

the substance of alderman cornish's speech at the place of execution octob


taken by one of his servants

am come here this day condemned to die but god is my witness the crimes laid to my charge were falsely and maliciously sworn against me by the witnesses for never was at any consult nor any meeting where matters against the government were discours'd of never heard nor read any declaration nor ever acted wilfully any thing against the government
confess through the justice of god my private sins have brought me to this infamous end yea it were just with god not only to deprive me eternally of his presence but to condemn me to eternal torments but through christ hope to be eternally blessed yet as to the crimes for which suffer on the words of a dying man am altogether innocent
bless god was from my younger years brought up in and have for some years continued a protestant in the communion of the church of england in which communion now die have often partaken in the ordinances the blessed effects and comfort thereof now feel in this my agony
bless god was born under a government in the constitution of which did ever acquiesce and in which was once a member at which time did according to the best of my here be was interrupted by the sheriff
bless god was born in a land of light where the gospel hath been preach'd in power and purity he might have brought me forth in a land of darkness and ignorance but blessed be god for jesus then he intreated the sheriff to intercede with his majesty to be kind to his poor wife and children the sheriff promised him to wait on his majesty the next day about it
he replied mr sheriff thank you the lord reward you a the lord put it into the hearts of you to be kind to the widdows and fatherless it is your duty the

lord put it into the hearts of all good people to pray for me

more could not be taken by reason of the noise of the people and interruption of one of the sheriffs

the speech of captain walcot on friday the of july
this great concourse of people do not only come here to see me die but also to hear what shall say and because would not be reproached and thought to be an atheist when am gone have two or three words to speak for my religion
do believe in three persons and one god and expect and hope to be saved by the merits and righteousness of his son christ jesus without the hope of an advantage by any merits or righteousness of my own
and believe that the scriptures of the old and new testament are the word of god that they were not written according to the will of man but holy men of god writ them as they were inspired by the holy ghost

believe that these scriptures ought to be the rule of our faith and the method of our worshipping of god believe that as christ is the head of his church so he is their
that it is not in the power of any council or conclave of cardinals or any power upon earth whatsoever to set up the precepts and traditions of men and to make them of equal validity with the word of god
believe it was not because the jews rejected and crucified christ that he rejected them but because they rejected his word which appears by the three thousand that god by one sermon of peter converted they being prickt in their hearts and touched in their consciences cried out men and brethren what shall we do and they were that day added to the church
it was certainly because the jews rejected the word and gospel of christ that the things were hid from their eyes which belonged to their peace
it is a dreadful thing to reject the word of god and it is a dreadful thing to live in a sinful course of life till god withdraws his

spirit from us for it is said it shall not always strive with man
death is the wages of sin
believe had not adam sinned he and we his posterity had not died
death is said to be the king of terrours but it is only so to those that are terrified with a terrifying conscience that have the arrows of the almighty sticking in them from convictions of great guilt and see no hopes of mercy have no assurance of pardon but those that are christ's he takes away the terrour and horrour and sting of death he enables them to say with paul to me to live is christ and to die is gain he enables not only to get unto christ but into christ and so they have communion and fellowship with the father and the son
it is no hard matter to get the notions of the promises of the gospel into our heads but unless the lord is pleased to apply them to our hearts we cannot believe except we be in christ as branches in the vine we are not christians indeed
it was the case of poor francis spira he was certainly a knowing man but notwithstanding he had not faith to apply the promises
christ hath said that he that believes in him though he were dead yet shall he live and he that lives and believes in him shall never die
so if we be able to apply the promises by the spirit of god we may have comfort through faith but then faith is the gift of god and faith comes by hearing the word of god and receiving it in the love of god

shall not be tedious mr sheriff shall be very short

mr sheriff
take your own time

walcot

as to the present occasion of my death do neither blame the judges nor the jury nor the king's counsel only blame some men that in reality and in truth were deeper concerned and more engaged than that came in as witnesses against me who swore me out of my life to save their own and who for fear they should not do it effectually contrived that that will appeal to you all whether there be a probability in it or not for they said made it a scruple of conscience to have a hand in killing the king or to imbrue my hands in his blood but was so generous as to undertake the charging his guards whilst others did it and to the end another might do it
truly will appeal to all that know me whether they believe me so much an ideot that should not understand it was the same thing to engage the king's guards whilst another killed him as to kill him with my own hands
but however by their swearing against me they have secured their

own lives and estares and made my blood the price of theirs
confess was so unfortunate and unhappy as to be invited by collonel rumsey one of the witnesses against me to some meetings where some things were discoursed of in order to the asserting our liberties and properties which we looked upon to be violated and invaded
but it was he and mr and some gentlemen that are fled who were the great promoters of those meetings
was near a quarter of a year ill of the gout and during that time mr often visited me and still his discourse would be concerning lopping the two sparks that was the word he used meaning the king and the duke and proposed it might be done at a play this was his frequent discourse for he said then they would die in their calling it was his very expression
he bought arms to do it with without any direction of mine never saw the arms nor never saw the men that were to do it though they said they had fifty imployed to that end
told several of them that the killing the king would carry such a blemish and stain with it as would descend to posterity that had eight children that was loth should be blemished with it and withal was confident the duke of monmouth would revenge his fathers blood if it were but to vindicate himself from having any hand in it

and now desire to forgive all the world from the very bottom of my heart and pray god of his mercy from my heart to forgive them even mr shepherd who delivered me up who promised to carry me into holland but instead of that he brought me into the condition wherein now am
do desire with all my heart to forgive the witnesses and withal do earnestly beg that they may be observed that some remarks may be set upon them whether their end be peace and that they die the common death of all men
certainly though it be the law of the land ought to die and the king may justly and reasonably put me to death for being in those meetings where a war was debated yet think these men are guilty of my blood that were as deep in as and have betrayed me and taken it away
then in the next place beg leave mr sheriff to speak one short word of advice to my friends that hath been often given to me though was not so fortunate and so happy as to take it and that is that they would neither hear any man speak nor speak themselves that which they would not have repeated for there is no such thing as faith in man to man whatever there is in man to god either the tears of a

wife or a family of little helpless children something or other will tempt and provoke men to betray one another
when god hath a work to do he will not want instruments for he can make them nor will he want a way to do it for he can contrive it and bring it to pass
and do most heartily desire and my earnest prayer to the almighty is that this may be the last blood spilt upon this account
know acts of indulgence and mercy in the king would make him much easier in his government and would make his people sit much easier under it and that the lord may encline his heart to mercy ought to be the prayer of every good man
what hath happened and what hath been the present occasion of our calamity suppose every man knows what provocations have been on the one hand fears and necessities jealousies and sufferings of the other will not intermeddle with resolving to use my utmost endeavour to make that peace and reconciliation with my god which is impossible for me to make with man and to make it my hearty prayer to the great god before whom am in a little time to appear that he would stench this issue of blood and find out some other way to preserve these kingdoms in unity and peace to the honour and glory of his great name and the eternal comfort of his people

one word mr sheriff desire to speak as to ireland because the king prest it hard upon me and several people have been with me about ireland how far ireland was concerned in this matter
do aver here as in the presence of god before whom am now going to appear that do not know an englishman nor protestant in ireland engaged in it
what did know was only of one scotish gentleman in the north and the king knows it but he says he does not believe it
for they that were concerned was never in any of their councils never saw any of those lords but the duke of monmouth and that was believe above six months ago
never saw nor spoke with one lord only my lord howard
have not more to say mr sheriff but truly you will do an act of a great deal of charity if you will prevail with the king for an act of indulgence and liberty to his people think so and so the lord have mercy upon me

lord help us lord put to thy helping hand lord teach us truly to leave no sin unrepented of in any one of our hearts

lord stand by and support them let their ways be

found so pleasing and acceptable unto thee that thou may'st think it reasonable to make all their enemies at peace
lord
interest them in thy love and do thou favour them with thy mercies and lovingkindnesses
lord we also beseech thee in the behalf of these poor kingdoms wherein we are that thou wilt he merciful to them prevent divisions among them heal all their breaches compose their differences make all that are thine of one heart and mind in the things of thee our god
and lord if it be thy will do thou rule in the heart of the king that he may rule and reign for thee and for the good of thy church and people
lord favour us with thy mercy assure us of thy love stand by us in the difficult hour take us into thine own care cause thy angels to attend us to convey our souls as soon as they are divided from our bodies into abraham bosom into the paradise of our god
and lord we beg that thou wilt be with us with thy extraordinary presence helping us to trust in thee doing for us beyond what our narrow hearts are able to ask or think
all which we beg for the sake of thy son jesus christ in whom lord this little time do thou give us hearts to give thee all glory honour and praise now and for evermore amen
sweet jesus

amen

to the reader

courteous reader for preventing mistakes giue me leaue to aduertise thee that in many passages of this book beside the running title haue vsed the word preiudice in a sense not very vsuall in english make it answere to the french word preiug√® which my author vseth not for an ill preconceit as wee commonly take it but for such a plausible appearance as before due examination bee a probable ground for any preconceit of a thing either good or bad
so antiquitie is a preiudice for the papists and against vs because that before a iudicious examination it is a probable ground for common braines to conceiue well of their religion and to mistrust ours
secondly haue not beene so superstitious in expressing my authors word as haue obserued some translators

to be haue not construed but translated keeping as neere as could an euen course between a pedant a paraphrast for when the originall is not to be learned by the translation tbink it not only lawfull but also conuenient to make vse of that liberty
the neglect of it take to be the reason why commonly translations are thought to tast flat in respect of the originall
shall not wonder if some slipps haue escaped mee seeing a man may be as absurdly ouer seene by too much animaduersion as by none and which is the misery of the most circumspect diligence a man may dote as much by gazing through a thing as by staring beside it yet hope there are none so grosse as that they may abuse either my author or his reader

farwell

an examination of the prejudices of those of the romish church against those of the reformed religion

that passion blindeth the iudgement of man and hindreth it from assenting to the truth

it's a matter worthy astonishment that not onely vulgar braines but even the most eminent wits should suffer themselues to be so easily wonne by the of lies to beare armes against the truth
albeit the spirit of man the more excellent a temper it is of the more naturall and eager an appetite it hath after the knowledge of the by the same instinct loathing ignorance and especially disdaining to be cheated
so

that even the most artificiall flatterers insteed of humoring it would offend it if it once conceiued it selfe to be but flattered as on the contrary if it once compleatly apprehended the truth it would stoope to it how harsh and bitter soever it were
so hard is it but that the compleat representation the inside of a lye will offend vs and that of the truth affect vs

but the cause of our mischiefe is the perversenesse of our passions which oftentimes so and distemper the heart that out of it as it were exhaling thick and black vapours vpon the vnderstanding they either disturb our iudgements or altogether dull our apprehensions
neither deale they so well with vs as those piercing smoakes which bereauing man of his bodily sight yet leaue him still this vncomfortable priviledge that as he seeth nothing so he cannot bee gull'd by any lying apparitions
whereas when a heart chafed with passion hath dimmed yea extinguished the light of the vnderstanding yet that takes not from it a presumptuous conceit of its owne cleere sight and reall comprehension of the truth
whence it commeth to passe that man compassed about with thick darknesse confidently dreameth that he walketh in the sunne shine and is strongly conceited that he hath then fast hold of the truth when he huggeth an absurd ridiculous fable
this corruption is almost vniversall and like to a generall distemper of all the humours in the body it's dispersed into all the passages of mans life
in a word it's the epidemicall disease of our soules which maketh vs easily induced to beleeue all that for true which we desire should be so as being more

sutable to our dispositions and convenient for the accomplishment and execution of our desires and designes
vpon this we invent vnto our selues probabilities and readily entertaine such as are presented vnto vs to make vs beleeue that matters are so as passion willeth vs to conceiue them as on the contrary that which we desire should be false as thwarting our aymes crossing and encumbring our enterprises by the like naturall flattery of our selues we perswade our selues that it is false indeed or suffer our selues to be easily so perswaded by another

the first veine of this corruption may be espied even in the infancy of man
children are cheered and delighted if one tell them that the tale which pleaseth them is true and they willingly beleeue it how strange and fabulous soever it otherwise seeme vnto them co~trariwise they are vexed and discouraged if one plainely tell the that it was fained only for pleasure it will be a hard matter to stick this impression into them
so naturally familiar is the power which passion hath to darken and blindfold the vnderstanding

after the same manner whosoever loueth with a fit of passion he will descry many shewes of arguments to encourage his affection in the discourse of him who extolleth that vpon which he doteth
and as he desireth that that which he loueth bee beholding it through this clowd he vieweth it in a shape and colour farre different from the naturall
parents curb'd by civility from an outward expression of their indiscreet affection yet in themselues giue the lye to those who freely tell them

the truth of their children for it being a iust cause of extreame griefe vnto vs to be the parents of vntoward children so is it hardly beleeued by vs so long as there remaineth any probability of the better contrary
he who is desirous to enter into a will conceiue a pretious esteeme of weake and frivolous counsell which perswadeth him that his cause is good contrariwise he will disesteeme and bee much displeased with the solidereasons of a sage counseller who out of the goodnesse both of his conscience and skill certifieth him of the weaknesse of his cause and disswadeth him from entring into law
all this proceedeth from this passion which entangleth his vnderstanding and hindreth it from a steedy view of those cozening semblances from an impartiall examination of them and from comparing of them with the truth
even so some one sick of an ignominious disease against all other physitians he will willingly approue of him who shall iudge him to be sicke indeed but of an honest disease
imprinting according to his desire this false conceit into his minde vnder the superscription of truth for so a lye is never approued of but masked with the looks of its opposite
yea our owne passions varnish it over or at least hinder vs from tearing of its vaile for feare least we beholding it with a narrow eye stripped of the borrowed face of truth should be affrighted by its vglinesse

chap
ii
that this imperfection of iudgement proceeding from passion is discouered principally in the cause of religion
it may be that in the civill part of mans life where if the worst come to the worst it toucheth but the temporall good this affected winking of the vnderstanding is not altogether hurtfull
but in religion it fareth otherwise the danger here is dreadful and the losse beyond recovery when all here is embarked and carried away the body the soule not to be no more which would be at least a forlorne kinde of happinesse but to be everlastingly miserable which is the wofull complement of all vnhappinesse

and yet for all that this mischieuous quality hath so encroached vpon our nature and insinuated it selfe into such good footing that it's never more domineering and peremptory then when the question is concerning religion the salvation of the soule and the worship which god requireth of vs

the poore indians so long as they are shewed braue ensigne or curious picture because the imbroderie and painting ravish the sense and man is naturally idolatrous runne to them like birds to the fowlers crye even to adore them as if they enshrined some deity
but otherwise let tell them of their errours of the errours of their they will demand

as did the prince of

frisland what is become of their progenitors and friends formerly dead in their errours and if one answere them that they are in hell they will reply that they will goe thither also secretly giuing vs to vnderstand that there is no likelyhood they should be there the loue which they beare towards them maketh them mistake this sad truth for a lye because it implieth the condemnation of those whom nature or acquaintance hath most indeared to them

if by reasons so sensible that meere sense might comprehend them it be strongly endeauored to make the folly of the turkish religion visible vnto a turke all this while the sunne is but shewed to a beetle the turke sees not a whit not as if that had impaired his senses but it being an irksome businesse to acknowledge the horrid absurdities of his superstition his passions grow furious either besot his vnderstanding or divert it from a discontenting speculation of such a truth which being assented to would force him to pronounce sentence of condemnation vpon his his sultan his friends and kindred
this is so torturing a griefe vnto him that nature will not suffer him to beleeue it and so it remaineth as incredible vnto him as it is vnpleasant vnlesse god worke aboue nature

let vs accuse the obstinate iewes of blasphemy by testimonies of scripture wee shall stop their mouths we shall convince them but yet for all that not convert them

an inconsiderate zeale without knowledge as the apostle hath obserued it

a superstitious reverence of the traditions of their fathers

a sottish doting vpon their owne righteousnesse

a desire of the restauration of their state of their restablishment in the land of promise

overspread their eyes as it were with a vaile so that they cannot behold the glory of god in the face of christ

who nullifieth their traditions

teareth from them the false covert of righteousnesse

who confoundeth their hope of an earthly kingdome and prosperity

who frustrateth their expectation of a king a messias triumphing in secular pompe

who bindeth them to the taking vp of his crosse

presenting himselfe to them crucified

and in his crosse the shame horrour of the rebellion of their ancestors

all this is thus and more harsh to the naturall apprehension of the iew and therefore hee is no lesse blockish and backward to beleeue it
in as much as he considereth not neither alloweth the true full poise to those meanes whereby this truth should be proued vnto him
it is then from his passion that this his

affected voluntary and in consequence malicious ignorance proceedeth

chap
iii
that the vnderstanding troubled by the affections of the heart alwaies findeth pretences to make it selfe beleeue that which it desireth should be true

it is not so for all this that this ignorance wanteth colour which giueth it at least the aspect and complexion of a true knowledge insomuch that it deceiueth him

who hath it and oftentimes others also

the paynims vp with a conceipt of their owne wisedome esteemed the doctrines of christian religion to be meere dotages

to this purpose they alledged all that which reason blinded with passion could furnish them with albeit that in their superstition they beleeved many things much more repugnant to humane reason
they antiquity and yet all the pagan superstition sprang vp long after the truth
had we but the discourse of iosephus against appion it is enough to instruct vs that that wisdome so much vaunted of was of late birth in comparison to of god to that of the church
they alleaged their

miracles their prodigious wonders their oracles

disasters which befell the world after the publication of christianity as if it had not beene by many and most admirable miracles against the contemners of it as if it had not bin promised spoke of long before by oracles far exceeding theirs in clearnesse antiquity and truth as if whilst the pagan superstition flourished the world had not smarted vnder the same evills which it felt since the preaching of gospell or as if it had felt more tolerable plagues
and as this multiplication of evills were not rather to be attributed to the contempt of so excellent a butcherie and martyring of so many poore soules guilty of nothing but christianity blamelesse in all other respects living not so much like men

as angels

if you please but to read the relation of symmachus to emperours theodosius valentinian and arcadius

apologizing for paganisme you shal find there were never grosser vntruthes invented nor yet more like vnto truth that nothing could be spoken with more impiety or more plausibility the author being as eloquent as he was irreligious

these poore paynims little thought they maintained a bad cause their affection to it made them mistake it for good

they excused that in paganisme which in christianity they esteemed a folly a crime a sacriledge¬∑ for paganisme they enslaved their vnderstandings busied them to search out reasons against reason in it they swallowed even elephants
on the contrary in the christian religion they accuratly strained and sifted every circumstance the propension of their affections swayed them to an approofe of the religion of their

ancestours forbade them to condemne so many braue spirits of ignorance to remoue the bounds which the renowned ancients had fixed to tumble into the hazard of ruine and confusion so they imagined their empire and

which never receiveth such violent tosses nor ever feeleth such furious as when alterations in matter of religion are stirring in it
having vpon these considerations conceived a hatred against christianity it was easie for them afterward to invent more prejudices against it

the iewes for the most part blindly condemned christ and his doctrine

but if any one will doe the will of my father saith the lord vnto them he shall iudge of the doctrine noting thereby that the primary cause of their malicious ignorance was the corruption

of their hearts
yet they were not to seeke for pretences
they opposed against him

antiquity

succession

the promises made vnto them

the strangenesse and novelty of his doctrine

the contemptible condition of himselfe his disciples and followers
but the cause of this evill lay deeper inveterated even with in their marrow

an invincible hardnesse of heart

an obstinate resolution not to let goe their hold of the superstition of their forefathers

chap
iiii
that passion in the cause of religion produceth at this day the like effects and covereth it selfe with the like plausible pretences
who doubteth but that at this day the same passions cause vs to conceiue the same prejudices against the same truths its a very harsh point to condemne our forefathers for heretickes this is to putrifie their memories it seemeth to be an impious and vnnaturall act towards them
the pagans had this consideration the iewes had it and haue it at this day
we who are men as they are subject to the same passions with them haue the very same inclination willingly to beleeue that the religion of our grandfathers was the only holy and divine religion

insupportable to nature because tempered with little sweetnes to disgrace to procure the displeasure of parents kindred neighbours countrymen

superiours
these respects are able to produce in vs at least this effect to make vs wish that the religion of those to whom nature and the civill lawes haue obliged vs were the true
this desire afterward can it not stagger the iudgement and this staggering can it not terminat it selfe in a firme resolution to hold our selues fast vnto it and not to examine whether it be as sound as it is favourable because that comming to discerne its imperfections our conscience will not suffer vs to be any longer at quiet vntill we change it for a better even vpon condition of running into inconveniences so cumbersome and vnwelcome vnto the sense of our nature

so then when the ambitious spirit of man perceiveth it selfe taken vp already on the one side by a religion propitious to his ambition and invited on the other side by such a one as bindeth him to renounce the honour and embrace the infamy of the world shall we doubt of his partiality in the choice is it not easie to iudge on which side he will turne the ballance certainely man cannot strip himselfe out of all affection of religion in the same proportion he doth that he vnmanneth himselfe and is at best but a monster of nature in humane shape
perforce then he is to make profession of some kinde of religion the profession of irreligion being more infamous then that of a brutish stupid sensuality
but amongst so many religions when he commeth to the choice of the true his affections his particular interests accompany him to the ballance and there sway all
the truth how soundly soever propounded how evidently soever manifested

how powerfully soever vrged is not able to make the counterpoise
for this cause st paul recommending the gospell and wishing the knowledge of it to king agrippa excepted his bonds as knowing right well what a stumbling block the bondes and crosse of the gospell are to potentates

wee are wont to excuse at least if not to defend a wicked person if favourable and beneficiall vnto vs and wee thinke the cariage of a good man to be peeuish froward and cruell if hee oppose our ends thwart our purposes
iust so it is with our affection towards religion if it fauoureth vs and apply it selfe to our humours we are curious in inventing trickes to adorne it and artificiall colours to beautifie it
if we doe already or are like to make profession of it vpon good advantagious hire in this case probabilities are vnto vs so many convincing irresistible demonstrations the grosser and more palpable heresies in it are but petty mistakes the horrible abuses and enormities are but such slips as should be borne with in the spirit of meeknesse
but towards the religion crosse to his affections and which is is an enemy to his ambition man behaueth him selfe after another fashion he stretcheth and straineth his wits to espie some faults in it¬∑ in it a small wrinkle a wart a superficiall spot seemeth vnto him an hideous deformity
oft times he will not or dares not so much as looke vpon it for feare of being captiuated by its beauty
he willingly openeth the eare to him who is a deadly enemy of it to him who slandereth it he stops it against them who only can represent it to him in its natiue purity never considering

but in hasty and prefunctory thoughts the firmenes of its grounds for feare least a truth so euident and powerfull should come to master and tame the rebellion of his vnderstanding

chap that to be throughly assured of the truth of a religion it is necessary to examine the nature of the reasons vpon which it is grounded

seing that such is the inclination of our nature it concerneth him who desireth to bee throughly setled in the assurance of the truth of his religion narrowly to consider whether they are bare prejudices plausible pretences respects meerely carnall which make it pleasing vnto him or the truth of it be so cleere and evident that the conscience remaines convinced with it the soule satisfied the minde resolued and content
this disquisition this meditation will be of excellent vse in making way for the discerning in matter of religion of truth from errour superstition from piety of the abuse from that which is legitimate custome from law
for it will furnish vs with proofes not drawne from the circumstances of the accessory and that which is meerely accidentall but such as are grounded vpon the principall and which result from the nature essence of the thing it selfe
proofes infallible and inforcing a necessary conclusion whereas the other either conclude not at all or if they doe the most the conclusion

can doe is to make the cause for which the proofes were produced plausible and the contrarie suspected and odious being nothing else if we esteem of them as they are but of truth prettie conjectures
now is it not well knowne that the most plausible and gracious causes are not alwaies of their ranke which being not commended but by their own proper right haue that for the only ground reason not of the favour but of the justice they demande and those which by reason either of the ignorance or partiality of men are suspected and hated haue they not the lawes and equity on their side certes the most pure and as may say the most innocent innocencie would be punishable were it enough to make one guilty to be thought so

but we may proceede farther and affirme that the suspition of falsity is a calamitie ordinary to truth
vnder an vncomely maske their may be hid an admirable beauty
should the diamond lose it's invincible solidity or the inward fountaine of its bright and sparkling luster if sometimes it be found so outwardly discoloured that at the first view it can hardly be knowne for a diamond

in the courts of iustice it's ordained that accusers should bring in their inditement of the largest that the court may be fully informed concerning the accused parties yet this is not called condemnation but it only presupposeth a suspition
let then preiudices exceptions and pretences be imployed to the vttermost to make a religion suspected so that vpon them without more adoe the accusers ground not its condemnation

so that they tarrie vpon tearmes of suspition vntill they proceede orderly to a larger enquiry and a stricter examination so that the question be not a whit spared nor if it be possible the most vigorous proofe
if a rich diamond suspected of bastardy had sence it would call for the touchstone and desire to be admitted to a triall
truth also being suspected reioiceth and presuming vpon victory triumpheth already if shee be put to a serious examination and her last triall
the decree which imposeth this vpon her is not against her but for her this disgraceth her not but helpeth her to the only meanes by which shee may redeeme her credit
this is that shee most earnestly desireth as beeing a passage and introduction to her glory
it is her affliction to be suspected but she maketh not that her complaint this is not the subiect of her grievances custome hath sweetned this vnto her and made it tolerable
her complaint and greife which she cannot so easily disgest is that shee seeth her selfe condemned vpon surmises her cause not being sifted to the bottome where lieth the maine point of her defence and where shee hath reserued all her strength
for other wise by reason of by matters in the forme of proceeding circumstances appearances coniectures she would be quite lost ofttimes borne downe by a lie
is it not too well knowne that by such meanes the better causes are lost that by such trickes bad causes almost commonly in corrupt times seeke and obtaine the victory excellently then to this purpose spake tertullian

truth entreateth not to haue her cause favoured because shee wondreth not at her condition
shee knoweth

that shee is a stranger vpon earth and that amongst strangers shee easily meeteth with enimies
but shee hath her kindred residence hope and dignity in the heave
one thing yet she affectionatly beggeth that she may not be condemned vnheard
what can the lawes loose here where they haue absolute authority if she be vouch safed a hearing shall not their power be with more credit increased if they condemne her euen hauing heard her
but if they condemne her without hearing her beside the hatred of manifest vniustice they will incurre also the suspicion of a bad conscience in that they would not heare that which hauing heard they could not haue condemned

chap vi
that the cause of those of the reformed religion hath beene condemned in the romish church vpon bare preiudices without beeing throughly examined

they of the church of rome haue incurred this suspition in condemning the reformed religion without considering it and examining it to the bottome
they auoid both the hearing of our sermons and reading of our writings they neither reade nor meditate vpon the holy scripture
the high esteeme which they haue both of the learning and honestly of their doctors hath preuailed thus farre with them that

they haue chosen them for iudges in a cause wherein themselues are parties
parties accused not of a pettie fault but of a crime a sacriledge an impiety in causing the revolt of israel
if this accusation be false it were an easie and effectuall course to silence it if they would but lay open to the publick view the weaknes and impertinencie of the reasons
why are they so affraid to heare it why is it a kind of sacriledge amongst them to be busied in so serious and so holy a meditation why is it made a shriving matter to haue but thought of it who made these ordinances who instituted this so wary a discipline what was their plot in it what benefit expect they from it if the pope be innocent why made he this prohibition is it the part of innocency or of guiltines to entreate yea command that the accusation should not be heard this manner of proceeding tendes it to iustifie himselfe or rather to auoid and escape iudgement doubtlesse he doth as good as openly confesse that he is affraid of it
if wee had vsed such a subtile methode in our proceedings wee shoulde haue afforded iust matter of presumption against our selues that wee went not that way to worke honestly bona fide but driuen to it by an ill conscience

it's true indeed that in their schooles and writings they sometimes mention our accusation but for that they ought the more to be suspected of it
for he who hindreth his accuser from being vnderstood and taking the accusation out of his mouth will propose it himselfe secretly giueth vs leaue to presume hee disguiseth it that he may the more easily shift it off

it's also the common and continuall complaint of those of the reformed religion that their accusation is neuer proposed but mangled and counterfeit that their faith is represented by its enemies out of its naturall shape
that their adversaries in their disputations against them doe but quarrell with their owne fictions and combate with puppets of their owne making
that they represent some prints and lineaments of our doctrine but not in their true decencie and proportio like certaine which represe~ting the visage mishapen yet after a sort preserue something of the hue and complexion
so they hauing vnder taken they say to paint our deformities yet they will not suffer any one to looke vs in the face
what may be thought of the cunning or ingenuity of that painter which would haue vs iudge of his picture without comparing it to the originall they cite and reade our bookes in the chaire as the false accusers of christ with their cavilling sophistry alleaged his words to a contrary sence
but if they deale fairely and say no more then what is true why giue they not their people leaue to looke and consider at their leasure whether matters are so or no why is the meere curiositie of reading and hearing our workes accounted a what a wild contradiction what a strange confusion is this to cite our bookes and forbid the reading of the but the naturall lazinesse of me maketh this both excusable plausible
for to referre the people to our writings seemeth vnto them a token of assurance in their doctour this assurance or rather boldnesse serueth them also

for a note of conscionable dealing and withall the prohibition of troubling themselues about this matter easeth them of a labour
they are glad to heare our bookes cited that they may not seeme so vnreasonable as to condemne vs vpon other mens words they are as glad to be forbid to examine the citations that they may be discharged of such a trouble
so the lazie merchant relyeth vpon his factour and the vnworthy councellor vpon his clarke so long as the one looketh now and then to some accounts the other to an extract of the processe but carelesly hand over head and both of them say the one of his factour the other of his clerke that they are sufficient and conscionable men made both for their masters profit and ease they willingly perswade the~selues so that they may sleepe the quietlier

vpon what preiudices we haue beene condemned in the church of rome
wee could easily demonstrate that which we haue said particularly running through all the points of the reformed religion and manifesting the disguisement put vpon it to expose it to hatred and suspicion
but our ayme is to examine vnder what pretences it hath beene is endevoured to hinder those reasons from beeing at all or duely considered which haue made the reformation of their abuses necessary

their or of policie hath beene to decline the will and law of god speaking in the scriptures
and as wicked magistrates and the corrupters of iustice in a make authoritie of the lawes to depend vpon theirs vnder good and popular colours of a pretended obscuritie imperfection in them that so there may be a gate opened to al liberty in substituting in the roome of the lawes their owne willes and particular passions
so in the church wicked pastours not daring to accuse the of falsehood or to subiection to their authority directly haue contriued diuers meanes by which they may auoid their sentence determinatio charging the with all those defects which make a writing humane defectiue imperfect in its own kind denying the efficacy and maiesty of the scripture while they call it

a dead letter

of white and blacke its clearenesse and simplicitie whil'st they blame it for

obscuritie and

ambiguitie its

sufficiencie while they dare to accuse it of insufficiencie its aucthority in respect of vs when they make no scruple to teach that it hath no more authoritie over vs without the authority of the church then

aesops fables

or mahomets alcoran

but we suppose that we haue by gods assistance elsewhere shewed how false these censures or to speake more fully these blasphemies are wee haue at least wise performed it in such a manner that the adversaries of this truth hitherto haue not replied any thing
only the vexation and desperate rage to see the vanity and villanie of their vngodly policies

exposed to the view of the world hath forced them insteed of dissembling their griefe to vent it in iniuries and outragious insolencies indeed of their persons and well befitting so desperate a cause so accursed both of god and men but doubtlesse most vnbeseeming a christian a doctor of christians vnsutable to the gravitie the sweet demeanour and gracious mildenesse of truth

this euent sad in it selfe hath notwithstanding afforded vs ioy in affording vs a new example of the preuailing force of truth which faileth not to convince euen then when shee perswadeth not and if shee cannot bend her adversaries yet shee so them and so sorely bruiseth them that albeit they submit not themselues vnto her they are neuerthelesse constrained to testifie the vlcer and wound of their co~sciences by furious railings like those proceeding from a woman surprised in the shamefull act of adultery
in the mean time this ioy hath encouraged vs to proceed farther in discovering by what devises they hinder an examination of the conformity of our religion with the rule of faith as

tertullian calleth it whilst god enableth vs in the meanes to shew how they haue it an impossibility to consider religion in its owne naturall guife representing it so counterfeit vnlike it selfe that as they pourtray it for the most part it is prodigiously mishapen

now to make our religion so obnoxious to hatred and suspicion that none should vouchsafe to consider its harmonie and concord with those maximes and principles which haue beene at all times and are at

this time vnquestionable amongst christians they haue pronounced it an impossibilitie for any christia to discerne the truth by the spirit of god dwelling in him
and hauing once appropriated to themselues the title of the church with so many elogies priviledged by so many promises that no man may presume to question her authoritie vnlesse hee forthwith professe himselfe a iew turke or pagan it was easie for them afterwards to shuffle the doctrine contrary to their abuses besides all examination

but they seeing that it was not enough to vsurpe a magnificent title vnlesse it were after some sort justified and that contrarily the presumptuous rashnesse of such proceedings might pull vpon them the generall hatred and vniversall detestation of all christians they haue found out as they imagine notable pretences to colour this vsurpation and verefie their title
all pretences may be reduced to tenne heads which they propound vnto vs after this manner
the magnificent state of their church opposed to the contemptible condition of who call for a reformation of their abuses
her vnity and the division of her adversaries
her antiquitie and the noveltie of the reformation
they vrge vs to confesse that sometimes they beene the true church if we yeeld that then they cry out that therefore they are so still because the church perisheth not as certainly shee cannot either perish or change in that which is essentiall

they stand vpon a quotation of times places

persons when where by whom this change was wrought this defection begunne

they demand where our church soiourned so long time in what citty yea into what valley what desert did she retire they except against the commission of the authors of the reformation as false and they make great braggs of their succession continued without interruption
they boast of having the substance of christianity amongst them even by our owne confession
they dazell the eyes of the world with the shew of a multitude of religious persons which they say haue renounced the world trampled vnder their feet the delights riches and honours of earth that they may aspire vnto heaven
so in the vpshot they make their conclusion that where these notes are there is the church and where they are not she cannot be
and so presuming that they may with good right take these notes vnto themselues and that we can pretend nothing for them albeit this truth receiued amongst vs dart her most cleere and liuely rayes into the most passionate and partiall eyes yet they alwaies condemne vs vpon these prejudices

chap
viii
a consideration of the outward glory of the romish church and of the meane estate of the true church
now albeit these considerations might make the world doubt whether we were the true church or no yet they should not haue made them to condemne vs
the lord iesus was surnamed the nazarene this very surname made nathanael to doubt whether he were the messias or no
can any good come out of nazareth said he to philip but as soone as philip answered him come and see he went and saw him
what shall wee loose by it if we take a stricter view of these appearances that we may see whether there bee no cosenage in them the most rigorous will not make them false contrarily their truth the more its tried it will become the more illustrious
but if they are but cheating shewes what honest heart will not bee content that the imposture should be detected to this purpose wee are now busied
and for as much as the matter we haue in hand is large that our discourse may not roue wee will severally examine these pretences in the same order wee propounded

of all these appearances the magnificence of the romane church is the first with which she presents her selfe to the view of people being remarkable by

three principall circumstances
her outward glory
her ceremonies
her policy

but what will become of this maine point if al these circumstances ought to make vs the more suspect her and if the church which in this respect is opposite vnto her for the want of these shewes deserueth to be better esteemed of by vs

surely the nature of the church
her condition
the dangerous inconveniences which these circumstances draw along with forbid vs to admit them for characters and badges of the true church for the glory and lustre of the church is not outward bodily visible but inward spirituall invisible
all her beauty is within

shee is like vnto the tents of

kedar as soone couered with dust and well nigh burned with the heat of the sunne as soone shaken with stormes and tempests but in the meane time inwardly all glittering in glory and magnificence
like in this unto her

head the lord iesus as being

predestinated to bee made conformable vnto his image who during the time of his conversation here belowe had nothing without

him that could make him amiable being

contemptible in his owne person in

his disciples

and followers in the iudgement of him who saw but his outside
who would haue compared him in this respect to tiberius or pilate or caiphas the high priest

borne in a cratch not in a palace

in a blinde village not at ierusalem not at rome

of the royall stocke indeed but then when the glory of it was quite eclipsed

amongst the israelites but at a time when they were slaues to the

romans

of a virgin but so poore that shee was betrothed to a

carpenter at his indeed adored by a company of

shepheards but by a

few wiseme persecuted by

herod living in such a

retired obscurity vntill the time of his baptisme that iohn himselfe knew him not

then was hee led by the spirit into the wildernesse tempted by satan by him carried vp to a pinnacle of the temple and after all this having begun his preaching

continually and vnmercifully persecuted even to death but by whom surely by the princes of the world the magistrates the very same which pretended the title of the church the authority succession and chaire of moses oppressed alwaies with these prejudices haue any of the governours and beleeued in him behold to what the pomp and state of iesus christ is brought to ignominie and pouerty
but in the meane time consider him inwardly

in him are hid all the treasures of wisdome and knowledge

in him dwelleth all the fullnesse of the godhead bodily

he is the prince of life

the lord of glory

the sonne of god

his onely sonne

who being in the forme of god but made himselfe of no reputation

should then be seemely for the church

the workmanship of his hands

the clay which his fingers haue fashioned

the slaue which hee hath ransomed by his blood

the spouse which he hath sanctified by his spirit to any other livery then his owne to be handled more daintily and after a more delicate manner then himselfe is it possible that the

body should not be made conformable to its head that the glory of the head being invisible that of the body should be visible that the magnificence of the head being heavenly spirituall that of the church the mysticall body of that head should be earthly and secular yea her condition is to

suffer with him that she may raigne with him
moreouer statelines gaietie in apparell doth not commend but prejudice chastitie which either is of meane condition or else as modest in her deportments as if she were

this pomp which invites and feasts as it were the eyes of the body is but carnall and seeing it doth so much humour the flesh it should rather be taken for a marke of pride then of vertue

the rich glutton is clothed with purple and fine linnen he fares deliciously contrarily lazarus is sick vlcerous exposed to the iniuries of the weather and scorne of men beholding to dogges only for reliefe
yet lazarus is an embleme of the church the glutton of the world

moreover hath not the lord advertised

his own that he sent them abroad as sheep amongst wolues

that they should bee hated of all men for his names sake
that as the

world had hated him so it would hate them

that they should be cast out of the synagogues questionlesse out of those synagogues which had the succession and pleaded antiquity
that they should be

haled before the magistrates

that they which put them to death should thinke they did god good service in a word that

the disciple being not aboue his master they should expect the same welcome and entertainement in the world which he had

formerly received

you see saith the apostle your calling not many wise according to the flesh not many noble but god hath chosen the weake things of this world and things which are not to confound things that are that no flesh might glorie before him

to the thanksgiuing of our sauiour thanke thee father lord of heauen and earth for that thou hast hid things fro the wise and and hast reuealed them vnto babes to his exhortation

feare not little flocke for it is your fathers will to giue you the kingdome

and indeed if that outward pomp were a note of the true church and its contrary of the false the true church for the space of three hundred yeares and more during the time of her should haue beene the false
after that when arrianisme had so the world that it

groaned and wonto see it selfe become an arrian
when the

constantius tauntingly demaunded of liberius bishop of rome how great a part of the world he thought himselfe to be that hee alone take the part of one wicked fellow such a athanasius in his esteeme that hee should so disturbe the peace the whole world
when liberius was faine to indeed that he was alone but replied withall that his being alone could not weaken the cause of the true faith
when he alleaged an example from former times that once there were but three which resisted nebuchadnezars decree commanding them to worship an idoll

when the same liberius was downe by the impetuous streame subscribed

to arrianisme

when nazianzen was angry that the church was measured by the and when he said speaking of the arrians they haue the people and we the faith they haue the gold and silver and we the doctrine what was the true religion all this while the bravest and most illustrious was it amongst them which bare the greatest sway in those times was it removed from obscurer places of abode to reside in more famous and imperiall citties

let vs remember the advertisement which

hilary gaue indeed to those of his owne time but which its vse also to ours
of one thing advise you take heed of antichrist
it is not well that you are so taken with the loue of walls that you reverence the church of god in consecrated houses and goodly edifices that vnder these you settle the name of peace and presume on it is it a matter to be questioned a remarkable speech that antichrist must sit in them the mountaines woods lakes prisons caues dungeons seeme safer to me for the prophets either abiding in them or being driven and cast into them haue prophesied by the spirit of god

this outward glory then is incompatible with the nature of the true church and cannot possibly bee taken for one of her markes on the contrary the want of it being more naturall to the church it doth more distinctly set her forth to the notice of intelligent beholders

chap
ix
what kinde of tranquillitiy belongeth vnto the true church how kings are her nursing fathers and that kings are not the noursing fathers of the romish church

bvt what then shall the church never enioy a quiet estate and those promises that

kings shall be her nursing fathers that they shall licke vp the dust of her feet shall they be frustrated god forbid
true it is that god

giveth peace to his church but it is such as

passeth all vnderstanding
that

peace towards god by which shee glorieth in afflictions being

pressed but not oppressed

in perplexity but not comfortlesse persecuted but not forsaken cast downe but not destroyed
and these promises that kings shall be her nursing fathers that they shall licke vp the dust of her feet are of the same nature with those other promises that she

shall sucke the milke of the nations that

kings shall walke before her in chaines as it were in triumph nations enemies kings enemies of the church
promises then of earthly things for types of heavenly promises of fading and transitorie commodities to represent those everlasting honours pleasures
in this manner god hath promised that he would set her vpon carbuncles

and build her vpon saphires pronouncing that there should be no tumults nor clattering in her gates
because the iewish

nation at the time of these prophecies was most in loue with such matters therefore the holy ghost vsed them in the expression of the happie but spirituall estate of the church
in the same kinde the lord promiseth

that when the church should passe through waters they shall not overflow her that being in fire she shall not be burnt
promises according to the letter figuratiue according to the sense mysticall and reall
its true that god somtimes giues to his church

an outward prosperity

but in a mediocrity

but for a time
it appertaines not vnto her to enioy a compleat peace on earth being

a stranger in it a

pilgrime out

of her element and

heavenly country

a continuall and vndisturbed peace is vncompatible with her nature and doth not cherish but change it and at length quite corrupt it
even as the outward heat of the ayre continued without moderation first slackes the vigour of the inward and naturall heat maketh it faint at last stifles and quite extinguisheth it

its true also that kings are the of the church but this is seldome

cyrus was a father to the iewish church yet no part of it
so many pagan emperours haue suffered their kingdomes to bee receptacles of christians
then was it when the church sucked the milke of the gentiles then if ever was this prophesie that kings should be her sustainers fulfilled liberally
yet we deny not but god raiseth vp princes in his church
but when these princes in striving to shew themselues patrons of his church with more affection then discretion haue fostered her even with superfluity they haue procured her ruine by the same

means they sought her advancement

it was not a poet only from whom the pride and surly pomp of the romish church extorted this speech

hor constantin non torna let's haue no more constantines
st hierome

himselfe observed in his time marke reader how long since it was that the church attained to her full growth became adultae by persecutions but being cherished by christian princes she increased indeed in riches and power but decreased in vertues and graces
what would he haue in our daies wherefore a too pompous magnificence in the church is at the first a presage of a future alteration and at last a certaine note of a change to worse
but the times are now otherwise matters are crept into another extreame
there is not a prince at this day which to speake truely sustaineth the romish church she rather vpholdeth them by whom she is said to be vpheld
so they cannot properly be tearmed her patrons
shee domineers over them even in temporall matters she holdes their authorities and estates fastned to her beckand pleasure
its a small matter for her to vsurp the power of excom+municating them vnlesse she also take vpon her the authority to depriue them of their
when it pleaseth her she plucks away the scepter tramples the crownes vnder her feet so that now a strange alteration the nursing father trembles before his nursling and the guardian stands in feare of his not with such a feare wherewith god strikes his enemies a feare proceeding from a secret cause

when he hath caused his uoice touch not mine

annointed to giue a startling sound to the most inhumane and sauage hearts but with an affrighting apprehension of conspiracies poyniards the ruine of their estates and reuolt of their subiects
barbarous and vnnaturall pupill vnfortunate and protectors
what shall the church which vsurpeth this authority practiseth this cruelty be the true church surely he hit the point well who was the first that said that deuotion begate wealth but the daughter devoured the mother
a prodigious child deliuery that religion should send forth so vnnaturall a monster so contrary to the of its mother
but it was the purpose of god
he had foretold that kings

should giue their kingdomes to the beast that they should vndergoe its yoake
this prediction was to be accomplished

now then the romish church proceede and it let her triu~ph in this imperiall greatnesse seeing it is the greatnesse of the beast let her scorne at our homelinesse and scoff at our penury seing it is the condition of the church

chap that the ceremonies of the romish church doe not commend but disparage her

bvt let vs examine whether the multitude of ceremonies in the romish can giue her that title which her pompe cannot and whether the want of such a troupe

amongst vs will procure vs that disparagement which the meanesse of our estate cannot
certainely all alike one as much as the other
so that wee still stand vpon the same tearmes with them their glory shameth them our ignominy honoureth vs their ceremonies make them superstitious our simplicitie notifieth that we haue the true religion¬∑

this will clearely be discerned if we consider that there was indeede

time whe the ceremonies the rudime~ts of the world had place and were vsefull in the church of god who then

manifested himselfe in types and shadowes
but this time

lasted no longer then whilst the church was in her infancie while the heire was a child he was to be gouerned as a child his tendernesse being not capable of a full liberty and of a manlike instruction
the

day spring from on high

the sunne of righteousnesse was not yet risen
the bodie of the shadowes

the truth of the figures was not then exhibited
but the

fullnesse of time being accomplished the time of the churches infancy being expired the heire being come to a perfect stature the sunne of righteousnesse being already risen the

body and rea;l truth being now represented the

rudiments of the world tooke their leaue the shadowes vanished the

types gaue place to truth the carnall yeelded to a spirituall liberty

obscurity and imperfection to clearnesse and perfection

for this cause the apostle said

let no man condemne you in meate or in drinke or in respect of an holy day or of the new moone or of the sabbath daies

the reason was because these things were shadowes of things to come but the body as he addes is of christ proceeding farther he comes even to cut off those ceremonies which were got into the church by humane institution
if ye be dead saith he with christ from the rudiments of the world why though liuing in the world are ye subiect to ordinances
touch not taste not handle not which are to perish with the vsing after the commandements and doctrines of men which things haue indeede a shew of wisedome in will worship and humilitie in that they spare not the body and haue no regard to the satisfying of the flesh

what could be more effectually and vrgently spoken for the banishment of ceremonies out of the church for by this we see that they are altogether incompatible with the nature of the church vnder the gospell the church is dead with christ and so to liue spiritually these ordinances are a burden the lord hath eased her of it they are perishable true piety is permanent they are doctrines of men the doctrine of gods worship is divine sent downe from heauen they haue a flash of humane wisedome some shew of humilitie but they are indeede vainely then and impertinently in this case are the pretences of a good meaning vsed meere couerings
it is for princes to prescribe rules according to which they will be serued not for subiects to inuent them to themselues he is a who attempts it
how much more rebellious shall the bole sacriledge of them be accounted who either

bringe in to or keepe in the church a seruice of god patched vp meerely of humane institutions the more these ceremonies increase the more presumption and sacriledge there is in the church and shall they be the markes of a true church

let vs consider the primitiue church flourishing more in times of the apostles then euer it did afterwards who will not admire her great simplicity in all points and especially in ceremonies for excepting the celebration of baptisme by washing of water and of the holy supper according to the lords institution in taking the bread and wine and distributing them after thanks giuing excepting also the imposition of hands vpon those which extraordinarily receiued the holy gost whether it weare in a

generall calling or a

particular to a charge in the church

and annealing for a miraculus effect of healing the fick say these excepted their will not be found any other ceremony in those primitiue times so admirable was their simplicity
but the number of them was multiplied after wards not by diuine but by humane institutio
st auste entring in to discourse about ceremonies with ianuarius wel that our lord hath subiected vs to a easie yoke and a light burden and therefore hath vnited his new people by the sacraments very few in number easy to be very excellent in their signification as is baptisme in the name of the and the communion of his body and and if their bee any other thing commended in scripture not comprehending the ceremonies which are to bee read in the pentateuch which made the seruitude

of the antient people heauy and toile some
if he adde that it is to be presupposed that those things which are obserued by the whole world

although vnwritten haue notwithstanding beene ordained either by the apostles or by the councells this he restraineth neverthelesse to a small number of feastes of the passion resurrection and ascension of our lord of the comming of the holy ghost yea in closing his discourse with this supposition and if their bee any thing obserued by the whole church he plainely giues vs to vnderstand that their were very few things beside those by him specified and those to of very small moment
the doubting particle if their be any imports that necessarily
and truely if the ceremonies had amounted then as they doe now to an heavy burden by reason of their number the difficulty and trouble of obseruing them
if in obscurity of signification they had matched the iewish ceremonies yea if they had beene taken from the ceremonies of the law as the popish are all excepting those which are borrowed from paganisme this good father should haue contradicted himselfe if hee had thought that either the apostles would or councels could haue imposed them vpon the church
he had said that our lord had subiected his church to an easy yoke and a light burden should he then say that the apostles and councels had beene willing to make this yoke irksome and burden heauy

elsewhere he complaineth of the excessiue number and intollerable multitude of ceremonies admitted into particular churches bemoaning the condition of the church

by this meanes more slauish then that of the iewes
but this number was not so insupportable in respect of the seruitude it brought vpon the church as dangerous in regard of the superstition it begate

and certainely here is the venome incorporated into humane inventions

which vnder some well composed lookes of piety and deuotion insinuating themselues into the true seruice of god they stifle that and aduance themselues into its roome
our lord marked this euill when his disciples being accused of transgressing the traditions of their fathers he not only iustifieth them but also condemneth their accusers for hauing made void the commandement of god by their traditions
who is so blind that hath not seene that sees not daily that the commandements but falsely called the commandements of the church are more religiously respected and with more scruple violated then those which all confesse to be the commandements of god notwithstanding the infinitenes of their number and variety the sottishest dullest amo~gst the haue the at their fingers e~ds the spirituall seruice of god in the meane time and the manner of its performance is vnknowne vnto them the precepts which inioyne and teach it are strange to the greatest part of them
a pregnant argument of the hypocrisie and corruption of mans nature which is delighted in that which is fleshly and outward neglecting that which is spirituall and inward
this is that which gaue occasion to that antient and grievous complaint of the prophet conceiued in the name of god
this people draweth neere vnto mee

with their lips but their heart is farre from me

for their feare and seruice is the commandement of men

a man continuing without any exercise of religion can hardly be at peace with himselfe and therefore he ventureth vpon some kind of deuotion but the mis+chiefe is that he is not pleased but in that which is outward and sensuall carnall as he is in that which is carnall the more then that a religion is sensible and mechanicall as wee may terme it the more acceptable it is vnto him the more intellettuall and spirituall the more vncouth and harsh
for this cause even vnder the new testament and vnder grace

now when the lord hath advanced his church to an estate meerely spirituall he hath left her neuerthelesse some ceremonies by reason of her infirmity but few in number and without brauery accompanied with the preaching of the word for feare of danger namely the sacraments of baptisme and the holy supper

for he would elevate our hearts vnto a sublime pitch and set them on high and fixe them vpon their principall obiect drawing them from sensible and materiall obiects to more refined and purified affections and meditations

pondering these reasons we make no more apologies for our selues to those who cast in our teeth our of ceremonies
nay wee thinke this our glory seeing in this point we stand vpo the same tearmes with the blessed apostles wee haue the same defence which they had the condemnation of our accusers for that by their trumperies they haue smothered the syncere simplicitie of true worship
wee tell them

that this multitude of rites and traditions is more suteable to the superstition of turkes iewes and infidels amongst whome all these vanities haue beene and are still in
christian religion is not capable of them they cannot stand either with the spirituall estate or poore condition of the church
superstition the mother of ceremonies is lavish prodigall spirituall whordome as it is it hath this como~n with the bodily
both of them must haue their paintings their trinkets their inveagleme~ts this ca~not be without charges
the church cannot afford such cost vpon ceremonies and bables her stock is so employed in succouring the liuing images of christ that shee cannot vpon wooden babies the world is so hard her that shee hath nothing to cast away in the guilding of alters in erecting proud edifices in adorning walles with in maiestick and stately processions through the streets

chap xi
that the policie of the roman church serues all for preiudice against her

wee haue seene then that neither the pompe nor the ceremonies of the church rome can doe her any seruice but only to make her the more suspected the more shee stands vpon them euen as the luxury postures of countenance and of compliments in a woman make her chastitie more

questionable
but peradventure the policy government and authority which she takes vpon her hauing a visible head in a throne more then imperiall in the citty of rome heretofore the queene and empresse of the vniverse and now by vsurpation greater then ever she was having succeeded the empire and in this succession surmounted it in greatnesse of soveraigntie which she takes vpon her exercising dominion over the body and the soule in this life and after it in this world without the circuit of it without being accountable to any submitting all to her selfe not only the outward man but the inward also even the conscience
peradventure we say this consideration may make vs both to reverence and admire her
this doubtlesse may set her out most amiably to carnall eyes but the spirit iudgeth otherwise yea quite contrary of it
when the protestation of christ shall come into our memories

that his kingdome is not of this world the exhortation of christ that

his disciples should not be like to the kings of the nations the example of christ who being himselfe lord of lords king of kings during the time of his abasement became

tributary to a prince a tyrant the commandement of christ when he bid to pay vnto caesar that which is caesars and vnto god that which is gods
the

practice of this commandement in the apostles who acknowledged themselues subiects to superiour powers subiecting to them every

soule by their when they protested that they

were the servants of the faithfull for christs sakee that they had no power over their faith
these considerations

make that which ravisht fleshly eyes mishapen hideous and terrible to a spirituall view especially when it shall bee considered that this boundlesse power and transcendent dignity is a character of antichrist the true condition of his antichristian kingdome directly contrary to that of our lord iesus christ

certainely be it as it will that there haue beene are and will be many

antichrists and false teachers which oppose themselues against christ yet there is one of them to

whom this title is by an vnhappy excellency principally due
inasmuch as that beside the abominable impurity of his doctrine which is common to him with the others hee invades the royall prerogatiue of christ hoising himselfe aboue

the magistrate and the angells themselues and so aboue all that is called god for these are they to whom this name is allowed in scripture whil'st arrogating to himselfe a power over consciences hee pretends a supremacy over all christians a supremacy of religion and which is spirituall and so fits in the temple of god behaving as if he were god taking vpon him the power of binding loosing conscie~ces of making that sinne which god hath not called sinne of giving dispensations where god giues none of rating good workes and setting a price vpon them enhauncing and moderating the market according to his occasions

when he hath terrified the consciences of the greatest monarchs working this impression into them by his deputies that how serious soever their repentance may be yet they cannot enioy peace

either of soule or body vnlesse his absolution come betweene
whil'st he makes vncleane the vse of creatures whom god hath sanctified by his word not commending a fast but inforcing an abstinence from certaine creatures against the expresse word of god which pronounceth this doctrine a doctrine of divells
whil'st he vndertakes to make

marriage vnlawfull which the scripture hath called honourable amongst all men and the bed vndefiled
when hee dispenseth with the

breaking of vowes when hee allowes for honest those

marriages which the word of god hath declared to be incestuous
when he declares by his indulgentiall bulls that prayers had in a by him assigned are more pretious then if they had beene without his assignation
exercising this traffique that with the sale of things spiritual of soules and consciences he may stuffe his treasures which he imployeth as the world knoweth either in maintaining warre against christian princes or in promoting his kindred or in making his proud prophane epicurean court swimme in superfluities of dissolute luxury
what shall we say more when he vndertaketh to shut and open at his pleasure the gates of paradise to prolong or abbreviate the torments of those that are departed
when arrogating to himselfe this power he vseth such a partiality in the execution of partiality say we when he proceeds in such niggardlinesse and avarice yea such barbarous inhumanity sav√Æng only whom it pleaseth him to saue being able if you will beleeue himselfe to saue all
is not this to arrogate a power proper and peculiar to god

alone but this power which in god the lord and master of all is no whit tyrannicall in man who is obliged to doe for another all he can possible to loue his neighbour as himselfe more then tyrannicall
finally when

out of his authority he employeth the angells in the pretended execution of his commandements not he an authority more then humane altogether divine yet notwithstanding this so strangely vsurped power is the master sinew of that policy by which this vnwildy body subsisteth the colossus and maine of the roman church a nerue which taking its originall from the head straggles through the whole body being distributed to every member proportionably to its vse even as in the kingdomes of the world the monarches reserving with themselues as it were the and sunne of soveraignety nevertheles communicate the streames of this spring the beames of this sunne in proportion to their officers according to each of their functions

chap
that although it hath beene foretold that antichrist should sit in the temple of god yet that church which acknowledgeth him cannot be the true church

bvt there remaineth yet this scruple that how tyrannicall and antichristian soever this policy be yet the church where it is practised may not a whit the lesse bee the

true church
yea rather seeing that antichrist must sit in the temple of god considering this power and dignity wee haue iust reason to presume that the church of rome wherein it beares sway may be truly the temple of god

this scruple cannot stagger or stay him who shall examine whether this power be to be exercised by the church or against her to be approved or by her who will consider that the followers of antichrist at any time now if he be already come as certainely he is or for the future if he be not yet come as a great part of the world dreameth may oppose the church by the same argument alleaging that they are the true church because antichrist is amongst them
one

therefore adventured to interpret these words sitting in the temple of god in a sense which runnes sitting against the temple of god grounding vpon the words in the

originall which may denote as well an opposition against the church as a residence in it
but let vs take the words in the former sense that antichrist must sit in the church of god yet it will never follow that that church which him for her head obeyeth and adoreth him hath any thing of the church but the bare name
let him then be in the church but as a canker is in the body a tyrant in the commonwealth
it may seeme that for this cause the apostle vsed the word temple rather then church that hee might expresse vnto vs this mystery of iniquity by allusion to the temple of ierusalem called by an excellency the temple of god signifying vnto vs that as the temple of god had

beene anciently the place which god had consecrated to outward exercise of his service but that men transformed it into a den of theeues retaining for all that the title of the temple of god in regard of it's primitiue and sanctified vse even so the church of rome is stiled the temple of god as being primordially planted and dressed by his hand consecrated to god and the lord iesus christ and is so still at this day outwardly by baptisme and profession of the christian faith although they haue degenerated from their originall purity and by their abominations prophaned their consecration belied their profession
like vnto rebells who notwithstanding their rebellion retaine the name still of kings subiects as vsually he that is the ringleader of a conspiracy obeyed by his confederates is said to vsurpe rule over the kings subiects
so the adulteresse keepes the name of a wife still
after this fashion that may bee called the temple of god which is become a den of theeues that wherein not antiochus but antichrist hath set vp the abomination of desolation
but granting them that the temple of god wherein antichrist must sit should be the true church it cannot thence bee concluded that the church of rome should be the true church this will imply no more then that the temple of god are the faithfull both those which haue been heretofore and those which are still as it were impledged in the church of rome as anciently the iewes were in babylon and all israell in aegypt
over them the pope long since sate and at this day sits and in this sense sits in the temple of god in the rigour of its

signification
they in the meane time never were and now are not of the romane church as the graine is in the chaffe but not of it
as some vpright iustices may be in a court of corrupt iudges but not of their confederacy a few wholsome bodies may be with a multitude of infectious but not of their company
finally to cut them off from all evasio we say that the pope sitteth in the church of god in regard of the vnlimited authority he vsurps over all christians even those which are separated from his slaues vndertaking as their iudge to proceed against them with his tyrannous censures and constraining princes to persecute them

it is then a certaine truth that this policie of the roman church being of the same nature with that of the antichristian church it is a disgracefull and scandalous badge of her corruption and apostacy

on the other side let the government of the reformed churches be obserued in them there is no supreame iurisdiction but an authority which alwaies submitteth it selfe to the rule of gods word and canons of a discipline regulated by it
every man being assubiected to the iudgement not of one alone but of many and those many not vndertaking to binde any man by their authority but only by the equitie of their decrees submitting themselues to the controll of any man yea and yeelding to it if it be accompanied with reason
the true church is of so ample a circumference that she cannnot be governed by one alone and of so royall a descent that in that which concerneth the conscience she cannot be ruled by any but god himselfe

any other whosoever he be imployed in any function concerning her must behaue himselfe as her servant not as her lord not prescribing her any thing but bearing witnesse to what hath beene prescribed her not advancing himselfe aboue kings but bowing vnto them not thinking that his spirituall liberty exempts him from bodily loyaltie but giving to caesar that which is caesars to god that which is gods honour to whom honour tribute to whom tribute belongeth

this is the platforme and ground of iurisdiction in the protestant churches very different from the popes who establisheth a spirituall monarchie in the church who taketh vpon him to iudge all without being iudged by any who requireth a blind obedience grounded not vpon the reason and equity of his iniunctions but vpon the vncontrolable eminency of his place making as much of his ordinances as if they were brought downe immediatly from god as having in the

registry of his breast the fulnesse of infallible knowledge

whether vnion and discord be markes by which the true church should bee discerned from the false

all the advantage then that the church of rome gets by this clatter of externall pomp of ceremonies iurisdiction and authority by which it is endeavored to make

her greatnesse more venerable stands her but in this sorry steed to strengthen the suspicion of her falshood into her conviction
on the contrary the innocent basenesse simplicity and humility notable in the true church maketh her more louely affording vs sound matter of a pressing coniecture a strong presumption that she is indeed as well as in stile the reformed church
this perceiued maketh vs presage that all the other exceptions which the church of rome darteth against vs will be of the same making with this first having more plausibility then soundnesse partiality then iustice colour then strength as we shall see by gods assistance in the progresse of this examination
let vs consider then in the second place what weight there is in the pretended vnity of the church of rome opposed to the discord surmised to bee amongst vs

now we say that it is not generally true that vnity should alwaies be a note of the true church or discord of the false
we also that the vnity of the romane church is in shew only not in deed that it is rather a conspiracy then a vnion like vnto that amongst those which were besieged in ierusalem who

disagreeing betweene ioyned forces neverthelesse against those which besieged them being divided at home and vnited abroad
and on the other side that our discord is only surmised and we are in truth vnited not only against the common but also betweene our selues

that it is true that vnion is not a marke of the true church nor disvnion a iust presumption of the false

see we not that in the times of the apostles there were great discords in the church some of them were of one opinion some of another one thought that the ceremonies of law were to be retained another that they were not
and this divisio had made such an alienation of hearts in church that

st peter himselfe was compelled to be a timeserver and diversly to apply himselfe according to places and persons vntill he met with a rough censure from st paul who resisted him to his face and sharply rebuked him for not walking vprightly according to the truth of the gospell
vnderstand saith

the same apostle writing to the corinthians that there are dissentions among you and partly beleeue it for there must be heresies amongst you also that they which are approued may be made manifest

behold in the meane while

amongst the iewes the scribes pharisees and sadduces vnited together vnder one head the high priest
could they then benefit themselues with this pretence and vpbraid the christians with their discord true it is the sadduces agreed not with the pharises in all points of doctrine but yet all of them acknowledged one chiefe priest all of them ioined together in the same forme of seruice which is more the number of the sadduces was so small commpared with the other that it could nor furnish the christians with iust matter of and if it could what would this haue beene more then reproach and crimination and recrimination equally true on either side
now seeing that one of the parties was the true

church could it be inferred from its diuision that it was the false neither diuision then nor vnion can be essentiall characters either of the true or false church
but suppose these markes should bee infallible what would the church of rome get by it what should wee iudge of her during that long schisme what may afford her an apology perhaps a distinction that the division at that time was in respect of charity not of faith and doctrine
but how will this distinction of schisme in faith and schisme in charity heale vp the wound if both of them be equally pernicious equally incompatible with the nature of the church the donatists were not diuided from the catholique church in faith at the first for all that they were reputed of as members cut off from her
their schisme indeede at the length begate heresie as an inflamed vlcer causeth a feuer
and may wee not avouch that during the last schisme in the romane church the same case hath happened when the anti popes were by one another accounted the forerunners of antichriste rhe followers of both sides reciprocally called by one another the members of antichrist
what may here be replyed perhaps that in the christian church in the time of the apostles in the romane church since heretickes and schismatickes were not of the true church but mingled with it as darnell amongst wheat which maketh no part of the wheat as mutiners in an army which are not of the army
but what make not they of the reformed religion the same reply when their discord is cast in their dish confesse they not that their is indeede darnell in their wheat but yet not

of it that there are in their spirituall army but not of their army now if so soone af+ter the publication of the gospell by the apostles when that iudaisme and paganisme were assaulted by such strong forces there sprang euen then schismes and heresies like fogs at the rising of the sunne
if in a time so priuiledged so flourishing with the frequency and variety of gifts and extraordinary graces all this sathan striued with might and maine to make the assault vpon those who gaue it to his kingdome confounded with distractions that he might weaken the assailants by diuiding them who will thinke it strange that he hath made the like assay with the same successe in this last reformation who will wonder that he hath raised such an hurly burly of dissonant voices that christs voice may not be heard distinctly iust as anciently the iewes making their children passe through the fire in honour of their idol moloch for feare that their scrietches should call to their hearts for naturall affection and amaze them with the sound of their owne cruelty they tooke order that voices so sensibly lamentable should bee lost in a rude variety of more clattering and vnpassionate noises certes this deuice was effectuall to the iewes but it succeedeth not so well with satan
the cryes of infants were feeble and might easily bee but the voice of christ how soft and sweet soever it bee to those who are his yet it is a piercing and a mighty voice
true religion hath had its course all heresies are either dead or dye one after annother not by the of faggots and gibbets but by the

sword of the spirit and by the power of the word of the liuing god

that their is no true vnity in the church of rome and that in the reformed church there is no discord of importance
bvt to consider this point neerer hand there is no discord of moment amongst vs no syncere vnion amongst them but a combination to ruine their common aduersaries as some princes which otherwise bare mutual grudges one against another entertaine neuerthelesse a league against a common enemy
so herod and pilate agreed in putting to death the lord iesus the sauiour of the world
surely it cannot be denied but that in former ages the dissentions in the romish church were very great
their mutuall hatred was deadly witnesse their schisme witnesse also the great variety of opinions amongst those doctours which themselues stile catholique
who so will see proofe of this let him only consult the writings of cardinall bellarmine there he shall find diuersities and contrarities of opinions amongst the catholique doctours almost about euery point of religion

but the pope being then busied about the establishme~t of his papall omnipotence his spirituall authority over the temporalty yea his temporall authority ouer the

temporalty and spiritualty together tormented not himselfe with those disputes not so much as to interpose his authority to appease them
for those schoolebroiles at that time did not a whit preiudice his designes but rather helped them forward
so long as these doctors sharpned their subtilties against themselues they let him alone in peace they outvied one another in flattering of him each side fearing lest he should incline to its opposite
this indifferencie was both acceptable to the disagreeing parties and beneficiall to the pope
there were as yet no strangers which might publish the shame of these doings and aduantage themselues by these domesticke quarrells of their enemies they spake therefore at that time freely and boldly vented their opinions betweene themselues
but since that the world is well changed their affaires are no longer at this point
now it was to be feared least the discord of the seruants should ruine the authority of the master
for this it is that he hath desired to it asleepe that he may bend the entire forces of his supports against the stranger and common adversary
he was now to looke to it that they without tooke no advantage of this dissention to take away the scandall of it from those that are within
this is that he hath done but after a sorry manner as hee could tyrannically and by meanes altogether shamefull
not by a resolution of their doubts by stating of their questions by a rationall decision of their controversies but by his absolute authority imposing silence vpon the parties by this smothering the evill without medling with the root

he that will be better informed concerning this let him obserue that even at this day for example the true followers of thomas yeeld not to bellarmine that their angelicall doctor concluded amisse affirming that the image of christ and the true crosse are to be worshipped with the same adoration that christ himselfe
that the sorbonists will not consent to the jesuits that the pope should be aboue a councell that he may as well depose as excommunicate kings that a tyrant may lawfully be put to death even by a private man
in the meane while these points are of such consequence that if any of them be true they vnavoidably damne the contrary

if the opinion of bellarmine bee true touching the adoration of images that of thomas is pure idolatrie if the tenet of the iesuits concerning the authority of the pope be receiuable that of the sorbonists is schismaticall and hereticall

what will be answered vs here doubtlesse that these opinions are but problematicall and may on both sides indifferently be maintained so long as the church hath not giuen her determination of them
this hole indeed they vsually start out at when for the diversity of opinions which are amongst them they are pressed not to taxe that fault in others which is so notorious in themselues not to vrge those lawes vpon others which they meane to shift off themselues
neverthelesse their reacheth not farre they cannot runne farre if one briefly tell them that the sentence of the church is not effectiue but declaratiue that it makes not truth but directeth to it it makes not heresie but points it out
even as the opinion of the

physitian makes the disease neither better nor worse then it is lesse doth it make it what it is
the diseased party then of who the physitia hath decreed nothing ceaseth not to be sicke and to dye as well as those who by a true prognosticke were iudged to be in danger of death
whether the iudgement then of the church be interposed or not that which deserues to bee condemned is condemnable of it selfe and in the sequel makes him that beleeueth it infallibly damnable

but let any man tell me whether there may be imagined a more compleat and formall schisme then that which we see in the protestation of the french church against the councell of trent yes they say but this was but in certaine points
what matters that seeing that a councell is a body and expects either to be wholy receaued or wholy reiected not submitting it selfe to iudgement

that they to whom it speaketh by authority should goe about to choose and picke out some of its determinations
but requiring of all an absolute and vniversall obedience by reason of its authority and the pretended presidence and guidance of the holy ghost

after all this who will not be more astonished to see that the pope pronounceth not definitiue sentence vpon these differences¬∑ dispatcheth not these difficulties determineth not these questions
is it because he taketh delight to foster and cherish discord amongst his no this is no time for it
he is so neerly assaulted by those without and so lustily incountered with that he had need haue good entercourse keepe good correspondency with those that are

within
is it then because he fauoureth all sides equally neither this is more vnlikely then the other
he loueth his greatnesse to well he is to iealous of his authority too zealous for the adua~ceme~t of his papal omnipote~cy to beare no more affection to those who imploy their spirits to his bent for his soueraignty the to those who crosse it skirmish with it
is it not known how these are esteemed of in that they are tearmed politikes and haue not the name of catholiques allowed them but grudgingly
that which holdeth the pope from openly condemning some of them is a feare by alienateing them to diminish his forces
he knoweth that slippery things wrung to hard slide away the faster that lines stretched too much snap in sunder
he remembreth the peremptory roughnes of leo the tenth he hath seene how much it hath cost him or to speake properly the papall monarchy to haue prosecuted the affaires of the see so eagerly to haue beene so stiffely bent in the breaking of that which as he thinkes might haue beene mollified and bended with time

by this it is to be seene that there is rather a conspiracy amongst them a true vnion as on the contrary the difference amongst vs is rather a diversity then a diuision in the circumstances then in the thing in the accessory then in the principall in the policy then in the doctrine amongst some persons then in the corporation and generality of our churches
witnesse the harmony of our confessions and catechismes a harmony grounded vpon no other plot or designe then that of co~ming to the kingdome of heauen

to the fruition of the heauenly inheritance by that one and only way the knowledge of one true god and whom he hath sent christ

if some turbulent spirits striue to trouble our peace to diuide our vnity wee account them not ours they are spots in our feasts

and scabs in our body which spirituall vigour hath chased out
surely if any one communicate not with vs in doctrine and charity he is none of ours although he impugne the same adversarie with vs no more then he is of that side which impugneth vs vnder colour that he opposeth vs with them
they are not accounted members of the romane church who oppose vs with as much violence as shee doth no more ought the same men to bee esteemed ours vnder this couert that they fight with vs against the church of but indeede with much lesse valour and efficacy and therefore they are much more supported by her and shee by them reciprocally then they support vs

that novelty is a reproach which is ordinarily cast vpon truth and how shee hath beene cleared of it from time to time

let vs come now to the preiudice strongest of all the rest that antiquity they pretend burdening on the contrary the truth which we preach as new with hatred and envy
antiquity they say is diuine and venerable

nouelty on the other side damnable and diuellish
the truth of this wee willingly subscribed to but wee yeeld not that this antiquity which they so much cracke of appertaineth vnto them that the shame of nouelty which they so much taunt vs with is due vnto vs here standeth the difference if they can iustifie that they are ancienter then wee let them gaine the cause if wee are conuinced of nouelty let sentence be pronounced against vs the condemnation shall be iust we are all ready to giue way to it and to be the first that shall set their hands to it

but wee earnestly request that their pretences may not be take vpon words that our reaso~s may be pondered ere we bee condemned of nouelty vpon a bare accusatio yea although there were some likelyhood of truth in it
so long as the accuser speaketh it is hard if the defendant be not iniured
but the lawes but nature but god willeth that both parties the plaintif and defendant be heard with equall attention and equity
otherwise where is the innocent that could shroud himselfe from the fraud and viole~ce of calu~ny alwaies malitious but then confident and peremptory when shee perceiueth herselfe handsomely trimmed and to be favoured something like the truth

to begin this point wee say that it is no new matter that truth should be censured of nouelty nor that falshood should be invested with the venerable and sacred mantle of antiquity
the iewes cast this aspersion vpon our sauiour the prophet of prophets and doctor of doctors contrarily they tooke to themselues this prerogatiue that they were the

old friends and

retainers of truth

the pagans made the primitiue christians odious to the world by the aspersion of nouelty
proud and lying braggers they made brauadoes and trophies with the monuments of their antiquity
it is for vs then to thinke our selues happy and to cheare vp our selues in that wee are partakers of the same slanders with christ these are honorable skars with which the primitiue christians were marked and they who goe about to shame vs by these aspersions who boast and brag of their antiquity if they doe it vpon the same title which the iewes and pagans presumed on are they not vnhappie and their proceeding is it not really as ridiculous as in appearance it was commendable now that it is so it appeareth by the nature of the answeres we oppose to their exceptions conformable to those of christ to the iewes and of the christians to the pagans to discouer the quell the earnestnes and abate the insolency of the like calumnies
search the scriptures saith our sauiour for in them yee thinke to haue eternall life and they are which testifie of me

if haue beleeued in yee beleeue also in me

for he wrote of me
this is our defence at this day
wee are slandered as innouators wee answer search the scriptures if you beleeue moses the prophets and apostles you will also in christ preached in the midst of vs wee publish nothing but what hath written by them
it was oblected to our sauiour

that his violated the traditions of the fathers he replyed that by their traditions they had made void the word of god
wee at

time are molested with the same censure wee in our sauiours authority retort the same reproch vsing his words in the face of them that brocht it
wee offer to make it manifest wee doe indeede make it a plaine case that they nullifie the word of god by their traditions that our antiquity is the antiquity of the scripture yea of the truth contained in it which was preached before euer it was written
so when the pagans by this aspersion though false of nouelty made the cause of the christians suspected they were confuted by

the antiquity of the scriptures and by a proposall of these considerations that wee are not so much to care when

as vpon what grounds wee embrace religion that as god almighty iehouah the ancient of daies is not of any new being so his true worship cannot be new the forme of which worship who can better prescribe

then god himselfe who said they is more to be beleeued in a matter concerning god then god himselfe is man to be credited who is ignorant of himselfe vnlesse god assist him and reueale him to himselfe it is not the antiquity of yeares but of manners which is venerable
its no disparagement to be conuerted euen in the doting age of the world no age is superannuated for repentance
it is rather a shame not to be forward in a willing and industrious amendment in old age
so the primitiue christians defended themselues and so in these times wee frame our apologies
wee rehearse the same things to iustifie vs wee request that the antiquity not of persones but of doctrine may be respected
this is that which we expect that to which wee haue summoned and doe daily call our

adversaries to
hither our adversaries dare not come that they may not come hither they find excuses to runne back
it is then a base slander which is cast vpon vs that wee confesse our religion is new that wee denie which wee stifly affirme that antiquity is allwaies on truths side
christ in appearance was but an vpstart in respect of his adversaries as being but newly come abroad christian religion if one would haue iudged of it while he cast his eyes vpon the heathenish monuments their temples and edifices would haue beene thought a neotericke vanity
new in outward shew but really christ and his doctrine in antiquity surpassed the pharises and their leauen christianity was by many ages ancienter then paganisme
but is it not a kind of stupidity in ma more to looke after towers and steeples then truth neuer reme~bring that there was a time when these deuices were not but truth was before them all¬∑

is it not reasonable here that wee should be heard will it not be thought that wee speake with reason when wee affectionately both aduise and entreate that it may be considered that it is a fault almost common to all men to call that new which is not so but in respect of them to bestow the honour of antiquity vpon nothing but what is ancient in their opinion measuring both antiquity and nouelty by the ell of their memories
it fares with religion and lawes which the corruption and ignorance of the times hath obscured and as it were buried as it doth with countries called lands because lately discouered yet who is there that hath not his senses stolne from him which

doubts but that they are of the same standing with the world all reformation is new what matter is it if the modell and patterne of it be antient let our discouery be new the land which wee haue discouered is ancient alwaies beene though vnknowne to the multitude¬∑

that the search of antiquity is not rightly ordered and what the direction is which saint cyprian giues vs for it

wee affirme then that antiquity is alwaies on the right hand of truth wee beleeue it and preach it honouring true antiquity not that which seemeth so to our fancy ignorant of times past but that which is true and reall
otherwise wee should be like those which sometimes thought that beyond the great ocean and atlantique sea there was no land because there was neuer knowne any pilot that went so farre vntill columbus ventred vpon it in the time of our grandfathers
wee beginne at our shore with our time and so goe backward but why at least peirce wee not this ocean of time and so get through to the other end why loose wee courage in the midst of our voyage why turne wee saile so suddainely if wee haue had neither the skill nor courage to saile further why affirme wee so confidently that their is nothing beyond our computation why dreame wee that it is impossible for vs

to find that which wee neuer sufficiently looked after fearing to find it desirous not to find it
wee may then iustly suffer this taunt that wee fainted in our vndertakings that wee were tired in our iourney
when they goe about to calculate antiquity now a daies they beginne not with that which is first the first epoche is where were you within these hundred yeares so in steede of going they stop at a short period and retire homeward
in the meane time this path were not to be neglected nor this method to be refused if they would not stop in their search vntill they came to the age of the apostles for beateing this way so farre how many nouelties would their be met with betweene this and that of fresher date and which might be questioned where were you before which are not then of that ancient originall nor graced with the priuiledges of true antiquity which yet are antiquities in respect of vs and our times but meere in respect of the age of the apostles

that which was in the age of the apostles is truely ancient and nothing ancient but that they are the fathers whose bounds wee must not remoue wee must inquire after the waies of these fathers as for those degenerate ancestors which came afterwards wee haue an expresse
walke not according to the statutes of your fathers

and regard not am iehouah your god walke in my statutes keepe my commandements and doe them
antiquity then is not to be accounted of but as shee is a witnesse of truth according to tertullian that which was first taught saith hee is of the lord and true

that which

is absolutely first then is to bee sought out and from it the calculation is to begun

st cyprian giueth vs a direction for this calculation

although he otherwise applyeth it which is as pertinent as it is familiar instructing vs that euen as a conduit of water which formerly ranne copiously and continually coming to faile vpon a suddaine wee haue recourse to the to know the cause of this defect whether it bee that the drying of the fountaine depriueth the running water both of an originall nourishment or whether the fou~taine being entire the water faileth in its course the pipe being either broke or stopt that it being me~ded the water may bee restored to the vse of the citty in the same plenty purity it proceedeth from the fountaine so saith he the priestes of god ought to repaire to the originall and the tradition of the gospell and apostles in keeping his commandements to the end that the reason of our actions may be deduced from the same beginning whence that deriueth its authority
that wee may not doubt what is the tradition of which he speaketh

let vs what he saith a little before to the same purpose
one alleadged to him tradition whence is this tradition replyeth he is it from the lord from the authority of the euangelists or apostles for that those things which are written in the booke of the law are to bee obserued god himselfe testifieth telling iosuah that the booke of the law the scripture should not depart out of his mouth
if then it bee either commanded in the gospell or contained in the apostolicall writings that they

which come out of any heresie be it what it will should not be baptised let this holy and diuine tradition be obserued
st cyprian reiecteth not the baptisme of heretickes but only because he not that it was a holy and diuine tradition that it should bee admitted he is ready to receiue it if it bee proued vnto him to bee such a one giuing vs the rule to proue it by the apostolicall
he then a diuine and holy tradition all that which may bee iustified by them as for other he putteth aside with this whence is this tradition now therefore such traditions as these we are ready to accept prouided that the papists after the same method manifest their origin all vnto vs
when demand whence is this tradition when beganne it let them answere vs it is drawne from the writings it hath beene from the time of the apostles

chap xvii
that the only meanes to true antiquity is to haue recourse to the begining by the scripture

now that wee alledge st cyprian it is not to authorise the truth by the authority of men only wee borrow their words and fancies to expresse it
wee wish that it may be considered not who speakes but what is spoken
but if better authority here be called for we wil alledge supreme authoritie that of the lord prescribing

vs the rule it was not so from the beginning
wisely then and fitly

said tertullian which is the first is the truer and that which is from the beginning is first and that which is of the apostles is from the beginning
to which wee adde only that which followeth of it selfe that which is in the scripture in the writings of the apostles is of the apostles

so then in respect of this antiquity doe wee not submit our selues to reason when wee yeeld that our doctrine should be reiected if it be not of the apostles are not our proofes authe~tique to co~firme antiqui+ty of our religion when they are gathered out of their writings the writings of the eua~gelists

the course which is taken to proue the antiquity so much talked of in the church of rome is a recourse to fathers and councells
the more these fathers and councels are proue not this antiquity the more euidently but what what councells more ancient then the scripture what antiquity then is ancienter then the scriptures what title more ancient then that which is of the same date with the scriptures certainely it is an excesse of open blasphemy to equalize either fathers or councells to scripture and yet this is done
but though this be done yet it will not be said that the scripture is of a fresher originall then the fathers and councels impudency hath not yet ventured so farre
he then of whose side is the doctrine of the scripture hath the prerogatiue of antiquity and by consequent of truth
so then this question about is brought to this issue what wee are to examine which

is the doctrine most consonant to scripture this being cleared the controversie of antiquity need to trou+ble vs no longer

it is impossible to decide it for let them alleage fathers and councells as long as they will this scruple still remaineth to knowe if the apostles haue so ordained
vniversall consent cannot be called to witnesse in this case for to shew that it would requisite to aske all persons of all ages vntill the apostles
if the name of vniversall consent be attributed to that which is beleeued by the greater part to the most received opinion yet how shall we knowe and iudge of this kinde of vniversall agreement must it be by councells provinciall councells cannot giue vs sufficient assurance of it and for generall let them shew vs that after that at ierusalem which is registred in the scripture there was any one held before that of nice which was not celebrated vntill about the yeare
shall it be by the writings of the fathers which liued before this councell the

greatest part yea most ancient of them had this strange conceit that we are to expect after the resurrection an earthly happines here below for the space of yeares during which the lord also shall conuerse with vs eating and drinking
a doctrine which those fathers propose as receaued of all the church
the then are not sufficient witnesses the consent of the church is not a sufficient testimonie of true antiquitie

but what shall we say of their consent in receiuing little children to the eucharist shall we therefore beleeue this opinion to be ancient ancient indeed

in respect of vs but not of truth which being truely ancient and apostolicall hath condemned it of error which doubtlesse will be confessed by the church of rome
they which came after these ancients haue corrected their errours concerning the thousand yeares habitation vpon earth the worldly after the resurrection the admission of children to the communion
their comming afterward hath not preiudiced the priority of truth which they set vp againe in her ancient splendor and maiesty
the time which these fathers lived before them advantaged not their opinions younger then truth

it is then a reasonable offer which we make to verefie the of our religion by the scripture
it is an easie necessary and certaine discovery
for how few are there to be found which either are versed in antiquity or can be seeing the tedious succession of so many ages the multitude of volumes which must be read and pervsed for this purpose
a multitude if we haue regard to the truth of the history we search defectiue if to the leasure of ability of the greater sort infinite
let them which haue beene versed in these enquiries speake if they finde not through every age changes and alterations but the scripture is exposed to the view of every one it is but one booke in which that which is necessary to salvation is easie to him who is not preoccupated either with passion or with a conceit of its obscurity
this wee haue elsewhere demonstrated here we will only recite as appertaining to the matter we haue in hand that which the renowned father

chrysostome speaketh concerning

this
the pagan saith would make my selfe a christian but knowe not which side to fasten on
there are many contentions among you every one saith speake the truth
knowe not vnto what or whom to referre my selfe both sides scripture
but answere him this maketh much for vs for if wee should say that we beleeue reasons there would be something to trouble one but seeing that we stand to the scriptures they are plaine and true it is very easie to iudge of the matter
if any one consent vnto them he is a christian if he oppose them he is far from their company

these are the very words of that father which in his mouth will finde a great deale more favour and lesse envy then in ours
words which advertise vs that the scripture is the most especiall instrument to recourse to in search either of antiquity or truth
words also which avouch that the pagan himselfe iudge who is he that beleeueth who speaketh agreeably to he cannot iudge of the truth contained in it
for they are very different things to iudge of the truth of a writing and of the conformity of some discourse to it
the pagans could not iudge of the truth of the scripture but according to they might discerne what tenet and opinion was most to it
now this sufficeth in the question of antiquity for neither side but that the scripture is most ancient that then which shall be found most conformable to it shall be the most ancient
the pagans may iudge of this conformity saith chrysostome how much

rather then may the christians
the shortest cut then to the composing of this difference is to addresse our selues to the scripture

when one would knowe the antiquity of the priviledges of a colledge or a soceity he repaireth no whither but to the charter of the foundation
the instrument of the foundation of the church is the scripture if we offer to verifie our antiquity if we doe verifie it by the date of this instrument wee proceed ingeniously and our conclusion is irresistible
let the cease then to reproach vs that wee haue brought in a new doctrine vnknowne in the times of the apostles
let them not for shame boast any longer of seeing they refuse to be by the scripture the most ancient monument of antiquity
certainely they make but an vntoward enquiry into antiquitie who measure it by a certaine number of yeares who dreame that to haue beene alwaies extant whose beginning they are ignorant of

it is a safer course then to proue antiquity by truth then truth by
custome without truth as st cyprian well obserued is but antiquity of errour

the proportion elaborate figure the beauty of a medaile statue or an old peece of building is not knowne by the antiquity but the antiquity of them is characterised by these conditions as by infallible markes
so the glory and vse of the sunne are not discerned by his but by his glory and vse hee may bee iudged to be as old as heaven and earth
it is not with time in respect of truth as it is in respect of nobility the antiquity of which augmenteth its reverence making

it more illustrious
time contributeth no growth nor luster to truth
shee was as much herselfe in her cradle as shee is many centuries of yeares after
we must beleeue that the thing is and afterward examine since what time it beganne to be
let vs proue our religion to be true and afterward let vs consider its antiquity yea by this meanes wee shall haue proued it for vertue is ancienter then vice trueth then lyes superstition is after religion as sicknesse after health
so wee are ready to verify both the antiquitie of our religion by its trueth and the truth of it by its antiquitie beginning at the the times of the patriarches prophets and apostles that the processe may be abridged and speedily ended

chap xviii
that vpon the supposition that the church of rome hath sometimes beene a true church it cannot be concluded that shee is so at this day

so on their side those counterfeit flashes of antiquity vanish which now with a reall brightnesse shine more vigorously on our side
they who cracked so much of their antiquity are found to be but vpstarts and wee which were flouted at as new comers are found to haue the strongest title to antiquity
yet here they will demand whether wee can deny but that the church of rome hath beene a true church seeing there is extant an

epistle of st paule addressed vnto her in which her

faith is commended as being renowned through the whole world certes wee confesse that the church of rome hath sometimes been not the true church but a true church that her faith hath beene commended by the apostle
we say also that if they can make her appeare to vs at this day as shee was then wee will willingly shake hands with her
that neuerthelesse this cannot serue her for any prerogatiue for if the apostle directeth one letter to her he wrote two to the corinthians if he extolled her faith testifying of it that it was renowned through the whole world he hath graced also the faith of the thessalonians with the same elogies

these prerogatiues benefit not any of those churches at this day with any priuiledge why then doth the church of rome extract advantages out of them the churches of constantinople antioch alexandria haue sometimes beene and flourishing churches now who condemneth the not as being fallen from the piety doctrine of their ancestors but they adde that the church of god cannot faile or decay a strange pertinacy the which we haue named of corinth thessalonica alexandria and constantinople since that they are altered changed that they haue failed and fallen away not to haue recourse to the priuiledge and to the fauour which god had shewed vnto their predecessors if they alleage that they haue beene sometimes true churches yet this consequence will not be admitted that therefore they are so now
it will easily and clearely be manifested that

they are no longer true churches and that the church of god hath not beene conquered by gates of hell but hath continued vpon the rocke vpon which shee was built by the supreme architect the lord iesus
it will be answered these churches that their ancestors of the true church but the gates of hell haue not preuailed against them that they haue ouercome temptations that they haue vanquished death and shall vanquish the graue that they which haue them haue in the name and title of the church in truth of doctrine not in of life and that trefore they are not of the true church
that it is therefore strange that the promises made vnto the church should be true yet not appertaine vnto them seeing they are the true nor churches but barely of haue beene

let the doctors of the church of rome here tell vs in conscience an answere be not pertinent reply to the easterne churches which are separated from the romane when they alleadge their ancestors when they fathers were of them
why it not be permitted vs then to vse the same answere to them that predecessors a part of the church that the gates of hell haue not them but this honour and especiall fauour of god advantageth not their vnlesse they make it evident that they haue not been apostates from the doctrine of their fathers
good parents may haue bad children and yet god

failes not of his promise to the parents although the child receiue the stipend due vnto his iniquity the piety of his parents serues but to encrease his condemnation
a good father cannot perish a true church fall away
but as it is but too common that wicked children succeede good parents which perish in their sinne except they repent so to a true church an impure church succeedeth perisheth in her impurity vnlesse shee be repurified and reformed

doe yee workes worthy of repentance and presume not to say that wee are the children of abraham said iohn baptist to the iewes if

yee were the children of abraham yee would doe workes of abraham said the lord to them then when they bragged that they were of the race of abraham they

then the true children of abraham which are his child in the faith and they are truely the successors of the primitiue churches which haue succeeded them in the doctrine of the faith

the ancestors of the twelue tribes which reuolted were of the true church for all this could it be said after their reuolt because sometimes they had beene that therefore they were so still vnder prete~ce that the true church cannot reuolt doubtlesse no for when it was said that the ten tribes at other times had beene of the true church that was alwaies vnderstood of their pious and religious ancestors of them meerely in respect of the outward profession and in regard of the opinio men might conceiue of them before their reuolt
so their reuolt caused not that the church should reuolt but discouered their hypocrisie

moreover

it so fell out that iudah and the halfe tribe of manasseh reuolted also with a worse apostacy then they of israell

and consequently the reuolt was generall in all israel yet notwithstanding it could not be said euen then

that the church of god was revolted because that insteed of the reuolted multitude god alwaies preserued his owne
a small number of the election of grace

which groaned sighed for all the abominations which were committed in ierusalem

chap xix
that notwithstanding the reuolt of the romish church the true church hath continued whole and entire

in the apostacy

which was to be in christian church and which at this day wee see to be the same is come to passe
if the iewes in vaine cryed the

temple the temple in vaine cry they now adaies the church the church
if there were nothing but the temple an empty name a stately den of theeues
if it were sometimes answered them which boasted of it

trust not vpon lying words the temple of the lord may not wee now make the same answer vpon the like occasion
they brag'd that the law should not perish from the priest nor the councell from the wise nor the word from the prophet because these promises were made to the church

at this day the romanists say the same make the same vauntes but that which was sometimes answered those vaineglorious hypocrites

the law shall perish from priest counsell from the sage is that which we tell our aduersaries it is that which wee desire to be admitted to verifie that wee may not be oppressed with these preiudices wherewith the iewes anciently endeauored to confute the prophets and the lord the prince of prophets himselfe the supreame prophet of his church

at the time when the lord came into the world when god was manifested in the flesh and many yeares before that time what was the state and outward face of the iewish church what was the high priest what were the successors of moses which pretended antiquity succession and the title of guides and pastors of israel surely enemies of god vnder the honest title of being his seruants seducers of the people vnder the demure shew of being their teachers corrupters of the law wearing the ornaments and sitting in the chaire of interpreters commending themselves to the people and by them commended vnder this magnificent title
such was the iewish church to looke vpon outwardly as well in those which sate ruled in their synagogues in their great little councells which they called the sanhedrin as in the route multitude which followed approued adhered to those disorders
so miserable was the face of the iewish church at that time which yet had not alwaies beene so
but neuerthelesse in this so thicke and blacke darknesse god caused his light to

shine reserued his wheat amongst this chaffe in that infected multitude he preserued a small number from that pestilence small indeed but so vseth to be the number of things of worth are rarities
there is much stone few diamonds are many dullards few sages
it is the little flock to whom it hath pleased the father to giue the kingdome

so then the church which hath succeeded which hath occupied the of the true church may become an harlot by being erroneous and apostaticall and yet the true church erreth not is not abandoned of her lord and husband
the reply also which here is made vnto vs is impertinent not tolerable that the estate of the church was of another nature vnder the old testament before the first comming of our sauiour while the

heire was a child and the church enioyed not a full liberty while shee

saluted the promises of the actuall exhibition of the messiah of the abundance of grace in him a farre off without obtaining them as yet
all this is true but would they hence infer that the heauenly father hath disinherited his childre vnder the old testament which he doth no longer vnder the new that he hath prostituted his spouse but now keepeth her in his cabinet no our heaue~ly father hath neuer been without children our bridegroome without the church his bride
it is true indeede that he maintained her more sparingly vnder the old then vnder the new testament the scripture teacheth and wee beleeue
but wee

denie that he forsooke her any more then then now for he which

toucheth you saith he toucheth the apple of mine eye
the church then which reuolted vnder the testament the church which followed that reuolt was not the church but in name and in respect of the reuenues and dignities into which it succeeded masked howsoever with the outward profession of the true religion
this was the church which forsooke god this was the church whom god forsooke

if then any church in these times after the like manner become apostaticall ought she to haue any more vnder the then vnder the old testament god detesteth hypocrisie equally in ages yea the greater it is the more abhominable it is vnto him
if then it be doubled in these latter times the indignation of god is proportionably incensed against it
the grace offered excuseth not but agrauateth the neglect of it so that there is no difference in which concerneth the perseuerance and revolt of the church vnder the law or vnder grace

this is our and our doctrine in this point
not that we would that the true church erreth or falleth away finally in that which is fundamentall although in some of her

members sometimes she goe away for a time
but we affirme that they who by most voices beare away the title of the church either haue erred or may erre fundamentally and finally
so when we say that the iewish church hath erred wee vnderstand not the true iewish church but that which was so in appearance which

tooke vp its roome and bare the outward cognisance of it which had the externall calling succession
after the same manner when we teach that the christian church may erre that it hath erred we vnderstand not the number of the faithful the number of their in the faith wee are cofident that they cannot erre fundamentally generally all together and finally
wee say indeede that the church which erreth is that church which triumphing with the title of christs spouse is indeede no better then a strumpet

chap xx
that they of the church of rome vse a perverse and ridiculous manner of argumentation while they conclude from the made to the church that they haue erred nor can erre

it is a friuolous tricke then that they insist somuch vpon the made to the church and to vs newes that

is built a rocke the gates of shall not preuaile against her
it is to no purpose that they alledge those priuiledges that shee is

the pillar and prop of the spouse of christ

his

onely spouse that he is and will be alwaies in the of her that his

spirit guideth her into all

the pith of our controuersie lyes not in all this
let him which denieth

the truth of these promises or envieth the church these elogies be anathema maranatha let him be as a iew or a turke
but as he is not truely a iew which is one outwardly said the apostle so neither is shee alwaies the true church which is so in the account of men but shee which

is so inwardly whose glory and praise is of god and not of men

sealed by his spirit

knowne of him him onely certainly and

distinctly
all the question is whether shee bee the true church whom the world graceth with this title
if wee should graunt that the church of rome is the true church doubtlesse we should confesse too that she never erred fundamentally
let it then be verified vnto vs that shee is so and we will giue way to all the rest we will ingeniously confesse our selues to haue beene schismatiques in separating our selues from her communion

the principall question then betweene vs and them is whether they are the true church or no
this being so is not their proceeding perverse and ridiculous when they take that for granted which is the maine point of our co~troversie for alleadging that they are the church they thence inferre that they neither haue erred nor can erre
this argument should runne backward they haue not erred therefore they are the true
if a woman accused of adultery of being taken even in the vile act of her vnchastity insteed of answering directly to her accusation and of acquitting her selfe by this meanes to recover her good name now tainted for all her defence should onely make a bare protestation that shee were an honest

chast woman might it not be presumed that she were either mad as well as dishonest or else as impudent as vnchast what should that physitian bee thought of which being examined about a fact of impoisonment obiected against him instead of iustifying his prescriptions and his application of them according to the rules of physicke would onely cry out that hee was a physitian of much skill experience and fidelity we accuse the church of rome she who will needs be called so of being the whore and the babylon in the revelation
we accuse her doctors of impoisoning soules she answereth vs that she is chast and that she is the spouse of christ her doctors tell vs that they are the successours of the apostles and the servants of god contenting themselues with this poore silly answer without any other proofe to iustifie themselues
truely if we should accord that the papacy is the of christ and that its doctors are the heires of the apostles they would haue gained the but what man is there so stript of reason which seeth not that when we accuse the church of rome for having erred and plaied the apostate wee accuse her of not being the true church that when wee accuse the teachers of the church of rome for being seducers we deny them to be the successours of the apostles
so then when for their compleat defence they only oppose against vs these glittering titles they doe no more then simply that which was principally called in question a pretty defence for them who haue none at all
true it is that their proceeding would haue some equitie in it if our accusation

consisted in a naked assertion and if we barely affirmed that which we were not able to proue for to a simple yea it is enough to oppose as simple a nay you say it we deny it
yet he that is innocent will not content himselfe with this easie come off couragious as he is he will doe more then acquit himselfe
but here the question is not about a bare affirmation but a rationall proofe so strongly backed that there is no shift in sophistry no wrangling devise which they haue not recourse to that they may not be bound to answer directly
wee offer to lay open the whoredomes of the church of rome and the impoisonments of her teachers
we propound this accusation fortified with reasons and proofes
is not this on our part to proceed as we should and on theirs by this vaunting as vaine as it is bold of the venerable title of the church the pastors and teachers of the church which they oppose vs with to make themselues rather more suspected then any whit iustified yet when they are prosecuted and driven even into the vttermost corner of their evasions their last mine as it were by which they blow all vp is we are the church of catholike doctors
as if we disputed not with them about the truth of this title as if this were not the summe and substance of our accusation that they are not such as they would make vs beleeue they are
in doing which they are like vnto a company of vnlearned professors who when they are puzled nonplust by their auditors for want of other reply betake themselues to the authority of the chaire and prerogatiue of the square cap

chap xxi
that it is an vniust proceeding to deny the change happened in the church vnder pretence that the authors time and place of it cannot be specified
for all this they imagine that they come over vs againe very shrewdly by a demand which they vrge vs with pressing vs to tell where when and by whom the change in the church was begunne
for presuming that we cannot answere them exactly concerning this they promise to themselues in the sequell this aduantage that we shall be forced to yeeld vnto them that since the times of the apostles matters haue continued at that point which wee see them to be at at this day neuer considering that it is the vnhappie condition of time and the ordinary pace of the world to runne on into to loose and destroy with time that good which deserued to haue beene perpetuated by it
not as if this corruption or contagion could at all endanger or hurt the true church the number of the faithfull and the elect whom god sustaineth in the midst of the greatest confusions and enlightneth in the most fearefull eclipses as wee haue formerly shewed but in as much as time shriueleth and wrinckleth as it were the face and outward hue of all things

vnder the old testament before the publication of

the yeare of gods good pleasure he alwaies preserved his church viz his owne yet no man denyeth but the outward face of the church was the subiect of many and great alterations all confesse it and hee which should not would deny the scripture
vnder the new testament the same is happened the church of god neuer altered in that which is essentiall much lesse hath shee vtterly failed but if wee consider her outwardly in the multitude in which shee lay hid as the graine amidst the chaffe here the change is notorious wee offer to manifest it to him who doubteth of it
but wee say it is a tyrannous law to compell vs to particularise the persons times places by whom when and where the change and reuolt was begunne

when the concealer of stolne goods is attached for felonie the lawfull owner challenging his goods and verefying his title gaineth his cause and ouerthroweth the concealer although he cannot shew where when and by whom the theft was committed
the physitian forbeareth not to iudge of a disease and to apply conuenient remedies vnto it although he be ignorant of the time place and occasion of it

surely it is a weake conclusion in all matters especially in religion to infer that no alteratio hath beene vnder colour that the author time and place of it cannot be punctually specified
such an accurate enquirie aknowledge so exact in such circumstances dependeth of the histories of times past what then if those histories bee not knowne what if they bee not to bee found in the records of antiquity what a

multitude of alterations haue all along happend the first authours times and places of which it is impossible to specifie but who is not acquainted with the ordinary dealings of innouatours who knoweth not that they vse to mislay or abolish such copies and evidences as might one day be produced against them how many bastardly books haue beene fathered vpon ancient and famous authors which they would haue reiected as monsters this hath beene practised in all faculties in phisick in law and also in diuinity
it is then a hard and vniust proceeding in romanists to bind those who accuse the for being innouatours to produce against them fragments foisted into the registrie by their owne confederates whereas they produce more authe~tique vnquestionable evide~ces

he that should vndertake to conuince the iewes of hauing adulterated or rather abolished the purity of the ancient doctrine of their fathers since the time of the prophet malachie he would find himselfe hardly tasked precisely to specifie the authors times places of this so strange enormious an alteratio
yet it is as cleare as noone that such a corruptio such a cha~ge hath beene in the religio of the iewes
by what then is this so vndoubted a truth made euident doubtlesse by the scriptures by which wee know what was the ancient religion of the iewes
the comparison of that samplar with the religion of the iewes as it was in our sauiours time discouereth what a great diuersity there is betweene their new superstition and old religion and consequently marketh out the change though not the circu~stances of it

and indeede when the lord the sonne of god accused the scribes and pharisees the doctors and interpreters of the law and conuinced them of hauing corrupted the ancient and originall purity he troubled not himselfe to quote vnto them records and histories and exquisitely to set downe where when and by whom the innouation was begunne
he contented himselfe with the scriptures and went no farther then the comparison of doctrine
yet who could better haue preformed such an enterprise then himselfe who could number to the smallest scruples of time and was superlatiuely skilled both in chronologie and historie
but he was willing in his owne person to teach vs what method wee are to follow in discouering and reforming abuses to wit that wee are not bound scrupulously to specifie all those circumstances which are of no importance to the maine point

chap xxii
that there are changes which creepe on by little and little and that it is hard yea imposible to specifie alwaies the times places and authors of a change

moreover we must needs confesse that which experience dayly thrusteth into our senses that there are alterations which on and encrease by little and little so that one cannot so distinctly perceiue them that it should

be possible for him precisely to quote the very instant of every degree in this almost insensible progresse
who could ever obserue when where by whom by what degrees the fre~ch tongue hath been cha~ged yet must he needs be accounted void of iudgement who from this difficulty yea impossibilitie would conclude that there hath beene no change in it
what old man is there able precisely to obserue the minute houre day month yea yeare in which he beginnes to bee an old man to change his complexion to feele the decaying of his strength and faculties yet for all that he must needs be senselesse who in his old age should deny so sensible an alteration

now to apply these considerations to the estate of the christian church
who knoweth not that in the primitiue church the

errour of the millenaries prevailed yet who is hee that can specifie by whom where when it began who can particularly tell when it ended where and by whom it was first condemned vpon this who will inferre that this errour hath beene that it is yet in the church or that it is not an errour but an apostolicall doctrine it was also as no man doubteth an errour anciently received and approued by the church that the sacrament of the

supper was to bee administred to little children
who will tell vs who was the first father of it where and when it was brought in
who will produce the records of an opposition made against it nay more let any man tell when and in what councell such a doctrine was condemned there is no man able to performe this and shall we therefore say its a doctrine of the apostles

it was an errour of the fathers of the primitiue church that

the soules of the saints themselues entred not into the heavenly paradise immediatly after their departure out of their bodies
tertullian excepted only the soules of martyrs
but who is able to name the author time or place of the nativity of this strange opinion yet it is most certaine that this erronious doctrine had its birth growth and period
it was an erroneous practise in the ancient church to pray to god in the behalfe of the patriarchs

prophets and for the whole company of the iust deceased for the martyrs themselues
who is so versed in the knowledge of antiquity that can distinctly set downe the time place and first inventer of that so strange a devotion or the councell in which it was condemned when where it was first condemned the difficulty yea impossibility of rendring an exact account of such particularities shall it be a sufficient ground to maintaine that it alwaies was and is still in the church

there was a time when immediatly after baptisme

the baptised partie was made to tast milke hony when his whole body was to be

annointed with oile when they were

to abstaine a whole weeke after from washing themselues
when they made vpon a certaine day in the yeare offerings for the nativity that is for the memory of the day of the martyres sufferings
when they thought it an impiety to fast betweene easter and to worship kneeling
when

they prayed not but towards the east

when was it that these customes had their beginning or if they are apostolicall as it was sometimes

thought when they were practised how haue htey beene since altered when began their change by whom in what place if wee are not able to satisfie those which should vrge vs with all these queries must we needs therefore be obstinate without reason and deny the change of those rites and seeing the change of them was made with reason must wee not confesse that they were not of apostolicall that is of divine institution

it was an apostolicall constitution but which was to last no longer then the occasion of it

that the faithfull should abstaine from victualls sacrificed to idols from bloud and that which was strangled
wee see that this constitution hath expired but if wee cannot assigne the time when it gaue vp the ghost or the synode in which it was abrogated shall wee therefore affirme that it continueth vntill now in the meane time it is as absurd to deny the originall of a thing vnder pretence that author time and place of it are vnknowne as to deny the discontinuation and end of it vnder colour that it cannot be assigned by whom where and when it begunne to be discontinued
as if one should deny that he had ever beene the month yeare or perhaps age of whose nativitie is vncertaine or as if one should deny that he were dead the yeare or perhaps age of whose decease is vnknowne vnto him

it is then an absurd cavill to presse vs to shew that no change hath happened in the church by quoting the time by assigning the place by naming the authors of it
but we argue rationally when wee proue

by experience that there hath beene a change when we compare the doctrine of the apostles with that which prevailed in the church afterwards and cleerely manifest the strange diversity repugnancy there is betweene them
when we compare the state of the romish church with that of the church in the first purest ages and make the diversitie betweene them visible and palpable although this kinde of proofe being not easie but to those who haue skill in the languages we stand not chiefly vpon it
and although it should faile vs which yet it doth not yet therefore there should not be any prescription or exception against scripture
that which is come vp since is new in respect of it though ancient in respect of vs
but here the question is not about the antiquity of persons
to which we adde that if there should bee any thing found as ancient as the scripture being not con+formable vnto it if its antiquity commend it its falsity condemneth it so much the more as it is the nature of evill to be the more pernicious the more ancient it is

chap xxiii
that it is not ingenuous dealing to vrge vs to answer where our church was and what pastors it had before the reformation

now the authors of these wrangling cavilling proceedings might cease their captious quirkes and take time to blush a while
but as the contentious spirit of sophistrie

is infinite in the invention of new trickes to perplexe a cause they giue vs here another knot to vntie
god they say hath alwaies had a church on earth this wee confesse and that church hath from time to time had her pastors here we agree with them too
but then say they where was your church before luther what pastours what doctours had it see here againe how from the ignorance of man they conclude the not being of the thing
presuming that we cannot satisfie these demandes and assuring themselues that we knowe not where our church hath beene and by whom it was guided they take it for a matter already out of question that therefore our church was not at all
in which inference there is discovered a notable peece of wrangling for it being presupposed which yet is false as it will appeare by and by that we knewe not where our church was and who haue beene our pastours since the alteration and defection hapned in the church of rome might it in conscience hence bee concluded that it was not therefore at all would this consequence be admitted thou knowest not such a thing therefore it is not or hath not beene
yet this is the manner of their argumentation against vs you knowe not say they where your church was nor who were her pastours therefore she was not at all
vpon this it is that they triumph and insult over vs as if wee answering that we knowe not where our church was nor what teachers it had we should implicitly yeeld in the same answer that she was not all or if she were that shee was destitute of pastours

the like argument once deceaved the prophet elias

when he knewe not where the church of the tenne tribes was nor who were its guides

they haue forsaken thy covenant saith he they haue broken downe thy altars they haue slaine thy prophets and am left alone and they goe about to take away my life also
hee thought himselfe to be alone because his fellows were vnknowne vnto him
but the lord made him see the imperfection of his vntoward logicke advertising him that he had reserved seauen thousand to himselfe which had not bowed the knee to baal
if then the church of israel might subsist so secretly that elias knewe neither her abode nor her pastours who will thinke it strange that the same case should happen in the time of our grandfathers that then when the earth was overclovded with darknesse god had a church albeit we are not able to specify the place of her residence or names of her pastours
it may not here be replied that at that time beside the hidden company god had a flourishing church in iudah in as much as it hath often fallen out that the church of iudah equalled yea exceeded

the church of israel in corruption
so that then to behold the face of the church as it was obvious to humane view it could not be said but all lay in desolation
but albeit that lamentable defection had not beene vniversall in and iudah yet the argument drawne from the estate of the israelitish church would still retaine its force seeing that if such a part of the church might exist vndiscernable why may not the other parts also and all other particular churches subsist vnknowne

it's a necessary consequence that that which hindreth

the whole church from lying hid ought also to hinder any of her parts and the same power which preserueth and sustaineth the parts of the church viz particular churches amongst the most tumultuous confusions and disorders shall conserue likewise the whole church
if we are to thinke that the church is alwaies visible and may be pointed at with the finger because the lord prescribing the meanes to compose differences

hath said tell it to the church seeing they are particular churches to whom recourse in this case is to be had this reason will proue as strongly that particular churches should alwaies be visible
if it hinder not but these may be invisible as it is agreed vpon neither will it hinder that the church totally in her vniversality may sometimes be invisible
if the church be alwaies

set vpo the tops of mountaines if in consequence she be alwaies visible the particular churches shall be so too seeing she cannot be taken notice of but in them and by them and if she bee not alwaies glorious and conspicuous in her parts no more shall shee be in the whole
if lastly it be thought that the church ought alwaies to be visible alwaies exposed to the eyes of men because her pastours are

the lights of the world compared to candles which are not put vnder bushells but vpon candlestickes seeing this appertaineth to the ministers of particular churches the churches in which these ministers are by this argument shall continue alwaies visible to the eyes of carnall men which is manifestly false
but god hath not promised that his church should bee alwaies elevated vpon mountaines he

promised indeede that she should be placed there and so no man doubteth but that this promise from time to time hath had its accomplishment
but he neuer promised that she should be placed there alwaies no more hath it fallen out so
on the contrary god hath promised that

there should be wings giuen to his church that shee might fly vnto her place before the dragon
and whereas the lord hath commanded vs to empty our grieuances which wee haue against her brethren in to the bosome of the church when priuate reconciliation is impossible this commandement is of the nature of those which alwaies haue this condition vnderstood when the thing is possible
the lord had regard to the time wherein he liued and hath prescribed a law which ought to be obserued but alwaies the possibility of obseruance supposed and an estate of the church semblable to that in his time when the church discipline was not as as yet corrupted in this point
this commandement then presupposeth not that the church should alwaies be obvious to the eyes of men but that in the case propounded recourse should be had vnto her when shee was so

as for the pastours of the church they are called the light of the world not alwaies in relation to the effect but to the duety as they are called also in this respect the

salt of the earth beecause they were ordained for this purpose and are bound to this duty
but then when they are in effect the light it is a spirituall light not discernable but to the eyes of the soule mindes of those which are spirituall of those which

are in the house as our saviour expresseth it
so that none of these considerations can yeeld a sufficient argument for the perpetuall outward visibility of the church neither in the whole nor in her parts

chap
xxiiii
that the church of god was before the last reformation where shee was and who were her pastors

bvt if they will needs presse vs further yet dema~d where our church was exta~t immediately before our separatio we tell the that shee was in babylo in captivity vnder the kingdome of antichrist
a come out of babylo my people it is written in the revelation the people of god were then in babylon albeit they served not the gods of babylon and which is more their teachers were the teachers of babylon
if this seeme strange to any ma let him call to minde the estate of the iewish church before our saviour had begunne his preaching
might it not at that time haue beene demanded where the church of god had beene before and who were her pastours what could one answere to this query might it haue beene said that the scribes and pharises and their adherents the greater part of the people were the church alas they were nothing lesse they were enemies of christ and church the true answer then had beene to say that the church was a small number of righteous persons which groaned vnder the burden of that spirituall tyranny which lamented the desolation come

vpon them by the corruption of the ancient doctrine and discipline
that the doctors of church were the pharises of whom the lord testified that they sate in moses chaire
now we say the very same thing
that god before the reformation begun in the daies of our had a church in the midst of babylon in the midst of the popish and antichristian church but that this church howsoeuer was not the multitude of those who had received the

marke of the beast and worshipped it but the small

company of those which misliked the roman tyrannie and corruption of whom some from time to time being detected haue beene banished others cruelly put to death and slandered to haue beene guilty of horrible and hainous crimes to make their persons odious to the people their memories execrable to posterity had not god by his providence maugre the subtiltie and furie of calumnie preserved the monuments of their faith and pietie even vnto this day
such were the poore waldenses constrained to wander to fro such also were the exiled albigenses

concerning that which is further demanded of vs who were the teachers of the church during that time so full of confusion then when babel raigned we answer that questionlesse the holy ghost alwaies instructed his church

inwardly and that outwardly they were the very same which taught publikely namely the doctours of the romish church
but some man may here say that by consequent they were true teachers to which we answer that in some sort they were true as the scribes and pharises were both true

teachers and seducers true when they sitting in moses chaire teaching his doctrine the people receiued wholsome instruction by their ministery seducers when they sitting in their owne chaire teaching their owne traditions their owne inventions they

who the people whom

god had not chosen sucked in the poison which they tempered
thus it was in the iewish before the lord had begunne to manifest himselfe to the world otherwise god had not had a
this being true and evident it should not be necessary sollicitously to insist vpon a farther answer to the demand how this could bee when there is an agreement about the thing it is curiosity to inquire after the manner of it

yet that we may leaue no scruple behinde we will tell them after what manner god vseth false teachers to instruct his people
the scribes and pharises propounded the word of god and read it amongst the iewes before the comming of our saviour so much as was necessary to salvation but they mingled their leaven with it they thrust in their expositions glosses and traditions the true church sustained her selfe with the word and reiected the leauen the false glutted her selfe with the leauen and let passe the word
what strange matter is there in all this the sheepe in their pasturage where there are some venomous and others convenient for this nature knowe well how to choose that which is proper for them let alone that which is hurtfull and shall the sheepe of christ be vnfurnished of this discretion they of whom it is said

that they heare his voice knowe it

follow it and fly from the hand of a stranger

who then will wonder any longer that before the great reformation which the lord hath begunne in these latter daies as it were in the decrepite age of the world the church hauing truth propounded vnto her mixed with lyes hath embraced the truth and reiected the lyes
surely this truth hath sounded alwaies in the church it hath beene in the mouthes of the romish doctours as the benediction was in the mouth of balaam
this truth that there is one god creatour and preserver of all things that the father sonne and spirit distinguished but not divided are this god that the vniverse being created for man and man after the image of god he by his sinne hath drawne vpon himselfe anger and malediction
that the of god hath taken our nature vpon him and in it hath expiated our offences that all which beleeue in him which repent in syncerity obtaine mercy
that therefore we ought to loue so mercifull a god to call vpon him to giue him thankes
thus farre the scribes and pharises were in moses chaire in the chaire of the prophets of christ and his apostles thus farre they were to be harkned to
thus farre the church did heare them but whilst they added to this truth their lyes to this spirituall bread their leauen then they sate in their owne chaire they were to be heard no farther then the true church stopt her eares against them the false she listned to them
thus we answer to this importunate questixon how may this be

by the same reason also we are not perplexed for

an answer when they aske vs what is become of our forefathers this interrogatory proposed by the pagans to the first christians extorted from them an answer odious in the mouthes of children speaking of their parents that god was marvellous in his waies but in all likelihood they were damned
thankes be to god we are not driuen to such straites
in paganisme there was nothing which might saue no word of grace and mercy in the doctrine published in the church of rome there was something to chosen and they who picked it out carefully and applyed it to their vse were saued
why should wee doubt but that many thousands of our fathers did it god hath knowne how to preserue a church to himselfe in the midst of the most horrible apostacies confusions and desolations happening vnder the old testament since malachie
should his arme be shortned vnder the new no but

eternall as he is he is alwaies like himselfe

now then let the importunate curiosity surcease those questions framed only to distract the simple where was your church where were your pastours our church was in babylon and her teachers for want of better were the teachers of babylon
concerning that which they trouble vs farther with why therefore we haue not imitated our forefathers example why we are come out of babylon if they were saved in it we will giue reasons for it hereafter

in their proper place

of the true succession of the church what it is that it dependeth not of succession either naturall or politicke
now because they mainely oppresse vs with the preiudice which they make against vs about succession which they say is of great moment and pretend moreover that they haue it and that we haue it not that they haue continued alwaies that we are lately come in by the by crossing their line of succession let vs consider what strength this pretence for them exception against vs may haue

now that the ambiguitie of the word may not intangle vs we must knowe what kinde of succession they meane
if it be a naturall succession from father to sonne from generation to generation we say that the succession of the church dependeth not of such a succession
it was and is still the prerogatiue of the obstinate iewes that they are the successours of the

patriarches and prophets in respect of carnall and naturall generation yet they are farre enough from being the true church
they haue succeeded their religious ancestors in being men this succession is naturall
they haue not succeeded them in being faithfull men this succession is spirituall
if they vnderstand a politicke succession in respect of the place and auctority one succeeding another in order and without

out interruption we affirme that the church is not fastned to such a succession

how often doe the prophets complaine that the people of israell their kings and priestes were all gone out of the way and quite disordered by idolatry albeit their kings were successours of good kings and their priests of good priests
the scribes and pharises enioyed not they this kind of succession which we call politicke were they for all that the true church yea were they not

seducers of the people corruptors of the law sworne and deadly enemies of the lord and his doctrine
now against this truth so evident it is impossible they should reply any thing but it will be very friuolous
if it be said that malachie prophesieth that

the priests lips shall preserue knowledge that the people shall seeke the law at his mouth wee answer that in that place there is not contained a prediction of an after euent but a declaration of a duty
for indeede presently after the prophet accuseth the priest for hauing gone out of the way for causing the people to stumble
a manifest proofe that these words the lips of the priest shall preserue knewledge haue no other emphasis the to signifie that the lips of the priest ought to preserue knowledge
there is nothing more freque~t in scripture the to propose a duty in the future tense
almost all the commandements of god runne in this forme
thou shalt haue no other gods before me thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven image thou shalt not take the name of the lord thy god in vaine
he that should inferre vpon these formes of speech that these co~mandements shall never bee broken would hardly proue himselfe a reasonable creature

so the true succession of the church is not alwaies ioyned to this politicke succession which of it selfe without the succession of piety is like to the succession of darknesse to light of sicknesse to health of an infectious aire to a wholesome of barrennesse to fruiullnesse of a tyrant to a good prince
that ought to be accounted the true succession which is the of truth
to haue the same minde and opinion is to haue succession of the same seate not to haue the same opinio is to be contrary in respect of the seat
the succession of the seate hath but the name of succession the succession of opinion hath the truth of it

said nazianzane and in saying so hath taught vs in what sense the lord would haue the

scribes and pharises to be heard as sitting in moses chaire to wit when they tought like moses so farre as they are the successors of moses in doctrine
but that hindreth not but that he hath commanded also

to take heed of the leauen of the pharises when they sit not in his chaire but vpon a stoole of their owne making

but what hath the church of god then no certaine succession on earth yea the lord hath said

that as the substance of the oke and teyletree is in that which they cast so the holie seed shall be her substance
but this succession is not tyed either to the naturall or to the politicke succession but it dependeth onely of the free disposition of him who turneth riuers into a wildernesse and the water springs into drie ground a fruitfull land into barrennesse for the wickednesse of them that dwell therein who turneth the wildernesse into a standing water and drie ground into water springs

chap xxvi
that the popes authority is not originally deriued from the apostles
bvt to come nearer to this matter the romish church hath no kind of lawfull succession not that of gouernment and policie not that of rites and ceremonies no not the succession of persons least of all that of doctrine

shee hath not that of the policie of the ancient church for in the ancient church there were no popes no cardinalls no patriarches no not archbishops and bishops after the romish fashion
all the apostles in respect of the power of the keyes and authority of the apostleship were equall
if there were any difference betweene them it was not in respect of their function
for it they were all

ioynt tenants immediately to the supreme apostle the prince of apostles the lord iesus
from him they all immediately receiued the same commission to teach all nations the

same power to forgiue sinnes
their names were equally written vpon the twelue foundations of the high ierusalem

they are placed vpon twelue thrones not subalternate but coordinate in the same pitch emine~cie

of the same dignitie even as the twelue tribes
they are said constantine the great in the councell of nice twelue pillars not then vnderpropped by one another but which being ioyned together bare vp

the edifice of the church
be it that the lord hath promised the keyes of the kingdome of heauen to st peter he

hath bestowed the same power vpon the other apostles be it

that he hath prayed that his faith might not faile he hath

prayed also for all the faithfull be it that he hath exhorted him thrice

to feede his sheepe this was because he had denied him thrice

a triple deniall wanted a reestablishment he which had stumbled thrice was to be lifted vp thrice
shall any extraordinary priuiledge be allowed him because of this reestablishment must those seruants which are most frequently and earnestly put in minde of their duties for this be supposed to be in greater auctority shall they be placed in a degree aboue the other nay they themselues interpret it on the contrary and take it for an angrie dislike their superiours haue of them they are vexed for it with st peter and if their masters could see in to their hearts as his could they would say with him

thou know'st that loue thee thou know'st that desire to serue thee finally be it that the lord hath said vnto him

thou art peter and vpon this rocke will build my church

the most ancient and most renowned amongst the fathers teach that christ vnderstood not the the person but the confession of st peter not peter viz the rocke which co~fessed but the rocke by him confessed viz iesus christ our lord
howbeit wee willingly confesse that the church hath beene built vpon st peter but not vpon him onely
he is one of the foundations of the church but not the onely foundation of it one of the twelue

pillars one of the twelue iudges of the twelue tribes israell but not the foundation of these foundations the pillar of these pillars the iudge of these iudges but a collaterall foundation a collaterall pillar a collaterall iudge with the other apostles his companions
furthermore st peter vndertooke not to depose kings or to vsurpe any such authority contrarily he hath ioyned these two duties together

feare god honour the king how heathenish a tyrant soeuer and persecutor of the church the emperour at that time was

he had no dominion likewise ouer the other guides of the church whome he calleth his companions in office

now albeit st peter should haue had that authothority which is attributed to the pope at this day yet they are still to proue that it died not with him
and if his authority of suruiued him not how much lesse that of being the prince of the apostles if the other apostles in regard of their haue not left themselues successours how should he leaue his iurisdiction ouer them behind him he had the gift of doeing miracles to whom hath he particularly bequeathed this faculty can the pope doe any miracles he was the apostle of the circumcision is the pope the apostle of the iewes these offices of the apostles were extraordinary like that of moses which was extinguished in his person and did not outliue him
as then the bishop of ephesus should idely haue challenged to himselfe the authority of iohn the euangelist the bishop of alexandria that of st mark albeit that tradition report that these

two apostles had bishops for their successors st iohn at ephesus st mark at alexandria even so the popes vnreasonably vsurp the authority of st peter vnder pretence that tradition maketh them his successors
so that in this respect the papall monarchie hath no apostolicall succession seeing that not only it hath not had its originall in the times of the apostles but also this kind of soveraigntie was a long time after vnknowne in the church

st cyprian calls cornelius bishop of rome his collegue and and the other bishops coepiscopos or the fellow bishops of cornelius

he blameth him for hauing receiued those which the other bishops whom hee calleth the fellow bishops of cornelius had excommunicated hee sets before him the statute of the discipline of those times inioyning that the cause should be iudged where the crime was committed a statute which he groundeth vpon iustice and equitie vpon the commission giuen to all pastours and the power which euery one of them hath by vertue of his commissiion ouer that portion of the flocke which is assigned him of which he is to giue account vnto the lord
likewise he sharpely reprehendeth stephen also bishop of rome teaching that as there is but one church through out the whole world deuided into many members viz particular churches so there is but one bishopricke diuided into many particular bishopricks
he attributeth the same authority to the other apostles with st peter

although to denote vnitie it was said to st peter will giue thee the keyes of the kingdome of heauen

it is not then to the person of st peter but to peter as representing the vnity of all the apostles
of which mind also are

st hierome and st austen

the synod of alexandria addresseth their synodall epistle not to the bishop of rome in particular but to him conioyntly with the other without the interposition of any distinction betweene them
athanasius neuer calleth him otherwise then his and comminister his fellow bishop and fellow minister
hosius subscribed first to the canons of the nicene councell not as representing the bishop of rome but generally the westerne churches after the same manner as the bishop of alexandria those of egypt lybia pentapolis hosius was not there then to represent the vniuersall bishop of the church but to represent the churches of the west as every of the other bishops churches of a particular circuit or iurisdiction as it may more amply be seene by their subscriptions
lastly that which hapned vnto the pope in the sixt councell of carthage puts all out of doubt

and admitteth of no reply
a certaine lewd companion named appiarius deposed from his ministeriall function and preferment by the bishops of africa repaired to zosimus then bishop of rome who hauing reinstituted him and deeming this a fit occasion to enlarge the bounds of his dominion graspeth it fast and posteth this appiarius reconfirmed with his embassadours to the councel of carthage giuing them moreover in commission to demand that the vniversall authority of the pope should bee acknowledged by the councell alleaging to that purpose

a canon of the nycene synode
vpon these passages zosimus dying eulalius is chosen in his place by the greater part of the clergy and people but he gaue place to the violence of boniface who out of his ambition prosecuted that which zosimus had demanded touching the acknowledgement of his primacy
the councell flatly denied that there was any thing in the records of the nicene synode which might favour his pretended primacie and in the mean time sent commissaries to the patriarchs of constantinople and alexandria to haue a sight of the authenticke copies of the acts of the councell which were kept by them
vpon this pope boniface died
celestine succeeded him who also with the like heat claimed the approbation of his fained authority
but the councell having already discouered by the report of their commissaries that the authenticke copies of the nicene synod contained no such matter as the proud bishops of rome required blamed their fraud checked their insolencie and adiured them to receiue no more appeales adding this notable reason that the grace of the holy spirit would not bee wanting to any province

vnlesse some man imagined that god could inspire iustice to one only and that he would withhold it from an infinite number of bishops

now this history maketh it appeare vnto vs that vntill that time the churches of africa had not acknowledged the pope
so that if at this day there were any in those parts of the world which did acknowledge him they should not be their successours in this
if the pope hath beene from the beginning

vniversall bishop how happened it that at that time he was not vniversally obeyed by the church but it is no lesse remarkable that the popes which required this acknowledgement from the councell sent not men to expostulate with that assembly by authority much lesse to excommunicate them vpon their refusall as schismatickes as also that they alleaged no scripture for the primacie but onely the canon of a councell
yet they vsed a strange boldnesse in daring to falsifie the canons of the nicene synode a fraud yet of which their successours seeme to haue beene ashamed
for in the decrees of the nicene councell as we haue received them from them there is nothing extant which maketh for the primacy but in them the other patriarches are rather equalised to the bishop of rome
lastly the harsh censure with which this councell entertained the pope which neverthelesse was but provinciall witnesseth it not that at that time his authority was new this being so seeing that succession must drawe its line from the first and that the first romane bishop had not that authority which he hath that now raigneth it followeth that there is no succession in the and by consequent not in the whole state of the papacie

that the cardinalls patriarchs archbishops bishops priests deacons monkes and nunnes of the romish church are not of apostolicall institution

after we haue examined the succession of the supreame degree of authoritie in the church of rome come wee now to the inferiour orders and first to the cardinalls
who is so ignorant at this day as to thinke or so impudent as to affirme that their institution was in the times of the apostles or that their office such as it is at this day was in the church a good while after the age of the apostles
the church increasing there were created by the principall churches

presbyteri cardinales that is to say principall or chiefe elders
diaconi cardinales principall or chiefe deacons
their office was limited within the iurisdiction of the church where they were created if at rome within the iurisdiction of the church of rome if at carthage within the iurisdiction of the church of carthage
their charge was a superintendency over the common elders and common deacons
the cardinalls at this day haue nothing of it but the name their charge is quite of another nature their institution is altogether different
they are now the electours of the pope which they were not anciently except those of the citie

of rome as making a part of the clergie
now they take care of the affaires of all those churches which are obedient to the pope anciently their charge was bounded within the circuit of one church alone
howsoever it's true indeed that by hypocrisie they beare now adaies certaine titles which seeme to assigne and to binde them to certaine parishes in rome to the end that they may retaine if not the truth yet the name of what they were anciently
anciently their authority allowed them not any degree aboue bishops now they are as it were princes of the bloud in the church next to the triple crowne
so then the cardinalls haue no succession deriued from the apostles and by consequence neither the church of rome in respect of this part of her policy

as for the patriarchs there were none of them also in the times of the apostles nor a long time after
only we read in the decrees of the nicene councell

that their iurisdiction is called an ancient custome a tearme very different from an apostolicall tradition
moreover the patriarchs were supreame and equall to the bishop of rome in iurisdiction he was but their companion albeit he were first in order
all the other patriarchs haue long since renounced the communio of the roman church the pope also will no longer be accou~ted a patriarch
the patriarchs which are at this day in the romish church are elected by the pope who hath no power to choose the seeing that at their first institution which howsoever was not apostolicall they were his fellowes in authoritie
so the patriarchs of the romish church haue no lawfull succession

their beginning being not not from the true beginning the times of the apostles yea not from the primitiue institution of patriarches

the romish archbishops and bishops at this day are nothing like those ancient primitiue ones say not onely in respect of their manners but also in respect of their authority
their authority at this day dependeth barely of the pope anciently it was not subiected but to the companie of bishops they might not be deposed but by the common consent
they were not bound to runne to rome for their election but they gaue their mutuall aduice one to another both in the election and deposition of a bishop
anciently they had no such authority ouer the magistrate as they at this day vsurpe
it's worth the observation to see how matters are changed
their authority in respect of the pope is become slauish in respect of the magistrate tyrannicall this is their comfort that they haue gotten on the one side that which they haue lost on the other so they would haue it choosing rather to be subiect to one who is far from them and whose greatnesse dependeth of theirs then to many which are neare them and whose lustre might obscure theirs
in regard of this order therefore there is no succession in the church of rome

in the ancient church there were elders tearmed presbyteri from whence came the name of prebsters priests but the priests of the romish church retaine nothing of them but the name
their principall office was to

teach and instruct where as the romish

priests for the most part are vnlearned idiots and by consequence are no otherwise successours of those primitiue ones then darknesse pouerty sicknesse succeed light wealth health
now this default cannot be excused by alleaging that it is the fault of the persons for so it is in ecclesiasticall functions that were the incapacity of the person is the function cannot bee
call here the incapacity not simply the fault of the person but the impossibility of discharging the function
the woma which hath no milke cannot be a nurse and if she take the office of one who hath vpon her this cannot be in the qualitie of a nurse shee cannot be a nurse beyond the name
so he which hath not in some sort the abilities requisite for reaching he cannot possibly be a teacher if he succeede one that could and did teach he succeedeth him not as teacher but onely in his name
moreouer the principall part of the priests office consisteth now a dayes in mumbling of masse and in being sacrificers of which there is no mention in the primitiue ordination of priests

in the ancient church there were

deacons now there are deacons archdeacons subdeacons
but what haue these people of the ancient deacons beside the name take they any care of the poore yea they suck their blood by a cruell and importunate exaction of their reuenues
doe they serue tables yea themselues are sumptuously attended at their owne
in a word seeing they doe not the office of the ancient deacons how shall they be their successiours

concerning monkes and nunnes there will

be found a syllable in scripture to signifie that there were any in the age of the apostles

st hierome who hath much extolled this profession fetcheth its originall from paul the hermite a faire time after the apostles
if else where he referreth its beginning to a time more ancient he contradicteth both himselfe and the truth

being carried away by the excessiue affection he bare to this profession
howsoeuer the monkes of these times cannot iustly be accounted the successours of these monkes which st hierome so much commendeth what maketh a monke

sayd he within citties these not onely abide in citties but euen in them build citties

in st austens time it was theft for a monk to beg now it is an especiall point of their sanctifie

in st cyprians time it was not vnlawfull for him who had vowed continencie to marry afterwards now it's a matter monstrously hereticall except when the pope dispenceth with it who like a god vpon earth can doe whatsoeuer it pleaseth him and more also then god in heauen for he can make vice vertue and vertue vice by his dispensations

chap xxviii
that the ceremonies of the romish church are not of apostolicall institution

if we consider the ceremonies of the romish church we shall quickly see that the ancient simplicity and apostolicall purity is not to be found in her that those decent

customes of true antiquity are either quite changed by her or so extreamely abused that they are made vnprofitable
in the flourishing time of the apostles there was nothing vsed in baptisme but water afterwards there was added chrisme and since that salt spittle
what successio haue these additions these new superfluities seing they had not their originall at the first institution of that sacrament the channell pipe as it were of succession here grew faulty and receaued in this stinking water running athwart
the disguisement which they haue put vpon the holy supper is yet more prodigious they haue miserably and vnhappily mangled it they haue cleft the seale of the king of heauen in the middle and cast away the one halfe of it
what is it that superstition dareth not to venture vpon we haue the institution cano of this holy sacrament recited by three euangelists and by st paul
can there be any thing more pure more simple lesse stuffed with superfluous superstitious ceremonies lesse accompanied with pomp compliments now compare with that purity simplicitie that nakednesse as may say of ceremonies the histrionicall pomp the apish gestures and anticke trickes of the masse can there be any thing imagined more vnlike vnto it and disproportionable what succession then may be conceiued or acknowledged where the dissimilitude is so great but a succession of evill to good or corruption to purity

moreouer what shall we say of their superstitious consecration of chappels altars pixes fonts chalices plates vestiments holy oile holy bread holy water

of their beads agnus dei images of their christning of bells of the hallowing of ensignes and swords
from whence will they fetch the institution of these trumperies had they a heart of lead a face of iron a of brasse yet they would not dare to affirme that any of these fopperies were in vse in the age of the apostles what succession then of them can they pretend lastly their processions their stately pompe at funeralls so proud and magnificent that now they fondly liue and die altogether came it from the apostles yea is it not a relique of the paga superstition

that there is no succession in respect of doctrine in the romish church
bvt the worst of all is that they destitute of the succession of the truth which is the soule and life of the church

true antiquite beleeued

that they which die in the lord rest from their labours they beleeue that at their departure out of this life they goe to purgatorie there to fry in as scorching a fire as that in hell

true antiquity beleeved that

when we shall haue done all that which is commanded vs we are but vnprofitable servants because wee shall haue done no more then was our dutie to doe

they teach that man already culpable before god may merit eternall life ex condigno by exact proportion of the worke of the wages

true antiquity beleeued

that the sufferings of this present life are not sufficient to counterpoise the glory which is eternall

they beleeue that they doe counterpoise them in merits
antiquitie beleeued that we are saued freely
they beleeue that we are saved by the merit of our works

antiquitie beleeved that we are saved

by grace through faith and that not of our selues it is the gift of god not by workes to the end that no man might boast

they beleeue that we are saved partly by grace through faith partly by merits and workes that faith is partly the gift of god and partly an effect of our freewill

antiquitie beleeued that we are not

saued by workes of righteousnesse which we haue done

they beleeue that we are saved ex congruo by the workes which we doe before our regeneration and ex condigno by those which follow it

antiquitie prayed the lord

not to enter into iudgement with his servants because that before him no flesh shall be iustified

they beleeue that the lord shall enter into iudgement with them for they beleeue to be iustified by the merit of their workes

and apostolicall antiquity beleeued that

gods election was every way free that election is of grace that if it be of grace it is no more of works otherwise grace were no more grace but if it bee of workes it is no more of grace otherwise workes were no more workes

they beleeue that it is of grace and of works too

antiquity beleeued

that it is god which effectually produceth in vs to will and to doe according to his good pleasure

they attribute both the one and the other in part to their owne free will

antiquitie beleeved

that we are not able to think any thing of our selues but that our sufficiency is fro god

they attribute our sufficiency in part to our owne selues

antiquity beleeued

that wee can doe nothing without christ

they beleeue that we can without christ while we are not yet engraffed into him doe workes which merit eternall life ex congruo as before our regeneration and that without the grace of god a man may for a time be without sinning

antiquity beleeued that

of our owne nature wee are the children of wrath they beleeue that by the strength of our owne nature we are able to prepare and to dispose our selues for grace

antiquity beleeved

that before christ hath quickned vs we are dead in sinnes they beleeue that we haue freewill to good

antiquitie beleeued that

the spirit fighteth against the flesh and the flesh against the spirit that they are contrary things in vs

they beleeue that we are able to fulfill the law of god perfectly that is to say without sinne

antiquitie beleeved that

the lusting of the flesh

is enmity against god and cannot bee subiect to the law of god

they acknowledge even in the flesh a freewill to good

antiquitie beleeued that christ

prayed not for the world but for those whom the father hath giuen him out of the world

they beleeue that it is no certaine number for which the lord hath prayed but that he prayed indifferently for all

the ancients beleeved that all they who haue

heard of the father and haue learned of him come vnto christ and that no man commeth vnto him vnlesse the father drawe him

they beleeue that they who come not to christ haue heard of the father as well as the other and that there is no grace nor particular election in the calling and conversion of a christian

antiquitie beleeved that it is christ which

chooseth vs and not we that choose him

they on the contrary beleeue that wee choose christ for they make that grace by which hee calleth vs to him vniversall and suppose it indifferently proposed to all so that in respect of christ there is no election seeing he promiscuously calleth all but that we choose of our selues to goe vnto him
whence that is alwaies in their mouthes fac vt praedestineris si non es praedestinatus make thy selfe predestinated if thou art not

antiquitie beleeued that god

hath mercy vpon whom he will haue mercy and compassion of whom

he pleaseth to haue compassion that hee hath mercy on whom he will haue mercy and whom he will hee hardneth

they bereaue god of this liberty and accuse them of blasphemie who attribute it vnto him

antiquitie beleeued that they who fall away who goe

out from among the faithfull were neuer of the number of the faithfull for if they had beene of vs saith iohn they would haue tarried with vs

they beleeue that they who are truely faithfull to day may fall away to morrow and that no man can be assured of his perseuerance

antiquitie beleeued that wee haue

not receiued the spirit of bondage to be againe in feare but the spirit of adoption which cryeth in our hearts abba father

they beleeue that the spirit of the faithfull is a spirit of feare that they must alwaies liue in doubt that to haue a setled assurance is presumption

antiquitie beleeued that whosoeuer beleeueth in

christ hath everlasting life

they say that he who beleeueth in christ cannot be certaine of life albeit the lord hath said it which is in effect to beleeue that wee must not beleeue in christ for how shal he beleeue in christ who doubteth whether christ loueth him or not whether christ will loue him continually as they teach him to doubt

antiquitie beleeued that there is no

feare in loue and that perfect loue casteth out feare

they commend feare in those which ought to

burne with loue not that feare of offending god that filiall feare but a feare of being damned a seruile feare

antiquitie beleeued that there is but one naturall body of that composed of the substance of the blessed virgin
they would seeme indeed to beleeue so too but by the multitude of their hosties or sacrifices each of which they is christs body attributing vnto him also of bread they betray their dissimulation and shew themselues to beleeue the quite contrary

antiquitie beleeued that the

of the was broken bread they beleeue that it is the bodie of christ which is not broken

antiquitie beleeued that the heavens must containe christ vntill his second comming

they beleeue that the body of christ is evey where where their

antiquitie that those were not to be beleeued which should say

here is christ there is christ he is in the secret chambers

they thinke and say the contrary every day when they haue him about the streets when they carry him to the sicke when they shut him vp in the pixes

antiquitie beleeued that

iesus christ is offered but once they beleeue that he is offered a numberlesse number of times

antiquitie beleeued that it was

impossible christ should be offered often vnlesse hee suffered often
they beleeue that he is offered every day without suffering

antiquitie that we haue but

one mediatour towards god
they beleeue that we haue many

antiquitie beleeued that

we ought to call vpon none but him in whom we beleeue
they beleeue that we must call vpon many in whom it is not lawfull to beleeue namely the saints and saintesses of paradise

antiquitie beleeued

that wee may with a sound heart in a full perswasion of faith yea with boldnesse goe to the throne of grace that we may obtaine mercy and finde grace to helpe in time of need

they teach that it is presumption that we must vse the mediation of the saints to god as we doe the intercession of court favorites to the king

antiquitie beleeued

that only god knoweth the heart
they beleeue that the saints knowe all our secrets

antiquitie alloweth not prayer for the dead wee say true antiquity which is the scripture for it teacheth that

after death commeth iudgement which must be vnderstood immediatly after for otherwise one might say as well that after our birth commeth iudgement

on the contrary they beleeue that iudgement commeth not immediatly after death and vpon this opinion they ground their prayers for the dead
antiquitie beleeued that that which entreth in at the mouth of a man defileth not the man
they beleeue that eating of flesh in lent defileth the man

antiquity beleeved that to

command abstinence

from marriage and certaine meats is a doctrine of divells

the romanists command and practise both

antiquitie beleeued that

images were not to be worshipped

the romish church is full of such idolatrie

antiquitie beleeued that god is to be worshipped in spirit and truth

the romish church thinkes there can be no religion where there is not a multitude of ceremonies

antiquitie beleeued that he which

laboureth not should not eat

the greatest saints amongst them abstaine from and are most idle

antiquitie beleeued that it was

a more blessed thing to giue then to receiue

they beleeue farre otherwise for the most holy amongst them place their felicitie in povertie

antiquity beleeued that it was expedient to

pray to god against poverty

they beleeue that its best to vow it

that there is not so much as the succession of persons in the church of rome

bvt how will this matter goe if it appeare that they are destitute not only of the succession of ecclesiasticall policie of the succession of ceremonies of the succession of

doctrine but also of the succession of persons if it hath fayled in the popes themselues shall it not by the same reason haue fayled in the whole body depending of them now he that would deny that this succession hath not beene interrupted amongst the popes he must impudently venture to deny also the outragious schismes made by the antipopes whilst there were two sometimes three who claymed this successio
it cannot be said that only one of them had it for what's then become of the churches that depended on the other popes shall they be excused by the pretence of their because every one of the beleeued that they depended on the true pope
this good intention then shall excuse the donatists

for they thought they adhered to the succession of the apostles and why should not the same excuse the protestants also seeing they beleeue verily that their ministers are the successours of those pastours which the apostles planted in the primitiue churches

it is to no purpose to produce here the example of barbarius philippus who being a slaue his determinations which he gaue during the time of his iudicature were currant neverthelesse even after he was discovered to be a slaue
for there is not the same reason in the ecclesiasticall functions
civill functions depend of the approbation of men these of god
the popes the being not true popes but vsurpers before god could haue no authoritie whatsoever men esteemed of them
it is as idle to alleage the example of iudas because that although he were a wicked man yet he was a lawfull apostle not an intruder but one

lawfully called to the apostleship which ca~not be verified of those popes which were thrust out thrust into the

genebrard goes farther then all this when he pronounceth all those popes vnlawfull in whose election the emperour of germany bare the sway although there were many of them succeeding one another without ever being deposed

the succession then hauing fayled in the popeship as may so speak seeing the pope is the head of the whole body of the romane church it would be labour in vaine to shew that it hath beene personally interrupted in his members who haue no other succession then what is derived from his

that its meere wrangling to demand by what authority one requires an holy reformation

bvt be it say they that we haue in so many kindes degenerated from the purity of our ancestors who gaue you authority to reforme vs who hath appointed you iudges over vs see them againe at their preiudices
so the pharises anciently the lord
in what authority doest thou things but what haue wee done that they should presse vs so much to shew our authority we haue espied the wolfe in the fold we haue cryed the enemie not at the gates but in cittadell and we haue sounded alarme
we haue

observed the traytors and fingered them out
to proceed thus farre there needeth no other authority then the zeale of the honour of our soveraigne lord of the peace of his ierusalem and prosperity of his house
if the wolfe hath made no spoile if that man of sinne hath not taken possession of the temple of god if the watchmen of israel are not become gluttonous and drowsie dogges then our zeale hath beene without knowledge yea not zeale but madnes
we intreat them to giue vs leaue to make it appeare that we cryed not out but vpon a iust and necessary occasion if we cannot verifie this let vs bee condemned
but let vs not be thrust back vpon the simple preiudice of want of authority in our persons to giue warning and advise it is insteed of all authoritie to knowe how to giue it seasonably
he that can shew that he hath given an opportune and necessary advertisement sufficiently purgeth himselfe from the crime of rashnesse
here then is the pith of the matter to examine whether we haue so proceeded or no this being cleared the question touching authority will be found to be but a wrangling quirke craftily invented to make vs loose the principall for who doubteth but if that the desolation of the outward face of the church hath beene so lamentable as we pretend that every one ought rather to striue to succour it with some timely remedie proportionably to the measure of his skill then to make it worse by dissembling it in the common wealth if any one arise against the ordinary officers of the king this is called sedition rebellion treason but if this insurrection bee

occasion'd by a treason attempted by those officers against the king and state if this be verified it is no longer a crime but an heroicke exploit and an example of loyalty so much the more famous by how much lesse note and authority he was of who vndertooke and atchieved it

it is as truely as commonly held that the divine power is evidently manifested where the strength of man by reason of the meanesse of the person could not come betweene
if a person not authorised by degree and licence should vndertake to controle the advise of lawyers and physitians in their owne professions he is not accounted rash if hee doth it with reason especially if he doe it according to the canons and rules of art but he is esteemed and respected so much the more as he hath lesse commendation elsewhere then from his owne deserts
how much more yet is he reverenced if he doe it in time of need in matter of great moment when it standeth vpon life and death should not such an one be advanced and for his skill and fidelitie worthily be promoted into their roomes who are vnworthie of them both for their ignorance and vnfaithfulnesse if this be practised and that profitably in the of the world for the supreame law is the service of the king and safety of the people shall not the same bee practised in the church in divine affaires which concerne the glory of the king of kings the eternall safety of our soules the importance of the gaine or losse being infinite
it is ordinary law of nature that heavy bodies descend as it were to their center the place of their rest conseruation

and yet this law is subiect to another more generall law of nature which commandeth that there be no vacuity against the ordinary law of nature so that rather then there should be any emptinesse light bodies will sinke downe and heauy bodies will mount vp iust so it is in ecclesiasticall and ciuill affaires
in the church it is an ordinary law that every man in it follow his calling hold his ranke keepe the law prescribed him to avoid confusion which must needes arise from each ones intermedling with anothers function
but this law is subiect to another more vniuersall law of more importance and necessity which commandeth every one to forget his ordinary condition and to abandon his priuate ranke that he may goe against some extreame evill and keep backe some irreparable losse when it cannot otherwise be avoyded then by this seeming breach of his ranke
say seeming for indeede hee which vpon a reasonable and vrgent occasion quitteth his place quitteth it not but keepeth it hee should abandon it in not abandoning in this case euen as heauy bodies should either moue or rest against nature if they forsooke not their ordinary centers to ascend aloft when by their ascent they should hinder a vacuity so the souldier who being ascertained that his captiane hath traiterously deliuered the gate to the enemy should superstitiously keepe his ranke and not set vpon his captaine hee would not in effect in this case keepe his ranke but whil'st hee would doe the duty of a souldier hee would bee found to haue committed the act of a traytor

that they whom god imployed in the reformation had an outward calling and that albeit they had not had it if they were otherwise furnished with the gifts requisite for such a businesse this defect ought not to be obiected against them

if wee iustifie our selues vpon these tearmes why should wee be accused of sedition in the church if being but priuate persons as they make of vs wee haue ventured vpon the common officers if being but common souldiers as they tearme vs wee haue performed the office of captaines so farre as to deny them our obedience and to make warre with them as with the enemies of our king and disturbers of the peace of his spirituall commonwealth and finally as against traitors
although in truth the first repairers of the ruines of the church in the time of our forefathers were not iackes out of office or common souldiers but men imployed in the principall functions of the church
in england all the bishops in germany the most doctors of the church as also in switzerland of whom others are descended here it is replyed that if these men had a true calling then there is a true calling in their church and consequently they shall be the true church

to this wee answere that if there may be a true baptisme without the true church why may there not be also a true vocation is the vocation lesse compatible with the false church then baptisme doubtlesse where is baptisme there is a power to administer it and where this power is there is a calling
none can seale vnlesse he be a keeper of the seales no man is so vnlesse he be called to it
the seales of the church are the sacraments no man can seale in the church but he who hath commission for it
they acknowledge that our baptisme is effectuall and reiterate it not what heretickes soever they account vs wee pay them the like when wee make that calling sufficient which our predecessors receiued from the the right of which they haue bequeathed to posterity
to allow then our baptisme what is it but to confesse that wee may baptise and what is this but to confesse that we haue an ordination a calling to baptise

but their reply furnisheth vs with a stronger argument against themselues when we presse them either to confesse that they are not the true church or to yeeld that the calling receiued amongst them was lawfull
it cannot be concluded that there where there is a true calling there is also the true church
witnesse the ten tribes revolted the church of iudah in the time of the idolatrous kings in the time of our sauiour christ in which the levites alwaies had their calling albeit they executed it amisse
but it will be good logicke to argue that where there is no calling there is no true church witnesse the multitude of pagans and infidels amongst whome

being true calling there can bee no true church
here they are faine to take sanctuary in another shift that the calling of the first reformers was nullified by the corruption and alteration of that doctrine for the preaching of which it was conferred vpon them
but see they not that this reply giueth vs as much as wee desire namely that setting aside the question touching ordination they accuse vs for hauing altered and corrupted the doctrine of which accusation if we purge our selues why perplexe they vs about outward ordination seeing they yeeld by their reply that wee haue that prouided that wee haue not lost it by corruption of doctrine as also on our side if wee iustifie not our doctrine we will yeeld to the that we haue no lawful calling amongst vs that our predecessors lost it assoone as they brought a change into the church
if they reply here that the question is not whether our pastors at the beginning of the reformation altered the doctrine of the gospell but whether they altered that of the romish church for the preach+ing of which they were sent
to this wee answer that the teachers in the roman church are called indeede to publish the doctrine of the same church but vnder the title of the gospell of our lord iesus christ
this doctrine then being not commended vnto them but as supposed for euangelicall if they come to discouer that it is not so they are no longer bound to teach it but to teach that doctrine which is correspondent to that title vnder which the other was falsly commended vnto them

surely if our doctrine be true albeit wee had not the

ward calling yet wee were to be heard if it be false though wee had this externall mission as wee haue it yet wee were not to be hearkned to but abhorred
why then come they not directly to this point why beginne they not with our doctrine can there bee a better argument against a phisitian then to proue that he is vnskilfull or that he is an impoysoner or against a lawier then that he is ignorant and corrupt or a better meanes to procure credit to a physitian or authority to a lawyer then the proofe of their ability and fidelity what doe degrees and licences profit a a phisitian or lawyer if they be both witlesse and dishonest what doe their not taking of degrees in case of necessity disadvantage them if otherwise they are skilfull and honest so it is with the teachers in the church if they are of sufficiencie they are to be receiued though they haue no testimoniall of their externall ordination and if they haue not this sufficiency be it that they make it appeare that they were outwardly sent yet this would be but a humane mission an authority bestowed by ignorant man which the lord disalloweth who sendeth no man whom he hath not endowed with gifts necessary for the execution of the charge in which he imployeth him
he is not like those hucksters of degrees worthy to be banisht out of commonwealths who for the most part license those not whom desert but whom bribes and by respects commend
so then where this diuine mission hath place there is also suffciency where sufciency is not found wee may conclude that there is no diuine mission
now if this sufficiency be found

in our teachers if it be not found in the greater part of the romish pastors wee shall haue on our side an argument and testimony of diuine ordination they only of an humane an vncertaine institution because he that conferreth it may be either so deceaued by his ignorance blinded by his affection or perverted by his malice and wickednesse in such a manner that he may call him whom god calleth not and put by him whom god calleth

chap xxxiii
that the example of the first reformers openeth no gap to confusion seeing they had the outward calling and that albeit they should not haue had it the misery of those times excuseth yea iustifieth that defect

neverthelesse here diuerse difficulties throw themselues in our way
that it must necessarily breed confusion to permit euery man to exercise that charge of which he is capable without being orderly called vnto to it
that the example of the priests in the ancient law is contrary to it who being fallen from god yet no man was permitted to substitute himselfe into their roomes
that the example of commonwealth is against it in which no man is suffered to take vpon him any office of what worth soeuer he bee vnlesse he be legally deputed to it
that there will be no danger in ioyning with a schismaticall church if to

be true ministers of the church it sufficeth to haue the truth and purity of doctrine
from these obiections they conclude that outward mission and vocation are absolutely necessary vnlesse they are supplyed by some other circumstances as the gift of miracles or prophecying

but wee easily wind our selues out of these difficulties by shewing that our first reformers had the calling which was at that time ordinary that therefore they gaue no example of into the priests office seeing themselues were priests nor of vndertaking the execution of a charge without a patent seing they were priuiledged and licenced to that function which they vndertooke hauing beene called to be ministers that no man may take occasion by their example to be schismaticall because schisme is a separation made without a lawfull cause and the separation made by them was most iust for the apostacy heresie idolatry cruelty of the romish church
to the verifying of which we beg that wee may be admitted because the manifestation of this is the onely proofe of our innocency
if the church of rome be not apostaticall hereticall idolatrous cruell if wee make not this accusation good let vs be condemned for schismatickes in separating from her for heretickes seing that our separation hath beene grounded vpon the co~trariety betweene our doctrine and theirs

but because in the former chapter wee haue principally reckoned vpon sufficiency and occasion to exercise this sufficiency so farre as to thinke these two

circumstances the notes of divine calling and sending let vs suppose that which was not that the first which god employed in the worke of reformation had not an humane and outward ordination let vs consider if that therefore they indiscreetly vndertooke a businesse of such consequence and whether the reasons to that purpose bee of any weight
it is a saying in their mouthes how shall they preach vnlesse they bee but this hindreth not but that he who is sent by god may ofttimes be thrust backe by men
our lord was not only reiected but euen persecuted to death by the scribes and pharises the apostles were entertained with the like contempt the like crueltie and which of the prophets is it said the lord to the iewes which your fathers haue not in the meane time it is certaine that no man may thrust himselfe into a charge in the church without mission
but the controversie is about the nature of this mission whether it be humane hauing its approbation from men or diuine hauing its approbation from god in a tolerable estate of the church god hath established an order which he would haue to bee kept euen as kings and princes in their dominions who though they might by their authority install their officers immediately yet they will haue them passe through certaine formalities which they haue for orders and for preventing hasty and crafty surprisalls
but when their state is disturbed when their officers are combined against them when all order is perverted and these formalities haue no longer place the prince immediately

setleth his officers in their places it sufficeth them for all patents to be authorised by his commandement
so it is in the church god will haue every thing done in order so farre as it may be obserued but when confusion hath turned all vpside down he forbiddeth not to looke to the maine chance though it be without a methode but commandeth to sollicite the principall businesse the more zealously because there is lesse possibilitie of compassing it the ordinary way
methode is commendable in all things but when exigences are so violent that they make it impossible nature lawes customes instruct vs to betake our selues vnto that which is most necessary

this then is not to giue example to tumultuous persons or to open a gap to confusion for he is truely tumultuous who contemneth order not he who cannot finde it he who neglecteth it without any good motiue not he who is constrained to passe over it
it supposeth then not introduceth a confusion to permit the exercise of a function to one who is capable of it destitute of a humane calling then when the calling is impossible the exercise of the function necessary
but whilest the ordinary formalities may bee obserued and the case is not so vrgent as to exact an extraordinary proceeding it would be truely to open a gate to disorder
so it maketh no way for sedition in a citty or mutinie in a campe to permit that in case of treason the citizen should rise against the subordinate magistrate the souldier against his captaine without any other commission then his owne private motion if he cannot haue time for a more formall course

confusion is only when without this case this licence is permitted
so the first obiection drawne from the inconvenience which the liberty of not observing order and formes of law when it is possible draweth after it cannot disadvantage our predecessors although they were not furnished with an outward calling seeing they were driuen to such plunges as gaue them not leaue safely to follow the methode of law

for the affaires of the church being at that passe that heresie and idolatrie bare the sway that they which had the outward calling not only exercised it abusiuely but which is worse hauing the authority to conferre it they bestowed it not vpon those who would and could exercise it aright keeping backe as some times the pharises did the key of knowledge shutting vp heaven gates neither entring in themselues nor suffering any other to get in it was necessary then albeit they had no outward calling in an extraordinary case to venture vpon an extraordinary proiect
st paul had foretold that there should come a falling away so notable that by a kinde of singularity he calleth it

apostacy
not then one heresie one sect a part by it selfe for there had been already in his time such fallings away but a revolt which should ouerspread the face of the church so that she might hardly be espyed through the thicknes of so horrid a cloud
now who are those which were to oppose the~selues against this revolt doubtlesse not the apostates themselues not they who persevered in this revolt but they who separated themselues from it who protested against it be it that they either had authority amongst

the fallen away as the levits amongst the tenne revolted tribes or be it that they had it not
but they will say perhaps we our selues haue made this revolt let this then be our question the preiudice laid aside and then we must come to the examination of doctrine which is all that we desire

chapter
xxxiv
that the example of the priests vnder the law cannot be drawne into argument to proue that a man may not sometimes exercise a function in the church without an outward calling
the second obiection which they make against vs is that as it was not lawfull to occupy the roomes of the priests in the ancient law even during their revolt so it is not lawfull for any man in the revolt of the doctors of the christian church to take the place of a doctour
but there is not the same reason betweene the pastours of the christian church and the priests of the iewish church
their function was typicall carnall and therefore fastned to certaine typicall and carnall circumstances of times places and persons they were not to sacrifice but at a certaine time it was not permitted but to a certaine race to exercise the priests office and that in the land of iuda only

the administration of the gospell is reall spirituall free from all circumstances
preaching may bee in all times at all places by all men of ability who both may and ought to preach when it's requisite
salvation depended

not vpon the carnall and typicall administration the ceremoniall sacrificing in the law the omission of which the circumstances of times places persons requisite for the businesse ceasing as in the time of captivitie of it selfe endangered not mens soules as doth that of the of the word which the lord even vnder the old testament set free chaining it not to these conditions to such a time such a place such a person because it is simply and absolutely necessary to salvation
whence it was that there were teachers out of all the tribes of israel who although they supplied not the defect of priests for so much as was typicall and ceremoniall in their charge as in offering of sacrifice this part of their charge being especially to their persons neverthelesse in that which concerned teaching and instruction they were substituted for aid and releefe and were to make good those stations which the others had forsaken
witnesse the prophets and the sonnes of the prophets being indifferently of any tribe witnesse the pharises whose calling our saviour alloweth censuring only the abuse of it who were not only of the tribe of levi but of all tribes of which st paul furnisheth vs with an example in his owne person being of the stocke of beniamin and yet a pharisee borne of a pharisee
and indeed if here were fit place to alleage the ancient law against this truth as it was not lawfull but for one tribe to execute the priesthood of the old testament and but at a certaine time only and in a certaine place we should by the same reason circumscribe the calling of ministers vnder the gospell

with the same limits and girde in their liberty with the same fetters making it requisite that they should be of a certaine family and exercise their calling at a definite time and place
whence it is manifest that the priesthood of the old testament cannot be brought for an example when the controversie is about preaching vnder the new that being tyed to certaine circumstances from which this by the propertie of its nature is freed

chap xxxv
that the example of iudges in a commonwealth is impertinent to proue that outward ordination is alwaies necessary in the church
it is to as little purpose to produce the example of a iudge in a commonwealth where no man what necessity soeuer there be what ability soeuer he hath may presume to thrust himselfe into that office without being called to it

for besides that wee haue formerly shewed that in the time of confusion the king installeth iudges himselfe not binding them to passe through the vsuall formes there is moreouer this difference to bee considered
the exercising of the office of a iudge deriueth it's force and efficacy from his authority whence it is that the determinations of iudges are not executed because they are iust but because they are sentences and determinations bee it that they

are giuen iustly by the wisdome and equity of the iudge or vniustly by his ignorance or corruptnesse but the vertue and power of the ministeriall function dependeth not of the authority of him that practiseth it for if he be ignorant or hereticall one who willingly slighteth his charge and vilifieth his own function an hucster of gods word as the apostle speaketh his authority will not make that when he hath proclaimed peace peace there shall be peace by by as well as the sentences of iudges how vniust or silly soeuer they are faile not for all that to be put in execution
on the other side if he who exerciseth the function be both of ability and fidelity though he want the formality of an outward mission it being impossible for him to obtaine it and that which he doth without it being necessary he faileth not effectually to instruct exhort and comfort

it fareth with him as with a phisitian whose authority giueth not his doses and recipes vertue to worke¬∑ and in working to heale but it is his skill honesty which direct him in choise of such prescriptions as are proper for the cure which is the fruit of his labour and the end he proposeth vnto himselfe
otherwise euery graduated phisitian would without any more adoe cure the sicke if it were the authority of the doctor and not the vertue of his physicke which did the cure the choise and application of which dependeth of his knowledge and fidelity
whence it commeth to passe also that if the phisitian be skillfull and carefull the want of authority in his person hindereth not the operation of his doses
from whence

by comparison it may be obserued why in a iudge outward authority seemeth to be absolutely and simply necessary and why in a pastour notwithstanding that authority which dependeth of humane authority is not simply necessary namely because whatsoeuer a iudge doeth he doth by that authority which is lent him from a superiour his abilities but enabling him to doe that aright which his deriued authority maketh him doe effectually but in a pastor if he be sound in knowledge and conscience the administration of his charge doth alwaies it's work as effectually and compleatly as if it were backed and graced by humane authority
it is the good phisick which healeth the good milke which nourisheth whether the phisitian hath taken his degrees or not whether the nurse were approved of by a phisitian or no these circumstances as they bring nothing to the point so they take nothing from it
now the gospell is a medicine saith the prophet milke saith the apostle the authority then of him who applyeth this medicine who giueth this milke to suck or drinke say the authority the commendation of men can neither augment nor diminish their vertues¬∑

but some will say that although that authority which dependeth of outward mission be not alwaies requisite in pastours yet at least this defect ought to be supplied by miracles here they call vpon vs for our miracles
but we aske them againe where are the miracles of iohn the baptist

of whom it is written that he neuer did any miracles
as for that after his conception he leaped in his mothers wombe at the

presence of the blessed virgin mary bearing in her wombe the lord of the world this was not done to authorise confirme his office in to the execution of which he entered a long time after
when miracles are done to make some enterprise authentique they are done either immediately before it or else they accompany it while it selfe is in hand they are done also publiquely exposed to the view of all that they may be the lesse suspected for impostures
but to answere precisely wee say that when the gospell was first to be planted miracles were very necessary but that being finished their necessity ceased
the miracles wrought to authorize the gospell anciently retaine still at least amongst christians their vertue for that effect
if then wee prooue that wee propose the same gospell those ancient miracles are ours
let them admit vs then to this proofe in which if wee faile wee will confesse then that they haue good reason to call vpon vs for miracles yea more then this that wee were not to be beleeued though wee should doe very strange ones
for wee read that the coming of antechrist shall be with signes and wonders but wee read not that they who oppose him shall worke miracles so that if wee should make a trade of doing miracles or as it were of them this would make vs not more iustified but suspected

chap xxxvi
that the example of the first reformers fauoureth not schismatiques
there remaineth yet the fourth obiection that it seemeth that this doctrine touching the true markes of diuine calling to wit sufficiency a necessity to imploy this sufficiency fauour encourage schisme
but wee tell them that this cannot bee
for seeing that he who maketh a schisme hath no necessity to make it this note agreeth not to a schismaticall teacher who in a tolerable estate of the church erecteth a church apart seeing that then he emploieth his gifts without necessity for the beaten way lying open what need hath he to betake himselfe to new but this way being stopt vp to our predecessors it followeth that they were driuen to a necessity which presseth not schismatiques
certainely there is no schisme where their is a iust occasion of separation an impossibility of proceeding otherwise now we say that such was the misery of the times of our predecessors that they had iust reason to separate themselues thar albeit they had beene vnprouided of that outward vocation which they had yet it had beene impossible for them to proceede otherwise then they did
if they offer to deny this truth wee offer to make it good hither wee desire to be admitted setting aside the preiudice if wee faile in our proofe wee refuse not to be accounted schismatiques

chap xxxvii
in what sense wee yeeld that the church of rome hath the substance of true religion and how shee ceaseth not for all that to be a false chuch

yea but at least wee yeeld to them that they haue baptisme that they haue the substance of christian religion from whence they conclude that they cannot perish that wee who haue separated our selues from them haue gone schismatically to worke
this argument they frame from that confession which they thinke they haue extorted from vs let vs see then what trueth strength it may haue
first concerning baptisme they confesse that wee haue it that it may be amongst heretiques antiquity beleeued it wee beleeue it with antiquity
they reiterate not the baptisme administred by vs wee reiterate not the baptisme administred by them this priuiledge aduantageth not vs against them why should it aduantage them against vs the true circumcision was in the church of the ten tribes it was not for all that the true church an hereticall church shall haue baptisme yet for all that not cease to be a false church not in respect of the baptisme but of her heresie not in regard of that which is pure in her of the lords institution but in regard of her rebellion against the lord her owne impurity
that they haue baptisme then wee graunt but so wee say haue all heretiques

so the ten tribes after their apostacy receiued circumcision¬∑ this exception then is friuolous when they pretend that wee confesse that they haue the baptisme craftily dissemble that which wee adde that they haue adulterated depraued it as much as in them lies
concerning the substance of christian religion wee confesse that it is also amongst them but not pure nor separated not only from chaffe and straw that is from tolerable abuses but neither from the venome and poison of false doctrine
now it is no schisme to forsake a church wherein is the substance of religion if it be accompanied with superstition impiety and sacriledge as gold and siluer in false coine are mingled with copper aad tinne
it is true that the church of rome teacheth that there is one god father sonne and holy ghost that for the redemption of mankind the hath taken to himselfe the nature of man and in it hath expiated our sinnes by his death that he was buried raised from the dead taken vp into heauen sitting at the right hand of god almighty that the holy ghost sanctifieth vs there is a church a communion of saints a remission of sinnes a resurrection of the flesh and a life euerlasting
that by faith wee must rely vpon the mercy of god that by hope wee must expect the accomplishment of his promises by charity loue him
this is indeed the substance of christian religion which continueth so farre as the doctrine and outward profession of it in the church of rome in this respect wee haue not forsaken her but these considerations make vs leaue her the title of a church to which soe

farre wee will alwaies be ioyned
but what is it that hath not beene added to corrupt this truth what strange doctrines haue beene inuented to obscure it what heresies what idolatry what grosse sacriledge vent they vnder the protection of this truth which they professe
these are the causes of our separation from them if amongst them wee could haue enioyed the substance of true religion without defiling vs with their superstition wee had tarried with them still
but in these later times after the lord had lifted vp the standart of his gospell and sounded with his trumpet come out of babilon my people since the angells haue flowne in the midst of heauen carrying the euerlasting gospell and crying with a lowd voice blessed are they henceforth who dye in the lord for they rest from their labours and their works follow them not to runne to this standard not to obey this summons not to goe whither wee heare this inuiting voice call vs in breife not to come out of babilon to goe vp to ierusalem is a rebellion against the liuing god and a manifest contempt of his grace¬∑ before this the faithfull whom god had reserued to himselfe in the captiuity of babilon as a residue of the election of grace though they were not separated from the superstitious yet they were from their superstitio their groanes and sighs seruing in steed of protestations against it because that the lord had not yet opened them away by which to come out nor as yet prepared them a place into which they might withdraw themselues
in a word the time preordained by god to put an end to that miserable captiuity

was not yet come
as then it was not a sinne to tarry in egypt before the lord had sent moses or in babilon before the seauenty yeares were expired but god hauing sent moses hauing giuen liberty to his people to come out of egypt to come out of babilon to tarry there still had beene manifestly to testify a consent to the superstition of egypt and idolatry of babilon so before the lord had sounded vs a loud summons with his trumpet come out of babilon my people he sustained and supported his people in the midst of babilon it was not at that time a sinne but a captiuity to abide in it
but for any to abide or linger in it after the publishing of this summons it is a sure testimony that they liue not in it vnwillingly but with delight and that at least outwardly they partake of her sinnes and so may iustly partake of her plagues
now to demand why god caused not this trumpet to be sounded sooner is to dispute against him it were to bring back those ancient questions propounded to the primitiue christians why the lord iesus had not brought the light of the gospell sooner into the church to which st paul clearely answereth when he teacheth that the fullnesse of time was not yet come
why the lord called not the gentils sooner vnto his knowledge to which the same apostle answereth noe more then that god hauing winked at the time of ignorance now warneth every man to repent

he hath the times and seasons in his owne disposing

it often falleth out that they who cannot goe out of an infectious citty tarry in it and are safe but for all

that they that haue opportunitie to goe out of it will not take example from them to tarry in it
the sheepheard will lead his sheepe into pastures where are noxious hearbs rather then he will suffer them to bee famished but if he haue the opportunity of leading them elsewhere where no danger is to be feared the good lucke that god gaue him of preserving them in an vnwholsome pasture shall not disswade him from taking of them out of that to put them into a better
that which the shepheard doth to his sheepe we are to doe to our selues so long as there was presented vnto vs no other place of pasturage then the romane church for want of a better wee were compelled to make vse of that
but the lord hauing graciously vs a better miserable are we if we leaue not that and betake our selues to this
in the time of a famine men liue pinchingly and wretchedly but the dearth being past and plenty restored hee that will not take the benefit of it deserueth to be starued to death
let this consideration then serue for the solution of the difficultie aboue proposed

chap

that there is nothing which deserveth to be admired in the life of the monkes of the romish church

now it remaineth that wee examine their last preiudice
they haue amongst them a swarme of religious creatures of both sexes who preferre povertie before wealth seuerity

of discipline before the tender delicacy of pleasures humility and contempt of the world before the greatnesse and pompe of it who being sequestred from the turmoiles and tumults of secular affairs liue here on earth like angells in heauen
who deny nature that which she exacteth of them macerate their flesh and tame it in such an austere manner that it serveth the soule no longer but for a sheath or case snatched vp already to heauen in affection and contemplation and not tarrying here belowe but after the fashion of angels during their soiournement on earth
or if their be any thing else which may set it forth more admirably its all say they to be found in the angelicall and heauenly life of monkes and nunnes

soe extoll the vertue of their drugges affirming them to be nothing but elixers balmes antidotes even against death itselfe
now the confident boldnesse the smooth behauiour and eloquent pratling of the mountebanque hath this faculty to make the praises of his druggs pausible and receiuable to the simple and dimme sighted vulgar
but experience confuteth them discouering at last the impudent knauery of these cosening quacksaluers
soe the turkes vaunt of their religious folke of the sanctity austerity and extraordinary devotion which seemingly shineth in their whole conuersation
let vs heare not a turke but

a a monke by profession who had resorted to them and obserued their fashions who hath described their superstition a witnesse not to be suspected in this point
some of

them saith he shew an exceeding great patience weare noe habit goe naked not couering any thing but their priuities of so great perfectio that they are impassible testifying their patience by brand markes made by burning by scarres made by launcing some of the eate and drinke very seldome others altogether forbeare both some are so poore that it's said they thinke not at all on earthly matters others neuer speake and purposely auoid the company of men least they should be vrged to speake one of which sort saw not without admiration
others haue the gifts of vision others of reuelation some haue raptures and supernaturall extasies or traunces
and by this meanes there is no man amongst them which acquireth not some spirituall skill and experience and according to the diuersity of this skill which they professe they are distinguished by their habits and manner of being
if there be seene any amongst them wearing feathers on their heads this noteth that they are giuen to meditations and reuelations
if any of them weare a patcht habit this is a signe of their pouerty
they which were rings in their eares shew by this that they are submissiue in spirit for the frequency of their raptures
if they weare chaines about their neckes and armes this testifieth the violence and vehemence of their raptures some of them liue sequestred others associated some liue solitary inforrests and desarts others in citties vsing hospitality
where may these be paraleld who can produce any thing outwardly at least in shew so holie and austere amongst the christian monkes

what could they answer here if the turkes should goe to outbraue them after this fashion vsing the same pretence against them which they vse agianst vs will they say that this sanctitie is but hypocrisie that this austerity is but savage barbarousnesse as indeede it is no better
but this is our defence against them when they goe about to oppresse vs with the preiudice drawne from the consideration of their monkish holinesse and austeritie
what great matter haue you say wee in this respect which those barbarous miscreants the turkes haue not nay which is more what haue yea wherein you are not by them exceeded will they answer vs heere that they haue the christian faith and religion but so wee shall haue vnmasked them of this preiudice so wee shall force them to come to the triall of doctrine
the monkish life shall not iustifie the religion of the romish church but they must goe quite backward and iustifie the monkish life by that religion from whence it borroweth its worth and dignity
so wee shall haue fetcht backe the disputation to its true point to the examination of the truth thrusting aside that which advantageth the cause of the turkes as as it disaduantageth ours

but let vs draw a little nearer to this seeming sanctity and austerity let vs looke stedfastly vpon it and see whether it were not painting which deluded our view whil'st wee stood farther off whether it be not a cunningly contriued outside adorning an vgly and prodigious inside
first of all what kind of pouerty may wee imagine this to be where no man is in

trouble or anxiety to procure himselfe wherewith to cloath himselfe against the cold couer himselfe against the heat replenish himselfe against hunger to refresh himselfe against thirst to physicke himselfe against sicknesse may this be tearmed pouerty without mocking both god and man if this be pouerty what is abundance nay say they but these goods are possessed without appropriation no man hath any thing to himselfe be it so doe they therefore enioy the any whit the lesse
enioy wee not all the sunne the glorious lamp of the world enioy wee not light in and without diuision what are wee therefore poore destitute of light or rich abounding with it what shall wee say of the aire and water are wee in penury of these elements because wee haue not them enclosed vnto our selues because wee enioy them in common monkish pouerty then is nominall pouerty but reall abundance

but their discipline is rigid and seuere here wee call the world to witnesse yea wee appeale vnto the~selues in this point
wee will not rub vp the ancient reproches of their gluttony drunkennesse whoredome adultery sodomie
but let the world iudge let them speake themselues whether they obserue this austere discipline whether those ruddie cheekes those white fleshie hands those liuely sparkling eyes that spritefull vigor of the whole body testifie a rigorous maceratio taming of the flesh or whether that iollie plight be not rather an effect of ease mirth good cheere and a compleat entertainment of nature yet forsooth we must beleeue that they poore

hearts fast extreamely that they lash themselues vnmercifully that they lye vpon the bare cold hard ground that they grate their skinnes with sackcloth
and questionlesse some few of them doe that which they all professe to doe but what a great peece of worke is it if custome at first allaies at length quite steales away the sense of these miseries
there is an excellent discourse to this purpose well worth the observation in the worke which chrysostome hath left de sacerdotio

that is in the language of our times of the office of a bishop
where he making a comparison betweene the reall vexations in that office and these seeming tortures in the monkish life which wee deny not to haue beene in respect in his time but many waies differing from this in our time he telleth vs that it is to be seene by experience that there are many who without any paine or discontent make a shift with very poore fare and very hard lodging principally such as being of a kind of rough course nature haue alwaies beene brought vp so but not onely such in as much as a good able constitution of body and custome soften and sweeten the roughnesse and harshnesse of these extremities euen to those who formerly haue beene more daintily brought vp

surely so it is
those who are of a more tender and crasie constitution faint vnder these austerities and either lose their liues amongst them or else retire out of them by a dispensation those of a stronger and and more solide tough complexion not onely goe through stitch with them and make them tolerable but in the end find them not onely easie

but which is more delightsome
it's a matter to bee wondred at that no man bestowes an admiration vpon the patience of the galley slaues which is so great that they sing in the midst of their greuious toyle so voluntary that they oftimes refuse their libertie and chuse to tarry in the gallies whereas to see a lazy fellow well couered to shew his naked feete vpon condition of warming them when he listeth all are amazed as if this were some extraordinary exploit quiet surpassing humane strength
wee daily see poore drudging laborours toile and sweat and with painefull sighes keepe time as it were to their worke wee see them with a greedy glad appetite deuoure course bread nourishing the~selues with such victual's as wee would hardly vouch safe to touch in a word wee see them in appearance even to kill themselues with irkesome labour yet no man wonders at it no man pitties them because wee all know that custome hath dulled and blunted in them the apprehension of wearisomenesse and paine
what then doe wee wonder at what extraordinary matter is there to be obserued in the patience of the monkes that they must needes be so much admired is it because from their labour their ariseth no profit or commodity to their neighbour whereas by the paines of drudging laborours and toyling mariners the life of man is comforted the society of men is vpheld and maintained what then shall wee admire a labour in vaine¬∑ an vnprofitable fruitlesse toyle and disesteeme that which is not onely profitable but also necessary
but by their austerity they testifie their

patience very likely why doe they not till the earth then why row they not in the galleys is not there an ample subiect enough for the to shew their patience and to doe some seruice to the world beside into the bargaine were it but in putting themselues into the place of many poore slaues whose naturall infirmities make their seruitude insupportable or if that be too much haue they not a fit opportunity to tame the flesh in the vineyards of the next neighbours to their couents in the fields at haruest time at the presse in time of vintage by this meanes both to ease the poore and to make some recompence for those almes which they get so easily by begging this would be both to subdue the flesh and profit the world both together
that other discipline so much talked of may be iustly suspected because it hath no regard to the profit of another
he who may with the same paines tame his flesh and serue his country is vngratefull and vncharitable if being able to vndertake this course he neglecteth it
but the truth is that they refuse not this kind of exercise but onely because it is lesse pleasant then their owne

chap

a resolution of certaine doubts which may be framed concerning some things in the precedent chapter

bvt it will be said that the labour of secular men is not voluntary
why so why is it lesse voluntary then that of the monkes is it because they cannot exempt themselues

from it when they list why this trow is the monkes case to
or is it because they are forced to follow that hard kind of life whereas the monkes bound themselues to it with vowes voluntarily made
surely there is no difference betweene the yet in this respect
despairing discontents melancholicke dumps the feare of parents the hard dealing of kindred the simplicitie of youth the desire of avoiding some disgrace or trouble which is like to come vpon vs if we tarry abroad in the world are vsually the first motiues and which giue the first impressions to them who aspire to the monkish life
when these considerations haue once staggered vs and set vs a wavering it is an easie matter afterwards to perswade our selues that that course of life to which we are now addicted bee it what it will is the most compendious path to perfection and the ready way to paradise
but after that men are once entred into it and haue engaged themselues in it then some come to discouer the vnhappinesse of their choice they befoole themselues at leasure perceiving those places to be but vncouth prisons within which while they beheld them without seemed princely palaces
but now it is too late they are fast enough in the stockes and fetters bolts barres double gates the goaler and keepers take away all hope of getting out
so the fishes which tosse tumble within the nets seeme to play and sport to the others which behold them without
but the desire of being partakes of that sport hauing once allured them in they quickly perceiue what is become of them

but some man will say if it be so how commeth it to passe that we heare none of them complaine that we perceiue not any of these votaries by sighs and moanes to discouer their repentance and dislike of their profession
surely it is because no man proclaimeth his owne folly but every one is most carefull to hide it especially when it is remedilesse
he who hath beene vnfortunately married will not discover the inconveniences which he findeth in his marriage if hee can possibly cover them because it cannot bee done without some shame and disgrace
discontents of this kinde doe not evaporate by exposing them to the winde
to this sort of vnfortunate weights there remaines no comfort but only to procure their miseries a reputation of not being
so merchants willingly dissemble their losses especially those which come from their owne rashnesse and indiscretion
so the divells who are comforted if they draw many to hell vse not to tell how hot it is there

that the profession of monkes is not a note of true humilitie and that their life hath nothing angelicall in it

we see then what kinde of povertie the povertie of monks is what kinde of austerity their austeritie is hauing nothing admirable in them nothing which may prejudice their opposites in a matter of so great importance as

is religion seeing there is nothing extraordinary in them nothing which is not common in the ordinary course of life nothing which may not bee both parallel'd and transcended in the most horrible superstitions

but peradventure they are humble contemning the world but whence should that be coniectured is it from their povertie or from the meanesse of their apparell or from their savage kinde of life quite estranged from humane civilitie this coniecture indeed might haue some colour and probabilitie if their povertie such as it is their habit their strange course of life made them contemptible and despicable to the world
but povertie basenesse of apparell and stoicall incivilitie which make any other person co~temptible adorne a monke and make him honorable
aboundance of wealth bravery in apparell fashionable carriage are not honourable in the world but onely because they make him to be honoured who hath them
but if basenesse procure respect and applause it's pride to seeme and ambition to affect basenesse
he spake not like a foole who told the cynick philosopher that he saw his pride through the holes of his cloake because he was so poorely clad that he might be the more respected
there was not anciently any sort of men so proud as that of philosophers with their long beards course cloakes beggerly scrips bare feet like to our capuchins now a daies
the gentrie and common people of those times with a kinde of emulation outvyed one another in a superstitious respect to that idol of gravity that deceitfull

outside of humilitie which inwrapped a prouder heart then the royall robe of alexander
true is seated in the heart and in the inmost closet of the soule shee is not commended by any thing which may bee counterfeited shee is discerned as well vnder the robes of david as vnder the rags of lazarus
but some will say that the monkes would bee more respected then they are if they were not monks
let vs see how true this is what should we thinke of those heauie blockish spirits thrust into a monastery by their kindred because of their vnfitnesse for any thing else that they might not serue for a reproach to the family of which they are descended is it likely these creatures would bee more respected not being monkes what should we thinke of those poore fellowes which if they were out of the covent would hardly finde wherewith to sustaine nature vnlesse they got it by their fingers ends at some base occupation would these be more respected lastly what should we thinke of those more sublimated wits and soaring spirits amongst them to whom the monastery is insteed of a galerie through which they may walke to a bishopricke thence climbe to a cardinalship and thence ofttimes iump into the papall throne would these haue fared better out of the monastery suppose all them hit not this marke could they haue aymed better at it out of the couent it was a pope who before he came to this dignity vsed out of his austerity a net insteed of a bed and now seeing the world to wonder at the change which he had made of his net bed into a fether bed answered that he had caught his

fish
the monkish profession serues now adaies to heighthen adorne the lustre of learning eloquence and the like good parts as shadowes in a picture grace the other colours
mantuan amongst the poets was but the more esteemed because hee was a monke
hath onuphrius beene any whit the lesse admired by his own or lesse esteemed of by the learned aquinas and scotus haue they not beene so much the more renowned because they were monkes

the glory and applause which monsieur du bouchage hath gotten by his monasticke profession haue they not equalled all the honour which he could expect from martiall feats those actions cannot bee true notes of humilitie wherein one sowes a small honour for an assured haruest of a greater but those wherein a man debaseth and deiecteth himselfe expecting no advancement or preferment but in heauen
the praise also of this humilitie is not of men but from god who seeth it in secret and rewardeth it openly
let it be proued vnto vs then that the monks contemne honour and we will beleeue that they contemne the world
it is not to tread the world vnder foot not to plead at barre not to sit in the chaire of state not to beare armes not to serue ones king and country to liue in idlenesse according to the precepts of epicurus but not sollicitously to ayme at not to that honour which is wont to accompany all these professions
the monkish profession cannot bring a testimoniall of such a contempt of the world yea on the contrary it betrayes a great loue of it seeing it is the most certaine and easie way to that honour

which other men purchase with so much sweat and anxiety
finally they tell vs that the monkish life is angelicall but would willingly know wherefore doe the angells vse to be idle during their abode vpon earth yea are they not all ministring spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heires of salvation
are they not busie for the preservation of men but these what doe they it will bee said they spend much time in prayer yea they devoure widdowes houses vnder the pretence of their long prayers as anciently did the scribes pharises
to pray to god and to serue the world are these matters which cannot stand together the patriarchs prophets apostles did not they pray and yet did they not labour day and night for the setting forward of the salvation of men questionlesse their charity is cold and hypocriticall who being able to doe more spend it only in prayers iustly deseruing that their prayers should redescend vpon their owne heads turned into curses

that the profession of monkes is contrary to true pietie

behold now what that so much admired pouerty of monkes is come to their humilitie their so highly esteemed imitation of angells
but if we will but take the paines to acquaint our selues a little better with the mysteries

of this profession we shall perceiue it to be quite contrary to true pietie that it dishonoureth turneth it vpside downe and lastly that the issue of it is to make a man a theefe a whoremonger a proud pharisee

first of all theft is manifest and notorious in it
for the profession of monkes bindeth them not to giue any thing to another it hindreth the sonne from succouring the father the daughter from relieuing the necessities of the mother the rich from possessing that with which they might comfort the poore the wiseman from taking care of the the valiant man from defending his countrie the lawes and religion by his valour yea it hindereth the divine fro preaching for if some amongst them doe preach it is not as they are monkes that license was anciently granted them in the forme of a dispensation
in st hieromes time the office of monks was not to preach but to weepe
to imploy ones selfe in preaching is to bid the monkish life farewell to renounce it in this respect
and if every monke should imploy his gift and talent as doe the small number of those amongst them which preach the monasteries would remaine emptie and these monks would be no longer monks but secular men conversing in the world and busying themselues for the common good of it every one according to his abilitie every man in his ranke station one in pleading the cause of the orphane another in applying convenient remedies for the prevention or expulsion of diseases another in distributing almes out of his abundance one in the exercise of one calling another in another
but the monkes

by their vowes quite disenable themselues for the performance of these offices
some ancient lawes punished certaine cowards which that they might not be pressed for the warre got their thumbs cut off not only for hauing vsed an inhumane cruelty towards them selues but also for hauing cosened the commonwealth of its due
they then make themselues culpable after the same manner who wittingly depriue the~selues of those meanes by which they might giue a helping hand for the reliefe of the common necessities of mans life
we are not placed in this life neither abide we in this world for our selues only but for others also every man for his neighbour
it is the law of nature it's the law of god it's the precept of the gospell that we should doe good to all and especially to those of the houshold of faith
he then who purposely maketh himselfe vnprofitable willingly violateth this law shewing himselfe vnnaturall rebellious against god full of seeking that which is his owne and not the lord iesus any farther then the lips and outward profession

but which is yet more intolerable they make themselues not only vnprofitable but also burdensome they liue vpon other mens labours they depriue those who are poore indeed of their reliefe intercepting that which might and ought to be giuen them
they think it a more blessed thing to receiue then to giue quite contrary to the iudgement of our saviour
they labour not and yet they thinke themselues worthie to liue and be maintained notwithstanding the speech of the apostle he which worketh not let him not eat

they say that their prayers are their taskes their oraisons their businesse
but st austin in his booke de opere monach where he hath taken vpon him to proue that every monke which liues vpon almes and gifts is guiltie of theft hath amply refuted these shewing that the spirituall service of god doth not hinder vs from but incourage vs to labour
the grecians account him not a true monke who is chargeable to others
the abyssin monkes follow the same law
and indeed though the monkish profession be ancient enough in the church yet the idlenesse of monks and their begging is but new
in st austens time some beganne in fauour of them to alleage the example of the birds of the fields of whom the lord saith that they neither sow nor reap

but that good father answereth them as they deserued telling them that hee was of opinion that they might goe as the birds doe to feed themselues in the fields without bringing any thing home with them and that it would bee good if they had wings that they might be affrighted away like stares not be apprehended as theeues

concerning the second point the monkish life doth not quench but nourish doth not cast water but oyle vpon the fire of concupiscence
an honest liberty of marrying when one will if a man be not altogether gracelesse easily spends and exhales this passion and suffereth it not to breake out into flames whereas the constraint by vow taketh away all hopes of vent and shutteth it vp within vs
there is no man lesse troubled with hunger then he who hopes that he may eat whe he pleaseth he who despaireth of it betaketh himselfe

to his owne flesh and as the prophet speaketh eateth even his owne arme
now this is not spoken with a purpose to discouer the secrets of the couent but only to giue a secret glaunce at that which all the world knoweth of it

but what can their fastings and scourgings afford them no remedy yes if they would in due proportion fast continually if they would fast simply and absolutely otherwise for him which hath not the gift of continence to fast by starts and lash himselfe by fits this is but to stirre his disease insteed of remouing it and to anger his sore insteed of healing it there are diseases which are nourished by gentle lenitiue remedies
the anodins such medicines as cast the sicke into a sleep take away the paine for a time but they either kill the perso out right or else the paine returneth with the greater violence as if it had gone backward for a time that it might come forward with a doubled furie
witnesse st hierome himselfe

my countenance saith he was wan by reason of my fasting and my flesh was dead before my selfe and yet my spirit boyled within me with the heat of my desires
did so holy and devout a man out of knowe not what humilitie publikely divulge so base and scandalous a lye of himselfe no no
he spake the truth and thereby how highly soever he hath extolled virginitie vnwittingly confesseth that for concupiscence which is not moderated by the gift and particular grace of continence there remaineth only that remedy set downe by the apostle that for avoiding fornication every man should haue his owne wife and every woman her owne husband

true virginitie is in the soule if it bee not ere principally it cannot be in the body and if it be there it will transfuse it selfe thence into the body whether it be in wedlocke or in a single life
imagine we that st peter married as the most ancient testifie of him was lesse acceptable to god

then st paul vnmarried god measureth not men but by piety where he findeth that equall he is equally pleased with it be it in married or vnmarried persons

what then shall the single life haue no prerogatiue yes questionlesse if it conduce more to pietie then marriage but if it faile in this point it's much inferiour to marriage
now it alwaies fayleth of that in them who haue not the gift of it
there are some saith our saviour which make themselues eunuches for the kingdome of heaven but all men cannot receiue this saying

saue they to whom it is given
which is clearely expounded vnto vs by st paul telling vs that he could wish indeed that all had the gift of continence as well as he but that every man hath his proper gift one in one kinde another in another¬∑ to him then who hath receiued this gift after the same maner as st paul had receiued it his single life doubtlesse will be farre more advantagious then marriage because that to him who is thus qualified virginitie is a helpe for piety marriage would bee but an incumbrance
but to him who hath not receiued that gift in that manner his single life would be but a snare and a trap for by reason of his single life he would burne the apostle tells vs that it is better to marry then to burne
as then marriage serues but for an hindrance

and disturbance to him who hath the gift that st paul had to wit the gift of continence so the single life serueth but for an encumbrance and temptation the danger of which is vnavoidable and deadly to him who hath not receiued the gift of containing himselfe
wee worthily esteeme of the single life of those whome god calleth to it but wee say that no man is called vnto it who is forced to burne in it

wherefore then say they see wee not this single life more common amongst you heere wee could tell them that they should dispute against our doctrine not against our manners that faults in manners ought not to be thrust vpon the doctrine if the doctrine condemneth the that our doctrine approueth not their doeings who being able to containe themselues are married vnlesse they are driuen vnto it by some other vrgent necessity
but wee will answere directly that the gift continence being rare wee are not to wonder if the single life which presupposeth this gift be lesse frequent but rather to admire the wisdome of the apostle who hauing set before vs the conueniences of a single life and the inconueniences of mariage professeth that it is not to ensnare vs
now if wee are not fitly qualified for a single life it is vndoubtedly to ensnare our selues if wee chuse rather to burne in a single life then to quench the fire by marriage
the thousands and wee dare say millions of martyrs both in the primitiue church and in our owne times giue a sufficient testimonie that wee entertaine and embrace not marriage but so farre as it fitteth vs for

our calling
in how base and dispitefull a mann soeuer men calumniate it which of our martyrs was ever held back by the consideration of the sweetnesse of his marriage by the naturall affection towards children by the cares of the world from sealing the gospell with his blood they might all haue liued and many of them might haue liued in all outward content either for honours or pleasures yet notwithstanding all this they preferred death before life torments before pleasures the ignominy shame before the honour and applause of the world
let our enemies be our iudges is not such a kind of death more admirable then the single life of monkes is it not a sure token of a more magnanimous spirit of a more feruent zeale of a more fixed hope of a more vehement loue of a more liuely faith the the single life of these votaries vnchast for the most part and chast onely by constraint
but let us returne to our purpose
as the monkish life tends to make him who addicteth himselfe to it a theefe and a whoremonger vnlesse he hath receiued the gift requisite for a single life so in the third place it is a thing which puffeth a man vp with a wonderfull presumption of himselfe
know the monkes make great profession of humility but how can he be humble who thinketh himselfe able who vndertaketh to merite and beleeueth that he doth merite true humility is for a man to thinke vnworthy to somuch as looke vp vnto heauen these votaries presume to merite it

moreouer true humility is for vs to thinke that when wee haue done all wee are but vnprofitable seruants

these monkish saints beleeue that they doe workes of supererogation and that they merit for others also
what pride is this or what blasphemie god himselfe commandeth vs to loue him with all our heart with all our mind with all our strength they make profession of doing a great deale more then he commandeth vs

in what mood soeuer god speaketh it is imperatiue after what fashion soever he speaketh he cannot but command see in the meane time the monstrous pride of these monkes there are say they some counsells which god giueth to obey which man is not bound vnlesse himselfe please his owne vow alone bindeth him to obedience
who can in conscience thinke thus of the counsells of god without a proud exaltation of himselfe against him was this the ayme of the lord is this the fruit of his familiar mildnesse when he commands in counselling and counsells in commanding deales he so courteously with vs to the end that man should mistake him for his companion that he should misconstrue his commandements and allow them onely the faint emphasis of counsells which a friend giues to a friend without any strongertie of obseruing the
the entreaties of our superiours are commandes if wee either speake or thinke of them otherwise wee cease in effect to acknowledge them for our superiours we proudly exalt our selues against them
and what may wee then thinke of these professors of humility who allow not god that in matter of religion which they owe to men in matter of ciuility
questionlesse this

proueth them not onely proud but also both sacrilegious and blasphemous persons

these things being so how commeth it to passe that such grosse impiety should serue for a pretence to iustify that religion of the which it maketh professio yea seing that it is so farre fro being what it seemed to be at the first view that it is indeede the quite contrary as wee suppose wee haue proued let it serue rather to accuse yea to condemne that religion of which it's said to be the excellency and perfection

the conclusion

we haue at length examined in order all preiudices and pretences which they of the romish church haue inuented to hinder our cause from being throughly exactly examined
it was the onely scope of this treatise to shew that all those allegations of the magnificence vnity antiquity stability continuatio succession the substance of truth the holinesse pretended to be in the church of rome are but friuolous pretences devised to hinder an exquisite and solide enquirie of the truth
if wee haue attained to this scope its all wee could desire the indifferent reader shall iudge of it
for my owne part it sufficeth me that my beareth me witnesse that haue proceeded in it without vainglory without stomack in all sincerity as speaking rather before god then before men
this maketh me hope for his blessing vpon my paines so much the more as he is iealous of his truth

at the clearing of which haue wholy aimed
wherefore humbly entreat him by his spirit to supply all my defects and notwithstanding my infirmities not to faile to accomplish his power by weake meanes whether it be in confirming those whome he hath already called to the communion of his grace or whether it be in awaking others out of their security to the end that they may seeke his truth and in seeking it may find it and in it euerlasting life through iesus christ our lord to whom with the father the holie spirit be honour and glory eternally amen

preface to the reader
since the preaching of the ensuing sermon find that both it and the author have undergone various censures some object unseasonableness against it and others disloyalty and for this reason being not willing to lie under that imputation and being conscious to my self that never entertain'd so much as a disloyal thought am resolved the sermon shall shift for it self but am a little more concern'd to satisfy the world as to its seasonableness because even some of my friends seem unsatisfied
what needed you say they meddle with such a subject why at this time could you not let things run quietly and be content to preach if you must be preaching the principles and motives of and to a good life without medling with controversies and disputes must confess if those principles against which preach'd had no influence on mens lives or were not pernicious to their souls should be of their opinion but being convinced of both this alone is sufficient for justifying what have done
but am resolved to be ingenious with the world and discover the true motives that put me on this subject
found that one of the clergy of dublin though a very loyal person for his imprudent medling with the state had been justly suspended by his diocesan and that the people who seldom know or consider the true causes of things thought this punishment was imposed on him for arguing for our religion the tender sense they have for that put them into mighty fears and despondencies and made them reflect upon the clergy as if they must either decline the defence of the truth which they value above their lives or be silenc'd easily saw what ill effects such surmises might produce and although several private clergymen said enough to satisfie the people of the falseness of the conclusion they drew from that accident yet seeing them still dissatisfied consider'd to remove their jealousies was a work proper for one of an higher degree in the church and being invited to preach at st warbroughs where there is generally a very full auditory was glad of the opportunity of discharging my duty and satisfying the people and convincing many roman catholicks who were then present to spy out our liberty that we had and would take the same liberty as ever to defend our own religion and to shew the falshood of theirs and have some reason to believe that what then delivered had a good effect on their minds both as to the government and the clergy
but must further tell these gentlemen that whatever policy may seem to be in being silent at this time it is too mean and has too much of the world in it ever to be expected from a clergyman especially it cannot from a bishop whose very consecration obliges him to preach and drive away all erronious and false doctrine contrary to gods word and both privately and openly to call upon and incourage others to the same such we believe the doctrines of the present church of rome to be and while we do so it is not to be expected that any worldly consideration should prevail with us to be silent our vows oblige us to the contrary and the charity which we owe to the souls of men is a farther tie upon us to warn them of the danger they bring on themselves by listning to such doctrines or persevering in them though they have embrac'd them
we are perswaded our silence in this case would prejudice our own people against us and the truth and flatter our adversaries with hopes of our going over to them and so confirm them in their pernicious errors let who so will hold such errors truth is truth and must be defended and if the romanists will but do as they would be done by they cannot take this ill at our hands especially while we have not only the law on our sides but also the word of that king who is famous for having never broken it to defend our religion and if they be angry for this we cannot help it
truth is dearer to us then their favour
we look on the supremacy of the pope and his unjust usurpation over kings and his fellow bishops as the fundamental article of popery and it is required by the second canon of the curch of ireland of every preacher to the utmost of his wit knowledge and learning to preach against it four times a year and the twelfth canon further requires that the ministers in all their preachings shall teach the people to place their whole trust and considence in god and not in creatures neither in the habit or scapular of any frier or in hallowed beads medals relicks or such like trumperies
and while these canons stand in force we will we must do our duty according to them and the government would have just reason to take notice of us if we should omit it and till seer better reasons then have yet heard must think my sermon a very seasonable intimation of our resolution of being true steady to our laws oaths and duties and that it will be impossible to withdraw us from those principles of religion which we profess and upon strict and diligent examination know not only to be true but necessary also even in such a degree as to concern the salvation of mankind
and let the romanists take it as they please they must expect a great many such and blame themselves that this does now appear in print because the false representation they made of what was then said hath made this publication of it necessary and these two following letters written to me on that occasion hath convinced me of that necessity
my very good lord your lordships late sermon preach'd at st warbroughs church in dublin has given me an occasion of representing the several censures upon it to your lordship and withal of freely communicating my thoughts to you concerning it
the gentlemen who would pass for the only catholicks in the world censure it as disloyal and tending to sedition the phanaticks are offended because you boldly tell them the truth and lay the blame of our present misfortunes where tis justly chargeable at their doors and there is a third sort of men whom may call the politicians of the age that do not condemn but only censure some things in it as unseasonable and not fit to be spoken in these times
it was my misfortune not to be present at the delivery of it but however upon the experience of above thirty years acquaintance with your lordship can vouch as much for your loyalty as my own and do really in my conscience acquit you from any design of insluencing the people and when reflect upon the saying of st paul gal

if please men should not be the servant of christ
am well assured you discharged a good conscience towards god because you have been so little follicitous to study the satisfaction of the world
however because so many various censures are past upon it already and neither you nor can foresee what misconstructions may be made of it for the future and because some things are reported of it which hear were not delivered to your prejudice think you cannot do your self nor your sermon greater justice than to expose it to the publick view of the world and let it plead its cause against all gainsayers by this you will have an opportunity of vindicating your loyalty against the exceptions of the pretended catholicks your prudence against the temporizing politicians and your doctrine against all that are resolved to write against it and am confident let them begin when they will if you need succours the cause will not want those that shall assist
am your lordships most affectionate humble servant a midensis
this was followed by this second letter
my lord had the happiness to hear your last sermon at st warbroughs and find by my conversing amongst the people that it gave general satisfaction and has done really a great deal of good
they imagine that your lordship by your station and correspondence understands much of affairs and they generally conclude by your behaviour in that sermon that we are very secure in the king's royal word
you would hardly imagine how far this hath quieted some suspicious minds and if your lordship would let your self be prevailed with to make it publick am confident it would contribute yet more to secure the loyalty and quiet the fears of the people and though this may seem unnecessary to your lordship it being impossible any one of our communion should be disloyal without renouncing his religion yet give me leave to inform your lordship that there neither doth nor will want those that having nothing to say to it as it is will not fail to misrepresent it to prevent therefore them if not to satisfie your friends hope you will be persuaded to comply with the request of my lord your lordships most humble and dutiful servant king
from these two letters the readers may see the sence of both adversaries and friends and what effect it had on them and especially the people and by publishing of it hope at least to get this advantage that our adversaries will be afraid to misrepresent future discourses of this kind when they see we have so ready and short a way to expose their lies and let them rest satisfied that notwithstanding their causless heights and the confident brags of some of them that our religion shall soon be suppress'd and the wheadles of others of them by which they think to prevail with us if not to come over to theirs yet to speak nothing in confutation of it we both dare and will justify our selves and our religion against all the little petty arts of defamation or calumny they can use against us and that we believe the chiefest of their strength consists in these
have only this one thing more to add that this sermon is printed as it was preached without any alteration and that it is own'd as the true sence and real expression of the thoughts and heart of the preacher
st paul's confession of faith
epigraph acts
but this confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship the god of my fathers believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets and have hope towards god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust
and herein do exercise my self to have a conscience void of offence towards god and towards man
two things are required in a preacher to be able to exhort with wholesome doctrine and to confute gainsayers the one requires rhetoric the other logic
we cannot have a better president for this than st paul whom for his admirable elocution the infidels took for mercury their god of eloquence come down from heaven and for the profoundness of his matter he is stiled a chosen vessel to contain the mysteries of gods kingdom for proof of this will only instance to you from the of the to the romans to the end of that chapter whereof st austin and eras mus say that never tully nor demosthenes could speak any thing like him there being nothing mean or low in the whole for if we respect the persons here we have god christ at the right hand of the father principalities and powers if we respect the things here we have life heighth depth things present and things to come and if we respect the rhetorical ornaments what interrogations what gradations what antitheses what contraries and what repetitions so that this might justly make up the part of st austin wish that he had seen christ in the flesh rome flourishing and st paul preaching
but need no further arguments this very conflict with tertullus is a sufficient demonstration whereof my text is a part for having clear'd himself from that most odious crime of sedition and evidently proved that the orators accusation was not only improbable but impossible he now descends to the other branch of his calumny concerning his religion that as he was no turbulent fellow nor raiser of sedition in the so he was no setter forth nor maintainer of heretical doctrines or novelties in the church
in the words we have these two parts

his concession in these words but this confess
his confession in these words after the way which they call heresy
and in his confession we have these particulars
the act worship

the object the god of my fathers

the manner after that way which they call heresy

the rule of it believing all things that are written in the law and the prophets

the principal ground of it and have hope towards god that there shall be a resurrection of the dead

and lastly the effect of it and herein do exercise my self to have always a conscience void of offence toward god and toward man
so that if you would have a clear and perfect definition of st paul religion it is briefly this a worshiping of one true god by jesus christ according to the scriptures with a stedfast endeavour to keep the purity of the conscience unspotted in hopes of the future resurrection of the dead
but to proceed

of his concession but confess
from which ingenuous confession of his faith before an heathen we may learn our own duty whosoever will confess me before men him will confess before my father which is in heaven and with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
isaiah prophesied of the times of the gospel that one should say am the lords and another should be called by the name of jacob and another should subscribe with his hand and name himself by the name of israel and tis required that not only every knee should bow but also that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of the father
the want of the means of this public confession made the jews lament when they sate by the rivers of babylon and made jeremy cry out that the ways of zion did lament because no man cometh to the public assemblies
and the thief on the cross for confessing christ was that day with him in paradise for the inward frame of the heart is discovered by outward devotion and he that does not confess his religion when he is put to it either has none at all or does not much care for it
god says not have reserved that have not believed in baal but whose knees have not bowed to baal which shews that he expects a public owning of him as well as a secret believing in him and the devil himself did not tempt christ to believe in him but to fall down and worship him and the three children chose to be burned rather than give adoration to nebuchadnezzar golden image
know naamans example when bow my self before the idol rimmon is much objected against what have said but for answer to this consider first that naaman was then but a novice in religion and had not yet learned to deny himself for god

naaman speaks not of any religious worship to be performed to rimmon but of a civil office to be done to his prince

because naaman knew that this action could not but be scandalous to others and polluted with the circumstance of time and place he confessed it was a sin and desires gods mercy
lastly we do not find that naaman ever did it but only feeling or fearing his own infirmity he desires the prophets prayers either that he might not fall or if he did that god would forgive him to which the prophet assents and that only in such a form of speech as is an usual valediction as go in peace or gods peace be with you
there are two main impediments of this public consession of christ shame and fear
they that are ashamed are such as love the praise of men more then the praise of god
when ulysses taught young neoptolomy the art of lying the youth being of an ingenuous nature ask'd him how it was possible to tell a lye without blushing he answered him that a man ought never to be ashamed of any thing whereby profit may be had
and if we seriously consider it tis strange that any christian should be ashamed of his profession which brings him so great gain as an eternal weight of glory
we have a common proverb that he that is ashamed of his trade shall never thrive by it and tis altogether as true that he shall never save his soul by religion who is ashamed to profess it
tis confess'd the time was when nicodemus came by night to jesus and when joseph of arimathea was a secret disciple but it was when they were punies in christianity but when religion was firmly rooted in them they joyned openly in the honourable interment of our saviour and thus st paul confest he was not ashamed of the gospel of christ
the second impediment is fear
this caused moses to stagger at the commands of god this made elisha fly from the womanish threats of jezabel and st peter deny his master
fear is so bad a counsellor in the service of god that gideon when he was ready to joyn battel with the enemy proclaimed that whosoever was fearful should depart and so timorous christians are not fit to fight the lord's battels therefore tis said the fearful and the unbelievers and the abominable shall have their portion in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone
never heard nor read of a more resolute band of soldiers then those seditious followers of cataline their souls flitted from their bodies before they moved from their stations and the place they fought on when alive they covered with their bodies when dead and the historian tells you the reason was because they carried their riches their glory their life their liberty their country and all their hopes in their right hand
change but the persons and the story is ours for in our christian warfare we bear a crown of glory eternal life spiritual liberty and our heavenly country in our right hand and to him only that overcomes shall all this be given for be thou faithful to the end and will give thee the crown of life
yet neither st paul practice nor my discourse does encourage any to run into unnecessary dangers for he that loves danger shall perish in it
to precipitate a mans self into needless peril is senseless folly and to do it out of ostentation is meer vanity but when a man's profession obliges him to give evidence for the truth to be then neither ashamed of christ nor of his gospel nor fearful to suffer for it is necessary true christian courage
the ancient law of governing the roman army was reduced to two heads nec sequi nec fugere not too ventersomly to make a rash pursuit without need and when there was occasion nor by too timorously running away to betray the cause to the common enemy and thus a christian ought not to seek danger when he is free nor to shun it when it is offered
behold says christ send you forth as lambs in the midst of wolves be ye therefore wise as serpents and innocent as doves
there is a time when the advice of gellius takes place even in religion that when the city labours with sedition tis not the part of a good citizen to profess himself a newter but to join with the party that has right on its side and so help to suppress the other and again there is a time when the example of leontius bishop of antioch is more imitable that is to give offence to neither party for wisdom is justified of her children
and thus much of the first thing viz the concession in these words but this confess before speak of the confession which is the next thing will only remark this to you that st paul first clears himself from being a rebel against the state before he attempts to prove the orthodoxy of his faith or the purity of his religion from whence desire you to observe that those men that profess never so much of religion with never so much of zeal are to be lookt upon as false teachers so long as they continue their rebellious and seditious practices against the state and therefore let our dissenting brethren take notice that while they in contempt of authority oppose the establish'd and known laws by their riotous unlawful assemblies that their religion and profession of faith is false and erroneous and quite contrary to st paul here in my text which is the next thing am to handle in these words worship the god of my fathers
and in this shall first speak of the act worship and in doing thereof will not spend time in consulting that frivolous distinction of the papists of latria dulia and hyperdulia the first they say is that worship which is proper to god the second which is due to the creature and the third of a middle nature less than what is due to god and more than is due to the creature and this they say is only due to the virgin mary
know they have borrowed this distinction from st austin but have much wrested it from his sense for as they have added a third member to the distinction to wit hyperdulia so it is certain that st austin by dulia did not understand any religious or spiritual worship which is only due to god but an external civil worship such as men give to princes masters and pastors a service of the body but not of the mind as he speaks
the saints indeed are to be honoured for imitation but not to be adored for religion
neither does that father say that saints are to be worshipt with an inferior kind of religious worship called dulia but they express contrary for we honor them says he with the honor of love and fellowship as our brethren and friends but not with service as our masters and commanders
we do not deny that there are degrees of honor but to attribute the least degree of the service of the spirit to any creature we abhor because that is solely due and proper to god who only in all times places and things sees guides and disposes of all us and ours
god is not mocked and therefore will not suffer his own express word to be eluded with such frivolous distinctions
but as one complained that the law were like spiders webbs wherein the little flies are taken but the great ones break through so we may say of these popish subtilties because that though they cannot cast a mist before the eyes of god and rational considering men yet they may deceive the poor simple lay papist who goes on roundly to work in his blind devotion he poor man must needs remain intangled in gross idolatry
and therefore these popish ringleaders are not unfitly compared to bawds it is king james his expression in the like case who though they do not actually pollute their own bodies yet are a means of prostituting others to all filthiness
but leave them and return to our apostles worship the god of my fathers
this worship is twofold

external

internal
the external worship is principally threefold

the preaching and hearing of gods word

the invocating of his name

the reverend use of the holy sacraments

as to the preaching and hearing of gods word he requires nothing more earnestly than that the people be taught the knowledg of themselves of god and of religion son of man saith god cry aloud and spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and go and teach all nations saith christ and wo is me saith the apostle if preach not the gospel and he charges timothy before god and before the lord jesus christ who shall judg both the quick and the dead that he preach the word and be instant in season and out of season
and as preaching is the ministers duty so it is the peoples to hear for how can they believe in him of whom they have not heard and where there is no vision the people perish
faith is like the lamp and the preaching of the word like oil and as the lamp without a fresh supply of oil does go out so faith does decay without preaching wherefore it is written of our saviour that when he found a multitude without a pastor he was moved with compassion towards them
the second part of this external worship is invocation of his name and this is so natural to us that we usually lift up our eyes to heaven in any suddain exigence even before we consider the danger or consult our reason and god commands us to call upon him in the day of trouble and he will hear us
this is so prevalent that it binds up the hands of the almighty let me alone saith god to moses that my wrath may wax hot against them
no marvel then that st james says the prayer of the faithful availeth much if it be fervent
in a word he that does not pray is an atheist for david saith that only the fool who saith in his heart there is no god doth not call upon the name of the lord
sear if measures were taken of our being or not being atheists by the frequency of our prayers there are too many amongst us that could scarcely free themselves from that imputation unless to come to this place once or twice upon a sunday and that too more out of custom than devotion and never to think more of their duty till sunday come again does acquit them from that charge
but remember god will be called upon or he will not deliver
the third part of this external worship is the reverend use of the sacraments and let me tell you they are not indifferent things which we may use or not use at our pleasure as esther said if perish perish
there is a more christian in the case that is if we obey the commands of christ we must use them for he says go teach all nations baptising them and take ye eat ye drink ye
licurgus the lacedomonian lawgiver to oblige them to a more strict observance of his laws made the lacedemonians take an oath to observe them till his return and then took a journey with a resolution never to go back again and caused his ashes to be thrown into the sea least his people finding them should think themselves absolv'd from their oath
and thus our saviour jesus christ being to leave his disciples obliges them to the use of his sacraments till his return never intending to return again in humility but in glory if a dying friend should give you a ring as a token of his love and charge you to keep it for his sake would you despise an instance of so great kindness how comes it then to pass that we so little value so inestimable a jewel as the blessed sacraments which are the badges of our christianity whose value and dignity does not flow from the outward elements for what is the sprinkling of a little water the eating of a bit of bread or the drinking of a sup of wine but from the ordinance and institution of christ just as a piece of wax with the kings broad seal stampt upon it is of more value than a thousand times so much in the merchants shop
and truely if we would be taken for christ's souldiers we ought not to be ashamed of his mark the holy sacrament of his body and blood
there are two things generally objected by many that are called christians against receiving of it the one is that if they partake of it unworthily it will prejudice them such would do well to consider that until they put themselves into a condition of receiving it worthily they cannot be in a condition of dying and how dangerous it is not to be always so the uncertainty of this life does shew
the other objection is that they are not yet willing to part with their sins to which the receiving of the sacrament obliges them and therefore they will defer communicating until they are old and have a mind to repent and part with their sins
such would do well to consider that they may fall short of the time they design for that work or if they should not that god may not give them then grace to repent
and thus much of external worship which told you consists in preaching and hearing in invocation and the reverent use of the sacraments
the other part of his service is internal that is the worship of the spirit without which all our preaching hearing praying christning and communicating are but like a sepulcher outwardly beautiful but inwardly full of corruption for though the outward form is that which approves us to man yet it is the inward frame that justifies us to god
who does not like such professors as hosea compares to a half baked cake and ezekiel to a pot whose scum is therein for god is a spirit and he will nay he must be worshipt in spirit and truth
some there are who with esop dog snatch at the shadow and lose the substance that is place the whole worship of god in bodily exercise and external adoration as bowing before a crucifix in creeping to a cross in running a pilgrimage in visiting the reliques of the saints in hearing of so many masses in macerating the flesh in hanging down the head for a day like a bulrush in crosses and candles in holy waters and holy oyls in pixes and paxes and such like fripperies
and there are others who like lapwings make the greatest noise when they are farthest from their young ones though they pretend the greatest distance from the papists yet come very near them in many things and place their whole religion in running through thick and thin three or four miles on a sunday to hear a man preach or rather prate nonsence in carrying a bible under their arms though they neither understand it nor draw any inferences from it for the amendment of their lives and practices in condemning all as reprobates that are not of their own communion and in applying the intricate and misterious places of scripture especially such as denounce gods judgments to those that are not of their own persuasion
and if they can but prate like parrots in the scripture phrase and sing three or four psalms upon a lords day and repeat at night the nonsence they heard the morning nay if they commend the preacher for bawling lowd and making wry faces and thumping the pulpit and holding forth for two or three hours and preaching off book such stuff as is impossible for a considering person to write they conclude they have worship'd god sufficiently and that no more is required of them
and truly though this is very far from being acceptable to god yet wish we had not too just cause on the other hand to complain that internal worship is too much slighted by us and prayers and sacraments too much neglected and that as in times of popery all religion and worship was in a manner reduced to a mass so now amongst us to a sermon they seeing without understanding and we hearing without practising
thus much for the first particular to wit the act in which have spoken of the external and internal worship due to god
now proceed to the second particular in the confession and that is the object of his worship the god of my fathers
observe no saint nor angel no creature nor throne no dominion nor power no heathenish diety but the only true god in jesus christ
thou shalt worship the lord thy god and him only shalt thou serve
and see thou do it not saith the angel in the revelations to st john am thy fellow creature worship god
the manichees worship'd two gods a god of good and a god of evil and the tritheits three gods whence they had their name the valentinians worship'd thirty couple of gods and the gentiles as st austin observes thirty thousand gods thence they worship'd their adulterous jupiter their beastly apollo their drunken bacchus their bastardly aesculapius their theevish mercury their bloody mars their impudent venus and their spiteful juno as zanchy observes
and the papists have equall'd if not exceeded the heathens in the number of their gods and their superstitious ceremonies as may appear by the practice of the common people in these particulars

the pagans had their several tutelar gods for several places for delphos worship'd apollo crete jupiter athens minerva and ephesus diana and so in popery england worship'd st george scotland st andrew ireland st patrick venice st mark and millain st ambrose

in paganism they had several gods for several elements as jupiter for the fire juno for the air and neptune for the sea and so in popery they have agathus for the fire theadulus for tempests st barbara for thunder and st nicholas for the sea

in paganism they had several gods to pray to for their cattel and their fruit as pan for the one ceres for the other and bacchus for their wine and so in popery they have urbanas for their wine jodocus for their fruit wandelinus for their sheep eulogius for their horses and st anthony for their pigs
in paganism several prosessions had several gods to pray to as scholars apollo souldiers mars smiths vulcan and hunters diana so in popery scholars have st gregory souldiers st george smiths st loy and shoomakers st crispin

in paganism they had several gods to pray to in several diseases as apollo for the plague hercules for the falling sickness and lucina for women in childbirth and so in popery st roch for the plague petronella for the ague apollonia for the anastacis for the lastly to these both pagans and papists build churches erect altars ordain priests appoint festivals set up statutes and burn candles as musculus observes they did not learn this from our apostle the sole object of whose religious worship was the god of his fathers that is the god whom his fathers worship'd
there can be nothing more opprobriously objected in religion than novelty there are a people who have made laws of their own said haman of the jews and the areo pagites of st paul let us hear what new doctrine this is for innovation diminishes the venerable authority of religion and therefore it is the politicians rule not to remove an ill custom when well setled the very names of our fathers and predecessors sway much for the woman of samaria you know alledged the example of her fathers against gods commands our fathers says she worship'd in this mountain but our saviour tells her salvation is of the jews
and the gentiles excepted against christianity because they would not condemn the ways of their fathers but keep to and preserve those rites which descended to them from age to age and the hereticks themselves to gain credit to their tenents were used to say so have received so have been taught by the fathers
and the romanists do not object any thing more maliciously and falsly to the ignorant amongst us then that we had our religion only from luther and calvin which they themselves cannot but know in their consciences to be otherwise and that we swerve from the judgment of the primitive fathers and exclude our predecessors from all hope of salvation
but notwithstanding that they brag the fathers are all theirs like the madman that challenged all the ships that came into the harbour for his own yet it is evident to any one that is but meanly conversant in reading their authors that they esteem the fathers but as counters which at play are sometimes placed for pounds and sometimes for pence for where they seem to favour them they commend and admire them and where they are clear against them they decry and despise them
otherwise if the fathers are theirs and if they would have us believe they are their principal witnesses why do they cut out their tongues with their false glosses and expurgations of what they do not like

the examples of our progenitors or predecessors are no infallible rules for us to follow for we must not with the pharisees transgress the commands of god by the tradition of our fathers
we must not with the jews offer sacrifice to the queen of heaven because our fathers did so and it was well with them
why did the land perish and was burnt up like a wilderness but because the people walked after baalim which their fathers taught them
therefore the prophet says walk not in the ways of your fathers and they follow the generation of their fathers which shall not see the light

we do not make the case of our fore fathers that lived in popery so desperate as they represent it for we do not question but many of them held firm the foundation though much hay and stubble was built upon it for though they might be forc'd by terror or induced by sleight to partake of the common errors of the church of rome yet they might be free from its heresy and hold the faith implicitly in preparatione animi that is be ready to embrace it when god should reveal it to them

god might illuminate whom he pleas'd by his spirit in those times of darkness when the means of knowledg was wanting which is not now in this sunshine of the gospel to be expected as he enlightned the world by an expanded light before he created the sun which is since the ordinary way of giving light and as he fed the israelites with manna in the wilderness which he withdrew assoon as they came into the land of promise
for when ordinary means are afforded extraordinary must neither be expected nor relied upon so that you see there is a vast difference between the case of our forefathers and the case of the papist now who wilfully shut their eyes against the light offered to them
when the ordinary means fail'd god was able to save and did save in the midst of that blindness those that belonged to the election of his grace but it cannot be therefore safe for us to neglect so great salvation as is now offered to us upon pretence of our forefathers being otherwise principled
if my predecessors says st cyprian have not taught or held either through simplicity or ignorance that which our lord has taught them by his example or authority the mercy of god might pardon them but we cannot rely upon the like mercy who have so clear a proposal of those truths which were concealed from them
it is indeed good manners and charity to think hope and speak well of our fathers but it is both wisdom and divinity to look well to our selves
wish the dissenters from our church would seriously apply this to themselves if they did they must find their case much worse than their predecessors because they at once tread out of their ways and walk not in ours
am sure this disorderly tumultuous way of serving god which the separatists use was never practised by any considerable party in the primitive times
and thô will not deny but several national churches might differ from one another in their forms of worship yet never read nor heard of any who had not a form by which they did worship until our modern presbyterians
this one instance fancy that they cannot pretend the custom of their fathers for what they do unless they will own none for such that lived above sixty years agon might be sufficient to make them at the same instant to leave off and forsake their folly
and am perswaded that there are not any considerable persons amongst them but if they did seriously reflect and calmly consider how great a sin it is to make a schism in and separate from that church with which they own they agree in doctrine and is established by law for they know not what reason but because they will
say if they did think on this and sadly reflect that whatever the church of england either has already or may hereafter suffer through popery is wholly due to themselves for having murdered the best of kings and forc'd his royal issue to seek for safety under great necessities in popish countries and thereby exposed them to the dangers and temptations of the romish clergy who never fail to improve all opportunities for the advantage of the church or rather court of rome say if they did think on this they would now at least being so very obnoxious for their own preservation close with us in our communion and not separate from that manner of worship which we give to the god of our fathers with the apostle here in the text which was the object and the second thing was to speak of and leads me to the manner of his worship which is the third particular in these words after that way which they call heresie
whence we may first observe that it is no new thing for religion and the professors thereof to be traduced for christ was scoft at as a carpenters son and christianity is called heresie and christians gallileans and this proceeds from the innate malice and ignorance that every man has in him since the fall which as the spider extracts poison out of the sweetest flowers makes the worst interpretations of the best things and actions so that if david dance zealously before the ark he shall not want a michol to laugh at him and if ezekiah destroy idolatry some rabshekah will not stick to say is not this the god whose altars ezekiah broke down
if mary magdalen pour a little oil on the head and feet of our saviour some judas will be ready to say what needs this waste constantine for his bounty to the church shall be called pupillus one that needs a guardian and theodosius for his piety imbellis a coward but as the moon goes on silently in her course thô dogs do bark at her so let us go on in our religious worship without regarding the calumniations of our adversaries

observe that if we be morally certain that what we profess is true and according to gods word it matters not that the papists call us hereticks and the separatists call us papists truth will justifie it self
st paul you see is not offended that they call his religion heresie
and this brings me to the fourth thing in the text namely the rule in these words believing all things that are written in the law and the prophets
god who requires man to worship him has prescribed a rule for his direction and least this rule might be forgotten or corrupted in tract of time by a bare oral tradition of it from age to age he committed it to writing for though the word spoken be more efficacious yet the word written is more durable therefore it was that moses was commanded to write the moral law in two tables and that the spirit in the revelation says write and here st paul makes the rule of his faith all that is written in the law and the prophets
it would not be proper now to dispute whether it be necessary to salvation for a man to believe all that is written in the old and new testaments and therefore shall only for resolving this doubt and many other objections that may follow thereupon offer these few particulars

that every distinct sentence of the holy scriptures does command and require our belief as much as the whole or any part of them

that though a man may be saved without knowing all that is conteined in the scriptures yet if he refuse to give credit to any part of them when it is revealed to him as such he cannot be saved

that every man is not only obliged under pain of damnation to believe all that is scripture when revealed to him but he is also bound to believe what is not revealed to him in preparation of mind

that we may and ought to infer from st pauls words in the text that the scriptures are a sufficient rule of faith and that there is enough conteined in them without any other additions both for our direction and practice
yet deny not but that an undoubted tradition if we were so well assured of the truth of it by a general consent of all ages as we are of the truth of the scriptures has the same authority with scripture for until the means of salvation was fully perfected and the scriptures committed to writing tradition was the rule for st paul bids timothy to take heed to all that he had received either by word or writing
and though we do not with the romanists allow tradition to supplant the scriptures by giving it equal authority with them yet we allow much to an apostolical tradition because it may be necessary though not absolutely so to the clearing and better understanding of some intricate and mysterious passages in scripture
and this leads me to the fifth particular in my text to wit the principal ground of his confession in these words and have hope towards god which they themselves also allow that there shall be a resurrection of the dead both of the just and unjust
from which we may first observe that prudence and wisdom are consistent with true religion for you see st paul says which they themselves also allow that is the pharisees who did believe a resurrection that by this means he might gain their favourable opinion and so divide them and the sadduces who did deny a resurrection
for god never gave a man religion with design to deprive him of the use of his reason and to make him a meer natural he that charges his disciples to be as innocent as doves bids them be as wise as serpents and bids them to beware of men that will bring them into their councils which shews that we must not with the donatists of old and the quakers now court the lash and the prison and seek for occasions of trouble he only is the resolute champion for christ that will neither for fear of suffering weakly betray his cause nor out of an ignorant zeal run into needless dangers

we may observe from hence that the hope of the resurrection of the dead is a most powerful argument to persuade men to believe and embrace and practise the christian religion
for when a man seriously considers that he is not only to give an account here of what he has done and that this life does not set a period to his sufferings or rejoycings but that he shall rise again and undergo a new and impartial tryal and be for ever determined to live in eternal bliss or misery
this consideration say as it will make every rational not to mention pious man to live holily so it will be a great allay to his temporal sufferings to consider that he shall have joy in the morning of his resurrection for the heaviness he endured in the night of this life this was the ground of st paul free and publick confession of his faith and thus come to speak of the last particular in the text namely the effects in these words and herein do exercise my self to have a conscience void of offence towards god and towards man
whence we may observe that the end of all religious knowledg is practice for christianity is an active life it is not to make a wry face and to put on a serious look and to talk piously and to breath nothing but scripture that denominates a man a true believer but it is an exercising of ones self so as to keep a clear conscience towards god and man
and therefore it is that st paul elsewhere exhorts to press forwards and so to run as to win and not to beat the air
and our saviour bids bring forth works meet for repentance
and that we may do this we must live unblameably towards god our neighbours and our selves
if we be defective in the last two we must also be faulty in the first because though there are some offences more directly and immediately committed against god than other yet all are against him for as much as they are transgressions of his laws and therefore we must make it our chief business first to give him his due which is honouring and invocating his name acknowledge all we have to proceed from his free grace and make him as far as we are able suitable returns of praise and thanksgiving and as we must behave our selves thus towards god so we must deal uprightly with our neighbours we must carry honey in our mouths that is not injure them with false reports nor provoke them with bitter language and we must carry charity in our hands that is relieve them to our power when their necessities require it not wrong them by violence or fraud not exact upon their necessities and we must carry a good example in all our actions
and lastly as to our selves we must take heed that we abuse not those parts and indowments which god gave us to be instrumental to his service by any kind of excess riot or intemperance we must keep our sences well governed in great equality
the tongue under the rule of discretion and the heart in a firm peace free from all sensual distracting thoughts this is the true end of believing otherwise our assenting to a divine truth is no more than such a faith as the devils have who believe and tremble and are never the nearer happiness but our believing must include doing and must carry along with it a conscience or knowledge void of offence both towards god and towards man
and thus have spoken what designed at this time on this subject and shall conclude all with one word of application
you have heard st paul confession of faith beseech you examine your selves try whether you be of his religion or not if you be entreat you practise it

if you have a clear conscience you need not regard the false reports of others for though it be a misfortune to be undeservedly ill spoken of yet it is a comfort that it is undeservedly
the bird in the breast makes sweeter musick than the praises of a thousand flatterers
am grieved saith a father that they speak ill of me and asperse me falsly because they injure themselves and not me by their uncharitableness for they cannot rob me of the pleasure which a clear conscience continually administers to me
lastly that all of us may have this clear conscience let us be sure with st paul to walk by the rule the word of god that will be a lanthorn to thy feet and a light to thy paths and therefore do not imagine that the carrying of your bible to church and turning over the leaves and reading it carelesly is all that is required of you but be sure you practise what you read and compare your actions with that rule and make them conformable to it this will make you not only professors of st pauls faith but also partakers of his happiness where we shall see the face of the living god clearly and at the full where the beauties shall have no veils to hide them from our eyes our beings shall have no end our knowledge shall not be subject to error nor our loves to displeasure
what an excess of happiness will it be to enjoy all and to desire nothing to be a king without an enemy to be rich without covetousness and to be ever living without fear of death all which god of his infinite mercy vouchsafe unto us all through the merits of jesus christ to whom with the father and the holy ghost be all honour and glory now and for ever
amen
finis

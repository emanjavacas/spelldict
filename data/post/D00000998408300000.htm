short treatise declaringe the detestable wickednesse, of magicall sciences, as Necromancie.
Coniurations of spirites, Curiouse Astrologie and suche lyke. (:) Made by Francis Coxe, Epigraph: Esaia.
Babell is fallen, it is fallen, and all: images of her hath he broke~ vnto y^ groi Epigraph: Esaia.
Stande now amon thyne enchaunters, and in the of thy sothsayers, &c.
Let now the Astrlogers, the starre gasers, and Prognosticatours, stande vp, end saue thee fro~ these thinges, &c. I. C. FLe from the wrath that is to come You filthye adders broode, cast that you perishe in your sinnes As giltie of your bloode.
The wrath of God is kinde lid All suche to consume quite, That in the filthye soppes or dregges Of Egipt do delight Repent therfore saye to you For mercye call betyme And learn to hate the stinkinge mud Uvhere wallow nune but swyne.
Here maye you reade the wofull ende Of suche as wont to vse Those wicked artes that God abhorres In tyme suche then refuse.
I. P. YOu wicked rout of sorcerers For shame, your lyues amende Lest god doth pour such plages on you As neuer shall haue ende All suche he doth right sore abhor As scripture telth vs playne Repent therfore, and learns to hate These wicked artes, moste vayne.
Let his sweet rod example be Of late, you saw did fall Into suche as profest the lyke Whome God now home doth call.
Bring forth new frute, sob youre sinnes Lest dubble, ire doth light On you that do refuse Gods grace When haue the same you might.
ALthough, lacke such eloque~ce and learning, as is to be required in him, which should compile any work to y^ prayse, or dispraise of a thig, yet for y^
haue my selfe ben an offender in these moste detestable sciences, against whome haue compiled this worke, as Astrologie, Netroniancie, suche like: thought it my parte, for. ij. causes principall, thesame to do.
woulde it shoulde openly be knowen, howe wicked an offendor haue ben, bothe towardes God, and the lawes of my prince, y^ therby might geue an occasion too all men, too laude and prayse God for his bountiful gif+tes of grace, that when deserued his eter+nall ire: yet he by his gentle and sweet rod of correction, woulde call me agayne too y^ state of saluation, from which was falle~.
And also, to blesse this God of merci, which hath apointed such a mercifull gouernor to rule and rayne ouer vs. Who as she is seuere to punish the obstinate and stubburne male factors, so vseth she clementie too the penitent trangresiors: whereof of late sufficiently tasted, at what time stode before her graces moste honorable counsayll to receiue determinate sente~ce for my wicked offences.
The seconde cause of this my labor is: that woulde deterre and feare away, all suche as yet do, or hereafter may by the craftines of Sathan be procured to the lyke.
Wherfore gentle reader, moste haretly besech thee to take it in good parte whiche thinge, if thou shalt do: haue my desire, who wissheth thee the eternal peace of God.
AMongest other the Godly, holsome and profitable sayinges of the deuine Philosopher Plato: call too my remembraunce this one, as moste necessarie for all Christians to be had in memorie, whiche is this.
Non solum nobinati sumus, sed ortus nostri partim patria sibi vendicat, partim parentes, partim amici (that is to saye) we are not born only for our selues, like brute beastes, to seke y^ satisfiinge of our owne desire or lust: but of our birth (sayeth he) our contrye chale~geth a parte, our parentes likewise, yea, oure frendes also.
Wherefore to enioye any good, godly, or profitable thinges, or to reserue any benefit or gift, by the meanes of other, or through our owne trauels and diligent labor (if the same by anye meanes maye seme to sounde to the glorie of God, the profit of our co~try, parentes frendes) in withholdinge or keping backe the same, we shal not only tra~sgresse y^ co~mau~dme~ts of almighty God, which comau~deth vs to do as we wolde be don vnto: but also, if it shalbe well perceiued diligently marked of such as are wise lerned: we shal be fou~d manifest robbers spoilers of y^ high maie stie of God, which hath imparted his benefites so liberalli vnto vs for y^ setting forth of his glorie finally show our selues vnnatu+rall, both to our co~try, pare~ts fre~des, hewraieng our great ingratitude, not onely towards God: but also toward our co~tries.
Amo~gst (therfore) y^ inestimable heapes of wickednes, sinne da~nation, foreseinge y^ proclinitie or redines of me~, how apt prone thei are to euel, also seinge very many to erre go astray, especially by one meanes, wherby they detrude the~ selues, euen doune to y^ boto~les lake of vnspekeable offences, for so much as my self haue beit, in y^ like disceiued, yea had almost vtterli perished, had not y^ almighty power of god by his o~nipote~tie and gifts of grace called me back through most sweet gentle chastiseme~t.
And also seing wel perceiuing y^ craftines of wicked Satha~, who (as S. Pe+ter testefieth) goeth about lyke a rorig Lio~, seking whom he may deuour.
To cause all tou~ges to land his eternal maiestie, which hath so renouated or regenerated me fro~ y^ state of endles death, into the which was almost slipt, to shew my self myndful therfore of my loue duety towardes my co~try and frendes, to whome next God and my prince am moste chiefly bounden, and to aduoyde the filthy vice of ingratitude, then the which nothing ca~ wel be more odious: thought it my part manifestly to declare and open the wickednes of those artes and sciences, which hath of late time to y^ prouocation of Gods wrath and almightie displeasure, ben had in suche estimation, yea, rather veneration, that without it y^ whole state of men (except a few) would do in maner nothing, yea, it grew into suche credit with men, that not onely they iudged the course of naturall thinges therby to be gouerned, but also that parte which god hath and doth reserue to him selfe, and his deter+mination, as the mynde of man, and suche like.
Nay they seassed not here, but so blinded and bewytched the wittes of men, that scant durst thei credit God him self, if it semed that their blinded prophesies any time woulde make contradiction.
How wel this appeared in the yeare of oure Lorde God,
at what time our most noble souerain began her Imperial gouernement raign ouer vs, all men maye iudge, and easelye perceiue.
For although it was well knowe~ vnto all me~, what loue and godly zeale, her most royal maiestie had and did bear to the trew prophetes of God, his afflicted flock woorde of the crosse, yet did the people so wauer, the whole realm was so troubled so moued with the blinde enigmatical and deuelish prophestes of that heauen gaser Nostravamus, in such sort, that euen those whiche in their heartes coulde haue wisshed the glory of God and his worde moste florishing to be established: were broughte into suche an extreme coldenes of faythe, y^ they doubted God hadde forgotten hys promise, yea, they hong so choysly betw√©ne the heauenly fountayne of hope, the bottomlesse pytte of vtter desperation: that in doubt it was to which they woulde adhere or stick, so great was thinfectio~ of this pestile~ciall poysoned lying prophesies.
Of all poysons moste difficulte to auoyde by mea nes of the sweete and pleasaunte myxture therof, wherfore it may be called dulce venenu~.
Aswete and delicious poyson: but as the prouerbe sayeth, sweete meats haths sower sauce, so is this sweetnes tempered, with an euerlastinge bitternes or gall: For in these sciences Arologie, Geoma~cis, Necromancie and such like infinite, contayned vnder the general name of Magick but especially Necromancy, of which here chiefly purpose to speake, is one thinge page duplicate] page duplicate] promised: but an other performed, for why lest they seke ryches: they finde beggerye, for hope of good reporte: they haue euel fame open shame, for health: diseases and grief, for quyet myndes: wandring wittes.
Of Christians: they becomme infideles, urninge the temple of y^ holy Ghoste into agoge of Sathan.
Therfore deare co~trymen, flee frome these mooste wicked and damnable sciences of diuination, manifestly prohibited, by the sacred Scriptures and eternall woorde of God, lette the loue of him, whiche for thy sake sweate bothe water and bloudde, and had his flesh rent vpon a crosse, cause thee to withdraw thy mynde from the snares of vtter despayre.
But if that maye not preuayle with thee: let the feare of reuenge, at least wise abate thy corage therin, and learne this lesson.
Happye and fortunate are thei, whome other mens harmes, do cause to be ware.
The God of Godds who suffereth no good deed tobe vnrewarded, no wicked offence vnpunisshed (whiche hathe said heauen and earth shall perish, but his word shall endure) hath not only manifestly in diuers sundry places of the scriptures forbide~ the vse and exercise of suche curious sciences: but also hath appointed sharp punishment to the vsers thereof, that is no lesse then death.
This godly and wholsom law was in tyme past executed within this realme, by the terrour whereof, many were feared from these practises, But now whilest this lawe for lacke of execution hath lyen a slepe, and thoffendors nothinge punished: it was in suche sorte encreased, that it was made a berye handycrafte, so that manye lyued therby, yea, thought they did as honestly gette and gather their substaunce: as he, whiche dayly swet for the same.
The people were growen vnto suche a folly, that scant wolde thei ryde or go anye iorney: onelesse thei co~sultide, either with these blynde prophetes, or at the least with their prophecies, whiche yearly to no litle hurt, bothe in the fayth of Christ, wealth of the realme, were without all shame deuulgid.
What hurt it did in the faith before haue shewed, what damage it procurid to y^ commun wealth, mai easly be iudged, for what with their comminacions of warres, and dearth, they so tickled the myndes of vnsatiable niggards, that without al neede, eue~ a middest the plentye: we liued yet in penurie.
Wel, to my purpose, promised to open the wicked and blasphemous secretes of these deuelish sciences.
And although bende my selfe wholy to write agaynste y^ superstitious and hellishe practises of Necromancie, do not exempte the curious parte of Astrologie, frome the number of them: whose vtter deuastation and co~fou~ding before God, most earnestly desire wishe, for this am able to iustifie, haue the like in my selfe experimented, that of a truthe it is Malorum esca, the very bayte or trayne to fer greater mischeues.
Neuer was there any that coulde yet holde hym selfe content with the simple knowledge of Astrologie: but wolde wade furder in those sciences of prediction, hauing this as grounde worke to ser hygher matters.
neede not here to speake any more of it, for who list to reade the commendable worke of fulce, vttered too the same intent, shall finde of what force it is.
But this knowe that what euer is conteyned within their bokes, whiche they esteme, as principall rules and pillers of their knowledge to be nothing els but meare fables, and toyes, that in them there is no truth at all.
Experience therin haue had diuers and sondry kyndes, not by the iudgement of one or .ij. but a number, yea, euen of the chefest and mooste experte, amongest whome shall recyte the iudgement of one, forme of his calculation.
The question was moued for stolen goddes, the houre was by an instrument exactly take~, the Astrologer draweth the fourme of y^ .xij. houses, so calculateth for the time, which had, he domineth, now in his forsayde calculation moued wt talke, and forgetting hym selfe (as he afterward confessed) where he shoulde haue subtrac+ted: he added, and by that meanes placed y^ signe that shoulde haue ben ascendinge: in the .vii. house, and so contrarely, that signe whiche shoulde haue ben in the .vij. house placed he in the firste, wherby all his work was turned vpsidedoun, as we properly terme it, the carte set before the horse, yet he not finding this his great errour, gaue iudgement, that it shoulde be had agayne, so fell it out, that it was recouered.
Whervppon maye easly be gathered, that if he had calculated right, according to the rules of arte, he shoulde haue quite missed the cus+shion.
how certayn a science is this trow ye, and of how good a grounde? Yet will they presume to enter in iudgements of the secrete motions of men, whiche God hath re+serued to his owne proper knowledge.
Mitto arcana dei celu~q{que} inquirere quid fit? Cu~ sis mortalis que sunt mortalia cures.
He teacheth them wherein to be accupied, and not to medle with y^ misteries of God.
Yea, this he sayeth more vnto them, eue~ in the same boke folowing thus.
Quid deus intendat, noli perquirere sorte Quid statuat de te, sine te deliberet ipse; These are the presumptious imps of Sathan, which ca~ not yet be co~te~t here to seke out according to y^ hardnes of their hearts, (as Paul to the Romains the .ij. Chapter testifieth) sease not to heap vnto them selues; wrath, against the day of wrath.
For y^ star+res skyes are not sufficie~t for their future prediction: but they muste adioyne therevnto moste detestable partes or societye with spirites.
Which thing, when they go about, wolde haue any thing broughte to effect, they do it by one of these .ij. meanes: either besides the horrible greuous blasphemies, thei commit in their co~iuratio~s, thei must fall to some co~positio~ wt y^ deuell, that is too promise him for his seruice, he wil abstayn fro~ wynes, or some certayne meates, or drinkes.
As my self knew a Priest, not farre fro~ a toun, called Bridgewater, whcih as it is wel knowe~ in the contrye, was a great magicia~, in all his lyfe time, after he once bega~ these practises, he neuer wolde eat bread, but in stede thereof did eat always chese, which thing as he co~fessed diuers times, he did because it was so co~cluded betwene him the spirit, which serued hi~, for at what time he did eat bread: he should no lo~ger lyue.
Yea, he wolde not blusshe to say y^ after a few years he should dye, that the deuel for his payns y^ he toke with him, should haue in reco~pe~ce his soul.
moste miserable ma~ wretched creatur that wolde in hope of any earthly treasure: forsake his Lord, God, which had so tenderly bought him.
These are thei, of whom Paul speaketh in his .vi. .x. chapters to the Hebrews, these are thei y^ crucifie Christs agayn vnto them selues, and therfore it is impossible, they should be reuewed agayne by repentaunce.
The seconde waye, whiche is as euel as the firste, or rather worse: is thus.
For whe~ the spirite is once come before the circle, he forthe with demaundeth the exsorciste a sacrifice, whiche moste commenlye is a pece of waxe co~secrated, or hallowed after their owne order (For they haue certayn bokes, called bokes of consecration) or els it is a chicke~, a lapwing, or some liuinge creatur, whiche when he hath receyued: then doeth he fulfill the mynd of the exsorcist, for oneles he hath it, he will neither doe, neither speake any thinge.
Of this testefieth bacon in his boke of Necromancie, where he telleth also this storie.
After so long tyme tra+ueled in these sciences, at last ioyned hym selfe with a Turke, whiche was moste excelle~tly sene therin, and longe conferring together: they wente aboute too call a certayn she deuell, named Egippia, which spirite wolde by no meanes make theym aunswer to any their demaunds, wherevppon Bacon, whiche knewe that nothinge coulde be done withoute sacrifice: cruseth the Turke to be baptised, and after the baptisme, they both entred the circle called the spirite, whiche when she came: for all their conuirations she woulde not
God of his iustice ca~ neither leaue y^ workmaister, neither yet him that seketh to any suche for helpe, vnpunished.
For as wel de+serueth he execution that seketh to theym: as they them selues.
Example of this: we haue in the firste boke of Samuel.
called communly the first boke of the Kinges, in the .xxviij.
Saule went once to wytches sorcerers to learn his state: God gaue him vp quite into vtter ruin.
If then he were so precise with his owne peculier people, that the spared not their kinge and annointed: what will he do vnto vs? How muche more thinke ye will he execute his righteous iud+gementes on vs, that are but the brau~ches of the wylde Olyue tree, grafted in by his mercye and grace? can not se how they maye excuse them selues of cryme by Goddes woorde, that either seke too them or procure theym too worke, for bothe, by the scripture deserue lyke payne, and punishement.
Yea, the Deuell hym selfe is of that condicion, that he will not suffer them longe to reyg that vse him as an instrument for their necessities.
remembre a very notable historie writte~ in Frosarte; but the tyme is so long since read it, wel reme~bre not the place, but who so listeth to loke in y^ tables of his boke: maye easly finde it, where he writeth of Ortho~ a spirite.
Theffect is this, a prieste a certayn gentleman, falling at variau~ce, and the gentleman seming styll too perseuer in his purpose: the priest to abate hys corage, and to make him yeelde: sendeth vnto him the foresayde spirite Orthon, to molest and trouble hym, whiche comming about the quyet tyme of the night, whe~ all things are moste styllest: he clappeth the wyndowes and dores, as though he wolde haue toren them to peeces.
The gentlema~, regardeth it not, the next night he doth lykewise, but a great deale more fearsly, in so muche that it seemed he wolde haue entred the gentlemans bed chaumbre, wherwithall his spirites moued: soddenly asked who was there.
The spirite aunswereth, telleth his name, sheweth hym fro~ whom he was sent, and to what ende as is aforesayde.
Well sayeth the gentle man, wilt thou be conte~tid to serue me, and leaue thy maister the priest? He aunswereth yea, and so they concluded.
The office of this spirite was to bring hym newes oute of all places of the worlde what was done, within the space of .xxiiij. houres, whiche thing he did.
After a whyle, this gentleman beinge very desirouse to se his new man (for as yet though he hearde him, he neuer sawe hym) requested him earnestly that he mighte see hym, whiche thinge at the laste he graunted (and sayeth) when ye arise in the morninge, the firste straunge thinge you se, after you be vp: the same is I, so he departed.
In the morninge the gentleman arisinge and casting on hys nighte goune, he might se three russhes stande vprighte, and moue informe, as though they daunced the haye, but this pleased him not, wherfore at night when he came to him agayne, he chalengeth the spirite with the breache of hys promise, whiche he coulde in no wise a byde, for though he be neuer so vntrewe, deceitfull: yet may ye not charge him therwith.
And therfore asketh his maister what straunge thinge he sawe? he au~swered nothinge but .ij. or .iij. russhes driue~ vp doun with a wynde.
The same quod Orthen was I. Naye sayeth his maister, woulde se the more neare thy shappe, whiche after earnest request he graunted, and sayeth, the firste lyuing thinge that ye se out of youre gallery in the morninge in youre courte: the same am I.
The morninge comming he goeth vntoo his gallery, whiche loketh into his courte, and beholde, there he sawe the mo~steroust sowe and leane, that coulde be, wherupon moued with the sight, caused dogges to be set at her, and so he bayted her, but immediatly he falleth sicke, and so from tyme to tyme, pyneth awaye.
worthy seruaunte too serue a noble man, full well he rewarded hys maister in the ende.
Neither was it any otherwais but as they are wonte all to do.
For thys is no new or rare thinge amongest those that vse societie with Deuelles, for all haue the like ende, though not after one forme, yet to one effecte.
Bakons ende was muche after the lyke sorte, for hauinge a greadye desire vntoo meate: he coulde cause nothinge to enter the stomack, wherefore thus miserablye he sterued to death.
Cornelius Agrippa, of whome all the worlde speaketh, whose woorkes remayne vnto this daye, of whose ende are diuerse opinions, some rumors haue ben, that wha~ he rode abrode, he had alwayes a blacke dogge, waytinge vpon him, whiche dogge one day in iourneinge: caryed hym awaye body and soule, some say that the sworde se+perate his headde from the bodye, soo that hys ende is vncertayne and moste like it is that he endid after some straunge sorte, that the trueth therof is no more manifest.
Fabiane in hys Cronicles, the seuenth parte. and where he writeth of Carolus the eyghte, speaketh of a certayne mayde, ex+perte in these sciences, called La pucelle de dieu, that is too saye: the mayde of God, who by her knowledge caused the Frenchmen marueylouslye too preuayle in their marciall affaires, as more copiously doeth in the alleged place appeare.
But almightye God, whiche for son suffereth suche sorcerye and dyuelishe wayes too prospere and raygne, too the correction of sinners: lastely too showe hys power, and that no good Christen menne shoulde falle intoo anye erroure: he sheweth the clearnes of suche misticall thinges, and so he did in this, for she by a knight Burgonion was taken, and after sent to Roane in Normandye, too the duke of Somerset, and there brente, for her de merites.
Sainct Dunstane (of whom Bale in his boke intituled the actes of the English votaries writeth sufficiently, beinge one of this sorte and facultie, after diuers sondry prodigeous signes in the element sene: departed this lyfe, a swarme of deuels co~uaying away hys corps.
Ihon Grecian, that coniuringe Pope, after he had doon many deuelish thinges, as testifieth Martin{us} Carsulanus Platina in vitis Pontificum: was of the deuell (as he was dooinge his feates in a forest) strangled to death.
What maye we saye of Stansholde of late time, whiche was experte in these scie~ces, whiche for robbinge of a colledge, in the vniuersitie of Oxforde, was hanged at the townes ende for his demerites.
Many haue ended their lyues after these suche lyke sortes, of whome if shoulde write: it wolde conteyne an infinite volume, and that is most horrible, where thou seest one repent: a numbre are soo soddenly taken, that they haue no tyme of repentaunce.
Wherefore saye to suche of that sorte, repent and ame~de your lyues, you Adders brode, and learne by hym that hath felt the smarte, to fle from greater mischeues too come, for euen now is the axe put vnto the rote of the tree, therefore deferre no tyme.
And the that hereafter shalbe moued by the prouocation of the deuell, either to practice the lyke, or to seke for coun+sayll or aduice of them that do vse and prac+tise these blasphemous sciences: knowe ye, that euen as the good corne is with the fan purged from the chaffe: so all those be sepa+rated from the elect and chosen of God, as in the former parte of my treatice, shewed by thexample of kynge Saule.
God him selfe hath promised in his most holy and sacred scriptures no lesse to do, also for the punishment of suche, hathe by his owne decre, in the .xx. of Leuiticus appointed sharpe correction, sayinge.
And if a man or woman haue a spirite of diuination or sothsaying in them: they shall dye the death, they shall stone them to deathe, their bloudde shalbe vpon them.
For if we iudge him worthy of death that euel reporteth of an earthely prince: what shall we saye by him that blasphemeth the kynge of all kinges, his Lorde and onely sauiour? They can not saye that ignoraunce is cause of their euel disposed lyfe, for God hath manifestly forbidden the vse therof, not in one, or two places: but in sondrye.
Thus he sayeth Deuteronomie the .xviii. when thou shalt come into the lande, which the Lorde thy God geueth thee: thou shalte not lerne to do after the abhominations of those nations, let none be founde amonge you that maketh his sonne or his doughter to go through the fyre, or that vseth wytheraft, or a regarder of times, or marker of the fleinge of foules, or a sorcerer, or a charmer, or y^ counsayleth with spirites, or a soothsayer, or that asketh counsayll at the dead.
For all that do suche thinges, are abominatio~ vnto the Lorde. &c. Lo, here he not onely forbiddeth the vse: but commaundeth that those, whiche wilbe his people, and of his flocke: shall not seke helpe at the sorcerers handes.
Rede the. of the prophet Isaiah, and ther shal ye find, how he reproueth the chyldren of Israell for sekinge too the Egiptians for helpe, who were counted experte in deuelishe artes.
Ieremiah in hys .x. Chapiter sayeth: Heare the worde of the Lord that he speaketh vnto you: house of Israell.
Thus sayeth the Lorde, learne not the waye of the Heathen, and be not a fearde for the signes of heauen, thought the Heathen be afrayde of suche, for the customes of the people are vanitie.
how direct√© are the lawes of the Lord? how playne are his pathes? how swete are thei to them that fulfille them, for it preserueth them from endles deathe and payne.
If we do embrace and folowe theym, we shall not only be sure here in this world to lyue withoute dredde or feare, safe from oure enemies, both boddely, and ghostely: but after this lyfe, we shalbe crouned with the croune of euerlastinge ioye, and felicitie.
Where as the contrarie, and suche as will take no admonission, but lyue inordinately, shalbe condemned to euerlasting terrour, whose tormentes, no tonge is able to expresse.
This God of mercye hathe offred hys grace, wherfore refuse it not, but with all humble heartes embrace it, beseching him so to strengthen you with his holy spirite, that this lyfe endid, we maye heare thys confortable sayinge of oure Sauioure: Come ye blessed chil+dren of my Father, possesse ye the kyngedome, prepared for you, fro~ the beginning of the worlde.
Too the which Father, So~ne, and holy Spirite, be eternall laudes, prayses, empire, and glorie, worldes without ende.

new riged by a to his prince and countrie never more need to be set forth to sea· then in these distracted times

figure behold your king the ile of wait printed in the yeare to the reverend bishops and clergie for asmuch as your eclesiasticall office is given you from god as the next principall members under the head to governe the common wealth of this misticall bodie and that their is required at your hands an extraordinarie dutie touching the function of the soule
let mee entreat you to be as vigilant as the five wise virgins having oyle alwaies in your lamps against the bridegrome comes forth of his chamber your office is the soul of the laitie the heart of government and the very epitome of all obedience from you as the moone boroweth her light of the sunne all ministers take their order of perfection let then your doctrine be pure and stedfast like moyses bush that alwayes burned but never consumed your preaching in season and out of season and your conversation as spotlesse as the sacrifice of
you best know what plentie of manna hath rained in israel and how many omer full every man ought to gather be not any of you the first that gather more then is commanded and in mistrust of gods benefits in the whole land with the vice of avarice

you ought rather to be like pelicans in the wildernesse who in tender love peck the blood from their

breast to feed their young one you see with your visible eye how wonderfull almightie god hath alwayes preserved the kings majestie from the snares of his manifould enemies

and in you principally lies the sacrifice of thanks giving it is you that ought to daunce before the tabernacle

and to go with the people to the arke of the covenant that your righteousnesse may bud like arons it is you that ought to flie forth from this tossed arke and like the doue bring the olive branch

of peace in your mouths and tell the that if they returne god will be their god and send a truce to their distressed soules by you his ambassadors

fly not to tharsis when you are sent to niniveth least devouring destraction attend you nor with the man of god goe not out of the way least a lion tare you in peices but still be conversent with the lord that

your faces may shine with moses when he came from the mount and bring the image of gods glory to the people in your foreheads you must beare with aron

the brest plate of judgment upon your hearts there must be graven upon your forefronts holinesse to the

lord and your sounds must be heard when you goe into the holy places before him so shall yee stand like mount sina never to be removed and your golden candle stick shine in the temple of the lord remember the charge your mr christ gave to his servant peter binding him three times above all things by his fervent love and the deare affection he bare to his mr to feed his sheep to be with paul the faithfull ambassadors of jesus christ as though god did

besech you through us we pray you in

that ye be reconciled to god with paul likewise to

be an example of life and doctrine as in these words and follow hard toward the marke for the price of the high calling of god in christ iesus let us therefore as many as be perfect be thus minded if ye be otherwise god shall reveale even the same unto you
ye are

most reverent the salt of the earth which wanting savour is to be troden under foot yee are the light of the world a that is set on a hill cannot be hid let your light therefore shine that they that see your good workes may glorifie your father which is in heaven

this unworthy to councell so grave advisements as if the body should instruct the soule only like a traviler in his pilgrimage seeing a king go out of his way tell him there is a better a more perfect and a straighter so referring you to your masters reward who hates a hidden tallent beseech that god who

guideth israel by day in a pillar of cloud by night in pillar of fire to direct your earthly bodies and spirituall soules to his service amen
to the true nobility of this realm

to yee right honourable that are the props and supporters of a kingdom that like atlas should beare the weight of heaven one your shouldiers give me leave to stretch forth the atires of my heart and as in these tempestious times unite yourselves togeather in peace like one body obedient to one principall

head in the worthy member the heart the monarch seate of our microcosmos should be your residence within whose center as in a princes court are diverse receptailes for you to inhabit in then as branches extending from the lofty cedar· being sed by one root doe notwithstanding cherish one another their naturall sap so like the true stock of nobility· discended from your worthy ancestors be you combined in a conjunction of unseperable aide that the body of the tree may be comforted in so happy an issue and in the proudest blast of conspiracy keepe you still unremovable be you like faithfull mardocheus spotles in your waies when traytors like proud haman shall perish in their own for if you please to peruse our histories both eclesiasticall and prophane yee shall find that never traitor to his native prince but had his reward threefold returned into his wicked bosome and though it hath pleased god somtimes to suffer them the cause best known to his sacred pleasure to bring to passe their hatefull purposes yet as a woe pronounced to them by whom such evils come their mischiefe hath not past without great mischiefe reguerdond their is none of your honourable society but knowes that treason is the devider and seperater of all good things and a fatall disjoyner of perfection bringing with it ruin and the mercilesse substitutes of war where one the contrary obedience is the finewes of the state and glewes the hearts of nobility togeather like one indivisible substance and as the seaven leane in pharaohs dreame devoured the seaven far yet themselves not the fatter so stands it with treason

like a cormerant it devours all yet is it self the better by nothing
what greater paterne of misery can there be then a kingdom devided in it self it is like the dangerous eclipse of the sunne nay like the unnaturall seperation of heaven that brings all danger and destruction no plague of egypt comparable to that misery for civill discention is the gate to let in ruin and foraine invasion it is like a wedge of iron that entring into an oake dissevers both sides in severall peices and makes them both fit for the fire
the flourishing state of rome was devoured by that monster and all tranquility swallowed up at a bit by that hidious leviathan it is like the blind mole that loveth still to be mischievously labouring tosseth up her own destruction
let then right honourable that acceptable sacrifice of your hearts be offered to our gracious soveraign which far exceeds the externall offices of fained affections who with an eye of vigilancy will no doubt regard your vertues and like the cheerefull comfort of the sun with his blessed countinance make your young blosoms come to pleasant fruit and bring the fruit by comfortable warmth to full maturity
by this meanes shall your phenix live still and you be made most happy in his fresh renewing god so direct your hearts to worke in you unfained loyalty to his sacred majesty and deadly hatred to self devouring treason amen
to the civill majestrates the lord majors mr majors and their sheriffes of london yorke newcastle carlile and other inferiour officers
the naturall care and loyalty your ancestors have ever borne to their soveraigns since their first flourishing time both in peace and warre hath in ages past as deedes worth registring been recorded for it is manifest when princes that heeretofore have governed have held their reigns with a more severe hand then in our times god be thanked yet they have without repining willingly sustained as giving place to time to fortune or both
and as in all dangerous commotions they have made apparent their forward loves and loyalties to their prince and native country so it were to be wished that you that are their successour would follow their examples and with aperfect resolution and vigilant care unite your selvesin love together and lend your helping hand when occasion shall serve to restore our to much wronged soveraigne to his rights again for their is no other balsom will heale the wounds of our long languishing and bleeding country if so you do you shall find your soveraigne like a carefull mother with hester be ready to offer himself for his people and with iudeth to dread no danger to preserve his own nation

the titants dioclesian nero and phalaris who most blodily dived into the bowels of their friends and subjects were obeyed both in love and feare though their tyrany extended to all licentious and uncivill proceedings how much more ought yee having a most christian prince govern yee that tenders the pricking of yourfinger more then a wound from his own hart to his thoughts and pure integrety am constrained to urge this as a thing which cannot be two often mentioned considering the craftie and many subtill of the disloyiall saduccs in these times and strive as much as in them lyeth to bribe and turne the hearts of his highnesse loving subjects against him as the divell which darnell amongst the best wheat with counterfit shews and deceitfull practises or like the craccoldaile in niclus which weeps like a child till she allure some passenger and then returning in the nature of her ugly shape her hunger bitten paunch and presently devours of such pestiferous sstuffe are all glozing siccophants that guild their pretences to keep the counterfit unspied with such false suggestions· carrying neither honesty reason or truth but like the divells that entred into the heard of swine when they cannot have libertie or licence to do one mischiefe covet to enter into another so their mallice may be set on worke but to withstand such know your civill iudgments are able if your minds were willing

herein you ought the rather to be thorowly confirmed seeing how god hath from the begining of his majesties reigne defended him against all manner of

envious assaults and laid their owne evill upon the wickednesse of their owne heads
this should make you methinks chary to discover to your dread soveraigne any mischeife lurking like poyson of· aspes under their lips call to mind his majesties gratious proclamation wherein he hath declared himselfe and now sheweth it to the world to be more carefull of your wellfaire then his own should thinke you seeing the abuse and slavish servilitie that your native country is brought unto by your disobedience should stir you up to gaine what is lost and england nay english men where have you lost your hearts of loyaltie or what is become of your eyes that you see not your selves oppressed with such tedious burthens and clogges as to be constrained to pay both for your appetile and sustinance your king imprisoned in the isle of wight your prince forced to live in annother kingdom nay more what can be worse all these things are by our fellow subjects which in all righr should be our servants but now they are become our lords and taskemasters for they which will trample their head under their feet will not use the bodie other wayes all these things and many more well wayed we cannot say otherwise but it is a thorow deformation both in church and state

this as one servant in advising even as you would have your soules upon high and your coffers inricht on earth as you looke to have your fild ful of godsblessing to have your wine good and your ale fat once againe stirr you up like

a flame that is quickned with blowing to have god obey your prince and do good for your countrie so shall his proudest enemies dye at his feet and ye be made worthy instruments like a tower of marble to defend his sacred majesty whom god continue with long health and prosperous life
amen
to the true and faithfull privet subject both in the north and south parts of this kingdom my deare countreymen whose loyalties to their prince and countrey will never be forgotten

and now beloved countreymen to you in generall that carry with you the full currant of affection the swiftest streame of deepe guiding love not to be revented or turned back by the vehement opposition of my resisting wind to you as to the open marke whereto my heart leavile her pretended aime being the upshot of my exhortation send this my friendly councell like as a citie well fensed about with impregnable walles so ought ye to be in time of domisticall rebellion or forraign invasion ye are the maine battaile the strength and trust of this kingdom and to you belong a chiefe trust in the required renovation as his highness may well be compared to

the apple of our eye which naturally by reason it is tender unto us we have most care so ought ye to joyne your whole bodies goods armes leggs feet and hart to protect his royall person without secret grudging private muttering or controversie
ye ought to be like stedfast rocks in the sea to affront every storme and to withstand without muttering the most bitter blasts that either winter or foule weather can afford
to conclude beseech god in his infinite mercy stir up your deare affecting love to his majesty mercy hath alwayes sitten at his right hand and honoured about him like a continuall mercy is the wedding king that like unspotted virgine hath married him to our saviour and hath setled his highnesse the faithfull president of his true church wherein may his maj continue many happy dayes to the glory of god and the comfort of his faithfull loving subjects
amen
vvhat a faithfull subject is

a good subject next to the diadem that a dornes a princes head is the chiefest ornament that decores his dignity he is the precious balme that annoints his browes and is never to the hart then his scepter to his right hand as sweet in his nostrills as the groves of gillead and more precious in his

then solomons yourythorne covered with purest gold
his heart is clothed with peace like mount olivet his eyes as harmlesse as the sight of a dove his tongue sounds like the harpe of david and his lips deliver the happinesse of loyalty his eares are the that receive understanding and all perfection from thence is conducted to the hart his hands are readie to fight the batailes of the lord and his feet shining the steps of blood are bent alwaies to walke in the paths of innocencie thus excellent in the sight of the prince shines a faithful subject more gorgeous then the ephod of aron and more sumtuous then solomon in all his royalty who so is this to this his prince and countrie the lord will prosper him and he shall be blessed in everlasting generation and for one of these benefits he receives in earth he have a million in heaven for one of these perfections he partakes of in this world numbers above number shall attend him in the world to come and his prince shall thus pray for him and blesse him as solomon did his subjects
and the king turned his face and blessed all the congregation of israell and said blessed be the lord god of israell who spake with his mouth to david my father and hath with his hand fulfilled it

and though my selfe may say with isaiah am a worme and no man yet spake it in despite of vaine glorye would with all my hart as an isaac in the hands of abraham serve as a sacrifice to doe my prince and countrie good for sure hee cannot bee

a true servitur of god that is not a faithfull subject to his prince neither would iudge my filicity this world answerable to that if once my soule might be imployed to please my prince and benefit my country
for all the offices of humanity depend only upon these principall performances for know by that meanes there comes a blessing from a farr a reward full of joy which none else are worthy to obtaine which reward hartely pray the great rewarder of all to send to the true loyall and faithfull subiects of england and so one voyce proceding from one unity of heart let us all say faithfully god save king charles amen
the discription of loyalty
above the clouds where sprangled troopes of starrs adorne the precious bosome of the skye where heavenly peace abandons breaking jars and all the consort that is on high send forth their delicat melodious sounds that makes those christall vaults with joy abound
with in the bright imperiall orbe of rest where soules of saints one goulden alters sett and in the lambes sweet breath are only blest where thousand graces millions more beget

his loyalty in thrnd in blessed chaire

most gorgeous in attire most heavenly faire
about her head the swift wing cherubines hover their silver pinions in her eyes and the sweet spheares with glorious seraphins vpon her shining brow with blisse arise no stormie cloud can vail her beauteous face because their burnes the holy lamp of grace
truth richly clothed in whight ornament stand at the right hand of this happy saint
from whom the words of righteousnes are sent whose cheerfull hopes by envie cannot faint
but as the daughter to the highest power she sits defended in a strong built tower vpon her left hand hope her anker wayes one whom her dear successe doth still attend
nor doth shee feed her servants with delayes but they that one her sacred state depend
with bountious hand shee gives such rich reward as vading fame hath neither seene nor heard and as great michaell with the dragon fought about the chosen moses sacred so she contends with that have sought to touch the hearts of gods annointed ones
and like the archangell gives them all the foile
that lift their hands a princes life to spoile

sir

have ever accounted in gratitude to be not only the greatest but the ugliest monster in nature according to that ingratum si dixeris omnio dixeris wondring at the most sort of men which in this our age doe live that they take so little regard of it and not rather altogether shame and abhor it but when perticularly muse of some as of my selfe find that either oppertunity will not alwayes serve or abillitie in most do want to those that carrie willing minds or answerable in deeds and concerning my selfe of is now my drift dispare have often feared least of divers hereof would as guiltie be noted and of many to whom have been beholden· justly condemned but of note more then of your honour which to me for som years together you have been pleased to bestow upon me many noble favours the whilst was under your command wherefore having gotten some fit occation thought not to pretermit the same but therein to view my mind and poore ability wherein may doe your honour any service doe here present small say in respect of answering any benefit received but great and pretious in regard of the matter therein contained having been an eye witnesse of your honours actions for his majesties cause and knowing what great paines and adventures you have undertaken for the defence of it being alwayes a good account to your master as a just steward ought to doe your loyall action which england is not ignorant of hath imbolden me to present this small worke to the eyes of the world under good protection not to gaine a populer applause but to hinder as far as in me lyeth the trampling soe pretious a iewell under the feet of such swine which wallows in the myre of our times
take leave of your honor wishing you all happinesse in this life and in the world to come eternall felicities

this is the prayers of one of your honours captaines who wil be alwayes readie to observe your command vale

the sentiments
ah tom hadst thou but read my machiavel thou might'st have kept in the exchequer still
thou might'st have pol'd us o're and o're again and more than monarch o're three kingdoms raign
the two chief sinews of devouring war money and arms still at thy elbows are
both in the mint and in the magazine a pageant of thy power may be seen
these to thy self thou hadst secur'd and then pompone and cheese had both neglected been
but thou like th fabulous dog to thy dear cost grasping at shadows hast the substance lost
subjects that catch at kingdoms find at last the globe is onely for a monarch's grasp
the in emblematick sence says supream rule onely belongs toth prince for us tis dang'rous and th excess of power
sends the dread wight to put it off i'th tower
then the man looks that struck the isle with fear harmless as are the uncharg'd cannon there or as the figures armed which reliques of our british glory be

tis not your patience stops the ills you'd do then stingless snakes lie still by patience too but as hard frosts do torrents quiet make here you're confin'd for th publick safety's sake
now may'st thou smile to see the solemn sport which vexes busie greatness in the court
too late you know more fit to be rejected than to study it
since that the actions of th ambitious are but as the false alarms in running war
unquietness and guilt is all they gain and the great toil is recompenc'd with pain
thrones are the hardest seats in palaces where weary power does never sit at ease
methinks hear thee pleasantly declare how rigidly thou art confin'd from care and others growing into thy disease whilst you for penance must endure your ease
fallacious power a great man's worst disease without it sick and with it worse at ease
tis the of which men ne're complain fruition numbs and stupifies the pain
in its decrease the patient worse does grow in all distempers else tis never so
but to thine own experience appeal dost thou not now its bitter twinges feel fav'rites depos'd wish they had never known riches or sway they toil'd to make their own

a great man rule and power is understood more in the harm they do him than the good
mischiefs make haste in their access but slow as loaded snails when they depart they go
increase of power the tyde of greatness is thrust on at land as rivers are from seas which at no mark can one poor moment stay but when it leaves to float must ebbe away
a subjects grandeur hath this worst of fate that where its glory most does elevate tis blemisht there by being singular and envy blasts the fame it cannot share
the sun's excess of lustre is the cause that o're's own face he such dark vapors draws so since thy race in glory was begun thou canst not now black exhalations shun
through mists of common breath thy passage lyes and from their lungs the worst contagion flyes
made bigger like the sun at's going down though rob'd o'th rays that did his temples crown
a greatness like the chymist's stone breeds busie spies and dangers when tis shown
tis dangerous to take into our breasts secrets of kings and kingdoms interests
the jews that swallow'd down their wealthy stuff found their own bowels were not safe enough
whilst thus to save their jewels they designe the roman swords delv'd into th living mine

happy's the man that can securely please his humble mind with ignorance and ease that ne're approaches on the icie ground where monarchs walk nor their vast depths does sound
who's led by no t'a precipice where on each side ruine presented is
whilst a would charybdis shun what boots it if on scylla he must run twixt two extreams let vertue keep her throne the golden mean to statesmen's rarely known
with icarus on waxen plumes they flye and soar a pitch for their weak wings too high till they come tumbling headlong from the skie
lax't by the beams they rise they fall as fast as arrows when their elevations past
so dangerous a risque thou hadst not run hadst thou took phoebus councel to his son or thought to th builders what confusion came by raising babel to too high a frame thou hadst not then mistook the way to fame and where th'expectedst glory met with shame
thou then hadst spent thy days secure at ease calm as the halcyons brooding on the seas
but obstinate as phaëton thou wast and now maist curse thy rash unbridled haste
for he that undertakes great charles his wain is but another phaëton in grain and bids the british world betimes complain

destruction's threatned by his mad career and all th inferior world is struck with fear
tis then high time that jove his thunder take and all reserves of pitty quite forsake this must be so for the poor kingdom sake
when ministers their publick power reduce to private ends and to peculiar use ill fares the state for then they act the wrong which to prevent they only were made strong the noblest task that does to power belong
these always should be easie of access let suitors need no guide but their distress when high in power make their approaches low to meet and lift the humble when they bowe
they should with patient ears attend the tongue and hear th oppressed out though ne're so long
with such a sweet compassion meet their moan they should with that seem satisfy'd when gone
a gen'rous temper sweet civility forms without which courts but in chaos lye and which the cognizance have ever been of a safe greatness satisfy'd within which covets toyling power for others ease not to be able to offend but please
who never peace obstruct because they are accountless stewards to that spender war
what a mighty distance does appear between the court and this fair character

mankinde doth practise villany so fast as they should act too little without hast
earth which made man refin'd man does esteem although the author of all ills to him
midas himself knew not a greater curse than that of gold nor can there be a worse
branded for folly wisely yet he went by mighty bacchus to pactolus sent
and in the streams his golden vertue leaves which to her sands as proudly she bequeaths
th ambitious do'nt himself admire for what he hath but proudly does desire does tacitly confess he aims at sway because he's grown too haughty to obey
his parasites who contradict their heart with lyes their study'd art please him though their own reason they displease hoping their fawning arts may gain them ease
how vainly glorious does he then appear whom the proud envy and the humble fear my lord since you were placed by the royal hand on giddy heights where none alive could stand since you were destin'd to more watchful care than centinels in towns the scenes of war to stear the state when dismal stormes appear'd such as were by the best fear'd

deserves more wonder that so long you stood than that you e're were shipwrackt in the flood
search ages past and records for their fate great fav'rites seldome have prov'd fortunate
toth tower from the throne transplanted now though washt with fruitful tides ne're hope to grow
the fates thy term of greatness did assigne to which arriv'd thou do'st as fast decline when fav'rites set they never rise to shine or if they do tis a portentous light like that of in the night or comets that strike terror to our sight
the topmost boughs of cedars be adding both height and beauty to the tree but from the royal trunk when lopt away they quickly fade and run into decay
at thy enstalment when thy george fell down twas for an omen of thy ruine shown
the genius of the isle the brave st george left thee to sullen fate and scorn'd his charge
what wisdome then thy conduct can decry because too weak to baffle destiny let zealous fools rejoyce cannot choose but mourn for the great excellence we loose
such a preposterous fate does wail it hence when it does fall it rises to our sence
great vertue may be dang'rous whil'st tis here as light offends the eyes by being near

this topick well his royal highness knew and in obedience to the king withdrew
as the brave julius who did early strive at more than man was hated when alive even for that vertue which was rais'd so high when dead it made him strait a deity
our royal heroe thus will fame prefer and place him foremost in her kalender
so noble valiant loyal one whose name flyes round the world upon the wings of fame whom like a heroe in some battle lost mention not in pitty but in boast
whose subjects then shall wish him in the throne too late when he to's kindred gods is gone
by being confin'd your lordship set at large and have from care and pow'r a blest discharge
being now far more august within your sphere than when the courts bright star you did appear
let others take their turns of power and state and their own fortunes so precipitate unless by yours they rectifie their fate
leave them to restless care being still alarm'd with bloudy factions though they seem unarm'd who for our would religion change and think their own the best for being strange who weary of our scepter here would fly to seek new fashions for authority and fetch us home a crown three stories high
from forreign states they'd bring rebellion home then call just punishment a martyrdome
for when by justice of the law subdu'd they call unwilling suffring fortitude
coleman his treasons did negotiate in tender love and pitty to the state and in a work so great for his defence did satisfie himself with innocence
to the grim tree of fate he cheerful came by his last act t'obtain a martyr fame
nor did the rest dismaid approach the place a dying martyr's smiles crown'd ev'ry face
and am told his holiness has given to ev'ry one of them a throne in heaven
each had his pasport and by mass tis hop't there's not a soul in purgatory stopt
though conscience be in man a secret shame of doing ill yet in cabals they claim not only freedom for the ills they do but call religion to abet them too
a deity they seek in bloud and boast they then have found him when they've nature lost
but whilst with heaven they so familiar grow they to the earthly gods disdain to bow
and their religion not from zeal approve but for the gainful mischiefs which they love
mischiefs whose depths in tyber must be found and which no line but length of time can sound
finis

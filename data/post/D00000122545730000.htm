a letter of advice to a young gentleman leaveing the university concerning his behaviour and conversation in the world
by dublin printed by benjamin tooke printer to the kings most excellent majesty and are to be sold by mary crook in

an advertisement from the printer

the gentleman concerned in this paper being assured that he is not the onely one that needs these instructions and that the benefit he reapes by them

would not be the less by their being publick has so far befriended the world as to expose them to the view of all but it being the peculiar fate of letters to be at the dispose of those to whom they are sent this has not perhaps those advantages and accessions which would have been given it had the inditer been the publisher

yet as it is all kind of readers will be entertained from the usefullness of the subject the variety of matter the freedome that is taken and the conciseness of the suggestions which will further oblige them to measure the words not by their number but weight
if this be perused by men that live up to the advises proposed

they cannot but be confirmed and gratified to find themselves so luckily transcribed and if this falls into the hands of novies and such are all once if experience must make men wise this little vade mecum shall suddenly enrich them with a treasure of observations which they may hourely employ and continue to

do so even while they ve nay all must be gainers here when they find the good christian reconciled to the good companion and the olar taught to be a gentleman

it hath been observed that elaborate studied discourses have not been so contributive to wisdome as the memoires and private remarks of

eminent and conversing persons and it is to be wished that they would communicate their experiences a little more and that some would insist on this subject so minutely as to descend to the particulars of behaviour that befits men in their several qualities and professions this would be a greater kindness to all societies

then that which is intended them from the experiments and moderne improvements that are now the boasts and triumphs of some virtuosi

to esq at oxford

sir

you have been infinitely advantaged by your education in the university which will have a perpetuall good effect upon you and give you lustre in the eyes of the world but that you may be further usefull acceptable to mankind you must pare off something you have contracted there and add also to your own stores from

observation and experience a way of learning as farr beyond that by precept as the knowledge of a traveller exceeds that which is gotten by the mapp

an academick life is an horizon between two worlds for men enter upon it children and as such they must judge and act though with difference according to their own pregnancy the ingenuity of their teachers and the manner of their being taught and when they pass from thence they launch into a new world

their passions at high water and full of themselves as young men are wont to be and such as are dipt in unusuall learning and if they goe on so they are lost besides that there is a huske and shell that growes up with the learning they acquired which they must throw away caused perchance by the childishness of their state or the formalities of the place or the ruggedness of retirement the not considering of which hath made many a

great scholar unserviceable to the world

to propound many rules for the manage of your self were to referr you back to the booke again and there is even a native discretion that some are endowed with which defends them from grosse absurdities in conversation though there be none but may be helped by some admonitions

suppose you to understand the nature of habits and passions suppose you likewise what know you

to be to be adviseable observant and of a sedate temper therefore you will be sufficiently instructed with a few intimations for he that reflects upon himself and considers his passions and accommodates himself to the world cannot need many directions
suppose you also to be principl'd with religion and morality which is to be valued before any learning and is an ease and pleasure to the mind and alwayes secures a firm reputation let the world be

never so wicked no man ever gaines a reverence for his vice but vertue commands it vicious men indeed have been popular but never for being so but for their vertues annexed they administer their imployments well and wisely they are civill and obligeing they are free and magnanimous they are faithfull and couragious
it is alwayes some brave thing that recommends them to the good opinion of the world

the advices here lay

down are rather negative then positive for though cannot direct you where you are to saile throughout your whole course yet may safely shew you where you must not split your self
and the first rock discover on which young scholars shipwrack themselves is vaunting of the persons and places concern'd in their education
therefore advise you to be spareing in your commendations of your university colledge tutor or the doctor you most there admire

for either all is taken for granted or you onely betray your affection and partiality or you impose your iudgement for a standard to others you discover what you think not what they are an earely kindness may make you as blind as an unjust prejudice and others will smile to see you confident of that which it may be they know they can confute
this holds in all kinds of commendations which should be modest and moderate not unseasonable

not unsuitable not hyperbolicall for an excess here creates envy to the person extoll'd and is a virtuall detraction from others you converse with and your own understanding is measured by it
nay it is a presumption in some to commend at all for he that praises another would have him valued upon his own judgement

therefore it is a disparagement to be commended by a foole except he concurs with the vogue or speakes from the mouth

of another you must indeed when you speake of mens persons which without provocation should never be represent them candidly and fairly and you are bound to give your friend his due elogy when his fame is concerned or you are required to do it or may do him a kindness in it
but remember that when you give a person a particular character it receives its estimate from your wisdome be temperate therefore as well as just

when you come into company be not forward to show your proficiency nor impose your academicall discourses nor glitter affectedly in terms of art which is a vanity incident to young men that have confidence and heat of temper
nor on the other hand must you be morose or difficult to give an account of your self to inquisitive or learned men let your answers be direct and concise it is both your wisdome and your kindness to come to the point at first

onely in conferences or debates speake not all you have to say at once in an entire harangue but suffer your self to be broached by degrees and keep an argument for reserve what you say at first may perhaps give satisfaction however you gaine respite for recollection and when all is out at last you will be thought to have more in store

and because the mouth is the fountaine of our weale or our woe and it is the greatest instance of

prudence to rule that little member the tongue and he indeed is a perfect man that offends not in word for all our follies and passions are lett out that way there are many things to be observed in the manageing of discourse onely say in generall that you must not speak with heat and violence nor with reflection upon mens persons nor with vanity and no man therefore should be his own historian that is talke of his own feats his travells his conferences

with great men nor boast of his descent and alliance nor recount his treasure or the manage of his estate all which weares out the greatest patience and without a provocation expresses an intollerable vanity and implyes a beleiving that others are affected and concerned in these things as much as himself
the like weakness is talking of ones trade or profession to those that neither mind it nor understand it
indeed if the company be all of one peice then

debateing any thing that relates to all may be usefull but it is impertinent in mix'd company to betray onely your skill or inclination
in like manner he is not to be brook't that over a glass of wine will turn statesman or divine perplex good fellowes with intrigues of government cases of conscience or school controversies which are too serious and too sacred to be the subjects of common talke let no mans vice be your theam nor your friends because

you love him not your enemies because he is so and in you it will be expounded partiality and revenge not of any other because you are certainly unconcerned in him and may possibly be mistaken of him let not the lapses or ridiculous accidents or behaviours of men that are in drink or in love be taken notice of after or upbraided to them in jeast or earnest for no man loves to have his folly remembred nor to have the consequences of wine or passion

imputed to him and he cannot but like you worse if he finds they have left an impression upon you
every mans fault should be every mans secret as he sinns doubly that publishes his own shame for he adds scandall to the sin so does every man increase the scandall that is the propagator of it

when you carve out discourse for others let your choice be rather of things then of persons of historicall matters rather then the present age of

things distant and remote rather then at home and of your neighbours and do not after all these restrictions fear want of discourse for there is nothing in the world but you may speake of it vsefully or pleasantly every thing sayes herbert is big with jeast and has wit in it if you can find it out

as for behaviour that is certainly best which best expresses the sincerity of your heart think this rule failes not that that kind of conversation that lets men into your soule to see

the goodness of your nature and the integrity of your mind is most acceptable for be assured every man loves another for his honesty to this every knave pretends and with the show of this he deceives nay the sensuall love of bad men is founded upon this nothing loves a body but for a soule nor a soule but for such a disposition as answers to that idea of goodness which is in the mind

this is that that reconciles you to some meens at

the first congress for usually you read mens souls in their faces if they be young and uncorrupted and you for ever decline some countenances which seem to declare that some vice or passion has the mastery and though some times you are deceived yet you persit in your prepossession till the behaviour doth signally confute what the countenance did threaten

this makes a starcht formall behaviour odious because it is forced and unnaturall

and assum'd as a disguise and suffers not the soule to shine clearly and freely through the outward actions

first then your actions must discover you to be your own master for he is a miserable slave that is under the tyranny of his passions and that fountain teeming pair lust and rage must especially be subdued

that of love to give it the milder name so farr as it is vicious take to be seated principally in the fancy and there you must

apply your cure for ascribe its vehemence not so much to the constitution as the pampering of the body and mens letting loose their eyes and tongues and imaginations upon amorous incentives and not keeping a sence and awe of religion upon them
for if you live in an age and place where shame and eivill penalties have no force you must have recourse to religious means and the grace of god for restraint lust is more distinctly forbidden by our christianity then

any other thing therefore it ought more sacredly to be avoyded

if you grow troublesome to your self in gods name make use of that honourable remedy he has provided and in the interim if you can allay your fancy and keep your inclinations undetermined think a promiscuous conversation is the safest for many that have lived in the shade and retirement when they came abroad were ruined by doting on the first thing

they met with and this is oft the effect of distance and caution

the other spring of mischief is anger which usually flames out from an untamed pride and want of manners and many other untollerable infirmities so that there is no liveing in the world without quenching it for it will render you both troublesome and ridiculous and you shall be avoyded by all like a beast of prey
the stoicks pretend to be successefull eradicators of this passion and

their bookes may be usefully read for tameing it
but themselves have retained many ill humours behind which are worse then a transient rage and are most abhorrent from all society as moroseness fastidious contempt of others peevishness caption scurrility wilfullness which issue from some tempers and some principles which men are apt to suck in to feed their naturall dispositions with whereas the world is not to be entertain'd with frowns and

darke lookes be as severe ad intra as you will but be wholly complaisant ad extra and let not your strictness to your self make you censorious and uneasy to others thus many mortified men have been very unruly to the great scandall of what they professed

avoid therefore going to law at your first setting out for that will teach you to be litigious before your temper is well fixed and you will contract an habit of wrangling with your neighbours and at last delight

in it like a sophister with arguing in the schools you may observe many who have entred upon intangled estates to become vexatious and have quite lost the debonairness of their dispositions

be alwayes mild and easy to those that are about you your relations and servants not onely for their sakes but your own if you be displeased at every peccadillo you will become habitually froward which you cannot put off when you appear abroad and

remember that if you be easy to your self you will be so to every body else and you will be welcome every where

this produces comity and affability which is a great ornament of behaviour this argues you well within and that you are a lover of mankind it is a mixture made up of civilities and freedome suited to the condition of the person you converse with a quality as to modes and circumstances we fetch from beyond the seas for the

meer englishman is supposed to be defective in it as being rough in address not easily acquainted and blunt even when he oblidges though think it not worth the charge the gentleman is at that travailes for it nay am sorry for the poore returns many make that import hither the ayre and carriage and assurance of the french therewith quitting their own staple native commodities of much greater value the sincerity and generosity of the english disposition

none is more melted with a civility then an englishman but he loves not you should be verbose and ceremonious in it take heed therefore of overacting your civilities to men unconcern'd in you that must conclude you impertinent or designing
freedome is likewise acceptable and a great advantage to a converser we commonly make it the effect of familiarity but it should be the cause of it but prudence must bound it and apply it
be free when you speake

when you give when you spend when you allow your time and company to your friends let nothing of confinement formality or difficulty be discernd if you can do a kindness do it at first that is a double obligation and evidences that it was in your heart before it was suggested to you the return of thanks will be but cold if the oblidged finds that importunity necessity or after reasonings did extort it from you

if you would have an interest where you live

there must be legible in all your actions justice in your dealings between man and man this is the cheapest and the greatest policy and this alone will secure your reputation with the populo to this purpose onely advise two things


you must be an exact keeper of your word a promise is a debt which you should pay more carefully then a bond because your honesty and honour are the security
be punctuall even in small matters as meeting a friend restoreing

a booke returning a paper for faileing in little things will bring you to faile in great and alwayes render you suspected and you shall never be confided in even when you mean most heartily


have a speciall care of your debts know scarce any can alwayes avoyd contracting them but he that neglects them is profligate and undone as to the world if you would eat in quiet never run in debt for what you daily consume he that is necessitated to this is

the proper object of an almes when you borrow choose rather a rich creditor and a great debt then many trifling debts dispersed among poore people a poore mans little debt makes the greatest noyse deferr not therefore to pay mechanicks their utmost dues for they are craveing and clamorous and confider onely your condition in the world and not your present exigence

prudence must be discernable in your actions as well as justice and that

will appear in nothing more then in the choice of confidents and dependants your most diffusive love to mankind cannot be extended very farr for the verge of your knowledge is not and need not be great out of acquaintance you choose familiars and out of these you pick friends and you must not expect them to be such as are described in bookes and talked of by philosophers thats a romantick thing onely to be found in vtopia or the new atlantis if any such are

they must be in a monastery or recess where business and understanding are in a little compass it is sufficient for you to find the effect of one such friend in many
you may cull one out of each of those eminent professions that you may be concern'd in and make them your confidents in their severall sphears
you goe not to a lawyer for physick nor to a merchant to be resolved in a case of conscience though both do love you and serve you in what they may

make no man your friend twice except the interruption was through your own mistake and you have done pennance for it
every well wisher is not capable of being made your friend nor every one that you think is honest and faithfull there must be a suiting your humor and a mutuall serviceableness and ability to give advice and to take it and such a proportion of temper as that he shall not through vanity or levity or uncertainty betray himself or you
he that is not

stanch in preserveing of secrets cannot be a friend such is a talkative man that uses his mouth for a sluce to let out all that's in him this argues a great weakness in the head for a shallow understanding presently judges and passes sentence and is positive in it

never tell any man you have a secret but dare not tell it you should either goe further or not have gone so farr and press no man vehemently to keep conceal'd what you have committed to him for that implyes

you suspect what you have done and that you diffide in his prudence it discovers your value of things and provokes him to incontinence and breach of trust for there is an itch in mankind to be greedy of those fruits that are most zealously forbidden and some prohibitions do even excite desire

reservedness by some is accounted an art and a vertue think it is a fault and the symptome of a sullen or stupid nature and know it to be unwelcome

to all societies like a plain communicative man he is usefull and acceptable to the world and be assured that a darke close reserved man shall never have friends no man will take you into his heart that cannot get into yours let your intentions be never so sincere and know not what a good man need be afraid of if no hurt be in him no hurt will come out of him

it is true openheartedness has a latitude and discretion must bound it and

assign its degrees according to your kindness to them or their nearness to you and none should see all within you for it may be infirmity vice or discontent lyes at the bottom
nor is it fit to rush into discourse before superiors this is a greater rudeness then to deny them their place and respect the like reverence must be had to the aged and most experienced and such as speake out of their own profession neither would have a man lye open to the scrutinyes

and pumpings of every pragmaticall inquisitor such assaults must be managed by art you must put by the thrusts by slight rather then strength for no force must be discerned in such cases he that drolls best evades best but when a man demurrs at an easy question and is shye of speaking his mind and passes into another shape when the matter inquired for is common to all or prejudiciall to none and when he delivers any thing it must be received as a great

secret though not fit or worthy to be kept it argues him weak and formall and by his rarities he layes up you may guess at all his closet

from all this you may inferr how farr the reporting of newes may be convenient if you would be popular you must indulge this humor of mankind though the young man is not so much the athenian in this as the aged
if you live remote from the city have all publick occurrences as early as you can you

oblige your neighbours by it better then with the greatest entertainment some are terrified from speaking what they heare because it is the trade of seditious men to spread rumors and false reports think there needs not such caution if what is related be somewhat at distance or a common concern or not evill in it self and hurts not the fame of others

tell no newes to one that pretends to be a statesman and aske none from him not the first for he

will seem to know it before or be angry his intelligence was no quicker not the last for he thinks secrecy becomes him and he loves not to be an author

you may guess mens tempers by the straine of their intelligence
converse not therefore with mutinous dispositions and besure you represent the actions of your superiors candidly as peace and charity and obedience does oblige you let your errors be alwayes on the right

hand for every good child is so farr from exposeing that without beholding he endeavors to cover the nakedness of his father

it is the method of nature and all common wealths that there be a dependance of the lesser upon the greater the weak upon the strong therefore if you aime at imployments you must lean upon some besides your own virtue and have patrons and assistants to advance you know no greater advantage for a qualified man then

to stand in the way for every man must let out his affections upon some and have his creature and that is chosen by chance or fancy
you see when friends meet their presence does excite a chearfullness and vivacity with which they entertaine one another and this speakes their sincerity better then any words they can utter this holds proportionably in all degrees of conversation take notice therefore of your first accosting any person he will be presently

inclined to like or dislike and he cannot but give some indications of it

observe then the eye rather then the tongue and apply not your self where you was at first discouraged if the circumstances of your affaire did not cause it if you prove the favourite of a great man desire not the monopoly of his eare for his will be imputed to you and what is well done will be ascribed to himself

allow your self some time for business every day

no man should be in the world that has nothing to do in it yet never proclaime your self very busy for a little hint will serve any that is not much impertinent and the less busy you seem the more you are admired when your worke is dispatched

recreation is as necessary as business which should be rather of the body then the mind because that suffers most in sedentary imployments in this you must have respect to the place

where you live and your associats there in some parts of this kingdome many of the gentry understand nothing beyond a horse or a dog and can talk of nothing besides it therefore if you be not a huntsman or a faulkoner you cannot converse with them
yet this is really better then the effeminate divertisements of the city

take heed of playing often or deep at dice and games of chance for that is more chargeable then the

seven deadly sinns yet you may allow your self a certaine easy sum to spend at play to gratifie friends and pass over the winters nights and that will make you indifferent for the event
if you would read a mans disposition see him game you will then learn more of him in one hour then in seven years conversation and little wagers will try him as soon as great stakes for then he is off his guard
equanimity at play which is not the effect

of use argues a man manageable for any thing he that crowes and insults with success is passionate and is usually the same that fretts and quarrells at misfortunes

all society is linked together with some common thing that entertains them thus eating and especially drinking is become the ligament of conversation
in this you are daily concern'd in some degree let this be with a visible chearfullness and pleasantness for that

is wholesome both for body and mind as physitians and divines will informe you
it will make you welcome to all and by this many accomplish their ends upon the world

be not over criticall about eating for an epicure is very troublesome though this luxurious age bath made it a piece of learning yet me thinks tis much below a brave man to be anxious for his palate and to have his thoughts and pleasures confin'd to a dish

of meat
judge rather for health then pleasure and disquiet none with disparageing the food or niceness about it and be not much afraid of the unwholesomeness of what is sett before you except it be your constant dyet for usually you see nothing but some will commend it and our common tables furnish us with nothing that a temperate eater may not eat with safety

confine none when you drink to your measures

and expect not that others should do as you do tis both uncivill and unreasonable to impose on company nor yet must you seem to be under any restraint by them but be flexible to the inclinations of the whole and that with readiness
every man should keep a stint he that palliates it is most pleasant yet if you publickly declare your resolution not to trespass beyond your measures when you are found to command yourself you will

not be sollicited any further when you have come up to your standard recede silently and do not magisterially oblige the company to breake up with you much less stay to be an unconcern'd spectator of their levities but give others the same liberty your self desires to take

might extend such kind of observations to many other subjects but must desist begging your pardon for playing the dictator and being so dogmaticall

in what utter know they will not fit all men nor do they pretend to cure all faults nor are they designed to express your needs but they may prevent inconveniences and help you to read men and discover where they faile and let you see what relishes with the world
they are obvious and easy in themselves for nice and subtle things do not guide mankind but plaine and common rules and by analogy with these laid

down you may judge of other matters as they occurr
and cannot but acquaint you that they are the effect of your worthy fathers influence on me who extending his paternall care to all circumstances for your good ingaged me upon your quitting your academick station to propound to you some directions concerning conversation
and have pitcht upon such as are grounded on vertue yet tend to render you acceptable

even to the worst and he has done me honour in judgeing me capable of speaking to this subject if they accomplish not the utmost intended at least they will do no hurt but discover my own private sence and be a testimony of that kindness which is oweing to your relations by

your unfeigned friend and servant

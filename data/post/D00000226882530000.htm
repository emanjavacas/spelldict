a comfortable new ballad of
a dreame of a sinner being very troubled with the assaults of sathan


to the tune of roger

figure

in slumbring slléepe lay all night alone in bed a vision very strange there came into my head

me thought the day of doome vndoubtedly was come and christ himselfe was there to iudge both all and some

my selfe was sent for there with sound of trumpet shrill which said all soules come heare your sentence good or ill

sate in minde amaz'd at that same sudden voyce for in mine owne good life no whit could reioyce

with panting brest paus'd at that same sudden sight not trusting to my selfe but to christs mercies great

was no sooner meant but sathan came me thought with him a role full large of all my life he brought·

and laid before the lord how that was his owne and would haue had me then my sinnes so great were growne

quaking lay with feare and wist not what to doe but in the blood of christ trusted still vnto

then said our sauiour christ foule sathan end thy strife· looke if the sinners name be in the booke of life

if he be entred there then must he needes be blest his sinnes be washt away his soule with me shall rest

then sathan tooke the booke did leafe by leafe vnfold and there he found my name in letters limb'd with gold

then sathan sorrowed much at that same sudden sight
and said vnto the lord thy iudgements are not right

and thus our sauiour swéet said to him by and by thou sathan know'st full well that for sinne did dye

redéeming all the world once ouerthrowne by thée and so will saue all such as truly trust in me

my mortall foe was wroth that he had lost his prey extreamely vexed was and vanisht quite away·

but that thus was bill'd within that blessed booke out of my stumbring sleepe so ioyfully awoke

still praying to the lord that alwayes sinners may from sathan be set frée at the last dreadfull day

that after earthly toyles

we may heauen ioyes attaine

here learne to liue to that we may liue againe

our noble royall king
god grant him long to raigne to liue in ioy and peace the gospell to maintaine

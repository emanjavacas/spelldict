An Astrological Discourse vpon the great and notable Coniunction of the tvvo superiour Planets, SATVRNE IVPITER, which shall happen the

Written newly by RICHARD HARVEY: partely, to supplie that is wanting in co~mon Prognostications: and partely by praediction of mischiefes ensuing, either to breed some endeuour of preuention by foresight, so farre as lyeth in vs: or at leastwise, to arme vs with pacience beforehande.
TO THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, IOHN, BISHOP OF London, and his verie good Lord: RICHARD HARVEY wisheth long life, with increase of all honourable vertues.
RIGHT REVEREND, my dutie in most humble wise remembred, am to beseech your good Lordshippe, to vouchsafe me that fauour, (if not for mine owne sake, or the worthines of the thing it selfe, yet for Cambridge sake, and that especiall affection, whiche you haue alwayes borne towards Vniuersitie men, and namely your singular curtesie toward my brother Gabriel, when he should haue trauailed to Smalcaldie, which curtesie he doth often recognise) that as it hath pleased you alreadie to commit the perusing of the Astrologicall Discourse following, to your most learned sonne in lawe, M. Doctor Squire, who can verie well iudge, and hath verie friendly allowed thereof: so it may now like your Lordshippe, to admit of the same for the best New yeares gift, that such a scholler on such a suddaine can bestow.
Which albeit in respect of the base handling, it be nothing worthie either the view, or the handling of such a personage, as can not but know your Lordship to be: yet considering the great importance, and consequence of the argument, am both perswaded by some friends, who are to ouerrule me in a greater matter, to aduenture the publication thereof, (insomuch that haue made my good Lord of Rochester, and M. Doctor Lewen priuie thereunto, who like well of the impression) and with all am incouraged to craue your good leaue, that vpon your priuate liking, (which notwithstanding my selfe of my selfe can not greatly hope for) you would suffer it to passe vnder the title of your good Lorshippes publique maintenaunce, and patronage.
may easily presume too much of your accustomed fauour, so assuredly knowen as well in both the Vniuersities, as abroad in your Lordships Diocesse, and other parts of the Realme: and therefore (notwithstanding the importunitie of those my friends, and the grauitie of the argument it selfe) being loth to be ouerbold, where owe so much reuerence and dutie, haue thought good, not to vse your name without your owne licence, but wholy to commit the publishing, or suppressing of this Discourse to your Lordshippes liking or disliking.
You may haply maruell what meane, either to deale my selfe in any such matter of Astrologie being shortly to professe Diuinity, (so soone as my place in the College shall call me thereunto) or to dedicate a Treatise of anie such contents vnto one, that hath both so many yeres, euen in King Edwards, Queene Maries daies, (as appeareth by his owne, and others writings) caried so singular credit for his knowledge, and practise in Diuinitie, now by Gods prouidence is in place, to benefit and countenance those, that being admitted to that vocation, shall deserue to be well accepted therein.
But for the one, besides that might alleage for my defence, the examples of Melancthon, Chytraeus, Iunctinus, Maestlyne, our M. Doctor Fulke, your M. Doctor Squier, and some other of like credit: who being professed in Diuinitie to their owne speciall commendation, the generall benefite of the Church, were not afterward ashamed both to defend, to practice Astrologie: the verie subiect and matter of the Arte it selfe is such, that none, which knoweth it in deede, can iustly charge it with the least contrarietie or repugnancie either to Diuinitie it selfe, or to the soundest partes of Morall and Naturall Philosophie.
Coeli enarrant gloriam Dei; and Platoes opinion is, that our eies were principally giuen vs, for this vse and end, to be occupied in the contemplation of the heauens; whereunto he attributeth so much, that he thinketh Astronomie and wisedom to be so inseparably linked and chained togither, that neither a very wise man can want Astrologie, nor a very good Astrologer want wisdom.
To which effect, that notable saying of his, deserueth to be as famous, as your Lordship knoweth it to be amongest the learned: [undefined span alphabet].
Which verie saying seemeth vnto me to import some part of that Diuinitie, whereof so many ages he hath caried so high, and honourable a surname: the rather because the singular and incomparable wisedom of Salomon, as your Lordshippe best remembreth, is thus particularly described, in the booke intituled, Liber Sapientiae.
Deus mihi dedit harum rerum cognitionem veram, vt sciam dispositionem orbis terrarum, virtutes, effectionesque elementorum, initium, finem, medium temporum, solstitiorum vicissitudines, consummationes temporum, morum mutationes, annorum orbes, stellarum situs, ac dispositiones, naturas animalium, iras bestiarum, ventorum impecus, cogitationes hominum, stirpium differentias, radicum virtutes: quaecunque sunt abscondita, improuisae didici, cum me omnium Artifex docuit Sapientia.
For which verie kindes of knowledge, (albeit beleue neuer anie had them in that full measure, that it pleased God to bestow vpon Salomon) our chiefest Astrologers, especiallie the most learned Arabians, so often as they are occasioned to cite, or mention any of their predecessors: call them commonlie by the name of Sapientes, which some know merrily translated Wizardes, but how wizardly, (if they speake generally without exception of the better sort) let the prouerbe testifie, which saith, Scientia non habet inimicum, nisi ignorantem.
What should speake of Thales Milesius, who being the first, that among the Graecians was called [undefined span alphabet], as Diogenes Laertius reportethÂ· was also the first among them, that searching out the secrecies, and misteries of Astrologie: both foretold the conuersions, and eclipses of the Sunne, as Eudemus witnesseth in his Astrologicall historie, and found out Vrsa minor with hir litle starres, whereby the Phoenices direct their nauigation, as Callimachus testifieth in his Greeke verses: and foreseeing a verie great dearth of oliues, and thereupon purposing to shewe, howe easie a matter it was for Philosophers to grow rich, gat into his hands by a reasonable price, all the oliue gardens in Miletum, and Chium, the winter before, whereby afterward making his owne price at his pleasure, he gained exceeding great summes of money: as is crediblie recorded not only by Hieronimus Rhodius, and Aristotle in Greeke, but also by Tullie De Diuinatione, and diuers other in Latine: Aristotle saying, one while he did it, [undefined span alphabet], an other while, [undefined span alphabet]: and Solon the wise Lawmaker among the Athenians, following his aduise, set downe certaine Astrologicall obseruations of the Aequinoctia, and corrected the Attique yeare, as appeareth by manie histories: and finally by the defects of the Moone and Sunne, he prognosticated the defects and subuersions of certaine states and kingdoms in Asia, as out of Plinies Naturall historie, haue specially noted in my briefe Treatise of the late eclipse.
should be ouer tedious vnto your Lordship, if should go about to recite the tenth part of those testimonies, and auctorities, which coulde easilie alleage to the same effect: whereby it is certainlie euident, that as wise, and worthie men, as euer were in the world, both made verie speciall account of this studie in other, and trauailed exceedingly therein them selues: as namely Iulius Caesar, Octauius Augustus, Ptolomey, Theodosius, one of the best Emperours, Fredericke the second, (who caused Ptolomey, Messahalah, and diuers other principall Astrologers, to be translated out of the Arabian into Latine: Hos quia consilijs regum conducere sensit: as Hellerus writeth to Ernestus, Prince of Hennenberg:) Alphonsus the most excellent King of Arragonia, and Naples: Matthias Coruinus of Hungarie: Charles the fift of famous memorie, and sundrie other, as well Princes, as subiectes of the most notable sort.
But can not praetermit that Astrologicall conference betwene Caesar, and the Aegyptian Priest in Lucans Pharsalia, where Caesars owne confession of him selfe is thus deliuered: media inter praelia semper, stellarum, coelique plagis, superisque vacaui: Eudoxi Fastos noster superabit Annus.
Which he in deede performed, correcting and reforming the Romane yeare by the helpe of Sosigenes, as Solon did the Attique yeare by the helpe of Thales: an other maner of reformation, than that of the Calender, which the Pope Gregorie the xiij. hath newly published, by the helpe of knowe not what Astrologers.
As for the rest, least should seme to forget my selfe, in not hauing that regard to your Lordships person, which ought, wil reserue their Astrologicall commendations vnto some fitter place, thinking it sufficient for this present, to stande vpon the Reasons, which Melancthon, a man as your Lordship best knoweth, of a sharpe, and sounde iudgement in most schollerly points of learning, alleageth, in a notable preface of his, In Theoricas nouas planetarum Georgij Purbachij directed to his most learned countriman, Simon Grynaeus: wherein he sheweth how needefull Iudiciall Astrologie is, both for priuate vses, and for publike.
For priuate vses, first in medendo: then, ad regendos mores: thirdly, ad deligenda studia: plurimum enim refert intelligere, quo quemque natura ducat: (I vse not a word, but his owne:) beside, fortuna saepe comitatur mores: quanquam aliae quoque causae funt humanorum euentuum, tamen res loquitur ipsa, interdum in Astris causara esse, cur vt Hesiodus inquit: ipse dies quandoque parens, quandoque nouerca, sit.
Fiftly, conducit tempestatum obseruatio ad Oeconomiam: last of all, hi proximi anni aliquot satis claras significationes praebuerunt, sidera magnam vim in aere, rebus nascentibus habere, idque palam testantur insignes siderum congressus (which maketh directly for the present Discourse.)
And as for the publike vse and necessitie thereof, he goeth forwarde thus, in my simple opinion, both very politickely and diuinely: Existunt inrebus publicis fatales tempestates, in quibus admoniti ab hac arte, multa prouidere possunt, vel ad cauenda, vel ad mitiganda pericula.
Saepe enim fata consilio in melius flecti queunt, saepe fatorum saeuitiam lenit Deus, placatus piorum votis.
Quare haec quoque grauis causa fuerit, rerum futurarum significationes animaduertendi.
Prodest enim commonefieri homines atrocibus siderum minis, vt Deo opem implorent; deinde, vt bonitatem Dei magis agnoscant, cum viderint aliquam esse superiorem ac meliorem naturam sideribus, quae tristes significationes mitigat.
To the breeding of which politike, and diuine considerations in the mindes of some or other, would to God, this slender Discourse of mine might be anie meanes.
Melancthon leaueth not thus, but still goeth on, as it were in a certaine feruent zeale towards this profession.
Nec dubia est harum Artium fides: nam motuum ratio demonstrationes habet, quarum eÃ² est suauissima cognitio, quia delectat animos certitudo, harmonia, seu consensus in tanta varietate argumentorium: Diuinatricem si quis prudenter ad Physicen referet, intelliget eam habere graues causas; tuetur eam experientia peritissimorum hominum: rectÃ¨ verÃ² Galenus de hac ipsa arte inquit: Sophisticum esse, contra experientiae testimonium, rationes quaerere.
Finally, to aunswere common obiections, and suche ordinarie contradictions, as Astrologers eares are well acquainted withall, he at last breefely decideth, and determineth all such doubtes in the wordes following.
Nec eo detrahenda est arti fides, quia aut artifices aliqui inepti sunt, aut non omnes euentus humani in arte monstrantur: sunt enim aliae quaedam praeter sidera, euentuum causae.
Etsi autem in tantis tenebris humanae mentis, multa prospici nequeunt, tamen ariis beneficium non leue ducendum est, quae pleraque interim; ad vitae summam pertinentia monet.
Quoties fallimur in leuioribus artibus, in ijs rebus, quae sunt, vt ita dicam, in manibus? Neque tamen propter eiusmodi errata explodandae sunt artes; sed prudentia est, ad vitae vsum inde, quantum possumus, transferre.
Illud etiam rectÃ¨ institutis iudicare facile est, quis esse modus Diuinationum debeat, quÃ²d religio approbet has Diuinationes, vt Medicorum iudicia, aut caeteras Physicae partes.
Which reasons of Melancthon, doubt not but your Lordship will admit, and allow for effectually materiall and good.
Now see not greatly, what remaineth to be yet obiected: vnlesse haply some will oppose the olde decrees of the Romane Senate, and some newer imperiall lawes, against all such, as were vulgarly called Mathematici, Chaldaei, Arioli, and Diuinatores, of whome Vlpian the famous lawyer treateth libro
de officio Proconsulis, vnder the title, De Mathematicis, Vaticinatoribus: Which verie title haue hearde so alleaged.
Whereunto, first might aunswere, that they dispute not ad idem: those lawes being made only against such, as Moyses condemneth in the XVIII. of Deuteronomie, who vainly tooke vpon them, to diuine by magicall and superstitious sorceries, numbers, lottes, characters, charmes, interrogatories propounded to the dead, inspections of birds, entrals of beastes, and such other monstrous, and abhominable meanes: for so saith A. Gellius in his first booke of his Noctes Atticae: vulgus quos gentilitio vocabulo Chaldaeos dicere oportet, eos Mathematicos vocat; Seruius Honoratus vpon the fourth of Virgils Aeneidos: Cum multa sacra Romani susciperent, semper magica damnarunt; probrosa enim ars habita est.
Secondly, that albeit those Romane lawes had in deede bene deuised as well against their Astrologers then, as against anie other Diuiners or Soothsayers: what reason is there, they should make more against ours now, than the like lawes make against our Rhetoricians, Philosophers, Phisitians, and in a maner against all other professours of anie liberall arte? All such being by one Romane decree or other, at one time, or other, vpon one suddaine occasion, or other, banished the citie, as troublesome, and needelesse persons, in a politike and martiall state, so long as the rage of that tempest endured.
Thirdly, admit their Astrological diuinations were lawfully forbidden, being found commonly deceitfull and false, by reason that the art it selfe was then verie vnperfect, and vncertaine, as it continued to the age of Ptolomey, who florished but in the time of the Emperour Antoninus Pius, which succeeded Traian and Adrian: yet may ours neuerthelesse lawfully stand, the art being nowe generallie of the most and best acknowledged to be much more perfectly reformed, and a right art in deede: or if that seeme more, a right science in deede.
For which two last reasons, am to thanke a late conference, that had with my brother Gabriel, about Hallowmas last, touching the validitie of those Romane lawes.
As for other later lawes, statuts, either forreine, or our owne, know not anie that vniuersally and simplie condemne Astrologie: and as for those, that condemne some particular abuse thereof, must needes confesse, they are verie wise, and necessarie ordinaunces, to meete with the lewde practises, and impostures of manie, that vnder the pretence of their figure commit intolerable villanies, wherein for my parte, doubt not, but they deserue the penalties, inflicted vpon them by law, thinking them worthily punished, Pro mensura consultationis, as Vlpian speaketh of his Mathematici in the forenamed title, with this addition of his, following immediatly after in the same place: qui de principis salute, capite puniantur, vel qua alia grauiore paenae afficiantur: extending withall the force of the law in that point, euen to the punishment of other simple wizardes: Qui contra quietem, imperiumque populi Romani, improbandas artes exercent: and finally alleaging the example of the Emperour Marcus, Qui in Syrum insulam eum relegauit, qui motu Cassiano vaticinatus erat, multa quasi instinctu Deorum dixerat: Neither dare excuse either Thrasillus, or Ascletarion, or Gauricus: whereof the first foretold the destruction of Tiberius the Emperour: the second of Domitian: the third of the Bentiuoli in Bononia: or the Priest, that gaue out the rumour of the future murthering of Galeacius Sfortia, Duke of Millaine, (who were all worthily rewarded for their folly) or anie other, that by their Horoscopicall predictions might seeme to harten, hasten one conspirators, to the atchieuing, or attempting of their Princes death, but in that case would wish all Astrologers, either not to deale at all, or else to deale priuately and priuily with the Prince him selfe: then too, to hold Cardanes rule, set downe amongst eight other like conditions, in the end of his booke, De Astrologicie interrogationibus: principi ne magnum malum firmiter vnquam praedixeris, sed periculum: howbeit Cardane him selfe dealt more plainly, and therefore more daungerously with our King Edward the VI. as appeareth in the Iudicials of his natiuitie, giuen out in the beginning of his Duodecim illustres geniturae.
At mihi, ex innata sinceritate, quod miserum adolescentuium amarem, sortisque eius misererer (quoth Cardane there) certum erat, etiam cum manifesto vitae discrimine, omnia patefacere; quamuis futurum crederem, vt me irriderent.
But what followeth? Ergo volentibus fatis, nec singularis hus artis cognitio prodesse regi potuit: nec bonitas, atque simplicitas ingenij, mihi obesse.
Which good successe of Cardane, was partly to be attributed to his owne discreete handling, free from all maner of suspition, but specially to the innocent, and singular good nature of that most noble young King, who accepted so fauourably of his affectionate intention.
But, neither this speciall priuiledge of his being withall a straunger of extraordinarie credit, nor anie like personall example can warrant other priuate men, to intermeddle in like sorte in the natiuities, and destinies of their Princes, otherwise than is before limited, or vpon the Princes owne direct commaundement.
And yet if either this way, or any like, the art happen by some busie, and fonde fellowes to be abused, it hath but the same fortune, that all other artes and sciences haue beside: the Lawiers rule, Abusus non tollit vsum, will still iustifie the right, and commendable practice thereof.
The bounds of which limitation, hauing no way exceeded in anie parte of the Discourse following: hope, there is nothing therin contained, which, considering the premises, might not proceede, euen from one, that were already professed in Diuinitie.
And, then trust, in respect of the matter, haue committed no inconuenience, in recommending the same to the fauour and patronage of such a Diuine, as all England knoweth your Lordship to be: who doubt not, can iudge exactly thereof.
For the maner, am humbly to craue pardon, being neither practised in writing English, nor purposing anie such publike dedication at the first.
It may peraduenture be an occasion, that hereafter shall acquaint my pen better with enditing in our owne tonge.
In the meane time, am to beseech your Reuerend Lordshippe, to respect rather what is here said, than how it is said: presuming that haue litle erred in my iudicials, whatsoeuer defects may chaunce to appeare in the style.
And yet for the verie consequence of the matter too, must say with Tullie, Optanda quidem optima: expectanda deterrima: ferenda quaecunque erunt.
How Gods omnipotencie ouerruleth all causes, and effects, as well particularly in specie, indiuiduo, as vniuersally in genere, haue sufficiently vttered as it were by the way in other places: our last remedie is Christian pacience, if there be no other remedie.
But that is a Theologicall argument, worthie your Lordships handling: and see haue already presumed ouermuch of your Lordshippes pacience, in being thus troublesome, and tedious vnto you, beyonde the compasse of an ordinarie Epistle, or Preface.
Which neuerthelesse durst in no respect haue done, but vpon certaine assurance of that fauourable acceptation, which from time to time, it hath pleased you to vouchsafe the like writings of diuers Vniuersitie men, being litle past my standing there, and namely my brothers Anticosmopolita, when he was not much aboue the same continuaunce.
In full hope, and affiance whereof, will here most humbly take my leaue, committing your Lordship to the protection of God, who giue you many prosperous Newyeares, and long preserue you, to his owne glorie, and the benefit of his Church.

[Figure: [Figure: sky map] To my verie good, and most louing Brother, Master Gabriel Haruey, at his chamber in Trinitie Hall.
GOod Brother, haue in some part done my endeuour to satisfie your late requeste, wherein you aduertise mÃ©e either not so much to addict my selfe to the studie, and contemplation of Iudiciall Astrologie, or else by some euident and sensible demonstration, to make certaine and infallible proofe what general good can do my countrie thereby, or what speciall fruite can reape thereof vnto my selfe.
confesse greater wittes can work greater matters: and mine owne principall studie as yet, is but Philosophie and Phisick, wherein pray God may spÃ©edily growe to any reasonable mediocritie, that maye the sooner procÃ©ed to my final Profession: But seing it is your desire to practise me, as it were to oppose mÃ©e in this kinde: you shall heare, what can briefly say touching the great Co~iunction of Saturne and Iupiter, the next yÃ©ere immediately following.
am to submit my opinion to the censure and correction of those, that are longer studied, and more profoundly seen in this facultie: but that you may not conceiue, haue altogither mispent my time this way, wil endeuour my selfe to make proofe in some sorte, how haue profited in the studie.
Your selfe haue often willed mÃ©e to goe roundly to the matter, withoute eyther glorious insinuations by way of Preface, or pleasurable and conceited floorishes by waye of digression: and therefore presume you wil not blame mÃ©e, though take a direct and plaine course in the discourse following.
First, that Iudiciall Astrologie is neither any vaine and idle studie, nor forbydden and vnlawful Arte, your self hauing long since, taken some reasonable paines therein, and bÃ©eing able to say so much in the defence thereof, out of many olde and new histories of approued authoritie and credit, can sufficiently (I know) and wil readilie (I think) testifie.
The slight arguments of Picus Mirandula, Cornelius Agrippa, and diuers other to ye co~trary, haue bÃ©en throughly answered, by Balantius, Schonerus, Melancto~, Cardane, sundry other, but specially of late by Iunctinus, who in his confutatio~ procÃ©edeth compendiously, and directly from argument to argument, leauing in a manner nothing vntouched, that hath bÃ©ene, or can bÃ©e obiected in disgrace of this knowledge.
And if the autorities of men, that haue giuen them selues that way, make any thing for the purpose, what goodlyer wits in ye worlde, than some in euery cuntrie, that haue made special accou~t, bestowed much trauel in this diuine studie? To let strangers go, these of fresh memorie haue bene none of the basest scholers in England: M.D. Buttes, principal Phisition to king Henry the eight.
Sir Thomas Eliot, Sir Thomas Smyth, who as you best knowe, and haue both truely and honourably testified in your Musarum lachrymae, excelled therin.
M.D. Recorde, both the Digges, M. Dee, who hir maiestie vouchsafeth the name of hyr Philosopher: M. Securis, M. Buckmaster, M. Mounslowe, M.D. Twyne, besides most of our chiefe Doctors in Phisike, as namely our M.D. Baro, in Cambridge, and M.D. Forster in London, and some of our very chiefest Philosophers in either Vniuersitie, yt shalbe nameles, being not so certainly professed and renowmed that way.
But to omit for breuities sake, al other arguments and authorities that might plentifully be alledged in the mayntenaunce of Iudiciall Astrologie, wil content my selfe, and thinke, shall content you with that only famous testimony of Melancton, amongst many of his to the same purpose, set downe in an excellent epistle directed to the two noble honorable Lords, George and Huldrich Fuggeri, in commendation of Astrologie.
Norunt omnes sani prorsus necessariam esse doctrinam, quae anni metas ordinem ostendit.
Quam ob causam sapiens antiquitas hanc cura~ publicÃ¨ doctissimis hominibus, qui custodes erant religionis, commendauit, vt Solis circuitus interualla, aequinoctia, solstitia obseruarentur, mensium spatia, ad Solis iter accommodarent.
But what followeth? Alteram parte~ quae Diuinatrix nominatur, multi acerbÃ¨ vituperant, de qua alibi copiosiÃ¹s dixi.
Quanquam autem nequaquam omnium euentuum humanorum causae sunt, stellarum positus, sapienter causae discernendae sunt, vitandae praestigiae falsarum DiuinationumÂ· tamen certum est, multas in Elementis mutationes, ab Astris oriri: in crasi humanorum corporum, et ingeniorum inclinationibus lumen coeleste magna~ vim habere.
Prodest autem ad valetudinem tutandam nosse crasim corporum, moribus prodest, cernere inclinationes coelestes, eas arte regere, aut fraenare, sicut Pegasum Bellerophontes, ita demÃ¹m rectÃ¨ gubernauit, cu~ Pallas aureum ei fraenum iniecit.
Wherein for his opinion de crasi corporu~ humanorum, he iumpeth with the auncient and most renowmed Phisition Hippocrates, who in his booke de aere, aqua regionibus, bÃ©eing translated into english saieth thus much in effect: If we shall consider duly of the highest causes and bÃ©eings, we shall finde that Astrologie is not the least portion of Phisicke, for it behooueth ye Phisition to know the moone, and the signe of heauen wherin the moone is, when anye patient beginneth to fall sick, so foorth.
But hereof more at some other time, remitting you in the meane while to ye learned Apologie of Iunctinus, who is copious in these pointes, touching the defence of Iudiciall Astrologie.
Now to come spÃ©edily and directly vnto that, whereunto at this present ye particuler occasion draweth me.
which from the creation of the worlde is (to ouerpasse other nÃ©edlesse computations and Chronologies: as how long from Noahs floud? how far from the destructio~ of Troy? how many yeares from the Assirian, Persian, Macedonian monarchie, so forth) The
of April being Sunday, about high noone, there shal happen a very greate and notable Coniunction of the two superiour and weightie Planets Saturne and Iupiter, which Coniunction shall be manifested to the ignorant sort, by many fierce boysterous windes then sode~ly breaking out continuing certain daies before and certaine dayes after the same Coniunction.
These two high planets shal be conioyned in the last minute of the
degre of Pisces, a signe (as is commonly knowne) of the watery Triplicity, feminine, nocturnall, septentrional, commune, cold, moyst, flegmatick, that is wholy of the nature quallitie of water: the essential house of Iupiter, the eraltatio~ of Venus, the gouernour of the fÃ©ete, which Co~iunction may, and ought to sÃ©eme so much the more fearful terrible vnto vs, by how much the more it is very straunge, maruelous, rare, and most specially noted of the learned.
This is called of Astronomers, Coniunctio planetaru~ maxima, quippe qua reguntur leges, imperia, regiones: as Ptolomey the Prince of Astrologers writeth, and Cardane more at large in hys Philosophical, and Astrological Commentaries vpon Ptolomey, This is that Coniunctio~ quae significat prophetam, destructionem quorundam Climatum, sectas, regnum: damna pluuiarum pestile~tiae, as Messahalah witnesseth, whose bookes haue bene much estemed of kinges and Princes.
This is that Coniunction which Alboazen Haly saith doth praesagire mortem regis magni potentis, multam tristitiam hominibus, damnum in diuitibus et nobilibus, etiam in illis qui su~t sicut ProphÃ©tae, et multas locustas.
This is that Coniunction which Guido Bonotus affirmeth, to praemonstrare res magnaes mirandas venturas in mundo.
This is that Coniunction, which Iohannes Molitor surnamed of his contry Regiomo~tanus, a man in my opinion, little inferior in worthinesse, or fame to the former more auncient Astrologers, doth report to portendere continuas aquaru~ inundationes, particularia diluuia.
Finally, this is that Coniunction quae minatur multum mali, as Iunctinus Florentinus testifieth, a great writer at this day, a Co~iunction and mÃ©eting, or ioyning togiter of ye very worst very best planet, Saturne Iupiter, whereof the one is tearmed Infortunium maius, barbarously Infortuna maior, the other, Fortuna maior, both singular in their kinds, the one being (as it were) the Lorde of horrible misrule, and tragicall mischiefes, the other a president of souereigne bounty felicitie, both Heauenly instruments, ordayned by God to those high purposes and intendementes, wherin they are employed, more auncient indÃ©ede than in name, euerlasting workers of contrarie inclinations, and effectes in the worlde, to he short both mighty Princes and potentates in their seuerall actions, so farre as it pleaseth God to auctorize their procÃ©edings, vse their ministery to his owne glory.
Touching whose great coniunction, it is doubtles the more hard and difficult, to set downe any certaine effects Accidents, therof to ensue, because the Fortune and Infortune are equally matched, and as it were, indifferently encountered wyth power and strength: For if the Infortune had bene greater and stronger than the Fortune, as if Saturne hadde bene ioyned with Venus, which is called Fortuna maior, Saturn no doubt would haue chalenged the prerogatiue or preeminence vnto himselfe, as being mightier of more force: or if Iupiter had bÃ©ene ioyned with Mars himselfe being Fortuna maior, and the other Infortunium minus, he would so haue repressed the sturdines and furie of Mars, that the operations and effectes of that Coniunction should haue bene indifferent, that is rather good than euill.
Wherevpon in this case Guido Bonatus a famous and renowmed Astrologian of Italy, (as you knowe) in his fift Treatise de
especiall wayes and principall points, wherein an Astrologer may soonest be deceiued, and moste easily ouershoote himselfe, maketh this the fourth, Difficile erit aliquid certi iudicare, si aequales fuerint Fortunae cum Infortunijs.
Moreouer these two planets doe not beholde one another by any aspectuall radiation, as either by Trine or Sextile, which are aspectes of amity frendship, or by Quartile and opposition, which are aspectes of enmity and hatred, for then it had bene somwhat ye easier to determine thereof in respect of the general Iudgeme~t, but they are ioyned togither in one degrÃ©e, and one minute of the selfe same degrÃ©e and signe, whiche is termed of the Astrologers, Corporalis congressus, Coitus, or Coniunctio, being alwayes of more power, strength, force, and efficacie, than anye other aspect, because as Stoeflerinus writeth in his
Proposition: In ea radij maximÃ¨ propter vnionem condensantur, which also Hermes Trismegistus himselfe affirmeth in verbo septimo, where he sayth: Aspectus non potest diminuere significationem Coniunctionis, Coniunctio verÃ² minuit significationem aspectus, why? nam fortior est aspectu, as there followeth.
And yet by nature it is simplye and essentially neither good nor euill, but sometimes good and somtimes euil, according to the nature and disposition of the planets, which are conioyned, so that consequently, quia Coniunctio honorum bona est, malorum autem mala, difficilÃ¨ admodum erit iudicium in Coniunctione illa, quae bona respectu Iouis pernitiosa respectu Saturni iudicatur.
Diuers of ye learned in this facultie namely Alboazen Haly, Capite
partis octauae saith, quÃ²d Iupiter iunctus cum Saturno prohibet omne malum, whereas Franciscus Iunctinus auoucheth the contrarie, to wit, that Coniunctio boni cum malo, mala est, alleaging this very Coniunction of Saturne and Iupiter for example, but on both sides they co~clude with this clause or definitiue sentence, hoc tamen pro natura dispositione planetae vincentis in figura iudicandu~ est.
This therfore now only remaineth, to consider which of them shal be strongest, and of moste vertue, power and might in the heauen at that instant.
For Mesahalah in his excellent Treatise de Coniu~ctionibus planetaru~, deliuereth this iudgeme~t, Scito quÃ²d cum Iupiter fortior fuerit Saturno, significabit bonum in eadem Coniunctione, si verÃ² Saturnus praeerit significabit detrimentum atque tribulationem, which is also generally agrÃ©ed vpo~ with ye rest.
Wherfore we are to vnderstand, that Iupiter is ioyned with Saturne in Pisces, which is hys owne proper and naturall house, but by night, and not by day, which is a little the woorse, because him selfe being a masculine, diurnal, and fortunate planet, he doth not so much reioyce in a feminine, nocturnal, and infortunat signe, as he doth in a signe of his owne disposition qualitie.
For so Alcabitius one of ye most notable Arabians, very well concludeth in Isagogae astrologicae prima differentia: Fortitudo Planetae reboratur quando est in suo Alhaiz, id est in sua similitudine masculinus scilicet diurnus in signo, gradu masculino diurno: nocturnus verÃ² faemininus contra, which is likewise auouched by his Commentator Ioannes de Saxonia. whereof by a contrary sequele it foloweth, that a masculine and diurne planet is somewhat depressed and weakened in a feminine and a nocturnall signe, and yet because it is the house of Iupiter, and himselfe resident therein, as in hys owne mansion place, and court (albeit Sagittarie be the house of his speciallest delight and ioy) he receiueth fiue dignities thereby, bÃ©eing by so much the more strong, and vertuous, according to that sensible axiome of Guido Bonatus, capite
Dum planeta est in domo sua, est sicut vir existens in propria domo: est autem quilibet fortior in domo sua de Iure, quÃ m in aliena, vt plurimÃ¹m de facto quÃ m alius, qui aliÃ s esset fortior eoÂ· vnde Trutanus, Ante suam gallus stat portam quisque vasallus.
But yet Iupiter is not so highly promoted exalted by hys owne house, but is well nigh as much humbled and weakened by his vnlucky placing in the eight house of Death wherby he looseth foure prerogatiues, then is he there also afflicted and oppressed by the presence company of frowning Saturne, and in the termes of Mars hys deadely enemy, in quarta coeli faeminina, Meridional discende~t, which do also much decrease and abate his courage.
So that it euidently appeareth, that the good planet Iupiter is but indifferent: that as he will not do much harme so he can not doe much good.
Now concerning Saturne, as Iupiter was neuer the better, because he was in signo faeminino nocturno, so Saturne bÃ©eing in the same signe, and also a diurnall and masculine planet is much the worse.
For Messahalah in his golden booke, de reuolutione annorum mundi, the chapter intituled de anno timendo, saith plainely Saturnus in signo diurno et masculino minus impedit, so that by an argume~t drawen fro~ ye co~trary may logically co~clude ye In loco nocturno et faeminino magis impedit, but this impedime~t is nothing to speak of or verie smal in co~parison of ye rest: for besides that he is in a feminine and nocturnall signe, place of heauen contrary to his proper nature, he is withall peregrine too, and out of al his essential dignities in the same signe, wherby he hath fiue debilities or impedimentes.
Furthermore he is placed in domo octaua, whereby he hath foure more hinderances, slow in motion, whereby he hath two detrimentes.
In so much that if we set and oppose his
debilities, and the debilities of Iupiter against his fiue vertues, which is two to one, there is no doubt, but we wil soone may truly conclude, Si illius Fortuna cum huius Infortunijs comparetur, nihil est: Iupiter is Orientall, so is Saturne: Iupiter is direct in motion, so is Saturne: Iupiter is frÃ©e from combustion, so is Saturne: Iupiter is little the better for his vertues, because his hinderances are full as many, but Saturne is much ye worse for his debilities, because hys vertues bÃ©e not so many.
For as Guido Bonatus notably determineth, Mali Planetae quantÃ² magis sunt impediti, tantÃ² efficiuntur deteriores, augmentatur eorum malitia, eorum impedimentum.
SÃ©e the infortunate disposition of infortunate planets the more they be troubled, disturbed or intangled, the worse and more malicious they are and consequently do hurt and annoy the more spitefully.
The conclusion summe of al muste nedes be this, that the veheme~t hatred, despite malice of the vnlucky planet Saturne, hathe by his mischieuous importunitie ouercome vanquished the good, wholsome, swete nature of the beneuolous and fauourable planet Iupiter, which victory (I feare me) and thinke am too sure thereof, will cause great aboundance of waters, and much colde wether, much vnwonted mischiefes sorow, much enuie, debate, quarelling, hatred and strife, many grieuous and bitter contentions, muche going to lawe one with another for deade mens goodes and olde reckonings, manifold troubles, and sodain vproares, much violent oppression, extreame pouertie, hunger and misery to the nedy and impotent sort of people, great persecutio~s of ecclesiastical persons, much despitefull, iniurious, and wrongful dealing, as also the tragical ruine destructio~ of sundry greatmen and noble personages, bothe olde and young, wherof some shall trecherously be entangled entrapped, some violently ouerthrowne wyth shameful disgrace and dishonour, losing bothe estimation, goods and life too.
Greate feare and dreade shal come sodainely vpon the people, a great sterilitie and barre~nesse of the earth shal ensue, manifold submersions, shipwracks, exustions, burnings, and such other, waterie and fierie calamities wil followe: finally, a verie greate and sore mortalitie, with many generall contagions, and pestilent diseases, both among men and beasts, and specially an extraordinarie death and destruction of fishes, and al other creatures liuing, by, in, or vpon ye waters.
Al which euils and miseries, (howbeit knowe euery man shall not personally fÃ©ele them, yet if there appeare not a sensible difference betwene certaine yeares immediately following, and other ordinary yeares, let me lose the credit of my Astrologie) shall bÃ©e the more dreadful and terrible, because the good amiable planet Iupiter is so much abased and humbled in the eight house, being simply the very worst place of the heaue~s that can be, called commonly of the Astronomers, domus inca~tationum, veneficiorum, timoris, magni infortunij, et etiam mortis: who will also begin to shrink and go backward the
day of Noue~ber, which shrinking too wil not a litle hinder his good and prosperous influence.
All which time, frowning Saturne shal be retrocedent also, beginning his retrogradatio~ the
day of Noue~ber, yea and that which is more notable for the space continuance of these whole fiue or sixe years togither, they shal both be very often retrograde, and more than commonly they vse to be: and this withall is to be obserued ye these two superior planets Saturne and Iupiter shall the second time also be very nigh the one ye other, ye
being then almost conioyned againe togither in Pisces, but both retrograde, not long before, at the beginning of the second Reuolution, and third part of the Astronomical yeare: to wit, at the Sunnes entrance into the Equinoctial signe Libra, most vnluckily and ilfaringly placed in the
house, which must nÃ©eds greatly increase their malice, and make their operations the more vnhapy vnfortunate.
The vnlucky constellation and constitution of the other planets, doth also sÃ©eme to helpe forward augment the lamentable eue~ts threatned by this Coniunction'.
For fiery and furious Mars peregrine occidental in the fourth degrÃ©e, and sixt minut of Leo, and placed in Gacodaemone, In domo vbi tristes, tragici, exitiales euentus notantur, hauing there no lesse than
impediments, whereby he is much afflicted, gretly disgraced, but ye more perniciously hurtful and malicious, portendeth wonderful contention, sedition, treason, rebellion and warre: many tumults, mutinies vprores, with horrible shedding of bloud, and warranteth this terrible Prognosticatio~, that huge multitudes shall be spoyled, subdued, destroyed and murdered of their enemies, who shal furiously assaulte, cruelly, vnmercifully and barbarously oppresse them perforce, with sword fire, And because Mars, who is a fierce, violent, and outragious planet, is placed in Leo, a hot, cholerick fiery signe, which notwithstanding of all the signed of ye Zodiaque is most excellent and most noble, for that it is so goodlily gallantly adorned and decked with so many beutiful and notable fixed starres, bearing signification onely of high and great matters, concerning states, kingdomes and empires, bÃ©eing ye naturall, essentiall, and onely proper house of the mighty roial planet Sol, who is the signifier of Princes, Potentates, and high Magistrates: but a mortall and deadly enimie vnto Mars, who is now most infortunately seated in his house: many tragicall mischiefes and notorious calamities and presaged to some great rulers and mighty gouernours, placed in soueraigne and supreme authoritie, or else it is vehemently to be feared, that in the East, and Southeast cuntries, a desperate company of vile and villanous rascals shall flocke togither, and seditiously, rebelliously, and traiterously arise in armes against their Princes and Magistrates: who, (as a dogge hath a day, and a spider prouision of ill fauoured gÃ©ere to serue hir turne) shall for a time violently set vpon, and vehemently afflict many: which maugre their heads, must suffer grieuous and spitefull indignities.
And yet because he is Lord and Ruler of the
House, wherein Mercury is most vnluckily appointed, being not longe since muche discouraged and discomfited of him by a hatefull Quartyle Aspect: it sÃ©emeth that diuerse persecutions are threatned vnto sundrye Ecclesiasticall persons, which shall be muche disquieted and vexed by their rage.
All which maladies shall be the more hurtfull and vehement, because he is entred into a fixed signe: according to that maxime of Haly, Capite quarto partis octauae.
Siquando Mars fuerit in signo fixo, significat fortes lites inter Reges, eiectos, and in another place his iudgement is: Si Mars fuerit in signo fixo, significat lites sine ratione causa.
Beside, he wil do the more harme also, because he is in a masculine and diurnall signe: Nam in signo foeminino loco noctis, minoris impedimenti est: as Messahalah sayth in his booke, De Reuolutione Annorum mundi, the chapter.
place from the Horoscope, threatneth great losse and destruction in all kindes of beastes, that haue hoofes, or flÃ©eces, and with all prognosticateth that pismires, waspes, and other flyes, and vermyne shall not greatly abound.
Furthermore, because he is seated in the eyght house from the Moone, ipse significat interfectiones infirmitates magnas in hminibus.
To all which euills they shall be moste subiect, which inhabite such regions, prouinces, territories, and cities, as are vnder the partition of the hotte signe Leo.
Item, Sol Lorde of the Ascendent, but peregrine, and out of all his essential dignities in the sixtÃ©enth degrÃ©e, and eyght and fortieth minute of Taurus, the night House of Venus, and resident in the tenth house, (the house of dominion, and power, wherein he would greatly haue reioyced, had he not bene so infortunately disgraced by his weakenesse) will also helpe to increase the furie and outrage of Mars, causing much trouble, vexation, and sorrowe, to some noble men, and honourable personages: yea this his placing doth furthermore signifie, that manye Magistrates shall be thrust out of office, and depriued of all dignitie, and other aduaunced to their roomes, who peraduenture shal scarcely be so good, but moste likely to verifie the Prouerbe, Seldome commeth the better.
Item, Venus Ladye of the tenth house, being both peregrine, and combust, doth increase the signification of the Sunne, who because he is Lorde of the Ascendent, and infortunately seated in her house, signifieth a badde state, not onely of Princes, but of their subiects too: which badde state shall specially be founde in the countries situat betwene the East and the Weast: Moreouer Venus, who naturally is very fortunate, and a planet of a good and amiable nature, being withall setled in the
house, the house of amitie, friendship, good fortune, would haue pronounced much good, if she had not bene so vnluckily peregrine in the second degrÃ©e, and third minut of Gemini, being there also combust, and accompanied with the mischieuous Catabibazon: which is with all as vnhappy, and pernicious, as may be, by reason of hir fall in Geminis, in domo casus sui.
For which cause she is therefore to signifie much suttle dissembling, and false packing amongest men: litle faithfull and sound friendship, but much counterfait and fained amitie: naye, manye through vncurteous dealing, and falshood, shal breake of friendship, so that one shal hardly repose any trust in another: besides, she foresheweth that much hatred, discord, and strife, much matter of diuisions factions, much debate co~tention shal ensue: yet some naughty vngodly persons, (wherof the world shall neuer be to seeke, but what remedie?) are like to accord agrÃ©e togither wel enough, or rather ill enough.
For much shameful filthy whoredom shal be secretly committed, diuerse shall giue ouer them selues to pleasure, voluptuousnesse, ryot, vnlawful concupiscence, lecherie, forbidden lustes, and other vncleane misdemeanours.
But let those that are so corruptly, vilanously affected, beware in time, beast for euery dram of momentanie pleasure, they be rewarded with a pound of durable sorow.
For besides that many therby shal be shrewdly endammaged, presently punished, according to the qualitie of their deserts: the rest of that vngracious crew, vnlesse they repent, and amend the sooner, shal altogither most wofully perish, be vtterly destroied, both goods, body, soule too.
Haly his iudgement is, ye Venus iuncta cum cauda Draconis, significat destructionem futuram in mulieribus: and this he also as resolutely affirmeth, that Venus infortunata in vndecima domo, praesagit leguminum caritate~.
Finally, am perswaded, that she will cause very many winds, bringing very much raine, by reason of her occidentall combustion in Geminis, in the house termes of Mercury.
And, as for Mercury, he in statione secunda, placed in domo peregrinationum, itinerum, rerum sacrarum, religionis: but peregrine, and much afflicted in the
minut of Aries, in the house termes of Mars his mortall enimie, doth signifie many iorneys, and voyages, much trauailing, great remouing from place to place, (for Aries as euery one knoweth, is a moueable signe, and Mercury a conuertible, and wauering planet) but not without many losses, dammages, and troubles: so generally true it is, that is commonly alledged in a manner to this very purpose.
For sundry grieuances, much theft, many violent robberies, and spoylings, with wilfull murder, and cruell interfections shall be committed, in such wise, that plaine, innocent, and true meaning men, (whereof our world now a dayes is not greatly lauish) and the honest and faithfull dealing marchaunt, shall eftsoones goe in daunger of losing both goods and life.
Furthermore, this his vnlucky constitution doth portend the irreligious, and impious behauiour of diuers wicked, obstinate, stubborne, and disorderly persons, who will not care most desperately to conspyre, euen against heauen it selfe, and most horribly to abuse, euen Iesus himselfe, in not esteeming his sacred blessed word, in reuiling his zealous preachers, in making no account of religion, pietie, and godlines, in abandoning God him selfe out of their companie, and betaking them selues to all villanie.
Likewise this his infortunate state, threatneth like troubles, detriments, and daungers vnto those, that are Mercurists, as namely, vnto Embassadors, secretaries, Notaries, Registers, Clarks, Scriueners, Messengers, Factours, Mercers, such other: as also vnto diuers of the learneder sorte, amongst whom some hote controuersies, and contentions are like to arise, touching some new contrary opinions, and heresies, which shal be inuented, published, and maintained by certaine busie fellowes, and factious heads, too affectionately wedded to their owne conceits.
minut of Sagittarius, decreasing in light, and accompanied with hir Dragons head, in the fourth house, and nigh the fift, being but sixe houres before, most infortunately in opposition, and at destance with the gentle and mercifull planet Venus, of whom spake before, betokeneth many heauie calamities, impriso~ments, disturbances, and tribulations, with much thought, anguish, and sorrow amongst the common people, who not withstanding shall not be punished or afflicted, but according to their owne rebellious deserts, and misdemeanors: for hir opposition with Venus, ladie of the
house, signifieth the disloyall and vnfaithfull hartes of many frowarde and disobedient persons, rebelliously set against their Magistrates, helping forwarde the mischiefes and horrors presaged by the infortunate constitution of Mars.
And through hir companie with the Drago~s head, ipsa significat consumptiones, multas aquas, damnu~ in frugibus, as a credible author testifieth.
And hir application vnto frowning Saturne, by an aspectuall radiation, meane, a malitious quartile aspect: denotat, quÃ²d accident hominibus infirmitates mortiferae, somnia horrenda, opiniones expauescibiles, prouenientes ex abundantia melancholiae.
Sol est anima mundi, qui si quando maleficus fuerit, intemperie afficietur AÃ«r, vt cÃ¹m Luna malefica est, afficitur terra.
An other iudgement of his is thus deliuered in the thirde chapter of the same eight part: Si quando tota Triplicitas ignea fuerit infortunata, (as now it is in the figure erected for the time speake of) accident damna, occasiones magnae Dominis, Regibus, claris hominibus.
Idem significat signi vndecimae Domus, eius oppositi, scilicet, signi quintae Domus, (in which signe Luna is now placed) mala, infortunata constitutio.
Item, Saturne placed in the eight house, and lord of the sixte house, which is domus aegritudinum, morborum, seruitutis corporis, foresheweth many dangerous, and mortall diseases, which are like to raigne and rage in their kind: as also the stubberne, disobedient, and ill disposed affections of diuerse seruaunts towardes their Lordes and maisters.
house, which is domus Coniugij, Inimicitiae, Contentionum forensiu~, furti, aliorum scelerum, threatneth many troublesome, and terrible euents, which are like to be as mischieuously acco~plished.
houses, togither with certaine other Incidents, which by the figure erected might Astrologically be gathered, for breuities sake, and for some other good considerations, adde nothing, acknowledging that the heauenly and almightie Iupiter, (that may so speake) sitting aboue Sol and Luna in his euerlasting maiestie, ruleth both Saturne and Iupiter, at his gratious will and pleasure, as also furious Mars him self, with Venus, and Mercury too: quae inclinant modÃ², non necessitant, as is truely answeared in an olde distinction.
Neuerthelesse, am verily perswaded, that no Nation, or Countrie shall beholde this great Coniunction vnpunished: but amo~gst the rest, they graunt, shall especially feele the vehement force, and violence thereof, that inhabite such regions, as are subiect to the first, and second Climat.
Thus, as compendiously, as on the suddaine could, haue here, Brother, written downe, in what signe, and parte of heauen euery planet shall be placed: how affected and disposed in the celestiall scheme, at that very instant and moment, in which this great, and wonderfull Coniunction shall happen, with the seuerall, and speciall significations of eche of them particularly, according to the place of their residence at that time: agrÃ©eing wholy wt the Astrological iudgements, and predictions of the most auncient and best approued writers in this profession.
Which haue done to this ende, to shewe as it were in a glasse, what concordaunce and agrÃ©ement, there shall then appeare betwÃ©ene one planet and another: and what good or euill euery one of them shall for his part procure: good, by diminishing, slaking, and repressing the misfortunes which are presaged by the Coniunction: euill, by helping forwarde, and encreasing the perilous malice, and as it were, venemous spite thereof.
Nowe, to treate somewhat more specially touching the weather, constitution of the aier, haue good coniecturall Arguments to persuade me, that great store of rayne and colde is lyke to ensue, that wÃ©e shall haue much haile, thunder, and lightning, much vnseasonable, immoderate, tempestuous, and boysterous weather, that huge waters shall arise, that floudes extraordinarily shall increase, many ouerflowings happen, diuerse irruptions of waters suddainly breake out, causing some losse by lande, but muche greater decaye of substaunce by shipwrackes on the seas, whereby very many shall be shrewdely endammaged, and not a fewe vtterly vndane.
Whiche operations and effectes the late Eclipse of the Sunne, which happened the laste yeare
the twentie daye of Iune in the watrie signe Cancer, shall meruailously helpe forwarde and augment, especially in winter this yeare,
for these foresaide Accidentes shall continewe vntill the beginnyng of the nexte sprynge after, Anno
At which time about the ende of March, and the beginning of Aprill, there shall happen a wonderfull, straunge, and rare Coniunction, conuent, or assemblie in a maner of all the planets in Aries, a fierie signe.
So that then both Saturne and Iupiter shall forsake Pisces the last signe of the watrie Triplicitie, and inhabite Aries the firste signe of the fierie Triangularitie: which alteration from one contrarie triplicitie to his contrary, cannot be without diuerse newe effects opposite to the former.
For so Haly concludeth, Duo planetae ponderosi, (as Saturne and Iupiter are) semper faciunt diuersitates sua mutatione de vna triplicitate in aliam, de vna natura in aliam, de vna haiz in aliam.
Wherefore now the watrie Trigone shal perish, and be turned into fire.
Iupiter shall be ioyned with Sol, with Mercury, and with Luna: Saturne shall be ioyned with Venus, and with Mercury: Mercury shall be in Coniunction with Iupiter, and with Mars: Luna shall be one while ioyned with Saturne, another while with Venus, another with Mars, with Iupiter the second time, and then with Mercury, and lastly of all, there shall be a great Coniunction of Iupiter, and Mars, which is the third waightie planet, and in malice litle inferiour vnto deuouring Saturne him self.
After which kind of Coniunctions, some terrible, and fearfull Comet, or blazing starre is like presently to ensue: for the congresse of planets in a fierie signe, doth commonly foreshew, and in dÃ©ede naturally cause a blazing star.
As by induction of examples might at large be discoursed, but one for euery signe shall suffice.
in the same moneth of March, when there was the like coaceruation of both superiour and inferiour planets in this very signe Aries, there followed immediatly a great Comet.
after the like mÃ©eting of the planets in the second fierie signe Leo, their appeared likewise a fierie Comet.
As also after their Coniunction in the third fierie signe Sagittary, Anno
before the death of the inuincible and moste renowned Emperour Carolus Magnus, there ensued in like manner a terrible, and tragicall Comet.
And if a Comet, as haue now problably inferred, shall arise, these effects must be looked for, much scorching and vehement heate, the drying vp of ponds and dÃ©epe waters: barren, and vnfrutefull fieldes: and consequently, a dearth of all victuals, beside a sore death of cattel, and many pestilent diseases amongst men.
But if no Comet appears, there shall doubtlesse be sÃ©ene other horrible and rufull visions in the Heauens, and many very straunge terrible sights in the middle region of the aier, as fierie Meteors, flashings, and flamings of fire, wonderfull traiections, and impressions, much lightning, and thunder mixte with haile.
Whereby many shall be perillously terrified, and some miserably vndone.
For euen at the very selfe same time the operations and effectes of the sunnes Eclipse, which hapned the last yeare,
as also of this great straunge Coniunction shall still continue: which shall afterward be accompanied with another fearefull and pernicious Eclipse,
in Tauro, nigh the head of Medusa, called of ye Arabians, Caput Algol, a most hurtful, violent, cruell, and mortall fixed starre, of the nature of Saturne and Venus.
Whose significations for so muche as they are not alike, the one threatning vehement heat, the other extreame cold, and with all the great Coniunction of Saturne and Mars in Pisces, a watrie signe: and the great Coniunction of Iupiter and Mars in Aries a fierie signe, both in Aprill next,
being thereunto ioyned, whereof also the one threatneth excessiue cold, the other excÃ©eding heate, there must necessarily follow very great inequalitie of the aier, very much inconstancie and alteration of the weather, which mutual infraction of qualities, non nisi coruscationes nubium sequentur, as Leouitius speaketh, yet the force and power of this Coniunction shall heare most effectuall swaye, especially in March, Aprill, May, and Iune, Anno
bycause then most of the planets shall runne there course in hote and drie signes, as also
in March, Aprill, and May, when Mars a hote and fierie fellowe shall possesse a hote and drie signe: with whome Saturne shall fellowship himselfe, being then too seated in a fierie signe, one while in Co~iunction with Venus, another while with Sol, with Mercury, and with the Moone, with whom also Mars and the other planets shall be mingled: which Coniunctions shall al happen in firie signes.
And this yÃ©ere say I, is like to proue an vnhappie yeare for diuines, religious persons.
the effects of these mÃ©etings shall euidently appeare at which time, there shall fall out a Coniunction of Sol Saturne, Mars and Venus, Mars Mercury, Venus and Mercury, Saturne Mercury, Saturne Venus, Sol and Luna, Saturne Luna, Mars Luna, Venus Luna, Mercury Luna, and lastly of Saturne Mars, which is a great Coniunction, and therefore the worse, and more terrible.
Which Coniunctions for asmuch as they shall all happen in the same signe Aries, a fierie signe, there must nÃ©edes ensue diuerse straung effects, much ferue~t excÃ©eding heat, many rare dreadful impressions in the highest region of the aier, and consequently a sore and perillous drought.
To make shorte, in this yeare sundrie wofull, and cruell euils, togither with many straunge and horrible euents shal sensibly appeare, which shall principally molest and afflict the weastwarde countries.
But of these terrours, one of vs, eyther I, or if my leysure, by meanes of my finall profession, happen to fayle me, my brother Iohn will treate more particularly hereafter, (if God spare vs lyfe), in there seuerall and sundrie yeares, according as the effects, and operations of the aforesaide Coniunctions shall specially worke, and take place: as also of the Comet with the Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone, which haue onely touched here, reseruing euery such notable particular Accident, to his proper time and place, then seuerally to be discussed eyther by me, or by him.
This alone will adde, as a nÃ©edefull Caution and admonition for those, which in there natiuities had Aries placed in their Horoscope, accompanied with other planets, or which had the superiour planets placed then in the same signe of the Zodiaque, as also for those, which had ye great light of heauen, the Sunne meane, or the lord of the ascendent, or the lord of the natiuitie placed in Aries, illi enim in primis ad choraeas coelestes inuitabuntur, aliquÃ­dque noui molientur, the iudgement carrieth sufficient authoritie.
And especially let Germanie and Italy beware, for many grieuous calamities, with suddaine chaunces and chaunges are threatned to the countries there aboutes, by this forcible concurse of planets in Aries: these nations bÃ©eing chiefely and principally vnder the regiment of that signe, wherevnto our Astrologers adde namely the Regions, and Seigniories following: Britaine, Fraunce, Bastarnia, Syria, Philistim, Polonia minor, highe Burgonie, Sueuia of Germanie, Sylesia superior, Pars Westriae, Naples, Florence, Capua, Ferraria, Verona, Vicentia, Bergamum, Imola, Padua, Brusuicum, Vtricha, Lindauia, Cracouia, Marsilia, Saragossa, with certaine other Territories, and Prouinces neare adioyning.
PraetereÃ , the same signe beyng the house and mansion place of Mars, there are portended many lamentable, and wofull casualties in battayle, vnto the Germaine and Italian souldiers: whiche shall fall out, eyther by treacherie, and prodition, or through the carelesse securitie and sluggishnesse of their Captaines, two perillous and deadly enimies to Martiall procÃ©edings, as by all histories is moste manifest, specially to you, that are so perfectly acquainted with them.
Now, touching the whole continuaunce of the aforesayde straunge effectes, and operations of this present great Coniunction, suppose it will suffise to quote the iudgement of the famous Philosopher, and Phisitian Cardane, deliuered in his Commentaries, vpon Ptolomeis Quadripartita Constructio, concernyng that poynt.
Whose wordes are thus set downe verbatim in the seconde booke, ninth chapter, and LIV, Text of those excellent Commentaries.
Effectus durant ad reditum, vtpote Coniunctio Saturni Iouis, vsque ad aliam coniunctionem: Saturni ingressus in initium Arietis, vsque ad alium ingressum in initium Arietis, quia nihil datur inane in natura, ideo si effectus non duraret vsque ad reditum, esset circuitus Mathematicus, non Naturalis, causa sine effectu, impotentia quaedam.
Quamobrem, proportio circuitus ad circuitum, vt temporis ad tempus quod erat probandum.
Vnusquisque tamen horum circuituum redigitur ad dimidium, nam ab oppositione finitur coniunctionis vis, attenditurque ipsa oppositio.
Whiche place of Cardane may summarily suffise for warrant of the continuaunce, so farre as Art, and mans foresight extendeth.
For otherwise, vt caetera omnia, sic planetae in Manu Domini, who is truely termed of the olde Philosophers, Ens Entium, and Causa Causarum, wherin am to subscribe to the opinio~ of the noble Mathematicia~ Astrologer, Petrus Pitatus, who in the Proeme to his Diaria, giueth out this learned iudgement: Ex futurorum euentuum generibus; sunt, quae habent causam determinatam, infallibilem, vt motus coeli, ortus, occasus signorum, Coniunctiones planetarum, luminarium Eclipses, similia: in quibus est determinatio, infallibilitas ex parte motoris, atque etiam omnis impedimenti remotio, ex parte qualibet, nisi in quantum subiacent diuinae voluntati, Prouidentiae, quae tamen semper OrdinatÃ¨ agit: with much more importing the same conclusion, his onely exception is, ni secus prima causa, secundae miraculose impediantur.
And thus much touchyng the notable effectes, and operations of this great Coniunction, in the last face of Pisces, and the firste of Aries.
Now, by a sensible conference of the same with other Coniunctions, whiche haue heretofore happened in the watrie Trigone not without certaine famous, and moste notable euents consequently ensuyng: will presume, to set downe certaine Conclusions, collected out of auncient iudgementes and predictions of Astrologie, whereby it shoulde in greate likehood appeare not onely that sundrie, rare, and wonderfull euents must nÃ©edes follow, but also that the very frame of the worlde, cannot endure long after.
Wherefore, to speake onely of the watrie Trigone, which shall now beare rule for a time, which Trigone consisteth of these thrÃ©e signes of the Zodiaque, Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces: it sÃ©emeth a resolute case, (vnlesse my induction marueylously faileth me) that their neuer hapned any great Coniunction of the superiour planets in any of those thrÃ©e signes, but some extraordinary chaunge, and notorius alteration ensued.
First, after the mightie Coniunction of the two highest planets, Saturne and Iupiter in Cancer, which is reckened the first signe of the foresaide watrie Triplicitie, (which Coniunction hapned in angulo quartae domus, the ninth moneth from March first called of the Romanes, and now of vs Nouember) the world was ouerflowed with that wonderfull exceeding deluge, which to this day doth, and shal euer beare the name of Noahs floude: such a floude as the world shall neuer sÃ©e againe.
Secondly, this fourth Monarchie, called the Romane Monarchie, to follow the common distinction, (howsoeuer Monsier Bodine probably reasoneth to the contrary) wherein we now liue, and are still to preferre before the Turkish Monarchie, sÃ©eme it neuer so ample and huge, began vnder the dominio~ of the watrie Trigone: for the
yeare before the glorious natiuitie of our sauiour Iesus Christ, and fiue yeares before the destructio~ of the most valerous and puissant captaine, Iulius Caesar there hapned a great Co~iunction of the superiour planets in Scorpio, the seconde signe of the same Triplicitie, at whiche time that most Memorable and notorious ciuill war betwÃ©ene Caesar and Pompey, was verie hote and violent, the end whereof ensued a litle after the same Coniunction, whereupon Iulius Caesar hauing oppressed the contrarie force, and valiantly subdued his enimies, whiche defended their auncient state, and common libertie, did first establish this fourth most noble Monarchie.
Thirdly, not long after this, namely, sixe yÃ©eres before the happie birth of our RedÃ©emer, there hapned a Coniunction of these mighty superiour planets, Saturne and Iupiter, in the last face of Pisces, which is the laste signe of the watry Trigone, the beginning of Aries, which is the first signe of the fierie Trigone, which Coniunction hapned neuer since, but only in the daies of the worthy christian Emperour, Carolus Magnus, Anno.
yeares ago, but is now to happen once againe in this present yeare
Touching which, forasmuch as it is the last Coniunction that euer shal happen in the end of the watrie Trigone, am Astrologically induced to this co~iecture, that we are most like to haue a new world, by some suddaine, violent, wonderful straunge alteration, which euen hÃ©eretofore hath alwaies hapned, at the ending of one Trigone, beginning of an other, but now most especially is like to happen, bicause ye co~trarie Trigone succÃ©edeth his co~trarie, the fierie followeth ye watrie, vnder which, or the like succession, a notable mutation hath already hapned two seuerall times: to wit, in the time of Iulius Augustus Caesar, when as this fourth Monarchie (as said before) was established with much effusion of bloud: againe in the time of Carolus Magnus, and his father Pypin, (as also said before) at which time, as histories report, Monarchia haec eneruata aliquantum respirauit: yea, your Paulus Iouius, as you beste remember, after two or thrÃ©e other moste honourable grÃ©etings, saluteth this noble Emperour with these gallant Titles, Salue Christiani Imperij propagator augustissime, Pontificiae dignitatis assertor vindex, aureaeque demum aetatis conditor: which last addition of Iouius, maketh most for our purpose, togither with that superlatiue Iustification of his surname not much before, non magni modÃ², sed Ter Maximi cognomento dignissime so that withall we forget not what the same Iouius shortly after writeth, continuing the foresaide braue Apostrophe, directed vnto Charlmaine him selfe: Te Auspice, Italia in primis, quae iampridem Gothis, Vandalis deformata, prostrataque, ferrei saeculi iniurias pertulerat, se vsqueadeo faelici rerum omnium prouentu erexit, vt pristinae amplitudinis ornamenta reciperet. hauing a litle before giue~ out certaine other commendations of his martiall prowes, tempered with deuotion and wisedome, in these honourable Terms: his longÃ¨ optimis belli pacis artibus, non indomitos modÃ² Saxones, peruicaces Cantabros, perpetuis victorijs deuictos, verÃ¹m, quod ad perenniorem laudem nobilius fuit, Longobardos arroganter impiÃ¨ sacrosancto Pontifici infaestos, Deo vltore, funditus excisos videmus.
But, to leaue the second foundation, and as it were, the reedifying of the imperiall Monarchie vnder Charlmaine, which is farre better knowne vnto you, than vnto me, (how be it by the way it would not be forgotten, that Romanum Imperium apud Graecos perstitit Constantini Magni Temporibus, vsque ad Tempora Caroli Magni, in quem nomen duntaxat Imperij translatum est ad Germanos, as Agrippa writeth in his inuectiue discourse, De Nobilitate: and to returne now to the present Coniunction, co~sidering that this fourth Monarchie began first about the ende of the watrie Trigone, and was afterwarde weakened and decayed vnder the same, as appeareth by the premisses: maye it nowe sÃ©eme likely and probable inough, that it shall also finally be ended and destroyed vnder the same Trigone? And, for somuch, as our Lord and Sauiour tooke our humane nature vpon him, beyng borne of the virgin Marie in Bethlem, at the ende of the watrie Trigone, and the beginning of the fierie Trigon: the same now happening againe, may it not also signifie and portend, some wonderfull and maruelous alteration shortly after to ensue? yea, why not euen that great, dreadfull time, wherin the same Ihesus Christ, shal come againe in vnspeakeable maiestie, to iudge both the quicke and the dead, consuming the whole world by fire? for now shall the fierie Trigone raigne, and all the Coniunctions of the superiour planets which hereafter shall happen, shall continually be in fierie signes, till the accomplishment almost of
In the raigne of Carolus Magnus, albeit the like Coniunction happened, yet the world could not then be at an ende: howbeit euen at that very time, there were excÃ©eding great Co~tentions amongest Princes, debated with many fierce battailes, horrible murders, much shedding of bloud: to which effect can not but remember those goodly verses of the excellent Italian Poet, Honoratus Fasitellus: primÃ¹m Gallica signa Boetis, infractus victricia sensit Iberus.
Intremuere Asiae Reges, ia cuÃ­tque subacta Punica terribili tellus concussa duello.
Which are to be vnderstoode of that selfe same timeÂ· yet then say, could not the consummation of the world be, because
yeares from the Creation of the world, were not yet expired, but now the influence and effects of this present great Coniunctio~ enduring and continuing, as haue sayd, how litle to speake of, shall remaine wanting, to make vp the complete number of
yeares, which account is originally grounded vpon the auncient famous prophecy of Elias, concerning the worlds continuance, foretelling that the same should stand
Christ: which togither make in all the final number of numbers
yeares doe now remaine, of which also, some euen of those that are yet behind, shall be abridged in respect of our infinite sinnes, excÃ©eding wickednes, as it followeth in the same prophecy.
Yea our Sauiour Christ him selfe hath promised in his Gospel written by S. Mathew, the
chapt. that he wil detract somewhat of ye appointed time, saying: Except those daies should be shortned, there should no flesh be saued, but for the elects sake, they shall be shortned.
So that all circumstances being weyed, and all Astrological likehoods togither with prophetical predictions considered, what doubt is there, but we may, and ought to perswade our selues, that the foundation of the world is in a manner worne out, and also this goodly frame ready to fall vpon our shoulders? for if so be there yet remained another great Coniunction of Saturne and Iupiter like to the first, then shoulde there be required a Remanet of almost eight hundred yeares moe, which being added to the yeare of this great Coniunction, would amount to the number of sixe thousand and almoste foure hundred yeares: which manifestly oppugneth the prophecie of Elias aboue rehearsed, and Plato, before
Almighty God, through his infinite power, and vnspeakeable wisedom, in sixe dayes created heauen and earth, the sea, and al thinges therein contained, but the seuenth day he rested, and hallowed the same: wherein some haue reposed a high misterie, imagining, and perswading them selues, that by the sacred ministerie of his holie worde in this present life, within the compasse of
yeares, he will also gather togither his Church, wherwith in the seuenth he wil celebrate and kÃ©epe holy his eternall and euerlasting Sabaoth.
To which purpose they affirme, that the prophecie of Elias, was as it were allegorically borrowed from this number of the sixe dayes Creation, applying to euery daye,
yeares, alledging to that effect, out of the nynetie Psalme, for a thousand yeares in thy sight, are but as yesterday, citing withal that place of Saint Peter, in the third chapter of his second epistle, Dearely beloued, be not ignorant of this one thing, howe that one day is with the Lorde as a thousand yeares, and a thousand yeares as one day.
But how soundly these testimonies be applied to the enforcement of my conclusion, it is for learneder men to determine, my selfe dare not be ouer bold with Textes of scripture, which are so reuerently, and religiously to be handled, and therfore take it best, to stand rather vpon the probabilitie of Astrologicall predictions, and namely, vpon that olde, and common prophecie, touching the yeare
which is now so rife in euery mans mouth, and was so resolutely defended in a publique disputation in the last Commencement, by one, sufficient to maintaine his assertion.
That yeare hath many hundred yeares agone bene specially foretold, and much spoken of amongest Astrologers, who haue, as it were, vnanimi consensu, prognosticated, that either a maruelous feareful and horrible alteration of Empyres, Kingdoms, Seigniories, and States, togither with other wonderfull, and very extraordinary Accidents, as, extreme hunger, and pestilence, desperate treasons, and commotions, shall then fall out, to the miserable affliction, and oppression of huge multitudes: or else, that an vtter, and finall ouerthrowe, and destruction of the whole world shall ensue.
Which prophecie for so much as it is reputed of so great conseque~ce, and withall so nearely toucheth the scope of the present Treatise, will here set downe, as it is deliuered by Leouitius, in Latine verses, made, as most suppose, by Regiomontanus, but translated out of a former style, farre more au~cient, as were also the Dutch verses of Stoeflerinus importing the same Contents.
Post mille expletos partu Virginis annos, Et post quingentos rursus ab orbe datos: Octogesimus octauus mirabilis Annus Ingruet, is secum tristia fata feret.
Si non hoc anno totus malus occidet orbis, Si non in nihilum terra, fretÃºmque ruet: Cuncta tamen mundi sursum ibunt atque retrorsum Imperia, luctus vndique grandis erit.
Which Latine verses, after the maner of our rude mÃ©eter, not long since at aduenture englished, for a friend of myne, but make more account of so solemne a prophecie, than to disgrace it here with my poore translation.
You see what therein serueth to my purpose, that either a finall dissolution, or a wonderfull horrible alteration of the world, is then to be expected.
might alledge many other arguments, and authorities, implying the same conclusion, but auoide to be ouer tedious.
And yet am violently brought to a further consideration of the premisses, by such extraordinary, and as a man would say, presignificatiue Accidents, as these following: When were there euer sÃ©ene so many dreadfull Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone? When so many straung, and wonderfull copulations of planets? when so prodigious Comets, not without their tragicall operations? When such terrible Examples of fierie Meteors, coruscations, traiections, impressions, and inflammations in the Aier, as haue bene already obserued in our Age, and will more fearefully appeare within fewe yeares? When was the Earth so violently terribly shaken with an Earthquake, as it was the sixt of Aprill,
not onely in Ingland, and Scotland, but also in other Countries, and Nations further off? which Earthquake, (notwithstanding your pleasant Entrance into that Philosophicall Discourse, deliuered thereof by you ex tempore in company of honest gentlemen, gentlewomen asse~bled togither to make merry) sÃ©emeth yet vnto me a matter of no smal consequence, wherevnto your selfe also sÃ©eme to incline in the earnester part of that Discourse.
Were not such signes and tokens foretold by our Sauiour Christ? hath he not forewarned vs, that they should appeare shew them selues, as it were in their terrible likenes? a litle before, or in his very comming? doth not withall the contempt of good learning, the co~tempt of good maners, ye contempt of good lawes, the conte~pt of good Magistrats, the contempt of all good gouernment, nay, doth not the contempt of good religion, good pietie, good charitie, al goodnes, which since these latter daies neuer so vniuersally raigned, as now it doth? doe not these general abuses sÃ©eme to argue import as much? whe~ was ye world so quite deuoid of care? whe~ so secure, so recklesse, so bent against all discipline, and order? when so vainly wicked or so wickedly vaine? when was innocencie more ridiculous, faithfulnesse more contemptible, vertue more abiected, holines more prophaned, loue more hated, duty more neglected, honour more dishonoured, honestye more despised, good life more wounded to death, than now a daies? Finally, when such vnnatural partes, such monstrous corruptions of bodye mind, such vile absurd indignities, such inordinate, barbarous procÃ©edings, without any respect to law, or conscience, so vniuersally put in practise? when euer yt like general lustinesse, iollitie, with such desperate wilfulnesse, and not in one or two more highly minded, or hawtily set than their fellowes, but euen commonly in the whole world to speake of? when euer so iust occasion of complaint with the Poet? Omne in praecipiti vitium stetit.
What is now the Conclusion? Truely, that the second comming of the sonne of man draweth nigh, which shall be as were the dayes of Noah, for as in the dayes which were before the floud, they were eating, and drinking, marrying, and giuing in marriage, euen till the day that Noah entred into the Arke, and perceiued nothing, till the floud came, and ouerwhelmed them all, so shal also the comming of the sonne of man be.
May we not nowe sensibly perceiue, that these dayes of ours, and the dayes immediatly following, are ye very daies here expressed: yea, euen those dayes which Christ him selfe did so certainely, and more than prophetically foreshewe vnto his Disciples, preaching vnto them of the destruction of the Temple, the ende of the world, and the latter dayes? Why then doe we still dwell in securitie, and deceiue our selues with vaine conceits, building vp a mountaine of miseries, in+steade of the right felicitie? If we knowe our Lordes will, and doe it not we shall worthily be beaten with many stripes.
Wherefore let vs now at the last, spÃ©edily and carefully call vpon our mercifull God, lest he consume vs in the heate of his heauy wrath, and indignation: let vs humbly sue for grace, and hartily craue pardon and fauour at his hands, lest suddaine destruction ouerwhelme vs: let vs with penitent, and obedient harts fall downe before the throne of his celestiall maiestie, asking remission of our manifold sinnes, and villanies, and with a contrite affection, earnestly and vnfainedly embrace the gladsum tidings of his holy Gospel, that through his infinite goodnes, and excÃ©eding mercy, we may be safely protected, and wholy deliuered from all these horrible euils both of body and soule.
For sÃ©e what comfortable and swÃ©ete words the Lord of Hostes hath vttered with his owne mouth: If ye walke in my Ordinances, and kÃ©epe my commaundements, and doe them, wil send you raine in due season, and the land shall yÃ©eld hir encrease, and the trÃ©es of the fielde shall giue their fruite and your threshing shal reach vnto the vintage, and the vintage shall reach vnto the sowing time, ye shal eate your bread in plenteousnes, and dwel in your land safely, and wil send peace in the land, and ye shall slÃ©epe, and none shal make you afraid, and wil rid euil beastes out of the land, and there shal no sword goe throughout your land, and ye shal chase your enimies, and they shall fall before you vpon the sword and fiue of you shal chase an hundred, and an hundred shal put ten thousand to flight, and your enimies shall fall before you vpon the sword: for will haue respect vnto you, and make you increase, multiply you, and set vp my couenant with you, and ye shall eate olde store, and carry out the olde, because of the new, and wil make my dwelling place among you, and my soule shall not loath you: wil walke amongst you, and will be your God, and ye shall be my people, and so foorth.
These are the goodly and blessed promises, which the Lord of Heauen Earth wil assuredly and plentifully performe vnto those; that doe faithfully feare, and truly worship him, in that integritie of holines righteousnes, that him selfe requireth.
For no doubt, he is a most merciful God, a most louing father, ful of compassion, full of pacience, long suffering, ful of goodnes pitie.
And yet as he is excedingly merciful to the repentant sinner, so is he also iust terrible to the wilful obstinate reprobate.
For thus on the other side hath the Lord of Lords from the throne of his omnipotent Maiestie thundered: but if ye walke contrary vnto me, and wil not harken vnto me, wil also walke contrary vnto you: wil bring vpon you fearfulnes, consumption, and the burning ague, to consume your eyes, and gender sorrow of hart, and ye shal sowe your seede in vaine, for your enimies shal eate it, and wil set my face against you, and ye shal fall before your enimies: they that hate you, shall raigne ouer you, and ye shal flye when no man followeth you, and will breake the pride of your power, and will make your heauen as yron, and your earth as brasse, and your labour shall be spent in vaine, for your land shall not giue her encrease, neither shall the trÃ©es of the landes giue their fruites: will also sende in wild beastes amongest you, which shall robbe you of your children, and destroy your cattell, and make you fewe in number, and make your high wayes to be desolate.
And if ye may not be reformed by these thinges, will punish you yet seuen times for your sinnes, and will send a sworde amongest you, that shall auenge my couenant, and when ye are gathered togither within your cities, will send the pestilence among you, and ye shall be deliuered into the handes of the enimie.
And when haue broken the staffe of your bread, ten wiues shall bake your bread in one ouen, and they shall deliuer you your breade againe by waight, ye shall eate, and not be satisfied.
And if you will not yet for all this harken vnto, but walke against me, will walke contrarye vnto you also, and will chastise you seuen times more for your sinnes: and ye shall eate the flesh of your Sonnes, and the fleshe of your Daughters shall ye deuoure: wil destroy your high places, and cut away your images, and cast your carkasses vpon the bodies of your idols, and my soule shall abhorre you: and will make your cities desolate, and bring your sanctuarie vnto naught, and will not smell the sauour of your swÃ©ete odours: wil bring your land vnto a wildernesse, and your enimies which dwell therein, shall wonder at it.
Nowe, Lord, can any be so vngraciously stiffe necked, and hard harted, as not to be terrified and astonished with the horrour of such maledictions? then, alas, let him that hath an eare, heare what the Creator speaketh vnto the Creature, the Lorde of Lordes, to his rebellious subiect, Almighty God to man, to clay, to dust, and ashes: let euery one remember, what he hath receiued and heard, and hold fast, and repent: he that ouercommeth shall inherite all thinges, and will be his God, and he shall be my sonne, sayth he that sitteth on the Throne.
But the fearefull, and the vnbeleuing, and the abhominable, and murtherers, and whoremongers, and idolaters, and sorcerers, and all liars, shall haue their part in the lake that burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second Death.
Let vs therefore repent with Niniuie, least we be consumed with Sodome, and Gomorrha: let vs doe his commaundements, that we may be blessed, that our power may be in the trÃ©e of life, and that we may enter in, through the gates into the citie, and take the water of life frÃ©ely.
Babylon is made a dwelling place of diuels, a cage of vncleane birdes, spirits and goblins shall walke in hir pallaces, fearefull wilde beastes shall lurke there: scritchowles, and ostriges shall walke in hir houses, Apes and Satyres shall daunce in hir beautifull buildings, wilde Cats shall cry therein, and Dragons shall there abide, no voice of men shall be heard in hir, no sou~d of a bell, or a mill shall be heard, no light of a candle shall be sÃ©ene, but perpetuall solitude, desolation, and sorrow shal remaine and dwel there for euermore.
But, we will faithfully praise the name of our Lord Iesus, and in pacience possesse our soules, that when suddaine destruction shal come vpon the careles world, we may lift vp our heades, and behold our redemption at hand.
We will no more looke for life, but where it dwelleth, in the flesh of Christ alone there it resteth, all promise and hope of life is in him, he hath alone the words of life, he is alone the bread of life, the water of life, the autor of life, the word of life, the trÃ©e of life, the onely life, he that belÃ©eueth in him, hath euerlasting life.
We will cry no more vpon Angels: we will looke no more vnto our owne workes: we will trust no more in our owne prayers: we will no more call for the helpe of creatures, they are all subiect vnto vanitie: there is no life, but in Christ aboue: the Elders, the Angels, the Beastes, all Creatures they giue this honour vnto Christ: saluation is of him, that sitteth vpon the Throne, and of the Lambe, and altogither they cry, Amen.
You will maruell, Brother, to sÃ©e me thus vehemently, zealously affected in a priuate Discourse, but truly the incomparable greatnesse, and importance of the Argument, to him that hath entered into any reasonable consideration of so vniuersall future calamities, as dayly threaten vs, must nÃ©edes sÃ©eme to require much more, than haue here sayd, or can possibly say.
The last notable thing, that haue to obserue this yeare,
is, that there shall not appeare vnto vs in our Horizon, any Eclipse, either of the Sunne, or of the Moone.
Marry, forasmuch as the influence, and working of that Eclipse of the Sunne, which happened the last yeare,
beginneth to take place and effect but in this present yeare,
haue thought it not inconuenient, to prosecute these matters somewhat further, and to deliuer my simple Iudgement touching that Eclipse, presuming herein of your pacience, as in the premisses.
Of the Eclipse of the Sunne, which happened the last yeare,
day of Iune, immediatly after fiue of the clocke in the morning, the bodie of the Moone at hir chaung, being directly put betweene the Sunne and the Earth, or betwÃ©ene our sight, and the Sunne, and thereby depriuing vs of the full light of his beames, there appeared within our Horizon at Cambridge, (as you remember) small Eclipse of the Sunne, the Sunne and Moone being at that very instant conioyned in the seuenth DegrÃ©e, and
minutes of Catabibazon, which Eclipse albeit it were of smal continuance, the Sunne being bodily eclipsed or darkened by the Moone, but vnto thrÃ©e fingers, or points, and seuen minutes, hath notwithstanding the proper influence and peculiar effectes: for as Messahalah a cunning and perfect Astrologer witnesseth, whose bookes (as sayde) haue bene muche estÃ©emed of mightye Princes, and as Experience hir selfe teacheth, There neuer happeneth anye Eclipse of the Sunne, which doth not presignifie and foreshew some great Accident to come to passe, and Ptolomey him selfe the Prince of Astrologers affirmeth, that the fatall conuersions, ouerthrowes, and destructions of kingdomes, may Astrologically be foresÃ©ene, and prognosticated by the Defects and Eclipses of the Sunne and Moone.
Whereby Thales Milesius, as Plinie credibly reporteth, did certainly foretell, sundry chaunges, and alterations of states, and kingdomes, to happen in Asia, which afterward came effectually to passe, euen according to his Astrologicall prediction: the like is auouched by diuerse other, of some other well sÃ©ene the same way.
Whereupon Eclipses haue bene the more specially regarded, and obserued of the best Astrologers, as is very well exemplified by Stadius: but will returne to the present Eclipse, from whence haue a litle digressed.
It is firste to be noted, that the Sunne was eclipsed in Cancer, which is the naturall and essentiall house of the Moone, wherein she reioyceth most, and wherein also the moste beneuolent and fauourable planet Iupiter, called commonly, Fortuna maior, doth ascend, bÃ©eing therein chiefly eleuated, and exalted: a signe of the partition of the watrie Trigone, feminine, nocturnall, northerly, moueable, of direct ascension, whom Capricorne doth obey by reason of his superioritie, vnsauery of taste and effect, beyng naturally colde and moist, and of the flegmaticke complexion, gouernour and ruler of the breast, the mouth of the stomacke, the lunges, euen almoste to Diaphragma, or the Midriffe.
Nowe the nature and properties of the signe being knowne, considering that it is a colde and watrie signe, it betokeneth, according to the Iudicials of Astrologie, that greate aboundaunce of rayne is like to ensue, with many perillous ouerflowinges by rage of waters: whereby a great number shall be shrewdly hindered, and endammaged, it will also cause much rawe, inconstant, and distemperate weather, euill for all kinde of cattle, but especially for shÃ©epe: it portendeth the destruction of much fishe, and water foules: great enuie, strife, debate, contention, and sedition with many priuie conspiracies, vnlawfull fraies, violent oppressions, robberies, and murders, yea and much martiall prouision, and preparation for warre, beside sundrie losses, and grieuous perils vnto those, that get their liuing by toyle and labour on the seas, or other waters, which shall come to passe, by meanes of tempestuous, and immoderate weather, wherewith many shippes shalbe ouerthrowne, many mariners, and watermen drowned, many townes and cities desolate, nigh vnto the sea.
Moreouer there shall followe a great death, and ouerthrow amongst the baser, and poorer sort of people, according to that iudgement of Proclus.
Cum acciderit Eclipsis Solis in Cancro, obscurae turbae, ignobilisque plebeculae interitus sequitur, diuturnae bellorum seditiones, aquatilium, marinorumque, aliorum in aequore degentium magna pernicies.
Which saing of Proclus, the infortunate constellation and constitution of the other planets do sÃ©eme to verifie: for Saturne was retrocedent in a feminine and nocturnal signe, to wit, in Pisces, which is a signe of the same complexion and qualitie that Cancer is of, being also flegmaticke, cold, moiste, and of the nature of water: Mars, Venus, Mercury, and Luna, two of them in a drie and colde signe: the other two in a colde and moist signe, and also in a moyst mansion, will likewise increase the colde watrie operations of this Eclipse, and for their part, helpe forwarde the effects thereof.
And as for Iupiter, he too was much abased and weakened by his Retrogradation in Aquario, a moist signe.
Item Mars being in Tauro, and in opposition to his owne house, is become more sturdie, and infortunate: and being lord of the
house, he noteth that Lordes and Nobles wil much afflict and oppresse their poore tenants by enhauncing their rents, putting them to huge fines, without regard of co~mon reason, equitie, or pietie: so that the poore farmers shalbe scarcely able to liue, and maintaine their necessarie charge.
He signifieth futhermore the vtter destruction, and ouerthrowing of those, which shal rebelliously set themselues against their rulers and magistrates: for he is in opposition to the same his owne house, himselfe remaining in angulo Quartae Domus, vnde emittit sursum, ascendunt eius calores malae naturae ad omnes alios planetas, as Haly saith) and there seated in Tauro the night house of VenusÂ· which importeth much close whoredome, and secrete vngodlinesse amongst many vncleane wicked persons, that haue shaken of the awe, which the feare of God should brÃ©ede in them, and onely haue respect to the impious pollicie, vttered in a common prouerbe, Si non castÃ¨, tamen cautÃ¨.
Which pollicie too will fayle them in the end, and lay their corruption open to the generall vew of the worlde, and shamefull reproch of themselues, so vniuersally true it is, that the Poet writeth: Quicquid sub terra est, in apricum proferet aetas.
might here rehearse sundrie examples of diuerse Eclipses of the Sunne in Cancer, thereby declare, both what destructions, and deaths, also, what other straunge and rufull accidentes haue ensued, but amongst the rest for shortnesse sake will only report two, or thrÃ©e of the most notable, with the seuerall operations and effects thereof: that euery man of any reasonable conceite, and capacitie, may thereby gather a sensible reason cause of fatall conuersions, changes, and alterations by conference of the antecedent causes, and skilfully with discretion and iudgement apply the same to a farther consequence of times and matters to come: for as Stadius in the preface to his Ephemerides excellently noteth: Dum causas praeteritorum interpretamur, eadem quoque Methodo futurorum docemus, nam futura praeteritis non specie, non genere differunt, sed tempore tantum, quod eadem vt accidens comitatur.
very wise rule, not onely seruing for these Astrologicall obseruations, but much more to be extended to the right vse of ancient histories, and politique practises, deliuered to posteritie for their imitation, in like necessities, and affaires.
But, to containe vs now within our bounds, in the yeare
daye of Iune, in the euening, as is credibly recorded, there appeared an Eclipse of the Sunne in Cancer, the
degrÃ©e: at which time, Charles the king of Fraunce being valiantly set vpo~ in battaile by the Inglish men Burgundians, was expelled his owne realme: warre was hotely maintayned betwÃ©ene the Danes, the Slesuicians: the Bishop of Breame prouoking the Hollanders to battaile, was grieuously wounded of them, and taken prisoner: a terrible plague, and most vehement pestilence and mortalitie of men ensued, continuing fierce, and hote a long time: afterwardes, certaine Princes of Germanie, entring Bohemia with a great armie diuided into thrÃ©e partes, were forcibly repelled and driuen backe of the Hussites, whereby the bounds of Bohemia were enlarged, and spread abroade, towardes Misnia, and Noricum: finally, all the fruites of the earth, as corne, graine, vinetrÃ©es, and such like, perished through vnseasonable pinching colde, and extremitie of weather.
the ninth day of Iulie in the morning, there likewise appeared an Eclipse of the Sunne in the
degrÃ©e of Cancer, the influence, effects wherof continued two yeares: when the Turkes martially assayling and inuading Pannonia, called otherwise Hungaria, and Syria, a countrie lying in the east partes of Germanie, a portion whereof bordereth on Hungarie, (sauing which part ye whole country besides is altogither mou~tainish) forcibly carried away many prisoners, captiues, with ouer sensible proofe of their might furie.
Mathias Hunniades, surnamed Coruinus, a moste fortunate prince, and as happie a warrier, who fiue yÃ©eres before was crowned king of Hungarie, by Frederick than Emperour, denou~ced proclaimed warre against the Bohemians, being requested, and perswaded thereunto by the Pope, at that time by force of armes, tooke fro~ them Morauia, Silesia, and Lusatia.
The same Mathias co~tinued as fierce warre with Casimire the king of Polonia, couragiously inuaded the Turkes, often discomfiting and vanquishing them: gatte away Vienna from the Emperour, subdued, and conquered diuerse other nations, and territories adioyning, in so much yt at his death, he deserued this noble Epitaph of Antony Thaebaldeus: Coruini breuis haec Vrna est: quem magna fatentur Facta fuisse Deum, fata fuissÃ¨ hominem.
The Prince of the Tartarians at the same time, assaulted and spoyled Russia, vpon whiche countrie Tartaria boundeth on the weast.
The King of Denmarke was suttelly entrapped and taken by the craftie wiles, and cunning fetches of Sweden, There ensued a sharpe battaile betwÃ©ene the French, and Burgundian, Anno
the force and influence of the Eclipse still continuing, many princes, and mightie potentates died: and amongst the reste, George the king of Bohemia, whom Ladislaus, sonne to the king of Pollonia succÃ©eded.
To conclude, Henry the sixte King of Ingland, was within the reach of this Eclipse, taken by king Edward the fourth, in the Bishops palace at London, and by him committed to the tower, where afterwards he was murdered: as more fully appeareth by our owne Inglish Chronicles.
there hapned an Eclipse of the Sunne in the seuenth degrÃ©e of Cancer, that is iuste in the very selfe same degrÃ©e, wherein the Sunne was darkened this last yeare
After which Eclipse there arose hote warre in Picardie, wherby both the French Burgundians receiued mutuall harmes and dammages diuers wayes, which are reported to haue bene very great and grieuous.
At the same time, the souldiers of king Ferdinand, brother to the Emperour Charles, being conducted by their Captaines to resist the force of their enimies in Hungarie, were, as you know, trecherously betrayed into the handes of the Turkes by one Catzianerus: of whome they were almost all most cruelly slaine, their chief Captaines taken captiue, and carried away to Constantinople the Turkes chiefest citie, where they liued in miserable seruitude and bondage.
At the same time the Geldrenses seditiously rebelled against their Soueraigne.
At the same time, the most fruitefull, bewtifull, and noble Ilands Sicilia and Calabria, were wofully destroyed with fire, which did straungly breake out of the sealand bÃ©eing dried vp.
At the same time their was heard at Rome, a most fearefull, and horrible thundering in the aire, bÃ©eing also the more extraordinarie for the very time of the yeare.
At the same time, an auncient tower of Helderberg, being suddainly blasted with lightning, did cause a sore ruine, much mischiefe and great miserie to that citie.
At the same time, in high Germanie, their hapned an excÃ©eding great inundation, the force and rage whereof, was passing wonderful, and maruelous straunge.
And after the same Eclipse (which we in Ingland, ought chiefly to remember) twoo notable seditions and insurrections did shrewdly trouble, and disturbe vs hÃ©ere in Ingland: which fell out in the
yeare of the raigne of the most mightie and puissant Prince king Henry the eight.
Whereof the firste was raysed principally for religion amongst the commons of Lincolneshire, who had gathered togither nigh
persons, to serue their turnes in the atchieuing of that rebellious enterprize.
The seconde beganne farther of, in Yorkeshire, which northeren commotion was also attempted for matter of religion, the people there flocked togither, amounting to the number of fortie thousand.
Against those of the first insurrection, the King sent out the Duke of Suffolke, with a strong and princely power, which when the rebelles did vnderstand, they straight waies brake vp there armie, and suddainly departed.
Against those of the seconde insurrection, whiche was so farre the greater, his Maiestie sent the Dukes of Northfolke, and Southfolke both, with a farre stronger power, and mightier host of soldiers: vpon whose comming the battaile was appointed to be fought betwÃ©ene them on Simon and Iudes day, but the same night it rayned so extrÃ©emely, that the twoo armies coulde by no meanes mÃ©ete according to that appointment.
Wherupon the rebels (as lightly they are woont first, or last) were glad to craue pardon the second time, shewing themselues very desirous to depart, with due submission to their most noble Prince: so that both these seditions were finally pacified, and dispatched with the death of a fewe Archerebelles, and Captaine commotioners, whiche were shortly after executed for example sake, according to the haynousnesse of their disloyall, and desperate attemptes.
The same Eclipse might peraduenture be accompanied with some other semblable Euents: but these are the chiefest, that can presently call to minde, and are sufficient, suppose, to inferre my Conclusion, what hÃ©ede is to be taken of like Eclipses, and namely this of late.
Whereunto if we shall nowe considerately apply the examples before alledged may we not generally conceiue, what sequele of troubles and euils, is like to be prognosticated by the same? And yet to speake indifferently according to the rules of Arte, persuade my selfe, that the misfortunes threatned thereby, shall neither be fully so hainous, nor of so long continuance, as were those of the former Eclipses.
My reason is, bicause the quantitie of the Eclipse hauing bene but very little small, (not one quarter of the Sunne bÃ©eing darkned) the quantitie of the influence and effects is like to be proportionable.
For so Messahalah iudgeth in his booke de Rebus Eclipsium, the
In Eclipsi Solis semper significatur magnum aliquod Accidens, sed tamen secundÃ¹m quantitatem ipsius Eclipsis.
Wherefore the quantitie of this late Eclipse bÃ©eing so small, presume, the operations, and sequeles thereof shall be both the lesse in quantitie, and the shorter in continuance.
Nowe, as concerning the Regions, Prouinces, territories, and cities which shall chiefly be afflicted and oppressed with the euils ensuing, (whiche euery man will be readie to demaund) it is sufficie~tly knowne, which are principally vnder the dominion, and regiment of the signe Cancer: as Numidia, Africe, Bithinia, Phrygia, Colchis, Carthago, Regnum Franciae, Regnum Scotiae, Regnum Granatae, Comitatus Burgundiae, Prussia, Hollandia, Selandia, Constantinopolis, Thumissa, Venetiae, Mediolanum, Genua, Luca, Pisa, Lubecum, Treueris, Magdeburgum, Gorlicium, Berna, Ciuitas S. Andreae, Yorchia, siue Eboracum, as they are confusedly heaped togither by our chiefest Astrologers, respecting rather matter, than forme.
Of whiche very countries, and cities, those persons too shall especially fÃ©ele the violence of this Eclipse, whiche had Cancer placed in their Horoscope.
And this in effect is all, that haue presently to say, touching the influence, and sequele of the foresayde late EclipseÂ· For, as for those two instaunces, which you in your chamber, not many moneths since, obiter, and as it were, disputandi causa obiected agaynst me, reasoning then familiarly of the obseruation, and hÃ©ede that was to be taken of Eclipses: the one of Agathocles, the famous captaine, and tiranne of Syracusae, the other of L. Sulpitius Gallus a noble Romane: whereof Agathocles, as remember, in his wars against the Penians, when so euer anie Eclipse was to happen the day before their battaile least his souldiers should take any preiudiciall or superstitious conceite thereat, vsed, as you then alledged, to discourse vnto his armie the whole reason thereof: shewing them, that what soeuer shoulde chaunce there, was to followe by course of nature, appertained nothing to their Militarie affaires: Sulpitius Gallus vnderstanding likewise on a time, that an Eclipse was at hande, assembled his souldiers togither, and warned them thereof afore hand, expounding vnto them all the reason, and naturall causes of Eclipses, least they should ignorantly mistake them, for heauie, and vnluckie tokens: As for these two instances, saie, muste nÃ©edes graunt, they were good martiall pollicies, and wise Stratagemes for the present, to abandon such feare, as their souldiers might haply otherwise haue conceyued, by such shews of some infortunate chaunce, to befall them, but as according to Aristotels saying in his Politiques, Non est tuta Regula hominum voluntas: so thinke, these, and such lyke Militate deuises, are not of force, to proue, or disproue any other Conclusion, but this, that in the time of necessitie, or extremitie, especially in warre, it is wisedome, to make the beste of euery such Accident, and to interprete it in such wise, as may sÃ©eme moste behouefull for the incouragement of those, whom it concerneth, to be kept in harte, and to be deliuered of all by feare, that might any way daunt, or astonish their minds.
Which no doubte was Aeneas his politique co~sideration, where Virgil writeth of him: Spem vultu simulat, premit altum corde dolorem.
In which cases, not so much the very truth and consequence of the matter is commonly regarded, as what is most expedient, and auaileable, to serue present turnes.
At an other time remember, you vrged vpon me the like historie out of the fourth booke of Q. Curtius, de Rebus gestis Alexandri.
Where it appeareth, how Alexanders souldiers were at the firste terrified, and astonished, with a terrible Eclipse of the Moone, and how againe afterward recomforted, and satisfied, by a cunning and suttle interpretation of certaine learned Egyptian Astrologers, there present in the campe.
The place is very notable, and therefore haue thought it worth the recyting.
Prima ferÃ¨ vigilia luna deficiens, primÃ¹m nitorem sideris sui condidit, deinde sanguinis colore suffuso, lumen omne foedauit: sollicitisque sub ipsum tanti discriminis casum, ingens relligio, ex ea formido quaedam incussa est: Dijs inuitis, in vltimas terras trahi se querebantur: iam nec flumina posse adiri, nec sidera pristinum praestare fulgorem, vastas terras, deserta omnia occurrere: in vnius hominis iactationem, tot millium sanguinem impendi: fastidio esse patriam: abdicari Philippum patrem: coelum vanis cogitationibus petere.
Then followeth Alexanders remedie, and meanes of pacification, more politique for the effect, than true for the cause.
am pro seditione Rex erat, cum ad omina interitus, Duces, Principesque militum frequentes adesse praetorio iubet, Aegyptiosque vates, quos coeli ac siderum peritissimos esse credebat, quid sentirent, expromere iubet.
At illi, qui fatis scirent temporum orbes implere destinatas vices, Lunamque deficere, cum aut terram subiret, aut sole priuaretur, Rationem quidem ipsis perceptam non edocent vulgus, but what Reason then? CaeterÃ¹m affirmant Solem Graecorum, Lunam esse Persarum, quotiesque illa deficiat, ruinam, stragemque illis gentibus portendi: veteraque exempla percensent Persidis Regum, quos aduersis Dijs pugnasse, Lunae ostendisset Defectio.
Whereupon Q. Curtius interlaceth this politique iudgement: Nulla res efficaciÃ¹s multitudinem regit quÃ m Superstitio, alioquin impotens, saeua, mutabilis, vbi vana religione capta est, meliÃ¹s vatibus quÃ¡m Ducibus suis paret.
For the effect of that forged interpretation, or rather, of that counterfaite Stratageme, was this: Igitur edita in vulgus Aegyptiorum Responsa, rursus ad spem, fiduciam erexere torpentes.
So easie a matter it is, by any colourable deuise, or pretence of reason, to content the vnquiet mindes, and asswage the reging furie of the multitude.
In whiche case, many both Martial and Mercurial experiments haue bene practized, that are not to enforce any rule of Art, other than this, what way a politique man is to take in time of like extremitie.
As for that efficacie, and sequele of Eclipses, that here speake of, found out by induction of Examples, and obseruation of cunning Astrologers, it is not to be iudged vpon by any such Stratagematicall co~ceit either vttered in word, or practized in dÃ©ede, at the point of necessitie: but to be credited so farre, as the iudgement of the learned in this facultie, and the foresayde Exemplifications may giue it credite.
Artifici in sua arte credendum: especially if that Artifex be so expertus, as he ought to be, as here make Account he is, considering what alreadie hath bene alledged, and may father be iustified.
For mine owne part, as hope the beste, so feare the worst, enclyning in some sorte to the olde rule, addiscentem oportet credere.
What soeuer befalleth other places, trust Ingland is still to continue in Gods fauour, who from day to day, and from yeare to yeare, mightily preserue our gracious Queene, as hitherto ha hath done: who graunt hir moste excellent Maiestie, a long and prosperous raigne ouer vs, that wÃ©e may still enioye this happie continuaunce of peace, wealth, health, and other our speciall felicities, whereas the sworde, penurie, and so many plagues, haue ioyned their forces, in a manner against all other nations.
Who for his excÃ©eding mercie sake, vouchsafe vs his singular accustomed fauour more and more, and continually blesse hir soueraigne Highnesse more and more.
doubt not, but euery true Inglish harte will say, Amen.
haue now deliuered what thought conuenient in this kind: vnlesse haply you will furthermore enioyne me, to set downe my Astrologicall iudgement particularly seuerally of the foure quarters of this yeare
after the ordinary manner of our common Almanack makers: which although it be lesse nÃ©edefull, being already performed by them, yet to take away all matter of suspicion, which other wise you might perhaps in some part conceiue of my insufficiencie this way, and withall to discharge a pÃ©ece of my promise in the former discourse, haue briefly noted so much, as would thinke necessary for common instructions, to serue either publique, or priuat turnes, and namely Oeconomical prouision, if this Treatise were to come into more hands.
THe Spring time ensuing, is, in my opinion, like to be very moyst, very windie, and somewhat cold.
Summer, suppose, will be rather moist than dry, with some haile, thunder, and lightning, especially in Iuly, and September.
Haruest will be diuers, and inconstant, moyst, windy, cloudy, temperate, and dry.
The Winter season is moste like to be vnseasonable, tedious, very long, not without great store of haile, raine, snow, many boisterous windes, and very much colde, harde, sharpe, and tempestuous weather.
The whole yeare, to speake more vniuersally, is like to proue but a bad yeare for al maner of cattel, but especially and principally for shÃ©epe.
Pease Beanes, suppose, wil be plentifull, good cheape: but wheat, by my coniectures, wil be scarce, very deare.
Barlie shall be indifferent, but yet of the two, rather deare than cheape.
We are like to haue good store of Honie, sufficient plenty of Oyle.
Butter ChÃ©ese, shal be somewhat deare: we are not to looke for any store, or aboundance of fruite: a dearth of victuals is much to be feared: grieuous losses by shipwracke: sundry dammages by fire: many shamefull whoredoms, thefts, robberies, spoiles, oppressions, treacheries, and mutinies greatly to be dreaded: perillous factions, seditions, tumults, insurrections, vprores, togither with hot preparance for warre to be loked for, especially in ye Northeast cuntries.
Many infirmities, diseases, shall generally raigne both amongest men, wome~, children, procÃ©eding of vnnaturall moistnes, distemperate heat, as by ye Euent wil more sensibly appeare.
The death of some mighty, renowmed Magistrate by all Astrological Coniectures is to ensue: finally a sore mortalitie is very like to inuade many places, as well somewhat neare hand, as farther off: which God of his euerlasting goodnes, mercy, turne from his Elect, continuing our happy state and quietnes in Ingland, to his gracious pleasure.
Hauing thus much presumed of your pacie~ce, co~trary to my maner in such priuat writings, wil yet aduenture, to trouble you a litle farther, with ye view of a certain Phisical Astrological table of Phlebotomie: which, (vpon occasion) haue lately drawne, already co~municated wt a friend or two, studious this way desirous thereof.
will not say, but some error may peradue~ture scape me therin, as in ye rest: if you happen to light vpon any such am to craue pardon, as in ye rest.
The only preamble, here thinke nÃ©edeful, is ye notable Astrological, Phisical iudgement giue~ out by Hermes Trismegistus him self, in ye very ende of his IÃ¤tromathematica, ad Amonem Aegyptium, thus translated into Latine by Stadius, in the Prolegomena to his Ephemerides.
Multu~ refert in quae hora primus morbi insultus deprehe~detur, obseruare, an eo te~pore benefici in ortu sint, aut mediu~ coeli occupent, plus nÃ¡mque sic co~stituti, collapsis aliÃ³qui viribus: opis subministrabunt, {quam} praestantissimus possit Medicus: scrutari igitur die~, hora~ decubitus exactÃ¨ oportebit, mundi positu~ examinare: nihil enim homini superuenit, quod ex coelesti consensu, sympathia non oriatur, originem ducat.
Which famous authenticall Maxime of Hermes, togither with the long approued verse, borrowed from Hesiode: Ipsa Dies, hodie Mater, cras ipsa Nouerca, may generally suffice for the iustifying of that difference, distinction of houres, dayes, and times, which either here is, or els where may Astrologically and Phisically be maintained.
And so with my dutifull Commendacions, hartily commit you to the protection of God: being loth to be ouertedious in officious wordes, or sentences of curtesie, howsoeuer other whiles may chaunce to ouershoote my selfe in matter of Discourse.
COMPENDIOVS Table of Phlebotomie, or bloudletting, setting downe by diuision the generall and speciall considerations thereunto belonging.
AS in other things, so in Phlebotomy, or letting of bloud, the Cause is first skillfully circumspectly to be considered, as that it be to purge the bodye of some vnnaturall, naughty, and superfluous humor, whose substance is either simple, or mixt: simple, when it doth of it selfe, without the admixtion of any other, degenerate, as bloud doth, when it putrifieth in the veines, the pores being stopped: mixt, when it is mingled with some that is already corrupted, as in the Dropsie, where the bloud is mixt with water, then the Cause being thus allowed vpon, certainly knowen for nÃ©edefull and good to the pacient, (for otherwise letting of bloud is very daungerous, and openeth a way to many grieuous infirmities, and withall here would generally be noted, that it is not co~uenient either for a very leane weake man, or for a very fat, grosse man to be let bloud) there remaine to be considered: How it sta~deth with ye Pacient. inwardly
In the complexion is to be considered, whether he be
Concerning the time of the yeare, he is to be aduised, what partes thereof are good, as the Spring: from the middest whereof to the beginning of summer is simply the best time for this purpose: howbeit some thinke Autumne reasonable good, as no doubt it is, in comparison either of summer or winter: being otherwise in it selfe, to be reckned rather for bad, than good.
bad very bad, as Summer and Winter, for their extremitie of heate cold.
Concerning the time of the moneth, these generall Cautions are to be obserued, that he be not let bloud in any member, with any chirurgical instrument, eitherÂ· The Moone being in Tauro, Geminis, Leone, Virgine or Capricorno: or the last halfe of Libra, first of Scorpio.
The Sinne, the Moone, or the Lord of the Horoscope, being in the signe, that ruleth that member.
The Moone being in any part of via lactea, or in via combusta, or in domo casus sui, or being vacua, or tarda cursuÂ· or in terminis infortuniorum, or in the duodenarial diuision of the twelue houses, placed either in
The day before, the day it selfe, the daye after the change of the Moone.
howres before, and as many howres after the quarters of the Moone.
day before, and a day after the full of the Moone.
daye before, and a day after the Coniunction, Quartile, or opposition of the Moone with Saturne, or Mars.
daye before the Coniunction of the Moone with Mercury, or Venus, or the head of the Dragon, or taile of the Dragon infortunate: beside other infortunate dayes in euery moneth, seuerally noted in euery Almanack: and expressely set downe in certaine olde Latine verses to be seene in many auncient Calenders: which kind of verses for the matter commonly are currant enough.
and then the conuenientest time of the moneth, for the
Howbeit, some specially commend Cancer, Aequarius, and Pisces, for letting of bloud: but Pisces can not be so good, being a common or bicorporall signe. also the best, and most laudable Aspects for this purpose, or these, according to our soundest writers in this kind.
the coniunction of the Moone with Iupiter, or Venus, are simply and principally best: so that Venus be not combust. the trine or sextile of the Moone with Iupiter, Sol, Venus, and Mercury, are good, but especially with Iupiter, or Mercury.
the quartile or opposition of the Moone with Iupiter or Venus, doth well.
the trine or sextile of the Moone with Mars, are reasonable good, or indifferent.
the time of the moneth for Youth: from the chaunge to the first quarter.
Howbeit, no child would be let bloud before fourtÃ©ene yeares of age: nor old man after seuentie, vnlesse his strength be the greater, and somewhat more than ordinarie at those yeares.
The time of the day must be either Morning: after the rising of the Sunne: when a man is yet fasting: which is simply the best, excepting the houres of Saturne and Mars: and choosing specially the houres of Iupiter, and Venus, whose nature is most temperate.
After none: after reasonable good, or rather perfect digestion, and expulsion of superfluities.
And withall, regard must be had of the aier yt it be not either too hot, or too cold, or clowdie, but calme, cleare, and temperate: the winde being then either Northerly, or else, Westerly: for the South wind is no friend to Phlebotomie.
Notwithstanding the premises, if this bloud letting be for the Phrenesie, the Pestilence, the Squynancie, the Pleurisie, the Apoplexie, for a continuing headach, procÃ©eding of choler or bloud, or for any hotte burning feuer, or other extreame paine, a man in such a case may not tarie a chosen time, regularly set downe by the Astronomer, or Phisitian, because haply, the pacient might miscarrie in the meane season, but incontinently with all conuenient spÃ©ede, he is to sÃ©eke his remedie, this way: vnlesse either him selfe be very weake, or like to sounde, or the Moone be in the same signe that ruleth that verie parte of his bodie.
Marrie, in the foresayed case of extreamitie, bloud is not to be let in so great a quantitie, as otherwise it would, if a chose time might conueniently be exspected.
As before bloud letting these circumstances of complexion, age, and times, are to be considered, so after bloud letting, like consideration is to be had of our meates, and exercise.
For meates we must take none, but sutch as are of an easie, and light digestion.
For exercise, we are to abstaine from all, vntill the fourth day, exclusiue, not only those, that be vehement, as, riding.
Which both antecedent, and consequent limitations, being duely orderly obserued, doubt not, but may effectually conclude with that auncient commendation of Phlebotomie, giuen out in two common verses.
Exhilarat tristes: iratos placat: amantes Ne sint amentes, Phlebotomia facit.
And thus much, or rather thus litle of Phlebotomie: hoping you will fauourably accept of this Astrological and Phisicke table, togeather with the other rude papers: vntill better oportunitie, and greater leasure, accompanied with more reading, shall afforde some pÃ©ece of worke otherwise laboured, and more schollerly handled, than on such a sodaine this coulde be.
Rome, they say, was not builded in a day, nor any worke of price huddled vp in hast: euerie thing must haue a reasonable time, and it is impossible for a beginner, or nouice in any facultie, to attaine vnto that perfection, which long experience, and much meditation, haue hardly bred in men of farre riper yeres, greater studie.
The best is, know vnto who~ write: and truste at my retourne, shall finde you (as haue alwaies) rather a gentle reformer, than a sharpe controller.
You know vse not to dote vpon mine owne errours, but as in all things else, so in this pamflet, am ready, to correct, or amend any thing that shall be found amisse, being glad to holde the auncient rule, Errare possum, haereticus esse nolo, which pray God, may alwaies follow, as well in the conclusions of this science, as of any other.
But truly, brother, feare me, haue now bene too vnreasonable tedious vnto you, and therefore wil here once againe take my leaue, and bid you hartily farewell: wishing you as my selfe.

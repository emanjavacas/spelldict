GOd, vnto whome all mens hartis be opened, and the wyll of manne speakethe, is my wytnes, that to the desire of knowlege, whervnto haue hither to ben euer of my nature disposed haue ioyned a constant intent to profyte therby to my natural countrey: Whervnto acordyng to the sentence of Tully, we be most specially bou~den.
Wherfore after that had applyed the more parte of my lyfe in perusynge diligently euery auncient warke, that mought come by eyther greke or latine, conteyninge any parte of philosophie necessary to the institution of mans lyfe in vertue, haue endeuored my selfe to set forth such part of my studie as thought mought be profitable to them, whiche shulde happen to rede or here it.
But diuers men rather scornyng my benefite than receyuing it thankfully doo shewe them selfes offended (as they say) with my strange termes.
Other finding in my bokis the thing dispreysed whiche they do co~mende in vsynge it.
Lyke a galde horse abidynge no playsters be alwaye gnappynge and kyckynge at suche examples and sentences as they do feele sharpe or do byte them accomptyng to be in me no lyttell presumption, that wylle in notynge other mens vices correct Magnificat, sens other moche wyser men and better lerned than I, doo forbeare to wryte any thynge.
And whiche is warse than all this: Some wyll maliciously diuine or coniecte that wryte to the intent to rebuke some perticuler persone couaytinge to brynge my warkes and afterward me into the indignation of some man in auctorytie.
Thus vnthankfully is my benefyte receyued my good wyll consumed, and all my labours deuoured.
Such is of some menne the nature serpentine, that lappyng swete mylke they conuerte hit forthe with in to poyson, to distroy hym of whose liberalitie they late had receyued it.
How incomparable be these men vnlyke to the most excellent prince our most dere soueraygne lorde? whose most royall persone hartily beseche god to preserue in longe life and honour.
His highnesse benignely receyuynge my boke whiche named the Gouernour, in the redynge therof sone perceyued that intended to augment our Englyshe tongue, wherby men shulde as well expresse more abundantly the thynge that they conceyued in theyr hartis (wherfore lan+guage was ordeyned) hauynge wor+des apte for the pourpose: as also interprete out of greke, latyn or any other tonge into Englysshe, as sufficiently as out of any one of the said tongues into an other.
His grace also perceyued that through out the boke there was no terme new made by me of a latine or frenche worde, but it is there declared so playnly by one mene or other to a diligent reder that no sente~ce is therby made derke or harde to be vnderstande.
Ne the sharpe and quycke sentences, or the rounde and playne examples set out in the versis of Claudiane the poete in the seconde boke or in the chapiters of Affablitie, Beneuolence, Beneficence and of the diuersitie of flaterers and in dyuers other places in any parte offended his hyghnes: but (as hit was by credible persones reported vnto me) his grace not onely toke hit in the better parte, but also with princely wordes ful of maiestie co~me~ded my dilige~ce simplicite corage in that spared none astate in the rebukynge of vice: which wordes full of very nobilite brought vnto my remembraunce the vertuous Emperour Antonine, called for his wysdom Antonine the philosopher, who on a tyme herynge that there was in the Citie of Rome a playne rude persone whiche alwaye spake in the rebuke of all men, and neuer praised any man: he sent to hym requirynge that he wolde come and speke with hym.
And whan he was come, the Emperour had these wordes vnto hym.
My frende wherin haue euer offended the? The felow therwith soore abasshed answered in this wise.
Sir your hyghnes neuer offended me, that am ware of.
Than art thou (sayd the Emperour) an vncourtoyse subiecte, that thou haste so longe dissembled with me, not tellyng vnto me my faultes.
And after the Emperoure reteyned hym styll gyuyng vnto hym dowble wages commaundynge hym to vse his olde libertie.
And whan dyuers men meruayled therat, he affirmed openly, that princis vices were sooner espied by other men tha~ by them selfes: and that there was moche more difficultie in remembring them of their vice or lack, than in extolling and commendynge their vertues.
So well dyd this mooste noble Emperour consider, that his exaumple mought be more profitable vnto the publyke weale of the citie, than any other thynge in his persone or dignitie.
¶In lyke wise our moste dere soueraygne lorde perfectly knew that no writar ought to be blamed, whiche wryteth neyther for hope of temporall rewarde nor for any priuate disdayne or malyce, but onely of ferue~t zele towarde good occupation and vertu.
Perdie man is not so yet co~for+med in grace, that he can not do syn.
And suppose no prince thynkethe hym selfe to be exempte from mortalitie.
And for as moche as he shall haue mo occasio~s to fall, he ought to haue the moo frendes or the more instruction to warne hym.
And as for my parte eftesones do protest, that in no boke of making haue intended to touche more one manne than an nother.
For there be Gnathos in Spayne as wel as in Grece, Pasquilles in Englande as welle as in Rome, Dionises in Germanye as welle as in Sicile, Harpocrates in France as wel as in Aegipt, Aristippus in Scotlande as well as in Cyrena, Platos be fewe, and them doubte where to fynde.
And if men wyll seke for them in Englande whi+che sette in other places, can nat lette them.
knowe well ynowghe dyuers do delyte to haue theyr garmentes of the facion of other countreyes, and that whiche is mooste playne is vnplesant: but yet it doth happen sometyme that one man beynge in auctorytie or fauour of his prince, beinge sene to weare somme+thing of the old facion: for the stra~ge+nes therof it is taken vp ageine with many good felowes.
Touchynge the title of my boke, considered that wisedome is spoken of, moch more than vsed.
An other affirmeth that they whiche do conducte the affayres of greatte princis or countrayes, be onely wyse men.
Nay saythe the thyrde, he is wysest that leste dothe meddle, and can sytte quietly at home and tourne a crabbe, and looke onely vnto his owne busynesse.
Nowe they whiche be of the fyrste oppinion be alwaye at varyance.
For somme doo chiefly extoll the study of holy scripture (as it is rayson) but while they do wrest it to agree with theyr willes, ambition, or vayne glory, of the mooste noble and deuoute lernynge, they doo endeuor them to make hit seruile and full of contention.
Some do preferre the studie of the lawes of this realme, callynge it the onely studye of the publyke weale.
But a great noumbre of persones, whiche haue consumed in sute more thanne the value of that, that they used for, in theyr angre do cal it a co~mune detriment.
All thoughe vndoubtedly the verye selfe lawe trewely practised passeth the lawes of all other countrayes.
In thynkynge on these sondrye opynyons, happened for my recreacyon to reede in the booke of Laertius the lyfe of Plato, and beholdynge the aunswere that he made to kynge Dyonyse, at the fyrste syghte it semed to me to be very dissolute and lackyng the mo+destie that belo~ged to a philosopher: but whan had better examined it, therein appered that whiche is best worthy to be called wysedome.
Wherfore to exercyse my wytre, and to auoyde Idelnes, toke my penne and assayde Howe in expressyng my conceyte mought profyte to them, whiche without disdayne or enuye wolde often tymes reade it.
If any man wyll thinke the boke to be very longe, let hym consyder, that knowlege of wysedome can not be shortly declared.
All be hit of them whiche be well wyllinge it is soone lerned, in good faythe sooner thanne Primero or Gleeke: Suche is the straunge propretie of that excellent counnynge, that it is sooner lerned, than taught, and better by a mannes rayson than by an instructour.
Finally if the reders of my warkis, by the noble example of our mooste dere soueraygne lorde do iustly and louyngely interprete my labours, durynge the residue of my lyfe wyll nowe and than sette forthe suche frutes of my study profitable (as trust) vnto this my countray.
And le+uynge malycious reders with their incurable fury, wyll say vnto god the wordes of the Catholike Churche in the booke of Sapience: To knowe the good lorde is perfecte Iustice And to knowe thy Iustyce and vertue is the very roote of Immortalite: And therin is the knowlege that is very wysedome.
(But moreouer). xix. xxxi. fleshly. xxi. xviij. that hit sygnifieth. xxij. xliiij. to the point lxvij. xi. cautherize. lxviij. xxi. cautherization. lxxviij. xvij.
Wherefore sens. xvij. putte out (sens) lxxxxi. xxiij. be the seruauntes.
VVho is this ma~ whom perceyue commynge hitherwarde? It semeth to be Plato.
What meaneth it that he is in this wise aparailid? His gar+mentes be very short and more simple tha~ he was accustomed to were.
Well, though there were some debate betwene vs in Sicile, yet wyll salute him and desire him to shew to me the state of all his affaires.
For in wyse men resteth no malice all though diuersitie in opinions or forme of lyuinge causeth sometyme contention betwene them.
But yet thou hast sayde truer tha~ wene thou arte ware of.
Why, knowe the to be Plato, though thou be in this sin+gle apparaile.
But thou saydest that was wel founden: And in dede thou saydest true after the co~mune opinion.
for sens thou departiddest from Sicile haue ben twise in the poynt to haue died and also twise solde for a bondeman or slaue.
Wherfore thon mayst with good rayson say, that am well founden, that haue bene so often in perile to be loste.
For commenly men do calle hym lost, which despayreth of his lyfe or of a free man is made a slaue.
But whither that opinion be true or no, we shall speke more therof hereafter.
do not a litle meruaile of this that thou tellist me.
For whan went from kinge Dionise, he mought not suffer, that thou moughtist be one houre from him.
Moreouer he regarded nothynge that was spoken, except it were by thy sentence approued.
In the mornynge as sone as he was out of his bedde Plato was sent for.
Vneth Dion and Aristomenes coulde gette of hym one houre in the daye that thou moughtist teache them and other towardely gentilmen such part of Philosophie as they desyred to lerne.
Finally for the incomparable fauour that the kynge bare to the, thou were had in the courte almoste in as moche reuerence as the kinges owne person.
And whan thou passiddest by, noble men other of the kinges household wold rise quickely as a storme had falle~ in their neckes, ducke to the with theyr heddis vncouered: yet diuers in theyr mindes grutched at thy fortune, thinkinge that the great pleasure that the kinge had in communinge with the withdrewe hym from heringe of other men, of whome there was a great noumbre, which had some commune some priuate causis to treate of with hym, if they mought by thine absence haue founde oportunitie.
Thou sayest trouth Aristippus that perceiue more clerely now, than did before those thinges hapned vnto me.
¶Sone after that thou haddist optained licence of the king to go vnto Athenes he becam wonderful stourdie, in so moche as no man mought blame any thing wherin he delited: nor prayse any thinge, whiche was contrary to that that he vsed.
And that sobre and gentyll maner in heringe sondry opinions raisoned before hym whereto of a custome he was wo~t to prouoke the me, was laide aparte and supposinge that by heringe of sondry philosophers dispute and raison, he him selfe had attayned to a more perfect knowledge tha~ any other that spake vnto hym, began to haue all other men in contempte.
And as it were Iupyter who (as Homere saythe) with a wynke made all heuen to shake he wold with a terrible countenaunce so visage them whome he knewe wold speake theyr opinions freely, that they shulde dreede to saye any thinge which they knewe shulde be contrary vnto his appetite.
Not withstandynge on a tyme he willed me to declare in his presence the maiestie of a kynge, and howe moch he excelled and was aboue the astate of any other person: which request gladly herde thinkinge to haue had good oportunitie to warne hym of his blyndenes and foly.
Therfore began to commende the perfect ymage or fygure of god, which was manifest in the astate of a king, who ruled hym selfe and his people for the vniuersal weale of them al.
And whan had described his auctorite and preeminence by the excellency of his vertues: prouinge that nothyng moughte be amended, but by that whiche surmounted or was better than it whiche was to be corrected as vice by vertu, falshode by truthe, wrong by Iustice, foly by wisedom, ignoraunce by lernynge and such other lyke.
Afterward studiousely dyd sette out a Tyraunte in his propre colours, who attendeth to his owne priuate commoditie.
And interruptynge my wordes sayd vnto me: This is a tale of old fooles that can not be otherwyse occupied.
And aunswered agayne, that those wordes of his sauored of Tyranny.
meruaile Plato that thou spakest, so vnavisedly: do meane, sens thou knewest wel inough kinge Dionise nature and disposicion that thou perceuinge hym to be meued, woldest so sodaynly imbrayde hym of his wordes so despitefully.
Well as for that we shal raison ther of hereafter.
Finally was wel aui+sed what wolde speke: but nowe wyl tell furth my tale, what hapned afterward to me.
¶Syr, the kynge beinge inflamed with fury furthwith wolde haue slaine me.
But beinge intreated importunately by Dion and Aristomenes he withdrewe his sentence not withstandynge to the intente that he wolde be auenged, he gaue me to Polidis who was thanne Ambassadour sente to hym from the Lacedemonians.
Who hadde me with hym to Aegina, and there solde me.
Nowe a littell before there was an ordinaunce made in that Countray, that if any man of Athenes came in to that Ile, he shulde immediately lose his hedde: whiche ordinaunce was made by Charmander thanne beinge capitayne of that countray who espieng me and knowing who was, caused me to be apprehended and brought vnto the place of Iudgement requiringe that on me his sayd ordinaunce mought be put in execution.
Whervnto made no defence, but takynge myne aduenture paciently, and contemning deth as it became me abode my Iugement.
At the last one, eyther in despite or of purpose to saue therby my lyfe, spekinge openly and with a loude voyce, sayde to Charmander and the Iudges: The ordinaunce if it be well perceyued, is made again men of Athenes: but Plato (that is here) is a philosopher.
Which wordes, as it hapned were well taken lawghed at of all them that were present.
All be hit for the hostilitie that was than betwene them Athenes they wolde not lette me freely departe, but decreed that shulde efte soones be solde.
There hapned to be at that time Aniceris, which dwelleth at Cyrenas a man well lerned, who payed for me. xx. li. and furthwith deliuering to me his seruant, whom thou beholdist here, hath sent me as thou seest home to my contray: The garmentes that weare, he that boughte me of Polidis toke fro~ one of his slaues and gaue them vnto me, whan he hadde taken from me myne apparaile that brought out of Sicile: whiche as thou knowest was right honest and competent.
Not withstandinge neither the crueltie of king Dionise, nor the malicious decree of the Aeginites mought remoue my courage from vertu and truthe no more than the twise sellynge of me, nor this vile habite of a slaue or bondman may chau~ge mine astate or condicion.
¶But nowe Aristippus wyll answere the to that wherein thou semest to blame me of imprudence or litenes: sayinge, thou meruay leste that wolde speake so vnauisedly sens knewe the nature of kynge Dionise and his disposition.
Reme~brist thou not, that my comminge in to Sicile was to beholde the wonderfull mountaines which do sende out of the toppes of them great flames of fyre and smoke, to inserche out the naturall causis therof? And that all though the kynge sent often tymes for me yet wolde not come vnto hym, for as moche as thrugh all Grece he was named a Tiraunt.
At the laste he sente vnto me Dion which is a man as thou knowest of honour and grauitie almost incomparable: who said vnto me that the kynge was incredibly meued with desyre to se me, for the greatte fame (as he affirmed) of wisedome and knowledge all thoughe my selfe knowe no suche thyng to be in me.
And moreouer the same Dion shewed me, that he supposed moch profite shuld happen to the royalme of Sicile by our metynge and communication the kinge presently beholdynge and herynge in me that, wherof he hathe so great expectation: that is to saye (as moughte vse Dions worde) vertue and wisedome.
In dede herde not onely Dion, but also dyuers other reporte euery thynge as thou haste spoken.
Than thou knowest, that the kynge feruently desired to se me.
PLA. Supposist thou Aristippus that the reporte of wisedome and vertue is good in a Tyrantes opinion? ARI.
Ye as longe as he thinketh that nothinge that is spoken or done repugnith agaynst his affections.
He accompteth it but a vanitie iudginge as sicke me~, nothing to be good, that agreeth not with the sent of his appetite.
PLA. Nowe in good faith though thou thy selfe hast a delicate mouthe and thy taste distempred, yet can the thanke: for nowe thou sayest truely.
But it semeth to the, that wha~ Dionise se~t for me, he tha~ thought that wisedome and vertue were good that hauing the~ (as it was reported) was a good man: and therfore he desyred to se me.
And men do desyre to se a thinge eyther for the beautie therof whiche causeth them to loue it, or for the strangenes therof, wherby they be meued to wonder at it or for commoditie that they before haue receyued by hit.
But excepte be deceyued by false myrrors, or lyke to chaungeable louers which do mislyke the beautie, wherof they haue dayly fruition perchaunce contempne that in my selfe whiche wold prayse in an other, am neytherin beautie nor personage to be compared to an infinite noumbre of yonge men which be in Greece, and also in this royalme of Sicile.
Besides that, am now aboue the age of fourtie yeres, and haue also trauailed in to dyuers contraies to seke for wisedome wherby the forme strength of my body is not a littell appayred.
Moreouer thankes be to god, suppose there is neyther stature nor forme in my personage so ferre out of iuste measure or fascion where at any man can fynd occasion to wonder or meruayle.
And as for any commoditie that kinge Dionise hath receiued of me before my comminge vnto him can not perceyue what it shuld be sens neuer wrate vnto hym nor neuer before was in his co~pani: what thinkest thou was than the cause that he desired to se me? AR.
What els, but to the inte~r that hauinge the in his presence, he mought in demaundinge of the, here that declared by thy mouth: wherfore thou were called a wise man if thou diddest expresse the same in thy demenure countenance which helpeth moche (as mought saye) to the ratifienge of good opinion.
What sayest thou? Doeth demeanure and countenaunce ratifie the opinion of wisedome? ARI.
For accordynge to the profession or qualitie wherin men haue opinion that wisedome doeth rest so ought to be the forme of lyuinge countenaunce, and gesture: which ioyned all to gether maketh one hole and perfecte harmonie whiche sendeth in to the hartes of the beholders and herers a voluptie or feruent dilectation.
can the thanke Aristippus thou haste nowe declared to haue ben (as was) the disciple of Socrates.
And if thou woldest extend voluptie no further (whiche thou so moche praysest) than thou haste done now there shuld neuer be con+tention betwene vs, but folowinge directly the doctrine and steppes of our maister Socrates, not onely we two shulde agree in our opinions and forme of liuinge whiche shulde make that harmony, wherof thou spekest.
For all men that knowe vs bothe by the vnitie of oure doctrine shulde be brought to insue one conformitie of lyuinge, or at the leste couayte to folowe it wherin shuld be a perfecte harmony.
Where, by the discorde of our two doctrines, men doubtinge which of vs two speketh most truely commendinge the voluptie or perfect dilectation whiche is in knowlege thou preferringe the voluptie of the body sences, they be deuided in to sondry opinions: some extollynge myne admonicions as more pure and separate from the nature of beastes, and therfore approchinge nere vnto diuinitie: other more sensuall and hauinge lasse rayson, do imbrace thy persuasions, as more illecebrouse or dilectable callinge thy doctrine more natural and of lasse arrogance: many there be, whiche do couayte lernynge wisedome but hauynge not theyr myndes sufficiently purged of affectes but eyther by nature, or by yll bringinge vp inclininge alwaye to pleasaunte motions or appetites of the body they admitte them gladly.
But while they studye to folowe bothe oure doctrines: they of all other do make the greattest discorde and vnperfect musike.
For whanne they wold seme to extolle the dilectation in knowlege they auaunce it meruaylously in theyr disputations raisoninges: but in pursuing theyr affectis and wanto~ apetites they destroy their fyrst opinion: And vainly do inforce them to make a concorde betwene that whiche of theyr own nature be most repugnant.
Whiche discorde dissolueth that harmony, wherof thou spakest: for men beholdinge in one person suche instabilitie, they semblably do wander in sondry opinions nowe praysinge one and vsinge an other, as occasion hapneth.
But here wyll leue to dispute any more in this matter lest moughte happen to refricate the late variaunce betwene the and me and nowe wyll retourne agayne where was.
¶I trowe thou saydest that according to the profession or qualitie, wherin men haue opinion that wise dome doeth reste, so ought to be the forme of lyuinge, countenaunce and gesture.
For if Lais the harlot in whome thou takest pleasure in fulfyllinge thy carnall appetite, shulde shewe her selfe to the in fluttisshe and vile apparaile, her hed vnkempt her face and handes soiled and imbrued with grece of the potage that she had eaten, and her legges and fete spotted with myar beholdynge the with a stourdy countenaunce: thou shuldest not be moch moued to imbrace and kysse her, all thoughe she spake to the wordes wanton and amorouse, and after the custome of harlots prayse the with rebukes, and rebuke the with prayses.
In likewyfe if Diogenes who (as thou knowest) contempneth all thynge saue onely pouertie, wolde stonde in the market place with his berde cleane shauen, and his heare trussed vp in a caule of golde and ha+uinge on his fingers ringes with diamandes and rubies and on his legges fyne hosen well garded, and shoen of the trimmest fascion, And bycause perchance it is wynter, and therfore the wether is colde hauing a pan with hote coles standinge at his elbowe: If he wolde rebuke the people of to moch curiositie and delicate lyuinge and prayse wylfull pouertie and apparaile, that onely seruen for necessitie, also wolde exhorte them to contemne or despise al ryches and honour and to imbrace paynfulnes: Thinkest not thou that they wold laugh him to scorne and accompt hym for a dissarde or with to moche studie fallen in to a frensie? ARI.
Yes be my trouth, for it were a maruayllous foly.
For the fresshe apparaile and riches that he sheweth openly declareth to all men that he therin deliteth taketh plesure.
And that wherin a ma~ doth delite, in deliting therin he prayseth it: than is it not a great folishnes to praise disprayse as it were in one instante? That is to saye in vse to co~mende a thynge openly and in wordes to disprayse it expressly.
And it shulde seme to the beholders, that he exhorteth me~ to contemne riches that he mought be riche onely.
And that he persuadeth them to sustayne cold other paines, that he mought take his ease syt by the fire whiles other men laboured.
Wherfore if they regarded littell his counsaile they were not to be blamed.
Yes, his counsayle perchaunce were to be consydered, whether it were expedient or no: but surely his persone and discretion were to be littell estemed.
Nowe Aristippus, thou thinkest that kynge Dionise desyred to se me, to the inte~t that he mought beholde, if in my countenaunce and forme of lyuinge dyd expresse that thinge wherfore he herde me commended.
And it semeth, that therin the kynge declared hym selfe to be a very wise man, that he trusted more to the act, than to wordes or opinion.
Ye truly he hath a sharp witte, and in that a manne mought wel praise his ymagination.
PLA. Thanne what thinkest thou Aristippus? If shulde haue layde a parte myne owne aparaile, haue bought suche as thou wearest garded and decked with golden buttons supposest thou not that wha~ cam to his presence and that he sawe me, in such wise aparailed, he wold thinke that wold speke of the dilectation that is felte in medlynge with fayre women and pleasant: or in the sondry diuersities of swete sauours tastes of metes that the cooke hathe wel seasoned: and in other like thinges, in whose effectes thou determinest to be perfecte felicitie? Than bicause he hath before herde the dispute as abundauntly therof as any mannes witte mought ymagine, he wold littell esteme my comminge and thinke the reporte, which was made of me, to be false.
But if he wold vouchefaufe to tary, than if disputed of fortitude, temperaunce, and other lyke vertues, and there with exhorted him and other princes, to abstayne and be continente blaminge theyr auarice, lechery, other dissolute maners with theyr curiositie superfluouse apparaile: Supposest thou not that he wolde lawgh at me and in mockage bede me chaunge myne apparaile? ARI.
Nay, paraduenture he wolde commaunde one to fetche for you a furred hoode to saue with your honestie.
For thou woldest that men shulde thinke that he were of great modestie.
But what if before that he herde me speke, he had caused me to sytte with hym at souper and there behelde me feede errantly perusinge all the delicate disshes: and thereto dranke stoutly of euery cuppe that was offred me: and after souper with suche wenches as were presente, deuise wantonly and also playe and dalie, excedynge the termes of honestie, but whan behelde him do the semblable, wolde than commende sobrenesse and dispraise gloteny: co~mende excedingely continence, and dispraise vehemently wanton daliaunce and lechery: howe moche trowest thou wold he than sette by me? ARI.
As moch as of a good foole that shuld make hym mery.
For he wold take al thy wordes but for iapery.
Whan Dion broughte me vntill hym and that he behelde me cladde in apparaile conuenient semely to my profession, neither sea~t nor superfluous neyther most rude, nor yet sumptuous, my countenance therto equiualent, which (be it spoken withoute any boste) with great study and diligence, haue prepared to haue alwaye in suche a temperance that it shall neuer be founden dissolute or lyghte nor yet froward or stourdy thinkest thou that he had than good opinion of me? and thought that the wisedom and vertue was in me, which men had reported? ARI.
Ye vndoubtedly and therfore he reioiced moche at thy commynge.
For any other thinge trowest thou, than bycause was wise and vertuouse, as he iudged by mine apparaile countenance? And that he hoped to here of me some wisedome declared? ARI.
On my faythe Aristippus thou well doest deserue the greatte giftes and benefites that thou haste receyued of kynge Dionise sens thou so diligently hast affirmed hym to be the louer of wisedome.
For in that, that he couayted to here it declared he desyred it, and no man wold desyre that thing that he loueth not.
But yet hereafter it shall appiere contrary: But for this time admitte thy persuasion of king Dionise to be true that he fauored wisedome and vertue, and that he hoped to here it declared better by me than by other.
If nowe he sytting studiously applienge his eares to gyue me good audience, shulde here me commende the plesure that is in sumptuous and pleasaunt housis, in rich apparaile and tapestries, in plentie of goodly and fayre concubines in abundaunce of delicate meates and drinkes and heapynge vp great treasour of money and iewelles: thinkest not thou that spake contrary to his expectation whiche he had of me by the reporte of my lyuinge, confermed by myne apparaile and countenance, as thou late affirmiddest? Thinkest thou that he wolde not haue thoughte that eyther had mocked hym, or flatered hym, if he hath so sharpe a witte and quicke inuencion as thou doest suppose hym to haue, and ther+fore haue caused me to be expelled oute of his palice, as a counterfayte dysarde or spie? Or aunswering me that of suche thinges as commended he had more knowlege and experience than and therfore in vain laboured to declare that to hym, whiche knew moche lasse than he hym selfe dyd? Sayenge that he couayted to here of me, what wisedome was, wherof he had herde so many diuers opinions: And wherin as the reporte was made vnto him, was iustructed sufficiently, wher+fore he wolde requyre me to declare that onely vnto hym which he supposed knewe better than he dyd. ARI.
It is very likely that he wold haue done so.
If thou haddest than ben there Aristippus woldest thou haue cou~sailed me to haue resisted that gentyl princis request, who with suche humanitie, as thou hast herde of, so moche desyred to se me and to here me speke? ARI.
And accordinge as myne apparaile and countenance pretended, so shuld do? ARI. Accordynge.
Not vsurping thy profession in persuadinge to hym thinges that were dilectable, or praysinge the dissolute forme of his lyuinge, not onely contrary to myne apparaile and countenaunce but also whiche my selfe do aborre and haue alway reproued openly.
No that dissimulation were to foule and apparant and shulde haue sette hym (as thou say dest while ere) in great displeasure with the supposinge that thou haddest mocked hym.
PLA. Tha~ woldest thou not, that shuld haue vsed any dissimulatio~: for thou supposest that kynge Dionise wolde haue bene therwith displeased.
It semeth therfore that thou co~cludest that shulde tell hym truthe accordinge to my profession.
Thou knowest well Aristippus that my profession hathe euer bene, That no man is happy, except he be wise and also good that felicitie is in wisedome and goodnes.
And contrarie wise that they whiche be ignoraunt and yll be vnhappy and that ignoraunce and synne is infelicitie and misery.
knowe well thou hast ben in that tale yet continually.
What sayest thou Aristippus is not wisedome knowledge? Or what thynge is it els? ARI.
Why doest thou aske me that question wherof no man maketh any doubt? PLA.
For feared leste thou woldest haue sayde, that the vsinge of thinges dilectable had ben wisedom onely.
For than shuld haue affirmed that a hors which deliteth in etyng a dogge in hunting, a gote in lechery, did it by wisedom: wherby shuld proue my selfe to be folisshe and ignoraunt.
Moreouer am of that opinion, that a wyse man liueth not alway in voluptie or pleasaunt dilectation but that for the more parte is so affectioned.
Also withoute knowlege the troubles impedime~tes wherby dilectatio~ is letted may not be comprehende to be eschewed.
Well than although in the affect of dilectation we two disagre thou preferrynge the dilectations of the flesshe before the dilectations of the soule condemnyng all such affection do vtterli seuer it from wisedome: yet we do agree that knowledge is euer in a wyse man.
But what knowlege meanest thou? The knowledge of a good horse from a bad a hole shepe from a cothed, or suche other lyke? Or els the knowledge howe to buylde a fayre house, or how to sette trees, that in a littell space of time thou maist haue a faire orcharde? ARI.
PLA. Yea and procedeth of a sharp wit but yet it is not that knowledge that maketh hym that hath it, to be a wise man.
What sayest thou by him, that findeth the menes to gather great sommes of money offices, or greatte possessions with littel labour: thinkest thou not him to haue that knowledge which we calle wisedome? ARI.
It approcheth very nigh, but dare nat affirme it to be so, bycause se dayly, that the most parte of those persons happeneth to suche thinges more by fortune than by theyr owne merites or Industry.
On my fayth loue the Aristippus for nowe thou sayest truely.
What they whiche from a poore astate do come to gret rule and auctorite, shal name them all wise men? ARI. Moche lasse thanne the other.
For besides that that fortune hath also there no littel porcion, it moreouer dependeth not on the power, witte, or diligence of him, that commeth to auctoritie, but holly on the wyl of a second person that is to say of him that promoteth him to it.
Wherfore haue he moch witte or none, as he shall like or content the person that maye aduaunce hym, so shall he come to auctoritie.
Wherfore sens it hapneth not onely of his own study, se no cause why to call hym a wise manne.
Thou spekest very wel and raysonably but what supposest thou them to be, which in euery mater, that is meued, canne raison fetely, makyng men that do here them wonder at their conueyance, thoughe it be somtyme ferre from the purpose? be not they wise men? And that thing that they haue, is it not the very knowlege, that maketh wisedom? ARI.
No, but it is a good parte of inuencion, which commeth of witte.
All be it bycause that whiche they do rayson is neuer certayne, it is rather opinion than wisedome, and also that maner of prompte raysonynge hapneth more of nature than study, and therfore it is more commended of vulgare persones or ignoraunte: than of them which be of a ripe and perfect iugement.
PLA. Perchance thou sayst truely: yet may it also be in them that be wise, not as wisedome it selfe, but as a setter furthe of wisedome to hym that hereth like as the painter hathe the very ymage in his mynde, but whanne he wold that other men shuld perceiue it, he on a table with sondry colours paynteth it and setteth it furth: And yet if the paynter do not before he warketh in the payntynge, con+ceiue in his mind the hole proporcion of the image wha~ it is painted, it shal lacke his {per}fectio~.
And although the freshe colours and vernishe maketh it pleasaunt to the eyen of the commune people, and them that be ignorant, yet to good warke men to them that haue beholden manye parfecte peces, and delyted therin, the imperfeccyon of the warke is shortly perceiued: euen so knowlege wherin is wisedome beinge ones truely hadde, if it be wel sette furthe with eloque~ce and raison it shal the better please and profite the herers.
But if he that speketh doo lacke that knowlege howe so euer the beautye of his wordes and rayson shall content the eares of them that be ignorant, yet therof shall come to them but litell profite.
And to them that haue tasted some thinge of that knowlege the errour or lacke shall sone be espied.
But now what supposest thou is the knowlege, which we haue all this while talked of? and that wherin that wisedome is for the which kinge Dionise desyred to se me and to here me speke, and the whiche accordynge to my profession apparaile and countenaunce, and to the expectation that he had of me declared vnto hym? ARI.
wote not Plato, therfore praye the telle me to shorten oure communication.
am content but yet with a condicion that is to saye, whan demaunde of the any question thou shalt speke euen as thou thinkest, without inforcinge any raison to maynteine therwith thine old opinion.
ARI. Therto assent for this tyme, sens there be no mo here but we two, for oure seruauntes be nowe out of heringe.
Thou remembrest, that it is agreed by vs bothe, that neyther the knowynge of good catell from bad or howe to plante well and to make a fayre orchard ne the deuisinge of fayre houses, and buyldinges nor the increasinge of goodes or possessions, or the optayninge of great offices or dignities, or the sharpe witte and quickenes in raisoninge: is that knowlege wherin is wisedome? What sayest thou to other sciences or craftes, whiche are not rehersed? ARI.
For of eueriche of them haue knowen some men to be littell better than naturall fooles and out of the feate whiche they dayly exercised, vneth perceyuinge that whiche we call commune rayson.
Ye, that wars is liuynge bestly and out of all order, whiche is the greattest moste euident token of ignoraunce, whiche is contrarie and ennemie to knowledge.
But nowe Aristippus, for as moche as longe disputation prouoketh tediousenes, me semeth if we broughte in some varietie or chaunge in the order of our communication, it shulde refresshe both our wittes.
What menest thou therby? Take hede that we runne not out of our matter.
No, doubt thou not therof, shall prouide well ynough therfore.
We haue hetherto spoken of knowlege, wherin is Sapience: but what or wherin hit is, we yet perceiue not, but be nowe in sekynge.
What, and if we now vsed the way of a cunnynge paynter, whiche in makynge an ymage of a very fayre woman naked to the intent that he wyll sette out the fygure perfaictly (as mought speke like a warkeman) by prospectiue: that it maye seme to the beholders therof moste liuely therfore the bodi and membres shuld shewe to them as rounde and fulle, as it were imbosed and wrought in tymber, metall, or stone? he makith the grounde of his warke of the depest blacke coloure that he may come by, which the more intentifly that a man doeth behold it the more liueli or quicke shal the fresshly colour of the image apere to the eye the proportion seme more rounde, and in the forme of a body lyuinge.
In semblable wise intendynge to sette oute a parfeict figure of knowlege, if treate fyrst of Ignoraunce and makynge that to be well perceiued suppose it shall not be inconueniente: but the true proportion of knowlege afterwarde, whanne shall go aboute to declare it shall be more apparaunt and easy to be vnderstande and the varietie in our co~munication shall make the matter more pleasant.
In good faith Plato thy deuise liketh me wonderfull well.
Is Ignorance any other thing Aris. than lacke of knowlege? ARI.
PL. Tha~ no+thing is so co~trari to knowlege as ig+norance.
Is a brute beest inferior to ma~kind by any thing so moch as by ignorance? For in bodily strength, long life agilitie swiftnes, ther be diuers bestes which fer do excede him onely by ignorance they be all inferiors vnto him.
A. Thou were wont also to say, that bestes lacked the soule that ma~ hath which is i~mortal.
But thou must reme~bre, that the soule with the body maketh the ma~.
For if the body lacked a soule, though it hadde life, yet were it no man but a beest.
And that the figure makith not a ma~ it aperith by those bestes, which be callid satiri fauni hipoce~tauri diuers other which be founden in Affrike hauing som the visage some the hole figure of mans bodi.
And in the same soule, whiche maketh the man, and without it man is not, nor may be, hathe nothinge lasse in him than ignoraunce, and if a man seme to be ignoraunt, it hapneth neuer a whitte of the soule, but of the grosnes of the body, whiche is bestiall, as of the same matter and substance that brute beastes be of: which will not lette the soule, that is of a diuine substance, to shewe the effectes and disposition of her nature, whiche is onely knowledge: the lacke wherof being caused by the obiect or lette of the bodi, is nothing but ignoraunce.
Lykewise as a thicke great cloude coueringe the sonne wyll not lette hym to sende furthe his beames on the erthe, wherby the erthe lacketh lyght and that lacke is called derkenesse.
Nowe laye aparte all artes sciences, which (as thou knowest wel inough) were founden by mannes Inuention and experience, long after that man was created: and set man in the same astate that he was in before the sayd artes and sciences were inuented: yet were he than a man as he is nowe, And lacketh not any thynge, wherby he is named a a man.
Wherin nowe doth appere the diuersitie bytwene hym and a brute beaste? Tell me nowe as thou thinkest? ARI.
What els but in the same thinge for the whiche beastes be surnamed brute.
Thou sayest truth: but yet leste be deceyuid by the diuersitie of oure two vnderstandynges: pray the tell me in fewe wordes, what by the sayde worde, brute, is signified.
ARI. Mary agreed: take that signifieth grose, insensate lackynge capacitie of knowlege finally it amounreth to as moche as ignoraunt.
By the faythe of my body thou haste made an exposition very compendiouse and elegant.
Than be we both agreed, that ignorance makith the di+uersite betwene a beast a man.
But what Ignorance pray the? Ignorance in building of houses, makyng of cloth, or warking of metall, or {per}aduenture ignorance in gra~mer, or lo+gike, or making or versis or els playeng on the shalmes or the lute? Doth ignorance in any of these cause the di+uersite? AR.
For thou diddest presuppose, that a man were in the same astate, that all men were in or euer any artes or sciences were founden than of that thing that is not it were foly to suppose any ignoraunce.
But yet for an other cause Ignoraunce in any of the sayd artes or sciences doeth not make the diuersitie that we nowe speake of.
For if it shuld so do tha~ who so euer lacked any of the said artes or sciences: it shuld folowe that he were ignoraunt, therfore he were no man but a beaste.
And also bees, silkewormes, and spydars shuld not co~pare with vs onely, but shulde seme also to excede vs in knowlege.
For as moche as without any instructor or teacher, they at the fyrst without losse of any thing can perfectli make waxe hony, silke and copwebbes: whiche no man can do like, nor by none inuention canne attayne to the knowlege, how it ought to be done.
And as for the bee and the spynner, who so euer studiously do beholde their warke he shall se therin suche order that beside the office of nature he shal wo~der at the equalite or iustnes of proportion so exactly obserued that none artificer can amende it.
But now Aristip. sens this is not the Ignoraunce that any of vs both haue mente hytherto praye the what Ignoraunce supposest thou it is, that makith this diuersite? ARI.
suppose hit be this, that a beaste hath not the knowlege of hym selfe and of other, in the diuersite of their kindes.
For my horse knoweth not that he is a horse no more he doeth that he is a beast and a man: neyther the bee at whose industry thou haste so moche wondred, whanne the hiue is broken: he knoweth not whether it be a man or a beaste that taketh his hony combes, putteth hym out of his lodgyng, wheron he hath bestowed so moche labour.
Nor the spainell that is so ialouse ouer his miaster, hath not the knowlege whether his maister be a man or elles a beaste as he is.
Contrary wyse, a manne knoweth that he is a man, and knoweth also euery other beaste in his kynde.
But beware that thou be not deceiued, if after Pythagoras doctrine whan men be deade theyr soules entre in to horsis lyons and swine.
And after many yeres trauaylynge they retourne agayne to be men: Than there mought be in thy horse the soule of kynge Sardanapalus wherby thy horse moughte knowe what thou art and hym selfe to.
Thou aduauncest me highly Plato whan thou supposest me to ryde on a kynge, and on so greatte a king as Sardanapalus was which reigned ouer Assyria and Babylon.
Thou art worthy to haue no worse horse Aristippus, sens by thy profession thou art demed prelate of all voluptie or wanton appetites: vnto whome moche greater princis than Sardanapalus was haue ben knowen to be seruantes.
ARI. Mo peraduenture than of thy sower vnpleasant vertues wolde gladly be folowers.
But nowe that remembre me, thou nedest not to be aferd Aristippus, for thou art neuer the more deceyued.
In good feythe thy horse hathe yet no more knowlege than a very horse hath in dede.
For whan Sardanapalus liued, and was kynge of Assyria he than knewe not hym selfe.
For abandonynge not onely the maiestie of a kyng but also the office of a ma~, he lefte the company of men and sat continually with his concubynes atyred in the forme of a woman spinnynge in the rocke and cared for nothynge, but howe he mought excell all his wenches in wa~tonnes.
Now sens he than beinge in the forme of a man so moch forgat what he was, thinkest thou that there be in hym lasse ignorance now that he is in the fourme of a horse? ARI.
And because thou sayest so Plato haue euen the fondest horse that euer man rode on.
For whan he was yonge, he was so mare wode that no man mought ride him.
And now that he is old, that pitieng him do vse to ride on him some smal iournaies: by my trouth whan we be in the brode highway, if he se. iiii. miles of, a rase of mares he wil in spite of my tethe leue the way go to the~ whan he is not able to ren, nor bridell nor sporre may hold him.
And yet wha~ he co~meth thider sauing onely neyenge kicking he can do nothing.
And ther+for it may wel be (if Pythagoras do trine be true) that the soule of Sardanapal{us} is in sorel my horse.
But if knew it for certain bi god wold haue the fairest mares that ani wher mought be gotte~ for him.
But in dede Arist. the said sente~ce of Pythagoras ought not to be taken as it is writte~ without ani other expositio~ nomore tha~ his mistical cou~sailes cal+led Simbola.
As cut not the fire with a sword Lepe not ouer the balance, Taste nothinge which hath a blacke tayle, and suche other lyke, whiche thou hast often tymes herde of: but there in is a more secrete meanynge approchinge nere vnto rayson.
As in myne opinion by the translation of mans soule, wherof we haue spoken, from a man to a beast, and finally estsones vnto a man agayne: It may be wel vnderstand in this wise.
That men beinge in the state of Innocency haue than the figure of ma~, the soule hauinge the hole preeminence ouer the body.
But after it happen that the appetites and desyres of the body so moch do increase, that they haue the hole possession of the body and that the affections of the soule, that is to saye vertues be suppressed or putte to silence than the lyfe becommeth beastely: than loke in what beastes the sayde appetites be mooste vehemente: he in whome is the semblable appetite, may be sayd hathe his soule in that best inclosed.
As he that is lecherous and wanton, in such a horse as thou spakest of while ere.
cruel man or Tyraunt in to a tigre or lion, a glotton or drunkarde in to a wolfe or a swyne, and so furthe of other.
And if one man happen to be possessed of many vices than is his tra~sformatio~ more dyuers and as mought saye more monstruouse.
Also beinge in that beastly astate, the soule with her affectes beinge hyd and not shewyng her puissance, what any other thynge is more in them thanne ignorance? Which beinge a thing beastly, is as propre to them as beastly appetite.
But if god so willinge after longe trauailing in yll affections, the soule recouereth her myght and vanquisht ignoraunce makynge the body to knowe his misery, than the beastes hyde by littell and littell falleth a way as knowlege increaseth, and finally man resumeth his very figure and proportion lyuinge after the rule of the soule, and so continueth perpetually.
It semeth to me to stand with good rayson: for euer me thought that Pythagoras sentence, whiche was a man of incomparable wisedome had suche a meaninge.
Also it appereth by the sayde sentence that Ignorance maketh a ma~ beastly, that knowlege putteth awaye beastlynes, and restoreth a man to his dignitie.
And it semeth by that, which is rehersed that Ignorance that we calle beastly, is in that, that bestes do not know what thei the~ selfes be nor be+twene them and men what is the di+uersitie.
Also that men knowe the diuersitie betwene them and brute beastes it hapneth of the soule, hauyng preeminence ouer the bodye that is to saye while the soule doeth holde the sences of the body vnder due rule obedience.
For haue affirmed so moche before, that can not replie nowe with myne ho+nestie.
For they kepynge of touche Aristippus can well prayse the.
But howe sayest thou? Haue we not of ignorance spoken for this tyme sufficiently? AR. Yes suppose and we haue nowe passed two myles in oure iournay: therfore retourne where thou leftest to speke of knowledge.
For thou haste layde a good grounde on thy table to set out thyne ymage.
Therfore lette vs assaye to expresse that Image, that is to saye, declare what is that knowlege, wherin lieth very wisedom, which peraduenture kinge Dionise hoped to finde in me whan he first desired to se me.
THou dost remembre Aristippus, that we be agreed, that knowlege is contrary to Ignorance? And suppose also they be so contrarie that they may neuer accorde or in any part be mingled to+gether: but alway where the one is, the other lacketh.
Than whan Ignorance is ones put away clerely knowlege onely remayneth.
Ye so trowe: or els wote not what it is, that abideth excepte wolde calle it nothynge.
And yet nowe am aduised, that same, nothynge is Ignoraunce.
Thou speakest truely and as it besemeth the scoler of Socrates.
Now thou knowest that Ignora~ce is of be+stes which therfore be named brute: that knowlege is only pertaininge to man.
And that the Ignoraunce wherby beastes be most vnlike vnto man, is Ignoraunce of them selfes, in as moche as they knowe not that they be beastes.
Than it foloweth, that the knowlege, whiche maketh the greattest diuersitie betwene man beast and wherby man hath preeminence in dignitie ouer beastes is the knowlege of hym selfe: wherby also he knoweth other.
Ye, supposest thou so? Doeth a man by knowynge hym selfe knowe other also? PLA.
No doubt therof, and that shalt thou se prouid in the order of our co~munication by the same rai+son that shal make him to know him selfe.
But yet lefte thou be deceiued, wyll by the waye demaunde one question of the.
Thou saydest while ere Aristippus, that a beast hath not the knowlege of hym selfe and of other in the diuersitie of theyr kindes, praye the what vnderstodest thou therby? Any other than thou dyddest declare by the exa~ple of the bee and the spaynell? ARI.
None other: Why, thinkest thou Plato that sayd not well? PLA.
Thou camest (as said) nigh to the point, but yet thou hittest it not.
For peraduenture thy supposell may be in some part false, although thou hast not it.
Dost thou not behold, that beastes, whiche be sauage, as they be diuers in kynde, so do they couayt to be together, and wil seuer them selfes from other? And in the acte of generation wyll accompany with none other beast, but suche as is of his owne propre kynde: not+withstanding that there be diuers of the~ one so like an other: that vneth a man can discerne the diuersitie.
As wolfes and mastyfes: foxes and curres, hares and conyes, and many other beastes whiche were tediouse to be rehersed.
And as touchinge the bee, that we spake of, be there not diuers flies lyke vnto him? And for all that he wyll companye with none of them nor yet suffer them (if he be of power to resiste) entre in to his hyue but at the fyrst sighte wyll withstande hym.
Moreouer all the sayd bestes, whan they perceiue a man commyng toward them they wyll not abyde, but flee soner from hym than from any beast.
More+ouer amonge an infinite nombre of people, a dogge wyl know his maister although ther were a thousand men, in personage, fascion, and colour of garme~tes veri like vnto him.
And if thou woldest saye, that the dogge doeth discerne that by sent of smellinge.
Yet wold demaunde of the agayne, howe it hapneth that a dogge taken vp at Olinthum, and brought vnto Athenes whiche be distant.
xl. myles one place from the other, and is a very diffuse way to kepe, and littell trauayled, yet after that the dogge haue ben retained at Athenes by the space of syxe monethes whan he hath ben at libertie he hath retourned agayne home to his maisters house, howe woldest thou answere me Aristippus? ARI.
Howe elles? But euen as thou thy selfe diddest suppose that wolde saye, that the dogge founde the way by sent specially, addynge to peraduenture some parte of his syghte.
But perchaunce or he come to Olinthum his maister hathe forsaken the house that he dwelled in whan he was with hym, and is remoued in to an other house: doest thou not thinke, that the dogge wil go to the house, wher he left his maister, and not to the house where he dwelleth? AR. Yes in good sayth.
And yet percase he shal fynde his maisters steppes in the strete towarde his newe house.
And not+withstandynge as sone as he espieth the other house he passeth forthe, goeth streight to it.
But whan he co+meth in, and fyndeth not his maister there, yet he layeth hym down as he were at home, trusting that his maister wyll shortly come in: doeth he this by sight or by smellinge? ARI.
Thou makest me doubt Plato, whither he doeth it by any of them.
What if it happen, that his master not knowing him to be ther standynge nigh to the windowe talketh loude with his neighbour so that the dogge hereth hym: thinkest thou not that he wyl ryse sodainly with great hast come ioifully vntil his maister? ARI.
PLA. Doth he that by sauour or by syght? ARI.
And whan he cometh to him he streight leapeth vppon hym without any smellynge.
Onely by cause thou wylte not graunte contrarye to thyne assercyon, that a beaste hathe knowledge of hym selfe and other in the diuersitie of theyr kyndes.
But whatte wylte thou saye if it shall appere vnto the that bestes haue yet an other knowlege among them selfes tha~ by their sences? haste not thou sene, whanne men haue preparid them selfes to go on huntyng, and to that intent haue brought forthe theyr leshes, colers, and lyams or elles theyr hayes and pursenettes, that the houndes espienge these thynges haue reioyced and lept about the house as if they knewe that they shulde go on huntynge? Likewyse whan they here the hunter blowe his horne they doo all ryse, and with one voyce doo make a greatte noyse, as if they consented to goo to that solace.
And if they herde one blowe in a shalme or a trumpette they wolde not do so.
¶The coursar whiche is vsed to bataylle as soone as he herethe the trumpettes blowen he snorteth and brayeth, and takyng to him his courage, he tredith hygh, praunceth and with suche bragges declareth him selfe redy to set furth in bataile, supposest thou, that these beastes haue this knowlege onely by the sen+ces, wherof we haue spoken? ARI.
No, hir semethe to me nowe, that they haue an other knowledge than onely by sences, but what hir is or wherof hir procedethe canne not discusse excepte shulde name it naturall influence, diuersely disposed more or lasse, after the grosenesse or capacitie of the body, whervnto it sloweth.
By the faythe of my body, and that definition is not to be dispreised if thou adde thervn+to the sences.
But by this that thou and haue nowe spoken it semeth, that beastes haue knowlege of them selfes and other in the diuersitie of theyr kyndes, contrarie to thy fyrste diuision.
And if it be so, than be they equal to men and without cause we do cal them ignorant or brute.
Abide Aristippus dispayre not thou haste spoken more wiseliar than thou art ware of.
Ye and that shalt thou perceiue if thou wilt here me.
PLA. Lette it not be tediouse vnto the to haue some thinges repeted, which thou hast spoken.
¶Fyrst if thou remembre thy selfe, thou woldest not denie, but that wisedome was knowledge.
After warde thou grauntiddest also, that Ignoraunce was none other thynge but lacke of knowlege, whiche concluded, that Ignoraunce could be no wisedome.
And than dyddest thou raison that the diuersitie betwene man and beast was onely ignorance.
And that Ignoraunce dyddest thou suppose to be the lacke of knowlege of them selfes and other in the diuer+sitie of theyr kyndes.
This was very well gathered of the, in myne opinion.
And the raison that folowed by the example that thou dyddeste putte of thy horse the bee and the spaynell, was not vnfitte to the purpose, if thou woldest haue abyden well by it.
But by our mery digression in to Pythagoras regeneratio~s thou were brought from that argument soner than thou shuldest haue ben: whiche hapned vnto the as it doeth euer to them, whiche lyke vnto the do folowe the concupiscence and pleasaunt affectes of the body.
For lyke as they be vnstable, so the folowers louers of them be euer in constant: as well in their opinions as in their actes.
But if thou being sometyme the herer of Socrates as well as was, haddest folowed directly his doctrine accordyng as he spake it and also practised it by his example of lyuyng and haddest not as a truant pycked out of his argumentes suche matter as thou supposiddest mought only maynteine thy sensuall appetite thou shuldest haue perceyued what thou thy selfe haddest mente, whiche thou doest not nowe it varieth so moche from thy profession.
And peraduenture the knowledge that we nowe seke for, shuld neuer haue comen betwene vs two in question.
But it shulde haue suffised to haue told to the, what sayde to kynge Dionise, and howe he delte with me.
And thou shuldest sone haue iuged if he had according to merites intreted me.
But now Aristippus to thintent thou mayste take some comforte of the sedes of Socrates doctrine which remayne in the, but they wyll not springe in suche wyse as thou mayste see them except do water them with my de+claration.
¶Fyrst remembre that of all that whiche bereth the name of a thynge there be two kyndes, one hath no bodye is euer stedfast and permanent the other hath a bo+dy, but it is euer moueable vncertein, The first, bicause it may be vndersta~de only it is called intelligible.
The second, bicause it may be felt by sensis it is called Sensible.
The way to know the fyrste is called raison, the knowlege therof is namid vnder+sta~ding.
The way to know the. ii. is called Sense or feling the knowlege therof is named Perceiuinge.
More ouer of that which is called Intelligible there is the fyrst the seconde.
In the fyrste is that portion of diuinitie, whiche is in man, wherby he is made to the image and similitude of god.
Of this beastes haue no parte, neyther of the fyrste nor yet of the seconde: of the fyrst suppose thou wylte graunt me, and as for the seconde experience wyl proue it? for dare saye thou neuer hardest of beastes that coude skylle of nombrynge.
And though an ape or other lyke beaste seme in takynge of thinges to obserue an ordre, as it were in nombrynge yet if it be well considered it shall appere that it is by an imagination ingendred of custome, and not by nombrynge.
haue sene a man, whiche was borne blynde, and vsed to be ladde to thre or foure houses in the citie, whiche hath ben a great distance a sondre, at the laste by custome hathe knowen so well where they stode that without any man or dogge leadynge, or any man tellynge hym he hath gone directly vnto them.
Wherat fyrste meruayled with many other, and whan communed with hym, haue per+ceyued that he neuer obserued nombre, but that onely custome had set the distance of the places in his imagination.
For that wherby beastes do discerne one thinge from an other is not vnderstandynge that is to saye though they discerne in quantite the more from the lasse, yet they vnderstand it not, as rounde, quadraunt or triangle or in other lyke fygure: but the simulacre or ymage wherby they pecyue the sayd diuersite is one+ly by custome, formed imprinted in the principal se~se, which is the hart.
And wha~ the thing selfe is remoued out of sight that impression that remaineth is called imagination who co~mittith it forthwith vnto memori, which vndouted is not only in men but also in bestis, for thei discerne the tyme present and that which is passed, but the tyme to com they know not, Memory is onely of the time passed.
And therfore the bestes that thou spakest of doo perceiue the diuersitie of thynges by imagination Memorie, conceiuynge reteyninge in the harte, whiche is the principall sense or fountain of senses, the image of the thynge that is sensible.
And therby the dogge perceyuethe his mayster fetcheth his gloue which he hath ben before taught for to do goeth to the places where he hath sene his maister bene a littell before.
But that he knoweth not whether his maister be a ma~ or a horse Plato or Demosthenes, a philosopher or an oratour, it is euide~t inough.
For although my dogge had abyden ten yeres continually with me, and had herde me euerye daye speake of Demosthenes name hym an oratour and herd the call me euery day Plato, and name me a philosopher: yet if thou woldest deliuer vnto him ani+thing, byd hym it to the oratour he wolde strayt brynge it vnto me, and not to Demosthenes.
Also if wold cast a lofe vnto my spaynell bid him cary it to my horse, suppose he wold forthwith eate it hym+self, lye downe wha~ he hath done without seking for horse though he stode by him is it not so? A. Ye in good faith me thinkith thou saist tru+ly.
And likewise mai be raisoned of al other bestes be thei neuer so wily if their actis be depely considered.
PLA. Thanne thy sayinge is not to be reproued, that a beaste lacked knowledge of hym+selfe and of other.
And that ignorance made the diuersiue betwene man and beaste.
Than thou wylt conclude that man hath knowlege? AR. Ye that must nedes thou knowest well ynough.
And what callest thou that knowledge? thou it is where a manne knowethe hym selfe and other? ARI.
So dydde in dede, but yet good Aristippus suffer me to demaunde of the a fewe questions we shall the sooner fynde out the knowlege that we seke for.
Perdie thou saydest thy selfe, that thy horse knewe not, that thou were a manne, or that he was a horse.
PL. Thou co~siderest also, that it was agreed by vs bothe, that the figure made not the man, but it was the soule with the body that caused the manne to be so named: and that without the soule, not withsta~dyng the figure of man, yet were he no ma~ but a brute beaste.
Than is there somewhat more that makethe the sayde knowlege besydes the fygure whiche is conteyned in the seconde part of that whiche we called Intelligible? ARI.
It is no meruayle, thy be so inuolued in carnal affections, that this clene and pure doctrine canne not entre in to them without gret difficultie, wha~ they be ones in, they can not longe abide thy memorie is so occupied about wanton and beastly fantasy.
But yet wyl ones agayne reherce vnto the that, whiche thou haste so shortly forgotten.
Dyd not saye, that in the fyrste part of that, which is named Intelligible is that portion of diuinitie in man, wherby he is made to the ymage and similitude of god? ARI.
And is that forme printed in any other thynge than in mans soule, whiche is immutable and of one proportion and fygure? All though it lyeth bounden in the body as it were in a prison consideringe thynges diuersely: as the substance and qualities of the body suffreth hym to take light: beinge deceyued by the iudgement of the sences or wittes, estemynge thynges as they be se~sible visible: where that whiche the soule by hym selfe doeth consyder, is intelligible and also inuisible.
But supposest thou Plato, that the ymage and similitude of god is not in the body of ma~ as well as in the soule? PLA. Hast thou so sone forgotten that, whiche haue so often rehersed? That if the body of ma~ were without a soule, he were than but in the nombre of brute beastes, which haue se~ces as wel as he and some more sharp quicker.
And no man that wil affirme that god is wyll presume (as trowe) to saye expressely that the ymage of god is in Satires and other beastes and fysshes whiche haue fourme and shappe lyke vnto manne.
And to speke to the meryly without reproche vnto goddes maiestie, If that whiche is in euery mannes bodye were the ymage of godde, Certes thanne the ymage of godde were not onely diuers, but also horrible monstruouse, and in some part ridiculouse: that is to say, to be laughed at.
For euery man hathe not in visage and personage, one proportion or figure.
Some haue a playne and equall visage, some loke as they laughed other as they wept diuers as they were euer angri, many haue in the quantitie of theyr bodies or membres excesse or lacke.
Wherfore to thynke that all these be lyke vnto god (whiche as he is the creatoure of them all and maye make and do what he lysteth, so it agreeth with all that he incomparably excelleth them all in euery perfection and consequently in beautie) it were of all other the greatest madnesse.
Thou aunswerest me raysonably but nowe pray the declare to me as plainly, howe the ymage of god is in the soule as thou suppo+sest.
Thou wilt not deny, that god is without any body inuisible and immortal, whose forme can not be deprehended with the eyen of mortal me~ nor described by any sen+sible knowlege? ARI.
And the same trowe thou wilt confesse of the soule? ARI.
Also god is in power in all and euery parte of the world: And by his prouidence all thynge is gouerned and moued.
And he him selfe is of none other moued nor gouerned but is the fyrste incomprehensible mouer.
can by no raison denye it except wold deny, that god is that maye not sens that the order of al thing that is visible declareth that there must nedes be one principall cause and beginnynge, which we call god.
And also that order can not be withoute prouidence and one perpetuall gouernance.
PL. Yet thou sayest wel, and as it besemeth Socrates scoler.
But nowe Aristippus, for as moche as god is the fyrst principall cause.
And as he is one in begynnynge so is he euer one in gouernaunce: And therfore hauinge in hym al sufficiency and powar, wilt thou not graunt me, that he is of an absolute and full perfection? ARI.
And is not perfection in that it is perfect good also? ARI.
Ye per aduenture the same perfection is goodnesse sens goodnesse is alwaye complete, profitable, and withoute any lacke.
And goodnesse and euyll the one is contrarie and euer repugnant vnto the other: Howe sayest thou? is it not so? ARI.
But in god can neuer be variance, whiche of his nature is euer one, may neuer suffer diuision.
Than in god nor about god can be none euil: therfore all euyll is ferre from god.
But yet me semeth we haue spoken somwhat lasse of god than we shuld do.
For sens we bothe haue agreed, that he is the fyrste begynnynge and cause: we shuld haue also concluded that all goodnesse pro+ceded of hym and that he was the fountayne and principall goodnesse.
Than thou grauntest, that cuyll is contrarie to god? ARI.
And all thynge that is yl, is contrarie to that thing whiche is good? ARI.
Those thinges that be contra+rie one to an other be they lyke in that, wherin they be co~trarie? AR.
P. Than it semeth that they be vnlyke? A. So it appereth.
That wherin thinges be like or vnlyke one to an nother, do we not calle it an ymage or similitude? AR. Yes vndoubtedly.
Nowe let see Aristippus, Sens thou haste con+fessed that the soule is inuisible and immortalle howe sayest thou? shall it suffise that therin onely he be like vnto god and in all other thynge vn+lyke or contrarye? ARI.
No: for than shulde he be in parte lyke and in parte vnlyke: And than were hit not welle spoken to saye that man was made to the ymage and similitude of god without ioynyng therto distinctly particularly in what thynge he was made to the sayd ymage similitude: As if one wolde saye that in thy sonne were thy {pro}pre image and similitude.
If thou thy selfe dyddest perceyue that he were lyke to the in fauour, proportion of bodye and condicions, thou woldest holde the pleased and saye nothynge.
But if thou beheldeste that in his personage he were lyke the but in some parte of the visage as in the nose, the eyen, or the mouthe he were vnlyke the, Also in liberalitie he folowed the, but in lechery he did degenerate from the: shuldest thou not than be constrayned to demaunde of hym that spake, wherin thy sonne is lyke to the or in what parte of hym thyne ymage shulde appere to be moste? PLA. Nowe on my fayth Aristippus thou speakest very well and wysely.
Lo, see, howe by oure longe co~muning thou art drawen from thy wanton affections and fantasyes whereby the sparkis of wysedome, that thou gatist of Socrates lessons lyke as fyre hydde vnder askes and deed cooles, whan they be remoued is found sindrynge in lytel imbres: so thyn affections beinge withdrawen wysedom doth begyn to glyter and shew whiche if it wold abide kend lynge, not like vnto imbres remoue fle awai with eueri puffe of wi~de, doubte not but for the sharpnes of thy wit, of al Socrates scolers thou be at the last one of the most wisest and excelle~t.
But wil speke therof no more lest thou shuldist sup+pose did to the that wolde not do to ki~g Dionise, mene flater the.
No no, peciue wherabout thou goest: thou woldist with psuasion, wherin knowe thou art meruaylous, withdraw me if thou moughtist fro~ my, pfessed opinio~ but that is now no part of our mater.
P. Yet suppose thou art for thou shalt finde it otherwise, or we be at an ende of our communication: but where left we? Thou didest affirme (as reme~bre) that for as moch as man was made to the image similitude of god he ought to be like vnto god not in part but in all vniuer+sally.
In al suche lykenes as that which is creatid mai be most like vn+to his creatour, without co~parison of equalitie.
For god that is alway one may suffre no pere or lyke in equalitie of substa~ce.
Al though that was euer ment in our raisoning: for neuer supposid, that thou haddist so litell lerning to thinke that god made men equal vnto hym or so ignorant that thou knewest not, what an ymage or similitude is, in respecte of that where vnto it is wrought.
By that whiche we before haue affirmed, that god is the first cause pri~cipal goodnes it arguith that al thi~g which is not the self god is inferior vnto him.
Wherfore the image or similitude of god al though it be an imitatio~ or folowing in liknes of that whervnto it is made resembled yet is it inferior to god: who by the vertue of his vnitie hath euer a preeminence, and souerayntie.
Therfore we wyll stycke no more thervppon, but now wil assay to declare how we may vnderstand, that the similitude of god is imprinted in manne: wherin the knowlege that we bega~ to treate of perchaunce shall appere vnto vs. Wherfore Aristip.
praye the as thou hast done here me patiently, and whan shall demande of the any question, answere me simply without cauillatio~.
But be short than pray for me thinketh hit longe or we come to an ende of our matter.
For as sayd, the littell sparkes of wisedome that appered in the, wyll neuer be brought to be a good fire they be so mengled with askes of affectio~: wherby they be made so inco~stant, that they will not abide the end of my raiso~ wher by percha~ce they mought be caused to kendel and waxe more.
But sens thou hast promysed to here me pati+ently wyl go forth with this matter: and not but that wyll make an ende or we come to the cite.
SEns we haue treted som what of god of mans soule (but not sufficientli for that wold require a moche lengar tyme, also that bothe thou and had our myndes more cleane pourged with prayer and pure sacrifice) Nowe lette vs see as moche as we maye be suffred what it is wherin they most do resemble.
Fyrste all that is in god is perpetualle and immutable, and by none occasyon or for any cause may be appayred, mynysshed, or corrupted.
That whiche is in the soule, parte is perpetualle and immutable parte is not perpetualle, and is also mutable.
For that the soule is Immortalle and inuisible, that is perpetualle and maye neuer be chaunged.
But vnderstandynge whiche dydde putte to: the knowledge of that, whiche was Intelligible, and named hit a portion of dyuinitie, is not perpetualle in the soule, as hit is in godde, nor all wayes immutable: but durynge the tyme that hit is conserued by contemplacy on of the diuine maiestie, hit is perfecte and makethe mannes soule lyke vnto god.
And whanne hit is ioyned vnto corporaile affectes hit is made thanne vnperfecte and the fourme of the soule, is in a parte frome the ryghte symilytude of god.
But if the soule beinge dedycate to vices be ones fallen frome the possession of rayson thanne vnderstandynge is vanysshed awaye and the soule remaynethe with the bodye transfourmed, as we spake of before.
And thanne that Immortalytie, whiche beynge ioyned to vnderstandynge, made the soule lyke vnto god beinge nowe seperate from hit, shall be to the soule confusion and tourmente.
¶The maiestie of god, in beholding wherof the sayd vnderstandyng or knowlege is conserued and kept in perfection is all his goodnes wherof haue spoken and his prouydence, whiche procedethe of the same goodnesse.
In beholdynge the goodnesse of Godde manne dothe perceyue, that thereof procedethe vertue.
In consyderynge his prouydence, he fyndethe that nothynge is made without cause or (as moughte saye) at a venture: but that all thynges be made for a pourpose, profitable, and also necessary and so to the respecte therof al thynges be good.
Doest thou not remembre that thou thy selfe saydest late that hit were not welle spoken to saye that man was made to the image and similitude of god: if he had in him no mo thynges lyke vnto god, but only that he were inui+sible and immortal? and that dyddest thou ratifie with a good and familiar exaumple.
It is not soo longe passed sens spake it but that may well remembre it.
And thou dydst not deni but that the pte Intelligible of man is a diuine substance, wherein is vnderstandynge? ARI.
Than it semeth that in vnderstandynge manne is lyke vnto god.
And the same vnderstandynge is knowledge: but is man lyke to god in any other knowlege trowest thou, than in contemplacyon of the Dyuyne maiestie? ARIST.
say in beholdyng perfectly the prouidence and goodnes of god: dydde not declare to the but euen nowe that therin was goddes maiestie? ARI.
It semeth veryly Plato, that therin is the knowlege, wherin as thou haste affirmed, is a portion of diuinitie.
By that same knowledge also he knoweth that vertue is good bicause it procedeth of goodnes.
AR. Ye. PLA. Doth he not also knowe that euyll is contrary to good? AR. Why not.
Thanne knowethe he that vice is ylle, by cause hit is contrarye to that whiche is good? ARISTIPPVS.
By the same rayson dothe he knowe, that he whiche is vycyouse that is to saye, he whiche is possessed with vice is ylle: and he that is vertuouse is good.
Thanne he that is vycyouse is contrarye and vnlyke vnto hym that is vertuouse.
In anye other thynge but that he is yll? ARISTIPPVS.
And he that is vertuouse is he lyke vnto god, whiche is all for any other thynge but for that he is good? ARI.
Than see howe he that is vertuouse is lyke vnto god.
And that he whiche is possessyd with vice, is contrarye and vnlyke vnto hym.
Nowe in consyderynge the prouydence of godde, whiche also belongethe to vnderstandynge, Order in euerye thinge is perceyued to be whiche order lyke a streyghte lyne issueth oute of prouydence, and passethe directely throughe all thynges that be created.
And therin be degrees, wherin those thynges beinge sette one hathe preemynence ouer a nother in goodnes.
Dyd not we calle that goodnesse whyle ere necessary and profitable? ARISTIPPVS.
Vnto whome supposyst thou, be thynges profytable? ARI. Vnto whom els but to them whiche doo vse them? PLA.
And to them that do vse them most be they mooste profitable? ARI.
But if they falle frome the degrees of the sayde lyne, wherin they were ordeyned and sette by the sayde prouidence: and chaunge theyr order, than those thynges do cesse to be necessarye one to an other bycause they be oute of theyr ryght places, where god had ones sette them for to be necessary.
Also either order is good and disorder ylle, or els contrary.
And that which is good is also pro+fitable: and contrary wise that whi+ch is yll is also vnprofitable.
Than thou wylte graunte me, that order is good and profytable and disorder is ylle and vnprofitable? ARI.
Than what sayfte thou, be not all thynges wherin is ordre or disordre, eyther good and profitable or ylle and vnprofytable in vsynge one an nother? ARISTIPP.
More or lasse as they be moche or lyttell vsed? ARI.
am very gladde Aristippus to see howe seriously and truely thou kepest tacke with me, sens thou dyd dest promise me that thou woldest answere accordynge as thou thoughtist, without leanynge to any particular opinion.
And in that appereth in the a token of more wisedome: thanne is in all the residue of thy profession.
But nowe remembre welle what thou haste spoken: And shewe me if thou thinkest that any other creature hath so moche vse of all thynges that be created as manne hath, reuolue them well in thy mynde or thou speakest consyderinge what commoditie one thynge maye haue by vsynge an other.
And of howe many thynges one thynge maye receyue any commoditie.
Howe sayest thou, hast thou nowe well aduised the? ARI.
Me semeth Plato that onely man hathe the vse of all thinges that be created, and may receyue of eueriche of them a commodite.
Other thinges do vse somtime one an other but not so generally.
Than it semeth also that all thinges were created for hym specially.
For man doeth vse or maye vse all thinge that is but not contrarye: for the horse the ore or the shepe, lykewyse other thynges lyuinge, or growynge can vse manne nor receyue of hym any thynge but for mannes propre commoditie.
PLA. Ergo we be agreed, that Man vseth thinges mooste of all other? ARI.
Than be they to hym eyther beste and mooste profytable, or elles warste and mooste vnprofitable.
Why sayst thou so, sens this is but comune raison, and (except be deceyued) to euerye manne easye? but that the sayde thynges be to manne beste and moste profytable it hapneth of order: that they be warst moste vnprofytable it co~meth of disordre.
More ouer the preeminence that man hath, beinge in the highest degree of the lyne that we spake of, augmenteth also the qualitie that is to say maketh the thynge that he vseth better or wars.
fatte shepe hauynge moche wolle on his backe, for as moche as a man may be fedde with his carcaise, and clothed with his wull, is better tha~ a leane and poore shepe, whose wul being al of with the brembles the wyll onely fede dogges: whiche gnawynge on the boones and bowelles wyll therwith be nourished.
Lykewyse herbes in that be medicinable and holsom, in or restoringe helthe vnto be moche better, than for that they fede catel or beastes: so that for the benefite that euery creature brin vnto man it is the better in his kinde more profitable.
But sens it semeth that for ma~, specially al thinges were created that vnto hym they be eyther best and mooste profitable or els warst and most vnpro+fitable wold now knowe wherin they be vnto man good profitable or yll and vnprofytable.
What meanest thou? Diddest not thou declare it euen no we thy selfe, wha~ thou saydest that it hapned by order and disorder? PLA.
can the thanke, thou art nowe of a good remembraunce.
But doest thou perceyue Aristippus what ment ther by? ARI. Dyddest thou nat mene, that some beastes were ordayned for man to eate, some to cladde him with, some to tyl his lande for corn other to ryde on: lykewyse herbes and frutes, somme serue for meate and nourisshynge, diuers for medicine, stone and tymber to buyld with.
And whiles they be vsed in this wise as they be ordained there alway is order.
But if they be vsed for any other purpose, or one in the place of an other, there is disorder.
Abide Aristippus, thou hast forgotten some thynge behynde the, that wyll make moch of the matter: Perdie there be some bestes foules and fisshes which wyl serue to none of the purposes, which thou hast rehersed: As serpentes scorpions and suche other lyke: of byrdes the Egle the dunkyte, the Ospraye, and the Cormorant, whiche do rauyn and deuour that, which is neces+sary for mans lyuynge.
Also crowes and rookes may be brought into the same company: And of fysshes that which in latine is called torpedo, or euer he commeth oute of the water mortifieth the handes of the fysiher whiles he is drawyng vp of his net.
An other fysshe called Remora all though he be very lytell in body, yet wyll he staye and reteyne a greatte shyppe beinge vnder saylle, and lette hym that he shall not passe forthe in his voyage.
And dyuers other bothe fysshes and byrdes there be of semblable malyce: howe wylt thou bring them into the order that thou haste spoken of.
ARI. Mary as thou sayst Plato, can not well telle what to saye thereto.
For thou arte so nosilled in carnall affections, that thou kepist nothyng in remembraunce, but onely that whiche is commodious and pleasaunte.
All be it know wel inough shall not brynge these thynges in order sufficiently.
The prouidence of god is so inserutable that it can all be comprehended by mans imagination not withstandynge by my demaundynge and thyne aunswerynge truste we shall fynde therin matter competent ynough to helpe vs to that thing that we go about, that is to saye, to fynde oute knowlege wherin wysedom lieth hydde.
¶First Aristippus thou wilt agree that all creatures in the finall cause of their creation be good: That is to saye, hauynge respecte to that they be made for? ARISTIPPVS.
PLA. Therfore to that respect they can not be yl? ARI.
But malice is contrarye to good, and also taketh his denomina+tion of euyll? ARI.
Than spake not well whan sayde that dyuers beastes fysshes, and byrdes, were of semblable malyce as they were, of whome had spoken? AR.
For as moch as by their creation, they be al good? AR. Ye for the same cause.
P. Of the sayd bestes, byrdes fishes there be some partes whiche by phisitions, and them that seke for the naturall propreties of thynges, be founden reme+dies agaynst dyuers sicknesses.
So it hath bene affirmed by Democritus, his disciple Hippocrates.
And my self haue sene meruailes, whan suche thynges haue ben practised.
And for as moche as goodnesse came of them thou dyddest iudge all suche thynges to be good? ARI.
But whan thou knewist any man to be stungen with a serpente or Scorpion whereby the man perished, diddest thou suppose tha~, that the Scorpion or serpe~t was yl, or good styl as he was wha~ he seruyd for a medicine and preser+ued man from the dethe? AR.
am not so madde to suppose that to be good whereby man is destroyed.
suppose thou arte not: But sens we haue affyrmed al thing to be good in his creation hauynge respect to the ende wherfore it was created.
For as moche as the sayde beastes byrdes and fyshes receyued in theyr creation the disposicions before touched, whiche thou supposest to be ylle, by cause therby manne maye peryshe and dye.
Let vs consyder the cause fynall, wherefore those dispositions were put by God of nature into the sayd creatures, wherin wyll as briefely as can declare to the myne opinion or sentence.
Foresene alway that thou remembre, that the prouidence of god is aboue mans capacitie to com+prehende holly: But doubte nat, some part of it shal serue (as said) to the sufficiente declaration of that thynge that we pourpose.
SHal we nede Arist. to make any playner declaration what thing it is, for the which all other thinges lackyng the vse of raison were created? AR.
No, for it appereth to me sufficientely, that it is man: as thou hast alredy declared.
And we be agreed longe agone that man is of body soule? ARI.
And to the bodye the sences or wittes be ioyned, as vnder+standing is ioyned to the soule? AR. Accordynge.
Also the bodye is sensual mortall the soule is Intellectual immortal.
The fyrst is in co~mune with bestes, therfore it is bestly, the other is a portion of diuinitie therfore it is diuine and godly.
That hast thou longe agone proued: wher+fore wyl not nowe replye therin agayn the.
But dost thou also reme~bre, that sayd, that the diuine portion, durynge the tyme that it is co~serued by contemplation of the diuine maiestie it is perfect like vnto god, and whan it is ioyned vnto corporal affectis, it is vanyssheth away? AR. Ye remembre it wel. P.
Now here me out pacie~tly, and we shall come shortly to an ende of this matter.
Thou knowest well ynough Aristippus, that the bodye, and consequently the sences or that do perteyne thervnto, is the habitation or vessell, whiche receyueth the soule.
Also affectes or affections al though while ere named them corporal, yet in very dede they be first in the soule, as intencions be in the warke manne before he doeth warke: And whan the soule doeth exercyse theym hauynge his chiefe respect to vnderstandynge wherof we haue so moche spoken: than be they vertues.
But if they beinge mixt with the sences, be all ruled by them in hauynge onely respecte to the bodye, than be they vices, and the soule by the excludyng of vnderstandynge beinge made subiect vnto the bodye, they maye than be well called corporall: as that ought to be called the goodes of the vaynquysshour, whiche were the prisoners before he was taken: or the goodes of the bondma~ be called the lordes.
Nowe so it is that god, of whose maiestie we haue spoken, and be yet in speakynge, whan he hathe putte the soule (accompanyed with affectes as hir perpetuall seruauntes and ministres) into the body as into hir propre habitation, he gyueth to hir the sences, to be as hir slaucs or drudges.
And commyttynge to hir for a chiefe counsayllour vnderstandynge he leaueth with her also, Free wyll to be hir Secretarye.
Nowe if she mought alwaye kepe hir habitation and company in that astate, as they were lefte vnto hir: than shuld men be as goddis.
And those thynges whiche brought any anoyance to men, shulde alwaye be yll, and be made by nature in vayn.
And also god shulde seme to do ylle in the ordeynynge of them.
But sens of so many men as nowe be, haue bene and shall be in the worlde the bodyes in the principal humours, wherof they be (whiche as thou knoweste is bloud, redde coler me, and blacke called Melancoly) be of dyuers temperatures.
Therfore be they in wyse lyned in the operation of theyr sences or wyttes: As some to actes veneriall and highnes of courage, other more to get possessions and rychesse dyuers for euery lyttell displeasure to be cruelly reuenged.
Many to employe all theyr studye and labour in yl craft and deceyte: other do abhorre all trauayle as well of mynde as of bodye onely (as the blocke whiche Iupiter dydde sende downe into the water to haue rule ouer the paddockes) to lyestyll and do nothyng.
As soone as any of the sayde inclynations be conceyued in the sences the mynde begynneth to haue dilectation therin and offreth it to vs, as it were good pleasant profitable: than if our affectes by whom we be meued to do any thynge, do consent to the said dilectation, and than immediately wyll is corrupted so that she as false and disloyall, wryteth in the harte of man (whiche is the soules booke, wherein all thoughtes be wrytten) that she sayd Inclination meued and sette forthe by the sayde affectes, is profitable and good.
If the soule hastily without asking cou~+saylle of vnderstandyng, do approue the said {per}swasio~, bileuing wyl, with+out any other inuestigatio~ or serch: Tha~ she being abandoned of vndersta~di~g, loseth hir dignite, beco~mith ministre vnto the sences which before were her slaues who vsurping the preemine~ce, hauing the affectis Wylle holly at their do possede the body as theyr propre mancion, leauynge nothynge to the soule, but to vse onely her powers after theyr sensuall appetites.
And so Man bireft of that portion wher in he was lyke vnto god, is become equalle or rather inferior to brute beastes, for suche causes as before haue rehersed.
Nowe Aristippus, whan Man is ones broughte vnto this astate doest not thou suppose, that he forgetteth nowe or knoweth not what he is? or to expresse more playnly to the what meane Is he not ignorant that he is transformed from a man to a beaste? And supposeth styl that he is like vnto god, and in the order that we spake of, superiour vnto al other creatures and do nator ouer them al? AR. Ye that is true, he beleueth so veryly.
For whan vnderstandynge was excluded by the soule, and that she was subdued or maistred by the sences, than the simi+litude of god whiche was in vnderstandynge vanysshed from hym.
And whan he lefte his owne place of preeminence and dydde participate in carnalle affectes with creatures, which were to him inferiors, he brake the lyne of order and loste his superioritie: and consequentely broughte hym selfe and other into disordre, whiche as we haue agreed is euylle and contrarye vnto good, and by the same rayson is ennemye vnto god Whiche is onely goodnesse.
For no man wyll denye, but that thynge whiche is so contrarye vnto an other, that in no parte they may accorde but be alway repougnaunt: they be mutually ennemyes one to an other.
Nowe calle to thy that we were agreed that al creatures were made for ma~, and that he hadde the moste vse of them all.
Also they all were good in the order of theyr creation and that to man they were best mooste profitable as long as they continued in the sayde order And beinge in disorder they were also to manne warste, and mooste vnprofytable.
Moreouer all though some beastes, soules, and fyshes seme to haue in them a malice, wherby man may be hurt or anoyed: yet hauing respect to the cause fynalle wherfore they were made they were not withstandynge necessary vnto man specyally.
thanke the hartly Plato for this repetition: wherby thou haste well reuiued my reme~bra~ce, which was wel nygh op+pressed with the abunda~ce of mater, wherwith thou hast as moughte saye this communication.
knowe well inoughe Aristippus, that in matter of great importaunce to men that be sensuall, hauinge their myndes ingrossed with carnall affections, there is required a plaine and sensible forme of raisoning, broken nowe and thau with often repetitions: whiche all though to froward herers it semeth to make the matter tediouse, yet if they can abide it they shal therby re+tain some sedes of knowlege, like as in a lande that was neuer well husbonded, corne wyl growe springe in ere whan men litle loked, for to haue goten suche frute by theyr ylle husbondry.
But nowe set vp thyn eares Aristippus and dyligentlye here the misterye of the wonderfull goodnes and prouide~ce of god, whi+che shall be declared in the sayde cause final: whiche intend now to expresse open vnto the without further delay.
Go to now Plato haue al my hole mynde setlyd and prepared to here the, and shall not wyllyngly let one worde that passeth from thy mouthe eskape me.
Thou hast all redy graunted that a counning Artifycer foreseethe in his ymagination the figure of the thynge that he warketh, and to what effect it is wrought, which is properly called the cause finall.
And whan it is made he delyteth in the beholdyng it.
And the more per+fect and excellent that the warke is the more he therin reioycethe, and prepareth some meane to preserue it from brekynge or other destruction.
But there is none Artificer to be co~pared vnto god, eyther in foresyght or in care to preserue that whiche he hym selfe wrought.
Nor there is any mannes warkemanship lyke to his in perfection.
And by cause he consyderith that Man is the moste wonderfull of all his warkes, he reioiceth therin most and incomparably.
Also bycause he made hym to his owne similitude, he loueth hym accordynge to the commune prouerbe: All thynge loueth that, whiche is mooste lyke to hym selfe.
And therfore he is moste circumspect in the preseruation therof.
Wherfore considerynge that by Wylle, perchaunce corrupted, as late declared, Man mought declyne from that perfectio~, wherin he was made and by the parte sensible induced to rebelle agayne his owne creatoure thynkynge that of his owne power he hath all other creatures vnder his subiection and that all that he wylleth is good not as vnderstandynge wold instruct him, but as his affections deceyued by his sences do falsely perswade hym.
This eternall and incomprehensible goodnes whiche we calle GOL, louinge man as his image incomparably, hath prouyded to sytte in the waye, wherby VVYLL shall passe many sondry obstacles and lettes to cause hym to tary that in his course he not heedling in the botomlas pit of Ignorance, while he is in the way to rebel again his maker most mercifull lorde.
These necessarye lettes be diseses siknessis, wherby bodily stre~gth is abated, and therwith carnal affectis oppressid or minished Aduersite, vexatio~ trouble wherbi stordy courage pride ambitio~, other like mala~ders of the minde may be curid or at the lest wayes reformed.
And besydes these, be other ob+stacles, wherby man shall be of his arrogance whan he to moche presumeth on his propre power, knowlege, and industry.
And therfore he wyll frely vse all thinges at his pleasure wherin his sences haue dilectation, and his appetite moueth hym.
These thynges god foreseinge (as sayde byfore) most louingely and wysely prouydynge for his mooste dereste creatoure, agaynste the sayde perylle of forgettefulnesse, like as he made manne of soule and bodye, so with thinges necessary and profitable to the body he ordaynid thynges also necessarye profitable vnto the soule, sowinge amonge the herbis, that be holsome or plesant, other noysom and venemous.
In the grene banke lyeth the serpente hidde redy with his trembling tunge to stryke mortally them whiche doo approche hym.
The scorpion wou~den in the grene grasse lyeth watching with his forked tail in a redynes to styng the~ which loke not down to their fete.
The bodi infected or wou~ded, findeth in pain anguishe his owne, {pro}pre ignoraunce in that that he so moche estemed dilectation plesure which in so short a momente vanysshed awaye.
Also sens a lyttell herbe whiche is inanimate, maye chaunge pleasure in to peyne and helthe into syckenes or a lyttell vile worme at one stroke may bircue hym of all dilectation and pleasure, and fylle hym with so moche anguysshe and dolour, that the lyfe whiche he desyred euer to continue beco~meth to hym tedious and lothesome he shall therby not onely remembre that he is passible ther+fore no god, but also perceyue and consyder of how lyttell importance or valour is than his strength aucto+ritie or were he neuer so myghty a champion or so puisant a kynge or Emperour.
And with that remembraunce the parte sensible beinge rebuked, vnderstandynge eftesoones resorteth vnto the soule, and helpeth her to reforme all her holle householde settynge eftesones euery thyng in his propre place and office, as it was before free wylle was corrupted.
And if than the soule be circumspecte do restrayne VVIL of hir lybertie, compellynge hir to be subiecte and so obediente to raison, that withoute hir consente she shall dare to doo nothynge: than the craftye perswasions of the sencis shall no thinge auayle, but they them selfes wyll they or no, shall be constrayned to be styll drudges vnto the soule as they were ordayned.
But if manne do forgette to sette Wyll vnder the gouernaunce of rayson and with a circumspect deliberation, to appoint vnto hir limites and bondes whiche she shall not be so hardy to passe or excede.
After the body is eskaped from aduersyte, or is delyuered of vehement peine and anguisshe, forth with the senses do prepare the~ selfes eftsones to rebell.
And affectes whiche as wanton girles be flexible or redy to inclyne to euery motion, do prepare them with wanton countenaunce and pleasaunt promyses to allure eftesones Wille to their appetite: wherby the soule shalbe ageyn in daunger to perysshe onelasse she retaynynge still with hir vnderstandynge, in consyderynge hir propre state and condition, and reuoluinge what she before hadde suffred doo put Wyll in to the prison of Drede vnder the streyte custodie of Reme~braunce and Rayson.
And in this wyse as haue rehersed not onely he that suffreth, receyueth commodite of this wonderfull prouidence: but also other whiche doo beholde hym that sufferith, or hereth it sufficiently reported may and ought ther by examine the state of his owne per+sone and as mortall and passible and no god but the ymage of god by vnderstandynge, endeuoure them selfe to kepe that in perfection, hauing in good awayte, that they lette not affectes become to malapert but that the soule haue vnderstanding alway at her elbowe, whiche shall bydde raison correcte Wylle, if he be conuersaunt with these affectes.
And than shall man stylle remayne without any of the sayde transformations that we before spake of: and vse euery thynge accordynge to the effecte that they were fyrste ordayned for hym: whiche is the cause finall, wherof haue spoken and promisyd to declare vnto the, wherin shynethe the wonderfull prouydence, wherby god is best knowen.
Howe sayst thou Aristippus? doest thou beare away perceyue what haue al this whyle spoken? ARI. ye that do Plato, all thoughe hit be meruayllous: but yet me semeth thou haste omitted somewhat whiche shulde make of all that whiche thou spakest a perfecte conclusion.
PLA. Trowest thou so? Mary pray the telle me what lacketh, as thou doest suppose, and wyll ame~de that gladly for wold be loth that in that, whiche we go aboute shulde be founde imperfection.
remembre thou haste affirmed through al thy resoning, that in respecte of theyr creatyon be good and that all was created for man: More ouer that some thynges, whiche doo seme to be ylle, in very dede be not so, but be all good in theyr order of theyr creatyon.
And for profe of that thou dyddest induce by example, that aduersite and syknesse, dyd cure or mitigate affectes and vanites of the mynde.
Also that venemous herbes, serpentes, and wormes whiche semed to haue in them nothynge but malyce onely, by anoyinge of menne that were sensual, folowyng theyr affectes, and forgettynge their state with peyne and anguysshe, birefte them theyr pleasure, wherin they delyted, and made them remembre that they were passible: and by that consideration to reforme the~ selfes accor+dyng to their firste perfection wher in they were ordayned.
And so diddest thou conclude that aduersitie, syckenes, venemous herbes and bestes were good to that respect.
And therfore necessarily prouyded of god to the vse of man.
Nowe for as moche as all men be not sensuall nor ladde with carnall affectes or vanities: but some men kepynge the sences in theyr propre office or duetie also kepynge Wyll (as moughte vse thy wordes) within the precinct prescribed to hir by vnderstandyng: nede not so sharpe a monytion, as thou haste spoken of, where aduersitie syckenes, venemous matter or bestes do as sone and greuously anoy or hurt those good menne as them that be vicious: howe dareste thou affirme them to be good? or declare them to be a parte of prouidence, wherby the goodnesse of god is expressed? These thynges considered me thynketh Plato, thy conclusion (as sayd) is yet insufficient.
In dede Aristippus it semeth, that thou haste diligently herd me: but feare me, that for the olde controuersies betwene vs thou markest more what saye, to take me with some than to beare awaye obserue any thynge that may profyte the to knowe, in as moche as my conclusion whiche thou reprouest is not so insufficie~t as thou doest suppose.
Thou knowest that Scammony gyuen where nede is, and in a due and conuenient proportion, healeth them which be vexed with melancoly, but excedyng his measure or taken where that humour doeth not abounde in the stede of helthe bryngeth mortall sycknesse almooste incurable.
The same dothe Thapsia, Agaricus, and dyuers other which do pourge the body of superfluous humours.
The fruites named Millones and Cocombres aswageth the inordinate heate that procedethe of colere: yet in them whiche eyther by nature or occasion haue their belyes colde they procure intollerable tormentes or frettinges.
Mandragora and the iuise of Popie, called Opium, to them whiche by some innaturall cause be lette from slepe do profite moche, if they be measurably taken: co~trary wyse if they be ta+ken by him that is moch fleumatike, and of nature disposed to slepe very soundly, and also the medicine excedeth his portion he bringethe the patient in to so depe a slepe that he neuer awakethe.
But all thoughe these thinges, whiche haue rehersed yf they haue not ioyned vnto them Oportunitie and measure, do brynge either damage or dethe to them whiche receyue them: yet no man do accompte them for yll: but beinge putte in the nombre of medicines, wherby mannes bodye is they be called good.
¶Is there any thinge amonge men better or reputed more profytable than lawes: And yet was there neuer law made by any man so perfit, but that diuerse haue therby sustayned detriment, ye some that wylling+ly neuer offended.
Also some lawes by addyng to sondry opinions, be so inuolued or wrapped in doubtis, that they whiche ones were and ought to be open and playne to the people whiche lyueth vnder them, and be bounde to obey them, maye not without longe debatynge and great chargis be declared sufficient+ly And yet who is so moche displesed with any lawe, but that he wyll affirme, that lawes be good ye all though it happen somtime that they be yll executed.
¶Lyke wyse the venemous herbes beastes and fysshes to that ende and purpose, which haue declarid whervnto thei be ordeinid, be good whiche thou doest not denye me.
And than by the examples that haue rehersed my conclusion in decla+ration of prouidence is good sufficient.
For if thou thynkest, that shulde haue proued those thynges to haue ben so absolutely good that they mought not be to ani respect il, than thou lackest that naturall wyt, whiche all this whyle supposed hadde ben in the.
For wolde haue thought that thou haddest knowen, that nothynge is in this worlde so good but that hit may brynge damage to some man.
Fynally that vn+der the region of the Moone is nothi~g so good that it is not mixt with some yll but remaynyng in their {pro}pre degrees of order wherof haue spoken, one is better than an other, and be neuer yll but by disordre: and there also one is wars tha~ an other, by the degrees, do meane the causes wherfore they were ordeyned.
As by exa~ple to declare it more plain+ly: doest thou remembre Aristippus, whan we were spekynge of order disorder, that thou saidest, that som beastis were ordeyned for manne to some to cladde hym with, some to tylle his lande, other to ryde on, lykewise herbes frutes, and trees some to serue for nouryshyng, diuers for medicine and other to buylde with? ARI.
The Oxe, which tilleth the la~de, beareth befe wherwith man is noryshed his hyde serueth to make shoen to saue mens feete from colde and other anoyance.
The shepe beareth wolle to cladde with the body of manne commodiously.
And his fleshe is good to be eaten and where he lackethe puissaunce to drawe the ploughe or the wayne in stede therof he goinge and lyinge on the lande with his ordure and pysse compasseth the grounde, and maketh it fertile and able to bere ple~tie of corn.
Wherfore these two be sette in one degree in the lyne of order.
The horse and all other beastes whiche be lyke to that kynde, wylle drawe or carye.
And also their hydes wylle serue to that pourpose that the oxe hyde doeth.
But theyr fleshe is not apte to be eaten of men.
Wherfore they be a degree vnder the other: And soo consequentely all thynges as they be profytable more or lasse vnto man if he doo vse them, so be they hygher or lower in degree in the sayde lyne of order.
And yf an Oxe or a shepe haue moche flesshe on hym and sweete, he is named therfore a good oxe or a good shepe.
If a horse or a mule wyl beare a great waight, go far iournayes, he is named a good horse or a good mule.
And although a man aduisedly or vnaduisedly doo eate more beoffe or mutton than his stomake wyll beare, and therwith is sicke the oxe or the shepe ought not therfore to be called ylle.
Nor if a man take awaye thy money or garmentes and laye it on thyne owne horse or mule, and carye hit awaye with hym: this letteth not, but that thy horse or mule shall be called styll good.
But if thou wylte ryde by poste on thyne oxe or thy shepe, or roste thy horse or thy mule to banket with thy frendes, to those pourposes thou canste nat calle any of them good.
For they be out of their propre degrees or placis in the lyne of order: and therfore they be nowe ylle.
Semblably if in to thy potage wherwith thou intendest to be nourished thou doest cause to be putte suche herbes as do serue for violent purgations: or into thy salade chyppes of ooke, or of mapull, or buyldeste thy house with stalkes of fenell or malowes or couerest it with the leues of letis or beetis: these herbes or trees so vsed doo ceasse to be good, and may to these pourposes be nowe called yll.
So there is nothynge that is perfectly good but god onely and all other thynges the nerre they approche towarde his similitude the more doo they drawe to that perfection and the higher be they in the lyne of order wherof spake at the begynnynge.
¶This that haue nowe sayd Aristippus, if thou dost wel reuolue in thy mynde consider, thou shalt not fynde that lacke in my conclusion, that thou haste obiected.
But yet to satisfi the throughly, that in no part thou shalte thynke my raison vayne or vnprofitable wylt thou see that shall sufficiently proue that syckenes, aduersitie matter, or bestes venemous, beinge in their degrees in the lyne of order, be neuer ylle: but to that ende and pourpose that they were made for, thei be alway good? AR.
But forgette not that protested, that the hole prouidence and iudgeme~tes of god be to man, whyle he is mortal inscrutable ferre aboue his imagynation or knowledge: yet of his infinite goodnes he holdeth him contented that with due reuerence we shal measurably serche for them only to the intent therby the more to knowe hym, honour hym, and loue hym: after that maner do nowe endeuour me with the helpe of his spirite to proue, that his prouidence is excellent and most to be wondred at in that thynge wherin thou and many other do suppose that prouidence lacketh.
If thou canste brynge that well to passe, wylle than saye that the same and renome of thy wysedome that is spronge through oute Grece, is well employed.
And wyll affirme also, that kynge Dyonise, whan he gaue the to Dolidis was more liberall than wyse.
For he hadde bene better to haue gyuen to hym sixe the beste cities in Sicile, than to haue departed from suche a counsayllour.
But nowe alyttel while answere to suche questions as wylle demaunde the.
¶Be not we agreed that man is of soule and bodye, And that the soule is immortall and intelligible, but the bodye is mortal and sensible? ARISTIPPVS.
We be also accorded, that all other thynges in this worlde were made chiefely for manne.
And trowe thou wylt not denye, that god is all goodnes, and that he made man vnto his own image and similitude.
If god made any thynge to the inte~t that it shulde be ylle vnto man, whiche is his propre similitude, it shuld than seme that there shulde be some malice in god whiche were not onely vntrue but also to affirme horrible vnlefull.
Wherfore the contrary muste nedes be true, that god made euery thyng to the intent that it shulde be good vnto man: But how that may appere in such thynges as thou haste rehersed, whiche seme to be ylle theron restethe oure question.
The soule of man beynge immortall neuer dyeth or cesseth to be but after that it is ioyned with the body the body lyuynge hit lyueth also shewynge therby hir operations.
And whan lyfe departith from the body, the soule also departith im+mediatly notwithstandyng she after+ward liueth.
Than if whan she was ioyned to the bodye she retayned the sencis and affectes in due obedience, not sufferynge them to excede theyr duetie or offices, And haue vntylle the seperation of hir frome the body, ensued alwaye the counsayle of Vnderstanding and Rayson, and so haue contynued in the forme of a man, Surely after hir departynge frome the bodye, accordynge as by hir operation the body abounded in vertues so is she than immediately with god, whose similitude she so well hath kept, and there is promoted to ioye and pleasure perpetualle more or lasse after hir merites.
And that pleasure beinge intellectuall shall more excede the dilectations of the bodye, whiche onely be sensuall than perfecte helthe doeth excede syckenes, or the greattest reioysinge of the mynde that manne mought possible haue of a sensuall motion, mought surmount the grettest discomforte or henynesse.
God desyringe that all soules moughte come to this ioye to warne them of theyr office whome he seeth neelygent, he sufferith the bodye, wherwith they be ioyned (as sayde before) to be touched with sondrye aflictions, to the intente that they perceyuinge howe vnable they be, the lechor to execute his bestly pleasure in the feuer dowble tertian or thyke, the proude man to aduance hym selfe aboue other, beinge infected with lepry, or the lowsy sycknes callid phthuta is, or stungen with the litle and feble scorpion he that is cruell and fierce howe lytle he maye preuayle agayne the colike passion the stone or the goute or the falsehode of the adder whiche as soone as he hath stunge the ma~, he glideth forthwith in to the hedge, eskapith the fury of hym, which beinge hurt is not able to folowe hym: The couaytouse marchaunt with his shyp curtith the sees, and with his sayies and steerne presumeth to inforce the wyndes to brynge hym in to those costes from whens he may brynge home that my serable trafike wheron he wil co~sume al his study wyt, and at the last leue it to be consumed by other while he is in the middes of his iornay vnder all his sayles the wynde blowynge a good koole, and hauing therwith a faire water, commeth the fyshe called Remora lyttel more than a gurnard kleuing faste to the kele of the shyppe makith hir tary, holdeth hir styl withoute vntil some time risyth a pyrry and breaketh all the tackelinge, soo that the marchant is faine if he wyll saue his lyfe to flee awaye in a bote, and retourne home agayne without money or marchaundyse.
Amonge those thynges Aduersitie, or as it is more commonly called, frowarde or contrarious fortune, countreuayleth as moch as all this, wherof we haue spoken, and procedeth to the same effecte.
But what sayest thou, if he that is sicke hurte with venym or vexed with fortune do in nothyng reforme his lyuyng but in his peynes or trouble do blaspheme god and whanne they be withdrawen from hym he is as ylle or perchaunce wars than he was before, shall we than suppose that thynge to be good or profitable, wherby he not onely is not refourmed, but also made than he was erste? PLA.
pray the is the art of a surgion good and profitable or ylle and vnprofytable? Answere me therto.
And he whiche in that arte is counnynge and perfect, is to that respect good: and therfore is called a good surgion.
Than thou doest admitte, that a sur+gion is good, and that his arte is good and profytable.
But is his art declared by any thynge elles but by his medicines, or instrume~tes wherwith he doth cutte perse, or cantherize as necessitie of the wounde or soore doeth require? AR. Yes there requireth also that he knowe the nature and cause of the wounde or soore and that he can well ordre his playsters and oyntementes, and also vse handsomely the sayd instrumentes.
Aristippus thou arte nowe importunate and woldest put me to more busines than nedeth, sins rehersed that surgion, whiche in his arte is counnynge and perfecte, what meueth the to put to this addition whiche is vayne and superfluous? as if that in hym whiche is {pro}fect mought any thing lack, or that in perfecte, thou woldest set degrees of comparison.
But admitte for the case that our surgion haue all thyng that in that arte maye be required, and also that he be thy naturall father, whiche aboue all other and with great affection loueth the, suppose also nowe for this tyme that in of thyn eyen grewe a fistula, wherby thou arte in icoperdie to lose thy syght, and also to haue thy visage therby defourmed.
If thy father desyrynge to haue the healed, and knowynge (as thou spakeste) the nature and cause of the sayde fistula, wolde prepare suche remedyes as were mooste expediente to cure the: woldest thou refuse hym for thy good father, accompt hym thyn enmy? AR. Nay trowe, than were it almes to hang me.
That is hartily spoken Aristippus make god a vowe: therfore commende the.
Than wylt thou loue hym better than thou dyddest before? AR.
For to that natural benefite, that receyued of him by my generation, he addeth to moche humanitie and kyndenes in helpynge that lose not my syght, wherby shulde be depriued from all worldly comfort and be also deformed in my visage which blemysshe shuld cause me~ that were honorable to adhorre my presence.
And therfore see that thou cha~ge not herafter this good opinio~.
Now thy father doeth perceyue by his cou~nyng that this disease requirith sharp medicines as those which be mordicatife or biting, abstersife or clensinge or {per}chance cantherization that is to say, that the place corrupted be skorched with a hotte bournynge yron: whiche if thou wylte pacientlye suffre and vse euer after suche order in dyet as thy father appoyntethe the thou shalte alwaye haue thy syght sounde, and thy visage sause and vndeformed, whiche shall be not to thy selfe only but also to thy father and surgion that cureth the, greatte ioye and comforte.
But contrary wise whan thou felest the medicine warke sharply, freting and gnawynge in the flesshe that is putrified or els art touched with the fyre whiche is in the hote glowyng yron, wherwith he doeth cantherize the soore: If than thou doest stryue agayne thy surgion and father that goth about to hele the murmuryng agaynste hym with all disobedience and wordes of villany, dispising his humanitie and kyndenes, and to be cured by the sayde remedies, eyther thou rubbest thyne eyen remeuest the medicine frome the soore into all the syght of thyne eyen, or els strugglynge contemptuously agayne the holsome hande of thy father doest wylfullye thraste the bournynge yron into thyn eyen: than what maruaylle is it, if that whiche thy father ordeyned to cure the, nowe by thyne impacience and disobedience, tourne to thy damage: that is to saye as well put clene oute thy sight as also deforme thy visage for euer? whiche thynge hapnynge, mayste thou Aristippus by any rayson blame therfore thy surgion? AR. Nay in good faythe to saye truely.
What the medicine or instrume~t whiche by thyn impacience and foly thou dyddest conuert from the place where they shuld haue wrought for thy helth and dyddest thraste them into thyn cien wherby insued to the more grefe and peryll shal we iuge the medicine or instrumente therfore to be ylle? And here remembre well Aristippus the cause finall, and the degree and place in the lyne of order whiche haue byfore sufficiently declarid.
In good faythe wyll not dissemble, see nothynge here that ought to be callid yll, but my selfe if were in the case that thou hast nowe purposid.
If thou holde the there, we shall soone be agreed.
Also if nowe thou beinge blynd and the fistula growing euery day gretter and greatter, the deformite of thi visage more and more thou not onely refusest to receyue any medicine, but also doest murmure agaynst thy good father cursynge, hym for his medicine gyuyng, which through thyn owne foly and wil+fullnes is conuerted from remedye vnto thy damage.
If than thy father beholdynge the to be incurable, and also maliciouse towarde hym withoute hope of amendmente did exclude the oute of his companye, refusynge the for his sonne, supposist thou that for this he shulde be callid an yll father or surgeon? AR.
No in good fayth: seinge that euery thing that he doth is with good Iustice raison.
But he is stille good as he was before also that which he doth now for the due punishing of a dissobedient vnnatural sonne, is as wel good, as that whiche he did before to the intent to cure hym of his malady if he wold haue ben patient suffre those medicines which were prepared to hele him.
Nowe wylt thou see what meane hereby? Is any so proprely thy father as god which is the first the chiefe and immediate cause of thy generation? or is any surgeon so counnynge as he, whiche seeth more plainely the original motion cause of euery disese of the soule, that is to say of vicious affectes, than any man can see the outeward sore or skurfe of the fistula? And more perfectely knoweth the best remedye therfore than any surgion knoweth howe to heale a smalle whelke in a chyldes fyngre.
Now sens ones thou hast graunted to me that vice is yll, bycause it is contrary to vertue whi+che thou affyrmiddest to be suppose vice to be the sycknes of the soule as it is in dede: and for as moche as it bringeth in ignorance whiche is ennemie to rayson and knowlege who be as the eyen of the soule, and if it growe moche it deformeth the soule and putteth clene away vn+derstandynge whiche is the visage, wherin (as sayd) is the similitude of god therfore resemble it vnto the fistula.
Whiche foule daungerous disease God as a louyng father and good surgion espyinge in the and de+syryng to heale the therof, doth his cure more spedyly and quyckely he vseth sharpe medicines touchynge the with sickenes (wherin recken as well diseases growyng in the bodye, as also hurte or griefes by outwarde occasion or chaunce) or with Aduersitie, by wrongefull imprisonment deathe of assured frendes, towardly chyldren, or of a wyfe, constant and pacient, losse of thy princis fauour, or great authoritie possessions or moueable rychesse, or other lyke temporall benefite.
If thou sufferynge this paciently doest thankefully receyue thy fathers kyndnes industry in curing of the and exactly obserue the diete, wherto he doeth appoynt the: that is to say doest liue in the custome of vertue, eschuynge vicious co~munication, yl counsayle, and flatery which be the vnholsom and quaysy metes of the soule, wher+by is ingendred the venemous humour of ylle opinion, wherof commeth vice whiche haue resembled vnto the fistula: thou shalt be cured and haue the sight and visage of thy soule preserued pure and clene: Contrarye wyse if thou mourmour or grudge at the sayde remedies estemyng the~ as grefes no medicines, blamynge or repriuynge god as vndiserete or cruelle in the ministration of them and stryuing there agaynst with the powar of thy sencis, vsing them dishonestly in som pleasure vo+luptuouse thou tournest them from the sore wheron they shulde warke, and with them doest thou putte out rayson and knowledge, the eyen of the soule: And than for thy folysshenesse, impacience, and blasphemye God sufferinge thy soule to be both blynde with Ignoraunce, and defourmed with vice, sens thou haste vtterlye loste his gloryous symylitude, he wylle frome thens forthe abiecte the, and for thyne vnkyndenesse commytte the to perpetualle prisone there to be punysshed in derkenes, where thy foule defourmed visage shall neuer be sene to the reproche of hym, vnto whose similitude thou were created.
Nowe Aristipp. sens thou diddest approue that whiche was done by the carnal father surgeon to be good, bicause he did it with Iustice raison what saist thou to that which god ordayneth doth who so farre excelleth in those two qualities: that the iustice executed amo~g me~ that be mortal in co~parison of his Iustice is wronge: that which we take for raison, in regard of his wisdom is folishnes fa~+tasi, not bicause it is nat iustice reso~ that we haue: but bicause that which is in god is euer one {per}fect without any diuision or mixture? A.
In good faith Plato, wote not well what to say to the.
Finally am co~pelled by that argumente that thou haste made, to agree that suche thynges whiche before semed to me to be yl, be to that respecte whiche thou hast good and profitable: that is to saye in the refourmyng of ma~s soule where it is curable and in the declaration of the Iustyce of god, where man is incurable.
But what sayest thou to that which hast so lyghtely passed ouer? meane where the sayde diseases and afflixions hapneth to hym, whiche is all+redy good and nedeth not so sharpe reformation? PL. Why Aristippus, supposest thou that euer any manne was so good that in hym were neuer vicious affectio~? Perdic our may Socrates, whan he was yonge, and wroughte in a Masons shoppe with his was not so pure from affectes as he was after that he hadde ben the herer of Anaxagoras: by whose doctrine, and also beinge continually vexed with pouertie sondry reproches, and somtyme stripes of malicious quarellyng {per}sons: Also with the continual neuer cessing brauling chiding of his most cursed wife Xanthippa which he cal+lid his domestical excercise he by the gentyll vertue of pacience became a good man as he was called and taken.
But to the intente that thy mynde maye be satysfied, Let vs nowe admitte that men whiche be good or at the lefte haue suche abundance of vertue, and so lyttel do inclyne to vicious affectes that hit requireth not, that they be purged with suche sharpe afflixions, as we haue spoken of.
Howe sayest thou? supposist thou that vnto them the sayde afflixions be ylle and vnprofitable? AR. Ye verely.
And also if it were leful to speke it me semeth that therin, god dealith not with al men indifferently.
PL. Surely Aristippus that is not onely vnlefull to speake, but also to thynke it, hit is greatte presumption and folye.
And that shall well proue if thou wylte attentifely here me.
In all the trayne of oure communication hitherto, sens we began to speke of prouidence, it hath alwaye appered, that god is father to man by creation, and loueth man aboue all his creatures: But what sayest thou Is there any more token of loue than whan the fa+ther with al his study power ende+uoreth him self to bring his sonne to great honour which if he may bring to good passe there is nothing maye cause him so moche to reioyce? AR. Suerey nothynge.
And to the intent that his sonne maye be demed of all men worthy to be promotid to honoure he accustometh hym to trauayle either in lernynge and studye, or els in corporall exercise, the one to make him wise the other to make hym stronge and valiaunt in bodye wherby he maye declare hym selfe worthy to haue promotion.
And wyse fathers the better that they loue theyr sonnes the more diligent be they, And as mowghte saye the more importune in kepyng them in continual exercise, thynkyng that therby the strength and delyuernesse of the bodye increacith and if hit be in study of mynd wyt is augme~ted: lyke as contrary wyse by sluggardy idelnes the said actiuite is apalled and the wyttes consumed: wherby men be made vnapte for the life whi+che is actife or politike.
If the sonne be of gentill disposition and lyke to his father perceyuinge his fathers honest desyre and purpose and therwith being inflamed with desyre of glory he wyll not onely content hym with laboure, but also if his father doo brynge hym vnto any great tournament or wrastlynge, he wyll prepare hym selfe to refuse no man, whiche wyll offre to assayle him.
And whan he beholdith one come agayne hym, whiche is of suche puissance that in his syght hath vaynquished or ouer throwen men mo than a hundred all thoughe nature somewhat touchethe hym with feare, yet remembrynge that his father beholdeth hym, who hath so tawght him and gyuen hym comfort that he shall not be vaynquished excepte he wyll and that his harte fayle hym, consyderynge also the pryce of the bataile or wrastlinge, whiche is honoure lasse or more after the estimation of his prowesse in vanquyshynge the moste strong and daungerouse champions, wyll he not troweste thou abyde sternely his aduersary and receyue his assaultes ioyousely without any shrinkynge? And awayte whan his aduersaries strengthe dothe decrese or his breth failith that he than inforsynge his myght ioininge thervnto polycie may ouerthrowe hym.
And so with moche gladenesse and commendation of all the beholdars of whome some perauenture at the beginninge iudged hym foolehardy, he shall receyue the honoure that he hath deseruid: to his owne comforte to the incredible ioye of his good father who aboue all thynges wisshed to see this conclusion? AR.
Now hath he that thynge wherfore his father broughte him vp so delygently.
And the whiche he hym selfe beinge lyke to his father, of his naturall inclynation desyred.
PL. Hadde he it gyuen to hym for any thynge els but by cause he approued hym selfe to be valiant and hardye wherof honoure was the pryce and reward? AR.
PL. Wherwith dyd he approue him selfe in suche wise to haue wonne that By any other thyng than by ouerthrowing or van quishinge his puissaunte aduersary? AR.
Than it semeth that without a puisant his hardynes and prowesse coulde neuer haue bene proued? AR.
And without hardynes or strength is a voice vayn and of none effect or profite? AR.
For as moche as prose is the operation whereby the sayde qualities, hardynes and strength be expressed is it not so? AR. Yes verily.
PL. Yet am gladde, that thou art so raisonable: It may perchance tourne the to some commoditie.
But Aristippus, as we remembred while ere, in those exercises whiche be commonly called games be dyuers prices one more than an other, and they be gyuen to men according to the strength that they haue employd, which is iu+ged by the co~parison of their stre~gth whome they haue excelled: to some the fyrste game or pryce to an other the seconde and so in order.
And doest thou not thynke these exercises to be good and profytable whereby thou shalte wynne a rewarde, and also worshyppe, with comforte also vnto thy father, and increase of his loue and fauour towarde the? AR. Yes in good faythe.
And also thou woldest loue him better tha~ euer thou dyddeste, If often tymes he broughte the to that whereby thou shuldest receyue suche profyte and worshyppe? ARI.
We be nowe at that conclusion, the whiche thou haste soo longe gaped and loked for.
That is to saye? It shall playnly appiere vnto the that the sondry afflixions that do happen to good men, come not without prouidence and the goodnesse of god ne be ylle and vnprofytable to them that do paciently suffre them.
Therfore pray the Aristippus, whyle declare to the pacience do thou paciently here me, And shall sooner than thou wenest sette out to thyne eye that we two haue sought for: meane that knowlege wherin wysedom is hid.
And than like as the my+nar whiche after he hath founde the place where the vayne of gold lieth labourethe busyly to dygge vp the Oore and after cesseth not to trye it from the stones and with contynual trauayle to fynde out the pure gold: so shalte thou ones hauyng the sayd knowledge, neuer cesse to trauaylle in the exercyse of thy lyfe, to fynde oute wysedome.
am verye well contente and desyrous to here howe thou wylte brynge to passe that meruaylous conclusion.
Thou remembreste Aristippus, that we were agreed longe agone that for as moche as God, is perfectely good, and the fountayne frome whense all goodnes procedeth: All that is ylle is contrary and ennemye to god? AR. Ye, am not so shorte witted but that remembre al that thou hast spoken, if thou in this wise doest eftesones reherse it.
And thou hast not denyed but that he is the fyrst mouer, and without hym nothynge is moued or done.
PL. Sens good and yll can not procede from one fountayn, god neuer moueth to ylle, nor doeth any thynge that is ylle: what sayst thou therto? AR.
We were also agreed, that god created the serpe~t, the scorpion, the venemous fysshes and herbes, as well as them whiche were commodiouse and holsome: that he made all thinge for man, whome he loued aboue all his creatures? ARI.
Also nothynge hapneth withoute him which is the first principal mouer, either helth or sicknesse, prosperite or aduersitie riches or pouertie and he beareth the kais of life and deth, for he that made and dyd put the soule in to the body, hathe the power to plucke it out: supposist thou that any other hath with hym equall authoritie? AR. No.
grauntid longe agone, that as he is one in begynninge so is he euer one in gouernaunce and maye suffer no ptere or lyke in equalite.
Nowe by that we two haue gatherid it appereth (& if thou loke well) that nothinge is made yll of god.
And tha~ nede we no further ar+gume~t, But god made al thi~ges for ma~, whom he loueth what exterior thinge so euer happeneth to any good man, it is good.
And therfore siknesse, aduersitie, and dethe if they happen to a good man be good.
And therfore hit shulde suffise to a good man if he suffre any of the said afflixions to thynke and say to him selfe: God whiche sente to me this, is all good, hath in hym none yll nor any yll procedeth of hym, and am one of the nombre of those creatures, whome he loueth beste: wherfore this that he hath sent me is good and not ylle, sens hit is necessarye that be therwith contentid and take heede that with myne opinion make not that yll whiche is good.
¶But although this were sufficie~t to satisfye a good man, who wolde not labour to seke any further in the prouidence of god: yet to the Aristippus who beinge longe nosyllyd in wordly pleasures, wilt not admit that any thynge, which is thervnto contrari, may be expedient or necessa+ry vnto a man that is vertuous and lacketh suche vice whiche requireth sharp admonition, and therfore thou requirest a more ample large declaration: wyll sette out a more plaine profe in applieng my raysons to the examples similitudes which haue alredy induced.
¶God who made manne vnto his ymage, and louethe hym with more feruent affection than any carnall father loueth his childe, bringeth vs vppe in the exercise of the commune imbecilitie or feblenesse of oure nature, as hunger thurste colde, werynes after labour annoyaunce, displeasures whiche do happen in the societie or lyuinge of men together, diseases wherin is no ieoperdie and suche other littell incommodities incident to mortalitie: of al the whiche no man may be quite, declaring vnto vs by Vndersta~ding that in this life we must of necessitie trauaile and suffer therwith geuing vs co~forte that who so euer by this exercise waxeth stronge and hardy, hereafter beinge brought where he shal proue his strength agaynst puissaunte mighty aduersaries that is to saye anguisshe and peine sharpe and perillouse sickenes cruel aduersitie in any thing that fortune semeth to rule losse of children frendes or fauour of princis prisonment or exile and like other tourmentes and vexations of body and mynde: if he valiantli do resist and with fortitude whiche is the strengthe of the mind, do subdue and vanquisshe those aduersaries, he shall haue the rewarde that belongeth to good men which no tyme can consume, no powar can minisshe none euyll can deface.
And to whette the courage of man to desire this e~terprise god giueth to him this comforte, that these thynges whiche shall so sharply assayle him, be ordaynedde onelye to proue his strength, and that they be inferiours vnto hym, if he put out his strength to the vttermoste sens god whiche louith hym aboue all his creatures hath ordayned nothynge to the intent to distroy hym, but to his benefyte, if he doo employe his power and wyll thervnto, accordynge as he hath receyuid them.
¶Now if the soule haue in the bodye intire domynion and rule, And that man be in his right fascion (as sayde longe ago) that is to saye lyke to his father: of his noble nature he desyrithe to wynne that in comparable price, whiche is promysed to them that shal be so happy to gette the victorye, wherfore in this wyse he armith therto his courage ¶Fyrst he consydereth that his father is good, and that he moste tenderly louethe hym.
Also that he brought hym not vp from the fyrste tyme that he lyued, in those littell ex+ercises of naturall infirmitie in vaine or without any purpose.
But to the intente that thereby he shall fele (as it were) the sente of more greuouse afflictions, wherof they be but the shadowes, and by a lyttell laboure and sufferaunce he shal prepare him selfe, to sustayne and contempne a more greater trauayle and pacience.
He reuoluith also in his mynd, that euery man whiche in his harte desireth honour, couayteth some honest occupaion or labour, and is prompt and alway forward to do his office or duetie in euery perill or daungier.
For to what wyse and dylygente man is it not a peine to be ydle? And yet where idelnes is not, nedes must be labour.
The fathers bedeth theyr children to apply them ernestly to study or laboure and wyll not lette them be ydle although it be holy daye, and doo constrayne them to sweate and often tymes to weepe.
Where the mothers wold sette the~ on theyr lappes, and kepe them atte home all the day in the shadowe for burnynge theyr white.
God hath toward good men and women the mynde of a father best doeth loue them: therfore he vexith the~ with sondry busynes, griefes, damages, that they may therby gather a substa~cial stre~gth, sins they which be fra~+kid vp in Idelnes do becum vnlusty and with theyr owne burdon be shortly suffocat.
It is to men no litle pleasure to be holde a yonge man that with a good courage receiuer on his spere a wylde bore or a harte comminge vpon him: or without feare abideth with his swor in his hande the fyerce lyon, whic commeth to assaile hym.
But the are not the thynges where to daynethe to tourne ones his beinge but tryfles and onely pleasures of mannes vanitie and litenes.
For the syght whiche is worthy to haue god the beholder therof is to se the creature, which he louith best to trye his strength with fortune or anguishe, if he be chalengid for therby strength whiche is a vertue and part of that diuine portion, wherby man is lyke vnto god, is prouid, the other strength as it is of the bodye, so is hit as the bodye is, commune with bestes: and as it is more fra and vncertayne than the selfe body, in lyke wyse the pryce or rewarde that it deseruith or rather lokith for, is vncertayne and also inconstant.
But looke to the other fortitude or strength, whiche is a pacient resiste~ce of suche thynges, whiche opinion doth set forth, with a terrible visage of damage or grefe.
It thou be sicke, the humours wherof thy bodye is made do but their nature contendeth with fleume bloudde with melancoly: the one couaiteth to vanquysshe the other: that whiche is hotte refuseth to be colde, moysture and drowthe wyll not abyde in one place, by this variaunce they haste them to theyr dissolution, If this co~tention be curable, hope maketh hit tollerable.
And if the warste falle, dethe shall dissolue it for it is not for aye or perpetuall.
¶Aduersitie is not so greuous, bycause it is oute of the body, and nothynge compelleth vs to suffre but our owne wylles.
For if we were content with that whiche onely our nature hath gyuen vs, we shuld not be constrayned to knowe what that worde Aduersitie mente, But sens we contempne hir as nedy and myserable and sue to come in to the ser+uice of fortune whose nature is to be alwaye mutable and euer inconstant, nor gyueth any thyng, but lendethe hit onely.
If we receyue any thyng of hir mocky she hande what shall it greue vs to paye that agayne whiche we haue borowed? why shulde we eyther be vngentyll creditours or be angrye that we can nat tourne the nature of hir that wylle not obey or folowe any mans commaundement or counsaylle but may be subdued with pacie~ce, where she can neuer be vanquysshed with raison? Moreouer god is content that we shall excelle hym in that that he may not suffre ylle, and we maye by sufferaunce subdue hit.
For he is in more estimation that hath ouercom a puisaunt and valiant enemy, than he whiche hath none ennemye at all.
Thou receyueste of thy father this comfort, that no ma~ lyueth so poorely in the worlde as he came into hit.
And he hathe nede of a lyttell that measureth aboundance by natures necessitie and not by superfluitie of ambicious desyre.
Fortune hath not so sharpe a weapon that it may byte on the soule.
And whome she lengest supporteth with moste aboundance of all thynge, them for a generall rule god lytell fauoureth: sens there is no rewarde, where lacketh merite.
Contrarywise the ende of trauaylle is ease: And the father whiche beholdeth his sonne labour mightily reioyceth therat, and prepareth that after his labour he may lyue pleasantly.
Who, knowynge a great hepe of golde to be hydde on the toppe of a rough hylle wolde not crepe vppe through thornes and brembles to fetche it? and although his visage handis were scratched, and his body and legges greuously prycked, yet wold he not cesse vntyl he came to the toppe.
And if any man whiche behelde hym thus trauayllynge, wold call hym wretched and foolysshe: he sayinge nothynge, wolde thynke how happy and welthy he shall be, whan he hath opteined that thynge wherfore he laboreth, And doeth laughe at the ignorance or foly of them whiche for a peyne that dureth nat longe, wyl for beare to goo with hym and to be partners of that, wherby they shall euer after be welthy.
¶Golde is a coruptible mater, and shall ones be consumed, but that tresure, wherfore mannes soule ought to labour may neuer be wasted or in any qualitie or quantite appayred or minysshed: that is to say, it shall euer be lyke good and lyke moche.
Wherfore what peyne so euer be ta+ken about the gettynge therof, it is not greuous, hauynge respect to the gayne.
Nor he that trauayleth ther+fore maye be named myserable or wretched: sens Miserye is the priuacion or lacke of all maner of comforte.
For in hope of victory if thou faylle not thy selfe, comforte is redy, if thou doest not refuse it.
In so moche as nothynge is miserable, but if thou doest so thynke it.
For all Fortune is good to hym that constantly suffreth.
And who was euer so fortunate, that whan he was subdued with impacience dydde not desyre to cha~ge his astate? Suffiseth it not to the that he that vanquyssheth is demed honorable, and he that is recreant is wretched and miserable? Howe shall it be knowen on what part thou standist without an experience? If thou haue alwaye good wyll, strength neuer fayleth the: but if by the puisanee of fortune thou be set on thy knee haue a good harte, for god standeth at thyn elbow and if thou thynke on him, he wyll sette the vp and make thy strengthe double as moche as it was.
Wylt thou lerne one good poynt of defence, whi+che may perchance do the ease agein some daungerous assaultes? ¶Fortune hathe taken frome the that, whiche she had lent to the.
Reuolue than in in thy mynde, that eyther those thynges were not good in dede as they were supposed to be or els man is in better astate tha~ god is hym selfe, for them whiche we haue, god vseth not, as carnall dilectation, plesant and deintie meatis orient iewelles or great treasure of moneye these perteyne not to god.
Than is it to be thought that eyther god lackith those thinges that be good tha~ lackith in him beatitude or perfection of ioye: or els hit is a argumente that those thynges not good, that god wyll not vse, is contented to lacke.
Fynally be veri goodes that be within gyuen by raison.
For they be sure durynge nor can not decaye or she for any occasion.
They that without vs lent onely by fortune be good by opinion onely And ough they participate theyr name the other yet is there not them the propretie or nature of odnes for they be not durable: they be oftentymes the occasion euyll: Wherfore they be for the ore parte with ylle men as mooste for their nature.
And few good haue them, or they do contynue a lyttell tyme with them by the iuste ordynaunce of god leste the mo vsynge of them shuld brynge ditation into the sences, whereby they mought be prouoked to rebell.
And Vnderstandyng whiche is occupied in co~templation of the diuine maiestie mought be sodaynly expelled, And the soule lackynge counsell shulde gyue place to carnall affections and appetites.
Whiche be not the better to them selfe nor theyr frende: There is ay lacke, where is inconstance.
Fynally there is no gretter comforte to hym that is good, than to be sene in the companye of good men.
If thou sekeste for a good carpenter or a good Smythe, as thou goeste throughe the cytie, thou harkneste where is moste hewyng or betynge with hamers, and there thou goest in and supposest to fynde hym, that thou lokest for.
Semblably if thou wylt haue a good man, go loke hym out, where thou herist that sharp sicnes raineth or where iniustice gouer+neth wylle ruleth, great power oppresseth: there shalte thou fynde him that thy harte desyreth.
Thou maist well accompt hym for a great foole, that to lyue double his naturall lyfe wolde not abyde to be ones or twise launced in the moste tendre parte of his bodye or wolde not begge his breade for one twelue moneth to be a kynge afterwarde duryng his life.
Stonde boldly agayne sickenes and fortune, the one is natural the other is casualle In the fyrste is necessitie whiche wylle thou or no, thou muste suffre: If thou doest hit wyllyngely, thou knoweste the price If thou addest to angre thou doubleste thy peyne.
In the seconde is no necessitie, for thou moughteste alway refuse hit, as welle whanne it was prosperous, knowynge it to be vnstable and burdaynous as also whanne hit is aduerse or contrarious, consyderynge that hit was neuer moche thyne owne that thou haddeste anye ryghte to reteyne hit: sens it was ordeyned for other as well as for the.
And Fortune whiche is the disposer thereof neuer made bargayne with the that thou shuldeste stylle kepe hit: And if she dydde brynge forthe thy recordes.
She lackethe not wytnesses innumerable to proue that she hathe bene euer inconstant.
Defye hir malyce: for whanne she hathe doone hir warste, yet shalte thou haue more than thou broughteste with the.
And that whiche aboundeth shall comme of thyne industrye, and not of hir false liberalitie.
And if thou doest boldlye resyste hir, thou shalte haue that aduauncemente and rychesse gyuen the of god, wherein she shall haue no powar or authorytie, whiche shalbe suche as the hundred thousande parte thereof, shall sourmount al that euer she gaue sens she was fyrste called Fortune.
¶Nowe howe sayst thou Aristippus be those thynges whiche thou dyddest suppose to be annoyances incommodities, iniustely sente vnto good men? or hauynge respecte to order and the cause finall, that is to say to the ende whervnto they were ordayned, whiche haue declared be they vnto them necessary moste expedient? AR.
Now in good faith thou hast brought me to that poynt, that wote not what to say to the.
But yet kepe thy promyse and tell to me what thou thynkist in this matter.
Me semeth by thy raison that peyne and aduersitie be as expedient to them whiche be good, as labour and busynes are to them whiche be industrious.
And wherfore? Go to Aristippus, be not asshamed to confesse the trouthe though it be co~trary to thy profession.
In dede thou haste almoste made me chaunge myne olde opinion.
But sens thou haste gotten me into suche a strayte, that can nat sterte from that haue promysed: wyll nowe confesse that the cause why the sayde afflixions be expedie~t for good menne, is for as moche as therby they be not onely preserued styll in theyr ryght ymage or figure: but also for theyr constaunce in trauaylle, they shall receyue that inestimable rewarde, which thou saydest was ordayned for good men.
Nowe perceyue that the sedes which Socrates had sowen in thy minde, do begyn nowe to sprynge with this lyttell waterynge: whervnto if thou wylt adde to thy diligence in pluckynge vp the weedis of wanton affections as sone as they begyn to appere in thy mynde: thou shalte shortly perceiue the frutes of wysedom (for the whiche we do seke) spryng abundantly, with whose mooste dilectable thou shalte neuer be saciate.
¶But nowe sens we haue treated of sondry matters syth we fyrst entred into co~munication, leste hereafter thou mayste repute me for one of them whiche do speke of many thinges and conclude vpon none, and so accompt me but for a babbler: Lette vs examine if our mater haue hither+to hanged well togyther or if there haue ben any vayne digression whiche serued nothynge to the purpose that we fyrste intended: or what thynge lacketh nowe, whiche maye make to our communication a sufficient ende or conclusion.
And pray the thynke not the tyme tedious that is saued from ydelnes, and we haue nowe lyttell more than two myles to ryde.
And truste soo to moderate my selfe that we shall at one tyme arryue bothe at the cytie, and at the conclusion of our matter that we haue pourposed.
Shall tell the truthe Plato, hir is lasse griefe to me to abyde the residu+all though thou woldeste talke two dayes continually than hit was at the begynnynge to abyde herynge one houre such swetenes fele now in thy raisonyng.
Therfore do what thou wylt for haue both my neares and my mynde wyde open to receyue all that thou speakest.
Therfore prepare nowe thy memorye redy or yf thou haste any thyng forgotten, call it agayne with thy remembraunce.
wyll do as thou byddest me, therfore saye on Plato and spare not.
THe fyrste entre into our disputation Aristippus, (if be not forgetfull vnlyke to that was wonte to be) was that thou beheldest me in this pore astate and apparaylle, the occasion wherof declared to the in the forme of a story: whiche although it semed to the to be more than in the aunswere of a Philosopher was expediente whiche shulde vse in fewe wordes moche matter and quycke to the pur+pose: yet examinynge diligently euery thyng therin included, it shal well appere vnto the that nothing therof mought haue ben omitted, the wordes whiche we spake before with my profession beinge well ponderid.
Me thinkith thou saiest truly, nowe that haue consyderid euery thynge depely.
But yet Aristippus as doo consyder, me seemeth to that purpose that we go aboute, the argument whiche haue made lacketh yet some what to make hir perfecte.
AR. Trowist thou so? In good faythe doo not perceyue hir, for as me semith thou haste touchid euery thynge hansomely.
But Aristipp. thou doest remembre that we were both agreed that wisdome is knowlege? AR. Ye that is truth, and so haue herde it alway defyned.
But se whyther that knowlege only maketh one to be cal+lid a wise ma~.
Is not wisdom good? What sayst thou therto? AR. Why thynkest thou that am suche a fole that wyll denye it? PL.
Nowe admytte that a man knewe all that we haue hytherto talked of, concernynge the goodnes and prouidence of god, but in dede he lereth his sencis and affectis haue the rule ouer his soule in his actes abuseth the saide goodnes prouide~ce.
If thou pecyuiddest him to do this woldest thou suppose him to be a good ma~. AR.
Thou woldest say perchance that he were ill bicause that his actes were co~trari to good, but to his knowlege thou woldest take lyttell regarde.
If a man named to be a tilar wolde telle the that thy house were yll tyled, and that the morter was ylle tempred, by reson that the lime was to hote, the holes of the tyles were made to wide for the pinnes, that the lathes were rent in the nayling thou foundest al that he saide to be true: thou woldest suppose him to be a good tylar.
But if co~myng to his own house thou shuldest fynd it neclige~tly couerid by him, his tiles lath so set out of order, that the rayn and snow dyd bete into eueri place, wherby the beames and rafters of the house were decayid and rotten therby all the house in ieoperdy to fal down euery houre: woldest thou calle hym than a good tylar or no? AR. Nay in good fayth, wolde calle him but a prater.
PL. Bycause that wher he ought most, he did not practise his cu~nyng, whiche he had often aua~ted.
Tha~ semeth that knowlege is indiffere~t to good to yll: but although good+nes being in knowlege maketh that knowlege to be good, yet he whiche hath that goodnes is neuer the more good except by the exercise of the same goodnes the thinge that is good apperith in his act.
For that is manifest, and declareth what the ma~ is knowlege is secrete and bryngeth forth no frute but by operatio~.
Wherfore no more tha~ know+lege of goodnesse maketh one to be named a good man, No more doth knowledge of wysedom onely cause any persone to be named a wise ma~.
And that was affirmed bi the in the begynnynge of our communication: where it was agreed that kyng Dionise desyred to see me, to the intent that he moughte beholde, if in my countenaunce, speche, or forme of lyuynge dydde expresse that thynge, wherfore he herde me commended, whiche was nothyng but wysdom.
Than if were a wise man it ought to be declared by operation, whiche is not in man without knowlege pre+cedynge or goynge before wherof procedeth election, whiche lacketh naturally in other beastes.
Wherefore all though wisedome be knowlege, yet by knowledge onely none may be called a wise man, but operation of that whiche is in knowledge called wysedome expressynge the wysedome, maketh the vser or exercisar therof to be iustly named a wyse man.
Now on my faith Plato thou art a wonderfull felow, for by the subtil persuasio~s brought in by induction, whiche forme of arguynge knowe is moste naturalle, thou compellest me to assent alwaye to thy raison.
For now me thinketh that none may be called a wise man, excepte vnto that knowlege, wherin is wysedome, he ioyneth operation: but for what pourpose praye the haste thou brought in nowe this last conclusion? PL. Arte thou so dulle wytted Aristip. that all this whyle thou doest not perceyue hit? Perdie the occasion of all our long raisoning dydde ryse of that that assayed to proue that if were a wyse man in dede myn answere to kynge Dionyse declared me to be so, accordinge to his expectation.
And therfore fyrst as rayson was soughte for wysedom And in our co~munication it appered to be in man onely, and not in beastes: that it was in knowlege of hym selfe and other.
First to know his owne preemine~ce and dignitie ouer al other creatures, hir was remembred that he was of bodye and soule, wherby he was man, and was made to the image similitude of god, and that all other creatures were made onely for him and to his vse principally.
The sayd similitude was expressed to be in the soule as well for that it is visible and immortal as also in vnderstandyng, whereby she hath souerayntie and rule in the bodye, as god hath ouer all vniuersally.
Moreouer that the sences affectes and wylle, be he seruauntes and minystres: whiche if she do kepe in suche obedience and order as she receyued them, she shal euer remayne in authorytie.
But if she lette them to haue more libertie than perteyneth to them, that is to say to delyte in thynges whiche be corruptible, they wyll than conspire and rebelle agayne vnderstandynge, and driue him from the soule than shulde man be transformed frome the image of god vntyl a brute beest beinge gouerned and ruled onely by sensis.
¶The seconde parte of the saide knowlege was opened bi the discription of the goodnes and prouidence of god.
In describynge his goodnes, was declared his powar, his perfection and loue that he hath vnto man as vnto his chylde more tha~ natural.
In settyng out his {pro}uide~ce appered his i~scrutable wise+dome magnificence prudence, poli+cie in his wonderfull order wherin were his creatures in their sondrye degrees hygher or lower, as they dydde participate in goodnes more or lasse.
In the toppe wherof aboue other, Man was sette nexte vnto god, from whom order proceded.
Moreouer by the sayde prouidence hir was declared, that nothynge his place in order shewed to man by vnderstandynge mought be yll vnto hym, but alway profytable, all though to the sences some thynges dydde to be yll and vnprofitable.
And laste of all it was proued in a fewe sentences, that aduersite was sent by god vnto a good ma~, nor iniustly or cruelly, but for a good ion and louyngely as of a good father whiche with an in parable charitie desyryng to aduaunce his sonne to perpetuall ho and dignitie by suche maner of exercise proueth his vertue.
¶Nowe Aristippus reuoluyng all this in thy mynde whiche in a short Epilogation haue endeuoured my selfe to reduce vnto thy reme~brance, Consyder well bothe me and kynge Dionise as we were at that tyme, whan we were togither.
Thou knowest well that from the tyme that was.xx.yeres old alway co~tinued disciple of Socrates, vntyll that he dyed.
Who (as thou knowist) the answere of god determyned to be of al mortall men the wysest.
And that whiche lerned of hym was wysedome: whiche as he euer affirmed was included in these two wordes, Knowe thy selfe.
And by that doctrine (as thou mayste remembre) he abated the presumption of dyuers, whiche supposed them selfe to be excellent wyse men.
Also reuoked many that were dissolute and resolued into vice, and made them to ensue vertue.
And by his exaumple of lyuynge he prouoked men to contemne fortune, and to haue onely vertue in reuerence.
And also therby, laste of all, whan he was iniustely condemned to deth he constantly and ioyful+ly susteyned to haue the mortall body dissolued that the soule mought be at reste and haue her immortal re+warde. whiche exa~ple giuen of hym was the corroboration of al his doctrine and no lasse part of lerning vn+to his scolers, but rather moch more than his ofte~ disputatio~s or lessons.
Imagine Aristippus, that was so studious and industrious aboute the said lerninge that moste curiously (as mought say) superstitiously obseruid euery poynt of the said doctrine.
And that therfore all men in Grece, and also kinge Dionyse had conceyued of me an opinion, that was a wise man.
And that the same kynge sente for me, onely to that intent (as sayde at the begynnynge) to see and here whether were accordinge to his expectation.
¶Consider also on the other parte, that my co~ming into Sicile was nar+ro serue kinge Dionise, or to receyue by hym any co~moditie but onely to augmente wisedome by addition of knowledge.
And that he desired to haue me with him for the cause that before haue rehersid. wherfore it semith that he had nede of that, whi+che by seinge hering of me he trusted to knowe, that is to saye wisedome.
For no man couayteth that thynge, whiche he all redy hath or wherof in his owne opinion he hath no nede.
Now knew partly by co~+mon report partly by thinformatio~ of Dion which is a iuste man an ho+nest that kinge Dionise was a Tyra~t, that is to sai co~men to that dignite bi vsurpacion and violence, and not by iuste succession or lefull election.
Also that he was a ma~ of quicke subtile wit, but therwith he was wonderfull sensuall, vnstable, wandring in sondrye affections.
Delytinge sometyme in voluptuous pleasures, an other tyme in gatheryng of great tresure and rychesse, oftentymes resolued into a bestly rage and vengeable crueltie Aboute the publicke weale of his countraye alwaye remysse, in his owne desyres studious and diligent.
And all this perceyued very well or spake to hym any thynge.
Onely exercised my selfe with the Aristippus, Dion, and other, in suche part of Philosophy as mought induce you vnto the layd knowlege, wherof haue spoken, approuynge alwaye my doctrine with the forme of liuyng by the example of my maister Socrates: Abydynge oportunitie to speake, which mought ryse of some speciall demande of kyng Dionise.
In the meane time to suche lyte questions and problemes as he dyd pourpose, concernynge naturall causes Rhetorike or poetry or of the dueties and maners of priuate persons resolued them so as he helde hym contented and delyted not a lytell in the forme of my raysonyng.
At the laste (as haue tolde to the at the begynnynge) he required me to declare openly, the state and preeminence of a kynge whiche ruled ouer other.
Therat reioyced, wenyng to haue founde the oportunitie to speake that so longe loked for.
And than forthe with consydered that the sentence, whiche shulde pronounce, shulde eyther co~mende and approue me for a wyse man as was supposed to be: or els co~de~ne that opinion that kyng Dionise and other had of me as false and vntru, declarynge my selfe vnworthy to haue it.
remembred also, that lyke as ignorance and knowlege or ylle and good maye neuer accorde: no more may falsehoode and truthe be ioyned in one.
And what so euer appereth other wyse than it is in dede, it is other tha~ truthe: and that whiche is not truthe muste nedes be falshod.
More ouer as truthe is good so falshod is yl. wherfore what so euer is other tha~ truthe, can nat be in a wise man, who by the consent of al me~ is good.
Hauing styl in my mind this co~sideratio~ described a kinge, not {per}cha~ce as he wold haue had me but as truth the trust that he had i~ me co~pelled me.
Therfore bi the said knowlege, of the which we so longe haue disputed set out expressed suche a man, in whom the soule had intiere ful auctorite ouer the sensis, alway kept the affectis in due rule obedie~ce, folowyng only the counsayle of Vndersta~ding, by that gouernaunce was moste like vnto god.
This man called a kyng although he had no more in his possession tha~ had Crates the Theban.
And if that suche one were by the free consent of the people chosen or receyued to be a principal ruler and gouernour gouerning the~ in like maner as he doth him selfe, tha~ is he a gret king or Em+perour to be had in reuerence ho+nor aboue any mortal ma~, sauyng to god that excelle~t honor, that is due to the creator first cause of al thi~g.
Not only for the preemine~ce giue~ vn+to him bi a co~mun co~sent but also for as moch as by his knowlege exa~ple authorite the people shal dayly receiue of him an inco~parable profite benefit being allured prouoked by him to set their soules in the sayd astate authorite, as they mai also be ki~ges, be euer like vnto god.
More ouer this kynge by that knowledge that he hath of hym self, he also kno+weth other men: for by the operatio~ whiche procedeth of their affectes he perceyueth howe farre they be re+moued from their right place in the lyne of order that is to say, leauyng knowlege and rayson wherby they were in the highest toppe of the lyne they descende to the places of brute beastes by participatyng with them in sensuall appetites.
And than wyll he endeuour hym selfe by all good meanes to restore them agayne (if he maye) to theyr propre place in Ordre.
¶Also suche a kynge stablysshed in the sayde knowledge, can neuer be deceyued by his moste pernicious or mischeuous ennemyes whiche be flatterers and glosers, by whome princis be deuoured alyue and their soules vtterly consumed with moste mortall pestilence, wherwith their cou~treis and people be also in perile to be loste destroyed.
For as sone as either in their cou~sailes or in their praises dispreises or in their owne order of liuing he by the said know+lege perceyueth and noteth to what affectis they be i~clined, he awaytith them and by auoydinge their companie eskapeth their snares.
¶Finally to the intente that the excellencie of suche a kynge shulde be more euident like as dyd sette out while ere knowlege by Ignoraunce (for euery thinge sheweth moste per+fectly, and after the co~mon prouerbe of marchantis, best to the sale, wha~ is ioyned or co~pared with his beganne to describe a tyra~t, which in euery thing, (as might by rule repugneth and is moste vnlike vnto the sayde kynge whose rulith not but excludinge from r, Knowlege and Raison, suffreth selfe to be gouerned bi the sensis obeyeng to the folishe affectis le+th them leade hir out of hir highe in the lyne of Order, i~to a more degree, and to be made equal or to beastis, and to lose the figure or image of God wheri~ she was and by that transformatio~ she loseth also Vnderstandynge soo that a Tyraunt, is wyllyngly taken in the sayde snares, whiche a kynge doeth escape, and perceyuethe not that he is deceiued, vntyll he sensibly feleth some greuous damage.
And if any man experte in the sayde knowlege of a syncere loue that he bereth towarde hym, wolde warne hym of the sayd snares, and perchaunce shewe them vnto hym, as they be layde: yet knowledge and Rayson the two eyen of the soule, beinge put oute with affections, And Vnderstandynge hir chiefe counsailour beinge excluded, the man gyueth no cre+dence, but rebukyng perchaunce his mooste assured frende that warned suffreth gladly hym selfe to be taken in the snare of Hipocrisye or Dissimulation, where for lacke of libertie he shalbe constrained to abide all daungers, whiche moughte vnto hym.
And he that is suche one howe poore so euer he be, he is a Tyraunt, and if he haue rule ouer other the more is he vnlyke vnto god, sens by god man is made and preserued, by crueltie and ylle exaumple manne bothe in bodye and soule is distroyed.
¶This description kynge Dionyse mought not abyde to here, but thinkynge the tyme loste that hadde spente for his profyte, sayde that these were but wordes of ydell dotardes wherby hir semeth that he vnderstode not my wordes for if he hadde, he wolde haue thanked me, for declarynge that thynge so playnly vnto hym, which he had so longe desyred to here that is to say wysedom which (as we two be agreed) consysteth in knowledge.
Or elles he required some acte of me to be whiche agreinge with my wordes shulde approue me to be a wise ma~, acording to his first opinio~.
Howe sayst thou, was it not for one of these causes, that he spake those wordes vnto me? AR. Yes in good faith, suppose that veryly.
We were agreed while ere, that he had nede of me, whanne he sent for me, and therfore he desyred to se me and to speake with me: but whan was with hym although endeuored my selfe to satisfy hym of that which he had nede of so moch desi+red yet if he did not vndersta~d what sayd, in dede my wordes were in
put case Aristippus that one of the philosophers of Inde or of other countrayes speakynge no greke had come vnto him whom he wold haue required by an interpretour to haue taught hym wysedome, howe shulde he haue instructed kynge Dionise to haue satisfied his gentyl desyre? AR. Howe els but by an Interpretour.
What yf zeno Eleates after that he had byt of his owne tongue, and spyt it in the face of the tyrant that tourmented him, had bene sente for to kynge Dionise, whom he wolde haue desyred to teche hym wysedome, howe shulde zeno whiche lacked his tongue, satisfie the request of so good a prince and so well disposed? AR.
knowe not howe, except it shulde be by signes and tokens.
Whiche were a diffuse way to instruct a man in so high lernynge.
Yet than perchance, he shuld also haue nede of an interpretoure, that knewe his tokens, leste kynge Dionyse, whiche had not bene vsed vnto them, shulde not vnderstonde what he ment by them.
But supposest thou Aristip. that any man can better i~terprete an other ma~s sente~ce eyther spoken in a strange language, or signified by tokens, than coulde expounde myne owne intent or meanynge: AR. Nay surely.
For euery wise ma~ is of his owne sentence the beste expositour.
And if it be expouned sufficiently in a few wordis, it is the more commendable.
PL. Mought haue vsed any playner and shorter waye than in fewer wordes than king Dionise reproued me with to remembre that in his owne wordis he mought deprehende that thing that he soughte for sens that whiche spake before was in his owne language, and therfore he vnderstode the wordes sufficiently? and if there were ani thing which he vnderstode not, it was in the sentence.
In the definition of a kynge instructed hym howe he mought be in the hygheste dignitie nexte vnto god and also in mooste perfecte suretie, whiche was no smalle benefite of so poore a persone as am to gyue to a prince.
Wherfore if the eyen of kynge Dionyse soule, Knowledge and Rayson, had not ben out, he shulde sone haue perceiued the sayd benefite, and like a noble manne haue gyuen to me thankes, whiche well deserued.
And in the description of a Tyraunt warned hym of al dangers wherby he mought lose the sayd dignitie.
In the which two declaratio~s was holly comprehended all that for the whiche he so moch desyred to se me.
And all this whyle knewe not, but that he had ben a good manne, bycause he desyred to knowe that whiche thou haste granted is good, that is to saye wysedome.
Nowe whan he gaue not to me condigne tha~kes, as my benefite deserued, but acco~pted me to haue be~ idle, whiles instructed him, than it semed that Vndersta~ding was abse~t fled from the soule, that he rulid not as a ki~g but that he was rulid bi his affectio~s: Wherfore his ingratitude declared his wordes to sauour of tira~ny: whi+che rehersed vnto him to thintent that he perceyuynge by my wordes in what perylle he was in mought by the remembrynge of my fyrste instruction concernyng a kyng, reuoke vnderstandynge, and subduynge the affectes, be restored vnto his dignitie.
Howe sayste thou, consyderynge well all that, whiche is before sayde, were my wordes ylle as they were spoken? AR. Nay, as thou haste declared them, but yet me semeth they were very sharpe.
PL. wotest thou what makethe the to thynke so? bycause they were shorte.
But thou muste consider, that he that lacketh, in that he doeth lacke he is inferior to him of whom he desireth it wher+fore in as moche as kyng Dionyse to haue benefite of me, became my herer he was inferior vnto me.
And therfore respecte ought to be alway hadde to that, whervnto the raison extendeth, and nat to the astate of the persone that hereth.
Yet did it with suche a tempera~ce that if he had not bene a Tyraunt in dede he wolde neuer haue bene discontented.
For dyd not calle hym a tyrant or reproched him of any tyranny: But only sayd that his wordes sauored of tyranny.
¶I put the case thou gauest to me wyne oute of a vessell and whan had dronke of it, wolde say that it had a sent of mustynes it argueth not that the vessell in musty.
For per+chance within fyue or sixe days that sent wyll be gone, the wyne wyll drynke clene and gentilly.
And therfore suppose for my wordes thou woldest not be angry.
What if that kynge Dionise had desired me to teche hym Rhetorike: And whan herde hym declame, or saw his writyng, If fyndinge any faute in his wordes wolde warne hym in this wyse.
Syr your wordes do fauour of to moche arrogance, or that they sauored of sewet and payntinge, or be lyke vnto apples of the deed so which be delicate in colour without but within ther is nothing but coles and powder vnsauery.
Reuokynge hym therby to suche rules as had before radde vnto hym, wherby yf he wold be diligent, he shuld bringe the forme of speakynge and writing into a perfection.
Supposist thou that this maner of instruction shulde prouoke kynge Dionyse to be angry with me? ARISTIPPVS.
Than hath he not so sharpe a wytte as thou haste supposed, sens he perceyuethe not, howe moche the lernynge of wysedome, excedeth the lernynge of Rhethorike.
And therfore he that techeth wysdom ought to be of a greater auctoritie, than he which techeth Rhetorike.
And therfore sens thou doest co~fesse that king Dionyse in lernyng Rhetorike wold take in good worth what so euer wolde say, in correctyng his wordes concernynge eloquence: Howe moche more ought he thanne to take in good {per}te those wordis that spake, in correctynge his wordes, wherby he semed to refuse wysdom whiche a lytle before he so moche couaited to here declarid? And one thi~g mought haue co~te~ted him: that al that had spoke~ was at his desire for his co~modite.
Where if had purposed to haue gotten any thinge by hym, my wytte was not so sengle, but that knewe howe to speke wordes as well as thou, whiche shulde delyte hym.
But whan he demed me to be a wyse man, he with that opinion bounde me that coude not deceiue hym.
And if thou forborne a day, two, or thre, vntill his fume had ben passed, and that he had vsed with the some familiaritie: peraduenture thi wordes wold haue ben more easely take~, and thervnto thou shuldist haue fou~den more oportunitie.
But take one thynge with the Aristippus, In the office of a wise man, that worde (Peraduenture) is neuer herde spoken: No more than in the ende of his workes these wordes, Had wist.
For he hath alwey the thre times in reme~brance, Time present, tyme passed, and time to come.
And referringe all thing to necessarie causes, or (as sayde longe a gone) vnto Prouidence reputeth nothing to Fortune.
Therfore the deferringe of tyme shulde haue nothinge auayled but rather shulde haue ben the cause of moche damage.
Thou hast graunted al redy, that kynge Dionyse desired to se me, to the intent that in beholding and hering me he mought perceiue, whether were a wise ma~ or no: and than desiring me to describe vnto hym the excellencie of a kinge, supposist not thou that he made that requeste vnto me for some laudable purpose? ARI.
PL. Thynkynge that by no question he mought either proue me more soner to be a wise ma~ or els that he might lerne more wisedome.
PL. Thou hast not denied hitherto, but that wisedome, which kinge Di+onyse supposed to be in me is in the knowledge that haue declared: what remained than to proue me to be a wise man? doest not thou reme~bre that we were agreed while ere that hir was operation? AR. Yes mary do I. PL.
And that operation was parte of that whiche kyng Dionyse desyred to knowe, and not onely parte but also the principalle portion.
If hadde holde my pecae, and sayde nothynge, after that kynge Dyonyse hadde spoken what shulde haue insued of all myne instruction? AR.
For he wolde haue lette the departe without thank or damage, and that whi+che thou haddest spoken shuld haue bene lyghtly forgotten.
And than his wordes hadde bene verefyed that my wordes hadde ben ydelly spoken.
But howe sayst thou supposeste thou that he sayde trewely? ARIST.
For me semeth that thy description of a kynge was wonderful true and necessarye, and also therin was the knowledge, wherof thou haste treated compendiously and playnely declared.
And me thinketh that the wordis that kynge Dionise spake, besemed not a kyng, but were moch rather the wordes of one that lacked that knowledge, wherin is wysdome.
Nowe am glad Aristippus, that fynde in the so moche conformitie in raison.
Tha~ sens these vngentyll wordes of kyng Dionise besemed not a kyng to speke it appereth that they besemed hym that was contrary vnto a king whi+che is a Tyrant.
And being the wor+des of one that lacked knowlege it accordethe also that they were the wordes of one that was ignoraunt and Ignoraunce is mooste contrarye to wysedome and as haue saide tra~sformeth a man into a beast or a monstre.
But what ignorance is it that thou supposiste by the sayde wordes was declared to be in kinge Dionise? AR. what other but that ignora~ce, wherby he knewe nat him selfe.
And what supposist thou that he was wha~ he spake (as thou hast grantid) wordes that be semed a Tyrant? ARIS. what els but as thou hast rehersed.
PL. what a Ty+rant Aristippus? thou spekest nowe more playnely than dyd.
God for bede that shulde suffre so gentyll a prince to be transformed in to suche a monstre if coude helpe him.
But praye the whiche benefite woldist thou preferre either that whiche is giuen or employd furthwith or that whiche is lenger differred? ARIS. what question is that? That kindenesse or benefite that is most prompt or sonist employed, is to be chieffely
Than if furthwith as sone as perceyued the transformation of gentyll kynge Dionyse, endeuored my selfe to make hym to knowe by his owne wordes what he was, whereby if he wolde, he mought by the expellynge of Ignorance haue ben not only restored vnto the forme of a man: but also haue bene made a great Emperour by the well vsynge of his dignitie.
Supposest not thou that dydde as it be came me? and for that benefite soo soone offred, was not worthy a great gramercy? AR. Yes if he wold haue so taken it.
But or thou camest to hym, thou kneweste by credible reporte, that he was obstinately inclyned to all vicious affections and therwith impatient and cruel, wher+fore whanne thou dyddest perceyue that he contemned thi doctrine, thou shuldest than haue ceassed and not haue offred thy selfe to peryle without hope of benefite.
That aduantage onely thou hast of me Aristippus: for thou that doest professe pleasure, moughtest haue done so lefully, but that haue professed wise+dome vertue mought by no menes haue done it.
For if hadde not re vnto hym, hadde lefte that declared, whiche he required to whiche by his owne wor, as by an example in other artis or seces was playnly set out and expressed.
And like wise as knewe that he was impacient and cruell.
So more certeynely knewe that he had no power to indamage my soule, by whose operation was called a wyle man.
And if shulde haue holden my peace than, it shuld haue ben for feare of damage, whiche mought happen by his impacience and crueltie towarde my body, than shulde haue proued my selfe to haue ben a foole and no wyse ma~ that had not holden my peace at the begynnynge and thanne shulde kynge Dionise haue founde no cause to haue taken displeasure.
But sens he desyred to know, if were a wise manne, and for that opinion that he had in me he fauored me, and also thou doest confesse that my description of a kynge by his definition and also by comparyng hym to his contrarye conteyned that knowledge, wherin is wysedome: nowe remained nothyng but operation to proue me to be a wyse man.
Wherfore co~temnynge or lyttell regardynge that vayne feare, to bryng kinge Dionise to knowlege, whiche he desyred declared that my mynde was not subiecte to corporall passions, and consequently not to sensuall affections, which mought haue incensed or stered me to speake that thynge that mought haue pleased kyng Dionyse appetite, whiche was corrupte and vicious, hopyng to haue had therby preferment and singuler fauour: and herein began the operation whiche agreed with my sayde knowledge.
And afterwarde by takyng libertie from me, and makyng me a slaue, he more declared wordis to be true, and therby had the larger example, wherby he mought the better haue knowen hym selfe.
And after whan he herde (as doubt not but that he hath) howe constantly contemned the peryle that was in of my lyfe at Egina: he mought well perceyue that operation in pacience to agree with my knowlege.
And therby he had fully all that knowledge of me, wherfore he desired to se me. where contrarywise, if shuld haue holde~ my peace, as well my commynge to kynge Dionise had ben frustrate and vayne, and his gentylle desyre had ben vnsatisfied, as also by my silence beinge thought (as raison was that shulde be) to be subdued eyther with fere or affectio~: shuld seme to condemne min owne doctrine, wher+fore shuld be demid vnworthi that good opinio~, that kyng Dionise had of me.
AR. Wel Plato in such experience of wysdome wyl not folow the.
PL. Therfore whan any aduersitie shall happen vnto the, as suppose thou haste not fortune locked faste in a no more than hadde Cresus the riche kynge of Lidia for all that he thought that all goddes and men were his frendes, and yet was he openly bourned by Cyrus, whom he litle fered, Thou shalt fele both aduersitie grefe, also make thy soule subiecte vnto thy sences, wherof what doth folow, thou dost yet remembre what we haue alredy discussed.
Where or any other by the said knowlege operation thervnto ioyned, shalbe so armed agayn aduersitie, that what so euer the body feleth, yet the very man which is the soule fealeth no disease or as mought say is neuer inquieted, but is euer intiere and in his true propor+tion and figure: that is to say like vn+to god.
And also shall haue the price that he hath deserued, by vanquysshynge of his aduersarye, that is to saye corporall disease or aduersitie.

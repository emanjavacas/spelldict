to all that desire to live godly in christ jesus

it is not unknown to very many of gods people in this nation with what entire affection and happy success the pious authour of these meditations now asleep in jesus laid out himself in the service of the gospel
divers of you sate somtimes under the shadow of his ministry with great delight
and of those who had not the enjoyment of him but in more removed distances what serious eye ever read as it ought that truly incomparable piece the deserted souls case and cure and was not thereby enlightned startled humbled lifted up nearer to god or what good heart for that end that it might be better duly perused his later piece of faith and sight but it was by increased faith and its just appendages more fitted for sight the holy spirit was his spring and plentiful emanations from thence filled his cistern and made him free to communication
he dwelt in the presence of christ so was at home in heavenly negotiationsÂ·

and the content that he had there made him delight to stand still between christ and his people to receive and give though he gave away his own life withall
and when he perceived the shadow of the evening to be stretched forth upon him they did nothing to him but only provoke him to make more haste in the finishing of his work
those holy tapers which receive their light from the golden lamp of the sanctuary shine and burn down to the socket and are burning and shining lights thereto

in his wearinesses and weaknesses grown constant in his later time when the effects of his pains made strong sollicitations to desist it was an expression which he often used with pleasance to his friends yet praying and preaching is too good work to be weary of
in the continuance of it he poured forth himself as a to christ upon the service of his saints and so passed to eternal life through the best forms of death
and indeed that way as is roported of moses god doth kiss away the souls of his servants

but that he might prevent death he took much pains with his own pen besides constant expence of mony for the assistance of another that his love in permanent testimonies might his life and the first neglects of his hearers
he knew well how precious discourses are lost to the inconsiderate part of

men and women who either do not give due heed while a sermon is preached and so take it not into their understandings and hearts or else cannot remember it having heard it but once
of his good will to such he hath left many evidences which will be produced if god pleases as soon as time health and other work will give leave to make up the chasin's and mend other errours of the writer in those copies which were taken from the pulpit and were not corrected by himselfe for the present it was judged meet to print these three small tracts

the first touching spiritual remembrance of god as a most seasonable praelibation this being a time when a careless devil hath after too eminent a manner possessed a multitude of professours and many christians have recklesly lost jesus christ in the crowd of worldly affections designes diversions
the aim of this is to quicken all that have the root of eternal life in them to more frequent addresses of soul to god and to rivet them in contentful abode and holy reposes in him
the second is an excellent discovery of the saints interest in god in which all holy souls may see how happy they are or may be in god their god

the third holds forth gods interest in us by which as by a true glass we may learn to

reflect upon god all his goodness and love contained in the former treatise if it be also revealed in our hearts and so god will be to us as he is to all true christians the beginning and end of our life

all which discourses the godly reader will find enrich'd with many clear descriptions of heavenly truths many rational considerations which in way of exhortation do strike fitly and weightily upon those capable principles which god hath put into the soul as ears for him to take hold of both with very lovely representations and right dreadful terrours and as he goes up and down he will meet methodicall and sure directions like benigne guides telling the way of happy life to all the children of wisdom and truth
so you have a short account of what you may find in these papers

be their patronage the living influence of the spirit who only is able to make these and all other tendencies effectual to their desirable ends and who can protect them from unprofitable reading and forgetful neglects which are the wrongful abuses and unjust imprisonment of the most useful truths
who in this matter do only carry the staff of elisha which he hath left behind do and shall pray that it may not only be laid upon the child which is ready to dye

but that this spirit would joyn himself to it and make it the ministration of life even the beauty and bands of god upon the spirits of his own
that the misplaced eye of some reader may be set right and then fixed that some heart may be undeceived
and oh that the time were come when no child of god would write his name in the earth which to do is to be cursed and to make the divels sport
alas whil'st we through their false representations and cozening impulses sell our comfort our life our soul for cheap things at easie rates do they not laugh do they not insult though it is a poor sport and proper only to divels to rejoyce in the follies and sorrows of humanity
the lord jesus who came to break the power of spiritual wickednesses drive them out of the souls of men and women and if they must have leave to enter any where let it be onely into swine
the lord appear more to the inhabitants of this world that they may see the glory of truth and be transformed into its image delivered into the spirit and life of truth and out of the power of detaining falshoods and seducing vanities the chains of evil spirits
then the capacity of the children of men so empty hungry and sore distressed though some are sensless and therefore perceive it not will be filled with god
then a strand will be set to that deplorable forgetfulness of god which hath swell'd to

such unreasonable heights that it hath left the tops of very few mountains discernable above it
then those which have pure minds will be stirred up to run after their lord the children of the kingdom will enjoy more of the promises and by them partake of a divine nature in greater measures inherit more of the holy land trade in true life be tyed in heavenly galleries having their eyes set continually upon christ who with his will take away their hearts and keep them with himself and be a covering of the eyes to them from all false ones for ever
have no more to adde but the continuance of these wishes and prayers humbly begging a remembrance also in yours for

psal
mine eyes are ever towards the lord

chap


eyes of saints set upon god in what sence ever and how many ways

this psalm is a psalm of speciall excellency and hath this mark on it that as some others its form'd in verses of it according to the hebrew alphabet
david was a man of a heavenly spirit and truly he breaths much life in every word
this psalm is a prayer david complains of

enemies good men shal never want them but this is their advantage that as the world wil be sure to be their enemie so god wil be more sure to be their friend
he had one to go to and could tel him how it was with him and how men dealt with him and that's but a bad business to the world but its a great relief to the spirits of the saints that they can go to god and speak their hearts
and in his prayer observe his spirit he doth not after the manner of the world breathe out affections moved meerly from the smart of the stroke without sense of the cause but cries out more of his sin then of his suffering and speaks more against himself then against his enemies and begs more that he might walk in the sight of gods countenance and have his favor then to be delivered from his enemies
and as all prayer the more spiritual the more argumentative it is prayer that is full of affection is full of arguments so this
but while david was drawing down mercy upon himself he was catcht up love fires in prayer
his faith is quickened in prayer and then love's inflam'd in the midst of his prayer he breaks out and tells god in the words of the text that his eyes were ever towards him while he was begging

the eye of god toward him he tells god mine eyes are ever towards the lord

ever you cannot understand that actually and uncessantly his thoughts and heart were towards god and his mind taken up with him for by the necessity of this life and the law of it he was sometimes to be taken up with other things but when he says mine eyes are ever towards the lord he means these three things

that the disposition of his soul was such that he could be always looking upon god he could wish that when he is departed out of himself and got up that he might never come down more and never have any other work in the world but this to behold god
thus always is taken in the scriptures
in acts
cornelius is said to pray that is he had a disposition his heart was ready to pray always
acts
it's said of the jews they were and to resist the holy ghost this was their temper like a stone that resists the hand of the workman takes in no impression but is wholly shut up to it self


when he saith mine eyes are always towards the lord he means this that upon all occasions in every condition in all places his eyes were towards god
in

luke
christ teacheth to watch and pray always that is upon all occasions when ever prayer is called for watch to see the season and have your hearts open making mention of you always in my prayer saith the apostle rom
and not seldom elsewhere that is as have occasion do intercede for you as pray for my self its my dayly work so in psal
every day will praise thee
psal
every day will bless thee so here mine eyes are ever towards the lord that is it's my every days work


mine eyes are toward the lord that is continually it is not only my ordinary work and dayly course but it's a work that shall last while live a work for life
sam

david saith concerning mephibosheth he shall eat bread at my table that is while he lives he shall sit at my table and in psal
while live he speaks in the sence of the text will praise thee
so that now here you have the temper and practise of a godly man his eyes are ever toward the lord
the text holds forth these three things to us

what it is upon which the eyes of saints are set upon what they are terminated upon god


their great diligence and assiduity

in this work of eying god


the continuance of it always

eying of god in scripture expression as it's taken in a large sence it's put for the mind of man and not only for the mind but for the heart eying seeing and looking signifies all manner of affections


shall give you that sence only that is most comprehensive as full and large as either the propriety of this phrase or any scripture of like expression will reach to
there is an eying of god in these six ways

you shall see these all cleared in their order


in way of meditation

in way of affection

in way of observation

in way of expectation

in way of supplication

in way of intention

chap
ii

the way of eying god in heavenly meditation thoughts setled upon god include much choyce and pleasantness

first eying of god is meditating thinking contemplating on god jerem

lift up thine eyes to the high places and see where thou hast not been lien

with
lift up thine eyes the meaning is not that they should so much or onely exercise the eyes of their bodies but of their mindes that they should consider and think well of this how greatly they sinned against god
prov
then saw and considered well looked upon it and received instruction speaking of the field of the sluggard saw that is diligently weighed and viewed it and considered it well the word in the original is set my heart to it and made it my work to think of the matter so that this eying of god is thinking and minding of him meditating upon him
hebr
looking to jesus
the apostle means consider him as he speaks in chap
consider the high priest of our profession looking to jesus

as one looks to his pattern which he doth with all diligence or as one looks to his refuge hope and help all which import a solemn and serious employment of the minde about the thing
exod
it is said when moses grew old he went out to see his brethren he looked on their burdens he did not onely come near and cast an eye upon them that's not the meaning of it but he weighed and considered their condition therefore it's rendered by the septuagint by a word that signifies consideration

he considered their labor and travel
psal

look upon mine affliction saith david that is consider it
then to eye god is to consider him will express this duty in these few words it's a course of voluntary and holy turning and holding of the minde upon god
i'l a little open this in these three things

first this eying of god is not onely a converting and pointing of the minde toward god

but the abiding and staying of the minde with god it's not some few and fleeting thoughts that are the discharge of this work but thoughts resting dwelling fixing and staying upon god
the truth is there is a mighty rouling in the mindes and thoughts of men their thoughts fly up and down like dust in the wind and some of these may light sometimes upon god but they vanish and abide not these kinde of visions may consist with the greatest forgetfulness of god
god hath his way open every where and even they that live in the greatest unmindfulness of him have their hearts and mindes open for him to pass in and through at pleasure
god hath his way through the spirits of the worst men but he stays not there that's a favor promised to some onely
joh
if any man love me
we will come

and make our abode with him he comes to many but stays not he is in their eye but passeth away so that many have occasion to take up the prophets complaint in another case jer
thou hope of israel the saviour thereof in time of trouble why shouldst thou be as a stranger and as a wayfaring man that turneth in but for a night thus god deals with most in the world he is as a stranger to them as one in a strange country is there for his business converseth with none but his friends passeth by all the rest as so many strangers so god is a stranger in the world onely he knows some few he findes out his friends and passeth by all others
as a wayfaring man

a traveller comes to a place at night and mindes his rest

when the night is gone he is gone so saith the prophet why art thou as a wayfaring man that tarryest for a night and art gone in the morning thus god deals with most he hath indeed his accesses to them but he hath likewise his recesses from them he is in their eye sometimes but afterwards hides himself and is in darkness again that men cannot see him
look to it therefore it's not a discharge of this work when you have some transient thoughts of god when you throw a thought upon him then which nothing

is more fluent and vanishing being the usual emblem of greatest and most speedy fading vanity
how would you take it that the childe of your own bowels should only give you a look sometimes and be gone and not live in your presence minding of god is another manner of business then many are aware of
it's a thinking with thought upon thought a reiteration and multiplication of the thoughts of the minde upon god

so the scripture expresseth it returned and beheld vanity under the sun eccles

and in chap

considered all my works and in the next verse returned to see he look'd upon and considered his works and he returned to behold them

the force of that expression in the hebrew is this he renewed his work and consider'd again he thought on them before but now he returned to think he renewed his thoughts upon the matter and took a new view of it
indeed when the understanding works seriously it will fetch things into sight and not onely so but holds them there and fastens upon them and when they are gone will fetch them back again lam

my soul hath them still in remembrance my soul in remembering doth remember them that is such a calling to minde as is exprest in the

next verse this recalled to minde or as the word is in the original

and in the margin this made return to my heart things are apt to be gone with most men they are apt to lose the sight of god but he did recall again the thoughts that were vanisht and sunk
this then is one thing that belongs to the work that eying of god is not onely a turning of the minde towards god and setting it upon god but a fastening and holding it towards him


minding of god is a willing work the will is in it there be many thoughts fly at random they get out of the mind but are not sent out the mind of a man is a most profuse thing and nothing in the world spreadeth it self into so many actings as the mind doth the sun is not so full of beams as the mind is full of thoughts which spreads it self more then a thousand suns
but these acts of the mind which flow forth as bees from their hive are not this work but when the mind is sent out upon this errand the heart putting forth the understanding upon advice and makes it mind god when the heart puts the mind upon the wing to fly upwards within the vail to see him that fits upon the throne this is somewhat

and it's a chearful minding of god a

man is pleased in it when he is himself
it's good for me to draw near to thee psal
ult good how good better then perfume my meditation of him shall be sweet psal
my meditation

or my word of thee is sweet it signifies a word secretly spoken the heart speaks of god and those words are musick in the soul the word imports a sweetness with mixture like compound spices or many flowers such a sweetness this thought of god yields to him whose heart is towards him every thought is pleasant and the whole working of the mind makes up a sweet delight
again it's better then wine cant
we remember his love more then wine there is more content in contemplating on god more refreshing to the spirit then wine gives to the body
psal
my soul is filled as with marrow and fatness when or if remember thee upon my bed and meditate on thee in the night watches when do this am as one satisfied with marrow and fatness
psal
david tells you there is a preciousness in the thoughts of god

that word signifies precious in every sence look in what kind soever you account a thing precious so precious are the thoughts of god to a man whose heart is in a right frame
some thoughts are driven out toward

god as a messenger sent and driven out upon an unwelcome message in a way and to a person whom he loves not many cast an eye sometime upon god because they think they must not always live in forgetfulness of him they do it as a duty not a refreshment to them as a work not wages because they must do it not because they love it
yet by some men god will be thought on though they would not the devils cannot forget god god hath made such a stamp of himself upon their natures that they cannot forget him that's their unhappiness they wish they could be out of gods sight and god out of theirs and if it could be their misery would be the less
so god will be in the eyes of some men that they cannot cast him out of their thoughts but the impression of god fastens and abides upon their souls so the sight of god followed judas to a continual amazement and distraction of his mind
but the more a man that is right finds a conjunction of god and his mind the more sweet it is to him he reckons this like the gate of heaven such a day is as one of the days of heaven when the soul is thus taken with god it loves every glance of god the more it sees the more it loves abraham

saw my day afar off and was glad

or highly rejoyced joh
this work then of eying and minding of god is a willing work not a work whereto the heart is drawn and driven and wherein it hath no content but such a work that is both work and wages

chap
iii

holy thoughts of god are mixed with awful love leave deep impressions transform the spirit and are the trade of good souls

it's not only a serious setling of the mind toward and upon god but a pointing and fastening of the mind upon him holy in the manner and holy in the end of it


in the manner not like the bold practise of men that know not god who cast an eye upon him with as little regard as upon a post or pillar this minding of god must be according to the nature of god
you cannot look upon a friend a stranger and a prince with one and the same eye you cannot look upon god as he is god but you will love him nor as powerfl but you will fear him nor as he is excellent

but you will admire him
these things will work with you either in a way of assimilation or delectation or admiration


holy in the end of it a man may do think much of god and yet do no work of holiness there is a meditation of god that we may call the meditation of a student who studies god as he studies other things by which means he heaps together many notions concerning god but hath no impression of the holiness of god upon his heart but is a stranger to god and hath no communion with him
but this work is holy in the end of it a man eyes god that he may have more of god he that minds god truly hunts and seeks after something of god he would have more of his presence light favor and image he is seeking the beloved of his soul and the love of his beloved therefore would fain be near him and looks toward him that he may receive that from him which his soul so much prizeth he minds god and as one that desires to present as an offering to him those fruits of his love which by the love of god are begotten in his heart so that this work is holy


this minding of god is a work of course not to be done now and then and

layd down again but it's the trade of that man that doth it right it is his every days work and his constant employment to be mindful of god
david describes the good man thus psal

his meditation is in the law of the lord day and night
psal
when awake am still with thee
the mind may slip from god and sometime be taken up with other things but cannot be long kept from him because god is its center and it's natural for a holy mind to move toward god as for a needle touch'd with a to point toward the north pole
psal
have set the lord alway before me this was the practise of christ our head acts
it's applyed to him though spoken by david as the type
you and may suspect our hearts if there be an elongation of our minds from god if our minds be scattered up and down the world if our business be not with him we have reason to look sadly upon our selves for where god hath no place with us wee have none with him
a good man must be with god he hath many things puts him upon it and inclines him to it he wants much and therefore cannot forbear
can a man forget to drink that is athirst can a man forget to eat his meat that is hungry certainly when david

psal
saith he forgot to eat his bread sorrow had taken away his stomack that he found not the want of his meat but a man that feels his want cannot forget it neither can a man forget god that lives in the sensible want of god his soul is still breathing after god
love will send out a mans thoughts and not suffer a man to live at home but to be where it is best of all to be
can a bridegroom forget his bride or a bride her attire jerem

men cannot forget what they love
can a mother forget her childe isai
and can a man forget god that loves god there's a necessity that a man should be minding what he loves he will send his understanding on errands to heaven that it may bring him matter of delight from the visions of god to refresh his soul and not onely so but christ awakens the heart and calls it forth
indeed were it left to us should we have no more and meditations of god then our own spirits bring forth it would be little or none but christ calls to the spirits of his people as he called to john come up hither and see he knocks at the door that we may open and go forth with him the king led me into his wine celler cant
she was there but how came she in the king

led me
christ will not be long from his if their hearts come not up to him he will come into them and if he be there all is taken up with attending upon him as you may see abundantly by experience
though the heart stands still like a clock when the plummets are off and the wheels move not yet when christ comes in he puts all into motion
if a loadstone be cast among many needles though they did he still yet now how do they all move and hang about it so all the affections run towards him and the thoughts go out like motes in the sun the mind is at work hard
the presence of christ not only excites the mind but contracts it and makes the working of the mind more strong
it's reported of the flower de luce that when the sun goes down it opens and scatters it self abroad but when the sun appears it shuts and contracts it self there is in the presence of christ such a contracting of the heart towards himself
mary when she saw christ though her mind were scattered before and about the sepulchre yet now concenters in christ
a man that loves god cannot live in a course of forgetfulness of god either want brings him or love constrains him or christ draws him here cannot be a lusting alienation of

mind in those that belong to god

chap
iv

disconformity to the forementioned principles a great fault in christians the discovery of it slumbering eyes and wandering hearts

having spoken something to the opening of the thing shall now endevor that you and may lay our selves to this pattern and compare our selves with this rule
do you thus mind god let me ask you where your eyes are the truth is the eyes of the whole world are misplaced all the world either wholly dwell out of god or extreamly wander from god all sorts of men are extreamly guilty of notorious forgetfulness of god and of this god complains and that often and that not only in reference to the dead and dark part of the world who have eyes and see not but are like images but with respect to his own my people my people have forgotten me days without number

negligently have they suffered me to be out of their minds and that for a long time
my work now shall be to lay before

you the fault and the causes of it
the fault with respect to the godly and ungodly that both may see how guilty they stand and may see whence it is that their understandings are so alienated and estranged from god

as for the godly their frequent excursions from god their inordinate affections to the world their sad dejections of spirit their many withdrawings and a world of these are too clear and deplorable demonstrations that their eyes are not always upon god
the fault i'le express in these four things


in not sending out the understanding toward god not pointing of the mind towards its maker the mind of man is a nimble thing nothing is of that agility it's the swiftest creature god hath made next the angels yet towards god it must be moved directed ordered and pointed
for though the way on high was natural yet man not keeping his first state it's now become a way hardly passable that the soul cannot walk it of it self neither can it dwell on high more then we can live in the ayr without the drawing and holding of divine power
have written saith the apostle pet
to stir up your pure minds to awaken you

and it was but

need
see how david calls upon himself psal
praise the lord my soul and forget not all his benefits be sure to remember god

in the morning will my prayer unto thee or will set it in order will order my self in my addresses to thee
and in psal
awake my glory though his spirit was holy and set towards god yet it had need to be called on that it might be put forward in a right motion towards god and answer the voyce that calls come up hither
awakening is a word imports rouzing

as birds that provoke their young ones by flight to make use of their wings or as men call one upon another to their business
judg
awake awake deborah awake awake utter a song men do not thus call on themselves
it's a great fault that a man loseth that watch and that command over his spirit which he should have so that his mind either stands still as a lake or if it move it runs at waste as indeed a mans mind doth if it be not toward god and for god a great fault it is when men take not pains with themselves as the prophet complains isai
no man stirs up himself to take hold on god
it's said in exod
they came every one whose heart stir'd him up
your hearts had need

be stir'd up else they will not do their work
is it fit that so noble a faculty then which there is none under heaven more glorious as that understanding which god hath entrusted you withall should be no more improved was this golden candlestick given you for any other light then that which is from above that may shew you the way to union with god and enjoyment of him were these golden cabinets given you and have you the keys of them that you should keep them empty when you might fill them with heavenly treasure which is invaluable david calls his soul his glory you stain the crown of your glory when you make such glorious creatures to lacquey after every creature which should be in attendance upon god like angels in the presence of their father
when the mind runs after vanity you become vain jer
what iniquity have your fathers found in me that they run far from me and walk after vanity and are become vain the vain of your minds and spirits will make you vain yea worse then nothing
what injury do you do your selves that have such nimble winged messengers that can mount up to the highest heavens can walk with angels can lodg themselves in the bosom of the

glorious god can present all your cases to him can bring back again reports of mercy to you if you use them not do you not see how god is sending out to you continually the thoughts of his heart are love eternal love and the fruits of his love are always sent out like the beams of the sun he hath sent out his own son and will not you send out your thoughts towards him will not you order your thoughts toward him who hath directed his greatest love towards you what is your life but a continual emanation and emission of divine love and is god thus flowing forth to you and will you stand still and not have your minds runing out to him


in the next place as this is a fault that there is not that sending out of the thoughts toward god and that setting of the mind to this work so this is another fault that there is not a bending of the mind in this work
oftentimes the mind looks up but it's so feeble that a mans thoughts are like an arrow shot from a bow weakly bent which reacheth not the mark
it's wise counsel that the gives whatsoever thine hand findeth to do do it with all thy might
am sure in nothing more it concerns us to act with all our

might then when we act towards god in whom all our life is
chron

now set your hearts and souls to seek the lord your god
this is our work

to act with life and vigor when you go to take into your eyes the greatness of that glory which you hear of god the apostle's phrase is have the loyns of your mind girt when you are upon this work
ask you that question which christ put to some in another case what went you out to see when you crawl and move as if you had no heart nor spirits whom go you forth to see what him that is the lord of glory the only potentate what are such heavy and lazy aspects to take in such a glory you see in what large streams your thoughts fly forth to other things and are you only languishing weak and feeble in things of so great concernment mal
cursed be the deceiver that hath in his flock the sound and the strong but offers the blind and lame
certainly this is the way to procure a curse to be so exceeding remiss in your addresses to god hence it is you get no more then god comes most to the heart when the eyes are most set upon him the child that draws with strength is soonest filled the brests of consolation are full but therefore you are empty and complain

because you bend not your selves to draw from the wells of salvation you take not pains with your selves to make your way to god lively


as this is a fault not to send our your minds toward god and not to bend your minds to the work so this is another the not binding of your minds to it you should not only go to god but stay with him
the right minding of god is not a transient glance and sudden cast of the eye that is presently wheel'd off from god again
psal
remember the days of old meditate on all thy works remember them and not only bring them to remembrance but meditate on them my mind talks of them

that is the force of the word muse and stand looking on the works of thy hands this is that which fires the heart when a mans eye is fixed on god
psal
my heart was hot within me while was musing the fire kindled then spake with my tongue
indeed that is a season of kindling when the mind is musing but when the mind is fleeting and floating little impression is made little good comes of it
there are many days at court wherein strangers come to see and are soon gone and what get they nothing but they that abide in the presence

of the prince live by him
it's not a pointing and casting of your eye towards heaven that makes god your portion if you do not dwell with him he useth you like strangers
think well of it certainly where the eye abides not it's because either the thing displeaseth or there is some better thing that draws away your hearts
what is there in heaven or in earth should draw away your minds from these visions when you look upon him who is most glorious is he not worthy on whom your souls should dwell and your minds rest themselves with all their might certainly what we love that will hold us that will be in our thoughts we need not call out our minds and if once the eye be set upon it it holds as the loadstone having drawn the iron keeps it fast to it self
christ himself acknowledgeth such an operation of love upon himself cant
turn away thine eyes

for they have overcome me and in cant
thou hast ravisht my heart my sister my spouse with one of thine eyes christ was as one that had lost his heart as the word imports he is pleased so to express his deep affection toward his church he was held in the galleries and captivated with love to his people so that his eye was ever upon

them he loved to behold them it satisfied his soul as marrow and fatness to see them he shall see of the travel of his soul and be satisfied

isai
and indeed he saith he cannot get his eyes off them can a mother forget her child

no more can forget you
and is christ so tender in his love toward us that he ever minds us and shall our minds be so loose to him so fluttering and fleeting shall there be no more care to bind our selves in cords of love to him that we may ever behold him who bears us in his brest before his father always


this is our fault that whatsoever is done in sending bending and binding of our minds towards god yet with some at least that it might not be true of all it's not their course and trade now and then they are awakened and get up into heaven to see their father but it is not dayly and here is their failing that it's not their course as it was davids

every day will praise thee and am ever thee psal
beseech you consider it is this now and then going to heaven within the vail to live the life of friends is this to carry your selves as children to be so strange at home what now and then once a month or week seldom to be where

you always should be you should ever dwell with god as the lovely center and resting place of your souls and you are seldom with him is this fair is christ and the father of christ objects that are not worth the looking after such mean things that a visit now and then should serve the turn what said the queen of sheba concerning solomon blessed are these thy servants that always stand before thee and hear thy wisdom if she were so taken with solomon remember that a greater then solomon is here
and will you deprive your selves of that blessedness which you might enjoy by standing always in the presence of your father to hear his wisdom and behold his glory

but if this be a fault as indeed it is what shall we say of that voluntary retention of our minds when the voyce of god within bids us go and visit heaven but we sit still in a voluntary reluctancy to the voyce that speaks what shall we say to that voluntary diversion of mind when god sets himself in our eyes and our minds turn off from god and pitch on other things and have no content in beholding him but above all what shall we say to that voluntary effusion and vile expence of mind and strength of understanding upon

vanities when we send out thoughts in whole troops towards vanities and do not spare one toward heaven certainly this is a crime of a very high nature
you see in part what is your fault and to know that is a great advantage have endevored to shew you it in the several degrees of it shall now shew you the causes of it

how the soul comes to wander from god of divine permission in this case discouragements pretended the heart pleased with something else more then god


the first is divine permission god pleaseth to leave his people much to themselves for ends best known to himself and oh what work is made when this wilde boar is let into the garden how doth he trample and tread down what spoil doth he make when he is got into the place where he most gladly would be how did god let him in upon job so that his thoughts by visions in the night troubled him how was he tost in his spirit solomon how did the devil run away with his understanding and

carry him almost into a total forgetfulness of god that no good man think ever since the creation did run so desperate a race as he did god was rooted out of his heart as it were he giving himself up to fulfil the lusts of his eyes and of his mind with all his might but in the end he cries out vanity of vanities all is vanity and vexation of spirit
certainly it were better the devil had power to run away with our estates and liberties then with our thoughts keeping them in captivity and as the steersman of our minds ordering their motions at his pleasure
some mens understandings by the mighty workings of these principalities and powers are as swiftly carried to imaginations of evil as eagles when they fly to dead bodies or as any creatures when they make haste to their prey
you shall see a man when he is in this case all his thoughts are beneath heaven and they roul up and down the world and pitch sometimes here sometimes there as things suit but are separated from god and he cannot get off but as jael strook a nail into the head of sisera and fastened him to the ground so mens thoughts and minds are fastened to something in the world that they cannot deliver themselves

this is a woful day indeed when god will not be seen when god saith of a man as david of absalom let him not see my face
truly if this be the condition of any that their understandings are ridden by the devil and carried away from god go to christ confess and humble your selves seek his face who is the father of spirits and hath command and power over devils that as by permission he hath suffered the unclean spirit to enter so by his commanding word he may say to them come forth that your understandings may be free for their proper work for he only can cast down imaginations and every thing that exalteth it self against the knowledg of god and bring into captivity every thought into the obedience of christ cor
many may complain as job in another case chap
my days are passed my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart or as it is in the margin

the possessions of my heart are broken off as if a man should say had thoughts of jesus christ was wont to have sweet apprehensions of my father which took me much god was wont to take up my soul and my mind was wont to be contentfully possest with the meditation of him now these possessions are gone and broken off
pray then as david

psal
turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity or make mine eyes to pass

that they be not held to gaze upon vanity but that may run with freedom the race that is set before me having god still in mine eyes


a second cause of this great fault not having our eyes bent and fixt on god is discouragements indeed discouragements are called a weakening of the hands in jer
melting of the heart deut
breaking of the heart numb
all to shew that a man under discouragements is made unfit and unmeet for service

says one like this well and you speak to my heart when you speak of this eying and minding of god and my wishes keep pace with the rule am ready to say would it were so with me but the work is too hard for me find no strength to it

answ
suppose you do not

indeed commonly the best things are hard though this be hard yet it's a necessary work and you must never plead necessity against duty you are bound to it all law requires this
is it hard but is it not good doth not the work pay you wages my meditation of him shall be sweet saith david

again you say it's hard but not so hard

as is pretended and all the hardship that is in it we have brought into it let us not then complain though we sweat at the work let us be willing to do it
and remember what tell you though you have lost the command you had over your spirits yet if you be in christ it's in part restored to you
you see how you can send out your understandings and how they can shout out thoughts upon other things and will you not use a command over them in this in directing them toward god for the beholding of him what is the renewing of your mind but the giving it a powerful propensity to move towards god and the things of god if then you are in part renewed the difficulty is in part removed you have reason therefore in regard of the necessity and sweetness of the work to set your minds to it

besides your minds are swift of motion you should not speak of difficulty when in an instant you can start from earth to the highest heavens

again when you look to god and jesus christ you look to one that opens to you if you draw near to god he will draw near to you if the journey be long he will meet you more then half way isai
he meets them in the way that rejoyce and work

righteousness
so that if you set to the work you are not like to be as one that launcheth out into the deep sea where he sees no bounds or like one in a desart wandering alone on foot but you go forth to one that comes forth to you

false meditation subdueth not the heart
a wicked heart hath no joy in the thoughts of god
what's done and not according to rule is as if it were undone
the heart which mindeth not god in a constant course is not right

there is a generation of men

whose course is quite cross to davids whereas he saith mine eyes are ever towards the lord they may say mine eyes are never towards the lord god is not in all their thoughts psal
god reckons a thing as not done in several respects


when it's not done to purpose when a work is done but reacheth not its end jer
no man repents saying what have done yet isai
god acknowledgeth something upon record to be done they confest that their transgressions were

multiplied before him and their sins testified against them yet he complains no man repents because it was not done to purpose the work was not home
psal
considered my ways and turned my feet unto thy testimonies made haste and delayed not to keep thy testimones
here was a work to purpose
then a man looks toward god to purpose when the thoughts of god are the possessions of his heart when the eye is so set on god that the heart is changed into the likeness of god
though a man should give a thousand glances every day toward heaven if there be no effectual impression upon the heart god takes it as if a man ever lookt from him and never cast an eye toward him psal
they are called a people that forget god surely twas not a total forgetfulness for the law of god was in their mouths and they had made a covenant with him by sacrifice but their remembrance of god was not effectual it did not subdue their hearts to god therefore though they talkt of him yet god chargeth them with forgetfulness of him
john
the apostle saith that they that live in sin have not seen god neither known him a true sight god separates a man from himself it's the the destruction of the sins he lived in as

ignorance and forgetfulness of god is the strength of sin forgetting and not regarding are put one for another in scripture forget saith the apostle phil

those things that are behind i.e they were of no weight with him he regarded them not
so when men forget god it argues they regard him not at all as god is said to forget men when he will do nothing for them then a man is as forgotten as a thing that is not
jer
see how this is exprest even will utterly forget you

or in forgeting will forget you and will utterly forsake you and cast you out of my presence and bring everlasting reproach upon you and perpetual shame that shall not be forgotten
a terrible place for all forgetters of god


god reckons that as not done which men would not have done
sometimes men think of god but they know not how to shun it god breaks in upon their spirits but their natural temper is to suffer themselves to be drunk up and diverted by other objects a natural man abhors the thought of god nothing so sweet to a saint my meditation of thee shall be sweet
a good man could be content to live out of himself to live in god
it's a good work the work of angels they who once have been used to this employment know not

how to wish to change
one eudoxius wisht that he might be admitted to come near the body of the sun to have a full view of it though it devour'd him he was something rash in his wish but there is something proportionable in a godly spirit he so loves god that he could be content to be swallowed up in the beholding of him
tis said of some rom
that they liked not to retain god in their knowledg

and god gave them up to a reprobate mind they liked not that is they not only neglected but despised it seemed not good to them so the syriac it was a very unpleasing thing to them to know and to mind god
it's usual in scripture that verbs negative are put for their contraries
zech
love not a false oath love not that is hate it
heb
forget not to entertain strangers that is be sure you mind it and have this in your hearts to be ready to it
revel

they loved not their lives to the death

they did with their lives as with things they hate not at all regard them
so when it's said they liked not to retain the knowledg of god in their thoughts the meaning is they hated that god should have any room in them or that there should be any knowledg of god in their hearts
though the worst of men cannot but sometimes have god in

their eyes yet because they like it not god counts it is not done and takes it as if they gave him no attendance or never lookt after him
the apostle rom
upon this account reckons it's no more but sin that dwelleth in me because the propention of my spirit my better part is all towards god it is no more in this sence when a wicked man thinks of god it's not the man that doth it but his conscience or the power of god upon him he doth what he would not do
as in another case

when a man would do a thing though he cannot do it it goes for done with god as it's said of abraham concerning his son and david concerning the temple so that whether it be good or evil it's not reckoned if the will be not in it
let no man deceive himself though he cast his eyes toward heaven all the day long if he love not this work he doth nothing


that which is not done according to the rule god reckons it as not done
if a master set his servant about a work if he do it not according to the pattern and rule which is set him nothing is done it may be worse then nothing
this is not to eat the lords supper cor
yet they did eat it but because it was not done after its due manner he saith this is not to eat it
and

mark it what god faith in this case isai
thou hast not called on me jacob but hast been weary of me israel thou hast not brought me the small cattel of thy neither hast thou honored me with thy sacrifices have not caused thee to serve with an offering nor wearied thee with incense thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money neither hast thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices yet they did these things and god acknowledgeth it jer
to what purpose cometh there to me incense from sheba and the sweet cane from a far country your are not acceptable nor your sacrifices sweet to me
he looks on the thing as not done because tis not done as it should be
men think of god but their thoughts are not holy awful and subjecting the spirit they think of god but their thoughts are no way proportionable to the majesty of god they look loosly carelesly and carnally upon god they peep upon that glory with an unholy and undaunted spirit and so its against the rule and god reckons it not done nay it will be worse to them god will recompence upon their heads even their thoughts of him this he will punish severely people think they do well when they have good thoughts and think well

they are deceived for if their thoughts be not as they should be though they be for number as motes in the sun they do no good but bring many sufferings and punishments upon them


that which is a mans course and trade denominates a man and not any particular action
a man may come to a carpenters house and take up his tools and do something at his work but this makes him not a carpenter it doth not denominate him because that is not his trade
the best saints sin yet because it's not their trade and course they are said not to sin and are called blameless and holy
and david is said to be a man after gods own heart notwithstanding his many failings because the habit of his spirit was so
now the course of the world is a course of habitual and voluntary forgetfulness of god endeavoring to shut god out of their thoughts and if their thoughts do run towards him it's but as water out of its proper channel not in its place their way is altogether out of god that we may say of god in reference to these as job of places not frequented they are forgotten of the foot job
so the minds and spirits of these men converse not with god but he is forgotten of the foot of their souls this

is a dangerous state when they are not with god where are they in the night tares are sown and when is night but when god appears not as the of the sun makes darkness and then the night takes place and now all evil is to be found in that man
judg
they did evil and forgot god those two are joyned together as the cause and the effect they forgot god and therefore did evilÂ· forgetfulness and unmindfulness of gods is the womb of all sin where every unclean spirit nests
a man that lives in forgetfulness of god is free to righteousness as the apostle speaks rom
he is in no bonds to god he feels no obliging power in any thing upon his spirit toward god

as things that are not so things that are unknown and not minded are worth nothing
it's all one to me whether things be not or be forgotten
the spirits of those men are in a woful case that live without god they are as sheep without a shepherd and like a ship among rocks nothing but a divine hand can rescue them from everlasting shipwrack
all affections of love joy fear and hope flow from sight of god therefore where there is no sight and knowledg of god men are free to all evil if thou forgettest god thou clearly

pronouncest and the express language of thy course is that there is no god this very thing strips him of all loveliness and beauty one not worthy to be minded
what is more contemptible then that which no man will look on forgetfulness is the state of death psal
that be not as one forgotten among the dead
when god is not remembered by thee he is to thee a dead thing and what is thy mind but as a grave a place of darkness and forgetfulness where is nothing but pollution and corruption and whatsoever is loathsom in it self and destructive to thee it's the speech of bildad in job
can the rush grow without mire or the flag without water whilest it is yet in his greenness and not cut down it withereth before any other herb
so are the paths of all that forget god and the hypocrites hope shall perish whose hope shall be cut off though the marrow be fresh in thy bones and thou be in the vigor of thy youth though all be green and flourishing about thee yet thou art but like the flag without water and the rush without mire in a withering dying and wasting condition though at present thou please thy self in beholding thine own greenness so are the paths of all that forget god
therefore it's good to consider of it

betime
psal
david saith god will turn all that forget him into

the word signifies a state of death yea a depth of deaths indeed to forget god is a deep sin and it brings deep death upon men that live in it that dare walk so boldly viewing every creature and minding every vanity and do not make it their work to mind god all the good you do shall be forgotten and all the evil you do shall be remembered and god will say to you one day know you not was a stranger to you upon earth could not have an eye from you but when your lazy idle spirits pleased and now out of my sight i'le never own you nor look upon you more and this will be the case of all that forget god
having presented you with the fault shall now lay before you the causes whence it is that men live so in a course of forgetfulness of god

man wanders from god having lost the government of his spirit
thoughts of god suit not perverted souls are above them and against them
satan lord of the imaginations and master of the affections in those which forget god


men have lost the regiment of themselves that government which god had put into their hands over themselves
man was created in a good state like a well ordered family where there are some in command and others under command some commanding and others commanded he made man upright saith solomon eccles

when is a thing right when it agrees with its rule
god and man were alike the image of god was upon man what is the image of god god is good and god is wise and so was man and this was the rightness of mans condition god made man right

all was in order the reason of man was subject to god and the spirit of man was subject to reason man had the command of himself that he could set his thoughts in order and send them out upon their proper

work and errand and raise affections suitable to their objects and command their motion
now the case is altered thes
the apostle speaking of some men among other terms

he calls them this may be the name of the whole state of man he is unruly like an army routed where neither commander nor soldier are in their places so is man having swerved from his rule
the truth is the government is not utterly extinct but utterly perverted like a change in a state where though there be an alteration in the frame and constitution of it yet there will be a government still so here that government which man had over himself being perverted now that which is good is trampled upon and that which is evil is exalted serving divers lusts and pleasures saith the apostle tit
this is the state of man in prov
the eyes of a fool are in the ends of the earth wandering up and down like masterless creatures god is forgotten and man hath lost the command of himself to set and hold his mind streightly in attendance upon god
this is one cause


another is this god is not the object that suits them the eye is not pleased therefore it withdraws
what is in god is above man man was created in a state of

obedience to god and communion with him but now is sunk into such a state of darkness and depravation that what was his life is now too high for him that as our bodies cannot live in the ayr so the understandings of men cannot now feed upon god who is their proper bread and is so indeed to those who are delivered from this polluted and defiled perverted and impotent state
as beasts take no pleasure in beholding heaps of gold and rich cabinets of precious jewels which are excellent and glorious in the eyes of men because they suit not with their condition so the eye of a man is not taken with beholding god though he be good beyond all expression even he that made and keeps all good in heaven and in earth the blessed fountain of all because there is now an unsuitableness between this excellency that is in god and the present state of man that as the best food in the world will not please a sick stomack so neither will this angels food go down with men as solomon in prov
saith wisdom is too high for a fool whether he means the actions that are to be governed by wisdom or the dictates and rules of wisdom every thing of wisdom is too high for a fool
creatures cannot go higher then their appointed

and natural station a fish in the water enjoys it self but put it in another element it dyes presently
men are naturally of that constitution and frame that they cannot live but on low things they cannot live above what is the life of a saint is death to the world to rise toward god is the resurrection of their spirits and the elevation of all their life but its death and destruction to natural men
and they are not only averse to this because there is in god that which is above them but that which is against them
what dreadful apprehensions hath a man that looks upon the power and wisdom of god his eternity omniscience
these are visions that fright him and strike his heart through like a dart this god is holy therefore he will destroy me and there is no escaping because he is omnipotent and omniscient
there is in the nature of man a necessary motion that it puts it self upon flight from every thing which it conceives to be hurtful it will not endure a cohabitation with what is contrary to it
who can dwell with everlasting burnings god is a consuming fire to the world and their thoughts and apprehensions take fire at the remembrance of him and scorch their souls and they cannot endure it
it's a

great pain for a man to be where he would not wo is me saith david that dwell in meshech
it's a perpetual to a man when the place of his abode displeaseth him
though a thing be never so good yet if a man be sunk out of that state wherein formerly he had a sweet enjoyment of it it delights not
bury her out of my sight saith abraham of his wife when she was dead though he loved her dearly while she was living yet when she was dead bury her out of my sight
so men love not god therefore they bury him out of their sight and god buries such out of his sight jer
will cast you out of my sight as have cast out your brethren the whole seed of david man as he is in his depraved state hates his being and wishes himself rather to be nothing then to behold such an one as god that is everlasting burnings and hath an unchangeable will eternally and severely to punish sinners


a strong cause of mans unmindfulness of god is that distance into which the nature of man is sunk from all good especially from the greatest good and as any thing lies near that and hath most tendency to it so the heart of man draws back most from it
as a man that is renewed loves that best that is best and then that

which is next to it so an unregenerate man loves that best which is worse and hence they give themselves up to all vanity setting open their souls and prostituting themselves to every thing that is evil and become a common habitation and resting place for every thing that is not good and the more unlike any thing is to god the better entertainment the heart of man gives it by this voluntary tradition of himself he is so captivated to those things that he had once a power over and his back so bowed down and he so held under that he cannot come out of this state except god bring him out that in mark
doth something resemble the state of these men they were in the desart where were many comers and goers and they had no leasure to eat it's so with worldly men they have many thoughts coming and going that they have no leasure to do that which is best for them


the last cause is this god doth sometimes give men up and leave them to be at the will of satan to raign and order their motion as he pleaseth so that he is master of their affections and lord of their imaginations and he calls back and sends them out hither and thither as he pleaseth he is called the strong man and as he is strong

so he works strongly he is said eph to work effectually in the children of disobedience where he hath possession of the mind he picks up the seed sown that it may take no root nor spring up he prepossesseth the mind and holds it in perpetual employment like sampson that was made to serve in a mill so satan makes the soul to run a round which way pleaseth him that it hath no time nor leasure to look towards god which is a very sad thing joh
it's said of judas the devil having put into his heart to betray christ
when once the devil hath got the regiment of a poor creature in that kind he puts in and puts out at pleasure and the truth is when he put this thought into judas satan himself entered into him vers
he came in with those thoughts he entered when they entered and then the man was perpetually and mightily employed by him
the mind of man is naturally fruitful in thoughts tending from god out of the heart proceed evil thoughts mat
it is with the nature of man as tis with some ground that brings forth some things of it self but if it be drest by a skilful man it abounds much more
when satan becomes the gardiner of the soul every plant there multiplies and fructifies exceedingly

and there will be a mighty encrease
hence it is that man lives in a course of forgetfulness of god because by a voluntary diverting of himself from god at length god is provoked to divert from him and then satan takes possession of the heart and thoughts he enters and commands the man at his pleasure

this may suffice to set before you the causes of that unnatural and that hateful forgetfulness of god wherein most in the world live beseech you mind it it's a business of exceeding great weight
my next work is to perswade you to practise the duty held forth that you would always have your eyes toward god

chap
viii

perswasions to frequent emanations and contentful abode of soul with god
minding of god a work possible to christians a work of the most excellent power
spiritual actions easier then bodily
contemplative life everlasting
natural propensity of soul to god renewed in saints
a blessing of love in true mindfulness of god

live in a more close attendance upon god you never live rightly till you live in the world as in a place consecrated to god
it's an extream wrong to the end of our being when we let our minds loose unto vanity to be extravagant and open to vanity is worse then that the temple should have been opened to all abominations
this work is little regarded in the world little of it is done the children of the night are altogether in the dark and shut out from god the children of the light very much found in forgetfulness of him and truly these days in special manner abound with this fault men stand more remote from god now then ever forgetfulness of him from whom all our being is and

upon whom we all depend reigns yea much of it is there where men think themselves to be raised most unto god and brought into more conformity to him and communion with him
my counsel to you is to look to your eyes my eye saith david is ever towards the lord and oh that all our eyes were so fixed
the work that now call for is the willing holy and frequent emanation and outgoing of your minds towards god and contentful and effectual abode with him
shall give you a few arguments to press this duty and indeed we had need have arguments urg'd with all force and it's well if a hundred arguments draw one man the most argumentative discourse in the world is not strong enough alone to prevail with men


the first argument is from the nature of the work it's that which you may do it's a work possible it's a work that you have power to do when god calls for your eyes it supposeth your eyes are not so set and fastened in your heads not so fixt and immovable but you may look up to him you may eye him and mind him god never gave a command impossible but here is this threefold fault which i'le but touch

that men having understandings to mind god their minds stand still like standing water or like a clock whose wheels move not at all which fault however sometimes it may be from a meer distemper yet oftentimes it is from a sinful principle there is no list in mens hearts to look to god nay there is a withdrawing from god and rather then the understanding shall be employ'd upon god it shall run at waste like water or stand still and not move
men sometimes do look to god but as it's not their dayly course so they do it not with strength but weakly and faintly slight visions leave but very shallow impressions these men live according to the sight they have of god slight men are of poor spirits because they do not enoble themselves in a vigorous beholding god

a third fault which is worst of all when men send out their thoughts and lay out their understandings in an ill way when the matter of their thoughts and imaginations is evil
there are thoughts of good that are evil thoughts and thoughts of evil that are good when a mans mind looks on god but the heart withdraws when it looks upon god with contradictions and quarrellings at him these are evil thoughts

of god
there are thoughts of evil that are good as when a man looks on evil but his end is the separation of his heart from it and that he may destroy it
but when a man looks upon evil with affections and desires after it when his mind is employed the bellows to the fire when he is coning and devising how he may compass this is most notorious wickedness doth mightily habituate and root the soul in a deplorable elongation from god he that thinks and deviseth evil makes haste to it with all the strength he hath prov
he that deviseth evil shall be called a mischievous person a master of evil

so some read it this is the fruit a man by employing his understanding in a sinful way he becomes to be a sinner in grain a master sinner a leader of others a man transcendent going beyond others as saul was higher then the people by the head and shoulders
david describeth such an one psal
the words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit he hath left off to be wise and to do good he deviseth mischief upon his bed he sets himself in a way that is not good he abhors not evil that is he loves it as those phrases import verbs negative are put for their contrary affirmative
prov
if thou hast thought evil

lay thy hand upon thy mouth for as the churning of milk brings forth butter and the wringing of the nose brings forth blood so the forcing of wrath brings forth strife it's but to shew what degrees sin hath
when a man hath thought an injurious thought against another it's time for him to lay his hand upon his mouth and stifle it there for if the thought be entertained it inflameth the tongue and then much evil comes into act
as the churning of milk brings forth butter and the wringing of the nose blood so saith solomon the forcing of wrath brings forth strife
as vipers dye by the young ones bred in them so do men dye by the evil thoughts bred in their minds
the apostle peter speaks of some men pet

so sunk in sin by the exercise of their understanding and senses about it that they could not cease from sin


this am sure of the more you wander from god the more you run into sin and every thought you have of evil this way is a step from god
stop betimes before you go so far that there can be no return that you be not held in the cords of your own iniquity pray that the thoughts of thine heart may be forgiven thee which was the apostle's counsel to simon magus acts
men come to be in a remediless state by giving way to evil

thoughts isa
it is said of ephraim a deceived heart hath turned him aside that he cannot deliver his soul nor say is there not a lye in my right hand now a man is in a woful state when he is so turned aside by his deceitful heart that he cannot extricate himself
you have a power and may do something and by how much more you are enabled to it by so much the greater your sin is if you neglect it when god calls on you for this work if you can be profuse on other things in a great expence of your minds and thoughts towards them and you will not mind him in all your ways your sin is the greater


this work is a work of the noblest power and faculty you have and as any thing is more excellent so it stands in the greater obligation towards god for as a man receives so he owes we owe much that receive much
seeing then you have received so noble a faculty from god you are more engaged to lay it out when called for according to the will of him that gave it you have other faculties that are not under such a tye you have a power of breathing a power of motion in all your members you have many powers but these lie not under that obligation as this because this excels all the more careless

and unfaithful you are in improving it for god the greater your sin and fault is
this faculty is as one calls it

a divine breath a beam of the immortal light the very image of god nothing comes nearer unto god then the mind of man and angels when you suffer therefore your understandings to run from god you debase your glory your excellency is now deflowred and dishonored
it's recorded as a reproach upon domitian the emperor that he would be spending his time to catch and kill flies too childish a work for a man in so high a place it is much worse for you to employ that excellent faculty your understanding about flies and trifles that was made to behold god and in beholding him to be filled with him
it's the most excellent and highest faculty and the workings of it are so much the more easie the works of the soul are more easie then those of the body therefore you should be encouraged to put your selves on the exercise of it
the eyes of the body can by one glance reach the stars and see further in a moment then the body can move in all its time the mind is quicker then the eye and in a moment can glance into heaven to the beholding of god therefore this should be a motive to prevail with you to

the practise of this duty because it's a thing whereunto you are so enabled

it's a most excellent power conducing most to your life the actions of the body do more weakly and remotely conduce to your life
this faculty is spiritual and herein differs much from the actions of the body which have their seasons their proper time and place but the acts of the soul may be done in any place at any time you may start into heaven when no eye sees you you may be on the wing towards god though among a croud of men no business is such but you may be with god and yet your business not suffer

again it's an eternal faculty and the work of it is everlasting a contemplative life is the life of heaven it's that which angels do they ever behold the face of your father in heaven
if you like not this work how will you live in heaven the dislike of it is a bar against your entrance the life of blessedness is a life of vision and seeing god which if you take no delight in heaven is no place for you

again it's a faculty very active your minds must be somewhere else if they be not with god and if they be not on god they are upon something of less concernment
why should you follow after drops

and neglect the fountain why should you fly after shadows and neglect him who is the true substance truly if the mind have its current from god towards other things these things are not only of less concernment but destructive and from whence you will reap nothing but corruption and depravation and defilement of spirit you will grow worse and worse into the form of the devil by how much your minds stray from god and pitch upon other things jer
they are gone far from me and have walked after vanity and are become vain

again it's a faculty that hath received in the saints a tendency towards god
you do extreamly wrong your selves when you make not use of that propensity and put not forth your selves to have communion with god whereby you might bless your selves in the enjoyment of him
see how david expresses the propensity of his spirit towards god psal
god thou art my god early will seek thee my soul thirsts for thee my flesh longeth for thee when shall come and appear before thee to behold thy glory as have seen it in the sanctuary this is the course of the spirits of the children of god in whom that propensity which was natural is now in part

restored so that they are bent towards god they thirst after god as a man thirsts for water in a dry and thirsty land

again there is a blessing in this work god blesseth what he likes as he curseth what he hateth he likes it well
mal
then they that feared the lord spake often one to another and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the lord and thought on his name
he will be sure to mind those that mind him and be a friend to those that seek after him
when you are bid to look upon him it is but to receive from him is it any thing else but to call and invite you to look on the most pleasing and delightful object that in the beholding of it it may convey it self unto you and you be delighted and filled with it it is all one as if he should bid you sit down by a well of life and drink and to be as christ and the angels are who are blessed in the beholding of him as if he should bid you come and pluck apples off that tree of life that is in the midst of paradise

god loves this work cant
let me see thy face my beloved and hear thy voyce for thy voyce is sweet and thy countenance comely
in one act you may do that

which pleaseth god and makes you blessed set your eye towards him and his eye will be more towards you and he will refresh you as with manna there is enough in him come and take freely reflect upon your own experience have you ever found this way like a wilderness if it be a blessed work why will you unbless your selves if the work will exalt you why will you debase your selves in not closing with it and if you might live above in heaven why will you live below let all the sweetness you have ever found in this work provoke you to enlarge your self toward it
when thoughts of god are moving in you god himself is not far off he will come and enter too and how sweet is it for god to come and take up his habitation in the soul

ix

jesus christ a pattern of eying the father
greatest mindfulness of god due
god our best friend
all we have is in his hands and of his gift
all religion founded upon a due mindfulness of god
anguish awails wandering hearts

another argument is from the example of our lord jesus whom we are to mind and imitate he is your pattern what saith christ learn of me and be you perfect as your heavenly father is perfect
how can you follow christ the captain of your salvation if you mind him not when the apostle perswades them in heb to run the race that is set before them he bids them look to jesus the author and finisher of their faith
mariners at sea that they may run a right course keep an eye on that ship that bears the light
your course cannot be right when your eye is not upon jesus christ your pattern
would it be with us as it is when the forgetfulness of god lodgeth in our hearts if we did more mind christ we should say in our selves is this the course that he steered david tells us of christ psal


that he set the lord always before him or as luke expounds it applying those words to christ acts
foresaw the lord always before my face the father was ever in his eye whatsoever came into his sight he ey'd him first and fix'd upon him
now christ is not only appointed to be our pattern in this thing but he takes notice of us whether we imitate or no his eye is upon us to see whether our eye be upon the father as his was and is for ever
it was the counsel of seneca that when men are about to do evil they should think on plato or some such eminent man as present to behold them
certainly if christ were more minded as such a pattern god would be more the object of our most affectionate thoughts

again if we consider the object it is the greatest reason in the world that our eye should be upon god god is our friend he loves us he bears us in his heart and shall not he be in our thoughts this is ill requiting of him whose eye is always on us seldom or never to eye him this is a great contradiction to the law of friendship which consists in reciprocation of loves jer
know my thoughts toward you saith the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end oh that

we could say so know my thoughts towards god are thoughts of love and care to please him job
see how hainously job took it that his friends had forgotten him my kinsfolk have failed and my familiar friends have forgotten me

as god is your friend so all you have is in his hand my times saith david psal
are in thy hands god and can you forget him in whose hands are all your concernments if you had but a piece of your estate in a mans hand you could not but mind him
god hath all that you have for soul and body to eternity in his hands and shall we forget him it was the aggravation of the sin of belshazzar in dan

that he did not glorifie god in whose hands his life was thy god in whose hands thy breath is thou hast not glorified

again you have all from him all the good of every kind that you receive is all from god and will you not mind him deut
god complains that the people were unmindful of the rock that begot them and forgot god that formed them
shall we so dishonor our selves and live so cross to all principles of reason and justice as to be taken with the things we receive from god and forget him shall we receive all

that comes from him and shut him out of doors it was never gods intent that when he had deckt our ways with all flowers of comfort we should sink into an ungrateful unmindfulness of him these are so many memento's to excite us to remember him
it was the commendation of abraham heb
that he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country he did not sit down as at home and make glad his heart in the enjoyment of mercies but reckoned himself as in a strange country that he might enjoy him that is better then all

it is upon record that god had said often to his own people the jews beware lest you forget me when you come into that good land it is spoken to you also take heed you forget not me in your habitations in your relations and friends in your goods in all your enjoyments
isai
thou art my servant israel have formed thee thou art my servant thou shalt not be forgotten of me or not forget me the force of the word is thou shalt not bear me away

but let me be in thy heart and in thy mind and remembrance always as i'le not bear thee away thou shalt not be forgotten of me
thus you see much in him whom you are to mind to draw and hold your eyes toward him

the last argument it is a very fundamental duty all your intentions purposes dispositions and affections in your whole course comes to nothing except they receive life from this for this is the foundation of all in the sight of god lies your rule of direction for all your actions and all the reason of your holy walking the mind is the leader and it leads according to the object where it is set
job
my heart hath not followed my eye that is the natural course for the heart to follow the eye where the eye is set there the heart will be also
see how the prophet expresseth isai
have stretched out my hand to a rebellious people that walk in a way that is not good they follow their own thoughts
they walkt in a way that was not good what led them their own thoughts thoughts do mould men a man that thinks much of the world grows worldly and a man that thinks much of god grows godly as he thinks so he is saith solomon prov
and we beholding the glory of christ saith the apostle cor
are changed from glory to glory
if there be any comfort of hope if any flames of love if any life of faith if any vigorous dispositions or motions toward god if any meltings of a softened heart these flow from the knowledg

of god not habitual but actual

habitual knowledg is as meat in the cubboard and as precious water in a glass but actual knowledg is those things in use and enjoyment we are renewed day by day saith the apostle how by looking on things that are eternal cor
heb
it is reported that moses did many excellent things how came he by that excellent spirit he saw him that was invisible
plato saith that it is philosophy to love god for that is the end of it to bring men unto god
upon all these considerations and many more that might be urged give up your selves unto this work there is not a man free but the bonds of this counsel are upon him
the sum of it is this often have your eye on god dwell in the contemplation of him let that day be as one of the days of hell and of darkness wherein you have nothing to do with god this is certain if god be your god you cannot let your minds run at waste to turn aside from god will be very chargeable and expensive to you you will pay dear for it children that wander from home get the rod the rod is not far from that man that loves not to stay with god

god can make the thoughts of thy heart to be like hell it self and to minister more

bitterness to you then if a whole legion of devils were about you beseech you therefore mould your selves into this doctrine that you be not found despisers of the great god who will not speak in vain one of these two things will be made good upon all either the word will subject your souls unto the command of god or unto the vengeance of god and if you cannot now look up to him with delight you may know the day in which you may look up and curse isai
now you may look up towards god and live but the time may come that you may be in that distress that you will curse god and the world and your selves when bitterness shall be on your souls for your neglect of this work

directions concerning eying of god
truths to be received in their power
saints are to keep in their hearts a meetness for their work
saints are to preserve their capacities for god
saints must maintain a deep sense of divine engagements
a lively sense of necessities is useful
pure hearts are meet for divine converse
the mind will'd without sanctification

shall now set before you some helpful counsel that may enable to this great work from which the heart of man doth so hang off
certainly there is nothing which men are more hardly brought to then to this to keep the remembrance of god fresh in their spirits and to let their understandings run in this channel constantly
as men do intend an end so they eye the means indeed the means lie in the way to the end yea they are the way it self and the end is in them will therefore offer some means to you

first entertain the rule in the power of it when any command of god comes armed with his own strength it makes man weak he cannot make resistance but falls

down conquered in the assault
the heart naturally stands out against and is estranged to every voyce of god it will give him the hearing and admit the sound but not the strength it will keep the word at a distance either by or by voluntary diversions and forgetfulness
indeed the things of god are very strange to us though they were our best and nearest acquaintance in our primitive state and therefore now we are hardly brought to own them and receive them

the not entertaining of the truth in the power of it is that which frustrates so many thousand sermons so that though everyday one thing or other is called for and pressed yet matters are as they were god speaks but few regard he cals but few answer he saith do this and do that but all is undone still
then the word and counsel of god is received in its power when a man doth acknowledg it and hath the sense of the weight and efficacy of it and this was the commendation of them thes
that they receive the gospel not in word only but in power and what was the effect of it see vers
and they became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction
and observe john
what the reason was that the jews were in

so desperate a course against christ that they sought to slay him christ himself gives the answer

my word hath no place in you christ had preached unto them as he doth unto us but that word which he then spake had little entrance or little abode at least in the spirits of men and so at this day either the door is shut against the word or it is soon cast out of doors again it is not a faint yielding of your spirits unto the call of god when he speaks of such a thing as this is the thorny ground had much of this when the gospel came and call'd on them to look to god and jesus christ they were very yielding there was a sprouting of many affections and great appearances of the efficacious working of the word on them

but all came to nothing
many while they are under the ministration of the word are under some operation of the spirit that attends it and they are ready to say as they in exod
we will do whatsoever the lord saith but may take up that wish that there were such a heart to do even this one thing now call'd for to walk in more mindfulness of god and that it might be said of you as it is of them rom
thanks be to god

that you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine into which you were delivered
the

receiving of the counsels of god in their power is not as you may think only a present entertaining of them nor is it the present taste of the sweetness and vigor of them in your spirits but it is the abiding of this word in the power of it upon your hearts
there are many that are much struck in their spirits by the word but yet what saith the scripture of them they cast the word of god behind their backs and no more look after it therefore they are unfruitful hearers of it all their days
john
see what the apostle john saith let that therefore abide in you which ye have heard from the beginning if that which ye have heard from the beginning shall remain in you ye shall also continue in the son and in the father
men know not what they do when they let their hearts depart from the word many invaluable counsels from heaven in which their souls are bound up are lost and made nothing of as to them this is satans gathering of the corn that is sowed before it come to maturity
those whom god carries through obedience to eternal life he doth cause to lay up his word to be their companion and unto them as the covenant that was layd up in the ark of god have hid thy word in my heart saith david psal

it is such a hiding as men are wont to use when they hide their treasure that by no means it may be lost
god writes on the minds of those whom he loves his law and he leaves impressions of himself that he will be minded he that is our pattern hath said that the law of god was in his heart psal
and it is the name that the prophet gives unto the people of god isa
that they are such in whose heart is his law
this then you should do lay up the word and have often recourse to it and lay your selves and your practises to this rule and often say where am where is my mind whither is my understanding wandering what path hath my soul been treading in have been walking with god have been minding him have been serious in my spirit in the contemplation of him thus often have recourse unto the word it is a dangerous thing to let our minds go far without a check it was the great fault charged upon those that were near to destruction jer
no man repented saying what have done this commandment of minding god is a commandment backed not only with authority and reason from the equity and excellency of it which all precepts have but it is also accompanied with special ordinances

besides the natural ordinance of the creation which is a memorial of god that you may be ever promped unto the fountain of it there are special instituted ordinances appointed to this end that you may remember him
what is baptism and what is the lords supper but the representation of jesus christ to us memorials of him that in the celebration of them you might remember him therefore labour to make your hearts sensible of the authority and majesty that is in this command when god speaks from heaven unto you that you would walk in all mindfulness of him and that is the first thing

the second thing that would commend to you is this to get and keep your hearts in a meetness and fitness for this work as god hath put work on his people so he doth expect that there should be a fitness in them for it as the apostle speaks tim

a vessel made meet for his masters use and service
will express this meetness in a few particulars

one is to keep the mind as free as you can our understandings though they are mighty things yet they are limited when they are held much unto other things there cannot be much of them left for god

take heed of being too prodigal in cutting out too large portions of your selves otherwise when you fill your spirits with the world

you are put into an incapacity of communion with god that which is within keeps out that which is without mark what christ saith luk
take heed to your selves lest at any time your hearts be with surfeiting and drunkenness with the cares of this life and so that day come upon you unawares
what ever doth put you out of possession of your selves what ever incapacitates you to that obedience whereunto you are called these things as you would not have the evil day come upon you unawares are to be taken heed of
what a dread is it to the soul of a man when the evil day the day of affliction the day of temptation especially when the day of dissolution comes on him before he looks for it while he is busie in the world in hunting after this and that vanity snatcht away like a fish taken in the net that it lookt not for the cares and the pleasures of this world are unto the spirit of a man as wine it doth intoxicate and put a man out of himself and under the power of satan he is a man in bonds the devil hath his foot upon his head and his hand upon his heart he hath the possession

of him when he is taken with any thing in this world you know what christ saith that these cares and pleasures choak the word
hear and read never so much let the wisdom of angels speak to you let men put themselves to the utmost improvement of reason and understanding and lay out their bodies to the very last to perswade you yet if your hearts be taken if the world hath gotten you away you are choaked that as the corn that is with weeds faints away and as a man that is surfeited cannot breathe so is a man in this case
the effusion of your self upon the creature weakens you towards god that as a drunken man that hath not the use of his limbs nor of his reason that is like a child in strength and a fool in understanding so is a man whose mind is cut out and shared among the creatures he is separated from god that he cannot draw near to him
the body cannot be in two places at once and your understandings and spirits cannot be strongly in heaven and strongly in the world the streams will run strongly but one way if you will therefore be in the world you must be content to own your selves banished from god you have set your selves from god you make your selves strangers to your own life and put

your selves at a distance from your own eternal good
take heed therefore of filling your selves with the world take heed of sinful fulness worldly fulness takes up the whole capacity of the soul that there will be no room left for god
tell me pray you what use are your chrystal glasses for do you keep them to be filled with puddle water will you fill your stomacks with chaff or carrion and will you fill your precious and glorious minds those high and excellent creatures with the vanities of the world nay the things of hell it self take heed of prepossessing your selves for if you be not free we speak to dead men it is all one to bid you look towards god as to bid a deaf man look eastward when his eyes are fixed westward it is all one to bid a man walk with god and in mindfulness of him as to bid a man that is bound in chains of iron rise up and walk

another thing is maintain in your selves a deep sense of those divine engagements that lie upon you indeed we have all of us many bonds upon us but yet we are too free and disobliged to god and whence is it but because we forget our engagements

another discouragement alas say some span missing

this troubles me

cannot hold my self to the work am oftentimes assailing and putting on toward heaven forcing on and driving out some thoughts but cannot lodg them there they roul down again and cannot fasten them truly this is my grief

beseech you consider it this rouling of the mind downwards is either from remisness of heart or from weakness if from the former it's very sinful and imputed if from weakness it is sinful but not imputed the evil is not charged upon you
what think you of your selves if you had a child that hath a palsie hand that cannot hold fast what is put into it you are not angry with your child but pity him
he that is so

a father that there is none like him who saith he will accept according to what we have and not according to what we have not cor
he will not charge his children with their weakness
all the saints on this side heaven are troubled with dimness and instability of sight when they look upwards there is a turning and wheeling of their minds downwards of which they shall be perfectly cured when they come to heaven in the mean time be not discouraged but do as well as you can the more weak your eyes are the more frequently

do you look he had need look often that cannot look long

another discouragement is this would look up to god but what sweetness will it be when have not an interest in him tis true he is a glorious father but the more unhappy that he is not my father he is a blessed fountain but the more unhappy that may not sit and drink of those waters
what though thy case be so that god be not thy father yet he is thy lord if he be not thy portion yet he is thy pattern and thy rule thou must mind him but withall consider it's your minding of god that is the means to bring god and you into one that he may be yours and you his we are transformed from glory to glory by beholding him cor
sights of god are of great force and therefore men lie dead because they are in the dark light hath something of an awakening and a quickening power therefore if your minds were more in conjunction with god this would form and fashion your hearts more unto god and bring god more into you

again saith another this disheartens me that though endeavor dayly this course of bending my self to eye god yet

get no good by it know my pride and the stoutness of my spirit and many evils that are in me and think by presenting my self before god to be bettered and to get more quickening and enlarging a heart more prepared to seek and to see god in all my ways but find still a crooked spirit and a heart unwrought upon get no good by it

but is it so indeed dost thou get no good at no time then there is no life in you certainly thou art dead if thou get no good from him that is all good
but yet there are that get good that know it not be not discouraged but endeavor to have your eyes set toward god and toward him alway
one cause more shall name why this duty is so much neglected and omitted and that's this

that the heart is set upon some other object observe this for where the heart is set the thoughts of the heart run out and are poured forth you have got something that pleaseth you more then god and that hath entertainment and place in your understandings
where a mans treasure is tis christs rule mat
there will the heart be also
if god be in your hearts he will be in your eyes if you love him you will

mind him what you mind most you love most love makes the mind quick in motion and strong in resting on the thing whereon tis set

they that are taken with the glory of divine goodness cannot keep themselves from the remembrance of it nay they will force on themselves and spur up all their powers unto it praise the lord my soul and all that is within me bless his holy name praise the lord my soul and forget not all his benefits psal
if you would mind mercies more you would mind more the god of mercies if you did remember the sweetness and fulness of this stream of grace by which you are maintained you would eye more the fountain from whence they flow and if you would get your selves under the engagement of this love it would constrain you that you could not live forgetters of god but your eye would turn readily toward him if we were sensible of our engagements could we deny god that attendance that he calls for from us as his servants could we deny him dwelling in his own house could we shut the doors of our hearts against him that is the place where he should rest could we deny him communion who is our lord who is our husband

who is our friend and father a heart under the effectual impress and strong touch of divine grace and mercy will not be able to keep from minding of him
david was a man that had a strong touch of this and therefore saith he in psal
will praise thee lord my king and will bless thy name for ever and ever every day will bless thee and will praise thy name for ever and ever
where bonds of love take hold they bind to god as well as draw

another thing is keep your hearts in a lively sense of your own necessities
you need much the world groans whence is it it is from want
you want much even they that have received much want much and you want nothing so much as god and here your wants are great and constant and it were good you did always live in the sense of this want
can a hungry man forget his bread can the heart that pants for thirst forget the river can a man in bonds forget freedom can a child in distress forget a father in honour and wealth and if you lived in the sense of your necessities could you forget god that is the fountain and he by whom all your wants are to be supplyed according to his riches in glory by jesus christ

again keep your hearts pure and then you will be meet for this work guilt brings fear and fear brings torment
the natural effect of guilt is flying and hiding from god and dying in our selves adam would not be seen when he had sinned david was afraid to come before god when under guilt in psal
see how he did contend with fear go saith conscience and fall down before that god against whom thou hast sinned dare not saith david am afraid to stand in his presence he saith it was his torment for day and night thy hand was heavy upon me my moisture was turned into the drought of summer so in vers
said will confess my sins fear said do not but saith david will do this
but this is sure a man that hath a spirit that is sullied by sin a spirit that hath guilt upon it a man that is under the power of an accusing conscience that man will be afraid of god as a prisoner of the judg and certainly sometimes if god did not by a mighty power draw in his people they would rather hazard their eternal life then look up when they have lift up their heel against him so dreadful is the sight of god that it exceeds the strength of any creature not only the natural strength but also the spiritual
it is with man in this case

as with servants when they have committed some notorious fault against their master away they run forsake their service and master too this is the disposition of man when he hath rebelled against god he is apt to take a run from him and go with those that wander from god and live without god in the world
see what is said in sam

the people sinned and samuel said unto the people fear not ye have done all this wickedness yet turn not aside from following the lord but serve the lord with all your hearts and turn not aside for then shall you go after vain things that cannot profit nor deliver for they are vain for the lord will not forsake his people
he saw such a disposition in them that through discouragement of heart finding themselves in sin they were ready to sink and fall off from their attendance and service unto god and therefore he gives this counsel by no means to harken to this suggestion of an evil and a torturing spirit

let me add this as another means that you must pray for sanctification of mind what a strange wilde thing is the mind of man by nature sanctification is the taming the composing the ordering and seasoning of the understanding it is the

bringing of the mind into a right frame and the setting of it in its proper course until that be it lies open for all comers all the powers of darkness snatch and catch and rend it in pieces and bear it away and every vanity commands it but when grace comes that appropriates it unto god so that it becomes the lords
therefore pray for sanctification which is the induction of a new nature into the spirits of a man and a new propensity so that as naturally it had its tendency towards vanity now it will have its tendency toward god
sanctification is a great thing what is the body until sanctification comes but an untamed monster as a wilde beast with what numberless outragious passions doth it blind and carry away the soul until it be sanctified it puts a man into an incapacity of conversing with god it lies not only open to all temptations but it snatcheth after them it's a weight that lies upon the spirit of a man
pray for sanctification which is the sequestration of the spirit of a man from vanity and the consecration of it unto god it is the putting of it into his possession the planting in it a new disposition to move towards god and to converse with god this the apostle calls the renewing of the mind

advantages that come by minding of god are to be duly considered
the more we mind god the more we may
those which eye god most know themselves best
those which eye god most have most of god
forgetfulness of god cuts the nerves of holiness
forgetfulness of god betrays to apostacy

now let me add another help weigh well with a deep sense the high advantages which a due discharge of this work doth bring upon you this will facilitate the work the more you mind god the better you may
men cry out the work is hard it is good and sweet but hardest to those that do it least easiest to those that do it most living in this work doth advantage and enlarge your spiritual strength and put you into more meetness and fitness into more proportion of ability for the discharge of it that as the apostle speaks of the sinful use of the eye and of the sinful effusions of the spirit in way of evil that it works unto a necessity of sinning so that they have eyes full of adultery

that cannot cease to sin pet

so the more you

live in mindfulness of god the more are you wrought into a most excellent and sweet necessity of living in this course gods entertainment is very gracious unto a friend that minds him that he cannot long have god out of his eye

this advantage you will also have by it the discovery of your self and truly that is a great matter for a man to know himself we are therefore so little our selves because we know our selves so little all that monstrous pride and that foolish indulgence that is usual toward our selves is because we know not what we are
this will make you know your selves more for when your eye is on god it is upon your rule the rule of all perfection the most absolute pattern of all spiritual beauty therefore you may see what proportion and similitude there is between god and you this will breed a abhorrency because of that infinite disagreement that is in the spirit of a man and his ways to the holy god job in the sight of god abhor'd himself in dust and ashes job
here you may see how your hearts and the rule agree

now also you may observe what impressions the sight of god leaveth upon you
you say you mind god well and

pray what comes of it what fear what faith what hope what tenderness what watchfulness is there wrought in your spirits by your minding of god what a hard heart is that which is layd under the very beams of the sun of righteousness and melts not what an obdurate spirit is that which in the sight of god yields no more we should come to see better what we are if we were more in this work

this advantage too you shall have you shall be filled more with god what is the moaning of your souls saith the saint that might enjoy him that god might be my god and that his presence might be with me where ever am all spiritual life hath its birth and growth in this work the first sight of god lays the foundation all after do superstruct the first sight of god is the planting of holiness in the soul after are waterings unto more encrease and fruitfulness at the first sight of god god enters into the soul but the after of god fills and fills until they fill up the soul
if therefore it be so great an advantage consider it and let it provoke you unto this work

one rule more to help unto this work possess your selves deeply with the apprehensions

of the great sinfulness of the neglect of this therefore men and their sins are so near together because they see not their sins more sinful when sin appears out of measure sinful then it sets the heart at the greatest distance from it
look on the sinfulness of it in the cause of it whence is it thou wandering soul thou sleeping spirit thou man possessed with the world that thou sayst thou breathest after god and yet shuttest thy eye from him it is from a most woful frame of spirit faith is dead and love dead all principles of life are put into a state of astonishment it is deep night all the spiritual powers are asleep bound up hence it is thou mindest god no more
poor creature thou art not thy self thy heart is gone other things have born it away thou art like the prodigal until god brings thee unto thy wits and right mind again

now see what the state of that man is by the true original of the sin of neglecting to remember god and look a little further into this matter to see it in the effect of it forgetting of god dissolves the bond between the soul and god and sets it free from god it is the minding of god that doth beget and preserve a capacity of him and propensity toward him then forgeting

of god shuts up thy heart from him and doth byass thy soul unto a contrary motion to a departing from him puts thee into a state wherein thou canst not be according to the calling whereunto thou art called thou canst not walk in the place of a servant toward thy lord for how canst thou do his will whom thou rememberest not if all the reason of holy walking lies in this then the nerves and sinews of holiness are cut in sunder when forgetfulness of god raigns in men
there is this evil also thou betrayest thy soul as much as in thee lies into the state of the devils themselves what makes hell but want of god and what makes the unhappiness of devils but separation from god and this thou dost practise upon thy own self
could give a notorious and sad instance of this truth to every one that doth voluntarily forget god in an apostate professor whom knew who said the turning point and first beginning of his declining from god was his neglect of communion with jesus christ
therefore when you give your selves to a voluntary forgetfulness of god you betray your selves into a state of apostacy and backsliding from god and if once the devil get the possession and can back thy spirit he

will ride thee post into the pit where there is no bottom and from whence there is no return
will shut up all with that expression of god in isai
because thou hast forgotten the god of thy salvation and hast not been mindful of the rock of thy strength therefore shalt thou plant pleasant plants and shall set it with strange slips in the day shalt thou make thy plants to grow and in the morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish but the harvest shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow
you may in your forgetfulness of god enjoy your desire trim up this world to your own contentment and make all your ways like pleasant walks in delightful gardens you may make your paths to be as fruitful fields but what shall the end be when the harvest comes in the appointed time thereof there shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow
if you would have a harvest of rejoycing if you would reap that which may be the refreshing of your souls if you would not sow gall and wormwood for you to reap hereafter take heed of betraying your selves into a forgetfulness of god

the principal interest or the propriety of saints in god displayed in several discourses upon micah
my god will hear me
chap


interest in god the true spring of consolation
how it is propriety with community
best because god is best by a confluence of all excellencies

the church was now sad and there was cause enough for god frown'd upon her if she look'd upward she saw god displeased if downward there was nothing but violence one devouring another

with the tongue and with the hand and therefore she makes her retreat unto god because men are so injurious so false so treacherous therefore i'le look to the lord

it's an excellent spirit which is in the saints that the world knows not of they make such therefores such conclusions as the world is not acquainted with the froward man says therefore i'le do so too the politick man says therefore i'le be wise and look to my self the good man says therefore i'le look to the lord
observe how the evils of this world put the saints upon the improvement of their power with god and how the sight of propriety in god gives strength and life to the spirits of saints i'le look up i'le wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me
that which am to speak to then is that the sight of god as our god is that which lifts up our heads and chears our hearts against all discouragements and carries us through all difficulties and whatsoever is dismall when a man can say god is mine that man shall live when nothing else lives
i'le give you some few foundations of this

the first thing i'le instance in is that

this propriety of the saints is a propriety with community there is much in that in cor
unto the church of god which is at corinth sanctified in christ jesus called to be saints with all that call upon the name of jesus christ our lord both theirs and ours
the force of this lies thus that which serves for most is best the sun is better then a tapor because that serves all the other serves but one or a few a spring is better then a cistern because all my drink of that but few of the other
that which all want is best universal want argues that thing which we need to be universally good
that may be wanting to one man which another wants not a mariner may want a rudder or a sail which others want not but all men want bread that thing is good to him but this is good to all
this propriety therefore being with community to wit that god is not my god alone but of all the saints in heaven and in earth and of all the angels this shews that a propriety and interest in god is the best propriety hence it is that the saints having their portion in such an one are so refreshed and their comforts much advanced because they know that others drink of the same river of life together with them

secondly this propriety is in that which is best by a confluence of all excellent things as for example love goodness and kindness there is none like that which is in god here it is transcendent you may reason so not only from what god is an infinite being but from what god doth
look on those high operations of his wisdom and power you shall see they are clear demonstrations of his goodness the most excellent things have flowed from thence pardon of sin peace that passeth all understanding and everlasting life these have flowed from this goodness
god in his love hath gone to the utmost to set it out he never intended so full a demonstration of his power as of his love therefore though he hath not gone to the utmost of his power yet he hath gone to the utmost of his love it's love that passeth knowledg all knowledg eph
it's possible to imagine how some things in the creation might have shewn forth more of the power of god as if he had made men equal power with angels
but it's not devisable which way there should be a greater demonstration of his love then he hath shewn partly in what is the enjoyment of his saints in this world but principally in that which he

hath promised in the other
now where the greatest goodness and love is an interest in that person is most precious and excellent
there is in god a descending love you shall seldom find that love in a child carries that worth and excellency in it as the love of a father doth because descending love chiefly seeks the good of another ascending love seeks our own good the love of god greater because descending love

further there is not only goodness and love in god but wisdom also for the managing of these this adds to the propriety
the best prince may not have wisdom enough to know all his subjects but god knows all his as christ saith joh
know my sheep and am known of them
he that tells the stars and calls them all by their names knows every one of his and their cases he knows what fears what wants what pressures what straits they are in the lord knows how to deliver the righteous out of all their troubles pet

again he is present with all his all things in the world are confined and limited god only is every where the sun reacheth to the whole hemisphere but gods power is infinite and himself omnipresent he fills heaven and earth he is not confin'd

to any place or limited within any bounds therefore to have a propriety or interest in this god must needs be a very great refreshing and consolation

chap
ii

interest in god of a perfect extent to all in god
gods love lasts is not broke off by offences is not hindered by distance
interest in god effectual to all good ends
divine friendship not burdensom

the propriety that the saints have in god is perfect mean it extends throughout to all that god is
among friends and acquaintance this is the law their friendship reacheth to some things not to all but the interest of the wife and children reacheth to the full compass of the husbands estate much more our propriety in god reacheth to all that god is
as the law of communion between the father and the son was this john
all mine are thine and thine are mine so is the law of the interest between christ and his people cor
ult
all things are yours because all is christs
if there be enough in god for the spirits of just men

made perfect whose capacities are greater then ours if there be enough in god for angels whose capacities are greater then theirs if there be enough in god for jesus christ whose capacity is yet far wider if there be enough in god for god himself then there must needs be satisfaction to a man if he can say that god is his god he needs no more this will content and fill his spirit

fourthly this propriety is that which will hold out
all our interest in men and things is very fleeting experience shews it the anchor comes home again because the ground was not firm all friends are but like flowers in the hand they are mine now anon they are good for nothing and are no bodies
you have this given as a reason why we should not trust in princes in psal
because they pass away and their thoughts perish what ever they intended and had contrived for your good all dye with them
the israelites that found favor in egypt for josephs sake suffered when another pharaoh arose that knew not joseph
but if our friends live nothing is more common then to have an eclipse and a damp brought upon the love of friends
but christ loves to the end and if he loved his people when he was in this world

how much more doth his love continue now he is in the other world because here his love met with many difficulties but there he hath nothing hard to do his work lies plain and easie before him
the affections of men are subject to a natural may call it an unnatural mutability which is not only a torment to others but to themselves for that man that changeth his heart suffers as well as he from whom his heart is changed and this is help'd on by many things


by offences that ripen and quicken that fickle mutability of this poor frail mortal changeable creature man you shall have him now like the sun in his full shining and anon some cloud of offence darkens all his love we were the unhappiest creatures that could be if god should be so to us but he hath expressed himself in isai
that he will abundantly pardon and that he will multiply pardons


distance many times takes off the edg of love and friendship among friends friends oftentimes dye one to another while they live the child sometimes is forgotten of his father and the wife of her husband but the eye of god is ever upon us and we cannot but be satisfied in his love whose eye is ever fixt upon us as

you have his promise in the last of matthew lo am with you always to the end of the world


there is a love that is fastened only by a short relation as between the master and the servant and those that are in a brotherhood for a time when the term of years is out that relation ceaseth but it is not so between christ and the saints

in the fifth place
this propriety that the people of god have in him is most effectual because there is neither want of love nor power in god
in isai
all ye assemble your selves and hear which among them hath declared these things the lord hath loved him he will do his pleasure on babylon and his arm shall be on the caldeans
whether we understand it of his love to his people or of his love to cyrus it is not much material as to the setting forth the efficacy of this propriety
if we understand it of his love to cyrus who perhaps was yet a stranger to god that notwithstanding this he would do so great things as he had spoken for him how much more effectual will his love be to those to whom he is engaged by relation he will stick at nothing because his love is so great no offences shall hinder because he hath engaged to pardon you are sure to

speed when you come to god they that see this their propriety in him therefore must needs rejoyce

sixthly this propriety in god is not onerous and burdensom
indeed our relations to men and our propriety in them is oftentimes costly and not without charge can we either preserve or act our friendship toward them we usually lose by receiving a man accepts a benefit and loseth his liberty as a wise heathen once said
a man by his engagement is put oftentimes upon hard services he is made to do every thing that receives every thing the more you take from a friend the more he is discharged and he things he owes you the less and that you owe him the more but indeed whatsoever god doth is an engagement upon him to do more for you
expressions of friendship from friends come many times mingled with much bitterness harshness and rigidness but when god dischargeth the part of a father and a friend he doth it like himself it comes pure like water out of a pure fountain no sadness no bitterness mingled with it he doth it with all his heart as in jer
i'le rejoyce over them to do them good and with my whole heart and with my whole soul
oh when kindness comes so it comes

sweetly what refreshing is it then to beleevers in all their conditions to look upon divine love that's sweet and clear and pure all these joyn'd together make but one head of arguments from that excellency that is in god

chap
iii

saints engaged to live upon god by the law of nature love and judgment
spiritual relation is mutual
true resignation hath conscience with love
a divine power in and over saints
the grace and peace of saints furthered as they mind their interest in god

another argument is this we have nothing else to live upon we must either live here or no where if we live not upon what we have in god we are dead men for god is our life
the life of every creature is maintain'd proportionably by a threefold law


some by the law of nature so fishes live not but in the water and beasts in their pastures and cannot live in the sea and indeed there is something of the divine new nature in christians they must

live in god or they dye


there is the law of love the child loves the mother above all women though it may be there be many betterÂ· the lord hath placed the life of the child in the mother how much more the life of a christian in himself for there is no love like that love

life is cut out by the law of reason and judgment by which men chuse their portion upon which they feed and upon which they make their lives
this way nothing but god is eligible to a good man he saith some other things serve for other uses but not to live on
nothing but god can be made our own nothing out of god is properly our own but our sins how can a man say that is his own which he cannot command and hold nothing can be made full enough strong enough answerable to our desires but god hence it is that a good man lives in god because he can live no where else though he make use of his bed to sleep on of his meat to refresh him and do as others do in the use of these things yet he would be a very dead man worse then a man layd in the grave if his life were not in god

would exhort you then v&se

that you would thus live in god it is a riddle to

the world but a truth to saints and that which their souls can witness to the world knows no other life then friends estate and such like enjoyments the saints know that there is no life in these they live another life which the world knows not of
live this life that is make this to be the strength reason and rule of all your walkings to be the pillar and prop of your souls whereon you may lean and rest make this your ultimate rest that after all the troublesom turnings and tossings of this world you may take rest here in this peace of god which passeth all underestanding that you may say as david in psal
he was in trouble but saith he trusted in the lord and said lord thou art my god and this was all to him against all trouble they seek my life and make me a derision but said lord thou art my god
two things premise in this exhortation


that you make your interest in god sure that you may be able to say without fear and trembling thou art my god

this interest is mutual if god be yours then you are his he is yours by gift of himself to you and you are his by gift of your selves to him remember the day when how and by what act you did give your selves to god have you put

by your selves and all your sinful propensions dispositions and resolutions have you layd an absolute denyal upon them never more to observe them much less to serve them and have you resolved that you will have no purposes or desires but such as are according to god be sure if you cannot say you are his you cannot say he is yours you may please your selves indeed with fancies and vain imaginations of that which is not but know this that such a kind of contract with god as we speak of hath evidence in it it's not a cold and liveless acting but there is power and efficacy in it
these two things will be of power in that man that hath in truth given himself to god


conscience with love conscience without love hath very much power in it but conscience with love is very potent indeed conscience will tell thee man thou hast given thy self to god therefore thou shouldst walk as his and love will take thee aside and sound the same alarum in thine ears too but more effectually


a second thing is the power of god in them and over them there is a power of god in such you have received saith the apostle the spirit of power tim

this is the difference between the relation

that is between god and his people and all other relations this relation conveys the spirit of god into men
the husband and wife that are never so closely knit cannot convey their spirits one to another the husband may wish that his wife were wise and meek but he cannot give her such a spirit but the relation between god and his people always works a communication of spirit the spirit of god is given to them

besides there is a power of god over such because he sees that there is a great power against them they are kept by the power of god through faith unto salvation
certainly if you have not such a conscience joyned with love and find not such a power of god watching over you and the spirit of god guiding you you are none of his

another thing to be premised is this that a christians life whether we consider the life of peace or the life of holiness depends much upon his minding of his interest in god
the apostle in hebr
tells them they had lost much of the life of christianity how came that because they had forgotten the exhortation that spake to them as unto children
and in prov
who forsakes the guide of her youth and

forgets the covenant of her god
the latter is the cause of the former because she forgets the covenant of her god therefore she forsakes the guide of her youth

you have need to seek much in god your sins are many your dangers great you know it well enough you have this encouragement whatsoever you go for you knock at the right door whatsoever you ask you ask that which is as much your own as any thing you enjoy god hath made over himself to you in becoming yours he hath said he will be your god all particular promises are but streams from this spring and branches from this root
your interest is larger then heaven and earth heaven and earth are nothing to god therefore if god be yours you have more cause to rejoyce then if he had made you actual and sole possessors of heaven and earth
in the world they that have little of their own comfort themselves that they have something in their friends such a lord such a duke is their friend so if you have not much in this world comfort your selves in this that god is your god
the lord thought this enough to comfort his people with when they were afflicted and tossed with tempests he that takes not

comfort in this either knows not what god is or denies what he professeth to know
live by faith or as some render these words in psal
feed on faith
when you come to god you come not to ask a title but to plead a title you come not to ask any thing that was not your own before but you come to ask the possession of it
you cannot ask more then he is intended to give you he takes more contentment in giving do not say then you can take in asking though that be much but then you can have in enjoying
the propriety you have in god is by a mediator so that he by whose means you come by this propriety hath all things put into his hand and he is in stead of god to you as it is said of joseph that he was in stead of god to his brethren
he that hath obliged us to be whatsoever we can to those that are ours hath much more obliged himself to be all that he can for us
christ was made so great not for his own sake but for our sakes if he be set on the throne it is for our sakes what shall we need to fear when we come to ask any thing of him he stands more obliged to us then we can be to ours because it is easier for him to do what his place calls upon him for then it is for us for the engagement is strongest

where the performance is easiest and because we are dearer to him then ours are to us the dearest child is not so dear to its mother as we are dear to him and the hurt that would come to those that are beloved of god if he should fail them is greater then can come to children by the neglect of their parents
again the honor that christ hath engaged is of infinite more concernment if a father be unnatural that is a stain upon him but what is a spot of dishonor upon a piece of dirt but if the prince of glory should be unnatural this would highly reflect dishonor upon him
how may we walk with confidence and security and account our selves richer then princes and stronger then armies though all this nothing concerns those that stand out and are as strangers and aliens that will call god father whether he will or no that are not taught it from above but have learned it of themselves
if a man cannot call god his father and his god upon good grounds what a miserable state is that man in he is nothing he hath nothing and there is nothing between him and everlasting misery but a moment of time he goes up and down pleasing himself with vain shews pleasing himself with painted

butterflies but hath nothing to live on he is utterly unprovided for eternity

chap
iv

saints have not only the portion but the spirit of children
ingenious walking greatly requisite in those who pretend interest in god
god more easily pleased with his people then with others
tastes of gods sweetness are obligatory
careless walking weakens hope in prayer

v&se if the sight of our interest in god be the life of saints then let those who plead an interest in god walk worthy of it it is precious for it is their life it is worth all that is required of you that which god calls for at your hands takes nothing from your happiness but adds much to it
it is the apostle's exhortation col
walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing
let me propound to your considerations a few things to put you on to this

first you are deeply obliged to please god and thereby to walk worthy of him for being in so near relation to him you have not only the portion but the spirit of children because you are sons therefore he

hath sent the spirit of adoption into your hearts gal

other relations

because they want strength are not always beautified and sweetened with a convenient spirit the relation of a husband cannot communicate a meek spirit to his wife nor the relation of a parent to the child because of their impotency their will is strong but their hand is short but god in that gracious relation wherin he stands unto his own gives them a spirit like unto himself that so he may have children answerable to himself and to his will in rom
if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his
he that is joyned to the lord saith the apostle cor
is one spirit
as persons conjoyned in marriage are one flesh so he that is married to the lord that is brought into that near relation unto him is one spirit they are one in their affections propensions dispositions and designs
as we say of a multitude they are of one heart and of one spirit when they conspire in one so god and his people are one spirit because they center in one he in governing them and they in subjection and subordination to him so one as things ruled and the rule is one
this argument the apostle urgeth in tim

god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power

love and of a sound mind
he had in the words before exhorted to this therefore saith he put thee in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god that is in thee by the putting on of my hands but timothy might say how can do that why saith the apostle we have received not the spirit of fear but of power
it is a time of danger indeed and a hard work to preach the gospel in such days as these but he that is gifted and fitted by christ to that work hath received a spirit of courage and power by which he is able to mannage the things that he hath received of god

then say having received the spirit of children the obligation lyes the stronger upon you to walk as children
this is a rule the more proportionably a man hath received strength and ability to his work the more he is bound to it therefore the more of the spirit you have received the more you are obliged
and this spirit of christ in his people acts according to its primitive original pattern as it wrought in christ so it will work in you according to your proportion
this moving will be strong because it moves upon the highest grounds that which is most taking and prevailing it moves upon hopes and sense of eternal life
if you

walk not so as to please god you walk with much frowardness of heart and your sin is the greater
it's true though you have received this spirit yet there is much of the spirit of this world in your hearts but this is our duty and our work not to suffer the better spirit to be quel'd and damp'd by the other

but yet again that you may see it more fully remember if you please not god you act against your own interest and advantage for your life is bound up in the favor of god when you therefore act against god you act against your selves
the apostle useth such an argument in ephes

where he exhorts husbands to love their wives for no man ever hated his own flesh he means this that they being one the husband cannot cease to love his wife but he loseth so much of his own life because they are one therefore crossness and untowardness between them strikes them dead

in unequal relations the inferior is more dependant and so should be more subordinate in the relation between the father and the child the child is the lower part and lives more upon the father and therefore ought to live more according to the father according to his will or else he

acts against himself he offends his father to his own hurt and the goodness of superiors is of greater influence and force then that of inferiors take a child in the goodness of a child be it never so high that cannot work so much to the good of the father as the goodness of the father doth for the child

the love goodness and mercy of god who is infinitely greater then we is of unspeakable influence to our good and therefore to be tendered and preserved
sin in the nature of it is a violation of the law that is of the will of god the effect of sin is a provocation of wrath and anger hence it is that the speaks so in prov
he that sins against me wrongs his own soul he offers violence he spoils his own soul he becomes a robber of himself
the nature of sin aims at the destruction of that against which it is set although it do not attain this effect because of the power of him against whom it is for it's a denying of all that god is as that he is infinitely wise infinitely good
therefore the apostle speaks of some in tit
that profess they know god but in works they deny him how is that that is by their works they declare that they do not acknowledg him as he is
men therefore

that seek not to please god do no otherwise then as if men in a ship should with axes or such like instruments seek to cut holes in the ship wherein their lives lie
to act therefore against god is to act most desperately against our own good and by this we see how we are engaged to please him

again take this in that god will more easily be pleased with his people then with others therefore they are the more bound he takes that well from some hands that will not pass from others it is true we are all under one law and rule god did not destroy the law by taking his people into a gospel state but established it nay the law binds more then it did before only as the binding power of it is encreased so the rigor of it is abated that is the terms of obedience required are changed god said before if you do not this and this and every thing to the height of it you shall dye but he doth not hold his people to those terms now that we are reconciled to him all is due that is commanded but he accepts of what we can perform so that here is the difference the law speaks to one sort to those that are in the flesh that are out of christ as in gal

cursed is every one that continueth not in all things

written in the law to do them
to the other sort whom god accepts in christ he speaks as in cor
he accepts according to what a man hath if there be a willing mind
now if less will pass with god and be well taken from thine hand then from others thy sin is greater then others if thou dost it not

further you are engaged much because you have had tastes of the sweetness of walking with god
this is that which made that aggravation of their sin which god hath said he will not forgive heb
that they had tasted of the powers of the world to come but it's a greater engagement to have a taste of god himself then to have a taste of the things of god to have a taste of that excellency and goodness that is in him is far a greater bond then to taste of all his favors

nay you have had a taste of the bitterness of wandering from god and neglecting him witness the blows and stripes of your own spirits and the frowns of god upon you how hath your unwary walking led you into a wilderness of darkness and fears and will you yet sin thus against god have you not said in those dismal days as in hos
i'le return to my first husband for then it was better with me then

now and have you given your selves to god again and again and do you now neglect him will you not endevor to fulfil your promises mark how god carried himself to his people that neglected him jer
of old time broke thy yoke and burst thy bonds and thou saidst will not transgress thou saidst thou wouldst not but thou didst for under every green tree and upon every high hill thou wanderest playing the harlot yet planted thee a noble vine how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me it is a dangerous thing to break promise with god he will plead your own words against you
that then is one main consideration why such as plead an interest in god should labor to walk in all pleasing to him from that engagement that lies upon such to god

a second consideration is this otherwise you will weaken the comfort of your hope and expectation in prayer
how can you rationally with any satisfaction to your own spirits expect that god should fulful your will that are not willing to fulfil his how and base is it for a man to wish in his heart that god would act so as to please him when in the mean time he is not careful to please god

it doth horribly impose upon god it argues a most vile and base spirit it imposes upon gods wisdom upon his goodness and indeed upon all that god is and god takes it very ill to be thus dealt with as he expresseth himself mic
the heads thereof judg for reward and the priests teach for hire and the prophets divine for mony yet they lean upon the lord and say is not the lord among us none evil can come upon us
what followed therefore zion for your sakes shall be plowed like a field
god will not be so put off
this sin borders upon that in deut
if any man say shall have peace though walk after the imaginations of mine own heart my wrath and jealousie shall smoke against that man and will strike out his name from under heaven
you come to me saith god and say father arise and save us in jer
but you do all the evil against me that you can or as some read it you do evil and you can or and you prevail that is whereas before told you how ready was to do you all good you have now so tempted me and provoked me with your sins as to prevail with me to resolve to give you over
this sin was that which bred in david such discouragement to come to god that he had rather stay till his bones waxed old

through roaring then go to god this is that guile of heart which he speaks of in psal
against this it was that samuel reasoned with the people in sam

that after all their former evils they should not depart from god
take heed therefore of such a state lest you fall into those evils that the conscience of unholy walking will bring you into

chap


saints interest is through great condescension
conjunction of god and his people very intimate
a priviledg restored and how by jesus christ


a third consideration is the nature of your interest in god i'le set it before you in a few expressions

first he is one that is above you greater and higher then you are
now the law in unequal relations is this that he which is of the strongest side be a relief that he that is of the weaker side be subject if therefore you walk not in obedience you do what in you lies to destroy your interest to make god not to be yours for in mal
saith god if be a father where

my fear if be a master where is my honor as if he should say cannot reckon my self a father to you that do not fear me nor a lord to you that do not honor me therefore if be a father and if be a lord to you where is my fear and where is my honor and upon this reason he speaks to them in the first of hosea loammi you are no more my people
this is the utmost misery the creature is capable of to be in a state of separation from god
wo to them saith god in the day when depart from them in hos
indeed all woes lie in that woe as all evils lie in that evil of departing from god
of other relations some are natural but that relation between god and us is of will from grace we are his now we were not but he hath chosen us called us renewed us and adopted us
in relations the better side hath often need of the weaker kings need their subjects and cannot be without them but god had no need of us he is so far above us that he doth not stand in need of us or any thing in the whole creation
my goodness extends not to thee god saith david in psal

it's an happiness to have an interest in one greater then our selves an interest in a begger is of no worth because he is of no

power but interest in a prince all men seek therefore in psal
it's said blessed are the people whose god is the lord and blessed are the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance

and as our relation is thus to one above us so our interest is the best and nearest that can be in god
god was free to let out his love to every thing as he pleased all creatures have an interest in him except such who have been expelled and exterminated
in a kingdom every subject hath an interest in the prince but those of his family especially those of his blood his children have the best interest in him
the interest that the people of god have in him is the highest and the nearest the noblest interest that such creatures are capable of in psal
ult
they are a people near unto him near not only in respect of employment but in respect of affection they are in god
they are called a peculiar people tit
so in exod
though all the earth be mine yet you are my treasure
we might have had the interest of servants and truly that had been much for us we had reason to say as the prodigal we are not worthy to be called thy sons make us as thine hired servants but now he hath set us so near to himself

as we could not be nearer this should much oblige us to him

again it is a renewed interest the propriety we had in god was lost but as he said in mercy concerning jerusalem zech
have chosen jerusalem again so he hath said concerning us have chosen them again and taken them in the second time
we were afar off as the apostle speaks ephes

but now we are made nigh
that may be said of us which the father spoke of his prodigal child luke
this my son was dead but he is alive he was lost but is found
our state of righteousness is by regeneration by renovation and reception we were cut off but we are planted again into the tree of life therefore now to neglect god is the greater sin
in judg
it is said that after god delivered them from the yoke of the ammonites and the moabites they sinned again and that is set down as an aggravation of their sin
and for us after pardon and after reconciliation after reception into grace and favor not to please god is a sin of an higher nature then the sin of the world

further concerning the nature of our relation to god look upon the cause of it it is by jesus christ we are made near in him saith the apostle ephes


and that by a strange way


god contrives an attonement to be made by christ for us

then god contrives a match between christ and us that we might become one with him and so become one with the father
and upon this reason christ spake those words in john
now ascend to my father and to your father to my god and your god
not to take care to please is a token of one afar off it's a mark of those wretched ones mentioned in thes
that they please not god
take but this in too viz the effects of this interest all your former sins are done away and all good is become yours all things are yours saith the apostle cor
ult
whatsoever you ask is yours in joh
whatsoever you ask the father in my name i'le do it

god content to be ours though we had disowned him and depraved our selves
gods interest in us chargeable to him
god owns not all but some
peculiar frowns upon those which walk unworthy of god


a fourth consideration is this the nature of gods interest in us


it's an interest that hath suffered violence there was a great violation made and much dishonor cast upon it for god was rejected and cast off by us
in the primitive apostacy the whole nature of man cast him off quickly and upon a small temptation and since that every one of us in our own persons have often cast him off and denyed him when he hath pleaded his own right and have said he should not bear rule over us this might have set him against us and the rather because our offence was not acknowledged by us we bore it away stifly god found us in this state we were enemies in our minds by evil works or by our minds on evil works col
if a woman depart from her husband and be married to another will he receive her again saith god in jer
yet he hath received

us though we have offered violence to that interest which he had in us upon all accounts
the angels did thus indeed but god never pardoned them when he reached forth his hand to the lost world heb
he did not take hold of them he took hold of man to bring him unto repentance and so to bring him back again to his first estate
if the greater force the lesser the lesser is pitied if the lesser force the greater every one wonders at him and condemns him
oh what condemnation is this worthy of that the creature should force the creator and deny god that made him to be his god and yet this we have all done

again it's an interest that hath suffered detriment and loss we are not what we were when we were first his
at first we were a glorious structure as we came out of his hands but since we gave our selves to other lords there is nothing but darkness and confusion and what ever is vile and unlovely in us
you are degenerated saith god into a strange vine unto me jer
that is not only new or what it was not but that is one that know not that approve not as we use to say when we are offended with one you are a strange man that is not

according to mine expectation or desire
so we were gone into a condition strange to god yet he hath taken us in again
if a servant run from his master and when he is become poor blind lame deformed and altogether diseased shall find what an act of grace is this this is our case we went from god when we were well and are become altogether depraved deformed and in an absolute contrariety unto god
the father took in the prodigal when he had spent all he gave him indeed a goodly portion but he it and himself yet he received him again as a son so god hath dealt with us therefore this should be an engagement upon us to please god

again it is an interest with charge the prodigal when he returned had nothing to live on but must live on his fathers alms when god took us in again we had nothing we must wholly live upon him
again it is an interest by free choyce god takes in not all but some and what mercy is it that any of us should be of that some if any of us should make any of that few which god hath restored to favor

one consideration more is this that god will have it so if god be your god he calls for this that you be careful to

please him he will make you to do it
it is a most absurd thing to dream of such a state of grace that gives licentiousness to walk in sinful inordinate affections contrary to god it's against the wisdom goodness and power of god and he having power in his hand will never suffer it

three things god will do to those that please him not

he will suspend the sweetness of his presence which you have expressed in the words of that good prophet chro
he went out to meet asa and said unto him now hear thou me and all judah and benjamin the lord is with you while you are with him and if you seek him he will be found of you but if you forsake him he will forsake you
a second thing is a denyal of success to you what you hope for shall be blasted what you desire shall be broken that which you fear shall come upon you
thus god dealt with this king asa because to shun war he swerved from god and took a wrong course therefore saith god thou hast done very foolishly henceforth thou shalt have war

a third thing is that he will deny such the testimony of his favor for want of which

david in psal
so complains looking upon himself as a man spiritless and forsaken

chap
vii

the absolute necessity of interest in god
god is either with or against his creatures
whosoever hath not god hath no true interest in any thing

that which shall next speak to in a few words is this that every one would look after the getting of an interest in god and then that you would clear up this interest to your own souls that you may be able to say my god will hear me
labor for an interest in god nothing is more necessary for it is not here as it is in other cases if you cannot have one man to be your friend you may be without him though he will not be for you he will not be against you god stands not neuter in any state of indifferency towards his creatures either he is with them or against them and to have god against us is the greatest evil that can be
two ways this will vex and torment the spirit


in respect of the sight of the excellency that god is if that be hid from our eyes now know that a day of revelation is coming when god shall shew forth himself in his glory and then he will appear to be what he is when there is no more hope left for the enjoyment of him
do not turn that into the greatest misery which in its own nature is the most attractive worth the most refreshing comfort and true happiness that is god
the enjoyment of god in heaven makes that life that high life that eternal life it must needs therefore be death the worst of death all death to have him against us

but it is not only the contemplation of his nature the sight of what he is that shall afflict but his power shall be visibly put forth against such as have neglected him and he will act against those that did not act toward him and seek to get an interest in him where he saith not come ye blessed he will say go ye cursed into everlasting fire

besides this remember that we are made for this end to have an interest in god and converse with him we were naturally and originally designed to this now if we attain not our end we are lost
we many times make things for such ends as they do

not reach but if they cannot serve one end they may serve for another but if you attain not this end you attain nothing you are lost
when god made thee first he made thee in a capacity for the enjoyment of himself that capacity remains but nothing can fill it up but himself so that the spirits of men shall roar and weary themselves to eternity in restless motion after that which they cannot attain
it is true as the prodigal when he was gone from his fathers house made a shift to live on husks and such trash for a time so do many now but the day will come when god will take these husks away from you wives children pleasures and estates and what ever it is that gives you some refreshment in this world and then you will be left worse then nothing you shall neither have god nor the world

yea such a necessity there is to look after this that you have indeed no true interest in any thing till you get interest in god though you think you have that man that hath not god hath nothing it is most sure for he is under sentence a condemned man loseth all his estate
men will perswade themselves they are lords and that they have this and they have that but indeed they have nothing what they

have is but prisoners allowance something is allowed to condemned men till the stroke comes and this is the case of all men that have not god for their god

know also that a man is not said to have any interest in any thing that doth not add something to him if it be not something that contributes to his
a man doth not reckon his sickness diseases pains and such evils and miseries to be his interest in these things no man accounts of it is unhappiness whatsoever adds not to a man stands for a cypher is nothing interest in nothing is nothing
that which we claim interest in must have some good in it to give out unto us
but now the real good of a man is no way promoted by any thing while he lives without god in the world
it is the priviledg of saints that all things work together for their good rom
and it's as true otherwise that nothing works for the good of those that love not god
children and estate may tend to the goodness of one mans condition there may be good working out of them to one man and yet may prove to the hurt of another as the best good may be evil to this or that man to a man that is under the curse all turns to bitterness and death
the truth is that which kills life doth less hurt the senses then that

which only destroys the peace and rest of a man
a man feels more by a stroke sometimes then he doth by a consumption or an apoplexy
that which destroys most effectually is oftentimes least felt and therefore what men feel not because of their outward enjoyments they consider not they lay not to heart but if god be your god then all is yours cor
then comes an interest in all
as he that marries the heir becomes lord of the estate servants and cattel and lands are his he commands all the family so if god be our god the whole creation becomes ours
men come to have much by coming to god the apostle gives some account of this in heb
where he saith we are come to mount zion to the city of the living god to an innumerable company of angels to the spirits of just men made perfect
we come to all these to communion with these when god becomes ours
we begin therefore at the wrong end when we seek any thing in this world and seek not god first for saith christ mat
seek first the kingdom of god and all these things shall be given to you
when therefore you seek estates and the accommodations of this life and do not indeed seek to make god yours you act very crosly to your own good

there is a simple necessity to look after this for besides what hath been said you all live and are in a state of absolute dependance upon god who hath the power of life and death we are all in his hands and that key by which he shuts and none can open you shall see put forth one day when you shall know what a loss it is to miss an interest in him who hath all power in heaven and in earth
that's one thing which should make us serious to get an interest in god that it's simply necessary

chap
viii

interest in god most attainable
goodness and fulness the springs of communication
desire easily and with most success revealed to god
poor strangers impotent persons not bar'd from god as from men
interest in god incomparable in the enjoyment

a second argument is that it is an interest most attainable for it is goodness and fulness by which we come to have interest in any thing these are the springs of all communication between one and another and where these are greatest there is a wider door opened a fuller easier and

sweeter entrance into communion and the enjoyment of each other
it's the nature of goodness to be communicative and the more goodness the more ready to communicate
look through the whole creation and you shall find it so that as any creature is more noble and excellent so it is the more hospitable and bountiful the more ready to give out it self
the sun the air the sea how liberal are they things of a more confin'd and straitened nature are but like a small cottage into which one or two or a few may enter but it cannot give habitation to many but as creatures abound in the goodness of god and his fulness they become like a stately palace that gives open ready and liberal entertainment to many
now god is greatest in all excellencies and therefore his propensions to mercy and goodness towards his creatures are unspeakably unconceiveably greater then any propensions in the creature can be

in these two glories god infinitely transcends all creatures in the glory of his being and the glory of his working
nothing more sets out god and exalts him then his readiness to do good and communicate himself to his creatures
he hath said it's a more blessed thing to give then to receive
indeed it's sometimes a more blessed thing to

give then to have and enjoy
take one that hath great power to do good and no love what is he but like a meer iron chest a fountain sealed now god is most ready to do good it's his glory
it's said in prov
that the desire of a man is his kindness
the desire of a man that is that which is most to be desired the most precious thing in a man that thing which makes him desireable that renders him glorious and beautiful is his kindness that he is a kind man such an one wears a crown and garland upon his head
this crown god wears above all the desire of god is his kindness
and to make it yet more apparent that an interest in god is most attainable consider

that by which we come to have an interest in another is usually the manifestation of our desire with the tender of our love and affections to him and this is best done and with most efficacy with god for the breathings and operations of a mans spirit lie more open to him then to any creature
one may wish to another and may want skill to make his mind known but you cannot have an ingenuous and hearty wish in your souls that god were my god but he hears it and knows it he hears spirits and reads spirits as we do words
in psal
my groanings are not

hid from thee
if thou lovest god and thine heart be towards him he needs no interpreter or to tell him what thine heart is
the apostle saith he knows the meaning of the spirit when it can but sob and sigh within it self that god were my god he knows the meaning of that language rom
when christ asked peter lovest thou me lord saith he thou knowest that love thee

add to this that there cannot be that assurance of speeding upon the manifestation of our spirits to any as there is with god
may make my mind known to another for the enjoyment of his friendship yet may fail and come short of it but now if come to god with an ingenuous and sincere desire to have god to be my god shall not fail in that
you seek many things in vain but god never frustrates his poor people in their desires after him he crosseth them in many of their other desires but never in that if he be so good that he satisfies the desire of all things of every living creature as in psal
much more will he satisfie desires after himself for these are from his best love they spring from his own bosom and he'l be sure to bless them they shall attain their end

other desires may be satisfied with other

things if you cannot have one thing another thing may serve you in its stead if a man cannot have this friend he may have another but we must either have gods love and his friendship or we dye for ever
he hath engaged himself that those that thirst after him shall never go without him the word stands upon record the lord jesus christ spake it from his father blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be satisfied in mat
and let him that thirsteth come in revel

indeed these desires are given not only to be as a byass or principle of motion in our souls after god but are planted in our souls as indubitable pledges of his love and of his habitation there
other things are first desired and then obtained but god is first ours before he be desired
divine love works downward it begins in heaven and that communion that is wrought between god and us begins in himself and from himself he loves first and speaks first and our love is but the answer of his love if we can say to god lord am thine this is but the eccho of what he hath said first am thine
so in zech
latter end will say saith god thou art my people and they shall say thou art my father
oh this assurance of obtaining mercy with god for

poor thirsty creatures it is the honey and milk of our souls our greatest joy and the satisfaction of our spirits in this life
they that seek god shall glorifie him if they seek once the next thing is praise their hearts shall live for ever
the manifestation of this grace mercy and goodness that is in god is the life of such as seek him
in isai
what shall say he hath spoken to me and himself hath done it shall walk softly all my years in the bitterness of my soul
lord by these things men live and in all these things is the life of my spirit so wilt thou recover me and make me to live
he speaks of gods goodness appearing to him in that act which was not a single but a compound act and it was not a meer natural good but a spiritual and inward communication of himself it took him much what shall say shall be at rest as one quieted and satisfied in spirit after my bitterness have had sorrow but now have seen the love of god towards me rejoyce was tumultuous before and unquiet and unsatisfied but now shall be satisfied
hitherto you have been looking upon the feasibleness of this interest that no interest is so attainable as interest in god
and if you will look once more consider how many bars there are to our interests with men and you shall see

how these things that are such impediments with us are of no force with god
many times a poor man a begger one in rags knows it would be his happiness to have an interest in such a prince but how shall he come at it in prov
solomon tells us the poor man is hated of his neighbor he is afraid if he should ask something of him he should burden him nay he is hated of his brother and though he speak with intreaties yet he is answered roughly what thou a begger and come so boldly to ask of me and yet we that are but poor beggers and in our rags may have free access to god
in prov
it is said all the brethren of the poor do hate him how much more will his friends depart far from him but god turns not back our prayers though we be poor and miserable yet our lord jesus christ is not ashamed to call us brethren heb

strangers have a bar in their way come to a great one know you not saith he never saw you before what have you to do to come to me therefore ruth was much taken with the kindness of boaz because she was a stranger to him
what are we but strangers and aliens afar off and yet he rejects us not when we come near him
god will not say to men know you not though they have been strangers except when they come too

late
in luke
saith christ strive to enter in at the strait gate for many say unto you shall seek to enter and shall not be able that is they seek too late
when once the master of the house is risen up and hath shut the door if then you come and say lord lord open to us he will say know you not
but seek him while the door is open while he may be found and he will be ready to receive you

impotent persons that are fit for nothing how shall they get an interest in great ones what can he do say they though it be but for a servants place
what would become of us if god should put that question to us he receives us when we are good for nothing fit for us nay when we were enemies then he was reconciled to us rom
now then you see that god hath received such persons indeed be never receives any other so that upon all accompts an interest in god is more attainable then any other interest
that's a second argument i'le name one more

interest in god is better enjoyed then any other interest whatsoever
there is no interest to be enjoyed with that sweetness security usefulness and consolation as our interest in god is
for besides that unspeakable and infinite fulness that is in god

know that this interest is not subject to any dissolution
interest in god now is better then it was in our first estate when we came out of gods hand
all other interests may cease if our love or others loveliness cease our interest is gone and the loveliness of every creature under the sun will have an end but god abides
take a man the most wise the most learned the most amiable the richest man all these things will pass away but our interest in god is not subject to any separation that is we shall be never from him
the absence of our friends is like the setting of the sun they are life to us in their presence but when they are gone from us they cannot help us they are so far dead to us but god is ever with us

interests with men are very exacting a man must do this and do that and much ado to please
men do tye up their interest so strait that except things be done at this time and after this mode we indanger a flaw
god doth not impose upon his people after this manner

and again other interests are apt to be tyred and so fall into a dull sleep of mutual forgetfulness because the goodness that is in us is but little a shallow cistern is soon drawn dry
but with god there is no difficulty at all to give out love and if he spend

himself never so much this way he is not at all diminished he rests in his love zeph
his joy and is always flourishing
so that as this interest is more attainable so it's better to be enjoyed

chap
ix

christians ought to clear their hopes from uncertainties
beleevers doubt through their own fault
they that seek god must pursue their end

that which follows next is exhortation that you would not only seek this interest and get it but that you would seek to know it and to be satisfied that you have indeed an interest in god
live not upon hopes mingled with uncertainties and anxieties let not this suffice it may be god is my god or hope he is but put it out of doubt
give all diligence saith the apostle to make your calling and election sure pet

sure as firm ground that you may so know it that there may be no trembling of heart about it that it may be a certain conclusion made up in your own spirits that you are the called and chosen of god
for if you do these things saith the apostle you

shall never fall but an abundant entrance shall be administred to you into his kingdom you shall never fall or as it is sometimes rendered you shall never offend so the apostle james chap
he that offends in one is guilty of all
indeed the sight of interest in god carries a man with more evenness and strength in his way and keeps him in more compliance with and conformity unto god
sometimes the word is rendered rom
have they stumbled that they should fall if a man know god to be his god he walks with a more even and steady foot all his ways are more plain before him mountains of difficulty and danger will be layd level there will be nothing to dash his foot against to hinder him in his race and an entrance in abundance will be administred to him into the kingdom of heaven fears and doubts straiten our way and hinder our passage to the kingdom of god
suppose a man were to go into an house where he fears he shall not enter this would very much hinder his endevor but when a man shall have a blessed prospect into heaven and see his place there that must needs further his more abundant and free entrance into it
but more particularly that may perswade you if god will to be very serious in this thing to make

your interest in god more certain let me tell you

in the first place that no man that beleeves in christ wants it but through his own fault say it is a mans own fault if he be not able to say that god is his god
speak now according to the ordinary course of god demeaning himself to his people
there is nothing of greater concernment either to his peoples welfare or the advancement of his own design which he hath upon them then the manifestation of his love and the satisfaction of their spirits in that great question whether god be their god
and that spirit upon whom lies the office of bringing from darkness to light hath this office also of refreshing and reviving the spirit and therefore bears that name the comforter he not only espouses us to christ but maintains a perpetual entertainment that is his work he is not only the bond of our union but the light of it by which we see our selves one with christ and so one with the father
many complain they find not god to be their god but it is not because god is not willing to shew himself what he is but because they are wanting to themselves
there are two great faults that oftentimes wrong us and keep us in the dark and make that seem a

secret which otherwise might lie open to our eyes

one error concerneth seeking

some seek not at all and never put the question whether god be their god but run the hazard live and dye venturing their souls to eternity
others complain they seek but they cannot find fain they would be satisfied in this thing but they cannot now say the complaint must fall upon our selves there is perhaps a fault in our seeking
this is the word that must stand fast for ever god will be found of them that seek him in jer
then you shall find me when you seek me with all your heart
to seek with all the heart is not only to seek truly and sincerely some seek but in words only making verbal prayers without any inward sense but to seek him strongly above all things and not only from an ardent thirst of spirit but to seek him without ceasing till we find him
in due time we shall reap if we faint not gal

the rule of scripture you know is this that we pray incessantly thes
mark that in hos
after two days will he revive us and in the third he will raise us up then shall we know if we follow on to know the lord his going forth is prepared as the morning and he shall come unto us as the rain as the former and latter rain unto the earth
if

you follow on if you follow the business you shall obtain god hath appointed his going forth as the morning that is as the sun riseth and fails not as the sun goes forth in its light and grows so will gods appearance to his people be and as the rain comes upon the thirsty earth and causeth all things to spring afresh so shall the manifestation of gods love be to those that seek him without ceasing
what if god appear not presently and you have not that full answer to your desires though he come slowly yet he will be sure to come his staying is not a denyal and his not shewing himself is not an hiding himself he is uncovering himself and making way for the appearance of that which you would fain have a sight of he stays a while to make his love the more visible afterward by his absence he raiseth the mind and enlargeth the heart to desire and long after his presence and then his manifestation will be fullest
god is as ready nay more ready to open then you are to knock he loves that thirst in you which is after himself he loves to be loved let him be pleased as well as you
it may be seeking christians are not so ingenuous as they should be we are not to seek him only but to please him
psal
blessed are they that keep his testimonies and that seek him with

their whole heart that seek him and his love and keep his law
or it may be offences have been but not bewailed impotency is the continuation of sin you are ever doing that evil which you have not been humbled for nothing nulls it but repentance and humbling your selves in the sight of god
with what face can you say to god let thy love lord be upon me when as you cannot say to god lord love thee that man cannot say he loves god that desires not to please him
can he say his heart is with god who suffers his heart to go out after other things why should he desire so to impose upon god that god should love him whom he desires not to love and please it is unreasonable
what father would be so dealt with that the child walking in stubborn courses would have his father shew nothing but clearness of countenance and love to him david all the while he was under clouds of guilt and sorrow wished that god would shew forth the light of his countenance to him but he suffered many wrackings in his soul till he confessed his sins psal
what god hath said he will have fulfilled
heaven and earth shall pass away but not one tittle of his promise
if he hear not it is not because he is not a god hearing prayer but because you

hear not him
isai
said not unto the seed of jacob seek ye me in vain the lord speak righteousness declare things that are right speak as mean my words and my heart agree in one
what ever our offences have been if we be ingenuous in our approaches to god god will not look upon our offences but upon our persons in chron

you have this promise if my people that are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
if thy soul be sick and thou mournest after god that hideth himself from thee and humblest thy self and repentest of thy sins with abasedness of spirit before him he will hear

chap


god hath fully made known whom he loves
christians able to know themselves
gods spirit strengthens the testimony of our spirits
christians hindered by slothfulness and discouragements

a second fault is that god doth give the manifestation of his love and we

receive it not we accept it not
will for the more full clearing of this lay down these considerations

first that god hath given to his people sufficient means for the knowledg of their interest in him for he hath told us who they are that he loves whom he hath chosen and called out of this world and made his peculiar people
if he had carried on a design of love to particular persons in his own brest no man could have known who was loved of him then we had been left in the dark for no man knows the things of a man but the spirit of a man as the apostle speaks
but as the angel marked those in jerusalem that were to be spared so there is a mark that god hath set upon his own by which they may be known to what fold and flock they do belong
and indeed the end of the scripture so discovering and setting forth the marks of the people of god is for this purpose that we may know our happiness
so in joh
this was the end of writing his epistle these things saith he have written unto you that beleeve on the name of the son of god that you may know that you have eternal life and that you may beleeve on the name of the son of god
wherefore was it that he had told them how many ways they might know that god dwelt in them

and they in god wherefore did he make so many descriptions of those whom god had set his love upon but that you may know saith he that you have eternal life because you are such

and he hath not only done thus but hath given us understanding also by which we are able to know not only other things but our selves by which we may judg our selves and our actions and what is within us
neither hath he given us an understanding meerly natural but it is raised being illuminated with his own light that we may be able to find out the work of god in us an understanding that can reflect upon it self not only in way of simple vision and apprehension of what is within us but by way of argumentation and reasoning joh
hereby we know that we know him if we keep his commandments and whoso keepeth his word in him verily is the love of god perfected hereby we know that we are in him
god hath given us understanding to reflect upon our selves in a way of reasoning to make certain to our selves our interest in these things
nay he hath given us his spirit that bears witness to our spirits that we are the sons of god rom
we must not think that was a special favor given to the saints then but it's common to all the people of

god
the spirit of adoption hath a double office of quickening and comforting and whosoever is a son hath the testimony of that spirit

there is a double testimony a testimony of the things themselves so that which is of god in us doth bear witness as the effect bears witness of the cause
there's another testimony and that is of god himself by his spirit and that testimony doth help our spirits it helps the testimony of the things themselves and clears them it leaves them without doubt it strengthens and fixeth fast the soul in the knowledg of its interest in god
god stands obliged for this unto his people for their comfort lies in it and that makes to the fulfilling of his last end which is his glory for how shall we give him praise if we know not that god is ours besides he hath given us visible seals to ratifie all the promises to us he hath given the earnest of his spirit to his he hath set christ on the throne for us an indubitable pawn of his love and many other which are still with us

secondly a second consideration is this that the people of god in the want of this knowledg and assurance do not what they may they do not improve that ability and

those means which god hath put into their hands and so they spin out their days in heaviness mourning and anxiety
either there is slothfulness of spirit or some discouragement of spirit upon them

slothfulness and so they are careless idle and vain having lost the sweetness of the enjoyment of god their hearts are poured out upon vanities they have gone a whoring after other things and have placed their souls upon things that will not profit and are not industrious to seek after god
when the soul is thus gone out from god then it commits folly under every green tree there's no plant that may yield any kind of refreshing but they will suck something from it whilest the soul is busied about other interests and securing them the other great business lies by
another sort are under discouragement they say the work is hard it's a very hard thing to find out this matter to do that whereby it should be found
saith another have endevored and sought and done all can and cannot compass it

consider you that say it is hard what a vain thing is it for a man to plead that a thing is difficult which must be done will you plead difficulty against necessity you must do it or your life will be as death you

will lose the comfort of all promises of all performances the promises will be as a sealed fountain that you cannot drink of them

but again it is false to say it is hard that false prophet within us communicates of his own spirit to us and we oftentimes speak untruths against god
is it hard to walk in the way of life is it hard to enquire after god is it easie to be hunting after the world and getting something in this life is it hard to reach after the fruit of the tree of life when you seek after god you are in that very way of life wherein they now are that shall enjoy god to all eternity

another discouragement is this have endevored but it is a fruitless thing see shall never be satisfied
poor soul wilt thou indulge that remissness of spirit that is in thee to a contradiction against the god of truth he hath said if thou seek him thou shalt find him he hath said he will comfort the mourners he hath spoken as much as can be desired what would you have god to do more rather blame your seeking then your success say not it is in vain to seek because have not found nay rather say because have not found therefore must seek more and seek better
what

saith christ in joh
if any man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him
if any man love me be he what he will be though he hath been a notorious wretch though he hath been a grief and burden to me and offended me days without number yet if he love me my father will love him and we will come and make our abode with him
will you rather blame the truth of the promise then your selves the fault must be layd on us let god be true and every man a lyar
it is manifest that we do not what we might do in these particulars


we do not call our minds in and bend them to this work of enquiring after god and setling this great question of our interest in god for ever
and indeed if we do not call in and bend our minds and use some enforcements upon them they will never do their work there is upon our minds anatural fluidness and dulness they go out easily to all things but unto god
the mind must be summoned prest bound and buckled to this work saith the apostle pet
this second epistle beloved now write unto you to stir up your pure minds to stir up your pure minds the apostle was afraid of them lest dulness and sluggishness should

fall upon their minds if you do not stir up your selves to the work and gird up the loyns of your minds the work will not be done

another fault is that as men do not bend their minds to the work so they do not hold them in a way of beleeving and cheerful expectation of what they seek for saith the church in micah
will bear the indignation of the lord until he plead my cause so long as seek the lord will wait and expect that he will hear me and answer my desires
in hos
saith the prophet sow to your selves in righteousness reap in mercy break up your fallow ground for it is time to seek the lord till he come and rain righteousness upon you
you must seek the lord till he come
in isai
this is the counsel of god by his prophet that you give him no rest until he establish and till he make jerusalem a praise

again there may be this fault we do not bring things to an effectual judgment
many queries are raised about this business but there is not a full hearing and determining of them but either the court breaks up before things are concluded and so the soul is left to hang upon a poor thred of a feeble hope hope god is my god or else the soul is contented to bear the burden

of many fears and sorrows not stirring up it self as it ought to get free of them
so that doubtless it's our fault that we have not so clear a knowledg of our interest in god as to make us to triumph or glory therein
one way or other we are defective either in our seeking of god or in our not receiving what god gives unto us

thirdly a third consideration is that we have often offended and sinned against the spirit and then god weakens his testimony towards us and doth not so make himself known to us as we desire
david by his sin brought himself into that sad condition that he knew not what to make of himself as appears by that prayer of his in psal
he lookt on himself almost as one in bonds estranged from god a man without spirit
in isai
saith god your sins have separated between me and you
certainly god leaves us very frequently and sometimes when the manifestation of his love is very needful
in micah
the time was an evil time and saith the prophet then shall they cry unto the lord but he will not hear them he will even hide his face from them at that time

a fourth consideration is that we do not seldom or not a little reject the testimony of god and oppose the light and the

clear manifestations of his love to us
the comforter comes many times but that may be said of us that he said of himself in psal
my soul refused to be comforted would not be comforted
as against the conviction of the spirit in wicked men there is a great deal of contest a great fight as in jer
also in thy skirts is found the blood of the soul of poor innocents have not found it by secret search but upon all these yet thou sayst because am innocent surely his anger shall turn from me say as wicked men rise up in opposition to the conviction of the spirit so good men likewise have their oppositions against the consolations and comforts of the spirit not only against the counsel of it but against the comfort of it
in isai
you have an instance of this see how sweetly god speaks behold these shall come from far sing heavens and be joyful earth and break forth into singing mountains for god hath comforted his people and will have mercy upon his afflicted
but what saith the church but sion saith the lord hath forsaken me and my god hath forgotten me
what ever god said yet she said god had forsaken and forgotten her
a like instance you have in lament

there are strong holds in our spirits against the inward comforts as there are against other operations

of the spirit and it requires the mighty power and operation of god to settle our hearts in peace as well as to convince us of our miseries and dangers
the work of conversion is quickly done because it is of greatest concernment i'le give it you in this simile
a mother finds her child among devouring hogs or dogs or what you will she makes haste to snatch her child out of danger but he is all bemoiled and dirted and his clothes she makes not so much haste to get him clean and to put other clothes upon him
so god quickly finisheth the work of conversion and regeneration he makes haste to free us from danger and misery but he makes not such speed to comfort us and to establish our hearts in the assurance of our interest in him that may be done at leasure

as there is a reluctancy in us against the work of grace so there's a reluctancy against the testimony of grace we are apt to turn all that god speaks and doth for us against our selves the reason is because dejection is most natural to us considering the state of our apostacy and what we are judged to
a slave doth naturally torment himself with fears and with sad expectations
it's easier to us to believe the sentence of condemnation then of justification sin is more visible

then grace
the greatness of the things promised are such that they make the soul at a stand to have pardon of sin to be adopted to be raised from the depth of misery to such a state of blessedness this makes the soul to be like those that dream besides there is a concurrence of forreign power to heighten all this

encouragements to endevor the clearing of our interest in god
love cannot hide it self
love will not deny what may be easily granted and is much needed

a second argument is taken from the encouragement we have to put us on to put this out of question that god is ours certainly there is more ease in this then we are willing to beleeve
speak it to the glory of god and our shame that the things which god hath spoken and done for our encouragement should be so great and high and yet we should lie so low in the satisfaction of our spirits about this question

first consider whatsoever excellency there is in any love that is in gods love transcendently
love is very fruitful it

brings forth much for those towards whom it is set it will not be hid it is compared to fire which is known by its heat and you shall know the warmth of love where it is
a man may use the words of solomon prov
which he speaks concerning the froward woman whoso hideth her hideth the wind and the ointment of his right hand which bewrayeth it self that as the wind cannot be concealed when it is up and as a sweet ointment cannot be concealed but it will discover it self so wrath and love for there is the like reason for both they cannot be hid
a friend is contented not to have his beneficence known he would do much more then his friend should know of but he would have his benevolence his love and known and manifested therefore the apostle ephes

saith he obtained this grace to shew forth among the gentiles the unsearchable riches of christ
near relations live upon the manifestation of love those which are more remote need less and less is due to them
the child will have but an ill life unless he have the light of his fathers countenance the husband and wife will have their life imbittered if there be not mutual love
as life is visible so is love it will discover it self and the highest love will most discover it self

a second encouragement is that what may be easily done may be easily obtained of a friend
what is more easie with god then to make us know that he is our god it is but one beam of light from heaven that doth it but a word spoken soul be of good comfort thy sins are forgiven thee
love stands not at small matters especially great love the love of god is the highest pattern of love and the most glorious spring of love all love flows from it therefore if the love of a creature can do so much how much more will the love of god do if your child should beg of you to give him a good look could you deny him would not your love constrain you and shal not the love of god much more certainly it is more for him to love you then to tell you he loves you he hath put forth his love already in a strange way to give his son for you and do you think he will be so unwilling to speak a word of peace to his people where it is duly sought

again where a thing is most needed where one stands in much need of what a friend can do for one that will be soon granted
what do you need more then refreshment of spirit in the sense of the love of god all the fears and tremblings of the hearts of his people are for want of the

light of his face
pharaoh daughter looking upon a strange child found her bowels and compassions moved within her
do you think gods compassions are not richer and fuller to his own a child sometimes may complain but it's not to the honor of his father my life is uncomfortable because my father loves me not shews not his love to me though perhaps there be cause for it and there is cause that god should deal so with us but he hath said he will not if we turn from the evil of our ways and repent he will multiply pardons isai

again a thing that may be easily done will not be denyed when it's asked when it's not only what we need but what we beg this christ shews in the parable of the unjust judg
importunity will move a stone how much more will the affectionate tears of an ingenuous child move the compassionate heart of a tender father

a third encouragement is that this is simply necessary to the right fulfilling of the law of our relation and to the enjoyment of the priviledges of it
what is thy relation to god but of a child to his father what law lies upon a child but to obey and that not as a slave but with a filial spirit
how can you be cheerful in your work when you have this cloud upon your spirits this pang

upon your souls know not whether god be my god

again the law of a child is to live a life of cheerful dependance upon his father but how can a man live thus upon god when he doubts whether god be his or no how can be confident to receive great things of a stranger much less of an enemy but god appears in these forms to me so far as he appears not to be my god
again this law lies upon a child to live with cheerfulness of heart upon his fathers fulness
this the scripture calls for we are to rejoyce and rejoyce evermore and with all joy colos

and in the worst times account it all joy when you fall into divers temptations jam

i'le add but this that those desires that are after god after the knowledg and assurance of his being our god are from himself god hath planted them in us and god hath invited called and set us a longing and a thirsting after him and will he tell us of a fountain of life and not let us drink of it will he call us to himself and when we come to him will he hide himself certainly we are very much mistaken when we go to god to beg this grace to have our souls refreshed with the sight of his love if we go ingenuously with a cheerful resignation

of our selves to him if we go not with a cheerful expectation that god will hear our prayer

chap
xii

they are not right who are careless to clear their evidence
wisdom and love make the saints seek after full satisfaction
two sorts of content in the want of god

a third argument is this if you seek not and that industriously and in earnest to put this question out of question you are not right
it's an evidence against a mans sincerity and his real fellowship with that invisible world when he is not careful to know what interest he hath in it
the saints desire nothing more with them there is nothing above the love of god that they seek and nothing beneath it that they can rest in
whom have in heaven but thee and there is none in all the world that desire in comparison of thee psal
david had whatsoever the heart of man could desire in this world he had all sorts of accommodations and contentments and yet he was still athirst till he could come to the and drink of the water of life he was

painfully athirst in psal
there are two great springs of these desires and tendencies of soul after god


a spirit of wisdom that represents god as he is in that amiableness and glory which takes them it represents him in goodness and greatness as one in whose hands all things are so that nothing is concluded to be of that concernment with them as to have god to be their god they that know thy name will put their trust in thee psal


the second is a spirit of love the saints have their hearts knit to god there is nothing which they so much prize as him they are taken with him above all things therefore cannot be content without him their desires after him are infinite till his infinite goodness fills up their whole capacities and leave no more place for hope till he hath blessed them with the full enjoyment of himself
you know reason in things of importance will not be easily satisfied
while we are in any doubt we have no rest
men must have things cleared to them that are of weight and much more should they in this which is the greatest of all
they say and cannot but say as david doth in psal
though his own spirit often told him that god was his god yet

he looks up to heaven and saith shew me a token for good
and so in psal
cause thy face to shine upon us and we shall be saved
the shining of gods face puts a man into a state above men and devils and all things

love is both eager in the prosecution of its end and very curious in its judgment
it is eager in the prosecution of its end it will not be easily put off it finds out its object and knows it and will not take a shadow for the thing if it be not satisfied it rouls restlesly and sinks and dyes in it self like noah's dove that fluttered up and down the world but found no rest for the sole of her foot
it is death to the man that loves god not to see that god loves him
they therefore are not right they are not believers in earnest there is not a through work upon their spirits that can dally with god and be at rest when they are not clear in this that god is their god
there be two very great evils in this thing

that such a man lives in contempt of god this is contempt to be content to be without god
that which know not to be mine am without that which know not to be mine is as if it were not if be content therefore to live so that know not god to be my god am content to be without god

there is a contentment that is opposed to murmuration to froward perturbation of mind and fretting this must not be no not in the midst of clouds and darkness and in the depth of our disputes about this great thing whether god be my god and my sins pardoned and whether my soul shall be saved and in case be not satisfied in the thing there must be a patient waiting for jesus christ and the glory of his appearance though we be mournful yet we must be patient quiet and humble as in isai
in the way of thy judgments lord we have waited for thee and the desire of our souls are unto thy name and the remembrance of thee with my soul have desired thee in the night yea with my spirit within me will seek thee early
and in isai
will wait upon the lord that hides his face from the house of jacob and will look for him or will stay for him till he come

there is another kind of contentment of dulness and stupidity from darkness which the soul and bears it down
now would argue thus the doubts thou findest in thy spirit are either weak or strong if they be not great but some little anxieties they are more easily overcome and thy fault is the greater that thou sufferest those clouds to remain which thou mayst so easily

scatter when the question is not much disputable when there is not much against it thou art the more negligent that thou dost not draw it to a full determination
it is with many christians as it is with a conquering army in a nation that hath beaten down all forces round about them only there is a weak party now and then appearing who cannot do much but when the militia in a commonwealth hath beaten down the enemy before them it cannot stand with their faithfulness to suffer the least party to remain in opposition to them no more can it stand with our faithfulness with god and our own souls to suffer the least party of doubts to continue but to make all clear and sure
we will not suffer the least flaw in a lease or any security for the things of this world

grant that we are like to live in disputes all our days
there's no vacation with a christian but always term time still suits strifes and contentions but you must strive to hold your own you must be employed to quench all the fiery darts of satan
as a man that is in possession of an estate when one comes and lays claim to one part of it and another comes and challenges another part and so a third and a fourth he keeps his suit a foot against them all and so holds

his own so must we go on conquering till we have subdued all fears and doubts that rise within us
satan is a cunning sophister as full of subtilty as he is of malice if he cannot draw men to gross prophaneness he will tempt them to fears and doubtings
now as holiness works against sinfulness so it strives against doubts
doubting is as truly a sin in a believer as any other miscarriage a good man cannot rest till he see all well
psal
by this know that thou lovest me
if he cannot lay hold on something to draw this conclusion he thinks himself a most miserable man

again suppose thy doubts be strong that thou canst not make out this that god is thy god if thou canst notwithstanding sit down and make a life of sweetness and contentment in other things thou contemnest god this shews you care not much for him for what a man cares for much that he loves much and what he loves much that he will have as near to him as may be therefore if thou goest sighing and mourning after other things and canst sit down with contentment in the enjoyment of other things this shews thou dost prefer other things before god and so dost contemn him
if you can live without his love you can live without his fear and what is more

horrid then for a man to live without the love and fear of god in jer
god argues this matter with his people fear ye not me saith the lord will ye not tremble at my presence who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree
but this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart they are revolted and gone neither say they in their heart let us now fear the lord our god that giveth the former and latter rain in his season
it is extream darkness that is upon you even the darkness of hell when you can live quietly in the enjoyment of other things without the knowledg of the love of god in christ
all that have known god to be their god when they are under doubts concerning this when they are under the frowns of god oh how do they mourn lay but your ears to their closets and hear their secret complaints who can measure their tears or number the sighs and groans that are found with them when they seek after god david in psal
tells you how it was with him he made his bed swim with tears and his moisture turned to dryness his strength was gone through the bitterness of his soul because he could not see the love of god as formerly
our lord jesus christ when that ineffable shadow was upon his spirit how did he cry out my god my god

why hast thou forsaken me it is therefore a contempt of god when you can be without the knowledg that he hath pardoned you and accepted you in his beloved

chap
xiii

those which seek not to clear their interest offer inexpressible violence to their own souls
how the sense of divine love gives strength to two useful principles of holy life

it will further appear that they are not right christians that can live without the knowledg of the love of god if we consider that such live in unexpressible violence offered to their own soul and in most horrid practises against themselves
to instance and clear it
are you content to live so basely and vile in this world when you know not that god is your god as to rob and spoil your souls of their truest life and to consent and yield to that evil disposition in them to live on things that are dead and that have but a shew of life the spirit of a man will fasten on something if the spring of his life be not in god if he have not life there he will seek it where he can find it
when cain went from the presence of the

lord he fell to building of cities
when demas forsook christ what did he imbrace even this present world
the prodigal when he went from his fathers house fell on something and what was it but hogs meat when the jews were driven from zion they made much of babylon
wilt thou see thy soul feeding thus upon vanities and not deal effectually with thy self to labor for that thou mayst return unto god say with thy self where am now what am doing is this to live on god is this eternal life know you not that your life lies in the sense and taste of divine love do you not find all other things to be dark and empty and will you suffer your souls against nature to live out of god when you are called to live on him who is the fountain of life may say unto you as eliphaz spake in job
are the consolations of god small to you and is it so light a matter to have the knowledg of the love of god and your interest in him in jer
the prophet speaks of spoiling and wasting but if it doth come saith he thy ways and thy sins have procured these things unto thee therefore know that it is an evil thing and bitter to forsake the lord
you may thank your selves if a day come wherein there will be bitterness to your hearts and

the pangs of death upon you because you know not that god is your god know that this is your wickedness because you will not now look after it and so you rob your souls
that is one thing


when you are not sedulous and industrious in this thing to make sure that god is your god you leave your selves in the high way of apostacy
what is that which will make us able to stand the apostle peter tells us pet

give all diligence to make your calling and election sure for if you do these things you shall never fall
you expose your selves to offences to stumbling and falling when you are content to live in the dark not knowing what interest you have in god
for consider you are now out of the shine of the sun you are in the cold evening shade your life is much weakened and your strength abated it is the knowledg of divine love that is the spirit and strength of our love this lays bonds upon our spirits by which we become one with god it is the wing of our souls the spring of our activity by which we are born up to an enjoyment of god
the joy of the lord is your strength saith nehemiah and by this paul was more then a conqueror yet paul had many enemies through this abraham was able to do so great things by this moses

was able to despise the wrath and favor of pharaoh and all the pleasures and riches of his court
while a man walks in the shine and sense of divine love he will feel a strength in two principles of great use


to cleave fast to the chief good now that chief good is god to that man that enjoys him he hath the truest taste that sees god to be his god and no man else hath such a taste as he this will hold him to god
where the creatures have but a judgment of sense they will not depart from what they find good a beast will not change his pasture for gold that is best for him
it's the astonishment of the world that the angels should fall from their state of glory and it's matter of amazement that man should fall from his creator when he had a full enjoyment of him
it's that which god calls heaven and earth to tremble at jer
that men should depart from him the fountain of living water
the sense of acceptation with god makes a man that he cannot go from god whither shall we go saith peter joh
thou hast the words of eternal life
that soul that lives under the influence of divine comforts cannot but say lord it's good for me to be here he desires no change it cannot be better with him change proceeds from want

for if want were not the creature would not change
that soul that enjoys god is pleased and he saith with david psal
he hath a good portion and his lines are fallen in a good place nothing is dear to that man to part with that he may enjoy god he bids all things stand by and saith charge you wife and friends estate and all things do not molest me in my enjoyment of the light of gods face let all the world go which way it will let me enjoy this blessedness to know assuredly that god is my god
when a man lives without this knowledg his life is but a poor shadow of life all without god is but a dead thing to him

another principle receiving strength from the knowledg of gods love and our interest in him is that a man should be friendly to his friend that he should walk with an harmony of spirit to his friends desire love pleaseth not it self
now when a man enjoys the sweetness of friendship with god this makes him true to his maker and to cleave close to god as to his father indeed the sense of this constrains the apostle cor
saith the love of christ constrains us
how can do this evil saith joseph and sin against my god but now if thou be careless and canst make a shift to live know not how a dull stupid dark

sensless kind of life thy heart not witnessing that thou endeavorest to make good thy interest in god thou art not under the bond of love and then what art thou under other lovers have taken away thy heart but as for god thou art a stranger to him and art contented to be without him this is a woful state
and as a man that lives out of the shine of divine love starves and wastes away so fears in this case are apt to turn into hatred when the soul is gall'd and tormented with fears of the displeasure of god against him this is apt to turn to hatred
naturally whom we fear we hate and naturally the stronger fear is the more men hate
the devils hate god to the full being past doubting of his displeasure
what the soul fears it flies from and what is the flight of the soul but hatred judas would chuse rather to go out of the world and sink into nothing then endure his condition when he saw god not to be his god
i'l shut up this argument with these few things

all that is in a christian makes to this that he would get a clear knowledg of his interest in god
hath he faith why by that he believes god to be his happiness and that will put him on hath he love love is restless but in clear enjoyment hath he desire and thirst what are they but

the souls sickness till it hath health and life in the enjoyment of god hath he fear what is that but the soul seeking to be secure and safe in god hath he reason what's that but the voyce of god calling him unto god hath he a sense of the sweetness of god what's that but the comfort of divine love drawing the soul to himself so that all that is in a christian puts him on to this to make this clear that god is his god
and therefore they that can rub out their days and make a shift to busie themselves in other things without the knowledg of god to be their god have great cause to pronounce this heavy sentence upon themselves that surely they are separated from the love of god
so have done with the third argument

chap
xiv

the evil of doubting as it is a denyal of the truth of god a diminution of his love and favors and a of his dispensations
the vexation of doubting to enlightened persons in an evil day

a fourth is this doubts in this case are very sinful and grievous especially to

a soul in light and to a soul in trouble
to clear this will shew first that they contain in them exceeding great evil against god in these things


they are contrary to the truth and faithfulness of god they are a denyal of the truth of god manifested in the promises and by the testimony and witness of his spirit god hath made our way open to himself and we are apt to say most wretchedly as the church in lament

he covereth himself with a cloud that our prayers should not pass through
he hath left upon you perhaps some marks of his love he hath put into you some earnest of his favor what are these but the voyce of god from heaven that god is your god and yet you say as the church in her frowardness the lord hath forsaken me and my god hath forgotten me

again it is not only opposite to his truth but to his love
when a friend comes to one passionately affected in suspicion of his friendship and saith to him sir love you you are very dear to my heart and he will not beleeve him he takes it ill
god may say to us in the matter of his love as he said to them in the matter of obedience what could have done more god may say have given them the knowledg of my self

have given them a heart to love me have given them all the pledges of my dear love and yet they will sit down in corners and spend and waste themselves in mourning because love them not what can do more in deut
god took it ill when his word could not be taken and when the manifestation of his love was of no force yet in this thing ye believed not the lord your god who went in the way before you to search out you a place to pitch his tent in surely saith god there shall not one man of this evil generation go to see that good land that would not believe me
it may be our hearts may be somewhat like jobs in job
saith he if have called and he hath answered me yet will not believe that he will harken to my voyce
what a strange thing is this though he hath heard me when came to him and hath given me entertainment of a father and did receive pledges of his love yet will not believe that he loves me and that he will hear me

again they are diminutions of divine favors he that doubts his interest cannot so bless god in the enjoyment of wife children and estate and whatsoever carries sweetness in it but bitterness of soul overflows and makes all things bitter and he is apt to overlook all who is not perswaded of

his interest in god
in esth
you read of the froward spirit of haman and such a spirit is usually in him that feareth what is all this to me seeing mordecai sits still at the gate

another evil against god is that these doubts cause of all divine actions they make a man god in all things whatsoever he saith or doth god shall not be taken aright by that man that doubts his interest in him
job how wert thou mistaken and what meanest thou to speak those words job
wherefore hidest thou thou thy face from me and holdest me for thy enemy why did god ever take thee for his enemy so many because god crosseth them in their desires and frustrates them in their hopes say they god is angry with me he doth not love me
might tell you the same in other dispensations of god indeed that man cannot be pleased
now we may consider how painful and vexing doubting is in that man that is alive that is in a living state and especially in an evil day there are these three things that clear it


this is a matter of greatest consequence it's a business of the greatest weight
see you not a man sometimes how heavily he

walks when his estate is in question but much more when his life is in question but what if his life and estate too be in question that man that knows god truly would rather endure the loss of ten thousand lives and estates then the loss of gods favor


another thing that makes it exceeding heavy is the loss of the sweetness of former experience
david in psal
complains of this when remember these things pour out my soul in me for had gone with the multitude went with them to the house of god with the voyce of joy and praise with the multitude that kept
and job in chap
that it were with me as in the days of old and in months past as in the days when god preserved me when his candle shined upon mine head and when by his light walk'd in darkness as was in my youth when the secret of god was upon my tabernacle and when the almighty was yet with me
thus that man that loseth the sweetness of his former experience remembers the days of old and that afflicts him

again god will have it so that where this thing is not yet driven home and the soul hath not duly sought and so not found satisfaction concerning his love it shall be bitterness to him say god will have it so the soul shall not enjoy it self
he doth

this partly to give a demonstration of his own excellency and to vindicate it in the soul that a man may surely know and find that there is none like him therefore saith he will take away the light of my face from that man he shall have his house and land and estate and see what he will do with them what he can make of them and by this the love and favor of god appears to be excellent

besides this god loves his people he will have their love and will have his love sweetened to them therefore it shall be bitterness to them when it is lost
be perswaded then to make this your work and rest not till you know that you have interest in god plead with david in psal
lord say unto my soul thou art my salvation not only be my salvation but say thou art my salvation and then though you may have many sad thoughts accompanying you yet this will refresh you in the midst of all as it did david in psal
in the multitude of my thoughts thy comforts delight my soul

interest in god more knowable then any other and yet unknown to most the reasons of both

before propound the directions how they who are sincere and ingenious toward god and indeed have him for their god may know that they have a sure interest and propriety in him will premise two things of moment
first that our interest in god is more knowable then any other interest in the world there is no interest that a man hath which is so discernable whatsoever it is that belongs to an interest in any thing or any friend and doth discover it is much more here
examine it in a few particulars


where there is an interest with men there is a mutual closing of their spirits by which they know one another and come to rest secure in each others good intentions and hearty wishes
here also is this mutual closing and in a far more high and excellent degree then is or can be with any creature for that affection and love which god discovers to his people and which he doth act

upon them is a love that is transcendent that is not only beyond all other love but beyond all understanding that entire closing that is between a beleever and god in jesus christ is above all that which can be found in any other his whole soul runs this way
in psal
have sought thee saith david with my whole heart
that is the proportion which god hath cut out for himself
deut
thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might
christ challenges the same proportion and indeed it should not be less less would not fulfil his end which is the solid peace and satisfaction of his people in the enjoyment of him and also the subjecting and subduing of their spirits to his government no proportion of love loss then the greatest could work these things

but besides this there is such a through change by reason of this interest as no interest in the world doth work though the closest and the nearest for the habit and disposition of the spirit of a man is altered in closing with god and he becomes a new creature he is not what he was
it is true that in all friendship that is with men there is a kind of change on both sides because there must be a due and necessary application of themselves to each others spirits

but that change is unspeakably inferior to this in those who have been wrought upon to beleeve and have obtained this mercy to close with god for they are changed to the proportion of as great a distance as death is distant from life and darkness from light for they are brought off from the love of all that on which their hearts were set even to a hatred of it and are subjected subordinate and conformed to the will of god

there is another thing in this interest which belongs to the nature of it and so discovers it and that is a mutual conversing with each other with contentment
jonathan and david had much pleasure in their mutual conversings with each other and in drawing forth their spirits one to another
this is much more strong in beleevers then can be in any relation between husband and wife or between the father and child
this must needs be so

for first the love wherewith they love god is the highest love therefore many will not go for christians that pretend to be such because their hearts are not brought up to this
the highest love acts highest it takes the highest delight and contentment in its object
in cant
as the apple trees among the trees of the forrest so is my beloved

among the sons sat down under his shadow with great delight
in psal
saith david it is good for me to draw near to god that look as others find contentment in the things they love and draw near to them so the saints find much more contentment with god and therefore draw near to him

again friends cannot always enjoy these converses oftentimes they are parted and so cannot have this felicity of expressing mutual love but god is ever with them
in psal
thou art my strong habitation to whom may have a continual resort may always come to thee


there is a third thing in interest and that is mutual communication
love is a spring which flows forth it doth enjoy what it hath rather for its friend then for it self gods love hath this excellency more abundantly and transcendently
take the dearest friends that live at the highest rate of love they cannot maintain a constant communication partly because there is not always an equal necessity and capacity partly because there is not always the same power to give forth
but our necessities are always very great and vast and gods power is always the same so that here is always a perfect communication of love that ceaseth

not but flows forth as beams of light from the sun

now as effects discover their causes so then especially when they are most full and perfect
as you may better know any tree by its fruit then when it is in the bud and blossoms and you may better know it when the fruit is in its fulness and in more abundance then when there are but a few if there be but one or two upon a tree they may be hid but when there are many the testimony is the more abundant abundant are the testimonies of the fruits of gods love in what he hath done for his
so that upon this account no interest is more knowable then that of a beleever in his god

secondly a second thing to be propounded is this that though no interest be more knowable yet ordinarily no interest is less known then this
this we need not prove think it's a question out of question with us all
the unevenness of the holiness of beleevers in their walkings the inconstancy of their rejoycing are two strong demonstrations of this that they do know but little of their interest in god
it springs from such unhappy causes as these that abiding unbelief that bitter root that hath taken such strong hold of the nature of man that till the whole house be pull'd down it

will not be wholly eradicated and destroyed this is that weight the apostle speaks of in heb
that hangs on us so fast as is manifest by the apostle's scope who perswading unto faith and the workings of faith this is that saith he that so suppresseth and bears us down from those heights of heavenly joy from that sweet contentment and rest of spirit whereto we are called

beleeving is the first stone that is layd in a christian
he that comes to god must beleeve that he is and that he is a rewarder of those that seek him hebr
and as there is a spirit in all beleevers that tends to the setling of them upon a sure foundation that they may stedfastly beleeve so there is a spirit that works to unbelief perplexity and dissettlement
while unbelief works in us it must needs be that there will be a great want of that through knowledg of interest

another cause of this great misery of man is that gods communications of himself to us and entertainments of us are not always in intelligible forms so that we cannot presently take them up and understand the meaning and of god in them
the fault is in our minds
the print is good but cannot be read because the eye is dull and dark
sometimes god comes to us wrapt up

in clouds and indeed he varies his dispensations that he may attain his end his end is this that he may work his people to a strength of faith and love mixt with fear that's the proper constitution of a christian and the truest temper of one that is marked out to eternal life
therefore god sometimes displays his greatness in the sight of his people far above all the manifestations of the sweetness of his mercy that the spirit of a poor man is overborn shakes and trembles at the presence of god so it was with moses heb
the sight was so terrible though god meant no ill to moses that moses shakes and quakes for fear he was sore afraid
sometimes god comes with the manifestations of his fatherly displeasure and dislike and then how can it be but the soul must dwell in bitterness mourning heaviness and trembling must needs possess us

a third cause why so little is known of this interest that god is our god though he be so is our unhappy diversions
we are oftentimes turned off from that one thing necessary and our spirits run otherways out of light into darkness
alas solomon minded not this matter or to little purpose when he poured out his soul after vanities and for this god pleaded with him king


that he had departed from him the lord was wrath with solomon because his heart was turned from the lord god of israel who had appeared to him twice

chap
xvi

how the knowledg of blessed interest in god may be attained
desires to have the question determined
a spirit free to yield to the determination
arguments proper for the deciding of the question
those that have an interest in god are much in holy resignation
of taking answers when they are given

these things being premised now come to shew you how we may attain this blessed knowledg that god is ours and so quiet our hearts in this assurance that he is our portion

first let it be the true desire of thy soul to have this question determined and concluded that god is thy god
certainly many are careless concerning this business that never much debate the matter whether god be their god or no
others there are that have care enough but it is a perplexed care a care sowred with unbelief there is a desire indeed raised but it's mixed with perturbation

the soul is indeed in motion after it but it is a very disorderly motion working with fretting and such disturbing fears that they leave themselves without judgment
exod
it is said concerning the children of israel that when moses spake to them they would not hear him for their anguish of spirit and for their cruel bondage for the shortness and straitness of their spirits
fears do straiten

secondly a second means is this come with a spirit free to yield to the determination of truth one way or other take your answer from god as he shall give it
certainly there are a generation that know that they are very partial and foolish in this business that fly from the decision and determination of this question from a secret strong suspicion that all is not well with them and therefore they will rather flatter themselves with the uncertainty of their own estate then affright themselves with the clear knowledg of their unhappy condition
as a guilty prisoner fears to think of the time of judgment because he knows there is just cause of suspicion that it shall go ill with him
poor man what shall it profit thee to carry things thus if god be not thy god what hurt is it for thee to know it he that lives thus refuseth the judgment of

god and as much as in him lies hates the judgment of god
there can be no greater evidence of a right spirit then for a man to put the question home whether god be his for that man is not willing to be the lords that is not willing to have it determined whether he be his or no

some again are so possessed and overcome with fears so ready to to what ever may afflict and oppress them that they wrap themselves up in thick clouds lest any light should spring forth upon them these are like unjust judges that are precipitant in their proceedings that hear only one party
it is a dangerous thing for a man to mistake in judgment as the speaks concerning civil judgment prov
he that justifies the wicked and condemns the just even they both are an abomination unto god
you displease god and sin against truth and righteousness when you bear down your selves and pronounce a sentence of death upon your own souls when god hath passed the sentence of life and peace upon you you cross the design of jesus christ which is a design of love and peace you offer violence to that light reason and spirit which god hath set up in you you tempt god to say as you do and to make good your words
be therefore

willing to hear what god shall say to you as they in acts
said to peter we are all here ready to hear the things that are commanded thee of god

thirdly a third means is to proceed and argue by proper mediums by such arguments as are proper to the question
some work themselves into a good opinion by false discourses concluding upon insufficient grounds that god is their god either from an empty appearance of good or else from a real presence of the life of such things as may flow from other principles then the spirit of adoption as the fear of god mourning for sin subjection of spirit to the commands of god which things indeed are good but may flow from another spring then the spirit of adoption

but if you would conclude in a right way of reasoning that god is your god argue then by such things as are proper to that state and relation wherein you suppose your selves to be toward god and that is in one word a spirit of true love you shall find that working thus it will carry thy soul in propensions towards god equal to thy consolations the soul that loves is carried unto god with desires equal to its refreshings yea and more for when it cannot taste the comforts of the almighty yet it is

carried after him in desires and saith lord will love thee though thou wilt not love me
this love also will work resignation of our selves to god equal to all our enjoyments and expectations from god
david was much taken with gods love to him that tendred him in his distresses but withall saith he lord am thy servant psal
he gave himself to god in the sense of the sweetness of that mercy he had from god
yea this will exceed also for he will give himself to god when he knows not but that god hath hid himself from him
this love will work equal melting of spirit with rejoycing of spirit and fill a man equally with shame and joy
true love makes a man as happy in sorrowing as in rejoycing and he never more abounds in godly sorrow then when he abounds in the manifestation of gods love to him
in psal
you may see how david was taken after he found mercy with god see how he breaks forth detesting his own nature and the natures of all men he compares them to the horse and mule like asaph in another case so brutish was and ignorant as a beast before thee
now if you would know whether god be your god what do you find of such a spirit in you

some conclude too well in a false way

by false arguments
some indeed too who beleeve conclude too ill to their own wrong by mistakes also as because they find their feet slipping and their ways not so even therefore they conclude their spirits are crooked and there is no streightness in them whereas it is not the action but the disposition whereby we should judg our selves nor is it this or that tripping that discovers a man but the inward frame of his spirit

again they conclude surely god is not my god because feel my love so faint my faith so feeble whereas it is not the degree but the truth of grace that must discover our estates

fourthly a fourth means is this labor to be more full in closing with god and in the resignation of your selves to him and in conversing with him in all delightfulness and in whatsoever it is that shews your interest in god for as there is a light in all these by which they bear witness of themselves and of your happy state so the fuller and stronger they are the more clear full and vigorous is their testimony
a tender plant newly springing from the ground doth not so well discover what it is as when it is grown up to a full body now it is easily known
this is certain things are more

significant as they are more perfect
a little smoak discovers fire but more smoak is more full in its discovery this the apostle peter intimates pet

if these things be lacking if men be but weak in these if men be not only not sound but little in these they are they cannot well discern things their judgments will be very much clouded and darkened in the things that concern their peace
be frequent therefore in those works that discover your interest be frequent in conversing with god frequent in expressions of the sincerity of your love for it is with god as it is with us discoveries of our love make discoveries of his love
when say to a friend sir love you you are dear to me and am wholly yours his heart opens to me and there is an eccho in his spirit to my love
when you come to god and say father am thine and will be thine wholly thine and always thine if your love can make you say so to god much more the love of god will make him say so to you thou art mine
in zech
they shall say thou art our god and will say thou art my people
therefore be much in this

fifthly be true to your interest walk with a streight spirit make streight paths to your feet for upon such shall peace be psal

great peace have they that keep thy laws
god bears the clearest testimony where there is most excellent walking
usually his testimony is according to the measure of grace as the of the spirit also is and as god comes with the most terrible convictions upon highest transgressors so he comes with sweetest consolations to those that walk most evenly
uneven walking carries a shew of insincerity and puts a difficulty upon beleeving
david had much ado in this case to conclude himself to be gods was a shattered man and had lost his confidence
the conscience of guilt to an unbeleever is deadly and even to a beleever it is a wound
you put a sword into your enemies hand when you walk not uprightly you arm your unbelief against your selves that is too strong without your help
this is certain that no hope conquers fear but that which conquers sin for they have both one foundation
if therefore now you would know and would walk in this light that god is your god then you must walk uprightly and faithfully in your interest

lastly take answers of love when they are given you and keep them treasure them up as most precious things bless jesus christ by whom it is that you enjoy them and suffer

not the great question of thy soul to be always in agitation suffer not thy self to be brought to endless disputes when the cause is once heard and concluded
it is as well sinful to make voyd the grounds of our consolations as to break the bonds and cords whereby god holds us to obedience
you put gold no more to the when it hath once passed the furnace you say it is gold
suffer not your selves to be tossed in whirls of amazement when god hath said he is your god
it is true indeed there will be objections and they cannot be shunned they are often injected yet these things must sometimes pass undisputed
mark the season when these things are disputed in your souls commonly at the worst season when a man is at greatest disadvantage
when job spirit was disturbed you know what amazement he fell into and what advantage did it take of him

another season is the season of transgression
the devil so works in our unbeleeving hearts that we oftentimes put that to the question that god before hath put out of question
offences should not work in us amazement and fear of our former bondage but they should work in us brokenness and shame
lord pardon me saith david for

my sin is very great
the greater our transgression is the more we should have recourse to god and his goodness but by no means fly from him
certainly gods design is to break sin by sin and his aym is to the devil in his own bow
oh they love much to whom much is forgiven
the end of this discourse is that you would be serious solemn and impartial in debating of this business for when god hath cleared the matter it is to thy hurt to bring it about to be disputed again

what it is to live upon god as our god
no other life appointed for saints
the fulness beauty and satisfaction of this life
how christians offer violence to their relation

in this chapter would make exhortation to all that have interest in god to live upon it only first will shew what it is to live upon god as our god
and it is

first to cleave to god with joy of heart to live in the affectionate embraces of god in christ and delightful conversings with him to have god for our life as it is said of jacob concerning benjamin his soul his life

was bound up in the life of the child gen
that is they had one lot if one lived the other lived their joys were the same they could not be severed or parted they were but as one so we should be towards god our lives should be so bound up in him we should be one with him

secondly to live upon god is to contract all our desires into god to have none but what are for him and according to him
this is the way of life indeed when god is a mans all when the language of his soul is whom have in heaven but thee thus to have desires to god that he rests not in any thing beneath god nor seek any thing besides god that is to live in god
thirdly to live in a faithful real resignation of ones self unto god
if you be his you know that he hath taken chosen and set apart the good man for himself psal
and so must we live as sequestred persons as those that are his that as the holy things of the temple were for no other use so must we be only for god
in hos
tis said thou shalt abide with me many days thou shalt not play the harlot thou shalt not be for another man but shalt be unto me so will also be for thee
god will stand close to that spirit and be the comfort stay and life of it that reserves it self for him

fourthly it is to contract and draw all your expectations upon god to lay all your weight there
if there be any thing thou promisest thine own heart let it be from the bosom of god if there be any answer that thou makest to the fears doubts and troubles of thy spirit let it be from the voyce of the lord
thus david in psal
he only is my rock and my salvation he is my defence shall not be greatly moved
and he saith at vers
my soul wait thou only upon god for my expectation is from him
he tells you what god is to him and what indeed he looks for from god what god is to him he is my rock and my salvation in god is my salvation and my glory he is the rock of my strength
he tells you also what he expects from god my refuge is from him so that if need safety or refreshing and supply of any good mine eye is upon him and from him look for all
this is to live upon god
having expressed in a few words what it is to live upon god now take those considerations which perswade to live such a life as this

first there is no other life for you this is appointed for you to this you are called for this you are fitted
fishes may as well live in the ayr as you live in the world
you

may try and weary out your selves in vain but god is your life
this be sure of if you neglect this life either dulness and benumedness will fall upon you so that you will grow sensual brutish and earthly strangers to the joy activity and tenderness of holy christians or you shall fall into a an unsufferable unquietness of spirit while you are as a rouling thing in the wind having no consistence because you are out of your place
you shall be afflicted within and this will be your great evil that you lived not in god and now because you seek life in other things you shall dig for your own death
and if you have any reason it will work to your own affliction vex and torment your souls night and day because you did not walk in the counsels of the most high and the embracements of his love your sweetest enjoyments will be all sowred like the waters of jericho bitterness will be in them not to be endured

secondly this is a life that should be most pleasing and amiable unto our spirits and certainly we are dead and alienated from god if there be not an incomparable sweetness to us in it
for


it is the fullest life
the life of all other things hath something mixed with it the life of your enjoyments your pleasures

and relations is a mixt life there is death in all your comforts and you taste it and are sick of it many times you know it well
it is true there is nothing that god hath made and appointed for our use but brings in some portion of life our garments give a little and our food a little and friends give something but how little do all these give but now this life is all life the life you have from other things is a short poor narrow life but this life is more compleat
take the life of a man that hath whatsoever his heart can wish his comforts strike but upon his sense or at best have but some light touch upon his spirit alas the souls of men cannot drink at these cisterns life that comes from these things hath not immortality in it such things are as far from immortality as they are from sufficiency
the wisest the richest and most honorable that have the fullest life dye because the life they have by such things cannot hold pace with the soul nor communicate a life of consistency but the life we have with god extends to the whole course and capacity of the soul it fills up every corner and leaves no want


it is a life that gives perfect satisfaction he can ask no more that hath it


it is a life that beautifies the soul
mens

complexions usually are as their dyet is oh he that feeds on god what a rare complexion is his soul of it makes him like to god it reduceth a soul from a miserable separation into a blessed and orderly union
our life being in one god one good which is all good he that lives this life would dye ten thousand deaths rather then part with it
thou well knewest peter what thou saidst in joh
when christ said to his disciples will ye also go away then simon peter answered to whom shall we go lord thou hast the words of eternal life
whither dost thou think we can go when we knew thee not we could indeed be without thee but now we know thee whither shall we go when nature comes to a state of consistency it rests it seeks no more that man is in such a state that is in god that enjoys him and his love and rests in him he lives in an holy contentment and a glorious rest in all things that are according to god and in a hatred of all things that are in opposition to god
if any thing come into the ballance with god if it be like god he loves it but if it be contrary to god he hates it having once drunk of the new wine he desires not the old harsh spiritless wine

you may remember the catalogue of

saints in hebr
when you are come to their pitch then god will be dear to you and there will be a flatness upon all things else
the life of every thing is according to its compass and the thing by which it is maintained
men have a better life then beasts for they have better things to live on princes live better lives then beggers and angels then men because they have better things to live on
now then if your life be in god you have the best and sweetest life
we judg of lives in the world by the contentment they have that live in them now in this life you find innumerable angels the spirits of just men made perfect jesus christ lives this life and thinks it enough he desires no better life god himself lives this life he lives in himself

thirdly a third thing is that if you do not maintain this life you offer unspeakable violence to that blessed station and happy relation wherein god hath set you
one of these two things you must needs acknowledg

if you live not on god god is not your portion you have not taken him for your god you have not clos'd with him and then you are undone


or this must be granted if you have closed with him you wrong god and your

selves extreamly because you live not on him
hath god taken you and have you taken him hath he said to thee my spouse and hath thy soul said to him my lord and my husband and shall we live upon other things and not upon our husband shall the child live on strangers bread and not upon his father shall the son of a prince hang as a begger upon others doors and be a stranger to his fathers love to his fathers house and fulness this is certain that so far as you do this you are not children but prodigals in luke
last dead and lost
while you are out of god and your hearts set on other things you are in a state of dead men in an absolute indisposedness and incapacity either to the fulfilling of that which lies upon you as the law of your relation unto god or to the enjoyment of that which is the sweetness priviledg and comfort of your relation unto god
is she a wife think you or doth she not offer violence to the law of her relation that refuseth bed and board with her husband you should drink water out of your own cistern from your own head and spring who is that but your lord and head whom you have chosen god will not endure that you should wander he will hedg up your way as he speaks in hos
and those hedges will

teer you
he is pleased with you when you lean on him and take of his love and then his joy is fulfilled in you you do what he loves he takes contentment in it
other comforts are stoln sweet they may be in the taste but they will be bitterness in your bowels it must be so for when you live any where but in god you cross his great design which is to make himself your center wherein your souls should rest he hath appointed no place for thy soul to rest in but his own bosom you despise him when you suffer the joys of your souls to be clouded
if elkanah could say to his wife am not better to thee then ten sons surely god may say much more am not better to thee then ten such things as these that thou art troubled at so that if your hearts go out any other way it is against all reason
christ in john
made account that the soul hath enough that tastes of this for he saith he shall never thirst more
go no more then to the hedges and high ways thou that hast such a god and such a friend be quiet and rest in his love he rests in his love to you zech
and will not you rest in it and lie down in his arms and embracements and say it is sweet it is enough is not he always embracing you and cheering you and holding forth the brests of his consolation

to you wooing and winning you and using all means to fill your souls with himself and to make you blessed in the enjoyment of him if then you have any fear of his displeasure if you have any sweetness and comfort of the love of god if you have tasted and known how good the lord is then keep fast to him and maintain your souls in a constant living communion with him if you keep near him you shall find that there is life in him psal
they shall live that seek the lord

chap
xviii

heavenly life nearest at hand
christians are to live up to the height of it and to maintain it in every condition

a fourth argument is that this life we speak of is most present it is nearest at hand most attainable being wholly mental and spiritual and those works are quickest done
all other life comes in by parcels and pieces if a man would live in honor what a deal ado is there what a compass must he fetch to maintain good thoughts with this man and with that man and his honor riseth by degrees the like may be said

concerning pleasures and riches
nay naturally what a course doth the soul take to bring in that meat which supplies our life in eating concocting and digesting it and carrying it to every part the labour of nature is great
but this life is maintained by a sweet and silent working of spirit it is a life that is got kept and cherished by the sweetest actings of the soul
in psal
saith david shall be fill'd as with marrow and fatness when remember thee upon my bed
and in psal
you have this exprest by the like words some trust in charets and some in horses great preparations they make but what is his trust will remember the name of the lord our god
this is life to remember the name of the lord our god it is the best exercise of the most noble part of a man towards the most excellent object
and what should we love more to look upon and to remember then god do not you find how a few affectionate thoughts of him come down in showres of spiritual blessing and consolation both the goodness of god and the love of god makes this work sweet
he that seeks to live this way hath not only sweetness in his end but in the way to it
remember how successful you have found this course what unspeakable effusions of inward refreshing

have you found upon turning of your spirits unto god upon the very cast of your eye upon the father of mercies alas for those poor souls those wandering beggers even all men that do not come in and that have not god for their god in christ it is pity and grief to see what a poor life they live and they know it not how do they sweat and toyl for that which they never get they get but the image of what they aim at for what do they work for life they think but they work themselves out of life not into life they are knocking always at that door where nothing is where vanity and emptiness dwells they are digging pits that will hold no water they are seeking grapes on thorns and figs on thistles
but this way is sure and sweet you are sure to find and your sweetness is as well in seeking as in finding

let christians then endeavor to live this life how can we without shame complain that we are dead and broken in spirit that a weight lies upon our souls that we are empty when life is so near us when the well is not deep and we might take of the water of life and drink freely men will not improve the activity and nimbleness of their souls to enrich themselves
we oftentimes charge god with hiding his face from us

but wrongfully he turns not away his face from us we turn from him we go out of the into the cold shade and then we shake by reason of cold
but those looks of god which are easily had in jesus christ warm and chear the soul
have not such a thought in your hearts that holy consolations are hardly gotten you wrong the fountain of life if you think that you may draw and find nothing or that you may let down your bucket and bring it up empty these are blasphemies which our unbeleeving hearts form against god
certainly god is easie to be entreated and to be found of those that seek him
david in psal
had hard thoughts of him but when he once tryed him though he came in the blackness and dread of his soul covered over with shame and confusion yet he found god to be to him according to all his name and according to all his word his tears were wiped away and his broken bones were set again and he was satisfied

would yet a little more clearly express this thing and winde up the exhortation to its just height in two words


that we endevor to live this life in the highest degree that is to live very much in god not only to have a true life but a life proportionable to our relation unto him

princes should feed as princes and their life should be like their place so should christians have their life proportionable to what god is
what god is in himself he is to us if we have accepted salvation by jesus christ
meer peace is too low a temper for a christian he is never like himself except he live in joy his principles reach to all joy and for that the apostle paul pray'd col
saints might as well live like princes in faith and joy as with feeble hopes some weak consolations they might as well drink a full draught as taste of the goodness and kindness of god
who straitens you what is your life but a continual espousing of your selves unto god and should not there be much joy on the marriage day therefore the apostle prays in rom
the god of peace fill you with all peace and joy always all peace and always


a second word is that you maintain this life in every state
no variation of our outward estate in this life should be any diminution of the glory of this life
the rejoycing you have by faith and spiritual enjoyments should not be dampt by any thing
is our fellowship with the father and with his son jesus christ can we say so then what should all the turnings of this

world be to us how unsuitable to this communion is it to have our spirits turned and our joys changed with outward things suppose it be well with us in the world and we be pleased yet is it fit for the expectants of eternal life who have also a sense of the sweetness of enjoying god to be much taken with these things is there not a crown prepared for us is not god our god can we be content to be so taken with the dishes at a feast as to forget our friend at the table and that our best friend suppose it be ill with us as we commonly account ill though the truth is it is never ill with a good man it doth but appear ill it seems ill but it is all good and well for all is from goodness and love therefore though it be ill with us in this sence yet let us be in our own temper that is rejoyce in god though nothing be the same yet if god be the same let us be the same
meditate upon that famous place habak

although the shall not blossom neither shall fruit be in the vines the labour of the olive shall fail and the fields shall yield no meat the flock shall be cut off from the fold and there shall be no herd in the stalls yet will rejoyce in the lord will joy in the god of my salvation
this is that which god calls for that you live in him always
whatsoever fails say as

the psalmist psal
god is my portion for ever
have a father in heaven and so though find things bad enough here yet it is well it is well well above and well within

further considerations to promote the forementioned life of its incomparable worth
those that will not live the life of faith shall not
a firm belief of the gospel the foundation of this life

let us now take a few things more into consideration to promote our living in god for we have need of all cords to draw us and bind us to this life


the first is the unutterable difference that is between this life and any other attainable or imaginable
harken to all that can judg every thing speaks in the case especially take the testimony of god and of those whom he hath blessed with the best enjoyment of himself you know what god saith of himself and what glorious descriptions he hath made of that absoluteness and incomprehensible goodness which is in him you know what he hath said of all things

else that they are broken cisterns
ask the saints also and the spirits of just men made perfect take the angels too they live in god and are confined in that life they go no further yet their confinement is no imprisonment but it's a confinement of love and liberty it's from the satisfaction of their souls
you know that perfect rest is from a perfection of estate
this life and the wants of it always breed motion the spirit is still moving out of one condition unto something better
the constant rest of those glorified spirits in god is a plain demonstration that there is no life like that
they know the life that we live in this world they know what honours pleasures and such things are but they are so beneath them that they do no less overlook these then a prince doth overlook the poorest cottage or the vilest things of this world
nay the saints on earth too when they are themselves do not only prefer a life in god before all things but with contempt of all things paul puts a note of superexcellency upon the knowledg of christ and pronounceth all things else but dross and dung phil

in heb
they suffered the loss of all things for this life with joyfulness it did not grieve them to see their goods and estates taken from them because they saw

this loss make for the further enlargement of their life in god
and those in rev
loved not their lives to the death for christs sake
when solomon had traversed all these things and make no doubt but he had many that traversed them with him you know what he saith of them vanity of vanities all is vanity and vexation of spirit
but why should dwell upon outward testimonies make use of your own understands give them full scope to search and then think what proportion there is between that life that is upon things finite mixed mutable and of short continuance and that life that is in him that is infinite and all good always the same abiding for ever
descend lower then your understandings call in the sense and experience of those several states of life which you have passed through in the world as that of childhood of manhood of a single estate of a married estate of a meaner and of a fuller condition take the best of them what did you find in them in comparison of that life that you have in god remember all the sense you have had of the sweetness that is in the enjoyment of god and then upon the verdict of your sense and inward experience you will find that there is no comparison between the one and the other
how often have you said when you

have been hunting after and wearied your selves in the vanity of this world will return to my first husband for then it was better with me then now hos


what a deplorable loss to our spirits is it when we suffer a day to pass without living in god that day we dye when as we might have been as they in heaven
what shadows of death have covered your souls when you have been out of god what bondage and weight are cast upon mens spirits how are they as reeds of no strength shaken with every wind with the turnings of the things in this world if their hearts be out of god we are chargeable with many sorrows and and god might put them upon our account god may visit us for many of our tears and complaints
what will not the fountain give water will not the full brest give milk it is a wrong to say so of god we are the cause of our own harms and losses
the rest and chearful vigor of a mans soul is of more worth then a world and that we lose whilest our spirits roul up and down
who can utter what those joys are what that sweetness of the taste of the soul is which it hath in its sincere and secret addresses to the father of life in its secret conversings with him and enjoyment of

him what a holy forgetfulness of all things hath this wrought what a holy magnanimity what peace passing all understanding what joy unspeakable and glorious and shall we lose all this by not maintaining our life in god our experience and knowledg of these things should be as an attractive and the sadness of our souls under the heavy loss of this should be an enforcement upon us to keep near unto god
the apostle hebr
gives this as a reason why they were so weak you have forgotten saith he the exhortation or consolation that speaks to you as children


a third consideration is the sweet and powerful attractions and invitations of the spirit
how often may that be said to us which christ saith to them rev
behold stand at the door and knock if any man will open to me will come in and sup with him how often and how strongly hath wisdom cryed from heaven and uttered her voyce saying have built my house have prepared my feast come my friends all is prepared for you come and eat and rejoyce in the fulness of my love christ hath followed us as the waters followed them in the desart mercy and goodness hath followed us all our days
hath not god by his spirit

urged us from all things from all conditions and relations from every thing that strikes upon our senses or that comes within the compass of our knowledg as his design is by all things to work us to himself so hath he not by all things pleaded with us to come home and to stay at home that we might be blessed in the enjoyment of the sweetness of his presence he hath layd up something even in death it self to bring us to him
a crown was once found in a thorny bush
surely then if god be so ready to meet us and doth so seek us if he have so richly prepared for us and set things before us we should provoke our souls to feed on these precious things and to live that life of the enjoyment of god which only is life


if we will not live this life in god it may be we shall not
if nothing will prevail but we will live in the flesh and pour out our souls upon vanities and will be wandering in this world travelling in the desart and forsaking the fulness and sweetness that is in god surely it may be that shall be our portion all our days god may and he doth hide himself from the soul when the soul hides it self from him god calls and they will not hear he invites and they are careless well saith god seeing they will

not come they shall not come but shall live like servants and strangers and shall have no more of the childrens bread then will maintain them in a state of life but not maintain them in a state of peace
sorrows and troubles will seize upon men because they would not embrace sweet mercies
do you think we can violate all the mercies and goodness of god and be born with no no remember that example in sam

eli had many and great manifestations of gods love but his sin of fond love to his wicked children would not be done away with sacrifice or god said he would bring evil upon the house of eli and he did it

as a fundamental assistance to all this look to the setling of your souls in a firm belief of the gospel for so far only as we beleeve the words of eternal life they are of power to us
remember that in heb
the gospel came to the jews but it did not profit them because it was not mixed with faith
the weight of words lies in the truth of them and not only in the worth of them for if you speak of mountains of gold of heaps of pearls though these are rich words yet if there be not as much truth in them they are but an empty sound and take not the heart
converse much with all the

witnesses of the scriptures truth converse with and call to mind frequently that inward seal which is upon your own spirits that living and effectual force and vertue which the word of god hath had upon your hearts unto a thankful embracing of it to a holy subjection to it to a couragious and chearful dependance upon it to the melting of your hearts and the pouring out of your spirits unto god
remember these things for gods appearances in his word are as so many seals and witnesses from above rest not till you can say with that angel rev
these are the true sayings of god and with the apostle in joh
we know that his testimony is true for while this is not done our comforts and rejoycings in god cannot be high they cannot exceed our faith

then let no dark clouds remain upon your spirits so far as you can if you have received a little light make it to encrease more and more to the perfect day
observe the language of the people of god know that my redeemer lives know that thou art with me
how often have you these expressions in the first epistle of john
and
chapters we know that we are of god we know that god dwells in us we know that we have passed from death to life we know that

we are in the truth endeavor to come to this

again be frequent in drawing comfortable and reviving inferences from your interest in god
mark what inference the church makes will wait upon god my god will hear me
faith and a lively enjoyment of god is full of argumentation and that is the life of the soul it is not maintained by a speculation of god but by arguments reasonings and such conclusions as are meat and drink indeed to the soul

chap

our apostacy hath made us unapt for divine life and converse with god through a mediator and willing to conform to the lowest patterns

having said much to this point will shew now what great need there is that so much should have been said and much more also for the furtherance of this life in god take therefore into your hearts these few things

first we are naturally in greater affinity and capacity as to the things of the creature then to the things of god
it is was not so

from the beginning but our apostacy cast us into this unhappy state that whereas we were nearest unto god now all things are nearer unto us then god we are grown strangers to that life
as the child of a prince that goes away in his childhood and is trained up in a beggers house he contracts a beggers spirit and grows a stranger to a princes life so it hath been with us
as nebuchadnezzar lived like a beast and forgot the life of a prince yea of a man so we are strangers from the life of god
what god saith in hosea
is true of us all we account his things as strange things as things that we are not acquainted with we have neither a pleasing sight of them nor a pleasing taste of them but they are to us as meat that we cannot relish that suits not with us
nothing was more natural to man then to live in god as we came out of gods hand
it was not more natural for the fish to live in the water then for us to live in god and that was a blessed state
the brest is not more natural to the child then that life was to us that was our first life and it was sweet though it was short
it was a blessed life for god let out himself in so much fulness as took the heart up into intimate acquaintance
we were made upright that is such as god delighted in such

as we should be now we are altered our spirits are divided and scattered
in as much then as we have not altogether cast off our depraved natures we have need to be thus called upon we being more enclined to the creature then unto god

secondly naturally we have a greater propensity to observe the law then the gospel to do what we are bid then to take what is offered and given to us in the gospel for the law is natural to us it is written in our hearts the things that are revealed in the gospel are above nature
this disposition the apostle found in those ro
latter end israel which followed after the law of righteousness did not attain unto the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by the works of the law for they stumbled at that stumbling stone
it was a stumbling stone indeed to them they rather chose to make their way to life by the law then to accept of life according to the propositions of the gospel because the law was more near to them it was more natural to them but the gospel is supernatural
children are nearer to and more apt to receive those things which are by nature then those things which are by instruction and appointment
it is natural for a child to eat he need not be taught it

but for a child to learn that is hard he is at more distance from it so it is more easie for us to form our selves to the obedience of the law then to the gospel

thirdly we are naturally more apt to converse with god immediately then by a mediator because this is still according to the natural course and original appointment of god in the first creation of man
though then there was a very great disproportion an infinite disproportion between god and us yet because there was no conscience of guilt no matter of offence this poor creature though but dust and ashes could come to god and did converse with him immediately
but now since his going away from god god hath declared that man should come no more immediately to him but by the door which he hath appointed he hath made jesus christ that door and whosoever entereth by him hath life and none else
you may knock at the door of mercy and spend your days in tears and prayers but not be heard unless your way be through christ therefore pet

the apostle speaks thus through him we beleeve in god
and heb
he saves those that come unto god through him
we are very apt rather to come to god as he is the great god our creator then to come to

him through a mediator therefore since there is no other way of life but this we had need be taught it

fourthly we are apt to think it almost impossible to live such a life as this
oh how do we greaten the matter of our duty we make mountains of the fault is not in god but in us
certainly we might have more what saith the gospel doth it not call us to all joy all peace and to rejoyce always what's the meaning of this doth not god speak realities shall we rather have hard thoughts of god then of our selves no no it is because we will not we thirst not it is not because water is not to be had but because we will not take the pains to draw it we say the well is deep and the water will not come but he hath said he will meet those that rejoyce and work righteousness and that he will draw near to those that draw near to him and he will be as good as his word
certainly the fault lies either in our not seeking or not seeking as we should or in our not taking what is offered to us
do you not find that when you come to the door of grace it stands open and that god is ready to give the comfort and refreshings of a father when you come overwhelmed with sorrows is not he always the same will he hear one prayer and not

another if you did continue in prayer and seeking might you not have more it is very ill to fancy such impossibilities
why do you set bounds where god hath set none and make that so hard to get which god is so willing to give and so straiten your selves when you have license to ask

lastly we are apt to live much by patterns and examples
we see how christians live at the common rate it's neither night nor day with them they have a trembling hope a mingled joy a mourning life sometimes bright sometimes clouded and this sight doth form other christians to the same life and makes them say seeing others live so i'le live so too
examples are mighty
of what force was peter example of to the galatians in another case beggers form one anothers spirits to beggery and a poor kind of life
remember that counsel of the apostle in rom
be not conform'd unto this world
make no patterns to your selves further then they agree with the rule that you are to go by
how low did the jews bring themselves by the traditions of their fathers their fathers did so and so that's a poor beggerly life
shall say one thing more

we are subject to slothfulness it's strange that a christian should be slothful of all

men
should we not wonder if we saw a man slothful to gather up pearls and jewels of great worth was ever any man so slothful that he would not take the pains to eat his meat when he was hungry can a poor man be so slothful that he will not dig a myne of gold when he may have it what should make a christian slothful what is it the difficulty of this life certainly if we say so we speak evil of god and his goodness as those spies did of the good land
what is there difficulty in eating and drinking our way all along is pleasure even the pleasure of living in god and enjoying of him
or is the work unsuccessful dare you say you have let down your bucket and drew up nothing dare you say that you went sincerely to god and could not procure him to hear you no you cannot for when his servants have come to him in their worst conditions he hath received and embraced them
could a man come to god in a worse condition then david did psal
when he had run from god desperately and stayed out a great while you may well think how often he quenched the spirit in that time and contended with god and yet when he returned and came home god did not despise him god did not say to him away

wretch what hast thou to do to expect mercy but pardoned refreshed and cheered him and david tells it abroad for this saith he shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a time when thou mayst be found
say not then with thy self that thy coming shall be unsuccessful

to that which hath been said we may add these pertinent considerations

if we live in god and fetch all our peace strength and satisfaction from him we shall have the best enjoyment of all things else the taste of gods love sweetens all enjoyments

this puts the soul into a secure state against all dangers it cannot be ill with him that enjoys god it puts a man into a state of conquest and victory over all things when a man enjoys god and lies upon his love he is above all things

this fulfils the end of our creation for this was gods appointment that we might be for the demonstration of his infinite excellency and to the enhappying of our selves in the enjoyment of him

this keeps the soul in a preparedness to all holy walkings and obedience
when a man lives in god his heart is tuned to all duties

chap
xxi

several questions concerning the forementioned doctrine answered
saints not always equally strong
some afflictions sweetened more then others
sometimes god will have his rod smart

proceed now to answer two or three questions which concern this doctrine and truth
quest
seeing the saints have this way for life and that their interest in god doth so ballance their souls whence is it that they are so frequently dejected so under hatches quest
if interest in god be so effectual to lift up christians spirits whence is it that there are so many weaknesses deformities and contrarieties to god in their spirits quest
whence is it that they who have no interest in god oftentimes seem to go through very great troubles with much strength

quest
if the saints life springs from their interest in god how is it then that they are so often broken in spirit that there dwells with them heaviness confusion and

distraction oftentimes as with others

answer
in the first place let us know that the saints do not all live this life equally they have not all received such measures of grace that they can with equal magnanimity pass through their troubles in this world
some pass through trouble with a spirit of glory being highly lifted up above their sufferings so paul in rom
we glory in tribulation
in heb
they joyfully the spoiling of their goods
and acts
when the apostles were scourged they went away rejoycing that they were accounted worthy to suffer for the name of jesus
others go not on triumphantly but stedfastly though their afflictions be not so much under them yet they are above their afflictions though they cannot go on their way with so much gallantry as others yet they are not turned out of their way
so job that pattern of patience was sometimes up and sometimes down but he had the conquest
it is with christians as it is with the ayr which is sometimes bright and sometimes cloudy sometimes stormy and sometimes calm
a ship at anchor rouls in the sea but is safe so christians have many tosses in this world but are secure
peter is an instance of this truth
and some of our own martyrs and others might be produced who have shewed

a very trembling spirit a misgiving heart in the time of their tryals
some have begun to fret at their condition as that good man asaph did in psal
because he saw god did not do for him as for others was angry and disputed the matter
jeremiah did so in the chapter of his book jonah did so with a witness david sometimes why hast thou forgotten me saith he
sometimes they are brought to use ill means to help themselves asa did so in chron

because god did not help him he would see if he could help himself he struck a league with the king of assyria and thereby provoked god

the reason of this inequality that is between christians compared one with another or that is to be found in themselves at one time compared with themselves at another time lies in such things as these


some sufferings are more sweetened with the divine presence then others god attends some afflictions with more inward consolations and manifestations of his love then others
those sufferings that are for his names sake are usually thus sweetened
the apostle peter pet

saith if you be reproached for the name of christ happy are ye what follows for the spirit of glory and of god rests upon you
these two

sufferings and rejoycings are mixed and put together in thes
you have received the gospel in much affliction and joy of the holy ghost much affliction much persecution and therefore joy in the holy ghost
sufferings for god and christ are no bars to the sweetest serenity and most perfect calm of the soul notwithstanding these joy oft rises to the highest even unto extasie as some have found god usually pours out himself very fully at such times
light though but a spark will appear against all the darkness of a whole spacious room the little light of a twinkling star prevails against the darkness of the night how much more will the light of gods face when that shines upon the soul prevail against all the darkness of sufferings that are upon a man when peter and daniel were in great afflictions god sent his angel to comfort them
we have examples in our own stories that do sufficiently witness what the sight and taste of divine love will do in sufferings have not some called the flames beds of roses not only things without pain but of pleasure eusebius tells of one that writ to his friend from a stinking dungeon and dated his letter from my delicate orchard
god so sweetens every condition even the worst that they undergo for his sake

that they have more contentment and satisfaction of soul then a prince on his throne
therefore the apostle cor
hath these expressions great is my boldness of speech toward you great is my glorying of you am fill'd with comfort am exceeding joyful in all our tribulations
strange matter of joy he was very glad to hear that they were hunted and persecuted of this world for the name of christ as himself was because now he knew they should enjoy more of god and of that which the world knew not
therefore the apostle james saith account it all joy when you fall into such temptations when you suffer thus
other afflictions and tryals usually have less of sweetness in them

secondly true interest in god is not always of equal strength and power with christians
let a man be supposed to be of a vast estate such things have been found if he doth not keep an exact account of what he hath he may think himself worse then nothing and then will be as a begger though he be rich so a christian not keeping the account of his interest clear may suffer in his spirit as one that is without god when indeed he is in the bosom of god
oh how is our unhappy spirit subject to excursions and wanderings from god and these are the destruction of our peace and bring our

souls into a night of sorrow
asah of whom spake before was out upon this account because he had lost the sweetness of the enjoyment of god

thirdly god sometimes leaves his people not only to their sufferings but to grief yea and to faintings under their burdens
when god comes in way of correction he will have his rod known to be a rod it shall smart
it is true the ultimate end of it is to make us more partakers of his holiness his end is cure but the way is by grief and we shall know the weight of his hand when he comes thus when god comes to visit us it will be a sharp season
he will not always deny us some comfort from the manifestation of himself to us but he will so manage the matter that we shall know he is not pleased with us
but however there is a vast difference between the people of god and others between their impatience under their burdens and that of the world for god doth maintain his presence in his people and they find it it's attended with such a spirit as this usually in the worst times they can still plead with god
you have an example in psal
all this is come upon us yet we have not forgot thee nor dealt falsly in thy covenant our hearts have not turned back neither have our steps declined from thy way

and yet they had complained very much in the words before and shewed a deep sense of the burdens and troubles that lay upon their spirits yet for all this god was their god and they had not departed from him
so in isai
in the way of thy judgments lord we have waited for thee the desire of our soul is to thy name and to the remembrance of it
this is the frame of the spirit of gods people that although they complain and be full of sorrows yet still their affections are towards god they are unmoveable and unchangeable our desires are still towards thee
you know that famous speech of job in chap
though he kill me yet will trust in him and yet job spoke many hard things and was full of bitterness
and the church here in this micah
saith she will wait and bear the indignation of the lord which was heavy upon her till god came and shewed mercy to her

again though they are born down they rise again all the hurt of their spirits ends in a sweet recovery
in jer
it is said concerning ephraim thou hast chastised me and was chastised was as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke see what a carriage here was he was smitten and smitten but still stout and unquiet restless and kicking against the rod but afterward he saith

turn thou me and shall be turned though there was before a froward spirit there is now a praying spirit that he might be brought unto himself was ashamed saith he and confounded because did bear the reproach of my youth
the return of saints is with this double excellency


with a deep when they find they have fainted in the day of their tryal when they reflect upon the ill carriage of their spirits toward god there is a deep shame falls upon them
job is an instance in chap
when he saw god and remembered his own carriage he saith abhor my self in dust and ashes in dust and ashes that is he was very much afflicted for that was the manner of the afflicted as you may read in jer
oh daughter of my people gird thee with sackcloth and wallow in ashes so in isai
will give them beauty for ashes that is in stead of a mourning condition will put them into a joyful
so in psal
that good man confesseth concerning himself was foolish and ignorant even as a beast before thee my carriage was brutish and absurd


they attain also more subjection unto god then before they have their hearts more bowed to him then before discoveries of sin and restored mercies do mightily work

upon their spirits
in psal
david after his yielded to god and came to more calmness of spirit held my peace because it was thy doing
the lord will not lose his people his end when he comes to smite them is not to drive them from him they can say to god as he said to his master when he was driving him from school with a staff it's not thy staff can drive me from thee
what father ever used the rod upon his child that he might alienate the heart of his child from him nay if a father had power to bring the spirit of his child to his own heart he would do it god can and therefore he will
it cannot stand with that infinite goodness which is in god by afflictions or any thing else to separate his people from himself he having set his own image upon them what would he give the blood of his own son for them and suffer them to be thrown away no neither will he suffer them to throw themselves away

chap
xxii

how it comes to pass that deformities creep into the conversation of christians since they have so high a principle of life
whence it is that those which enjoy not god seem to go through afflictions with strength

a second question is que&st if interest in god be so effectual to lift up christians spirits whence is it that there is such a poor ragged spirit appearing in some christians and that so many weaknesses and frailties are upon them that so much of contrariety to god and deformity is sometimes in their carriage

answer
it is a most deplorable truth and to be lamented of all the generation of the righteous that very few of those that beleeve do enjoy a clear and constant sight of their interest in god
many do oftentimes bring a damp upon it by their going out from him they dwell not in him and the hope of glory for the nature of that is to sanctifie and bring us into a conformity to god
joh
he that hath this hope in him purifieth himself as he is pure and whosoever abideth in him sinneth not so far as a mans abiding is in god so far he is at

a greater distance from sin


there is something in the natural temper may call it rather unnatural that very much clouds the beauty of a christians conversation
some things will be in christians according to that state of the body which they have here let a man be strongly disposed to anger fear grief or sorrow these passions will oftentimes appear because they are in the constitution of the body and grace is not so perfect a physician as to alter the state of it the end of grace is to bring the worser part into conformity and obedience and it will do it at last and in the mean time where it cannot govern it will cry out and complain as the apostle in rom
wretched man that am


in great tryals the spirits of men are apt to be more serious solid and contracted then in smaller matters
a soldier gathers up his courage puts on his armor and will stand to it when he is assaulted for his life whereas he minds not the little dog that bites him by the heels
great spirits oftentimes are mov'd at small things that are not mov'd at all at greater things
aaron was sometime stir'd at a less occasion yet when that sore tryal was upon him mentioned in levit

aaron held his peace he had a plain signification of the mind and will of god

in the thing and he was quiet


assaults upon our outward man are more visible then corruptions that dwell in us sin comes oftentimes stealing and creeping by degrees so it did upon solomon though he was a wise man yet he was not aware whether he was going

afflictions and sufferings being things without us corruptions and sins within us it's easier for us to bear one then the other
a giant can bear a burden upon his shoulders but is not able to bear a little stone in his bladder
the earth that is not moved by all the storms without is shaken with a little wind in the body of it

outward sufferings and tryals usually are more consistent and abiding but miscarriages obliquities and deformities are transient things more sudden and so surprize us

the third question is que&st how men that have not god for their god nor ever tasted the sweetness of his love do go through very great tryals and sore afflictions with much strength

it is to be granted that they do so many times but never as the saints do
an&sw look upon saul and david and see the disproportion of their spirits in their tryals
in saul evil wrought like it self the natural product of affliction is depravation
affliction

stirs up and puts life and activity into sin as when you beat a wolf you make him more a wolf then he was before
in chro
it's said of ahaz that in the time of his affliction he did add to sin against god he sin'd more and more this is that ahaz or as some read this is ahaz the king the same
a like phrase you have in psal
thou art the same
saul fretted and was angry his soul was at and in a rage within him because he was cross'd and suffered a frustration of his hopes and designs
this is the natural operation of evil upon such spirits as the hath it in prov
the foolishness of man perverteth his way and his heart fretteth against the lord he is angry with his condition and in that with god
but see davids carriage in psal
layd mine hand upon my mouth held my peace because it was thou lord that didst it
it was a patience not constrained but from satisfaction of spirit he saw love in his affliction and that sweetened his soul
know saith he that in very faithfulness thou hast afflicted me psal
faithfulness is a reach beyond justice there is something more of sweetness in it and that david saw
saul went out and did not keep his way but david made streight steps unto his feet
in psal
he gives an account of himself

have kept the ways of the lord and have not wickedly departed from my god or have not done wickedly from god or as the chaldee have not walked in my wickedness from god for all his judgments were before me and did not put away his statutes from me they were before me in mine eye for observation before me in mine heart for delight and contentment and did not turn my back upon them or as it is in sam

turned not away from them so is the expression there was also upright before him or with him or was perfect to him was upright to him all the while was under my sufferings my wishes mine affections my intentions were unmoveable they were still toward god did not change in my spirit toward god though he made me to know many changes in my condition was tempted to impatience and revenge but kept my self from mine evil dispositions and workings bridled my spirit and so preserved my self in his ways

to be short take the most noble and generous spirit in the world that hath not attained to an enjoyment of god and you shall find that it is far beneath that spirit which a sight of interest in god works in his people
look upon the strength that such a man may possibly have it is either

from meer reason whereby he may perswade himself to patience by the necessity and mutability of things but this can never lead him into those depths whereby he shall be filled with those joys and comforts which the sight of interest in god fills the soul withall or it may be from natural courage and every man hath something of this and many beasts have more then men job hath told us of the courage of the horse in job
canst thou make him afraid as the grashopper and in chap
concerning the leviathan he saith that upon the earth there is not his like which is made without fear he beholdeth all high is a king over all the children of pride
but there is often an addition to this natural courage in men from pride both against god and men and by an influence from this world that strengthens them in their sufferings and hardships
but see a little further the reason why many times those men carry it out so stoutly they do not understand the significancy and import of their sufferings as the people of god do it is true god intends more evil unspeakably in the sufferings of the one then of the other but one hath a hint of it more then the other the unbeleever understands it not receives not the message into his judgment he conceives not

that these are tokens of the displeasure and anger of god against him but the sight of the displeasure of god to a good man is more then any rod

once more no wonder that they bear so strongly for it is their judgment god pours out a spirit of stupidity and senslessness a spirit of hardness upon them as you have it in rom
he pours on them the spirit of slumber the word properly signifies compunction or remorse but so it reaches not to the hebrew text for the words in the hebrew are in isai
he poured on them the spirit of deep sleep
some therefore because they see the hebrew doth speak this have made the greek word to speak in another sence then it is translated they read it the night and so make this spirit of to be the spirit of the night however that may be something strained yet certainly the word must answer to the hebrew and that is a spirit of deep sleep
now as a man that is asleep hath not a sense of things so it is with these men
the apostle useth another expression in the words before in vers
of rom
the rest were hardened
it was with them as it is with a man that hath a thick skin drawn over him that hath a part of his flesh become brawny he cannot receive the sense of things no more can these

therefore it is no wonder they bear their sufferings so stoutly as they do it is their judgment

a comparison of interest and enjoyment and the excellency of enjoyment evinced from interest
what is requisite to make full enjoyment
an affectionate close to all the foregoing discourses

will shut up this discourse by drawing one inference from what hath been premised
the inference is this if interest in god be so sweet so powerful and mighty how precious and excellent is the enjoyment for that take these few considerations

first to have an interest in god is much less then to enjoy god
a great difference there is between the meanest saint and a glorified spirit and yet the meanest saint hath as well an interest in god as the highest creature in glory
interest in all things is less then possession
an heir hath not so much sweetness and content in his right and title as when he comes to have actual possession of that he looks for
a state of meer interest

is a state of expectation and where there is hope there is always grief it's a state of desire and that imports want for when there is fulness desire ceaseth
therefore you find this to be the temper of the people of god that having seen their interest they long after enjoyment
in cor
we sigh and groan saith the apostle and he heaps one word upon another till we come to the fulness of that which we have interest in

secondly consider this that though interest here be not without some enjoyment of god yet that enjoyment is far less then it will be
there be four things that make up enjoyment of god


a gracious presence a sweet effusion or communication of himself to the soul
it must not be a bare presence but an active presence god pouring forth himself
a child that hath the brest doth not enjoy it when he cannot draw the milk
a garden is not enjoyed by him whose it is that hath neither flowers nor fruits from it
that which we have of god here though it be more then we had reason to look for and is that which the angels wonder at yet it is very little to that which we look for in heaven it's called the first fruits it is but the infancy of that blessed state whereto we are adopted
all the enjoyment we have of god in

this world is not effectual to the removing of its contrary that is to cast out all fear and heaviness all sorrow and dejection out of the mind
that enjoyment of god which christ himself had here on earth did not keep out all fear and sorrow
fulness is reserved for heaven


a second thing is a mind enlightened and enabled to a just comprehension of the excellency of god and of the sweetness of the presence and love of god
by comprehensive mean as much as the faculty can reach and extend unto
but now the mind cannot have an observation of all the emanations of divine love more then a child can count the drops of milk which it sucks we may as well tell the drops of rain in a showre as tell the particulars of the love of god poured forth upon us our minds cannot extend to a just comprehension of that sweetness and love that is in god
it is with us as tis with a child that hath a jewel put into his hand of exceeding great value for the matter of it and of greater worth for the signification being the seal of a crown to him but the child knows it not so the mercies of god are more in their nature and in their end then we can comprehend they are far above our reach
our minds are so straitened that we cannot have a full enjoyment of

god here but if in this life we find so much sweetness in what we do enjoy what will it be when our light shall be like the sun at


there is requisite a lively sense of the presence of god
the soul hath its sense as well as the body nay more for it's the fountain of sense to the body
in phil

the apostle prays that they may abound in all knowledg and sense of the things of god
as the body receives its life from things by the senses so doth the soul also receive its life in the sweetness and comfort of the presence of god by its spiritual sense
take away sense and a man is as a dead thing and all things are dead to him and the presence of god would be a dead thing to the soul if it were not for the souls sense of it mean the spiritual sense which the church speaks of cant
sat under his shadow and his fruit was pleasant to my taste
but now the sense of the soul hath here a dulness upon it it's short of that quickness to which it was appointed therefore we cannot have that full enjoyment of god here as hereafter
but if what we do enjoy now be so sweet what will the enjoyment be when the soul shall be so full of sense


a perfect love of god is required to a full enjoyment of god
love must be in its utmost

height and heat if the soul have a compleat and full enjoyment of god
take two persons never so qualified and furnished to make the life of both comfortable if there be not love there cannot be a happy enjoyment of these two
as a man loves a thing so he enjoys it when he hath it so as a man loves god so he will cleave to him and pour out himself in a blessed fruition of him as our love is so is our life and enjoyment
though our enjoyment of god here be imperfect and weak yet it's of that strength that it conquers and bears up the heart against all afflictions whatsoever therefore there must needs be a far greater sweetness in the fulness of this enjoyment

thirdly a third consideration is this let our enjoyment here be what it will it is mixt with many sorrows many wants many straits both within and without our life is such here that our afflictions many times seem to our enjoyments they strike quick upon the sense and come too near the spirit hence it is that you sometimes find good men complain more of one affliction then they mention a thousand mercies
our life here is mix'd thes
you have received the word with much affliction and with joy they are mingled
now

say if the consolations of god from that little enjoyment of him here in the midst of many sufferings be so sweet and precious that it bears the soul up above all what then will the full enjoyment of god be in that land of rest where is light and no darkness life and no death all good and no evil

fourthly the enjoyment of god here is subject to many interruptions
sometimes by our sinful diversions from god the soul goes out from the bosom of the father minding other things and so our hearts are taken and brought into an estrangedness from god to a poor kind of delight in other things
as a bird that wanders from her nest so is a man that is out of his place prov
surely a man is never more out of his place then when he goes out from god and then he is like a bird that is gone from her nest she knows not where to rest but is troubled to find the way home again and to recover the loss that she hath brought upon her self by her foolish wandering

sometimes there is an interruption by the appointment of god
god will not always have you lie at the brests of consolation nay saith god when his people are sitting by the well of the water of life this must not be all your work i'le have you

about this business and that employment now these interruptions do lessen our life and our happiness but the time will come when we shall always live in the presence of our father and our minds shall be encumbred with nothing else but we shall be filled and blessed with the vision of god

sometimes this interruption is caused by gods going out from us there be recesses and retreats of god he sometimes out of his wisdom shadows his love and favour but in heaven there will be always a full visible and clear presence
fifthly the enjoyment of god must needs be sweet because it is such as fills the whole capacity of the soul and when there is fulness there is rest
when a man hath what he can wish he can go no further
at thy right hand are rivers of pleasure and in thy presence is fulness of joy for evermore psal
ult
the apostle in acts
something alters the expression that is used in the psalms thou hast made me glad with thy countenance
the sense of the good presence and favour and love of god doth fill the soul with pleasure and when it can hold no more it hath enough

let the issue of all this discourse be to set our hearts a longing and wishing that were blessed with a full enjoyment of god

that had as much of him as ever shall or can have the soul that is thus in travel travels without pain
the mind reaching after other things oftentimes outstretcheth it self there are usually if not always pains with desires especially in desires after the creature because that oftentimes there is a frustration of our desires or an elongation of the things the things are far off hard to come by our desires oftentimes are mute they speak not or the things that we desire know not our minds but our desires after god always speak they are open unto god he heareth their voyce
all my desires are before thee saith david psal
and my groanings are not hid from thee
therfore it must needs be sweet when the soul lies thus open unto god
other desires do not assure and secure a man in the things he desires a man may wish this and wish that and go without both but the soul that thus longs after god is instated in his wish hath a present enjoyment and certainly shall have a full enjoyment of him
he will fulfil the desire of them that fear him god will hear them psal
they that long most receive most it's the hungry spirit that feeds best and fares best
when the church was sick of love being very much taken with what she had and much

longing after what she wanted then she could say am my beloveds and my beloved is mine his desire is towards me in cant
that refreshed her the greek reads it his conversion is towards me indeed god will turn to those that go out toward him in isai
he meets those that work righteousness and seek him in his ways

again consider this that longing after a full enjoyment is the natural effect of a known interest in god
look through all the orders of the creation and you shall find that every thing seeks the enjoyment of its interest angels do men do beasts do they seek their own their own pastures their own young their own mates
can you imagine that we should be the children of god and account him our father and not long to enjoy him a child hears from his father and receives tokens from his father but he is not contented he would be with his father so it is truly with a child of god so far as he hath received of that spirit he longs to enjoy god
interest in god works by a power of its own and god works in it too god pursues his interest in us to the utmost therefore he is working us to himself by all means all ways by good and evil by life by mortality and death by the senses by ordinances by his spirit he is always at

work to bring us home that we may be in his possession and enjoy him
and to make it the more full he hath appointed the breaking of these bodies that our spirits may come more full to him nay and he hath appointed a day of resurrection that our bodies may come full to him and this is one great end of christs coming again in joh
that we may be with him in his fathers house
if god so drives on his interest to make us perfect with him let us drive on our interest to make god fully ours in the enjoyment of him

lastly there is nothing to hinder in this case that you should not drive on to a full and perfect enjoyment of him
are you full in this world should your full enjoyments of the world hinder your full enjoyments of god is not god better then these things are you scanted in this world the more need you have then of the fullest enjoyments of god
have you much of god you know the more what god is and can you chuse but desire him have you little of god then you need more and should drive on to get more
are you sure of your interest where interest is most sure there is most love and where the soul loves most thither it drives most
do you fear your interest you have so much the more

reason to seek after a full enjoyment of god to the satisfaction of your souls
what do you think should stand in the way you must part with the world what is this world to your fathers house and to god himself you must dye what is death cannot that everlasting life recompence you infinitely therefore there is nothing to hinder you
then seeing god invites you and provokes you to seek more of him in this world though you cannot have all conjure you by all the sweetness that is in god and that you have found in god that you obey his word herein and drive on more diligently and strongly to a more full enjoyment of god

gods interest in man natural and acquired this latter twofold
of holy resignation
of true and false mourning

have chosen this excellent pattern to propose to you and to my self of an ingenuous spirit
david a man after gods own heart would be saved but not after the manner of the men of this world that would be saved to be their own and to enjoy themselves at their own wills but he in being saved would be gods and at his disposing am thine save me
there are three things here that would be thought on


what david means when he saith am thine


what the reason should be that we should use such an acknowledgment of our selves to be gods when we pray to him

what force there is in this argument to be pleaded with god am thine save me
thine we are said to be gods either by way of affection as the church cant
am my and my is mine or in respect of that interest that god hath in us
the interest of god in man is upon a twofold foundation and account


upon account of the law of nature the natural law which doth set god as lord over all and acknowledg him supreme commander of every thing because he is the original and glorious fountain of all being
upon that account it is that in psal
it is said the heavens are thine and the earth also is thine as for the world and the fulness thereof thou hast founded them
there is the ground of that dominion which god hath over all things they are his offspring things that himself hath made
and in psal
god owns himself in this soveraignty the heavens are mine and the earth is mine and all that in them is
to be

able no otherwise to say am thine is but sad
in a family the meanest things that are scarce fit to be retained in the house are his to whom the house belongs all things are gods even the meanest creatures and to have no other relation to god then this is but to be in the condition of things most contemptible
in deut
god speaks of a better relation to his people behold the heavens and the heaven of heavens is the lord thy gods the earth also with all that therein is now the lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them and chose his seed after them even you above all people as appeareth this day
we must be his upon a better account then that of creation

there is a second interest that god hath in man and that is acquired and that partly by redemption god having redeemed both by price and power a certain number to himself out of the lump of mankind these in an especial manner are his
so isai
thus saith the lord that created thee jacob and formed thee israel fear not have redeemed thee have called thee by name thou art mine
have redeemed thee that is have delivered thee from the great power of the mighty ones that bare rule over thee and under whom thou sufferedst hard things therefore thou art mine
this

we know is a law that is amongst men that those that are conquered and saved from the sword become his by whom they are so subdued

there is a second acquired interest that god hath in man and that is by contract wherein man engageth himself to a resignation of himself to god in which sence david spake also when he said am thine
the contract between god and man which is the foundation of this interest is a mutual engaging to be each others according to their capacities
i'le not insist upon opening this description but will a little hint at some of those strange things that are in this contract between god and man and first a word as to gods part
it's a contract where there is the greatest disparity that is imaginable between the two parties for here is he that is the highest and the other party that is lower then the lowest and meanest creature more contemptible then the worm
princes do not make contracts with beggers and yet they may have need of such though not for their assistance yet as theaters to display their bounty and goodness on
god needs not the whole creation to set forth his glory who is absolute in himself god al sufficient

to this add that disparity that is between

the things which god requires of man and the things which god engageth himself to do for man
was there ever such a contract made saith god do you but your part which is not a thousand part of what is due and i'le do my part what is that more then he did at first indent for i'le give you an eternal immutable life and that in my own presence and kingdom

you may cast your eyes from that again and wonder more at the mediator by whom and through whom this covenant this contract was made god sends his own son into the world both to bespeak man to be willing to enter into this contract and to seal up the contract with his own blood
that part which concerns man his resigning of himself unto god which is an absolute parting with himself and putting himself everlastingly under the power wisdom and soveraignty of god to be commanded ordered and disposed in all things by him according to his will
shall now set before you certain peculiar things that are proper to this engagement of man and resignation of himself unto god


in resigning of our selves to god there is an act springing from the greatest necessity and wherein there is the greatest liberty

and freedom of spirit
it was ill done to put these two into a contrariety and opposition necessity and freedom which do most perfectly agree by how much the more any creature is excellent by so much the more he is necessarily what he is and yet most freely such
the angels love god necessarily and yet most freely nay god himself is good most necessarily and yet is so and doth good most freely

this might be manifested in sundry instances where there is some degree of necessity and also a very excellent freedom and willingness
as for example take two friends fully suited to each other their hearts are necessarily carried to mutual embraces and yet most freely
it is in this case as in flying from evil a man flies from evil by a kind of enforcement and yet freely especially from some great evil when he sees there is a necessity to fly he cannot but fly and yet doth it freely

in resigning of our selves to god that which is the fundamental reason of it lays upon the spirit of a man a strong necessity and yet leaves that spirit in a very sweet and excellent freedome psal
you have both these exprest thy people shal be willing in the day of thy power in the day when thou putest forth thy power who wilt

rule in the midst of thine enemies and raise up to thy self a kingdome not onely among strangers but rebels in this day of thy power thy people shal be willing yea willingnesses very willing they shall come to thee with all earnestness
the will of a man may truly and in good fence be subject to compulsion and yet not limited in its freedom it may be compel'd how not by meer physicall power acting upon the spirit of a man but by a moral power by force of arguments and reasons proposed and set on the soul so sauls servants compel'd him to eat bread sam

and they were sent to command and to compell them to come to the feast
indeed this inforcing and commanding reason is the great instrument of the power of god whereby he commands the spirits of those whom he loves into obedience to himself
this is the key that opens the heart as it is said acts
god opened the heart of lydia
resignation of a mans self to god is from the efficacie of gods mighty appearance and manifestation of himself to the soul of a man by which he is over powr'd and cannot deny god but notwithstanding this necessity he doth most freely fall under the power that acts upon him


a second thing concerning resignation

is that self is saved by being destroyed it lives death a man finds himself by losing himself and doth best enjoy himself by parting with himself
there is a great mistake and it is the fascination and witchery of the powers of darkness upon the spirits of men that by nature corrupt nature we are apt to think that the giving of our selves to god is the giving of our selves away to our loss whereas it is our making it's not the straitning but the perfecting of our freedomÂ· take it in this similitude
a poor woman that lives in rags hath the honor and happiness of being wife to a great prince offered her for her now to give up her self is no way to straiten her freedom or diminish her happiness for she will enjoy her self better as a queen then as a begger
so by resigning our selves unto god we lose no liberty nor any thing that is good but enjoy our selves in greater amplitude and fulness of all happiness
so that for a man to give himself to god is in the height of it and there is no true but this for a man to think to love himself in ways of separation from god or in opposition to god is to hate himself in the appearance of love but this is true that makes me give my self to god and be subject to him


resigning of our selves to god is an act of the greatest joy and the greatest grief
of the greatest joy and contentment for when once the soul is blest with such a life from above as a man and makes him surrender himself to god now he is in his first and proper center
the whole state of men out of god is nothing but a constant course of confusion and restless motion who by reason of darkness and want of judgment by reason of hardness and want of sense may think they are well may think they are at home when they are not but are like men fallen asleep in a strange place so is every man that is out of god
but when the heart is brought home to god it is in its place
do you think the prodigal had not more rest in his fathers house then among the swine now a man sees what a blessed change is wrought in his condition that he is come now into a state of reconciliation with god and of unspeakable advancement of his nature that he is advanced to the greatest freedom to the greatest honor and riches to the best life every way and so this resignation is an act of the greatest joy

it's likewise such a work as is with the greatest grief
these two will stand together

neither can they be parted every mans grief is as his joy is
consider these two things


that when a man is brought to god he is put into a state of judgment and ingenuity so that now he sees things as they are and looks upon the wrongs he hath done against god with another eye an ingenuous spirit can no more forbear mourning then a stone can forbear falling to the center

think on this also that gods end in bringing back the creature is such as cannot be accomplished without this mourning
for his end is the exaltation of his grace grace is no grace to an unbroken spirit sermons of mercy are but empty sounds to a man that knows not what sorrow is
god intends to make christ precious but what is a salve a plaister though the best in the world to a man that is whole christ came indeed to save the miserable but that man that is not brought to see his misery and mourn over it cares not for christ

gods end is the engaging of the creature to himself but that man will never think himself beholding to god that knows not what he hath done against god
but when he sees what a wretch he hath been and his heart is stricken within him and he lies

melting in sorrow and clothed with shame before god now he thinks body and soul too little for god now if he had a thousand lives they should all go for god now he saith what can render to the lord

gods end is to bring his people in so that they may be fast when they are in that they may not go forth again
but he that thinks himself off from sins that he never mourn'd for and thinks he hath escaped evil courses that he hath not been broken for will return again
a mourning spirit makes a christian stedfast in his course and this will be a bar between him and his lust he that knows not to mourn knows nor to stand fast certainly where there is not a spirit of mourning that man hath not resign'd himself to god to this day for that which is the principle of such doth by its vertue also work mourning abasement and brokenness of heart
if the sight of god in all his goodness be that which moves and draws the soul as with a cord unto god that very goodness of god which is so apprehended will also break and melt the soul
in jer
saith god harkened and heard but they spake not aright no man repented of his wickedness saying what have done every one turned to his course as the horse rusheth into the battel
this people

made many promises that they would walk better with god but being not touch'd with an effectual sense of their injurious dealings with god they repented not therefore they returned every man to his own ways

if any one now should say have little of this sorrow and therefore do suspect my self answer
there is a passionate mourning which lies in weeping crying and howling and this every one hath not

there is a mental mourning where a man sees the things to be mourned for and where he hath such a spirit that carries him against his way and against himself and is full of wishes that had never been so against god and that might never do so again and makes the soul walk humbly it cannot be proud now nor lift up it self because it remembers what it hath been and done against god
canst thou find these things in thy self


again there is a mourning of pure necessity not willingly and contentfully but so as a man cannot avoyd it god presents himself angry and shews sin in its colour and then not an ahab nor a judas can forbear mourning but this mourning is bitterness but true mourning is sweet sweeter

then all the comforts in the world a right spirit puts the sweetness of heaven in mourning god cannot please him better with any thing then by touching his spirit and laying it low before him
if then thine heart be touched of god and thou love him and feel some meltings thou rejoycest and purst not off this sorrow but bids it welcome and when god as a father rebukes thee thou blessest him and lovest him


there is a mourning that is by fits not habitual
the veriest hypocrite in the world you may find sometimes in his closet before god and he will be weeping and mourning and taking on heavily by fits but take him a while after and he is like the dry ground after a land flood hard as a stone
true mourning is another frame of spirit wherein the spirit in an usual course is carried with abasement and a secret lamenting within wretch that am how have lived thus and thus have done he mingles the comforts of this world with these sorrows and will have place for this mourning in the midst of all things and cannot but oftentimes have his eye upon himself like paul was a persecuter and a blasphemer


again there is a mourning that is

afflicting but not changing
many trouble and vex themselves upon the remembrance of their ways a fire burns in their bowels that they cannot extinguish but it doth not purge them from their dross their tears be salt and brinish but not healing they hang down their heads and walk sadly but carry the same spirit still against god so ahab so they in sam

upon samuels counsel to them they gathered together at mizpeh and drew water and poured out before the lord and fasted and said we have sinned against the lord
they drew water it's conceived that this drawing of water is an expression of their mourning and their exceeding mourning and they fasted which is an addition and confessed saying we have sinned against the lord but it came to little as you may see in the eighth chapter
thou mournest aright when thine heart is changed and when thy mourning tends to the killing of thy sin

a fourth thing concerning this resignation is that it is but in part and yet is certainly in the whole
it is in part for no man hath actually perfectly given himself to god in this very gift and holy act of resignation there is imperfection and something wanting and much more in the execution of this engagement all along yet notwithstanding

this resignation is whole and entire partly in gods acceptance god is pleased to take it so to take a part for the whole as much as man can do as if all were done
and it is whole and entire in mans intention and desire though the desire be not perfect and the intent not perfect as to the degree yet both reach to the extent of of that which god calls for less then this cannot be in a good man and a man beloved of god a man cannot say am thine if he come not to this
for consider god treating with man about this work when he comes to plead for a resignation he treats not for part but for all
besides when man comes to plead with god he pleads not for part but for all he would be saved not in body alone but in soul too he would be perfectly saved
and take this also that god gives himself wholly unto man if he did not give him his wisdom and power and love man could not love him for how could we love him if his wisdom power or any of his glorious attributes were against us god gives himself to man wholly

again god cannot take less then all for to accept of a partial resignment and to indulge a man a right and power over himself to live according to his own will is to act

against those very laws of his which nature cannot dispense with as to take that which is the first and fundamental law thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might

if any now upon the apprehension of the truth of this should say this makes me fear and suspect my self because do not find that this giving up of my self is so entire and compleat would have such consider that resignation lies not so much in doing and being all that god requires as in willingness to be and to do all
it is necessary to be and to do all that god requires and we are obliged to this but this resignation lies chiefly in this in being willing to be and to do so that is a speech methinks that falls pat with the condition of the people of god neh
lord let thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servants who desire to fear thy name

but let there be no mistake for when say resignation lies chiefly in a willingness to be and to do all that god requires mark what kind of willingness it is it must be such as is vigorous as puts on to endevors so that it sets the soul down mourning when it finds shortness of power
add this lest any as the world oftentimes doth should hurt

himself by such an excuse as this confess do not but would do well my ways are not good but like them not my heart is better the world will one day see how destructive and fallacious these pleas are

again there is a great difference between sin dwelling in us and sin entertained by us between sin remaining and sin reserved reservation of sin is against the nature of this absolute resignation but a man that truly resigns himself may and doth want power to cast forth of doors every sin and every degree of it no man that hath resigned himself to god doth entertain it he doth not like it nor comply with it he doth not plot conspire or devise how he may save and enjoy his sin he lives not in the purposes of it this is against the nature of resigning our selves to god


this work of resignation is a work once done and yet always doing
when god hath so wrought upon the heart by effectual perswasions and his mighty power god saith am thy god and the soul answers in truth and am thine now is the resignation actually made
but though this be done yet it is still always doing while we are in this world nay to eternity for it's a thing that consists of an iteration of multiplied acts
as wedlock is not one single act

of giving of persons each to other but if they live like married persons as they should there is a dayly giving of themselves each to other their hearts go out every day with complaceney and delight rejoycing in renewing the bond and making the league yet firmer and firmer
it's so between god and us


this resignation is such a thing as when tis once done is never undone
herein this contract of man with god differs from all others in the world for all other contracts have a time to cease by contract one becomes another mans servant for a time
the most durable contract is that of marriage yet it admits of a double breach by death or by divorce but here neither of these take place there's no divorce after marriage with god and no death comes unto that soul which becomes his for these two things hold such a man

the infinite goodness of god with which the soul is so satisfied and contented that it cannot in any constant course and stay continue and give up it self to any other thing no more then a man can be willing to leave the light of the sun to go to live where there is no light but of a candle or to forsake paradise if he were in it to live in a desart

but besides there is not only infinite goodness as an attractive object to hold the soul of man when once come to god but the almighty power of god that holds us to himself and keeps in his way the spirits of such as have resigned themselves unto him
if he that had a bird fly into his brest at sea would not kill it because it came thither for refuge how much more will god preserve those who commit themselves to him you are kept saith the apostle pet

by the mighty power of god through faith unto salvation
if any should say here again is it so where there is a resignation of the soul to god fear am mistaken that break my covenant dayly have said would be his but have broken my word in many things have walked after the counsel of my own heart

answer the covenant between god and man in christ is not broken in particular actions but when violence is offered to the whole law of this contract
there is this difference between this covenant and the first covenant made with adam man stood so engaged that one breach one failing undid him and discharged god but this contract is of a more excellent nature so that it is not this sin and that nor another

sin that dissolves the covenant though they be sins against it and injuries against god yet god doth not hold himself discharged to cast off his people for them
as it is with a father and his child and with the husband and the wife every angry word or neglect of carriage in either is a sin against that relation but not to occasion one to cast off the other but when violence is offered to the whole law of that relation this makes a dissolution

and then though all the people of god have cause to be humbled sinning against a covenant so firm and against such grace and mercy therein yet let them know they have no reason to be discouraged for though through sin that dwells in them they may be in this or that yet that very sin tends to the destruction of sin and god doth break sin by sin as one wave breaks another or as one heat destroys another and as inward diseases are cured by breaking out and rats and mice by coming out of their holes being discovered are destroyed and as evil roots that are in the earth when they appear and shew themselves it tends to their eradication so god the devil in his design who thinks by sin to destroy the soul and god by sin destroys sin

the consideration of the nature of that engagement wherein the souls of saints have engaged themselves to god should be such that sin should be more bitter to them more dreadful then hell it self and it is hardly possible that a man upon the knowledg of the excellency of that grace in this covenant should embolden himself to sin against god

chap

the will of god is the bounds and rule of a resigned spirit

now we come to consider the end of this resignation of our selves to god to what end or for what we do resign our selves unto him
shall express it in these two things

first to be governed and ordered by god in all our motions both inward and outward
when we come to god we come in a state of subordination as inferiors and the end of our coming to god is that he might restore us to our primitive state with some additional grace and favor which state was a state of communion with god but yet in subjection to god
to be under the

government of god lies in these two things


to have the will of god to be our bounds

to have it to be our pattern and rule

the will of god is that which must so circumscribe and confine us as that we are not left at liberty to any action of our own but we must do it by order
there is no creature which god hath made but he hath set certain limits to it which it should not pass as david speaks of the sea psal
god hath set bounds to it which it cannot pass which it cannot go beyond
so god though he hath given unto man a larger compass in point of activity yet he hath not left him without bounds he hath bounded his time and hath set bounds to his power as job speaks chap
his days are determined and the number of his months are with thee thou hast appointed him bounds which he cannot pass
laws are very often expressed by the name of bounds and in hos
it's said concerning the princes of israel that they were as those that removed the bounds that is as fields are set out by boundaries and every man thereby knows his own and is to keep within his compass so god hath bounded these princes and all

the people by laws and constitutions which he had given them but they offered violence to his laws and removed the bounds to enlarge themselves unduly

to be bounded by god is to do nothing but what god either doth command or warrant
in king

it's said to jeroboam god rent the kingdom away from the house of david and gave it to thee and yet thou hast not been as my servant david who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart to do that only which was right in mine eyes that is it was his dayly disposition desire intention and endevor not that he did so indeed for god himself in the very next chap makes an exception at ver
he saith that he did that which was right in the eyes of the lord and turned not aside from any thing he commanded him all the days of his life save only in the matter of uriah the hittite
that is to be bounded when a man doth nothing but what he is commanded or warranted

all things are not commanded that we may do but commands and warrants are the utmost latitude of that freedom which is left to us we have no further to go indeed we need not there is scope enough to keep within these limits
psa
saith david have seen an end of all perfection but thy commandments are exceeding large that is

as if he should say have walked over the fair fields of every creature have looked to the extent of all goodness in them and could see beyond it but when look upon the commandments of god the word of god as it is either mandatory or promisory it is of so vast dimensions so exceeding great that it exceeds all things in this world here is room enough for the spirit of a man that is in true subjection unto god

nay as we have no need to step beyond this bound so if we do it is extravagancy and dangerous and not freedom but bondage it is but as a man that steps out of his way and falls into a pit or as a man that steps from his habitation and slips into a prison it is a dangerous thing for us to enlarge hosea
for this very thing god threatened them he saith because they had withdrawn from him that he would feed them as a lamb in a large place israel slides back as a backsliding heifer now the lord will feed them as a lamb in a large place
like a lamb in a large place what's that like a lamb not kept within her fold and appointed pastures under the and care of a vigilant pastor and shepherd but left to ramble at its own will indeed god saith because they would not be content to live within the bounds that he had set them he would enlarge

them by captivity they should wander from country to country

and as to have the mind of god our bounds is to do nothing but what is agreeable to his will so it is to do all that he requireth
this is that which the lord thy god requireth of thee to do all these things that he hath commanded thee saith moses
all must be done both that wherein we are concerned in common with all men and that which we receive by particular charge from god
every one of us besides the general bonds that lie upon us as men hath something that lies upon us in respect of our particular charge place relation and condition
look to your selves in this that you find your selves bounded here by god else you are at large and free from righteousness
you have many people that will in some measure keep pace with the commandment in general things the worst of men will hear and pray but look to them in their places and there you shall find them extreamly deficient refractory and exorbitant so far indeed as a command of god falls in with their interest and advantage they will own it thus even the worst of men are often diligent in their callings because they live by them but look upon those commands that do most try them wherein they have most occasion

to discover what their spirit is and there you shall find them like wilde asses untamed creatures children of belial without yoke living according to no rule
those relations especially which are in subordination are so ill managed through a spirit of pride that hates all superintendency and whatsoever is above it that to this day they are the burden of the world
but whosoever it is that doth not own god in all things that man is not bounded by god and so is his own man he is left to the guidance of a miserable and destructive creature

when we give our selves to god to be commanded and governed by him it is to a subjection that is absolute and not conditional
when you take a servant it may be he'l say to you when you bid him do this and that it was none of my bargain am contented to be your steward but not to serve you in the stable am contented thus far to serve you but here is my bounds
but when we come to god there is no such treaty we come to serve god absolutely to be at his command absolutely in every thing whatsoever for the law of god is indivisible and indispensible if you cannot give your selves to the obedience of all you have done nothing he that offends in one is

a transgressor of the whole law jam
that is he transgresseth the authority of the whole law and he transgresseth the sence and meaning of the law which was not that we should hold our selves obliged in many things and free in some other but that we should subject and submit our selves to god in every thing you do nothing if not all things
as in a journey of a hundred miles if you be content to go ninety nine and no more you lose the end if you stop there
if god tell you these are my words and i'le have them all looked to and you look to many but not to all at that one gap you enter into death and by that one thing neglected you shut your selves out of eternal life if there be any one way wherein you do not submit unto god in that you are lost
numb
it's said of caleb in comparison of the rest of the people but my servant caleb because he had another spirit and followed me fully
the people did something yea many things that god required of them but at some they stuck and came not off with subjection but saith god my servant caleb had another spirit and he followed me fully or wholly he did whatsoever commanded and that must be the compass of our obedience
the will of god must be our bounds which we must not pass

and to the utmost compass thereof we must endeavor


to be under the command and government of god is when the will of god is our rule and pattern so that we act not the things only that are enjoyned but as they are enjoyned and commanded
you have an example of this in that holy man ezra
when as ezra and others of the rulers with him had declared themselves against the sin of the congregation in mingling themselves in marriage with strangers and had humbled themselves before god with the people shechaniah stood up as in vers
and saith thus now therefore let us make a covenant with our god to put away all the wives and such as are born of them according to the counsel of the lord and let it be done according to the law
the law in case of transgression what doth it require that we return from our obliquities and wanderings with mourning and with abasement that we reform speedily and vigorously with a deep sense of our going from god so would he have their strange wives and children to be put out from among the people of god without delay and with a deep sense of that transgression by which they had offended god

this may suffice to have spoken of the

first branch of the end of our resignation that is to be commanded by god and to be under his government

the second is that we be disposed by him according to his will now that lies in these two things

in a contentation of mind in every condition wherein god sets us to be at peace and silent in our spirits towards god to be answered in our hearts what ever condition god in his wisdom sees good to put us into
this is a blessed lesson to them that have learned it paul had and every good man hath in his measure phil

have learned in whatsoever state am therewith to be content
the greek word for contentment imports that man is well that doth thus he is as if he had all as possessing all things and yet wanting all things
our english word and the latin imports a spirit bounded the spirit of a man contained and kept within his compass and not like water let out of a vessel that runs hither and thither and is lost but kept within its bounds

there is a contentment from the object the thing we enjoy as when that doth fully answer our expectation but that is not thankworthy when a man hath what his heart desires when nothing is wanting there not

to quarrel is no great vertue
but it's a contentment that ariseth from reason and judgment when though a mans condition be not so pleasing yet in respect of him by whom he is disposed and in respect of the end of it and in respect of the ingredients wherewith god mingles his state he is at rest
not that this requires an excluding of all desire to have his state otherwise or an excluding of all grief under the sense of any evil of a mans condition but that the heart run not inordinately and impetuously with desires after change when it is not well with us nor are we dejected and sowred in our spirits because it is ill with us
when christ was near unto death and that cup ready to be reached into his hand he had a desire to escape it and vented his desire in prayer if it be possible let this cup pass from me
but as it was the glory of jesus christ to submit to his fathers will so here is the excellency of contentment in a christian when though he can truly say and may say my case is hard and there is much in it to afflict nature yet will lay my hand upon my mouth that offend not with my tongue will lie quietly under the hand and will of god

that's one branch of our willingness to be disposed by god to be contented in every

state wherein god sets us and he that understands not this hath not yet known god nor seen him mean he that doth not this nor can do it is a stranger to god


a second branch of being willing to be at gods disposing is an indifferency of mind in respect of any possible change whereunto we are called according to the wisdom and will of god to be willing to be changed and poured as water from vessel to vessel according to the will of god
you shall find an eminent example of this in david sam

when zadock was by the ark the king said to him carry back the ark of god into the city if find favor in the eyes of the lord he will bring me hither again and shew me both it and his habitation but if he thus say have no delight in thee behold here am let him do with me as seemeth him good
this must be the language of every spirit that doth own god as his soveraign to whom he hath subjected himself what are those that are the people of god but as sheep before the shepherd that must change their pasture at their shepherds will and wisdom what are they but as soldiers that must march hither and thither as they are cammanded or as vessels in the house that stand to be filled or emptied according

to pleasure or as servants that must go and come as they are bid and not to stay in any place at their wills there are two things contrary to this frame of spirit which must be looked to and taken heed of


the first is an eager and prosecution after any good that we want any thing that we would have or be in this world as it was with rachel give me children or else dye
the soul that runs out thus after any thing in this present world is a soul without bounds hath cast off god denyed his soveraignty authority and command over him


a second thing that is contrary to this is an obstinate cleaving or holding to any state or condition in the world be it never so amiable sweet or suitable to our desires to hold this fast and not to be willing to go out of it when god bids us is to deny god it is not to own god in his power of disposing us according to his will
we must endeavor and it must be in our measure with us as it was with abraham abraham was at ease well saith god get thee out from thy fathers house and from thy country do as bid thee leave all and go to a land which thou hast not seen or known and abraham went
there are some that in the midst of their enjoyments

are as men in chains they are married and cannot endure to think of a divorce from that state it's death to them to think of a change
to be brought into disgrace after honor and after the sweetness of freedom to be brought into bondage they cannot brook it
the prophet habakkuk in chap
speaks of some that lade themselves with thick clay
what's the reason that the treasures of this world are compared to thick clay because when men get into the possession of them they commonly stick fast as men in the mire
but if thou stick fast in the creature thou art separated from the creator if thine heart be in conjunction and a state of confederacy and agreement with any things in this world thou art at odds with god and hast shaken hands with him
this is the first thing which was propounded to be spoken of what resignation of our selves to god is

chap
iii

resignation necessary in prayer
prayer without it hath no truth in it is and imposeth upon god absurdly
the true advantage of a spirit of resignation as to prayer


the second thing is why we must do this when we come to pray

consider if you come to god to ask any thing at his hands which you would enjoy and of which you have great necessity without such a disposition and frame of spirit as you have heard you pray but not in truth there is no truth in your recourse to god thine action is false treacherous and deceitful there is no truth in it
for consider when you come to god you come with a professed sense of your indigence and your dependance upon god if you did not want you would not ask you come with a professed sense of the of god and his dominion over you and you come and say lord and great god and maker of the world
now what false dealing is this with god to call him lord and not yield obedience to him what absurd dealing is this with the holy one the true

god the only wise god to come in this fashion to him it is true he is near to those that call upon him but it is to those that call upon him in truth psal
you have an example of such false dealing with god in psal
and they remembered god their rock and the high god their redeemer nevertheless they flattered him with their mouths and lyed to him with their tongues for their heart was not right with him neither were they stedfast in his covenant
it was an usual thing with this people to come in their troubles and distresses and say arise lord and save us and we will walk with thee but they did lye with their lips and flatter god with their false and dissembling words and minded not what they spake but were deceivers

further when a man comes to god upon any occasion as a suiter not giving himself to god he speaks no sence at all his prayer is a piece of there is no judgment nor reason in it but a heap of contradictions and folly
if any should come to god persisting in the evil of his ways not having his heart set toward god to become subject to him in all things he contradicts himself praying against evil and yet loves evil we pray against a particular evil and we love the greatest evil that

which is all evil and the cause of all evil
what contradiction is here we pray for mercy that god would shew me mercy in this thing and yet we shew no mercy to our selves but do that by which we weaken poyson and destroy our selves and with contentment and yet we come to god and say lord have mercy on us this is folly extremity of folly

when you come to god you come for this or that good lord give me health or give me enlargement or supply me in my necessities deliver me from this danger men come for some particular good and they hate that which is all good the chief and universal good
thou wouldst have life and health in this world but not jesus christ thou carest not for eternal life
what contradiction and folly is this while you cry for good and hate good you walk in ways of contradiction against god and hate him in your hearts you say lord save me when it may be you have some sense upon your spirits of the sad condition of men gone out of the world and of your own present state to be like theirs
thou wouldst have god save thee and yet thou destroyest thy self what sayst thou man wilt thou depart from the evil of thy ways no saith the soul
will any man

hold forth his hand to a chyrurgeon and pray him to cure him and at the same time gash and wound himself would any man pray to the judg sir pray save my life and at the same time drink down poyson and yet this is the dayly dealing of men with god they pray to him but they are fools they offer up most intolerable contradictions to him


except a man come to god with an heart submitting to him he imposeth most strange and horrid things upon god for either he saith in his heart that god knows not what his intentions are he never means nor hath an heart to forsake this or that sin which is to make him no god or else if he thinks that god knows his heart and yet he will take the boldness to come to god and cry for mercy and to be helped and relieved mark what he imposeth upon god hereby he would have god act strangely against his own wisdom the language of that mans prayer is do but save my life at this time and will sin more and more against thee do but let me enjoy mine estate and it shall be the fomentor of my lusts and the weapons of mine unrighteousness against thee do but take off my burden and will be like an untamed ass in the desart
god hath declared and revealed his

wrath from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men that hold the truth in unrighteousness men that know what they should do and do it not yet they are so unrighteous to god and to themselves that they will not suffer this truth to work upon their spirits these men call to god for mercy when as god hath declared that he will shew no mercy to men that walk thus in the stubbornness of their hearts but that his wrath shall burn against them that he will be their enemy and oppose himself to all their wickedness
when thou knowest thy heart is stark naught and art privy to thy secret mischievous intentions unto god and to his truth thou comest to beg of god to shew thee mercy which so much goes against his will see what thou imposest upon the nature of god who is most good and holy thou in the baseness and rottenness of thy heart which holdest a confederacy with sin comest to god in this infinite contradiction wherein thou standest to him and beggest of him that he will take thee into his bosom and be kind unto thee
was there ever such a request made to a man that he would take this serpent and that toad into his bosom know god doth so in effect but then they cease to be such never doth a man put up a prayer to god

with a purpose of continuing in his sin but he imposeth a strange thing on the will of god
micah
it is said they build zion with blood and yet will they loan upon the lord
and you have a pregnant example jer
wilt thou turn when we cry to thee my father will he reserve his anger for ever here is a great sense of evil but saith he thou hast spoken and done evil things and at that very time was the hearts of this people set against god when they came beging praying and crying that god would help them and shew them mercy
that shall suffice for the second thing why when we come to god we must come with resigning of our selves with a hearty giving up of our selves to his commands and in all things to be disposed of by him

a third thing propounded was what argument this is or wherein the force of it lies that we should plead this with god save me for am thine there is a strength in this argument


the law of nature which obligeth a father to be good to his child the husband to his wife
and god hath subjected himself more unto the law of nature he lies more under it then any of these and doth more perfectly fully and gloriously fulfil this law of nature then any ther

is no father like him no friend no husband like him
can a mother forget her child can she yet will not forget thee isai
a mother can hardly do it nature teacheth her to have bowels and a merciful remembrance toward her child much more will saith god


when we can say to god am thine we plead the covenant that god hath made with us wherein he is become our father and friend and this is that which was pleaded in isai
doubtless or surely thou art our father though abraham be ignorant of us and israel acknowledg us not because they are gone and so have no cognisance of us now yet thou lord art our father and our redeemer thy name is upon us
see what a conclusion here is made doubtless thou art our father and therefore we call to thee for help


there is this encouragement and strength that the spirit of a man receives in thus arguing with god that if he can say in truth am thine god much more will say to the creature am thine
if we have so much love to offer our selves to god to become his much more will the love of god make him to become ours for god loves first and most and surest
if mine heart rise toward god much more is the heart of god

toward me because there love is in the fountain

chap
iv

wicked mens prayers not to be dreaded
the sins of those that pray greatest
some outlive the contests of the spirit
three things to be still done by those who have resigned themselves to god

now come to the application
v&se
if there must be such a resigning of our selves to god when we come to him then truly you need never fear the prayers of the men of this world assure your selves they wish you as much evil as it is possible and their hearts cannot love you they envy all your welfare and the constant vote of their spirits is that your day were turned into night and that in stead of light darkness should be round about you but it matters not though they put up such prayers to god they are but bruta fulmina
the reason of it is because they come to god without that which is the nerves and sinews of prayer if they come to god and bow the knee before him that god would bless them and prosper them poor creatures they speak

to no purpose because they deal hypocritically with god for they bow the knee and call him lord as if he were their lord but they do what they list and are their own lords rulers and commanders
hos
god saith the people of israel dealt so with him they did not cry to me with their hearts when they howled upon their beds and assembled themselves for corn and for wine and rebelled against me
they pray that god would do so such a good turn for them but they shut their hearts against god and had a rebellious spirit at the same time though have strengthened their arm yet they imagined mischief against me they are no friends of my cause and kingdom in this world but wish their overthrow though have shewed them mercy
in hos
it's said they have set their hearts on iniquity and it shall be like people like priests and i'le punish them for their ways and reward them for their doings or as the word is will cause their doings to be turned upon them
men may think when they come to god that the sins of so many years past are forgotten that god will not reckon with them for sins so long past and so they come to god in their filth and with their hearts unwashen but saith god they are deceived will turn their ways upon them and though they be

sins of so long time backward yet i'le remember them
in hos
israel cryed to me my god we know thee what saith god israel hath cast off the thing that is good the enemy shall pursue him they have set up kings but not by me
they say my god we know thee no saith god i'le not know you thou hast cast off the thing that is good
mal
you have god expressing himself to this purpose if you will not hear and lay to heart to give glory to my name a man dishonors god and puts the greatest indignity and affront upon god that can be when he refuseth to hear and obey then i'le curse your blessings and cast even the dung of your solemn feasts on your faces
that's a strange thing but it was so their solemn feasts were as dung to god and god saith he will cast them as dung in their faces and they shall be a dunghill which my soul abhors
you need not fear the prayers of such men as are without yoke and fear not god but the prayers of saints are to be dreaded because they have power with god if they come to god and say save me am thine god will answer am thine will save thee


if when we come to god we must make a resignment of our selves to god and acknowledg we are not our own but

his then we learn secondly that the sins of a praying people are the greatest sins there be no sins that are so out of measure sinful as the sins of those that pray and pray most
hath god made thee as a prince with himself hath god set open a door that thou mayst have access to him hath he given thee leave in the day of thy straits to pour out thy soul hast thou in the midst of those mercies in the sense of the sweetness of those visions said to god that thou art his and hast thou departed from him hast thou given to him a withdrawing shoulder as it's said of them this sin is of the highest nature for it is a renewed apostacy
those that are without god and christ in the world are apostates but it is by one apostacy it is a continued act wherein they are held but now thou art gone out from god after thou hadst returned to him thou hast gone from the unspeakable refreshings of the father of mercies and hast offered violence to the many engagements which thou hast layd yea which they have layd upon thy soul thou hast broken the bonds of them all
sins after resignation and after the matter of difference is taken up between god and the creature are not to be easily passed over they are the worst sins
remember your

selves as many as have known jesus christ when you said to god that you would walk with him did you mean it and hast thou fallen from the truth into a lye the world many times come to god and say many good words that they will be his but as it's said of them in psal
they flattered with their lips and lyed with their tongues their hearts were not stedfast in the covenant with their god
they minded no such thing but thou didst and therefore boundst thy self more thou didst intend to be bound when thou engagedst thy self to god thou didst it upon the greatest reason through the enforcement of the highest arguments thou feltst the power of god conquering and subduing thee and thou yieldedst thy self to be his for ever and remember how often thou hast said this to god
is not the voyce of thy soul still in his ears doth not he remember the language thou hast uttered and after thou hast said it again and again that thou wouldst do no more so after thou hast said thou art and shalt be my god for thee to draw back and start aside it's a sin that wants a name it's so haynous in its kind so horrid in its nature
what high injustice is this in thee to arrogate a liberty to thy self whe thou hast so solemnly parted with it into his hands whose it

was nay was it not after thou hadst experience of walking in thine own ways didst thou not know what sin meant it's an argument the apostle useth colos

wherein you sometimes walked
you know what it is to be in your sins
did you not in the day of your sorrow say in your heart will go to god again oh how happy was it when was with him how sweet were those days wherein walked under the government of jesus christ and was blessed with the constant communication of the counsel of the spirit of life and peace was not that thy speech which was the churches hos
i'le go and return to my first husband for then it was better with me then now
now after all this to sin against god to indulge your selves to take a liberty and freedom to transgress against him to whom you have so engaged your selves what a breaking of heart what shame of face should this be when now thou hast put weakness upon the strongest bonds what hast thou said christ is nothing of no account there is more in my sins then in christ there is more in the satisfaction of my own desires then in the enjoyment of jesus christ for thou hast left one for the other
thou didst think it was best when thou didst give thy self to him and what injury hast thou done to the great and holy one

thou hast set light by him to whom to be given thou thoughtst it thy happiness thou thoughtst it wonderful mercy that he would enter into a new contract with thee thou thoughtst that should be an everlasting bond of love upon thy soul that god should again take thee a that he should again admit thee a rebel and a traytor and hast thou forgotten all this is god after all this to be set by that thou canst walk so and do as thou list therefore upon all considerations the sins of those that are much with god are greatest because upon their conversings parlies and treaties that they hold with god still they acknowledg themselves not to be their own but his such therefore shew not the candor and sincerity of a right spirit
it's a sad demonstration of a heart not under the power of divine love and very much alienated from god that upon sight of such miscarriages is not broken and melted
do as much wonder at the spirit and doctrine of some men as at any thing in the world that are lifting the heads of christians above all sorrow that would absent them from all mourning that would have them to be all joy
poor men their language is unnatural they must mourn and cannot but mourn if their hearts be right he that knows and loves god

cannot but feel the pain and burden of offences against him
it's as impossible that nature should cease to feel the smart of stripes and wounds as that a spirit filled with or acted by divine love should not feel the wounds and wrongs that it offers to his maker
hezekiah shewed indeed his frailty chron

but hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his heart that is a word to be observed when a mans heart waxeth proud before god and he can lift up himself and transgress with an high hand when the heart glories in any thing and by the brightness of other things a darkness is cast upon the spirit towards god when this man comes to be humbled it's a great thing hezekiah was in such a case as this yet hezekiah humbled himself

v&se we may further improve this truth by way of exhortation partly to those that yet have not given themselves up to god that have not said in truth am thine and partly to those that have done it
there is a generation of men that are under no bonds to god they acknowledg him not that are free from righteousness as the apostle saith rom
they have not so much many of them as felt the breakings of god and those

contentions whereby he strives with their unkindness and frowardness they never so much as came to debate the matter or treat with god about this great business whether they should be his or no but live at peradventures and are at their own swinge walking after the will of the mind and of the flesh as the apostle speaks

there is another sort that have felt many tuggings of god upon them god hath been hammering the matter upon them but they have stood it out sometimes he hath brought them upon their knees and to tears nay to to condemn themselves in his presence sometimes they have cryed and roared in the presence of god such wretches there are in the world which have the workings of the power of god upon their spirits as those of whom it is said gen
my spirit shall no longer strive with man
god spoke of that evil and wretched world that though he had striven not only by the preaching of noah and of the ark which was a very loud sermon but also with his spirit for there is no generation of men that are ever free from those contests of god but the light that is in them hath pleaded gods cause against their wickedness and lusts well saith god now see they have stood out all this while my

spirit shall no longer strive with man let them alone as he said concerning ephraim hos
the apostles language cor
besides many other scriptures supposeth that there is often a fight in our souls against god bringing every thought of the heart into obedience
that word bringing into obedience signifies a taking of the spirit of man as with a sword or spear god comes and arms himself against men and when he comes thus in power they yield themselves to him and they are blessed
but there are such that always stand out that resist the holy ghost as those jews in acts
or if they yield yet not in sincerity not in truth but as it's said jer
yet for all this her treacherous sister did not turn to me with the whole heart but feignedly or in falshood
now concerning these persons shall say but very few words
canst thou come to god with such a spirit as this what state art thou in man thou must not thou canst not forbear praying at one time or other the worst in the world lift up their eyes and hearts to their maker the very heathens do not cannot withhold from this
if not the light that is in men yet their straits and afflictions will cause them to come as petitioners to god and wilt thou come to god with a petition in one hand

and with weapons of defiance in the other hand wilt thou come to god with the face of a petitioner and with the spirit of a rebel what infinite boldness is this with god have before shewed you the horridness of this kind of prayer and the horrid things that such prayers impose upon god
but consider further whilest thou retainest a resolution and bent of heart set towards thy sin and yet wilt pray thou art in a necessity of sinning do thou what thou canst if thou dost not pray thou sinnest by breaking of a law of nature which enjoyns the creature to acknowledg his dependance upon his maker by prayer and supplication if in the day of thy distress thou comest to ask mercy thou sinnest more
so that thou art as a ship between two rocks that must needs perish upon one there is no escaping so is thy soul in the midst of sin and to be in the midst of sin is to be in the midst of death
and thou every day makest thy condition more unhappy that wherein thou blessest thy self and rejoycest thy prayers are so far from being any reasonable relief unto thee that they are matter of amazement and astonishment to a man that rightly understands
what have done may such a man say have been with god and mock'd him to his face have called

him lord but am not his servant but serve my self and divers lusts called my self his subject but am a rebel
nay this is a blaspheming of god men commonly are afraid of blasphemy but thou that comest to god praying but sinning that is having thy heart upon thy evil ways thou that comest praying but not yielding thou blasphemest god to his face thus to make thy self equal with god is blasphemy it was so judg'd in the heart of that people joh
but they mistook in the case but when thou makest thy self the chiefest of thine own affections thou makest thy self equal with god whose priviledg and supremacy it is to be chiefest in the affections of his creature and to have the highest superintendency over the spirits of his people to command them
nay thou makest thy self greater then god because thou thinkest it nothing to transgress to offend and offer violence to his commands but thou takest all pleasure and contentment in gratifying thine own wicked spirit
thou makest that greatest to which thou most yieldest when thou then yieldest unto sin and leavest god hast not thou made thy self greater then god very high dishonors are offered to god in such a course past expression
mark that in mal
if you will not hear and lay to

heart to give glory to my name will even send a curse upon you
if you will not hear and yield your selves to my commands to give me glory as if he had said if you will not acknowledg me to be what am but deny me if you will not submit to the authority and wisdom of my commands i'le send a curse upon you
and by this means thou dost as thou canst destroy that which doth only difference thee from devils for the devils are cast into that condemnation which shall come upon the world but man hath a possibility to escape now thou dost what thou canst to make thy salvation impossible and to fasten and tye up thy soul to the condemnation of those apostate angels whilest thou refusest to turn unto god from whom thou hast departed and dost not acknowledg the grace and mercy of that open door for poor creatures to return again to the god of mercy

and be sure of this if you be not the lords the lord will not be yours you have such a passage they are not mine break down their bulwarks i'le take no knowledg of jerusalem because she takes no knowledg of me
what a thing is this that god stands with both hands to give out mercy to the creature as it is said of wisdom prov
length of days is in her right hand and in

her left hand riches and honour and that the creature shall bend both his hands against god such a passage you have in micah
men do evil with both hands earnestly
now then consider how much it concerns every one of you that have not yet given your selves to god to do it now
what an unhappy creature art thou if god shall shut out thy prayers when straits fears and death come thy prayers are no more then the howling of dogs and wolves because thou prayest to god and thy spirit is not given up in obedience to him

shall now turn to those who have given up their spirits to god you must do it still when you come to god
faith and love which are two fundamental graces of universal influence to all the rest are to be continually used and acted others are to be acted upon occasion but these have their constant work every day these must be acted
when say that upon our coming to god there must be a giving up of our selves to god mean these three things


that there must be a willing and hearty acknowledgment that we are gods and not our own we must see the bonds of god upon upon us and like it and own it we must hate all other freedom that is offered us we must account it true bondage and be glad

that such a day is come wherein god took us out of our own hands and hath taken us into his
psal
have sworn and will perform confess lord that is my hand and my bond will not for a thousand worlds go back
certainly there should be no other spirit in you when you come to god but to acknowledg your selves to be his and under his commands a christian cannot but do it
partly because he sees his happiness lies in this he sees in his coming again to be the lords there is a restitution of all that blessedness from which he fell by his apostacy
by becoming gods he sees that god also is become his
how may the soul raise it self in joy when it can say this god is my god all he hath and is is mine he is mine to all eternity
the acknowledging of this engagement wherein he stands to god and of gods engaging of himself to him is all his happiness from whence springs all his power and confidence in prayer can go boldly saith he to heaven because god is my god can go and ask all things because he is mine and am his
partly also because he loves him with a love of complacency the soul hath all contentment in him never did a spouse speak to her husband whom her soul loved to the highest more willingly and say am thine then the spirit

of an upright man saith to god lord am thine
and he loves him with a love of thankfulness hast thou given thy self to me saith he and shall then withhold my self from thee hast thou who art so great done all this for me and shall stand out against thee he will willingly acknowledg himself to be his the saints often do this david above twenty times comes with this acknowledgment in this psalm and in psal
am thy servant am thy servant
to say it once was not enough he saith it again to shew the sincerity of his spirit and to witness that his heart was fully pleased with this that he was not his own but the lords


there must be a perfecting and compleating of our resignment all beginnings are but cold yet there are some excellencies in our primitive and first resigning of our selves to god which without great wariness are not preserved till after times
in the day of love when god first comes with terms of peace how freely doth the soul go out and how willingly doth it offer it self to him the flower and beauty of this first love how hardly are they maintained but what ever spirit there is in our first love it is certain that it's imperfect and we therefore live to make it compleat compleat extensively

as our spirits and minds come to be enlarged in the knowledg of the will of god as god makes himself more known saith the soul will do that and that too
and so intensively the heart and soul cleaves unto god in more height and vigor of affection as it is said of jehosaphat who walked with god before and was the lords yet in chron

jehosaphats heart was lifted up in the ways of god his spirit was raised before towards god but now raised to an higher pitch and greater strength he did encourage and fortifie himself in the ways of god

a third thing that must be done is this after any unfaithfulness treachery or base departing from god there must be a renovation of our resignation we must again give our selves to him
having offered this injury to god to deny him his right we cannot again come to him but we must restore it and acknowledg our selves to be his
it was good counsel given job by that friend of his job
surely it is meet to be said unto god have born chastisement will not offend any more that which see not teach thou me and if have done iniquity i'le do no more
with such a spirit you must come to god confess have offered violence to that right thou hast in me but i'le do so no more and

here am a straying sheep have a foolish rebellious heart offer my self again to thy government and to the conduct and and command of thy spirit
there must be in those that have given themselves to god a resigning and giving up of themselves in prayer
consider it in vain else do we pray god hath given us leave to come to him and hath engaged himself to hear us but upon condition there must be a hearing on both sides he hath said that if any man come to him in the stoutness of his spirit he will not regard him he hath abundantly in the scripture disliked such and their prayers he hates
in jer
you have a full expression of this
concerning this resigning of our selves to god it cannot be dispensed with god hath sworn this shall be done rom
as live saith the lord every knee shall bow before me
god will have it done he hath put conditions upon prayer partly because he loves his people he knows there is no greater happiness to them then to cease to be their own and become his
as a father pities his child that wanders abroad in the desart and tells him except he will submit himself to him he will never take him into his house he doth this because he knows the happiness of his child lies in a to his father

again god doth it to put his people into a capacity of having and enjoying the things they ask for what art thou fit for man if thou comest to god as a petitioner and come with thy heart lifted up against him either the good thou desirest cannot come to thee or it will come as a rod and a snare at the best it will be be bitterness to thy soul

consider not to come in sincerity to yield your selves to god is not to come after the law of prayer
when you come to ask of god god then asks of you the requests are mutual and reciprocal when you come to god it is not your business alone but god hath something to treat with you about it is fit if you ask and would have god hear you to have god grant your things but you should grant him his especially considering he is free he needs not give what thou askest but thou art bound to give what he asketh there is no proportion between that which thou askest of god and that he asks of thee god asks of thee to give up thy self and what art thou fit for a creature more contemptible then a rotten carkass that lies in a ditch wel saith god as bad as thou art let me have thee give up thy self to me
and what dost thou ask of god pardon and eternal life
besides god spake

first you come indeed and ask but god spake first thou sayst lord hear my prayer but saith god my words are gone out first hear me
god prevents thee with requests and hath been long waiting upon thee that thou wouldst come in and give up thy self to him

consider what it is that you come for what do you plead with god for you would have god to be yours to do you good to the utmost not to withhold any good thing from you then will you grant god this one request when you ask so many of him you ask a thousand things of god god asks but this one of you give up your selves to him
you would have god to be yours for ever if you ask so great things is it not meet that you should restore god his ancient right surely god is full of grace and mercy unto his people they can set their seals to this that he is a god hearing prayer see what an ingenuous acknowledgment the apostle makes of the goodness of god joh
we know that he hears us what ever we ask of him and we know that we have the petition that we desire of him
it's in effect as much as this we can have what we will of god
you that walk with him what is it that you may not get of him you never come for any thing and

go away empty he hath not denyed you even to himself therefore it much concerns you when you come to god to give up your selves to him
certainly this resignation is a work of a sad import we must resign our selves we must be gods we were his before this imports that dreadful violence that man hath exercised upon gods patience that should humble us and forward the work when we come to resign our selves because we were before his

let me shut up all with this exhortation that when you have been with god and made this acknowledgment that you are his and have dealt in truth with god and when god hath shew'd you the mercy you came for now stand fast in your own word and perform it break not your word with him to whom you have thus engag'd your selves
if you mind you may have a true description of your own spirits you shall see the right face of them upon change of seasons
hast thou been a begger in the day of thy distress art thou enlarged is the mercy come now observe thy spirit now see what frame thy spirit is in towards god when thy way is made smooth and storms are layd and thou art at rest
observe it men are very apt to promise in a day of trouble oh upon a sick bed if god

would restore me would walk more exactly with him in a day of fear what is more common then to say so and as in deut
when they heard the word of god repeated to them they shut up all with a professed willingness to submit and when the curse was read all the people said amen so be it but it was not so
in chron

you have that wicked king coming to god crouching before god and offering himself before him but it was not done effectually what ever thoughts he had at that time that he would be the lords they went off again
men come to god by the enforcement of distress and say much but are the same afterwards they take up new words but their hearts are what they were before
jer
have planted thee a noble vine have broken the yoke and burst the bonds thou saidst will not transgress but what was the temper and frame what was the spirit of this people indeed when under every high hill and every green tree thou playest the harlot
she had a whorish and a wicked spirit even then when she said to god i'le not transgress
so in chron

you see what a fair appearance there was josiah being stir'd in spirit to think that the lord god should be so far out of sight and mind and knowledg and knowing what danger they

were in because of neglecting the commandment of god he humbled himself and the people joyned with him and engaged themselves unto god and there was great joy and alacrity among them and there was such an appearance such a passover as never had been notwithstanding at chap
it's said that they mocked the messengers of god and despised his word and misused his prophets so false are the hearts of men it concerns you therefore to look to your intentions in this thing

consider that the word is gone out of thy mouth thou hast promised to god that thou wilt be his if thou hast not done it formally thou hast done it virtually there is of the nature of a promise in all prayers no man can come to god as a petitioner but he comes with an acknowledgment of him as his lord therefore having promised thou oughtst to stand to it a promise binds always but chiefly in such cases as these

where the thing we promised was due before it was promised so was this if thou hast said thou wouldst give thy self to god that was due before


where the performance of the promise brings no loss or detriment if thou fulfil thy promise thou losest not by it thou partest

with nothing that will do thee good in that thou thy self becomest the lords it is thy perfection and thy happiness it is a coming to the very state of angels
no creature can possibly be happy but in a subordination to him that is the supream god blessed for ever having promised therefore make good thy word


consider that by being with god and having obtained the things you sought for you have now an advantage to walk as the lords to make good your word
partly because your way is enlarged it's a hard thing to walk with god in ways full of bryars and thorns it's hard to walk through seas of blood and mighty storms and tempests
but now when god smooths thy way and removes thy fears and gives thy spirit more composedness it's a mighty advantage in thy hand and therefore to be improved
david was of this spirit psal
will run the ways of thy commandments when thou shalt enlarge my heart the meaning is fears and sorrows compress and burden me and make me walk heavily as a man under a weight but if thou wilt scatter these clouds and deliver me from these straits and comfort my soul if thou wilt cheer refresh and enlarge me then will run thy ways i'le not only walk in them but walk

with all alacrity and celerity entered upon these words when the sword was upon the march and fear was upon us terribly
hath god appeared delivered and saved you yea are the clouds of blood scattered and fallen upon the heads of our enemies you have the desire of your souls the bryars are removed your way is plain now walk with god fulfil your word to him to whom you have given up your selves

this advantage also you have from the greatness of the mercy great mercies do awaken the soul renew refresh and enliven the souls of men
now if god hath put thee upon the wing defer not but now up and be doing pay thy vows before thy heart grow cold it is a great thing to lose impressions when they are lost they are hardly regained
david lay long before he was the same that he was before his fall it cost him much pains it may be if thou grow cold again that god will heat thee in a fiery furnace he hath ways enough to visit upon thee the neglects of the seasons of grace
you may see how he expresseth himself in anger against his people hos
wo to thee for thou hast fled from me destruction unto thee because thou hast transgressed against me though have redeemed them they have spoken lyes against me though have

strengthened their arm yet they have imagined evil against me
when a people are bound by mercies and yet obey not it displeaseth
god was very angry with hezekiah for what because he did not return according to the mercies he had received
surely the mercy you have received is great it must be measured by years and ages it is not one mercy but a multitude a heap of mercies look how many mischiefs the wrath of malicious men would have heaped upon you look how many evils your own fearing hearts could devise and suggest so many mercies are in this one
if therefore thou hast sought god and god hath heard thee remember when thou didst come to god thou didst come upon such terms not to receive only but to give thou hast promised to be his make good thy word thou didst say in thy distress am thine lord save me say now in the day of thy deliverance am thine lord for thou hast saved me

chap


the knowledg of interest in god doth much further our approaches to god
it begets propensions carries the spirit in a due frame fits it for all divine determinations

there is yet something more in the words worthy of our consideration am thine what's the fruits of this apprehension of god his drawing near to god am thine save me

the knowledg of our interest in god doth much further our approaches to god
doctr
when a man is once assured and can say with a clear spirit am thine this man is a man of prayer he is much in addresses to god and conversing with him
shall give you the sence and import of this point in these two or three things

first that when god out of his unspeakable goodness hath broke through the dark cloud that was between him and us and hath made this good to our hearts that he is ours this begets an inclination and propension an aptness to have recourse to god and converse with him
a child that knows his father though strangers pass by him and take no notice of him yet he loves to be

with him and the more he hath the nature of a child the more he loves to be where his father is
so much more is the conjunction of the soul with god and the enjoyment of god the portion of a child of god there it loves to be and if it might there it would be and no where else
this interest is such that it begets desire upon desire that the soul hath never enough of god there is a constant spring of motion toward god that makes the soul to hang after him as after that in which its life is
in psal
saith david god thou art my god what then early will seek thee my soul thirsts for thee my flesh also longs for thee
such a man needs not much driving when he is himself he is drawn of god he needs not much to be driven by other things
my soul thirsts
you need not force a thirsty beast to the river do not withhold her and she will run her self there needs no law to bind a man that is hungry to eat his meat do but set meat before him and he will eat willingly he will not withhold his hands
that man that hath this sealed up in his soul that god is his cannot nor will for ten thousand worlds be held from communion with him he breaks through all things he accounts all other time but what is necessary ill spent in comparison of that time

he spends with god if he were at his own choyce he would have no other employment nor be put upon any other service then to wait upon god and be wholly his
an ingenuous child that carries his father in his heart though at his fathers command he be content to go hither and thither as david to keep sheep in the field yet he had rather be at home where he may speak with his father and hear his voyce and have communion with him
god is so good to his that where once a man finds himself to be his he finds such streams of mercy and goodness flowing forth as knit his soul to him
when he comes to him he comes not as to a great god but as to his own father and god entertains his not as strangers but as children with the entertainment of a father his entertainments are so sweet that they are new invitations so that a man who hath been with god in a right spirit is not glad that the time is past but longs for that season to come again
yea god shews himself kind with the best advantage kind in great things and those things that are the very desires of their souls those things that men cannot be without without pain anguish and bitterness of spirit those he gives
when their souls are in trouble then he easeth and comforteth them how often have his people

come to him in tears heaviness and much mourning and he hath wiped away their tears and scattered the clouds that were about them and given rest to their souls in psal
love the lord because he hath heard my prayer and the voyce of my supplication because he hath inclined his ear unto me therefore will call upon him as long as live
the sorrows of death compassed me about and the pains of hell caught hold on me found trouble and sorrow
the force and spirit of it is this came to god in a sad time and god shewed me kindness seasonably seeing he hath been so kind to me will call on him as long as live i'le go often to him i'le live in the presence of god i'le be much with him because of his kindness to me

interest will carry a man according to the worth and sufficiency that is in him in whom he hath interest and according to his own wants and indigency
now the interest of the people of god in god is in one that is most glorious and it's the interest of such as have most need none can do for them what he can do
now if a man have treasure of his own will he want will he not go to it if a man thirst and have rivers that run by him if he have springs of his own will he not drink of them so it is with the people

of god when they see god to be their god they see all to be their own in god and therefore will not suffer want but will go to him
yea indeed the interest of the people of god in god is mingled with such ingenuity and such a spirit of love that when they have not much cause to go to god as beggers when necessity doth not pinch and enforce them then they go upon friendly visits
it's great content to a child to see his father though he ask him nothing
it's great content to an ingenuous spirit to come to god as his friend to behold him and refresh himself in that infinite glory wherewith he is clothed though for the present he be not much pinched with necessities and straits
so david psal
as for me will come into thine house in the multitude of thy mercies
in the multitude of thy mercies not only that will make this mine argument which i'le plead with thee not that this shall be that on which my soul shall lean but even when thou art very good to me in the multitude of thy mercies towards me will come not as others that come only when they need something but when thou art most gracious to me then will come
thus the knowledg of a mans interest in god works in his heart an inward inclination and strong propension to make

his addresses to god and converse with him

secondly the knowledg of this interest carries the spirit of a man to god in a due frame and posture that is it maintains the soul in its addresses to god in joy and confidence cheerfulness and hope yet with intermixtures of awful fear
a man that knows god to be his god when he goes to him he goes not as he to whom augustus said what dost thou come to me as to a lion he comes not with that astonishment dread and amazement that men do when their consciences are defiled and in whose spirits the fire of hell is
he is not afraid notwithstanding the infinite distance between god and him to lift up his face before the almighty he comes with boldness and confidence when once he is in the sight of this that his name is written in the book of life and that god hath taken him into the number of those whom he hath chosen out of the world
he comes and speaks to god and his language is as to one with whom he hath power psal
will say unto the lord thou art my god hear the voyce of my supplication lord
he tells you what language he useth to god said thou art my god therefore hear me when come unto thee and this argument is very strong
so

in micah
you have the church expressing her self thus therefore will look to the lord and wait for the god of my salvation my god will hear me the conclusion is very strong
so in psal
god even our own god shall bless us
when a man once comes to know that god hath taken him into the number of his into his flock and fold now saith he god is mine my own god shall bless me

that faith which makes a man see his interest in god makes him see that it's more to have an interest in him then to obtain all things from him he therefore goes with courage to god because he hath obtained that already which is more then all comes to that he shall have by asking
it was a greater favor for god to give us himself to be ours then for him to give us a portion among the angels in the glory of heaven

god being our god stands engaged he is not his own but ours also therefore when a man sees this he comes to god for all things as to his own and he comes for his own
as a child that is in want speaks to his father for supplies he speaks to him as one in whom he hath interest and pleads with such a spirit as knowing that he likewise hath interest in his fathers estate
indeed this interest is the best of all it's founded

upon all reason which ways soever a man comes to have interest in another so many ways hath god exprest our interest to be in him and more also
by creation he hath made us we are not our own psal
or he hath made us we are his
it's founded in redemption in isai
thus saith the lord that formed thee jacob and created thee israel fear not have redeemed thee have called thee by name thou art mine have made thee and have bought thee
it's likewise founded in that union that we have with jesus christ god is become ours because christ is become ours the sons wife calls his father her father he is become a father to her in his son
if god takes notice of israel upon this account that they were the seed of abraham his friend how much more will he own his people that are members of the body of his own son in isai
thou israel art my servant whom have chosen the seed of abraham my friend
we become his and he ours by his actual admission of us into the number of those that are his own and of the houshold of god ephes

they are said to be a people near unto him psal
all souls are mine saith god in ezek
but those whom he admits into his family he takes peculiar notice of and they are in a more

especial manner his
and also by actual communion he becomes ours as the wife becomes the husband's not only by contract and marriage and receiving her to his habitation but by actual communion so we are the lords because of that actual converse that we have with god and by his communication of those fruits of his love which he reserves for his own
thus then the knowledg of our interest with god clothes the spirit with fit dispositions and affections in addresses unto god as to joy and confidence
now on the other side it works also in the soul an awful reverential respect such as becomes the relation of a poor creature to his maker and that infinite distance that is between the high and holy one and a lump of dust which also belongs to the true temper of a man in communion with god
serve the lord with fear and rejoyce with trembling psal
and mal
if be a master where is my fear it's a dangerous thing for a man upon presumption of his interest in god to have a boldness without a mixture of this fear and awfulness
such joys are not from above nor is it the spirit of truth that bears witness to them when they do not lay the soul much under god
of all men they come with the greatest fear of god that have the fullest knowledg of

their interest in god and who have their hearts most spread with joy and gladness because god is become their portion
in heb
wherefore receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby to serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear
that seems a strange inference having received a kingdom therefore serve god with fear saith the apostle and god looks for it and know if it be not done there will be hazard in it for our god is a consuming fire
a stranger passeth by a man and takes no notice of him but a child that knows him to be his father comes toward him with respect and honour the very interest he hath in him and the relation wherein he stands strikes on his spirit an awe towards his father
so it is with those that call god father

see what account nehemiah gives of his just walking in nehem

other rulers did so and so but did not for feared god
the assurance of the love of god and of a mans eternal life begets fear not that fear which hath torment as the apostle speaks but it begets an awful caution and wariness as is meet in a business of so great concernment
he is more afraid to offend god that knows god to be his god then that man is

whom god threatens every day with everlasting death
mark that of the prophet hos
it is spoken concerning the time when they should be restored to a better state afterwards shall the children of israel return and seek the lord their god and david their king and shall fear the lord and his goodness in the latter days
shall fear the lord and his goodness
no father is more feared of his child then the best father that walks towards his child in the greatest wisdom goodness meekness and bounty
so that the kindness of god and tastes of his love do not lift up the soul and make it proud
that man is the most humble man in the world that hath the most knowledg of the love of god towards him in jesus christ
this fear and faith do so stand together that they cannot be separated
in act

they walked in the fear of the lord and in the comfort of the holy ghost
it's the right temper of a true christian to have the comforts of god in his soul and yet to be with fear and trembling
it's a fear that doth inevitably arise upon a rectified nature from a sight of the disproportion that is between god and us
this is in heaven it self where the angels in glory beholding god so infinitely lifted up above them cannot but have reverence fear and dread in their souls towards

him
and it's a fear likewise of danger not the danger of eternal death for from that they are saved the knowledg of the love of god assures them for that but from the danger of other things which to them are as bitter as death is to the world and those are the frowns of god the rebukes of god the suspensions of love and estrangedness of god towards them the stripes of god these things when god doth as a father to his that know him they are most grievous and smarting and their souls groan under these more then worldly men under worldly danger
therefore he that knows god and what it is to be in the light of his countenance he that hath tasted the bitterness of the loss of this lives in fear lest he should provoke god as a father to deal thus in severity with him
and speak all this the rather because some do blaspheme that which is the spring of life and peace to the saints saying that for a man to have the knowledg of god to be his god and everlasting portion is a snare to bring that man into a forgetfulness of god and his duty and to blow up the spirit with pride and lull him into a sinful sleep
such like things as these have been and still are not without much cause of grief cast upon this blessed doctrine of the knowledg of

our abode with god whereas the true knowledg of god being ours is that which doth effectually and firmly work the heart to all diligent watchfulness tenderness and sedulity

thirdly it disposeth a mans spirit to the best entertainment of all divine determinations that are upon a mans addresses to god upon any occasion
let the answer be what it may be what seems good to god that man that knows god to be his god is best enabled to receive his answer be it or no whether his prayer succeed or not he is put into such a frame that he can say amen to the will and word of god and go from god without murmuring and repining
if god hear him he is glad but yet not so glad of the thing as of his interest he is not so taken with any thing he obtains but god takes him more if therefore he receives any thing he rejoyceth in it as the fruit of love and makes a grateful return to god again
in psal
save my soul and it shall praise thee
he rejoyceth in this to see how welcome he is to god and that his prayer is accepted others come and are not regarded but he hath audience the things that god gives out to him have another form and taste then to the world they come all with tastes of love to him in love

to my soul saith hezekiah hast thou delivered me in isai
and whatsoever he hath he hath a better enjoyment of it then others by reason of his interest in god he hath nothing from god as a meer gift but he hath god with itÂ· god saith to that man that hath interest in him there take that which thou askedst for and me with it that is thine and am thine and the enjoyment of god is more to him then all the world
this spirit is upon all that he hath my father gave me it it is the fruit of the love of the god of my life therefore must use it in order according to order from him and not after my mind only
all things are best enjoyed when they are enjoyed according to rule
we spoil the sweetest things when we take them according to our wills and so use them then they become another thing
when a man can sit in his enjoyment of all things and see god this is a drop from the fountain of life and it is more then they have that seem to enjoy a thousand times more of the things of this life whose corn and oyl increase

and if he be denyed if god see it not good to give him the things he desires yet he is satisfied he doth not contend with god nor doth his spirit rise up against his maker he hath a word ready in his spirit

not my will but thy will be done he saith if my god will not give me this it is well that he will give me himself may be without this but could not be without him and seeing he hath given himself to be my portion will wait with patience and be content all the days of my life
in eccless

ult saith solomon if god give a man the joy of his soul he shall not much remember the days of his vanity
when god denies him any thing he remembers that he comes not to god for this particular thing but for the best good we come not to god for any thing but that which is for our good
a good man saith if had this thing it may be it would not do me good and herein his spirit is satisfied he saith god knows better then what is good for me and if he thinks not such a thing meet for me must think so too
so you see how the knowledg of a mans interest furthers his approaches to god and helps him in these three respects that we have mentioned

chap
vi

how the knowledg of divine interest doth promote holiness sets judgment and nature against sin keeps the heart from inordinate reaching after and holding fast present things
faith binds the soul and keeps it bound makes all a christians ways easie
assurance gives a double advantage to our great meeting with god

in this chapter shall in some particulars shew how the knowledg of our interest in god doth promote and further our walking with god in all holiness

in the first place when a man hath tasted those comforts that flow from this interest sin to that man is sin indeed it's out of measure sinful
an assurance of our propriety in god represents sin in its deepest colour and causeth it with the most afflicting resemblance to reflect upon the spirit
the knowledg of our pardon doth not put an end to our sorrows it rather begins them
the sight of god reconciled doth not work that peace that is without sorrow but makes those streams run deeper and purer
the more a man knows that he shall not dye for sin the more he is under a necessity of bewailing

his sin and it's as natural an effect of the sight of god to have the heart pierced and wounded as healed
david when nathan told him that he had sinned and when he knew that his sin was done away then was he most candid most serious and strong in his humiliation before god
those men that pretend to have their joys from their pardon and reckon god to be theirs and yet can pass over their sins with dry eyes drink their refreshing waters not from him who is the well of life but from beneath and are under a spirit of depravation and delusion and such a spirit as will seal them up to everlasting condemnation
nothing becomes the saints more then mourning
the proper working of love in heaven is joy because there is nothing but good but the proper working of love here is joy with grief because though god be good to us yet we are evil against him
in ezek
you have this expression by god himself then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that were not good and shall loath your selves for your iniquities and for your abominations
when if you look in the verses before it is when god should come to do them the greatest good when he would cause his face to shine upon them and make his footsteps to drop down

blessings then saith god when have you upon the knee and satisfied your souls with goodness then shall you remember your own evil ways and your doings that have not been good and you shall loath your selves for all your abominations
the knowledg of absolution in heaven breeds the severest condemnation in the hearts of the saints the more they see they are accepted the more that voyce sounds in their ears thou art comely and fair my beloved the more do they point at their spots and have an eye upon their own spirits am black saith the church the sun hath stained my beauty though god said she was all fair and comely
christ saith to paul thou art a chosen vessel what saith paul of himself all along was a persecutor and a blasphemer
he read it as if it were wrote in a table always before his eyes
not only sin in act but sin in temptation the very solicitations to sin are grievous to that man that hath received a testimony from heaven that his name is written in the book of life and that god whose name is god blessed for ever is his god and father
remember joseph what he said gen
how can do this great evil and sin against god above all sin in their nature as it dwells in them and acts in them incessantly and renders them in

such a contrariety to the nature and will of god this is that which doth mightily humble and abase them not only as it is displeasing to god but also as it puts them into an incapacity of serving him and having communion with him
the more sin is in us the less we see of god
matthew
vers
blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god
see him not only in heaven but as they are pure and are sanctified as they are more filled with the spirit of holiness so they shall have clear visions of god and more full acquaintance with god here
now the assurance of our interest in god making sin to be thus vile and setting the soul at such a distance from it is a great furtherance to holiness it sets the judgment against it and not only the judgment for so it may be in the worst of men but it puts the nature of the man against it
a child knows in his judgment he ought not to wound his father but there is something in his nature that he cannot do it besides the force of his judgment as esther in chap
expresseth this natural force how can endure to see the evil that shall come upon my people or how can endure to see the destruction of my kindred see how resolution wrought with her how can endure how can endure

to see these things so saith the soul that hath a sight of god how can do thus against god that's one thing

in the second place the knowledg of this blessedness that god is become ours calms quiets and moderates the heart towards all things so that there is neither that inordinacy of reaching after or holding fast these present things as there was before
besides this it works an holy contentment in our present estate an holy indifferency to any future possible condition according to the will and wisdom of god
when once a man hath tasted of this interest and hath seen the favour of the great god in the face of jesus christ he looks no more after other lovers but shakes them off according to the measure he hath attained
as in a house more noble things take place and dust and things of no value are cast out so when this pearl of infinite worth takes place in the soul when once a man lives in an enjoyment of god he dyes so far to all things else
in gal

saith the apostle having said before that christ lived in him am crucified to the world and the world is crucified to me the world looks on me as a dead thing with whom it would not converse and look on the world as a dead corps and have nothing to do with it it is of no value

with me
when ruth was married to boaz she forsook the field and gleaned no more when she had got boaz estate she minded no more to gather handfulls of corn by gleaning
if any man saith christ drink of these waters he shall never thirst he shall not need to dig any other pits these waters shall content him his desires shall be so confined contented and contracted to this one thing
a mans interest in one is according to the person in whom it is he that hath interest in a prince will not be drawn away by beggers
when saul had found a kingdom he minded no more the asses which he was seeking
when the people of god had freedom to come to jerusalem they were willing to leave babylon
this is a great piece of holiness for a man to be separated from this world in his affections that he can steer through the world untouched that he may be in the use of creatures but not come in bonds under the power government and force of them now when a man sees god to be his god this makes him to be as christ speaks of his they are not of this world as am not of this world joh
this comfort dissolves all bonds and sets free from a confederacy with other things and now the whole world is of little force with him
moses is a pregnant example of span missing

this in hebr
by faith moses when he was come to years or when he became great refused to be called the son of pharaohs daughter chusing rather to suffer affliction with the people of god then to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season
what was the reason the text gives you these reasons that he had respect to the recompence of reward at the twenty sixth verse and because he had seen him who was invisible at the
verse so that the sight of god and the sight of our interest in him lays the world dead casts a darkness upon the glory of it and the soul is taken with nothing in comparison of him

thirdly the sight of our interest holds the soul in bonds unto god it doth not onely bind it but hold it bound
the love of christ saith the apostle constrains us cor
it holds us to god that though there be something in us that makes us apt to excursions to go out from him yet we are held in by bonds of love
this interest must needs be of a mighty force to those that see it because its the highest interest in the sweetest way god gives us such an interest in himself as a child hath in his father and as a spouse hath in her husband which are interests of greatest love
its an interest of constant communion there are constant

effluxes of the kindness of god upon that soul that knows god to be his which do bind him every day more and more and leave him less his own
this is the nature of the spirit of adoption that makes a man cry abba father it makes him more a child as willing to acknowledg himself in that state of subordination as a child as he is to look up to god in a way of hope as he is the father of mercies

the assurance of the love of god as it comforts so it conquers the soul
it doth not work it into a strange kind of mad rejoycing such as the spirit that is gone forth begets in the hearts of many at this day who are strangers to the life of god yet boast as if they had drunk deep of the cup of consolation whereas they are loose and careless and can do all evil against god and be free from him and not have their hearts touch'd with it at all
but now true gospel comfort that which he who is the god of all comfort gives by the manifestation of himself in conjunction with the creature doth overcome the heart and put it into a willing necessity and strengthens it to walk in all before him so that the soul cannot go from him
in psalm

david expresseth this because thou hast been my help therefore in the shadow of thy wings

will rejoyce my soul cleaveth unto thee for thy right hand upholdeth me
as if he should say thou hast done me good and thine hand hath supported me else should fall at every step live upon thee therefore my soul followeth after thee or is glued to thee the expression of thy love and constant goodness towards me is that which binds my soul unto thee

fourthly when a man knows god to be his god and there is no more remembrance of sin against him and that he is received into the inheritance of the saints and of christ himself and that god is become his father now all his ways are made easie this facilitates all
for what are those things that are wont to burden a mans spirit in the race which is set before him it is either because there are such sad things in his way or because a man fears whether his work and service shall be accepted or because he doth not like his work or because he is not satisfied about his wages now it is manifest that the knowledg of this that god is our god removes all these things he cannot dislike his way that sees god in it he cannot dislike that work which god sets him about he cannot but think he is accepted and that his wages is more then sufficient recompence that knows god to be his god
joh
the apostle saith

that to him that loves the commandment is not grievous
it is no burthen in comparison so far as a man loves so far his work is easie and sweet to him what's the reason its given in the next words follwing because he hath overcome the world for there is nothing except darkness upon a mans spirit which is a spring of fear and doubt concerning his acceptance with god that clogs a mans spirit in the ways of god that sharpens and imbitters the things which we must grapple withall say nothing can hurt him but this now a man that sees god to be his god hath overcome the world
and if his case be dangerous such wherein he is tempted on the right hand he saith with paul pass not care not for all these things as moses cared not for all the riches of pharaohs court
and as paul when he was tempted upon the left hand pass not for all these things neither shame trouble reproach stripes imprisonments and the like
and esth
in that service for the people of god see saith she it's the will of god should do it ile go and if perish perish such an impression doth the sight of god leave upon the spirit that nothing can stop the soul in its course no more then the sun in the firmament
others go heavy and are soon tyred

as god complains in mal
they say also what a weariness is it that is to attend upon god in his worship and they snuff at it in way of dislike or as men that would blow away something which lies in their way and which they dislike
upon all these considerations nothing promotes holiness more then the knowledg of this that god is ours
to that which hath been said will only add a double advantage that this assurance gives to our meeting with god


that it doth allay that unquietness that is ready to rise upon the thoughts of dissolution and the remembrance of that day of doom when one word determines a mans estate to all eternity
to know that a man is going to his god and father to be able to say as christ said go to my father this will banish those fears from the soul and make a man to go out of the body with peace as one that knows whether he is going even out of an unquiet sea to a quiet harbor which he sees fair before him and where he shall be free from danger
this is that which john speaks of epist

herein is love made perfect the love of god is herein perfected hath its utmost sweetness efficacy and operation that we may have boldness in the day of judgment
it doth secure and quiet our spirits and doth answer all sad thoughts

of the soul that we may have boldness in that day because as he is so are we in this world because as he is faithful and real in his love to us so we are faithful and real in our love to him so that there is a firm union and conjunction between god and us

another advantage is that assurance makes the heart to long after god and to be with jesus christ
that most assured saint paul was by faith put into this temper and having a sight of those things within the vail and looking at them as before him how abundantly as one burdened doth he groan and sigh that he may be in the enjoyment of those things whereof he had a sight and hope so that it is of very great concernment for a man to know god to be his god in reference to his appearance before him at the last day

my exhortation to you all therefore shall be that you would labor to make your interest certain that you may be able to say with job know that my redeemer lives and as david in the text am thine
a man cannot be a good man that drives not after this he knows not god at all that hath no desire of this assurance
that man also what ever he knows of god is in a sad miserable and wretched condition that doubts whether god be his god that lives floating

between hope and fear and yet lives without vehement desires and endeavors to have this question cleared
certainly you cannot be right if you have not such a desire of the enjoyment of this interest to be able to say god is my god
this we are to seek in truth and purity not to the quieting of our spirits only or to the indulgence of the flesh as many seem to long after the consolations of god that know not what they are but that god having so filled us we may become a sacrifice to him
you must effectually prosecute this also in the utmost improvement of your might and power without ceasing till you have obtained it till you have that word sealed up in your souls son daughter be of good comfort for thy sins are forgiven thee lift up thy head for thy maker is thy husband
it is the greatest folly in the world for christians to pretend a life of faith and cut the life and sinews of just and necessary endeavors for the attaining assurance of the love of god
a man should take heed of presuming upon god when he cannot say god is his god and he must take heed of pretending to live a life of faith in such a way that weakens his endeavors after assurance
certainly the same principle that carries a man from the world to god will make a man restless till he knows that god

is his god and what things are contained in that interest which things as it is a great grief not to know so if they be clouded it is usually from gods displeasure by which the soul is left fluctuating tossing rouling and wasting it self in anxieties clouds and perplexing doubts
say not that it's always from displeasure because god hath other ends then he hath acquainted us withall yet say usually it is so
but as a wise father full of bowels if he be strange to his child or take any relation of love if it be clouded and darkened it usually betokens all is not well something is amiss
so say thou mayst justly suspect and take occasion to make a search what is the difference between god and thee and what is the cause of those clouds that are interposed between god and thy soul
in isai
god tells us the spring of this evil in a little wrath for a moment hid my face
in a little wrath
so that the suspending of comfort from our spirits leaving the souls of men dubious and anxious about this great matter doth usually betoken displeasure all is not well

REASONABLE REQVEST AND PROTESTATION OF W. Fulke to all learned Papists.
FOrasmuch as there is no ende of writing bookes (as the wise man sayth) and that the truth of argumentes is best discerned when it is brought vnto the iudgement of Logicke, which is the arte of reasoning: If any of the learned Papistes will reply against these, and other mine aunsweres, require that (as well for their owne ease, as that may haue time to peruse them, and the readers no impediment, but that they may clearely iudge of them,) they wil leaue of all vayne discourses, and needelesse questions, and only conclude the co~trouersies of religion that are betwene vs, in the strict forme of Logicall argumentes.
If to this reasonable request they refuse to yeelde, protest before God and the world, that they shew them selues thereby to be enemies of the truth, that they flie the light, and dare not abide the triall.

RETENTIVE TO STAY GOOD CHRISTIANS IN THE TRVETH OF THE GOSPELL, WRITTEN BY Fulke against the Motiues of R. Bristow, and by him directed to his friends of the Popish Church.
AMong such English papistes, as haue written within these twentie yeares, against the religion of God nowe mainteyned by publike authoritie in this Realme, some haue shewed greate witte, some muche readinge, some flowing eloquence, some all these indifferently: but among them all, none hath shewed lesse witte, learning, or good vtterance, then this Richard Bristow.
So much the more doe meruell, when heare that many Papistes make so great accompt of his witlesse and senselesse writinges.
But it fareth with them, as with litle children, to whome newe trifles seeme alwayes most worthy to be played with al.
And verily had thought of all other, least to haue delt against this peuish prater, both because he bringeth no newe matter, but such as in other of his cote, was with more coullor of trueth set foorth before, and also for that had alreadie made aunswere to Ryshtons challenge, which as take it, is that table of the Church, which Bristowe confesseth to conteine all his demaundes, whiche demaundes are almost all conteined in his motiues.
But my friendes requiring mee not onely to aunswere this, but all other writinges also of the papistes, what soeuer they haue set foorth in the englishe tongue since the happie raigne of our soueraigne Ladie, haue condescended to confute euen that which deserueth no confutation, and somewhat the rather, because Bristow would haue this alone to bee a sufficient motiue vnto poperie, that wee hauing nothing to gainesay most of their popish bookes, haue not dared, (I vse his owne wordes) once to goe about the aunswering of most of the saide Catholikes bookes.
But are faine to get them forbidden by proclamation, althoughe ourselues haue prouoked confidently the Catholikes to write them.
Whervppon also he noteth that Iewels challenge is turned into proclamations, how rightly or truly, he that hath but halfe an eye may see.
His preface to the reader, conteining neuer an argument or motiue which is not repeated either in the treatise it self of motiues, or in the demaundes, will passe ouer, and come to the firste motiue, gathering the principall contentes out of his owne table, as haue done with the rest.
The verie name of Catholikes a certaine marke of right Catholikes.
For Catholikes (saith he) were present as lookers on and earnest defenders.
What then but none such were moderators saue onely lay Lordes and vnlearned heretikes. ergo.
In whiche he woulde proue the verie name of Catholikes, to who~ soeuer it is giuen, to be a certain marke of right Catholikes, to be knowen as readely, easely, and certainely by that name, as such a citie is knowne by the name of London, and such a countrie by the name of England.
If euer he learned any logike at Oxforde, he left it behinde him, or else lost it by the way when hee ranne ouer the sea.
For if all thinges may bee knowen by the name whereby they are co~monly called, nothing beareth a false name, all Idoles are true gods and saintes, al deade carcales be liuing men.
Yea all heretikes which are commonly called Christians in respecte of Iewes Turkes, be true Christians.
But we must bring him a companie of men, commonly knowne by the name of Catholikes, which proued heretikes.
Forsooth the Arrians among themselues were commonly called bv the name of Catholikes and so reputed and taken, when the true Catholikes were called homousians and heretikes, yea all heretikes among the Pagans were co~monly knowen by the name of Christians, whiche thinke is as glorious a name as the name of Catholikes.
Yet Augustine (saith ee) maketh much of the name of Catholikes.
Last of all the verie name of the Catholike Church doeth holde me, which not without cause, amongest so many heresies, this Church alone hath so obteined, that whereas all heretikes would haue themselues to be called Catholikes, yet to a straunger which asketh where men meete at the Catholike Church, none of the heretikes dare shewe either their minster or house.
Augustine maketh this name, the last motiue, Bristowe the first.
Augustine ioyneth it with many thinges, Bristowe maketh it alone to be a sufficient motiue.
Augustine in the nexte sentence after confesseth the playne demonstration of the trueth, wheresoeuer it may be shewed, to bee preferred before al those motiues of Vniuersalitie, miracles, consente, succession and name of Catholikes, by which he saith that he might be helde in the Catholke Churche, although he grounded no argument vppon that wisedome, which the Maniches would not acknowledge to be in the catholike church, his words are these: Apud vos autem vbi nihil horum est quod me inuitet ac teneat, sola personat veritatiae pollicitatio que quidens sutam manifesta monstratur, vt in dubium venire non possit, praeponenda est omnibus illis rebus quibus in Catholica tenor.
Among you Maniches (saith he) where there is none of these thinges whiche might allure and hold me, the onely promisle of trueth doth sounde, whith trueth if it be shewed so manifeste that it ca~not come in doubt, it is to be preferred before al those things, by which am helde in the Catholike Church.
This is Augustines iudgement of such simple motiues, which with the trueth, may helpe to confirme it, but are not worth a straw when they are alledged against the truth.
Wherfore seing we make so plaine demonstration of the trueth out of Gods word, that no ma~ can doubt of it, but such as will followe the bare name of Catholike, contrarie to the Catholike doctrine of the scriptures: against all such vaine motiues, wee may be bolde to oppose the trueth it selfe.
What a mockerie is this that hee saith? that aneretike in Germanie, being asked where the Catholike Church is, will point to popish Church.
Admit this to be so, doth this proue the Massing Church to bee the Catholike Church? In France if you aske a Papist which is ye reformed Church? he will point you to the place where the congregation of true Christians vse to assemble.
Doth the Papist therfore acknowledge, the Church of protestantes to bee in deede the reformed Churche? hee doe not, the name of Catholikes proueth no more on the one syde, the~ the name of reformed Christians on the other side, that either is such in deede as of the vulgare and ignorant people they are called.
But why are Protestantes all hereikes desirous to be called Catholikes? but that they which in deede haue the name, are also in deede euermore true Catholikes, and so the name alone sufficient to moue any man.
Who euer heard such an asse baye? as though there were no difference, whether they haue the name rightfully or wrongfully, truely or falsely.
In all the Easte Church, who are called Catholikes, but the Grecians? Which for many hundreth yeares, haue bene separated from the Communion of the Latines, and of them are compted for heretikes and Schimatikes.
Tenenda est nobis Christiana &c. Wee muste holde the Christian religion, and the companie of that Church, which is Catholike and called Catholike, not onely of her owne but also of her enemies.
For will they nill they, the heretikes also and Schismatikes them selues, when they talke not with their own, but with strangers, they call the Catholike Church nothing but the Catholike Church.
For they can not else bee vnderstanded, excepte they discerne her by that name, by which shee is called of the whole world.
This therefore (quoth Bristow) is proued, they to be Catholikes that Catholikes are called When as Augustine saith, we must hold yt church which both is catholike, is so called.
Bristowe the Papist, is called by the name of a Cittie in England, theresore Bristowe the Papist is in deede a citie in England.
This therefore is proued, that to bee Bristow that Bristow is called.
But how proueth he, that they be called Catholikes? The worlde forsooth beareth them witnesse.
For beside some ignorant fellowe in Germanie, that calleth them so, or rather not meaning to brable in the streat. yealdeth to that tearme, not because hee thinketh them to bee so, but because he knoweth the Papist which asketh for the Catholike Church, seeketh not the Catholike Church in deed, but the Popish Church falsely called Catholike: beside say some tankarde bearer boye or gyrle, that hath mde such a unswere to Bristowe as he trauelled in Germanie, he asketh when in printed bookes they bee called Catholikes, whether the reader knoweth not who is meaned? Yes verily, if the bookes bee written by papistes such as take neither part.
But he would now further why we mke name the~, call them Cacolikes or Cartholikes.
suppose whosoeuer mocketh them, it is because they falsely surpe that name, which they are not wothie to beare, and not because they bee such, and the name euill: yet againe he asketh why Luther
beleeue the Christian Church, and not, beleeue the Catholike Church.
Mine answere is, beleeue that Bristowe belyeth Luther, for any such change of the creede, although he might well expou~d the true Catholike Church by the name of the true Christian Church.
But Iewel confirmeth the name of Catholike to be theirs, or els what meaneth he to entitle his replie, Against the Romane religion which of late hath ben accompted Catholike.
Alas poore Bristow, hast thou no better reason to proue the Popish Church to be Catholike, but that Iewel saith it hath bene accompted Catholike, and proueth that it hath ben falsely accompted so? Yes sir, not he only, but also Pope Humfrey in his Legend of sains Iewel, confesseth vs to be Catholikes, where he saith that Pontacus erred, when he wrot that onely lay men neither learned nor Catholikes, were moderators in the disputation at Westminster.
Why Bristow, are you not ashamed to take the name of the lorde your god the Pope in vaine? And because Pontacus complaineth that catholikes were not moderators, doth Humfrey therefore acknowledge papistes to be Catholikes? yea forsooth, he doth so, and also co~firmeth the storie of Pontacus, when he saith, Catholikes were present, but in the next worde he expoundeth what catholikes, namely papistes.
And som of the~ were also moderators, at the least wise one, namely D. Heath then occupying the place of the Bishop of Yorke, therefore not onely lay Lords, vnlearned heretiks, as this lewd losel and vnlearned dogbolt trayterous papist (I am bold with him, because he is so malepert with the learned godly nobilitie of England) most slaunderously and maliciously affirmeth were only moderators of that disputation, but some of ye Popish faction were not only present but presidents of that action, beside all the rest of the popish prelates, which then were of the Parliament, for information whereof that conference was appointed.
But Humfrey saith moreouer, that the chiefe cause of all euils, and as it were the Troian horse within the walles of the Church, hath beene hitherto a Catholike defection from the holy scripture, and especially your papistrie.
In deed you be catholike (that is to say vniuersal reuolters fro~ ye holy scriptures) if that title please you, reioyce of it spare not.
You be Catholike heretiks, that is, heretikes not in one or two articles of religion, but in all in as much as you denie the office of Christe vpon which is grounded all Christiaitie.
The name of Catholike of it selfe is indifferent to good and euil, euen as the name of vniuersall is: therefore in our Creede we say not simplie, beleeue the Catholike Church, but the holy Catholike Church.
And therefore Humfrey in calling you pseudocatholici, false Catholikes, sheweth what Catholikes he meaneth you to be, not members of the holy Catholike Church of godly Christiss, but pillers of the false and counterfeit Church of malignant herenkes, And whereas you say, you haue hearde Humfrey in his fond and vnlearned lectures at Oxford call them pseudocatholii, home Faustus the Maniche did entwite for honouring the memorie of Martyrs, first you take vpon you like the sowe to entwite Minerua as it is in ye latine prouerb, which might better be borne withall, in a man of such learning and arte as you shew, if you did not also slander belie him, as the diuell doth all the saintes of God.
For although neuer heard any of his lecturs: yet dare affirme, he neuer accompted Augustine and godly Catholiks of his time for false Catholikes, although hee coulde not allowe of all that Augustine hath written and mainteyned.
Wherefore it is cleare hee calleth not Augustine and the Catholikes of his time, but you Papistes of our time, false Catholikes: and shewed that to you did truly agree, that which Faustus did falsely charge ye true Catholikes with all, yt is, the turning of Idols into Martirs.
For Faustus did slander, not as you tra~slateit, onely entwite the true Catholikes for worshipping the Martirs, as pagans worshipped their Idols.
Calumniatnobis Faustus &c. Faustus doth slander vs (saith Augustine) Againe: Non ta~ me mouetut hic Calumniae respondeam &c.
He doth not so much moue me that should here answere his slander, as that might shew, yt Faustus him selfe through desire of slandering, would swarue euen from the vanities of Maniche.
The laste authorite for the name of Catholike in the
demaund is the words of a seruing man belike, that sayd to one M. Culpeper which died at Paris, lying on his deth bed, In any case renounce the Catholike faith, which whether it were said so, or howsoeuer it were ment, thinke the partie that so spake, had as much wisedome as Bristow sheweth wit, in alledging his saying for proofe of the name of Catholikes, to be rightly giuen to them.
The fantasticall trance of yt same gentleman which saw his good angel gloriously appearing to him, assuring him that hee was in the right way, which his gostly father could not do, although it were not forged, yet can make no preiudice against the vndoubted word of God, which condemneth that way of papistrie, for the broad waye that leadeth to destruction.
You haue heard what inuincible reasons Bristow imagineth yt he hath brought to proue the papistes to be right Catholikes.
And last of all because some learned men call the~ false Catholikes, counterfeit Catholikes, Catholike heretiks.
But as the Iudge of the conference that was betwene the true Catholiks the Donatistes said to the Donatistes, whe~ they challenged vnto the~ the name of Catholikes, so answere to the papistes, illos quano magis se esse Catholicos dicerent, tanto magis iam causa~ ipsam remotis nugarum interposuionibus agere debere, in qua probare possent se potius esse Catholicos, that the more they vant themselues to be Catholiks, yt more they ought all delayes being remoued, now to go to the cause it selfe, in which they might proue that they are Catholikes in deede, rather then we.
Name of Heretikes, that very name a certayne marke of very Heretikes.
If the very name of Heretikes were a certayne marke of Heretikes, the Christians in the Apostles time should bee verye Heretikes, for they were so called.
yea (sayth Bristow) of the blind and vnbeleuing Iewes, and so are we called by the blind and vnbeleeuing Papistes: so were all true Catholikes alwayes by al Heretikes, which is so strange to Bristow, that he would haue vs bring an Example of any Christians that euer called any people Heretikes, whiche prooued not Heretikes indeede.
You may see his reading is very great, whiche thinketh no exception may be brought out of any Historie, or writings of the Fathers, for this matter.
wyll sende him to that vnperfecte worke vpon S. Mathewes Gospell, written by an Arriane, yet among Papists commonly taken for Chrysostom, wherein the Author calleth and counteth the true Christians Heretikes, which defendeth the Godhead of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost to be equall, in Cap.
Consequenter aercticis dicitur hoc. consequently this is said to the Heretikes.
And least you should doubt whome he calleth Heretikes, it followeth immediately: Quando enim vides haereticos tres per omnia aequales dicentes eiusdem esse substantiae, eiusdem esse authoritatis, sine principio omnes hos aliqua parte distantes a se, non mireris: implent enim mensuram patrum suorum Gentilium, quoniam illi similiter multos deos colebant.
For when thou seest the Heretikes, saying, that there be three in al things equal of the same substance, and of the same authoritie, all these being without beginning, yet differing in some respect one from another, maruell not: for they fulfill the measure of theyr fathers the heathen men, for they did likewise worship many Gods.
By this one example in stead of many, it is cleere, that the Arrians did as commonly call the true Christians heretikes, as the true Christia~s called the~ so.
But if Bristow cauil, yt the Arrians were not Christians.
answere, they were as good Christians as the Papistes, who only almost cal vs heretiks, euen as we do likewise cal them.
And it were a shamelesse begging of the principle, to require that we shuld accompt Papists for true Christians, whe~ the question is whether they be heretiks or no.
But it is a fine quarel yt he piketh against our tra~slations of the Byble, where we cal Hereticum a man that is author of Sectes, as though we feared to call hym an Heretike, least men should thinke the Apostle spake against vs. Nay Bristow, thei yt so tra~slate, would haue Englishmen to vnderstand when S. Paule calleth an Heretike, that they mighte acknowledge the Pope to be an Archheretike, bycause he is an author of so many Sects, contrary to the word of God.
Neyther did ye Author of the Apollogie meane, that men should lesse auoide Heresies, accounted by S. Paul among ye works of the flesh.
where he alledged that S. Paules doctrine was called Heresie of the Iewes, Act.
or that they should not thinke ill of the~, which are adiudged Heretikes by true Christians, but that they should no more regard yt slanderous and malitious rayling of the Papistes, than the Apostles did of the Iews, who were not much worse tha~ the Papists, in some things were more tollerable.
Last of all, where Luther co~fesseth, that the members of the true Church were commonly called Heretikes, his conscience did not accuse him, yt his side were Heretiks, for he was able to put a difference betwene him that by heretiks is called an Heretike, and him yt is so in deede, although Bristow, eyther for his blockish wit can not, or for his spitefull malice will not conceyue it.
Name of Protestantes, Nicolaites, Papists, a name of late put on vs by Heretikes.
S. Hieroms motiue name, as of Protestantes, Homousians: Name of Franciscanes. &c. Whosoeuer in respect of ye doctrine which they professe (saith Bristow) haue a new name made of some ma~s name, or otherwise taken up, wherby they terme themselues, and are co~monly termed and knowen thereby, vndoubtedly are heretiques.
Therefore Lutherans, Caluinistes, Precisians, Puritanes, vnspotted brethren are heretiques, euen as the Nicolaitanes were.
For there are none of vs that terme our selues Lutheranes, Caluinistes, Precisianes, Puritanes, vnspotted brethren &c.
The name of Protestants, if any doe vse, is not in respect of the doctrine wee professe, but in respect of a protestation made against the decree of Spire in Germanie.
Neither is it otherwise acknowledged of vs, then the name of Nazatites, was of the Apostles, the names of Homousians, Caesarians, Caecilianists, was of the Christians in the time of the heresies of Arrius Macedonius, Eunomius, Donatus &c. Paule was accused by Tertullus Act.
to be a chiefe Capteine of the heresie of the Nazarites, whereunto he answered: This confesse, that according to that way which they call heresie, doe worship the God of my Fathers.
That heretique which did write the vnperfect worke vpon S. Matthewes Gospel, which goeth vnder the name of S. Chrysostome, in Cap.
Heresis Homoousianorum, no~ solùm Christi ecclsiae aduersatur, sed omnibus haeresibus non similiter sapientibus.
The heresie of the Homousians, is not only aduersarie to the Church of Christ, but also to all other heresies that bee not of their minde.
Here note, that the Arrians did giue a newe name to the true Christians, in respect of their doctrine wherof they were not ashamed.
For Homousians signifieth them, that acknowledged the Father and the Sonne to be of the same substance.
And ouer this note also: that the Arrian heretique did brag as much of the name of the Church then, as the Popish heretiques do nowe.
Ceterum Nicaenam fidem calumniantur, nósque Homousiastas probrosè vocant, propterea quod in ea fide fil um Dei vnigenitu~ cum Deo ac patre Homousion confitemur.
Moreouer, they slaunder the faith of the Nicen Counsel, and call vs reprochfully Homoousians, bycause that in that fayth we confesse the onely begotten sonne of God to be of the same substance with the Father.
But Bristow sayth, it is a rule that the ancient Fathers alwayes gaue the people to knowe Heretikes thereby if they had any such name.
If any where thou heare, the~ which are sayd to be of Christ, to be tearmed not of our Lorde Iesus Christe, but of some other, as Massionites, Valentinians, Montenses, Camputes, knowe thou, that they are not the Church of Christ, but the Sinagog of Antichrist.
But he belyeth Hierome, for he giueth not the name only as a sufficie~t note, but before the words by Bristow cited, he writeth, In illa esse ecclesia permanendum, quae ab apostolis fundata, vs{que} ad diem hanc durat.
We must tarie in that Church, which being founded by the Apostles, continueth vnto this day.
Ex hoc enim ipso quod postea constituti sunt, eos se esse iudicant, quos futuros apostolus praenunciauit.
For euen by this, that they are set afterward, they shewe themselues to be the same, whome the Apostle foreshewed to come.
By these wordes it is euident, that Hieronymes rule runneth not onely vppon the name, howsoeuer it beginneth, but of the late spring of Heretikes, whose doctrine being not founded by the Apostles hath a later beginning after them.
The names of Franciscanes, Dominicanes, Benedictines &c. whiche certayne sects of Papistes giue vnto themselues, Bristow sayth, they haue not for any speciall doctrine brought in by their Patrones, and therefore they be no names of Heretikes.
But reply, that beside that diuers of these ectes distent in poyntes of doctrine, as the Dominicanes and Franciscanes aboute Originall sine.
And to omitte the uelphes and Gibellines, dissenting about the authoritie of the Pope and the Emperour, the greatest question in Popery, euen those sectes of Benedictines, Augustines, Dominicanes &c. did al take their names, eyther of that man, or that order, whiche they held to be the perfection of Religion, consisting not in keeping the commaundementes of God, as Bristowe like a wyse man affirmeth, whiche all Christian men ought to endeuour, but in keeping the traditions and constitutions of men, standing in garments, in meates, in gesture, in ceremonies, outward obseruatio~s. wherfore they can not so lightly be acquitted of Heresie, euen by Hieronymies owne rule, and last of all by the example of the name of Rechabites, who had their name of their family, and not of any Sect in perfection.
The name of Papists (saith Bristow) is lately put vpo~ vs by heretiks, the like say we of the names of Lutheranes, &c. put vpon vs by them.
toucheth vs not, that Heretikes dare not denye their names by whiche they are called, for we vtterly denye all names by which we are called, in respect of our Religion, to be drawen from men, and aunswere onely to the name of Christians.
And as for the name of Catholikes, which Bristow maketh all one with the name of Christians, being added to the name of Christians to distinguish true Christians from Heretikes, which are counterfet Christians, we do embrace it: but if from this righte meaning of the name, it bee drawen to signifye a people, whiche by only glorying in that name, despise al true Christianitie grounded vppon the holy and diuine Scriptures, as Bristow seemeth to make it, then is it no better tha~ a name of Heretikes, and so the name of Catholikes, boasted of by them that refuse to be members of ye holy Catholike Church, turneth to their owne reproch, euen as the name of the Apostolikes was to them, whiche bragged of the name of the Apostles, but were indeed no true followers of ye Apostles, no more than the Papistes be true Catholikes.
In the eyght Demaund, he would know why we call them not Gregorians, or Leonians, of some one Pope, but Papists of the generall name of the Pope.
answer, bicause they mainteine not one heresie only of one ma~, but a general heresie and Apostasie from Christ, wherof the Pope is ye head, whom no more foolishly then falsly Bristowe saith to haue bene alwayes since the Apostles time.
If he presse vs, that we make not dangerous, to acknowledge the name of Protestants, confesse, yt when nothing is vnderstod by that name, but men which professe that true doctrine which we doe, we greatly striue not for the name.
S. Paul him selfe openly acknowledged yt he was a Phause, when nothing was vnderstood by the name but one that beleeued the resurrection of the dead, although yt terme of Pharisee was otherwise the name of a sect of heretiques, which mainteined many damnable errours, from which the Apostle was most free.
dici counteth all these three motiues of the name of Catholoques.
Heretiques, and Protestants, to be but dilatorie shifts of the Heretiques, not sound arguments of the Christian Catholiques.
Vbi cognitor cùm dixisset, hoc Catholii probare debebuat, ortus est iterù moratorius conflictus, de Catholico nomine Donatistarum Caecilianistaris.
When the Iudge or Commissioner had said: This the Catholiques ought to proue: there arose againe a dilatorie conflict about the name of Catholique, and of the Donatistes, and of the Caecilianistes.
The Donatistes which were heretiques, chalenged to them selues the name of Catholiques, as the Papistes do against vs, the true Christians they called Heretiques and Caecilianistes, as the Papistes call vs. Heretiques, Protestants.
Lutherans, &c. but these were but dilatorie deuises of Heretiques, to auoyd the true trial, which as the Catholikes in the forenamed conference confessed, was onely by ye Scriptures.
Protistants be Pelagians, in denying Baptisme to be necessarie for the saluation of Infants.
Whatsoeuer was heresie in times past (saith Bristow) is heresie now also, some opinions holden by the Protestants, were heresie in times past, Ergo, they be heresies now also, so Protestants be Heretiques, and no Christian, but almost Apostataes.
But deny that any opinion holden by vs, was euer Heresie.
Yes saith Bristow, the denying of prayer and oblation for the dead was accounted heresie in Arius, both by Epiphanius and Augustinus.
True it is, they both following the errour of their times, account it for an errour in Arius, but it doth not followe, that bicause they accounted it so, that it was so in deed, seing neither of them both doth proue it to be an errour by the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, but by the corrupt vsage of their Churches, which had turned thankesgiuing for the dead, into prayers and oblation for the dead And yet the same Epiphanius denyeth fasting and almes to bee profitable to the dead, wherefore the Papistes do now hold the contrarie.
Hee accounteth the hauing of the images of Christ and the Apostles, one of the heresies of the Gnostikes, Haer.
many such like things which the Papistes defend for Catholike.
The like doth Augustine, wherefore let Bristow aduise him selfe whether it be a good argument.
Epiphanius and Augustine accounted prayer for the dead to be an errour, Ergo, it was an heresie in deede.
For an other example of old heresies by vs recyted he bringeth in, That cruell heresie of theirs, against the necessitie of childrens baptisme, wherin they agree with the Pelagians, through which they suffer many thousand poore soules to perish, which can not helpe them selues, while they promise them both life euerlasting, and the kingdome of heauen without baptisme, whereas the Pelagians promised life euerlasting only.
Who would thinke, that this slaunderous heretique had liued so long in England as hee did before he became fugitiue, which lyeth so impude~tly without all colour or shewe of trueth? Was there euer any of vs heard to preach of baptisme, as not necessarie for infa~ts, if they might obteine it according to the institution of Christ.
But contrariwise, that it is a cruell errour of the Papists, which conde~neth infants, who being preuented by death, can not obteyne the outward Sacrament: yet hath this error Augustine and Cypriane to vpholde it.
But if Augustine and Cypriane neuer erred, no not about the doctrine of the Sacramentes, then let their authoritie defend the Papists.
But when Cypriane denyed the Baptisme of Heretikes to be any thing auayleable, how many thousand soules both of yong and olde dyd he condemne? And whe~ Augustine with Pope Innocent holdeth the communion to be as necessarie for the saluation of Infants as Baptisme: how many hu~dred thousand soules doth he condemne, or the Papistes destroy, which denye the communio~ vnto them? Cyprian lib.
where he accuseth the Pelagians, as well for affirming the Communion not to be necessarie for Infants, as for houlding, that Baptisme was not needefull for them.
Demaunde he chargeth vs with denying prescript fasting dayes, which is falle, when they be prescribed by the Churche of God, and not vsurped of superstition and opinion of merite.
He chargeth vs further with denying of Free Will, and quoteth in the margent August Tom.
where in deede Augustine against the Manichees affirmeth the Free Will of man, but in his retractations he sheweth, that euen then hee vnderstoode it of the state of Man before his fall, and therefore the Pelagians, whiche were maynteyners of Free Will to remayne in man since the fall of Adam, did slaunderouslie vsurp those his sayings against him and the truth, euen as the Papists do now.
Cùm autem de libera voluntate rectè faciendi loquimur, de illa scilicet in quae homo factus est loquimur.
Ecce tam longè antequam Pelagiana haeresis extitissesic disputanimus: velut iam contra illos disputaremus.
Whensoeuer we speake of the Free Will of man to do well, we speake of that Will, in whiche man was made.
Behold so long before the Pelagian heresie arose, we haue disputed eue~ so, as though we had disputed against them.
Now iudge whether if Papistes or we, be more like to the Pelagians.
He chargeth vs moreouer, to hold against the merite of single life, quoting Aug. haer.
with Iouiaian, which is false, for as Augustine vnderstandeth by merite worthines or excellency, we acknowledge that the state of virginitie is more excellent then of matrimony, in such respects as the Apostle preferreth it.
Last of all he chargeth vs, with holding against the vowe of single life, quoting Aug. Retract lib.
where there is no word of any vowe, and much lesse of vowing a single life, in them that can not liue an honest chast life without mariage.
There is mention of certaine sanctimoniales holy and deuout women, of whose chastity was no suspition, which leauing their purpose of virginitie, were perswaded by Iouinian to marie.
Not we therefore, haue reuiued any old heresie, but the Papists haue continued many old errors, reuiued many old heresies, of the Pharises, Pgians, Anthropomorphites, added many new of their owne, such as were neuer hed of in the primitiue Church, for six hundred yeares after Christ, as hath often bene shewed at large.
Miracles dogmatica, a marke of true doctrine for the sacrifice of the Masse, for purgatory.
Deuills expelled with a Masse by a Priest of S. Augustines, who was of our religion.
Masse sayd for the dead oftentimes to redemption both of body and soule.
The saerament of the altare sticked by the Iewes bleedeth.
An Englishe woman miraculously cured of late by the blessed sacrament.
VVhosoeuer haue at any time set them selues against, any doctrine confirmed by miracle, they haue bene against the truth.
There can to this no instans be giuen: our doctrine which they resist hath bene confirmed by miracles, therefore plaine it is that they are enemies of the truth.
Doe you heare this shameles beast, say, there can be no instans giuen against his proposition? When ye Lord himselfe giueth an expresse law, against a false prophet, which sheweth signes or miracles.
Did not Iannes and Iambres whch resisted moses, worke miracles: doth not our Sauiour Christ prophecy that many false christes and false prophets should arise and worke such great signes and miracles, as (if it were possible, the very elect should be deceiued.
Doth not S. Paule prophecy, that the comming of Antichrist shalbe according to the working of Satan, in all power and lying signes and miracles, and therefore no maruel if Bristow bragge, that he can fill whole volumes with them? But miracles are not the triall, but the confirmation of doctrine, which must be tried onely by the Scriptures of God: without the authoritie whereof, no miracles ought to moue vs to giue credit, and much lesse any miracles may moue vs to beleue any doctrine which is against it.
But yet let vs consider of such miracles as Bristow rehearseth.
First for the sacrifice of the Masse, and for purgatory.
writeth, that in a Ferme house of one Hesperius, was great hurt and trouble by euill spirits, which at the prayers of a certaine Priest or elder of Augustines Chutch, was staied ceased.
There is no word of deuills expelled with a Masse, or with the sacrifice of ye Masse.
That which in Bristowes eare soundeth that way, is Perre it vnus, &c.
One went thether, he offered there the sacrifice of the body of Christ, praying with all his power, that the same vexation might ceasse: But Augustine by offring the sacrifice of Christes body, meaneth nothing, but ministring of the communion, as that holy action was then figuratiuely called, but yet nether the Masse, nor the sacrifice thereof, was at that time inuented, as haue often plentifully shewed els where, and namely against Heskins lib. cap.
That he nameth the sacrifice of the body of Christ, it is not sufficient to proue him of Bristowes religion, greater cause haue we to chalenge him to be of our religion, when he calleth the sacrament the signe of the body of Christ, and sayth, that Christ will not giue vs that body which was borne of the virgine, and crucified &c. contra Adimant.
From Augustine he passeth to a tale reported in Bedes historie of a captiue, whose chaines were loosed at such time, as his brother which was a Monke and Priest sayd masse for him, by which reporte, Bede sayth, many were moued to pray, giue almes or offer the sacrifice of the holy oblation for the deliuerie of their frendes which were departed out of this world a sorie motiue without the autoritie of Gods word, which albeit it was credited of Bede, as diuerse other fables were, yet may we doubt of the truth of it, and although it were true that such a feate was wrought, yet it can not establish a doctrine contrarie to the holy Scriptures.
And notwithstanding that Bede liuing in a corrupttime, holdeth many errors of Papistrie, yet haue shewed against Stapletons sortresse, that he holdeth not all, not many of the chiefest.
After this miracle of Bede, he beginneth the storie of our countrye woman, which hauinge plaied the harlot in London, and running ouer into Flanders to seeke the knaue that got her with childe, was made lame with childbearing, so that one legge was shorter then an other by more then halfe a foote, sayth Bristow.
But after often shrift, and other holy exercises of Poperie, in time of a masse, she was restored to health by the sacrament of miracle.
doubt not but the masters of Bridewell (neere which place she dwelled sometime) which haue done as great cures as that, coulde haue healed her of her lamenes, without the sacrament of miracle.
In rehearsall of this doggetricke miracle, he interlaceth an other as monstruous a lye as this.
That the pixe being stollen by a Iew, the cakes sticked in despight among the Iewes, did bleede aboundantly, that a druncken woman a Iew borne, and christned, being admonished by an Angell in a vision, restored that pixe with three hostes in it to her gostly father, from whom they were translated to S. Gudulaes church in Bruxells, where they are kept vntill this day, from the yere of our Lord
The like fable they haue at the Monasterie of Billets in Paris, where they haue a cruse full of the miraculous blood, which issued out of the masse cake so sticked by the Iewes: which are euen as great miracles, as the blood of Hales was in England.
For if the Papists durst for their credit, co~mit those miraculous hostes and blood vnto indifferent vewe and custodie, where no fraude might be vsed, durst aduenture my life, (which is almost all that haue to leese) that within lesse then two yeares, they shall either be founde to consist of a counterfait matter that is perdurable, or els they shall putrefie and rotte which they woulde beare vs in hande, haue continued more then two hundreth yeares: In the demaund and in the next motiue m~tio~ is made of miracles wrought in Inda and by Pius quintus the Pope at Rome which either are lyes, or iuggling casts of counterfeating coseners.
But if they or their Pope haue any such power, as they bragge of, why come they not in the face of their aduersaes, challenge them, as Helias did the Priests of Baal, and in open sight of their enemies shewe their mightie miracles: and not prate of wonders done in the Indes, of which they may lye, where there is none to controlle them, or wrought, among them selues, where we can udge nothing of them, but counterfeating and cosening, with which practises they haue bene taken tied too often, to gaine any credit with any that haue any wisedom in them.
S. Barnarde of our religion with what miracles he confirmed images, churches, the reall presence, transubste atin, sacrifice of the masse, praying for the dead, praying to Saintes, and man other articles.
Miracles for by holy bread for the signe of the crosse.
Excommunication of Pius to be feared, who by his prayers signing of the crosse, did cast deuills out of fiue women.
Bristowes principle against which there can be no instance, is this.
VVhatsoeuer persons at any time since Christes ascention haue had the grace of miracles, they were the ministers of Christ, say not alwayes iust and holy: but alwayes preachers of his truth: and consequently, whosoeuer set themselues against such persons they were against Christ against the truth.
In the last chapter before, haue brought instance, both out of the Law and the Gospell, of salse Prophets and false Christes, which should worke great miracles, and yet preach against God Christ.
Bristow replieth, they are lying signes, such as were wrought by Iannes and Iambres, and shalbe wrought by Antichrist, not able to abide the triall, so say of all Popish miracles, either they are fayned, or ls they are counterfaited, or if any wonderous thing be done, it is according to the working of Satan as the Apostle teacheth vs.
So did Marcus the hereticke make straunge appearaunces in the sacrement of Christes blood, as witnesseth Iren. cus lib.
Tertullian affirmeth, the holy Ghost the comforter to be in the M~tanistes, by acknowledging of the promised graces lib de amma cap. de inferis.
Where also he maketh mention of prayer for the dead confirmed by a miracle among the Montanists.
Augustine speaketh of Paulus Donatus, that wrought miracles to confirme the heresie of the Donatistes. de vnitat. eccles.
reporteth that Eutychianus a Nouatian heretike, was notable in working of miracles.
Wherfore if the fables written of Frauncis, Dominike, Becket, &c. were true, yet are not they by such miracles proued true preachers.
In deede he maintained many of your opinions, yet not all nor the chiefest, for he beleued that a man might be saued sla fide by faith only Ep.
But he was an enemy to the Henricians which burned images, destroyed Churches and were against all such pointes of Poperie, as the title mentioneth: and these heretikes he ouercame, not only by preaching, but by miracles (sayth Bristow) as he testifieth himselfe Ep.
The truth (saith he) was made manifest non slum in sermone sed etiam in virtute: not only by preaching but also by working as doth Bristow translate, wheras he should say, not only by speech but also by power, so that of miracle there is no mentio~.
Yet Godfrie the Monke, that was his discisciple, writteth of miracles wrought by breade, sanctified with the signe of the crosse. &c: But Godfries writing we holde for no Gospell.
Neither know we the contrarie, but some Godfie Gods foe, which hued long after Bernarde, might fayne those bookes in the name of one of his disciples that liued in his time, for the number of miracles rehearsed in them, fine passe the number of the miracles recorded by the Euangelists of our Sauiour Christ.
And that you may know from what spirite those bookes proceeded, you shall vnderstand, that the same Godfrie lib.
Vicbatur sanè Scripturis tam liberè commode{que}, non tam sequi illas quam praecedere crederetur, ducere ipse quô vellet, auctorem earum ducem spiritum sequens.
He vsed in deede the Scriptures so freely and fitly that he might be thought not so much to follow them, as to go before them, to lead them whither he would, following the spirite, the autor of them as a guide.
Nam confessus est aliquando sibi meditanti velora~ti, sacram omnem velut subse positam expositan apparuisse Scripturam.
For he confessed sometimes while he studied or prayed, that all the holy Scripture appeared to him, as placed vnder him and expounded.
But Bernard him selfe as appeareth by his wrytings, abhorred from that blasphemous confession: Againe those epitaphes, which were written at his buriall, commende Bernard highly for his learning and vertue, but of miracles they speake not, which they would not haue omitted, if they had bene so many as this Godfrie writeth.
The excommunication of Pius quintus, we feare no more then we beleue his miracle, howe soeuer that pageant was deuised, which co~meth too late to perswade vs, that the Pope can worke miracles.
For it had bene more in season for Leo the or Clemens the seuenth, if they or any of these had receaued such power, to haue shewed it in generall councell, or assembly of the states against Luther and his followers, then now that Antichrist is in so great part consumed by the spirite of the Lords mouth, to thinke to establish his throne by lying signes and wonders which fewe of the Papistes doe in their consciences thinke to be other then counterfaited and forged.
S. Augustine was of our religion and brought thereto by God.
Beleuing the reall presens of Christ in the sacrament of the altare which is to be worshipped with religion, saying masse for the dead.
Prayer for the dead co~firmed by a vision seruing for our religion, prophecies for our religion.
The communion in a vision receaued by a blacke dogge.
Of visions we haue the same rule, that of miracles such as are of God srue to co~firme that doctrine which is deliuered in the holy Scriptures.
such were the visions shewed vnto the Apostles and holy men.
But if any vision seemed to bringe in any doctrine that was not coneyned in the Scriptures, both the vision was to be knowen for a deuilh illusion, and the dreamer of that vision commaunded to be slayne.
But how will Bristw proue, that S. Augustine was of his religion? euen by that wise argument, that he seth so often, because he held some one error common with them, although he were contrary to them in the whole substance of religion.
S. Augustine was of the same religion that his mothr Monica was, who saw in a vision that he should be conuerted to the Catholike faith when he was a Manichee: But Monica was of our religion, because he beleued the reall prefence, and worshipped so that blessed sarament with religion, and making of it God him selfe.
But how proueth he that she so beleued and worshipped? She knew sayth he that from the alar was minised dispensed victima sancta &c. that holy sacrifice wher by was stricken out that hand writing that was again vs. Au. lib. cont. ap.
She acknowledged the ministration of the sacrament to be a dispensation or communication of the sacrifice of Christs death, which euery Protestant doth, therefore she beleued the reall presence.
But how did she worship the sacrament, and make God him selfe of it? Mary (S. Augustine sayth) Ad vnm &c.
To the sacrame~s of whih our price, thy handmay de ved her soule with the bonde of faith.
What word is here of worshipping, or making the sacrament God him selfe? Yes sayth Bristow: for Augustine sayth in other places, we must tye our soules to God alone, whereof religion is so named, wherefore she tying her soule to the sactament, maketh the sacrament God him selfe.
substantiall reason promise you, by which you may as wel prou that she worshipped baptisme and made God him selfe ofit, for there is no doubt, but vnto baptisme (which is also the sacrament of our pryce) she tyed her soule with the bande of faith, and so hath euery faithfull Protestant.
For the sacraments by faith, are certaine pledges of our conunction with God through Christ.
Into whose death we are ingraffed by baptisme, as we are fedde with his body and blood in the supper.
The place of Augustine is corruptly cited by Bristow, who hath cut of both the head and the foote of it, which is this.
Ad vnum Deumtendentes, ei vni religantes anmas nostras, vnde religio dicta creditr, omni superstitione careamus.
Hauing respect to one God and tying our soules to him onely, whereof religion is thought to be called, let vs be voyde of all superstition.
For Monica had respect onely to God, when she tyed her soule by faith vnto the seale of Gods promises.
And she was voyde of superstition, when she cleaued to none other ceremonye of coniunction with God, but onely to that, which was ordeyned of God him selfe for that purpose.
But howe proueth Bristow, that prayer for the deade was vsed alway, or that Masse was sayd for the deade.
Because that in the corrupt tyme of Augustine, prayer was vsed for the deade, and in the prayers vsed at the celebration of the communion, remembraunce was made of the dead.
This is a strau~ge kind of reasoning: that was vsed sometime, therefore it was vsed alwayes.
But how long it was vsed, and how it was taken vp, haue shewed in myne aunswer to Allins booke of Purgatory.
will not deny but in many errors and superstitions Gregory agreeth with the Papistes, but yet not in all, nor in some of the chiefest.
The visions he rehearseth for prayer for ye dead, if they were not fayned dreames, they were illusio~s of ye deuil, because they serue to mainteine that doctrine, which is contrary to the Scriptures, which teach that after death followeth iudgement immediatly, so that no prayers can preuaile.
How so praye you? The conuersion of Augustine and the death of Cassius were foretold in vision.
If both those were grau~ted to be true visions, your religion were neuer the better, except the conuersion of the one, and the death of the other be your religion.
But admitting the dreame of Monica to be a true vision, howe proue you that the Chapeline of Cassius did not fayne his vision after his maister was dead? But the dreame of Iudas Machabaeus who sawe the Prophet Ieremy pray for the people, is recorded in the Canonical Scripture it selfe (sayth Bristow)
chap. which Scripture the Protestants reiect, because it maketh against them, as they would doe all the rest, but that they thinke they haue inue~ted shiftes good enough to blinde the worlde.
What reuerence we beare to the holy Scriptures of God, he him selfe, our owne conscience, and the whole world can testifie.
And the reiection of such bookes as were not written by the spirite of God, doth approue the same.
Beside the authoritie of the auncient Churche, both of the Iewes and Gentills which neuer receiued the same bookes into the canon, we haue often made manifest demonstration, that they proceeded not from the spirite of God.
Wherefore the Papistes making them of equall credit with the worde of God, incurre the curse of God, which is vnto all them that either adde or take away any thing from his holy word.
But the Papistes are not destitute of visions in these daies, for Bristow knoweth a Protestant who hath confessed that he saw in a dreame, the communion booke out of many handes cast into a fire, and yet the man co~tinueth a Protestant.
Verely he doth as a good Christian should doe, that not onely with no vaine dreames, but nether with visions of Angells from heauen he will be moued to condemne that doctrine which he knoweth assuredly to be agreable to the holy Scriptures.
But there was a Papist in London, which came to ye Church against his conscience, and sawe a fowle blacke dogge take the communion euer more, at the naughty ministers hands, as he offred it to the communicants, which stroke the Papist so at the hart, that he went home and dyed vpon it.
This deuilish illusion, or mela~cholike perswasion of a deuilish dogged Papist, thinketh Bristow able to condemne the holy ministration of the Lordes supper, warranted by
Scriptures according to Christes institution? As for the extaticall fantasticall dreame of maister Allington, tending (as remember) to mainteine Idolatrie, wise men regard as much as such fantasies deserue, after which, if we should shape our religion, we shoulde alter as often as any mans fonde humor or foolish conceit ministreth newe visions and straunge apparitions.
But mauell amonge so many visions, that Bristow omitteth, the famous vision of Elizeus Hall that came from Manchester to London, with a booke of his cold prophecyes, to co~uert the Queene the Realme to Papistrie.
Well (sayth Bristow) you scorne at our visions and dreames, yet was S. Cyprian of our religion: Because he defendeth some visions and dreames which were seene in his time, which were not to mainteyne any thing co~trary to the Scripture, but that which was agreable to the same.
And yet it is all the reason that you bringe.
But for our iudgement of miracles, of visions dreames to be motiues in controuersies of the Church, you shall heare Augustines sentence, De [undefined span alphabet] Ecclesiae cap.
Remois ergo omnibus talibs, Ecclsiam suam demonstrent, sipossunt, non in sermonibus rumoribus Asrorum, non in concilys Episcoporum suorum, non in literis quorumlibet d. sptatorum, non in signis prodigijs fallaibus, quia etiam contra ista verbo Domini praeparati cauti reddi sumus, sed in praesripio legis, in Prophetarum praedictis, in Psalmorum cantibus, in ipsius pastoris vocibus, in Euangelistaru' predicationibus laboribus, hoc est in omnibus canonics sanctorum librorum auctoritatibus.
Wherefore setting aside all such matters, let them shew forth the Church to be theirs, if they can, not in the speaches and rumors of Africanes, not in the councells of their Bishops, not in the writings of all maner of discoursers, not in deceyueable signes wonders, because that euen against those thinges, we are prepared and made warye by the worde of our Lorde: but in the prescript of the lawe, in the predictions of the Prophets, in the songes of the Psalmes, in the voyces of the sheepeherd him selfe, in the preachings and labors of the Euangelistes, that is to say in all the canonicall authorities of the holy bookes
And againe in the same chapter, sic stendat non dicat, verum est quia ego hoc dico, aut quia hoc dixit ille collegameus, aut illi collegaemei, aut illi Episcopi vel Clerici, vel Laici nostri, aut ide verum est quia illa illa mirabilia fecit Donatus, vel Pontius, aut quilibet alius, aut quia homines ad memorias mortuorum nostrorum orant exaudiuntur, aut quia illa illa ibi contingunt, aut quia ille frater nofler, aut illa soror nostra, tale visum vigilan vidit, veltale visum dormiens somniauit.
Remoueantur ista vel figmenta mendacium hominum, velportenta fallacium spirituum, aut enim non sunt vera, quae diuntr, aut sihaereticorum aliqua mira facta sunt, magis cauere debemus.
And let him so shew it, that he say not, it is true because say this, or because this sayd that companion of mine, or those companions of mine, or those our Bishops or Clerkes or laymen: or therefore it is true, because Donatus or Pontius or any other hath done these or those miracles, or because men pray at the memories of our martyrs are hearde, or because these are those things doe happen there, or because that our brother or that ou rsister sawe such a vision waking, or dreamed such a vision sleping.
Let these things be remoued which ether are the faynings of lying men, or els the wonders of deceyuing spirites, for either they are not true that are sayd to be, or if any miracles are done by heretikes, we ought the more to take heede of them.
And yet againe he writeth in the same booke and chapter.
Sed vtrumipsecclesiam teneant, non nisi diumarum sripturarum Canontcis libris ostcudant, quia nee nos propterea dicimus nobis credere oportere, quod in ecclesia Christi sumus, quia ipsam quam tenemus coniendauit Mileuitanus Optatus, vel Mediolanensis Ambrosius, vel alij innumerabiles nostrae co~munionis Episcopi, aut quia nostrorum collegarum concilijs ipsa predicata est, aut quia per totum orbem in locis sanctis quae frequentat nostra communio tanta mirabilia, vel exauditionum vel sanitatum fiunt, ita vt latentia per tot annos corpora martyrum (quod possunt multis interrogantes audire) Ambrosio fuerint reuelata, ad ipsa corpora Caecus multrum annorum, ciuitati Mediolanensi notissinus oculos lume~{que} receperit, aut quia ille So~nium vidit, ille spiritu assumptus audiuit, siue ne iniret in partem Donati, sue vt recederet parte Donati.
Quaecun{que} talia in Catholica fiunt, ideo sunt approba~da, quia in Catholica fiunt: non ideo ipsa manifestatur Catholica quia hae: in eafiunt.
Ipse Dominus Iesus cum resurrexisset mortuis, discipulorum oculis videndum manibus{que} tangendum corpus suum offerret: nequid tamen fallaciae se pati arbitrarentur, magis eos testimonijs Legis Prophetarum Psalmorum confirmandos esse idicauit ostendens, ca de se impleta, quae fuerant tanto ante praedicta.
Sic ecclesiam suam co~mendauit dicens praedicari in nomine suo poenitentiam remissionem peccatorum per omnes gentes, inciptentibus ab Hierusalem.
Hoc in Lege Prophetis Psalmis esse sriptum ipse testatus est, hoc eius ore commendatum tenemus.
But whether they holde the church or no, let them shew none otherwise, but by the Canonical books of the holy Scriptures: Because that neither we do say, that therefore men must beleue vs, that we are in the Church of Christ, because Optatus of Mileuitum or Ambrose of Millain, or innumerable other Bishops of our communion, haue commended this Church which we hold, or because it is commaunded in the councels of our fellow Bishops, or because that in the holy places which our comunion doth frequent throughout the worlde, so gteat miracles are done either of hearing mens prayers or of healings, so that the bodies of martyrs which haue bene hidden for so many yeres, (which which thing if they will aske they may heare of many) were reuealed vnto Ambrose, and that at the same bodies a man which had bene blind many yeres, very well knowen to the city of Millain, receiued his eyes sight: or because this man sawe a dreame, or that man being taken vp in spirite did heare, either that he shoulde not enter into the faction of Donatus, or that he should depart from Donatus side.
Whatsoeuer of such things are done in the Catholike church, they are therefore to be approued because they are done in the Catholike church, but the church is not therby proued Catholike, because such things are done in it.
Our lord Iesus himselfe, when he had risen from the dead, offred his body to be seene with the eyes, touched with the hands of his disciples, yet least they should think they suffered any illusion, he iudged that they were rather to be confirmed with the testimonies of the lawe the prophets, the Psalmes, shewing that those thinges were fulfilled of him, which were so long before prophecied.
So also he co~mended his church, saying, that repentance forgenenes of sinnes must be preached in his name throgh out all nations, beginning at Hierusalem.
This he him selfe testifieth to be writte~ in the lawe the prophetes, the psalmes, this we holde being commnded to it by his owne mouth.
These be profes of our cause, these be our foundations, these be our strong argumentes.
These thinges haue set downe more at large, out of Augustine, because they are not onely a stop vnto these motiues of miracles, visions, but in a manner to all the rest that followe.
Scriptures denied by the Protestantes, what scriptures they deny, praying for the dead confirmed by scripture, pray or of saintes for vs, fayth onely aganst the scripture.
Reall presence of Christ in the sacrament confirmed by scripture.
No scripture, is against the Catholikes but all is for them.
VVhosoeuer haue taught doctrine (saith Bristow) so plainly repugnant to the holy Scriptures, that for maintenaunce thereof they were faine to deny bookes of the holy Scriptures, or to say the Scriptures to haue bene falsified and corrupted, they were heretikes: and such are the Protestantes, therefore they are heretikes: Howe proue you the Protestants to be suche? Marie sayth Bristow first they deny the Canonicall most certayne Scripture of the Machabees, for none other cause, but that it is playne against their heresies, maynteyning prayer for the dead and prayer of Sainctes for vs.
This is a lowde lye, for we shewe many causes, why we reiect that prophane writing of Iasons abridger, beside the auctoritie of the Iewish church before Christ, and the primitiue church after Christ as haue declared against the seco~d booke of Allens defence cap.
But in defense of the booke of Machabees to be Canonical, Bristow wilsay as S. Augustine sayd to certeyne that denyed a testimony of the booke of wisedom de praedest.
They should not reiect the saying of the booke of wisedom which in the church of Christ hath deserued so long a rew of yeares to be recited in the steppe of the readers of the church of Christ and with worship of diuine auctoritie to be heard of all Christians from the Bishops to the lowest sorte of lay men &c.
Et Etiam temporibus &c. Euen the notable interpreters that were next to the Apostles times, when they brought forth that booke for witnes, beleued that they brought nothing but a diuine testimonie.
Touching this defense, first aske of Bristow, how he can proue that the booke of Machabees, hath had such continuaunce of credit? Secondly howe this saying of Augustine co~cerning the booke of wisedom, can be true when Hierome plainly reiecteth it, as not Canonicall praefat. in Prouerb.
Thirdly demaunde how Bristow can defend his maior, if we admitte this saying of Augustine to be true, for not Pelagius as Allen sayth expressely, nor any Pelagians as Bristow seemeth to meane, but such as defended the Catholike faith against Pelagius, reiected this saying of the booke of Wisedome, which booke also we refuse, although not for that saying and what one article of our doctrine doth that booke impugne? nay rather there is testimonies therein manifest agast Images, against Purgatory and merites, yet can not we therefore allow the writings of Phlo a ew since Christes time, for the canonicall Scripture of Salomon, whose title it sally beareth.
But to proceede, Luther denyeth the Epistic of S. Iames, because it is against his heresie of instfication by faith onely.
We allowe not Luther, neither did he allow him self therein, for he retracteth it afterward.
Yet is not Eusebius counted an heretike which vtterly reiecteth that Epistle.
But to goe on, Beza doth say, that S. Lukes Gospell is falsified, because it mainteyneth the reall presence of Christ in the sacramet, where he sayth, Hic est calix this is the chalice, which is shed for you.
This is an impudent slaunder, which haue aunswered against Sau~ders rocke of the church, in his ninthe marke of an Antichristia~, where it is handled at large, and thether referre the Reader.
To conclude, Bristow saith, no Scriptures is against the Catholikes but all for them, because they must obediently receiue and beleue all Scriptures canonicall.
But what obedience and beliefe they attribute to the canonicall Scriptures, it is plaine by this, that they dare not abide the triall by them, but flie from them to traditions as Bristow doth euen in the next motiue, as though the Scriptures inspired of God were not sufficient both to teache all truth, and to confute all errors.
In the demaund this motie is handled somewhat otherwise, for there we are examined, whether in the co~ference of Carthage Augustine and his fellowes did not proue by Scripture, that a visible Church should beginne at Hierusalem which shoulde continue visibly to the ende of the world.
aunswer, they proued sufficiently, that the preaching of the gospell beginning at Hierusalem, should gather the Church out of all partes of the world, and therefore the faction of Donatus, which begonne in Africa was not to be found but in a corner of Africa, could not be the Church of Christ.
But of a visible Church to continue visibly in manner as Bristow demaundeth, there was no controuersie in that conference, and therefore no proofe thereof brought out of the Scriptures.
S. Augustine, S. Chrysostome, S. Hierome, S. Cypriane. fasting daies, lent, masse for the dead prayer for the dead confirmed by the Apostles traditions, water mingling mith the wine in the chalice.
The true Church (sayth Bristow) hath alwayes had traditions beside the Scripture, and what company soeuer was faine to crye for only Scriptures, to deny most certeyne traditions of the Apostles, their doctrine was heresie and they heretikes.
To proue that the church had alwayes traditions beside Scripture, he bringeth in the sayings of S. Paule
before the Scripture was all written, when it was necessary for the Church to haue much of the doctrine deliuered onely by preaching, yet had they no doctrine of faith, but such as was co~firmed by scriptures of the olde testament, as is manifest
Pet. But for the certaintye of popishe traditions, what proofe hath he? First Basil de sp. sancto cap.
sayth Dogmata &c. Matters of doctrine which are kept and preached in the church, we haue partly by doctrine committed to writing, partly by tradition of the Apostles, which are of like force vnto godlines &c.
But the same Basil writeth contrary to him selfe and agreeable to the truth, [undefined span alphabet].
Whatsoeuer is beside the holy Scripture, in that it is not of faith, is sinne.
he requireth euen newe planted Christians to be instructed in the holy Scriptures, both for their full perswasio~ in godlines, also [undefined span alphabet]. that they be not acquainted with mens traditions.
Furthermore (sayth Bristow) Augustine, Epiphanius the Protestants them selues, condemne Heluidius for an heretike, for denying the perpetuall virginitie of Marye the mother of Christ, contrary to the Churches tradition.
Nay rather for troubling ye church with contention about that, in which he hath no grou~d out of the Scriptures.
Now let vs see how they are proued to be heretikes, that refuse traditions of the Apostles, are fayne to cry for onely Scriptures.
First that Maximinus the Arrian did so, ergo whosoeuer doth so is an heretike, according to Bristowes logike.
And yet he belyeth Maximinus, for he refused not traditions of the Apostles, but such wordes as were beside the Scripture, meaning Homousion such like termes, which were the~ newly vsed, but yet conteyned no newe doctrine, but euen that which alwayes was approued according to the Scriptures.
The same thing did the decree of the heretical Emperour Constantius forbid, not traditions of the Apostles, of which was no controuersie, betwene the true Christians the Arrians.
But that the Scriptures onely are of sufficient authoritie to confute heresies, Augustine declareth euen against the same Maximinus lib.
But now must not bring forth the councel of Nice, nor thou the cou~cel of Ariminum, to make any preiudice, but by the authoritie of Scriptures not being proper to ether, but co~mon witnesses to vs both, let matter contend with matter, cause with cause, reason with reason.
Likewise he and his fellow Bishops sayd vnto the Donatists in the conference of Carthage.
Si tantummodo id qu. crerctur qu vel rbi esset Ecclesia, nihil se acturos publicis gestis, sed scripturarum diuinarum tantummodo testimonijs.
If this onely were the question, which or where the Church were, that they woulde pleade nothing at all by publike actes of men, but only by the testimonies of the holy Scriptures.
Yet sayth Bristow, the Apostles were of our religion, because Chrysostom sayth Ad pop.
Antioch. that it was decreed by the Apostles, that in the dreadfull mysteries a reme~brance should be made of the dead.
How prayers for the dead came in how at le~gth sacrifice of the masse was applied vnto the dead, haue shewed sufficiently against Allen lib.
If we should admit all thinges to be ordeyned of the Apostles, which some of the olde writers doe ascribe to their traditions, wee should receiue many thinges that euen the Papistes them selues doe not obserue.
As that it is a wicked thing to fast on So~day, or to pray kneling, that oblations are to be made for mens birth dayes, &c. which with diuerse other superstitions Tertullian fathereth vpon the tradition of the Apostles, as wel as oblation for the dead.
De coron. nul. hearing therefore such manifest vntruths are fathered vpon the Apostles tradition by most au~cient writers, what certainty can we haue of their tradition, without their owne writing.
Againe S. Hierom saith it was a tradition of the Apostles, to fast daies in the yeare.
If this be true, then is the popish story false, that maketh Telesphorus Bishop of Rome author of that lenten fast.
Eusebius sheweth the great diuersitie of fasting before Easter li. cap.
saying that some fasted but day, some daies, some more, some howres of day night, this diuersitie proueth
Hierom vntruly ascribeth yt tradition to the Apostles, which should haue bene kept vniformely, if it had any institution of the Apostles.
Cyprian sayth it was our Lordes tradition, that the wine in the communion should be mingled wt water.
But the Scripture saith not so, S. Paule wc deliuered that wc he receiued of Christ, saith not so.
And yet Cypria~ co~te~deth principally for the vse of wine in the cup against the watry heretikes that vsed onely water.
It is a co~mon thinge with the auncient writers, to defend euery ceremony mhich was vsed in their time, by tradition of the Apostles.
But the chiefe matter is the masse, which sayth Bristow S. Paule one of our religion made.
maruell whether Bristow writeth this for fooles to beleue, or for wise men to laughe at.
When they them selues make Gregory or Scholasticus, or can not tell whom, auctor of the canon, and when they write howe euery peece was added by what Pope, what impudence is it to say, that S. Paule made the Masse, and to call Augustine to witnesse that which he good man, did neuer thinke of, and much lesse write.
Totum illum agendi ordinem, quem uniuersum per orbem seruat Ecclesia, ab ipso ordinatum esse.
That by him was ordeyned this order of doing, which through the whole world the Church doth keepe in doing of Masse.
The wordes of Augustine speaking of receiuing the communion, fasting, or before all other meates, are these, vpon the wordes of S. Paule.
Vnde intelligi datur, quia multum erat vt in epistola totum illum agendi ordinem insinuaret, quem universa per orbem seruat Ecclesia, ab ipso ordinatum esse, quod nulla morum diuersitate variatur.
Whereby it is giuen vs to be vnderstood because it was much, that in an epistle he should set forth that whole order of doing, which the whole Church throughout the world doth obserue, that this thinge was ordeyned by him, which is varied by no diuersitie of maners, vnderstanding the custome of receyuing the communion fasting, which he sayd before was generally obserued in all places.
But of ordeyning the masse there is no title You see now howe
Apostles especially S. Paule is of Bristowes religion, beside Chrysosto~, Hierom Cypia~.
Protestants in their owne conscience be against the Church which is euerlasting and visible.
Christ to be loued for the authoritie of his Church, for which there be playner prophecyes then for Christ him selfe.
Although we should graunt the Churches iudgeme~t to be alwaies infallible, yet would we neuer graunt the popish churches authoritye which falleth so manifestly from the word of God, thereby sheweth her self to be the malignant Church, Synagogue of Satan.
That the Church of Christ hath alwaies ben from ye beginning, shal continue vnto the end of the world, we all confesse and defende.
Wherefore it is an impudent slaunder of Bristow, to saye that by Iewell the Church dyed within six hundreth yeares after Christ.
And that the Donatistes and Luciferians are reuiued in Protestants.
For we nether say, that the Church is perished out of all places, except Africa, as the Donatistes, nor that it is become a stewes with the Luciferians.
But the Papistes are more like to the Donatistes, which say the Church is perished out of all partes of the world except Europe, and in steede of the Church they defende a stewes and sincke of all dolatrie, superstition vngodlines.
Therefore Augustine and Hierom be not of Bristowes religion, for condemning those heretikes to whome Bristow and his Papistes are more like then the Protestants.
Nether doe Protestants in their conscience thinke the Church of Christ to be against them, because Castalio an Anabaptist translateth Ecclesiae the Churche into reipublicae the common wealth, or because many vse the name of congregation, which is the true signification of this word Ecclesia, as no man will deny that is not past all shame.
That the Churche is euerlasting and visible to them that haue suche eyes as the Churche is, that is spirituall, we neuer deny.
But that it is visible to the world alwayes, that shall neuer be proued.
That no Scripture is against the Catholikes we graunt, but that many Scriptures are against the Papists, it hath bene more then a thousand times proued.
That the church geueth testimonie to Christ that the prophecies of the churches euerlasting continuance are plaine euident, It is no question betwene vs.
But that the synagoge of Romish Papists is the church of Christ, to who~ such credit or reuerence is to be geuen, that say, if Bristow woulde burst for anger, against the Protestantes, he shall neuer be able to proue.
Of the churches practise custome say, euen as of the churches iudgement, that how much soeuer it be to be esteemed, yet is not the Popish church the Catholike church of Christ but an apostasie schisme from it.
Neither is it sufficie~t for Bristow to say, ye Popish church practiseth many things that the au~cie~t church of Christ practised, therfore it is the true church of Christ, except he can proue, that the Popish churchteacheth practiseth all nothing els but that which the ancie~t church of Christ did teach practise.
In stede whereof Bristow can allege nothing, but certeine spots wrinkles of the elder church, which the Popish church doth embrace, hauing almost nothing els like vnto it.
But let vs see how substantially he proueth out of S. Paule S. Augustine, that the churches custome and practise is an infallible rule of truth.
after many reasons for the vncomelines of wome~s going bareheaded recoyleth to this inuincible forte.
But if any man seeme to be contentious: we haue no such custome (for women to pray vncouered) nor the church of God.
See how this impudent asse, to stablish his ground of custome, is not ashamed to falsifie the wordes of holy Scripture.
S. Paul saith, if any man seme to be desirous of contention, we haue no such custome, nor the churches of God, whereby he meaneth plainly, that it is not the custome of the Apostles, nor of the church of God, to be contentious about such small matters of external behauiour.
May we herof inferre, that whatsoeuer the church at any time hath vsed, is allowable, to be vsed alwaies? S. Aug. Ep.
Si quid tota per orbe~ frequentat ecclesia hoc quia it a aciendu~ sit disputare insole~tissimae insaniae est.
If ye whole church do vse any thing, only to call it in question whether that thing should be so don, is a poinct of most prowd or most stra~ge madnes.
But Augustine is not so generall, for his words are, siquid horu~, if any of these things, speaking of ceremonial obseruations, as of receiuing the co~munion fasting &c. be vniuersally vsed of all the church, when it is not co~trary to the word of God, it were madnes to striue about it.
For in the first place, Augustine setteth the auctority of Gods word, seco~dly the custome of the vniuersal church being not contrary to Gods word, last of all, the customs of particular churches, which are varied according to the diuersities of co~tries natio~s.
Now for these matters in co~trouersy betwene vs, answer, as Augustine doth to the questio~ of Ianuarius, immediatly after the words cited by Bristow.
Sed ne{que} hoc ne{que} illud est in eo quod tu queris.
But neither is this nor that, in the question that thou propoundest: that is neither the practise of the vniuersall church, nor the auctority of the Scriptures, serueth to decide this question but it is the third kind.
So say to Bristow, nether the auctority of the holy Scriptures, nor the practise of the vniuersall church, can be shewed for these things, which thou defe~dest, but they are of a third kind, that is contrary to the word of God and the practise of the most auncient Primitiue church But Augustine (sayth Bristow) proueth that infants are borne in sinne against the Pelagians, which are reuiued in Protesta~ts, by the customes practise of the church, which was to baptise the~ for remission of sinnes.
And this practise he called the waight of truth, a most plaine bignes of truth.
The slau~der, that Pelagia~s are aliue in Protesta~ts, by denying children to be borne in sinne, wil no more esteme, then the barking of a dogge against the moone.
But where he sayth, that Augustine by the only practise of the church, co~uinceth the Pelagians calling the practise po~dus veritatis &c: it is a shameles lye, for his words are in the same Epist.
Circunstiantur enim diinarum auctoritate lectionu~, antiquitus tradito retc~to firmo Ecclesiae ritu in baptismate paruulorum.
For they are compassed about, both by the auctoritie of the diuine readings, also by the stedfast practise of the church, deliuered of old reteined in the baptisme of infants.
But he vrgeth them with exorcisme and exsufflation, which were there vsed in the church: confesse, but their meaning by exufflatio~ exorcisme, he defendeth out of the Scriptures.
And who can blame Augustine, if after he haue mightely confuted the Pelagians out of the Scriptures, to shew the nouelty of their heresie, he alleaged the perpetuall practise of the church, which she alwaies had alwaies shall haue in praying for the conuersion of infidels, for the perseuera~ce of the faithful in goodnes.
This is all one (saith Bristow) as if we should reason against these heretikes out of priuate mens beades out of the publike prayers which are in the portuse or Breuiary, or in the missall and such like bokes.
The deuill it is, except Bristow can proue, that such beades and prayers, were euer vsed in the church.
For Augustine sayth de bono perseuer. ca. Atque vtinam tardi corde, infirmi qui non possunt, velnon dum possunt Scriptur as vel earum expositiones intelligere, sic audrient vel non audirent in hac quaestione disputationes nostras, vt magis intuer entur orationes suas, quas semper habuit habebit ecclesia ab exordijs suis, donec finiatur hoc seculum.
And would they that are dull of hart weake, which can not, or as yet can not, vnderstand the Scriptures or the expositions of them, would so heare or not heare our disputations in this question, that they would rather consider their owne prayers, which the church alwaies hath had shall haue, from her beginning vntil this world be ended.
You see plainly, that Augustine ioyneth to the auctority of the holy Scriptures, the perpetuall practise of the church which hath continued from the beginning and shall remayne vnto the ende.
Which seeing it can not be shewed for Poperie, the argument of the practise of the church serueth not for Popery.
Bristowe proceedeth and passeth ouer the example of Christian women, which killed them selues, rather then they would haue their bodies abused, yet notwithstanding by the churches iudgement were honored as martyrs To which aunswere, the church considered their minde which was good, not the fact which was euell.
At last he commeth to affirme that the Popish church neuer made any chau~ge of religion.
Which is a shamelesse assertion, although he say that none of his aduersaries is able to charge them with any alteration since Augustines time.
For to omitte the whole scope of doctrine, cleane peruerted, will obserue only the practise of the church in Augustines time, about the Lords supper.
In that time the lay people did receaue the communion in both kindes and one thousand yeres almost after, which of late the Papistes haue altered.
In Augustines time, the communion was geuen to infantes which the Papistes doe not obserue, therefore they can not bragge of perpetuall practise and deny all chaunge in religion made by them.
But Bristow not content with this vayne bragge, will go farther and shewe that whatsoeuer they haue vsed sithe S. Augustines time, was obserued euen so in all that time that passed betwene S. Paule and S. Augustine.
Is not this a master of impudence, to promise that which all the worlde of learned men doth know to be impossible to be performed, and whereof the promiser himselfe, can bring no profe at all but his bare worde.
For he beginneth with exorcisme and exsufflation, which as it was vsed in Augustines time vnnecessarily, so it appeareth by Cyprian, that was long before him, that it was vsed for the casting out of the deuill in them whose bodies he did sensibly possesse. lib.
Of the sacrifice of the Masse, worshipping of the Sacrament, and oblation for the deade, as Bristow referreth the reader to his fift and seuenth motiues so doe to mine aunsweres vnto the same.
Concerning the vse of the altare, howe truly he sayth, referre the reader to mine answere of D. Heskins lib.
The other fonde reason of the practise of the church, that children were taught to beleue the reall presence of Christ in the Sacrament, for which he citeth Aug. de Tim. lib.
which the poore man borowed out of Allens booke of Purgatory, is discussed answered in my confutation of the same treatise lib. cap.
Then followeth going on pilgrimage, to holy places, worshipping of reliques, prayer vnto Sainctes, vsed (as he sayth) in Augustines time.
For worshipping of reliques and praying to Sainctes, he citeth Aug de cre pro mor.
Who concludeth that to be buried at some memorie of the martyrs doth in this poynct only auayle the dead, that the affection of supplication commending him also to the patronage of the martyr may be encreased.
That this was no perpetuall practise of the church to desire the intercession of Sainctes, it is manifest by this, that Augustine him selfe dare affirme nothing certeinly, whether or how the Saincts may heare our prayers.
Affirming that this question passeth the power of his vnderstanding cap.
But by the name of memory, Bristow will vnderstande relique, because it is somtime so vsed, which is no strong argument.
But admitte it were so, how can he proue, either that practise to haue bene continued from S. Paule to S. Augustine or the same opinion of reliques to haue ben in Augustines time, which is mainteined in the Popish church? that there was superstitious peregrinatio~ vnto Ierusalem &c. vsed in S. Hieroms time, it is as true as that the same was reproued of him Ep. ad Paul.
If God shewed any miracles at the deade bodyes of the Martyrs, to confirme that religion for which they suffred against the Gentiles it foloweth not that the reliques of dead Saints are to be worshiped, kissed, saught vnto by pilgrimage &c, but most absurd is it, that Bristow would haue Hierome by ofte~ entering into the Cryptos or vaultes of churches at Rome, to signifie that he went a Pilgrimage.
Hierome was not so grose, to accounte walking about the Citie to be a Preregrination.
But what is so leaden or blockishe, which these doltish Papists will not auouch for the mainteinaunce of their trompery.
Last of all he chargeth the Protestantes, with an impudent attempt, in making such an vniuersall chaunge of the whole face of Religion, which none of the olde Heretikes did before the~.
That we are like to none of the olde Heretikes, we like our selues neuer the worse, but as concerning the vniuersall chaunge, it was necessary in reformation where there was an vniuersal Apostacie.
For any alteratio~ that we haue made, the Papistes dare not affirme for shame, that wee haue brought any thing into the Church which ought not to be vsed by the worde of God: neither are they able to proue that we haue omitted anything, which by the holy scripture is necessaryly required.
To co~clude, you see that the practise of the church, except it be perpetuall, euen from the first beginning, is no Motiue by Augustines iudgement, and that Bristowe though hee hath bragged much thereof, for some superstitions vsed of olde, yet he hath brought nothing, to proue that they haue beene from the beginning.
The communion of the Bishop of Rome to be kept of all Christians.
Such as are condemned by the Sea Apstolike are holden for Heretikes.
Emperours and other peeres of our Religion, as also their first conuersion.
VVhosoeuer (sayth Bristow) at any time were for their doing or teaching condemned by the definitiue sentence of the Sea Apostolike, and stubbernly condemned the same, they were Scismatikes or heretikes.
And contrariwise, all Catholike men haue kept them selues in the vnitie of that sea, and if for any cause they were out of it, labouring to be reconciled againe, or if they had beene but suspected, neuer ceasing vntill they had made their purgation.
Moreouer he saith, there can none example be alleadged to the contrary, but innumerable for it.
It is not denyed, but the Church and Sea of Rome, while it continued in true catholike Religion, was much reuerenced euery where, so farre at least as the Romane empire did extende.
But when any Bishop of that sea, went out of the way, either in scisme or herefie, they were not followed but resisted, condemned.
For Example, When Victor bishop of Rome like a proude scismatike, did take vpon him to excommunicate all the Churches of the East, for celebration of Easter, they did not onely contemne his censure, but many Bishops also did sharply rebuke him, as Irenaeus Bishop of Lyons: other.
Whe~ Liberius bishop of Rome relented vnto the Arrians, he was forsaken of the true Christians, and accounted an Heretike.
When Bonifacius, Zosimus and Celestinus, Bishops of Rome, would chalenge appellations out of Africa, contrary to the decrees out of the councels of Africa, by counterfaiting a Canon of the Nicene councell, they were resisted by all the Bishops of Africa, and the trechery discouered.
To these examples adde Pope Honorius, co~demned in the generall councell of Constantinople the sixt, for a Monothelite.
The Pelagians (which he saith, but sheweth not how) are aliue in Protestants, were condemned by the Apostolike Sea as witnesseth Augustine.
And this iudgement of the Catholike Church, the Emperour Honorius confirmed as testifieth Possidonius and Augustine.
What then? Ergo Saint Augustine and the Emperours were of our Religion.
If the Pelagians had beene condemned by the authoritie of the Byshoppe of Rome, without conuiction out of the holy Scriptures, the Example had beene to some purpose.
But when their heresie was bothe by Preaching, writing, disputing and Councell declared to be contrarie to the worde of God, then if the Byshoppe of Rome subscrybed to his condemnation, as one of the true Patriarches of the Church within the Romaine Empire, what doth this aduaunce the singularitie of his Sea? For examples of Catholickes purging them selues, Firste he nameth Chrysostome in his Epistle to Innocentius the sixt of Rome, but setteth downe none of his woordes, as in deede there is no such matter in that Epistle, onely he sheweth howe iniuriously hee was handled by the barbarous Souldiers.
His next example is: Theodoretus Byshoppe of Cyrus, who beeing vniustly deposed, appealed to Leo Byshoppe of Rome, which considering of his case indifferently, consented to his restitution in the councell of Chalcedon.
But that Theodoret would not haue accounted him selfe an Heretike or scismatike, although he had beene condemned by Leo, it is plaine by these words.
For expect your sentence, and if you commaund me to stand vnto that which hath beene iudged against me, will stande vnto, it neither will trouble any man heereafter about it, but will expect the iudgement of our God and Sauiour, which cannot be altered.
These wordes declare, that Theodoret although the Bishop of Rome also shoulde be deceyued to confirme his depriuation, by his sentence, yet he woulde not thinke him selfe to be an heretike, but quietly waight for the iudgement of God, which could not be deceyued, as the iudgement of man was.
That the Pope can not erre, that his iudgement is all one with the iudgement of God.
Although the mysterie of iniquitie in the Bishop of Romes prerogatiue, had by that tyme wrought very highe.
The submission of Hierome to Pope Damasus, you shall finde aunswered in my confutation of Saunders rocke cap.
where you shall see how the Church of Rome was called Catholike, while it was so in deede, and howe Antichristes side was against the Bishop of Rome, namely so longe as the Bishop of Rome was on Christes side.
Whether Protestantes in England haue decayed and Papistes increased, as Bristow braggeth, for these
Although want of seuere discipline hath caused many to remaine obstinate, and some perhaps that were of no religion, to fall to Popery, yet for the number, it is altogether false, that Bristow so confidently affirmeth.
VVhosoeuer hath bene condemned by any councell (sayth Bristow) generall or prouinciall confirmed by the sea Apostolike, They were heretikes, nether can there against this be brought any exception.
will bringe such exceptions, as Bristow for both his eares dare not affirme the parties so condemned, to be heretikes.
Liberius Bishop of Rome, was first a good Catholike, so farre that for refusing to satisfie the Emperour Constantius, which required him to subscribe to the vniust depriuation of Athanasius, he was caried into banishment, and one Felix a good Catholike also, yet by faction of the Arrians, was chosen Bishop of Rome in his place.
But afterward, Liberius sollicited and perswaded by one Fortunatianus as S. Hierome witnesseth in catal. and through wearines of his banishment as Marianus Scotus testifieth, subscribed to the heresie of Arrius, and returned to Rome like a Conquerour.
For whose returne and depriuation of Felix, Constantius gathered a councell, which was confirmed by Liberius, as testifieth Pope Damasus in his pontificall.
Constantius Augustus fecit concilium cum haereticis simul etiam cum Vrsacio Valente, eiecit Felicem de Episcopas qui erat Catholicus, reuocauit Liberium.
Constantius the Emperour held a councell with the heretikes and also with Vrsacius and Valens, and did cast out Felix which was a Catholike out of his bishoprike, and called backe Liberius.
nonas Augusti, cnsensit Constantio haeretico, non tamen rebaptizatus est, sed consensum praebuit.
Liberius after he entred into the citie of Rome the
of the nones of August, he consented to Constantius the heretike, but yet he was not rebaptized, but he gaue his consent.
Let Bristow aduise him selfe, which of the Popes he dare call heretike.
If he condemne Felix and iustifie Liberius, then hath he S. Hierome against him and Pope Damasus, which can not erre.
Another exception will bringe of Pope Honorius the first, condemned and accursed for an heretike by the generall councell of Constantinople the sixt, confirmed by Pope Leo the
and that not generally but by speciall wordes, pariter{que} anathematizamus noui erroris inuentores &c. nec non Honorium qui hanc apostolicam Ecclesiam non aposiolicae traditionis doctrina lustrauit, sed profana praedicatione immaculatam fidem subuertere conatus est.
And likewise we accurse the inuentors of the newe errour &c: and also Honorius which did not lighten this apostolike Church, with doctrine of Apostolike tradition but by profane preaching went about to ouerthrowe the vndefiled faith.
The same Pope Honorius is condemned in the second councell of Nice confirmed also by the Pope Adrian.
Notwithstanding all this, would Bristow were so hardy on his head, to graunt that Honorius was an heretike.
might ioyne to these, three Popes condemned by the councell of Constance, confirmed by Pope Iohn
also the condemnation of Pope Eugenius by the councell of Basil, confirmed by Pope Nicolas and Felix.
But the other are sufficient exceptions against Bristowes false principle.
Now whatsoeuer he prateth of auctority of councelles, is to no purpose.
For we acknowledge how necessary synods are for the church of Christ, with the Apostles, whom the fond ma~ boasteth to be of theyr religion, because they helde a councell.
Not considering howe they determined the controuersie, only by auctority of the holy Scriptures, as it is manifest Act.
And what councell soeuer followeth that rule, we gladly embrace, and that is the cause, why the parliament ioyneth, the foure first generall councells with the Scriptures, in triall of heresie, not that those councels are of equall auctority with the worde of God, but in that they agree with the same, in condemning the heresies of Arrius, Macedonius, Nestorius and Eutiches.
That proude scoffe of Parliament religion, bewraieth the stomake of a Vauntparler, not the spirit of a diuine or good subiect.
Popery was also confirmed by Parliament in Queene Maryes time, therefore it was Parliament Religion.
But where as he would compare the laste rablement of Trent, in all pointes with those ancient holy Councels, he doth euen as much as if he would goe about to proue an Ape to be a man.
But may not omit that in shewing the necessitie of the Popes confirmation of Councels, out of Annianus Marcellus, Lib.
Hee helpeth the matter with falsifying the writer, sor he deliuereth his wordes thus, auctoritate qua potires aterne
Episcopi, with the authoritie in which the Bishops of the eternall city are better whereas the word is poiuntur, by that authoritie which the Bishops of Rome haue or doe enioy.
Liberius Bishop of Rome, was of the same mind in condemnation of Athanasius, that the rest of the Bishops were, which proceeded against him, but that he thought it not reason, to subscribe to his condemnation before he had seene and heard him.
Hunc per subsriptionem abiicere sede sacerdtali, para sentiens ceteris iubente principe, Liberius monitus perseucranter renitebatur, nec visum hominem nec auditum damnare nefas vltimum sepe exclamans, apertè silicet recalcitrans imperatoris arbitrio.
Id enim ille Athanasio scmper infesius, liet siret impletum, tamen auctoritate qa potiuntur aeterne vrbis Episcopi firmari dsiderio nitebatr ardente.
This man (speaking of Athanasius condemned before by a Synode of Bishops) Liberius being of the same opinion with the rest, warned by the Princes commaundement, did stiffly refuse by subscription to cast out of his priestly seate, crying out often tymes, that it was extreme wickednes, to condemne a man being nether heard nor seene, so openly kicking against the Emperours pleasure.
Who although he which being alwayes an enemy to Athanasius, knew that it was already fulfilled, yet he labored with earnest desire, to haue it confirmed by the authoritie which the Bishops of the eternall citie haue.
There can nothing els be gathered of this, but that Constantius, knowing Athanasius to be depriued by a councell of Bishops of the East, would haue Liberius Bishop of Rome, to consent to his condemnation, because Athanasius was one of the foure Patriarchs, was not to be conde~ned, but by the rest of the Patriarches.
Not that it was then thought, that all councels were insufficient, except they had the Popes confirmation, as Bristow doth dreame.
But Bristow sayth, the Protestants regarde no councells, because they suffer Lewys Euans in a naughtye booke to cal the councel of Chalcedon a blasphemous, proude, sacrilegious Antichristian Councell.
This Lewys Euans while he was a Papist, and did write from Louayne in defence of Papistrye, was accompted of you a learned man, a sober man, a godly man, but now that God in great mercye, hath opened his eyes to see and acknowledge the light of the Gospell, you rayle on him and slaunder him at your pleasure.
For if you had bene able to iustifie your reproche, you woulde haue noted in which of his bookes, seeinge he hath written many, and in what leafe and lyne he had written so vnreuerently of that Councell.
Howsoeuer it be, he is able to aunswer you him selfe: Although if he haue erred in the name or iudgement of that councell, it were small reason to charge all the Protestantes in England, with one priuate mans error.
The last is, that Councells were S. Augustines motiue, because he writeth, that euen prouinciall Councells, must giue place without all doubt to generall Councells.
but what writeth Augustine immediatly after? Ipsáque plenaria saepe priora posterioribus emendari cum aliquo experimento rerum aperitur quod clasum erat, cognoscitur quod latebat sine vllo trpo sacrilegae superbiae, sine inflata ceruice arrogantiae, sne vlla contentione liutdae inuidiae, cum sancta humilitate, cum pace Catholica, cum charitate Christiana.
That euen generall Councells are often tymes, the former corrected by the later, when by any tryall of thinges, that is opened which before was shutte, and that is knowen which before was hidde, without any swellinge of sacrilegious pride, without any swellinge stubbernes of arrogance, without any contention of spightfull enuye, with holye humilitie, with Catholike peace, with christian charitie.
What saye you Sainct Augustine? haue generall Councells often erred, that the former were corrected by the later? If you mayntayne this saying, you shall be no longer of Bristowes religion.
L. Humfries opinion of Iewells chalenge of the fathers, and of the Sainctes in the Calender.
Bristow woulde haue it considered whether euer any Catholike man in matters of fayth, did obstinately refuse to beleue the olde fathers consenting in one and agreeing together, but onely such as were heretikes.
For in this first demaunde, he seemeth to vnderstand all the olde fathers consenting together, but in the rest of the chapter he playnely speaketh, but of some of the olde writers: nowe there is great difference betwene all and some.
For we denye nothing that all the olde fathers did consent vpon, although we denye some thing that some of the olde fathers did allowe.
For example, we denye prayers for the deade, which some of the olde writers did allowe.
But if Bristow woulde breake his heade in peeces with studye, he shall neuer be able to proue, that all the olde writers did mayntayne prayer for the deade, the like saye of prayer vnto Sainctes, and of some prerogatiue of the Bishop of Rome ouer other Bishops, of some ceremonies &c: which being the dregges of a great quantitie of good liquor contayned in the vessells of diuerse of the olde writers, and yet of the later sorte of them, the Papistes haue onely sucked out, letting all the good liquor to runne beside them.
And like impudent dogges yolpe barke against vs, that the fathers are all of their side, and contrarye to vs: with as good reason, as one that hath gotten the excrementes of a man, shoulde boast boast that he hath the same man in possession.
thinke the reader can not but laughe, when he readeth it so often noted by Bristow.
When of all olde heresies we are further from none, nor Papistes nearer to any, then to the heresie of the Pelagians.
But why troe ye are Pelagians aliue in Protestants? Because Augustine writing against Iulian the Pelagian lib.
holde that they holde, teache that they teach, preach that they preach, and lib.
quos oporct &c. Christian people ought to prefere the auncient holy truth, before your profane nouelties and chose rather to sticke to them then to you.
And are Pelagians aliue in Protestants, because Augustine reciueth the olde writers, that were agreeable to the scriptures? Did not the Pelagians alledge the authority of the old writers also? Lb cont.
But what should contend about that, which is so cleare in Augustine.
Quis autem nesciat anctam scripturam canonicam tam rt. ris quam noui testa, ertis sis terminis contineri? cam{que} omnibus postericribus Episcoprum literis it a praeponi, vt de ill a omnino dubitari d. epari non psst, vtrum verum vel vtrum rectu~s quiqu in ea sriptum esse constiterit: Ep sporum autem literas que post confimatum cannem vel scripte sunt vel sriuntur, per sermnem forte sapientiorem cuiuslibet in care periti rs, per aliorun Episporum grauiorem auctoritatem doctorum{que} prudentiam, per conilia liere reprehndi si quid in is forte veritate deuiatum est, isa concilia &c. Who knoweth not, that the holy canonical scripture both of the old and new testament, is conteyned in their certeine bands: and that the same is so preferred before all later writings of Bishops, that of it there can be no doubt or question at all, whether that be true or right, whatsoeuer is knowen to be written therein.
But as for the writings of Bishops, which since the canon is confirmed haue bene written, or nowe in writing, that by some speach perhaps more wise of any man that is more skillfull in that matter, and by the more graue authoritie of other Bishops, and wisedom of them that are better learned, and by councells they may be reprehended, if any thinge perhaps in them is gone a straye from the truth, and that eun those councells which are helde in euery region and prouince, without all controuersie doe giue place to the authoritie of generall councels which are made out of all the Christian worlde, and that euen the generall councells are often tymes corrected the former by the later &c. as in the
By which saying you may playnly see, howe the olde fathers were S. Augustines motiue, euen none otherwise, then they are our retentiue, to staye vs in Christian truthe, which they write agreeable to the holye Scriptures, and therefore it is an impudent slaunder of Bristowe bothe where he saythe, that in our preachinge and writinge we thinke it not necessary to alledge the tstimonies of te olde fathers, and also that in familiar talke amonge our selues we are not afearde plainely to confesse, that the fathers all were Papistes.
As vayne a cauill it is, that the Protestantes are ashamed of their fathers: When we acknowledge no fathers, vnto whose iudgement we will stande absolutely in all controuersies, but the Prophetes and the Apostles and God him selfe, by whose spirite they did write.
As for Simon Magus, Eunomus, and suche olde heretikes we detest, more then the Papistes doe.
But AErius, Vigilantius, and Iouinian were playnely of our opinion, and of them we are ashamed.
And doe you Papistes beleeue nothinge common with AErius, Vigilantius, Iouinian? Doe you in no poynte holde that which Arius, Macedonius, Eutyches did holde? Doe you mayntayne no opinion which was taught by Mahomet him selfe? you will aunswer, that there neuer was heresie, but it hlde and taught many articles of truthe, which if you holde as they did, you are not therefore their children, in suche articles wherin they were heretikes.
Euen so we aunswere you of AErius, Vigilantius, Iouinian, we are not ashamed to beleue any truth which they helde, their errours we leaue vnto them selues.
But know you will replye, that among the errours of AErius, the denyall of prayers to profit the deade was one accompted by Epiphanius and Augustine.
Then it is your parte to shewe, what argumentes out of the holy Scripture they bring to proue this opinion to be an errour.
Otherwise their auctoritie alone, is not sufficient to make it a truth.
Vigigilantius is baighted only by Hierome, of other learned men in his time, he was counted a godly man, and a learned.
As for Iouinian, we take not his parte, if in all respects he made mariage equall with virginitie, which in some respect the Apostle preferreth.
But we must see of what religion and auctoritie, the fathers were.
First sayth Bristow you may perceaue by Iewells challenge, that for Purgatorie, prayer for the dead and to Saincts, merite of good workes &c. there is somthing conteined in the olde fathers which liued within
yeares after Christ, because he durst not make his challenge of these articles, but of the Masse, the Pope, the eucharistie &c.
But pray you Bristow, are not these greater matters among you, then the other? If therefore you be not able to proue your greatest mysteries of antiquitie, out of any one father for so many ages, what great matter is it, if you haue them fauourable in a fewe articles of lesse moment? But Bristow with wayght of reason will beare vs downe, that all the fathers are on their side wholly, and against vs in all poynctes of our controuersie.
And this is his reason: who are driuen to mayteyne the fathers credit and auctoritie, Papistes or Protestantes? Not Protestantes verily, but Papistes, ergo the fathers be all for Papistes and against Protestantes.
Dioscorus and Eutyches in the councell of Chalcedon boasted of the auctoritie of the holie fathers, and stoode much in defense of their creditte therefore the fathers were whollie on their side.
But let vs heare L. Humfreys opinion out of his booke of B. Iewells life, of Iewells challenge, of the fathers and of the Saincts in the calender.
Nay rather let vs heare Bristow yelping like a little curre agaynst so great a lyon.
First he snatcheth peeces of his sentences gnawne from the rest, and then squeleth out as though he had hearde some maruelous straunge soundes.
D. Humfrey sayth, Iewell gaue the Papistes too large a scope, when not content to haue beaten them downe with the auctoritie of the holy Scriptures, he made his challenge vpon the testimonie of the fathers, and that so many hundreth yeares after Christ.
And herein he was iniurious to him selfe, that refusing that meane by which he might more easely more straightly haue maynteyned his cause, after a maner he spoyled him selfe and the church.
Howe followeth his opinion of the fathers and of the Sainctes in the calender.
This thing (sayth D. Humfrey) he did not with his wil, but yet he did it not without a cause, that he might strike you through with the testimonie of your fathers, as it were with your owne sworde.
For it had beene manlie for a Christian man to say.
For it is the question of men possessed with deuills to say: What haue we to doe with thee Iesus thou sonne of Dauid? But it is an interrogation of the Saynctes.
What haue we to doe with our fathers with fleshe and bloode? You heare by these wordes, what a daungerous opinion he holdeth of the fathers and of the Saynctes in the calender, namelie that the fathers are no farther to be followed, then they followed the holie Scriptures, and that the Sainctes either liuing or deade, whether they be in the calender or no, deny their fathers as fleshe and bloode if they be in any respect an hinderance for them to obey the will of their father in heauen.
These are the perillous opinio~s, that Bristow brableth against falsifying his words by ommission depauing his meaning by false surmising.
But Bristow hath yet an other reason to proue the fathers to be in all poinctes of their side.
If in all poinctes (sayth he) they be not with the Protestants, then vndoubtedly in all poynctes they be with vs.
And what is the reason of this monstruous conclusion? There was neuer but one true religion.
As though none can be of true religion but such as erreth in nothing.
But who would spend incke and paper to confute such vaine reasonings.
Mracles for reliques and for necessitie of childrens baptisne. Confirming of children, the custome and practise of Gods church.
Al martyrs that euer suffred fot the testimony of true religion, since Abel, were numbred of one true church, euen of the same that we are.
But Bristow would binde vs to the Saincts in the calender, termed by L. Humfrey Sa~ctli, which terme yea a worse, might serue a number of the~.
Notwithstanding so many of those cale~ddred canonized Sainctes as be Saincts in heauen and not firebrands in hell, were of that church which is builded vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, Iesus Christ being the head corner stone.
And therefore it is a foolish request, that we should name any one of the~, which was of our faith.
But it is a pleasant pastime, to heare howe Bristow proueth S. Stephen to be of his religion.
It is manifest (sayth he) that he is of the religion of the rest of the martyrs, meaning Papistes, because it is proued, that he as well as they, had heard helped the~, which prayed to them, which worshipped their reliques, went a pilgrimage to their churches, he specially reuealing by vision, the place where his reliques were hidden with the reliques of S. Gamaliel, S. Nicodemus: vnto one Lucian, a Priest of erusalem, which wrote in Greeke the history of his inuention.
To this inuention, answere, that it is an inuention of the deuill, either by meanes of him that counterfaited the vision, or by sending a stronge illusion, so say generally of all such miracles and visions, as are alleaged, to proue any doctrine contrarie to the holy Scriptures.
As for the vanitie of this epistell of Lucian, it be wrayeth it selfe in that he maketh Gamaliel the Pharizee, so great a Sainct, who for any thing that we can read in the holy Scripture, was neuer a Christian.
of the Actes, appealeth to the knowledge of the Iewes, that he was brought vp in Iudaisme, vnder Gamaliel, which if after he had bene conuerted to Christianity it shoulde haue bene greatly suspected that S. Paule had bene noselled vp by him, and not conuerted by a vision from heauen, as his intent was to shew.
From this counterfait stuffe of Lucians epistell, he sendeth vs to the new founde sermons of Augustine, to whom he would get credit, by Augustines owne report, De ciuit.
but in vaine, for Augustine speaketh not of any such sermons, but only, when report of a miracle was brought vnto him, that he went vnto the church spake a few things of the matter.
And touching all such miracles as he reporteth of Stephen, his conclusion is this, God was glorified by them, and the faith for which Stephen died, was magnified.
But of worshipping of reliques, pilgrimage &c. there is no mention, and yet that chapter of miracles, as Ludouicus Viues doth confesse, is notably corrupted, as appeared to him, by ancient copies.
The conclusion was, Quid erat in cordibus exultantium nisi fides Christi, pro qua Stephani sanguis fusus est? What was in the hartes of them that reioysed, but the faith of Christ, for which the blood of Stephen was shed? The miracle which Bristow reporteth out of the
in noua editione to proue the necessitie of baptisme for infants the practise of the church for confirmation of children, praying to S. Stephen is an impude~t fiction, as appeareth manifestly by this, that he calleth a sucking babe Catechumenu, one that was instructed in Christian religion, which could not possibly be, before he was of yeares of capacity.
Secondly the infants ofChristian parents, in Augustins time, were baptised as sone as they were borne, taried not vntil they were Catechumeni, that is enstructed.
Thirdly the woman in this fable, praying to S. Stephen, perswadeth him to know the purpose of her hart, which the word of God affirmeth to be known only to God.
As impudent as the deuiser of that fable was, is Bristow, who citeth out of Augustine De nitat. eccles. cap.
a few words rent a sunder from the rest, co~cerning miracles, which the whole discourse, sheweth to be plainly against him, as you may read in this aunswere in the
After this followeth a comparison of Foxes martyrs, with the Popish martyrs, Videlicet the good Earle of Northumberlande, Storie, Feltons, Nortons, VVodhouse, Plomtree, and so many hundrethes of the Northerne men, all rebells and traytors, yet (saith he) approued by miracles vndoubted, but what miracles, he sheweth not.
To these he addeth Fisher, More, the Charterhouse monkes &c. whose cause being sufficiently discussed by M. Foxe, referre to the iudgeme~t of indifferent readers.
But this can not omit that the traiterous Papist, flau~dereth our state, not only for publike execution of open rebelles and errant traytors, but also with priuie murthering, by poysoning, whipping, and famishing.
From all suspition of which wicked practises, God be praised, the states that are professors of the Gopell, haue alwayes bene as free, as the Papists both by storie liuing testimonie may be proued giltie of the~.
And where hee specially chargeth that learned and reuerend Father M. Elmer now Byshop of London, with this deuilishe practise, notinge these woordes in the margent, Let Elmer remember his Tragedie of the Scottishfriere at Lincolne.
As knowe not what coulour he hath for so great and haynous a slau~der, so nothing doubt, but that the same is vtterly false and vntrue, as a thousand more slaunders and lyes, Wherein the Papists, as Children of the Father of lyes haue so great delight.
To conclude, seeing not the paine, but the cause maketh a martyr, whosoeuer haue suffred for treason and rebellion, may well be accounted Martirs of the Popisn Church, but the church of Christe condemneth such for enemies of Christes kingdome and inheritours of eternal destructi, except they repent and obtaine mercie for their horrible wickednes.
And seeing patient suffring is by Bristows owne confession, a gift of God, vnto all true Martirs, such as were manifestly voide of patience, can be no true Martirs, as were most of these rebels traitors, Story by name.
Who for all his glorious tale, in the time of his most deserued execution by quartering, was so impatie~t that he did not only rore and cry like a helhounde, but also strake the executioner doing his office, and resisted as long as strength did serue him, beeing kept downe by three or foure men, vntil he was deade.
demaund, he asketh vs whether we haue not read in Chrysostome, Augustine, others, that they vsed this argument to proue the diuinitie of Christ, that he hath aduanced his seruants to such honor, that they are prayed vnto, their graues honored of kings Emperors, that miracles are wrought by the reliqus of their Saints, answere we read so~e such thing, although not altogither as Bristow reporteth, nor to yt end.
But what if amo~g a great nu~ber of forcible aguments, they vsed also some such persuasions? shuld their reasoning be a preiudice to the truth of God reueled out of the Scriptures: whervnto if those holy man had had as great regarde as they wishe other men to haue in their writing, and not suffred them selues to be carried away with common plausible errors, they should easely haue espyed that they gayned not so much in resoning so against the Painims, as they gaue occasion of superstition among the Christians.
And to aunswere the xx. demaunde, we are content to bee tryed by that doctrine for which the auncient Martyrs Irenaeus, Cyprian, Laurens &c. suffred persecution and Martyrdom, which was for no pointe of Popery but true christianitie, yet wil we not be tryed by all poyntes of doctrine which they did holde, for that it is certaine, some of them had their errors which the Papists them selues doe not holde, as Irenaeus is charged by Eusebius. l. b.
Cyprian did openly in a councel, maintaine rebaptising of them which were baptised by Heretikes.
Againe wee resuse not the tryall of that docttine for which the Christians were persecuted by the Arrians in Africa, notwithstanding the terme of Missa vsed by Victor that writeth that Story, by which tearme in that time, not the popish Masse (which then was not made, either in matter or forme) but the celebration of the Communion and memory of the sacrifice of Christ, commonly called in deede, but vnproperly a sacrifice, yet will we not be tryed by all that they holde, for diuerse errors of prayer for the deade and to the dead, were then receiued, neithet will the Papistes be tryed by that Religion they helde in all pointes.
Then the Praiers were in the vulgar tounge, and all the people sunge Himnes togither, lib.
There is no reason therefore that the Papists shoulde call vs to such a tryall as they dare not abide them selues.
Luther corrupteth the Scripture to helpe his heresie of the breade to be Christes body.
The head of the church to be a Layman is against the Magdeburgenses and Caluine.
The prophecie fulfilled in the accorde of the Protestants and Puritants Parliament religion.
The discorde of our owne Doctors: Bristowe would haue to be a Motiue against vs.
As though it were not as great a motiue against them, whose Doctors dissent as much as ours.
To omit all other controuersies, when will they bee agreed whether the Pope bee aboue the Councell or the Councell aboue the Pope.
In which discention they haue not onely Doctor against Doctor, but also Councell against Councell, and Pope against Pope, and Cardinall against Cardinall, as Constance and Basill against Ferraria Florence.
Nicolaus Felix with thir Cardinals, against, Eugenius and and his Cardinals.
But now let vs see what discorde he findeth in our Doctors.
Luther condemneth the Protestants, Carstadians, Zwnglians Caluinistes in the cause of the Sacramet, The more was his immoderate heate and bitter zeale to be blamed, and their Christian modestie to be commended, which notwitstanding his ouermuch vehemency in maintayning his error, yet accepted hm alwayes as a brother.
The corruption of the Scripture wherwith he chargeth Luther, is a slaunder of his owne, for Luther altred no wordes of Scripture, but declared his vnderstanding of them, when he said, Take bread and eate his is my body.
And this is the only discorde that he can proue betweene the professors of the truth For it is a meere sophistry of the ambiguitie of the worde head of the Church, that maketh that shewe of contrarietie betweene the Magdeburgenses, Caluine, and vs, who in sence and meaning therof, doe perfectly agree as haue often shewed.
And Bristowe cannot altogether deny where he derideth the Parliament Religion, and inconstancie of Protestants for chaunging the title of head into gouernour, and then expounding the gouernment by iniunction.
Whereas in neither of bothe titles was any other meaning of the godly sorte in the time of King Henry, Kinge Edwarde or her Maiestie, then is contayned in that exposition.
In deede Stephen Gardiner (as Caluine reporteth) at Ratisbone, abused the title of supreme head, not more wickedly the~ absurdly to defend all Papistrie, which the~ was not abolished by king Henry.
And against that grosse errour of Gardiner writeth Caluine and not against our vnderstanding of that tytle.
But the Apologie prophecieth that shortely the Lutherans and Zwinglians should bee accorded, which is fulfilled in the accorde of the Protestantes and Puritanes, who in the demaunde he sayth doe abhorre the tytle of supremacie, If knewe whome he did meane by Puritanes, might aunsweare him the better, but seeing hee maketh Protestantes and Puritanes members of a diuision, If hee recken the Puritanes for such as bee no Protestantes, let them aunsweare for them selues.
If he calles them Puritanes which desire to haue the Church thorowly reformed, there is no such dissention betweene them, but that they all agree in the Articles of Faith, maintayne brotherly concorde one with an other, notwithstanding in diuersitie of opinions concerning the matters and manner of reformation.
But what an impudent attempte is chaunge of Religion, hee will shewe vs out of Luther, which writing againste the Anabaptistes Anno
affirmeth that much Christianitie, and true Christianitie is vnder the Popedome.
If chaunge of Religion bee so impudent an attempte, why were the Papistes finding Religion quietly establyshed by lawe, so impudent in Queene Maryes time, not only to attempte but also to bring to passe in deede an alteration of Religion.
But the Popish Religion was true Christianitie by Luthers confession.
aunswere, Luther did meane nothing lesse by that confession, then to defende any parte of Popery to bee Christianitie, but writinge against the Anabaptistes which woulde haue all thinges abolyshed which the Papistes vsed, he sheweth that such partes and Articles of Christianitie, which in generall confession and acknowledging of the authoritie of the Scriptures, the Papistes haue common with vs, are not therefore to bee reiected, because of them they haue bene abused.
Otherwise it is a poore Moiue vnto Popery, that Luther by these or any other woordes did euer minister vnto you.
S. Augustine the Apostle of Englishmen of what Religion and authoritie.
The Catholike Faith was purely planted in this Island by the Apostles euen in the raigne of Tiberius, as restineth Gildas, sixe hundreth yeeres before Augustine came from Rome, bringing in deede with him the principall groundes of Christianitie, and with all, much Monkish superstition.
But that the Religion of Papisrie differeth in as many pointes from that which Augustine planted, as Augustines doth from oures, haue prooued abundantly, in aunsweare to Stapletons Fortresse, and breefely in the Table of differences.
And in such poyntes wherein wee differ from Augustine, haue proued that Augustine differed from the Apostles.
As for his Miracles affirmed by the Saxons, and denied by the Briton writers, shall still remaine in controuersie for me.
As also his prophecie so tearmed by the Saxons, which the Britons affime to be a threatening of crueltie, which he himselfe procured to be executed on the poore Students ergie of Bangor.
In the demaunde, Bristow would knowe of vs whether the Britains by Eleutherius were co~uerted to one faith, and the Saxons by Gregory and Augustine vnto an other.
But haue shewed before that the Britanes were not co~uerted by Elutherius, although perhaps the Church, which was more then an hundreth yeares of age in his tyme, might by him of charitie be confirmed in truth, or admonished to beware of such heretikes as then troubled the Church abroade.
But deny that Eleutherius maynteyned all that superstition, which Augustine brought in.
Britons church in Augustines tyme, differed in more things then in the celebration of Easter, from the Romish Churche, as haue shewed in that confutation of Stapleton, euen by testimony of Bede him selfe: Although will not deny, but there might be some corruption euen amonge the Britayns also, as there were that maynteyned the heresie of the Pelagians.
Wherefore into that Catholike faith, which was first mightely planted in this lande by the Apostles of Christ, and not of Gregorie, through the most weightie argumentes taken of the auctority of the holy Scriptures, is this realme by the great mercie of God, returned, from the schime and heresie of Antichrist, so hope shall remaine, euen vntil the second comming of Christ.
We like Optatus Motiue well, for going out of the Church into any other faction.
But it may not be drawn contrarie to his meaning against those which goe out of Babilon into Ierusalem.
He saith, VVe must see who hath remained in the roote with the whole worlde.
Verely not the Papists, which are departed from the doctrine of the Apostles which is the roote of the Church, by them planted in all the worlde.
VVe must see who is gone foorth. which Bristow doth rightly referre to that saying of Saint Paule.
But who are those? They that teache the doctrine of deuilles, forbidding to marrye and commaunding to abstaine from meates.
Nowe whether Papists or protestants be such, let the worlde iudge.
Optatus will haue it farther considered, VVho is set in an other Chayre that was not before? Verely none so manifestly as the Pope, who sitteth in a Chayre, that none of the Apostles, nor Apostolike men, for many hundreth yeeres after Christe did knowe.
Againe, VVho hath sette an Aultar against the Aultar? who but the Papists, which haue erected the Sacrifice of the Masse, to ouerthrow the Aultar of the crosse of Christ? Finally, VVho hath made an ordination, the other before ordayned, beeing whole sounde.
VVho hath placed Bishops there, where others were placed before which are yet aliue.
As though it were a faulte, to putte out false Bishoppes, and to supply the roomes with true Bishoppes, where as Optatus meaneth of Heretikes, which are gone from true Byshoppes, and sette vppe Heretikes in schisme, the true Bishoppes still remayning as the Papistes did in Queene Maryes time, vntyll they had burned vppe almoste all.
As for the vnitie and constancy of the popishe deposed Prelates, which hee commendeth, is sufficiently knowne to the worlde, which although they were all saue one obstinate in the beginning of her Maiesties raygne, because they hoped by trayterous practises, foolish prophecies, deuilish coniuration, to see an alteration shortly, aswel for religion, as also for the whole state of the common wealth, and withall had experience of the mercifulnes and compassion of the Kinges of Israell, so that they were not in feare of their liues, or any great hazard of their goods, yet had they all or the most part of them (such was their good constancy) reuolted from popery, and sworne against the Pope, in the raygne of Kinge Henrye and King Edward.
As for the decaye of Protestants and professors of the truthe of Gods word, which the cold prophet foreseeth, by some trayterous deuise, whispered among his pewfellowes at Louayne or Dowaye, it shall haue such successe and euent by Gods grace, as hitherto the like treasonable practises haue obteyned, whiche alwayes, (Gods holy name be praysed therefore) hath turned to the confusion of Popery and the further spreading of the light of the Gospell.
In the demaunde, he vrgeth vs to shewe when the Romanes went out of the truth, frsaking any company of Christians then liuing.
This hath bene often shewed, that the Romanes though not all at once, yet by litle and litle, euen as the mysterie of iniquitie got strength, which began to worke in the Apostles tyme, haue departed from the communion of other Christians.
The first storye that maketh notable mention, is Euseb. lib.
of Victor which did cut him selfe from all the Churches of the East about a ceremonye, since which tyme, the Romane Bishops, by litle and litle, haue departed vntill they made a generall apostasie and defection, from the vniuersall Churche, condemning all the Christians in the world, except such as held of their particular schismaticall and hereticall Churche of Rome.
He spendeth muche labour in vayne, to proue that the first religion is the onely true religion, and that all sectes that arise after, are false, which we graunt most willingly with Irenaeus, Tertullian, and the Scripture it selfe.
But he hath not one worde to proue, that our religion is of a later springe, then the Apostles, and therefore like an asse, he flyeth to their common stable, saying that Luther liued but yesterdaye, as though Luther were the firste author of our religion.
Which if it be not as auncient as Christ and the Apostles, might easiely be confuted by the doctrine of Christ and the Apostles, contayned in the holye Scriptures.
Beginninge with wondringe and gaynesaying of Christians then in vnitye, vvhich is Saynte Irenaeus motiue.
Our religion of Christ reuealed in the fleshe, began with wondring and gaynesaying of Scribes, Pharisees, as it is manifest by the historye of the Gospell, Marke
yet was not the doctrine of Christ newe or straunge, but newely begonne to be restored, which was by them corrupted, so is the same now wondred at, and gaynesayde by their successors, the Papistes, but of true Christians it is nether wondred at, nor gaynesayde, contrariwise the heresie of Papistes, in manye poyntes was wondred at and gaynesayde by true Christians, whiche Bristowe saythe, we can not proue to be in anye one.
For example, will name one of the chiefest articles which they holde, namely, the Popes supremacye, vpon which all the rest in Eusebius testifyeth, that when Victor Bishoppe of Rome, which was the first that challe~ged any supremacie tooke vpon him to excommunicate the Churches and Bishops of Asia, about the celebration of Easter: His presumption was wondred at and gainesayde, not only by those Churches and their Bishops, but euen by others neere hand, as by Irenaeus Bishop of Lyons in Fraunce, which sharpely reproued him therfore, more the~ two hundreth yeeres after, when Zozimus other Romish Prelates made claime to a kind of supremacy, in resisting appeale out of Africa, and for that purpose, had counterfaited a decree of the Nicne councel: They were wondred at and gainesaid by the whole councell of Carthage.
The like might shewe, for worshipying of Images, the reall presence transubstatiation &c.
But where hee sayeth that all heresies were wondered at and gainesaide, immediatly after they arose, it cannot be proued.
Nor that all was Heresie that was gainesaide by them that were in vnitie.
For the baptisme of Heretikes was gainesaide by Saincte Cyprian and all the Bishoppes of Africa, yet was it none heresie, that Infants might be sauedwith out receiuing of the communion, was gainesaid by Innocentius Bishop of Rome, and by S. Augustine and by all the church, that was at vnitie against the Pelagians.
Yet was not that opinion then helde by the Pelagians otherwise horrible Heretikes and heresie, but that which the Bishop of Roms the rest of the known visible church did holde, was an eror whereby you may see, how truely the commaundement of Christe vnto Peter, to confirme his Brethren after his conuersion doth giue the Byshop of Rome' power neuer to be deceiued. nor to fall into error.
And that the Church may be the piller and stay of trueth, although the chiefe members thereof, and generally all that are knowen to be members thereof may be taken in some particular error.
Protestants allowe better of our orders the~ of their owne.
Wheras Bristowe chargeth vs to be vnsent, it is nothing else, but a popish slaunder and petition of principle, for we are called and sent ordinarily by the Church and elders of the same, to preach the word of God and to minister the Sacraments.
Neither are we ordayned by a lay Prince, as he like a lewde Papist doth slaunder both our Christian Prince and vs.
And although the Prince by letters Patents hath sent some to preach and visite the Churches of her dominions, yet shee hath doone it by authoritie of the worde of God and by example of godly Princes, Iosaphat and other
not taking vpon het to execute any ecclesiasticall function, but according to her kingly authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall.
And where Bristowe saith we allowe better of their popish orders, then of our owne, secking as much as we can possible, to be consecrated by one of their orders, except it be some such proude hypocrite as Bristowe is, that so iudgeth and seeketh, it is a moste abhominable lye.
For withall our heart, wee abhorre, defie, detest and spit at your stinking greasie antichristian orders.
Neither doth our Church receiue any of your execrable, ordering to minister in the Church before they haue solemnly by othe renounced your Antichriste, and publikely as well professed to imbrace all true religion, as Protested that in their conscienses they defy all papistry and other heresies.
Although many godly men wishe, yet a more seuere discipline in examining and receiuing such as come our of your heresie, to serue in the Church of God.
The communion of the B. of Rome, to be kept of all Christians.
That the Church is euerlasting, Bristow neede not haue take~ such paynes to proue, that this continuance is preserued by succession, is also to be confessed.
But yt this succession is visible, limited to any one sea of bishops, it is false.
For euen as he him selfe sayth it is necessary that all Adams children to be come of Adam by a continuall pedegree of fathers and grandfathers and other progenitors, euen vntill his time, and yet no one of Adams childre~ can deduce this pedegree by naming of all his progenitors from Adam vnto his time so there is no doubt, but the Church hath had a perpetuall succession in the world, from ye beginning thereof, vntil this day, although she can not name a particular succession of persons in any one place, for all ages that are past.
But euen as by the Scriptures we are taught, that Adam is our naturall father, although we can not name all our au~cestors that haue bene betwene vs and him: right so by the Scriptures we are taught, that the Church is our heauenly mother, although we can not frame such tables of succession as the Papistes require vs to shew, which they can not performe them selues.
For although they can name a number of Bishops, whereof some haue taught at Rome, some haue sitten and slept in their chayer at Rome, and some at Auynion, some haue played the deuill therein, an hundreth of the last being no more like to a score of the firste in doctrine and life, then God, whose children the first were, is like the deuill whose derlings the last were: yet what is this to shewe a succession of their Church.
And howe doth this proue them to be the true Churche: can not the Churche of Constantinople and other Churches in Greece, doe the like vnto this daye? Yet doe the Papistes count all them for heretikes and scismatikes.
Whatsoeuer therefore Optatus, Hierom, Augustine, Tertullian, or any other haue written of succession of Bishops in the Apostolike sees, they meane so large and so farre forth as they continue in succession of Apostolike doctrine.
Otherwise woulde not Hierom haue embraced Arrianisme, because it was receyued by Liberius who sate in the Apostolike see of Rome, and coulde name his predecessors from Peter.
Nor Optatus haue receyued Eutychianisme, because it was defended by Dioscorus, which satte in the Euangelisticall see of Alexandria, and coulde name his predecessors from S. Marke the disciple of S. Peter.
Nether woulde Augustine haue consented to Arrianisme, because it was mayntayned by Eulalius and Euzoius, Bishops of the Apostolike see of Antioche, althoughe they were able to shewe their succession by many Bishops, euen vnto S. Peter him selfe, who planted his chayer at Antioche, by all Papistes confession seuen yeares before he came to Rome.
You see therefore howe farre the motiue of succession may drawe or driue any man to haue regard vnto it, euen as long, as there is succession of doctrine, as well as of place and person, and not longer, nor further.
The Communion of the Bishop of Rome to be kept of all Christians.
Succession of the Bishops of Rome, the motiue of Optatus, S. Augustine and S. Irenaeus.
This motiue in effect, is all one with the former, and in a maner so confessed by Bristow him selfe.
But thus he takth his principle of their singing in the Masse, our saying in the communion, of the creede, in which we confesse that we beleue one onely Catholike and Apostolike Church.
This one Catholike Church sayth Bristow is our Church that is Apostolike, because it agreeth with the faith of the Church of Rome, which is the sea of an Apostle, holding on to this day by succession, and to which was written an Epistle by an Apostle.
aunswer, it is not the popish Romane Church, because that Church is departed from the vniuersal Church of Christ, planted by the Apostles through out the worlde, and holdeth not on in succession of the doctrine of the Apostle, which did write that epistle to the Romanes.
It is a great doubt, whether he euer came at Rome, and it is out of doubt by the Scriptures, that he taried not there so longe as the histories affirme, and last it is false that he was a Bishop of a particular Church, which was an Apostle ouer all the world, and specially ouer the circumcision.
And that citye by the Scripture is the seat of Antichrist and the whore of Babylon.
and euen that epistle will proue the Church of Rome at this day, to be not apostolicall but apostatical, as in many articles, so in the article of iustification.
Are not those causes why a Church is called Apostolike, sayth Bristow? No verily but onely because it holdeth and mayntayneth the Apostolike doctrine, which if it doe in all necessary articles, then is it Apostolike, hath succession and plantation of the Apostles, or els not, although it be gathered in such cities in which the Apostles haue preached, planted, and to whome they haue written.
say it is vntrue, for Tertullian against newe heretikes, sendeth vs not to the emptye chayres of the Apostles, which had written to such cities, but vnto the the testimony of their doctrine, receyued from the Apostles, and continued vntill that time.
So he sendeth them that are in Achaia, to Corinthe. such as are in Macedonia to Philippi, those that are in Asia to Ephesus, them which be neare Italy to Rome, from whence they of Africa had their authoritie, not by excellency of that Church aboue other Apostolike Churches, but by nearenes of place: Therfore he saith, Proxima est tibi Achaia? habes Corinthum.
Si potes in Asiam tendere, habes Ephesum, si autem Italiae adieceris, habes Romam, vnde nobis quae{que} auctoritas presto est statuta.
If thou be not farre from Macedonia, thou hast Philippi.
If thoulye neare to Italy, thou hast the Church of Rome from whence vnto vs also (in Africa) authoritie is setled nearer at hand.
But Bristow sayth that the auncient fathers when there were many Apostolike Churches standing, they did principally and singularly direct men alwayes to the Church of Rome.
This you see to be false, by the place of Tertullian last cied.
But that they did more often direct men to the testimony of the Church of Rome, it was for that by meanes of the Imperiall citie, it was more notorious and best knowne.
Otherwise it is a very lye of Bristow, where he sayth, that when the fathers name the Apostolike church, they do meane the Romane church by excellency, as the Poet signifieth Vergil and the Philosopher Aristotle.
like lye it is, that no Church remayneth in the world founded by any of the Apostles, but onely Rome.
For many Churches remayne to this day, that were planted by the Apostle Paule, who from Hierusalem to Illyricum filled all the contryes with the doctrine of the Gospell: of which many vnto this day continue in profession of Christianitie, beside all the Churches of India AEthiopia, which were also planted by the Apostles Thomas and other.
The more beastly is the blundering of this Bristow, who dreameth, that the councell of Constantinople the
which made this confession by the Apostolike Church, did not onely meane the Romane Church, but also none other but the Romane Church.
As though that councell could not distinguish the Catholike Apostolike Church, dispersed ouer all face of the earth, from the particular Apostolike Church of Rome, which was but a member therereof: when the same councel gaue the like priuiledges of honor to the Church of Constantinople, which the Church of Rome had, reseruing but the senioritie to ye Church of Rome.
And being called to a councel at Rome by the Princes letters, procured by Damasus Bishop of Rome, other Bishops of Italy the West, they refused to come, as hauing already by the Emperour of the East being gathered to Constantinople, oncluded what they thought good to be decreed, Histor. trip. lib. cap.
And in their epistle written to their fellow ministers Damasus, Ambrose &c. gathered in councell at Rome, wherein they excused their refusall to come, they call the Church of Antiochia, seniorem vere apostolicam Ecclesiam, the elder, truly an Apostolike Church.
The church of Ierusalem they call the mother of all Churches.
Nether was it euer in their mind, to make the particular Church of Rome, the only Apostolike Church of the world, but onely a principall member consenting with the same.
The succession of bishops of Rome alledged by Irenaeus, Tertullian, Augustine, Optatus doth nothing in the world defend the popish bishops in their successio~ vnto this day, for so much as they succeede not in doctrine, as well as in place.
Nether doe we make any leape from Luther vnto the Apostles, but prouing our doctrine to be the doctrine of the Apostles, we doubt no more of perpetuall succession thereof, then knowing our selues to be descended from Adam, we doubt whether we haue had a line all discent of progenitors vnto this time, that may vse Bristowes owne example, to declare that numbring of Bishops is no more necessary in the one, the~ shewing our pedegrie in the other.
Seing the question is not how many men, in what places were professed this doctrine, but whether it be the same which
Apostles taught: but that can not better be proued, then by the writings of
The places cited by Bristow for succession out of Irenaeus Tertullian Optatus, Augustine you shall sinde answered in my confutation of Stapletons fortres part.
where also is answered the place of S. Luke cap.
S. Bede of our religion, the Rmaine church his motiue, Protesta~ts be of many old heresies.
If the Romaines had not chau~ged their religion since their faith was co~mended by the Apostle, there should be no controuersie betwene vs them.
And if Bristow ca~ proue by the Apostles writing that he is of their religion, or that they were of the Popish religio~ the strife is at an ende.
How farre Bde was of your religion, haue shewed in the answer to Stapletons fortresse.
But he vrgeth vs to shew, what Pope chaunged their religion, what tumults rising in the worlde thereon, what Doctors withstoode it, what cou~cels accused &c. which he saith they can shew in all innouatio~s both great sinal, that euer by heretikes were atte~pted.
What an impudent lyar is this Bristow to brag of that, which at this day is impossible to be don, by any ma~ liuing in the worlde.
For of so many heretikes as are rehersed by Epiphanius Augustine, not the one halfe of the~ can be so shewed as Bristow like a blind bayard boasteth they can doe.
But if we say the chaunge was not made al at once we must shew whe~ euery pece was altered, as they do of our doctrin, of old taught by many old heretiks, AErius denying praier for the dead &c. Whereof many are slau~ders lyes, the rest if we can not defend by Scriptures let them be take~ for heresies.
To the purpose, we haue often shewed and are ready daily to shew, the beginning of many of their heresies, errors, as of the Popes supremacy in Victor, of prayer for the dead in the Montanists, of their crossing in the Valentinians, of images in the Gnosikes and Carpocratians, and so of a great many other errors, which are contrary to the holy Scriptures, by which we first reproue them of falshood, and as stories serue vs, we open their beginnings.
And wheras Bristow without all shame, affirmeth that prayer for the dead was vsed alwayes, citeth Irenaeus among other for his auctor he sheweth nothing but impudency matched with his heresie, for there is no worde in Ireneus, to proue that prayer for the dead was vsed of any godly man of his time.
Tertullian a Montanist is the first that maketh any mention of prayers for the dead, only in such bookes as he wrote when he was an heretike.
That ye church of God nether appoueth, nor keepeth secret, nor doth such thinges as be against the faith, and good maners, it is to be vnderstanded of such things, as the church knoweth to be against the faith.
For of some thinges the church may be ignorant, as Augustine confesseth in his retractations lib.
Vbicun{que} in his libris commemoraui ecclesiam non habentem maculam aut ruga non sic accipiendum est, quasi iam sit, sed quae praeparatur vt sit, quando apparebit etiam gloriosa. nunc enim propter quasdam ignorantias infirmitates mebrorum surum, habet vnde qutidie tota dicat: Dimitte nobis dbita nostra.
Wheresoeuer in those bookes haue made mention of ye church, not hauing spot or wrinckle, it is not to be take~, as though she were so now, but which is prepared that he may be when she shall appeare also glorious: For now because of certaine ignorances and infirmities of her members, euen the whole church hath cause to say euerie day, forgiue vs our trespasses.
Notwithstanding the watchmen therefore prophecied by Esay, continually geuing warning vpon the walles against the inuasion of open enemies, and blasphemous heretikes, yet many hypocrites haue crept into the church secretly, and vnder shew of pietie, haue shewed many errors and superstitions, while the mysterie of miquity wrough the full manifestation and Apostasie of Antichrist.
In the demaunde Bristow denyeth that any Pope did erre, although haue shewed both out of stories, S. Hierom, the Pope Damasus, and the generall councels, the contrarie.
But admitting they did erre, yet (sayth he) they erred not in such matters as the Protestantes doe now charge the Pope Romaines withall.
Whereto answer, that against that blasphemous principle of theirs, that the Pope can not erre, we first bring in those examples of Popes, that were heretikes for their time altered religion like heretikes in such mattes as we both confesse to be errors.
Then this being obteyned, that the Pope is not priuiledged from error, the matters in controuersie wherewith we charge the Pope, are to be examined only by the auctoritie of the holy Scriptures and thereby to be decided.
All nations that were at the first co~uerted to the true faith of Christ were conuerted by the Apostles, whose faith and doctrine we hold, and will proue by their writings that we holde none other.
As for the argument of ryers preaching in India miracles wrought so fa. re hence, with such great conuersion of the Indians vnto Popery, if it were true, yet proueth it no more then the preaching and miracles of the false Apostles Phil.
and the conuersion of the Gothes and Vandalls Crepides &c. by the Arrians and other nations by Nestorius &c. doth proue those false Apostles to be true Apostles, or the heresies of the Arrians &c. to be true doctrine.
Wherefore not the Papistes, but the Apostles of Christ, were his witnesses, vnto the vttermost places of the earth.
But of this matter of cnuersion, and all thinges conteyned, you may reade somewhat more at large in mine aunswere to Stapletons fortresse, where the same is handled.
S. Augustines motiue for which Christ is to be beleued.
Our religion an inuincible motiue to forsake idolls and beleue in Christ, who is to be beleued for the vertue of the signe of his crosse, which working miracles, was the motiue of Lactantius.
The crosse and the masse confirmed by S. Bernard, in Italy.
In this motiue is much babling, but no matter at all.
That Popery is not idolatrie, as we charge it because by Popery Idolatrie hath bene destroyed.
Although this argument is naught, because one kinde of Idolatrie may destroy an other, yet it is falsely affirmed, that Poperie hath destroyed all idolatry.
That Popery hath destroyed idolatry: Bristow wil proue by three examples, the one of the reliques of Sainctes, and the honor of them, the other of the signe of the crosse and the honorthereof, and the last by the reall presence in the Sacrament, which he calleth his Lord and his God.
But our Lord and God is in heauen according to the Psalm.
The destruction of idolatrie by Christ in deede was prophecied therefore the Pope setting vp and mainteyning as grosse idolatrie almost as euer was any of the Paganes, sheweth him selfe to be a verie Antichrist.
sayth that the heretikes in Fraunce were possessed with the deuill which could not abide the might and whips of the holy ashes.
If he spake this against Vigila~tius, other godly men, which reproued the immoderate honoring of reliques and other superstitions, he spake of his owne iudgement, and not of the iudgement of the church.
For he only of all writers of his time, counted Vigilantius an heretike as he did Ruffinus also, which yet is take~ for as good a Catholike as he.
It is knowne how he taunteth and scoffeth at Augustine.
Wherefore his censure is not sufficient to make Vigilantius opinion heresie, nor them heretikes which were of his iudgeme~t.
But admit this iudgement of Hierom to be sounde, yet was not the honor and estimation of reliques which he defendeth, against Vigilantius the same, which is in Poperie, but much differing there fro~.
Nos autem non dico martyrum reliquias, sed ne solem quidem unam, non Angelos non Archangelos non Cherubin, non Seraphim, omne nomen quod nominatur in presenti saeculo in futuro colimus adoramus, ne seruiamus potius creaturae qua~ creatori qui est benedictus in saecula.
say not the reliques of the martyrs, but not the sunne the moone, not the Angells not Archangels, not Cherubin, not Seraphim, euery name that is named both in this world, and in the world to come least we should serue the creaturerather then the creator which is blessed for euer.
By this you may see that the honor they gaue to reliques was but a reuerent estimatio~ of them, for Christs sake, whose seruaunts the Martyrs were, and a lesse honor then they gaue to the Sunne and the Moone, as is manifest by his gradation, and consequently no religious worship.
As the Papistes vse and mayntayne of the reliques, not of Saynctes, but oftentymes of deuills incarnate, of beasts and all manner of fayned bables.
Nether is there any thing more monstrous in popery, then their shameles fayning of infinite reliques.
That Augustine writeth that deuils were tormented and expelled, at the memories or burialls of the martyrs, where somtimes idolls were worshipped, it proueth that idols were destroyed by Poperie.
For if God wrought miracles at such places, where the bodies of his Martyrs slept to co~firme the faith, for which they died, doth this make any thing for Popery? But the same Augustine to the Maudaurenses that were Pagans, and other heathen men vseth the argument of the greater honor and reuerence doone by Kings and Emperours at the tombes and memories of the Saintes and Martyrs, and of miracles wrought at the same places, to shew the power of Christe to the confusion of idolatrie.
This wee graunt, but how doth Popery ouerthrowe Idolatrie? There reuerence although in so~e respects superstitious, was far from popish Idolatrie, of worshipping of Saints, Images, bones, &c, as wee haue shewed euen now out of Hierom the most eger defender of those vses and abuses in his time: The miracles approued none other doctrine, then the matyrs died for, who died for none other doctrine, but such as is contayned in the holy Scriptures, in which Poperie hath no ground.
The like say of the storie of the bodie of Babycas the martyr, in presence wherof, the oracle of Apollo could not speake.
But Chrysostom to draw mn from all kind of idolatrie, sent them from reliques.
In Gen. Hom. Nay he sent them to the churches and houses of prayer, to the graues of the martyrs not to worship them, as Papistes doe, but by such things to receaue blessing and to kepe them selues from being enta~gled with the snares of the deuill, while they be put in mind of the vertue of the martyrs, to follow their godly co~uersation.
And albeit there were some superstitio~ in that regard of martyrs troubles memories, as in that age there was, yet doth it not follow, there was all Popery, nor such grosse idolatry as Papistes doe commit with their counterfait rehques.
Finally the miracles wroght by God at the dead bodies of the Saincts, might wel be vsed by Augustin, Chrysostom, Theodoret against the Ge~tills, asan argument to ouerthrow their idolatrie, euen as the example of the miracles wrought by God at the dead body of Elizeus against the idolatrous Israelits Reg. but it followeth not therof, that idols should be made of their lawes, by worshipping them as the Papists do.
For ye bones of Elizeus were not for that miracle take~ out of his graue shined in gold, deuided into many churches worshiped, licked, and kissed, as the Popish guise is.
The same aunswere make concerning miracles wrought by God with the signe of the crosse, which was the motiue of Lactantius.
say they proue not that the signe of the crosse should be worshipped, no more then the miracles wrought by God, with the brasen serpe~t, were any cause why the Israelits should worship the brasen serpent.
And as touching the blessed Sacrament, which Bristow blasphemously calleth his Lord and God, although the reall presence and transsubstantiation were graunted, forasmuch as the Papists the~ selues affirme the Sacrament to consist of accidents as the signe, but no accide~ts are God or in God: If any miracles were wrought by God at the celebration therof, as Augustine and Cyprian seeme to auouch, yet neither is the reall presence proued by those miracles, nor they tryed to be Papists, for writing of such miracles, of which if any man will see more, let him resorte to mine aunswere vnto Heskins lib.
Vnto the storie of S. Bernards life we geue no credit, as to a counterfait fable, and as litle to the reporte of M. Poynts, his booke of the reall presence testifying the casting out of many deuils, by vertue of the same sacrament.
Finally it is alltogeather false, that he sayeth, the Iewes religion was chaynged by Christ into Popery.
For the sacrifice of Christes death, against which the sacrifice of the Popish masse is blasphemous, hath taken away all sacrifices ceremonies of the law.
Concerning the Altar which Christians haue, whereof they haue no power to cae which serue the Tabernacle, Heb.
Vnity of the church a motiue to beleue in Christ.
Our Sauiour Christ praieth that his disciples may be one in God him theyr redeemer.
And this vnitye all Protestantes retaine, notwithstanding diuersity of opinion in one article, any contention about ceremonies.
Euen as the Apostles were one, in one God and Christ, although there was variaunce about Circumcision ceremonies.
Ciprian Cornelius, the Romayne church the church of Carthage, were at vnitye in Christ, although the one of them erred in the sacrame~t of baptisme.
So were Hierome, Augustine, allthough they mayneteyned contrary opinions about Peters dissembling translation of the Scripture.
From this verily except such schiinaties, as delight in contencion, which haue allwayes bene against the true church.
As for the vnity of the Papistes, seeing it is not in the doctrine of Christ, it proueth no more, that they are those for whom Christ prayed, then the vnity of the Mahometistes which for these thousand yeares, haue kept greater vnity then the Papists, whose church hath bene rent a sunder into so many heades as there haue bene Popes at once, and that very often and for many yeares together there haue bene Pope against Pope, cou~cel against cou~cell, Doctors against Doctors, orders against orders, Canonists against Diuines, disse~ting in articles of faith, as of the Popes supremacy, of original sinne, of transubstantiation &c. Wherefore Christian vnity, is as vntruly denyed vnto vs, as falsely challenged vnto them whatsoeuer he prateth of Lutherans, Zwinglians, Caluinists, Protestants and Puritans.
Obedience of Catholiks to their superiors both ecclesiasticall and temperall.
Bristrow braggeth that their church hath iudges infallible in cases of controuersie, and ours hath not.
But who be their iudges? The Pope or the generall councell? Whether soeuer of these be, nether is irrefragable.
For both haue bene controlled and found fault withall, as haue shewed before, and they them selues are together by the eares, whether of these is irrefragable, because the councell hath deposed the Pope, the Pope hath not obeyed the councell, as it is manifest betwene Eugenius the
How infallible the churches iudgement is and alwayes hath bene, it serueth not the Romish synagogue, vntill she proue her doctrine to be agreable to the Scriptures, which seeing she neither can doe, nor dare abyde the triall of them, she sheweth plainly, that she is not the church of Christ.
As for the auctoritie of synodes such as that of the Apostles was, which determined the controuersy by auctority of the holy Scriptures, Protesta~ts do gladly acknowledge, how necessary it is for the church to decide controuersies and do willingly submit them selues thereto.
The subiection of Papists to their indges, doth no more proue their religion to be true, then the obedience of the Mahometistes to their superiors, both in cases of religion, and of the common wealth, doth iustifie their sect to be the religion of God.
What Trinitaries other sectaries be in Polonia, or elswhere, that wil not submit themselues to any auctority, as they are no parte of our church, so we haue no cause to excuse or defende them.
In the demaunde, Bristow complaineth of an vnlearned Christian, which hath bene suffered to write a vaine libell against the auctority of the church of God, which is a vaine lye, for there is no true Christian learned or vnlearned, which will hold against the church of God, so lo~g as she is directed by the word of God, as the true church is in all matters necessarie vnto saluation.
But perhaps the vnlearned Christian hath challenged the church of Rome to approue her doctrine by auctority of Gods word.
Which because the Papists dare not atte~pt, Bristow requireth can not tel what approbation priuiledge of the sayd libell, to shew a bad shift better then none at all, why they wil not answere it.
For Popish libells that are but cast abroad in writing, we require no approbation nor priuiledge, dare not the Papists confute a printed libell before it haue approbation priuiledge? The
Although we did receaue such things, as he reherseth vpon their churches credit, it followeth not, that theirs is the true church, for we receaue nothing from them, without dew exammation.
The Scriptures we receaue not, vpon the only credit of the Popish church, but vpon the credit of ye vniuersall church of Christ.
The creedes, articles of doctrine, tearmes of person trinitie, consubstantiality, Sacraments &c. we receaue, because they be consonant to the Scriptures, not because the church of Rome tellth they be true.
As for the auctoritie of the church, which he sayth was S. Augustines motiue, to beleue the Gospell, was not a single or sole motiue, but a commotiue or an argument that with other argume~ts did moue him, for the sayth not moueret but commoueret: and so it is with vs. Prouided alwayes that the Popish church be no taken for that Catholike or vniuersall church.
VVhat then (sayth Bristow) was it the Protestants church whereof Augustine ment? or can you hold laughter when the question is asked? No verily, for when the Protestants church, that it is now so called in this age, like as it was called the Homousians church in Augustines time, is a member of the Catholike vniuersall church of Christ, and so proued by the holy Scriptures, it is a ridiculous thing to doubt whether it were the popish church which is but an hereticall assembly, departed from the vniuersall church long since Augustines departure out of this life.
But Bristow will proue, that the church at whose commanndement Augustine beleued the Gospell, was not the Protesta~ts church, because that church commaunded him to beleue the bookes of Toby, Iudith.
VVisdome, Ecclesiasticus, the Machabees to be canonicallscripture, which the church of Protestantes doth denye.
But what it Augustine were deceiued? to thinke he hearde the voice of the Catholike church when he did not, shall the Protestantes churche be condemned? S. Hierome who if the church of Rome were the Catholike church, was more like to heare her voice, because he was a Priest of the church of Rome, telleth vs a cleane contrary tale.
Sicut ergo Iudith, Tobiae, Machabaeorum libros legit quidem ecclesia, sed eos inter Canonicas scripturas non recipit: sic haec duo volumina leg at ad aedificationem plebis, non ad auctoritatem ecclesiasticorum dogmatum confirmandam.
Therfore as the Church in deade readeth the bookes of Iudith and Tobias and of the Macchabees, but yet she receiueth them not among the Canonicall scriptures, so she may reade these two Bookes (speaking of the booke of Wisedome and Ecclesiasticus) for the edifying of the common people, but not for confirming the authoritie of Ecclesiasticall doctrine.
Doth the Church of Protestants iudge otherwise of these Bookes, then that Church which thus instructed Hierome? What then? must say as Bristowe doth, S. Hierome and the Catholike Church in his time of our Religion.
The Church of Rome now is of an other iudgement, then the Church of Rome was then, ergo it is not now that it was then.
But whereas Bristowe chargeth vs to to deny, or at least to leaue indifferent the Canticles of Salomon.
The Epistle to the Hebrues, The Epistles of Saint Iames, Peter, S. Iohn, Sainct Iude, with the Apocalips, it is a diuelish slaunder, as God knoweth and the wold can beare vs witnesse.
Bristowe demaundeth whether the Popish Church receiuing the Scriptures of the olde and newe Testament from Christ, hath not kept them faithfully without adding, minishing, or corrupting.
aunswere no, for the Popish church receiueth none of Christ, but the catholike church of Christ.
Againe the popish Church hath added whole bokes to the canon which the chuch of the Iewes neuer receiued, nor the vniuersall Church of Christ.
But those Bokes (saith Bristow) hath the Protestants church robbed vs of, wc are allowed by approued Councels.
You heard in the last motiue Hieromes iudgement of those bookes, whervnto agreeth the cou~cel of Laodiea cap.
Augustine receiueth the boks of Macchabees but with condition of sobrietie in the reader or hearer.
Last of al the popish church, either of fraud or negligence, hath corrupted an exceeding great number of textes of the scripture in her vulgar latine translation, wc she receueth as only authentical.
The very first promise of the gospel is corrupted and falsyfied.
For wheras the trueth is Ipsum contret caput the same seede shall broose thine head, the popish translation hath Ipsa the same woman.
yeeres (as we co~fesse our selues) occupyed no bible, nor had any thing to do with the scriptures, he lieth out of al measure, for the church of Christ hath alwaies had the scriptures, in euery nation where it was, it had the~ in their mother toung.
hundreth yeeres past in the English toung, beside other in the Saxon language.
The like are to be proued to haue ben in al places where the Churches were gathered as in France, Italy, Bohemia. &c. Finally, whatsoeuer he bableth of their Church to be the store house of the Scriptures trueth, the like may be said of the greke Church which they co~demne as schismaticall hereticall, therefore this storehouse is no Motiue, to proue the Romish Sinagogue to be the church of God.
demaund he asketh whether as wel Protestants as other, doe not condemne the old writers errors other heresies of Heretiks which made great shew of scriptures by the rule of ye popish churchs faith.
answere, the Protestants out of the scriptures, do can disproue such shew of scriptures made by maisters of error, are no more moued by the popish churches authoritie, then the Apostles were moued by authoritie of the Iewish Synagogue, to reproue all the grosse Idolatrie and snperstition of the Gentiles.
Therfore the popish Church is not Depositorium Diues, that rich storehouse of trueth, which was S. Ireneus motiue.
Such was Iew elr ignoraunce also, that Christe is a prieste according to his Godhead.
The ignorance of Protestants, the cause partely why there be so many Atheistes in England.
This Motiue conteineth nothing but an immederate arrogant bragge of their studying and teaching of trueth, with the great learning of their Doctors and Vniuersities: and a proude disdamefull vpbraiding of our Doctors and vniuersities, of much ignorance and lacke of learning.
Which comparison if it had beene vttered by a man of excellent learning, had beene the lesse odious, but beeing made by such a blinde Baiarde and blockheadded asse, as is this Bristowe, it is moste intollerable.
Caluiue (saith he) through ignoraunce, erred about the Trinitie, saying, That Gods Sonne is [undefined span alphabet] that is God of him selfe, whereby it followeth ineuitably that there be two Gods.
&c. where is no such word nor matter, but a confutation of Heretikes, that denyed the very essens of the deitie of Christ, he cyteth also Geneb. de trinit. lib.
Where if the woorde [undefined span alphabet] be vsed, as know not whether it be, yet vndoutedly no such thing is ment thereby as Bristow bableth.
For [undefined span alphabet] maye signifie him that is very God himselfe, although begotten of God the father, eue~ as Gregory Nazianzene in his Booke of the holy Ghost, or De theologia lib.
calleth the holy Ghost [undefined span alphabet] the Lorde himselfe, whereof it followeth not that there be two or three Lords, or that the holy ghost proceedeth not from the father and the sonne.
Light it selfe and Life: that is very light and very life, and yet he denyeth not that he is light, proceeding from light.
Wherefore this is an vnlearned cauil against Caluine, who more sou~dly, substantially learnedly hath written of the blessed trinitie, then all the Dunces, Aquines, Alberts, the whole rablement of Scholemen, of whome Bristow so vainely doth brag, were euer able to attaine vnto, who with their sophistrie and barbarousnes haue rather darkened, then sette foorth the cleere light of those most excellent and diuine misteries.
The like impudent cauil, he bringeth against M. Iewel, whome no man think without laughter can read, to be charged with ignora~ce by blu~dering Bristow, for affirmiug Christ to be a prieste according to his deitie, who~e the Apostle expresly saith, by his eternall spirit to haue offred himself.
As for the comparisons betweene the Vniuersities of Papistes and ours, how vaine it is, all that be learned of indifferent iudgement can testifie.
And concerning degrees and ciuil titles of dignitie taken in our vniuersities, beeing nothing else but testmonies of their learning which receiue them, we think them better beeing confirmed by the Princes authoritie, from whom all cidignities euen by ciuil law are deriued, then such as are either giuen or confirmed by the Popes leaden Bulles.
The Atheists other vnreligious mindes in England, are not nourished by the ignorance of the Protestants, but detested by their godly and learned iudgement.
But if where there be most Atheists there is greatest ignorance, then euen in Italy at Rome vnder the Popes nose, where be most Atheists of any regio~ almost in the world, is greatest ignorance.
Where open blasphemies are as common, yea oftentimes in the Popes mouth, as the praises of God are among true christians.
What trauller in Italy is ignorant of this, whether he be protestant, Papist, or Newter.
Last of all, if the Chuches wisdome, learning, continuance, was S. Augustines motiue, the folly, barbarousnes, late shining of the popish Church, is a motiue to make vs think that it is not the church of Christ.
For Bristowes brags are not sufficient to carry away all credit of learning to popish doctors Vniuersities, whose orders and readings he doth the rather commend to be so excellent, that men wc knew him of late, with periury to haue taken degrees in Philosophie, should not meruaile that he is so sudenly transformed into so great a doctor of diuinitie, eue~ by once hearing the cause of Diuinitie, which he supposeth none of our doctors knoweth what it meaneth, such a goodly matter is [undefined span alphabet] whereby a manne maketh moste account of that he hath learned last.
But albeit the question be not of learning but of trueth, yet if it would please the Papists to try the learning of our doctors Vniuersities, vnder indifferent iudges, doubt not but they should be found equall vnto theirs, that say not in many things they should be found superiour.
Christ is to be beleued for the scriptures of the olde testame~t as they be vnderstood in the church.
Ember daies or Enper dayes, whichy our blinde Apostles doe boldely say to haue ben the Popes leman.
Saints dayes laide downe by protestants as our Ladyes daies, S. Laurence day, the assumption of our Lady.
The Churches and seruie of heretikes to be rfrained in paine of damnation.
The sermons of Heretikes not to be heard, their bookes not to be read.
Christ to be beleeued for the vertue of the signe of his Crosse, which workesh miracles.
The Annuall celebration of Christes misteries, by dumb ceremonies and readings not vnderstood of the ignorant people, although there were no heresie in the popish seruice nor no sufficient motiues to imbrace the popish synagogue as the church of Christ, if the Scriptures and the figures of the lawe, better applyed, then they be in all the lumpe of the popish solemnities, they would procure small credit to our Sauiour Christ: but rather the scorning and derision of Turkes, Iewes, and Pagans.
As for the blind comme~taries of the Iewes, out of which he magineth we haue all our vnderstanding of the old testament, how litle we trust in prophecyes of Christ, may be seene in the written commentaries of Caluine, Musculus, such other.
The names of a great number of the solemne feastes, (as Bristow sayth) doth argue in deede the Papists ether to haue inuented the~, or to haue abused them, as Candelmas, Corpus Christi day &c, but that the same were inuented by that auncient Church, wc celebrated the natiuity, resurrection, ascention of Christ cat is vtterly vntrue.
For your owne Durand testifieth, that many of them were of late Popes institutio~, wc were of another factio~, but no: of the church of Christ.
Howe vaine a brag it is, that the martyrs were of the Papistes religion, because they keepe holy their dayes, leaue to be answered with childrens laughture.
But it is a great offence weene, that Protestants haue put downe most of the Saincts daies, namely S. Lawrence his day, all our Ladies daies, assumption all.
If a man shoulde aske you wherefore you keepe not S. Abrahams day, co~sidering he was the father of the faithfull, nor S. Esayes &c: what could you answer? As for the Ladies daies wc he complaineth to be put downe by vs, namely the feasts of her conception, natiuitye, visitation assumption, the Church could be without some of the~ more then hundreth yeares.
instituted the feast of the visitation of some called the new found Lady daye about the yeare of Christ
as the very popishe seruice of that daye confesseth in the first lesso~.
The feast of the natiuity, is not much elder as both the lessons Durand do acknowledge, which affirmeth that one Fulbertus a Bishop Cardinal made part of the seruice.
That the feast of the assumption can not be very auncient, it appeareth not onely by the barbarous hymnes in the popishe Churche that daye, but also by the lessons taken out of Bede, by whiche it is manifest, that the Church coulde be without that goodly solemnitie, more thn
yeares after Christ, as a great number of other festiuities which borrow their lessons out of Bede, doe shew sufficiently, that the popish seruice is nether so auncient nor so vniuersall, as the Papistes most impudently doe affirme.
As for the feast of the conception of the Virgine Marye, is not full one hundreth yeare olde, being decreed by Sixtus the
in great despight of the Dominike Fryers, which did both preach and wright against it.
Wherefore there is no such intollerable fault assuredly committed, in omitting such festiuities, as Bristow cryeth out, nether we lacke proper dayes of our Ladye, as he sayth, whereby he bewrayeth the grosse Idolatrie of Papistes, which are not content to honor our Sauiour Christ in his Sainctes, but the Sainctes must haue proper dayes dedicated to their honor alone, and vtterly seperated from the honor of Christ.
For it satisfieth not Bristow, that we keepe holy the annunciation purification of Mary, because the one of them sayth he, is the conception, the other the presentation of Christ.
But Papistes keepe her natiuitie, visitation, conception, and assumption, which are the proper dayes of our Lady.
passe ouer that he affirmeth the assumption of her body as a certaine truth, which the very popish lessons songe on that festiuitie, leaue in doubt, and incline rather to the contrary opinion, that the was assumpted onely in soule.
Likewise that he calleth her the Lady of Saincts and Angels, which title the holy Scriptures doe not only not giue vnto her, but plainly denye.
both of men and of Angels, which doth not onely exclude all other Lordes of the masculine gender, but much more all Ladyes, and generally surmounteth all principalitie, power, Lordship, and euery name that is named, both in this world and in the world to come.
The Virgine Mary is therefore no Lady of Sainctes and Angells, but a fellow seruaunt of God with them.
What excellency soeuer she hath of Gods gift, more then any of them.
That we keepe no solemnitie of S. Lawrens, it is not for any contempt of his holines, nor for any worship of Iohn Baptist and the Apostles, that we solemnize their memories.
But therein the Churche vseth her libertie as in things indifferent.
Whereas Bristow doubteth not that if any of vs would once be present at the reuerent solemne doing of the popish Catholike seruice, especially at Christmas, Easter or such like time, but it would melt our stny harts with ioye, &c.
For first many thousands of vs, haue bene present, and with greefe of hart haue seene and beheld the doing of those Idolatrous solemnities.
Secondly he declareth, how he him selfe is caried away with piping, singing, sensing, and swinging in copes &c, so that he can not discerne the true worship of God, which is in spirite and veritie, from the carnall and counterfeit solemnities of Idolatry and superstition.
Last of all, how childishly doth he referre all Catholike solemnitie to the vaine pompe vsed onely in great and Cathedrall Churches, when a thowsand pashes beside in the poore contrey townes, haue all their trashe so beggerly and rudely set forth, that the Papistes them selues laughe them to scorne.
The rest of this motiue is spent in disswading Papists from learning our seruice, or sermons, or reading of our bookes, by which it is plain, that he so much mistrusteth his cause, that he dare not once permit his disciples to inquire of it, or to heare any thing that may be sayd to the contrary.
As for popishe priestes that say the newe (as he termeth it) seruice, woulde they woulde followe his councell to saye it no more.
That it is not lawfull for Christians to communicate with heretiks, or Idolaters, it is a playne case: But it shall neuer be proued that they be heretikes, which teach nothing but the doctrine of holy Scripture, or that they are Idolaters, which are ready to giue their liues rather then to worship Idolls.
But the yeare of Iubely is a greate motiue for greate fooles to embrace popery, which Iubely Pope Boniface the
did first institute in the veare of our Lord by apish or rather deuelish imitation of the fathers of the old testament for filthy lukers sake, beside the horrible blashemye of full remission of sinnes graunted by the Pope in that yeare, which is denied to be giuen by the death of Christ.
is of a later institution ordeyned to be kept euery
yeare, because it was to long for the Pope to tary vntill the hundreth and
This is the antiquitie of that Iubely pardon, and pilgrimage.
The miracle which S. Augustine reporteth of Innocentia that was warned in her dreame, to desire the first woman which she did meete, returning from baptisme at Easter, to signe her breast with the signe of the crosse, on which was a canker, for cure of which she had longe prayed vnto God: declareth in deede the vertue of Christ, which can vse all meanes to worke health where it pleaseth him, but nothing at all maketh for popery.
For if it hath pleased God at any yme to worke wonders by the signe of the crosse, it followeth not thereof ether that the signe of the crosse hath any vertue in it, more then that hemme of Christes garment had, by which a woman also was healed, or els that an ordinary ceremonye is to be made of signing with the crosse, more then of touchinge the hemme of anye garment.
demaunde he asketh whether in the most auncient seruice of the primitiue Church, there was not alwayes prayer for the deade and to Saynctes, the ceremonies vsed by Papistes in baptisme &c.
speaketh not of prayer for the deade in any place, but of oblation for the falling a sleepe that is thankes giuing for the departure of the deade, and naming them in the prayers of the Church which dyed in the faith of Christ, and in obedience of the Church.
In the tyme of Eusebius that errour of praying for the deade was in deede receyued in many places of the Churche, which beganne first amonge the Montanists.
The ceremonies of exuflation and exorcisme were not idlely vsed in the primitiue Church, as they are of the Papistes, but when the persons to be baptised were sensibly possessed with deuills as appeareth in Cyprian lib.
Likewise where he demaund th whether we reade at any tyme when Masse did first come into the Churches.
aunswere if by Masse he meaneth that popish forme of sacrificing, which they vse and call Masse, we reade of euery parte of it when and by what Pope it came in.
By Masse he meaneth the doctrine of the carnall presence, transubstantiation, adoration of the sacrament and making it a sacrifice propitiatory for the quicke and the deade, aunswer that we reade all these heresies to haue crept into the Church of Rome, since the first six hundreth yeares.
And as for the substance of the canon, being contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles, is easie to be proued that it came not from the Apostles, beside that some of them ascribe it to Gregory, and Gregory him selfe to Scholasticus, so that being of some antiquitie it conteyneth in it, matter repugnant euen vnto the popish heresies.
For first it calleth the co~secrated breade and wine the sacrifices, and offereth them for the whole Church.
Secondly after consecration it calleth the Sacrament Panem sanctum vite aeternae, calicem salutis aeternae, holye breade of eternall life, and cuppe of eternall health, of the giftes of God, and prayeth God to accept it as the sacrifice of Abell.
Thirdly the priest prayeth that God will commaund same to be caried by an Angellinto his high alter &c. Fourthly he prayeth for all them that haue receyued the same sacrament with him which can not stand with a priuate Masse.
Finally, that it came not euidently of the Apostles, as Bristow impudently affirmeth, it may be euide~tly seene by this, that diuerse Sainctes are named in it, which liued more then two hundreth yeares after the Apostles as Cosmus Damiaius &c.
And that we are able to finde more fault with it then with Gloria Patri, Te Deum &c. it is plentifully declared by many volumes, and namely by Bishop of Sarum in his sermon and defence of the same against Harding.
Although a great number of churches, that are now standing were builded by Papistes, and for Popery, yet not all.
For the chiefest and most auncient Cathedrall churches, were neither builded by Papistes, nor for Popery, but by Christian Princes and for the vse of Christian religion.
where was but one table or altare, which was remoueable made of bords placed in the midest of the Church.
contrary to the popish fashion which hath many Altars, and all againste walles or pillers, and the chiefest against the farthest wall, most commonly.
It is a fonde reason of Bristowe that they were built for Popery, because they are builte in length to the East, or in forme of a Crosse.
For many are built rounde, and those with crosse Iles, are moste vnmeete for masse at the high Altar, which they that sit in the crosse Yles cannot see.
Likewise Bede, whome Bristowe in the demaunde without shame doth quote for the contrary, testifieth that the churches of the Romaines. lib.
speaking of Niua, one that was brought vp at Rome, which at a place called Candida casa now Whiterne: Made a Church of stone of an other facion, then the Britans were wont to build.
And concerning the founding of Ecclesiasticall liuings and Vniuersities, we know that the first dotation of Churches, was by Christian Princes, what if superstition hath added any thing to them? Nether the building of Churches, not the founding of liuings and Vniuersities, doth proue the builders or founders to be of good religion, not yet co~demne the vsers of such Churches, liuings and Vniuersities, of vsurping or sacriledge.
The idolatrous Church of Pantheon at Rome, was turned into Maria rotunda.
Gregory councelled Augustine to conuert the Idolatrous Churches of the Saxons, to the vse of Christian religion.
The Vniuersitie of Athens, founded by heahen Philosophers, was after frequented by Christian schollers as testifieth Gregory Nazianzene in Monod.
And if we beleue our English stories, ye liuings of the Idolatrous Flamines Arch Flamines was conuerted to the mayntenancs of the Bishops and ArchBishops.
The Communion booke an apish imitation of our Masse booke.
The maner of Apes is to counterfeit and follow visible actions, without any meaning or profit.
Such imitation haue we none, but the apish Church of Rome, is ful of such following of the gestures of Christ, in their masse and other ceremonies.
Yea they counterfeit the voice of Pilate Iudas in reading the gospel on Palme Sonday.
They play the apes of the Primitiue Church, in coniuring the deuil in baptisme.
Yea they be the apes of Aaron the leuitical Priestes, in their robes, sensing, sacrificing.
The very Pagans they follow in ceremonies festiuities, as their owne Durand confesseth.
In whose Rationale diuinorum, you may see the learning wisdom of the popish Church, for all their mischieuous mysteries.
As for vs, we imitate nothing that they doe, to get commendation by similitude of their doings, but rather we abhorre whatsoeuer hath but a shew of popery, if we vse any thing rightly, which is abused of them, we are not therefore apes of them, but they apes of the auncient fathers, whose doctrine we doe truely follow, as they vainely imitate and in imitation falsely peruert their examples.
That the communion booke is an apish imitation of the masse booke, is a most shamelesse lye.
For what similitude hath our ministration of the communion, with their masse, any more, then our doctrine with theirs? If any thinge in ceremonies or discipline haue bene tollerated not altogether purged from all similitude of popish actions, by yelding vnto the infirmitie of the weaker sort: yet is the Church of God perfect in her selfe, and needeth not to borrow of any secte any thing, for her perfect furniture in doctrine, ceremonies, or discipline, but hath absolute rules to direct her in any of these expressed in the holy Scriptures.
For the diuision of parishes, the holding of Councells, excommunication, suspension, publike solemnising of mariage with the lawes of the same, punishing of heretikes by, death, &c. are all manifestly proued out of the Scriptures.
Probat of testaments and such like matters pertayne to the ciuill lawe.
And whereas Bristow sayth, we could not tell that we shoulde vse baptisinge of men, more then washinge of feete, or this lesse then that, or one to be a sacrament and not the other, except we had bene taught by the popishe Churche, it is a greate falshoode.
For althoughe we might alleage the iudgement of the moste auncient Churche of Christ, which did not accept that action of Christ as a sacraments yet the wordes of our Sauiour Christ are manifest, which doth not institute a sacrame~t or visible signe of the inuisible grace of God giuen vnto vs, but onely giueth vs an example thereby of seruice able humilitie one to an other.
Wherefore no more in this then in any other matter doe we take any light, out of the bookes and doings of those owles, that flye in the darkenes of mens traditions, but onely out of the lawe of God which is a light vnto our steps, and a lanterne vnto our feete, that we neede not like apes counterfeit externall toyes as they doe, but being followers of God as wellbeloued children, we may walke in loue as Christ hath loued vs, and so fare to followe the steppes of other men, as we see plainly that they haue followed Christ.
We confesse that we haue no states of perfection in this life amonge vs, which to affirme in any mortall man is blasphemye against the bloode of Christ.
As for Monkes and Fryers names, Eremites, &c: none were farther from a Christian or honest life then they, as the worlde knoweth sufficientlye.
And therefore by lawe they and their Monasteries were iustly subuerted.
As for the solitarye men of the auncient tymes, dwelling by them selues, or in the desert places called Mnach, Anchoritae or Eremite, these popishe orders, of whose subuersion Bristow complayneth, were no more like vnto them, then Apes and Monkeyes are to men and women.
The communitye of goodes that was in the Church of the Apostles.
was none other, then suche as is and ought to be amonge all true Christians.
which was not as Bristowe ignorauntlye and impudently affirmeth, to liue without propriety of goodes, hauing all thinges in an Anabaptisticall communitie, but that they accompted nothing of that they possessed to be their owne, when the necessitie of their brethren required the vse therof.
Peter affirmeth that both the lande and the price thereof was in the proprietye of Ananias, so that he might haue retayned ether his land or the whole price thereof, but that he was an hypocrite and would beare the Churche in hande, that he had brought the whole price, when he withdrewe a parte thereof.
As for Virgines although there be fewer amongest vs, that boast of that profession, yet are there more both men and women which freely keepe their purpose of virginitie, then were amonge those popishe vowed cloystralls.
Prayer for the deade, the ground of building Christian monuments.
Vniuersities of heretikès and Catholikes, Protestants be ashamed of their fathers.
The demaund serueth to be contrary to the motiue, for in the motiue he confesseth, that we will not condemne our auncestors that haue dyed these many hundred yeares in popish ignorance, nor the auncient doctors which haue held some errors which the Papistes doe hold, but in the demaund he asketh, if all these are damned in hell, if not, then theirs is the true Church, those errors are truth.
aunswer we deale not with condemnation of men, for lacke of two causes, which make a Iudge, the one austeritie, the other is knowledge.
Concerning the first, it pertayneth onely to Christ, to be the Iudge of the quicke and the deade, whose office we dare not vsurpe, otherwise then he hath commaunded vs, to pronounce sentence out of his word: concerning the latter, we take not vpon vs to knowe ether the faith or repentance of them that dyed before our time, and therefore we commit their iudgement to God.
But generally we are taught by the Scriptures, that such as holde the onely foundation which is Iesus Christ, in a true faith, shall be saued although they build vpon this foundation chaffe, straw, wood, &c.
And therefore we doubt not but S. Augustine, Chrysostom, Hierom, Gregory, Bernard, many thowsands, euen in the tyme of great blindnes, holding the same only foundation, may be saued, notwithstanding the chaffe and stubble of a few errors which the former sort did hold, or a number of errors and superstitions wherewith the later sort were defiled.
As for Fraunces and Dominike such late leaders of the locustes, we rather thinke they are returned into the bottomlesse pit from whence they came, then that they be Saincts in heauen.
But if we excuse the rest by ignorance, Bristow asketh why we condemne not Augustine, which was not ignoraunt of our doctrine, because he condemned it for most wicked heresie in Aerius, Iouinian and Vigilantius, who although they be our fathers, he sayth we are ashamed to blesse their memorie.
First concerning Iouinian, although he helde an heresie, in not preferring virginitie before mariage in some respect, yet haue we nothing to doe with him, for we hold not that opinion, which if we did yet were it no damnable heresy.
Touching AErius he is co~demned of Augustine for an Arrian, his opinio~ of prayer for the deade although it were not liked of Augustine, yet doth he in no place condemne it for most wicked heresie, as Bristow calleth it, but that he did allowe prayer for the deade, it was an error of ignoraunce, euen in S. Augustine, as that he thought the communion necessary for infants.
As for Vigilantius finde him not reckened ether by Epiphanius or Augustine for an heretike, or for one that erred in doctrine, although Hierom did write so bitterly against him, who likewise did write against Augustine and Ruffinus, yet are nether of both accompted for heretikes.
And AErius as he helde some truth with vs against prayer for the deade, so helde he also much popishe superstition and errour, for like the order of Carthusians, they of his sect admitted none to their felowship, but such as professed continence, so renounced the world, that they possessed nothing in proper.
And Philaster affirmeth, that they absteyned also from cating of flesh.
So that all thinges considered, Aerius mainteyned the doctrine of the Papistes, as much as of the Protestantes.
That our preachers in pulpits, praise God for the founders of colledges and schooles, of learning, by name, what maketh this for allowance of their religion.
God is to be praised for such benefits as he hath bestowed vpon his church or any members thereof, euen by Turks and Heathen men.
For whether the founders were good or euill men, and what intent soeuer they had, their benefits are now vsed to the glory of God, therefore God for them and their benefits is greatly to be praised.
motiue hath neuer a demaund that can aptly referre vnto it.
The only knowne vndoubted mother of Christs children for a thousand yeares together.
The Popish church hath not only bene ye only known church and vndoubted mother of Christes children for these thousand yeares.
First because it is not of so many yeares continuaunce, the mysterie of iniquitie hauing not bene in highest degree of wickednesse before the councell of Constance, where notwithstanding the institution of Christ and the practise of the primitiue church, the communion of the Lordes bloud was taken from the people.
Secondly the Popish church was neuer acknowledged by all the true children of Christes church, for their mother, which was a steppemother and a persecuter of them.
Thirdly the Popish church was neuer ye only reputed church or mother of Christs children, of all them that professe Christianitie for the churches of the East, as great and as large as she was in the West, woulde neuer so accompt the Popish steppedame of Rome, but did separate them selues from her communion.
Fourthly the Catholike church of Christes members dispersed ouer all the world, vnder the tyranny both of the Turke the Pope, haue in all times protested, that ye Romish Apostolical synagoge, is the whore of Babylon and see of Antichrist.
which he citeth to proue that the church must be alwayes visible, you shall finde aunswered with many other in mine ouerthrow of Stapletons fortres lib.
And wheras Bristow confesseth, that a mist may hide an hil that is neuer so high, from some wicked sighted men that are without it, but neuer from them that are within it, no meruale if the spirituall church of Christ, being lifted vp aboue the top of all hills, not in worldly glory, but euen vnto heauenly dignitie, hath long remained hid from them, that haue no spirituall eyes at all.
But Bristow thinketh it strau~ge, that a mist should continue a thousand yeres together.
Then aske him what hath hindered the greatest parte of all the worlde, seduced by Mahometistrie and Gentilitie that for these thousand yeres they haue not seene the height of the Popish church.
If he say not a mist about their church but a blindnesse in the others eyes to be the cause, the same aunswere for the Catholike dispersed church of Christ, which the Papistes pretend that this thousand yeares they could not see.
Although as haue often sayd, Papistry is not halfe so olde in the greatest heresies and absurdities, which now she maynteyneth.
In the Popish churchis no celebration, but a derogation of the merite of Christs death, by the blasphemous sacrifice of the masse.
demaunde, asketh vs whether we be content to trie religion by the Priesthood that hath bene fro~; the beginning of Christs church.
answere that we must first consent of the name of Priest and Priesthoode, whereof also in the same demaunde he cauilleth, that we haue chaunged the name therefore haue chaunged the order.
The name say of Priesthood Priest must be co~sidered, either according to the Etymologie deriuation, or els according to the present vse thereof.
And according to the deriuation, we co~fesse yt this word Priest, co~ming of the greeke word Presbyteros signifieth the same oder, which is instituted by God, like as the word Bishop cmming of Episcopus, for which if any man vse the name of Elder superintendent, he varieth nothing in the worlde, from the signification of Presbyter and Episcopus, and much lesse setteth vp a new order as Bristow most vainly doth cauill.
For in that sence, we abhorre not the name of Priest Bishop.
But when according to the present vse, this word Priest is take~ for him which in greke is called [undefined span alphabet] and in Latine Sacerdos that is one appointed to offer a special sacrifice for which our English tongue hath none other worde but Priest as Bristow doth well confesse: In this sence we deny that we haue any speciall Priesthoode or Priestes among vs but the only Priesthoode and high Priest our Lorde and Sauiour Iesus Christ, and the generall Priesthoode that is common to all the Saynctes of God.
But in the former sence, we haue the same office of Bishoppe, Elder or Priest which being ordeyned by the holy Ghost, hath continewed in the church vntill this time.
First that auncient Bishoppes and Priestes were made by Bishoppès and Priestes, and not by Kinges and Queenes: secondly they were made to offer sacrifice, and euen for the deade.
Concerning the first it is true that the auncient Priestes were so ordeyned, but it is a most impudent slaunder, that we are made Bishoppes or Priests by Kinges or Queenes.
For the worlde knoweth we are ordeyned by the Bishoppes and Elders of the church and not by the Prince.
But that the auncient Bishoppes and Elders of the church since Christ, were ordeyned to offer sacrifice for the quicke and the dead, it is vtterly false.
For albeit the auncient writers vnproperly vsed the names of Priest and sacrifice, yet did they neuer meane to set vp a newe Priesthoode or sacrifice, to ouerthrowe the only true Priesthode and sacrifice of Christes death as in many places of their writinges most manifestly doth appeare, but only they did continew a memory of the sacrifice of Christes death in the celebration of the Lordes supper Chris.
Hoc est sacrificium Christianorum multi vnum corpus sumus in Christo: quod etiam Sacramento altaris fidelibus noto frequentat ecclesia, vbi ei demonstratur quod in ea oblatione quam offrt ipsa offeratur.
This (sayth Augustine speaking of the sacrifice of thankesgeuing) is the sacrifice of Christians, we being many are one bodie in Christ, which thing also the church frequenteth in the Sacrament of the altar well knowne to the faithfull, where it is shewed vnto her, that in the same oblation which she offereth, she her selfe is offered.
Cuius rei sacramentum quotidianum esse voluit ecclesiae sacrificium, cum ipsius corporis ipse sit caput, ipsius capitis ipsa sit corpus, tam ipsa per ipsum quam ipse per ipsam suetus offerri.
By this also he is a Priest, he him selfe offering and he him selfe being the oblation.
Of which thing he would haue the dayly sacrifice of the church to be a Sacrament, seeing that of her beinge his bodie he is the heade, and of him being her heade she is the bodie, as well she by him, as he by her, being accustomed to be offered.
So that the errour of praying for the deade which preuayled within three hundreth yeares after Christ, was at the first, without blasphemie of sacrificing the bodye of Christ for the quicke and the deade.
In this foure and twentie demaunde Bristowe as keth further whether in the auncient Church there were not Subdeacons, Acolytes, Exorcistes, dore keepers &c.
aunswere there were such offices, appoynted for ayde of diuerse partes of the ministerie, whereof the Papistes reteyne only the names, without any exercise of the offices.
And the offices were suche for the most parte, as were proper for the tyme of persecution, and as they had no instruction of the worde of God but were ordeyned by the Church, so by the Church they are thought vnnecessarie.
In the forty eight demaunde which is a parte of this motiue, he asketh whether their Church only hath not grace in her Sacramentes, merite in her workers, force in her worde, power in her teaching, her children the saddest sorte of people, men of best order in families, townes, and cities, &c.
aunswere, the Popish Church hath no Sacraments but such as she falsely vsurpeth, namely the Sacrament of baptisme, which as Augustine sayth against the Donatistes, may be geuen out of the true Church, but hath no vertue or grace but in the true Church.
As for merite of workes is blasphemous agaynste the mercie of God.
Whence shoulde haue so great merite seeing mercie is my crowne.
And touching force of her worde and power of her teaching, if there were not greater terrour of her tyrannie and allurement in her worldly glorie she shoulde haue fewer partakers.
For except the efficacie of errour which God hath sent for the punishment of the vnbeleeuing worlde, she hath no power of the worde of God, nor of his holy spirite, to conuert the hearts of men to Christe, but externall intisements like Mermaydes songes, to seduce men to their destruction.
And as for her Children the Papists, although some bee more modest then the reste, as ther be euen among the Turkes and Heathen, none ate more light, vaine, disordered, proude, proude, deceitfull, couetous, worldly, luxurious, malicious, and cruell, not onely at Rome, and abrode, where they bee in their ruffe, but euen heere in Englande, where they haue not all their will.
except a fewe, which beeing deceiued, not of malice but of ignoraunce, God in time may bring to the knowledge of the trueth, if they be not dissemblers and seeke by all meanes to absent themselues from it.
Furthermore how maliciously he slaundereth the Church of God let God himselfe reuenge, where hee sayth, we haue no preaching of Penaunce, no grace in sacramentes, nothing but sinne in good woorkes, although they be doone in Christe.
No power to bringe vnder Deuils, no blessing, no comforte, yea that all followers bee they neuer so wicked and flagitious, haue they onely fayth and no doubte, they shall bee saued.
And yet the forgetfull Lyer confesseth afterwarde, that wee affirme that true fayth cannot bee without true and perfect doctrine, nor without good woorkes.
But what Fayth doe you preach or teach (sayth Bristowe) Not that Christian fayth which is conteyned in the Articles of our Creede, but a speciall Fayth, or an vudoubted perswasion that hee is predestinate.
How soeuer therefore it bee that Bristowe is disposed for to lye and rayle, they that either heare our Sermons or reade our Bookes of Iustification by Faith onely, doe knowe that wee teach none other Faith by which a manne may bee iustifyed, but euen that Faith, which is onely contayned in the Articles of our Creede.
The very firste woorde whereof beleue, teacheth not the implicite faith of the papists, but a speciall and singular faith and truste that euerye Christian man must haue in God the father and in Iesus Christ, which was conceiued, borne, deade, risen againe, &c. for vs, and in the holy Ghoste, by whome the vertue of Christes conception, natiuirie, suffring, death, resurrection, and assention, is communicated to vs, beeing members of the Catholike church, in which we receiue forgiuenes of sinnes, and thereby beeing made righteous, wee receiue the rewarde of righteousnesse, which is the resurrection vnto glory, and the life euerlasting, which was prepared for vs before the world was made, which faith no blasphemous heretikes can haue, that deny any of these Articles, what perswasion soeuer they haue, wc faith the Papists haue not, which neuer put their trustin God by Iesus Christe, but in their owne woorkes &c, nor yet haue any certaintie of their saluation, whereas all they that truely put their trust in God, shall not be confounded.
From which faith the Papists are so farre, that they think it not conuenient that the people should know and rehearse the articles of the Creede in the mother toung, although nowe of late, they haue set foorth English cathechismes, as Apes of the true Church, not that their Disciples might haue more knowledge, seing they hold that ignorance is the mother of Deuotion, but that they see they cannot though for shame they would conceale this knowledge from them.
And when they cannot hinder them of the knoweledge of the Articles of faith, howe pray you doe they teach them to beleeue them? Euen with an historicall faith, which is none others then such as the deuill beleeueth, namely that there is one God, that Iesus Christe was borne, crucyfied, ascended into Heauen &c.
Demaunde he asketh vs whether we reade not that the Christians of the Primitiue church, had an ordinary power and office to cast out diuels, which we acknowledge that we haue not, but the Papistes haue.
To this aunswere, that in the Primitiue church were diuerse giftes of healing, casting out of Deuils working of miracles, which were temporall, and are long since ceased to be ordinary, and therefore wee doe in deede confesse that we haue no such ordinary power.
Neither doe we beleue that the papists haue any such, what iugling or counterfaiting of miracles soeuer is among them, their forgery hath to often beene tryed to their shame.
To conclude, our Church hath Christ and his spirit, and therefore all graces blessings whatsoeuer Christ hath promised to be perpetuall in the same, to the saluation of his elect and the glory of his name.
The doctrine of Purgatory and satisfaction of Gods wrath by workes of our owne or of other mens.
The doctrine of pardons, the doctrine of Grace giuen by sacraments, Exopere operato.
The sacrifice of the masse &c. are doctrines that teach the brode way leading vnto destruction, while they bring men into securitie and confidence in vaine helpes.
And that is the cause that Papists and Popes themselues of all other haue beene and are the most wicked.
The number of Atheists that are in England are not made, but discerned by the preaching of the Gospel.
And yet neither are there so many nor so impudent professors of Atheisme in England, as there be in Italie and euen in Rome it selfe.
Where the Pope hath beene condemned in generall councell for an Atheist, as Iohn the
Where Pope Leo counteth the Gospell for a fable of Christ.
Pope Iuly will eate hogges fleshe in despight of God.
The sinnes confesse of England are greate, and such as call to God for vengeance without heartie repentance, and the greatest sinne is ingratitude in the multitude, refusing sincerly to imbrace the Gospell, and in other hypocrisie which abusing the name of the Gospell, haue an outwarde shewe of godlynesse, but deny the power thereof.
Yet is there bothe in the state (whiche Bristowe moste traitorously doth slaunder) and in the Church of England, yea in the Realme of Englande, more sinceritie, fidelitie, honestie, Charitie, humilitie, Chastitie, and godlinesses, and lesse Athesme, infidelitie, crueltie, pride, ryote, whoredome, swearing and foswearing, Couetousnesse, sacriledge, and all manner of wickednesse, more say of vertue and lesse of vice in England at this time, then is or hath beene at any time with in those fiue hundred yeeres in Rome or Italie.
So that if a Booke were made as Bristow seemeth to threaten of the behauiour of the worst and moste counterfaite Protestantes in Englande, yet shall it neuer bee founde so vile and abhominable as are the lyues of the moste of the Popes themselues, set foorth not by Protestants in our dayes, but by all popish storyes before we were borne.
In what Church is Christianitie of all lawes which was Sainct Augustines Motiue.
Obedience of the Catholikes to their superiours bothe ecclesiastieall and temporall Protestantes be malignours of higher powers.
If this Motiue had beene sette foorth before the Rebellion in the North, or if so many trayterouse practises from Rome hadd not beene openly discouered peraduenture Bristowe might haue moued some mountaines by it.
But nowe Quis tulerit Gracchum de seditioue loquentm? Who canne abide the Papistes to bragge of Obedience? Yet both the ciuill Lawe and the common Lawe of Englande are made to serue popishe Religion, if wee will beleeue Bristowe.
God bee thanked they bothe serue the Church of God not onely in Englande, but in all other Realmes and states that haue embraced the Gospell, the ciuill and municipall Lawes, without any alteration of the state, saue for the aduancement of Gods glory.
But Protestants hee sayth, bee Maligners of the higher powers, such as Sainct Iude calleth contemners of Lordeshippe, and blasphemers of Maiestie.
Or else the Papistes be such in that blasphemouse Bull, for which Felton was hanged, in which are so vile opprobrious and contumelious slanders of our Prince, that for her honour and my dueties sake, will not vouchsafe to name them.
Hee obiecteth vnto vs Knoxes Booke against the regement of women, which was but his priuate opinion and condemned of all our Church, and of the Churche of Geneua also.
Hee obiecteth the ciuill warres in Fraunce, in which the Kinges themselues haue alwayes in publique instrumentes discharged the Protestants of all disloyaltie, and acknowledged that whatsoeuer they did in taking Armes, they did it in the seruice of them and of their Realme.
As for the murdering of great Personages, Wasting of Cities and Countries &c. the worlde knoweth whether partie is chargeable with the crime.
And to seeke no farther proues of the trayterous and disobedient heartes of all wicked and pernitiouse Papistes, Bristow him selfe confesseth in this motiue, that they be duely discharged from subiection and the Prince from dominion by the soueraigne authoritie of the common Paster of Religion.
But where in the Deuils name, hath your soueraigne Pastor and Prelate of Rome, such authoritie? From Peter? Did Peter discharge the subiectes of Nero from subiection, or Nero from his gouernment, although he were a moste wicked persecutor of the Church, or rather doth he not commaund all persons to obey him.
trayterous hypocrites, which haue made all whole, whe~ you pray for the Princes conuersion, so deposed by your Pope.
The Lord our God defende our soueraigne, as well from your prayers as from your practises.
Another argument of your obedience, you shew, where you saye, that of Catholikes, throughly discharged of their fealtic, yet for common humanitie, for their accustomed vse, for their co~tinuall (as it were) naturall institution, the prince is better obeyed and scrued, then of the Protestants, which in heart are in a manner all Puritants.
Note heere that Papists professe them selues to be subiects of curtesie, not of dutie, of custome, not of conscience, of naturall institution, not of the lawe of God.
Our Lord and sauiour send her maiestie few such subiects and seruants.
The true Catholike church of Christ, is that church of which it was prophecied, that Kinges and Queenes shoulde be the nurse thereof, and as obedient children doe homage thereto, as to the mother of all the faithfull.
To this church the olde and first Christianed Emperours, Constantius, Iouianus, Theodosius, Valentinianus &c. submitted them selues as obedient children.
To this church at this day many Kinges and Queenes doe homage, and are nurses thereof, as the Princes of England, Scotland, Denmarke, Sueuon, Saxonie.
But Bristow obiecteth against vs, yt our Princes are not taught obedience to the Church, but truely seduced by the title of heade and supreme gouernours of the Church.
To this aunswere that this title of headshippe and gouernaunce of particular Churches, is none other, but such as they may and ought to holde, with their obedience vnto the vniuersall Church.
Yea their gouernment is such, as therein they serue God and the Church, in compelling by lawe and authoritie, all persons to doe their duties as well in religion, as in ciuill affayres: Not an antichristian tyranny, such as the Pope vsurpeth to be Lords ouer our faith, and to make Articles of Religion at their pleasure, but to prouide that all thinges may be doone according to the word of God.
But Bristow replyeth that it was not the Popish church vnto whome Constantine and the rest of the Christian Emperours yeelded vp the imperiall Cittie of Rome, with all the countrie of Italie.
What an impudent lye this is, may easely be knowen of all them, which haue read the historyes which testifie that the Emperors of Constantinople receiued possession in Rome and Italy vntill the time of Charles the great, which was made Emperour by the Pope.
In the demaunde Bristowe asketh if the first Christian Emperonrs, Constantinus, Theodosius, were not in all pointes of the popishe Religion? answere that although they were infected with a few errors, as prayer for the deade &c, yet in the substance of Christian Religion, they beleeued the same that wee beleeue of Iustification by faith, onely of the vertue of Christes sacrifice once offred for all, of the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, and were enemies to the Papistes in their chiefe Principle, of the Popes supremacie, the carnall presence, transubstantiation, priuate Masse, Communion in one kinde, Images, Prayers in vnknowen language, and many other.
As for the lycence that Bristowe woulde haue vs procure for them, to appeare with vs before the Queenes highnesse, to dispute whether the firste Christian Emperors were not altogither Papists? is nothing else but a popishe bragge, whiche if it were procured they would delude the whole purpose with such Cauillations, as they did in the Conference offered vnto them at Westminster, in the firste yeere of her Maiesties raigne: where after they had hearde our side once reade their Booke, they were so discouraged, that they durst abide no more tryall, but shamefully and obstiantely cleane gaue ouer the conference.
Yea Christe, Peter and Paule and other Apostles excluded out of Englande by Parliament.
Howe Sainct Augustine should be vsed in England by the Parliament lawe if he were there liuing.
Wee must consider (sayth Bristowe) what Church that is, where Lawes be made to charge Peter if hee were liuing, to giue vppe his commission receiued of Christ, and to take another of the Kinge or Queene, and to charge him and his fellowe Apostles to leaue the true seruice which they had receiued, and to minister after an other sorte, as the Paliament lawe prescribeth.
To this aunswere, we will bee tryed by the writinges of Peter and his fellow Apostles, that the Parliament lawe for Religion and seruice of God, concernig the substance thereof vrgeth not Peter to chaunge his commission, nor to vse any other seruice then they them selues haue taught vs to vse.
If Augustine were aliue and in Englande, hee was a man of such modestie and loue of the trueth, that seeing the same plainly reuealed out of the holy Scriptures, hee woulde retracte his errour of Prayer for the deade, as when hee lyued hee retracted and sette foorth manye thinges, wherein he founde that he hadde erred.
As for the fine of an hundred Markes, he woulde not haue lefte nor beene depriued of his Byshoprike and imprysoned for saying of the popishe Masse, for hee neuer sayde any in his life, but was an vtter enemye to the chiefe poyntes thereof, allowing nothing therof but prayer for the deade at the celebration of the Lords supper.
And for as our Sauiour Iesus Christ, the King of all Kinges and Lorde of all Lordes, and the onely ruler of Heauen and earth, doe you thinke that hee wyll not complaine that hee onely by Parliament lawe is acknoweledged to bee the heade of his vniuersall Church, and so continually present therewith by his holy spirit, that he neede no viear generall of a mortall manne, which canne occupye but one place, although he were neuer so diligent and painfull to discharge his dutie in that behalfe.
For his diuine and spirituall authoritie, is not excluded vnder the name of forraine power, as Bristowe not more slaunderously then ridiculously affirmeth.
Yet hee pleaseth him selfe so much in so greate folly and madnesse, that hee sayth, Christe coulde not clayme to be heade of his Church, excepte he should clayme to be the naturall Kinge of Englande, and to haue sayde vnto Pylate, My kingdome is of this world and thy maister Caesar doth me wronge.
As though the King of Englande, by title of his royall power, clayming to be the chiefe Seruaunte or deputie of Christe, in gouerning his Churche according to his worde, did exclude the soueraignitie of Christe which he hath ouer his Church and elect, wheresoeuer they are vpon the face of the earth.
But the Protestantes (sayth Bristowe) are contrary to them selues while they say that our Prince is Kinge of France aswel as of England and Ireland yet say not that he is hede of the Church of Fraunce, but onely of the Church of England and Irelande.
And is Bristowe such a profound Logitian that he cannot distinguishe a Kinge in right onely, from a King in actuall gouerment.
If our Prince had as good possession of the gonernmente of Fraunce, as hee hath title of right to haue it, hee shall be gouernour of the Church of Fraunce, as well as of the Church of Englande and Ireland.
That hee sayth we haue beene from hence at the Apostles going so long a iorney without any footing, in the way, it is a foolish cauel for wee haue often shewed succession of doctune, euen from the Apostles from whome it is receiued.
Sainct Paule might not write ad Anglos for the Palament.
The Church of Englande is not so straythened or pinched within the lymites of one Kingdombut that she beleeueth and inioyeth the communion of all the Sainctes of God, as a member of the vniuersal church of Christe.
And therefore meruail what collour Bristowe hath for those slaunders: that one Christian man in Englande in spirituall affayres is a straunger to another, that generall Councels haue no authoritie in it, that Sainct Paule or all the Apostles if they were lyuing might not write to the Englishmen aswell as to the Romaines, Galathians, Corinthians &c. that Christe without the consente of the Kinge and the Parliament might not dispose his owne Church.
These vaine and impossible suppositions, could not come but from a grosse and foolish inuention of one that lacketh argumentes to proue his cause.
The lawes are made according to that which is, namely the trueth, set foorth in the holy Scriptures, not according to that which euery foole will fondly suppose or imagine.
VVhat Religion the Iowes impunge as the Religion of Christ.
Christ is to bee beleeued for conuerting of Emperours and powers from their Idols to serue his seruauntes.
Emperors turned from their Idols and praying at Peeters sepulchre, and the Christianitie of humane lawes.
Sainct Augustine of our Religion, Protestants bee of many olde heresies.
The popish Church was not persecuted by the heathen Emperous, but the Catholike church of Christ, The popish Church is not of so great antiquitie, that shee had then any shewe in the worlde, although the misterie of iniquitie did then woorke and euen in the Apostles time.
The Heathens, Turks and Iewes, doe no more hate the popish church; then they doe the church of God which is in England.
The warres against the Turke be at this day maintained by the states of Germany, which are of our religio~ aswel as by the Papists, That there is no publike ayde sent against the Turk out of England, it is not in any allowaunce of Turkish religion but because the state seeth it not necessary neither was there any publike ayde sente an hundreth yeeres be ore the reuolte from Papistrie.
And yet euen in the Queenes maiesties raigne, there hath gone ayde out of England against Soliman which died at the siege of Segesto, where diuers noble Gentlemen of Englande goinge on their owne charges as Bizia testifieth wan more true glory then they that
hundred yeeres before vpon a superstitious vowe were signed with the crosse to fight against the Saracens, for the possession of the earthly Ierusalem.
How often shall aunswer, that the first christian Emperours were not conuerted from Idolatry to Christianitie by the popish Church, but the later Christian Emperours, by her haue bene peruerted from the true worship of God, vnto Idolatry.
That the Emperours being conuerted from Idolatry, did pray at Peter the fishermans sepulchre (as Augustine sayth) it sheweth the vertue of ye Gospel of Christ that had made so great alteration in them, but nothing at all proueth the authoritie or any error of the popish Church, for Augustine sayth not that they prayed vnto Peter, but at the sepulcher of Peter, meaning in the Church that was builded vpon the place, that was supposed to be the buriall of Peter.
The lawes that those Emperours made against Idolaters, may well serue against the Papistes, wc are as grosse in all kindes of Idolatry as the Gentills for the most part were.
Finally it was not ye popish Church, but the Church of Christ, that suppressed the heresies of the Arrians, Sabellians, Nestorians &c.
But Iouinian did let out of hell Priestes and Nunnes mariage, which gate not the Church of Protestantes, but our Church (sayth Bristow) hath stopped.
The Church that striued against Iouinian, was nether for mariage of Priestes, of whom many thowsands were maryed in that tyme, yea and a thowsande yeares after, nor yet for mariage of such as had vowed virginitie, and could not contayne, when both Epiphanius the hatchet of heresies, and Hierome that greatest aduersary of Iouinian, agree that they ought to marye.
Nether were Epiphanius, Philaster, and Augustine, which disalow the opinion of Aerius, concerning prayers for the dead, members of the popish church, for this one error which they held, seeing they hold the principall substance of religion against the Papists, and agreeable to the word of God.
That Bristow sayth in the demaund, VVe count Turkes, Iewes, and very Atheistes for our frendes and all that be not Papistes, it is a most detestable slaunder.
The Anabaptistes burned in Smithfield were no Papistes, the blasphemer of Christ lately burned at Norwiche was no Papist, whose sharpe execution sheweth, that heretikes, blasphemers, and Atheistes, when they are discouered, finde no friendship at the handes of Christes Church, but such as they deserue.
Finally the Easterne Church, which of long tyme hath bene separated from the Romish communion, hath as great enemies of the Turkes, heathen and Iewes, as the Popish Church hath, yet will not the Papistes allow it for the Catholike Church.
Here is nothing but the old popish bragge of vniuersalitie, antiquitie, and consent, which is as easily denied as it is allwayes alleaged without proofe.
Sauing that in the demaundes, they are sundered, as though euery one of them without the other two, were a sufficient triall of truth, which nether Vincentius nor Optatus, nor Augustine, nor any that vsed this argument did euer meane.
But that is truth, which being most auncient, hath at all tymes, of all true Christians, by general consent bene receyued.
But this can not be proued of any one error of poperye.
For if any of these three be omitted, the argument is of no force to proue truth.
All nations by generall consent embraced Idolatrie. yet was the true worship of God which was knowen onely in Iurye the more auncient.
The worship of Iupiter was more auncient, then the honor of Christ shewed in the flesh, and more vniuersally receyued, but not of the true worshippers of God.
As for generall councells, which in the demaund of consent, he sayth to be all against the Protestants, he is not able to shewe one approued generall councel, that was held within six hundreth yeares after Christ, that decreed any thing contrary to that which we beleue in any poynt.
But confessing that in many ages some there haue bene in some poyntes of our opinion, yet he sayth we can shewe no lyneall succession, but leape from Luther to Christ, without any recorde of our religion in all the meane tyme, hauing no monument of such Church nether in leafe or lyne of seruice booke: As one that loueth antiquities well, would fayne see, what leaues the Papistes can shewe of their seruice bookes, to proue a lyneall descnt from Christ to Pope Gregory the when Bristow sweareth perdie, to agree in all poyntes with Pope Leo the tenth, which was in Luthers tyme, some of their seruice being made by Thomas Aquinas, some by Fulbertus, some taken out of Beda, some out of Gregory, some out of Augustine, some out of Hieronyme, some out of Iohn Chrysostom, and of Ambrose, and the eldest thinke not of Origen: which argueth nether antiquitie nor vniuersalitie to stand with the popish seruice as for lyneall succession from Christ, it is vnpossible for them to shewe.
But Bristow wil proue, that we were neuer before this time.
For as for AErius, he knoweth we are ashamed of him.
But he will proue that nether Hus, nor Wicklefe were Protestants.
By the same reason he may proue, that the fathers of the councels of Constance and Basil were no Papists, because they tooke vpon them to depose Popes and decreed that the councell was aboue the Pope, which most Papistes at this day dare not affirme.
AEneas Syluius doth slaunder Wicklefe and Hus, that for euery mortall sinne a Magistrate should lose his office, for their Apologies are extant to be seene to the contrary.
But Luther (sayth he) denyeth that he was an Hussite, affirming that Hus was not of his opinio~.
Although he had bene in all poyntes of his opinion, as he was in the chiefe, yet might Luther iustly deny the name of a man, which is proper to sectaries as Franciscanes, Dominicanes &c, not to Christians.
How pray you? First that he found many errors in him, by which iudgement might be made of his spirite.
If Wicklefe liuing in a time of so great blindnes and darkenes, coulde not see the truth in all matters, it was no maruell, and that he had errors, he sheweth that he was a man, euen as the best writers of the Church since the Apostles tyme, which might be deceyued: But as we condemne not Augustine, Hierom, Chrysostom, Cyprian, and other auncient writers, because we know rhey erred in some things, no more haue we iust cause to cond emne Wicklefe for some errors which it is not vnlike, but he did holde, yea but Melanthon chargeth Wicklefe (sayth he) to be altogether ignoraunt of the righteousnes of faith, which is the foundation of religion.
will rather thinke that Melanthon was ignoraunt of Wicklefes opinion, as one which had not seene but fewe of his workes.
In which as perhaps he might vse the tearmes of merit and deseruing, then commonly vsed in his tyme, yet that he had not the same meaning in them, but did well vnderstand and holde the righteousnes which is of fayth, can playnely proue by his owne writings in diuerse places.
he sayth: Sith Christ is God and man, satisfaction for the sinne that he made thus freely, is better then any other that man or Angell might make.
The same man in nowmber that sinned in Adam our first fadir, the same man in nowmber made asseeth by the second Adam Christ.
And sith he is more of vertue then the first Adam might be, and his payne is much more then sinnefull lust of the first Adam, who shoulde haue conscience here, that ne this sinne is clansid all orst.
And sith our Iesu is very God that neuer man forfete this mede, he is a sufficient medicine for all sinners that bene contrite, for Christ is euer and euery where, and in all such soules by grace, and so he clanseth more cleanely then any bodye or figure may clense, and herefore as Poule sayth, Christ is mediator of the newe lawe, &c. Agayne vpon
Seeth mans thinking amonge his werkes, seemeth moste in his power, and yet his thought mote come of God, much more eche other werke of man &c.
Thus should we put of pride and wholly trusten in Iesu Christ, for he that may not thinke of him selfe, may doe nought of him selfe, but all our sufficiencie is of God by the meane of Iesu Christ.
Sith God susteyneth man and moueth him and helpeth him for to trauell, how had it not come of grace, and thus reward of this trauell mote needes all come of grace.
These places and many other shewe that Wicklefe was not ignorant of the righteousnes of fayth.
It seemeth therefore that Melancthon had seene only the articles which his aduersaries had gathered against him, and not his owne writings and discourses.
The prophecyes, which Bristow boasteth to be for their religion, be of Ieremye and Esay, for the perpetuall continuance of the true Church of Christ, but seing it is proued that the popish Church hath not bene from the beginning, those prophecyes appertayne not vnto her.
motiue whereunto adde, that while the Papistes glory of a visible Church on earth, Ierusalem that is aboue, and therefore not subiect to the eyes of earthly men, but of such whose conuetsation is in heauen, is the mother of vs all.
Finally if Bristow coulde as truly proue, as he doth boldly say, that no Scripture is against them, but all for them, he shoulde haue no Protestants to be his aduersaries, who more accept of the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, then of all other motiues in the world.
Such seedes of our doctrine (sayth Bristowe) as haue growne before this time, did alwayes growe in euell grounde, namely in heretikes as denyall of prayer for the deade in Aerius, who beside that errour was an Arrian.
He chargeth vs also with denying the ordinarie fast of the church, but that is false.
For we hold that the fast which is appointed by the church, ought to be obserued, although we hold that no man is bounde to the blasphemous, superstitious, and counterfait fast of the Popish synagogue.
In that time in which Aerius liued, there were other times of fasting appointed, then such as the Popishe church obserueth.
But the wedsnesday fast (sayth Bristowe) the church hath released.
In what generall councell good Sir: are you able to shewe: likewise of other times of fast named in Epiphanius? if you be not able to shew this where is either your vniuersalitie, antiquitie, or succession in doctrine and discipline, without interruption.
More the~ this (sayth he) Aerius did hold, that a Bishop a Priest be equall, which also the Protesta~ts do mainteyne.
S. Hierom Euagrio is of the same opinion that they are equall likewise in Epistad Titum. cap.
shewing that a Bishoppe is preferred before a Priest magis ecclesiae consuetudine quam dispositionis dominicae veritate rather by custome of the church to auoyde schismes, then by truth of the Lordes disposition.
Furthermore one of the Protestantes seedes is, that we must not pray to Saints, but this was held of certayne heretikes in S. Bernardes time who were called Apostolici were also Anabaptistes, denying the baptisme of infantes.
The conclusion is, that these opinions can not be good, because they are founde in some heretikes.
And the contrary opinion must needes be true, because they are found in some holy men, as in S. Athanasius, Epiphanius, Augustine. &c.
Although these opinions are but fewe in comparison of so many articles of religion, in whiche we dissent from the Papistes, which if they coulde be founde in heretikes, we should soone heare of them: yet what Logike is in this conclusion of Bristow, you shall see by examples of the like, and euen of the same heretikes.
Aerius, as Augustine reporteth out of Philastre, did also receiue into his felowship none but suche as wete continent, and had so renounced the worlde, that they possessed nothing in common, likewise they abstayned from fleshe.
The very same doth Bernarde report of the heretikes called Apostolike, that they rereuerenced mariage, and abstayned from all flesh and whitemeates.
This diuelishe seede prophecied before to be the note of Antichristian hypocrites, grew in many heretikes before the time of the Papistes, and not these only, but many other also.
The superstitious estimacion of the crosse in the Valentinians Epiph.
Transubstantiation of the wine into blood in Marcus and the Marcosians Ireaeus lib. cap.
Tert. de Monon. de Anima. &c. Inuocation of Angells in the Caianites and many other Popishe plantes were first sowne by the deuill in elder heretikes.
And yet were this no good argument to confute these opinions or errors, because they are founde in heretikes, except they were found to be contrarie to the word of God.
All is no heresie, whatsoeuer an heretike hath affirmed, for there was neuer heretike, but affirmed much truth, neither is all truth that is affirmed by euery Sainct and holy man, for not one of the ancient writers but is acknowledged to haue affirmed some vntruth.
Only the holy Scripture ought to haue this preheminence, as Augustine sayth, that it may iudge of all sayings and writings, it selfe being iudged of none, because it is the word of God which can not erre or be deceaued.
But Bristowe hath Scripture to proue that he which denyeth prayer for the dead, being found among the Arrians Anabaptists, can not choose but be bou~d in bundells with them and cast into the fire.
In deede he that is an Arrian or Anabaptist shal not escape for denying prayer for the deade.
But the Angells that are the reapers, are not so vnskilfull, but that they can discerne true Christians denying the abuse of prayers for the dead, which the Scripture doth not admit, from blasphemous heretikes, among a great number of falsehoodes affirming some truth.
But it is a sore matter, that he sayth, The verie worst sorte of heretikes of this time, as the Anabaptistes, Trinitaries, yea the verie Epicures and Atheistes, were first Protestantes, ye such they be and will seeme to be still.
He had spoken more truly, if he had sayd they were first Papistes.
But what heretikes and Atheistes woulde seeme to be, it is no dishonor to our cause, seeing all hypocrits would seeme to be true Christians.
That only Papistes are troubled in our countrie, and all other sectes tollerated and mainteyned the publike execution and punishment of Anabaptistes and other blasphemous sectes as the Familie of Loue &c. doth playnly proue to be false, and Bristow to be a shamelesse slaunderer.
neede not to shewe, how often and how vainly Bristowe repeateth one thing, to make a great number of motiues.
The euerlasting continuaunce of the true church hath bene seuen times at least before alleaged.
But neither is it proued that the Popish church is that true church, nor yet that any sect or companie which shall continewe to the ende of the worlde is the Catholike church of Christ.
For although Antichrist is and shall be more and more consumed with the breath of the Lordes mouth, which is his holie worde yet shall he not be altogether abolished vntill the ende of the worlde.
Yea at the ende of the worlde, as our Sauiour Christ sayeth, fayth shall be verie scant, and hard to be founde, and iniquitie shall haue the vpper hande.
Therefore there shall be a great church of malignant hypocrytes euen to the ende of the worlde.
It is true therefore, that Christes church is sure to continewe but not whatsoeuer sect shall continew, is thereby proued to be Christes true church.
How vayne his bragge is, that Protestantes doe decaye: and shall come to nothing, by their dayly increase in all partes of the world, God be thanked may be seene to all men.
Likewise how true it is, which he affirmeth that Papistes doe increase, and to such numbers euen in Englande that there are more Papistes nowe, then when the Gospell was first preached, (notwithstandinge so many yeares preaching of vs and large silence of them) who liuing in Englande can be ignoraunt? confesse there are too many obstinate Papistes in Englande whome none of Bristowes motiues, hath either moued vnto Poperie, or confirmed therein, but onely great tolleration and lenitie which is vsed in these times.
But if such seueritie were vsed nowe, as in times past, the Pope shoulde not haue many confessors in Englande to glorie of.
And to say the truth, what one of these Papistes, dare professe what he thinketh of the Popes auctoritie, because the lawe is somewhat sharpe in that poynt.
If the like lawe were of hearing masse we should haue as fewe suffer for masse as for the supremacie.
But to returne to our motiue S. Augustine doth well to send Honoratus the Manichee to followe that way of Catholike doctrine which from Christ him selfe by the Apopostles is descended vnto vs, and from hence to posteritie shall descende.
But that it is not the way of all Popish doctrine which neuer came from Christ, nor his Apostles, nor the most auncient church.
And if the tradition be vncerteyne, how shall we know what came from Christ and his Apostles, but that which we finde in the Gospell of Christ and the Epistles of his Apostles.
But the same Augustine (sayeth Bristow) biddeth the simple Donatistes to Number the Priestes euen from the verie seate of Peter, and in that order of fathers see, who to whom succeeded.
That same is the rocke which the prowde gates of Hell doe not ouercome P. S. contra Donatistas.
Augustine speaketh of the Catholike church, which was the vine, whereof the Church of Rome at that tyme was but a growing braunch.
For a litle before he sayth, Scitis Catholica quid sit, quid sit precisum a vite.
You knowe what the Catholike church is, and what is that which is cut of from the vine.
But if Bristowe shoulde vrge the seate of Peter to be called of Augustine the rocke, Augustine in his retractations confesseth that he oftentimes hath expounded the rocke to be Christ, and so will not abide by that former exposition Retract. lib.
Neither did Augustine euer meane that the see of Peter at Rome was a rocke in such sorte, that none that euer should sit there, coulde erre, for he him selfe, with the rest of the fathers of the councell of Carthage withstood ye Bishop of Rome, claiming iurisdictio~ in Africa by coullour of a cou~terfet decree of the councell of Nice.
what shoulde heere repeate Pope Honorius condemned for an heretike, not only in the generall councell of Constantinople the
If the gates of hell preuayled not manifestly against that seate, yea and so many other Bishoppes thereof, whom they them selues confesse to be damned in hell for their wicked life: we neede not greatly be affrayed of the gates of hell.
Yea (sayth Bristow) It hath bene impugned ten thousand times more then any other, but all in vayne, frustra circumlatrantibus haereticis sayth S. Augustine.
In vayne is the barking of heretikes all about it.
But the place of Augustine which he citeth, is of the Church of Christ and not of Peters seate, round about the which, the heretikes haue barked in vaine.
For euen in that seate, but yet out of the Church, Liberius had barked Arrianisme, Marcellus gentilisme, and after his time Honorius barked with the Monothelits as his epistle which remayned after his death declared.
Vigilius also by his epistle was proued to barke Euty chianisme, Liberat. cap.
barked with the Sadduces against the resurrection of the dead, cont.
The see of Rome therefore is no more the rocke against which the gates of hell shall not preuaile, then the see of Canterbury or London.
But sayth Bristowe who can saye that there shall be alwayes a Byshoppe of Canterburye or London? Verely, no more can any man saye, that there shall alwayes bee a Byshop of Rome.
And whosoeuer sayth, that there hath beene alwayes since Peter a Byshop of Rome, shall lye moste impudently.
For the See hath often lyn voyde, not onely for a short time, while a newe Byshop might be chosen: but many yeers togither.
Againe the See hath beene translated from Rome to Auinion, and the Popes Court kepte there for threescore yeeres togither by which it is manifest both that the Citie of Rome hah not beene the perpetuall See of Peters successours, and that Peters successors haue erred in remouing their Courte from that Citie, which Peter chose to be heade of the worlde and Constantine gaue (as they say) to be the head of the church, which might haue forborne so great a gift like as Peter also might haue spared his trauell in remouing his see from Antioch to Rome, if they coulde haue foreseene that the Popes court might haue bene kept as well in Fraunce, as in Italie, at Auinion as at Rome.
But Luther is charged to be a false Prophet, for that he sayth in his booke against King Henry, That he was sure that he had his doctrines from heaue~.
That his doctrine should stand and the Pope should fall.
That God should see whether first be wery and faile, the Pope or Luther.
The note of a false Prophet in Deu. is to geue a signe which doth not follow, so hath Luther doone sayth Bristow.
For Zwinglius hath ouercome Luther Caluine Zwinglius and the Puritans the Protestants in England.
To this aunswere, that Luther doth not take vpon him to foreshew things to come by any speciall reuelatio~, but only affirmeth that his doctrine in as much as it is agreable to the word of God, is from heauen, shall continewe, whereas the Popes doctrine being the doctrine of the deuill shall come to naught.
And in this victorie, (if he please so to tearme it) hath not the Pope loste by preuayling of Zwinglius and Caluine.
And was that opinion of Luther which they haue impugned, meane of the carnall presence Luthers or the Popes? But whereas ye slanderous hypocrite, would make men think, that Caluine hath opposed himselfe against the doctrine of Zwinglius, the co~sent of the churches of Heluetia wt them of Sabaudia being publikely set forth to the worlde, doth openly testifie the contrarie.
Also the contention of those whom he calleth Puritanes in Englande, is not so great, nor about so great matters, that any such diuision is to be feared, which might cause desolation of the kingdome.
motiue, that the Protestantes of England be in a manner all in heart Puritanes, whereby he confesseth against him selfe, that there can be no deadly contention betwene them, that in heart are all one.
How to make playne demonstration that the heretikes haue no euidence that we haue all.
The inconstancy of the Protestants: The vnderstanding of the Scriptures is in the church.
This wise demonstration is a playne declaration, that he which made it, knoweth not what a demonstration meaneth, but such as it is, let vs see what is in it.
First he would haue it proponed by a Catholike, to his frend that is in heretike, to be considered, seing al these motiues beginning with holy Scripture, approued traditions &c. be for them agai st vs, what is the cause that we cry so shamelesly deceitfully the Gospel, the word of the Lorde, the touchstone of Gods booke? And least we shoulde say, that he beginneth with a false supposed shameful begging of the principle, he will proue that all these euidences are for them, and so must the heretike that you wil deale withall be made in the beginning to co~fesse, Yea Sir, but howe will you driue him to this confession? Forsooth sayth Bristow, they all confesse it many wayes indirectly.
First in that they vse not the same euidences them selues, in their declarations.
Secondly in that they admit no euidence but only Scripture.
To the first answere they vse as much of this euidence, as is good agreable to the holy Scripture.
To the second say, that if only Scripture be on our side it is more then all the rest against the Scripture, and againe if only Scripture be on ourside, then al the motiues be not on their side, for Scripture is one of them, the
But the Papist must make his frend say as much directly or els say expressely to euery one of them whether he will be tried by them.
As a frende to the presones, though an enemie to the errours of such Papistes as are curarable.
haue sayd expressely and particularly to euerie one of them, sheweing whether it be a true and proper note of the church, and if it be, that it belongeth to vs and not to them.
Although Bristow say, that this way we know full well that they shall haue the victorie flying therefore euermore to our weake false castle of only Scripture.
That the scripture onely is our castle, we do gladly admitte, but that the same is a most strong true impugnable castle, none but a blasphemous heretike will deny.
But you must (saith Bristow) still labour to get them (& if you can) with their consent, out of the castle into the plaine fieldes aforesayde, to make them graunt expressely that there in your handes they can not stande.
Nay Bristow you must beate vs from our castell if you can, for we will neuer consent to goe out of it for defense, except it be to offer you the aduauntage, not in the playne fieldes as you cal it, but among your pettie piles and small holdes.
So did that reuerende father the Bishoppe of Salisburie, in that noble challenge wherein you were shamefullie foyled in your owne grounde and many of your fortes beaten about your eares.
But you doe not well to teach your schollers to seeke a gentle aduersarie to fight withall, which must first of all be willing to laye downe his sworde and shielde and then you are good enough for him with your manlie motiues with which when you haue treandled him about like a tenis ball, you sende him backe agayne to his castell of onely Scripture, to see whether they will beare him out in his opinions.
For example, is not this Scripture manifest inough on your side and agaynst vs? This is my body.
They all dronke of the rocke that followed the~ ye rocke was Christ.
They are both one maner of speaking, and both of one matter.
By works a man is iustified not by faith only Iac.
And this is also Scripture, knowing that a man is not iustified by the workes of the Lawe, but by faith of Iesus Christ Glat.
And agayne by grace you are saued through faith (and that not of your selues it is the gift of God) not of workes least any man shoulde boast.
The later being in maner of speaking contrarie to the former text doe playnly shewe, that these two Apostles, speake not both of one kinde of faith or iustification.
But that Iames speaketh of a dead faith as his wordes are playne Vers.
Paule of a liuing faith and of iustification in the sight of God.
Where must first note, that Bristow in translation doth manifestly corrupt falsefie the Scripture.
The Latine is, Infirmatur quis in vobis? If any amongest you be daungerously sicke let him send for the Priests of the church and they to pray ouer him anealing him with oyle in the name of our Lord &c.
First Bristow addeth this word daungerously of his owne heade, which is neither in the Greeke nor vulgare Latine text, to draw the text of Iames violently, to their popish greasing which they vse only when a man is desperatly sicke, and past hope of recouerie in thei iudgement.
Whereas Iames speaketh generally, of any kinde of sickenes, wherewith any of the faithfull were molested.
Secondly Bristowe leaueth out the wordes following, which are these and the prayer of faith shall saue the sicke person and the Lord shall restore him or raise him vp, the Latine is alleiabit shall ease him, which wordes declare, that the Apostle speaketh not of a perpeuall Sacrament of the church, but of a ceremonie vsed by them that had a speciall gift of healing the sicke in the primitiue Churche whiche ceremonie must needes cease, with the gift except it be among apes, that practise outward gesture and actions, without effect.
of Machabees the one of praying for the deade, the other of Ieremie praying for the people, are no partes of the castell of Canonicall Scripture, and therefore with other errours in the same bookes omit them.
The saying of Iacob the Patriarke of Iosephs two childre~.
God who hath fed me from my youth euen to this day: The Angell who hath deliuered me out of all aduersities, blesse these children which is (sayth Bristow) as if one would say, God and our Ladie blesse them.
Nay rather God by Iesus Christ blesse them, for what other Angell but Christ the Angell of the great councell was the deliuerer of Iacob, which when he wrestled with him in a vision and mystery Gen.
Euen the same Angell which led the children of Israel through the wildernes, who~ S. Paul
calleth Christ, who was not an Angel by nature but by office, in that as the Mediator he was sent to deliuer the people before he came in the flesh.
But if we should vnderstand, the Angell of whom Iacob speaketh, for so~e priuate Angel, appointed of God to protect him, yet is it not as if one would say now God our Lady blesse the~.
For that God vseth the ministery of Angels to defend prosper his seruaunts, but not the ministery of Saincts in heaue~, for any such purpose that we can learne by the holy Scriptures.
Iacob might therfore pray yt God would send his Angell to protect those children, euen as he had done for him.
As for that vaine brag that all Scripture from the beginning of Genesis to the end of the Apocalipse is for the~ against vs, is nothing els but a false alarme, as though he woulde on all sides assalt our castel of only Scriptures, wheras he purposeth nothing lesse.
But this can not be borne, that he sayeth some places of Scripture be so playne against vs, that we can not aunswere them but by plucking the pen of the holy Ghost out of his hand that wrote the~ meaning that we deny the auctority of such books as be not Canonicall the Machabees especially.
For either they are proued muncibly to be of the holy Ghostes indighting, or no Scripture at all is proued to be suche as you may remember the common saying of S. Augustine.
shoulde not beleue the Gospell it selfe vnlesse the Catholike Churches auctoritie did compell.
What shall say to this impudent blasphemer that alloweth none other tryall of holy Scripture but the authoritie of the Church, because Augustine supposing that hee were an Heathen, Againe (sayth he would not beleeue the Gospell except the authoritie of the Church, with other thinges did moue him: his woorde is Commoueret whiche Bristowe not so ignorauntly as impudently translateth did compl mec.
But the Catholike Church (saith Bristow) hath receiued these bookes of equall authoritie with the rest.
Indeede the Synagogue of Antichrist in the Tridentine councell hath so decreede.
But the Catholike Church of Christ did neuer receiue them, as haue shewed out of Hicronime. praef in Prouerb and others whereto may adde the iudgement of Origine out of Eusebhist: lib.
Marke the plainenesse of this demonstration, when the question co~trouersie is, whether they or we be the chuch.
All scriptur is for them against vs because the church that is, they haue thus thus decrede, No meruail therfore if Bristow appeale to the iudgme~t of indifferent me~, that al our prating of ye scriptures is nothing else but as S. Peter saith of S. Paules Epistles) our wresting and writhing of them by our owne vnlearnednes vnstablenes, from the Catholike Churches vnitie and vniuersalitie to the scisme and peece of Luther, from the~ce to Caluine &c For the Church is the setled and vnmoueable rock, against which ther is no scripture no trueth but all for it.
This is good a demonstratio~, as if a man should say to a vessel tossed in the brode sea with wind waues, that in the hauen there is great rest securitie, but not shew what course they should keepe to come thither.
We by the only true lodestone Pharos, and heauenly Cynosura of the holy scriptures (we praise his holy name therfore) haue founde the moste happy hauen of the holy Catholick Church of Christ, by his helpe haue caste out the Anchor of Faith so surely fixed not in the sand, but in the Hauen it selfe, that all the Cables of popishe motiues, or blasts of Diuelish doctrines shal not be able to stirre our ship from thence: which course God grau~t them to keepe, who labouring in the sea of doubtfulnes, ride not wilfully among the rocks of Romish pride, nor be obstinately set on the sands of mens traditions, but seeke trueth in humilitie to Gods glory their safetie.
Besids these motiues there are two demands which cannot aptely reduce to any of the Motiues, namely the seconde which he termeth the building of the Church, and the laste which hee calleth Apostasie.
In the former demaund he asketh vs whether we haue not read this argument vsed by Chrisostome againste the Painims and Iewes, that Christe is God, because his Church hauing but a small beginning, many stronge enemyes, to withstand the building thereof, yet could or can neuer be suppressed, but contrariwise of a litle spark hath set all the world on fire &c.
answere, we haue read this argument, and allowe of it.
Then sayth Bristowe, How hath it beene these many hundreth yeeres quite suppressed, yea and in Chrisostomes time no Church at all answere that since it was first set vp, it was neuer for one houre quite suppressed, although by Antichriste these many hundred yeeres it hath beene greatly oppressed.
And in Chrysostomes time the Church did openly florishe, although infected with some errors, yet holding strongly the only tradition Iesus Christ, which church was a member of the same vniuersall Church, whereof our Church at this day is a parte, with which Church in Chrysostoms time, the popish church in that it disse~teth from vs, hath nothing co~mon except one or two errors, hauing the whole substance of doctrine contrary vnto it: wherefore that argument sta~ding, the popish church is nothing vnderpropped thereby: which though it had a small beginning, as the sect of Mahomet, yet grew it by sufferance of God, without great withstanding of strong enemies, yea God sending the effecacy of error, that it might preuaile and yet hath not increased ouer all he world, but is for the most part contained in one parte of Europa deminishing where it is punished as in Germany, Sauoy, Denmarke, Swetia and Englande, growing onely where it is either mayntained by tyranny or tollerated by lenitie.
And now to the laste demaund of Apostasie, wherwith he chargeth vs. Firste for chaunging the Priesthoode, wherevpon must insue a chaunge of the law.
so this aunswere, we haue chaunged no priesthoode, instituted by God, but retaine that eldership and ministery ordayned by our Sauiour Christe.
Contrarywise the Pope hath changed Sacerdotium (which Bristowe confesseth to be no other thing then presbiteratum) which is the ministration of the Gospel yet commonly called both of him and vs Priesthood, that Sacrificing priesthood say wc the Apostle He.
affirmth to be euerlasting and proper to the person of our Sauiour Christe, hath the Pope translated vnto his shaueli gs, and sette them vp to offer that Sacrifice which Christ only could offer, and by once offering found eternall redemption: yea the Priesthood of Melchisedech which the Lord by an othe confirmed only to our sauiour Christ.
Hee hath made common to all his Massemongers, Therfore the Pope hath manifestly made an Apostacy from the lawe of Christ.
The second argument by which Bristow would charge vs with Apostasie is, for receiuing not one or two, but so many olde heresies, besides as he is bolde to say a thousand more of their owne inuention.
It shall suffice to deny and turne ouer vnto him and his fellowes.
The third argument is for taking from Christian men, so many arguments of Christes diuinitie, as the inuincible continuaunce and authoritie of his Church.
The honor and vertue of crosses and reliques miracles, exorcismes, vnitie, Sacrifice &c.
aunswere so many of these as are good and sufficient argumentes, wee holde still, the vnsufficient arguments doe rather disfornish then arme the Christians faith, which we haue so strongly fortified with arguments out of the holy scriptures that all the power of darkenesse cannot preuaile against it, The fourth argument is, for leauing nothing vndenyed, not Fathers, not Councels, not Traditions, not Scriptures, nor (the onely witnesse of all canonicall Scriptures) the Churches institution, and departing from the Fathers of all ages since Christes time, agreeing with no Christian time, nor none with them.
For denying of canonicall Scriptures, it is an impudent slaunder, as for Fathers, Councelles, Traditions, Churches authoritie, we affirme or deny, as they agree or dissagree with the trueth of the holye scriptures, the onely certaine witnesse of the will of God reuealed vnto men, which we thinke more reasonable then the Papistes doe, whiche denie, fathers, Councels, Traditions, yea the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, and submit all vnto the idgement of their Church, now when then the controuersie is, whether they be the Church of God, or of the Deuill: whereas the Scriptures are of bothe partes confessed to be the worde of God in generall termes, although in comparison of the authoritie of their Church, Piggius calleth the holy Scripture a nose of Wax, and a dumbe iudge.
Eccius tearmeth the written gospel a black Gospel and an inkish diuinitie.
Hosius sayth, that this commaundement of Christe, Drinke ye all of this, beeing vnderstoode doth appertaine vnto laye men, contrary to their Churches determination, is the expresse worde of the Deuill.
And for departing from the faith of the Fathers &c.
aunswere it is false, there is but one true Faith of all true Christians, in al times from which wee will neuer departe, although wee haue departed from some erroneous opinions of some fathers, which because they are contrary to the woorde of God, by hearing whereof Faith commeth, they deserue not the name of Faith.
Finally, whereas hee sayth, the authoritie of the Church is the onely witnesse of all canonicall Scriptures, it is vntrue.
For although he should meane not the popish Sinagogue, butthe true catholike church of Christ, yet is it not the onely witnesse of the Scriptures.
For euen the Iewish Synagogue, is witnesse of the olde testament, and many sectes of heresies of all the scripture, beside that the spirit of God is the chiefe and principall witnes of all, which speaketh so euidently in allthe canonical scripture, that if all me~ on earth should refuse to giue credite vnto them, yet his maiestie alone is sufficient to get credite vnto them, especially with all those whome he teacheth inwardly in heart, as he speaketh sensibly to their eares.
The last argument is, That in place of all Religion and goodnes which they haue remoued, deuising a new Gospel of their foresaid onely vaine fayth, which teacheth all sinnes all heresies to presume of saluation.
What can bee more impudent or false then this slaunder, seeing God and the worlde knoweth, that wee teach none other Faith but the fayth of the Gospell, which worketh by loue, and promiseth remission of sinnes and saluation to none, but such as earnestly repent, and are willing to remoue all heresie, and to imbrace all true Christian Religion and goodnesse.
DISCOVERY OF THE DAVNGEROVS ROCKE OF THE POPISH CHVRCH, lately commended by Nicholas Sanders D. in diuinitie, at which the Catholike Church of Christ hath bene in perill of shipwracke these many hundreth yeares, By W. Fulke D. in diuinitie.
THE eternal rocke of the vniuersal Church, Christ was the rocke, an other foundation no man is able to put.
The temporall rocke of the Militant Church: Thou art Peter vpon this rocke will build my Church.
speaketh of an eternall rocke, against the which the gates of hell shall not preuayle.
Therefore your distinction of eternall and temporall, vniuersall and militant, which is the foundation of all your rotten rocke is an impudent and blasphemous falshood.
Of the continuance of your temporall rocke, it is in vaine to contende when your rocke is nothing els but an heape of sande and dunge whereon your popishe Church is builded.
To the right worshipfull M. Doctor Parker bearing the Saunder. name of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and to all other Protestants in the Realme of England, Nicolas Sander wisheth perfect faith and charitie in our Lorde, declaring in this preface, that the Catholikes (whome they call Papistes) doe passe the Protestants, in all maner of signes or markes of Christes true Church.
Concerning the omission of titles accustomed to be giuen to the Archbishop of Canterbury, for which you excuse your selfe, thinke M. D. Parker while he liued, did not much esteeme them giuen to him by any man, and least of all looked to receyue them at suche mens handes as you are: but touching the religion church, whereof he was a minister, will aunswer you in his behalfe and of all other ministers and members thereof, that no excuse will serue you, vpon so slender reasons as you bringe, to condemne the same of schisme and heresie, nor to defend that Synagogue of Satan, wherof you professe your selfe to be a Champion, to be the vndefiled Church and spouse of Christ.
For thinke you M. Sanders, that we wil more mislike the Church of Christ persecuted by the hypocriticall crueltie of Antichrist for the space of
hundreth yeares before our age, then we do the same, persecuted by the furious rage of Heathenish tyrantes, for
yeares after the first planting of the same amonge the Gentills.
And thinke you if we are now to learne, that all that glory and bright shining of Christes Church promised by the Prophets, is spirituall and not carnall, heauenly and not earthly, eternal not transitory? Or that we know not your synagogue to be the very contrary kingdome and sea of Antichrist, euen by that outward glory, and glistering pompe of open shewe, that you boast of, according to the prophecy of Christ in the reuelation? Apoc.
And as for the citie built vpon an hill, whereof you haue neuer doone babling, by the playne context of the Gospel, is not the whole Church, but euery true pastor and minister thereof, who are also the light of the worlde, the salt of the earth, and a candle set on a candlesticke, to giue light, not hiden vnder a bushell to be vnprofitable.
And Christ hath alwayes bene with his Church, although the Church of Rome be departed from him, and he both liueth raigneth for euer, ouer the house of Iacob, though he be persecuted in his me~bers by the whore of Babylon, and his name is great amonge the Gentilles, from the Sunne rising to the going downe thereof, notwithstanding that all nations haue dronke of the cuppe of her fornications.
The prophecyes of Gods spirit doe not one of them ouerthrow the other, but the one sheweth how the other is to be vnderstanded.
And whereas you say our Church hath bene vnder a bushell before these fiftie yeares, because no historie maketh mention of any congregation professing our faith in any townes or places of diuers co~tryes at once, aunswer this is as true as all your doctrine beside.
For all auncient histories that write of the state of the primitiue Church, make mention of the same faith which we professe.
And although towarde the reuelation of Antichrist, the puritie of the faith beganne to be polluted, yet the substance thereof continued, vntill by Antichrist, that great defection apostasie was made, wherof the Apostle prophecyeth
And yet euen in the tyme of that a postasie, many histories make mention, of the continuance of our faith and Church in diuers contryes in Europe, namely England, Fraunce, Italy, or although vnder cruell persecution and tyranny, beside great nations of the East, which neuer submitted them selues to the Church of Rome, and yet retayned the substance of Christian faith and profession, though not without particular errors and superstition.
Wherefore although they that were blind, or farre of from the Church of Christ, could not see her glory, although she had bene set vpon neuer so high an hill, no more then a citie built vpon the Alpes, can be seene in England, yet they that had spirituall eyes, and by Gods grce drewe neare vnto his Church, did in the most obscure tymes, (as the worlde esteemeth them,) see the cleare bewtie of her light, and the glorye of the Lordes hill, lifted vp aboue all the hills in the world.
The heathen tyrants, thought by their cruell persecution, that they had vtterly rooted out the name and nation of Christians from the face of the earth.
Nero gloried that he had purged the world of the superstition of Christ, as appeareth in an olde inscription, in a picture of stone.
Max. ob prouin. latromb. hijs qui nouam generi hum. superstitionem inculcar. purgatam.
To Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus the greatest Prelate, for that he hath purged the prouince of theeues, and them that brought in a newe superstition to mankind.
Likewise another like piller there is of Diocletian and Maximian, in these wordes.
Amplificato per Orientem Occident. nup. Rom. nomme Christianorum deleto quiremp. euertebant.
Diocletianus Iouius and Maximianus Herculeus Caesaris Augusti, hauing amplified the Empire of Rome, both in the East and West, and vtterly destroyed the name of Christians, which did ouerthrow the common wealth, Another like there is of Diocletian alone.
Aug. Galerio in Oriente adoptat. superstitione Christi vbi{que} deleta cultu Deorum propagato.
Diocletianus Caesar Augustus, hauing adopted Galerius in the East, and in all places vtterly destroyed the superstition of Christ, and set forth the worship of the Gods.
By these inscriptions and glorious titles you see, that the heathenish tyrants, perswaded them selues, that they had vtterly defaced the religion of Christ, destroyed his Church out of the worlde.
what maruell then, if Antichrist and his adherents, which to the cruelty of the former tyrants haue added most detestable hypocrisy, haue thought that they had so wholy subuerted the true religion of Christ and his true Church, that the name ether of Church or religion, might not seeme to haue remayned in the world, but that of the Romish Antichrist.
Maximus of Rome, with Diocletiane and the reste were deceyued in their time, so their successors in place, office, and wickednes, the Popes of Rome are likewise disapoynted of their cruell purpose.
But M. Sander glorieth that in all markes and signes of the true Church, the popish Church doth excel ours.
But first of all, that which is the onely true marke and triall of the Church, namely the word of God, he denyeth to be a sufficient marke of the true Church, yet had he before confessed the Church to be the piller and stay of truth.
but the rule of truth (if we beleue our Sauiour Christ) is the word of God Iohn.
therefore the word of God is the onely true tryall and marke of the Church.
But let vs consider his reasons, by which he woulde perswade vs that ye word of God is not the chiefe marke whereby the true Church of God may be knowen.
First he sayth the marke whereby an other thing is knowne, ought it selfe to be most exactly knowne, wheras we are not agreed what Gods word is.
Note this reason of his, by which he taketh away all authoritie and vse from the worde of God, not onely thereby to discerne the true Church, but also to teache vs any other thinge that is needefull for vs to know.
But why pray you are we not agreed what is Gods word? Forsooth because some cal onely the written letter and the meaning thereof Gods word, other thinke many thinges are Gods word which are not expressely written, but deliuered by tradition from the Apostles, and by the holy Ghost, which hath written his lawes in our hartes: of this later sort be the Papists, but they are easily confuted.
For this principle must needes stand vnmoueable, that Gods spirite is neuer contrary to him selfe.
Therefore seeing the spirite of God hath pronounced of the Scriptures, that they are able to make the man of God perfect prepared to all good workes.
it is certayne that God hath reuealed nothing by tradition, for our instructio~, which is not conteyned in his worde written, much lesse any thing that is contrary to his doctrine deliuered in the holy Scriptures.
His second reason is, that we are not agreed vpon the written word of God, because the Protestants doe not admitte so many bookes of the olde testament as the Catholikes doe.
aunswer, the Protestants doe admit as many as the Catholike Church euer did or doth at this day.
His third reaso~ is, that the meaning of those bookes which we are agreed vpon, is altogether in question betwene vs, therfore that can be no marke of the church, which it self is not knowne.
answer, although heretikes which are ouerthrowen in their owne conscience, will acknowledge no meaning to be true but their owne, yet are there many principles in the Scriptures so playne, as they are graunted by both partes, or els can not without shame be denyed of our aduersaries, out of which playne certeyne and immutable principles, all matters in controuersie may be proued and the same church also discerned, which is the verie cause, why the Papistes dare not abide the triall by the Scriptues, but flye to traditions, euen as their forefathers the auncient Valentinian heretikes, of whome Irenaeus writeth lib.
Cum ex Scripturis arguuntur, in accusationem conuertuntur ipsaru~ Scripturam, quasi non rectè habeant, neque fuit ex auctoritate, quia variè sunt dictae, quia non possit ab his inueniriveritas, qui nesciant traditionem, non enim per literas traditam sed per viuam vocem.
When they are conuinced out of the Scriptures, then fall they to accusing of the Scriptures them selues as though they were not right: nor of sufficient authoritie, because they are spoken doubtfully, and that the trueth cannot be found of them which knowe not the tradition, for that was not deliuered by letters, but by word of mouth.
Thus much Ireneus of the olde Heretikes, and what his iudgement was of the meaning of the Scripture which M. Sand. maketh so ambiguous, he declareth lib.
Vniuersae scripturae Propheticae Euangelicae in aperto, sine ambiguitat, similiter ab omnibus audiri possunt &c.
The whole Scriptures both of the Prophets, and of the Gospells, are open and without ambiguitie, may be heard of all me~ alike.
This speaketh Irenaeus not of euery text of Scripture, but of the whole doctrine of the Prophets and Apostles, which is so playne and easie to be founde in the Scriptures, that no man can misse thereof, that seeketh not of purpose to be deceyued, as he sayth cap.
But M. Sander is content for disputation sake to admit Gods word for a marke of the true Church, and will proue that it is first with the Papistes.
For if by Gods word we meane the written letter of the Bible, they are before vs, because we haue none assured copies thereof, which we receyued not of them, for since that day in which S. Peter and S. Paule deliuered Gods word to the Romaines, the Church of Rome hath alwayes kept it without leesing or corrupting.
aunswer we meane not by Gods worde the written letter onely, but receyuing and obeying the true and playne sense thereof to be the marke of the Church.
Againe deny, that we had any assured copies of the olde and new testament of the popish Church, but the one of the Iewes in Hebrue, the other of the Greeke Church in Greeke.
And whereas he talketh of a certayne daye in which S. Peter and S. Paule deliuered the Scripture to the Romains, it sauoreth altogether of a popish fable, finally how the Romish Church in these last dayes hath kept the Scripture from corruption, although coulde shew by an hundreth examples, yet this one shall suffice for all, the very first promise of the Gospell, that is in the Scripture.
that the seede of the woman shoulde breake the serpents heade, the popish Church hath ether willfully corrupted, or negligently suffered to be depraued, thus, ipsa conteret caput iuum, she shall breake thyne heade, referring that to the woman which God speaketh expressely to the seede of the woman.
The second marke is, that the Papistes acknowledge more of the Bible then we doe, by the bookes of Toby, Iudeth, Wisedom, Ecclesiasticus and of the Machabees.
aunswer in that you adde vnto the word of God, it is a certayne argument, that you are not the true Church of Christ, for the true Church of Christ hath euer accompted those bookes for apocryphall, witnesse hereof Hieronym praef. in prouerb.
Sicut ergo Iudith Tobiae Machabaeorum libros legit quidem Ecclesia, sed eos inter Canonicas Scripturas non recipit: sic haec duo volumina legat ad aedificationem plebis, non ad auctoritate~ Ecclesiasticoru~ dogmatum confirmandam.
Therefore as the Church doth in deede reade the bookes of Iudith, Tobias, and of the Machabees, but she receyueth them not among the canonicall Scriptures: so she may reade these two bookes (meaning the booke of Wisedom and Ecclesiasticus) for the edifying of the people, but not to confirme the authoritie of Ecclesiasticall opinions.
(who~ M. Sander quoteth) of any other iudgement, but prescribeth rules how the canonicall Scriptures are to be knowne.
he confesseh plainely that the booke of Machabees is not accompted of the Iewes as the law, the Prophets and the Psalmes, which our Sauiour Christ admitteth as his witnesses: yet it is receyued of the Church, if it be read or heard soberly.
Whereby it is manifest, that the Church in his tyme receyued it not absolutely, as part of the Canonicall Scripture, but vnder condition of a sober reader or hearer.
As for the decree ascribed to Gelasius, it hath no sufficient credit of antiquitie, and much lesse the late councels of Florence and Trent, which he quoteth.
Beside that the same decree of Gelasius admitting but one booke of Esdras, excludeth the Canonicall booke of Nehemias, and receyueth but one booke of the Machabees which will doe the Papistes but small pleasure.
The third marke, the popish Church receyueth not only the hebrue text of the old testament, the greeke of the new, but also the greeke translation of the septuaginta, and the common Latine translation, to be of full authoritie, whereas we giue small credit to those translations, except they agree with the first Hebrue and Greeke copies.
Therefore the Papists haue Gods word in more authenticke tongues and copies then we haue.
aunswer, The Tridentine councell alloweth none for authenticall, but the common Latine translation, that is the worst of all: but in that the popish Church admitteth differing translations from the originall truth of the Hebrue and Greeke text, to be of full authoritie with the truth, it appeareth plainely that she is not the Church of Christ: which ether willfully confoundeth error with truth, or els lacketh the spirite of discretion to know the one from the other.
And for more authentike copies it is impudently sayd, that the Papistes doe receiue, for we receiue not onely all these which he nameth, but also the most auncie~t Chaldee Paraphrastes, the Syrian text of the new testament, yea the Arabicall text of the whole Bible, beside, all vulgare translations of English, French, Dutch, Italian, Spanish, which the Papistes can not abide.
All those, saye, we receyue as authenticall copies for Christian men to vse: but so that the tryall of all translations be made, by the originall truthe of the Hebue and Greeke texts: in which tongue, the olde and newe Testament were first written.
Fourthly, the Papistes doe translate and expounde Gods worde in all maner of tongues, better then we, because they haue not onely internall vocation, but also externall vocation and commission from the Apostles, by lyneall succession of Bishops and Preestes: whereas we haue no commission, but rom the common wealth which hath none authoritie to make Preestes &c: and yet how shall they preache if they be not sent? Rom.
aunswer concerning translations of the word of God into all tongues neuer saw any, nether is there any translation to be shewed of any Papist, into any vulgare tongue.
And as for the externall calling of the Papistes, say it is not from any lawfull succession of the Apostles and auncient Church, whose faith and doctrine they do not follow in their interpretations, for if lyneall succession of Priestes and Bishops coulde make interpretations good, the doctrine of Arius, Nestorius, Macedonius, and many other heretikes, whose externall calling was according to the lyneall and ordinary succession of Bishops and Priestes, might be auctorised for Catholike.
Yea the Papistes might not refuse whatsoeuer Luther, Bucer, Cranmer, and other haue taught, which had the same lyneall succession that M. Sander doth nowe bragge of.
And as for our externall calling, he sayth falsly it is of the common weale &c, whereas it is of the Church, and therefore ordinarye and lawfull, and the saying of S. Paule whom he citeth Rom. the tenth is of the inward calling and sending by God, whereof our doctrine agreeable with the Scripture and our whole intent to set forth the glory of God is a sufficient profe, the one to satisfie men, the other to aunswer our owne conscience.
Fiftly he sayth it is no perfection at all on our side, that we reade Gods word to the people in our Church seruice in the vulgare tongue, for thereby we lacke the vse of the better tongues, as of the Greeke and Latine.
maister of impudencie, what vse is there of the Greeke and Latine tongues, to be read to the people that vnderstande them not? And why are those the better tongues? he sayth they were sanctified on Christes crosse for all holy vses, and especially to serue God in the tyme of sacrifice.
But howe were they sanctified pray you? For sooth, because Pilate wrote the title in Hebrue, Greeke, and Latine, that it might be vnderstoode of all nations for what cryme he was condemned.
And is Pilate nowe become a sanctifier of tongues for Gods seruice? is the malicious scorne of an heathen tyrant, a sanctification of these tongues? brasen foreheads of shameles Papistes.
This sanctification was the cause, that the Apostles in the East and West deliuered these tongues alone as holy, learned and honorable, not regarding the infinite multitude of prophane and barbarous tongues, whereof it came, that the East Church was called the Greeke Church, the West the Latine Church.
But the Scripture, Acts the second, doth teach vs, that the holy Ghost hath sanctified all tongues of all nations to the praysing of God, and that the Apostles deliuered the magnifical prayses of God, in all languages.
And although the Greeke and Latine tongues, were most vsed, most commonly vnderstoode in the Romane Empire, yet the Church of Christ was enlarged farther then euer the Romane Empire extended in Persia, Armenia, AEthiopia, India &c. where there was no knowledge, ether of the Greke or Latine tongues.
And euen in the Romain Empire those nations, to whome the Latine Greeke tongues were not vulgare, vsed their Church seruice in other tongues.
Hieronym. in epitaphio Paulae ad Eustochium telleth, that at the solemne funeralls of Paule: euery nation that was present, did singe their Psalmes in order in their owne language.
In the Hebrue, Greeke, Latine and Syrian speache, the Psalmes were songe in order.
But seeing Maister Sander alloweth none other sanctification of the tongues, but Pilates title on the crosse, how is the Hebrue tongue which was one of the three, and the most principall, as the first tongue of the worlde, and for the excellencye therof called the holy tongue, how is that say, shut out from Church seruice, why was there not an Hebrue seruice established by the Apostles as well as the Greeke and Latine? But yet he bringeth another argument to proue that it is lawfull to reade seruice to the people in a tongue wc they vndersta~d not, by the exa~ple of Christ, who in time of his sacrifice, did recite the beginning of the Psalme, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me, in ye Hebrue tongue, which he knew the people did not vnderstand, and did not interprete the same in the vulgar tounge.
Good Lord into what foollishnes doth satan carry their minds, that wilfully striue against the truth? For what reason is this? Christ in his priuate praier, that concerned his owne person, spake with a tou~g that was not commonly vnderstood, therefore the ordinary publike seruice ought to be in a strau~ge toung.
Christ compassed about with his enemyes, none within the hearing of him but the virgine Mary, Iohn the Euangelist loued him or regarded him spake Hebrue, therefore the Prieste in the church, must speake Latine or Greeke.
But when M. Sand. hath played with this argument as long as he can, his antecedent is vtterly false, for Christe resited not that texte of the Psalme in the Hebrue, but in the Syrian toung, which was the vulgar tounge vnderstood and spoken of all the people, as is manifestly proued by the word Sabactani reported by both the Euangelists.
Which is of the Syrian tounge, whereas the Hebrue texte is Hazabtani, as report me to all that can but read two tounges Hebrue and Syrian.
And whereas the malicious Helhou~ds said he called for Elias, it was not because they vnderstood him not, but because they most dispightfully mocked his most vehement praier, taking occasion of the like sound of the name of God of Elias, as scornefull deriders vse to doe. Sixtly, lest the Protestants should passe the Papistes in any one iote, they haue the vse of the vulgar tongues in Dalmatia, Assyria, AEthiopia, which acknowledge the supremacie of the Byshop of Rome.
This is a loude lye, for neither the church of Dalmatians, Moscouites, Armenians, Assirians, AEthiopia~s, nor any other of those East nations, that retaine the name of Christe, did euer acknowledge the Popes supremacie.
knowe they haue fayned Fables of Letters sent from Preto Ioannes and such like, which are meere forgeryes vppon the submission of some one poore wanderer, that hath come out of those countryes.
But M. Sand. will shewe the cause, why all Nations are not suffered likewise to vse their vulgar tounges in their seruice.
First he sayeth vulgar tounges cause barbarousnesse, for the Preachers of those Countryes vnderstande not the Latine and Greeke tounges by this meanes.
For when or where was greater ignorance in the Cleargie, then there, and at such time as the Latine seruice was vsed? How many in all England vnderstoode or coulde read the Greeke toung within these sixtie or eightie yeeres? speake nothing of the Hebrue tounge.
Contrarywise what age was euer more full of lyberall knowledge in all Sciences, and learned tounges, then this is euen in England, France, Germany, where seruice is vsed in the vulgar tou~ge? Thefore the vse of thevulgar tou~ge in Church Seruice is not the cause of barbarousnesse.
The seconde reason is, that necessitie inforceth the Apostolike See to tollerate these Nations in their vulgar tounges, because they knowe none other, but Protestants by schisme are fallen from Latine to Englishe, that is from better to worse, and therefore not to be tollerated.
But indeede the necessitie is, because they will not receiue your Latine tounge, and our schisme is from Antichriste to be ioyned with Christe, from whose doctrine the Church of Rome by horrible schisme is departed, for what the doctrine of Christe is concerning Publique Prayers in a tounge that is not vnderstoode, his Apostle Saincte Paule hath abundauntly taught vs, the
Finally we defende that our naturall Englihe tounge, is better to ediie Englishe men, then your balde Latine tou~ge that you vse in your popish seruice is for any vse of any man learned or vnlearned.
Seuenthly the Papistes doe not onely consider the written letter, but also the plain meaning of euery proposition and as the words doe sound, so doe they vnderstand them.
To this answere, that if they vnderstande all propositions, aswel figuratiue as plain proper speaches as the words doe sound, they make monstrous interpretations, as if they vnderstande this proposition the rock was Christe as the words sound, they make a new transubstantiation of the stone into Christ, or this: This cuppe is the newe Testament, if theire interpretation be none other then the sound of the word doth giue, they make the newe Testament to be nothing but a drinking vessel.
But to discusse his examples, the first is this text.
This is my body, why saith he is this which Christe poynteth to, denied to be his body.
answere, it is affirmed to be his body in that sence that he spake and otherwise then he ment, it is denyed to be his body.
VVhy then are workes denyde to iustifie, or onely faith taught to iustifie.
aunswere woorkes are not denyed to iustifie before men, and onely faith is taught to iustifie before God.
VVhy then teach you the lawe not to be able to be doone.
Because the Apostle saith, that of the workes of the law none shalbe iustified before God.
for if the workes of the lawe could be done, by any man perfectly as the law requireth, he shold be iustified by the~ as the text affirmeth By the obedience of one, that is Christe, many shall bee made righteous.
VVhy then are wee denyed to bee really righteous, and sayde to bee righteous by imputation onely? Because the obedience of Christe is not really our obedience, but by imputatio~ of God through faith.
The loue of God is spread in our heartes by the holy ghost, which is geuen vs. Rom.
This is more then a bare imputing of righteousnesse to vs, yea Sir, but this is not our iustification, but an effect thereof, for he saide immediatly before that beeing iustified by faith wee haue peace with God.
Ioh. VVhy then are Bishops and Priests denyed to forgiue sinnes.
We graunt that true Byshops and elders haue authoritie to forgiue sinnes in Gods name, but not absolutely.
He that is great among you, let him be made as the yonger.
VVhy then deny you that one was greater among the Apostles, and is stil among the Bishops their successors.
One was not greater among the Apostles in authoritie, for their greatnes was to be the greatest seruaunt to take the most paines, to be most humble.
Mat. Thou art Peter or a rock, and vpon this Rock wil builde my Church Mat. VVhy is the militant Church denyed to be built vponS.
Peter and his suceessors in that chayre and office.? The Church is affirmed to be built vpon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, and so vpon Peter as one of the~, in which office he hath no successors.
Keepe the traditions which yee haue learned, either by word or by an Epistle.
VVhy then are traditions so dispised that the name cannot be suffred in the English Bible.
It may and is suffred in that sense, which the holye Ghost vseth it, but not to bring in prayer for the deade or any thing contrary to the scripture, vnder the name of traditions Apostolike.
For the Apostle speaketh only of the doctrine which he deliuered to them, either by preaching or by Epistle, which is none other, then is co~tayned in the holy Seriptures.
For of other traditions pretended to be of the Apostles, he biddeth them take heede in the same Chapter.
He that ioyneth his Virgine in mariage doth well and hee that doth not ioyne her doth better.
VVhy make you mariage as good as virginitie? For such as haue the gift of continence we graunt virginitie is better in such respectes as the Apostle teacheth, Vow eye and render your vowes vnto God.
If thou wilt be perfect go and sel all thinges which thou haste giue them to the poore follow me.
There are Eunuches which haue gelded them selues for the kingdome of Heauen.
Obey your Rulers, and be subiect vnto them? VVhy the~ are the vowes of pouertie, of chastitie and obedience, counted vnlawful, or men co~strained not to performe the~.
The first text perteineth to the old Testame~t, The second is a singular tryall to that one place.
The third we graunt in them to whome it is giuen, the fourth we neuer made question about it, but al these are euil fauouredly patched togither, to proue the vowe of Monkery lawfull, which is superstitious for want of Gods commaundement, blasphemous for the opinion of merite, impossible for the frailtie of many mens nature.
As for compulsion there is none vsed, for no man is compelled to be rich, vnchaste or disobedient.
VVhy the~ is satisfaction and penaunce desptsed with you? This text is, Doe ye the fruits worthy of repentance.
We honour the fruites worthy of true repentance, and exhorte all men to bring them forth, but popish satisfaction hath nothing like to them.
For we beleeue that God doth freely forgiue the penitent for Christes sake.
The husband wife beeing two in one flesh, is a greate sacrament or mistery in Christ, in the church.
VVhy is then the mariage of faithful persons denied to be a sacrament.
If you vnderstand a sacrament generally, for euery mystery, we may graunt you it is a sacrament, but if you vnderstand a sacrament specially for an outwarde signe of Gods fauour grace or a seale of our iustification it is none.
For if it were it should be necessary for all men to receiue it, againe it hath the institutio~ of God before the fall of man, therefore can be no sacrament of ye new Testament to testifie our restitution.
Your co~mon translation turneth the Greeke word [undefined span alphabet] which is a holy secret, oftentime Sacramentum, yet know you woulde be ashamed to confesse so many sacramentes of the popish church, as there be misteries which hee calleth sacrame~ts as Ephe.
the preaching of the gospell to the Gentiles he calleth Sacramentum.
And are you not ashamed to delude ignorant men, with the ambiguous name of a Sacrament.
VVhy then are you so presumptuous, as euen by faith to assure your selues of you saluation? because it followeth immediatly that it is God which worketh in vs both to will and to performe according to his good wil, for it is no presumtion to assure our selues that the promises of God are true.
And he may welfeare, which is assured to be saued, for faith doth not exclude but plant in vs the feare of God, though not a seruile feare.
As for ye deepe secretes of Gods predestination, we take not vpon vs to knowe them, otherwise then they be reuealed by his worde.
Finally, where you aske whether faith be not an ordinary gift in the Church, answere you wt the Apostle, that all men which are in the outward face of the Church, and participate the Sacraments, haue not fayth.
marke of the Church if not onely the playne vnderstanding of any one sentence, but also the circumstance of the place, and the conference of Gods worde be necessary, the Papists haue vsed it in euery question.
For proofe herof M. Sanders referreth vs to his treatise of the supper of the Lord lib.
answer you make a light shew, for a fashion, but you nether co~sider the circumstances rightly, nor make any true collation of one place with another, as is proued by the answers of these bookes: Therefore your Academical conclusion is false, hereticall blasphemous, that the onely word of God, being neuer so well handled, is no sufficient marke to shew the truth.
When Christ sayth, Sanctifie them in thy truth, Thy word is the truth.
M. Sander sayth: the heads of the Church, the councels, the Bishops and the auncient fathers must be Iudges whether we do well apply the Scriptures or no? as whether S. Peter be the rock which M. Iewel denieth, he proueth by doctors afterward cap.
of wc proofe we shall consider God willing in due place.
for his rule of Iudges: say, he hath no such rule in that booke, onely Augustine doth co~uince the argume~ts of the Pelagians of nouelty, by the iudgeme~t of Iren.
Cyprianus, Rheuanus, Ambrosius &c. and other, which liued before their time, and therefore were no partial iudges, so do we conuince the Popish heresies, and their argumentes of noueltie, not only by the manifest worde of God, but also by the testimonie of the most auncient fathers, although we may not admit all that they did write to be true, euen as the same Augustine being pressed with the auctoritie of Ambrose, Chrysostome, and Cyprian by the Donatists Pelagians, prouoketh from them onely to the Scriptures.
That the allegation of the fathers suffiseth not of it selfe, we agree with Maister Sander, but that there is any other triall of the truth the~ Scripture, we wil neuer graunt, seeing God hath therein deliuered his whole doctrine, whatsoeuer is necessarie for vs to beleue that we may be saued.
But the Papistes for the tenth marke ioyne tradition and practise of Gods church, which can neuer deceaue ama~. VVe thinke sayth Chrysostom the tradition of the church to be worthie of beleefe.
But howe shall we proue it to be a tradition of the church.
The Valentinians (as shewed before out of Irenaeus) denyed the Scriptures to be sufficient, without knowledge of the tradition.
Therfore to discerne the tradition of church from the tradition of the heretikes, we haue none other triall but by the Scriptures.
that S. Paule did write the same thinges which he told them before in preaching.
As for the vniuersall practise either of the Popes supremacy, or of the sacrifice of the masse which he braggeth of, shall neuer be proued, but the contrarie.
The eleuenth marke is the auctority of generall cou~cells confirming the truth, condemning heretikes, such he maketh the late councell of Trent to be.
But we deny that Conciliabulum, of a few Popish hypocrits, to be a generall councell, in which no man should haue a definitiue voyce, but they that were accused of heresie and whereof, he that is most of all charged with heresie, that is the Pope, is made the supreme iudge, wherefore the Papists haue no lawfull generall councell on their side, although generall councells as he confesseth, are no sufficient triall of the true church, both because they may be hindered many wayes, and also because they may erre, as did the conncells of Arimine, and Ephesus.
In respect of these considerations, he maketh the twelfth marke to be the supremacy of the Pope, whichis wholly theirs for triall whereof, this booke following was written.
But for proofe that Christ hath appoynted such a iudge, ouer all, he citeth Ioan.
that Christ co~maunded Peter to feede his sheepe, as though that perteyned not to euerie one of the Apostles, as much as to Peter.
that Christ hauing praied that Peters faith might not fayle, commaunded him when he was conuerted from his fall, to confirme his brethren, which perteineth only to the person of Peter, and can not with any cable ropes be drawe~ to the Bishop of Rome, or any successor of Peter, for it concerneth his singular, full, comfort duty, in respect of his fall Gods mercy, except that according to analogy, it may be applied to any man, that is so raised after his fall, and so that precept confirme thy brethren, geueth no speciall commaundeme~t to the Pope, but to euery. man whom God hath mercifully conuerted as he did Peter.
With the twelfth marke M. Sander would haue ended, but that the Protestantes, affirme the lawfull preaching of Gods word, and the lawfull administration of the Sacramentes to be a marke whereby they wilbe tried.
But seeing lawfull preaching ministring must be tried by Gods worde, M. Sander first asketh what we call Gods word? secondly he asketh if he haue not proued it to be more with the~ the~ with vs, whatsoeuer it be? It is like this Popishe academicall Atheist, hath proued Gods word to be on his side, wil not haue it certeinly known what Gods word is.
After this he will proue the Papists to be most lawfull preachers, because they are likest to the Apostles, in conuerting many nations, within these
yeres, whe~ he sayth no man aliue could once heare vs peepe.
As though controuersie of nations would argue a true church.
By which reasons not only the Protestants may nowe proue them selues to be most like the Apostles in conuerting so many nations of Europe, but also the Arians, and most of all, the Mahumetists, might proue them selues the true church.
It is not therfore co~uersion of nations, but conuersion of the~ to the true doctrine of the Apostles, which maketh vs like the Apopostles: the Papistes, Arians, Mahometists most vnlike vnto them.
And where he saith, that no sou~d of ours was heard in
yeares space by any man aliue: to see how impude~tly he lyeth, read Flaccius Illyricus in catalogo testium veritatis, you shal see in all ages, what monume~ts are extant of some few, whom God reserued from that generall Apostasie of Antichrist.
Read also the acts monumentes set forth by M. Foxe, you shall see the same most plentiflly.
He wil proue their administration of the Sacraments to be more lawful then ours, because they haue fiue more then we.
But answer because they haue fiue more then the worde of God alloweth, or the primitiue church acknowledgeth: in the administration of the other they haue either altogether peruerted the institution, as in the Lordes supper: or shamefully corrupted it with superstition, as in baptisme: they are not the church of Christ, but the church of Antichrist.
When we alledge the persecution of the Romish Antichrist, to be the cause that our church, hath not florished in outward peace, to be a marke also of the truth of our congregation, what maisters (sayth D. Sanders) Antichrists persecution shall dure but three yeres, an halfe, and is the Pope Antichrist, who hath dured these
yeres? But good M. Doctor determiner, how proue you that Antichrists persecution shall dure but three an halfe, of such yeares as the Pope hath dured
you might by as good reason say it shal dure but three dayes an halfe Apoc.
will you take vpon you so precisely to determine of the mysticall nu~ber which is somtime called
daies an halfe, somtime a time times halfe a time, al which make halfe a Prophetical weeke, signifie a time determined of God, but not plainly reuealed to many.
Seco~dly you aske, how it could be the true church, against wc Antichrist so lo~g preuailed, that no man could tel whether any such were in ye earth: whe~ hel gates shal not preuaile against ye true church? answere, if you can not put a difference betwene impugning preuailing: you wil haue much to do to defend your Romish church to be the true church, against the Turkes the~ selues, who haue possessed a great part of grou~d, wc you say perteined once to your church.
But herin appeareth the mark of the true church, against wc the gates of hell haue not preuailed, that although Sata~ was let loose, the whore of Babylon dronken with the blood of her me~bers, her two witnesses slaine, she her selfe driuen into the wildernes, her seede persecuted wheresoeuer they were dispersed, yet she is restored in the sight of the world, her witnesses raised fro~ death to life, the deuill is vanquished, ye purple whore of Babylon is fallen, Antechrist shall at length be throwne into the lake with the deuil and his Angels.
This is the Lordes worke it is maruelous in our eyes.
If either persecution, or not failing in persecutio~, be a marke of the church, it is more in the Papists the~ in the
Protesta~ts, for persecutio~ he will proue that they be persecuted by vs, as the mother by ye child, which departeth from her obedience, as Agar Ismael fro~ Sara.
But answer, we are departed fro~ Agar, vnder whom we were in bondage to Sara by whom we are made children of the heaue~ly Ierusalem: euen as Agar departed fro~ Sara, so did the synagoge of Rome fro~ the Catholike church of Christ.
For not failing in persecutio~, experie~ce teacheth in all countries, wc haue receaued the Gospell, how small punishme~ty greatest nu~ber of Papists wil abide, for their Popish profession: whereas so many thousands Gos Saincts being most cruelly murdred by ye popish church, the church of Christ is not diminished but encreased thereby, euen as Cyprian saith the blood of the martyrs is the seede of church.
If antiquitie be a marke, it is proued to be on the Papists side by this reason.
The church is all one, the later part of the church for
yeares last past is on the Papistes side therefore the former parte also.
But this reason standing vpon a shamefull begging of that which is questioned, is soone turned vpon your owne~ necke.
The church is in all but one, but the beginning of the church maketh not for you, therefore that which you say is the later part of the church, being contrary to that former, is no part of the church, so that by this reason, you shal neither haue antiquitie or any parte of the church.
But if you appeale to particular examples (sayth M. Sander) say the Christians in the primitiue church, did communicate vnder one kinde at Emaus, and at Ierusalem.
And say M. Sander, if he would burst him self with study, shall neuer proue it.
whose opinion was that Christ gaue the sacrame~t at Emaus, but of communion in one kind,
He sayth the Christians did set vp images in the honor of Christ, quoting Eus. lib.
whereas Eusebius speaketh of heathen men, that of heathenish custome did set vp images and not of Christians.
Dionysius although he be auncient, yet he wrote not in the tyme of Eusebius, Hieronymus or Gennadius, so was knowne for no writer in ye Church for
yeares after Christ, Wherefore wil not stand about his errors and ceremonyes, which yet for the moste parte are as vnlike the popish ceremonyes, as they are to ours.
Although wee haue no certaintie of the writinges of Ignatius which are extant, yet is there nothing in them that fauoreth the Papists religion.
Hee nameth a a sacrifice which could not be offered without the Byshop, that cannot be the Masse, whiche euery hed geprieste may say, ad Symrn.
He would haue the Emperor obey the Byshop (sayth M. Sand.) ad Phil.
But this proueth the Epistle to bee counterfaite, for there was no Christian Emperour when Ignatius liued.
(Although in deuine matters the Christian Emperour ought to obey the Bishop, or rather Gods word which ye Bishop preacheth.)
Also he speaketh of Virgins that had consecrated them selues to God: who speaketh against them, which hauing the gifte of continency doe keepe virginity? In the same Epistle: He affirmeth both Peter and Paule to haue bene maried, and will not condemne the mariage of church ministers.
Choose M. Sander, whether your decretals lye of Thelesphorus that inuented the lent fast, or that this is a counterfait Epistle of Ignatius.
daies fast, the Wednesday the Friday fast he saith farther.
Quicun{que} dominicum aut sabbathum non ieiunauerit praetr vnum sabbathum pasae ipse est Christi interfector: Whosoeuer shall not fast the Lordes day or sabbat beside one sabbat of Easter he is a murtherer of Christ.
If this be true antiquity: why doth the church of Rome omit fast on Sunday: if it be counterfait? why is not M. Sander ashamed to alleage it? Iustinus witnesseth that water was mingled with the wine.
Yea but it was to alay the strength of the wine, not that it was necessary for the Sacrament, though afterward it grew to a superstitious obseruation.
He saith further, the Deacons caried the consecrated mysieries to them that were absent which Caluine reputeth for an abuse.
If they caried the bread the wine as the Sacrament, it was an abuse not to be warranted by Gods word.
But seeing the Deacons office was to minister to the poore: thinke rather they caried it as the almes of the church, to suche as were needy.
What Pius decreed we finde in no writer of credit.
As for the Popes law it is no good euide~ce, hauing a busnel of drosse counterfait dregs to one graine of good and true antiquitie.
In deede Eusebius restisieth, that Victor Bishop of Rome did excommunicate the Bishops of Asia, about the celebration of Easter, but he testifieth also, that Victor was sharply rebuked by diuerse other godly Bishops, namely by Irenaeus of Lyons and Polycrates of Ephesus for so doing.
Tertullian sayth all doctrine is false lying that agreeth not with some Apostolike church.
And such is the doctrine, that the church of Rome holdeth, which agreeth with no Apostolike church, no not with the ancient Apostolike church of Rome.
But our doctrine agreeth with all the Apostolike churches that euer were, planted in the earth and continued in the doctrine of the Apostles.
Tertullian a Montanist, speaketh in deede of oblatio~s for the deade, but they were none other, then suche as they offred for the birth daies, that was tha~kesgeuing.
He speaketh of praier for the deade, which he receaued of Montanus the heretike.
The stations he speaketh of were no gaddings, but standings.
The visitation of Ierusalem is denyed to no man that will take the paynes to go thither, nether was it euer like to Popish pilgrimage, which is to runne a whoring after Idolls.
We confesse with S. Cyprian, that the breade in the Sacrament is chaunged, not in shape but in nature, to be the flesh of Christ vnderstanding nature for propertie, and the flesh of Christ to be receaued spiritually.
In publike offences we woulde haue confession to be made publikely, before the Elders of the church, as Cyprian would them that fell in persecution, but of Popish auricular confession, he neuer spake one word.
We acknowledge the forgiuenes of sinnes by the ministers, to be ratified by God, not binding Gods iudgeme~t to it but it to Gods iudgement.
We grau~t that te~poral punishme~t for satisfaction of the church ought to be appointed vnto publike offenders, which may be released vpon their harty repe~tance, is no more like to Popish pardo~s, the~ the stewes market of Rome is like the church of God.
The rest which he huddleth vp together, wil answer as briefly.
S. Iames his chaire was esteemed, but as a monument of antiquity no holynes put in it.
The sole~ne dedicating of churches was no more like Popish hallowing of churches, then Christian preaching praying is like to conuration.
The straight life of heremites was as like the Popish heremites that dwelt at euery good townes end, where the other dwelled in the wildernes, as the city the desolat wildernes are alike Ruff. li.
Driuing of deuils by holy water, was no ordinary ceremony, but a miracle once wrought by the Bishop of Apamea, who whe~ the temple of Iupiter could not be burned with fire, that was set vnto it, after he had prayed, caused water signed with the crosse to be sprinckled on the altar, which being done, the deuills being driuen away, the temple was set on fire burned: Theodor. lib.
The auctority of vnwritten traditions is so defended by Basil, de sp. sanct.
that he affirmeh whatsoeuer is not of the holy Scriptures, is sinne.
Praier to Saincts, as the dregges of that time, leaue to be sucked vp of the Papistes.
Repentance but no Popish sacrament of penance, is co~mended by S. Ambrose.
The name of the masse is not in Ambrose Ep.
for missa~ facere signifieth to let go, or let passe, not to say masse, ye name of sacrifice signifieth a sacrifice of tha~kesgiuing.
The Canon of the Popish masse is not in Ambrose, but the forme of celebration of the communion in his time de Sacr. li.
Chrysostom reciteth the text of S. Iames onely to proue that God forgiueth sinnes at the praiers of the Elders, not speaking of the ceremony of extreame vnction, vsed by the Papists de Sacer. li.
Hyeronym ad Vilant. alloweth not the superstitious vse of burning candells in the day time.
That he will not allow Bishops to beget children, it sheweth his errors, co~demned by the Nicene councell, by the perswasion of Paphnutius: Socr. li.
Hieronyme speaketh not of a certeine number of prayers, to confirme the vse of your beades, but of a certeine nu~ber of the verses of the holy Scripture to be learned as a talke to the Lord.
That he which hath had two wiues coulde not be a Priest in Hieronymus time yt was a litle of that chaffe, wc afterward ouerwhelmed ye good corne in the church of Rome.
Hierom affirmeth that he, as helper, vnto the writing of Damasus Bishop of the city of Rome, did answere the synodicall consultation that came from the East the West.
What is this to any purpose of the Papistes? Not only the Bishop of Rome was consulted, nor he alwaies, except the matter concerned the whole church, when no member should be lefte vnconsulted, and not made priuye.
Finally that Augustine sayeth, that the fier by which some shalbe saued after this life, is more greeuous then any paine of this life.
Psal. he sayth the contrary de fide ad Laurent. cap where he denieth that text of scripture to be vnderstode of punishment after this life: and saveth the whole matter of purgatory may be enquired of, as a matter vncertaine.
he knoweth heaue~ hell, and vtterlye dnyeth the third place to be found in the scriptures.
By which it appeareth, that this error of purgatory was but very young in Augustines time.
And now you see what antiquity he can boast of, for when he hath wrested wrong all that he can, scarce two or thre errors haue any shadow of antiquity, those not in the greatest matters, wheras the whole substance of the doctrine of fayth in God, iustification by Christ, the true worship of God, the vertue of Christes death, the infirmity of man, the right vse of the sacramentes the auctority of the holy scriptures, a nu~ber more of such principall heades of Christian learning, in which we differ from them, he is as silent as a stone.
M. Iewel confesseth to haue bene of late geuen to the Papistes, which among other thinges, stayed S. August.
But seing the name of Catholikes was falsly geuen to you, which arè nowe ryghtlye called by the name of your archeheretike the pope, papistes, the onely name of Catholikes, which was geuen to you by your selues, to shadowe your heresies, cannot proue you to be Christians, or your church to be Catholike, especially seeing you lacke the truth which Augustine in the same place, confesseth to be more worth then either successio~, antiquity, the name of Catholike, or any other thing else.
The eyghteenth marke is the succession of Priestes, and Bishops, euen from the seate of Peter vnto Pius the fifth in whose time this booke of M. Sander was written, which marke is approued by Augustine, by Irenaeus, by Tertullian, by Optatus by Hieronym, as he sayth, being one of the most euident of all other, but therein he belyeth all these fathers whom he citeth, who neuer alleaged the bare successio~ of place persons, but ioyned with the co~tinuance of doctrine, receaued from the Apostles, against new late sprong vp heresies.
Augustine shall speake for the rest, who after he hath alleaged vnto the Donatistes, the successions of Bishops from Peter in the vnity of the Catholike church, among which was neuer a Donatist, the iudgement of the Bishop of Rome in absoluing of Cecilianus, and many such like reasons, whereunto he thinketh the Donatistes shoulde yeelde, yet in the ende, he addeth these words.
Quamquàm nos non tam de istis documentis presumamus, quam de Scripturis sanctis.
Although we doe not so much presume of this documents as of the holy Scriptures.
These eighteene markes M. Sander will haue to be more richly seene in them, then in the Protestantes, but what markes they are, and how they are to be found in their church, haue briefely shewed.
But nowe he commeth to a general challenge to proue that we haue nothing which they lacke, and we lacke many thinges which they haue.
First they haue a iustifying faith as well as we, but not iustifying alone, but with charity, which is the life of faith.
But charitye is a fruict of a liuinge and vnfayned fayth, not the life thereof.
the effect not the cause, and we holde with Saynct Paule that a man is iustified by faith without the workes of the lawe.
for charitie is no instrument to apprehend the mercie of God, but faith onely, therefore faith onely doth iustifie.
therfore nothing can come in accompt of iustification before God, but onely faith.
which seeing ye Papistes haue not, they haue not a iustifying faith.
We haue two Sacraments, and they haue seuen, but seeing they haue fiue more then Christ instituted, and haue peruerted the one, and polluted the other, they haue but one Sacrament at the most, and that horribly prophaned, meane baptisme.
VVe haue an inward priesthood (he sayth) to offer vp Christ in our hartes, and they offer him both in hartes and handes.
But our spirituall priesthood is not to offer vp Christ, but spirituall sacrifices acceptable by Christ
and they are horrible blasphemers, that take vpon them to offer vp Christ, whome none could offer but him selfe by his eternall spirite.
He sayth, that the Papistes beleeue as well as we, that Christ by one sacrifice payed our raunsom for euer, when they shewe it to the eye in the eblation of their Masse, then the which nothing can be more contrary to the onely sacrifice of Christ once offred and neuer to be repeated, because he founde eternall redemption thereby.
He addeth that they beleue Christ to be the head of the Church, and shewe it by a reall figure of one heade, in earth, meaning the Pope, whome now he maketh a figuratiue heade, as though Christ were not present with his Churche, or that his Churche were a monster with two heades.
As laye men receyue the communion in both kindes with vs, so they de with them in Austria by the Popes dispensation, as though Christes commaundement and institution were not sufficient without the Popes dispensation.
Wherein also he affirmeth a monstrous absurditie, that the Sacrament was not instituted in two kindes, to be so receyued, but by an vnbloody sacrifice, to shewe the nature of his bloody sacrifice in which his soule and blood was separated from his body and flesh, and yet he sayth the body and flesh of Christ, is not well conteyned in the cuppe, as his blood in the paten, with the body and forme of breade, and no separation of the one from the other, and no more contayned or distributed by both, then by one alone.
Which saying is to be receyued with whoopes and hisses, of all men that haue their fiue witts.
They haue mariage (he sayth) in greater price then we, because they teach it to be a sacrament, but we find it not instituted by Christ to be a sacrament of the new testament, therfore we receyue it as an holy ordinance, contayning also a great mystery, but yet no sacrament.
But if it be an holy sacrament, why doe you thinke it vnmeete for ministers of the Church? and why doth your Pope Syricius, or rather some counterfeating Canonist in his name, call holy matrimony a liuing in the flesh, such as can not please God.
But although mariage be honorable in all men (you saye) it is not so in them that haue gelded them selues for the kingdome of heauen, who haue no more possibilitie to marye, then a gelded man to eget children.
You were best then to tel the Apostle that his saying was too generall, for he shoulde haue excepted them that so gelded themselues.
But S. Paule sayth, notwithstanding your impossibilitie, if a virgine doe marye, she doth not sinne.
You will reply he speaketh of them that haue not vowed, how proue you that Christ speaketh of them that haue vowed, longer then God would giue them grace to liue chast, which he affirmeth to be a peculiar gift, not in the power of euery man.
But what if your popish geldings, by neying at euery mans wife, and by tombling in all beddes, where they are not kept out by force, proue them selues to be stone horses, are they still in the number of those, that hauing gelded them selues for the kingdom of heauen, may not possibly marye, and yet nether we will nor can possibly liue chast? But omitting these thinges, which they haue as well as we, now he commeth to those thinges, which we lacke, and yet many of them are very necessary: as insufflations, that is blowing vpon exorcismes, that is coniuring: holy oyle in baptisme, chrisme in Bishopping, externall priesthood, sacrifice, altars, censing, lights, and so forth a large rablement of popish errors and superstitious ceremonies.
And that we saye falsly, in saying these are naught, he proueth by S. Paules saying to the Galathians, praeterquam quod accepistis, beside that you haue receyued. for once (sayth he) we haue receyued those thinges of our auncestors, as if S. Paule had not spoken of the Gospell, but of beggerly ceremonies, which because they are an other Gospell, and way of saluation, brought in by the Pope, then S. Paule deliuered to the Galathians: we hold the Pope the~ iustly accursed.
But we iustifie them (sayth he) by the word of God not written am sure, but by your counterfeit word of traditions, as you say by bookes of auncient fathers, and yet not by bookes of the most auncient fathers: in whome is litle or nothing at all of suche drosse and chaffe, amonge a great deale of good corne.
But seeing we made no new religion in those and such like thinges (sayth he) but keepe the olde: humilitie, obedience, and vnitie is our fault, if we haue any fautles hypocrites, if the older truth had neuer bene reuealed vnto you, against your olde heresies, your faults had bene the lesse. but nowe your darkenes being conuinced of the light, your pride, rebellion, and schisme from Christ and his Church, is and appeareth most haynous and manifest.
Now seeing M. Sander dare not encounter with vs in this very poynt of our contention, he sayneth an Idoll of an aduersary, to shew his manhood vpon, before his friendes, that they may prayse him for a worthy champion.
He imagineth that we reply, that Luther and Caluine did so change popish religion, as Christ and his Apostles did chau~ge the Iewish religion, and then he layeth on lode, that Luther and Caluines authoritie is not like to Christes, whereas we make no such comparison: but affirme, that these godly preachers were sent of God, so to reueale and discouer the idolatry corruptions, mayntayned in the Church, as Elias, Elizeus, Oseas and the other Prophets, were sent to restore and reforme the true worship of God, corrupted and decayed amonge the Israelites, reprouing and reforming all thinges according to the infallible rule of Gods worde.
And whereas he trifleth of the continuance of the sacrifice of Christ, according to the order of Melchisedech, say it is horrible blasphemy, to make any successors vnto Christ in priesthood, which the holy Ghost sayth, he hath [undefined span alphabet], such as passeth not from him by succession to others, because he liueth for euer.
reade the places who will, and he shall finde, that these fathers speake not at all, of any propiciatory sacrifice of Christes very body and bloode in the sacrament, but of the sacrifice of thankes giuing, which the Church throughout all the world doth offer to God, in the celebration of the holy mysteries, for their redemption by the death of Christ.
But it is sufficient for blinde and obstinate Papists, to see the bookes margent paynted with quotations of doctors, by them which peraduenture neuer turned the bookes them selues, but borowed their quotations of other men.
But M. Sander sayth, whereas we pretend that Luther and Caluine doe all things according to Gods worde, they are the more to be abhorred, not only because the one is contrary to the other, but also because they pretende to haue their doings figured and prophecyed in the Gospel, whereas there is but one Christ, which hath bene borne dyed but once, therefore these men haue no power to abrogate the Masse, or to take away the key of auncient religion.
To their dissention, aunswer it is not in many poyntes, but in one that not of the greatest weight as for their pretence of theyr doinges, to be figured or prophetied in the Gospell, it is a dreame of M. Sanders drousie head, for they make none such, but they shew the abuses of the Romish church, by the doctrine of Gods word, by the same they shew the way to reforme them and this, to the glory of Christ, who dyed but once, they abrogate the Masse, by which it should follow, if it were of any force, that he should dye often, for without death sheding of bloud, there is no sacrifice for remission of sinnes.
If we deny the Masse to be that, they say it is, he aunswereth: that as he doeth not reade, that the Iewish priestes did erre concerning the substance of their publike sacrifice.
So is it lesse possible, that the vniuersall church of Christ should erre in that publike act, wherin Christ is sacrificed.
Here is a wise argument, hauing neither head nor foote, nor any ioynt to hange togeather.
For whatsoeuer M. Sander readeth, we reade that Vrias the high Priest, made an heathenish altar in the Temple, at the commaundement of the king Achas, offered sacrifice theron,
VVe reade also in Iosephus, that Caiaphas diuers other of ye high Priestes were Saduces, which could not but erre in the substa~ce of their publike sacrifice, when they beleued not the resurrection.
Seeing the end of theyr sacrifices was, to signifie ye eternall redption by Christ.
Now to the second parte of the argument, say the vniuersall church dyd not erre, though the schismaticall synagogue of Rome departed fro~ Christs institutio~.
But M. Sa~der chafeth vs away, with this double negatiue, no no maisters, Antechrists you may be, christ you ca~not be.
Gods curse light on him, that would haue any other Christ the~ Iesus the sonne of God Mary, which sitteth at the right hand of his father in heaue~.
But it is your Antechrist of Rome, that vsurpeth not only the office, but also receiueth the name of Christ God, of his Antechristia~ Canonists, wc know you will not deny, though your face be of brasse, because boks may be shewed to any ma~y list to se the~.
After his large excursion, he returneth to D. Parker whome he would aduise to reuolt to the popish church, but he (God be thanked) hauing ended his dayes in the catholike church of Christ on earth, is now receued into the fellowship of the tryumphant church in heauen.
passe ouer how maliciously he ayleth against the blessed martyr Tho. Cranmer, for defence of whose learning and godlines, refer the reader to his story faithfully set forth by M. Fox.
All other Archbishops of Canterbury he saith from Augustine sent thither by Gregory were of their popish profession.
Of a great number it is as he sayth, but not of all.
For the opinion of the carnall presence of Christ in the sacrament, was not receiued in the Church of England, for two or three hu~dereth yeeres after Augustines arriual, as that Homely which that reuerend father Matthew late Archbishop of Canterbury, caused to be translated and imprinted, doth manifestly declare.
And whereas hee sorneth at the persecuted congregation of Wickleue, Husse, and the poore men of Lyons, boasting of the externall pompe and visar of glory that was in the Romish Church, haue sufficiently aunsweared before, that bothe the apostacy of the church of Antichrist the persecution of the church of Christ was so described proficied before, that neither the one nor the other should trouble any mans conscience, wt the straungens thereof, so long as the trueth of the little flock the falshod of the reuolted multitude, are manifestly tryed by the authoritie of the scriptures.
The conclusion of all his Preface is, that which was the cause of this treatise that there neuer lacked a chief Byshop in Saincte Peeters chaire, whose supremacy beeing graunted all other controuersies bee superfluous.
Yea verely all Scriptures, Doctors, and Councelles be needlesse, where there is such a person alwaies at hand, who cannot erre in any thing that he commandeth men to beleeue or doe.
And contrariswise if ther be any necessary vse of scriptures, doctors, cou~cels, Learning, Tounges &c. there is no such chiefe Byshop on Earth.
But what saye you M. Sander, did there neuer lack a Pope to sit in Peters Chayre? Was that See neuer voyde many dayes, many monethes, and many yeeres togither? And when there was two Popes or three Popes at once and that oftentimes, who sat in Peters Chaire? You will say one of them: but which you cannot tell.
Whose voyce shoulde the people obey as Christes vicar? The one cursed, the other absolued: the one commannded, the other forbadde.
Is not all your bragging of Peters chaire, and vnitie, thereby proued to be nothing else but a meere mockerie? The Lorde Iesus confounde Antichrist with the breath of his mouth, and with his glorious appearance, and defend his Church in trueth and holinesse, for euer and euer.
THE state of the Question concerning the supremacie of Sainct Peter and of the Byshoppes of Rome after him.
VPon our denyall of the supremacie of the Pope, and of S. Peter, he sayth we deny all primacie and chiefe gouernment in the Church.
Whether it be against the worde of God, that there should be in his Churche any primacie or chiefe authoritie? Whether S. Peter had the same primacie or no? Whether the Byshop of Rome had it after S. Peter.
To which we aunswere with distinction of the words primacie and Church, that we affirme, there is a spirituall and eternall primacy of the vniuersall Churche, which is proper onely to our Sauiour Christ, which neuer was giuen to Peter, nor to any mortall man.
Likewise we arffime that in particular Churches, there is must be a primacie of order, which is temporall according to the disposition of the Church.
And such primacie in the Colledge of the Apostles might Peter haue for sometime, but that he had it not alwayes, it appeareth in the councell of the Apostlesin the
of the Actes of which Iames in a manner by all writers consent, was President and Primate: and vpon the controuersie beeing throughly debated, pronounced the definitiue sentence [undefined span alphabet] &c according to which the synodall Epistle to the Churches of Antiochia, Syria, and Cilicia, was written in the name of the Apostles, Elders and brethren.
First whereas Christ promised that Simon should be called Cephas or Peter, whiche is a stone or Rock.
Ioh. I. and afterward performed his promise, whe~ he chose him to be an Apostle, Mar.
And thirdly when Simon confessed his godhead, the reason of the promise was declared that he would builde his Church vpon that Rocke: the question is, whether Peter himselfe be that Rock, vpon which Christ woulde builde his Church, or Christ himselfe, or the fayth and confession of peter.
M. Sander the spokesman for the Papists, passing ouer the second question, that is whether Christe himselfe whom Peter confessed, by this rock, denyeth the fayth or confession of Peeter to be the perfect sence of that promise, affirming the Rock on which the Church is builded to be S. Peter, not barely confirmed, but in respect of the promise past, the present confession, and the authoritie of feeding Christes Sheepe giuen him after his resurrection, of which foure conditions the Protestantes (hee sayth) doe lack no lesse then three.
But what doe the Papists lack, when in there sence they exclude the rock Christ, the only foundation, then the which none other can be layde.
Yet seeing M. Sand. is so desirous to haue Peter to bee the stone whereof Christ speaketh, laying first Iesus Christ to be the head corner stone, wil franckly yeelde vnto him, that which he coulde neuer win by force, that Christ saying to Peter, thou art Peter, and vpon this Rocke or stone will builde my Church, meaneth euen Peter him selfe vpon whome he would build his Church, but so that he maketh not Peter a singular Rocke or stone to beare the whole building, (for then hee should put him selfe out of place) but one of the prncipall stones of the foundation, euen as all the Apostles and Prophetes were, for so the holy Ghost speaketh, Ephe.
beeing builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Iesus Christe beeing the head corner stone in whome all the building beeing compacted, groweth vnto an holy temple vnto the Lord.
Nowe let vs consider, whether any singular authority was committed to peter, when hee was willed to feede the sheepe of Christ.
M. Sand. saith yea, because it was sayd to him alone, feede my sheepe, and no particular flock named, it must needes be ment the whole flocke.
Christ saide onely to Peter, come after me Satan, for thou art an offence to me &c.
If the Pope must needes haue the one texte as peculiar to him, let him take the other also.
Againe Peter himself sayth to the elders, feede as much as in you lyeth the flocke of Christe
Heere is no particular slocke named, therefore he meaneth the whole vniuersall flocke.
But he vrgeth farther, that as Peter loued Christe more then the rest, so he did feede the flock of Christ aboue all other pastors.
But if labouring in preaching the gospel, be the feeding of Christes flock, not Peter, but Paule laboured more then he, and all the rest of the Apostles.
The answere of the Protestants to his demande, Why Peter alone in presence of other Apostles was commaunded thrise to feede the sheepe, that by thrise confession and iniunction to feede, he might abolishe the shame of his thrise denying, and knowe that hee was restored to his Apostleship, from which he deserued to be depriued) M. Sand. liketh not for three causes.
First he sayth, hee had not lost his Apostleship, because his fault was not externally proued, nor confessed in iudgment, nor stubbernly defended &c. as though Christ which knew and foretolde his infirmitie before he fell, had neede of externall proues, or a Commissaries court to depriue Peter of his office, blockish reason.
Although neither Caluine nor Beza doe affirme, that hee was altogither excluded from his office, by his fault, but that he deserued so to be, and therefore had neede especially to bee confirmed by our Sauiour Christ more then the rest as his offence was more shamefull then of any of the other.
Therefore the seconde reason that hee bringeth of his restitution, if he had lost it is superfluous.
Ioh. For he was none otherwise restored then the rest were, but at this time especially confirmed, as his speciall case required.
His last reason is, that admit Peter had not beene restored before this time, yet nowe he was restored to a greater authority, then any other Apostle had receued at any time, and whereas we reply that all the Apostles were equall by testimonie of Cyprian and Hieromes, he aunsweareth by distinction, forsooth that they were equall in Apostleship, and yet Peter was chiefe of te Apostles, and an ordinary chiefe shepheard or high yshop, wherein they were all inferiours to him, and ee was their Primate and their heade, and this distinction he promiseth to proue exactly heereafter.
In the meane time it is a monstrous Paradox, that all the Apostles should be equall with Peter in Apostleshipp, and yet Peter be the chiefe of the Apostles.
He that can proue inequalitie to be where he graunteth equallitie to be, and in the same respecte, is a straunge Logition.
Fynally where as some men graunting Peter to bee the rock, deny the honor to his successors, he will proue that the Byshop of Rome and none other, hath all that authoritie which Peter sometime had, and consequently that the Protestants come neerer to the nature condition of Antichrist, then any pope of Rome euer did or can doe.
THat there is a certaine primacie of spirituall gouernment in the church of Christ (though not properly a Lordlynesse or heathenish dominion) And in what sort this Eclesiasticall primacie differeth from the Lordly gouernme~t ofseculer princes, and how it is practised by the Bishop of Rome.
That there as one greater amonge the Apostles to be a ruler and as a minister doe not repugne.
King can not be supreame gouernour in all Ecclesiasticall causes, because by right and law he can not practise all Ecclesiasticall causes.
The high Priest is preferred before the King, by Gods law.
The euill life of a Bishop taketh not away his authoritie.
The differences betwene the Bishop of Rome and temporall Princes.
THe Ecclesiasticall gouernment of the Church is a ministery, or seruice, by the authoritie of Christ and his Apostle Peter: therefore neither properly nor vnproperly a Godlines or Hethenish dominion, but altogether as vnlike to it, as our Sauiour Christ the paterne of all true ministers, was vnlike to an earthly Lorde or an Heathen Prince.
But whereas M. Sander in the first sentence of this chapter sayth (That no man properly can te Lord among the Christians where all are seruaunts indifferently, vnder the obedience of one true Lord and Maister Iesus Christ.)
he sheweth him selfe not only to be a Papist, ut also an Anabaptist.
For the co~mon seruice that we oe vnto Christ hindereth not, but that a Christian man ay be Lord King ouer his fellow seruaunts and thren in Christ, as properly as euer he might be before the incarnation of Christ: who saith himselfe that his kingdome is not of this worlde: who himselfe was obedient and taught obedience both to God and Caesar, to eche in things that belonged to them: that dominion which he forbiddeth vnto his Apostles, like to the princes of the nations.
and which S. Peter forbiddeth the elders of the church.
is not prohibited to all Christians, but to the ministers of the Church onely in respect of their ministery.
And yet that there ought to be a gouernment of the church, some kind of primacy also, it is cleerer by the scriptures, then that it neede any proofe, especially such slender proues as M. San. bringeth, namely where he citeth this text, Feed my sheepe, to signifie that Peter should giue euery man his dewe portion iust measure of victuals in co~uenient time: which thing neither Peter did, nether was he able to doe.
And much lesse any man in succession to him, which is not equal in gifts with him.
And therefore the example of a stuarde, who may prouide for a competent number of one family, is fondly applyed to make one Stewarde ouer al the worlde, beside him that is almightie.
For although the Apostles were not lymited to any certaine congregation, but were generall Embassadors into all partes of the worlde: yet were they not appoynted to giue to euery man his dewe portion, but to appoynt Pastors in euery Church and towne for that purpose.
they them selues to proceed in matters pertayning to their generall Commission.
And therefore although M. Sander in applying these woordes of Ieronime Cont.
Of one priest in the Church for that time &c. True.
Euery seuerall Pastor, or as he tearmeth them parrishe priest, dealeth more honestly then other Papists that drawe the same testimonyes, as proper to the Popes soueraigne auctority, yet in that he argueth, that the like should be in the whole church militant, which is in euery parish, it is out of all compasse of reason.
For that which is possible in the one, is altogeather impossible in the other.
And the argument is no better, then if we should say, there is one steward in euery Colledge, or greate house: therefore there is is one steward ouer all the world.
And wheras he would proue his matter good, by that S. Mat. cap.
rehearsing the names of the Apostles, calleth Peter the first: it is to childish friuolous.
For in euery nomber, one or other must be the first it seemeth that Peter was first called to the office of Apostleship: therefore his primacy was of order not of auctority.
where the question is, of the dignity of the Apostles, Iames is named before Cephas, or Peter as he was indeede elected to be the principall minister at Hierusalem, by consent of most auncient writers, neither doeth it folow, that because the high Priest of the old law was called Princeps populi, prince of the people, therefore Peter was made prince of all Christian men.
For neither was the high Priest alone called the prince of the people, as M. S. seemeth to say: neither had Peter by those wordes (feede my shope) any auctority committed vnto him, more then to the rest of the Apostles.
As for the name of Lord, or tearme of dominio~, sometime geue~ by ecclesiasticall writers to the Bishop or his gouernment, we striue not about it, so there be no such dominion by him excercised, as Christ his Apostles forbiddeth, as we see to be vsurped and practised by the Pope of Rome, his clergy, howsoeuer M. Sander in tearmes of distinction, would seeme to shadow it.
But he will shewe out one of these places which we alleadge, as if it did vtterly forbid all superiority amonge the Disciples, luc. that the ecclesiasticall primacy is cleerely establyshed and confirmed.
First he sayth most vntruly, that we deny all superiority amonge the Discyples of Christe as though we denyed all gouernmente amonge Christians, excepte hee doe childishly vnderstande the Disciples of Christ for Ministers ecclesiasticall onely: and yet wee denye not all superioritie among them, but that kinde of primacie which the Pope claymeth, and tyrannically vsurpeth.
Secondly he maketh a longe preamble before he come to the matter, that althoughe the Apostles did diuerse times striue for the primacie, as in the way to Capharnaum Mark.
yet Christ neuer denyed, that there should be one greater among them, and often signifyed, that the same shoulde be S. Peter, especially when he sayde, thou arte Peter, and vppon this Rock will builde my Church.
If you demaunde why they stroue for supremacie, when hee had determined it, he yeeldeth a substantial reason: because while Christe lyued vpon Earth, it was in his free choise to haue appoynted it otherwise, vntill at the last in the
of Iohn, he saide vnto him, Simon thou sonne of Iona. &c. By these it appeareth, that M. Sander confesseth that no text of Scripture proueth the supremacie of Peter more directly and playnely then this of Iohn
which when euery Childe seeth howe little force it hath to proue it, you may easily iudge that the Papists them selues againste their owne consciences, doe inforce all other Textes vttered before to establishe it.
in which he sayth, that Christ taking vppe the strife that was among his Apostles about the primacie, ended his talke at laste with Simon Peter, shewing him to bee that one that was greater then the rest.
What Asse if he coulde speake with mans voyce, would reason thus? that because Christe conuerting his speache from exhorting all his Apostles to admonishe Peter of his speciall daunger he stoode in by his infirmitie: signifyed that Peter was greater then all the Apostles.
But wee muste heare him compare these words of Christe.
with the words of S. Mathew and Marke in other places, which he sayth the Magdeburgen. cent. doth huddle vp, as they were alone, wheras they differ much.
are these: VVhosoeuer among you wil be greater, let him be your seruitor.
And whosoeuer among you will be first, shall bee your seruant.
He that is greater among you, let him be made as the younger: and he that is chiefe, as he that ministereth.
M. Sander will haue greate difference to be in these sayings.
First generally that the former sentence speaketh not of the greatnesse among ecclesiasticall officers, but all Christians, which is vtterly false, because this kinde of greatnes is prescribed vnto them to whome external dominion is forbidden, But that is not to all men, but vnto the Apostles onely and their successors: therefore this kinde of greatnes, is proper only vnto them.
For he speaketh not of greatnes by humilitie onely, but of greatnes without forraine dominion and worldly dignity, and ioyned with seruice, which is peculier to the ministery ecclesiasticall.
Secondly he maketh sixe friuolous differences, which either are false or else make no diuersitie in the sence of the places.
VVho soeuer, S. Luke of one man, which by the article [undefined span alphabet] is pointed out.
If the article [undefined span alphabet] doe alwaies pointe one certaine man, it is somwhat that M. Sand. saith, but If, ten thousa~d times and more, (as euery man meanely learned in the Greeke toung doth know) it signifieth not one certaine man: then is this a fond difference.
The second, the other speake of a desire to be great, VVho so would be great, S. Luke of the effect already present, he that is greater.
ouerthrow this differe~ce, with the former: for ther [undefined span alphabet] the greateste, is taken for any one that shall humble himselfe, as a Childe, and not for one made primate of the Church.
The third difference is, that the letter speake of him that would be [undefined span alphabet] great.
S. Luke of him that is [undefined span alphabet] greater, by which is mente the greatest of all after the Greeke phrase.
But that [undefined span alphabet] in the others signifyeth the greatest according to the Hebrue phrase, it is manifest by the word vsed by both, which call him also [undefined span alphabet] the first or chiefest of all.
The fourth, S. Matthew calleth him that woulde be great [undefined span alphabet] a seruaunte.
S. Luke giueth no name of seruice to him that is greater, but he is willed to be you~ger or vnderling.
calleth him [undefined span alphabet] the least which shall be the greatest.
But what fonde quarrelling is this? Doth not the Pope call himselfe seruaunt of the seruantes of God by which he acknowledgeth that the greatest seruice belongeth to him that claimeth the greatest dignitie. though indeede, he yeelde no seruice, but vsurpeth all tyranny.
Is M. Sander nowe ashamed of that seruice: that the Pope by solemne title hath so longe professed? As for a preeminence of order, we deny not but it was among the Apostles, must be in euery seuerall company: although it be not necessary, that it should be perpetual in one man, but as euery Church shall ordaine: but a primacy of authoritie ouer all the Church, we vtterly deny that euer it was graunted to Peeter or any man by our Sauiour Christe.
M. Sand. citeth Ambrose in Luke to proue it Qui lapsus es &c. Thou which didst slide before thou didst weepe, after thou haste wepte, art set vpright, that thou shouldesirule others, who before haddest not ruled thy selfe.
great myrracle, but doth it follow, that either he ruled al me~, or that he ruled his equals the Apostles, of whome the same Ambrose sayth, De spiritu Sancto lib.
Nec Paulus inferior Petro quamuis is ecclesiae fundamentum hic sapiens architectus siens vestigia credentium fundare populorum.
Neither was Paule inferiour to Peter although hee was the foundation of the church, Paul a wise builder, knowing howe to founde the steps of the people beleuing.
Hic inquam vbi audiuit vos utem quid me dicitis? Statim loci non immemor sui Primatum egit.
This Peter say, when he hearde, but what doe you say that am? immediatly not forgetting his place, executed his primacie.
Verely the primacie of confession not of honor, the primacie of faith not of degree.
By these places of Ambrose it appeareth, what gouernment and primacie was graunted to Peter, and how he exercised the same.
The fift differe~ce, is that the other Euangelists say absolutely let him be a minister a seruaut, in S. Luke it is said, with a great moderation, let him be made as the younger and as he that ministreth.
If this be a good argument, to proue that the ministery is more truly a greatnesse then a ministerie: the Arrians may deny by the like, that Christ is more truely a man then the sonne of God: because Sainct Iohn sayeth: we sawe his glorie as the glorie of the onely begotten sonne of God: beastly absurdity: and yet he sayeth: if any man say, that there was not one certeyne man greater amonge the Apostles, who might be as the younger, it is playne contradiction to Christ and he is Antechrist.
But where on Gods name sayeth Christ, that there is one certeyne man greater among the Apostles? The last the least difference is, that the greater man is euidently named a litle after, when Christ sath to S. Peter, Simon Simon beholde Satan hath desired to sift you as it were wheate, but haue prayed for thee, that thy faith shall not faile.
Maister Sander asketh what other thing it is for Peter to confirme his brethren, but to practise and exercise his greatnesse ouer them? for euerie one that confirmeth is greater, then they which are confirmed.
Who euer did reade such impudent assertions? Peters faith was confirmed by Marie Magdalen: therefore she was greater then Peter.
Paule was confirmed by Ananias, therefore he was greater then Paule.
Aquila Priscilla confirmed Apollo: therfore they were greater then he.
do necessarily proue that there was one certeine man among them greatest: the~ [undefined span alphabet] in the
He that is least among you al (saith our Sauiour Christ) euen he shalbe the greatest.
And least M. Sander should renue his differe~ce of [undefined span alphabet], it may please him to vnderstand, that the contention was among the Apostles, [undefined span alphabet] which should be the greater or greatest of them.
Which question our Sauiour Christ doth not decide, if M. Sanders difference of [undefined span alphabet] and [undefined span alphabet] in this place may stande.
Wherefore hitherto Peter hath found no supremacie, and muche lesse the Pope by prerogatiue of his chaire, who can not be sayd to sit in Peters chaire, except he taught Peters doctrine, which if he did teach as he doth ye contrarie, yet Peters auctority could no more be deriued to him, then the auctority of Moses to euery one of ye Scribes Pharizees wc did sit in Moses chaire.
He citeth Ambrose to proue, that there is a prelacie or preferrement in the church, because he forbiddeth contention thereabout, as though there could not be a prelacy or preferreme~t of euery Bishop ouer his church but there must be one Bishop ouer all the church.
The like he alleageth out of Bede, which speaketh expressely of al the teachers of the church, not of one Pope ouer all.
The conclusion of his disputation is, that the ecclesiastical primacy doth in al points resemble (as much as it possible may) the primacy of Christ, therefore he that denyeth the primacie among the Apostles to be a true primacy in his kinde is blasphemous against Christ him selfe.
Nay rather, he that communicateth with any man, that which is peculiar to our Sauiour Christ, that he only shoulde, be as S. Paule speaketh of him [undefined span alphabet] himselfe the primate in al things Col.
which is ye head of his body, which is, the church is fou~d a manifest blasphemer of our Sauiour Christ.
But that they wc excel among ye Apostles, their successors the Bishops, may be humble and yet great after the example of our Sauiour Christ is no question at all.
But that any hath suche greatnes in auctoritie, as our Sauiour Christ hath cuer his whole Churche, is the thinge we denye.
If Gregorie affirme that Peter by Gods commission had the primacie of the holy church, and was growne in power aboue the rest: it is no maruel, seeing he was so nere to the open manifestation of Antechrist, which succeeded him the next saue one: whose tyranny beganne to encrease longe before Gregories time: yet was he in his pretended primacie more modest, then any that followed him to this day: Vtterly refusing and condemning as prophane, proude blasphemous against Christ, the title of vniuersall Bishoppe: which Ihon of Constantinople did vsurpe, and other Bishoppes would haue geuen to him.
And whereas M. Sander frameth an obiection of our part, that no man can be both a minister a gouernour: therfore no ecclesiasticall minister can be a gouernour, he playeth with his owne shadow.
For we deny not but a minister of the church which is a seruaunt, is also a gouernour.
But we affirme that his gouernme~t is spiritual, not worldly: vnlike to the earthly gouernment of this worlde, euen as the kingdome of Christ is not of this worlde.
But it followeth not, because that euery Bishop shepherd is a gouernour: therefore there must be one Bishop and shepherd gouernour of them all, other then our Sauiour Christ the arch or head shepherd Bishop of our soules.
M. Sander co~mendeth ye saying of Leo B. of Rome to Anastasius B. of Thessalonica.
He that knoweth him seife to be set ouer some men, let him not disdaine to haue some man preferred before him.
But he proceedeth: sed obedientiam quam exigit etiam ipse dependat.
But such obedience as he requireth of other, let him yeeld himselfe.
By this saying it appeareth, that although Leo take much vpo~ him, as to heare the co~trouersies ye can not be determined by the Metropolitans, yet he acknowledgeth, that in equitie, he was bd to yeelde that obedience to others, which he required of others, if he him selfe were in fault.
But M. Sander maketh an other obiection for vs, on this maner.
The Princes of the Gentiles, doe also serue their subiectes in conseruing peace, keeping out their enemies &c. but the clergie must be altogether vnlike to temporal gouernours: therfore there must be no primacie or gouernment among them, although it be ioyned with seruice.
Once againe say, we make no such obiection, but we answere the Anabaptists that so obiect, that the gouernment of the clergy, as it differeth in matter which is spirituall, so also it differeth in forme maner from the regiment temporall, wc is with outward pompe of glory with the material sword: this with all humility with the sword of the spirit.
Contrariwise M. Sander answereth this obiectio~ so as he both strengtheneth the hands of the Anabaptistes, sheweth him selfe litle to differ from their opinion.
First therefore he saith that Christ forbiddeth his Apostles and Bishops such a dominion, as is vsed among the Princes of the earth, not altogether such as ought to be amo~g them.
But that he speaketh not of tyrannical dominion, it appeareth by the title of [undefined span alphabet] benefactors, which their subiectes did giue them, for their bountifulnes towards them in preseruing them from enemies, in peace and wealth.
Secondly he sayth, that although the King be neuer so good, yet it is not the Kingly, but the Priestly power, which God chose fro~ the beginning to rule his people withal.
And although Kings serue Gods eternal purpose, they are commaunded to be obeyed, yet the making of Kinges ouer Gods owne people at the first came not of God by way of his mercifull election, but by way of his angrie permission.
What Anabaptist could speake more heretically or seditiously against the lawfull auctority of Kings Princes? But let vs see his reason.
Nemrod he sayth, was the first King we reade of: which either by force vsurped, or was aduanced by euell men.
aunswere: if Nemrod was the first that vsurped auctoritie as a tyrant: yet was he not the first that exercised Kingly auctority lawfully nether was he ruler ouer Gods people.
But what wil houy of Melchisedech, King of Salem, was not he elected of God at the first, both to be a King a figure of the King of Kings, who should not haue had that dignity, if it had not bene of it selfe both lawfull and godly? Secondly he sayth God was angrie with his people for asking a King, when they had a Priest to rule them.
aunswere, he was not angrie for their asking of a King, but for refusing of a Prince ordeyned by him, which was Samuel a Leuite in deede, of the familie of Cohath, but no Priest of the familie of Aaron.
For in his dayes were high Priestes, Eli, Achitob, Achimelech.
But after the dayes of Eli, which was both high Priest and Iudge.
Samuel was ordeyned Prince or Iudge of the people, hauing auctoritie aboue Achitob or Achimelech the high Priestes in his time, which were sufficient to decide the controuersie of the supremacie, if M. Sander, would geue place to the Scriptures.
But who can discharge him of Anabaptistrie, where he deny eth the making of a King to be Gods institution, affirming it to be, the fact and consent of men allowed in deede by God, when the Apostle expresly sayeth, it is Gods ordinaunce Rom. And where he sayth that Abel, Noe, Abraham, were directly from God chosen to be Priestes as Aaron, he sayeth most vntruly, for they had in their familie, the principalitie of ciuill gouernment as directly, as they had the Priesthoode.
But neither of both in suche sorte, as Aaron had the Priesthoode: in whom the one was distincted from the other.
And of Abraha~ it is testified that he was a Prince ordeyned of God Gen.
He setteth foorth the excelle~cy of Priests by their auctority in making Christs body, with their holy mouth, as Hierom speaketh.
But that proueth not the supremacy of one Priest aboue al men, nor of one Priest aboue an other.
As for the ordeining of Peter to be generall shepherd, and high Bishoppe of the whole flocke, by commaunding him to feede his shepe: when he can conclude it out of that Scripture, in any lawfull forme of argument, we will yeelde vnto it.
But this is intollerable impudencie, that pretending to shew howe much the Pope is more excellent then any king, he asketh to what Christian king did Christ euer saye? As my father sent me send thee.
as though Christ had euer sayde so to Peter in singular, and not to all his Apostles in generall.
Concerning the rocke that he woulde builde his Church vpon, and the feeding of Christes sheepe, and lambes: we shall haue more proper place to examine afterward, what supremacie they giue to the Pope or to Peter ether.
His farther rauing against the dignitie of kinges, who list to see, let him turne to the
And yet can not omit that he sayth, that the pompe of a king is most contrary of all other degrees to the profession of Christian faith: and maketh worldly pompe as vnmeete for a king as for a Bishop.
But the Scripture (he sayth) neuer calleth any king head of the Churche, nether doe we call any Kinge heade of the Church, but onely Christ: but in euery particular Church, the Scripture alloweth the king to be the chiefe Magistrate, not onely in gouerning the common wealth, but also in making godly lawes for the furtherance of religion, hauing all sortes of men as well Ecclesiasticall as ciuill, subiect vnto him, to be gouerned by him, and punished also, not onely for ciuill offences, but also for heresie, and neglect of their duties in matters pertayning to the religion of God.
For although many ciuill Magistrats at the first, were enemies of the Gospel: yet was it prophecyed, that kings should be nursing fathers and Queenes nursing mothers vnto the Church.
Againe it is an impudent and grosse lye, when he sayth that God was angry because the gouernme~t of the high Priest was reiected, a kingly gouernment called for.
For they reiected not ye gouernme~t of the high Priest, but of Samuel ye Iudge: who was no high Priest, although he was a Prophet, nether was there euer any high Priest Iudge but only Eli.
But if all supremacie be forbiddn ouer the whole Church militant (sayth M. Sander) it is forbidden likewise, that there should be any superior in any one part of the Church.
And this he proueth by a iolly rule of Logicke.
For the partes (according to their degree) are of the same nature whereof the whole is.
subtile reason by which wil likewise co~clude, there may not be one scholemaister for all the children of the worlde: therefore there may not be one schoolemaster for one towne in all the world.
There can not be one Phisicion for all the world: therefore there may not be a Phisicion for euery citie: yea there can not be one Priest for all the Churches in the world: therefore there may not be a Priest in euery parishe.
Againe he reasoneth thus: If a king be supreame head ouer his owne Christian Realme.
it must be by that power which he ether had before his christianitie or beside it.
For by his christianitie it is not possible, that he should haue greater power then the Apostles had.
aunswer: the kinges supremacie is perfectly distinct from any power the Apostles had.
For although he haue authoritie ouer Ecclesiasticall persons, and in causes Ecclesiasticall, according to Gods word: yet is he no Ecclesiasticall officer, but a ciuill Magistrate, hauing chiefe authoritie in all causes, not absolute to doe what he will, but onely what God commaundeth him: namely to prouide by lawes, that God may be truely worshipped, and all offences against his religion may be punished.
And whereas M. Sander inferreth, that an Ethnike Prince or Turke may be supreame heade of our Church, we vtterly denye to any such the name of an head, which can not be a member, but euen an Ethnicke Prince or a Turke may be chiefe Magistrate ouer the faithfull, and make lawes for the mayntenance of Christian religion, as an hypocrite Christian may.
They are also to be obeyed in all things that are not contrary to God.
Nabuchadnezer, Darius, Cyrus, Artaxerxes, which were heathen Princes, made godly lawes for the true worship of God furtherance of his people: as in the prophecie of Daniel, the bookes of Ezra and Nehemiah, it is manifest.
that the Christians in a matter of a Bishopps election, and for a Bishops house, were directed by the decree of Aurelianus an heathen Emperour.
And this notwithstanding, the Church is alwayes vnder the soueraigne authoritie of Christ, and the spirituall gouernment of her seuerall pastors and teachers, when Christ ascending into heauen, ordayned for her edification and vnitie, and not one Pope ouer all.
But now he will enter one degree farther, and suppose, that a king may be as good as it is possible for any mortall man to be, or as any Bishop and Priest is, yet he can nether baptize, consecrate, forgiue sinnes, praise, excommunicate, blesse, nor be Iudge of doctrine by his kingly authoritie.
If he can doe none of those: he can not be supreame gouernour in all Ecclesiasticall causes.
For his supremacie is not to doe those thinges, or any of them, but to prouide and commaund, that they may be doon as they ought to be.
But he riseth vp againe and sayth, that whosoeuer hath soueraigne authoritie, either in ciuill matters or Ecclesiasticall, he may in his owne person execute any of those thinges, which any of his inferiours may do.
So he saith, the king if he wil, may be Iudge in VVestminster hall, shrieue and constable, yea he may play the tayler, maister Carpenter or tanner.
It is maruell he sayth not that he may be both a king and subiect.
Likewise the primate, (he might as wel say the Pope) may helpe a Priest to Masse, cary the crosse in procession, digge a graue, &c.
For there are some thinges, that the Prince may not doe for lacke of knowledge, and some thinges for lacke of calling, and yet he may commaund both to be done.
For controuersies of lawe he may not decyde, except he haue knowledge of the law, nor minister Phisick, except he haue knowledge in phisicke, yet he may command both Lawyers Phisitions to doe according to their knowledge, likewise to preache, baptize, &c. he may not, because he lacketh calling, for none may doe those thinges lawfully, but he that hath a speciall calling, but he may commaund those thinges to be done, to be well done, according to Gods lawe, whereof he ought not to be ignorant, and for that purpose is especially commaunded to study in the booke of Gods lawe, that not onely in matters concerning his owne person, but in matters concerning Gods honor, he may cause all men to doe their duetie.
So did Dauid, Salomon, Iehosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias, commaund the Priestes to offer vp the sacrifices and to doe their duetie, which it was not lawfull for their kinges to execute.
And is it so straunge a matter, that a popish king may not commaund his Chaplayne to saye Masse, or to saye his Masse reuerently, and orderly as the lawes of popery doe require? if he may commaund ouer tho matters, which yet he may not doe him selfe, let M. Sander see how his rule holdeth, that whosoeuer hath authoritie in any matters, may doe all thinges him selfe, which any of his inferiours may doe, or which he may commaund to be done, whereupon he concludeth, that the king hath no right or supreame power at all in Ecclesiasticall causes, (vnlesse it be committed to him from the Bishop) so that a king if he be a Bishops commissary, may doe that by M. Sanders exception, wc nether by commaundement of God, nor his kingly power he hath auctoritie to doe.
Another argument he bringeth as good as this, that the lesser authoritie doth not comprehend the greater, and therefore Horne must aunswer him, whether to preache, baptize, forgiue sinnes &c. be greater or lesser ministerie then the kinges authoritie.
If it be greater: then it can not be comprehended in the kinges authoritie, which is lesser.
What that reuerend father the Bishop of Winchester hath aunswered, it may be seene in his booke against M. Feckenham.
But to talke with you M. Sander, what if graunt, that the Ecclesiasticall ministery, is not comprehended in the kinges authoritie? will you thereupon inferre, that the kinges authoritie is not to commaund the ministers of the Church in these matters, to doe their dueties according to the worde of God? In deede you conclude so, but your argument is naught.
For the king is Gods Lieuetenant, to see both the Church and the common wealth to be wel ordered.
And the same thing may be greater and lesser then another in diuers respectes.
As in authoritie of commaunding, the king is greater then the Phisition: in knowledge practise of phisicke, the king is lesse then the Phisition.
So in authority of co~maunding the prince is greater then the minister: but in authoritie of ministration he is lesse, and no inconuenience in the world, to the dignitie of other estate or calling.
The Bishop of Winchesters examples, M. Sander saith are euil applyed.
For they only shew what was done, and not what ought to haue bene done: and so for many circumsta~ces are subiect to much wrangling.
For either he was no good Prince which medled with disposing of holy matters,
or he did it by co~mission from a Prophet or an high Priest,
But all these quarells notwithstanding, the examples of Scripture are so many, and so playne, that M. Sanders angling can not obscure them.
Dauid a good Prince, did well in appoynting the Leuits and Priestes to their seuerall offices, and forbidding the Leuits to cary the arke and the vessells thereof without any co~mission from Priest or Prophet, but onely by the word of God, not deceyued by flatterers, nor enforced by necessitie,
He deposed Abiathar the high Priest, set Zadoc in his roome.
And such are ye examples of all the godly kinges of Iuda. which being co~mended in the Scripture, are not vncertayne, deceitful, or vnknown in their circumstances: but much more certaine arguments for the authoritie of Princes in Ecclesiastical matters, then this text wc he citeth (Feede my sheepe) to forbid them.
But here he will aske whether a Christian king be Peters sheepe or no? answer by propriety no but a sheepe of Christes as Peter is.
Neuerthelesse, admit Peter to be a sheepeheard, and the king to be his sheepe, what then? forsooth it is against the lawe of nature, for a sheepe to rule his sheepeheard.
graunt in those thinges in which the one is sheepeheard, and the other a sheepe.
But aske of him, is not a king also in some respect called in Scripture a sheepeheard? if he doubt, Esa.
may resolue him, and is not Peter and Paule in this respect also sheepe? If he deny it: let the Apostles speake for them selues: let euery soule be subiect, &c. Rom.
If nowe shoulde reason that it is against the lawe of nature, that the sheepe should rule his sheepeheard: am sure he would answer with making a diuersitie of respectes.
You may then see what a wise argume~t he hath made, that may be turned backe on his owne head Wherefore here is no such impossibility as he inferreth, but that a King in some respect of ecclesiasticall gouernment may be aboue his owne pastor, as in other respect he is vnder him.
M. Sander will goe forward for all this, putteth case that a Bishop shoulde come to a Christian King, as Ambrose did Ep. to the Emperour Valentinian offering his body and goods to his pleasure, but the thing which the Emperour vnlawfully required, he would not yeeld vnto, what could the Emperour doe to him? He coulde not excommunicate him.
And if he imprisoned him or put him to death: he did but as Nero or the Turke might doe.
Therefore if the King be neuer so much Christened, hee hath no power ouer the Byshops soule.
If it were possible for the Pope to require an vnlawfull thing: might put the like case of his holinesse.
What if a Christian man should come to him &c. he might excommunicate him as Cayphas did all that confessed Christe: hee might imprison him, as Annas did the Apostles: hee might commaund him to be smiten as Pashur did Ieremy, and Ananias Paule &c.
Therefore if hee were neuer so much a Pope, he hath no power ouer a Christian mans soule.
But if Auxentius the Heretike shoulde haue come to the Emperour, had the Emperour none authoritie to call a synode to inquire of his heresie, he being found an heretike, to haue condemned him therefore? In these doings he had done as Constantine about Arius, and Donatus, and not as Nero with Peter and Paule.
If we call to mind ether the processe of holy Scriptures, or the auncient times, who can deny, but that in a cause of faith, in a cause saye of fayth, Bishops are wont to iudge of Emperours, not Emperours of Bishops.
And who sayth the contrarye, but that in causes of faith, the Emperour is ordinarily to be instructed of the Bishops, and not the Bishops of the Emperour? Or that the Prince hath absolute authoritie in matters of religion, to doe what he will, when we say that in all thinges he mnst follow the direction of Gods worde, the knowledge whereof, especially in difficult matters, he is to receyue of the Ministers of the Church, as of the Lawyers the knowledge of law, although he be bownd to see iustice executed.
But M. Sander will know how a king shall correct or depose a Bishop.
aunswer, if his cryme be apparant, euen as Salomon deposed Abiather, if it be doubtfull, by order of iudgement and tryall according, of ciuill Iudges, if it be a ciuill cryme, and Ecclesiasticall if it be heresie that he is accused of, if he can not be condemned vpon iust tryall, he is to be absolued, if this will not satisfie the king, he hath no farther lawfull authoritie by any supremacy, and if he proceede further, he exerciseth tyranny.
And Augustine doth iustly complayne of the importunitie of the Donatists, which when the cause had bene decyded by certayne Bishops, deputed by the Emperour, they would neuer be satisfied, but still appealed to the Emperour, accused the Bishops that were appoynted their Iudges before the earthly king.
M. Sander vrgeth that word vehemently, that he calleth Constantine an earthly king, and yet he is so blinde, that he will not see, that the same earthly kinge, which assigned those Bishops to be Iudges, was still acknowledged of all partes, to be the supreame gouernour, Ep.
But omittinge the wordes of men, he will proue the dig nitie of highe Priestes aboue faithfull Princes, by the authoritie of God in the olde Testament.
Because there God assigneth a sacrifice for the sinne of euery degree of men, according to their dignitie.
And first beginneth with the highe Priest, next whom is the whole people, thirde the Prince, and last of all euery priuate man.
There is no doubt but the highe Priest, as he was an image and figure of Christ, was chiefe in dignitie.
Although in other respectes he was inferior to the Prince, as Aaron was to Moses, Achitob or Achimelech to Samuel, Abiather and Zadoc to Dauid and Salomon.
The like is confessed of euery minister of the Gospell, and therefore the authoritie of Philo and Theodoretus which he vseth in this poynt, might haue bene spared.
And yet may a wicked minister be deposed by a godly Prince.
Abiathar in the temple, at the altar, in the holiest place, and sacrificing, was greater then Salomon, yet was he iustly deposed by Salomo~ for his treason.
Maister Sander chargeth vs to affime, that the euill life of a Bishop, taketh away his authoritie, wc he denieth to be so, as long as the Church doth tollerate and permitte them in their places, whereupon he concludeth, that though the Bishop of Rome haue neuer so much abused his office, yet he can not leese his primacye.
In deede the abuse of the man, taketh not away the authoritie of the office, but if the office be peruerted from the right vse, and degenerated into an heathenish tyrannye, as the Bishop of Romes place hath bene many hundreth yeares, the name of a Bishop onely and that scarsely remayning, we iustly affirme that such dignitie as that sea had by consent of men, it hath cleane lost, by abuse of their authoritie.
Moreouer he sayth, it hath no coullour of truth, that we affirme the Pope to gouerne, not as a Pastor, but to beare a soueraintie, as Princes of the worlde, and that he will shewe by six differences, which he will consider in order.
First no man succeedeth in that chayer, by right of inheritance.
The like may say of the Germane Emperour, therefore this is no difference.
Secondly it is not obtayned by right of battaile, inuasion or otherwise, but by election.
So is the Emperour at this daye, onely by election.
And if Maister Sanders be not to impudent, he wil not deny, but there hath bene bickering and intruding by force, into that chayre, and that is worse entering, by symony, murder, treason and deuilish sorcery.
The thirde, nether childe, nor woman, nor Infidell, nor Catechumeni can be chosen Bishop of Rome.
No more can any suche be chosen Emperour by the golden bull and lawe of the election.
And yet seeing boyes are made Cardinalls, which be electours of the Pope, and elegible, there is none impossibilitie, but a boye may be chosen Pope, as well as a woman hathe beene Pope, Ione meane.
was condemned in the councell of Constans for an Infidell, which denied the immortalitie of the soule.
The fourth, the election of the Bishop of Rome as of all other Bishops, pertayneth onely to Ecclesiasticall persons, a king may be chosen by the people without the Clergie.
To this saye, that the Bishop of Rome was wont to be chosen as well by the people as by the Clergie.
And so is the Emperour chosen by as many Bishops as ciuill Princes, except in case of equalitie of voyces.
Nether is the Clergye euer excluded in any lawfull election of any kinge where he is made by election.
The fift, to omit the Bishop of Romes temporall dominion, which he confesseth to be but accessory to his Bishoprike, in his Ecclesiasticall gouernment, he vseth not that force and power which worldly Princes do.
He compelleth none, no not ye Iewes in Rome to baptisme.
But what meanes vseth he to depose kinges, absolue their subiects from their othe of obedie~ce, where he iudgeth them for heretikes, how maketh he warres and setteth all the worlde in an vprore, to defend his vsurped dignitie false doctrine? Doth he not by force compell Christians to his filthy Idolatrye, or els cruelly murdereth and tormenteth them? The
the Bishop of Rome (as Bishop) neuer punisheth them with the materiall sword, which forsake his Church, No, but as Antichrist and a tyrant he imprisoneth them, hangeth them, drowneth them, burneth them, not as a Bishop sayth M. Sander, but as a temporall Prince and Lorde, as Moses being one of the Priestes of our Lord was also maister of ciuill gouernment.
Behold, this deuisor of differe~ces at length maketh him a ciuill Prince and temporall Lorde, from whom he had labored by so many differences to distingush before.
But now lest you should espye his impudent conclusion, he draweth into a new controuersie, whether Moses were a Priest.
And first he will proue that Moses was a Priest, by the Scripture Psal.
If he will not allowe the Hebrue worde Cohanim to signifie Princes, as it doth, in diuerse other places, yet sayth not the Psalme that Moses and Aaron were both Priestes, but that amonge his Priestes they were suche as called vpon his name, and were hearde, and Samuel who followth in the same verse, confessed nowe by Maister Sander to be a Leuit, forgetting that before he made him highe Priest.
But farther to proue that Moses was a Priest, he citeth Augustine, Ieronym, Gregor.
Naz. Dionys. and Philo, but all to small purpose for his cause.
It must needes be confessed, that Moses as all the Patriarkes before him, in their families, was a Priest, before the distinction of the two offices was made, when Aaron and his posteritie onely were choosen to bee Priestes.
After which tyme he was no longer a Priest, nether did he any thing as a Priest, but as a Prophet, and as a Prince.
But admit, he were both a Prince and a Priest, yet he commaunded Aaron as a Prince and not as a Priest.
For Aaron was highe Priest, and therefore coulde haue no Priest aboue him.
By which it is inferred, that the office of a Prince is to commaunde the highe Priest, and so was it alwayes practised by all godly Princes.
But Maister Sander returning to his last and least difference, affirmeth that the Bishop of Rome neuer condemneth any man for herefie or schisme to corporall death in his owne person, nor teacheth that they may be condemned of other Ecclesiasticall persons.
But who vnderstandeth not this mockerie? for as well it may be sayde, the Kinge neuer hangeth any man in his owne person, therefore none are executed by his authoritie, as the Pope neuer condemneth any to death in his owne person, therefore he perswadeth not his religion with fire and sworde.
But will the Pope and the Bishoppe, that are so mylde and gentle, suffer them whome they condemne for heresie to escape their hands, before they haue deliuered them to death? cruell and shameles hypocrites.
Neuertheles Maister Sander sayth, they haue power ouer mens soules by that which our Sauiour sayd to Peter.
To the will giue the keyes of the kingdome of heauen. &c. which wordes are deryued to the Bishop of Rome, by meanes of the chayre of S. Peter.
straunge kinde of deriuation neuer touched in the Scripture, to which words the sayde Bishop referreth all his power, where as worldly Princes appeale to the lawe of the Gospell nether in getting, nor gouerning, nor establishing their dominion and power.
Is not this the lawe of the Gospell? There is no power but of God, and the powers that be are ordayned of God.
And is not this the lawe of the Gospell for their gouerning? that gouernours are sent of God for the punishment of euil doers, and for the prayse of them that doe well.
And for the establyshing of theyr dominion, is not this the law of the Gospel, giue vnto Caesar the thinges that belong to Caesar.
And againe, we muste be subiect of necessitie, not onely for feare but euen for conscience Rom.
As for the Popes pietie and lenitie, wherewith hee ruleth, when all the world seeth how proudely and tyrannicall yhe behaueth him selfe, it were folly to spend many wordes about it.
As for his gentle tearmes of sonnes and brethren, wherewith hee saluteth Princes, and Byshops, and the seruaunt of the seruants of God, which he calleth him selfe: be simple and shorte clokes to hide his horrible presumption and tyranny, wherewith he not only most sha~efully reuileth most Christian Princes, as it appeareth in that trayterous Bul, which came from him against our moste gracious soueraigne Lady, but also taketh vpon him to depose them from their estate royall, vsurping to him felfe the name of holynesse, of heade of the Church &c. of Christe, of God him selfe, and calleth Princes his vassalles. &c. of which blasphemies his Cannon Lawes are stuffed full.
And therefore it is too farre in the day, for M. Sander to make vs thinke there is no difference betweene white and black, Pride and Humilitie, Gentlenesse and Crueltie, Holynesse and hypocrisie, fayth and falshode, vice and vertue.
OF the diuerse senses whiche are in the holy Scripture, and namely about these woordes (vppon this Rocke will builde my Church) and which is the moste literall and proper sense of them.
TO contende about the diuersitie of senses, it were to take vppe a newe controuersie.
admitte that whiche Maister Sander confesseth, the lyter all sense onely to be of force to conuince the aduersary.
And the literall sense not to bee alwayes according to the grammaticall sounde of the wordes, but according to the moste playne meaning of the speaker.
As when Christe sayeth to Peter, thee will giue the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen, hee meaneth not materiall Keyes of Yron, but authoritie in the Kingdome of Heauen, as Keyes are deliuered by the Maister to his Stuard, but not as keyes of a citie are deliuered, which betoken the giuing of possession of that Citie to be gouerned by him which receiueth the Keyes (as Maister Sander sayth) For that was no part of Christes meaning, to resigne the gouernment of his Church to Peter, for such giuing of Keyes is of the subiectes to their Superior, but to make him one of the Stuardes of his great house, to open and shut, according to his apoyntment.
Otherwise, onely Christ hath the key of Dauid, which openeth and no man shutteth, and shutteth and no man openeth Apocalips
Likewise when he sayth: Thou art Peter, confesse and agree with Maister Sander, that the lyterall sence is not, thou art a naturall stone, but thou art that towarde my Churche, whiche a stone is towarde the house that is builded vppon that stone.
But so that Peter is not the onely foundation, nor the Corner stone, which is onely Christe, but one of the twelue stones of the foundation, as it may more playnely appeare in the Apocalips the
Furthermore confesse, that what soeuer by necessary conclusion may be gathered, of any true literal sense, is of equall authoritie in the word of God, with that wc is expressed in playne words.
As the consubstantialitie of Christ with God the Father, the blessed trinitie, and such like, But whereas M. Sand. ioygneth to these, not onely the perpetuall virginitie of the virgine Mary, which is not certainly, though probably to be gathered, but also transubstantiation, the sacrifice of the Masse, and Purgatory, against which the sense of the scripture is manifest, will not admit them for examples.
But to come to his purpose, he findeth in the auncient Fathers, foure diuerse senses of these woordes (vpon this Rocke will builde my Church) whereof three hee reiecteth, as vnperfect which haue auncient writers, as he confesseth for their Authors, the last hee hath no auncient writer to defende.
The firste, that Christe is that Rock on whome the Church is builded, which Augustine holdeth.
The second, that euery Disciple of Christ is the rock, which is Origens opinion.
The third, that Peters faith or confeffion is the rock, which is Chrysostoms iudgement.
The fourth, which is his owne, and therefore he calleth it the perfecte sense, is, that Peter concerning his office in Gods Church, through the promise of Christ which is past, and the faithfull confession of his Godhead, which is presently made, and the power of feeding his Sheepe, which then was to come, is this Rocke vpon which the Church is builte.
Heere wishe the reader to note, that the Papiste reiecteth three senses of three seuerall auncient writers, and maketh the fourth him selfe, that you may see, with what equitie they exclaime againste vs, if vppon neuer so good ground, we departe from the interpretation of the auncient Fathers.
But nowe let vs see what reasons hee hath to confute these three Doctors oppinions as vnsufficient interpretations.
Firste he sayeth, If Augustines sense were true, all the three other shoulde be voyde, In deede his owne sense, vnderstanding Peter to be a singular Rocke, more then the other Apostles is made voyde thereby, as it is false.
But the other two may stande very well well with Augustines meaning, for hee meaneth not Christe barely, but Christe whome Peter and euery true Disciple of Fayth confesseth, to be the rocke of the Church, Neither doth the worde thou, hinder this sense.
Seeing Augustine vnderstandeth Peter to be a denominatiue a Petra, of the stone, nor the woorde, will builde, for notwithstanding he hadde begunn to builde his Church before, yet hee woulde builde stil, and that more magnificall then before.
The sence of Origine hee reiecteth, as not literall vppon which will not stande.
The sense of Chrysostome hee refuseth, sayinge, the Fayth of Peter is not the onely Rocke, wherevpon the Churche shall be builded, for then it had beene buylte vppon the Fayth of Iohn Baptiste before this time.
pythy argumente, as though there is any more then one Fayth Ephesians
whiche is the same in Peter and in Iohn, and in all the other Apostles, the same saye in kinde, not in number.
Neither did Chrysostome meane, that the singulare Fayth of Peter were the Rock of the Church, but the same one Fayth and confession embraced of euery member thereof.
That he sayeth will builde, whereas hee had already begunne to builde, and did then presently build, What inconuenience is it but in a quarrellers minde.
Hee speaketh of the Future tenses, to signifie the great amplyfication of his Church which he woulde make by the preaching of the Apostles.
But of all senses Maister Saunder lyketh his owne beste, asperfect and contayning all the other therein.
For first sayth he, if Peter be the Rocke, then Christe that made him is much more, as the geeuer and authour of his power.
But deny that Christe did giue the same that he is him self, that is, to be the onely singular foundaion, Rocke, and corner stone of his Church.
Secondly he sayth, if Peter in respecte of his confession be a Rock, then his confession is a Rocke.
But then say I, they that make the same confession are as much a Rock as he.
Thirdely he sayth, if Peter beeing captaine Disciple of all that euer were, be a Rock, then all other Disciples that are contayned in him as in ye chiefe, may also be this Rock.
Who had thought Peter had bene such an vniuersal thing to containe al disciples in him? Doth not this containe manifest blasphemie? to make all Disciples contained in Peter, whiche are contayned onely in Christe, as the members in their mystirall body, whereof hee, onely is chiefe heade, Soueraigne, Captaine, or what other name of superioritie can bee deuised.
But nowe that hee hath made such a monstrous iumbling of three opinions in one, he is not ashamed to charge Maister Iewell, for leauing the moste literall sense, and mingling three, opinions of these foure in one, as though his sense which is farthest of from the meaning of Christ, were the onely or moste literall sense.
But seeing hee wisheth Maister Iewell or any of vs to discusse the meaning of Christe particulerly with all circumstaunces, for my parte considering all circumstaunces, think the most simple and plaine meaning of Christe is, that Peter it a Rocke or stone, vppon which the Church is buylded, but none otherwise, then euery one of the Apostles is, Ephe,
Of which M. Sander also confesseth euery one to be a Rock in his kinde.
But nowe let vs see the fiue circumstaunces, by which Maister Saunder will proue Peter for to bee such a Rocke, as none of all the reste of the Apostles is but he.
The firste, Christe promised Symon before he confessed, that he shoulde be called Peter, whiche was the firste cause of beeing the Rocke Iohn I. Admit this to bee a promise, not an imposition of a name, in respect of the giftes of fortitude constancie where with he woulde endue him, this proueth him not to be a singular rocke.
The second, he was named Peter before he co~fessed, which was the performaunce of the promise.
dout not but that he had co~fessed Christ before he was made an Apostle, although he had not made that solemne confession expressed in Matthew
And his brother Andrewe which first brought him to Christ, confessed Iesus to be the Messias before Peter was come to Christ.
The thirde, when he had confessed the Godheade of Christ which was the fruct of the gift of the promise, Christ pronounced him to be such a rocke, whereupon he would build his church, which was the reward of his confession.
But all the Apostles made the same confession, therefore the same reward was geuen to all, that they should euerie one be a rocke or stone, on which the church should be builded.
The fourth, Christ prayed that Peters faith might not fayle, which was the warrant of the perpetuitie of his strong confession Luc.
the speciall prayer for Peter, was in respect of his greater weakenes, when he was left to him selfe.
The last, to shew what strength Peter should geue, to his brethren after his conuersion, Christ bad him feede his lambes, wherby he was made such a rock, wherby he should stay vp his church, by teaching ruling ye faithful, as whose voyce the sheepe should be bound to heare in payne of damnation.
First answere, that the strength or confirmation which he should geue to his brethren, was not all one, with his feeding of the lambes, but was vsed to the strengthening of his weake brethren, the rest of the Apostles whom after his maruelous conuersion, he did mightely confirme, though in his fall he was shewed to be the weakest of all.
Then say, the feeding of the sheepe of Christ, was committed to him with the rest of the Apostles, in which he had no prerogatiue of auctoritie geuen, but an earnest charge, to shewe his greater loue, by greater diligence in his office.
So that hitherto Peter is none otherwise a rock, then euery one of the Apostles is.
DIuerse reasons are alleaged to proue (chiefely by the circumstance and conference of holy Scripture) that these wordes (thou art Peter and vpon this rocke will builde my church) haue this literall meaning, vpon thee Peter, being first made a rocke, to thend thou shouldest stoutely confesse the faith, and so confessing it, will build my church: the promise to be caelled Peter, was the first cause.
VVhy the church was built vpon him, the Protestants can not tel: which is the first literall sense, of these wordes, vpon this rocke will build my church.
FIrst it is to be remembred, that M. Sa~der in the chapter before, reiecting the interpretatio~ of three of the greatest Doctors of the church, Origen, Augustine, and Chrysostom, not only is bound in equity, to geue vs the same liberty which he taketh him selfe, but also to confesse, that these three principal doctors, following other senses, then his, were ignoraunt of that which he all other Papists, make to be the chiefe article of Christian faith, namely of the supremacie of Peter, when they acknowledged not Peter to be the rocke wherupon Christ would build his church, and therfore would neuer haue subscribed to his booke, which he instituteth the rock of the church.
Chrysostomis cited to proue, that, where Christ sayth to Peter, thou art Simon the sonne of Iona, thou shalt be called Cepha, which is by intepretation Peter, a newe name is promised to Simon, in Ioan.
For the certeine foretelling of things to come, is the worke only of the immortal God.
It is to be noted, that Christ did not foretell at this first meeting all thinges which shoulde come to passe afterwarde to him.
For he did not call him Peter, neither did he say, vpon this rocke will builde my church.
For that was both of more power, and also of more auctoritie.
There is nothing in this sentence, but that we may willingly admit, Peter was not yet instructed that he might be one of the twelue foundations of the church, as he was afterward.
And that Chrysostom iudged no singular thing to be graunted, by that saying of Christ Mat. to Peter, appeareth, by his wordes in Euang.
Tonitrui enim filius est Christo dilectissimus, columna omniu~ quae in orbe sunt ceclesiarum, qui caeli claues habet.
For the sonne of thunder is most beloued of Christ, being a piller of all the churches which are in the worlde, which hath the keyes of heauen.
Neither doth Cyrillus, whom he citeth, make any thing for his purpose.
And he telleth afore hande that his name shalbe Peter and not nowe Simon: by the very word signifying, that he would build his church on him as on a rocke and most sure stone.
These are the wordes of Cyrillus, but that he meaneth not his person, but his faith, he sheweth manifestly in his booke de Trinit. lib.
Peiram opinor per agnominationem nihil aliud, quam inconcussam firmissimam discipuli fidem vocauit, in qua ecclesia Christi it a firmata fundata esset, vt non laberetur.
thinke he called a rocke, by denomination nothing els but the most vnmoueable and stedfast faith of that disciple, on which the church of Christ should be so established and founded, that it should not fall.
Here is an other principall Doctor ioyning with Chrysostom, against M. Sander, who affirmeth, that the rocke is nothing els, but Peters faith.
Theophylact and Euthymius two late writers, but he citeth nothing out of them presently.
But after shewing the force of Gods promise to be effectual, to work al meanes necessarie for the performaunce of it, he citeth out of Euthymius in Luc
Christ promised that Simon should be called Peter, in Luk. called him Peter.
All this needed not, we doubt not but Simon was called Peter.
that he being Prince and heade, first cried out saying, thou art Christ the sonne &c. Therfore he was head before his confession, by promise and name.
will not here say, how contrary M. Sander is to him selfe, which in the cap.
sayd, that his supremacie was graunted to him as a rewarde of his confession.
But will aunswere Cyrillus by him selfe, in Ioan. lib.
that Peter was Ordine maior, superior in order, to auoyde confusion, not in degee, dignitie or auctoritie.
And whereas M. Sander vrgeth so vehemently, that the name of Peter was not geuen for his confession, but was singular to him by promise, so that it belonged literally to no Prophet, Apostle nor disciple but only to him, his successors, it is a most fond friuolus matter, for the name of Bonarges, was specially geuen to the sonnes of Zebedee, in respect of their excellent giftes, and at the same time that the name of Peter was geuen to Simon, which secing it perteineth not to their successors, which haue not the same giftes, no more doth the name dignity of Peter perteine to any that sit in his chaire, if euer he had any fixed chaire among the Gentiles, which by Gods ordinaunce, was appoynted to be the principall Apostle of the Iewes.
Moreouer where he laboreth tooth nailc, to proue, that these wordes (vpon this rocke will build my church) are to be referred to Peter, as sayd before, will graunt euen as muche.
But that Peter by these wordes, was made a singular rocke more then all the Apostles, vpon which the whole church is builded, vtterly deny, neither shall he be euer able to proue it.
For it is an impudent lye, that onely Peter at this time, had this high reuelation, to acknowledge Christ to be the sonne of God.
For he aunswered in the name of all the rest, who beleued the same which he in their name confessed.
Did not Andrewe before Peter acknowledge him to be the Messias? Did not Nathaniel which was none of the Apostles, acknowledge him to be the sonne of God and the King of Israel.
But he reasoneth substantially, when he saith thou only art the rocke, because thou alone hadst this name &c. promised, thou alone hadst it geuen, thou alone didst confesse me to thee alone say thou art Peter.
As though a man may not haue a name, whose signification is common to many.
Salomon alone was promised to be called and was called Iedidiah, that is the beloued of God, shall we therefore reason that Salomon onely was beloued of God, as for that he onely confessed, haue shewed before, that it is false, for Christ saying, thou art Peter, meaneth not to say thou onely art a rocke, but thou well aunswerest thy name, which signifieth a rocke or stone, and wil in deede vse thee as a rocke or stone, to builde my church vpon, yet not meaning the person, but the office and doctrine of his Apostleship.
reasons, to proue that Peter is the rocke, here spoken of, wc althogh they may for the most parte be easily auoided, yet will graunt that Peter is one of the twelue stones, whereupon the church is builded, but not the only stone.
Christ sayth of him alone, thou art Peter, therefore Simon alone is the rocke of the church, let him proue the co~sequence if he can.
which proue that these wordes are to be referred to Peter, although that they be not verie strong, yet graunt the wordes may be aptly referred to Peter, the reasons are
(by saying to Peter, Feede my Lambes, feede my sheepe) made him the heade stone of Gods militant Church nexte vnto Christe.
The eleuenth, that Peter is shewed to be the Rocke spoken of, by geuing of the Keyes, confesse: ebut seeing the keyes are giuen to all the Apostles, this proueth Peter to be none otherwise a Rocke, then euery one of them, That Iohn receued the Keyes shewed euen now out of Chysostome.
The twelfth, that the propertie of a Rock in constant withstanding of tempests, agreeth with Peter, graunt and so it doth to the rest of the Apostles, for whome Christ prayed as he did for Peter, who also strengthened and confirmed their brethren as Peter did.
confesse that hell gates shall not preuayle against the Church, nor against any member thereof, which is a small reason to make Peter supreame heade thereof.
which is the authorities of those doctors that teach Peter to be the rocke whom he nameth when he citeth their sayings, or quoteth their places, will seuerally consider.
their reason also when see them, to deriue Peters authoritie to his successors, will waighe likewise.
deny that all generall councells, or any generall councell for
yeares after Christ, acknowledged Peter to be the rocke in that sence, the Papistes do now.
if the confession of Peter be the rocke, yet it is none inconuenience, that the church shoulde be builded theron, which began to be builded on the same confession offered by Iohn Baptist.
though you confound the diuerse senses geuen by the fathers in your fourth sense, yet that proueth not your sense to be true.
seeing the Apostles are certeyne foundatio~s and rockes vpon which the church is builded, confesse that Peter must needes be one, but that he was the most principall rocke in respect of his name Peter, which is a stone, say it followeth no more then that Salomon was best of al men beloued of God, because of that name Iedidiah, which signifieth beloued of God.
that all the Protestantes doe not agree in the interpretation of these wordes (vpon this rocke will builde my church) it proueth not your exposition, to be true, for neither do all the old Doctors, nor yet the new Papistes agree in one, the same interpretation of this text.
And oftentimes it may inuincibly be proued, that an heresie hath no grounde out of suche a text of Scripture, although the true and naturall sense thereof can not be found at all.
IT is proued out of the auncient fathers, that S. Peter is this rocke, whereupon the church was promised to be builded, otherwise then M. Iewell affirmeth.
THat Peter was a rocke or stone, vpon which the church was builded, is graunted of vs, but that he alone was a rock for the whole church to be builded vpo~, we deny, and M. Iewell rightly affirmeth, that the olde Catholike fathers haue written and pronounced not any mortall man as Peter was, but Christ him selfe the sonne of God, to be this rocke, whereon yt whole church is builded.
But M. Sander will proue (if he can) out of the old writers, that not onely Christ is the chiefe rocke, but Peter also is an other rocke, so that the church by his doctrine, is builded vpon two rockes, and this he will shew,
by the same places which M. Iewell alleageth for the co~trary opinio~.
The decretal epistles of Anacletus, Pius, Fabianus, &c. which in his owne conscience he knoweth to be forged, he omitteth, and beginneth with Tertullian De praescrip. aduers. haeres.
Latuit aliquid Petrum aedisica~dae ecclesiae Petram dictum? Was any thing hid from Peter which was called a rocke of the church which was to be builded? This is graunted that he was a rocke or stone, whereon the churche is builded, and the same Tertullian in his booke de pudicitia sayth, of this whole text, that this was conferred to Peter Personally, and perteineth to none other, but such as he was, namely an Apostle or Prophet.
Secundum enim Petri personam spiritualibus potestas ista conueniet, aut Apostolo aut Prophetae.
For according to the person of Peter, this power shall belong to spiritual men either to an Apostle or to a Prophet.
Where is then the succession of the B. of Bome? But Hippolytus saith: Princeps Petrus, fideipetra.
He meaneth a strong preacher of faith not a rocke whereon faith is builded.
That great foundation and most sound rocke, whereupon Christ hath builded his church.
Si autem super vnum illum Petrum arbitraris vniuersam ecclesiam aedisicari deo, quid dicis de Iacobo Ioanne filus tonitrui, velde singulis Apostolis? Verè ergo ad Petrum quidem dictum est.
Tues Petrus super hanepetram edifiabo ecclesiam meam, pertae inferorum non praeualebnt ei: tamen omnibus Apostolis omnibus quibus q, perfectis fidelibus dictum videtur, quoniam omnes sunt Petrus petrae, in omnibus aedificata est ecclesia Christi, aduersus nullum ecrum qui tales sunt, portae preualent inferorum.
But if thou thinke the whole church is builded by God vpon that one man Peter, what sayst thou of Iames and Iohn, the sonnes of thunder, or of euerie one of the Apostles? Therefore it was in deede truly sayd vnto Peter.
Thou art Peter vpon this rocke will builde my church, and the gates of hell shall not preuaile agaynst it, yet it seemeth that it was spoken also to all the Apostles, and to all the perfect faithfull because they are all Peter and stones, and on them all, the church of Christ is builded, and agaynst none of them which are suche, the gates of hell shall preuayle.
By this you see howe Origen is none of his, howe so euer he abuse his name.
Ep. which sayeth that the church was builded vpon Peter.
Which we confesse as vpon one of the foundation stones, but the same Cyprian De simplicitate praelatorum sayth.
Hoc erant vtique caeters Apostoli quod fuit Petrus, pari consortio praediti honoris potestatis, sed exordium ab vnitate proficiscinur, vt ecclesia vna monstretur.
The rest of the Apostles were euen the same thing that Peter was, endued with equall fellowship both of honor and auctoritie, but the beginning procedeth from one, that the church might be shewed to be one.
This speaketh Cyprian vpon the very text now in discussing.
Petrus &c. Peter lieth vnder the building of the church and in ca.
in nuncupatione &c. happy foundation of the church in hauing the new name pronounced, and rocke worthie of the building of that church, which should dissolue the lawes of hell.
But the same Hilarie sayeth of Christ, de trinit. lib.
Vna haec est foelix fidei petra, Petri ore confessa, tu es filius Dei viui.
This is that onely happie rocke of fayth, confessed by the mouth of Peter, thou art the sonne of the liuing God.
Vpon this rocke of confession is the building of the church.
Haec fides ecelesiae fundamentum est, per hanc fidem infirmae aduersus eam sunt portae inferorum.
This fayth is the foundation of the churche, by this fayth the gates of hell are of no force agaynst it.
This fayth hath the keyes of the kingdome of heauen &c.
Therefore not the person of Peter is the rocke, for all the church to be built vpon. S. Ambrose hath the next place, whome he citeth Scr.
If Peter then be a rocke vpon which the church is builded, he doth well to heale first the feete, that euen as he doth conteyne the foundation of faith in the church, so in the man he may confirme the foundation of his members.
Of the auctoritie of this Sermon will not dispute, it shall sufice that Ambrose in Ps.
Quod Petro dicitur, Apostlis diitur, non ptestatem vsurpamus, sed seruis mperio.
That which is sayd to Peter, is said to the Apostles, we vsurpe not power, but we serue vnder commaundment.
By this saying of Ambrose, Peter is so a rocke and foundation, as the other Apostles are, not a rocke to beare all the building him selfe.
Petrus petra est &c. Peter is a rocke through Christ the rocke.
For Iesus geueth his owne dignities, he is a rocke and maketh a rocke.
This proueth not Peter to be the onely rocke of the militant church, as M. Sander would make him.
AEdificabo ecclesiam mean super te, wil build my church vpon thee.
Behold sayth M. Sander the church promised to be built vpon a mortall man.
If he say true, Christ sayth in vaine that flesh and blood made him not Peter.
But the same Hieronyme interpreteth that power there geuen, to Peter, to perteyne to euerie Bishop and Priest, as much as to Peter.
At dicis super Petrum fundatur ecclesia, licet id ipsum in alio loco super omnes Apostols fiat, cuncti laues regni caelrum accipiant, ex aequo super eos ecclesiae fortitudo slidetur: tamen propterea inter dudecim vnus eligitur vt capite co~stituto seisinatis tollatur occasio: But thou sayest the church is founded vpon Peter, although in an other place the same is done vpon al
Apostles, they al receaued the keyes of the kingdom of heauen, the strength of the church is grounded equally vpon the~, yet for this cause, one is chosen among the twelue, that the heade being appoynted, occasion of diuision might be taken away.
You see now that Peter is no more a rock or fundation, then the rest, neither hath any more auctoritie of the keyes then the rest, alhough by his iudgement, he was chosen to be the chiefe or first in order to auoyde strife, not in dignitie or auctority.
Princeps &c. Peter Prince of the Apostles, vpon whome Christ sounded the church, a verie immoueable rocke and a strong confession.
M. Sander woulde haue vs note, that Peter is called confession, that when he sayth the church is builded vpon faith confession, we might vnderstand no mans saith and confession, but Peters.
As though all the Apostles had not the same faith made not the same co~fession.
But notwithsta~ding that Chrysostom doth ofte~ acknowledge Peter to be the Prince of the Apostles, yet he willeth vs, to co~sider that his principallity was not of auctority but of order.
Iam illd considera, quàm Petrus agit omma excommuni disipulorum sententi, nihil auctoritate sua, nihil cum imperio.
Now also co~sider this, how euen Peter doth all things by the co~mon decree of the disciples, nothing by his owne auctority, nothing by commaundement.
ad Gal. he doth not only asfirme that Paule was equall in honor with Peter, but also that all the rest were of equall dignitie.
Iamque se caeteris honore parem ostendit, nec se reliquis illis, sed ipsi summo comparat, declarans quod herum vnusquis q, parem sortitus sit dignitate~.
And now Paule sheweth him selfe equall in honor with the rest, neither doth he co~pare him selfe with the rest, but euen with the highest himselfe, declaring that euery one of the~ hath obteined equal dignity.
The Lord himselfe did constitute him chiefe of the Apostles, a sure rocke vpon which the church of God is built, and the gates of hell shall not preuayle aganst it: now the gates of hell are heresies and auctors of heresies, for by all meanes faith in him was established which receaued the keye of heauen.
That Peter was chiefe of ye Apostles in order, we striue not, that he was a sure rocke we graunt, but that he alone was the rocke of the church we deny.
The same Epiphanius acknowledgeth the Bishop of Rome to be fellow minister with euery Bishop, and no better, and therefore setting forth the epistle of Marcellus to Iulius Bishop of Rome, he giueth this superscriptio~.
To his most blessed fellow minister Iulius, Marcellus wisheth ioy in the Lord.
The place of Cyrillus which followeth, haue sette downe, and aunswered iu the chapter before.
In Peter the prince of the Apostles, our Lord in the Gospells hath promised that he will build his Church.
Damascn and Euthymius later writers are alledged to the like effect, all which proue nothing but that Peter is a rocke, which we confesse as euery one of the Apostles is.
The~ followeth Augustine in his retractations, which leaueth it to the choyce of the reader, whether he will vnderstand Peter figuring the person of the Church, to be the rocke spoken of by Christ, or Christ who~ he co~fessed.
But that Peter as Bishop of Rome, should be the rocke he sayth nothing.
Againe leauing it to the readers choyse, he sheweth he had no such perswasion of the rocke of the Church, as M. Sander teacheth.
After him Prosper Aquitanicus, Leo with Gregory two Bishops of Rome, say nothing but that Peter was a rocke, which we graunt without controuersie.
Peter the Apostle is a rocke and a shoare of the Churche, which M. Sander translateth the toppe of the Church.
In deede the legats of the Bishop of Rome vttered such words, which may be well vnderstoode as all the rest of the fathers, that Peter was one of the twelue foundations of the Churche.
But that the councell acknowledged not the Bishop of Rome to haue such authoritie as is pretended, appeareth by the
action of the Chalcedon councell, where notwithstanding the B. of Romes Legats reclaymed, Leo him selfe refused to consent, yet by the whole councell it was determined that the Archbishop of Constantinople should haue equall authoritie with the Archbishop of Rome in the East, onely the title of prioritie or senioritie reserued to the Bishop of Rome.
To conclude, M, Iewell sayd truly, for all M. Sanders vaine childishinsulting impudent rayling, yt no mor tall ma~, but Christ only is the rocke foundation of the Church, albeit that Peter all the Apostles in respect of their office, doctrine, were fou~dation stones wheron the Church was builded, Iesus Christ being the corner stone and onely one generall foundation.
THe diuerse reaso~s which the fathers bring to declare why S. Peter was this rocke, do euidently shew that he was most literally this rocke, whereupon Christ would build his Church.
THat he was a stone or rocke, wheron the Church is builded, hath bene often graunted, but that he onely was such a stone is stil denyed.
is cited, with his reason Petrus &c. Peter receyued the building of the Church vpon him selfe, for the excellencye of his faith.
aunswer, so did the other Apostles for the excellencye of their fayth, for continuance whereof, Christ prayed as well as for Peters faith.
sayth Supereminentem &c. Peter by confession of his blessed faith, deserued an exceding glory.
And so did the rest of the Apostles by their confession of their blessed faith, obtaine an exceding or passing glory, vltra humanae infirmitatis modu~, beyond ye measure of mans infirmitie, wc wordes also Hilary hath, left you should thinke he preferreth Peter in auctoritie before ye other Apostles.
For Peters fayth confession he did before interprete to be the rocke of the Church, wc because it was common to all the Apostles, he maketh their authoritie equall.
Vos sancti beati viri, ob sidei vestrae merituns claues regni caelorum sortiti, ligandi aique soluendi in caelo in terra ius adepti.
you holy and blessed men, which for the worthines of your faith haue obtayned the keyes of the kingdom of heauen, and haue attayned to auctoritie to bind and loose in heauen and in earth.
And if you vrge that Peter spake, when all the rest helde their peace: yet is that primacye but of order, not of authoritie for they all beleued as Peter confessed, and Peter confessed in the name of all the rest.
The Churche which is one, is founded by our Lordes voyce, vpon one which hath receyued the keyes of it.
This reason (sayth he) can beare but one such rocke, for if there were more rocks at once, there should be more churches But it is reason, that Cyprian should expound him selfe, which by founding meaneth the beginning of the foundation, as he sayth, de simplicitate pr elat.
say to thee (sayth he) that thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will build my Church, and the gates of hell shall not preuayle against it.
To thee will giue the keyes of the kingdom of heauen, and whatsoeuer thou shalt bind vpon earth, shall be bound in heauen: and whatsoeuer thou shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen.
And to the same after his resurrection, he sayth: Feede my sheepe.
And although he giueth to all his Apostles after his resurrection equall power, and sayth, as my father hath sent me, so also doe sende you, receyue the holy Ghost.
Whose sinnes you forgiue they shall be forgiuen, and whose sinnes you retayne they shall be retayned: yet that he might shewe the vnitie, by his authoritie, he disposed the beginning of the same vnitie, beginning at one.
For verely the rest of the Apostles, were euen the same thing that Peter was, endued with equall fellowship both of honour and of power: but the beginning procedeth from vnitie, that the Church might be shewed to be one.
By which we see that there is but one beginning, yet all the Apostles are equall.
This vnitie of beginning of building, Tertullian also lib. de pudic. sheweth to haue bene in Peter, when he was the first that preached after the ascention of Christ.
Our Lord hath commended vnitie in Peter him selfe: there were many Apostles, and it is say to one, feede my sheepe.
Here he will haue Peter to represent Christ, the onely good shepeheard: although the wordes importe no such thing, but onely a mystery of vnitie, which is but friuolously gathered by the author of that booke, or homely, vntruly ascubed to S. Augustine: where yet he will not haue Peter to be the head, but to beare a figure of the body of Christ, which is the Church.
Na ipsum Petrum cui commendauit oues suas, quasi alter alteri vnum seum facere volebat, vt sic ei oues commendaret, vt esset ille caput, ille figuram corporis portaret, id est Ecclesiae, tanquam sonsus sponsa essent duo in carne vna.
For he would make euen Peter to whome he commended his sheepe, as one to another, one with him selfe, that he might so commend his sheepe to him, that he him selfe might be the heade, and Peter might beare the figure of his body, that is, of his Church, and so they might be as the bridegrome his spouse, two in one flesh.
These words shew how vaine M. Sanders collection is for Peters headship, beside that he citeth the wordes otherwise then they are in the author, euen as his note booke serued him.
aunswering the obiection of Iouinian, and intending to proue that Iohn the virgine was as excellent as Peter the maried man.
But thou sayst, the Church is built vpon Peter: Albeit the selfe same thing in another place, be done vpon all the Aposiles, all doe receiue the keyes of the kingdom of heauen, and the strength of the Church be grounded equally vpon them, yet therefore one is chosen among twelue, that a head being made, the occasion of schisme may be taken away.
First that the Church is so built vpon Peter the rocke, that in the same place where it is built vpon Peter, the like is not done vpon the other Apostles.
But seeing he him selfe before vrged the future tence, will build, this collection is false.
Christ promiseth that he will builde his Church vpon Peter, but when he buildeth, he vseth all the Apostles as well as Peter.
Secondly that the church is equally built vpon all the Apostles, therefore not more on Peter then on the rest.
But if all be equall, he as keth how one may be head? aunswer, euen as the foreman of the Iury in some respectes is chiefe, and yet they are all equall.
But he aunswereth they are equall in authoritie, as Apostles, but not as Bishops.
But seeing the office of euery Apostle is aboue the office of euery Bishop, it will followe, that euery Apostle as Apostle, is aboue Peter as Bishop of Rome, which were a perilous matter for Maister Sander to admitte.
Howbeit concerning this distinction of his, more is to be sayd in a more proper place.
In the meane tyme, he vrgeth, that Peter was chosen of Christ to be heade, to auoyde strife and schisme, which reason seeing it holdeth alwayes, there ought alwayes one heade to be chosen, to be a heade and perpetuall rocke, by succession.
aunswer the reason of auoyding schismes, may gayne so much, that in euery Church, such as the first of the Apostles was, such an head for such purpose may be chosen, but it will not inforce one heade being a mortall man, ouer all the Churche, which no one man can keepe in vnitie, and how conuenient the headship of the Romish Church is to auoyde schismes, let so many schismes as haue bene made euen for the attayning of the same headship, beare witnes.
As for Leo Bishop of Rome, it is well knowen, hee was too much addicte to maintaine the dignitie of his Sea, and yet he was farre from the tyranny which the later byshops vsurped and practised vnder pretence of Peters supremacie.
Super hoc Saxum &c. Vppon this stone, this soundnes and strength, will builde an euerlasting temple, and the hight of my Church, which is to reach to Heauen, shall rise in the strength of this Rocke.
great extolling of Peter, vsuall to the Byshops of Rome, but yet no more is saide of him then may be truely faide vpon euery one of the Apostles.
Our Lorde saide to Peter bearing the figure of the whole Church.
Ecclesiae &c. Peter the Apostle by a generalitie that was figured, did beare the person of the Church, by reason of the primacie of his Apostleship.
Heere he maketh much adoe aboute his primacie, by reason whereof he beareth the figure of all the Church, willing to inferre that because hee was primate of the Apostles, and in respect of his primacy represented the whole Church, therefore he was soueraigne ruler and generall officer of the whole militant Church.
But it followeth not, that euery one which is made an atturney or Proxei to receiue a thing for a whole comminaltie, is thereby made generall ruler of al that comminaltie.
The Papistes them selues in the Councell of Basill discharge vs of this conclusion, where they agree to the sentence of Iohn Patriarch of Antiochia which citeth Augustine to witnesse that Peter receiued the Keyes as minister of the Church.
Non enim siae causa inter omnes Apostolos huius ecclesiae Catholicae personam sustinet Petrus, Huic enim ecclesie clauis regni caelorum datae sunt.
Et cum ei dicitur ad omnes diitur, Anas me, Pasce oues meas.
For not without cause amonge all the Apostles, Peeter sustaineth the person of this Catholike Churche.
For to this Churche the Keyes of the kindome of Heauen are giuen.
And when it is saide vnto him, it is saide to all.
By this sentence it is playne, that Christe after Augustines minde, preferred not Peter in power before all the rest, but to receiue equall power with the reste, hee made him as it were the Attornye of the rest.
So that all these reasons duely considered, the sayinges of the Doctors which affirme Peter to be a rocke or stone, on which the Church is builded, doe not prooue that hee was an onely foundation of the whole Church, but with the rest of the apostles, he was one and the firste of the twelue stones, whereon the Church was founded, and that in respect of his office and doctrine, not of his person, as he wasa mortal man.
Iwell, to proue that Peter was not this Rock, proue against him self that Peter was this Rocke, although they proue that there was an other kinde of Rock also beside him, which thinge wee denye not.
THE first authoritie is Gregorius Nyssenus in loc. vet. test.
Thou art Peter, and vpon this rock will build my church.
For he had sayd before: Thou art Christe the sonne of the liuing God.
M. S. replieth that it is neither said, that Peter was not this Rock: nor that Christ was this rock.
But that the confession of Peter was the Rock, whiche he graunteth, and therefore Peter much rather muste be the rock.
For his confession which commeth from his soule and heart, as from a fountaine or springe, is greater then the acte of confession.
Firste deny his Argument: because Peters confession came neither from his soule nor hart, but from God, which reuealed the trueth vnto him, as Christ saith.
Flesh and bloode &c. Secondly say, Gregory meaneth by Peters confession, him which Peter confessed, namely Christe which is the onely Rocke of the Church, whereon the whole Church is builded, as his wordes doe sounde, for he had sayde before: Thou art Christ &c.
But M. Sander reasoning like a learned Clarke, findeth faulte with M. Iewels argumente, comparing it to this: There commeth eloquence from a man but he is not eloquent: Peters confession is the Rocke, therefore Peter is not the Rocke.
Would a man thinke that a Doctor in Diuitie, should either be so ignoraunt in the Arte of reasoning, or so impudent in peruerting a good reason, that a very Childe might reproue, either the one or the other? appeale to Logicians, whether this reason of M. Iewels: The Rock commeth from Peter by confession, Ergo, Peter is not the Rock: be like this argument Eloquence commeth from Cicero, therefore Cicero is not Eloquence, and not as M. Sand. inferreth: Ergo, Cicero is not Eloquent.
therefore the man him selfe is eloquent: So Peters confssion is the Rocke, therefore Peter hselfe is the Rocke.
deny the resemblance, for there is resembled the Adiectiue in the one, and the substantiue in the other.
But thus he shoulde compare them, Tuilyes defence of Mylo is an eloquent oration: therefore Tully is an eloquent Oration, which reasoning is no more absurde, then this of M. Sand.
Peters confession is the Rocke, therefore Peter is the Rocke.
Contrarywise you may reason: Peters confession was the Rock, therefore Peter was Rockey or stony.
This is that onely blessed rock of Faith that Peter confessed with his mouth.
M. Sander caueleth, that this is not spoken vpon the wordes said to Peter, but vpon the wordes spoken by Peter.
But beside that the whole context of the place is against him, both in that, lib.
Super hanc confessionis Petram ecclesiae edifiato est, vpon this Rock of confession is the building of the Church, which M. Sand. would auoyde by bringing in of two rocks, Christ Peter: the particle exclusiue shutteth him cleane out of the dores, for Hillarie sayth not, that Christe is a Rocke, but that he is the onely Rocke.
Therefore this is but one Rocke and one building, and not as M. Sand. sayth two Rocks and two buildings, for aswell hee might say two Churches.
Now where Hilarie vpon Mathew acknowledgeth Peter to be a rock and foundation of the Church, it is answeared before, that he was one of the xii. foundations spoken of Apoc.
in a farre other meaning then Christ is the onely Rock.
The rock is nothing else, but the strong assured faith of the disciple.
This saith M. S. is that would haue, for this disciple was S. Peter, and the rock here spoken of is nothing else, but S. Peters faith, therfore it is not Christ.
Nay rather the rock is nothing but S. Peters faith, therfore it is not his person so no mortall man.
For those woordes, nothing but Peters faith, do not exclude Christ because faith cannot be without necessary relation vnto Christ, but they exclude the person of Peter as a mortall man, because flesh blood reuealed not this confession vnto him, but the Heauenly father.
Vpon this Rocke, that is, vpon this faith and this confession will builde my church.
saith, he that beleeued confessed was Peter and not Christ, ergo the rock is Peter not Christ.
Although this argument haue no consequence in the world, yet to admitte that it doth followe, will reply thus, but he that beleeued and confessed was not Peter onely, therefore Peter onely was not this rock.
is Aug. de verbis dom. Christe was the rocke vpon which foundation Peter him selfe was also builte.
M. San. asketh if one Rock may not be built vpon anonother, as Peter vpon Christ? yes verily, but Peter none otherwise then the reste of the Apostles, who were all foundation stones, laid vpon the great corner stone or onely foundation Rock Iesus Christ.
wil not builde my selfe vpon thee, but wil build thee vpon me.
following the allegory of building co~fesseth that Christ is the first greatest stone, vpon which by all proportion, the seconde stone that should be laide, must be greatest that can be gotten next the first.
If this be so, it is meruaile the Angel which shewed vnto Iohn the building of the heauenly Ierusalem, shewed him not this second stone by it selfe, but the xij. stones lying equally one by an other vppon the maine foundation.
whereby we see that M. Sand. vttereth nothing but the visions of his owne head.
M. S. reciteththis se~se as not literal, seing Peter is a disciple, the first, he wil proue Peter next to christ, to be ye chief rock.
In deed according to this sense it must needes be, that Peter is one principall rock, among so many thousand rocks, but because he is named first in the Catalogue of the Apostles, it is a sory reason to make him so to excel, that he is one rock that beareth al the rest.
But M. Iewel is frantike in M. San opinion, that denying any mortall man to be this rock, nowe proueth euery mortall man that is Christs disciple to be this Rock.
Nay rather M. Sand. is brainsick, that cannot vnderstand this reason, euery Christian is such a rock as Peter was, therefore Peter in being a rock was not made Pope or hed of the vniuersal church.
Origines procedeth, vpon such a rock all ecclesiasticall learning is built.
But S. Peter is such a Rock, (saith Maister Sander) ergo vppon him all ecclesiasticall learning is built.
VVho would wish such an aduersary as M. Iewel is, who proueth altogither against him selfe? Nay who can beare such an impudent caueler that findeth a knot in a rush; For your conclusion is graunted (M. Sand. that all ecclesiasticall learning is builte vppon S. Peter, but so it is builte vpon euery true Disciple of Christe by Origens iudgement.
Againe Origine sayth: If thou thinke that the whole Church is built onely vpon Peter, what then wilte thou say of Iohn the sonne of thonder, and of euery of the Apostles? First M. Sand. chargeth the Bishop for leauing out in English this worde Illum, so that he shoulde haue saide, vpon that Peter, whereby he accuseth him to deny, that Peter is a Rock, whiche is an impudente lye.
Secondly when this authoritie doth vtterly ouerthrowe his whole building of the popish rocke, he can say nothing, but that Iohn was a mortall man, and so were all the Apostles aswel as Peter, therfore M. Iewel saide not truely, that the olde sathers haue written, not any mortall man, but Christe himselfe to be this Rock, when Iohn and all the Apostles be rockes.
As though there were no difference betwene the onely foundation and rocke of the whole Church, which is Christ, all the other stones that are built vpon it.
Last of all Origen sayth: Shall we dare to say, that the gates of hell shall not preuayle onely against Peter? or are the keyes of the kingdom of heauen giuen onely to Peter? M. Sander aunswereth, It is enough that the gates of hell shall least of all preuayle against Peter, he hath chiefly the keyes of heauen.
But what reason hath he for this impudent assertion? Peter of all the Apostles first confessed in the name of the whole Church.
Admit this were true, as it can neuer be proued, that this was the first time that any of the Apostles confessed Christ: yet no primacy of superiority is hereby gayned. if the sentence as Origen expounded it, perteyneth to euery faithfull disciple: What aduauntage M. Sander hath taken of the Bishops allegations, let the readers iudge.
THe conclusion of the former discourse, and the order of the other which followeth.
In the first he repeateth what he woulde haue men thinke, he hath gained in his former discourse concerning Peter to be the Rock of the Church where on it is builte.
In the second for continuaunce of the building promised, there must be alwayes some mortall man, which beeing made the same Rocke by election, and afterwarde by reuelation, shoulde make the same confession, whensoeuer hee is demaunded, or consulted in matters of Religion.
If this were true there were no necessitie of the holy Scriptures, neither yet of Synodes and Councelles, if one Pope were abe to resolue all the demaundes mooued by all menne of the worlde.
In the thirde he sayeth, if there muste be some such one Rocke, it is not possible it shoulde be any other but the Bishop of Rome: First, because he alone hath beene the firste and chiefe in all assemblyes.
Thirdly, and the consent of the world hath taken him so, euer indeede, but by the aduersaryes confession aboue a thousande yeeres.
But God be thanked, the Churche hath no neede of any such Rock, neither is any such taught.
Ephe. the fourth, where the order of the building thereof, and of all necessary builders of Fayth and doctrine are fully sette foorth.
And the three reasons are all false, in manner and forme as they are vniuersally set downe, as in their proper places shalbe shewed.
In the the fourth he gloryeth, that he hath chosen to proue that poynte which of all other is moste hard.
That all the Apostles were not the same thinge that Peter was.
And firste he will aske in what Gpspell or holye Scripture it is written, that euery other Apostle was the same Rocke, which Sainct Mathewe testifyeth Sainct Peter to haue beene.
answeare, not onely by necessary collection out of many places of Scripture, whiche he him selfe acknowledgeth to be the literall sense, as well as that which followeth the sounde of wordes, it is proued, but also in plaine wordes of Sainct Paul Ephe. the second, verse.
Where the Churche is builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophetes, Iesus Christ beeing the head corner stone.
Where the twelue precious stones, the foundations of the wall of the Cittie, had on them the names of the xij. Apostles of the Lambe.
is either thus or nothing at all, for it is not noted in him as the other bee.
If Cyprian or Hierome were alleadged for this equallitie, it were sufficient for him to say, they were no Euangelists.
For he sheweth it written: thou shalt be called Cephas and thou art Peter.
You see these men that bragge of the Doctors, will be holden by them, as long as they liste.
whereas all holy Scriptures is on the popish Catholicks side, he lamenteth the vnhappines of these dayes, in wc men altogither vnlearned in them, by the bare naming of Gods word, haue among Pedlers won their spurres, and amonge the ignoraunt haue gotten the opinion of knowledge.
As truely as none but Pedles and ignoraunt men imbrace this doctrine which we teach, so truely all Scriptures be on M. Sand. side.
Among so many Princes, noble men, and excellent learned men as at this day acknowledge this doctrine to be the trueth: M. Sanders head was very sleepy, when he could see none, but Pedlers and ignoraunt persons.
The seuenth he will take vpon him to shew, by what meanes Sainct Peter excelled the other Apostles, and sheweth in what order he will proceede, which seeing it is contained worde for worde in the titles of the seuen Chapters next following, though it needelesse heere to rehearse.
THat Saincte Peter passeth farre the other Aposlles in some kinde of ecclesiasticall dignitie.
THat S. Peter had some excellent gieftes, peraduenture more then some of the Apostles, that he had greate dignity among the Apostles, may easely be grau~ted, but that he had auctority ouer them, such as the Pope claymeth ouer all Bishops, is of vs vtterly denyed.
Neitherd oeth any one, nor all together, of M. Sa~ders
argumentes, proue that he had one iote of auctority ouer his brethren.
He was first in order of nombring of the twelue Apostles.
He was promised to be called Cephas, before the twelue were chosen.
He was named Peter at the time of the choise, ergo he hadde the Popes auctoritie ouer them.
Who would graunt the consequence of these arguments? Let vs see what the other be.
It was sayd to him alone, thou art Peter, vppon this rocke will build my Church.
deny that it was said to him alone, for all the Apostles were likewise rockes, vppon which he would build his Church.
that the keyes of the kingdome of heauen were promised to him alone, for euery one of the Apostles receiued the~ aswel as he, being or dained with equal power of binding losing, of remit ing retayning sinnes.
Notwithstanding the wordes at one time were spoken to Peter alone, yet did they giue him no singular auctority.
The Christ payed tribute for Peter, as vnder head of his family.
This Didrachma was payd for euery man in the City where he dwelt, because Peter had a house and a family in the Cytie, Christ payed for him with whom he lodged, and him selse.
First, that Christ maketh his Church and splrituall kingedome subiect to tribute, yea, to Moses lawe, by which that kind of tribute was due.
Secondly you deuide Christes church into two householdes, Didrachma was to be payde, for the heade or firste borne of euery house.
And you shewe your ignoraunce in referring this payment to Num.
which was only for the firste borne, wheras this was for all men.
And for the firste borne was dewe fiue siccles, whereof euery one was halfe an Vnee of Siluer at the leaste, whereas Didrachma contayning but two Drachmaes. whereof euery one was equall with the Romane pennie coulde be but xvj. pence at the moste of our monie.
It is a strong argument, that the payment of trybute which argueth subiection, should make Peter so greate a Lorde, that he should be out of all subiection, which if Chrysostome had considered, hee woulde not haue grounded Peters primacie vppon so friuolus an Argument.
The seuenth, Christe preached out of Saincte Peters Bote, to shew that in his Chaire, his doctrine should alwayes be stedfastly professed.
An Argument to be answeared either with laughing or hissing.
Though all the Apostles were to be sifted, yet Peters Fayth alone is prayed for.
This is vtterly false, for Christe prayed for all his Apostles fayth.
if specially for Peter, it was in respecte of his greater daunger, and not in respect of his greater dignitie.
Peter firste entred into the Sepulchre, ergo he was made pope.
He entred for farther confirmation of his Fayth concerning Christes resurrection, this maye be imputed to diligence but not to dignitie.
The Angell sayth, Tel his Disciples and Peter, naming him seuerally because of his shamefull fall, he had more neede of comforte.
Ambrese thinketh Peter was the first man that saw him.
Nay rather the Souldiors which kept the graue saw him before Peter, the women also, which would geue them dignity aboue Peter, if firste seeing were a matter to argue dignity.
onely S. Peter walked on the Sea, that signifieth the worlde to be his iurisdiction.
As he walked by Fayth, so by weakenesse of fayth he beganne to sinke.
And the Sea that he walked on, was but a lake or meere, therfore cannot well signifie the whole worlde, beside, the argument is as sure as if it were bound with a strawe.
S. Peter is shewed to haue loued Christe more then the reste, and is alone commaunded to feede his sheepe.
He had good cause to loue him more, because greater sinnes were forgiuen him, but it is false, that he onely was commaunded to feed Christes sheepe, for all the Apostles were likewise commaunded.
It is saido to Peter, thou shalte stretch foorth thy hands and followe thou mee, by which a particular kinde of death on the crosse is prophecied.
violent death, but no particular kinde of death is shewed by these wordes.
And although it were, yet Peter in beeing Crucifyed, was made no greater then Andrewe, who was crucifyed also, if the storyes of both be true, Peter aunsweared alwayes for the Apostles, ergo hee was chiefe.
No more then the foreman of the Iewrye, although it is not true, that he alwayes aunsweared for the rest, for sometime Thomas, sometime Philip, sometime Iudas aunsweared.
That was by speciall instinct of the holy Ghoste, and by no ordinary authoritie.
After the sending of the holy Ghost, Peter aboue all the rest, firste taught the fayth.
Chrysostome and Cyrill sayth, he did it by the consent of all the rest, who all stoode vp togither with him, although one spake to auoyde confusion, when the Apologie was made to answere the slaunderous scoffers.
The multitude conuerted, said to Peter and to the other Apostles, but to Peter by name: VVhat shall we doe.
If this proue any thing, it proueth the equallitie of the Apostles, that hauing heard one man preach they demand not of him alone, but of all the rest with him, what they shall doe? Peter made aunswere for all, that they should repent be baptised.
It was good reason seeing he made the apologie for all.
Peter did the first miracle after the comming of the holy Ghost and by healing the lames feete shewed mystically, that he was the rocke to establishe the feete of other.
aunswere, Iohn healed him as muche as Peter, by Peters owne confession Act.
and the lame mans acknowledging the benefit to be receiued equally from both, in holding Peter and Iohn. Peter co~fessed Christ first not only before priuate me~, but at the seate of iudgement.
It is false that Peter co~fessed Christ first before priuate men, and at the seate of iudgement, he confesseth equally with Ihon. Peter alone gaue sentence with fullnesse of power vpon Ananias and Saphyra.
Not by ordinarie power, but by speciall reuelation, and direction of the holie Ghost, whatsoeuer Gregorie a partiall iudge in this case doth gather.
Peter was so famous aboue the rest, that his shadow was sought, to heale the diseased.
This was a singular and personall gift, which the Pope hath not, therefore it perteineth nothing to him.
Peter did excommunicate enioyne penance to Symon Magus the first heretike.
Peter denounced Gods iudgement against him, but not by way of exco~munication, yet the argume~t is naught, as all the rest are, though the antecedents were graunted.
Peter was the first that raised a deade body to life, namely Tabitha after Christs asce~tio~.
This is neither proued to be true, neither if it were, should Peter thereby haue greater auctoritie, then his fellow Apostles which likewise raised the dead and peraduenture before Peter, although S. Luke make no mention of them.
Peter had first by vision that the Gentiles were called to beleue in Christ.
This is false for Paule had that in vision before him.
God chose that the Gentiles shoulde first of all heare the worde of the Gospell by Peters mouth, and shoulde belecue.
This is false, for Peter sayeth not, first of all, but of olde tyme.
And the Eunuche of AEthiopia, was baptised by Philippe before Cornclius of Peter.
Prayer was made for Peter, by the churche, which was not so earnestly made for any other Apostle that we read of.
Their earnest prayer for Peter, is set forth to shewe that God at their prayer deliuered Peter, not that Peter was thereby shewed to be greater in auctoritie.
Paule and Barnabas came to Ierusalem to the Apostles to fitch a solution from Peter.
But S. Luke noteth, that they came to all the Apostes and Elders at Ierusalem, and not to Peter onely, nor for his solution, but for the solution of the councell.
Peter did not onely speake first but also gaue the determinate sentence.
Both the partes of this proposition are false, for Sainct Luke testifieth, there was greate disputation before Saincte Peter spake, also Sayncte Iames as President of the councell, gaue the definitiue sentence, accordinge to whose wordes, the synodicall Epistle, was written in the name of all the Apostles and Elders at Ierusalem.
Sainct Paule came to Ierusalem to see Peter as Chrysostome sayeth because he was primus first or chiefe? But Sainct Paule him selfe affirmeth in the same place, and diuerse other, that he was equall with Peter, and the highest Apostles.
Peter was either alone or first chiefest in the greatest affaires of the church.
The greatest affaire of the church was the preaching vnto the Gentils in which Peter was neither alone, nor first, nor chiefest.
Peter was sent to Rome to occupie with his chaire the mother church of the Romane prouince and chiefe citie of the worlde, and there vanquished Symon Magus the head of heretikes. &c.
All this is vncerteyne being not founde in the Scriptures, but those stories which reporte it, conuinced by Scriptures, to be false in diuerse circumstaunces.
Peters chaire and succession hath bene acknowledged of all auncient fathers &c.
Although the see of Rome appoynted for the scate of Antechrist, hath of olde bene verie ambitious, yet it is a fable, that hath bene acknowledged by all auncient fathers to haue the auctoritie, which the Bishoppes thereof, haue claymed.
All the Bishops of Africa in councel, withstoode Innocentius, Zozimus, Bonifacius, and Caebastinus, alleaging for their auctoritie a counterfaite decree of the councell of Nic, as we haue shewed before in the first treatise, the like may be sayed of the councells of Chalcedon, of Constantinople, the
&c. which withstoode the Bishoppe of Romes auctoritie in such cases as he pretended prerogatiue.
reasons, proue Peter to be greater in auctority, then the rest of the Apostles, and much lesse the Bishoppe of Rome to be greater then Bishops of other seates.
THat the Apostles beside the prerogatiue of their Apostleshippe, had also the auctoritie to be particular Bishoppes, which thing their name also did signifie in the olde time.
ALthough the Apostles had all such auctoritie, as euerie particular Bishop hath, yet had they not two offices, but one Apostleship.
No more then a King although he haue all auctoritie that euerie Constable hath, is thereby both a King and a Constable, but a King onely.
Neither doth their staying or as he calleth it residence, in some particular citie, proue that the Apostles either were or might be Bishops, that is geue ouer their generally charge and take vpon them a particular, or still reteyning their generall charge, to exercise the office of a Bishoppe any longer, then vntill the churche was perfectly gathered, where they remayned.
For although the holy Ghost distinguished their vniuersall charge into seuerall partes, to auoyde confusion, as in making Peter chiefe Apostle of the circumcision, and Paule of the Gentiles, yet were they not thereby made Bishoppes.
And although the consent of writers is, that Iames was Bishoppe of Ierusalem, yet following the course of the Scriptures, we must hold that Iamesby decree of the holy Ghost, was appoynted to stay there, not as a Bishoppe, but as an Apostle for the conuersion of the Iewes, which not onely out of all Iurie, but out of all partes of the world, came thither ordinarily to worshippe.
Of S. Peters sitting at Antioch as Bishoppe, we finde nothing in the Scriptures, and lesse of his remouing to Rome.
But we finde that when Peter came to Antioche, Paule withstoode him to his face, and reproued him openly, which he might not well haue done, if Peter had bene supreame heade of the church, in his owne see as M. Sander doth fantasie.
Where he alleageth the text Episcopatum eius accipiat alter, and let an other take his Bishoprike, to proue that Iudas and so the Apostles were Bishoppes, it is too childish fonde an argument, seeing the Greeke word, which S. Luke vseth the Hebrue word which the Prophet vseth, signifieth generally a charge or office, and not suche a particular office of a Bishoppe, as nowe we speake of.
ad Tim. to proue yt the name of an Apostle in the primitiue church did signifie such a Bishoppe.
But howe greatly Theodoret was deceaued, appeareth by this, that he citeth for proofe Philip.
Epaphroditus to be the Apostle of the Philippensians, because S. Paule sayth of him Epaphroditus your Apostle, and my helper: whereas he meaneth that he was their messenger, vsing the worde [undefined span alphabet] in the generall signification for a messenger, and not for the name of suche an officer as an Apostle or Bishoppe.
He nameth also Titus and Timotheus which in the Scripture, are neuer called Apostles, likewise the Apostles and Elders at Ierusalem, which were in deede the true Apostles of Christs immediat sending, and not Bishoppes ordeyned by men.
And whereas Hierome sayeth, that all Bishoppes be successors of the Apostles, he meaneth manifestly in auctoritie, within their seuerall charges, and not that the Apostles were Bishops.
Likewise where Augustine sayth, that the Bishoppes were made in steede of the Apostles, it rather proueth that the Apostles, were no Bishoppes, for then if the Apostles were Bishoppes, he should say, Bishoppes were made in steede of Bishoppes.
The last reason is, that if the office of Bishoppes had not bene distinct in the Apostles, fro~ their Apostleship, that office woulde haue ceased with the Apostleshippe, for the whole being taken away no parte can remayne, except it had an other grounde to stande in, beside the Apostleshippe, as the Bishoppely power had.
In deede if the Apostleshippe had ceased before Bishoppes had bene ordeyned, Bishoplike power woulde haue ceased with it: but seeing the Apostles ordeyned Bishops and Elders in euery congregation, to continue to the worlds ende, the Bishoppes office hath not ceased, though the office of the Apostles is expired.
Wherefore seeing neither by Scripture, reason, nor Doctors, this distinction of offices in the Apostles, can be proued, when Peter is called heade, Prince, chiefe, first, Capteyne of the Apostles by Cyrill, or any auncient writer, we must vnderstande, as Ambrose teacheth a primacie of confession or fayth, not of honor or degree de incar. dom cap.
HOw farre S. Peter did ether excell or was equall with the Apostles in their Apostolike office.
VVhere in diuerse obiections are aunswered, which seeme to make against S. Peters supremacie.
BVt that necessity enforceth him, M. Sander thinketh it sinne of curiositie to inquire of that equality or inequalitie of the Apostles, where as it should suffice vs to follow the present state of the vniuersall Church practised in our time.
As though the vniuersall Church of any time, did euer acknowledge the Pope to be supreame heade, although a great part of the world hath of long time so taken him.
He thinketh it out of contronersie, that S. Peter was the first of the Apostles as S. Mathew sayth, primus, the first, Simon which is called Peter.
And he is not co~tent that he was first in the order of numbring, but he will haue him first in dignitie, because he is alwayes named first.
But that is nether true, nor a good reason if it were true, because he is named first, therefore he is of greatest dignitie.
Iames and Cephas Iohn are sayde to haue bene pillers of the Churche, and yet Paule equall with them.
Although if we graunted greatest dignity to Peter, yet thereupon did not follow greatest authority.
For these three Apostles last named, were of greatest dignity among the Apostles, yet not of greater authoritie then the rest.
And although the auncient fathers of the worde primus, haue deriued the name of primatus, or primacy, yet haue they also expressed, wherin this primacie doth consist, namely not in authoritie but in order, nether doth those names Prince, chiefe, heade, toppe, guide, mouth, greatest of the Apostles, vsed by some of them, signifie his authoritie ouer them, but his dignitie amongest them.
But if you aske him wherin Peter was chiefe? He answereth question is curious.
For in ye nature order of the apostleship, euery Apostle was equall with all his fellowes, so is euery Bishop Priest, King, Duke, Knight with euery one of his degree.
If this be as he sayth, then was Peter chiefe, nether as Apostle nor Bishoppe.
But there may be another thinge (sayth he) coincident to some degree of men, not necessary for the being, but for their well being.
One therefore was set ouer the Apostles, for vnities sake, and to auoyd schismes as Cyprian Hierom write in places before cited.
This must nedes be a primacy of order and not of authoritie, for amonge men of equall authoritie, as he confesseth the Apostles were, one may be chosen as the President or Primate, to auoyd confusion, the austeritie remayning equall to euery one, but one can not be preferred in authoritie to remayne still equall with his fellowes in auctoritie.
are cited to proue that the same primacie which Peter some time (but yet not alwaies) had among the Apostles, should be reteyned in succession of his chayre to mayntayne vnitie amonge all men, it hath no ground in the holy Scriptures, and yet those good men were farre from imagining suche an absolute power of Peters successor, as M. Sander defendeth in the Pope, although some times he doe handle it so nicely, as it might seeme to be a thing of nothing, wherein the Pope is aboue his fellow Bishops, where sayd, that Peter had not alwayes the primacie of order among the Apostles, it is proued, both by the
of the Actes, where Iames was President of the councell, Gal.
not onely where Iames is named before Peter, but also where Peter abstayned and separated him selfe, after certayne came from Iames, fearing them of the circumcifion, left he should haue bene euill thought of, as he was before for keeping company with Cornelius. and in diuerse other places of the Actes of the Apostles.
But M. Sander will adde another truth, to the former doctrine of Peters primacie, namely that seeing the Apostles needed no heade, because they were not in dau~ger of error, the head was appoynted ouer them for an example of the Church afterward, when that personall priuiledge of the Apostles ceased to be in their successors.
But how wil he proue that the priuiledge of not erring, hath continued in Peters successors, more then in the successors of all the Apostles.
Forsooth because Christ prayed that Peters faith might not fayle, that he might confirme his brethren.
haue often shewed that he prayed for the perseuerance of all his Apostles, and the cause of his speciall prayer for Peter, was proper to Peters person, therefore can not be drawne to his successors.
And what madnes is it, to defend that the Pope can not erre? when Pope Honorius was condemned for an heretike both by the
But M. Sander concludeth, to aunswer the argument of the equalitie of the Apostles, that Paule was equall with Peter in Apostleship: but by the appoyntment and will of Christ, Peter was heade, to shew that his Church hauing one Pastor in it aboue the rest, is one, as a kingdom one, by hauing one king in it.
Howbeit we sinde the will of God for the supremacie and headship of Christ, ouer all his Church, to make it one, in the holy Scriptures, when of Peters headship or supremacie there is neuer a word And Paule sayth, that he was nothing inferiour to the highest Apostles,
if nothing absolutely, then was not Peter his superiour in any respect.
That Paule reprehended Peter, M. Sander sayth, he might doe it by equalitie of his Apostleship.
If that be so, why may not euery Bishop reprehende the Pope by equality of Bishoprike.
If you graunt they may, then haue you so many Canones against you, as you can neuer saue their authoritie and abide by your confession.
But this fault you say, with Tertullian, was of conuersation, not of preaching, that Peter might not seeme to haue erred in doctrine.
Neuertheles it can not be excused, but Peter also erred in doctrine.
Not in the generall doctrine of the abolishing of the lawe, or of Christian libertie, but of bearing too much with the Iewes, in preiudice of the Gentils, whom he compelled to Iudaisme, in derogation of the truth of Paules doctrine, which dissimulation he entred not into, for any worldely respect, but because he was dceyued in opinion, thinking that in that case he ought so to haue done, before he being reprehended by Paule, sawe the inconuenience, and then myldely yelded to the correction.
But in this humble submission sayth Maister Sanders, Peter proued him selfe to be the head of all the Apostles, seeing Christ had sayde, he that is greater among you let him be as the lesser.
In deed he shewed herein such greatnes, as Christ commendeth, but no headeship or authoritie ouer his brethren.
Cyprian ad Quintum, sayth he, did not iudge this reprouing of Peter, to be an argument against his supremacie, but a witnes of his humilitie, but he giueth vs this much to vnderstande, that if he had chalenged primacie, he had taken vpon him arrogantly, his wordes are these.
For nether did Peter, whome our Lorde chose the first, and vpon whome he builded his Church, when Paule did striue with him about circumcision afterward, chalenge any thinge insolently, or take vpon him arrogantly, to say that he had the primacie, and that he ought rather to haue bene obeyed of Nouices and aftercommers: nether did he despise Paule, for that he was before a persecutor of the Churche, but he did admitte the counsell of truth.
The like sayth Augustine for his humilitie, but as a later writer more pregnant for his primacye.
In Scripturis &c. VVe haue learned in the holy Scriptures, that Peter the Apostle, in whome the primacie of the Apostles in so excellent grace hath the preheminence, when he vsed to de otherwise then the truth required about circumsion, was corrected of Paule who was admitted after him to be an Apostle.
In this saying the primacye is of tyme and order, not of dignitie and authoritie.
But Gregory much later then Augustiue, graunteth to Peter, not onely a primacie, bt also a maioritie, in Ezech.
That he who was chiefe in the toppe of the Apostleship, should be chiefe also in humilitie.
And agayne, Ece minore, &c. Beholde Peter is reproued of his lesser, and he disdayneth not to be reproued.
Nether doth he call to minde, that he first was called to the Apostleship.
These wordes make Peter greater none otherwise, then that he was first called to the Apostleship, which argueth small authoritie ouer his iuniours.
Hereupon he taketh occasion to inueye against the pride of Luther, Zwinglius, Caluine &c. and their bitter dissentions, shewing how farre they are vnlike to the Apostles.
It is not to be doubted, that they were many degrees inferior to the vertue and holmes of the Apostles, but yet as well in humilitie as all other vertues, if they come not nearer to them, then the Pope, and his pompous Clergye, let God and all indifferent men bee Iudges.
Moreouer where as it is obiected against the supremacie of Peter, that the Apostles sent him to lay hands vpon those whom Philip the Deacon had baptized: he aunswereth, that proueth no more their equalitie, then when the Canones of a Cathedrall Church doe chose their Deane or Bishop, to go about busines of the chapter, it proueth the Deane and Bishop to be inferior to the Cano~s.
But by his fauor, where the Deane or Bishop are sent about busines, it argueth the Bishop and Deane in respect of those busines, to be inferior to the whole chapiter, as Peter Iohn were to the whole Colledge of the Apostles, though the Bishop or Deane in other respects, be superior to the Canons, and Peter and Iohn were equall to euery one of the Apostles.
Wherefore M. Sanders conclusion is vpon a false supposition, that Peter had authoritie to depose the Apostles, if they had fallen as Iudas did, therefore the Pope hath the like ouer Bishops.
For nether had Peter any singular auctoritie to depose any of his fellow Apostles, no more then he had to chose one in place of Mathias, nor the Bishop of Rome ouer other Bishops euer had of right, but by concession, election, or vsurpation.
THat S. Peters prerogatiue aboue the other Apostles, is most manifestly seen by his chiefe Bishoply power.
M. Sander fantasying that he hath proued Peter superior to the Apostles, not in their Apostleship, but in his Byshoply degree, doth yet againe distinguish the order and office of a Byshop from the authoritie and iurisdiction of the same.
And in order and office he confesseth that all Byshopps of the worlde, are equall as Hierome sayeth, ad Euagrium, and Cyprian De vnitate ecclese, but not in authoritie.
But seeing he rehearseth the testimonie of Hierome imperfectly, will set it downe at large, that you may see whether it will beare his distinction.
He writeth against a custome of the Church of Rome, by which the Deacons were preferred abooue the Priestes, whome hee proueth by the Scripture to be equall with Byshoppes, excepte onely in ordaining.
For what doth a Bishop excepting ordination which a Priest or Elder doth not? Neither is it to be thought, that there is one church of the city of Rome and an other of the whole worlde.
Both Fraunce, and Britayn, Africa, and Persia, and the East, and India, all barbarous nations, worship one Christ, obserue one rule of truth.
If auctoritie be sought, the world is greater then a citie.
Wheresoeuer a Bishop be either at Rome, or at Eugubium, or at Constantinople, or at Rhegium, or at Alexandria, or at Tunis, he is of the same worthines of the same Priesthoode.
Power of riches basenes of pouerty make not the Bishop higher or inferior.
And lest you should thinke he speaketh onely of equalitie in order office, not in authority.
He doth in an other place shew that the authoritie of euery Priest is equall with euery Bishop by Gods disposition, that the excelling of one Bishop aboue other Priests, came only by custom.
Sieut ergo presbyteri sciunt se ex Ecclesiae consuetudine, ei qui sibi praepositus fuerit, esse subiectos: it a Episcopi nouerint, se magis consuctudine, quam dispositionis Dominicae veritate, presbyteris esse maieres.
Therefore as Priestes do know, that by custom of the Church, they are subiect to him that is set ouer them: so let Bishops know, that they are greater then Priests, rather by custom then by truth of the Lordes appoyntment.
If the authoritie then iurisdiction of Bishops dependeth vpon custo~, not vpon gods appointment, Peter was not by our lords appointme~t preferred in bishoplik authority before the rest of ye Apostles, nor the Bishop of Rome, before other Bishops Priestes, but only by custom.
The Bishops office is one, whereof euery man doth partake the Bishops office wholy.
Now if authoritie iurisdiction doe pertayne to the Bishops office, euery Bishop hath it wholy, as (to follow M. Sanders example) whatsoeuer is incident to the nature or kind of a man, is equally in euery man.
But now the greatest matter resteth, to proue how S. Peter had more committed to his charge then the rest of the Apostles, and that he taketh on him to proue, by this reason.
Peter loued Christ more then all the rest of the Apostles, therefore he gaue him greater authoritie in feeding his sheepe, then to the rest, But deny the argument.
For Peter loued Christ more then the rest, because Christ had forgiuen him greater sines, then to the rest, Luc.
In consideration whereof, he required greater diligence in doing his office, but gaue him not a greater charge or authoritie.
Now where M. Sander reasoneth, that Peter loued Christ most, because Christ first loued him most, and Christ loued him most, because he would make him gouernour of his Church, it is a shamefull petition or begging of that which is in question.
For the nearest cause of Peters greater loue, was the greater mercy which he founde, which mercy proceeding from the loue of God as the first infinite cause, can haue no higher, superior, or former cause.
But Peter in respect of greater loue shewed to him, in that greater sinne was forgiuen him, was bound to shewe greater loue toward Christ, which he required to be shewed in feeding his sheepe, yet this proueth not, that greater authoritie was giuen him, or that he did feede more then all men.
For S. Paule sayth truly of him selfe, haue labored more then they all,
wherby it appeareth, that Peter as a man, was not equall with Christ in the effect of excellent loue, which was in him in comparable.
And whereas M. Sander talketh so much of his commission of feeding, say these words feede my sheepe &c. be not wordes of a newe commission, but words of exhortation, that he shew exceeding diligence in the commission equally deliuered to all the Apostles: As my father hath sent me, so send you.
But the auncient fathers expound it so, that it might seeme to be a singular commission to Peter.
It can not be denyed but diuers of the auncient fathers, otherwise godly and learned, were deceyued in opinion of Peters prerogatiue, which appeareth not in the Scriptures, but was chalenged by the Bishops of Rome, which seemed to haue a shew of some benefit of vnitye to the Church, so long as the Empire co~tinued at Rome, the Bishops of that ie retayned the substance of Catholike religion: yet did they neuer imagine, that such blasphemous tyrannicall authoritie, yea such false hereticall doctrine, as afterward was mayntayned vnder the prete~ce of that prerogatiue, shoulde or ought to haue bene defended thereby.
But let vs see what M. Sander can saye, out of the aunient writers.
There were many Apostles, and it is sayde to one, feede my sheepe.
God forbid there should now lacke good pastors, but all good pastors are in one, they are one.
This maketh nothing for Peters authority ouer the rest, but only the author supposeth the vnitie of all Pastors to be allegorically signified, in that Christ speaketh that to one, which is common to all good sheepeheardes, namely to feede his sheepe.
The vnitie of all pastors was figured in one Peter.
So might it wel be without giuing Peter authoritie ouer all Pastors.
who sayth that Christ did aske whether Peter loued him, not to teache vs yt Peter loued him, but to enforme vs quanti sibi curae sit gregis huius praefectura. howe great care he taketh of the gouernment of this flock.
Here he would haue vs marke, that Chrysostom calleth it a rule gouernment of the flock, which Christ intendeth.
Yea sir, we see it very wel, but you would make vs blind, if we could not see, that Chrysostom speaketh not of a general rule, graunted to Peter only, but of the gouernment of euery Churche by euery Pastor.
And therefore you daunce naked in a net, when you alledge the words following absolutely, as though they pertayned to Peter onely.
Petrum Christus auctoritate praeditum esse voluit, &c. whereas Chrysostom speaking to euery Priest, shewing how careful he ought to be in his office, in respect of his high calling the excellent dignitie thereof, sayth: Etiam ne nune nobisium contendes fraudemistam tibi non bene ac foeliciter cessisse, quiper eam vniuersis Dei optimi maximi bonis administrandis sis praeficiendus, quu~praesertim ea agas, quecu~ Petrus ageret, illu~ Christus auctoritate preditu~ esse voluit, ac reliquos item Apostolos longe~ praecellere.
Wilt thou then stil contend with vs, that this fraude hath not happened well luckely to thee, which by it, art to be made ouerseer of all the goods of God almightye, especially when thou doest those thinges, which when Peter did, Christ would haue him to be endued with authoritie, also farre to excel the other Apostles.
We marke them all, that they are directly ouerthrowing M. Sanders rocke of the popish Churche.
For they declare, that Peter in doing those things, was endued with authoritie, farre passed the other Apostles, euen as euery Priest (to who~ Chrysostom speaketh) when he doth the same thinges, is endued with the same authoritie, farre passeth all other men.
So that here is none other authority, nor excelle~ce of Peter then such as is common to all ministers in executing their charge, and was common to all the Apostles when they did the same things that Peter did.
For Chrysostom proueth to Basil, that he did him no hurt, when by pollicie he caused him to be called to the ministery against his will, seeing that thereby he was made partaker of the reward of the faithfull wise seruaunt, and equall in authoritie with Peter, if of loue towardes Christ he would diligently feede his flocke.
So that Leo had no iust cause to saye that in respect of any greater authoritie, Peter had a speciall care of feeding the sheepe committed to him.
but rather in respect that he had greater cause to loue Christ, which had so mercifully forgiuen him so shamefull a fall.
But Arnobius is a lesse partiall witnes then Leo a Bishop of Rome, he vpon the Psal.
Nullus Apostolorum nomen &c. None of the Apostles receiued the name of a Pastor.
Therefore this holy name, the power of this name, after his resurrection he graunted to Peter repenting.
And he that was thryse denyed, gaue to his denyer, that power which he had alone.
Arnobius (saith he) noteth none of the Apostles euer to haue had the name of a pastor giuen to him by Christ, beside S. Peter alone.
But demaund of M. S. where he hath in Arnobius this word euer? For he sayth, yt Peter had this name after ye resurrection wc none of ye Apostles had before.
He writeth against the Nouatians wc denied helpe to such as repented after baptisme, prouing by exa~ple of Peter, that they are to be receyued, seeing Christ gaue him greater dignitie after his repentance, then he had before his fal.
But that Peter had greater authoritie the~ the rest of the Apostles he neuer thought or sayde.
M. Sander cutteth of both the head and the tayle.
In this discourse lest the meaning of Arnobius might appeare, for thus he writeth: Dicis cert baptizatis non debere poenitentibus subueniri Ecce Apostolo poenitenti succurritur, qui est Episcoporum Episcopus, mair gradus additur ploranti, quam sublatus est deneganti.
Quod vt doceam, illud est endo, quod nullus Apostoloru~ nomen Pasioris accepit. &c.
In deede thou sayst that such as repent being baptised ought not to be helped.
Beholde the Apostle repenting is helped, which is a Bishop of Bishops, and a greater degree is restored to him weeping then was taken from him denying.
Which that may teach, this shew, that none of the Apostles receyued the name of a sheepeheard, &c. Againe in the ende following the wordes before cited by M. Sander he sayth, vt non slum recuperasse quod amiserat, probaretur, verum etiam multo amplius poenitendo, quam negand perdiderat acquisisse.
He gaue his denyer that power which before his resurrection he alone had: That he might be proued not onely to haue recouered that which he lost, but also to haue gotten much more by repenting, then he lost by denying.
This speaketh Arnobius of the general authoritie which Peter had ouer all the Church, as euery Apostle had likewise, was a Bishop and ouerseer of Bishops as well as Peter, and a Pastor of the vniuersal Church, which thing Arnobius neuer did deny.
These therfore be M. Sanders arguments, none of the Apostles had the name of a Pastor before Christes resurrection, ergo they neuer had it.
Peter was called to greater dignitie after his fall then he had before, ergo he was greater then his fellow Apostles.
Again Peter was a Bishop or an ouerseer of Bishops, ergo he was Bishop ouer the Apostles.
Who first ayd, that Peter was euery where, ether alone or first And the~ vpon these words, Peter doost thou loue me, sayth: Dominus interrogat &c.
Our Lord asked net to learne, but to teach who~ he beeing to be lfted vpp into heauen, did leaue to vs as the Vicare of his loue.
Simon thou sonne of Iohn, doest thou lue me? Yea Lord thou knowest that loue thee.
Peter being priuy of a good conscience, doth testifie his owne affection, not taken for the time, but already well knowen to God.
For who else were able to professe this thing of him selfe.
Ad because he alone amongst all professeth, he is preferred before all.
So Peter is heereby declared to haue the greateste loue, but not to haue the greatest authoritie.
M. Sander vrgeth that he is the Vicar of Christes loue and pastorall office.
The one indeede Ambrose sayth, the other Sander sayeth but is not able to proue: no not by that which followeth in the same place of Ambrose, that Peter had committed to him to feede, not onely the Lambes with milke, as at the first, nor yet the little sheepe, as at the seconde time, but the sheepe, to the end that he beeing more perfect, might gouerne the more perfecte.
For euery one of the Apostles hadde the same charge to feede the sheepe of Christe, and not the Lambes or little sheepe onely.
For euery Apostle had the like gouernment ouer the whole flock wc Peter hath, and there is an ordinary gouernment in euery particular church,
wc proueth not the gouernors to be rulers one ouer another, wherefore this collection is not only vaine, but also ridiculus, that Peter should haue authoritie to gouerne Patriarches, Archbishops and Bishops aswell as Parishe priests, because he must feed ye sheep of Christ, wil not here stand to discus how properly ye distinctio~ of lambs litle sheep sheep, is obserued by Ambrose, but taking it according as he distinguisheth it, yet heere is nothing giuen to Peter but primacie of loue, or as else where he sayth of order, but of authoritie singular, here is nothing at al.
And that his conclusio~ declareth sufficiently Et idio quasi perfecto in omnibus, quem caro iamreue are non posset a gloria passionis, corona decernitur.
And therfore a crown is decreed to him as to one perfect in all things whome the fleshe could not call back from the glory of suffering.
This conclusion M. S. (as his manner is) hath left out, by which it is apparant, that Ambrose inferreth no singularitie of authoritie in Peter, as more perfet the~ the rest of the Apostles, but as perfect in such degre, as the rest of the Apostles which were likewise prepared to martyrdo~, were equal wt him therin.
The testimony of Bernard a late witer, though he were no flatterer, yet receiue not, as of one which was deceiued with the common error of his time.
But in signe that Peter was generall Shepheard, saith M. San.
it is not read that he was ordained bishop of any other then of Christ, yet did he with two other Apostles ordaine S. Iames byshop of Ierusalem as Eus. lib.
There is no dout but Iames was acknowldged by the Apostles to be appointed by the holy ghoste to remaine at Ierusalem, though not as a prticuler bishop, but as an Apostle of the whole Church.
But as we read not that Peter was made Bishop by any man, so we read not that he was made Byshop by Christ.
Behold the Apostle beeing penitent is succoured, which is a Bishop of Bishops.
He asketh if any thing could be spoken more plainly? yes verely, you had need of plainer speaches then this, to proue that hee was byshop of the Apostles.
For admit that he was an ouerseer of particular bishops, as the word [undefined span alphabet] doth signiie, yet it followeth not that he was ouerseer or Byshop of the Apostles.
In which sense Clemens also (if the Epistle were not counterfaite) might iustly call Iames a Byshop of Byshops, not as M. Sand. aunsweareth that he was an Archbishop of inferior Byshops, but an Apostle ouerseer of particuler Bishops.
That Cyprian ad Quintum sayth: Neque quisquam &c Neither doeth any of vs make him selse a Byshoppe of Byshops.
He aunsweareth that although no man may make himselfe, yet Christe may make a man Bishop of Byshopes, but where findeth he that Christe maketh the Pope a Byshop of Byshoppes? Howe Peter might bee called a Byshop of Byshoppes, haue shewed before But the Councell of Carth.
forbiddeth that the Byshop of Rome, or any other Primate shoulde be called the Prince of Priests, or highest Priest, or by any such lyke name, but only the Byshop of the first seate.
He deserued to be preferred before all the Apostles, and he alone receiued the Keyes of the Kingdome of Heauen to be communicated vnto the reste.
Master Sander confessing and truely, that the Apostles tooke the Keyes belonging to their Apostolike office immediatly of Christe, saith they receiued the Keyes of their Byshoplike office of Peter.
But what lock was there, that they could not open and shut by their Aopstolike Key? When Christe sayth, Whatsoeuer you binde or loose, whose sinnes soeuer you forgiue or retayne, which was the power of their Apostolike Keyes? If the Apostolike Keyes were so sufficient, what neede they any Byshoplike Keyes? Into these absurdities both he Optatus doe followe, whiles the one will vrge a prerogatiue of Peter, the other will forge a Byshoplike office in the Apostles, whereof the Scripture giueth vs no instruction.
As for Leo and Gregorye Byshoppes of Rome, although they were not come to the full pryde of Antichrist, yet the mysterie of iniquitie hauing wrought in that seate, neere fiue or sixe hundreth yeeres before them, and then greatly increased, they were so deceiued with the longe continuaunce of error, that they thought the dignitie of Peter was much more ouer the reste of his fellowe Apostles, then the holy Scriptures of God, (against which no continuaunce of error cann prescribe) doth either allow or beare with all.
Wherefore although he haue some shewe out of the olde writers, yet hath he nothing directly to prooue that Peter did excell the other Apostles in Byshoplike authoritie, and out of the worde of God no one ote or tytle, that Peter as a Byshop excelled the other Apostles, not as Apostles, but as Byshops.
THat the pastorall and chiefe Byshops authoritie of Saint Peter, was an ordinary authoritie, and there fore it must goe for euer vnto his successors, where as the Apostolike authoritie beeing extraordinary hath no successors in it.
THat ye office of Apostles, which had general charge to preach ouer the whole world, is ceased with the Apostles liues, it is in deede graunted of vs: but that theyre Apostolike authoritie was extraordinary, or that all their authoritie is so determined, that it hath no successors in it, wee doe vtterly deny.
For the same authoritie of preaching, of ministring the Sacraments, of binding and loosing, which the Apostles had is perpetuall in the Church, in the Byshops and elders, which are all successors of the Apostles.
And if the Apostolike authoritie, hath no successors in it, what meaneth the Pope almoste in euery Bul and decretall Epistle, to brag so much of the Apostolike authoritie, to ground all things Apostolica Authoritate by the Apostolike authoritie.
new distinction of Apostolike and Byshoplike authoritie in the Apostles, is not acknowledged by the Popes them selues, but inue~ted lately by such as he is, to haue a starting hole, to seeme to auoid such arguments and authorites, as proue all the Apostles equall in authoritie.
But let vs vs see what reasons he hath to proue, that S. Peters Pastorall authoritie was ordinary, and muste goe to his successors, more then the Pastoral authoritie of euery Apostle.
First S. Peter being but one man was not able to preach to all men at once, nor to gouerne nations newely conuerted, the refore hee had twelue companions adioyned to him.
But the worlde beeing conuerted, it is easy for the Pope without such fellowes, to gouerne all the faythful, by helpe of many inferiour officers.
As thoughe the Church had not inferior officers in the Apostles time.
If S. Peter then was not able to rule, wc had such greate giftes muchlesse the Pope, which is nothing comparable with him in gifts, is often a wicked man an here tike is able to gouerne all the Church, for he hath not so great an helpe of the conuersion of the worlde, as he hath a want of Peters gracious giftes, meete for such a gouernment.
Secondly he would haue vs mark, the peculiar names of a Rock, of a pastor, of a confirmer of his brethren, which are giue~ by Christ to S. Peter alone, which argue that Peters supremacy must necessarily continue for euer.
But who will graunt to M. S. that Christe gaue these peculier names to Peter alone, indeed that which is me~t by the names is ordinary and perpetual in the Church.
Peter was a Rock, not his person, but his doctrine that remaineth stil in the Church, he was a shephearde and confirmer of his brethren, and there bee nowe many shepheards and confirmers of their brethren.
Thirdly he sayth the Church neuer wanted a visible rock on the earth, beside the eternall Rock Christ: who in this life might bee so strongly fastened in the Faith of Christe the great Rocke, that he (though not for his owne sake, yet for the Churches sake) might be able to stay vppe all other small stones, which ioyned vnto him, vntill Christ came in the fleshe, who likewise appoynted Saincte Peter and his successors to be this ordinary rock, as Adam Enos Henoch, Noe, Abraham, Isaac, Iacob, Moyses, Aaron and his successors, who sate in the chaire of Moyses vntill the comming of Christ.
Against this say, that the church militant on earth, hath her foundation in heauen, and not on earth, therfore the churche hath not a visible rocke in earth.
Againe it is not true, that some one, hath alwayes bene this visible rocke on earth.
For who was greater Abraham or Melchisedech? out of all controuersie Melchisedech, then was not Abraham the onely rocke.
After the death of Iacob and the twelue Patriarkes, who was the visible rocke vntill Moyses was called.
And yet had God a church among the Iewes all that time.
Thirdly who is so impudent to say, that all the successors of Aaron were so strongly fastened in the faith, that they were able to stay all the small stones that leaned vpon them.
What were Iason, Menclaus, Lysimachus by the reporte of the booke of Machabes? Was not Caiphas Annas Sadducees by the testimonie of S. Luke Act.
and of Iosephus? Where is then the visible rocke, whose faith neuer failed &c? we see there was none suche before Christ, therefore there neede to be none suche after him.
His fourth reason is, of the name of a pastor, which signifieth an ordinarie office, for as the sheepe continue after S. Peters death, so must there be also a shepheard, as Peter was.
But how proueth he that Peter was an only shepheard? forsooth Chrysostom sayth lib.
Christus sanguinem &c. Christ hath shedde his bloode to purchase those sheepe, the care of whom he did commit both to Peter to Peters successors.
But whom doth Chrysostom take for Peters successors? the Bishops of Rome only? No verily but all true pastors of the church as his wordes going before doe manifestly declare: Neque enim tum volebat testatum esse quantum Petro amaretur, siquidem id multis nobis argument is constabat.
Verum hoc ille sum agebat, vt Petrum caeteros nos edoceres, quanta beneuolentia ac charitate ergasuam ipse ecclesiam afficeretur, vt hac ratione nos quoque eiusdem ecclesiae studium curamque toto animo susciperemus.
For his purpose was not then to testifie vnto vs, howe muche he was beloued of Peter for that was euident vnto vs by many arguments.
But this thing then he intended, that he might teache both Peter and all vs, what beneuolence and loue he beareth towarde his church that by this reason we also might take vpon vs with all our hart, the loue charge of the same church.
This sentence sheweth that Chrysostome accounted him selfe euery true pastor of the church a successor of Peter and not the Bishop of Rome alone.
As for Leo a Bishop of Rome haue often protested that he was more addicted to the dignitie of his see, then the Scripture would beare him, and therefore was ouerruled and resisted, in the generall councel of Chalcedon.
His fift argument is a rule of lawe, where the same reason is, the same right ought to be.
The reason of Peters confession and power is such as agreeth to any ordinary office, of the church, therefore the office of Peter being a rock, of strengthening his brethren and feeding Christes sheepe, is an ordinarie office.
But say, that Peters confession made him not a rock, but declared him so to be, being appoynted of Christ for one of the twelue foundations of the churche, the office of strengthening and feeding as it was not singular in Peter, so it is not ordinarie that it should be singular in any man.
His sixt reason, Irenaeus, Optatus, and Augustine did recken vp such successors of Peter, as had liued till eurie of their ages or times.
It is not denyed, but he had them, and other Bishoppes also successors in his pastorall office, at least the Bishoppes of Antioche, whereby your owne cofession he was Bishoppe, before he came to Rome.
Therefore his succession was not singular to the Bishoppes of one see.
His seuenth reason, no man may preache to them to whom he is not sent, therefore there must be a generall pastor to sende other to preache, to them that are not conuerted, to plant newe Bishoprikes, to controll them that are negligent, to supplie the thinges that lacke: to excommunicate such as liue in no diocesse &c.
where mention is onely of the sending of God, and of the sending by men.
Either the whole church in generall councells, or euerie particular church in their synodes, as they shall see most expedient, may sende preachers as the Apostles and Elders sent Peter and Iohn into Samaria order all such matters, as he imagineth must be done onely by the Pope.
But he asketh who shall summon all other Bishoppes to generall or prouinciall councells.
And aske him, who summoned, the foure great principall generall councells? and so many prouinciall councels, but the Emperours and Princes in whose dominion they were gathered? So that here is no necessary affaires of the church that doth require one generall pastor or Pope of Rome when all thinges may and haue bene done best of all without him.
As for placing of Bishoppes, in sees vacant, vniting of two Bishoprikes in one, or diuiding one into two, may better be done by the auctoritie of those churches, with consent of their Princes, who seeth and knoweth what is needefull in those cases, then by one which sittinge in his chaire at Rome, requireth halfe a yeares trauell, from some parte of the worlde, to him, before he can be aduertised of the case, and yet must vnderstande it by heare saye, and therefore not able to see what is expedient, so well as they that are present, and see the state of the matter.
Finally it is against all likelyhoode, that Christ woulde make suche a generall sheepehearde ouer all his flocke, as many thousande sheepe, which liue vnder the Sophi, the Cham, the Turke, can haue none accesse vnto, for suche thinges as are supposed necessarie to be had and to be obteyned from him onely.
Wherefore if the Pope were heade of the churche, suche as by crueltie of tyrauntes are cut from him shoulde be cut from the bodie of the church.
Yea if Hethenish tyrauntes coulde so much preuayle, as they do in hindring this gouernment of the Pope, (pretended to be so ncessarie) the gates of hell might preuayle against the churche, contrarie to the promise of Christ.
THat the ordinarie auctoritie of S. Peters primacie belongeth to one Bishop alone.
COncerning Peters primacie, as there is litle in the Scriptures, wherupon it may be gathered, so haue shewed, that it was not in him perpetuall.
For there are greater arguments to proue the primacie of Iames.
Agayne the greatest shewe of Peters primacy, that we reade of in the Scriptures, is the primacie or heade Apostleshippe of the circumcision.
So that if one Bishoppe should succeede him, in that primacie, he must be chiefe Bishoppe ouer the Iewes, and not ouer the Gentiles.
For the chiefe Apostleshippe ouer the Gentiles, was by God committed to Paule.
But if M. Sander say, as he doth in an other place, that the Pope succeedeth both these Apostles, and therefore hath both their auctoritie.
First he ouerthroweth his owne rocke of the church, which he will haue to be Peter alone.
Secondlie his argument of vnitie, which he vrgeth in this chapter he subuerteth, if the Popes auctoritie be deriued from two heades.
Thirdly he destroyeth his owne distinction of Bishoplike and Apostolike auctoritie, if the Apostolike auctority of Paul should descend to the Pope by succession.
Nowe let vs consider what weighty reasons he hath, to proue the title of this chapter.
S. Peters auctority was specified before the auctoritie was geuen to the rest, of binding loosing.
Therfore seeing it was first in him alone, it ought to descend to one Bishop alone.
But let M. Sander shew, where it was geuen to him alone, or promised to him alone ether.
For the promise thou shalt be called Peter, gaue him no auctoritie, nor yet the performance thereof: Thou art Peter.
But still the auctority is promised, will build, will geue, (I reason as M. Sander doth of the Future tense) which promise being made Math.
not to Peter onely, but to all the rest, and so all auctoritie is geuen in common Ioan.
But S. Cyprian ad Iubaianum, sayth, that Christ gaue the auctority first to Peter.
Petro primus Dominus (super quem aedificauit ecclesiam, vnitatis originem instituit ostendit) potestatem istam dedit, vt id solueretur in terris, quod ille soluisset.
This doth M. Sander translate, Our Lorde did first geue vnto Peter &c. Wheras he should say: Our Lord was the first that gaue to Peter (vpon whom he builded his churche and instituted and shewed the beginninge of vnity) this power, that whatsoeuer he loosed it should be loosed in earth.
This proueth, that the auctoritie came first from Christ, but not that it was geuen first to Peter.
And if we should vnderstand it so, that it was first geuen to Peter, yet he meaneth not, that it was geuen to reside in his person, but that in him as the attorney of the rest, it was geuen to them also, as he saith, lib.
Petrus tamen super quem aedificata ab eodem Domino fuerat ecclesia, vnus pro omnibus loquens Ecclesiae voce respondens, ait Domine ad quem ibimus &c. Yet Peter vpon whome the churche had beene builded, by the same our Lorde, as one speaking for all, and aunswering in the voyce of the church sayeth: Lorde whether shall we goe &c. as he spake for all, so he receaued for all.
Which thing if it had bene so (as we sinde not in the Scripture) yet could it haue beene no ordinary matter, to discend to one by succession.
For the power beeing once receiued by one in the name of the reste, and by him deliuered to the rest, it should be continued in succession of euery one that hath receiued it, and not euery day to be fetched a new from a seuerall heade.
For that beginning came from vnitie, which Cyprian speaketh of, when Peter beeing one, was the voice mouth of the rest, and so receiued power for the rest, which being once receiued, the church holdeth of Christe, and not of Peter or his successors, no more then a corporation holdeth of him, that was their atturney, to receiue either lands or authoritie from the Prince, but holdeth immediatly of the Prince.
Wherfore this argument followeth not, although the authoritie had begon in one, that it should continue in one.
The second reason is, that the most perfect gouernment is meete for the Church, but most perfection is in vnitie, therefore there ought to be one chiefe gouernor of all.
This one chiefe gouernour is our Sauiour Christ, ruler both in heauen in earth.
Who ascending into heauen, did not appoynt one Pope ouer all his church, but Apostles, Euangelistes, Prophets, Pastors and teachers, that we might all meete in the vnitie of faith, and grow into a perfect man.
The third reason is, that the state of the newe Testament, must be more perfect then the law, but in the law, there was one high pastor, the high Priest on earth, therefore there must be one now also and much rather.
aunswere we haue him in deede, our chiefe Bishop high Priest, of whome the Aaronicall Priest, was but a shadow, namely Iesus Christ, whose gouernment is nothing lesse perfect and beneficiall to his church in that he sitteth in heauen, and hath as before is cited lefte an ordinarie ministerie on earth in many Pastors and teachers ouer euerie seuerall congregation and not in one Pope ouer al, which could not possibly either know, or attend to decide, the one thousande parte of controuersies, which are determined by ye auctoritie of Christs law, and such ministers as he hath ordeyned.
The church which is one was founded by our Lordes voyce vpon one, which receaued the keyes thereof.
Although Christ after his resurrection geueth equall power to all his Apostles and sayth: as my father sent me so do send you: receaue the holy Ghost.
If you remit to any man his sinnes they shal be remitted.
And if you rteine them, they shal be reteined, yet that he might shew the vnitie, he disposed by his auctoritie, the originall of that vnitie, beginning of one.
But Cyprian proceedeth: Hoc erant &c. Vere by the rest of the Apostles were the same thing that Peter was, endued with equall fellowshippe both of honor and of power, but the beginning proceedeth from vnitie, that the church might be shewed to be one.
These wordes are playne to declare, that Cyprian acknowledgeth no inequalitie of the Apostles, in respect of any auctoritie they had.
Also that the building of the church vpon one, and the receauing of the keyes of one, was not an ordinarie office to discende, by succession, but a singular priuiledge, for that one tyme to shewe the beginning, and not the continuaunce of the power to proceede from one, but to be helde alwayes of one, which is Iesus Christ, without any shadowes of one Bishoppe on earth to signifie the same, when Christ is reuealed with open face vnto vs nowe sitting in heauen.
That in one chaire in which Peter sate, vnity might be kept of all men, least the rest of the Apostles shoulde euerie one challenge a chaire to him selfe: so that he shoulde nowe be a schismatike and a sinner, that agaynst a singular chaire, should place an other.
Therfore in that one chaire which is chiefe in giftes, Peter sate first.
His meaning is to defende the vnitie of the churche against the Donatistes, but of the auctoritie of Peters chaire ouer all other Bishoppes chaires, if he had spoken any thing M. Sander would not haue concealed it, which doth vs great wrong to thinke that we can not distinguishe a chaire of vnitie, from a chaire of auctoritie.
hath bene aunswered once or twise, shewing that among the Apostles which were equall, Peter was chosen to be primate, to auoide contention, which was a primacy of order and not of auctority.
As for the collection of Lco Bishoppe of Rome, that Peters primacy was a platforme, for other Bishops to vndersta~d, that they must haue a Bishop ouer them, if the very Apostles had an head among them, sauoreth of the ambition incident to that see, which was appoynted to be the seate of Antichrist.
Although neither Leo him selfe, challe~ged so much as the Pope doth nowe, neither the Bishops of his time, would yeeld vnto him in so muche as he challenged.
For beside the whole generall councel of Chalcedon, that concluded against him, about the priuiledges of the Bishop of Constantinople, wherein they made him equall with the Bishoppe of Rome, the title of seniority onely reserued, it appeareth by his Epistles, that many Bishops acknowledged not such primacy ouer them, as he claimed, whereof he complameth in diuerse of his Epistles.
that heresies haue sprong because one Iudge is not acknowledged in stede of Christ, for the time, to whom the whole brotherhood might obey He can not deny but it is ment of Cyprian of one Iudge in euery diocesse.
But he reasoneth a fortiori, that there ought to be much rather one Iudge ouer all the world.
Howbeit haue shewed the in consequence of this argument, by example of one Phisitian, one Schoolemaister, one Iudge in temporall matters ouer the whole worlde, to whom it is as impossible to discharge suche an office ouer all, as it is profitable for one suche to be in euerie towne.
He sayth that particular flockes, are voluntarie, and likewise particular pastors, but one flocke and one pastor, is of absolute necessitie on earth.
In deede the limites of particular flockes, and the persons of particular pastors, are left to the appoyntment and choise of the church.
But that there should be particular flockes and pastors, it is of Gods ordination, though God by his Apostles appoynted it to be so, yet is it of as absolute necessity, while the church is dispersed in diuerse places of the world, as that there is one flocke and one shepheard ouer all Iesus Christ, and yet he is not ashamed to challenge vs pag.
Christ did institute many parishes? Whereas he him selfe, pag.
which places proue, that Christ did institute many parishes, except he will say the Apostles did it without the institution of Christ, which he confesseth they did not without the speciall inspiration of the holy Ghost or else will say, that the inspiration of the holy Ghost in the ordinaunce of many parishes, differeth from the institution of Christ.
But he that wrangleth thus impudently and vnreasonably, aganst the playne institution of many parishes by Christ, bringeth a playne text where it is sayd, Feede me sheepe to one pastor.
Hath this man any foreheade thinke you, that calleth this a playne text to proue that there shoulde be one sheepehearde vpon earth ouer all the flocke, because Christ vpon speciall occasion exhorted one man to feede his flocke? Are all thinges that were spoken to him singular vnto him? Christ sayd to him and to none other of the Apostles, come after me Satan, thou art an offense to me, for thou sauerest not the thinges that are of God but of men.
Christ sayed to Peter and to none other, put vp thy sworde into thy scaberd, Christ sayed to Peter and to none other, thou wilt denye me thrise.
paynted rocke of the Popishe Churche, that hathe no better grounde then this saying feede my sheepe when he that challengeth auctoritie hereby of all other feedeth least, and poysoneth most.
But let vs returne and see what auctoritie of olde fathers he hath to proue one pastorall preheminence ouer all the churche.
Deus. vnus est, Christus vnus, vna ecclesia, Cathedra vna super petram Domini voce fundata.
There is one God, and one Christ, and one churche, and one chaire founded vpon Peter by our Lordes voyce.
Heare say first of all, that he doth falsifie Sainct Cyprians wordes turning peram into petrum, so that his saying is, There is one chaire by our Lordes voyce founded on the rocke.
An other altar or a new Priesthoode can not be appointed beside one altar and one Priesthoode.
But if the worde were petrum and not petram, yet the whole discourse of that Epistle sheweth, that Cyptian meaneth by these wordes to set forth not the past orall preheminence of one man ouer the whole church, but one Bishop in euery diocese.
For he writeth against fiue Elders or Priestes, which had chosen one Felicissimus a schismatike, to be Bishop in Carthage against him.
But what other malicious ignorance, or shameles impudence is this, that he peruerteth the saying of Christ of him selfe, to the Pope? There shall be one sheepefold one shepheard.
flocke of shepe is one by force of one pastor, therefore if the Pastor on earth be not one, the flocke is not one on earth.
If this argument be good, howe is the flocke one vpon earth, when there is no Pope? For the see hath bene voyde diuerse times, many dayes, many monethes, somtime many yeares.
Howe was the flocke one, when there were two or three Popes at once and that so often, and so long together? Therefore the flocke on earth is one by that one onely shepheard Iesus Christ, whose diuine voice all the shepe heare, though in his humanity, he be ascended into heauen, and not by any one mortal man, to whom they can not be gathered, nether being so farre abroad dispersed, can heare his voyce.
And the whole order of the church on earth, tendeth to an vnitie in Christ, not in one man whatsoeuer, as one generall pastor.
For if that one shoulde be an heretike, and all the church tend to vnity in him, the whole church should be wrapped in heresie with him.
That diuerse Popes haue bene heretiks as Libeius, Anastasis, Vigilus, Honorius, Ihon the
in knowne condemned heresies, it is too manifest by recordes of antiquitie, that it shoulde be denyed, wherefore Christ instituted no such ordinary auctoritie, to be limited in one successio~ that it should haue prehemine~ce imisdiction ouer all the churche.
Seeing vnity is best mainteyned in doctrine by his word, in gouernment, by the discipline by him appoynted.
And vnity in truth can not be had at the handes of a man, which is a lyer, experience sheweth that the iurisdiction which the Bishoppe of Rome hath claimed, hath bene occasion of most and greatest schismes and dissentions that haue bene in particular churches, whe~ no man would obey his ordinary pastors and Bishops without the appealing to the see of Rome, beside so many schismes as haue bene in the same see, which haue set all the Christian world together by the cares, while they were deuided in factio~s, some holding with one Pope, and some with an other, and some with the third, and some with none of them all.
THat the Bishop of Rome is that one ordinarie pastor who succeedeth in S. Peters chaire, and is aboue all Bishoppes according to the meaning of Gods worde.
S. Augustines minde touching the supremacy of the Pope of Rome.
THe first reason is, that although Peter at the first was rather high Bishoppe of the circumcision, the~ of the Gentiles, yet because he did at length settle him selfe at Rome by Gods appointment, and left a successor there, he sayeth he may well affirme, that the Bishop of Romes primacy is warranted by Gods word.
strau~ge kind of warantise, for to omit that the primacy ouer the Gentils by Gods worde, is giuen to another, namely to Paule, from whom he can neuer proue, that it was taken afterward.
Where hath he any worde of God to proue, that by his appointment, Peter setled him self at Rome, and appoynted there a successor? He quoteth Irenaeus lib.
who reporteth that Linus the first Bishop of Rome was ordayned not by Peter onely, but by Peter Paule the Apostles, who founded the Church there, euen as Polycarpus by the Apostles in Asia, was made bishop in Smyrna, which Church with the Church of Ephesus founded by Paule, and continued by Iohn the Apostles, he citeth as witnesses alike, with the Church of Rome, of the tradition of the Apostles, against Valentinus and Marcion which being voyd of Scriptures, bragged of the tradition of the Apostles.
But of Peters primacie, or his successors ouer all Bishops, Irenaeus sayth not a word.
No more doth Tertullian, whom likewise he quoteth, de praescrip.
but euen as Ireneus would haue the tradition of the Apostles, against those heretikes that boasted of it, to be tryed by the co~fession of those Churches that were founded by the Apostles.
His second reason is, vpon a false supposition, that he hath already proued, Peter alone to be the rocke, to haue chiefe authoritie in feeding &c. all which thinges are vntrue.
That Peter came to Rome, he is not content that it be testified by all auncient Ecclesiasticall writers.
But he sayth it is witnessed by the expresse word of God.
The Church which is gathered together in Babylon saluteth you.
Although the history of Peters comming to Rome, and sitting there
yeares, testified by so many writers, is proued false, in many circumstances, by the playne worde of God, yet am content to admitte, that he came thither, towarde the later ende of Ne roes raigne.
But that in his Epistle, he sent salutations from Rome, can not admitte: seeing that in such manner of salutations, men vse not to write allegorically, albeit, that in the reuelation of Saint Iohn Rome the sea of Antichrist is mystically called Babylo~.
But Babylon from whence S. Peter did write, is more probably to be taken, for a citye of that name in Egypt, where Marke was with him, who~ the consent of antiquitie affirmeth, to haue bene Bishop of Alexandria a citie of Egypt also, who coulde not haue bene with him at Rome.
Seeing it is manifest by the first and seconde of the Epistle to the Galathians, and by diuerse of Saint Paules Epistles, that if euer Peter was at Rome, it was but a short tyme in the later ende of Nero his Empire.
Whereas Marke dyed in the eyght yeare of his raigne, before Peter coulde be at Rome.
For in the tenth yeare Paule was brought prisoner to Rome, Saint Luke accompanying him, who would not haue omitted to shewe, that Peter was there to haue mette him, as the rest of the brethren did, if he had then bene at Rome.
Agayne Paule in so many Epistles as he writeth from Rome, sending salutations from meane personages, would not haue omitted mention of Peter, if he had bene there.
Saint Luke then affirming that he taryed two yeares in prison at Rome, which must be vntil the twelfe yeare of Nero, it followeth that if Peter came, he came very late to Rome within two yeare before his death, at which tyme it was not possible, that Marke which was dead foure yeares before, could be at Rome with him, wherefore Babylon in that text can not be taken for Rome.
Another reason of the Popes supremacy he maketh, that Peter not onely came thither, but also dyed there.
simple reason, why the city of Rome should haue that prerogatiue, because she murthered ye Apostles.
Rather might Ierusale~ clayme it, in which Christ the head of all dyed.
After this he telleth the fable out of the counterfait Egesippus, of Simon Magus flying in the ayer, the Emperour Nero his great delight in his sorcerye.
The credit of Egesippus he desendeth, by blaming his translatour for adding names of cities, which had none such when Egesippus liued.
But that Simon Magus shewed no experiment ofsorcerye before Nero, as this counterfait Egesippus reporteth it is plaine, by Plinius lib.
Histor. who shewing how desirous Nero was, and what meanes he had to haue triall thereof, yet neuer could come by any.
It was a practise of old time, to fayne such fables, for loue of the Apostles, as Tertullian witnesseth, de baptis. of a Priest of Asia, that was conuicted confessed, that he fained for the loue of Paule, a writing vnto Tecla, in which many absurd things were contayned.
Againe so many Apocriphall gospells, epistles, itineraryes and passions, as are counterfaited vnder the name of Apostles, and auncient fathers, who knoweth not to be fables and false inuentions.
Amonge which this fable of Simon Magus and Peter is one.
That S. Luke maketh no mention of Peters death, he preuenteth the objection, because he continued not his storye so farre: which doubt (sayth he) he woulde not haue omitted, if he had gone so farre foward in his story.
But seeing he brought Paule to Rome, both in his iorney, and in his history, why maketh he no mention of Peters being there? which if their story were true, must haue sit there twenty yeares before.
To omit therefore the foure causes, why Peter should dye at Rome, whereof three are taken out of a counterfait, August.
out of Leo Gregory Bishops of Rome: he commeth to decyde the controuersie betwene the Greekes Latines, who was first successor of Peter, Linus or Clemens, taking parte with them that affirme, Clemens although Irenaeus the most auncient writer of any that is extant, name Linus who was not a Grecian farre of, but a Frenchmam at Lyons neare hand to Italy, whose authority although he reiect, in naming Linus to be ordayned Bishop by both the Apostles, yet he glorieth much that he calleth the Churche of Rome.
The greatest and the most auncient, knowen to all men, founded and setled by two most glorious Apostles, Peter and Paule.
To this Church by reason of the mightier principalitie, euery Church, that is, the faithful that are euery where must needes agree.
In qua semper ab hys qui sunt vndique conserata est ca quae est ab Apostolis traditio.
In which alwayes that tradition which is from the Apostles hath bene alwaies kept, of them that are round about.
M. Sander calleth it willful ignorance, in M. Iewel, that sayth the mightier principalitie spoken of in Irenaeus, is ment of the ciuill dominion, and Romane Empire, whereas it hath relation to the former titles of commendation, that it was the greatest and the most auncient: the greatest he sayth, because it was fownded by Peter the greatest Apostle, but so sayth not Irenaeus, for he sayth it was founded by two most glorious Apostles, and not by Peter alone.
It was then greatest, because the greatest number of Christians were in Rome, as the greatest citie.
But howe is it the most auncient? but in respect of Peters senioritie, for otherwise Ierusalem and Antioche were auncienter in tyme.
aunswer two wayes, first it is sophisticall to vrge the superlatiue degree grammatically, as when we saye, potentissimo principi, to the most mightye prince, doctissimo viro, to the best learned man, &c.
We doe not meane, that no Prince is equall or superiour in power, nor that no ma~ is equall or superiour in learning, to him whome we so commende, but to shewe the power and learning of those persons to be excellent great.
Secondly aunswer, that Irenaeus speaketh coniunctly, it is sophisticall to vnderstande seuerally.
He saith there is no Church of such greatnes, so auncient, and so well knowen, as the Church of Rome.
From this blinde collection out of Irenaeus, he commeth downe groping to Cyprian, who speaking of certayne factious heretikes, that sayled from Carthage to Rome, to complayne of Saint Cyprian and other Bishops of Afrike to Pope Cornelius.
They dare cary letters from schsmaticall and prophane men vnto the chayer of Peter, and the principall Churche, from whence the priestly vnitie beganne, Nether consider that they are Romanes, whose fayth is pray sed by the report of the Apostle vnto whom falshod can haue none accesse.
In this saying we must note the priuiledges of S. Peters supremacie, to be at Rome.
This is S. Peters chayer, that is his ordinary power of teaching, &c. Nay rather the Bishops seate, which he and Paule did set vp there as Irenaeus sheweth, li.
There is the principal Church, because the Bishop of Rome succeedeth the prince of the Apostles.
Nay rather, because it is the greatest Church, being gathered in the greatest citie of the world, as Ireneus also calleth it.
The priestly vnitie beganne not in Rome but in Peter, therefore there is the whole authoritie of Peter.
The argument is nought, the beginning of vnitie proueth not authoritie.
this worde vnitie doth import, that as Peter alone had in him the whole power of the cbiefe sheepeheard, so Cornelius his successor hath in him the same power.
This argument is of small importance, for nether had Peter alone such power, nor any of his successors.
where he sayth infidelitie can haue no accesse to the Romanes, what other thinge is it, then to saye in the Church of Rome he vuleth for whose faith Christ prayed.
Christ prayed for the faith of all his Apostles, and of all his Disciples, to the ende of the worlde.
Beside this, Maister Sander translateth perfidia which signifieth falshood or false dealing, infidelitie, secondly that which Cyprian sayth of all the faythfull Romanes, he draweth to his Pope, thirdly where Cyprian sheweth howe longe they shall continue without falshoode, namely so long as they retayne the fayth praysed by the Apostle, he maketh it perpetuall to the sea of Rome: whereas the Romanes them selues write to Cyprian of those prayses of the Apostle, quarum laudum gloriae degenerem fuisse, maximum crimen est.
Of which prayses and glorye to be growne out of kinde, it is the greatest cryme.
Finally if Cyprian had thought the Pope and Churche of Rome coulde not erre, he woulde neuer haue mayntayned an opinion against them, as he did in rebaptisinge them that were baptised by heretikes.
We must adde heareto, that Cyprian calleth Rome Ecclesiae Catholicae matricem radicem, the mother roote of the Catholike church.
we find not Rome so called there, we find that Cyprian his fellowes, exhorted all such troublesome persons, as went ouer sea, caried false tales, Vt Ecclesiae Catholicae matrice~ radiem agnoscerent tenerent, that they woulde acknowledg holde the mother and roote of the Catholike Church, by which wordes, they disswaded them from ioygninge with schismatikes, who being condemned in one Church, would gad vp and downe for absolution in an other.
did not S. Cyp. confesse Cornelius to haue receiued the appellation of Rasilides lawfully, out of Spaine li. Ep. There is no word of any such confession or appellation, in that epistle.
But rather, if you suppose an appellation a restitution by the Byshop of Rome, Cyprian
bishops with him, determine the same restitution to be voide of none effect: Neque rescindere ordinationem ire perfectam potest, quod Basilides post crimina sua detecta, conscientiam propria confessione nudatam, Romam pergens, Stephanum collegam nostrum longe positum gestae rei ac veritatis ignarum fefellit, vt ambiret reponi se miustè in episcopatum, de quo fucrat iustè depositus.
Haec eò pertinent vt Basilidis, non tam abolita sint quam cumulata delicta, vt ad superiora peccata eius, etiam fallaciae circumuentionis crimen accesseris.
Neque enim tam culpandus est ille cui negligenter obreptu~, quam hic execra~dus qui fraudulenter obrepsit.
Obrepere aute~ hominibus Basilides potuit, Deo no~ potest, cu~ script sit, Deus non irridetur: Neither can it make frustrate the ordination lawfully made, Basilides after his crimes were detected, his co~scie~ce opened by his owne confession, going to Rome, hath deceiued our fellow bishop Stephan, being farre of ignora~t of matter of truth, he might a~bitiously seeke to be vniustlye restored into his bishoprick fro~ w~ he was iustly deposed These things tend to this ende, that the offences of Basilides, are not so much abolished as increased, so that to his former sinnes the cryme of deceifulnesse and circumuention is added.
For neither is he so much to be blamed who was negligently deceiued, as he is to bee abhorred, which did craftely deceiue him.
But if Basilides could deceiue men, he coulde not deceiue God, seeing it is written, God is not mocked.
Heere is no lawefull appellation spoken of, but the Bishope of Romes sentence pronounced voyde, and he blamed for his negligence and rashnesse, to medle with matters whereof he coulde haue no knowledge, by meanes of distance of place.
reply, that he is not reproued for taking such appellations, he must heare what Cyprian sayth of such appellations which began to be vsed in his daies, vnto Cornelius B. of Rome immediatly after the woordes cyted by him. lib. epi.
of those schismatikes that were so bolde as to sayle to Rome, and carry letters as aboue.
Quae autem causa veniendi pseudoepiscopum contra episcopos factum nunciandi? Aut enim placet illis quod fecerunt in suo scelere perseuerant, aut si displicet recedunt, sciunt quo reuertantur.
Nam cum statutu~ sit omnibus nobis, aequum sit pariter iustu~, vt vniusuius{que} causa illic audiatur, vbi est crimen admissum, singulis pastoribus portio gregis sit ascripta, quam regat vnusquis{que} gubernet, rationem sui actus Domino redditurus, oportet vtique eos quibus presumus non circumcrsare, nec episcoporum concordiam coherentem sua subdola fallaci emeritate collidere.
Sed agere illic causam suam, vbi accusatores habere testes sui criminis possint, nisi paucit desperatis perditis, minor videtur esse auctoritas episcoporum in Africa constitutorum, qui iam de illis iudicauerunt eorum conscientiam multis delictorum laqueis vincta~ iudicij sui nuper grauitate damnaru~t: But what cause had they to come and to report that a false Byshop was made against the Byshops: For either that which they haue done pleaseth them, they continew in their wickednesse, or if it displease the~, and they goe back from it, they knowe whether they shoulde returne.
For wheras it is decreed of vs all, is also meete and right, that euery mans cause should be hard there, where the crime was committed, and a portion of the flocke is committo euery Pastor, which euery one ought to rule and gouerne, as he that shall yeelde an account of his doings to the Lord: verily it behoueth them ouer whome wee haue rule, not to runne about, neither by their craftie deceitful rashnes to crase the concord of Byshops agreing togither: but there to plead their matter wher they may haue both accusers and witnesses of their crime, except the authoryty of the Byshops ordeined in Africa seemeth to a few desperate and wicked fellowes to bee lesse, which haue already iudged of them, and condemned their consciences, bounde with the waight of their iudgement in many cordes of their offences.
This place of Cyprian declareth not onely that the Byshopps of Africa, had decreede against such appellations, but also that they thought theyr authoritie nothing inferior to the Byshops of Italy, nor to the byshop of Rome him self.
note out of Cyprian is, That he required Stephanus the Pope, to depose Marcianus the Byshop of Arles in Fraunce, which to dee in an other prouince is a signe that the Pope of Rome is aboue other Bishops.
If it were true that M. Sander sheweth, it might proue the Bishop of Rome, to be a Primate or Metropolitane, it coulde not proue him to be a Byshop ouer all the world.
But it is vtterly false, that he saith, Cyprian required the Pope Stephan to depose him, for he was deposed by the iudgement of all the Byshops of the Weste Churche: Ab viuersis sacerdotibus iudicatus, condemned of all the Priestes, onely hee exhorteth Stephan of Rome, which was neglige~t in this behalfe, to ioyne with the reste of the Byshoppes of Fraunce in ordering of another Byshopp in his steade, who long since hath beene excommunicated and deposed from his place, for taking parte with Nouatiane the Heretike.
And lest you should think the whole mtter to be referred to the Byshop of Rome, these are is words in the same Epistle. li,
Id circo enim frater charissime, copiosum corpus est sacerdotum concordiae mutuae glutine at{que} vnitatis vinculo copulatum vt si quis ex collegio nostro haeresm facere gregem Christi lacerare vastare tentauerit, subueniant caeteri quasi pastores vtiles misericordes, oues dominicas in gregem coligant: For therfore most welbeloued brother, the bodie or fellowshippe of priestes is plentifull, beeing coupled togither by the Glewe of mutuall concorde, and the bande of Amitie, so that if any of our company shall assay to make an heresie, or to rente or waste the flocke of Christ, the reste should giue ayde, and as profitable and mercifull shepheards gather againe the Lords sheepe into his folde.
note is, That notwithstanding Cyprian dissented from Pope Stephanus in opinion concerning the baptizing of suchas had ben baptised by herekes, yet hee denyed not his prerogatiue.
but kept still the vnitie of the militant Church, in acknowledging the visible head thereof.
He quoteth his ep. Contra Stephan, wherin is no word of acknowledging the Popes prerogatiue, but contrary wise euery childe may see, that seeing he did boldly dissent in opinon fro~ the B. of Rome, wrote against him, he helde no such prerogatiue of that sea, as the Papists now maintaine, that the bishop of Rome cannot erre.
In deede Cyprian professeth, that notwithstanding he differed from him in opinion, yet he would not depare from the vnitie of the Church, but what is this for acknowledging of a visible head, wherof M. S. speaketh much, but Cyprian neuer a word, neither in that place, nor in any of all his workes.
The next authoritie is Hippolitus whose words Prud rehearseth: Peristeph in passion Hip. Respondetfugite &c. Hs aunsvvere vvas flee the ssmes of cursed Nouates lre: And to the Catholike flke and stocke, your selues againe restore.
Let onely one faith rule and ragne, kept in the Church of olde: VVhich faith both Paule doth sl retaine Peters chair doth hold
No dout this was a good exhortation, so longe as the temple of Peter ad Paule at Rome did holde the olde catholike faith: from which seeing the Pope is now fled, we may not honor the emptie chaire of Peter, to think there is his faith, where his doctrine is not.
After Hippolitus, followeth Sozomenus, who reporteth that Athanasius and certaine other Byshops of the Greeke Church came to Rome to Iulius the byshopp there, to complaine that they were vniustly deposed by the Arians.
Wherevpon the Byshop of Rome finding them vpon examination to agree with the Nicene cou~cel did reeiue them into the communion as one that had care of them all, for the worthynes of his owne See, and did restore to euery of them their owne Churches.
&c. Heere M. Sander hath his obseruations, he delighteth much in that number.
But it shall not neede to stand vpon them, it is co~fessed that in Sozomenus time, the writer of this story, who iudgeth of things done according to the present state in which he lyued, the sea of Rome was growne into great estimation, and counted the first See or principall in dignitie of all Byshops Seas in the worlde.
Yea, it is true that Socrates a writer of Historyes as well as he sayeth, That long before his time, the Byshops Sea of Rome aswel as of Alexandria, was growne beyonde the bands of Presthood, into a forraine Lordship dominion.
But if we consider the recordes of the very time in which Iulius lyued, we shall not finde that the dignitie of his Sea was such, as that he hadde such authoritie as Sozomenus aseribeth to him, and much lesse such as M. Sander imagineth of him.
In Epiphanius there is an Epistle of one Marcellus, which beside that he called him his fellow minister, acknowledgeth no such dignitie of his Sea lib.
And Sozomenus himselfe testifyeth that the Bishops of the East, derided contemned his commandementes. lib.
they were as bolde to depose him with the byshops of the West, as he was to check them, that they called not him to their councel.
Wherein as confesse, they did euell, yet thereby they shewed euidently, that the Christian worlde in those dayes, did not acknowledge the vsurpation of the bishop of Rome, as M. Sander saith they did.
Neither durst they eaer to dissent from him, if it had beene a Catholike doctrine receiued in the Church, that the Byshopp of Rome is head of the Church, Byshop of all Byshops, Iudge of all causes, and one which cannot erre.
As for Athanasius, Paulus, &c. and other Byshops beeing tossed to and fro, by their enemyes, no maruaile if they were glad to finde any comfort at the Byshop of Romes hands, hauing first sought to the Emperors for refuge, of whome sometime they were holpe~, sometime they wer hindred as informatio~ was giuen either for them or against the~.
But Arnobius he sayeth giueth a maruailous witnes for the church of Rome in Psa.
Petrus in deserto. &c Peter wandering in the desert of this worlde, vntill he came to Rome, preached the baptisme of Iesus Christ in whome all floods are blessed from Peter vnto this day.
He hath made the going forth of the waters into thirst, so that he which shall goe forth of the Church of Peter shal perish for thirst.
It is a maruelous witte of M. Sander, that can find such maruelous prerogatiue of Peter, in this place which Arnobius would haue in the example of Peter to be vnderstoode of all men.
Quid est ascendunt? Disce in Petro, vt quod in ipso inueneris, in omnibus cernas.
What meaneth this they goe vp as highe as heauen? Learne in Peter, to thend that yt which thou shalt find in Peter, thou mayst see in all men.
Peter went vp as high as heauen, when he sayd: Although should dye with thee, yet will not deny thee &c. and so applying the vnderstanding of the Psalme to Peter, and in him to all Christia~s, he co~meth to that maruelous testimony of the church of Rome, which M. Sander reporteth, shewing how after his repentance God exalted him to be a preacher of that baptisme of Iesus Christ in whome all floodes are blessed from Peter to this day.
Where M. Sander vseth a false translation, saying the floodes are blessed of Peter, and expoundeth the floodes to be the churches, whereas Arnobius speaketh of all waters, which in Christ are sanctified to the vse of baptisme, from the Apostles time vntill this day.
But it is a Catholike argument that whosoeuer goeth out of the Church of Peter, goeth out of the Church of Christe, therefore Rome is the mother Church and Peter the heade thereof.
Euen lyke this, whosoeuer goeth out of the Church of Paule, or of any of the Apostles wheresoeuer they planted it, doth perish therefore Corinth and Paule, or any other Citie the Apostle that preached there, may be taken for the head and Pastor, and mother Church of all other, yet is this with M. Sander a meruailous testimony.
Negare nonpotes. &c. Thou canst not deny, but that thou knowest that to Peter first the bishops chaire was giuen in the citie of Rome, in which Peter the head of al the apostles hath sit: wherofhe was also called Cephas, in which chair vnitie might be kept of al men, so that he should be a scismatike wc should place any other chaire against the singular chaire.
Vnto Peter succeeded Linus, vnto Linus succeded Clemens, so nameth all the Byshops vntil Siricius which liued in his time, of whom he saith, Qui noster est socius, which is our fellow.
In this sentence Optatus laboreth to proue against the Donatists which were scismatikes, that ther is but one Catholike church fro~ which they were departed.
He vseth the argume~t of vnitie commended in Peters chaire whom he calleth head of the Apostles in respecte of vnitie, not of authority, which appeareth by this that in the end he accounteth Syricius bishop of Rome and Peters successor, not head of all Churches nor vniuersall Bishop of al Bishops, but Socius noster, our fellowe or companion, as one consenting with him in the vnitie of that Church, which was first planted by the Apostles, and not as a generall gouernor of the vniuersall Church of Christe.
Wherefore although Optatus doe more the~ was necessary vrge this argument of the vnitie of Peters Chaire, yet his meanining was not to set foorth an vnrepr ouable authoritie thereof, such as the Pope nowe challengeth, but onely to make it tbe beginning of vnitie.
At length he commeth to S. Hierome in an Epistle to Damasus, out of whiche he gathereth diuers sentences.
thought it beste to aske councel of the Chaire of Peter, of the saith praysed by the mouth of the Apostle.
speake with the successor of a fisher, and with a difciple of the crosse.
following none first but Christe, am ioyned in communion with thy blessednesse, that is with the Chaire of Peter.
VVhosoeuer shall eate the Lambe out of this house he is vnholy.
If any man le out of the Arke of Noe during the time of the Floude, hee shall perishe.
knowe not Vatis, despise Melitius, haue no acquaintance with Paulinus, whosoeuer doth not gather with thee, he doth scatter abrode, that is, he that is not of Christe, is of Antichriste.
The conclusion openeth all the matter as longe as Damasus Byshop of Rome, gathereth with Christe, that is mayntameth true doctrine, Hierome will gather with him, who professed before that he woulde followe none as first, but Christe, For he woulde not haue gathered with Liberius Byshoppe of Rome, whome hee confesseth to haue subscrybed to the Arians that were Hereukes in Catal.
What mockery is it then to drawe the commendations of a good Catholike Byshop maintaining true Doctrine, to euery Byshoppe sitting in that seate, agreeing neither in doctrine nor manners with that Christian predecessor.
The Heauenly maister maketh the people secure, concerning euil ouerseers, lest for their sakes the Chaire of healthful doctrine shoulde be sorsaken, in whiche Chaire euill men are euer constrayned to say good thinges, for the thinges whiche they speake are not their owne.
Heere sayeth Maister Sander wee haue a Chaire of healthfull doctrine, and that is afterwarde called the Chaire of vnitie, therefore it is not the Chayre of euery Byshop, which are many, and of which many haue beene Heretikes, but the only chayre of the bishop of Rome, in which Chaire the Pope be he neuer so euill, is constrayned to say good thinges and cannot erre.
But seeing haue often proued that many Byshops sitting in that Chayre of Rome haue spoken euill thinges, and were fylthy Heretikes, it followeth, that this is not a wodden Chayre that Augustine speaketh of, but the Chayre of true doctrine, such as the Chayre of Moses was, in which not onely Aaron and his successors, but euen the Scrybes and Pharisees did sit, hauing the authoritie of Moses, while they vttered nothing but that which God deliuered by Moses.
But when they preached false doctrine they did not sit in the chaire of Moses, but in the chayre of pestilence, as the Pope all other heretikes doe.
He talketh much of vnitie in S, Peter, in his chaire, seae and succession, as though any of these, were worth a straw, without vnitie in S. Peters doctrine, which was the doctrine of Christ.
But Sainct Augustine Contr epist fundament confesseth that the successio~ of priestes from Saint Peter vnto this present time stayed him in the Catholike Church.
It is true, he confesseth that this succession amonge many thinges was one that stayed him.
And yet he acknowledgeth that the manifest trueth, Praeponenda est omnibus illis rebus quibus in Catholica tener, is to be preferred before all thinges by which am stayed in the Catholike Church, namely before antiquitie, consent of nations, miracles, succession of Byshops and the name of Catholikes.
Likewise rehearsing the same things in a manner against the Donatistes which Maister Sander hath not omitted.
Hee sayeth, Quamuis non tam de istis documentis presumanus quam de Scripturis sanctis.
Although we presume not so much of these documents as of the holy spriptures.
Wherefore as the argument of sucessio~, was wel vsed against heretikes, so long as there was succession of doctrine with succession of persons: so now to alleadge the onely succession of persons where the doctrin is cleane changed, is as folish ridiculous, as by shewing of emptie dishes, to proue abundance of victuals, or showing vessels ful of filthy waters, to proue that they are full of good wine, because meate of olde time, hath beene serued in such dishes, and wine preserued in such vessels.
But if the authoritie of one man as Saint Augustine was, seeme little M. San. bringeth the two councels gatheredin Africa Numidia, against the Pelagia~s which sent their decrees to the Sea of Rome, That the authoriof the Apostolke Sea might be giuen to them Epi.
if they required the B. of Rome to agree with the~ in the truth, what pretogtiue of supremacie do they grau~t vnto him? Nay rather they do piuly reprehend him, that he had so long suffred the Pelagian poyson to be spread vnder his nose in Europe, and the doctriue neither called to examination, nor confuted, yea rather seemed to co~sent to the den of the bishops of the East, that Pelagius was iustly absolued.
that they had kept the customs of the olde tradition, in referring the matter to his Sea and sayth, That the sathers not by humaine but by diuine sentence haue decreed that what soeuer was done in the prouinces a farre of, they should not account it before to be ended, except it came to the knhwledge of this sea, where whatsoeuer had beene iustly pronounced should be coufirmed by the authoritie of this sea, and those other churches should take it as it were waters which should flow from their owne natiue fountain.
We know the ambitious Ep. of Innocentius if it be not counterfeted, because many patches therof are found in other decretal epistles but we deny that ye authoritie which he pretended, was acknowledged by these two councels, yes saith M. S. the fathers of the Mileuitan councel say: Arbitramur &c. VVe think these men that haue so pernitious and froward opinions will giue plae more easily to the authority of your holines, beeing taken out of the authoritie of the holy Scriptures, by help of the mercy of our lord Iesus Christ which ouchfeth to rule you when you consult to heare you whe~ you pray by these words they shew, that they hope ye here tikes being reproued by the B. of Rome out of the wod of God, wil the rather giue place, wt out imagining, that the B. of Romes authoritie is so stablished by the scriptures that whatsoeuer he decre co~trary to thescriptures the same should be imbraced But a farther confirmatio~ of the epistle of Innoce.
Where he saith, Pope Innocent did write an answere to the Bishops in althings, as it became the prelate of the Apostolike sea.
But these words neither proue that epistle to be written by Innocent, nor if it were, do allowe his pretended auth ority, because that was no matter whereof they required his answere.
Both these Councels haue decreed against the vsurpation of the Romish sea.
decreed that no man should appeele out of Africa, vnder paine of excommunication.
In which alwayes the principalitie of the Apostolike chaire hath flourished.
matter often confessed that the fathers especially of the later times since Constantine aduanced the Church in wealth dignitie, esteemed the church of Rome as the principall Sea in dignitie, but not in absolute authoritie, such as in processe of time the Byshops of Rome claymed and vsurped.
Bishops refused to yeelde to the Bishop of Rome, clayming by a counterfaire Canon of the Councell of Nice, to haue authortie to receaue appeales out of Africa.
Aphr. ad Bonifac. whiche they coupte an intollerable pride and presumption, and in Epist. cont.
Aphri. ad Coelestim fumosum typum seculi, smokey pride of the worlde which the Pope claymed and an absurde authoritie, that one ma~ should be better able to examine such causes, then so many Byshops, of the prouince where the controuersie began, and by the olde Cannons shoulde be ended.
To Augustine he ioyneth Prosper Bishop of Rhegiu~ in Italie which affirmeth in lib de ingrat. that Rome the see of Peter was the first that did cut of the pestilence of Pelagius, which Rome being made head vnto the worlde of pastorall honor holdeth by religion whatsoeuer it doth not possesse by warre.
Rome through the primacie of the Apostolike Priesthoode, is made greater by the castell of religion, then by the throne of power.
First how vntruly he boasteth that the see of Peter, was the first that did cut of the heresie of Pelagius you may ease see, by that the councel of Africa did before condemne it, had somwhat a doe to perswade Innocentius Bishop of Rome to it.
Whereby you see, that Prosper was ouer partiall to the see of Rome, to whome yet he ascribeth a principallity or primacy of honor, not of power or auctority.
The testimonies of Leo Gregory Bshops of Rome as alwaies, so now deeme to be vnmeete to be heard in their owne cause, though otherwise they were not the worst men, yet great furtherers of the auctoritie of Antichrist, which soone after their dayes, tooke possessio~ of the chaire, which they had helped to prepare for him.
The last testimonie out of Beda which liued vnder the tyranny of Antichrist, will not stande vpon, M. Sander may haue great store of such late writers to affirme the Popes supremacie.
THat the good Christian Emperours and Princes, did neuer thinke the~ selues to be the supreame heads of the church in spirituall causes, but gaue that honor to Bishops, Priests, most specially to the sea of Rome, for S. Peters sake, as well before, as after the time of Phocas.
Phocas did not first make the see of Rome head of all churches.
COncerning the supremacy of our soueraigne, which this traiterous Papist doth so maliciously disdaine, although it be expounded sufficiently by her Maiestie in her iniunction, not to be suche as he most slaunderously doth deforme it, yet will here, as haue done diuerse times before in aunswere to these Papistes, professe, that we ascribe no supremacie to our Prince, but such as the worde of God alloweth in the godly Kinges of the old Testament, and the church hath acknowledged in the Christian Emperours and Princes vnder the new Testament.
First therefore we ascribe to our Prince no absolute power, in any Ecclesiasticall causes, suche as the Pope challengeth, but subiect vnto the rules of Gods worde.
Secondly we ascribe no supremacie of knowledge in Ecclesiastical matters to our Prince, but affirme that she is to learne of the Bishops and teachers of the church, both in matters of faith and of the gouernment of the church.
Thirdly we allow no confusion of callings, that the Prince should presume to preach, to minister the Sacramentes, to excommunicate, &c. which perteine not to her office.
But the supremacie we admit in Ecclesiasticall causes, is auctoritie ouer all persons to co~maund, and by lawes to prouide, that all matters Ecclesiasticall, may be ordered and executed according to the word of God.
And such is the true meaning of the othe, that he calleth blasphemous and intollerable.
And as for examples of honor geuen to the Bishoppes by Christian Princes, which he bringeth forth, they deny not this supremacy, nor make any thing against it.
The first is of the Emperour Philippus, counted of some for the first Christian Emperor, although it be not like to be true, yet admitting the story written by Eusebius to be so.
This Prince without due repentance, offered him selfe to receaue the holy misteries, being refused by the Bishop of the place, tooke it pacie~tly, submitted him selfe to the discipline order of ye church.
answer, this example toucheth not the auctority he had in ecclesiasticall causes.
For in receauing of the Sacramentes, the Prince differeth not from a priuate person.
But he pusheth at M. Nowell with a two horned argument, called a dilemma.
If the Priest in these causes, be superior to yt Emperor, other causes be greater or lesser then these.
If they be greater, the Emperour which is not supreame gouernor ouer the lesser causes, can not be in the greater, if they be lesser, then the Priest wc gouerneth the Emperor, in greater causes, must nedes gouern him in lesser causes.
These hornes are easily auoyded not by distinctio~ of the causes, but of the gouernments.
The gouernment of the Prince is one, of the Priest an other: this spiritual, the other external, therefore no contrariety betwene them.
For put the case, that Philippus had seene the Bishop prophane the sacrament, in ministring to infidels, or otherwise vncertainly behauing him selfe in his office, might he not iustly haue punished him, as supreame gouernour ouer the Bishoppe euen in those matters? say not to doe them, but to see that they be well done, and to punishe the offendors.
And according to this meaning, M. Nowell, M. Horne and M. Iewel dare warrant the King to be supreame gouernour in all Ecclesiasticall causes, although it please M. Sander to say, the contrarie of them.
Whose trayterous quarelling vpon the wordes of the othe, ought not to trouble any mans co~science, when the meaning is publikelie testified both by the Prince, and by the whole consent of the church.
The next exa~ple is of Constantinus the great, which in the Synode of Nice, when the Bishops had offered vnto him bills of complaint, one against an other, without disclosing the contentes of them, he sayd, as Ruffinus reporteth lib.
Deus vos constituit sacerdotes &c. God hath made you Priestes, and hath giuen you power to iudge of vs also, and therfore we are rigtly iudged of you, but ye can not be iudged of m~e.
For which cause, expect ye the iudgement of God alone among ye.
Here M. Sander noteth, first, that he calleth them Priestes, whereby he woulde proue, they had power to offer externall sacrifice, which is a simple reason, for then all Christian men women within the Scripture are called Priestes, haue the same power.
Secondly he co~fesseth, they haue power to iudge the Emperour, for none can be greater then a Priest: In their challenge and spirituall gouernment, the Emperour meaneth, and not as the Popish church practised, to dispose the Emperour.
If this be so, one Priest can not be iudged of an other, and where is then the Popes supremacie, but he aunswereth, if one Priest iudge an other, it is Gods iudgement, and not the iudgement of men, because God hath set one Priest aboue another.
blockish aunswere: as though God hath not set one Prince aboue all his subiectes.
You see howe Popish Priestes aduaunce them selues, to the honor of God, and withdraw their obedience from Gods Lieutenaunts on earth.
You will aske me then, what sence these wordes haue, you can not be iudged of men? aunswere either they are ment, as Sainct Paule speaketh, of the vprightnes of his conscience in doing of his office, which is not subiect to the iudgement of men, or else Ruffinus as he was a bolde reporter, frameth the Emperours wordes, accordng to that estimation which he woulde haue men to haue of the clergie.
For it is certeyne by recordes of Constantinus time, that he did iudge Bishoppes and tooke vpon him as supreame gouernour in ecclesiasticall causes, Maister Sander confesseth, he iudged certeyne Priests, or ecclesiasticall causes, but he did it as Augustine sayeth, Epist.
as one that would afterward aske pardon of the holy Bishops, at the importunitie of the Donatists: And as Optatus recordeth he sayd, Deschis. lib.
Petitis me &c. Ye aske of me iudgement in the world, whereas my selfe looke for Christes iudgement.
And Augustine reproueth the Donatistes that they would haue an earthly King to be iudge of their cause.
In deede the importunitie of the Donatistes was wicked who would so referre the matter to the Emperour, yt without knowledge of ecclesiasticall persons, who were only meete iudges in respect of knowledge in that case, they would haue ye cause decided.
But the Emperour acknowledging his auctoririe appointed iudges ecclesiastical persons, first the Bishop of Rome Melchiades, whom he commau~ded with other Bishops to heare the cause of Caecilianus, as Eusebius who ued in his time writeth li.
And whe~ the Donatists appealed from the Bishops of Rome his co~panions iudgement, he appointed other delegates, as Augustine also witnesseth.
But to leaue this cause of the Donatistes Eusebius in his life libr.
sayeth of him: Quoniam nonnulli variis locis inter se discrepabant, quasi communis quidem Episcopus Deo constitutus, ministrorum Dei synodos conuocauit, ne dedignatus est adesse, considere in illorum medio.
Because some of them in diuerse places were at variance among them selues, he as a certeine generall Bishop appointed of God, called together the synodes of the ministers of God, and disdayned not to be present, and to sit in the middest of them.
He sheweth howe he gathered the vniuersall synode of Nice, as it were leading foorth the armie of God to battell.
To this Emperour did Athanasius the great, Bishoppe of Alexandria, appeale from the synode of Tyre, where he was iniuriously handled, as both Socrates testifieth lib.
and the verie Epistle of Constantine him selfe vnto that synode, commaunding all the Bishoppes to come vnto his presence, and there to shewe before him, (quem syncerum esse Dei ministrum neque vos sanè negabitis, whome you can not deny to be a syncere minister of God) how sincerely they had iudged in that councell.
Finally in the end of the epistle he protesteth, that he wil execute his supremacie in causes ecclesiastical.
Omni virtute conabor agre quatens quae in lege Dei sunt ea praecipuè sine aliqu titubatione seruentur quibus vti{que} ne{que} vituperatio ne{que} mal superstitio poteris implicari dispersis vti{que} ac palam contritis, penitus exterminatis sacratissimae legis inimicis, qui sub schemate sancti nominis blasphemas varias ad diuersos inijciant.
will endeuour with all my might to bringe to passe, that those thinges that are in the lawe of God, those chiefly without any staggering may be obserued, which by no reproofe or euill superstition can be intangled, when all the enemyes of the moste holye law, which vnder a shape of an holy name, doe cast out diuerse blasphemies vnto sondry persons, are dispersed openly troden downe, and vtterly rooted out.
Let this suffice to shewe what supremacie Constantinus did exercise in causes Ecclesiasticall.
Nowe Maister Sander draweth vs to see, what honour he gaue to the see of Rome.
First he taketh it for most certayne, that Constantine was baptised by Syluester, which is an impudent lye and forged fable, as is manifest by Eusebius, who liued in his tyme and after him, who knewe him familiarly, and affirmeth that he was baptised in his iorney towardes Iordane, where he had purposed to haue bene baptised, if God had spared him life.
But this manifest testimonye of Eusebius, Maister Sander refuseth, becaue he was suspected for affection to the Arrian heresi.
Beside that he was vniustly suspected, what reason is it, to discredit his story, who wrote at such tyme, as many thousands aliue could disproue him, for any affection to that heresie, whereto the baptisme of Constantine pertayned nothinge in the worlde? As for the stones and pillers of marble, in which any such matter is grauen, bearing the name of his baptistry except Maister Sander could proue, that they were sette vppe in his tyme, are simple witnesses against the historye of Eusebius, which lyued in his tyme.
Nether the forged pontificall of Damasus, nor the writings of Beda.
Ado, Marianus, Gregorius Turene~sis, Zonarus, Nicephorus late writers, following the fable of the Romish Church, are of any credit in respect of Eusebius, and the eldest writers of the Ecclesiasticall story, that agree with Eusebius that he was not baptised many yeares after Syluester was deade.
And concerning the donation of Constantine, it is too absurd for any wise man to defend, which hath bene so long before disproued by Laurentius Valla, no enemy of the Romish religion, although a discouerer of that fable.
Agayne his forsaking of the citie of Rome, and building of Constantinople, is as great a fable, for although he bewtified Byzantium, and made it an imperiall citye, as placed conueniently to keepe the Orientall Empire, yet he forsooke not Rome, but still retayned it as the chiefe see of his Empire, so did the Emperours that followed him, vntill (after it was wasted by the barbarous nations,) they made lesse accompt of it.
And therefore although Constans the Nephew of Heraclius could not conueniently remoue thether, yet he remoued fro~ thence what he thought good, by which it appeared he had authoritie in the citie, by the prouidence of God and not by chaunce, as M. Sander dreameth, that he was prohibited by Gods prouidence in respect of the Popes supremacie, or els the world should be gouerned by chaunce.
But leauing Constantinus the father, we must come to Constantius his sonne which was an Arrian, of whom Athanasius complayneth, that he had no reuerence of the Bishop of Rome Ep. ad Solit. vit. agen. nether considering that it was an Apostolike see, nor that Rome was the mother citie of the Romane Empire.
There were other Apostolikes sees beside Rome, and the Christian worlde was larger then the Romane Empire, therefore this maketh nothing for the singular prerogatiue of that see.
But the noble Emperours Gratianus, Valentinianus Theodosius made a law, lege
Cod. de summ. trinit That all their people should continue in that religion, as the religion which is vsed from S. Peter vnto this day doth declare him to haue deliuered to the Romanes, and which it is euident that Bishop Damasus doth follow, and Peter Bishop of Alexandria a man of Apostolike holines.
This law proueth, that the Emperours had authoritie in Ecclesiasticall causes.
And that they ioyned the Patriarch of Rome with the Patriarch of Alexandria, not because he of Alexandria agreed with him of Rome, but because they both agreed with Peter, and Peter with Christ.
From these Emperours, he commeth to Bonifacius, who writing to the Emperour Honorius, and humbly desiring his ayde to appease the tumults of his Church, vseth these wordes.
Ecclesiae meae cui Deus noster meum sacerdotiu~ (vobisres humanas regentibus) deputauit, cura constringit, ne causis eius quamuis adhuc corporis incommoditate detinear, propter conuntus qui sacerdotibus vniuersis, clricis, Christianae plebis perturbationibus agitantur, apud aures Christianissimi principis desim.
The care of my church to which our God hath deputed my priesthood, while you gouerne the affayres of men, doth bind me, that although am yet withholden by infirmitie of bodye, should not be wanting to the causes thereof in the hearing of a most Christian Prince, by reason of the meetings that are held of all the Priestes and the Clergie with the perturbations of the Christian people.
These words shewe, that the Emperour was supreame gouernour in causes Ecclefiastill, for he writeth concerning the election of the Bishop.
To whom the Emperour answereth making a lawe against the ambitious labouring for succession, that if two Bishops should be chosen, they should be both banished out of the citie.
haue set downe the wordes at large to shewe the shamefull salsification of M. Sander, who setteth them downe absolutely thus.
Mihi Deus noster mewn sacerdotium vobis res humanas rege~tibus deputauit.
Our God hath appoynted my priesthood to me, whereas you doe gouerne worldly matters.
As though he had denied to the Emperour, all gouernment in Ecclesiasticall causes, whe~ he flyeth to his authoritie in a cause Ecclesiasticall, and doth not onely acknowledge him to be a conseruer of ciuill peace as M. Sander would haue it.
To Honorius he ioyneth Galla Placidia the Emperesse in her epistle to Theodosius, set before the councell of Chalcedon, Assirming that Peter ordayned the primacy of the Bishoply office in the see Apostolike.
Thus wrote the Emperesse or her Secretary, and so it was taken in that time.
The like sayth Valentinianus in his Epistle to Theodosius his father, that antiquitie gaue the chiefy of priestly power to the Bishop of the citie of Rome.
And Martianus with Valentinian confesse that the Synode of Chalcedon inquired of the faith by the authoritie of Leo Bishop of the euerlasting citie of Rome.
Adde hereunto that the councell it selfe confesseth Act. that Leo was ouer them as the head ouer the members.
All these proue in deede a primacy of the Bishop of Rome acknowledged in those dayes, but not such a primacye as is now claymed.
For the same councell and Emperours decreed that the see of Constantinople in the East should haue the same authoritie that the see of Rome had in the West, the title of senioritie onely reserued to the Bishop of Rome.
Although the Bishop of Rome, Leo by letters and his legats in the councell cryed out against it as lowd as they could.
Sedes Apostolica &c, The Apostolike sea ought not to be abased in our presence &c. but all the synode and the Iudges continued in their decree.
The saying of Iustinian in cod de summ. trinit. is examined and aunswered in the
article of M. Sanders treatise which is the true Church, before his booke of Images, as also the sayings of the Bishop of Patara, of Eugenius Bishop of Carthage, and Gregory Bishop of Rome.
The report of the councell of Sinuessa is too full of corruption and confusion to be credited for authenticall authoritie.
And yet it is playne that Marcellinus the Bishop of Rome was conuicted by witnesses to haue committed Idolatry, before he confessed the sinne, and receiued sentence of condemnation and accursing of the Synode, howsoeuer that patche is thrust in after the Actes of the councell, prima sedes, &c. the first see is not iudged of any, which in euery counterfait decretall epistle almost must haue a place.
To proue that Phocas did not first make the see of Rome heade of all Churches, when the history is plaine he did, M. Sander bringeth in these and such like alledgged before, which acknowledged a certaine primacie of the see of Rome.
And certaine it is the Bishops of Rome before Phocas tyme, affected a great primacie, which of many was acknowledged, but yet neuer absolutely, neuer without co~trouersie, vntil Phocas for a great summe of money receyued of Boniface the thirde, strake the stroke, and made the decree, for which in all popish writers he is highly praised: although in the Greeke church his decree was not long obserued.
Touching the examples of Emperours and Princes of later times, although could shewe they haue often resisted the Pope, yet know many may be alledged that haue submitted them selues to his Antichristian tyranny, which will not sta~d to examine, because they can be no preiudice to the truth approued by examples of the eldest age.
As for the history of Lucius king of Britayne, that sent to Eleutherius for preachers, if it were true, it maketh nothinge for the supremacy of the romish Bishop.
will therefore conclude this chapter, with a saying of Socrates in proe. lib. to shew what authoritie he iudged them perours to haue in Ecclesiasticall matters.
Etipsos quidem Imperatores hac historia continua complectimur, prpterea quod ab illis postquam Christiani esse coeperunt, res Ecclesiasticae pendent, maximae Synodi ex illorum sententia congregatae sunt congregantur.
And in this continuall history we comprehend the Emperours them selues, because that vpon them, since they began to be Christians, the matters of the Church depend, and the greatest synods haue bene gathered are gathered by their authoritie.
The punishment he threateth to them that forsake the Church of Rome, shal one day fall vpon them that take part with
THeir doctine who teach the Bishop of Rome to be Aichrist him selfe is confuted by the auctoritie of Gods worde, and by the consent of auncient fathers.
AFter he hath shewed his opinion, what maner a one Antechrist shalbe, alleaged cause of his co~ming out of S. Paul
because men haue not receaued the loue of the truth, that they might be saued, God shal sende the~ the working of error, yt they may beleue lying, &c. he stormeth out of measure against the Protestants, for that they can find no place to setle Antichrist in, but in the see of Rome, so beautified dignified by Christ, and all the primitiue Church: But seeing Antichrist is appoynted to sit in the temple of God, which is a higher place then S. Peters chayer, it is no meruayle if Satan haue thrust him into that see, which of olde tyme was accompted the toppe and castell of all religion.
But let vs see his reasons taken out of Gods word, by which it is proued, that the Pope can not be Antichrist him selfe.
The first is, because in S. Paule he is called [undefined span alphabet] &c. the man of sinne which signifieth one singular man, and not a number of men in succession, and this is affirmed to be the Greeke article in this worde man, by Cyrillus in Ioan. lib.
But how frendly Cyrillus was deceaued, you shall see, by some examples, euen out of the new Testament.
good man out of the good treasure of his heart, and an euill man out of the euil treasure of his heart bringeth &c. where no one singular man is ment.
The Sabboth was made [undefined span alphabet] for man not man for the Sabboth.
Not with breade onely [undefined span alphabet] a man shall liue, but by euery woorde of God.
That the man of God [undefined span alphabet] may be perfect and prepared to euery good woorke.
These places and an hundreth more which might bee brought, doe proue, howe vaine the argument is thatis taken of the nature of the Greke article.
Nether is Hierom or any of the auncient writers to be heard without authoritie of the Scripture, which supposed that Antichrist should be one man.
Although none of them directly affirmeth that he should be one man, as Christ was.
sayth we must not thinke that Antichrist should be a Deuill, but one of the kind of men in whom Satan should dwell.
This proueth not that he should be a singular man, no more then the fourth beast, which signifieth the Roma~e Empire, out of which he should rise, should be one singular Emperour.
No more doth it proue that because Antiochus was a figure of him, he must be but one man.
sayth, Satan shall appeare in homine, in a man, which may signify the kind of men and not one singular person.
Likewise Augustine calling Antichrist the Prince, and last Antichrist, meaneth no one person for the words Prince and last, may agree to a whole succession of men in one state, as well as the wordes king and beaste, to a whole succession of Emperours in Daniel.
To conclude, there is not one whome he nameth, that denyeth Antichrist to be a whole succession of me~, in one state of deuilish gouernment.
And Irenaeus thinketh it probable of the Romane kingdom, lib.
The second argument is, that Antichrist is called the aduersary, therefore is the greatest enemy of Christ, denying Iesus Christ to be God and man, or to be our Mediatour.
aunswer, the Pope doth so, denying the office of Christ, although with the deuills, he confesse in wordes, Iesus to be the holy one of God, and to be Christ the sonne of God.
his diuinitie the Pope denieth, by denying his onely power in sauing, his wisedom in his word to be onely sufficient, his goodnes in the vertue of his death to take away both payne and guylt of sinne, which he arrogateth to him selfe by his blasphemous pardons.
Christes humanitie he denyeth by his transsubstantiation, his mediation, in which he is principally Christ, he denyeth by so many meanes of saluation as he maketh, beside Christ videlicet mans merits, ceremonies inuented by man, pardons, a newe sacrifice of the Masse, &c.
The third argume~t is, that Antichrist shall not come, before the Romane Empire be cleane taken away.
For that which Saint Paule sayth, ye knowe what withholdeth, &c.
Although it be not necessary to expound this of the Romane Empire, yet following the olde writers that so vnderstood it, say the Romane Empire was remoued before Antichrist the Pope was throughly enstalled.
For beside that the see of the Empire was remoued from Rome, the gouernment it selfe was in a manner cleane remoued, the title of the Romane Emperour onely remayning, at last an other Empire by the Pope was erected in Germanye, whereof litle beside a name remayneth at this day, the Pope clayming authoritie of both the swordes, and he that is the Emperour in title, if he haue no landes of his owne inheritance, scarse equall with a Duke by dominion of his Empire.
The fourth argument is, that the deedes doctrine of Antichrist against Christ, must be open and without all dissimulation, because Saint Paule maketh a difference betwene the mysterye of iniquitie, and the open shewing of Antichrist.
aunswer, they are open to all faithfull Christians, although they be hidde from such as be deceiued by Antichrist.
Here M. Sander aunswereth to that which he supposeth might be obiected, that some gloses of ye canon law, call the Pope God, or make him equall with Christ, yea they call him God aboue all Gods: but he thinketh to auoyd it by saying, they call him not God by nature, but by office vnder Christ, where they say he is equall with Christ.
Nether is it to be thought that any man will euer cal him selfe God by nature.
But to omitte these flattering gloses of the canon lawe, doth not the Pope exalt him self aboue all that is called God and worshipped as God.
When he commaundeth to abstayne from meates and mariage, whereof God hath created the one and instituted the other, as good and holy, for greater goodnes and holines then God created or instituted in them.
Doth he not exalt him selfe aboue God the redeemer, when he affirmeth his rede~ption to be, ether onely from sinnes committed before baptisme, or onely from the guilt of sin whereas his popish pardons can absolue from both.
Doth he not extoll him selfe aboue God the holy Ghost, when he taketh vpon him to sanctifie the creatures of the world, otherwise then God hath sanctified them to apply the merits of Christ, otherwise then Gods holy spirite worketh application by faith, &c.
argument is, that Antichrist should be receyued moste speciallye of the Iewes, of which hee bringeth the opinion of diuerse olde writers, but because the Scripture sayth no such thinge, but contrary that he shall sit in the Church of God.
But M. S. alledgeth the saying of Christ Ioan. came in my fathers name, and ye haue not receyued me, if another come in his owne name ye wil receyue him.
This other man sayth M. S. is Antichrist, and so expounded by the auncient fathers.
For Theudas the Egyptian, Cocabas, and such like, deceyued the Iewes in their owne name, yet none of them was this Antichrist.
argument is, that Antichrist according to the prophecy of Daniel cap.
kings, the kings of Egypt, Africa, and Ethiopia, which seeing the Pope hath not done, he is not Antichrist, aunswer, Nether Hierom nor any Ecclesiastical writer, whom he followeth, hath any directition out of the Scripture, for this interpretation, wherefore it is more like, that the Emperour is the litle horne which first diminishing as it were a thirde parte of the strength of the fourth beast, at length began vtterly to oppresse destroy it, meane ye co~mon welth of Rome.
aunswer, this tyme must not be limited by measure of man, but as God hath appoynted it.
Daniell nameth no yeres, but a tyme, tymes, halfe a tyme.
And Hierom in his accompt of daies differeth from S. Iohn Apoc.
reason is, that Helias shall come at the tyme of Antichrist, as Hippolitus, Augustine, Hierom Theodoret teach, who is not yet come, although the Pope haue long florished.
aunswer, The Scripture speaketh of no comming of Helias, but of Christes two witnesses, which haue neuer failed in the greatest heate of the popish tyranny.
reason is, that Antichrist shall be of the try be of Dan, by the inion of Irenaeus, Hippolitus, Theodoretus, and Gregory, whereas the Popes are of no such ribe.
aunswer, the Scripture hath not reualed any such matter, nether doth Irenaeus rest vpon that opinion, but iudgeth he may well be the king of the Romane Empire, saying very wisely.
Certius rgo sine periculo est sustinre adpletionem prophetiae, qua suspcar &c.
Therefore it is more certayne and without daunger, to tary the fulfilling of the prophecy, then to surmise &c. Againe if this opinion should be true, he shoulde not rise out of the Romane Empire, as all olde writers haue consenced he must, according to the prophecye.
argument is, that Antichrist shall not come before the later ende of the world as August ne and Theodoretus iudged. but Gregory seeing the ambition of Iohn of Constantinople affirmed, that the tyme of the reuelation of Antichrist was euen at hand, and that the same Iohn was the forerunner of Antichrist, and Antichrist should shortly be reucaled, an army of Priests should waite vpon him.
Nowe seeing he, whosoeuer tooke that which Iohn refused, by Gregories iudgement should be Antichrist, and it is certayne, that Pope Boniface the
soone after the death of Gregory and his successors, vsurped not onely that, but more also, it is certayne by Gregoryes prophecye, that the Pope is Antichrist.
And although none within that compasse had pointed out the see of Rome, yet the fulfilling of the prophecye in the later tymes, did sufficiently declare who it should be.
And most of the auncient writers name Rome to be the see of Antichrist.
Although they could not foresee that the Bishoprike of that see should degenerate into the tyrannye of Antichrist.
M. Sander aunswereth, that Tertullian and Hierom, call Rome Babylon, because of the confusion of tongues of diersenations, that hau~ted thether in tyme of the Emperours.
And the Rome was full of Id any, and did perseute the Sainctes and namely more tn Bishops of Rome.
The reason of tongnes is very absurd, and not giuen by any of those writers.
As for Idolatrie and persecuting of Sainctes, although it might be sayd in tyme of Irenaeus, and Tertullian, yet could it not be sayd in the dayes of Hierom, Augustine, Ambrose, Primasius, and a number that liued in time of the Christian Emperours.
And whereas Hierom ad Algasiam, expoundeth the name of blasphemye written in the foreheade of the purple harlet to be Rome euerlasting, it agreeth very well vnto the see of the Popedom, which they boast to be eternall, although the Empire of Rome shall be cleane taken away.
For M. Sander him selfe liketh well the title giuen by Martianus and Valentinianus to Leo, whome they call Bishop of the euerlasting citie of Rome. cap.
But whereas Rome is the citie builded vpon seuen hills, spoken of in the Apocalypse cap
M. Sander cou~teth it a childihe argument, to proue the see of Antichrist to be there, for that the citie is nowe gone from the hills, and standeth in the playne of Campus Martius, and the Pope sitteth on the other side of the riuer, vpon the hill Vatican harde by Saint Peters Churche, by whome he holdeth his chayre, not at all deriuing his power from the seuen hills, &c.
But if the Pope sitte now in an other Rome, then Peter the Apostle satte, howe will Maister Sander perswade vs, that he fitteth in the chayre of Peter.
For that Rome where Peter satte, was buylded vpon seuen Hilles, and not gone downe into the plaine of Campus Martins, nor ouer the Riuer.
Beside this it is plaine, that although the people haue remoued their habitations from the hilles, yet the Pope hath not, for on them be still to this day his Churches, Monasteryes, courtes.
For on the Mounte Caelius be the monastery of Sainte Gregory, the church of Iohn and Paule, the Hospitall of our Sauiour, the rounde Church, the great Minster of Laterane, in which are sayde, to be the heades of the Aposiles Peter and Paule, and the goodlyest buildings in the worlde, where the Byshops of Rome dwelled vntill the time of Nicolas the seconde, which was almost eleuen hundreth yeeres after Christe.
The Mount Auentinus, hath three Monastetyes, of Sabina Bonifacius, and Alexius.
The Mount Exquilinus, hath the Church of Saincte Peter himselfe surnamed Ad vincula.
The Mounte Viminalis hath the Church of S. Laurence in Palisperna, and S. Potentiana.
The Mount Tarpeius or Capitoline, hath an house of Fryers Minors called Ara Coeli.
And there did Boniface the ninth builde a fayre house of Bricke for keeping of Courtes.
The Mount Palatinus, is a place called the great Pallace, and hath an olde Church of S. Nicolas and of S. Andrewe.
The Mounte Quirinalis is not altogither voide of habitation, to which appertaineth the Churche of S. Maria de populo.
hils is stil the see of Antichrist, described by S. Iohn at such time as those hills were most of alinhabited garnished with sumptuous buildings.
hilles be the fulnes of pride in secular princes, to whome the Protestantes commit the supreme gouernment of the church.
will not speake of this contumely that hee bloweth out against christian Princes, neither wil I' sta~d to proue that
hills in that place are taken literally, which is an easy matter because
heads of ye beast, but how wil M. or all the Papists in the world deny the citie of Rome to be that Babylon and see of Antichrist, When the Angel in the last verse of the chapter sayth, And the woman which thou sawest is that great citie which hath dominio~ ouer the Kings of the earth: which if any man say was any other Citie then Rome, all learning and learned men wil cry out against him.
The see beeing found, it is easy to finde the person by S. Paules description, and this note especially that excludeth the heathen tyrants, he shal sit in the temple of God, which when when we see to be fulfilled in the Pope, although none of the eldest fathers could see it, because it was performed after their death, we nothing doubt to say affirme stil, that the Pope is that man of sinne Sonne of perdttion, the aduersary that lifteth vp himselfe aboue all that is called God, and shalbe destroyed by the spirit of the Lords mouth, by the glory of his co~ming.
NOT the Pope of Rome, but the Protestants them selues are the members of Antichriste, by forsaking the Catholike Church, by setting vppe a newe Church and by teaching salse doctrine against the Gospell of Iesus Christe.
Heretikes beeing once departed out of the Church, haue newe names.
VVhy among the Catholikes some are called Franciscanes, Dominicanes, &c. Heretikes can neuer agree The short raigne of Heretikes.
Heretikes do preferre the temporall raigne or swoorde before the spirituall.
They are the members of Antichrist, who withstande the externall and publke sacrifice of Christes Church.
Heretikes depriue Christe of his glorious inheritaunce in many nations togither.
The intollerable pride of Heretikes, in making them selues onely Iudges of the righte sence of Gods word.
The Protestants teach the same doctrine which the olde Heretikes did.
The Protestants are the right members of Antichriste, in that they spole Godes Church of very many giftes graces articles of the faith.
aunswere, the Protestantes haue not departd from the Church of Christ, but are gone out the Church of Antechrist, according as they are communded by the holy Ghost poc.
are returned to th hch of Christ, which by the Pope the duill was driuen into the wildernes, Apoc.
But Sand would haue the place named, where they dwelt, from whom the Pope departed, as though the place were mateiall, when his depature from the doctrine of Christ, is manifest.
And Saint Paule prophesed of the greate Apostasie and departing from Christ, which Antechrist shoulde make.
hess to him selfe his owne doctrine, as Irenaeus doeth expound it. b.
therefore it were no maruaile, if no place could be named, altogeather voide of the insection of Antchrist, especially seeing the Church her selfe was driuen into the desert, that is out of the sight of men.
yet there is no donbt, but God preserued his Church, though in small numbers, both in the East in the West.
And namely one parte of the Church of God was in Britaine, both in Wales and Scotland, not subiect to the Pope, nor acknowledging his auctority, at such time, as Augustine the monke came from Pope Gregory, so connued longe after the reuelation of Antechrist.
And no doubt but the like was in many corners of the world.
marke of an Antechristian he maketh, to haue newe names after they be gone out of the Church, as, Lutherans, Zwinglians, &c. whereas they haue none but Catholikes, yes verely, the name of the Popish Church Papistes, is as auncient as the name of Luther Lutheans, more aunciente to.
M. Sand. sayth we geue them these names of spight, eyght or nyne hundreth yeres since the papacy Began.
The lyke say of them, who call vs Lutherans &c. of mere malice, when we are nothing but Christians, wherefore the tryall must be in the doctrine, which either sorte professe, and not in names.
The Christians of the Arians were called Homousians, Athanasians. &c. but the doctrine of the Cathotholike Christians ageeing with the woordes of God proued them to be no sctaryes nor Hetetikes, so doth our doctrine iustifie vs what names soeuer be deuised against vs.
But Master Sander woulde haue vs to shewe a man, whose poper name was Papa or Romanus as though many Heretikes were not called of their hearisie or place from whence they came, and not of proper names of men.
Angelici, Apostolici, Barbarita, Cathari, Collyridiani, Enratitae, Patripassiani and a great number more were called of their heresie, Cataphryges, Pepuziani and such like were called of the place where they were.
Wherefore the name of Papistes and Romanistes agreeth ith the example of olde heretikes.
As for the longe tarying, large spreadinge, and straunge commng in of the Popishe heresie is therefore without example, in all poyntes lyke, because Antchrist is not a common pettit heretike, but the greatest and most daungerous enemy that euer the Gospel had.
The names of Benedictines, Fraunciscanes &c. Maister Sander woulde excuse, because these sectes maintaine no doctrin, dissenting fro~ the Pope, but all seeke the perfectiou of the Gospell by diuerse wayes, as though there were any other way but Iesus Christ.
condemneth the holding of Peter, of Paule, of Apollo, when the Doctrine was all one, and counteth them schismatikes, that so did.
And the purer Pimatiue church, condemned such apish immitators of the Apostles in forsaking all things and possessing nothing, in abstayning from Marriage &c. for Heretikes, and called them Apostolicos, witnesse Epiphan.
The thirde Marke of an Antichristian, is, dissagreement among Heretikes: and heere not content to charge vs with the dissagreeing of Anabaptistes from vs, he amplysieth the dissention betweene Luther and Zwinglius, about the presence of Christes body in the sacrament, for which contradiction, he thinketh it muste needes followe that one of them is an Antichriste.
aunswere euery errour stifely mayntayned, maketh not an Heretike, except it be in an article of fayth necessary to saluation.
Cyprian againste the Byshopps of Rome Stephanus and Cornelius, helde an errour in Baptisme, as greate as that same of Luther, dissenting from Zwinglius in the Supper of the Lorde, yet is not Cypryan accoumpted for an Heretike.
Maister Sander replyeth and sayeth, that Cyprian was not so stubborne, that he woulde excommunicate them that held the contrary.
Luther also and Zwinglius, althoughe they coulde not bee reconcyled in opinions, yet agreed to abstaine from contention, at Marpurge Anno domini.
Maister Sander sayth, further, that in the contention of Cyprian, and Stephanus, the Catholike Faythe was not fully and vniuersally receiued in any generall Councell.
But hee forgeteth that the Byshoppe of Rome was one partie, whose iudgement should haue ended the striefe if his authoritie had beene such then, as he vsurped moste ambiciously afterward.
Nowe where as he defendeth the Papists for their vnitie, which he sayeth, could not bee with out the spirite of God, aunsweare he might as well defend the Doctrine of the Mahometistes, where is greater vnitie then euer there was amonge the Papistes: who to omit an hundreth small contentions of the schoolemen, are not yet agreed, of the greatest question of all, whether the Pope be aboue the councell or the councell aboue the Pope.
For seeing some of the Papistes, make the Popes determination to be the rule of truth, other make the councell, there is no vnitie among the Papistes in truth, when they are not agreed what is the onely rule of trueth: whereas we all agree, that the word of God is the only rule of truth, wherby we would haue all doctrine tried and examined.
The fourth marke of an Antichrist, is, to reigne but a short tyme, and here he woulde haue vs to marke howe Luthers kingdome is come to an ende, whose doctrine Melancthon hath chaunged although Illyricus woulde defend it.
What depe roote ye doctrine of God deliuered by Luther, hath taken, it is so well knowne, that it can not be dissembled.
Neither hath Melancthon departed from him, except it were in his opinion of the reall presence.
Wherefore this is a great impudency, to triu~phe ouer the decay of Luthets doctrine, which dayly encreaseth, to the ouerthrow of the Popish kingdom.
The fall of Hosiander an heretike, no man either marueleth or pitieth.
The doctrine of Zwinglius and Oecolampadius of the Sacrament is the same that Caluine teacheth, as euery wise man doth know, and their learned workes shall liue and be in honor, when the Popes decretalls and his Masse bookes &c. shall stoppe mustard pottes, and be put to viler vses.
Neither is Caluines doctrine failed, by our othe of supremacie, for Caluine in the right sence of it, taught the same supremacie of Christian Princes which we sweare to acknowledge, in our soueraigne.
Neither doth Beza teache any otherwise of the descending of Christ into hell, then Caluine did, nor otherwise expounded the place of the Psalme, cited in Actes the
then Caluine doth, as all men that wil read them both may see, notwithstanding the shamelesse cauill of M. Sander.
The long continuaunce of the Popish kingdome, is a small cause to bragge of, when it being sound enemie to the kingdome of Christ, is nowe entered so farre into destruction, out of which it shall neuer escape, although Maister Sander sayth it doth florish, when it is banished out of so many regions and dayly decreaseth in euerie place, Gods holy name be praised therefore.
The fift marke of Antichrist (he sayeth) is to preach without commission, as Luther did, who was sent of none.
aunswere in the state of the church, so miserablie deceaued, as it was in his time, God sendeth extraordinarily, immediatly from him selfe, as Helias Helizaeus the Prophetes were sent to the Iewes Israelites, which were not of the Priests ordinary teachers, so Christ sent his Apostles and Euangelists.
And so was Luther and such as he sent to repaire the ruines of the churche.
And yet the Papistes haue small aduauntage against the calling of Luther, seeing he was a Doctor, authorised to preache in that church, where he first beganne, which after he had reformed the abuses therof, and restored true doctrine in many poyntes banished, by the false doctrine of Antichrist.
The same reformed church hath euer since sent forth ordinarie pastors and teachers and shall doe to the end of the world.
The sixt marke of an Antichrist is, that heretikes preferre the temporall sword before the spirituall.
And therefore Antichrist shall by force of armes compell men to a new faith, for he shall come as S. Paule sayeth in virtute, that is to say in power or strength.
impudent falsifier of the holy Scripture, doth not Sainct Paule say that his comming shalbe according to the efficacy of Satan in all power signes and lying wonders, in al deceitfulnes of vnrighteousnes,
by which is shewed seduction by false doctrine, but he shall mainteine his kingdom by cruelty, as it is manifest in the Reuelation cap.
But M. Sander hath a great quarel against the B. of Winchester for saying in his booke against Feckenham, that the ciuil Magistrate, may visit, correct, reforme and depose any Bishop in their owne realme.
Which is directly to say that the power of the King is higher and greater in Gods churche, then the power of a Bishop.
And what inconuenience is this, in thinges perteining to his office, seeing that the Bishops power in his spirituall office of preaching ministring &c. is confessed to be aboue the King? Hereby we make the body aboue the soule (saith M. Sander) the te~poral reigne aboue the kingdom of heauen.
Not a whit, no more the~ Salomon in deposing Abiather, Christia~ Emperors in deposing proude Bishops of Rome.
King shoulde depose a Bishop or pastor, for! thinke there is equall right in deposing of the greatest Bishop, the poorest Priest from his benefice.
This latter was alwaies lawful by the co~mon lawes vpon iust cause.
Now if the cause be iust, it must be either manifest or doubtfull.
If it be manifest as Abiathers was for murther, treason, adulterie, &c. the King obseruing the processe of the lawe, as in all other mens causes, may proceede against a Bishop.
If the cause be doubtfull, it is either for life or doctrine.
The triall of the Bishops life, ought to be as all other mens are, with due co~sideration of his accusers.
The triall of doctrine is not in the Kings knowledge ordinarily but in the knowledge of the eccle siasticall state, who are iudges of the doctrine by reason of their knowledge, to depose him from his ministery by reason of their calling, if he be culpable, and the King hath power to exclude him fro~ his place from his life also if his offence deserue it.
But that in spiritual matters the King should rule ye Bishops, pastors otherwise then Gods word woulde haue them ruled, none of vs did euer affirme: for that were tyranny not Christian gouernment.
And of such tyranny of Constantius the Arrian Emperour, doth Athanasius complaine: In Episi. ad sol. vit. agent.
and shew the iudgement aunsweres of the Christian Bishops, Paulinus, Lucifer, Eusebius, Dionysius, Liberius, Hosius, vnto him, when he would haue enforced them to subscribe against Athanasius, for defending the eternall diuinitie of our Sauiour Christ.
But yet the same Athanasius, appealed, him selfe, to the godly Emperor Constantinus the great, although in the end the Emperour being caried away by multitude of false witnesses, as any mortall ma~ may be, deceiued, as Dauid was about Mephibosheth, gaue wrong sente~ce against him Socr. lib.
And whe~ the same Emperor in his letters before, threatned to depose him, if he were disobedie~t, he neuer repined but acknowledged his auctority.
Si cognouero quòd aliquos eorum qui ecclesiae student prohibueris, aut ab accessu ecclesiae excluseris, mitta~ euestigio qui te meo iussu deponat ac locum tuum transferat.
If shall know (sayth the Emperour) that thou wilt prohibit any of them that fauour the church or exclude them from entring into the churche, will sende one immediatly which shall depose thee by my commaundement, remoue thy place.
Thus Athanasius iudging Constantius the hereticall Prince for an Antichristian image, in vsurping auctority in matters of faith against the truth, obeieth Constantinus a defender of the truth, seeketh aide of his auctority in ecclesiasticall causes, according to the truth: M. Sander fearing we would obiect against him that Constantinus, Martianus, other godly Emperors, vsed to sit in generall cou~cels with the Bishops, replieth, that it was only to kepe peace, wheras they did not only kepe peace, but also prescribe commau~d the Bishops, to proceede according to Gods word as Constantine did in the Nicene councell.
The bookes of the Gospells of the Apostles the oracles of the auncient Prophetes do plainly instruct vs in the vnderstanding of God.
Therfore setting all hateful discord aside, let vs take out of the sayinges of Gods spirite, the explication of the questions.
They did also publish the decrees of the councell by their auctoritie, like as they called the councells together to make their decrees.
that euen an heretical Emperour comming to yeares of discretion, will be able to consider, what maner a Bishop he is, who layeth the Priestly right vnder the lay mens feete.
By which (saith M. Sander) you may see what maner a Bishop M. Horne and his fellowes be, wc geue the most proude intollerable title of supreame head gouernor, to lay Princes.
answere in geuing this title, they meane to take nothing from the right of the clergie, co~fesse with Augustine, that there is no greater then a Priest in his office, although Moses after the distinction was no Priest, but a ciuil Magistrate in his calling aboue Aaron, that was high Priest.
And although M. Sander say, this is the diuinity of England only, to acknowledge the Prince to be chiefe gouernor, he sayeth most vntruly, for all learned men of all countries, doe acknowledge the same, in such sorte as we do in England, and not as he in Flanders, either dreameth or slaundereth vs to do.
For we confesse with Valentinian the good Emperour, that the Prince must submit his head to his godly pastor, in matters perteyning to his spirituall power Theodor. lib.
And yet we allowe the same Valentinian writing to the Bishoppes of Asia and Phrigia Theodor. lib.
They which studie by their prayers to driue awaye all hurtfull deuells, knowe to submit them selues to publike offices, according to the lawes, they speake not against the Emperors power, but they keepe the commaundementes of a sincere and great Emperour, and the commaundementes of God, and are subiect to our lawes, but you are found disobedient.
Finally we neuer ment, to geue the Prince by flatterie~, auctoritie in suche matters as belong to Bishops alone, neither would we haue a confusion, of the office of an Emperour and a Bishop, wherefore neither the saying of Leontius to Constantius, nor of Eulogius to Valens which were both heretikes would enforce men to receaue the heresie of Arrius, doth any thing at all touch vs, who limit the supremacie of Princes, within the compase of Gods worde, and Christian religion, against which, neither Prince nor Priest hath any auctoritie to commaund.
The seuenth marke of Antichrist is, the withstanding of the externall and publike sacrifice of the church, by which he meaneth the sacrifice of the Masse.
Nay rather it is a setting vp of a new altare sacrifice propitiatorie, against the only propitiatory sacrifice of Christes death once offred, by which one oblation he hath made perfect for euer, them that are sanctified Heb.
The auctor of this sacrifice, which is the Pope, he is in deede Antichrist the sonne of perdition.
But Maister Sander for proofe of the sacrifice of the Masse, alleageth the prophecie of Malachie cap.
fonde comparisons of the defectes of the Iewes, and the perfection of the Gentiles, which he affirmeth to be the vniforme interpretation of the auncient fathers, of whom no one denyeth the body and blood of Christ to be here ment, albeit some of them expoundeth this prophecy of prayers and inwarde righteousnes which are alwayes ioyned with the vnbloody sacrifice.
aunswer no one of the auncient fathers, vnderstandeth this prophecy of the sacrifice of Christes body and blood, otherwise then of a sacrifice of prayse and thankes giuing, for proofe whereof, must referre the reader to myne aunswer to M. Heskins lib.
where he shall finde the places of the Doctors set downe, which are by M. Sander in place onely quoted.
But one other straunge reason of M. Sander to proue the sacrament of the Lords supper to be a sacrifice propitiatory, may not omit because remember not that haue reade it before.
Euery publike and externall facte which is made by Gods authoritie to put vs in minde of that grea sacrifice, once fulfilled on the crosse, mse also be partaker of the nature of that Sacrifice whereof it is a remembraunce.
As if the killing of a Calfe, which signifyed the death of Christe, was an externall sacrifice, how infinitely more shall the body and blood of Christ beeing made of bread and wine, to signifie his owne death be a publike and external sacrifice.
But how beastly an absurditie his principle is you shall easily perceiue, if you consider, that Baptisme is a publike and externall fact made by Gods authoritie, to put vs in minde of the death and bloodshedding of Christ, yet no man was euer so mad, to say baptisme is a sacrifice.
Againe the Calfe that was killed was by Gods appointment a sacrifice of the only singular sacrifice of Christes death, not by vertue of the signification, for the Iewes had other ceremonies then sacrifices, which did signifie the death of Christ: But the Lords supper is not by Gods appointment a sacrifice, therefore the signification cannot make it so.
mark of the false prophets of Antichrist, is to spoyle Christ of his inheritance, which God gaue him in all nations, as the Protestants doe, VVhich for
hu~dreth yeres, can not shew any nation, town or village, church or chappel in the wide worlde, where they had publike prayer.
answere, seeing the spirit speaketh expressely, of a generall Apostacy, and of the flying of the Church into the desert, it is no more derogation to the inheritaunce of Christ, that his Church among many nations was in persecution vnder Antichrist for
hu~dreth yeeres, then that the same was in persecutio~ vnder the heathen Emperors, for
For the nations were then the inheritance of Christ, in as glorious wise as when the Church flourished in outward peace vnder the Christia~ Emperours.
Yet was there townes countryes, not only in Fraunce, Italie, and Germany, but also in the east parte of the worlde, great nations, among wc Christ had a visible Church, which were neuer subiecte to the church of Rome.
If M. S. reply that they held some errors which we deny, as prayer for the dead &c.
answere, holding the onely foundation Iesus Christe, they might be true Christians, although they were infected with some such errors as these.
Mark of Antichrist is, intollerable pride, to make him selfe iudge of the sence of Gods word, and of the text also.
allowe this marke, it agreeth to none that euer was so aptly, as to the Pope, whom the Papistes affirme, that he ca~ not erre in the sence of the Scripture, who affirme that he hath auctoritie to receaue reiect what bookes of Scripture he wil.
But M. Sa~der saith this note agreeth to vs, and that we make our selues iudges of the sense of Gods word, and of the text.
But we vtterly deny that: for we make the spirit of God in his worde, iudge of the interpretation.
No sayth M. Sander, bringeth an exa~ple of these word's of S. Paul.
He that ioyneth his virgin in mariage doth well, and he that ioyneth her not doth better.
Here vpon (saith he) we grounde this doctrine, Virginitie is a better state and more acceptable to God, then the state of mariage.
This we graunt in some respect, as the Apostle speaketh, but not simpyl.
The question is of these words, he doth better what is ment thereby: M. Sander chargeth vs to say, that S. Paule meaneth he doth better in the sight of the worlde, which is an impudentlye, and therefore al his foolish dialogisme, is a fighting with his owne shadow.
Beza expou~deth he doth better that is more commodiously, not in respect of the worlde, but in respect of godlines, for the reasons before alleaged by S. Paul, S. Paul him selfe is auctor of this interpretatio~ verse
This say for your commodity, when he exhorteth to virginity.
And that his purpose was not absolutely and simply, to preferr virginity aboue mariage, as a thing of it selfe more acceptable to God, it is plaine by these words.
First he saith, of virgines, haue no commaundement of the Lorde.
But he hath a commaundement, to preferre those things that are most acceptable to the Lord.
Secondly he sayth: suppose this to be good for the present necessity, by which words he doth emply, that it is not alwaies absolutly better, but at somtimes in some respectes, for them that haue the gift of continence, and for none other.
So we holde virginity to be better then mariage, according to the meaning of the best auncient writers, whereof some were too great extollers of virginitie, yet not like the Papistes.
But M. Sander sayeth the Protestantes make them selues Iudges, not only of the meaning of Gods worde, but also of the bookes them selues.
For they reiect not only the book of wisdom, Tobie the Machabees, with other such bookes, but also the Epistle of S. Iames.
Nay rather the Pope is Antichrist, for receauing these books of Wisedom, Tobie, Machabees, wc were neuer receaued of the church of the Israelits, nor of the vniuersalchurch of Christ for Canonicall Scripture, as haue often shewed.
And as touching ye Epistle of S. Iames, it is a shamelesse slaunder of him to say, that the Protestantes reiect it, but we must heare his reason.
So Luther called the Pope supreame heade of the church, and the Masse a sacrifice propitiatorie, if Protestantes be charged to holde whatsoeuer Luther sometime helde, and after repented.
But the confession of Zurich with the consent of the churches of Heluetia and Sabaudia, writeth thus, of it.
That Iames sayed, that workes doe iustifie, not speaking agaynst Sainct Paule, otherwise he were to be reiected.
Here saith M. Sa~der, they thinke it possible, that S. Iames might be contrarie to Sainct Paule, and so his Epistle to be no holy Scripture.
If my selfe or an Angell from heauen, should preach any other Gospel then you haue already receaued, let him be accursed.
Ergo S. Paul thought it was possible, yt him selfe or an Angell shoulde be auctor of a new Gospel, so his preaching should not be ye Gospel.
But S. Iames his epistle (he sayth) hath alwayes bene clearely admitted among true Catholikes, for witnes hereof he quoteth most impudenly Euseb. lib.
in which booke and chapter, Eusebius clearely affirmeth that it is a counterfet epistle.
say not this to allowe the iudgment of Eusebius, but to shewe the impudencie of M. Sander.
But he saith we reiect S. Iames because he is contrary to our deuilesh doctrin of only faith.
We teach only faith none otherwise, the~ the apostle teacheth, that a man is iustified by faith, without workes.
We teach not that a man is iustified by a dead faith, which is voide of good workes, but by a liuing faith which worketh by loue.
We say with Sainct Iames, if a man say he haue faith and hath not workes, his faith shall not saue him.
For Abraha~s faith, which was imputed to him for righteousnes by God, was not without good workes, as appeared by his obedience in offering his sonne, wherein God tried him, neither to know him, nor to iustifie him, whom he knew and iustified before, but to shewe his obedience to iustifie him before men.
So it is true that S. Iames sayeth a man is iustified of workes and not of faith onely.
For a solitarie srutles faith doth not iustifie before God, but a faith which is fruteful in good workes is the onely instrument to apprehend iustification, and the workes as Augustine sayth follow and shewe a iustified man they goe not before to iustifie.
Thus our doctrine agreeth verie well with the Epistle of S. Iames Sainct Paules doctrine, wherefore we haue no neede to reiect the Epistle of Sainct Iames, as contrarie to our doctrine.
But the Protestantes do not onely make them selues iudges of the whole bookes, but also ouer the very letter (saith he) of Christs Gospell finding fault with the construction of the Euangelists, and bring the text it selfe in doubt.
Example hereof he bringeth Beza in his annotations vpon Luk
of the words: This cup is the new Testame~t in my blood which is shed for you.
In which text, because the word blood in the Greke, is the datiue case, the other worde that followeth is the nominatiue case, Beza supposeth that S. Luke vseth a figure called Soloecophanes, which is appearaunce of incongruity, or else that the last worde which is shed for you, might, by error of writers, being first set in the marge~t out of Mathew Marke, be remoued into the text.
Hereupon M. Sander out of all order measure, raileth vpon Beza vpon al Protestantes.
But pray you good Sir, shall the only opinion of Beza, that but a doubtful opinio~, in dite all the Protestants in the world of such high treason against the worde of God? For what gaineth Beza by this interpretation? Forsooth the Greeke text is contrary to his Sacramentary heresie.
For thus he should translate it: This cuppe is the newe Testament in my blood which cuppe is shed for you.
Not the cup of gold or siluer (saith he) but the liquor in that cuppe, which is not wine because wine was not shed for vs, but the bloode of Christ.
This blood in the cup which is shed for you is the newe Testament in my blood.
What sence in the world ca~ these words haue? By which it is manifest, that the words which is shed for you ca~ not be referred to the cup, but to his his blood.
For the cup was the newe Testame~t in his blood, which was shed for vs, which sense no man can deny, but he that will deny the manifest word of God.
Neither doth the vulgare Latine translation geue any other sense, although M. Sander is not ashamed to say it doth.
Hic est calix nouum Testame~tum in sanguine meo qui pro vobis fundetur.
What grammarian in construing, would referre qui to calix and not rather to sanguine.
Hoc poculum nouum Testamentum per sanguinem meum qui pro vobis ffunditr.
Now touching the coniecture of Beza, that those words by errour of the scriuener, might be remoued from the margent into the text, is a thing that somtime hath happened as most learned men agree, in the
of Mathew where the name of Ieremy is placed in ye text, for that wc is in Zachary, yet neither of the Prophets was named by the Euangelist, as in most ancient recordes it is testified.
The like hath bene in the first of Marke, where the name of Esay is sette in some Greeke copies, and followed in your vulgare translation, for that which is cited out of Malachie which name was not set downe by the Euangelist, but added by some vnskilfull writer, is reproued by other Greke copies.
But this place you say is not otherwise found in any old copy, as Beza confesseth: then remaineth ye second opinion, yt S. Luke in this place, vseth Soloe cophanes wc is an appearance of inco~guity, and yet no incongruitie.
Wherein can not maruayle more at your malice (M. Sander) then at your ignorance, which put no difference betwene soloecismus soloecophanes, but euen as spitefully as vnlearnedly, you affirme that Beza should teach, that S. Luke wrote false Greeke, whereas Soloecophanes is a figure vsed of the most eloquent writers that euer tooke penne in hande, euen Cicero, Demosthenes, Greeke and Latine, prophane and diuine, and euen of S. Luke him selfe in other places, whereof for examples, referre you to Budaeus vpon the word Soloecophanes.
The apparance of incongruitie is, that it seemeth, that [undefined span alphabet], which is the nominatiue case, shold agre with [undefined span alphabet], which is the datiue case, wheras in deed [undefined span alphabet] is vsed as a relatiue for [undefined span alphabet], as it is often, and the verbe [undefined span alphabet] which wanteth, is vnderstoode, as it is commonly in the Greeke tongue, and so the translation must be hoc poculum nouum Testamentum est in sanguine meo, qui pro vobis effunditur, or effusus est.
So that this is nothinge els, but an impudent and vnskillfull quarelling, against Beza, wheras you Papists defend against the manifest institution of the cuppe, the practise of the primitiue Church, the communion in one kind of bread onely Con. Const.
The tenth marke of an Antichristian is to agree with the members of Antichrist, which are heretikes.
To agree with them in heresie is a poynt of Antichristianisme, confesse, but not to agree with them in any thing.
But let vs see in what points of heresie he chargeth vs to agree with the olde heretikes.
First Eunomius sayde, that no sinne should hurt him, if he were partaker of the faith which he taught, so the Protestants saye of their faith.
Yea sir, but their faith is not Eunomius faith, yet they say not that no sinne shall hurt them, but no sinne shall condemne them: so say you Papistes of your popish faith.
Secondly Acesius the Nouatian Bishop affirmed, that mortall sinnes committed after baptisme, might not be forgiue~ of the Priest, but of God alone.
The Protestants deny the Priest to haue any right to forgiue sinnes.
This is a lowd lye false sclaunder, for we hold that the minister of God, hath authoritie to forgiue all sinnes, that God will forgiue, according to the power giuen to them Ioan. But you Papistes agree with the heretike in this poynt, that you deny the Priest to forgiue all sinnes according to the power giuen, but haue your casus Episcopales Papales, by which you abridge the power giuen by Christ.
Thirdly, the Messalians denyed that baptisme doth plucke vp the roote of sinnes, the same is the opinio~ of the Protesta~ts.
The Protestants haue none opinion common with the Messalians, who affirmed that our owne merits satisfaction with prayers continual were necessary for plucking vp the roote of sinnes, whereas we affirme, that baptisme saueth vs according to the Scripture
by forgiuenes of our sinnes, whereby euen the roote of sinne is plucked vp, although co~cupiscense remayne after the acte of baptisme, which you Papistes also confesse to remayne to be the roote of sinne, although you graunt it not to be sinne.
But we limit not the effect of baptisme, to the time passed before ye acte of baptisme onely, as you doe, but extend it to our aeternall saluation: he that beleueth is baptised shall be saued.
Therefore you Papists both in this in your co~tinual lipplabor maintained in your Abbeyes, agree with the Messalians.
Fourthly, AErius taught, that we must not pray for the dead, nor keepe the accustomed fastings, that there is no difference betwene a Priest a Bishop.
The superstition of praying for the dead, was iustly reproued by AErius, so was the fast of custom and decree rather then of consideration, for the first that praied for the dead were heretikes, Montanists, as Tertullian his sect, the first that made prescript lawes of fasting, was Montanus the heretike also, as Eusebius witnesseth lib.
Of the third opinion was Hierom Euagrio, affirming that the distinction was made by men and not by God.
Fifthly, Iouinian iudged virginitie equall with mariage, so doe the Protestants.
haue shewed before howe it is equall, and how it is superior.
Sixtly, S. Hierom reproueth Vigilantius of heresie, for denying prayer to Sainctes, and giuing honour to reliques.
For praying to Sainctes, there is no mention in Hierom, the immoderate honoring of reliques was iustly reproued, and yet it was not then the one halfe of that it hath bene since.
Hieronym, although he rather rayle then reason against Vigilantius, as rasmus hath noted: yet he desendeth not the adoratio or worshipping, but the reuerent estimation of reliques.
Seuenthly, the Arrians would not beleue the consubstantiality of the same, because that word was not written in the Scripture.
So do the Protestants deny many thinges vpon the like pretence.
This is a meere sclaunder. for we stande vpon the sence of the Scripture, and not the wordes onely.
Eightly, Eusebius noteth it for an haynous impietie in Nouatus, that he was not consummate with crisme, which the Protestants call greasing.
In deede Cornelius Bishop of Rome reporteth that Nouatus was baptised in tyme of necessitie being very like to dye. Iacens in lecto pro necessitate perfusus sit, nec reliqua in eo qu baptismum subsequi solent solemniter adimpleta sunt: nec signaculo Chrismatis consummatus sit: vnde nec spiritum sanctum vnquam potuerit promereri.
Lying in his bed according to the necessitie he was baptised, nether were the other things that are wont to follow baptisme solemnly fullfilled, nether was he consummate with ye seale of Chrisme: wherby he could neuer obtayne the holy Ghost.
First saye this is noted as no impietie in Nouatus, but as a defect of necessitie.
Secondly that the Chrisme which Cornelius speaketh of, was ether a seale of the extraordinarye gifts of the holy Ghost, which in some remayned in the Church vntill that tyme, or els he magnifieth that ceremony intollerably: to deny the holy ghost to such as had it not, being none of the institution of Christ, and contrary to that the Papistes them selues hold at this day.
Ninethly, Lucius the Arrian persecuted holy Monkes, so doe the Protestants.
Nay they punish none but filthy, idle, Idolaters, and hypocrites.
Tenthly, the Montanists and Luciferians sayd there was a stewes made of the Church.
They sayde so falsly when the Churche was chaste. but Esaye say de truely: how is the faithfull citie become an whore, when the Church of Israell was so in deede.
Eleuenthly, the Donatists sayd the Church was lost from all the world, preserued only in Africa.
So say the Protestants that the Church was lost in all partes of the world, and raysed vp againe in Germany.
For the Churche hath bene scattered ouer the face of the earth, since the first preaching of the Apostles vnto this day.
But the Papistes saye that the Church was lost out of all the world and preserued only in a part of Europe, when of all partes in the world onely a part of Europe, which is the least part of the world, was subiect to the Church of Rome.
Tweluethly, the Seurians vsed the law and the Prophets, but they peruerted the sense of the Scriptures by a certayne peculiar interpretation of their owne.
Nay so do the Papistes, that submitte all vnderstanding of the Scripture, be it neuer so playne, to the interpretation of their Pope, and popish Church: as the commaundement of Images forbidden, and the cuppe to be receyued of all, doe most manifestly declare.
Lastly, it hath alwayes bene a tricke of Iewes and heretikes to be still in hande with translating holy Scriptures, that by chaunging they may get some appearance of Scripture on their side, as Theodotion, Aquila, Symmachus.
Hieronym was no heretike, yet did he translate the Scriptures both into Latine and into the Dalmatian tongue.
And the Papistes haue played the part of Antichristian heretikes, to confirme the vulgare Latine tra~slation, which is so manifestly corrupt and false, contrary to the truth of the Hebrue and Greeke textes vpon pretence of auoyding vncertaynty of translatio~s, wheras there is none so bad as that.
might heere runne through a great number of the olde heresies, in which the Papists consent with the ancient Heretikes.
The Offenes and Marcosianes in their reliques and straunge tounge in prayers.
The Heracleanites in annoynting them that are redy to dye.
The Marcionists in extolling virginitie fasting, in permitting women to Baptize.
The Eutychians in denyinge the truethe of Christe his bodye.
The Anthromorphites in making Images of God, and many other, but that haue doone it elsewhere, more at large.
and last marke is, that Antichristians shoulde goe about to make voyde, and deny the supernaturall graces which God hath giuen to his Church, so that the seale of Antichrist by Hippolitns iudgement should be Nego deny.
So doe the Protestants which deny fiue sacraments of the church, the sacrifice of the Masse. &c.
And so maketh rehearsall of a greatnumber of popish errors, which indeed we deny, because they be contrary to the trueth of Gods worde.
Among which he rehearseth some false and shamelesse slaunders, as, that we denye our sinnes to be taken away by the Lambe of God, saying they tary still but that they are not imputed.
In deed, if we say we haue no sinne, we deceiue our selues, and the trueth is not in vs.
But we say all the sinnes that we haue, are taken away, when they are not laid to our charge.
Secondly he chargeth vs to teach, That no iustice is at all made in vs by spreading charitie in our heartes, VVhereas S. Paule saith Rom.
many shalbe made iust: but they say onely that Iustice shall be imputed.
that beeing iustifyed by faith we haue peace with God, reioycing in hope, which doth not confound vs in the middest of afflictions, because the loue of God is powred foorth in our heartes.
meane the loue of God towarde vs, and not our loue towarde him.
Wee say likewise with Sainct Paule, that by the obedience of one which is Christe, many shalbe made righteous.
But howe can we be made righteous by obedience of Christe, but that his obedience is imputed and made perfecte vnto vs? putide and absurde slaunders.
He chargeth vs thirdly, that wee deny Baptisme, to remit our sinnes, which is false, excepte as Sainct Peter denyeth the woorke wroughte to saue vs.
not the washing of the filth of the body, but the aunsweare of a good conscience vnto Almightie God.
Fourthly, he chargeth vs to deny that Baptisme is necessary to Children, which are borne of christian Parentes wherein he lyeth moste impudently: although wee agree not with the Papistes that the Infantes of Christians excluded by necessitie from Baptisme, are damned.
In which errour although Augustine was, yet he is no more to be followed, then in an other errour, about the same infantes, to whome bothe he and Pope Innocentius thought the Sacrament of the Lordes Supper as necessarye as the Sacrament of Baptisme, affirming that Infantes whiche haue not receiued the Lordes Supper were damned.
Ecce beatae memoriae Innocentius Papa sine Baptisino Christi sine participatione corporis sanguinis Christi vitam non hobere paruulos dicit.
Beholde Pope Innocente of blessed memory sayeth, that without the Baptisme of Christe, and the participation of the body and bloode of Christe, little Children haue no lyfe.
To conclude, we deny nothing that they can proue to be true, but such matters as we proue by the onely rule of trueth to be false.
But the Pope sheweth himself to be Antichrist, which denyeth al the soueraignitie of the office and prerogatiue of Christ.
He denyeth that Christe is the onely heade of his vniuersall Church in Heauen and in earth.
He denyeth that Christ onely is a Prieste, according to the order of Melchizedech.
He denyeth that Christ onely is our Mediatour, aswell of intercession, as of redemption, He denyeth that Christs woorde is sufficient for our saluation.
He denyeth that the sacrifice of Christe his death is the onely purgation of our sinnes.
He denyeth that the merites of Christ are our onely justification.
He denyeth that God onely is to be prayed vnto.
He denyeth the veritie of Christes bodye by his transubstantiation.
Finally he denyeth all honor and glory to be dewe onely to God by Iesus Christ, and therefore he is none other, but euen that detestable monster Antichriste whome beseech the Lord, speadely to confound and abolish by the spirit of his mouth which is his holy woorde, and by the brightnesse of his comming.

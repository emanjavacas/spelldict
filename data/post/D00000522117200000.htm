mr george keith at in in london
contradicting mr geo
keith at the tolbooth of aberdeen in
in fundamental points of the christian faith

mr

the controversie between you and the quakers of late years hath made such a noise not only in america where understand it first began but also in these parts of europe that he who in this populous city hath heard nothing of it must likewise have been banished from humane society
it hath been not only the discourse of porters and carmen over a pot of ale and sparks and beau's over a glass of wine but also the grave cit over a dish of coffee hath mixt his observations upon state affairs with his reflections upon the quakers differences nay moreover the reverend clergy of the church of england not to mention the non cons have been sometimes pleased to take notice of them in the pulpit
wonder not then that an unknown person should apply himself to you after this manner for being instigated by a sort of curiosity have taken the pains to peruse many if not most of the controversial treatises published both by your self and your present antagonists though late friends the quakers and amongst the rest your advertisement of a meeting to be held at on the of june
wherein you challenged as may so say mr penn mr whitehead mr ellwood and mr penington to meet you
thither also came amongst other spectators to observe the management of the dispute but when came there found your adversaries declined meeting you and so you went on to dispute by your self those few quakers that now and then put in a word or two not pretending as apprehended to engage with you on behalf of their friends how matters would have issued if your opponents had appeared

will not undertake to determine but to your honour be it spoken who suppose may be the sole single disputant of this age you came off with flying colours haranguing your auditory into an applause of whatever you offered
where some passages dropt which upon perusal of your printed account find in part there which shall take notice of by and by

now sir before proceed to those passages shall premise this viz
that it is not my intent to interpose between you and the quakers in point of doctrine being resolved not to concern my self at present in vindicating either the one or the other but as you have began an intestine war among your selves if you cannot agree upon a treaty of peace and so come to a mutual reconciliation you must for ought can see e'en beat up one another's quarters and fight it out till one side yields up the conquest whilst in the mean time content my self with adhering to the primitive purity of doctrine held by the apestolical church of england
but perceiving you under a cloud should rejoice to see that cloud disperst and being as yet unstable to see you come to stability
remember the prophets reproof and advice kings
how long halt ye between two opinions if the lord be god follow him but if baal then follow him
which that it is so with you shall by and by prove by quotations out of the exact narrative opposed by quotations out of a former book of yours intituled immediate revelation not ceased perhaps you may object that that was published a great while ago but pray remember withal what you asserted at as it is related
of the exact narrative viz
if you prove me not to have changed in any fundamental principle ye ought not to charge me to be an apostate
know not any fundamental principle nor indeed any one principle of the christian faith that have varied from to this day ever since came among the quakers which is about years ago therefore ought to be cleared of that imputation
which assertion of yours propose as the basis of my building
but pray sir why did you conceal that part of the assertion wherein you affirmed that in fundamentals you were of the same judgment while a presbyterian as since for to that purpose you did speak am very certain and believe many that were there are able to justifie which occasioned me immediately to draw this conclusion in my own mind surely either mr keith formerly understood not the presbyterian principles

or since understood not the quakers or else they are all one and he one with them both which suppose you will not grant
but if they are contradictory as think they are then consequently he either wanted understanding how to distinguish between things which are as contrary in divers respects as black is to white a suspicion highly derogatory to that eminent character of your great learning and excellent parts for which you are generally so much applauded or he must be very forgetful and so not the person he is represented to be for a vast memory and likewise insincere in that he will stand by nothing any longer than he apprehends it suits with his interest or can easily say and unsay to gratifie a passion or humour

in short mr keith if the presbyterians and quakers be one in fundamentals why did you forsake the former and join with the latter was it because you were disappointed of an expected preferment amongst them if the two parties be not one in fundamentals were you sincere in joining with the quakers or no if sincere do you now own that your eyes were then so dim that you could not see such a as the errors you now exclaim against and that your eyes have since been opened then the less deserving the preferment you once coveted amongst the presbyterians
if not sincere then what society of people think you will trust you now to whom can you give greater security or assurances of fidelity and adherence to their cause than you seemed to give the quakers hope the reverend clergy on whom you appear now to fawn will be well assured of your being more in earnest with them than you have proved with your old friends before they trust you too much
if neither the presbyterians nor quakers are in the right how have you jugled with them both thus to keep in one while with the one another while with the other and yet all this while notwithstanding they have been both in the wrong and you at times joined to each of them still to hold your own orthodox principles during these several revolutions
but if you should say you differed not in fundamentals from one or both of these sects
then say the more unquiet man you to raise such disturbances about circumstantials

however looking further find you expressing your self thus exact narrative page

but if had known they had had such errours would as soon have put my head in the fire a very

hot expression but think you may save that pains for your head is hot enough already as have owned such among them but am of the same faith as have been above this thirty years

very well here is first gross ignorance you knew not they had such errours among them notwithstanding your professing your self one of them
secondly faith with a vengeance notwithstanding you knew not those errours yet you owned such among them which is believing as the church believes without search or examination nay let me add and printing in vindication of these principles which you pretend you knew not
and yet to make you a wonderful man in all the branches of this wonderful mystery you have kept your faith untainted notwithstanding the evil communication of these corrupt men
credat apella
now for the quotations told you of before

exact narrative
and now take notice would not misconstrue what have read by william penn's argument a man may be owned to be a christian and yet disbelieve that christ is either god or man if he own or practice a habit or quality of moral vertue as that of justice and meekness

and practice accordingly tho he believe not in christ if he have but some moral habits so that here the jew is the christian the mahometan is the christian the pagan is the christian and the professed pelagian is the christian though they deny any inward supernatural principle and call the light within only natural as many sober and moral men do

again
that faith in the man christ without us as he died for us rose again and is gone into heaven wrought in us by the spirit of christ is universally necessary to make men true christians and children of god born of the free woman who have the spirit of adoption crying abba father

immediate revelation
and the believing jews in moses time made not a church different from that in the time of the apostles and downwards all are one church and under one covenant and were saved by one faith in one lord and redeemer though the dispensations did differ in many circumstances and these who succeeded had more full and large discoveries of the mystery yet in substance they all agreed and were all one upon the matter

again
that which makes one a true christian and saint is the spirit of christ the anointing in him

again
but do most willingly grant that the preaching of christ without

us in his birth life suffering death resurrection ascention intercession is a very considerable part of the doctrine of the gospel yea more than the skin is a part of the body of the man yet it is but an integral part of a man such as the hands and feet of a man without which a man may subsist but not as an intire and compleat man and so may true religion and christianity subsist without the history of christ in the letter to wit in the mystery of the life of christ in the spirit and yet even here where the history is wanting the mystery or inside of christianity is not without its skin or outside namely an outward confession unto god both in good words and good works according unto the discovery of the mystery or inside its self

exact narrative
now you see how he makes regeneration in a believer a greater mystery than the manifestation of the son of god in his body of flesh how much more saith he is the work of regeneration a mystery for the other here tim

he does not say it is a mystery but he puts three ifs to it if a mystery pray was our blessed lord a meer shell was he like the shell of an egg without the meat of an egg or was he like the shell of any other fruit and no kernel in it was there any holiness

ever in any prophet or apostle but it is like a drop to the ocean to what was in our blessed lord therefore to compare the work of regeneration to the incarnation of our lord so as to equal it he prefers it and doth not equal it only appeal to you whether it is not an afominable errour and whether it doth not make every regenerate man not only equal to the man christ but greater for we truly value any man as more holy according as the manifestation of god is more in one than in another

immediate revelation
christ's bodily presence in the flesh was not sufficient of its self to minister though he spoke as never man spoke yet say if this ministration was not sufficient but a more glorious they were to expect and as they waited they witnessed it fulfilled and come unto them then far less is the outward administration of any other man or men whomsoever sufficient for that effect for if christ be not any more to be known after the flesh much less any other man nor is knowledge they

can receive from any other man to rested in seeing the knowledge christ after the flesh was not suffient nor to be rested in but were to look for a better a more and full manifestation in he appearing in a spiritual heavenly mysterious way in the hearts even seen a way as the wor cannot know him or receive him which made judas not iscariot wonder and question him saying is it that thou wilt manifest thy self us and not unto the world

exact narrative
we had wont to say all other professions denied christ within but here faldo owns christ to be in the gentiles rightly understood
but to me christ crucified in whom the fulness dwelleth is a greater mystery and a greater matter to be believed

immediate revelation
jesus christ revealed in man is foundation of the true church and every member thereof in particular and therefore if the true church remain this must remain also

exact narrative
but though regeneration is no slight thing yet say comparing christ's incarnation that is a complex of mysteries a certain writer shews a complex of twenty and more mysteries in that one mystery of christ's incarnation say comparing that with the work of regeneration do affirm the work of regeneration is a light thing tho not light in its self

immediate revelation
and all these glorious things both he in the days of his flesh and the prophets before that his appearance in that body of flesh declared neither only nor principally concerning his coming in the flesh namely in that vessel or temple which appeared at jerusalem but mainly and principally concerning his spiritual appearance in his saints after his being crucified risen and ascended for till then the son of man was not glorified phil

and though he was bodily present with his disciples yet he told them they were to see greater

things phil

and he said the kingdom of god was at hand

and he taught them to pray for it and he said
there be standing some among you which shall not taste of death till they see the kingdom of god come with great power and glry whereby it is manifest that these things relat mainly to his coming again in spirit when it should be poured out to those many promises concerning the same recorded in the prophets as is said before he told them it was expedient he should go away that he might again in a more glorious and comfortable appearance by the of his glorious power in their hearts for his kingdom was not of this world but an inward kingdom and he said that it was within and pointed to this spiritual appearance by his light in their hearts under many parables and figures which he calls the kingdom of god mat

exact narrative ibid
but the matter is there is a saving faith of christ without us and christ without us as he is both god and man the emmanuel as well as his inward appearance in us is the object of saving faith but those men would not own it

immediate revelation
so that this internal revelation searching and testimony is the foundation and ground of my faith commonly called the formal object of faith for which believe and assent unto the truth of any part of the scripture and consequently of the history its self if my faith be a divine and supernatural faith and not meerly humane

exact narrative
he says have already cleared george whitehead and william penn from that charge that they have not destroyed the object of faith
and say have proved that they have destroyed the object of faith if they have at other times owned it let them disown and retract their errours am not to account for their contradictions
they have contradicted themselves they have disowned the object of faith and if have charged them with it this is no contradiction in me but in them

immediate revelation
and if we are to partake of the same precious faith so also are we to partake of the same precious revelation and inspiration of the word of god by which their faith was wrought and which was its object and foundation as also it is ours and continues to be the same in all generations

exact narrative
now he says it is contrary to rom to direct people to jesus christ as he was crucified at jerusalem
but let the bible be judge
he has not cited the verse but the verses he aims shall read ver
for moses describeth the righteousness which is of the law that the man which doth those things shall live by them see ver
now in their preachments they have used to stop there and go no further
but read the verse if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved

immediate revelation
the light reveals the whole wi of god unto him and as he abides in the light and waits in it it will manifest clearly in him what he should do and what he should shun and he needs not go forth to seek a law without him or a teacher without him the word is near in his heart and in his mouth and this is the word of faith to which moses pointed the jews and paul the romans

again
and he calls them the words of the righteousn of faith and that word moses pointed the jews to in the heart he calls it the word of faith and it is clear· he understands it of christ for he addeth by way of interpretation to moses's words speaking from the same spirit say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is saith he to bring christ down from above

again a little lower in the same page and the jews and people of israel lived in moses's time and were saved it was through faith in this word this prophet raised up in them in their hearts not at a distance but nigh the word is nigh in thy heart
and this is christ in them the hope glory the mystery hid from ages and generations but was ever made manife in his saints but in the latter days more clearly christ in all that believe the hope of glory

well sir hope you will thank me for making no comments upon the foregoing and quotations referring that part to your self upon a review only querying of you whether they treat of fundamentals or no but pray excuse me if trouble you a little farther and be pleased to exercise what little patience you may by this time have left in perusing what have further to offer

observe you say of mr whitehead exact narrative
now all these proofs mat
luke
thes
he has to christ within he has allegorized away his birth his death resurrection and ascention and coming to judgment and so we have nothing from scripture to prove christ's death to be of any benefit to us and we have no arguments to prove he came in the flesh and so all the proofs against jews and philosophers has allegorized away

but sir what if mr keith have done the like what will you say then perhaps the world may be ready to say there is never a barrel the better herring of you in that respect
for if were to ask mr whitehead whether by the places you quote his intention was the explication thereof being always to be allowed to surviving authors according to your own proposal in a book have by me thereby to overthrow the faith of christ crucified perhaps he might reply no and produce some of his books in confirmation of such a denial
then on the other hand if it should be queried of mr keith whether he never allegorized for the word away we must in justice drop on both sides the birth crucifixion resurrection and miracles of christ up steps immediate revelation and answers in the affirmative and refers

as to his birth to
and thus according to his spiritual birth in the saints is the seed of woman for that the saints are the woman that bring him forth after the spirit and are his mother as mary brought him forth after the flesh and after the spirit also so that she was the mother of jesus in a double respect for as she brought him forth in her body so she brought him forth in her soul otherwise he could not have been her saviour as augustine and long after him erasmus hath well observed
now as to his death and resurrection see
and he is called the hidden man of the heart whom paul that he lived in him this he understood of christ as man for as god he liveth in all neither as god can he be crucified or die and yet he is crucified in those that are ungodly in whom as they turn from their ungodliness he cometh to live whose life as a seed is sown in every man and as every seed hath its body so hath this seed its body which as it is raised up in us the life is raised up or revealed in it through which life of the man jesus we have access unto the father and have our fellowship both with the father and the son
then for algorizing his miracles read
and we witness the power of god which wrought all these outward miracles working miraculously in our hearts opening the blind eye of the mind and deaf ear raising to life the dead soul causing the lame to leap as an hart and the tongue of the dumb to speak
and these are the greatest miracles and the outward were but a figure of them and were for the sake of unbelievers who believed not except they saw

thus far immediate revelation
now mr keith can see no other remedy but must either cry peccavi if you would have mr whitehead to do so too or else him not whilst you are tardy your self for turpe est doctori cum culpa redarguit ipsum

but as a farther confirmation hereof and to evince that you have once had as high opinion for ought can perceive and have given as high titles perhaps as whitehead or any other quaker to what they call the light within and you ewise in the aforementioned treatise sometimes call so too as well as christ

within the seed birth spirit wisdom
here present you with some of them

but reviewing your exact narrative find a passage which calculated for the meridian of a recantation enough one would think to perswade the incredulous world that you are just mounting the stool of repentance read it thus

thank god that hath given me that humble heart that if they bring any passage

out of my books that is not to be justified will own my errour and shortness

now if they would do the like it would be well
and therefore to lay it the more home upon you both would counsel both parties so far as either or both of you are concerned to take the advice given in your preface viz
but if they really disown these gross and vile errours which have proved them guilty of in this following narrative and be cordial the belief and acknowledgment of the great fundamental truths opposite to these errours then it will be that which the sincere professors of christianity in these three nations will expect from them and may justly require of them as publickly to retract and renounce these errours as they have publickly asserted them in their printed books in the face of the christian world otherwise no sincere christians will believe them to be in good earnest but that they resemble many old hereticks and particularly the crafty arrians that pretended and made great protestations that they owned the true faith according to all contained in the scriptures when they did nothing less

now sir being more prevalent than precepts do you lead the way and if they do not follow you will have acquitted your self and so far left them without excuse if in obstinacy they should refuse to write after your copy
for hope you will by this time be convinced that the above quotations are so diametrically opposite to each other that they cannot all be true and sound doctrine
but if should still remain of another mind and think them all defensible you would do well to reconcile them so as to evidence it to others which if you should forbear to endeavour must then tell you that the sincere professors of christianity may justly require of you publickly in print to retract and renounce those that by scripture and sound reason you cannot defend for mr keith we have an old proverb amongst us that which is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander
furthermore it is expected of you that you should once come to stability and no longer be like caesar at the river rubicon one while a mind to go back another while a mind to go forward one while profess your self a quaker another while almost ashamed of the name but either come wholly over to the church of england to whom you seem much inclined and who seems ready with open arms to receive you as a true penitent and thereby make amends for your so long joining with the quakers who have so fiercely opposed her whereby in probability you may obtain a settlement which may prevent the ruin of your self and family you seem so apprehensive of by leaving the quakers who perhaps in retaliation of your good service may be pleased to reward you with some ecclesiastical preferment which your great learning and abilities may entitle you to
or else e'ne turn back to your late abdicated opinions and once more embrace your forsaken friends with a brotherly love if after all the affronts you have put upon them they will yet receive you
for in short neither god nor good men love a laodicean lukewarmness but if you continue so neither hot nor cold will be ready to spew you out of their mouths
thus have adventured to you my opinion and so intend to conclude designing brevity because would take the poets advice epigraph contra verbosum noli contendere verbis

sir yours

finis

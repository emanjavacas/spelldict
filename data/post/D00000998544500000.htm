Whereof the first .ix. and part of the tenth, were conuerted into English Meeter by Thomas Phaër Esquier, and the residue supplied, and the whole worke together newly set forth, by Thomas Twyne Gentleman.
There is added moreouer to this edition, Virgils life out of Donatus, and the Argument before euery booke.
IMPRINTED AT London by Wyllyam How, for Abraham Veale, dwelling in Poules Churchyearde, at the signe of the Lambe.
To the Right honorable Sir Nicholas Bacon Knight, one of the Queenes Maiesties most honorable priuie Counsell, and Lorde keeper of the great Seale of England.
EXperiment partly, and partly Presumption, two bolde guides, haue mooued me to attempt your honour with the dedication of this booke.
Hoping that as you haue already honorably receaued the latter two bookes and a parcell of another, ioygned with the former seauen of Virgils Aeneidos translated into English meeter by Thomas Phaër, and taken them to your honorable protectio~: So likewise your honour wil not refuse the same worke agayne imprinted, set forth with such diligence as co~ueniently might be.
Which, to thintent it should not alwaies remaine vnperfect, but rather answer the purpose wherto M. Phaër had respect when he tooke it in hande, (which was to delight the nobilitie of this Realme, and others that should vouchsafe to reade it) and also that so noble a Poet should not sustaine so foule a mayme in the English tongue, as alwaies to lye vnfynished: haue enterprised more ventrously then wisely, with better cou+rage then cu~ning to end that which he left vnperfect.
Not that thinke my self co~parable vnto him in any thing that he tooke in hande, for so would not haue your honour, or any other to iudge of me.
But seing so many excellent wittes as since his time haue flourished, haue left it vntouched: haue bin bold at length to spend Time, hazard Estimation
The acceptation wherof, as it wilbe, hope, at some mens hands: embrace: and at others: do not reguard.
Vnto your honour, whom presume to make patron herof, with al humility, dutiful reuerence sub+mit myself, and my trauailes.
That if it shal hap the same in the accepting, to co~ceaue any good opinion therof, ether for wel doing, or wel meaning: am fully satisfied.
Wherof stand in the greater hope, since your honour being aduaunced vnto the dignitie wherin you now stand, through your owne industrie and vertu: can deem the better of such labours, and do vse more entierly to embrace with fauour, such as beare goodwil vnto learning.
And hauing alredy stoared your self sufficie~tly with such plausible furniture: yet amongst al other good gifts wherwith god hath endued you, both for your owne ornament, and for the commodity of the co~monwealth of England, persuade your self that there is no one vertu that more amplifieth your title of honour, then that curtesie, affability which you shew vnto suters, and such as haue occasion to attend your honour.
Wherin though som suppose that a disgracing of Nobilitie, and worship doth consist: yet then they shall know it to be contrarie, when they shall begin to know themselues, and to vnderstand that such meanes do make men not only noble aboue the Co~monaltie: but excellent also aboue the Nobilitie.
Almightie God perserue your honour with wisshed encrease, prolong your daies with happie delight.
Virgils life, set foorth, as it is supposed, by Aelius Donatus, and done into English.
VIRGIL sirnamed Maro, was borne but of meane parentage, especially on the fatherside, who was called Maro, whom some suppose to haue bin a potter, but moe thinke that he was at the first, couenaunt seruant wt a traueilinge wyseman, and afterward for his towardnes, by mariadge of his daughter: became his soonne in lawe, whom when his father in lawe had put in trust with his husbandrie, and his catteyle, and byinge of wooddes, and lookinge to Bées, therby he increased his smale substance.
He was borne the yéere yt Cn. Pompeius, and M. Licinius Crassus were first Consuls the
day of Octobre, in a village called Andes, not far from Mantua.
His mother Maia, beinge great with childe with him, and dreaminge that she was deliuered of a laurell bowe, which prickt into the grownde grew forthwith to a great trée, replenyshed with sundrie kindes of Frutes, and Flowers: the next morning walking forth into the countrey with her husband, stept a side, and was deliuered therby, in a ditche.
The report goeth, that the childe so soone as he was borne neuer cried, but looked so pleasantly, that he gaue an assured hope that by his birth some notable thinge should chaunce.
There befell also another strange token, for a Poplar trée branch, which was prickt into the grownd accordinge as the manner of the countrey at womens traueiles is, so grewe vp in short space, that it matched in bignes many great Poplar trées, that were set there long before, whiche was afterwarde consecrated, and called by the name of Virgils trée, and had in great reuerence amongst téemynge women, and such as were with child, which daily made prayers, and offringes there.
His infancie, that is to say, vntill he was seauen yeare old, he passed in Cremona, and when he was thirtéene yéere of age he receaued the garment of manstate, when those were made Consuls agayne
that were when he was borne, and it fortuned that Lucretius the poet departed the same day.
But Virgil, from Cremona went to Millain, and shortly after from thence to Naples, where dilige~tly applying the studie of the Greeke, and Latine toonges: at length betooke himself to Physicke, and knowledge of the Mathematicals, wherin he surpassed all other in skill, and departinge to Rome, fell in fauour with the M. of the horse to Augustus, and cured the horses of manie, and sundrie diseases.
Who commau~ded therfore that Virgill shuld haue such allowance of bread, as other of the stable had.
Duringe this tyme the Crotoniati sent vnto Caesar for a present, a goodlye horsecolt, that in all mens iudgment would proue both verie couragious, and woonderfull swift.
When Virgil beheld him he told the M. of the stable, that he was fooled of a sicke, and infected mare, and that he would proue nether stronge nor swift, as afterward it appeared, wherof when the M. of the stable had enformed the Emperour: he co~maunded that his bread shuld be dubled, for reward.
Lykewyse, when there were certen Dogges sent to Augustus foorth of Spayne, Virgil both told what maner ones the siers were, what stomack and swiftnes they would be of.
Which when he vnderstoode· he then commau~ded agayne that Virgil should haue so much more bread as he had before.
The Emperour Augustus doubtinge of himself whether he were sunne to Octauius or to some man else, and supposinge that Virgil Maro could resolue him, that knew so well the natu+res and siers of horses, and dogges: remoouing all companye aside Augustus called him into the priuie chambre, and asked him there alone, if he knew what he was, and what abilitie he had to make men happie? knowe ({quod} Maro that thou art Augustus Caesar, and thou hast almost equall power with the immortall goddes and that thou mayst make happie whom thou liste.
Surely ({quod} Caesar am of this mind, that if yu answer mée truly to that shall aske, will make thée happie, and blessed.
wold to god ({quod} Maro that could answere truly to that yu demaundest.
Then sayd the Emperour, some say am sunne to Octauius, and some suspect that am some other mans sunne.
Wherat Maro smylinge: will sone tell you that ({quod} he) yf you pardon me in answeringe that you commau~d.
The Emperour swore by an Oth that he wold take neuer a worde in ill part, yea and that he shuld not depart vnrewarded.
Therwithall Maro fixinge his eyes fast on the Emperours: it is an easie matter ({quod} he) by other lyuinge
thinges to discerne the disposition of the parentes, through skill of Mathematickes, and Philosophie, but in men it is not possible.
Howbeit am able to giue some probable iudgment, what trade of lyfe thy father exercised.
To this Augustus gaue dilige~t eare what he wold say.
Then Virgil, so far as can perceaue ({quod} he) thou art a Bakers sun.
The Emperour thereat was astunned, and marueiled much in his mind how that could come to passe.
Marie then ({quod} Virgil will tell you why iudge so.
When as foretold certen thinges which could nether be knowne, nor vnderstoode but by such as be very wel lerned: thou that art prince of all the wordle commaundidst that shuld haue a certen of bread giuen mée for a reward, which is the vse ether of bakers, or els of such as are bakers children.
This merie iest, pleased the Emperour wel, but henceforth ({quod} he) yu shalt not be rewarded by a baker but by a most valie~t prince, estéemed him much, and commendid him to Pollio.
He was of bodie and stature bigge, of colour tawnie, hardfauoured, sycklie, for he was manytimes gréeued with payne in the stomack, iawes, and head, and some tymes he did spet blood.
He frequented but litle the vse of deyntie meates and wyne.
Some report that he was prone to the detestable sinne with boyes.
But the better sort suppose rather that he loued them as Socrates loued Alcibiades, and Plato also.
Aboue the rest he loued most Cebetes, and Alexander, whom in the second Ecloge of his Bucolikes he termeth Alexis, giuen vnto him by Asinius Pollio.
When they came vnto him they were nether of them vnlearned.
For Alexander was a good Grammarian, and Cebetes a Poet.
Some likewyse affirme that he had carnall companie with Plotia Hieria.
But Asconius Pedianus sayth that he was woont to declare to some auntient me~, that indéede he was requested by Varius iointly to kéepe her, howbeit he ernestly refused so to doe.
In all other respectes he was of lyfe, language, and conuersation so vpright: that through all Naples he was called, commonly Virginitie.
And when haply he was séene at Rome, (whether as he came very seldom) going abroade in the open streetes if eny followed, or noted him: he wold turne away into the next house.
When Augustus offred him the goods of one that was banished, he vtterly refused them He was worth in substance an hundred Sestertia, which were giuen him through the liberalitie of his fréendes, he had an house in Rome in a place called Aesquiliae neare to Mecoenas gardaynes, although he was accustomed much to withdrawe him self into Campania and
Whatsoeuer he requested of Augustus: he neuer had deniall therof.
Euery yéere he sent monie abundantly to succour his parentes which died when he was of lawfull yéeres, his father beinge blinde when he died, his two brethren the one surnamed Silo died while he was a child, and Flacchus when he was come to ma~state, whose death he bewayleth vnder the name of Daphnis.
Amonge other studies (as haue sayd before) he chéefly applied himself to Physick and Mathematickes.
He neuer plead at barre more then one cause, and that but once, whom Melissus reporteth to haue bin very slow of toongue, as though he were altogither vnlearned, when he first began Poëtrie, he made this Disthic, or these two verses vpon one Balista a scholemaster, that for reporte of théeuery was couerid with an heape of stones.
Vnder this hugie hill of stones Balista tombd doth lie, Waifarer saufe both night and day thy iorney now maist hie.
After this he wroat Moretum, Priapus, Epigrammes, Dirae, and Culex when he was yet but fiftéene yéere old, the argument wherof is this.
shepheard wearyed with heat, and sleapinge vnder a trée, when a serpent was cumming fast towards him, there came a Gnat flying out of the Fenne nearby, and lighted on the sheapheardes forhead betwéene his temples, and there stunge him.
Then he lyftinge vp his handes crushed the gnat, and when he espied the serpent: killed him also, and made a tombe for the gnat with this superscription.
Thou litle gnat, the shepheard for thy due desert to bee, This buriall rite, for losse of lyfe, here yeldeth vnto thee.
But shortly after when he had begun Romane matters mislikynge the sharpnes, and roughnes both of the argument, and names, he fell to the Bucolickes but cheifly to celebrate the name of Asinius, Pollio, Alphenus Varus and Cornelius Gallus, by cause yt in the deuision of land beyond Padus amongst the old souldiours after the conquest at Philippe made, at the co~maundment of the Triumuiri, or the Thre conspiratours, they had saued him harmlesse.
Afterward he made his worke called Georgica in the honour of Mecoenas by whose meanes, when he was yet scarce knowne vnto him, he was assisted against the old soldiours of Claudius, or rather as some suppose, against the violence of Arius the Centurian, by whom in that hurlyburly about deuiding of landes, he was very neare slayne.
Last of all he tooke the Aeneidos in hand, a worke of a diuerse, and manifold argument, and resemblinge, in a maner
Besides that it contayneth indifferenly both wordes, and matter aswell Greeke as Latine, and that cheife is which he most endeuored, it comprehendeth both the originall of the citie of Rome, and Augustus the Emperour.
When he wroate the Georgica, it is reported, how that euerie morninge he was accustomed to write a certen numbre of verses, which he would all the day longe ouerlooke, and so abbridginge them, bringe them vnto a very fewe, not vnfitly sayinge that he brought forth verses, as the femall Bear doth her young and bringeth them into due fashion by lickinge.
The worke called Aeneidos he wrote first in twelue bookes in prose (as some thinke) and afterward digested it into verse.
And othersome iudge that if he had liued longer, he wold haue le~gthned it vnto xxiiij. bookes euen vnto the time of Augustus, and wold haue touched many other thinges therin, and with great dilige~ce haue set forth Augustus tyme, since that in writing, least he shuld be vainly troubled with eny thinge: he left some thinges imperfect.
And some thinges he wroate in very slender verse, which (as he was woont, to iest) he sayd he put in for Iesters, and Minstrels, to hold vp the worke, vntill the sownd pillers were framed.
He absolued his Bucoliks in thrée yéere, at Asinius Pollios request.
The same at that tyme ruled the prouince beyond Padus, by whose meanes and sute, when the Cremonenses, and Mantuans lands were distributed vnto Augustus auntie~t souldiours, yet notwithstandinge Virgil lost not his.
This Pollio, Virgil loued entierly, and was likewise of him very welbeloued agayne, and great+ly rewarded, for when he was vpon a tyme desiered by him to supper, and there sodenlye surprised with the singulare beutie, and diligence of Alexander, Pollios boye: receaued him of gift.
Likewise he loued dearly C. Asinius, Pollios sunne, and Cornelius Gallus a noble Oratour and a singulare Poet, who tra~slated Euphorion into Latin, and wroate in fouer bookes his loue of Cytheris.
At the first he was in good credite with the Emperour Augustus, but afterward vpon suspition of co~spiracie against him, he was slayne.
Of whom Propertius speaketh thus: Whilst Gallus in the tentes, the ensignes doth defend: Before the Egle bloodie signe, he found his fatall end.
Virgil loued this Gallus so well, that the fouerth booke of Georgikes from the middle to the end contayned his prayse, which afterward at Augustus commaundment he changed into the fable of Aristaeus.
He finished the Georgiks in seuen yéere at Naples, and the Aeneidos he made partly in Sicilia, partly in Campania, in eleuen yéere.
And his Bucoliks he made with so good successe that they were oftentimes sunge openly by Musitians in playes.
When Cicero had heard certen of the verses, and by and by through sharpe iudgment perceaued that they procéeded from no commune veyne: he willed that the whole Ecloge shuld be reade from the beginninge.
Wherto when he had attended diligently, in the end he said these words Of mighty Ro+me a second hope, as though himself were the first hope of the Latine toongue, and Maro wolde be the second, which wordes also he reciteth in the Aeneidos.
The Georgikes, when Augustus returned from the Actiacan victorie, and for recreationsake soiourned at Atella, he read there vnto him continually the space of fouer dayes, and when his voice failed him at eny time: Mecoenas supplied his romth in readiynge.
Seneca writeth that Iulius Montanus the Poet was wou~t to say, that he wold take away by force some thinge from Virgil if he could set them forth with the same voice, cou~tnance, and gesture· And that the selfsame verses if he pronounced them, wold sound well, but without him: wold be drie and dumbe.
Of the Aeneidos scarce yet begunne, there was spread such a fame: that Sextus Propertius doubted not thus to foretell.
Giueplace you Romane writers all, and Greekes giueplace likewise can not tell what greater worke then Ilias doth arise.
When Augustus by fortune was absent from the Cantabrick expedition, and partly by requestinge and partly by manacinge letters, merely required of Virgil that he shuld send to him if it were but the verie title or some one full sentence of Aeneidos, for those were his words: he refused so to doe.
To whom yet not longe after when the matter was fully perfected, he recited thre bookes, namely the Second, the Fourth and the Sixt.
And that especially, bycause of Octauia, who beinge there present at the recitall, at those verses of her sunne, Marcellus thou shalt be, is reported to haue fainted for sorowe, and when by much labour she was recouered agayne, she commaunded that Virgil shuld haue to the value of fiue pou~ds for euerie verse.
He read his bookes also to diuerse, but not oft, those places only wherof he stoode in eny doubt, therby to heare the iudgment of men Yt is sayd that Erotes his secretarie, whom he also made frée, when he was
very aged was woont to report, that once in the readinge of his worke he made two of his half verses out of hand, and that Misenus Aolides added, was better none then he.
Lykewyse vnto this verse, In kindlinge men with noyse, with like heat he adioyned, And fightinge fields to cheere with brasse, that he was commaunded strayt wayes to wryte those ij. additions so in the worke.
yeare old, to thintent to finish the Aeneidos, he was determined to withdrawe him self into Greece, and Asie, and there to employe whole thre yeares in correctinge and perusinge, that he might bestowe all the resdue of his life only in the studye of Philosophie.
But when he was in his iourney, and met with Augustus at Athens who was returninge forth of the East cuntreyes towards Rome: he purposed to goe home agayne with him.
And trauailinge to Megara, a towne nigh Athens, only to sée it, tooke there a sicknesse, which continuall trauaile on sea augmented, and encreasinge more and more vntill he came to Bru~dusium with in fewe dayes after dyed there, the xxj. day of September when Cn. Plautius, and Q. Lucretius were Consuls.
Who when he felt him self mortally assaulted with the maladie: he called often, and very ernestly for his deske, that he might burne the Aeneidos.
Which beinge deneid him, he willed notwtsta~dinge by his last testament that it shuld be burned, as a work both faultie, and vnperfect.
But Tucca and Varrus told him that Augustus wold in no wyse suffre that.
Wherruppon he bequeathed the same worke, and his other writinges vnto Varrus and Tucca vpon this condition, that they shuld set forth nothinge but that which he wold haue set forth, and such verses as were vnperfect: they shuld so leaue them.
He willed also that his bones shuld be borne to Naples, wheras he had lyued longe tyme, and merely.
His bones therfore were translated to Naples, at Augustus commaundment, as he apointed, and were buried in the way to Puteol. at the second stone, and vpon his tumbe was writen this disthick, which he made him self.
Mee Mantua bred, Calabres tooke, Parthenop now doth hold, Of pastures haue sou~ge, of fields, likewyse of captaynes bold.
He made heyers of half his goods Valerius Proculus his half brother by another father, of the fourth part, Augustus, of ye twelfth part Mecoenas, of all the remainder L. Varrus, and Plocius Tucca, who after his decease as he requested at Caesars commaundment corrected,
For no man iudged the Aeneidos worthy to be burned, wherof these verses of Sulpitius the Carthagian are extant.
These verses in to flaming fiers commaund for to be flunge Virgilius did, wherin the deeds of Troian duke he sunge.
But Tucca nilles, and Varrus eke, thou Caesar dost forbide, And Latine stories to preserue dost better meanes prouide.
Vnhappie Pergame twise in duble fier welnigh was rost, And Troy by second flame, to smoking dust was brought almost.
There remayne also many noble verses made by Augustus vppon the same matter, whose beginning is this.
And shall a wicked work so vile a deede in finall voice Commaund? and shall it into fier be throwne, is there no choice? And shall the noble Muse of lerned soundinge Maro die? And shortly after.
But faith of lawes must needes be keept, and what last will doth saye, And what it doth co~maund bee done, that needes we must obaie.
Nay, rather let the sacred force of lawes be broken quight, Then that so many trauayles great sustaind by day and night One day shuld quight consume.
Wherfore Varrus at Augustus commaundment did set forth nothinge, as Virgil willed he shuld not: but generally perused all, leauing also those verses as they were, still vnperfect.
Whiche verses diuers afterward tooke in hand to make vp, but they could not for the difficulty therof, for they be all Hemistichia, that is to say half verses, besides this: Whom Troy vntimely bare thee, which séemeth to carie with it perfect sense.
Nisius the Grammarian said that he had heard of his elders, that Varrus had changed the order of two bookes, and that which was then the Second he transposed into the third place.
And that he changed also the beginninge of the First booke, takinge these verses cleane away: that my slender Oten pipe in verse was woont to sound Of wooddes, and next to that tought for husbandme~ the grou~d How frute vnto their greedy lust they might co~straine to bringe, worke of thankes: loe now of Mars, and bloody warres singe.
Virgil also amongst other, who was one of the pillers of the Latin toongue, lacked not slaunderers.
In his Bucolickes, Paro, but very foolyshly, mocketh at two Ecloges, and thus he beginneth to flout.
If Tityrus thy gowne be warme, vnder what beachen shade? And in the next.
Whose beastes are these Damaetas, tell, is this god Latine speach? No but tis Aegons, for our clownes in cuntrey so do teach.
Another also when he read this place out of the Georgiks: Eare naked, naked sowe: he added, then cold, and feuer thou shalt take.
There is also exta~t a boke made by Carpilius Pictor vnder this title, The Aeneidos scourge.
M. Vipranus sayde that Mecoenas had set vp a finder out of an euell imitation, and that he was nether loftie in Stile, nor low, but that he made that worke with commune vulgare wordes.
Herennius only gathered togither his faultes, and Perilius Faustinus, that which he stole of others.
There are also certe~ volumes of Quintus Octauius Auitus, in the which are obserued what verses, and from whome he tooke them.
Asconius Pedanus in his booke which he writeth against the slaunderers of Virgil, setteth downe a fewe thinges which were obiected against him, and this chiefly, that he tied not wel his historie togither, and that he borowed much of Homere.
But this fault (as they say) he was woont thus to defend, saiyng why do not they likewyse attempt the lyke théeft? But they if they wayghed it vprightly shuld vnderstand that it were an easear matter to pulle the club out of Hercules hand, then to take a verse away from Homere, and that notwithstandinge he determined to withdrawe himself for a time to amend euerie thinge that his ilwillers found fault withall.
Pedianus also reporteth, that he was very curteous, and a louer of all good and honest men, and so far from Enuie, that if he sawe eny thinge done, or spoken lernedly by eny, he reioyced therat, none otherwyse then if it were his owne: that he dispraysed no man, praysed goodmen, and was of so gentle nature: that there was no man, vnlesse he were ouer stubberne and malicious, that not only fauored him, but also hartely loued him.
His library stoode as ready open to othermen as to himself, and he oftentimes vsed the sayinge of Euripides: All thinges amongst freendes are commune.
He had all the Poetes of his tyme so freendlye, and beholdinge vnto him, that although they much enuied one another, yet him they all reuerenced, as Varrus, Tucca, Horace, Gallus, Propertius, But Anser, by cause he tooke not part with Antonius, dyd not regard him.
He so much contemned glorie, that when some ascribed to them selues certen of his verses, and therfore were accoumpted the better learned, he tooke it not only not displeasantly, but he much reioysed therat.
And makinge a couple of verses contayninge the prayse and felicitie of Augustus, which were set vpon the gates with out name, the verses were these.
All night it raynes, the sights at morning tide returne againe, And Caesar with almighty Ioue hath match and equal raigne.
The authour of which verses Augustus longe made enquirie for, but he could not finde him.
At length when none came, Bathyllus an indifferent good Poet, ascribed them vnto himself, and was therefore encoraged, and rewarded by Caesar, which Virgill not takynge well, set vpon the same gates this beginning foure times: So you, not for your selues.
Augustus required that these verses should bée by some finished, which many assaying in vayne: Virgil thus replied, to the forewritten Disthic.
So you not for your selues, poore birds, your nestes do build in trees So you not for your selues, yee Sheep, do beare your tendre flees.
So you not for your selues, your hony gather, litle Bees.
So you not for your selues, your neckes, poore beastes, with harrowes squees.
Which beyng once knowne: Bathyllus for a time was all the iest ingstocke to the whole citie of ROME.
When on a time he had the workes of Ennius in his hande, and beyng demaunded by one what he did with the~: answered yt he gathered golde out of Ennius dounge.
For that authour expresseth worthy sentences matter, vnder words not of the finest.
Vnto Augustus that demaunded of him how a Citie might best be gouerned: he answered, if the wisest men did holde the helme, and good men were set in aucthoritie ouer euell, and so that the best men may haue their due honour, and the rest be not in iuriously dealt withall.
Then Mecoenas, what thing is it ({quod} he) that neuer bringeth lothsomnesse to man? The likenesse, answered Virgil, or the abundance of euery thinge, anoyeth vs, except of vnderstandyng.
He asked moreouer, how a man might alwayes preserue his happie and fortunate state? To whom then Maro, if by how much he excell other in Honour, and Ritches: he endeuour to excell them in Liberalitie an Iustice.
He was wount also to say, that there was nothyng more méet nor commodious for a man then Pacience, and that
there was no fortune so sharpe which by wisely tolleratyng a valient man might not ouercome.
Which opinion of his, he hath expressed in the fist of the Aeneidos.
Goddesse sun, where destnies drawes driues: let vs go there, What euer it is, who conquer fortune will, must fortune beare.
There was familiar with Augustus one named Filistus, an oratour, and méetly wel learned in Poetrie, and had a pleasant, and variable witte, and vsed to carpe the saiynges of all men, not to th'intent thereby to learne the truth (for so Socrates was woont to do) but therby to appeare the better learned.
The same, wheresoeuer he had occasion to méete with Virgil or be in his companie, vsed to prouoke him with reproches, and floutes.
Wherfore, either he departed commonly with silence, or els with blusshing held his peace.
Then when as in presence of Augustus, he sayde that Virgil was dumbe, and that if he had a toongue he coulde not defend himself: hold thy peace babler ({quod} he) for this taciturnitie of myne causeth Augustus, and Mecoenas to be the patrones of my cause, and when list will speake with suche a trumpet, that shall euerywhere, and very longe be heard.
And thou with thy pratlyng dost not only breake mens eares, but walles also.
Then the Emperour looked vpon Filistus with a fierce countenance, and rebuked him.
And Virgil, Caesar ({quod} he) if this man knew a time to holde his peace: he would seldome speake.
For a man ought alwaies to be silent, vntill such time as his silence shall either hurt himself, or his talke may profit others.
When Augustus had obtayned the Empire, he debated with him self whether it were better to resigne vp the Dominion, and commit the state to yéerely Consuls, and the gouernment of the Commonwealth to the Senate.
In which case he called to counsell twayne, of two seuerall opinions, Mecoenas, and Agrippa.
Agrippa in longe discourse shewed, that although it were not very decent for him to do, yet would it be profitable, which contrarie, Mecoenas very much diswaded him from.
By occasion wherof, Augustus minde was brought into great perplexitie, for their sundrie opinions, were confirmed by sundrie reasons.
Wherfore he demaunded of Maro, whether it were expedient for a priuate man, to vsurpe a gouernment in his co~mon wealth or not? Then Virgil, vnto all ({quod} he) that haue vsurped the state of their commonwealth, the gouernme~t hath bin wearysom both vnto them, and to the subiectes, bycause that of necessitie through
hatred of the people, or suspicio~ growinge to them of their owne great iniustice: they do liue in much feare.
But if the citizens could finde eny one, whom they do loue entierly: it should be profitable to the citie, if he were set in auctoritie.
Wherfore, if you do continue to execute iustice to all men, without regard of eny person, as you haue alredie begunne, it shalbe most profitable both for your self, and all the worlde that you ruled, for you haue so much the goodwill of all men, that they honour you, and repute you for a God.
But since wée haue now breifly spoken of the auctour, it séemeth good wée speake of the kind of verse, which commonly is handled two maner wayes, that is to say, before the worke, and in the worke.
Before the worke are, the Title, the Cause, the Intention.
The cause, from whence it rose, and for what cause cheifly they Poet tooke this in hand to write.
The Intention, in the which is knowne his drift, where about the Poet goeth.
In the worke thrée thinges are marked, the Numbre, the Ordre, the Explanation.
Although therfore by falsification, manie workes are caried abroade vnder othermens names, as the tragedie of Thiestes made by this Poet, which Varrus setforth for his owne, manie such like: yet we cannot doubt but that cléerly the Bucolickes are Virgills, especially since the Poete, doubtinge some such matter, both in the beginninge of the Aeneidos, and in another place witnesseth that they are his, sayinge: that my slendre Ote~ pipe in verse was wont to sound.
Likewise that the rimes of sheapheardes sunge, and rash in tendre yeeres, Thee Tityrus &c.
That they be fitly termed Bucolickes, and so accompted: if nothing els declared, yet this might be proofe sufficient, that in Theocritus they be called by the same name.
There be thrée kindes of Sheapheardes that are famous in Buco+lickes.
The Opiliones, or Sheapheards are next of dignity, but ye Bubulci, or Cowheardes are the best and chiefest.
Wherof therfore was it most conuenient that the Sheapheardes verse shuld be named, but of that degrée which is found most excellent amongst Sheapheardes?
The cause may be two wayes considered, of the beginninge of the verse, and of the minde of the writer.
There are some that saye this kinde of verse was first instituted to Diana, by the Sheapheardes of Lacedaemonia, when through occasion of warre, which at that tyme the Persians made vpon all Greece, the virgins could not do sacrafice accordinge to their custome.
Others some say, that the same kynde of verse was made to Diana by Orestes, when he wandred about Sicilia.
What euer they all say, this is most certen, that the Bucolik verse, tooke beginninge of great antiquitie, when men ledde only sheapheardes liues, and therefore the simplicitie of such personages doth represent a shewe of the golden wordle.
Wherfore Virgil begunne very commendably with those, verses, as it were, with that life, which was first in the earth.
For afterward the fieldes were tilled, and last of all, for earable and fertyle ground: contention rose, and warres ensued, which Virgil, that he would expresse: sange first of sheapheardes, next of Husbandmen, and last of warriours.
It remayneth now that wée consider what cause mooued the Poet cheifly to write the Bucolickes.
Ether he was entised by the swéetnes to haue Theocritus verse in admiration, or else for orders sake he sought to expresse the life of man, as wée haue sayd before.
Or rather that Virgil would setfoorth the thrée kindes of Elocution, which the Greekes call Carecters, Ischnon that is, lowe, Adron which is loftie, Meson, that is the mean or middle.
Whefore beinge likely that he which was right cunninge in all the kindes: endited his Bucolickes in the first, the Georgikes in the second, and the Aeneidos in the third.
Or therfore it is to be sup+posed he wroat the Bucolickes first, to thintent in that kind of verse which is more frée and rough then the rest he might take opportunitie to currie the Emperours fauour, and to recouer his lande which he had lost, for this cause.
The third day of the Ides of March, when C. Caesar was stayne, and the old souldiours had taken vp Augustus Caesar beinge but a child to be their captayne, the senate not much repugninge against it, a ciuile warre risinge therof, the Cremone~ses with other of the same faction, aided the aduersaries of Augustus Caesar.
Wherby it came to passe that when Augustus had the victory he commaunded that the old souldiours shuld be brought in to the Cremonen+ses fieldes, to deuide, and possesse them.
And when their fieldes were not sufficient for them all: their neighbours the Mantuans, amonge whom was Virgil, lost a great part of their landes, by cause they lay
But Virgil, presuminge on the familiaritie which he had with Augustus, and on his owne verses: durst resist Arius the Centurian.
He strait wayes, like a souldyour, put his hand to his sword.
And when Virgil had betake himself to flight: he left not of followinge him, vntill Virgil had cast himself into a riuer, and so escaped.
But afterward through the fauour of Mecoenas, and Pollio, and Augustus himself, he was restoared to his landes.
The Intention of the booke which the Graetians call Scopus, is grounded on the imitation of Theocritus the Poet, who was both a Sicilia~ and a Syracusia~.
The intentio~ also is to be reduced into ye praise of Caesar, and other princes and noblemen by whose meanes he was brought againe into his former seat, liuing.
Wherby yt the end might co~taine both delectatio~, profect: he did althinge accordinge to ordre, precept.
This question is sometime asked why he wroate no moe then ten Ecloges, which wilbe no meruayle vnto him that shall waigh the antiquitie of the pastorall Scenes, which cannot be stretched beyonde this numbre, and since this Poet more circumspect then Theocritus as the matter it self declareth, séemeth to doubt least that Ecloge which is in+tituled Pollio, will not appeare rusticklike enough, whiche he beginneth after this maner, saying: Sicilian Muses, of thinges sumdeale greater let vs singe.
And this wée foretell to be obserued in al the Bucolikes of Virgil, that they are neither wholy destitute of figures, neither altogither full of figures, that is to say Allagories.
These thinges are scarce to be graunted vnto Virgis, for the prayse of Caesar, and to recouer his landes, since Theocritus, whom Virgil sought by all endeuour to imitate: wroate altogether plainly, and simply.
As touchyng such thinges as accustomably are handled in the verse are these: Numbre, Order, Explanation The numbre of the Eclogs is apparant, for there are Ten, of which, seuen are thought properly to deserue the name of Bucolickes.
For the last thrée ought not to be called Bucolickes, namely Pollio, Silenus, and Gallus.
The first therfore contayneth a publique complaint, and a priuate thankes gouyng for land, and is called Tityrus.
The second, the loue of a boy, and is termed Alexis.
The third, a contention of Sheapheards, and is called Paloemon.
The eight, the loues of diuers sexes, and is named Damon.
The ninth contayneth a complaynt for his lost landes, and is termed Moeris.
The tenth, the disier of Gallus, and is called Gallus.
As touchynge the order of them, wée must vnderstand this, that only in the first and last Ecloges the Poete would keep due order, for in the one he began, as he witnesseth in the Georgickes: Tityrus, of thee sange, vnder the broad Beech tree.
In the other he shewed the end, when he sayth, This finall trauayle mine, graunt Arethusa vnto mee.
But amongst the Eclogs that there is no sheapheardly, or prescript order obserued, it is most certen.
Wherefore there are some, that say the Bucolikes begin not at Tityrus, but: Our Muse in Syracusian verse vouchsaued first to play.
There remaineth now Explanation, vnto which before wée come, must admonish this, that the verse of a Bucolike is but a stender verse, and so farre differyng from the stile of the Heroike: that this kinde of verse hath his peculiar diuision, and cuttinges, and is dist inguished by his owne proper lawes.
For, since a verse is prooued by thrée thynges, cutting, scannyng, and tunyng: it is no Bucolike verse vnlesse the first foote do contayne a full part of the sense, and the third foote be Trochaeus and a cuttyng, and the third being rather a Dactile then a Spondeus: do finish a parcell of sense, the fift and sixt féete consist of whole words.
Which beyng obserued by Theocritus, yet wearied at length through difficultie of the worke: he neclected it, only in the beginnyng it is vncertayne whether diligence, or chaunce did kéep these cuttynges.
For, Tityre, a Dactile finisshed part of the Oration: tu patu, lae re cu, cloased vp the third Trochaeus, though in a compounde word: bans sub, and when he had put the fourth Spondeus for a Dactile, tegmine fagi, when he had ended the partes of oration, he absolued the whole Co~ma, wherin the diligence of Theocritus almost in all his verses is wounderfull.
And he that shall diligently with sharpe iudgement consider the aboue written, shall easely vnderstand what is the intention of the Georgikes, and what the ende, and likewise also in the Aeneidos.
There are thrée kinde of stiles in a Poeme, ether Actiue, ether Imitatiue which Graecians call Dramaticum, wherein are persons brought
in speakinge, without speakyng of the Poet, such as Tragoedies, and Comoedies are.
In which kinde first Tityrus was writen, then next Quo te Moeri.
Or els Enerratitiue, which the Greekes call Diegematicon, in which the Poet himself speaketh without interpretation of persone, as the first thrée bookes of Georgikes.
Ether els commune, and mixt, which the Greekes do terme Micton, where both the Poet himself doth speake, and personnes lykewyse are brought in, such as is the Aeneidos of Virgil.

GENERAL SVM WHEREOF ALL THE XII. BOOKES OF AENEIDOS DO ENTREATE.
WHEN Troy was destroyed by the Greekes, and theyr most of Noblitie slayne, Aeneas beynge Sonne to prince Anchises, and begotten of VENVS, a man of most valient courage and vertue (after great slaugh ter made on his enemies) was forced to flee his cou~trey, and takyng with him his Images and Goddes, whom he than worshipt for his auouries, withdrew himself to the sea, with his sunne Ascanius, and his olde father Anchises and family to whom a great number of Troians, from euery quarter resorted, and ioynyng togethers vnder him, erected a Nauie of twenty ships and departed to seas, perswaded by their Goddes, that they should come to a land, where their kingdom should florish.
First he arriued in Thracia, and would haue remayned there, but vnderstanding that yonge Polydorus his cosin was murthered there by the kynge therof, for his Golde, he forsooke that coouetous land, and after he had builded a citie called of his name Aeneas.
From thence he sailed into Candy, where he was setled a whyle, but he felt his prophecie wronge expounded, and was put from thence by a pestilence.
Than remembryng that his auncient forefathers came out of Italy and beynge better instructed by his Gods, that Italy should be his place and kyngdome appoynted: he cut another course to the land of Chaonia, where one Helenus raigned, beyng his kinsman a Troian, of whom he learned many thinges touching his Prophecie, and was newly refreshed with men, amour, and treasour.
He passed from thence to the yle of scicil, and was there wel receiued of king Acestes his cosin, and there he buried his old father Anchises, by which time, vij. yeres wear almost expired.
Than hauing but a short iourney to Italy, he went thitherwards out of Scicil, and by the way was taken with an horrible tempest, and driuen from Italy an extreme course, to the countrey of whyte Moores in Affrike, and after extreme desperation, was honourably there enterteyned of the Queene DIDO a widow, with whom he ioyned in loue, and remayned till his Gods
When Troy was taken, Aeneas the sonne of Anchises and Venus, a man endued with singulare godlynesse, and lyke valiencie whylst in the seuenth yeare of his wandring he sayled vpo~ the Tyrrhene sea fro~ Sicil, towardes Italy, a mighty tempest beyng raysed by Aeolus the kyng of windes at lunos request: was driuen to the shoare of Afrike, where entring on the lande, he slewe with bowe and arrowes seuen great stagges and deuided them equally to eche ship one, for so many sayle he had gathered together of his dispearsed fleet, and hartneth his souldiers ouerweryed nowe with trauayle, with the hope of future rest: manfully to endure the labours that were yet to come.
In the meane whyle Venus pleadeth her sonne Aeneas, and al the Troianes cause before Iupiter, and imputeth al those calamities vnto Iuno, but Iupiter on the other side, disclosing al the order of the destrinies: recomforteth his daughter with hope of happy posteritie, and power of the Romanes. wherwith Venus being wel satisfied: meeteth with her sonne Aeneas, being ignorant of the place, and romyng vp and downe in the countrey, and sheweth him how that his dispersed shippes be safe, and telleth hym that Carthage is not farre of, a citle which Dido buylded in that place.
wherfore Aeneas by his mothers meane beyng shrowded in an hollowe cloude accompanyed with Achates: entreth into Carthage, where both he findeth his mates safe, and is curteously entertayned of Dido the Queene.
Venus notwithstandyng not ouermuch trusting to Iunos entertaynme~t, nor the vnco~stancie of women, laying Ascanius a sleepe in the woodes of Ida: addressed Cupide in his steede, who amongst embracinges, and kisses, priuily inspireth the Queene with the loue of Aeneas.
That my slender Oten Pype in verse was woont to sounde
Of woods, and next to that taught for husbandemen the grounde, How frute vnto their gréedie lust thei might constraine to bring, worke of thankes: Lo now of Mars, and dreadfull warrs sing, Of annes, and of the man of Troy, that first by fatall fight Did thence arriue to Lauine lande, that now Italia, hight.
But shaken sore with many a storme by seas and land ytost, And all for Iunos endles wrath that wrought to haue had him lost.
And sorowes great in wars he bode, ere he the walls could frame Of myghty Rome, and bring the gods taduaunce the Romaine name.
Now Muse direct my song to tell for what offence and why:
What aylid so the quéene of gods to dryue thus cruelly, This noble prince of vertue mylde from place to place to toile, Such paines to take? may heauenly mynds so sore in rancour boile? There was a town of auncient tyme Carthago of old it hight, Against Italia and Tybers mouth lay loof at seas aright: Both riche in wealth and sharpe in war, the people it held of Tyre: This town aboue al townes to raise was Iunos most desyre, For sooke her seate at Samos yle and here her armes she set, Her chare, and here she myndes to make (if all godds do not let)
An empyre all the world to rule: but heard she had beforne
From Troy should ryse a stock, by whom their towres should all be forne That far and wyde should beare the rule, so fearre in war to feele: That Lyby land destroy thei should, so fortune turnes the wheele.
For feare of that, and calling eft the olde war to her mynde, That she at Troy had doen before for Greekes her fréends so kynde.
Ne from her hart the causes old of wrath and sore disdaine Was slakyd yet, but in her brest high spyte did still remaine.
How Paris Venus beautie praised and hers estéemed at naught.
She abhores the stock and Ganimede whom Ioue to heauen had raught, Thus flamed in her moode, she kest through al the seas to throwe
The sely poore remain of Troye that Greekes had laied so lowe.
And them that wild Achilles wrath had spared aliue at last From Italy she thought to keep till deftnies should be past.
And many a yeare they wandred wyde, in seas and soondrie pyne, So houge a worke of weyght it was, to buyld of Rome the lygne.
Scant from the syght of Scicil yle, their sailes in mery aray Went vnder wynd, and through the seas, and salt fome made their way: When Iuno her bethought again of her immortal wound
And shall leaue it thus {quod} she? shall yet this Troyan king For all my worke to Italie this people safely bring? trow the destnye wils it so, but dyd not Pallas burne fleete of Greekes, and in the seas them all did ouerturne
For one mans sinne, and for the faut of Aiax made to fall? She threw the fiers of mighty Ioue from skies vpon them all.
And drownd their ships, and he him self with whirlewynde set a sier All smoking on the roks she kest his carcas to erpier But I, that quéene of gods am cald and sister of Ioue in throne And eke his wyfe, how long war with this poore stocke alone? So many a yere? and who shal now dame Iunos godhead knowe, Or shortly vpon myne altars who due honours will bestow?
Thus rolling in her burning brest she straight to Aeolia hyed
Into the countrey of cloudy skyes where blustring wyndes abyde.
King Aeolus the wrasiling wynds in caues he locks full lowe: In prison strong the stormes he kéepes forbidden abrode to blowe.
Thei for disdaine with murmour great at euery moush do rage, But he a loft with mace in hand their force doth al aswage.
If he so did not: lands and seas and skyes they would so swéepe Within a while, that all were gone.
Therfore in dongeons déepe Almighty Ioue did close them vp, and hilles hath ouerset, And made a king, that should know when to louse them, when to let.
Whom to entreat this Iuno came, and thus to him she spake: King Aeolus, for vnto thée the great god hath betake And giuen thée leaue to lift the flouds and calm to make them still: On Tyrrhen sea there sailes a fléete that beares me no good wil.
To Italy thei mynde to passe, a newe Troy there to bylde.
Let out thy wynds and all their ships do drowne with waters wylde.
Disperse them al to sondrie shores or whelme them downe with déepe.
Of goodly Ladies seuen and seuen about me do kéepe, Whereof the fairest of them all that cald is Deiopey, Shalbe thyne owne for euermore, my mynde if thou obey, And of a goodly son (quod she) she shall thée make a syer.
To that said Aeolus: Quéene: what néedes all this desyer: Commaund me dame, must obey, my dutie it is of right, By you this kingdom first gat, and grace of Ioue on hight.
You make me sit among the gods at banketts this ye know, You gaue me might these stormy wynds to strain, or make to blow.
He turnd his sword when this was said, and through the hil he pusht And at that gap with throngs atones the wynds furth out thei rusht.
The whirlewinds to the land went out, and then to seas thei flewe, Both East and West, and from the sauds the waues aloft thei threw.
The stormy South again the cliues the waters dryue so hye,
That cables al began to crack, and men for dreed to crye,
Anone was taken from Troians eyes both sight and light of sonne And on the sea the grym darke night to close all in begonne.
The thonders roard, and lightning lept full oft on euery syde, There was no man but present death before his face espyde.
Aeneas than in euery lymme with cold began to quake, With hands vp throwen to heauens aloft his mone thus gan he make.
ten tymes treble blessed men that in their parents sight Before the loftye walls of Troy, did lose their lyues in fight.
Could not of thy force haue fallen and shed my lyfe right out: In Troian feelds? where Hector ferce lyeth vnder Achilles launce King Serpedon and many a lord, how blisfull was their chaunce? Whose bodies with their armes and shéeldes in Simois waters sinkes.
As he thus spake, the Northern blast his sailes brake to the brinkes,
Vnto the skyes the waues them lift, their ores bin all to torne, Away goth helme, and with the surge the ship syde downe is borne, In come the seas, and hye as hills some hang in studs aboue, Some down the gaping water sends against the sands to shoue.
There thre at ones the Sothern wynd into the rocks hath cast (So they call stones that in the seas lyke altars lye full fast) And thre the Eastern wynde also (that pitie it is to thinke) Out of the déepe into the sholdes, and quicksands made to sinke.
And one that men of Lycia land, and trusty Orontes helde, Afore his face there fela sea that made the puppe to yelde.
And hedlong down the master fals, and thryse the keele aground The water whirlde, and at the last the wylde sea swallowd round.
Than might you see both here and there, men with their armour swim, The robes and peinted pompe of Troy lay fléeting on the brim, And now the ships where Ilionee, and where Achates strong, And where as Abas went, and where Alethes liuing long, The wether had woon, and through the ribs the seas came wonders fast:
With woonder how so great a rage should hap to him vntold, And forth his noble face he putts the waters to behold, There saw he how Aeneas shipps through all the seas bespred, And Troian folks yound with flood, and stormes falke ouer head.
Anon the craft thereof he knew, and Iuno his sisters yre.
Strait by their names he calls the windes, who than began retyre.
Are you so bold you blastes (quod he) without my licence here The lands and skies and seas also with such a storme to stéere? will be quyte: but first is best the floods to set in stay, And after this for your deserts be sure shall you pay.
In hast begone, go tell your king the seas is not his charge, But vnto me that lot befell with mace threforked large.
Not here, but in his caues of wynde, his court go bid him keepe.
There let him if he list, you blasts enclose in prison déepe.
This spoken: with a thought he makes the swelling seas to cesse,
And Sunne to shine, and clouds to flée, that did the skies oppresse.
The Mermaides therwithal appeares, and Triton fléetes aboue, And with his forke thei al the ships from rocks do softly moue, Then letts he lose the perlous sandes that ships a way may slyde, And on the seaful smoothe his chare with whéeles he made to ryde.
And lyke as in a people stoute whan chaunceth to betyde The multitude to make a fray of wit full often wyde, That stones, and weapons flyes abroad, and what come furst to hand, Some sadman comth, that for his right is loued of al the land: Anon they ceasse and silence make, and down thei lay their rage, To harke at him, and he with speche their wood myndes doth aswage.
So fel this deadly fray at sea, when Neptune had controlde The waters wyld, and through the seas his chare abroad had rolde.
The men of Troy vnto the shore that next was in their sight
Made hast to drawe, and on the cost of Africa they light.
Far in the shore there lyeth an yle, and there besydes a bay, Where from the chanell déepe the hauen goeth in and out alway.
On either syde the reaches hie, to heauen vp clyme to growe, And vnder them the stil sea lyeth, for there no breth can blowe.
But gréene wood like a garland growes, and hydes them al with shade, And in the midds a pleasaunt caue there stands of nature made, Where sits the Nimphes among the springs in seates of mosse and stone When ships are in, no Cables néede nor ankers néede they none.
Then from the ship to walke a lande Aeneas longid sore, And chose of all the number seuen and brought with him to shore.
There by a banke their wéery limmes of salt sea did thei stretche,
And first Achates from the flynt a sparke of fyer did fetche,
Which he receiued in matter meete, and drye leaues laied about.
Than vitells out they layd a lande, with seas welnere ymarde.
And corne to drie they set, and som with stones they brusyd hard, There whylest Aeneas vp the rocke was gone to walke on hye, To sée where any ships of his astray he might espye, If Caicus armes vpon the sayle, or Capis happs to showe.
No boate in sight, but on the shore thre Harts there stode arowe: And after them the heard behinde along she valley fedde.
He stayed, and of his bowe and bolts Achates straite him spedde.
The chéef that hyest bare their heads, adown with darts he kest, And to the woods he folowed than with lyke pursuite the rest.
He left them not till seuen of them were falne with bodies greate, To matche the number of his shipps that now had neede of meate.
Than to the hauen he doth the fleshe among his men deuide, And pipes of wine departed eke that was abourde that tide, Which good Acestes had them giuen when they from Scicile went.
And than to cheere their heauy harts with these words he him bent.
mates quod he, that many a wo haue bidden and borne ere this,
Worse haue wée séene, and this also shall ende when gods will is.
Through Scilla rage (you wot) and through the roring rocks wée past, Though Ciclops shore was ful of fear, yet cam wée through at last.
Pluck vp your harts and driue from thence both thought and feare away, To thinke on this may pleasure be perhaps another day.
With paines and many a daunger sore by sondrie chaunce wée wende, To come to Italia where wée trust to finde our resting ende, And where the destnyes haue decréed Troys kindoms eft to rise, Be bolde, and harden now your selfs take ease when ease applise.
Thus spake he tho, but in his hart huge cares him had opprest,
Dissymling hope with outward eyes, full heauy was his brest,
Than all bestyrd them to the praye, the bankettes gan beginne, The skinnes from of the flesh they pluct, and eke thentrailes within.
Some cut their shares, and quaking yet on broches gan to broyle, Some blew the fyer to burne, and some their cawdrons set to boyle.
Good cheere they made and fed them fast as on the grasse they sat, With wine and vittels of the best, and red deare good and fat.
Whan meate was done and honger past, and trenchers vp were take, Great serch and talking for theyr fréends that were behind they make.
In hope and dreed of them they stand, and whether a liue they be Or what is elles of them become, or shall they hem euer see.
But chiefly good Aeneas dyd the case full sore lament Of stoute Orontes and Amicus whom the seaes had hent, And other whiles he syghed sore for Licus piteous fall, And mighty Gias and Cloanthus mournd he most of all.
And now an ende therof therwas, when Ioue him self on hye Beheld the seas where shyps do sayle, and broad londs vnder skye.
And from the toppes of heauens aboue he kest his eyes adowne, And stayed to loke on Affrike land and who there bare the crowne.
And vnto him as to and fro his carefull mynd he cast: Came Venus in, and sad she was vnlyke her custome past.
With teares about her eyes so bright she thus began to playne: kinge ({quod} she) that ouer vs all both gods and men dost raygne For euermore, and with thy dintes of lighting makest a fright: What hath my son Aeneas wrought or spoken agayne thy might? What hath the symple Troians done? that after tormentes all, From Italy to keepe them of the world is made to small? Somtyme ye said ther shuld arise (whan yeres wer comen about) The men of Rome that of the ligne of Troy should be so stout, That seas and londes shold to their rule both far and nye suppresse.
What makes mighty father now your will a way to dresse? In hope therof ywis tooke the fall of Troy so lyght, And thought amendes shuld now be made and pleasur payn to quyte But now see the same mischaunce the poore men yet to chase.
What ende therof shall wee a wayte at your almighty grace? Antenor through the middes of Greece had fortune sauf to steale, And to Lyburnus kingdome came as destnye list to deale Euen to the middes therof, and head wherout Tymauus springs, Where issues nine the sea makes in, for noise the mountain rings.
Yet for the men of Troy to dwell a citie bylt he there, Padua by name, and gaue them lawes and armes of Troy to beare.
Now lyeth he there in pleasaunt rest, no wight him doth disease, But wee your stock whom to the starres of heauen admit you please: Our shyps destroyed (I abhorre to thinke) and for the cruell spight Of one alone, wee be betrayed and spoyled of our right, Ne to the coastes of Italy for ought wée can attayne.
Is this the fathers loue wee fynd? so stablish you my raygne? The maker of the Gods and men to her all sweetely smyles With countnaunce such as from the skies ye stormes cloudes exiles.
And swéetely kosthys doughter dere, and ther withall he speakes: Feare not ({quod} he) thy mens good hap, for none their fortune breaks.
Thy kyngdome prosper shall, and eke the walles thee behight: Thou shalt sée rise in Lauyne land and grow ful great of might.
And thou thy sonne Aeneas stout to heauen shalt bryng at last,
Amonge the gods be sure of this, my mynd is fixed fast.
And now to thée disclose shall (for sore sée thée dout) The long discourse of destenyes that yeres shall bryng about.
Great warre in Italy haue he shall, ere he the people wyld May vndertread, and lerne to lyue, and than the citie byld.
That sommers thre ere he shall syt as king them shall renew, And winters thre, before he can the Rutyls all subdewe.
Than shall Ascanius (now a childe) whose name Yulus hyght, (Was Ylus cald when Troys estate and kingdome stode vpryght) Till space of thirtie yeres expire his kyngdome shall obtayne, And he from Lauyne shall translate the olde state of the raygne, And strongly fortifye the towne of Alba longe shall he, Where whole thre hundred yeres the stock of Hector kings shalbe.
with child by Mars two twinnes to light shal bring
Whom wolues shal nurse, and proude therof he growes that shalbe king.
He Romulus shall take the rule, and vp the walles shall frame Of mightie Rome, and Romaines all shall call then of his name, No ende to their estate set, ne termes of tyme or place, But endles shall their empire growe and Iunos cruell grace That now with feare the grounde beneth turmoiles, and eke the skyes, Shall leaue her wrathe, and worke with me, and take more sad auyse, To loue the Romaines lords of peace, and people clad in gowne.
Let it be so: let tyme roll on, and set furth their renowne.
Then shal be borne of Troian blood the emprour Caesar bright, Whose empire through the seas shal stretch and fame to heauen vpright And Iulius his name it is of mightie Iule deriued: Him laden full of Esterne spoyles by him in warrs atchiued: In heauen thou shalt bestowe full glad, and vowes men shal him hight.
Then down goth war, men shalbe mylde, in armes shal not delight, Then truth and right and Romane gods shal sit with lawes in hande, The gates of war with bolts and barrs of hard stéele fast shall stande.
And therewithin on armour heapes sits Batail rage, and wailes With brasen chaines a hundred bounde, his wastling not auailes.
Thus much he saied, and down anon the son of May he sent,
That new Carthage, and al the costes of Affrike should be bent
The Troians to receyue a land, lest Dido there the Quéene Might from her shore expell them of, er she the cause had séene.
And downe he flyes him throughe the skyes, with wings as swift as And on the land of Lyby stode, and did his fathers mynde. (wynde With that the Moores laid down their rage (as god did bid) and eke The Quéene her self gan turne, and to the Troians waxed meke.
But good Aeneas all that night his mynde about he tost, And in the morning went him out to serche and sée the cost, To learne what land thei were com to, what people dwelt thereon If men or saluage beasts it hold, for tilde he could sée non.
This would he know, and to his men the truthe of all to tell.
Therwhilest within a water caue his shipps he made to dwell, Whom trées woods with shadowes thicke and eke the rocke doth hyde.
Than forth he goth, and toke but one Achates by his syde.
And launces two thei bare in hand of metal sharpe and light, And as thei went amid the wood he met his mother right, Most like a maide in maidens wéede, she maidens armour beares, As doth Harpalicee the Quéene that horses wilde outweares.
So wight of fote, that Heber streame so swift she leaues behinde, For hunterlike her how she bare, her locks went with the winde Behinde her backe, and tuckt she was that naked was her knée.
She cald to them and said, good sirs, pray you did you sée To stray this way as ye haue come, my sisters any one? With quiuer bound that in the chase of some wild best are gone? Or with a cry pursueth a pace the fomy bore to paine? So Venus said, and Venus son her answerd thus againe.
None of thy sisters haue séen nor heard thée assure mayde, what shal make of thée, thy face sée so pure.
Not mortall like, ne like mankinde thy voice doth sound, gesse Some goddesse thou art, and Phebus bright thy brother is doubtles, Or of the noble Nymphes thou comest, of grace we thée beseche What euer thou art, and helpe our néede, and now vouchsaue to teach What lond is this? what coast of heauen be we come vnder here? Where nether man nor place we know, so straied we haue in frre, Out of our course we haue béene cast with windes and floods yshake, Afore thine altars many a beast to offre vndertake.
As for mine altars ({quod} she tho) no suche estate beare, The maner is of virgins here this short aray to weare.
In purple wéede wee vse to walke with quiuer light onbound, The realme of Affrike here thou séest, and men of Tyrus ground.
Here is the citie of Agenor, ferce be the lands about, Quéene Dido rules and weres the crowne from Tyrus she came out And lately from her brother fled, the cause is long to lere.
The story long, but touch will the chief and leaue it there.
Sicheus was her husband tho: the richest man of ground In al that coast, and déepe (good hart) in loue with her was dround.
For her to him her father gaue a virgin yet ontwyght And to her brother came the crown of Tyrus than by right Pigmalion, a sinfull wretch of all that euer raignde, Whom couetise did blinde so sore, and rage of fury strainde, That onaware, with priuy knife before the altars pure He slew Sicheus, and of his sisters loue he thought him sure.
And long he kept the déede in close, and she good soule full sad The crafty théefe made wondrous meanes and tales her mind to glad.
But in a dreame (vnburied yet) her husband came tappere With visage pale, and wondrous hewes, ful deadly was his chere And told her all, and wide his wound disclosing shewd his brest How he before the altars was, for what entent opprest.
And had her flée the wicked soile ere worse might her befall.
And treasor vnder grounde he shewd to helpe her therwithall, Both golde and siluer plenty great vnknowen till than, and so This Dido did, and made her fréends and ordeind furth to go.
Than such as for his wicked life the cruell tirant hates, Or ben afraied of him for ought, them getts out of the gates In ships that readie lay by chaunce, the gold with them thei packt Thei spoild also Pigmalion, this was a womans act.
Than past thei furth and here thei came, where now thou shalt espie The hugy walls of new Carthage that now they rere so hie. Thei bought the soile and Birsa it cald whan first thei did begin, As much as with a bull hide cut thei could inclose within.
But what are you faine would know, or what coast come ye fro? Where woulde you bée? demaunding thus he answerd her onto.
With sighing déepe, and from his brest heauy his tale he fet.
lady mine ({quod} he) to tell if nothing did me let,
And of our paines ye list to here the stories out at large: The day were short, and ere an end the sunne would him discharge.
Of auncient Troy (if euer Troy beside your eares hath past) Of thens be wée: by sundrie seas and coasts wée haue ben cast.
And now the tempest hath vs brought to Lyby land by chaunce.
My name Aeneas clepyd is any countrey gods (taduaunce) In ships bring: vnto the starrs well blased is my fame.
Of Italy séeke the lond, and Ioues offpring ame Troian fleete tooke to sea with twenty vessels wide, My mother goddesse taught my way, as destny did me gide.
Now seuen thereof do skant remain, the rest with wethers gon, And vnknowen in wildernesse here walke and comfort non.
From Asia and from Europa quite thus driuen am: with that She could no longer byde him speake, but brake his tale therat.
What euer thou art ({quod} she) for well wot the gods aboue Doth loue thée much to saue thy lyfe to this place to remoue.
Go forth to yonder Palais straight, assay the Quéene to sée, For safe thy company a land be set beléeue thou me.
And safe thy ships are come to shore, with Northen wind at wil,
Onles my cunning failes me nowe whom wont was to skil.
Behold the flocke of sixe and sixe that yonder chéerly flies Of Swannes, whom late an Egle ferce did chace through al the skies.
Now toward lond, or on the lond, they séeme their course to kéepe, And as for ioy of danger past their winges aloft they swéepe With myrth and noise: right so thy men and al thy shipps a row Be come to hauen, or nere the hauen in safgard, this knowe.
Now get thee forth, and where the way thée ledes hold on thy pace.
Skant had she said, and thérwithall she turnd aside her face, As read as rose she gan to shine, and from her heauenly heare The flauour sprang, as Nectar swéete, down fell her kirtell there, And like a goddesse right she fled.
Whan he his mother wist, He folowed fast and cald (alas) what mean you, thus to list In fained shapps so oft to me begiling to apeare? Why hand in hand embrace wee not, and iointly speake and heare? Thus plaining sore he still his pace vnto she citie holdes.
But Venus as they went, a weede about them both she foldes, Of myst and cloud and aire so thicke, that no man shuld them fyie Ne do them harme, nor interrupt, nor aske them who nor why.
And eke him selfe among the lords of Greece he saw to be.
And armies out of Inde there came and Memnons blacke aray, And from the realme of Amazon with thronges and targettes gay Penthasilee Virago féers, amids the millions standes In armour girt, her pappe set out with lace of golden bandes, Quéene of war, though maide she be, with men she likes to trie.
Whyle thus about this Troian duke Aeneas led his eie.
With maruel much, and ernest stoode him still in one to vewe, To temple comes this Dido lo, the Quéene so faier of hewe Of lordes and lusty yonkers fine about her many a rout.
Most like vnto Diana bright whan she to hunt goth out.
Vpon Eurotas bankes, or through the copps of Cynthus hill Whom thousands of the ladie Nymphes awaite to do her will.
She on her armes her quiuer beres, and al them ouershynes, And in her brest the tikling ioy her hart to mirth enclines.
So Dido came, and freshly glad amonge the prease she past.
And forward she their work set forth and cherly biddes them hast.
Whan she into the temple came, before the goddesse gate Amidds her gard, her downe she sat in seate of great estate.
There iustice, right and law she gaue, and labours did deuide In euquall parts, or ells by lot let men their chaunce abide.
Whan sodenly Aeneas seeth with great concourse to throng Both mighty Anteas and Serestus, and Cloanthus strong.
And other Troians many one, whom wethers wide had spred And driuen abroade in sondry sortes to diuers coastes yled: Astoind with him Achates was, for ioy thei would haue lept To ioyne their hands, but fear agein them held and close ykept Tooke nothing on, and through the cloud thei hid, did all behold What chaunce thei had, and where their shipps and what shore might the~ hold What make they there, for men youlde of al the nauy chief With cries into the temple came, to seeke the Quéenes relief.
Whan they were in, and license had before the Quéene to speake, The greatest lord sir Ilionce, thus gan the silence breake.
Quéene to whoome is giuen of god to bylde this citie new,
And for your iustice peoples proud and saluage to subdue: Wée Troians poore, whom through the seas al tempests tossid haue, Beséeke your grace our seely shipps from wicked fier to saue.
Our painful case: wée come not here with wepons you to gréene, To spoyle the coast of Lyby land, nor boties hence to beare.
Wée conquerd men be not so bolde, our pride néede none to feare.
There is a place the Greekes by name Hesperia do call An auncient lond and stout in war, and fruteful soill withall Out from Enotria they came that furst did till the same, Now Italy men say is calde so of the capteins name.
To that our course was bent, Whan sodenly there rose at south a wind and tempest wood That toward shore enforst to fal, and so tooke on the flood, That in the rocks wée be disperst, wée few this coast haue caught.
What kind of men be these of yours? what maners wild ytaught This countrey kéepes? to lodge in sand wée can not suffred bee.
Thei fight, and non to tread a land thei can content to sée.
If mortall men you do despise and care for non in fight: Yet haue respect to goods aboue that iudge both wrong and right.
Wée had a king Aeneas cald, a iuster was ther non In vertue, nor in feates of war, or armes coulde matche him one.
Whom if the destnies kéepes aliue (if breath and aier of skies He drawes, nor yet among the goasts of cruell death he lies) There is no feare it shalbe quitte the fauour now you showe, You furst his kindnes to prouoke shal neuer repent knowe.
In diuers yles some cities be that Troian armour beares, Of Troians blood ther is also Acestes crown that weares.
Now gyue vs leaue our shaken ships to lay a land wée pray, And tymber to repare them eke, and ores to passe our way: That with our king if wée can méete, and eke our felowes moo: To Italy by your relief with glad chere wée may goo.
But if that comfort all be past, and mightie father thee The Lyby seas hath had, nor of Ascanius hope may wée: Yet at the least to Scicil yle, and seates that wil not swarue, From whens wee came let vs depart, and king Acestes serue.
So said sir Ilionee, the rest of the Troians cried the same At ones with murmour great.
Than Dido shortly full demure her eyes down set, and thus Cast of your care you Troians, set your hartes at eas for vs. Great néede, and yet the raw estate of this my kingdom newe, Compells me thus my coast to kéepe, and wide about me vietre.
Who knowes not of Aeneas? who? or hath not heard the name Of lusty Troy: and of the men and al that warre the flame?
We Moores be not so base of wit, ne yet so blunt of minde.
Ne from this town the sunne his stéedes so far away doth wind.
Go where you pleas, to Italy to old Saturnus feeldes, Or get you into Scicile land that king Acestes wéeldes.
will you helpe, and sée you saufe, and giue you goodes to go.
Wil you remaine euen here with me? can you content you so? This towne is yours, haue it made, set vp your ships anone: Troian and a Moore to me indiffrent shalbe one.
And would to god your king had hapt this way also to bend, And were hym self Aeneas here, forsoth will out send Along the coastes and wildernes, perhaps he may be found, Af anywhere in townes he straies, or woods of Affrike ground.
With this the Troians comfort tooke, and now Achates strong, And lords Aeneas through the cloud to breake thei thought it long.
Achates to Aeneas first him drew and to him said: Thou goddesse son what meanst thou thus: how long shal we be staid? Al thing thou séest is sauf and sure, our fléete, our frends, and all.
We misse but one whom in the middes of studds we saw to fall And drownd, but in the rest sée your mothers tale is trew.
Skant had he spoke, and sodenly the cloud from them withdrew, And vanisht into aier alone, and left them bare in light.
Aeneas stode and freshly shind, all men be hold him might, Most like a god with face and hew, for than his mother deare Set furth her son with shoulders faier, and comly shind his heare.
And with a roset youth his eies and countnaunce ouercheard, And white as burnisht Iuery fine his neck and hands appeard, Ful like as if the siluer cleare, or pearles are put in gold.
Than to the Quéene he steps, and said (all sodeinly) behold He that you séeke, lo here am, Aeneas Troian I: Escapid from the Lyby seas where lost was welny.
Quéene that in our woes (alone) such mercy dost extende To vs the poore remain of Troy, that welny brought to an ende By seas and londes are tost and tierd, of all thing bare and peld, Our town, our house, our peoples eke: you worthy thanks to yeld It lieth not Dido in our power nor what is euery where Of Troian blood, not all that through the wide world skattred were.
The almighty gods (if pitie they regard, or if there be Of iustice any whyt, or soule that vertue loues to sée) Do pay thy méede: what happy world forth such a treasur brought? What blessed father thée begat, and mother such hath wrought? While floods into the seas do runne, while hills do shadowes cast, And whyle the starrs about the skies doth turne and tary fast: Shall neuermore with me thy name thy praise and honor end, What land soeuer calth me to.
So sayd, and than his frend Sir Ilionee by hand he tooke, and than Serestus strong, The Quéene astoined gan to be, whan first she saw the sight, And waied the chaunce of such a lorde, and thus her words she dight.
Thou goddesse son, what fortune thée through al these dangers driues? What force onto this cruel shore thy person thus arriues? Art thou not he Aeneas whom from Dardanus the king, Anchises gat on Venus hie, where Symois doth spring? Ere this well remember, how that Teucer from his raigne Expulsed was, and to the town of Sidon flée was faine, Some helpe at Belus hand topteine, his kingdome to restore.
Than ward my father Belus wide in Cypers land so sore, And conquerd all and kept the state, that tyme heard the fall Of Troy, and eke the name of thée, and kings rehearcid all.
Their enmies of the Troians than great praise abrode did blowe, And of the auncient race of Troy to come he would be knowe.
Wherfore approche, and welcome all, my houses shall you host, For like mischaunce with labours sore, my self somtime hath tost.
And fortune here hath set me now, this land thus to subdewe, By proofe of paine haue ben taught on painfull men to rewe.
Thus talked she, and than Aeneas to her pallais brought, Whan on their altars thei had done such honors as thei thought.
Yet ceassed not the Quéene to send vnto his men that tide skore of bulles, and eke of brawnes a hundred rough of hyde, And with the dammes a hundred more of lambes both good and fat, The gladsome giftes of god.
The inner court was all beset with riches round about, And in the midds the feastes they gan prepare for all the rout, With precious clothes and conning wrought, proudly enbrodred wide.
And on the bourdes the mighty piles of plate there stode beside,
Whereon was grauen in golden worke the stories all by rowe, And déedes of lordes of antike fame a long discourse to knowe.
Aeneas than (for in his minde could loue not let him rest) His fréend Achates for his sonne Ascanius hath him drest Onto the shipps, and bad him tell the newes, and bring him there As fast as may, for in Ascanius fixt was al his feare.
And gifts with him he bad to bring from Troy destroyed yfet.
royal pal, that al with gold and stones was ouerset, And eke a robe with borders riche, sometyme it was the wéede Of Helene bright, whan Paris her from Grece to Troy did léede.
Her mother Ledas gift it was, a wondrous worke to viewe.
scepter eke that Ihonee king Priams doughter trewe Was wont to beare, and more a brooche that from her neck went down With precious pearles, and dooble set of fine golde eke a crown.
Théese thinges to fet Achates hast onto the nauie makes.
But Venus straunge deuises new, and counsails new she takes,
That Cupide shall the face and hewe of swéete Ascanius take, And beare the presents to the Quéene her heart a fier to make With feruent loue, and in her bones to fling the priuy flame.
Suspect she doth the Moores, that haue of dooble toong the name, And Iunos wrath her fretts, and in the night her care returnes.
Therefore she thus exhortes her son Cupide that louers burnes.
My son, that art my stay alone, my great renowne and might, My son, that of the thonderblastes of hye Ioue setst but light, How through the seas Aeneas myne thy brother hath ben thrown By cruell Iunos wicked wrath, to thée is not vnknown.
And often mournd with me thou hast therfore, but so it is, With Dido Quéene he lodgeth now, and faier he flattred is.
But wherto Iunos Innes wil turne, is matter hard to know, In such a time of daunger great thou maist not be to slow.
Wherfore preuenting al mischaunce, list to worke a wile, And with the flame of loue meane the Quéene now to begyle.
Lest by some misaduenture bad her minde she haply turne, But for Aeneas loue with me somedeale like she burne.
And how this thing ywrought shalbe, giue eare and know my minde.
Now goth the child, my chiefest care vnto his father kynde Into the town, and from the seas the presentes forth he brings That from the flames of burning Troy was kept as worthy things
Him purpose a sleape to make, and into hie Cythere, Or to my seates in Ida mount, all onaware to beare, That from this craft he may be farre, ne let herin do make Thou for a night, and not beyond, his forme and figure take Her to begile, and of a child thou child put on the face, That whan within her lappe the Quéene thée gladly shal embrace,
Among the royall pompe of meate and wine of Bacchus blisse,
And clippes thee swéete, and on thy lipps doth préesse the pleasant kisse: Disperse in her the secret flame and poyson swéete inspier.
Loue doth obey, puts of his winges, and after her desier Puts on Ascanius shap forthwith, and lyke the same he went.
But Venus on Ascanius swéete a restful slomber cast, And in her bosome vp she beares, and forth with him she past To Ida woods, where bedds of Tyme and Maioram so soft, And lusty flowres in gréenewod shade him breathes and comforts oft.
And now is Cupide on his way, Achates with him yeid, The royal presents to the court thei bare as thei were bydde.
Whan in they came, the Quéene her set in chaire on carpet gay, Of kingly state, with hangings riche in golde and proud aray.
And now the Lord Aeneas eke and youth of Troian rout Together came, in purple seates bestowd they were about.
The waiters gaue the waters swéete, and princely towels wrought, And eke the bread in sondrie gyse on basketts fine they brought.
And fifty ladies far within there was, that had the charge Of all the feast to be set forth, and fiers on altars large.
hundred more to wait and carue, and like of age and trade hundred gentlemen, the bourdes with deinty fare to lade.
And many lords of Moores among, at euery bourd to dine Came in, and wéere commanded sit on picturd carpets fine.
They wondred at the presents there, they wondred at Iule, His countnaunce quick, and wel that god his eyes and toong could rule: But specially the Quéene was caught in meruell to behold Vpon the chyld, vpon the pall, the giftes and robe of gold.
No sight her eyes could draw ther from, and as she loked more: The more she fell into the flame, that after paind her sore.
But chiefly to the noble boy she moues, who in a while Whan he his father false with loue and kissyng did begyle: Onto the Quéene he drew, and her with eyes and brest and all
About her neck embraseth swéete, and whole on her doth fall.
She on her lap somtyme him setts, good Dido nothingh knowes How great a god vpon her sitts, what cares on her he throwes.
He thinking on his mothers art, by smal and smal doth make The Quéene forget her husband dead, and him from mynde to shake.
And where of loue she nothing féeles her hart she kept so true: Her woonted heat and old desires he stéeres and doth renue.
Whan men from meate began to rest, and trenchers vp wer take, Great bolles of wines along thei set, and crownes on them thei make.
Great chere in all the chambers wyde, of noise the hall it ringes, And tapers toward night thei burne hie hangd with golden stringes.
And with the light of torches great the darke of driue atones.
The Quéene commaunds a mighty bolle of gold and precious stones To fill with wine, whom Belus king and al king Belus line Was wont to hold, than through them al was silens made by signe.
Ioue, {quod} she, for thou of hostes and gestes both great and small Men say the lawes hast put: giue grace pray, and let vs all Both Moores and also Troians here this day for good be met, That all our ofspring after vs this time in ioy may set.
Now Bacchus maker of the mirth, good Iuno goddesse déere, And you Moores go do your best théese Troians for to chéere.
Thus said she, and whan the grace was done, the boll in hand she sipt, And in the liquor swéete of wine her lipps she scantly dipt: But onto Bitias she it raught with charge, and he anon The fomy bolle of gold vpturnde, and drew till all was gon.
Than all the lordes and states about: And on his golden harp Iopas with his bushie locks in swéete song gan to carp, Of stories such as him had taught most mighty Atlas old.
The wandring Moone, and of the Sonne the daily toile he told.
How mankind was begoon and beaste, wherhens the fier and shoures
Procéedes, and how the starrs arisen and fallen in certein houres.
The wain, the plough starrs, the seue~ that storms and te~pest loures.
What meanes the sonne that to the seas he westward hieth so fast In winter daies, and why the nightes so short in sommers wast.
The Moores with cries cast vp their hands, so doth the Troians eke, And al that night of them the Quéene new talke began to seke.
Full oft of Priam wold she know, of Hector oft enquéeres, In what aray Auroras son came in, she gladly heres.
What horses Diomedes brought, how great Achilles was She lernid all to soone, and of long loue she bibbes (alas) And from the first ({quod} she) my gest, vouchsaue pray to tell The treasons of the Greekes, and how your towne and people fell.
And of your chaunce and trauailes all, for thus these seuen yéere About the lands and all the seas thou wandrest as here.
Aeneas at the request of Dido, declareth the destructio~ of Troy, which was after this maner.
The Greekes in the tenth yeare of their sledge, whe~ their force was quailed, and distrustinge their owne abititie: fell vnto crafts, and subtilties, and counterfaytyng a flight the night before the towne was burned: hid them selues in the Ile of Tenedos, leauyng in the Troiane fields a wodden horse of such inesteemable bignesse, that it could not be receaued in at the Citie gates, and in his wombe they enclosed the most valient souldiers of al theyr nobiliti.
The Troians perswaded partly through the subtiltie of SINON, and partly afrayde by LAOCONS punishment: pull downe part of their towne walle, and so bryng in this horse into their Castle.
But in the dead time of the night the Graetians returnyng from Tenedos entred into the citie through the same bretch whiche was made to brynge in the Horse.
SINON openeth the wombe of the Horse and letteth foorth the armed men, who immediatly spoyle all with fier, and sworde.
Whyles these thynges were doyng, Aeneas is warned in his dreame by Hector to prouide for himself by flight, and to deliuer his country Gods from the fier.
But he preferryng an honorable death, before a cowardly flight: in vayne betaketh him to armes, wherin at the first assault the Troians had the vpperhande, vntill, followyng the counsell of Choroebus, they put on Greekish armour, and so one of them slew another.
Then Priamus pallayce is besieged, and Priamus slayne by Pyrrhus, Achilles sonne.
Thus, when Aeneas had assayed all thynges in vayne, when he was now quite out of hope: betaketh the reliques to his father Anchises, and takyng him vp on his shoulders, with Ascanius his sonne, and Creusa his wife: committeth himself to flight.
The Graetians follow fast after, and in that tumult he lost his wife Creusa, vppon occasion to seeke whom, when as he wandred about all the towne: he met with her ghost, who certified him that she was dead.
He returnes agayne to his companie, whether as now were come together a great numbre of men women, ready to follow him whether so euer he would carie them.
THey whusted all, and fixt with eies ententiue did behold.
Whan Lord Aeneas where he sat from hie benche thus he told.
dolefull worke me to renew (O Quéene) thou doost constraine, To tell how Greekes the Troia~ welth, lame~table raigne
Did ouerthrow, which my self haue seen and béen apart No small thereof, but to declare the stories all: what hart Can of the Greekes or soldiour one of all Vlisses rout Refrayne to wéepe? and now the night with hie heauen goth about, And on the Skies the fallyng Starrs doo men prouoke to rest: But if such great desier to know, such longyng haue your brest Of Troy the latter toyle to here, to speake or yet to thinke For all that it my mynde abhors, and sorows make me shrinke: will begin.
Forsaken of Gods, and tyerd with warres at last, The Lords of Greekes, whan all in vayn so many yéeres had past,
Horse of tree by Pallas art most lyke a Mount they frame
With timber bourds, and for a vow to leaue they blow the fame.
There is an yle in sight of Troy and Tenedos it hight, welthy lande whyle Priams state and kyngdome stoode vpright, But now a bay, and harber bad for ships to lye at roade, To that they went, and hid them close that none was séen abroade.
Wée thought them gon, and with the wynde to Greece to haue béen sled.
Therefore all Troy for ease of labours long, abroad them spred, With open gates they ronne to sport, and Greeskih campes to sée, And places long of souldiours kept wherof they now be frée.
Here lay the men of Dolop lande, here fearce Achilles fought, Here stoode their ships, and here to trye were wont the armies stout.
Some gased at the straungy gift that there to Pallas stood, And wondred at the Horse so great: and furst for councell good, Tymetes strayght would into towne and market haue it brought, God wote if craft or whither so of Troy the fortune wrought.
But Capis and a few beside that wyser were of skill, Bad throw the Treasons of the Greekes and giftes suspected ill Into the seas, or with a fier ymade to burne outright, Or hew the ribbs and serche within what thing yhid be might.
The commons into sondry wittes diuided wer and stood, Till from the town Laocon came in hast as he were wood, And after him a number great, and ere they gan to throng He cried, wretched citezins, what rage is you among? Beleue ye gone the Greekes? or do you thinke that any giftes Of them be good? so know you wel that false Vlisses driftes? In this tree (for my lyfe) is hid of Greekes an hideous rout, Or this is but an engin made to skale our walles without:
And sodenly to slip them down and on the citie fall, Or other worse deuise ther is, take héede ye know not all.
What euer it is, fear the Greekes, and trust their gifts as small.
He said, and with a corage good his mighty speare he driues Against the side beneth his ribbes, that where it hittes it cliues.

For as vnarmed in the middes all vexed there he stoode, And with his eies on Troian men did loke with piteous moode:
What shall caitif miser do? what hope may conceiue? That neither with the Greekes dare bide, and now the Troians here, (As worthy is) my blood to shed for vengeaunce do requéere.
With mourning thus our minds gan turne, our force we left alone And bad him tel what man he was, what ment he thus to mone, What newes he had he should expres, and forth his mind to breake.

Nor would not rest til Calchas had by his vngracious wit, But what doo rehearse these thinges to shew that be not fit? If al the Greekes in one estate you hate, if it wist It is ynough: you haue me here, take vengeaunce if you list, Vlisses and Atridas twain great goods for that would spend.
Than kindled be wée more to know the circumstance and end, Not thinking of so great a craft, and Greekes deuise so fell.
All trembling on his cale he goth with fained hart to tell.

The hougy horse abrode his men in harneis pourith out, And Sinon ouer all triumphes, and fiers he throweth about With conquest wyde, and euery gate is fild with peoples armde, With thousands such as out of Greece so thicke thei neuer swarmde: The straytes in euery streate they kéepe, the waies with wepons pight, And stout in rankes they stond with stéele fast bent to death in fight: Skant doth the watche that kéepe the towres, resist with féeble might.

Than Ripheus him self adioynd, and myghty most with launce Came Iphitus vnto my side, by moonelight met by chaunce.

Vnhappy man, that what his spouse him rauing told in traunce: Wold not regard.

lusty youth of valiant hartes and stout, In vaine, if into daungers most attempting after me You minde to roonne, the state of thinges and fortune here ye sée: The temples left and seates alone, and altars quite forsake,
The Gods wherby this empier stood ar gon, you vndertake citie burnt to séeke to saue, what shall we do? but die Like men, and in the midds of armes and wepons let vs flie.
One chiefe relief to conquerd men is desperatly to trie.

Euen so through thick and thin we flang, through foes and wepons pight To doubtles death, right through the stréetes encompast al with night.
Who can the slaughters of that night with toong declare? or wh With worthy teares can tell the toyle that death men draue vnto? The citie falth that auncient long and many a yeere the crown Hath borne, and euery stréete is strowed with bodies beaten down, And heapes in euery house ther lieth, and temples all ar filde With bodies dead, and not alone the Troians poore ar kilde.
Sometime when tyrid ben their harts their manful stomacks stéeres, And down their conquerours they quell, on euery side apéeres The fearfull dréede, and wailing wide, and face of death at hand.
There furst against vs of the Greekes with men a mighty band

He said, and straight (for answere non that liked him gyuen ther was) All sodenly amids his foes him self betrapt he knewe, He shrank therwith, and stopt his tale, and foote he backward drewe, As one that vnbethought hath hapt some snake among the briers To tread, and quickly sterting backe with trembling fear retiers, Whan swolne with angry teéne he séeth his blew neck bent vpright.
So quaking whan Androgeos vs spéed, he tooke his flight.
But we pursued, and thicke with armes them all encompast round On euery side, and them affraied (and nothing knew the gound) We ouerthrew, and fortunes lucke our fyrst assay succéedes.
Now mates ({quod} he) where fortune first hath shewed relief, and where Our valiant hands our aide hath well begoon, procéede we there.
And let vs chaunge our shéeldes with Greekes, armd in Greekes aray: Let vs set on, what skilles it force or falshood enmies slay? Our enemies lo their weapons yéeldes agaynst them selfes to fight, So sayd, and on his head he puttes Androgeos helmet bright, And with his gorgebus shéeld him self he clad full gay to beare,
And on his side the Greekish sworde he comly gyrt did weare.
So Ripheus, so Dymas doth him selfe, and therwithall The youth of Troy with Greekish spoiles them deckes both great smal.
Than mixt among the Greeks wée gon, our selfes vs doth not gyde,
And many a skirmish sore that night wée blindly fought and tryde.
And many a Greeks to Hell wee sent, some other away for feare To shipboarde ran, and some to shores with coursyng here and there.
Some foule afrayed their hougy horse agayn do clime, and take Their wonted seates, and in his paunche their harbrow old they make Alas, what may mankinde preuayle whan gods him doth forsake? Behold, where haeld by heare and head from Pallas temple sure, Kyng Priams doughter drawen wée sée Cassandra virgin pure.
And vp to Heauen in vayn for helpe her glistryng eyes she cast, Her eyes: for than her tender hands with boltes were fettryd fast.
That sight Choroebus ragyng wood could not him hold to sée,
But euen among the middes he lept, with will to die, and wée
Him after sued, and thick in throngs of armes our selfs wée thurst.
There from the temples toppe aloft, with Troians weapons furst Our own men vs did whelm, wher doth most piteous slaughter rise, Our armours fals mystake, and Greekish shéeldes deceyued their eyes.
Than all the Greekes whan from them take the virgin was, for yre
By flockes on euery syde with cries inuade as wilde as fyre.
Atridas twayn, and Aiax chief, and egre in armies stout, And after them their battayles all, and youth of Dolop rout.
None otherwise than whan somtime the whirlewinds out are brast.
And sondry stormes from sondry coasts are met, and struglyng fast: Conflicts, both est, and west, and south, that woods with cracking quakes, And Neptunes fork the fomy seas from botoms wyld vp rakes.
And they also whom through the darke, that night wée chasyd had, And ouercame by chaunce before: they fyrst with corage glad Appeard in sight, and fyrst our shéeldes and armours fals eskried.
They knew, and marking by our soundes our seuerall tongs espied.
There down by heapes the numbre vs threw, Choroebus fyrst of all
And fall doth Ripheus to ground, the iustest man that was
Of Troian kind, and one that most of right and law did pas.
But god of them did otherwyse than dispose: and them besyde, Both Hipanis, and Dimas eke were lost and slain that tyde.
Their own men through them wepons threw, nor thée Panthus pure Thy vertues great, nor Phoebus crown, from death could than assure.
Yet by the flames extreme swere that all Troy brought to dust, At your decayes witnes take (if trueth protest must) neuer man ne wepon shund of Greekes, ne from you swarued, If gods will were: my death sought, and sure my hand deserued.
Than out wée brake, both Iphitus and I, and Pelias kind,
The one for age, the other Vlisses wound made come behind.
And by the cries to Priams court our king forth with enclind.
There now the battaile great was vp, as if no place els where Had felt of warre, as die did none through all the towne but there.
So ragyng Mars and Greekes vp runne to houses toppes wée sée, And postes puld downe and gates vp broake beset, that none should flée.
The walles with scalyng ladders layde, and stulps of scaffolds hie, And vp by stayres they clyme, and backe they driue the dartes that flie With shéeldes: and battilmentes aboue in handes they catche and hold.
Agaynst them Troians down the towres and tops of houses rold, And rafters vp they reaue, and after all attemptes, at last Those tooles for shift at death extreame, to fend them selfs they cast.
The golden beames, their auncient fathers frames of comely sight They tomblid down, some other alow with wepons pointed bright At gates and euery dore doth warde, and thick in rancks they stand.
Anon the pallais of our king to helpe wée tooke in hand, Our aid to put, and adde relief to men with labours spent.

Wherthrough somtime whan yet in state their kingdoms did abide, Full oft Andromache was woont her self alone to pas Vnto the king and Quéene her father and mother in law that was.
And yong Astianax her childe his graunsier to she brought.
Therthrough skope, and vp the tops of houses hie past, Where down the sely Troians darts in vaine for fainting cast.
towre that stéepe vpright did stand and hie to skies vp reard
Aboue the roofes from whens all Troy full broad in sight appeard, And whens the ships and campes of Greekes tentes in times of warrs Men wonted were to vew, that towre with ginnes and mighty barrs Wée vnderheaued, and where the ioyntes and timber beames it bound, Beneth together at ones wée lift, at last it lose from ground Wée shogd, and with the shog for heft, with ratling noyse and fall Down ouer along the Greekes it light, and far and wide withall Great slaughter makes, but other vp steps for them, nor stones this while Nor kinds of wepons cease thereon.
Before the porch all ramping first at thentry dore doth stand
Duke Pyrrhus in his brasen harneis bright with burnisht brand.
And glistring like a serpent shines whom poysonid wéedes hath fild.
That lurking long hath vnder ground in winter cold ben hild.
And now his cote of cast all fresh with youth renewd and pride Vpright his head doth hold, and swift with wallowing back doth glide Bresthigh against the sunne, and spits with toongs threforked fier.
And hugy Periphas with him, with him Achilles squier Antomedon, his maisters stéedes that wonted was to chace, Than all the youth of Scyrie land ensues, and to the place They enter thick, and fiers about on houses hie they flynge.
Him selfe in hand among the chéef a twyble great doth bryng.
And therwithall he through the gates and doores with dints doth driue, And downe the brasen postes doth pull and timber plancks doth cliue.
And now the barres a sonder brast, and ioystes vp hewed doth fall, An entry broad, and wyndow wide, is made now through the wall.
There houses far within appeares and hals are layd in light, Aperes kyng Priams parlours great that auncient kyngs had dight.
And harneyst men they see to stand at thentry doores to fight.
But the inner lodgyngs all with noyse and wofull waylyng soundes,
With bounsyng thick and larums lowd the buildyngs all rebounds.
And howlyng women shoutes, and cries the golden starres doo smite.
Than wandryng here there with dréed through chambers wide affright The mothers clippe their contrey postes, and kissyng hold with might.
But Pirrhus with his fathers force on preaseth, neither walles Nor kéepers him therout can hold, with rammes and engins falles The portall postes and thresholds vp are throwen and doores of halles, Than forceing foorth they shooue, and through thei push, down they kil Them first that méets, and euery floore with souldiours fast they fil,
Not half so ferce the fomy flood whose rampier banks are torne With rage outronnes, whan diches thwart and piers are ouerborne With waues, and forth on feelds it fals, and waltring down the vales And houses down it beares withall, and heardes of beastes it hales.
Neptolemus my self saw, with slaughters wood to rage, And brethren twayn Atridas ferce, their furies non could swage.
Quéene Hecuba and her hundred doughter lawes, and Priam there With blood saw defyle the fiers, him selfe to god did rere.
And fyfty paramours he had, and childrens yssewe, told No nomber lesse: the stately spoyles and postes full proude of gold Abroad are thrown, and what the fier doth leaue the Greekes doth hold The fatall end of Priam now perhaps you will requier.
Whan he the citie taken saw and houses tops on fier, And buildings broke, and rounde about so thicke his foes to rage: His harneis on his shulders (long onworn tyll than) for age All quaking, on (good man) he putts, to purpose smal, and than His sword him gyrt, and into death and enmies thick he ran.
Amids the court right vnderneth the naked skyes in sight, And altar huge of sise there stoode, and by the same vpright An auncient Laurell trée did grow, that wyde abroad was shed, And it, and all the caruyd gods with broad shade ouerspred.
There Hecuba and her doughters al (pore soules) at the altars side In heapes together affrayd them drew, like doues whan doth betide Some storme them headlong driue, and clipping fast their gods thei hold.
But whan she Priam thus beclad in armes of youth so bold Espied: what minde alas ({quod} she) wofull husband you In harneis dight: and whither away with wepons run ye now? Not men nor wepons vs can saue: this time doth are to beare No such defence, no not if Hector myne now present were.
Stand here by me, thys altar vs from slaughters all shall shelde, Or dye together at ones wée shall.
So said she, and gan to welde Him aged man, and in the sacred seat hym set, and helde.
Behold where skapyng from the stroke of Pirrhus fers in sight Polites, one of Priams sonnes, through foes and wepons pight, Through galeries along doth runne, and wide about him spies Sore wounded than, but Pirrhus after hym sues with burning eyes In chase, and now welnere in hand him caught and held with spere, Tyll right before his parents sight be came, than feld him there
To death, and with his gushyng blood his life outright he shed.
There Priamus, though now for wo that tyme he halfe was dead, Hym self could not refrayn, nor yet his voyce nor anger hold.
But, onto the (o wretche) he cried, for this despite so bold, The gods (if any iustice dwels in heauen or ryght regard) Do yeeld thée worthy thanks, and thée do pay thy due reward, That here within my sight my son hast slayn with slaughter vyle, And not ashamd with lothsome death his fathers face to fyle.
Not so did he (whom falslye thou beliest to be thy sier) Achilles with his enmy Priam deale, but my desier Whan Hectors corps to tombe he gaue for gold, did entertayn With truth and right, and to my realme restorde me safe again.
So spake, and therwithall his dart with féeble force he threwe.
Which sounding on his brasen harneis hoarce, it backward flew, And on his targat side it hit, where dyntlesse down it hyng.
Than Pirrhus said, thou shalt go now erfore and tidings bryng
Neptolemus his bastard is, not I, say this in hell.
Now die, and (as he spake that word) from the altar self he drewe Him trembling ther, and déepe him through his sonnes blood did embrue.
And with his left hand wrapt his locks, with right hand through his side His glistring sworde outdrawen, he did hard to the hiltes to glyde.
This ende had Priams destnies al, this chaunce him fortune sent Whan he the fier in Troy had séen, his walles and castels rent.
That somtime ouer peoples proud, and lands had reingd with fame Of Asia the emprour great, now short on shore he lieth with shame His head besides his shulders layd, his corps no more of name.
Than fyrst the cruell fear me caught, and sore my sprites appalde, And on my father déere thought, his face to mynd calde: Whan slayne with grisly wound our kyng, him like of age in sight Lay gasping dead, and of my wife Creusa bethought the plight.
Alone, forsake, my house dispoyld, my childe what chaunce had take lokyd, and about me vewd what strength might me make: All men had me forsake for paynes, and downe their bodies drewe To ground they leapt, and some for woo them selfs in fiers they threwe.
And now alone was left but I, whan Vestas temple staier To kéepe, and secréetly to lurke all couching close in chaier
Where euer went, the waies past, all thing was set in sight.
She fearing her the Troians wrath, for Troy destroid to wreke Greekes turmentes, and her husbands force whose wedlock shée did breke The plage of Troy, and of her contrey monster most vntame: There sat she with her hatyd head, by the altars hid for shame.
Straight in my brest felt a fier, déepe wrath my hart did straine My contreis fall to wreke, and bring that cursid wretche to payne.
What shall she? into her contrey soyle of Sparta, and hie Micene? All saufe shall she returne? and there on Troy triumphe as Quéene? Her husband, children, cuntrey, kinne, her house, her parents old With Troian wifes and Troian lordes, her slaues, shal she beholde? Was Priam slaine with sworde for this? Troy burnt with fier so wood, Is it herefore that Dardan strondes so oft haue swet with blood? Not so: for though it be no prayse on woman kynde to wreke, And honour none there lieth in this, nor name for men to speke: Yet quenche shall this poyson here, and due desertes to dight.
Men shall commend my zeal, and eas my mynd shall outright.
This moche for al my peoples bones, and contrey flames to quite.
These thinges within my self tost, and fierce with force ran?
Whan to my face my mother great, so brym no time till than Appearing shewed her self in sight, all shining pure by night.
Right goddesse like, with glory such as heauens beholdes her bright.
So great with maiesty she stood, and me (by right hand take) She staied, and redde as rose with mouth these words to me she spake.
My son, what sore outrage so wilde thy wrathful minde vp stéeres? Why fretst thou? or where away thy care from vs withdrawn apéeres? Not first vnto thy father séest? whom feeble in all this wo Thou hast forsake? nor if thy wife doth liue thou knowest, or no, Nor yong Ascanius thy childe? whom thronges of Greekes about Doth swarming runne, and were not my relief, withouten doubt By this time flames had vp deuourd, or swordes of enmies kylde.
It is not Helens face of Greece this town (my son) hath spilde, Nor Paris is to blame for this: but gods with grace onkynde, This welth hath ouerthrown, and Troy from top to ground outwynd.
Behold, (for now away the cloud and dymme fog will take That ouer mortall eies doth hang, and blind thy sight doth make) Thou to thy parents heast take héede (dread not) my minde obey.
In yonder place where stones from stones, a bildings huge to swey
Thou séest, and mixt with dust and smoke thick streames of réekings rise: Himself the God Neptune that side doth turne in wonders wyse With forck thretinde the walles vprootes, foundations al to shakes, And quyte from vnder soil the town with groundworkes all vp rakes.
On yonder side with furies most dame Iuno fiercely standes, The gates she kéepes, and from their ships the Greekes her frendly ba~des In armour gyrt she calls.
Lo there againe where Pallas sittes on fortes and castle towres,
With Gorgons eies in lightning cloudes inclosid grim she loures.
The father god him self to Greekes their mightes and courage steres Him selfe against the Troian blood, both gods and armour reres.
Betake thée to thy flight (my son) thy labours end procure, will thée neuer faile, but thée to resting place assure.
Thus said she, and through the dark night shade her self she drew from sight.
Appeares the grisly faces than, Troys enmies vgly dight The mighty powers of Gods.
Than verily right broad saw whole Ilion castles sinke In fiers, and vpsodown all Troy from botom turne to brinke.
And like as on the mountayn top, some auncient oke to fall The plowmen with their axes strong do striue, and twibles tall To grubbe, and round about hath hewd: it thretning from aboue Doth nodde, and with the braunches wide al trembling bendes to moue.
Till ouercome with strokes at last, all cracking down to fall, One wound it ouerthrowes, and ground it drawes and rockes with all.
Than down went as god me led through flames and foes to trie.
All weapons as pas, giue place, and flames away do flye.
But whan into my fathers mantion house came, and there
Him first thought to shift, and vp the mountains next to bere:
My father after Troy destroied no longer life desiers, Nor outlawe wold he non become.
you whose youth requiers To liue, and blood in lust vpholds ({quod} he) your lymmes to wéelde Take you your flight.
For as for me, if Gods aboue would life haue had me led, This place they would haue kept me: ynough to much, and ouerhed Of slaughters haue wée séen, our citie brent wée do suruiue.
Go fourth, let me remain (I pray) for me do you not striue.
Mine own hand shall my death obtein, my foe will rue my plight, My corps he can but spoyle, for of a graue the losse is light,
This many a yere to Gods abhord vnweldy life finde,
Synce time whan me the father of Gods and king of all mankynd Beblasted with his lightning wynd, and fiers on me did cast.
Thus spake he, and in his purpose still he fixt remainyd fast.
We therageinst with streaming teares, my wife also she stood, Ascanius, and our houshold all, we praied that in that mood All things with him good father turne he nold, nor slaughter make Outright of all, nor vs to death destnies fell betake.
He still denyed, stif his mind nor purpose wolde forsake.
Agayne to wepons fourth flewe, death most miser call: For counsel what? or what reliefe, or fortune nowe can fall? Thynke you that one foote from hence, you father left behynde Can pas? or may there such a sinne escape your mouth vnkynde? If nothing of so great a towne to leaue the Gods be bent: And fixt in mynde you haue decreed Troys ruynes to augment With losse of you yours, agreed, at this dore death doth stand, And here anon from Priams blood comth Pyrrhus hote at hand, That chyldern in theyr fathers sight, father on the altar killes.
For this mighty mother myne through fiers and foes billes Haue you me kept til nowe for this? that in my parlour flores Myne enmyes must see to kyll my folkes within my dores? Ascanius my chylde? my wife Creusa? my father olde? All sprauling slayne with blood in blood embrued shall beholde? Weapons seruaunts, bring me wepons, our last hour doth vs cal, And yelde me among the Greekes to fight, let me to battails fall Afresh, for neuer shall wée die this day vnuenged all.
Than me with sword again girt, my left arme vnder shéeld put, and out at dores ran with rage to fight in féelde.
Behold at thentry gate my wife, embracing both my féete,
Doth knéele, and vp to me she holdes my childe Ascanius swéete.
If toward death thou goest, take vs with thée to chaunces all, If socour ought or hope thou findst in armes, than first of all Defend this house, to whome forsakst thy childe Iule alas? To whom thy father leauest, and me sometime thy wife that was? Thus wailing al our house she filde, thus cried she through the halles.
Whan sodenly (right woonder great to tell) a monster falles.
For euen betwéene our hands and right before our face in sight,
And harmeles lickes his lockes, and soft about his temples féede, We straight his burning hear ga~ shake, all trembling dead for dréede And waters on the sacred fiers to quenche anon wée shéede.
But than my father Anchises glad, to heauen doth his eies With handes vpthrown against the starres, and voice exalted cries.
Almighty Ioue (if mans respect or praiers dost regard) Behold vs now this ones, and (if our déedes deserue rewarde) From hensforth father helpe vs send, and blesse this grace with more.
Skant from his mouth the word was past, whan skies aloft to rore Begin, and thonder light was thrown, and down from heauen by shade streaming star descends, and long with great light makes a glade.
Wée looking, brim behold it might, and ouer our house it slipps,
And forth to Ida woods it went, there down it self it dipps, Vs pointing out the waye to flée, than straking light along Doth shine, and broad about it smokes with sent of sulphur strong.
And prayeth his gods, and worship to that blessyd starre he yelds.
Now now no more let, leade where ye lyst, will not swarue.
This token yet is yours: yet Troy in your regard remaynes.
yeld me son, nor further stay with thée to take all paynes.
So spake he, and now about our walles the fiers approching sounds At hand, and nere and nere the flames with feruent rage redounds, Dere father now therfore your self set on my necke to beare, My shulders shall you lift, this labour me shall nothing deare, What euer chaunce betides, one daunger both wée must abyde, In saufty both a lyke wée shalbe sure, and by my syde
My child Iule shall go, my wife shall trace aloof behind.
You seruantes what say take héede, imprint it well in mind.
There is a hill whan out the town ye come, and temple old Of Ceres long vnvsid, there beside ye shall behold An auncient Cipers trée to grow, that for religions sake Our fathers there did set, and there long time did honor make.
In that place out of diuers waies wée all shall séeke to méete.
You father take your contrey gods in hand, our comfort swéete.
For me, that from the battailes fresh am come and slaughters new, may not them for sinne presume to touche, tyll waters dew With floods hath washt me pure.
Thus said I, and on my shulders bread and thwart my necke kest weede, and in a lions skinne full read my self drest.
And vnder burden fast sled, my child my right hand kept Iule, and after me, with pace vnlyke in length, he stept.
My wife ensued, through lanes and crokes and darknes most we past.
And me, that late no shoutes, nor cries, nor noyse, nor wepons cast
nor clusters great of Greeks in throngs agast could make:
Now euery wind and puffe doth moue, at euery sound quake, Not for my self, but for my mate, and for my burdens sake.
And now against the gates came, which out of daunger found, thought well escapid had, whan sodenly the sound Of féete wée heare to tread, and men full thicke my father skand.
Flée flée my son (he cried) lo here they come, lo here at hand, Their harneis bright apeares, and glystring sheeldes sée to shyne.
There what it was not, some chaunce or God (no frend of myne) Amasyd than my wit, for while through thicke and thinne pas, And from the accustomd wayes draw to seke to skape (alas) My wife from me most wofull man Creusa belouyd best, (Remaine she did, or lost her way, or sat her down to rest,
Onknowen it is) but after that in vayne her all wée fought.
Nor of her losse knew, nor backe lokid or bethought: Till onto Ceres temple old and auncient seate, ech one Was come, and there togithers met wée all, but she alone Did lacke, and there her frends and child and husband did begyle.
What man or god (for anger mad) did not curse that while? Or what in all that town vpturnd saw so fore befall? My father and my child Iule and Troian gods withall Onto my men tooke, and in a crokyd vale them hidde, Agayn vnto the citie gyrt in glystring armes yede, All chaunces there agayn to trie my minde fixed fast, All Troy for her again to seke, my lyfe to daungers cast.
First back vuto the walles and gate turne, and thentry blynd Where out came sought, and steppes of féete marke behynd, Where night to sée could serue, and fiers that glistring shines about.
Great feare on euery side sée, the silence makes me doubt, My house at home, if haply there, if haply there she héelde.
went to looke, the Greekes were in, and houses all they fylde.
Deuouring fier doth all consume, from house to house it flies.
The wynd encreasith flames, and vp the rage to heauen doth ryse.
To Priams court turne, and to the castle view cast.
The temples great were spoylde, and Iunos holy dores were brast.
Amids the flore the kéepers stoode, the chief of capteines stout, Both Phenix and Vlisses false with them their trayn about The praie did kéepe, and Greekes to them the Troian riches brought, That from the fiers on euery syde was raught: all temples sought And tables from the gods were take, and basons great of gold, And precious plate and robes of kyngly state, and treasours old, And captiue childern stoode, and tremblyng wifes in long aray Were stowed about and wept.
ventred eke my voyce to lift, and through the glimsing night The wayes with cries fyld, and Creusas name fulloud shright.
In vain cald and cald, and oft again and yet cried.
Thus séeking long with endles pain and rage, all places tryed.
At last (with woful lucke) her sprite and Creusas ghost (alas)
Before myne eyes saw to stand, more great than wonted was.
stoinid, and my heare vpstood, my mouth for feare was fast.
She spake also, and thus fro me my cares she gan to cast.
What mean you thus your raging mind with labours sore to moue husband swéete? these things without the powers of gods aboue Hath not betide: me now from hence to leade, or by your side You shall sée neuer more, he doth resist that heauens doth gyde.
Long pilgrimage you haue to pas, huge féelde of seas to eare.
Onto Hesperia land you shall ariue do you not feare, Where Tyber flood through fertill soyle of men doth softly slyde.
There substaunce great, and kingdom strong, and Quéene to wife besyde
You shall enioy, for me thy Creusa deare do wéepe no more.
To Mirmidons nor Dolop land shall not now be bore, Nor to the ladies proud of Greece shall be seruant séen: Of Dardan and of goddesse Venus doughter law.
But me the mighty mother of goddes wil not from hence to moue.
And now fare wel, and of our childe, for both, kéepe thou the loue.
Thus whan she said, wéeping there, and more things wold haue spoke She left me, and with the wind she went as thinne from sight as smoke, Thrée times about her necke sought mine armes to set, and thrise In vaine her likenes fast held, for through my hands she flies Like wauering wind, or lyke to dreames that men ful swift espies Than to my company at last whan night was gon drewe.
And there a multitude of menfull huge and numbre newe found, with maruell much, both men and women yong and old rable great exyld, and piteouse commons to behold From euery coast were come, and with their goods and harts assent, What lond or sea so euer would them leade they were content.
And now from vp the mountayn tops the dawning star doth ryse, And brings again the day, the Greekes (as best they could deuise) The gates possest and held, all hope and helpe was gone: at last yelded, and my father tooke, and vp the hill past.
When Troy was vtterly subuerted, Aeneas hauyng gathered together his companie in flight, that remayned after the great fier and slaughter, and hauynge obtayned of Atander a fleete of twentie sayle: arriueth fyrst in Thracia.
Wheras, when he began to build a citie, beynge terrefied through the prodigious tokens of Polydorus that was slayne by Polymnestor: departeth to Delos, and there takyng counsell of the Oracle of Apollo, and beynge aduertised that he must go to yt land from whence his auncetours first descended: through ye false interpretation of Anchises his father, arriued in Creta where he began also to lay the foundations of a Citie.
And beyng there afflicted with a great plague of pestilence: was warned by his houshold Godds in his sleape, that he should leaue Creta, and goe to Italy.
In which iorney, by a tempest he was driuen to ye Ilandes Strophades, and there much troubled by the Harpyes, and shortly after arryuyng at Actium: made playes in the honour of Apollo.
From thence he sayled by Corcyra into Epyrus, wheras Helenus ye sonne of Priamus raygned, that maried Andromache after the death of Pyrrhus.
By whom he was courteously entertayned, and admonished by him of the perils which he should substayne both by sea and land.
From thence he sayleth to Tarentum, and passyng alonge by the first shoare of Italy; arriueth on that side that lieth neare to the Mounte Aetna, and there he receaueth Achaemenides who was left in the Cyclops den by Vlisses, anon from thence he hoyseth sayle as Helenus commaunded, and passeth by Scylla and Carybdis.
And coastyng along the shoare of Scycilye taketh lance at Drepanus, where Anchises partly weakened by age, and partly by trauayle ended his life.
From thence saylyng towards Italy: was driuen into Affrike by a tempestuous weather raysed by Aelous, as is expressed in the first booke.
WHan Asia state was ouerthrowen, and Priams kingdome stout Al gitles by the power of gods aboue was rooted out, And down the fortresse proude was falne that Glorious Ilion hyght, And flat on ground all Neptunes Troy lay smoking bread in sight:
To diuers londes and diuers coasts, like outlawd men, compelde By tokens of the Gods wée were, to séeke from thence expeld.
And vnderneath Antander hill, and mountes of Ida name, In Phrigy lond our nauy great wée wrought and vp did frame.
Vncertein wherupon to stay, where destnies vs doth gyde, And power of men assembleth fast.
Scant sommer first wée spied: Whan sayles onto the wyndes to set my father Anchises cries.
Than partyng from my contrey shores and hauens with wéepyng cies, The féelds where Troy did stand leaue, fourth outlaw fare right My son my mates fréends wt me through déepe seas tooke their flight My sayntes my cuntrey Gods also that ar full great of might.
There lieth a land far loof at seas, where Mars is lorde, and wheare
The largy féeldes and fertill soyle me Thracia cald, doth eare.
An auncient stay to Troy, and like in fayth and fréendship old Whyle fortune was.
To that went, and on the crooked shore Foundations first of walls layd with destnies lucke full sore.
And of my name theyr name shoope, and Aeneads them call.
Vnto the mother of Gods that time, and heauenly persons all Great sacrifice made, for lucke my woorkes to prosper new, And to the kyng of heauen himself a bright bull downe slew.
banke by chaunce by me there stoode, where bright as horne of hew
Witi, roddes vpright and braunches thicke a Myrtill bushe there grew.
drew me neare, and from the ground the gréene brush vp pull, Myne altars to adorne therwith with bows and shadowes full.
dréedfull sight and monster (maruell great to tell) found, For from the twig that fyrst brake and rootes rent from ground, The blacke blood out doth breake, and downe with tricklyng drops it trils Defilyng foule the soyl, with that for feare my body chilles.
My limmes do quake, my blood for dread doth shrinke with frosty colde.
Another braunche agayne to plucke with force waxed bolde, The cause therof to learne, and sée what thyng therunder lay.
Great thynges in mynde kest, and straight the féeld Numphes adore, And Mars the father great that prince is of that lond and shore, Good fortune me to send, and turne that sight to good they shuld.
But whan the thyrd time twigs to take with greater might puld, And knées agaynst the sand set with force, what shall do?
Speake out, or silence keepe? a piteous waylyng vs vnto Was heard from out the hill, and voyce thus gronyng spake me to.
Why doost thou thus Aeneas me most wofull myser teare?
Abstayne my graue to file, from sinne thy gentill hands forbeare.
am to thee no straunger borne, nor thus deserue to speede, This blood thou seest from out this stub ywis doth not procéede.
Flee, flee (alas) this cursid shore, flee from this gréedy land, For am Polidore, in this place slayne was with hand, This bush of dartes is growne, sharp with pricks on me they stand.
Than more with doubt and dreade opprest my mynde fro me was past stoynid, and my hear vpstert, my mouth for fear was fast.
This Polidore sometime, with gold of weight full huge to tell, His father Priam king (good man) by stelth had sent to dwell Vnto the king of Thrace, whan first to Troy he gan mistrust,
Whan he the citie sieged saw, that néedes defend he must.
But he whan Troy decay began and fortune fourth was past: The stronger part he tooke, and Agamemnon ayding fast) All truth he brake, and Polidore of chops, and than the gold By force into his hands he caught, and held.
What can be told? Or what is it that hunger swéete of gold doth not constrain Men mortall to attempt? whan fear my bones forsooke again: Vnto the peoples lordes went, and first vnto my fier, The monsters of the Gods shew, their councels requier.
All they with one assent do bid that cursed lond forsake.
To leaue that hostrie vile, and ships to wyndes at south betake.
Anon therfore to Polidore a herse wée gan prepare, And huge in heyght his tombe wée reare, all altars hangid are
With wéedes of mourning hewes, and Cipres trées and black deuise, And Troian wiues about with hear vnfold as is their gise.
Great fomy boolles of milke wée threw luke warm on him to fall, And holy blood in basons brought wée poure, and last of all Wée shright, and on his soul our last with great cries out wée call.
Than whan the seas wee see to trust and wind with pipling sweete Is out at sowth, and to the seas to saill doth call the fleete: My mates their ships set fourth, and shores with men they mustred al,
To seas wee flee, and as wee flee, both townes and hills do fall.
There is a lond in mid sea set whom Neptune deere doth loue, And mother of the mermaides eke, that lond sometime did houe
In floodes, and to and fro did stray, till Phoebus it did bynd With landes about, and fixt it fast, and bad defie the wynd, With Giarus and Miconce (twoo countreys) strongly stayed.
Whan in wée came, our weary ships in hauen at rest wée layed.
And went to wurship Phoebus town, and giftes with vs wée beare.
King Anius, king ofmen and Phoebus préest against vs there,
His head with holy labels layde and crowne of laurell gréene Came out, and welcome bad his fréend Anchises long vnséen.
Than hand in hand wée set, and lodging tooke in houses hie.
wurship eke the temple there that to that God spie
Gyue walls to weary men and town from whence may non expell.
Haue mercy vpon our blood and saue of Troy this last remaine, The leauinges of Achilles wild and Greekes abiectes vnstayne.
Who shall vs leade? or where apoint our place it may thée please? Our rest to take, giue token God, enspier our hartes with ease.
Scant this said, whan trembling fast with sodein shewe to shooue The Laurel trées gan quake, and dores, and thresholdes all do mooue.
The mount therwith doth bend, and vp the gates with roring brekes Adown to ground all flat wée fall, and strait a voice there spekes.
Ye Troians tough, the ground that you first bare from parents bold: The same shall you receiue again, seeke out your grandame old.
For there Aeneas house shall stand, whom contreis all shall dréede.
And childerns childe and al their ligne that of them shall procéede.
And what those walls shuld be wée scan, and councel great wée take: What place it is that Phoebus bids to séeke, and where to finde, My father than the stories old of auncient men to mynde Doth call, and than, you lordes ({quod} he) lay now to me your eare,
for now of me your great hope shal you leare.
Candy from hence in myd sea lieth, Ioues ylond great it is.
Where Ida mount doth stand, and where fyrst sprang our stock er this.
Ahundred mighty townes they kéepe, most fruteful soyl to till: From whence our auncient grandsir great (if true report skil) Kinge Teucrus issued fyrst, and on the coast of Rhoeta hyt.
And there his kingdome first began, Troy was not vp as yet,
Nor Ilion toures did stand, but there in lowe vales did they dwel.
And Coribantes beat their brasse the moone from clips to cure.
From thence wée haue that seruice time wée kepe with silence pure, For Lions in that ladies chare their yokes to draw do beare, Come on therfore, and where the Gods do call, let vs go there.
Please wée the windes, and fourth to Candi kingdomes let vs wend, The course is not so long (if Ioue vs lucke vouchsaue to send) Our ships on Candi shore to stand the third day shall wée sée, So speaking, on his altars there due honours kill did he, bull to thée Neptune first, a bull to Phoebus bright, black beast to the winter storme, to western flaws a whyte.
There flieth a fame that of his fathers kingdoms quite for sake, Idomeneus duke therof expelde his flight hath take.
And all the coast of Candi lieth wyde open for their foes, Vnfenced, and the townes of people voyd, so rumour goes.
Anon therfore our hauens wée left, and through the seas wée flie, By gréene Donisa, and Naron hills where men to Bacchus crie.
Olearon, and Paron white as snowe, and skattrid wyde Of Cicladas we compas lands, that rough seas makes to ride.
The mariners their shoutes vp set, eche man his mate doth bold, To Candi let vs chéerely fare, to séeke our gransirs old.
mery coole of winde them fast pursueth, and fourth doth driue, And at the length on Candi coast our ships wée do arriue.
My town therfore (with great desier) and walls gynne to frame,
And Pergam the citie call, right glad they take that name,
courage them that lond to loue, and towres and temples byld, And now welneare our ships vp set, drie lond our nauy hyld, With weddings and with tillage new the youth them selues applies, And houses eke and lawes gaue: whan sodenly doth rise Among them (foule) a plage, and piteous murreyn to be thought, The skies corrupted were, that trées and corne destroied to nought, And limmes of men consuming rottes, such yere of death them deares That swéete life of thei leaue, or long their gréeuous wo them weares.
The Dog starre vp doth rise, the soyle for heat of sonne doth frie,
That grayn and grasse vp dries, and féelds of food doth men denie.
Agayn to Phoebus holy seat, yet backe agayne our way Through seas my father bids vs turne, and Phoebus mercy pray, What end of wo to wery men he puttes, and how from payne
Our selfs wée may relieue, and where from thens to turn agayne.
Than was it night, and on the ground all creatures layd a sleepe, The gods of Phrigy lond, whom with me full deare did keepe, Whom from the mids of burning Troy with me brought in flight Before myne eyes (as dreame dyd) saw to stand vpright, All shyning in their glory bryght behold might them cleere, The way that through my window than the ful mone did appeere, They spake also, and thus from me they lighten gan my cheere.
The thing that of Apollo now to know you do entend, He speakes it here, and vs to thee with glad will doth he send.
Wee from the flames of Troy with thee thyne army came to gyde.
Wée vnder thee with nauy great the salt seas broad haue tried.
Wée be the same that to the starres thy ligne shall lift with pride, And empier great wee shall thee geue, and citie great to reare, For mighty men make mighty walles, long flight do thou not feare, Chaunge yet thy place, not here it is that Phoebus bids thee byde, It is not here to Candy shore Apollo thee dyd guyde.
There is a place the Greekes by name Hesperia do call.
An auncient lond and feirce in warre, and fruteful soyle withall.
Now Italy men saith is cald, so, of the captains name.
There be our dwelling seats from thens king Dardan self was born, And Iaseus the prince from whom our ligne descends beforn.
Arise, go to, and tell this thyng onto thy father deare, Seke out Italia land, the shores of Corit coast enqueare, Be bolde, procéede for Ioue doth thee from Candy contreis take.
Astoined with this was made whan gods to me so spake.
For slomber was it not (me thought) but plain their faces bright, And folded hear bewrapt saw, and knew them sure by sight.
With cold swete all my body than did ronne, and therwithall From out my bed leapt, and straight on knees there down fall.
By hands to heauen held, and praied, and gifts and offrings pure, In fiers to them threw, and all my duty don with cure: Anchises asserteyn than, and him declare the caas.
Anone the doubtfull ligne he knew, how he begylid was,
Than said he thus, son whom Troy by destnies tough doth make, Cassandra alone, of al mankind, these things to me did tell, These chaunces of our stocke she sang, now remembre well.
Of Italy full oft she spake, oft of Hesperia shore.
But who could euer thinke that time, or this beleeue before? That Troians to Hesperia land shuld come to dwell at last? Of prophecies, or who that time of madde Cassandra past? To Phoebus let vs yéeld, and after warning take the best.
So spake he, and anon with ioy all wée obeyed him prest.
That seat also wée than forsake, and (few folke left behinde) With beames through hugy seas wée cut, and sayles set vp for winde.
Whan to the déepe our ships were come, and now on neither site Appéeres no land, but seas and skies about vs broad are spied:
shoure aboue my head there stood all dusky blacke with blew,
Both night and storme it brought, and rough the waters dark their hew.
Straight all the seas with winds are tost, and mighty surges rise, And through the déepes wée to and fro be thrown in wonders wise.
The cloudes inclosid haue the day: dimme night hath hid the heauen: And from the skies the lightning fiers do flashe with grisly steauen.
From out our course wée be disperst, and blind in waues wée stray, Eke he him self our maister there can skant the night from day Discerne he sayth so trobleth him the tempest Palinure, Nor in the waters wyld his way to hold he can be sure.
Thrée dayes therfore vncerten where wée go, withouten sunne In seas wée wander wide, and three nights like in darke wee runne Withouten starre: the fourth day land to rise wee spied at last, And mountaines farre in sight are séen, and smoke do séeme to cast.
Our sailes forthwith do fal, and vp with ores, and than anon The mariners do sweepe the seas, and through the fome they gon.
At Strophades, for so their names in Greekish toong doth hight.
Celeno foule mishapen bird, and Harpies more right fell: Since Phines house from them was shut, their former fare thei fled.
Nor from the pit of hel vp start the wreke of god so wilde.
Lyke foules with maidens face thei ben, their paunches wyde defilde With garbage great, their hooked pawes thei sprede, and euer pale With hungry lookes.
Whan there we came, and first in hauen wée entred, lo wée see The heardes of beast full far to féede on euery syde ful frée,
And goates also to grase, and kéeper none there was to vewe: Our wepons on them fast wée lay, and down them thicke we slew.
And banks vpon the shore wée make, and gods to part wée call, And Ioue him self to blesse the pray, and fast to meate wée fall.
But sodenly from downe the hylls with grisly fall to sight, The Harpies come, and beating wings with great noys out they shright, And at our meate they snatch, and with their clawes they al defile, And feareful cries also they cast, and sent of sauour vile.
Againe into a priuie place where rocks and caues doth hide, With trées and shadowes compast darke our tables wée prouide.
And altars vp again we make, and fiers on them we tinde.
Againe from out a diuers coast, from holes and lurkings blind, The preas with croked pawes are out, and sounding foule they flie, Polluting with their filthy mouthes our meate, and than crie: That al men weapons take, and with that vgly nacion fight.
They did as them bad forthwith, and in the grasse from sight Their swords by them they laid, and couching close their shéelds thei hide.
Than whan the third time from the cliues with noise againe they glide: Misenus from aloft with brasen trompet fets a sound.
My mates inuade them than, and felt the fight but newly found.
And on the filthy birdes they beat, that wild sea rocks do bréede, But fethers none do from them fal, nor wound for stroke doth bléede, Nor force of weapons hurt them can, their backs and wings no speare Can perce, but fast away they flie, full hie from sight, and there The pray to vs half maunched, and begnawn ful foule they leaue.
But one of them, Celeno, than her self on rocks doth heaue
Vnhappy tale to tell, and thus her lothsome voyce she brake.
And is it war ({quod} she) with vs? warre Troians do you make? And for our cattell slaine, do you with vs to bataile bend Pore Harpies, and our kingdom take from vs that nought offend? Take this with you therfore, and wel my words imprint in mind.
That God him self to Phoebus said, and by Phoebus find, That am the chief of furies all, and thus to you tell: To Itali your course you take, whan wind shall serue you, wel: In Itali ariue you shall, and hauen possesse you there, But power you shal not haue your town nor walls therof to rere Till famine for your trespas here, and for our cattell slaine,
Shal pinche you so, that tables vp to eat you shalbe faine.
She said, and into woods therwith ful fast she tooke her flight.
But than my mates, their blood for cold did shrinke, and sore affright: Their corage down doth fal, and now no wepons more they welde, But vowes and praiers make, and down for peas they knéele in felde.
If goddesses perchaunce they be, or furies, or of seas Some boistous birdes, what euer it is, ful fain thei wold them pleas.
But than my father Anchises vp his hands to heauen on hye Doth hold, and to the Gods aboue with honours great doth crye.
Gods defend this feare, Gods from this chaunce vs preserue, God saue good men from harme, than from that shore he bids to swarue, And cables vp to wind, and sailes vp hoys with halsers hie.
The northen wind vs blows, and fast through fominge seas we flie.
Wher wind doth driue, and wher our master calls our course to kéepe.
Dulichium, and Samey londs, and cragges of Nerite hye, Of Ithaca we flée the rocks, and (as wée passe them by) The kingdom of Laertes there, syr false Vlisses nurse, That land aloof wée leaue, and it with good cause oft we curse.
Anon the point Leucates cald, and cloudy tops of hyll Apéeres Apollos point, and coast that shipmen trust full yll.
All wearye there wee land, and there the citie smal we vew.
Our ankers out we layd on land, and ships to shore we drew.
Therfore, to main land whan we came long lokyd for at last, Processions great to Ioue we make, and altars kyndle fast, And on the shore in Troian gise our games and plaies we point, Some wrastling for disport with naked limmes in oyl anoint, And maistries with them selfes thei trie, great ioye they make to se: That through so many townes of Greekes, and foes they skaped be.
This while the sonne with compas wide the great yeare brings about, And winter winds and northen frosts rough seas doth make nien cout.

On postes fired fast and tytle wrote, and left it there.
Aeneas from the victor Greekes, these armes hath offred here.
Than portes bid them leaue, and fursh to sea them selfes to stere Strait wt their ores thei sko~m the seas, and salt some through they swéepe, And strait from sight Pheaca towres wée hid with mountains stéepe.
And round about Epirus cost we ronne, and than anon
To Chaon hauen, and vp the town of Butrot hie wée gon.
There Helenus (as custome was) furst heysers downe he slewe, And praied his God of peace, and than the labels he withdrew From of his holy head, and to thy blessed secretes, me Phoebus hand in hand he brought, all trembling them to sée,
goddesse son, (for greater luck than mankind, through the deepe Doth gyde thee thus, and greater might to greater things doth keepe) Right true it is, the king of gods him selfe so destny gydes, So lots doth fal, and so the whéele of fatall order slydes.
Few things of nombers mo, to thée, that bolder through the seas Thou maist endure, and to thy port at last arriue with eas
know them not, and Iuno more to tell my toonge doth holde.
First Itali, whom nere at hand onware thou dost suppose, And nere at hand in hauen thy rest to take thou dost propose: Far out aloof, and long aloof it lieth, in compas sore, And furst in Sicil streame thou must embathing bend thyne ore.
And fléeting in the salt sea fome long coursinges must thou make, For Circes yle must furst be seen, and lands of Limbo lake, Ere thou thy citie sauf on land maist buylde, and resting fynde.
These tokens thee tell, do thou imprint them well in mynde.
Whan thou alone with careful hart shalt sit besides a flood, And se a sow of mighty fise that late hath layed her brood, Beneth a bank among the rootes with thirtie sucklings out, All white her selfe on ground, and whyte her bratts her dugs about: There shal thy citie stand, there lieth thy rest of labours all, Nor dread thee not the plage that shall of tables eating fall.
The destnies will inuent a way therfore, and Phoebus bright Shawe thine ayde, and thee therof from dangers all acquite.
But yonder coast, and all that lond that ouer next vs lies, Though part of Italy it be, attempt it in no wise.
Leaue all aloof, the cursed Greekes all cities there haue fild,
One quarter men of Locrus hath, and castels strong they bild.
Another were in Salent field, all places pestryng wide, Idomeneus duke his armie keepes, and there beside Petilia small, whom Philoctetes wall doth compasse round, Duke Melybee therin doth dwell, and Greekes possesse the ground.
Mareouer, whan the seas ar past, and ships in saufty stand,
And altars thou shalt make to pay thy vowes vpon the sand: With purple wéedes and hoodes of purple hews your selfs attyer, In purple hyde your heads from sight, before the sacred fier, For honoar great of Gods: that no vnfrendly signe or face, Of enmytie apéere, disturbing all, and hinder grace.
This custome keep thy self, so let thy mates and all thy traine, In this religion pure also thine ofspring shall remaine.
But whan approching Scicil coast the wind thée furth doth blowe,
And that Pelorus croked straytes begyn them selfes to showe:
Than left hand land, and left hand sea, with compas long alée, Fetch out aloof from londs and seas on right hand, se thou flee.
These places two sometime, by force with bretche and ruines great, (So Tyme doth alter thinges, and what is it but Age doth eate?) From soonder fel (men say) whan both in one the ground dyd grow, The seas brake in by force, and through the mids did ouerthrow,
Both townes and feildes: and Itali forthwith from Scicill syde
Dyd cut, and yet wyth narow streame and sharpe it doth deuyde.
The rightsyde Scylla kéepes, the left, Caribdis gulf vnmylde, Wyth gaping mouth she sits, and to her wombe the waters wylde Thre times to ground she gulps, and thrise the same to skies on hight By course aloft she lifts, against the starres the surges smight.
But Scylla couching close in caue, if pray she haply finds:
Her head aboue the streame she holdes, and ships in rockes she winds
From shulders vp a man she séemes, in breast a mayden bright, But from the nauel down a whale, with vgly shape to sight.
Compacted of the wombs of wolues, and mixt with Dolphins tailes Behind her long thay lag, and thus in seas her self she trailes.
Yet better is Pachinus point, and crokes both in and out By leysure al to séeke, and courses long to cast about: Than once this Scylla monster wyld behold in dongeon foule, Or heare the roare among the rocks of doggs that there do houle.
Besides al this, if cunning ought of prophecies, or skyll To Helenus is giuen, if Phoebus me doth truely fyll: One thinge to thée thou Goddesse son, one thing, and ouer all
One thing will thée warne, and yet again, and yet shall.
Dame Iunos Godhode greate adore, with hart and praiers méeke.
To Iuno make thy vowes, that lady great and mightie séeke To wyn wyth humble gyfts, so shalt thou to thy mynd at last, All sauf to Italy aryue, the lond of Sicill past.
There whan thou comst, and Cumas town thou entrest first at shore, Where holy lakes, and woodes, and floods Auerna doth rore, frantike Prophet priest of womankind thou shalt behold,
And destnies out she sings, and leaues with notes and names she signes.
What euer thing that virgin writes, in leaues and painted lines, In rymes and verse she settes, and them in caues in raunges couche: There still they lye, nor from their orders moue if nothing touche But whan the dore by chaunce doth turne, and wind the corner blowes: Their heapes a sonder fall and forth they flie, and breake their rowes.
She them to stay, nor from their caues to flye doth neuer let, Nor séekes them eft to ioyne, nor of her verses more doth set.
Away they ronne, and Syblies house their maystresse seate they hate.
There let no time be lost, but though for hast thou thinkist late, Though al thy mates do cal and crie to seas, and wind at wil Allurith forth thy fléete, and sayles thou maist with puffing fill: Assaie the prophet first, and her with praiers due beseache, Thy destnies thée to tell, and chaunces all by mouth to teache.
Of Italy she shall thee shew, and peoples all declare,
And euery labour how thou maist auoyde, or how endure, And all thy course she will thee tell, that preist and prophet, pure.
These thyngs may thee shew, and this to heare hath béen thy chaunce.
Go, play thy part, and mighty Troy to heauen with déedes aduaunce.
Which thyngs, whan thus the prophet me so like a fréende had tolde: Great gifts of Yuery wrought, and treasour great in weight of golde,
To ships he bids vs beare, and rowmes abourd he made to lade
With siluer plenty great, and Plate full riche and massy made, gorgeous armor coat also, thrée folded gilt with hookes Of gold, and helmet eke, with crest thereon that glistryng lookes, Neptolemus his armes.
And armour eke vnto my mates he gaue, and doth supplie Our want of Ores, my father all this whyle doth bid them hie, And sayles in order set, that nothyng lacke whan wynde doth call.
Whom Phoebus prophet spake vnto with these woordes last of all.
Anchises, whom dame Venus proude in bed did not discayne, Thou care of gods that twise from Troyes destruction doost remayne:
Lo Italy, lo yonder it to thée, set vp thy fayle And take the same, yet must thou passe by this lond out of faile.
That further lond it is, Appollo sheweth that further shore.
Go forth, happy man with such a son, what shuld more Prolong the time in talke? and you from winde that riseth kéepe? Likewise Andromache no lesse at parting gan to wéepe.
And robes of ryche aray, and broyded déepe with gold she brought, Troian mantel for Ascanius wondrous gorgeous wrought.
And him with giftes, and weauing workes of gold ful gay doth lade.
Than said she thus: take this of me, mine own hands hath it made, Take this my child, that long with thée my loue in mind may last.
Of Hectors wife receyue thy fréends good wil, and tokens last,
So he his eyes, so he his hands, so lyke he bare his chéere, And now alike in yeres with thée his youth he should haue led.
Than parting thus to them spake, and teares for wéeping shed.
Now fare ye wel, happy men, whose fortunes end is past.
New destnies vs doth call, and wée from care to care ben cast.
Your rest is ready wonne, no féeld of seas you haue to eare, To séeke the land that backe doth alway flée you néede not feare, Your citie faire in fashion lyke to Troy and Xanthus old, Your riuer like, and bildings worthy praise you do behold.
Your proper hands them made, the frames thereof your selues do reare With better lucke (I trust) and lesse shal néede the Greekes to feare.
If euer to Tyber flood and fieldes of Tyber fayer May come, and sée my citie bylt, whereof not despayer:
Two peoples neighbour like shal dwel, and frendship fast betwinne Epirus and Italia lond, whose founder both of name King Dardan is, one blood wée be, and chaunce haue had the same.
And now of both one Troy to make in mind let vs prepare, And to our ofspring after vs likewise wée leaue the care.
In seas wée went, and at Ceraunia néere our selfs wée put.
From whence Italia lyeth, and shortest course there is to cut.
The sonne this while doth fal, and shadows great doth hide the hills, Wée spred our selfs on lond, and layd vs down with gladsom wills, Whan ships to shore was brought, and chere wée make on corners all Our wery lymmes wée fresh, and slomber swéete doth on vs fall.
Nor yet from vs the midnight houre his compas quite had ronne:
Whan Palinurus quick from couche himself to stere begonne, To féele the winde, and quarters all with eares attentif harks.
And euery starre that still doth stand or moues in heauen he marcks, The wayne, the plowstar, the seuen that stormes and tempests poures, Orion grym with fauchon great of gold also that loures.
Whan all thing sure he seeth, and al thing faier in skies aboue, From shipbourd loud he giues a signe, we than our campe remoue, The way we seke to kéepe, and wings of sailes full hye we houe.
And now the morning read doth rise, and starrs expulsid be,
Italia than with greeting loude my mates for ioy replied.
Did crowne, and fill with wine, and vp to Gods on hye did hold, Auauncing forth in shyp.
gods, that londs and seas, and tempests great haue might to gide: Vouchsafe your grace to send, and speede vs fast with winde and tide.
And Pallas temple towre to vs doth broad in sight appéere.
My felowes made to shore, and downe their sailes they do bestowe, The port lieth in from estern seas, and crokith like a bowe, front it rocks do stand, and salt sea fome about them falles, But close it self it lieth, on eyther side mith hugy walles Two rocky towres arise, the temple shrinks away from shore.
There for a lucke foure horses first saw to féede in gras, The ground with teeth they share, and white as snow their colour was.
My father than Anchises: warre (O contrey {quod} land he) Thou thretnest warre, these beasts betoken warre, right wel sée.
But than again, for in the cart sée they wonted were,
To draw like matches meete, and glad their bitts and yokes to bere,
hope of peace (he said) than last our blessed gods we pray.
And Pallas great in warre, that first vs did receiue that day.
And heades with purple hoodes before the fiers in Troian gist We hid from sight, as Helenus with great charge did aduise, And vnto Greekishe Iuno there, with gifts and honours new
Our shroudes aloft wée lift, and sailes abroad on hie wée heaue.
Anon the Greekishe townes, and contrey sore suspect we leaue.
Than passe wee by Tarentum baye, where Hercules sometime (If mens report be trew) did dwell, and there against doth clime Lacima goddesse seat, and towres of Caulon castles hie.
And than to Scillas wrackfull shore with ships approche wée nie.
And hugy noyse of seas wée here, and stones that beaten be Against the cliues, and flapping voyce of waues and water sounds, The surges aloft, and from the sands they stere the grounds.
Than said my father Anchises, lo, here is Charibdis hold,
mates, lay to your might, and vs with ores from hens remoue.
They did doo his commaund, and Palinurus first aboue, His tacle to the left hand set, and sterne to left hand wried: To left hand all my mates their ships, with windes and ores aplied.
As hie as heauen wée rise, with mounting waues, and therwithall Whan down wée come, onto the soules of hell wée thinke wée fall Thrée rorings loud among the rockes wée heard and surges flashe.
And thries the falling fome to breke, and starrs we saw to washe.
This while the wind our weary fléete forsooke, so did the sunne, And onaware, on Ciclops coast from out our curse wee runne.
Sometime therout a blustring cloude doth breke, and vp to skies All smokin black as pitche, with flakes of fiers among it flies, And flames in foldings round, to sweepe the starrs, the mouth doth cast, Sometime, the rockes and mountains déepe entrailes, a sonder brast: It belching, bolkith out: and stones it melts, and vp it throwes In lompes with rearing noise, and low beneth the botome glowes.
Enceladus (men say) half brent, (some time,) with lightning blast
Is pressyd here with waight, and Aetna houge on him is cast.
Whose flaming breath along those furneis chimneis vp doth rise.
And whan his weery syde he happs to turne, in wonders wise All Scicil lond doth shake with noise, and smoke doth close the skies.
That night in woods with straungy sightes and monsters far from kind
Wée troublid were, nor cause of all that nois or sound we find.
For neither star nor light in skies there was, nor welcken cléere, Nor yet for cloudes and tempest dimme, the Moone could ought apéere, The morning next doth rise at east, and light abroad was spred,
And from the skies the drowping shade of night away was sled: Whan sodenly, from out the woodes, with flesh consumyd leane,
To vs he came, and down did knéele, with handes abroade vpthrown.
Wée lokyd, foul araied he was, his beard was ouergrown His vesture rent with thornes, and like a Greeke in wéede he went, And was sometime among the Greekes to Troy in armour sent.
He whan that Troian enseignes out, and armes of Troy beheld, Affraied, he pawsyd first, and still him self a while he helde.
Anon in hast, all hedlong down he roonnes, and praiers méeke, With teares he wayling makes.
Now by the starrs you beséeke, By all the Gods, and by this breath of heauen that men do fede: Take me from hence (O Troians where ye list away me lede, To londes, or seas, recke not where, know my self a Greeke, And in their ships came, the spoyle of Troy your towne to séeke.
For which, if my offence so great deseruith such a wreke: In floodes do you me drowne, or al my limmes in waters breke.
If mankind me doth kill, it doth me good my life to loose.
So said he, and his knées before vs still he kéept in woofe.
What man he was wée bid him straight to tel, what kinred born, And what him ailes, and why he lokes so like a man forlorn.
My father Anchises gaue to him his hand him self anon, And bad him comfort take, for harme of vs he shuld haue non.
He set his fear aside, and thus his tale proceded on.
My father sent me there, and Adamastus is his name, Of poore estate, wold wée yet continued had the same, For in this place, whan all my fellowes fled this coast vnkynde For hast, in Cyclops dungeon wyde, they left me here behinde.
bloudy shop, where slaughters vile, and deynties foule do styncke: But houge and broade within: but he him selfe is worse to thincke,
No hart can him behold, nor toongue in talke can comprehende, On fleash of men he feedes, and wretches bloud he gnawes and bones, saw my self, whan of my fellowes bodies twayne at ones, With mighty hands he caught, and grouelyng on the ground outright Agaynst a stone he brake them both, the dongeon floore in sight
Did swimme with bloud, saw the bloud, and filthy slauer drop From out his mouth, whan he with teeth their quakyng limmes did chop But paied he was, nor there Vlisses in that daunger great This mischeif could sustayne to see, nor did him self forgeat.
For whan he gorged had him self with meates and drinkyng drownd, He bowed his neck to sleepe, and there he lay along the ground, An hideous thing to sight, and belching out the gubbes of blood, And lompes of fleshe with wine he galpyd fourth, wee all vpstood, And praied our Gods for help, and all atones him round about We spred our selfes, and did his eie with weapons sharpe put out.
His mightie eie, that on his frowning face full broad he held, In compas like the sonne, or like a Greekish armyng sheld.
And thus our fellowes liues at last full glad wee be to wreke.
But flee (alas) caitiues, flee, and fast from shore do breke Your cables.
For of the sort that Poliphemus is in dongen deepe, And closyth beastes, and straungers all doth kil, and milketh sheepe: hundred more a long this croked coast, of Ciclops fell Among these mountains hie do stray, and deepe in dennes they dwel.
Thre times the moone her light hath filde, and thrise her light exilde: Since my lyfe in woodes, and hauntes of beastes and monsters wild In wildernesse do leade, and Ciclops hie from holes and rockes All quaking behold, and of their feete feare the knockes.
For hunger, floes hath ben my food, and mast on trees found And Hawthornes hard, and rootes of herbes rent from out the ground.
All things about spied, this fleete at last on sea, see.
What euer it were, did my self bequeth therto to flee.
And now escapyd from this wickid kynd, am at eas.
Destroy me rather you, and giue to me what death you pleas.
Skant had he said his tale, whan on the mountain tops aboue, Him self among the beastes wee see, with boystous noyse to moue.
post in hand he bare of mighty Pyne, and therwithall He felt his way, and led his sheepe, there was his comfort all.
About his neck a pype there hong, his grief therwith to eas. Whan to the floodes he came, and set his foote within the seas, From out his greuous eye, thee blood he washt and poison foule
With gnasshing teeth for wo, and loude for wo began to houle.
And through the streamy waues he stamping goth, and yet aboue His brest is nothing wete, and thus him self in sea doth houe.
We all affrayd in hast away do flée, and vp wée take Our gest as worthy was, and soft our cables of wée brake.
Than swéepe we through the seas, and ores wée pul with might and main
He heard vs, and against the sound, he turning stept againe.
But whan with hand on vs to gripe, he could not haue his retche, Nor wading through the déepe of seas, vs back he could not fetche: roaring loude aloft he liftes, wherat the seas, and all The waters shooke, and londes therwith affrighted gan to pall Of Italy, and Aetna mount did yell as it wold fall.
But from the woodes, all Ciclops kind, in swarmes on euery hill
Arose and to the portes they runne, and shores along they fill.
Wée saw them stand (but harme they could not do) with louring eies, The brethren grym of Aetna mount, their heades were vp to skies, And vgly councell, like in sight for number to behold, Onto a forest great of okes, or trées of Cipres old, Or like Dianas wood that hie to heauen their tops doth hold.
All headlong fear enforfith vs to flée, nor way wée knowe, But fourth to seas in hast wée flew where wind vs list to blowe.
But than again king Helenus commaundments did vs stay, To kéepe betwene Charibdis gulfe, and Scilla middle way.
Betwéene them both we past with danger great, an glad we were, If course we coulde not kéepe, yet backe again we thought to bere.
Behold, a northen blast from out Pelorus mouth was sent,
And Megarus and all those bayes where Tapsus low doth lye left them all, and through the seas withwind at will flye These places vs repeted than, where left he had beforne, Pore Achaemenides, Vlisses mate vnlucky borne.
Against the race of Scicil lond, there lieth in seas an yle Plemmyrium of auncient men it hight, but later while Ortigia doth it call: the fame is, how Alphaeus brooke
And here it brastyth out, and Arethusas mouth it meetes.
And therwithall to Scicil seas it ronnes, and fourth it fléetes.
The blessed gods that in that place do dwell wée honour than,
And strait Elorus fertill soyle wée past, and fourth wee ran, Than through the rockes that steepe do stand against Pachinus nookes Our wayes wée share, with labours great wee ouercame the crookes Than Camerina poole whom destnie neuer graunt to moue, And Gelas towne full great, and Gelas hils apéeres aboue.
Than Agragas his gorgeous walles aloof sets out on hie: Where horses feerce somtime did bréede, the towres a farre wée spie.
And thée with all thy dates Selinus soone left behynd.
Than hauen at Drepanus tooke, in that vngladsome shore: Whan dangers all of seas and tempests great were past before: Alas my father, there, my onely ioy in care and wo, Anchises do lose (alas) he there departes me fro.
There me, father dere, in labours all thou dost forsake.
Alas in vaine from daungers all of seas thou hast ben take.
Nor Helenus whan he to me great fearefull thyngs did tell,
These waylings did forspeake to fall, nor yet Celeno fell.
This is my labour last, there was my iorney long at end.
From thence departing now doth god me to your contreys send.
So lord Aeneas, to them all ententife to behold, The destnies of the Goddes did shew, and all his courses told, He staied at last, and making here an end, did silence hold.
Getula townes, a people wyld in warres, and vncontrold, And sturdy Moores on euery quarter closes, and beside, The sandes of Sirtes coast, and wildernesse both long and wide, And desertes drie, where saluage men of Barcey broad do stray.
Than of the warres of Tyrus now that rise, what shuld saye? And of your brothers threatnings? hope the gods of purpose good, and mighty Iunos grace: Hath made the windes to bring the Troian ships into this place.
What citie sister shall you sée of this? what empier grow? Whan Troian armes to vs are knit, and men this wedlok know? With what renown and glory great shal Affrike thinke you rise? Do you your gods of pardon first beséeke (I thus aduise) And after seruice don, do him in gestwise entertaine, And causes find from day to day to make him here remaine, While winter wind endures, and while the skies haue laid their rage, And while the ships reparing ben, and force of seas aswage.
With this her burning mind incensyd more began to flame, And hope in doutfull hart she caught, and of she kest her shame.
First vnto temples all they gon, and peace on altars all They pray their gods to giue, and slaughters down they make to fall, To Ceres first that lawes did giue, to father Bacchus pure, To Phoebus, and to Iuno chief that hath of wedlocks cure.
Her self with boll in hand, Quéene Dido Quéene most fresh of hew The wine betwene the hefers hornes (so white as snow) she threw, Or at the stagys great of gods with gifts and vows she walks
With musing mind, and fortunes new by wondrous meanes she calks:
On beastes entrayles she pries, and liuers hote, and from their throtes The breathing lungs she séekes, and euery signe therin she notes.
calcars dreaming heads: what helps her vows, her pilgrim déedes, What helps her temples sought? whan soking flame her mary féedes This while, and festring déepe in brest her wound the faster bréedes.
So sely Dido burnes, and through the town with raging chere Astray she wanders wide, as doth sometime the striken dere, Whom ranging through the chase, some hunter shooting far by chaunce All onaware hath smit, and in her syde hath left his launce.
She fast to wildernesse and woods doth draw, and there complaines Alone, but vnderneth her ribbes the dealy dart remaines.
Sometime about the walles she walkes Aeneas by her side)
And town already made she shews, and pompe of Tyrus pride Beginnes to speake, and in the midds therof her tale she staies.
Sometimes againe, and towards night to bankettes him she praies, And Troian toyles again to tell she him beséekes, and harkes With burning mind, and euery word and countnance al she markes.
Than whan they parted wéere, and light of Moone was down by west, And on the skies the fallyng starres do men prouoke to rest: She than alone (as one forsaken) mournes, and in his place She laieth her downe, and thinks she heares and seeth him face to face.
Or on her lappe Ascanius for his fathers likenesse sake She holdes, if happely so she might this yrksome loue aslake.
The workes of towres are left, no feats of armes the youth applies, Nor hauons are wrought, nor for the wars the mighty bulwarks rise.
All things onperfit stand, the buyldings great, and thretnings hie Of hugy walles, and enginnes for their height that match the skie.
Whom whan dame Iuno saw with plage so wood to be dnaide

goodly praise (in déede) and worthy conquest great to speake Thy boy and thou do get: a gaye renown you do obtaine, If one poore woman trainid be by heauenly persons twaine.
Nor thinke not but know that thou my walls of Carthage hye Hast in suspect, and dreding still the worst, al thinges dost trie.
But shall wée neuer end? or why do wée so fearcely striue? And do not euerlasting peace and fréendship fast contriue? Why wedlockes ioyne wée not? thou hast thy self thin own desier, Now loue in Didos bones is bredde, she fries in raging fier.
Two people now therfore in one let vs conioine, and guide With equall loue: to Troian husband (lo) she shall be tyde, And Carthage all giue to thée for ioynter fast to bynd.
To her againe (for well she knew she spake with fainid mind That Rome she might reiect, and Carthage kingdome empier make) Than Venus answerd thus.
Who is so madde that will forsake This thing? or gladly wold in warre with thée so long contend? If what thou speakyst now will fortune bring to parfit end.
But distnies makes me doubt, and whether he that raignes aboue One towne of Troy and Tyrus made can be content to loue: Or will alow the peoples twaine to myxe and league to bynd,
Thou art his wife, thou maist be bold to frame and féele his mind.
Than said dame Iuno Quéene so stout, Let me alone for that: now how this thing shall come about Giue eare to me, for now my mind thou shalt perceyue outright.
hunting forth Aeneas goth with Dido wofull wight In woodes and forest wyde, whan morning next begins to spring, And sonne with glistring beames again to sight the world doth bring.
from aloft a stormye cloude, and mixt with sléet and hayle tempest darke as night on them to powre will not faile.
While in the woodes they walke, and while the youth enclose the toyle: The rayn shall rise, and heaues with thonders all will turmoyle.
Their company from them shall flée, eche one his head shall hide, caue the Quéene shall take, the Troian duke with her shal byde.
wil be there, and if thy will accord onto my mind: For euer shall make them fast and wedlock stedfast bind.
There shall beginne the day, that sorowes all shal quite exile.
Dame Venus graunted that, and to her self she gan to smyle, She gaue a nodde, and glad she was she coulde perceyue the gile.
The morning rose, and from the sea the sonne was comen about, Whan to the gates assemblith fast of noble youth a rout With nettes and engins great, and hunter speares ful large of length.
The horsmen rush with noise, and dogges are brought a mighty strength.
The great estates of Moores before the doores await the Quéene.
In chamber long she staies, and redy brydlyd best beseene The plafrey standes in gold, attirid riche, and féerce he stampes For pride, and on the fomy bit of gold with téeth he champes, At last she comes, and forth with mighty traine she doth procéede, All braue with mantell bright, encompast fresh in glistring wéede, Her quiuer on her shulder hanges, her heares with knottes of gold Are trust: and gold about her brest her purple garments hold.
The Troian péeres also went on, Ascanius glad of cheere, Aeneas eke before them all that fairest did apeere Aduauncith furth him self, and with the Quéene he ioynith band.
Most like onto Apollo cléere, whan to his contrey land To Delos down he comes, and winter cold he doth forsake, And feastes among his contrey lords and banketts great doth make, The daunsers do disguise them selfes, and altars round about, The husbandmen do hoppe and crie, with noyse and ioyfull shout.
Him self aloft on hilles doth walke, his wauering lockes behinde He wagges, and they with garlonds gay and twists of gold ar twind, His arrowes on his shulders clattring hanges: in maner like Aeneas went, so great a myrth to men his face doth strike.
Whan to the mountaines out they came and hauntes of beasts on hie: Behold, adown the rockes the deare with bounsing leapes do flie.
And ouer laundes they course, and many an heard of hart and hynd, With féet through dust vpthrown thei skud, and hilles they leaue behind.
But in the vale his praunsing stéede Ascanius swift bestrides, And somtime these, and sometime those, with swift course ouerrides.
With dastard beastes his mind is not content, but makith vows Some fomy bore to finde, or lion ramping read wold rowse.
By this time heauen with rombling noise and cloudes is ouercast, And thonders breake the skies, and rayne outrageous pourith fast, And shoures of haile and sléet so sharpe, that fast on euery syde The Carthage lords and Troian youth eche one them selfs doth hide In woodes and houses, here and there they seke, both man and childe For feare, and down from hilles the floodes do fall with waters wilde.
caue the Quéene did take, the Troian duke with her did byde.
The ground proclamyd myrth, and Iuno self did giue the bryde.
The fier and ayre agréed, and to this cowplyng gaue their light In signe of ioye, and ouer head the mountain fairies shright.
There first began the grief, that day was cause of sorowes all,
For nothing after that by fame she setts nor what may fall, Nor longer now for loue in stelth Quéene Dido her prouides, But wedlock this she calls, with wedlocks name her faut she hides.
Anon through all the cities great of Affrike, Fame is gone,
The blasing fame, a mischief such, as swifter is there none.
By mouing more she bréedes, and as she ronnes her might doth rise.
By lowe for fear she lurkith first, than straight aloft in skies, With pride on ground she goth, and percith cloudes with head on hight.
Dame Earth her mother brooded furth (men say) that child in spite Against the Gods, whan Giantes first of serpent féeted line Enceladus and Ceus wrought hie heauen to vndermine.
Than for disdaine (for on them selfs their owne worke Ioue did fling)
Their sister crawlyd furth, both swift of féete and wight of wing.
monster gastly great, for euery plume her carcas beares: Lyke number léering eies she hath, like number harckning eares,
Like number toonges mouthes she waggs, a wondrous thing to speake, At midnight fourth she flies, and vnder shade her sounde doth squeake.
Al night she wakes, nor slomber swéete doth take, nor neuer sléepes By daies, on houses toppes she sittes, or gates, or townes she kéepes.
On watching toures she climes, and cities great she makes agast, Both trueth and falshed foorth she tels, and lies abroade doth cast.
She than the peoples mouthes about with babling broade did fill, And things onwrought and wrought she tolde, and blew both good and yll.
How one Aeneas of the blood of Troy was come to lande, Whom Dido freshe for wanton loue ful soone had caught in hande.
And nowe this winter season long in pleasour passe they must Regarding non estate, but giue them selues to filthy lust.
These things in mouthes of men this goddesse vile ful thicke did thrust.
Than turning, straight her way she tooke onto Hiarbas king,
Whose mind with tales on fier she set, and sore his wrath did sting.
This king was Ammons sonne of Garamanth Nimphe his dame, hundred temples huge about his kingdoms wide of fame, hundred altars hie to Ioue he kept, with waking fiers Both night and day to God, and holy priestes had theyr desyers.
Of beastes and slaughters fat: the soiles with blood were al embrued And swéete with floures and garlondes fresh, the floores alway renewd.
He mad in minde, and through these bitter newes incensyd wood, Men say, as he before his altars prayed and humbly stood: His handes to heauen vp threwe, and thus he cryed with vexid mood.
Almighty Ioue, whom duely Moores estéeme for God and king, And feastes of broidred beddes to thee, and wines of ioy do bring,
Beholdst thou this? and mighty father thée with thunder dintes
Despise wée thus? and yet from vs thy strokes of lightninges stintes? Nor quake wée not, whan through ye cloudes thy sounding breakes aboue? In vayne thy voyces runne? wil nothing vs to vertue moue? woman, lately come to lande, that bought of vs the grounde, To whom the soyle wée gaue to tille, and citie new to founde, And lawes also wée lent, my wedlock (lo) she hath forsake: And now Aeneas lorde of her and all her lond doth make.
And now this pranking Paris fine with mates of beardles kinde:
To dropping heare and sauours nice, and vices all enclinde, With Greekish wimple pinkid, womanlike: yet must the same Enioy the spoiles of this, and wée thy seruauntes take the shame,
For all our offryng giftes to thee wée finde no fruite but fame.
Thus prayeng in his feruent moode, and altars holdyng fast, Almighty Ioue him heard, and to the courte his eies did cast.
Where now these louers dwell forgettyng life of better fame.
Go son, come of, and call the windes, and wynged slip thée downe Vnto the Troian duke, that now aloof in Carthage town Doth lynger time, and of his fatall cities hath no minde.
Go speake to him, and thus conuey my words as swift as winde.
Not such a man his mother deere did promise he should proue, Nor him from daungers twise of Greekes for this did she remoue: But one that shuld Italia lond where dréedful warres do swell By conquest vndetread, and them to right and peace compell, And Troian blood he shuld aduaunce to due renowne and fame, And all the worlde shuld vnder lawes subdue and rule the same.
If glory non of things so great nor corage him doth moue, Nor for his praise him self to take the paynes he doth not loue, Yet from Ascanius why doth he the towres of Rome remoue? What meanes he? why remaines he thus within his enmies ward? And had not vnto Lauin lond and ofspring there regard? Bid him to sea, this is the somme, ({quod} he) go tell him this.
This spoken, he his fathers mind obeyed as duety is.
And first his slender féete with shoes and wings of gold he ties,
That him both vp and down doth beare, where euer coast he flies, Both ouer seas and ouer londes, in post in ayer aboue.
He toke his rodde also, wherwith from hell he doth remoue The louring soules, and soules also to dongeons déepe he sendes, And sleepes therwith he giues and takes, and men from death defendes.
The winds by force therof he cutts, and through the clouds he swimms, And now, approching néere, the topp he séeth and mighty limms
Of Atlas old, whom beating shoures and stormes and tempests weares Whose head encompast all with trées of Pine in garlondwise, With louring cloudes is euer clad, that more and more do rise, His shulders hid with snow, and from his hoary beard adowne, The streanies of waters fall, with ise and frost his face doth frowne.
There first on ground with wings of might doth Mercury ariue.
Than down from thens right ouer seas himself doth headlong driue,
Most like a byrd that nere the bankes of seas his haunting kéepes, Among the fishfull rocks, and low byneth on water swéepes.
Non otherwise Mercurius betwéen the skies and lands Did sheare the winds, and ouerflew the shores of Lybi sands.
Whan first the bowres of Affrike land with wingid féete he twight: Aeneas he might sée to stand among them broad in sight Aduauncing vp the towres, and houses hye was altring newe, Begyrt with hanger bright, beset with stones as starrs to vewe, And shining read in roabe of Moorishe purple, mantle wise, He stood, and from his shulders down it hing Morisco gise.
Quéene Didos worke it was, her precious gift of loue to hold, Her self the web had wrought, and warpyd fine with wreath of gold.
Thou now of Carthage hye Foundations new dost lay, and doting dost thy mind applye To please thy lusty spouse, and citie fayer thou dost prepare, Alas, and of thine own affaires or kingdoms hast no care.
Him self the mighty god doth me to thée on message send, The king of heauen and earth, that all this world with becke doth bend.
Himself hath bid me through the winds so swift these things to tel.
What gost about? why spendist time in Lybi land to dwell? If glory non of things so great thy corage do not moue, Nor thou for praise to take the paine wilt for thine owne behoue: Yet by Ascanius rising now haue some regard to stand, And hope of heyres of him, to whom by right Italia land And empier great of Rome is dew.
So said this heauenly wight, And in the middes his tale he brake, and fled from mortall sight, And out of reatche of eyes as thinne as aier he vanisht quighte.
Aeneas than affrighted stood in silence domme dismaid, His heare vprose for feare, his voyce betwéene his iawes if stayd.
Faine wold he flée, and of that contrey swéete his licence take.
Astoynid with so great commaundment giuen, and god that spake.
Alas what shall he do? how dare he now attempt to breake Vnto the Quéene of this? or where his tale beginne to speake? His doubtfull mind about him swift he kest both here and there, And sondry wayes he wayed, and searcheth dangers euery where.
Thus striuing long, this last deuise him liked best of all.
And bids them rigge their fléete, and close their people draw to shore,
And armors all prepare, and lest therof might rise vprore: Some causes els they should pretend, him self whan time shal serue, Whan Dido least doth know, and lest suspectes his loue to swarue, He will assay to séeke most pleasaunt time with her to treat, And méetest meane to make (for craft is all, who can the feat) They glad without delay their lords commaundment did fulfill, All thyngs in order set, and close they kept their princes will.
What craft can compas loue? She did forcast no lesse, and first she felt their practise moue, All thynges mistrustyng straight, and fame also that monster wood Her fumes encreased more, with newes, the ships in armor stood, And Troians for their flight (she sayd) all thynges prepared had.
Her hart therwith did faint, and frantike (like a creature mad) She rayles with rampyng rage, through the streates and townes about With noyse she wanders wyde, most like a gide of Bacchus rout: Whan shouting through the fields with trompet sound they run by night, In freke of Bacchus feast, and mountaynes hie they fill with shright, At last vnto Aeneas thus talke her wordes she dight.
To hide also from me this mischief great, hast thou the hart? Thou traitor false? and from my londe by stelih woldst thou depart? Nor my vnfayned loue, nor thy remorse of promise plight, Nor Dido, like to die with cruell death, can stay thy flight? But in the middes of winter storme away thou wilt in hast? In these outragious seas, and through the force of northen blast? caytife most vnkynde: what if it were a contrey knowne, The lond thou gost to seeke, no straungy realme, but all thine owne? What if that Troy, sometime thy natiue town, did yet endure? Should Troy through all these boystous seas this time thy ships allure? And fleest thou me? Now by these wéepyng teares, and thy right hand (For nothyng els left me miser now wherby to stand) By our espousayll first, and for the loue of wedlocke sought: If euer well deseruid of thee, if euer ought Of ioy thou hadst of me, haue mercy now, am ontwind.
Destroy not all my house, be not so extreme enkind, If prayers may preuaile, let prayers yet relent thy mind.
For thée alone the tirantes all and kings of Lyby land Do hate me now, for thée alone my people me withstand, For thée also my shamefast life brake, and euermore
He wold haue spoke, her ladies lift her vp, and vp did beare, To chamber her they brought, in precious bed they layd her there.
But good Aeneas though full faine he wold her grief aswage, And wordes of comfort speke to turne from her that heuy rage, In hart he mourned much, and shaken sore with feruent loue: Yet to his ships he went to do the charge of gods aboue.
Than all the Troians them bestyrd, in hast on euery side, Their ships they launched out, the anoynted plankes on water glide.
And ores they made of bows, the woods with them to seas they beare Vnshapen yet for hast.
From all the town they ranne, you might them swarming thick behold.
And like as Antes applie their worke, that thinck on winter cold,
Whan heapes of corn they spoyl, and to their house conuey theyr store: Their army blacke goeth out, and from the féelds with labour sore Their booties home they bring, and some the kernels great of grain With might of shulders shoue, and some behind suruey the train, Correcting some for slewth, with chéering forth the worke it heates, The waies are worn with weight, and euery path of labour sweates.
What mynd alas Dido now? what grief was this to thée? What wailing vp thou setst? whan so on shore thou didst them sée? And whan thou mightst behold before thy face from toures on hye The seas on euery syde resound with such vprore and crye? Loue vnmylde, what dost thou not man mortal driue to séeke? Again to teares she goeth, again she falls to prayers méeke, She yéeldes to him for loue, nor nothing will she leaue vntried, But practise all to proue, if ought will helpe before she died.
Lo sister Anne, thou séest how swift to shore this people hies, From eueri coast they come, their sailes are set for wind to rise, With crownes for ioy their seamen deck their pups in garlandguise.
If euer, sister, such a grief had come within my thought: wold haue borne the same, or els som other swift haue wrought.
Yet one thing sister, in this woful plight do thou for mée, For this peiured wretche regarded non so much as thée.
To thée alone he wold commit both secret thought and déede, Thou knowest the mans good houres, and plesa~t time with him to spéede.
Go sister, and go tel my wordes to my disdainfull foo: was not she that did conspier with Greekes to Troy to goo, Nor did subuert his townes, nor ships nor armour euer sent
To stroy the Troian blood, nor to his foes assistens lent.
neuer brake his fathers tombe, nor bones in peaces chopt.
Why hath he thus to my request his eares so stifly stopt? Where nowe away to ronne, will he remoue in al this hast? let him yet haue one respect to me for token last, This one rewarde craue, for duties all most miser wight, let him byde a whyle, tyll winde and seas may serue his flyght.
séeke no more the wedlocke olde, which he hath nowe betrayed, Nor from Italia goodly lande he lenger should be stayed.
séeke no longer him to kéepe his kingdome to forbeare.
vacant tyme aske, and respit small my wo to weare, Whyle fortune learne me to lament, and brooke my fatal fall, For pity (sister) sue for me this pardon last of all.
Which whan thou doest obteyne: requite it with my death shal.
Thus talked she with teares, and wéeping thus both to and fro Her sister went and came, and bare and brought encrease of wo.
But weeping nought preuayles, nor wailing ought his minde doth moue, His brest so stifly bent, entreatinges al from him doth shoue, God worketh so, his gentle eares are stopt from heauens aboue.
And as an auncient Oke of timber stout is tost and torne, With northen boystous blastes, now here, now there with bending born, Whan struggling windes do striue, the craking noise aloft doth sounde, The braunches breake aboue, and bows abrode ar spread on grounde.
Yet still on rockes it standes, and as the top doth climbe to growe To heauens in height: so reacheth downe the roote to Limbo low.
Non otherwyse afflicted is this prince with message brought, Incessauntly with teares, and gréeuous cares opprest his thought, Yet standes he fixed styll, and teares of eyes do tryll for nought.
Than Dido (woful soule) with plagues of destnies foule affright Desires to dye, she lothith nowe of heauen to see the light.
Her purpose also further foorth to set, and lyfe to leaue: As she on burning altars did encense and offeringes heaue, (A lothsome thing to speake) the sacred liquors blacke they stood, And wines in powring foorth she saw them turne to filthy blood.
This vision to no wight, no, not her sister déere she tolde.
There was also within her court, to serue her husbande olde
marble temple pure of wondrous worke, that day by day Deuoutly she did dresse with fléeses whyte, and garlandes gay:
Than was it night, and creatures all that wéery were on grounde
Dyd take their stomber swéete; both woods and seas had left their sounde, And waues of waters wylde, whan starres at mydnight soft do slyde, Whan whust is euery fielde, and beastes and birdes of painted pride In bushes: broade that bréede, and countrey foules of lande and lake, By night in silence styll are set on sléepe, their eas to take, Forgetting labours long, and care away from hart they shake.
But not so Dido coulde, nor neuer rest relieues her mynde, On sléepe she neuer fals, her eyes or hart no night can finde.
Her cares encreasing ryse, with raging loue in brest she boyles freshe, an surges wylde of wrath within her selfe she toyles.
Betwéene them thus she striues, and thus her heauy hart turmoyles.
Lo, what shal now do? shal agayne go séeke with shame, My former suters loue? shal go sue to wed the same? Whom so oftentimes to take to me disdayned haue? Or shal in the Troian fléete go serue, and lyue a slaue? What els? for where they had before this tyme reliefe of mée: They wyl remember that, and wel they quite me now you sée.
Admit woulde so do, what is he there wyl me receiue To their disdayneful ships? foole, thou dost thy selfe deceiue.
creature lost, dost thou not yet the falshed vnderstande Of that periured nation false of Laomedons bande? What than? shal alone pursue these boatmen braue in flight? Or shal rayse my people al in armes with me to fight? And them that out of Sydon lande skarsely brought with payne, Shal go bid them sayle, and sende them out to seas agayne? Nay rather dye thy selfe, as worthy wel thou dost deserue, And with this weapon quenche away thyne owne distresse and sterue.
Thou sister ouercome with teares, on me this mischiefe furst Didst put, and to my mortal foe didst throwe me most accurst.
Coulde not yet my lyfe haue led without reproche or misse, As doth some saluage beast? and not haue felt the cares of this? My promise broken is, that my husbande dead dyd make.
These waylings she within her brest with hart ful heauy brake.
Aeneas than abourd in ship assured foorth to passe: Was taking rest, and for the flight al thing prepared was.
To hym the god agayne in habit lyke, and former face Appearing shewed him selfe, and thus in dreame bespake his grace.
All things lybe Mercury he bare, both forme and voyce and hew, And glosse of shining heare, and comely youth of beauty newe.
Thou goddesse sonne, in all this parlous season canst thou sléepe? Nor howe thou art beset with dangers great hast thou no kéepe? Thou foolishe man? these goodly westerne windes dost thou not here? She now on mischiefe thinkes, and wicked craft her minde doth stere, Assured bent to death, and waues of wrath her hart doth cast.
Wylt thou not headlong flée betyme, whyle power to flée thou hast? Anone the seas enclosed vnder ships, and blasing brondes On euery syde shal shyne, thou shalt sée burnyng all the strondes, If thée this mornyng sonne about this countrey finde to raunge.
Breake of dispatche: a diuers minded thing, and full of chaunge Is woman kinde alway, dispatche.
So spake this heauenly wight, And through the darke of night hymselfe withdrew from mortal sight.
Aeneas with that sodayne voyce in minde right sore appalde: Him selfe from sléepe he shooke, and on his mates he freshly calde.
Nowe euery man awake, bestow your selues on hatches hye, In hast hoyst vp your sayles, agayne the god is come from skye.
In hast foorthwith to shift, and cables cut from hence to flée, Lo ones agayne he calles.
blessed god wée wayte on thée What euer thou art: thy wyl ngayne with glad chéere wée obey.
Be with vs nowe for spéede, and sende vs starres to guyde our way, And weather good (he sayde.)
With that, he drewe his fawchon out, That bryght as lyghtning shone, and cables strake with courage stout.
Than euery man bestirs: they séeke, they snatche, they take, they teare, The shores aloof they leaue, the seas for ships appéeres no where.
And nowe the Mornyng read had left syr Tythons paynted bed,
And broade on earth her glystring beames and lyght had newly spread.
The Quéene as dawning waxed whyte from tooting towres on hye, When she the fléete thus vnder sayle in order did espye, And winde at wyll to driue, and nothing left behynde at shore, And sawe the hauons all emptie stonde withouten beate or ore: Thrée tymes her hands she beate, and foure times strake her comly brest, Her golden heare she tare, and frantikelyke with moode opprest: She cryed, Iupiter, god ({quod} she) and shalla go In déede? and shalla flowte me thus within my kyngdomes, so? Shal not myne armies out? and al my peoples them pursue? Shal they not spoyle their ships, or burne them all with vengeance due?
Out people, out vpon them, folow fast with fiers and flames.
Set sailes aloft, make out with ores, in ships, in boates, in frames.
What speake I? or where am I? what furies me do thus enchaunt? Dido woful wretch, now destnies fell thy head doth haunt.
This first thou shouldst haue don, whan thou thy kingdom putst fro~ thée.
This goodly faith and trouth hath he That so deuout, his countrey gods men say doth séeke to reare, And he that on his shulders did his aged father beare.
Could not him by force haue caught, and péece from péece haue torne? Or spred his limmes in seas, and all his people staine beforne? Could not of Ascanius chopping made? and dresse for meate His flesh? and than his father done thereof his fill to eate? Than grown a doubt there had perhaps in fight, what if it had? Whom dred bent to death? than would straight with furies mad Haue brent his campe with bronds, and fild his ships with fier flame.
Both sier and son destroyd, and of their nation quenche the name, That done, wold haue thrown my self ful glad vpon the same.
Sonne with blasing beames, that euery déede on earth dost vewe, And Iuno goddesse great, that knowest what thing to this is dewe: Diana déepe, whose name by night al townes in crospathes crie, And fends of vengeans fell, and gods that Dido make to die, Receiue my words, and turne from me the wreke of sinners paine.
Heare now my voyce: yf destnies do that wicked head constraine To enter hauen, and néedes he must with mischief swimme to land, If god will néedes dispose it so to be, there let it stand.
Yet let him vexed be, with armes and warres of peoples wyld, And hunted out from place to place, an outlaw stil exyld, Let him go begge for helpe, and from his child disseuered be, And death and slaughters vile of all his kinred let him sée.
And whan to lawes of wicked peace he doth him self behight, Yet let him neuer raigne, nor in this life to haue delight: But die before his daye, and rotte on ground withouten graue.
This is my prayer last, this with my blood of you craue.
Than to their linage all, you my people shew despite, Moores applie them still with strife, let hatred hate acquite.
Whan dead am: let neuer loue nor leage betwene you be.
Than of my bones arise there may some impe reuenger fell,
That shall the Troian clownes with force of fier and sword expell.
Now, than, and euermore, as time shall serue to giue them might Let shore to shore, and streame to streame, be stil repugnant right.
This desier, let them in armes and al their offpring fight.
Thus said she, and her minde about in compas wyde she kest, Desiring soone this hateful world to leaue and be at rest.
Than thus to Barcey straight, Sichaeus nurse she shortly said, (For at her contrey old, her own, in dust before was laid:) Deare nurse ({quod} she) go bid my fister hast that she were here, Attyre her selfe she must, and washe with streames of water clere, And offrings bid her bring, and beastes appointed here to leade, And thou thy head (O nurse deuout) with vesture sée thou spreade, Than let her come.
To Pluto déepe such vowes as haue take My mynde is to performe, and of my cares an end to make.
The tokens all of Troy to burning fier wyl commit.
She hearing steppid furth, and hasted on with aged wit.
But Dido quaking fearce with frantike mode and grisly hewe, With trembling spotted chekes, her huge attemptings to pursue, Besides her selfe for rage, and towards death with visage wan, Her eyes about she rold, as red as blood they loked than.
Anon to the inner court in hast she ronnes, and vp the pyle She mounting climes aloft, and on the top thereof awhyle She stood, and naked from the sheath she drawes the fatal blade gift of Troy, that vnto these effectes was neuer made.
There, whan she saw the Troyan weeds and couch acquainted laid With tricling teares awhile, and mourning hart her self she staied.
Than flat on bed she fel, and these her last wordes than she said.
swete remain of clothing left, and thou dulcet bedde, (While god and fortune wold, and while my life with you ledde) Receyue from me this soule, and from these cares my hart vntwyne.
tyme of life had, of fortunes race ran the lyne: And now from me my figure great goth vnder ground to dwell.
My walls reysed haue, and citie riche that doth excell.
My husbandes death, and on my brother false wroke my téene.

This said, she wried her head, and vnreuenged must we die? But let vs boldly die ({quod} she) thus, thus to death plie.
Thus vnder ground gladly go, lo thus do expier, Let yonder Troian tyrant nowe wyth eies deuour this fier, As on the seas he sittes, and with my death fulfil his ire.
Thus speaking, in the middes thereof she left, and therewithall With brest on persing sword, her laties saw where she did fall.
The blade in fomy blood, and hands abrode with sprauling thrown· To heauen the shoutes arise, and through the town the fame is blown.
Lamenting loude beginnes, and wailinges wide, and roarings hie, In euery house they houle, and women cast a ruful crie.
The citie shakes, the noyse rebounding breakes the mighty skie.
Non otherwise, than if some rage of enemies all their towne At ones had ouerronne, and houses hie were tearing downe, As all at ones shuld fall, Carthago proude, or auncient Tyre, And buildings both of gods and men shuld burne with blasing fier: Her sister heard the sound, as dead for dréede she stood vndrest, With nailes her face she tare, and with her fistes she beat her brest, And ramping through the midds of men she ronnes, and by her name She calls her: now in death.
sister mine, and lady dame, Is this the cause that from thée so far beguiled was? Did this pyle of fier and altars builde for this? alas, What shuld now forsaken first complaine? sister swéete, Hast thou despised, me to take with thée, a mate so méete? Why didst thou me thy sister to this death disdaine to call? One wepon shuld vs both dispatch at ones from sorows all.
And with my handes haue so wrought? haue my gods so cried? That from this cruel plight of thine my presens was denied? sister, now thou hast vndon this day bothe thée and me, Thy town, thy peoples all, thy worthy lordes confounded be.
Carthago quenched is: let me washe these wounds in hast, And if there be remaining yet soine lyfe or breathing last, My mouth shall fetche the same furthwith.
So said she, and now alost The pyle she clymyd had, and in her bosom clasping soft Her sister heauy helde (in pang that was) and with her wéede She wailing wypid of the deadly blood that black did bléede.
She towardes her, hée heaui fainting eies wold faine haue cast, But fixed vnderneth her brest her wound reboyleth fast.
Thre times her self she lift, and on her elbow sought to staye.
And thrise she sounding fell, and there vpon she gaue a braye,
Than thrise on bed she tost, and with her eyes vprolling round, Of heauen she sought the light, and groned sore whan it she founde, Almighty Iuno than, these labours hard, and passage long Lamented sore to sée, and down she sent in message strong, Dame Iris hie, that on the Rainbow read in heauen doth sit: This struggling soule to take, and from these pains her lyms vnknit.
For whereas no deserued death, nor destnies her did kill, But sely soule before her day, by rage of frantike will, Her golden heare as yet from her not taken was, nor yet Diana dampned had her head to lake of Lymbo pit: Dame Rainbow down therfore with safron wings of dropping showres, Whose face a thousande sundry hewes agaynst the sunne deuoures, From heauen descending came, and (on her head.)
Here doo thée To Pluto nowe bequeath, and from this corps make thée frée.
She sayde, and with her hande she clipt her heare so cleare that shynde, And therewithal her lymmes at ones their heate from them resynde.
And thinne as ayer her lyfe went out, disperst abrode in wynde.
Aeneas leauyng Carthage, and saylyng towards Italy, by force of a tempest is driuen into Scicil, where, beyng freendly receaued by Acestes: he celebrateth his father Anchises tweluemonethes mynde, whom he had buried at Drepanus that day tweluemoneth before.
And maketh playes, and games at his graue, and distributeth rewards to such as wunne them.
Eurialus, through the sleight of Nisus: winneth the price in runnyng, and so doth Eurytion in showting.
Entellus the auntient, ouercometh Dates at ye game called Caestus (which is fightyng with bagges or flappes of leather hanging by stringes, wherin is either lead, or sand) who youthfully boasted of him self.
Howbeit the cheif rewards, and honour, in respect of age, and dignitie: were adiudged vnto Acestes, whose arrow when it flew into the ayer: sodenly waxed a fier.
Ascanius in the honour of Anchises his graundfather with the other youth of nobilitie practizeth fight, and feates on horsebacke, resemblyng warlike prowisse.
In the meane time the Troiane wyues, at the instigation of the Raynbovv and for weary somnesse of theyr longe trauayle: cast fier amonge the fleet, and quite destroyed foure tall ships.
The rest by a soden showre of rayne sent by Iupiter: were preserued from burnyng.
The night followyng, Anchises appeareth to his sonne Aeneas in a dreame, warneth him from Iupiter, that followyng the counsell of Nautes, he leaue behind him the women, and the impotent old men, in Scicil, and he himselfe with the force of his army, and the lustiest youthes of all the companie: shou sayle into Italy.
Where he should first go seeke Sybillas den, by whose direction he should be brought vnto him into the fields called Elysij, or fieldes of pleasure, where he should be enfourmed of all the race of his posteritie, and learne the euentes of all warres that shoulde shortly befall him.
Wherfore Aeneas then obeying his fathers commaundement: builded a citie in Scicill named Acestes, and there made a Colonye of women, and old men that were vnfit for warre, and him self with the strength of his army taketh his viage towards Italy.
Therwhiles, Neptunus at the entrea+ty of Venus maketh the sea calme, whylst Aeneas sayleth.
In this goodly calmnesse Palinurus the stearesman fallyng a sleape: is cast helme and all into the sea, whose turne Aeneas supplieth.
AEneas on his way this whyle with shippes the seas did sheare, Amids the working waues of Northen wynde full rough yt were, Assured now to passe, and backe full oft he kest his eien
To Didos woful wals, on euery side that now did shine With flames of burnyng bright, what kindlyd hath so great a fier, The cause vnknowen it is, but wondrous feates in feruent yre, Is wrought by woman kinde, whan breach of loue hath made them mad: Thus pensiue passe the Troians from that sight and token sad.
Whan to the déepe their ships were come, and now on neither side Appeares no land, but seas and skies about them broad are spide: showre aboue his head there stoode, all dusky blacke with blew, Both night and storme it brought, straight the waters darke their hew.
Him self the Lodesman Palynure from puppe at stern on hie Alack, why hath these clouds so thicke encompast thus the skie? What workst thou father Neptune now? he sayd, and therewithall He bids them trusse their tackels, and with ores to labour fall, And sailes to léeward set, than thwart the wind he kest about, And thus he spake Aeneas prince of might and corage stout.
If god him self, as now this wether stands, wold say to me, To fetch Italia land, yet wold thinke it could not be.
So woorke these waiward windes, and from by west the tempest grimme Doth rise with boistous noise, and aier with cloudes encloseth dimme.
Nor striue no more wée may, nor if wee list wée can come there.
Since fortune therefore doth preuaile, let vs with fortune beare, And turne where fortune calls, not far it is (as suppose) Vnto thy brother Erix coast and hauons of Sicil woose, (If in mind my wonted course of starres do well retaine.)
Aeneas gentil said, In déede sée thée striue in vaine With labour al this while, and so me thinke these windes require.
Turne thou therto thy sailes, is any lond to me more déere? Or where shuld my wery ships more wishe to set at rest?
And where my father Anchises bones entombed lyen in chest? He said, and towards hauons anon they make, and windes at west Doth blow them through the déepes: the chanell swift their nauy driues, And glad at last on their acquainted shore their ships ariues.
And from the mountain top, with meruell great to sée them fléete, Acestes hasting ran, his contrey ships at shore to méete.
All hunterlyk, in hide of boystous beare, with dart in hand, His father (flood Crinisus him begat in Troian land.
Dame Troy his mother was, his worthy stock ful stout he bare.
He bad them welcome backe, and ioyfully with mountayne fare He did them entertayne, and fréendly comfort after care.
The morning next, whan first the dawning starrs expulsed were, And cleare the day began, Aeneas out from euery where Assembled al his mates, and into counsell did them call.
Than from a banke on hie, he thus pronounced to them all.
You mighty Troians, from the blood of great gods that descend, This time is comen about a perfit yere is now at end, Since whan my father Anchises blessed bones were put in ground, And mourning altars for his holy relikes wée did found.
And now the day (if do not mistake) approcheth nere: That vnto me shal euer dolefull be, and euer dere, Since gods hath pleased so: if this day were cast a land, Among the saluage Moores, or on the shores of Sirtes sand, Or caught on Greekish seas, or in Micena town a slaue: Yet pay my yerely vowes wold with pompe of dueties braue, And gifts in feastful gyse on altars large wold aduaunce.
Now here in hauen wée be, among our fréends, not by no chaunce, But by the gods (I trust) of purpose wrought, and for the nones, To worship here my fathers blessed dust, and precious bones.
Come on therefore, let euery man set furth these honors pure With mirth on euery side, that of good windes we may be sure.
And as yerely now these offringe dayes to him do make, So whan my citie builded is, in temples he shal take.
For euery ship Acestes giues to you of oxen twaine,
With charge your selfs to chere, set out your contrey gods agayne, And with our host Acestes gods to feasting sée you fall: In worship of this day, let vs reioyce with corage all.
Moreouer, whan the morning ninth to mortall men doth spring, And sunne with glistring beames the world agayn to sight doth bring, For prises proud to striue, wil prouoke the Troian fléete.
And who so wrastleth best, or best can ronne with force of féete, Or surer driues a dart, or archer best his bowe can drawe, Or fighting dares combat, with boystous baggs of lether rawe: Rewards shal set furth, and prises méete for euery matche.
Be present all, and he that best deserues the best shall catche.
Say all Amen, and crown your heads with bowes of Laurell gréene, So speaking on his head he set his garlond freshe beséene.
So Helimus, so king Acestes doth, (ful graue of age) So child Ascanius doth, and after him both man and page.
He from the counsel came with thousands thicke in myghty throng, Vnto his fathers tombe, in middes of all his princes strong.
Two bolles of blessed wine in solempne guise he kest on ground, And milke in basons twaine about the tombe he powred round, And twaine of sacred blood: than all the graue he spred and layd With flowres of purple hewes, and thus at last ful loud he prayd.
All haile blessed father mine, yet ones again all hayle: From death preserued twise, but nought to me can that preuayle.
Thy bones worship here, vnto thy soule mote glory be.
My luck was not Italia fatall féeldes to finde with thée, Nor Tyber flood (where euer it is) could we togethers know.
Thus talked he, whan from the tombe at secret caue by lowe, serpent great did slyde, with circles seuen of mighty sise, Along the graue he drew with foldings seuen in compaswyse, Embrasing soft the tombe, and tombling soft on the altars rolde, His back as azure blew, bespotted gay with specks of golde, And glosse of burning skales, as in the clouds with diuers hewes Against the sunne, the rainbow red in thousand sortes renewes.
Aeneas with that sight astoynyd was, but he along, Came lagging forth in linkes, and all the deynty meates among He tasted euery dishe, and home againe in hermeles wyse, Returning tooke his tombe, and was not seen again to ryse.
So much the more his fathers tombe he plied with offrings than.
For what it was, or how therof to thinke he could not skan.
If priuat ghost it were, or sprite that in that mountaine dwells, Or seruant from his father sent, but slaughters downe he fells, Of sheep in number fiue, and fiue of swyne ful large of syse, And mighty hefers blacke in number fiue, as is the gyse.
And wines in bolles he shed, and on the mighty soule he cried, Of great Anchises ghost, and sprite that ouer ground was spied.
His mates also ful glad, as euery man was sped of store, Their offringe presents brought and laded altars more and more, And hefers down they slew, and som by rowes their pans of brasse Did set to seeth in sight, and down they spred them selues on grasse, On vmbles fat they féede, and broche, and broyle, and time they passe.
And now the ninth desired day was come with morning bright,
And Phoethons horses faier had mounted vp the sonne to sight, And by the fame, and for Acestes worship round about The contreys al were come, and shores they fill with ioyfull rout To sée the Troyan lords, and some in minde themselfs to trye.
First prises great in sight, aloft a banck, aduaunced hye,
Were set amids them all, thrée footed bolles of precious mold, And crowns and garlonds gay, for them that win the wager shold.
And poudryd purple robes, and armor gorgeous glistring bright, And talents great of gold, and plenty plate of siluer pight.
With glée the game begins, the trompet blows with noise on hight.
First vessels foure, that chief elected were from al the fléete,
Come forth to coape with ores of hugy weight as matches méete.
Syr Mnesteus his galeon swift whose name was Pistrin, driues, Syr Mnesteus Italian prince, whence Memmus lyne deriues.
Syr Gias than with hugy monster ship Chimera calde, cities worke she was, with rancks of rowers treble walde, And Troian youth with triple tyre of ores did shoue the same.
Sergestus than, from whom the house of Sergis drawes the name, Centaurus him did beare (that galée great).
But Scilla blew Cloantus brought: from whence thy race (o Romain Cluent grew.
Far out in seas there stands a rocke against the fomy shore, That sometime vnder water lyeth with surges beaten sore, Whan stormes of winter wind encloseth starrs in cloudy skies: But smoth in calme it lieth, and in the middes thereof doth rise pleasant plain of féeld, where often Mewes, and birds of seas Do kéepe their haunting walk, and sunne their fethers whan thei pleas.
Aeneas there aduauncing set a signe of braunches gréene, marke of oken bows, that of the boatmen might be séene, To know their turning place, and courses long from whence to fold.
Eche man by lot their standing tooke, and glistring bright in gold: The gorgeous capteins stood, on hatches hie in garmentes gay.
The rest of youth with crownes of garlonds greene in due aray, Their necks and shulders shine with oyles annointed naked bare, On settels down they sit, their ores in hands prepared are, Their armes ententiue bent, whan at the signe they shal begin.
Their harts for ioy doth hop, and fear doth flap their brests within, And gréedy pride of praise, and feruent loue renown to win.
Than whan the blast of trompet first doth sound, thei al arise
Atones, and from their bounds they breake, their clamors perce the skies, Their stroks at ones thei strike, the fomy waters through thei cliue, The stremes resisting breake, and with their ste~mes the seas they sliue, Their ores with labor creaks, by strength of armes themselfs thei driue.
Not headlong half so swift, doth coursing stéedes bestys their héeles, Whan for their wager fast with all their force thei flye with whéeles.
Nor charet gyder non more fre on féeld doth let them slip, Or slacker shakes his raines, or louder them doth lash with whip: Than with the shoutes of men that clap their hands, and parties takes, The cries encreasing rise, that euery wood with sounding shakes, The noyse repulsed ronnes from banck to banck, and through the shores The voices broken ben, and hill to hill rebounding rores.
Before them al sir Gias first escapes through al the throng, And first to seas he flies with noise, and him Cloanthus strong Pursues at hand, and better was with ores, but sluggish kéele And mast vnweldy lets.
Than after him euen hard at héele, Centaurus preasing glides, and Pistris her doth equal matche, Thei striue with sturdy strokes, and formost place they seke to catche.
And now Centaurus gets the vauntage, now doth Pistris win: Now iointly both, with side to side, and equal spéede they spin.
And now approching néere the rock they were, and marke thei held, Whan Gias victor prince, (of conquest proud) the land beheld.
And as from chanel depe his barge to land he wold haue hied.
Why roust away so wyde? take here say, loue nie the shore, Fetch me this left hand land, and on these rocks let beate thine ore.
Let others kéepe the déepe, he said, but fearing rocks, and sholdes, Menetes stil at sterne his hand on helme to seaward holdes.
Where yet astray so wide?? yet (whan bid thée) fetche the stones, Sir Gias on Menetes cried and cald, and (lo at ones) He séeth Cloanthus come, euen hard at back, and formost glide, He through the roaring rockes, and vnderneth sir Gias side Did sheare his lefthand way, betwene them twaine, and swift anon Escapes them both, and suer in seas beyond the marke is gon.
Than verily for feruent wo, the yong mans bones did glowe,
(Forgetting worship all, and that he was his helpe at helme,) Yet hedlong down he threw, and him in seas did ouer whelme.
Him self to sterne he stept him self his maisters roume supplies, Exhorting men with noyse, and fast to shoreward helme he wries.
But whan (good aged man) Menetes up was cast on brim, From botom deepe of seas, and in his germentes wet did swimme, He caught the rocke on hie, and on the drie land there he sat.
The Troians had good game, and sporting al they laught therat, Whan first in seas he fell, and whan he rose and flat did fléete, And whan to pourge his gorge he kest vp floodes of falt onswéete.
Than hope and comfort kindlid is vnto the twaine behind.
Sir Mnesteus and Sergestus strong, they both with burning mind: Wold passe sir Gias by, (that hindrid is) and passe they do, Sergestus first the place doth take, and rock approchith to, And yet not formost al, nor al her kéele hath forhand wonne, But part before, for half with her doth Pistris striuing ronne.
But kindling fast his mates on euery side sir Mnesteus steeres.
From man to man he steppes, and chafing vp their corage chéeres, With loude exhorting noise.
Now now ({quod} he) with might and maine, Now chéerely stur your ores, now al your force do you constraine.
Hectors worthy péeres, whom at Troys extreme decay, Did matche to be my mates, and chose with me to take our way, Expresse me now the might yt somtime brought vs through ye streames, And sturdy waues of seas, and sondry gulfes of Greekish realmes, séeke not now the chief, nor of this game renown to bost, (Albeit O), but let it go where Neptune fauours most.
liuely laddes of noble kind, Let neuer man for shame behold vs last to lag behind.
Now for our contreys loue, (if any thing your hartes reuiues) Now pull or neuer pull.
They than at ones all for their lieues, Laid on with lusty strokes, the brasen puppe with plucking quakes, With strength of arms they striue, that skudding furth the stem it strakes The land aloof withdraws, than panting breath doth beat their lims, Their mouths of moistur dry, on streming swet their bodies swims.
Fortune also to them desirid luck and honour sent, For as Sergestus (mad in mind for hast) in turning bent Too néere the shore, and straighter wold haue cut the shorter space: Among the stones he stack (vnlucky man) in parlous place.
The rockes therwith they shoke, and on the craggy pointed pikes Their ores with crashing breake, kéele on ground with danger strikes.
The botemen rise with noise, and loude with cries the~ selues they let.
And proppes, and pykyd poales, with hurlyburly great they get.
And some their broken ores, in péeces sléeting vp they fet.
But Mnesteus reioysing than, and proud for this mischaunce, With cluster swift of ores, and windes at wil that did aduaunce: Al groweling through ye seas he skouring ronnes, and through the déepes The waues he smothly cuttes, and swift his way on water swéepes: Most like a Doue, whom chaunce distourbyd hath from pleasant rest, That in some corner close within some house, doth keep her nest, Affraid she stertith first, and flushing loud she flappes her winges, That all the house resoundes, than vp to skies aloft she springes, And fast to field she flies, where gliding soft in aier aboue: She sheares her tender way, and wing for hast doth neuer moue.
So Mnesteus, so Pistris makes her way with might extréeme, So slides she through the seas, and so with force to flye they séeme.
And first Sergestus strong, that on the rock did yet remayne, He leaues him struggling there, and calling helpe full oft in vaine, Among the sholdes, and glad with broken ores to lerne to créepe.
Than Gias, than Chimera ship her self that monster steepe, He ouertakes, (for of her maister late she spoyled was) And now remaynes there non but sir Cloanthus last to passe, Whom fast he doth pursue, and hard at hand he hath in chase, With power and pith he pulles, and towardes him he draws a pace.
Than noyses dubbled béen, and shoutes of friendes exaltyng cries.
Prouokyng foorth with prayse, that vp to heauen the clamours flies.
They proude of former prayse, their honour won they will not lose.
And if they should, no longer than to liue they do dispose.
Those other fortune feedes, they thincke to win for win they may.
And with the prise (perhaps) or half therof had gon theys way: Had not Cloanthus to the seas his handes abroad displayed, And cald his gods for help, and thus to them full loude he prayed.
Gods that empier kéepes on seas, whose kyngdoms here strake, Vpon this water shore to you myne altars will make.
white elected Bull vowe to giue with seruice braue, And cast his fleash in fluddes, if myne honour now may saue.
And plenty pure of wynes, will to you in waters throwe.
He spake that word, and him beneth in botoms deepe by lowe, The god Portunus heard, and virgin rout of Mermay des all:
And ladies bright that daunsing liues in seas with bodies tall.
Him self his mighty hand to send her furth did set behinde.
So did the noble water Nymphes, she swifter than, than winde: And swifter glaunsing smooth than arow glidyng goeth from dow, To land she leapt, and sauf in hauen her self she did bestow.
Aeneas than eche man in order due let call by name, And sir Cloanthus victor chief by Heraldes did proclame.
And crowne of Laurell gréene about his browes himself he set.
Than giftes for euery ship, three hefers large he bids to fet, And plenty great of wines, and talents fayre of siluer bright.
But specially the capteins all with due rewards he dight.
mantell riche to him that wan the chief was giuen of gold, Whom purple borders broade enuironned with diuers fold, And wrought therin there stands a princely child of precious face, That in the woods with Dart in hand both Hart and Hinde doth chace.
All liuely, breathyng like, whom, fallyng downe from Ioue on hie:
His kéepers waylyng stand, and handes abroad to heauen they hold In vayne, and barkyng noyse of dogges against the cloudes do skold.
But he that second place by doughty deedes deserued had: harneys coat to him with heauy hookes of gold bestad, harneys coat he gaue, whom he him self in battell broyle Did vnder Troian walles from Demoleus brest dispoyle.
That worthy gift he had, and strong defence in armes to weare.
Skant yemen twain with shoulders ioyntly set the same could beare, So sondrie folde it was, but Demolee him self alone, Was wont therin to hunt the straglyng Troians one by one.
Than for the third renown, two caudrons great he gaue of brasse, And siluer cuppes, with signes of stories old engrauen that was.
And now rewarded all, eche man full proude in best aray, They went with garnisht heads, and bare theyr gifts galanta gaye.
Whan from the parlous rocke, with much a doo to skape the same, (Besides his losse of ores, and of a ranck of rowers lame) With laughter great of men, his prayselesse ship Sergestus brought, In maner like, as whan some serpent (by some banck vnsought) Is brused by some whéele, that ouerthwart his backe hath past.
Or pilgrim passyng by, with stroke of stone welnere hath brast, In vayne he séekes to flée, and wriglyng wreathes his limmes about,
His angrie half on broke, and hissing neck he launchith out, All bright with burning eies, and though his limping half him holdes: He knittes him great in knobbes, and in him self him self he foldes.
Non otherwise, and like, with féeble ores his ship did stéere, Yet saile he makes with wind, and into hauen approcheth cléere.
Aeneas to Sergestus gaue reward of duety there, Reioysing for the ship, and for the men that sauid were.
woman him was geuen, a seruant good to weaue and spinne, And sucking boyes a payer, of giauntes kind, her pappes betwinne.
Than good Aeneas went (whan all this matche dischargid was:)
Into a goodly field, that ouerspred was all with grasse,
Whom woodes and crookid hilles on euery side did compas round, And in the mids a vale ther lay, and pleasant plaine of ground, Where he with thousands thick did make for plaies a seemely plat, And in the mids of al, in stately seat, as prince he sat.
Here they that lyst to ronne, and trie themselfes with force of féete, With gifts he them prouokes, and settes before them prises méete.
On euery side they came, both men of Troy and Sicill land, Eurialus and Nisus first.
Eurialus a springold fresh of youth, and beauty cléere, And Nisus that of al mankind had him in loue most déere, And yong Diores, of king Priams blood a princely childe.
Panopes than, and Helimus, of Sicill, striplings twaine, That hunters were in woods, and men of old Acestes traine And many more also there came, whom fame in darkenes hides.
To whom in middes of al, Aeneas thus his tale deuides.
Take this for certayn trueth, and in your minds conceyue it so, Not one of all this number here shall vnrewarded go.
For dartes wil them giue, with pointed stéele full bright a paier, And wrought with siluer fine to beare in hand a Pollar faier.
All men alike shal here rewarded be, saue onely thre, With bowes of Oliues gréene, as victors chief shal crownd be.
The first a palfray bright, with harneys gorgeous glistring braue, Shall get, the second for his paines a quiuer gay shal haue.
quiuer gay, with girdle broad of gold and arrowes fret, Embroydryd fine that is, and precious stones thereon are set.
The third shal with this Greekishe helme depart and be content.
Whan this was said, their place they toke, and right incontinent, At signe of trompet heard, their bounds they breake, and out they powre, As light as whirling winds, and to the marke in sight they skowre.
First and before all other bodies, nimble Nisus springs, More swifter yet than wind, and than the dint of lightnings wings, Next vnto him, but long aloof, in distance next of place, Doth Salius pursue, and after him a certain space, Eurialus the thirde.
And next Eurialus sir Helimus ensues, and ioyntly than Behold he flies, and héele to héele with him Diores ran, With elbow next and next, and if the race do long remaine: Is like to scape them all, or one to leaue in doubtful gaine.
And towards now the latter end they drew, and wery all, They ranne with panting breathes, whan sodenly did Nisus fall.
(Vnhappy man) where hefers had ben slaine by chaunce on grasse, And ground was slypper made by certein blood that shed there was.
There now the gentle lad, (whan conquest proud he had in hande) His legges he could not hold, nor stombling so, could longer stand, But groueling flat he fel and in the slime embrewd him vile.
Yet not Eurialus his fréend, did he forget that while: For quickly sterting he, sir Salius way with fote did stop, That headlong downe in dust he ouerturnid taile and top.
Eurialus than springing skuddid forth, and through his frend, With ioyful shoutes of men, he gets the chief at races end.
Ther, whan the lords were set, and eche came forth to claim their méedes: Sir Salius before them all, with noise exclaming cried, And praied his honours dew, that by deceit was him denied.
The peoples fauour helpes Eurialus, and comely teares, And vertue found in body fayer the greater grace it beares.
Diores eke, that third in wager was, doth him complaine What wrong sustaine he must, and al his course hath ron in vaine, If Salius, without desert, the first reward shall haue.
Than lord Aeneas said, you shal not nede to striue nor craue, Your prises certain ben, shall no man them from order stéere.
Yet let me rue the plight of mine vngilty frend so déere.
He sayd and than a Lyons heauy hyde of combrous fold, To Salius he giues, full rough of hear and pawes of gold.
Quoth Nisus than, if such rewards haue folkes that conquerd be, And pity shew thou dost to fallinge men, what giftes to me Shall worthy yelded be? that chiefest prise did first deserue: Had not enuious fortune me (as Salius made to swarue.
And as he talkid thus, his face he shewd with dirt defild, And body moist of mud.
The noble prince on him than smilde, And bad bring out a sheld, a target great ful coastly wrought, That by the Greekes somtime was for a gift to Neptune brought.
That semely gift he gaue vnto that gentil lad to beare.
Whan courses al was past, and al the gifts dispatched were,
Now he that manhood hath, or corage bolde doth beare in brest,
Shew forth himself, and with his armes in thonges let him be drest.
He said, and therwithall he setts rewardes of honours twaine.
crownyd bull, all clad with gold, shal be the victors gaine, sword and sheld to him that beaten is, shall comfort be.
Nor linger long they do, but straight with force full huge to sée, Aduancyth Dares furth, with murmour great of men extold, Alone somtime that durst with Paris fight in armour bold.
He, in the place where Hector most of might entombyd lies, Did ouerthrow sir Buten, giaunt byg of monstrous sise, That wrastlyngs all did winne, and Bebrix linage boasted strong.
Yet Dares him to death did ouerturne, and layde along.
Such one this Dares was, and hie on féelde his head he lifts, And shewes his shulders broad, and to and fro his armes he shifts, And braggs with boistous brawnes, and with his fists he beats the wind, matche for him they séeke, but through them al is non to find, That durst with Dares coape, nor ones his slings with fingers touche.
He proud therof, and thinking al mens might to him did couche, Before Aeneas féete he stood, and longer nothing staied, But by the horne in left hand toke the bull, and thus he sayd.
Thou goddesse son, if no man dare come furth to trie with hand, What end of wayting is? How long am thus bound to stand? Let me rewarded be, the Troians al did crye the same: And, yéeld vnto the man his promise due they do proclame.
Acestes there, as on a banck by chaunce he next did sit, With these rebukes of speche Entellus old at hart he smit.
Entellus, thou somtime of doughty knightes the capteyn chief, (In vaine) so goodly giftes to lose is it to thée no grief?
How canst thou suffer this? shall from thy side with triall non These worthy pryses passe? where is now our maister gon? Erix our maister good? where is become that gloriouse fame? That Sicill land did fill? and spoyles with thée recordes the same, Within thy halls yt hange, is it for nought thou knewst that game? He theronto: it is not sure for feare (you may well thinke) Nor loue of praise lacke, nor for no doubt therof shrinke.
But age me féeble makes, and slouthfull blood congealyd cold, Hath spent my former force, and dull doth make my carcas old.
If had now the strength sometime that was, and yet wherwith This yonglyng proudly braggs, if of those yeres had the pith: Not for the prise, nor for the bull, but gladly, and (onpraid) wold haue come, for gifts care not for.
Whan he thus said, He brought before them al, of baggs onweldy, matches twaine, And threw them down in sight, wherwith somtime in battail plaine Syr Erix wonted was to giue combat, and hand to hand Against all men to striue, and sturdy strokes he did withstand.
Of backs of bulls seuen boistous hides All vnderlaid with lead, and stif of stéele they stoode besides.
Aboue al other wondrith Dares most, and doth refuse Such great onlawfull tooles, or in conflict the same to vse. Aeneas eke theyr massy wondrous weight, and endles fold, He vewd with maruell muche, and vp and down full oft he rold.
What if a man had séene the dredfull baggs, and wepons sore Of Hercules him self? in doolefull fight here on this shore? These tooles thy brother Erix than did beare, with these he stood Against syr Hercules most strong, here yet thou séest the blood, And braynes that broken were, thou séest how yet they ben enbrewd.
These wepons somtime (whan better blood my strength endewd) Was wont in vre to put, whan not as yet enuious age, Nor head with hoary heares my lusty corage did aswage.
But if this Troian Dares here, these tooles wil needes refuse: If so Aeneas please, and me Acestes wil excuse: Let vs be matchid méete.
Cast of thy feare, and thou of Troian baggs onburdend be.
Thus speaking, from his shulders twain he kest his garments al.
And bare with myghty bones, and mighty ioyntes of membres tall,
And sinows great in sight, among them al he stood full stout.
Than baggs of meaner matche Aeneas prince him self brought out, And eche with equall weyght and hands of both, he bound and drest.
Vpright forthwith they stand, and face to face, aduauncing prest, Their arms to heauen they heaue, void of fear they throw their slings, Eche one from others dints their heads ful boistous backward wrings, And strokes in strokes thei mixe, and hands in hands, and fiers they fight, That one with lusty leggs, and fresh of youth in shifring light, The other huge in heyght, and large of limmes, but mouing flowe, His trembling knees him letts and troblid breath doth panting blowe.
Full many a wound is geuen betwen them twain with leaden lomps, And many a stroke in vaine, and on theyr rybbs full thyck it thomps.
Theyr sides within the~ sounds, loude their brests wt bobbings rings, And styl their armes they stur, about their browes the buffets flynges, About theyr eares, crakyng both theyr iawes their weapons swings.
Entellus heauy standes, and in his place onmouid bydes, With armes and watchyng eyes, and for the strokes defence prouides.
But he, as one, that with some engin worke doth siege a towne, Or towre or castle strong, and long thereat is beatyng downe, And this way now, and that way nowe he séekes, and entries all Assautes with sondry sleyghtes, and faylyth yet to breake the wal. Entellus rowsing than, his ryghthande bent on hye dyd lyft: He from the stroke that came, with good foresight and bodye swift Aduoiding shranck for fear, and from the dint thereof declinde.
Entellus mist his marke, and al his force he lost in wind, And ouer that, himself, with heauy peyse and heauy sound, All groueling flat he fell, and with his limmes he spred the ground.
Non otherwise, than whan some auncient oke and ouergrown, From mountayn top on hie, by vnderminyng down is thrown.
The Troians rise for ayde, so doth the youth of Sicill land, To heauen the cries ascend, and first to him with helpyng hand Acestes swiftly runnes, and from the ground his freende he takes, Of equall age, and in his hart for him great mone he makes.
But nothyng slacke for this, nor with his fal one whit affryght, This valiant knight vpstood, and fiercer yet renewes his fight: And forceyng preaseth foorth, and wood for wrath his strength vpsteres, Than shame prouokes his might, and manhood felt of former yeres, And headlong Dares down, through all the field, he dashyng dynges,
And now the right hand stroks, and now the left hand sends the slinges, Nor time, nor rest ther is, but as a stormy shoure of hayle, On houses ratling falls: so doth this knight with force assayle, With thondrings thomping thick, and wery Dares wretch on soyle With both his armes he bumpes, and vpside down doth tosse and toyle.
Than lord Aeneas wold no longer wrath shuld in them fret, Nor more Entellus bitter mood on rage he wold haue set.
But end of fighting made, and tyeryd Dares vp dyd take, And soft with gentill speche in comfort thus to him he spake.
Vnhappy man, what fonde outrage hath thus possest thy minde? stronger force than thine, and Gods against thée dost not finde? Giue place to god, he said, and with his word the batell brake.
Him dragging weake his legges, and to and fro his head did shake, And casting much at mouth, and cloddrid blood with téeth among, His trusty mates vptooke, and bare to shyps a way from throng.
And than commaunded came, and sword and helmet did receaue, And to Entellus dyd the bull and fame of combat leaue.
Than bragging proud in mynd, and of his bull conceiuyng ioye: goddesse son behold, and you ({quod} he) ye men of Troy.
What strength in lusty yeares somtime had now iudge in me, And from what death your Dares taken is, now shall you sée.
He spake that word, and right afront before the bull he stood, That there for gift was set, and vp the slinges with corage good In righthand marking held, and iust betwene the hornes at ones He strake, and brake the braines, and al in peces droue the bones.
The beast is ouerthrown, and groueling dead on ground it quakes.
This better soule to thée for Dares death victor send, (O Erix here of bagges, and al min arte make an end.
For wagers he prouokes, and settes before them giftes in sight.
And from Sergestus ship aduauncing huge in heyght a mast, He hanges a pigeon there, and by a cord he made her fast.
marke for men to shote, and where their darts they shuld direct.
Assembly great ther came, and by theyr lottes they were elect, In brasen helmet cast, and first of al with ioyfull cryes, Vnto Hippocon worthy lad by draught the lot doth rise.
Next whom sir Mnesteus, that late at seas was victor séene,
Syr Mnesteus with crown and garlond gay of Olyue gréene.
Eurition was third: (thy brother déere thou noble knight Pandarus, that didst somtime the leage asonder smight, And first commaunded didst, among the Greekes thy wepon throwe) Acestes last of all, and last in helmet lay by lowe.
Him self also with hand, the yong mens game did not disdayne.
Than bending al their bows, their corage great they do constrayne, And ech to serue him self from quiuer draweth his tooles amaine.
And first from sounding string along by heauen his arow driues Hippocon lusty lad, and swift therwith the skies he cliues, It lightes apace, and in the midds the mast it stack and staied.
The trée with trembling shooke, and of the stroke the bird afraied, Did flickring flushe her winges, and noyse there riseth round about.
Than Mnesteus his bowe to drawe, forthwith with strength stood out.
And stretching hand aloft, his dart and eye dyd leuell right, Yet could not he (good man) for all his art the culuer smight.
But hyt the hemping corde, and of the knot the bandes he brast, Wherby the byrd was bound, and by her fote did hang at mast.
She toke the wind forwith, and to the cloudes full fast she flewe, And euen that time (as he his bowe and dart directing drewe) Eurition, and for his brothers help in heauen, he cried: The byrd he sawe was lose, and sporting her in skies he spied.
Yet markyng well with eies, and stedfast hand, in cloudes aboue, He quickly brake her play with sodein stroke, and slew the Doue, That tumblyng down she fell, and in the starres her life she laft, And dead she came to ground, and in her body brought the shaft.
Who nerethelesse his dart to hurle in ayer did him distrayne.
And shewde his former might, and of his bowe to proue the sound, There sodenly their eyes a wondrous monster did confound, And token sore of thinges, as afterward the end did teach, And all to late for nought their fearful songs did prophetes preache.
For as in tender cloudes his arow swift from him did flie, In sight it caught a fier, and flamyng forth it went in skie.
And wasted thinne in wind, as oftentimes we thinke do slyde, The fixed starres of heauen, with drowpyng tayles along that glyde.
Astoynid al they stood, and on theyr Gods aboue they prayed, Sicilians and Troians both, nor he him self denayed
Aeneas peerelesse prince, to take that same in signe of grace.
But glad with great rewards, he did Acestes thus embrace.
Most noble father deere, (for by these tokens well sée, The mighty kyng of heauen for thy good will doth honour thee,) Thou shalt haue here a gift of old Anchises fréend of thine, drinkyng bolle of gold, that portraied is with figures fine.
Which vnto him somtime, Cisseus, great of Thrace the kyng, In token gaue of loue, for euermore with him to bryng.
So spake he, and with Laurell greene his temples twayne he tied, And loude before them all Acestes victor chief he cried.
Nor good Eurition did his preferment ought enuie, Though he alone it were, that brought agayne the byrde from skie.
Aduaunced next with giftes was he that cord a sonder brast, And last of all was he that with his arow strake the mast.
Than lorde Aeneas, ere these matches all dissolued were, Epitides to him, Ascanius mate and kéeper there, He calde, and roundyng thus to him he spake in secret eare.
Go bid Ascanius (if by this time he the childerns crue Assembled hath with him, and horses put in order due) Before his graunsire here let him bring out his bandes in rowe, For worship of this feast, and let him self in armour showe.
Dispatche ({quod} he) with spéede, the people than he bids deuide, And broader spreade them selues, and made a lane both longe and wide, Than come the childern foorth, and proude before their parents sight In order séemely shyne, on barbed coursers brideled bright, Whom for their fresh aray, and comly marchyng through the felde, The youth of Sicill land, and Troians all with ioy behelde.
Eche one as was their gyse, with rounded hear, and garlond bandes, And horny dartes a payer, with poynted stéele they bare in hands, With quiuers light at backes and down their breasts in diuers folde, About their gorgets runnes, the rollyng cheines of wreathed golde.
Thrée bandes of horsemen were, and capteyns thrée their bands did gide, And rankes of riders three, and childern twelue on euery side In glisteryng armour went, with maisters like and equall peeres, One ward of stronger youth, whom trimme triumphant fearce of yéeres, Did Priam yong conduct (thy noble childe Polites tall, That of his gransirs name encrease Italians shortly shall.)
valiant steede him bare, bespotted whyte, of kinde of Thrace, And white his fote before, and lifting white his loftly face.
Another trowpe the was, that litle Atis giding lad, The litle Atis, whom Ascanius smal for darling had.
From whence the line at Rome of Atis name doth now procéede.
Than last of all, and most of beauty bright, and precious wéede, Ascanius himself on palfray gorgeous borne aboue, Whom vnto him somtime Quéene Dido gaue for pledge of loue.
The rest of youth, and such as were of old Acestes trayne: On horses fayer they rode.
The Troians them did chere, and did receyue with wondrous ioye, And in theyr minds conceyue resemblaunce old of former Troy.
Whan mustrid all they had, and all the feeld had compast round, And vewd Anchises tombe, they ioynyd al on equall ground, Epitides to them with noyse and whipping gaue a sound.
They courfing brake theyr bands, and thrée from thrée disseuered all.
By matches half from half, and fast agayn they turne at cal, With wepons brest, to breast and compas round returning met, By coursings byckring braue, and race with race entangling let, Inuading skyrmishe wise, and lyke the face of battall fight.
And now retyre they done, now shew theyr backs in signe of flight.
Now turning throw their darts, now truce they make with hand in hand.
Like Labirinthus maze, that men report in Candi land, Is compast déepe in ground with sondry walls, and crokings blind, And thousand wandring wayes, and entries false for men to find, Where tokens non there be, nor skape can non that steppes astray, Such turnings them begiles, and so deceytful is their way.
Non otherwise, the Troian youth by coursings round about, Disporting chace them selfs, and windyngs weaue both in and out.
Lyke Dolphin fishes light, that for theyr pastyme daunsing swimme, In middes of depest seas, and play them selues on water brimme.
Thys kind of pastime fyrst, and custome boyes to learne at Baase, Ascanius whan Alba walls he made, dyd bryng in place.
And taught the Latines old, in solempne sorte to vse the same, As he sometime a child, with Troian youth had made that game.
The Albans than from thence with practise lyke theyr children taught, And thens hath perelesse Rome and most of might, that custome caught.
And for theyr contreys loue, with honor due this day it standes, And yet the name remaynes of Troyan boyes, and Troian bandes.
There fortune false to trust, did turne their case with chaunges newe.
For, as about Anchises tombe with playes the time they spent:
Dame Iuno down from heauen the Rainbowe read her seruant sent, Reuoluing former grief, and rancours old not yet from mind, Against the Troian fléete, and as she went she gaue her wind.
She swiftly bent her bowe, and through the clouds with thousand hewes, Full virginlike she falles, her new deuise onknown, to vse.
huge concourse she seeth, and compas wide she vews the strandes, How bare the hauons are left, and nauy dry defenceles stands.
But secret by them selfs, the Troyan wiues assembly kept, And for Anchises losse lamenting sore they stode and wept.
Beholding broad the seas: alas, alas, wretches we, So much of boistous waues remaines vs yet that wery be? towne to dwell they craue, and of the seas abhorre the payne, Eche one to other wayles, and all with one voice do complayne.
Dame Rainbowe subtile there, amidds them all her self did place, Her garmentes gay she left, and laid a side her goddesse face, And of Doriclus wife the likenes toke, a sober dame, That sometime great renown, and children bare of noble fame, And Beroe was cald, and thus to them she did proclame.
women misers most, whom hands of Greekes wold neuer kyll, cursid nation, whan of thée shall fortune haue her fill? What death, or mischief more are wée thus kept to bide at last? Sins Troy vproted was, now sommers seuen are comen and past, That we through seas and lands, and contreys all (the world besyde) To straungy starres of heauen, and endles streames wée wander wide, In séeking land that fléeth, and wée alway with surges tost.
Here is our contrey ground, here dwelles Acestes déere our host.
Why shuld wée hence remoue? who lets vs here our walls to bilde? former natiue soyle, contrey gods (in vaine exilde) Shall neuer Troy vpryse? shall citie Troian neuer be? Those Hectors holsome streames shall from henceforth neuer sée? Come on (good wiues) come burne with me these ships of luck vnkind.
For so Cassandra through my dreame apéering did me bind.
And gaue me burning brondes, séeke here ({quod} she) your Troian walls, Here lieth your contrey rest, this is the time that fortune calls, What néede wée longer looke? lo Neptunes altars foure on fier,
Lo god himself (you sée) with minds and might doth vs enspier.
Thus talkid she, and with a brond in hand ful fierce she sprang, With (whirling loof aloft) against the fléete the same she flang.
The rest amasyd were, their hartes astoinid stood with rage.
Than one among them all, dame Pirgo matrone most of age, King Priams nurse that was, and princely children vp did reare: Not Beroe ({quod} she) this woman is, you wiues sweare, Nor neighbor none of ours, behold what beauty bright deuine, What liuely sprite she beares, and marke me wel her glistring eyen, Her loke, her sounding voice, and of her pace the great estate.
left dame Beroe my selfe at home ful sicke but late.
Full sicke lamenting sore that she her self from vs alone, This day must absent be, and yeld Anchises worship none.
This spoken: Therwith the matrons first, with wauering minds began to dout.
And what betwene the loue of present land, and present rest, And fame of fatall realmes: they wot not which of them is best.
Whan lifting vp her self to clouds aboue with equall wings, In flight before them all, with bowe ful broad the goddesse springs.
Than verily with monsters wild affright, and mad for yre, They cry to burne their ships, and from their tentes they reaue the fire.
Som spoile their altar piles, and burning bows, and slicks, and brandes, Abourd the ships they spréede, vpleapith flame with loosid bandes, On hatches, decks, and ores, and plancks anoyntid thicke on sides.
Vnto Anchises tombe, Eumelus post with panting rides, And shews the shipps are brent, and they them selues beholding spie, The sparcklings rising broad, and blustring smoke to sprede in skie.
And first Ascanius as coursings still he kept and plaied, He toke the campe in hast, that with vprore was all dismayed, Nor for their liues his maisters him could hold, or backeward send, What sodeyn rage is this? where now ({quod} he)? what do ye entend? neyghbors, wretched wiues, your enmies host you haue not here, This is no Greek is he campe, you burn your own relief most dere.
Lo Ascanius your owne, and to the ground his helmet kest, Wherwith in bataill playes, he for disport that time was drest.
Aeneas eke with hast, and Troians, all therto them sped.
But stragling diuers wayes, through al the shores the women fled,
To woods, and mountayn caues, and holes of rocks they miching ronne, And créeping hide them selfs, repenting foule theyr worke begonne.
Abhorring sight of heauen, and on theyr fréends they thinke and quake, With better chaunge of mind, and from their brest dame Iuno shake.
But not therfore the flames, nor burning rage the lesser spréedes, But catching still encrease, it more and more preuailing bréedes.
And spitting spewes a smoke, whom vapor wild of pitche and towe, And dropping timber féedes, and mischief close in kéele doth growe, Nor might of men can helpe, nor water floodes that on they throwe.
Aeneas from his shulders than his garments tearing brast, And calde his gods for helpe, and broad to heauen his hands did cast.
Almighty Ioue, if not as yet all Troians from thy mind Reiected ben to death, if seruice old of poore mankynd Not vtterly be lost: now saue these ships from burning fier.
Good father now, preserue these Troyan goodes, and small desier, Or thou thy self (which one thing yet remaynes) with lightning fell Here whelme me down to death, if deserue, and dryue to hell.
Skant spoken wer these words: whan ratling storme not sene before, And raine downraging falls, and thonders thick doth rombling rore, That tremblith hills and fields, down rolle the skies in gushing shoures, And troublous water streames from al the heauen the tempest powres.
That ships therwith are fyld, and burning bourds are quenchid quite, And still descending driues, and on the fléete with force doth smyte, Tyll smoke was ceassyd al, and all the ships from plage was kept.
So sauid al they were (by gift of god) but foure except.
But lord Aeneas whom this great mischaunce did pinche at brest, With heaps, of hugy cares, now this, now that, was sore opprest, Reuoluing much in mind, shuld he remayn in Sicill lend: Forgetting destnies al, or still go seke Italia strond.
Than father Nautes old, whom goddesse Pallas learnid had, With artes of worship great, and famous name of wisdom sad: These answers him did tell, which either gods eternall yre, Or fatel destnies wrought, or fortunes course did so requyre, And thus with fréendly speche Aeneas mind he set on fire.
goddesse son, where destnies drawes and driues let vs go there, What euer it is, who conquer fortune wil, must fortune beare.
Thou hast Acestes here, of Troyan blood and stocke deuine, His counsell take to thée, and ioyne with him aduise of thine.
And leaue with him those people which thy ships can not receyue, And such as of thy great affaires no corrage doth conceyue, Both aged feble folks, and wiues of seas that wery be, And all that feareful is, or weake of strength shuld comber thée, Let them be chosen furth, and here on gods name citie frame, And of Acestes name, Acesta they shal call the same.
Incensyd so by this (for from his fréend this councell past) Than verily from care to care his mynd discoursyd fast.
And night with darknes dymme, the poles of heauen had vndercast.
That time his fathers face descendyng down, in vision cléere, From heauen appering came, and sodenly thus did him chéere.
My son, more déere to me than life sometime, whan life had, My son, whose vertues Troy doth trye, by destnies good and bad, Commaunded here come, from mighty Ioue in skies aboue, That comfort sent at last, and from the fléete did fire remoue.
Obey the counsells good, which faithfull Nautes the hath told, And for Italia land, pike out a youth of corage bold, To take with the to seas: an eger nation féers and tough Thou hast to vainquish there, and must subdue in batailes rough.
Yet first Auerna caue, and vnder grownd the dwellings grimme, Of Lymbo must thou sée, and dangers passe of darknes dymme.
And thens ascend to me, for (my son) am not in hell: Nor with no wickid kind of wofull ghostes haue to dwell.
But fieldes of pleasur pure, and Paradise, doth me retayne, With ioyfull sort of soules, in blisfull state that do remayne.
There Sibly pure, by offryngs black of beastes shal thée conduct, And there thine ofspring al, and fortunes al shal thée instruct.
And now farewel, for midnight moist her half cours hens doth wrethe, And dawning day with blast of horses, hote on me doth breathe.
He spake, and thinne from sight as smoke, in skies disperst he styed.
What now: where gost away? why dost thou shrynke? Aeneas cried.
Whom fléest thou thus? or who from swéete embracings vs withsta~des? Thus talked he, and from the dust he steres the stéepinge brandes.
And Troian sacred fier of Gods that euermore doth dure, And offrid simple floure, and frankinsens, in plenty pure: Strayt for his mates he calld, and first onto Acestes old Commandments great of Ioue, and what his father déere had told, He shewes before them all, and wher vnto his mind enclines.
Nor counsel long they make, nor good Acestes ought repines.
towne they measur furth, and wines and people there they plant Of baser hartes, deseruing worship small, for corage skant.
Them selfes their ships repare, and burnid bourdes anew restores, And cables méete they make, and shrowdes and sayles, strength of ores.
youth of number few, but liuely bluddes in batayll tough.
Therwhiles, Aeneas did the cities plat describe with plough, And houses laid by lot, here Ilion toures: here gates of Troy He sets: and of his kingdome new Acestes maketh ioy.
And market place he made, and lawes he taught and iudges gaue Than large and broad in sight right nere the starres, a temple graue To Venus founded is, in hiest place, and priest deuine To serue Anchises tombe, and sacred groue theron to shine.
And now nine dayes this people feasted had, and altars all Applied with offringes due, and sunne had made the sea to fall, And sound of pipling wind, eftsones to déepe their shipps doth cal: wondrous wéeping noise through al the shores is reisyd wide, And all that night and day they tween themselues embracing byde.
The matrones now themselues that of the seas were earst affraied, And dowted labours long, and of their strength dispairing staied, Now gladly go they will, and trauailes al susteine at seas.
Whom good Aeneas did his best with frendly spéeche to apeas, And wéeping did commend vnto Acest his kinsman déere.
Thrée Calues to Erix than, and to the stormes a lambe ful cléere, He biddes for offring kill: and cables loose through al the strandes.
Him self with garland freshe, and crownet gréene of Oliue bandes, Aduauncing stood in ship, and bolle in hand he held on hie, And flesh in fludds he threw, and wines in plentie kest in skie.
Behind them blowes a coole, and wind at wil them furth doth driue, His mates thei skomme the fome, and saltsea brine to turne they striue.
But Venus in this while, whom care for Troians sore did straine, To Neptune straight she came, and thus to him began to plaine.
The gréeuous wrath of Iunos brest, whom no reuenge can slake, Compells me (Neptune) now to thée, all humble sute to make, Whom neither length of time, nor pity non, from rancor staies, Nor destnies order non, nor Ioue him self one whit she waies.
She thinks it not ynough the Troyans town to haue down torne, And all their last remaine with turmentes long almost forlorne,
The bones and pouder poore she persecutes, and all their broode She wold destroy, let her declare one cause of such a moode, Thy self can record beare, how in the waues of Lyby coast, What wild vprore she made, and seas and skies turmoyling tost.
With stormes of Aeolus her fréend, and all with labour vaine: So bold within thy kingdomes thus to do.
vile despite, lo yet of late how Troyan wiues in fume She made their ships to burne, and foule their nauy to consume, And leaue their kinred there, in contrey straunge onknown to bide.
There is no more, but let vs now (I pray thée) saufly ride In sailing through thy seas, let vs arriue where Tyber flowes, If graunted things are, if destnies vs those kingdomes showes.
Than spake Neptune, that hie seas doth control with lordly browes Good reason Venus is, that in my kingdomes thou be bold, From whence thy linage leades, haue deseruid eke of old.
Full oftentimes ere this, both seas and skies vnkindly rage bridling couchid haue, and madnes wood did oft aswage.
Nor lesse my care on land, as al the streames of Troy can tell, Was for Aeneas thine, whan fierce Achilles did compell His throngs in field to fal, whan thousands thick down tombling dead He vnder Troyan walls with slaughter wood did trampling tread.
That brokes and riuers cried, whan peoples heaps their chanels fild, Nor fall to seas they could, nor find their waies for bodies kilde.
from Achilles than, Aeneas thine, full sore beslad In fight, (that neither force with him nor goddes indiffrent had) Conueid away by cloude, whan péece from péece wolde haue torne.
(Min own handworck that was) the walls of Troy so fals forsworne.
And now also that mind with me remaines: cast of thy dréede, In hauons where thou dost wishe he shal ariue right saufe with spéede.
One only man shall be, whom lost in déepe seas he shall séeke, One poll shal walke for all.
Whan he the goddesse brest with speaking thus had put from care, As prince his horses proud he cupling set and bound in chare, With fomy bridlyng bittes, and lowsing gaue them al the raines, Full smoth his charet slides, and blew sea brim it skantly straynes.
Down sinck the surging waues, and great sea swolne in thondry skies, Doth couche their waters close, from al the heauen the ratches flies.
Than sondry fourmes and faces shew them selfes, onweldy whales,
And mossy Glaucus grey, and mankinde monsters voyd of skales, And Pollantines, and armies broade of seales, and Dolphins blew, And Tritons blowe theyr Trumpes sounds in seas wt dropping flew.
Dame Thetis lefthand keepes, and daunce doth leade of Mermaydes all, And Ladyes bright, that leapyng liues in seas with bodies tall.
There lorde Aeneas secret minde a sodeyn ioy did fetche, He bids them reyse theyr Mastes, and all theyr sayles abroad to stretche.
Together to theyr tacles all they step, and slackyng lines, To Larbourd now they set, and now to Starbourd sayles enclines, And halyng hoyse theyr wings, that shrowdes hookes bowlines bends
As prince and pilot chief, syr Palinure his course doth beare, Before them all, and eche to marke at him commaunded were.
And now from heauen the drowpyng night her mid course nere had past, And folkes in slumber swéete, theyr wery limmes on rest had cast: And Mariners had layd them selues on hatches hard of barres: Whan lightyng swift, from skies, the God of steape did fall from starres, And brake the darcke of night, with glimsyng shade of fayned beames.
To thée (O Palinure and brought to thée right heauy dreames, Without desert, and on the puppe full hie his seate did take, Resemblyng Phorbas face, and vnto him these wordes he spake.
Fréend Palinure, lo how the tydes themselues conueys the fléete, This gale by measure blowes: an houre of rest to take is méete.
Lay downe thy head, and steale thy painfull eyes one nap of fléepe, will for thée my self supplie thy rowme thy helme to kéepe.
Whom aunswerd Palinure, skant liftyng eyes for slumber déepe: Know, not yet my seas? what? thinkst thou me so small of wit? To trust this fawnyng face? shall my lorde and prince commit, To this inconstant beast? should beléeue that monster wilde? So oft as with flattring seas, and skyes haue ben begylde? Such thyngs he spake, and holding hard at helme he cleauid fast, And still dyd serue the streames, and styll on starres his eyes did cast.
Behold, the God on hym a broppyng braunche of Lymbo pyt With deadly sléepyng dewe, on both his temples dashyng smyt.
And struggling to resist, his swymmyng eyes with sléepe opprest.
Skant first resoluyd were his wéery lymmes with sodeyn rest, And leanyng noddyd lowe: whan half the puppe with hym he drew, And rother, helme, and all, in myddes of seas he fallyng threw
Quyte hedlong ouer bourd, and callyng oft his mates in vayne.
The God than toke his winges, and thinne in wind he went agayne.
Yet nerethelesse therfore, with sauf conduct theyr fléete did pas, And carelesse ronnes theyr course, as god Neptunus promise was.
And now they entring were the straytes, Sirenes rockes that hight, parlous place sometime, and yet with bones of people whight.
Than breaking broad the fludds, the saltsea stones ful hoarce did sound, Whan lord Aeneas felt his ship to stray and mayster dround.
And toke himselfe the giding than therof in seas by night, Lamenting much in mind his fréends mischaunce and heauy plight, Palinure, that flattring seas and skies to much didst trust, All nakid on some strangy sand onburied lye thou must.
When Aeneas was come to Cumas, he went vnto Sibyllas den, where doyng sacrafice accordyng to the custome: he asketh counsel at the Oracle of Apollo, and there learneth both the dangers at hand, and the successe of future warres.
Misenus body which he found on the shoare he burneth, his furniture, and his spoyles he burieth vnder the next hill, which therof was called Misenus.
From thence, by direction of Dooues, he was braught to the golden boughe, which beyng gathered, and hauyng appeased, worshipped the infernall gods with slayne sacrafice: by conduct of sibylla he goeth downe to hell, through the mouth of Auernus.
He findeth Palinurus wandryng about the lake of STYX, bycause his body was vnburied, and when sibylla had refused to take him ouer vnto the farther shore, which he requested: Aeneas putteth him in good co~fort wt exequies, and hope of honorable buriall.
Fro~ thence Aeneas passynge ouer styx, and castyng Cerberus in a sleape with a medcined soppe, takynge his iourney through the place of Infantes, and of such as were wrongfully condemned, and put to death vndeseruedly: he cometh vnto the seats of those, that through impaciencie of loue, had shortned their owne dayes, where espying Dido, when he would haue purged him self vnto her: disdaynfully she auoyded his sight.
Then departyng thence, he came to the habitation of those that were somtime famous in warre, where he saw Deiphobus torne, and rent with many wounds, and is there by him enformed by what cruell and shamfull meanes he came to his death.
Afterward, leauynge Tartarus on the left hand, and beyng by sibylla instructed in the punishments of the wicked: he approcheth nigh the walles of Pluto, and there sticketh vp the golden bough euen in the Queenes entrie, and from thence he proceedeth to the fields of the blessed, and is by Musaeus braught vnto his father.
There Anchises declareth vnto his sonne AENEAS the order, and succession of the Albane, and Romane kynges, and runnyng ouer the names of certen of the Romane nobilitie: cometh to the commendation of Iulius, and Augustus Caesars, and wonderfully extolleth Marcellus the sonne of Octauia, who was sodenly cut of by vntimely drath.
Then goyng forth out of the Iuery gate vpon the earth: visiteth his mates, and leauyng Cumas, sayleth to Caiera.
And at the last on Cumas coast Italia land attaines.
Their foreships al from seabourd tha~ they turne, and ankers Thei pitching laid a la~d, and al the crokid shores along (stro~g
Their ships in order set, out leapes the youth with long desier To tread Italia land, some séeke for séedes of lurking fier In secret vaines of flints, some breake the bedds of beastes onkind,
But good Aeneas to Apollos church, and temple towres, He went to séeke the secret caue of Siblies dréedfull bowres.
vaute of widenes wast, where mighty sprite, and mighty mind Apollo her inspires, that al thing knowes in secret kind.
And things that fatal ben he doth to her ful broad vnfold.
And now the sacrid groues they sée, and houses bright of gold.
By old report whan Dedalus from Minos kingdome fled, With bold attempt of wings he toke the skies hie ouerhead.
And Northward fast he slew, a passage straunge vnséen before, And lighting down at last, he stood a land on Cumas shore.
There he ariuid first, and there (O Phoebus bright to thée) Did consecrate his wings, and made a temple huge to sée.
Vpon the dores Androgeos death there stands, than yere by yere How Athens was compeld, (a wretchid thing), their children dere By couples seuen and seuen, both sonnes, and doughters bound in bandes, To send to slaughter vile, the pot with lotts there redy standes.
There Pasiphae was made, and next to her there stood the bull With tokens foule of loue, and how by stelth, in metall thinne She vnderlay that beast, with stinking lust of lothsome sinne.
And Minotaure there was, the mongrell vile of mixed kind, Inclosid kept in maze, where issue non there was to find.
There lay the labour sore, and wandring house of endles wayes, In corners croking darke, a wofull worke for them that straies.
But Dedalus, that pitie did the Quéenes outragious loue, Him self the craft did teache, and dangers all he did remoue,
By giding through the darke her passage blind by threde full fine.
And thou Icarus also among those workes deuine Hadst had no slender part, if sorowes him not letted had.
Two times in shining goold, thy drowing fall with hart full sad Thy father there beganne, and twise his hands for fainting fell.
These stories old, and things of former fame right long to tell They shuld haue ouervewd, whan (sent of purpose there before) Achates did returne, and brought the priest with head full hoare,
And Deiphebe she hight, and to the king these woordes she spake.
This time requirith not with gasing thus to linger there.
Now hefers seuen to kill, to serue the gods more wisdom were.
And seuen of chosen shéepe (as custome is) you shuld haue brought.
These things she spake, and they furtwith her iust commaundment wrought.
Than she the Troian lords into the temple gorgeous calles.
caue there is, cut out in rock, euen through the temple walles, Both huge and broad at mouth, a hundred vautes, a hundred doores, hundred roarings sound, whan Siblies answers beates the floores.
Before the same they stood, whan she the virgin close within, Diskried her self and spake.
Now doth ({quod} she) my tyme begin To learne at god, lo here comes god.
As she thus babling prates, All sodenly, with faces more than one, before the gates, And colours more than one, disfigurid wild she stood in traunce.
Her hear vpsterting stands, her trembling brest doth panting praunse.
Her hart outraging swells, nor mortallyke she lokes at last: Aboue mankind she speakes, whan of the god she felt the blast
Thou Troian thou? ({quod} she) and standst thou still? shall not this day One doore disclose it self tyl prayer come.
Whan she thus sayd, She silence made: than quaking cold in Troyans limmes affrayd
Phoebus, whom the painefull toyles of Troy did euer greue, Thou that sir Paris hand and dart (poore Troyans to releue) Directing didst conduct, and gauest Achilles mortall wound, Thus many mighty seas that mighty lands encompas round entryd haue by thée, through nations wilde, and parlous strands, Through coasts of mountayn Moores, and contreys close of Sirtes sands.
And now Italia shore (alwayes that shrancke) we touche at last.
Thus farfurth now haue we through dangers al our fortune past.
And you also your indignations great is time to end, You gods and goddesses eche one, whom Troy did ought offend With glory great of pryde, eke thou, (O sacred prophet trewe) That fortunes dost forsée, (I aske nothing but kingdoms due That destny doth me giue), Italia land let vs enioye, Our wandring gods to place, and relikes déere outcast of Troye.
Than I, to Phoebus cléere and to Diana, temples pure
Rewardes also to thée, and offrings great for thée shall stand Within my kingdoms all, and my self shall out of hand Enrolle thy sacryd lotts, and dities, déere of holy rymes.
My people them shal learne, and chosen men at standing times Shall consecratid be, thy mighty mind that shall expound.
Do thou this time thy self thy verses speake with perfit sound.
Nor write no line in leaues, lest whirling wind therwith may play, Confounding then from course, and lest in skies they fly their way.
But wrastling wild as yet, against the god in thentry large Dame Sibly mombling made, and strugling strong withstode the charge, If haply so she might the gods enforcing shake from brest: But he preuailing stil, with more and more her sprite oprest.
Her hart, her raging mouth, he taming stayed and fixed fast.
And now along the caue, a hundred dores were open brast Of proper strength, and through the vaute these answers out she cast.
thou that dangers great of seas at last hast skapid all, But greater things on land remaines for thée.
But sone repent they shal, and curse the time that brought them there.
Repent right sone they shal: wars, dredful warrs vprising growes, And Tyber flood see, with fomy blood how thick it flowes.
Eft sones of Troyan streames nor Greekish campes thou shalt not faile, And in Italia thée a new Achilles shal assail, That borne of goddesse is, nor from the Troyans Iuno stout Shal one where absent be, whan thou at néede extreme for dout, What nations of Italya land shalbe? what cities great? That thou that time for aide with humble sute shalt not entreat? The cause of all this wo, shall be a wife of forayne line.
Yet for these mischiefes all do thou not shrink, but bolder prease, Where thée thy fortune leads, thy chiefest helth and cause of peace, (Where least thou dost sespect) shal from a Greekish town apéere.
These words did Sibly speake, and rapt with spright in caue oncléere, Her compas crokyd songes, and doubtful rimes she belwing soundes, Inuoluing truth in darck, such bridling bittes and rauing boundes Apollo giues his préest, and close to preache he prickes her brest.
Whan first her pattring mouth and raging limmes were left at rest, Aeneas prince began.
No trauail new this is to me virgin pure, nor face of labour non vnfelt sée.
All this do conceiue, and in my mind considrid late.
One thing shal desire, (for here men say beginnes the gate Of great infernall king, and darcksome floodes by hell that fléete) Giue licens me to go to séeke and see my father swéete.
Vouchsaue to gide my way, and holy dores do open make.
Him from thousands swordes, and burning flames away did take.
These shulders, euen these shulders, through the foes did bring him out, He passage toke with me, with me al streames and lende about, And threatnings all of seas and tempestes all with wery payne, Aboue his age and strength, onwéeldy man, he did sustaine.
And now that this time before thy dore so méekely pray: He me commaunded thus.
Haue pity now of both vs tway sacred virgin pure (for thou maist all) nor here in vaine Diana thée hath set, on Lymbo woodes to rule and raine.
If Orpheus obteynid ones his wife from vnder ground: By singing swéete at harp, and striking stringes of plesant sound: If Pollux did his brothers death redéeme with his exchaunge, And went and came so oft, what shuld talke of Theseus straunge? Or strongest Hercules? my selfe from hie Ioue to discend.
These thinges he talked thus, and fast he held the altars end.
borne of blood of heauenly kind, Thou Troian duke, the way that leades to hel is light to find Both nightes and daies, the dore of Limbo black doth open gape.
But backward vp to clime, and frée to skies eftsones to skape, There worck, there labour is: few men whom equall Ioue did loue, Or vertue percing al, did to the starres aduaunce aboue, Could worck so great a worck that midwaies al ar compast wide
With desertes darck of woods, and slimy flood ful black doth slide.
But if so great desier, such feruent loue thou hast in mind, Two times to loke on hell, two times to swim those lakes onkind, If pleasour ought there be, this frantike toyle to lake on thée: These things first must thou do.
In shadowes great there lurks a trée, With golden cropps and bows, with leaues and brau~ches smothe of gold: Which to Diana déepe, infernal Quéene, is sacred hold.
This trée hath euery wood, and dark in vales doth hide with shade.
But no man breathing life can vnder ground haue power to trade, Til from those goldilocks of bows he brings one braunche deuine, Which to her self for chief reward Diana doth assigne.
Whan one bough broken is, another springs as fresh in sight Of gold, and twigges are euer like, with buddes of metall bright.
Seke out therfore with spede, and whan thou duely hast it spied, Lay thou theron thy hand, for willingly with eas, onwried It self it shal releas, if dest nies thée therto do call: For otherwise not breake it wil, for strength, nor wepons all.
Moreouer, now thy fréend deceassyd lieth with corps on ground, Alas vnware thou art, and al thy fléete he doth confound, While here thou harkning standst, and councels great of God dost craue.
Him first go bring to earth, and giue to him his worthy graue.
And slaughters black of beastes for sinnes redemption sée thou leade.
So maist thou Limbo woods, where breathing man may neuer tread, Behold at last, ({quod} she.)
He pondring did reuolue, so did with him Achates kind, And ioyntly step by step with equal cares they walking went.
Much talk betwéen them twain of sondry things they speaking spent, What frend dame Sibly means, what corps it is they shuld entiere.
But whan to shore they came, onware on sand approching néere, Misenus staine they sée with giltles death, their frend ful déere.
Misenus trompet sounder chief, whose nobler neuer was, In kindling men with noise, and fighting fieldes to chéere with bras.
Somtime sir mighty Hectors mate he was, to Hector strong With trompet bold and speare he corage gaue in battail throng.
But whan that him from life Achilles victor spoilid had, Vnto Aeneas Troian prince this vailiant captain sad Did place him self as péere, and nothing worse his chaunce he drew.
But than (as mischief was) while brasen trompe he swimming blew For pride, and calling to compare the Gods of seas did greue:
Him Triton toke for spite (if men may beldly this beleue)
And dragd him through the rockes, and depe in seas his enmy drownd.
The Troyans than with noise his body dead encompast round, And good Aeneas chief, than to a complish Siblies charge, No longer time thei take, but wéeping fast an altar large
They lade with timber logges, and hie to heauen a pile they bilde.
Into a forest old they gon, and hauntes of beastes vnmilde, Down tombling crake the trées, vprisith sounde of axes strokes, Both holmes, and beches broad, and beames of ashe, and shides of okes, Wich wedges great they clyue, and mountain elmes with leauers rolle.
And tooles in hand he toke, and formost man amongst then wrought.
Yet heauines in hart he bare, and often thus he thought, If now this golden braunche wil through this forest thick apéere, Than verily right true it is (as al things ells ben cléere) And too too true (alas) of thée she spake Misenus déere.
Skant spoken were these words, whan culuers twain by chaunce in sight Came ouerhead in skies before his face, and down they light, And softly sat on ground, he knew forthwith his mothers burdes Aeneas mighty prince,
O, be my gides (if any way there be) and through these glades Direct me to the place where fertill soile in darcksome shades Doth beare this golden braunche, and thou mother great, pray Now faill me not at néede.
Thus speking stil himself did stay, Beholding brim those byrds, and how they rise, and where they flie.
They feding there a while amounted furth, and went in skie.
So far as eyes of man could them pursue, or marke could make.
Than whan against Auerna mouth they came, (that stinking lake) They lyft them selfes aloft, and through the tender aier they slyde And falling down at last, they toke theyr trée, and there did bide, Where glistring braunches shewes of sondry glossid shining gold.
None otherwise, than misteltewe on woods in winter cold Renewes his bushes gréene, whom tronck of trée did neuer bréede, But saffronfrutid bows the stubbes therof doth ouerspréede, So from the trée the golden braunche did shewe, such was the kind, So wauering soft it wagde, and tincling swéete it made in wind.
Aeneas at it straight, and caught a crop with much ado.
And glad with comfort great, dame Siblies house he brought it to.
Nor nothing lesse this while, the Troyans all in solempne gise Did wayle Misenus corps, and gaue to him their last outcries.
First, cut in culpons great, and fat of sappe with pitche among
stately pile they bilde, with timber trées and Cipers strong.
(That dead mens treasour is) his gorgeous armes also they set,
The body cold they washe, and precious ointments on they powre.
Lamenting loude is made, than close his limmes in bed on floore They couch with wéeping teares, and purple wéedes on him they throw: His robes, his harneis bright, and enseignes al that men may know.
In mourning sort, some heaue on shulders hie the mighty béere,
(A dolefull seruice sad) as children do their father déere,
Behind them holding bronds, than flame vprising, broad doth spréede, And oyles and deinties cast, and frankinsens the fier doth féede.
Whan falne his cinders were, and longer blase did not endure: His reliques and remain of dust with wines they washyd pure.
Than Choriney his bones in brasen coffin bright did close.
And sprincling water pure, about his mates thre times he goes, And dropps of sacrid dewe with Oliue palmes on them did shake,
And compas blest them al, and sentence last he sadly spake.
To fieldes of ioye thy soule, and endles rest we do betake.
But good Aeneas than, right huge in height his tombe did rere, And gaue the lord his armes, his ore and trompet fixed there.
On mountain nere the skies, that of Misenus beares the name: And euerlasting shal from world to world retaine the same.
This done, dame Siblies further mind to execute he shapes.
Full rough of rocky stones, and lothsome lake there flowes about.
Therouer dare no bird attempt to flie, for deadly dout, Such prison breath outbreaks, and through the throte with stifling stink, Such smolthring vapour smokes, and vp to skies is borne from brinke.
Wherby the Greekes by name Auerna mouth that place do call.
There hefers chosen foure, full blacke of backes, he first of all Did bring, and wines betwen theyr fronts the priest of custome threw, And with her hand she pluckt the hear betwen their hornes that grew, To cast in sacrid fier, redemption chiefe of déedes amis.
And on Diana calls, in heauen and hel that mighty is.
Som other sturres with kniues, and blood lukewarm in bolles they take.
Him self a lambe by darke, onto the dame of furies blake, And to her sister great with sword he strake, and onto thée, (O Proserpine a frutelesse cowe he kild ful blacke to sée.
Than onto Lymbo king his altars large he made by night.
And bowelles whole of bulles in burning fier enflamid bright.
And plenty fat of oyles, till offrings al were wastid quight.
before that light of sonne did rise in skies aboue,
The ground with roaring shooke, and vnder féete did trembling moue.
And toppes of trées do turne, and dogges in shade did séeme to houle, Whan first the goddesse came.
Auaunt, auaunt, you sinners foule Dame Sibly loud did crie, from al these woods stand out beneath.
Kepe thou thy way by force, and nakyd sword pull from thy sheath.
Now time of corage is, now fixe thy mind Aeneas fast.
And with that word into Auerna mouth her self she cast.
He void of feare doth stalking her pursewe at elbowe fast.
gods that empier kéepes on ghostes, and soules of silens dumme, Thou Chaos, and you firy boyling pittes and places glumme: Giue licens me to tell your secret workings vnder ground, Giue pardon to disclose things déepe in mist, and darkenes dround.
Then walking went in night, alone, in silens through the shade, By Lymbos kingdoms wast, and houses empty voyde of trade.
Like as the féeble Moone doth giue sometime a fainting light To men that walke in woods, wha~ clouds do kepe the skies from sight, And al things altred ben, and couloures cléere are hyd by night.
Euen at the porche, and first in Lymbo iawes, done Wailings dwell, And Cares on couches lyen, and Settled Mindes on vengeans fell.
Diseases leane, and pale, and combrous Age of dompishe yéeres, And Feare, and filthy Néede, and Hunger hard that mischief stéeres.
Than death himself, whose neighbor next Was Slepe that kinsman is to Death, than proud Minds vnperplext Reioysing vile in sinne and mortal Warres afront the gate, And Furies fight in beddes of stéele, and Discorde farre from state With bleding browes, and vgsome startling heares of angry snakes, Amids them all an Elme with armes out spreding, shadow makes.
An Elme both huge and old, that seat, men say do Fansies kéepe, And Dreames vncertaine dwell, and euery leafe they vndercréepe.
And diuers monsters more there was, of sondry sortes vnkind.
In euery doore they stampe, and Lyons sad with gnashing sound.
And Bugges with hundryd heades as Briarey, and armid round Chimera fightes with flames, and gastly Gorgon grim to sée, With heardes of Harpies vile, and Goblines foule of figures thrée.
And as they threatning came, he towards them his fauchon shooke.
And (but his learnid gyde instruct him did, to let go by Those flittring tender formes, and not to touch those shappes that flye Which nothing ben but life, and substance none, but likenes thinne) He wold with them haue fought, and did in vaine to beate beginne.
Here now the way doth lead to Lymbo lake and filthy flud, Whose chanell chokid is with troublous grounds of miry mud, And belching boyles a sand, which to the banks it throwes from déepes.
dréedfull feryman that streame with visage lothsome kéepes, In tattrid wretched wéede, and Caron he by name doth hight.
His hoary bushe and beard both ouergrown and foule vndight,
His filthy mantell hanges, whom sluttishe knot oncomly ioynes, Himself with pykyd poale his boate doth guide, and beares a charge, Transporting stil the soules, in rusty dusty cankryd barge.
Well agyd now, but sappy strength he kéepes of gréener yeres.
To this place all the rout doth draw themselfs with louring cheres, By numbers great, both men and women dead, nor long delayed.
With princes, preaced boyes and girles, that wedlocks neuer saied, And flouring youth, that in theyr parentes time were layd in ground, And all that life had borne, about the banke they clustrid round, As thick as leaues of trées among the woods in winter wind Whan first to ground they fal, or like as foules of waterkind Assembling flocke them selfs, whan yere of frost hath first begonne, And ouer seas they séeke in warmer londs to take the sonne.
They stood, and crauing cried, that first transport they might before, And stretching held their hands desiring much the further shore.
The churlish feryman, now these now those by course receiues, And some down thrusting throws, and from the sand restraining weyues.
Aeneas than, for of this great tumult he merueld sore: virgin tel ({quod} he) what meanes this busye great vprore? What séeke they thus? why to this water banck ronne they so fast? Wherfore be these reiect? and yonder those their course haue past? And some with ores sée are swéeping yet this chanell blewe? Than shortly thus to him dame Sibly spake, that prophet true.
great Anchises son, vndouted child of gods in blisse, Now Lymbo lake thou séest, infernal poole this water is.
Cocitus cald it is, and Stigies moore the name doth beare,
By which the gods them selfs so sore affraid ben to forsweare.
This prease that here thou séest, ben people dead not laid in graue, piteous rable poore, that no relief nor comfort haue.
This boateman Caron is, and those whom now this water beares, Are bodies put in ground with worship due of wéepinge teares.
Nor from these feareful bankes nor ryuers hoarce they passange get: Till vnder earth in graues theyr bodies bones at rest are set.
hundred yeres they walk, and round about these shores they houe, And than at last full glad, to further pooles they do remoue.
Aeneas stopt his fote, and stayed him self against that place, Reuoluing much in mynd, and pitied sore their woful case.
He sawe lamenting there, and lacking graues and worship due, Leucaspis and Orontes, lords of Troyan fléete full trewe.
Whom ioyntly both from Troy, as through the swelling seas they past: The southwind whirling toke, and ship and men did ouercast.
Behold, his mayster chief, and pylot guyde, syr Palinure Chafing did vexe him self, who late in Sicil seas full sure His course with sailing kept, while starrs of heauen he vewd at helme He through the puppe was falne, and seas him quite did ouerwhelme, Him scarse he could discerne among the soules with frowning face.
Palinure, what god with heauy grace Hath spoilid me of thée? and thée in déepe seas thus hath drownd? Declare to me, for neuer here tofore that fals was found, With this one tale vntrew Apollo me did féede in vaine, Who said, that sauf from seas, Italia land thou shuldst attayne, Lo where a man may trust.
It is not Phoebus thée that hath begylde Troian king, nor me that god in seas did ouerwhelme.
For as at sterne stood, and stéering strongly held my helme, Wherwith charged was, and course of ships with sailes did beare, hedlong fell therwith.
By all the seas full rough sweare, Nothing so sore dredde, nor for my self so much did care, As lest thy ship dispoyld, and of her guide and maister bare: Shuld by misfortune fail, as waues so great that time did rise.
Thrée wéery winter nightes, in combrous seas in waltring wise, With waters borne was: the fourth day skant at last spied Italia land, as ouer waues full hie my head wried.
By smal and smal to landward than swam, and sure was,
Had not the nation wild destroyd me there vnknown, alas.
And as creping held with crokid hands the mountaynes toppe, Encombrid in my clothes that dabbing down from me did droppe: They slew me there with swordes, and thought by me to grayne a pray.
Now still in floodes fléete, and to and fro with winds stray.
That thée, by the gladsome light of heauen and ioufull skies: Now for thy fathers loue, and for thy son whose lucke doth rise: Vnwrap me from thes wrongs (o pereles prince) and bring me a ground, pray thée, (for thou maist) in Velin hauens shall be found.
Or thou, if any way there be, if goddesse mother thine Hath shewd thée how to shift (for not without some power deuine This place think thou séest, nor Lymbo pooles thus canst thou swim) Reatche me thy hand, and take me wretche with thée by water brim, That after death at least, in pleasant rest may remayne.
Such things he talking spake, whan Sibly thus replied agayne.
Since whan Palinure, hath al this madnes comen on thée? Woldst thou the Lymbo poole and dolefull fluddes vntombid sée? Vnbidden from this bank dost thou in déede to skape entende? Seke neuer Gods eternal dome with speche to think to bende.
Yet take with thée his word, and comfort thus thy gréeuous fal.
For they that border next vnto that mount, and cities all, By tokens great from heauen shal be compeld thy bones to take, And tombe they shall the byld, and solempne seruice thée shall make.
This spoken, from his heauy hart his cares abating créepe.
And sorowes partly shrank, and glad on earth his name he knewe.
They on their iourney went, and towards now the flood they drewe.
Whom as the boteman first, with eies vpcast in comming spied: To walke in silent woodes, and how to shore their féete they plied: He thus began to chafe, and towardes them ful loude he cried.
What euer thou art, that armid thus vnto our fluddes dost trace: Tell what thine errand is, and stay thy selfe, and stop thy pace.
Here is the seate of soules, the place of sléepe and slumbry night, Nor breathing bodies non this boat may bear by law nor right.
Nor Hercules (whom did last receiue) did me no good, Nor Theseus, with Pirithous, that passid here this flood, Though born of gods they were, and péereles lords of strength and mind.
He with his mighty hands the mastif hound of hell did bind
Before the king at benche, and dragde him trembling out to light.
Those other did attempt to steale from hens our empresse bright.
Than Sibly prophet préest, with gentle spéeche thus did entreat.
Here is no treason such, do thou not chafe nor further freat.
These wepons work no harme, the porter huge for euermore May barking keep his caue, and bloodles soules affraye from shore.
Aeneas famous here, the curteis prince, in armes of Troy Vnto his father goeth, vnto the soules of Lymbo lowe, If vertue non so great may mooue thy mind this man to knowe.
Behold ({quod} she) this braunche, and from her garment out she tooke The golden braunche, than angry wrath his swelling hart forsooke, Nor, more he spake, but wondring at that blessid gift of grace, And fatall rod, that seldome séen had ben within that place, He shouid furth his ship, and on the banck approching hit.
Than other soules, that on the sides in long arayes did sit: He tombling draue them down, and made a rowme, and in he takes Aeneas mighty prince, the boat in iointes for burden crakes.
And through that lethrin seames the filthy floud in plenty drinkes.
Yet landed sauf at last both priest and man, on the vtter brinkes, In miry woas, and slimy mudde mischapen foule that stinkes,
Doth bawle with barking noyse, at Lymbo mouth ful huge to sée.
Whose neck whan Sibly sawe with startling snakes to swelling fixt: soppe of bread with sléepy féedes, and hony swéete commixt Against his throte she threw, he gaping wide his threfold iawes, Al hungry caught that gubbe, and couching strait with stretching pawes, He bowed his boistous back, and on the ground himself be spred, Encombring all the caue, and groueling lay with slumbry head.
Aeneas toke the place, while thus the porter slurging was, And skoope the further shore, wher backward home no life can pas.
Anon were voyces hard, and piteous cries, and wailings shrill, Of soules of tender babes, and infantes wéeping void of skill.
That pleasure swéete of life did neuer tast, but from their brest Vntimely death them toke, and fortune grimme hath down opprest.
Next them be such, as false surmise haue don to death by lawe, Nor they without their iudge, and for their seats their lots thei drawe, King Minos moues their boxe, and as a iudge their liues enqueres,
And calles enquestes of soules, and al their sinnes in silens heres.
Than louring next in place, ben they that fel with wilfull death, And giltles slew them selfes, with hasty hands, abhoring breath, And shoke from them their soules, how gladly now in skies againe, Wold they full poore estate, and hardnes al of life sustaine? The destnies do resist, and lake vnlouely them detaynes, And pooles of Lymbo nine in compas ronning, them restraines.
Not far aloof from thens, disperst abroad on quarters all, The mourning féeldes they sée (for so by name men do them call) There they whom cruell loue consumid hath with fretting moodes, In secret pathes they walk, and hide them selues in Mirtill woodes, Encombrid still with cares, nor death it self their sorows slakes.
There Phaedra, Procris, and Euriphilen he séeth that morning makes For loue, and of her son vnmercyfull the woundes doth beare.
And Cenaeus, a lad somtime that was, but now a wife, Conuerted eft by kinde to former shap of females life.
Among al these, Quéene Dido late that died of fatall wound, In forest wandring went, whom the Troyan duke had found, Approching nere and knew, in shimring shadowe darck and thinne: Much like, as after chaunging new whan prime doth first beginne, Men sée, or think they sée, that doubtfull moone in cloudes aboue: He blubbrid out in teares, and thus did speake for dulcet loue.
wofull Dido déere, the tale to trewe (as now doth séeme) Was brought me of thy losse, and of thy stroke and wound extréeme.
was thy cause of death, alas, now by the starres sweare, By all the Gods, and if there be remaining yet one where Vnfainid faith, if trueth on ground or vnder ground may bée: Against my will (O Quéene) from thy dominions did flée.
But me, ye threatnings great of Gods that through these glimsing glades Compels to séeke, these hoary moory musty darksom shades: Hath forcid me to this, nor neuer (Quéene) could beléeue, That my departing thée, so sore at hart could euer gréeue, Now stay thy self, and from my sight withdrawe thée not so fast.
Whom fléest thou thus? this vnto thée must be my talking last.
Aeneas thus to her, that frowning stood, with skouling eyes, He spake to swage her mind, and teares out gushing still did rise.
She turning, fixyd fast her face on ground with louring looke.
Nor more to him did moone, nor at his tale regard she tooke: Than sturres a standyng stone, or mountayn rocke for blast of wynde.
At last from him she brake, and backe she fled with spitefull minde, To shadows thick of woods, where ioynt with her, her husband old Sichaeus doth complayne, and equall loue with her doth holde.
Aeneas nethelesse, whom this mischaunce full sory shooke, Pursude her, wéepyng longe, and at her partyng pitie tooke.
From thens their way they sought, and now the borders last they helde.
Where worthy lords of armes enhabit thick in secret felde, There met he with sir Tydeus, and valiant noble knight Parthenopee, and pale Adrastus ghost, that wofull spright.
There, they that much lamented were on earth, and died in warre: The Troyan lords, he knew them all in long arayes a farre.
Thersilochus, and Glaucus déere, he sobbid them to see, And Medon, and Anthenor the famous children thrée.
And Polibetes, Ceres priest that was, both strong and bolde, Idaeus eke, that horses swift and armours yet doth holde.
By flockes about him drewe the soules full thick on euery hand, Nor satisfied they ben with loking ones, but still thei stand, And steppes with him they ioyne, and glad they be his cause to lerne.
But al the Greekish, lords, and Agammenons captayns sterne, Whan first the man they saw in glistring armour through the night: They trembling shoke for fear, some turning toke their wonted flight, As to their ships somptime thei ran, some others squeking thinne
There Deiphebus, Priams son he sawe, al boucherwise Bemanglid foule in face, with body torne in cruell gise.
Both body, face, and hands, and temples twaine, and eares dispoilde, With lothly croppid nose, and shameful woundes eche where defoilde.
Skarse him he could discerne, that trembling shrank, and couered wold His filthy wounds, than thus he spake with voyce acquainted old.
Deiphebus, mighty most in armes, Troian blood: What saluage tirant beast hath giuen to thee this plage so wood? Who might so great a powre obtaine on thée? The rumour went How in the night extreme, of Greekish slaughters wery spent Thou headlong threwst thy self on mixid heapes of enmies slain.
Than my self to thee, an empty tombe on Rheta plain Aduaunsing vp did bilde, and thrife thy soule saluted cléere.
Thy name and armes that place preserues, but thée (O frend so déere) Could not sée, that in thy contrey ground might entéere.
All dueties done thou hast, nor more my ghost can the desier.
But me, min own mischaunce, and Helen strompetts mischief more Hath plungid thus in paines these tokens me she left in store.
For whan that latter night with ioyes deceitful vs did féede.
Thow knowst: and ouermuch therof to think we must of néede.
Whan first that fatall horse our contrey walls did ouerskippe With armour freyghted ful and harneist fotemen down did slippe: Dissembling than to daunse with songes, and himpnes in stréetes about She drew the Troyan wines, and in her hand amids the rout She bare the burning torche, and from the towres the Greekes did lure.
Than ouercome with cares, wofull miser sléeping sure Within my chamber was, in pleasant eas, and laid at rest, And slomber swéete and déepe, most like to death had me opprest.
My goodly spouse this while, my wepons al way she cloinde, From al my house, and from my head my trusty sword purloind.
And Menelae her former husband cald, and fild the floores With clusters great of Greekes, and open wide she set the doores, And me to them she gaue, for token chief of former loue, That fame of old offence by that amendes she might remoue.
What shuld longer make: into my chamber all they thrust, With fals Vlisses help.
If due rewards séeke, if Greekes with me vniustly wrought.
But thée, aliue, what wondrous fortune here this time hath brought? Declare to me, by wandring wide at seas art comen astray? Or gods appointment great, or what mischaunce doth thée dismay, To sée this troublous place, these houses heauy voide of sonne? With talking thus, the Morning golden bright had ouerronne The compas halfe of heauen, and middes of skies she now did clime.
And happly speaking more, they shuld haue spent their pointed time.
The night approcheth fast, we wéepe away the time in vayne.
Here is the place where now the way deuides it selfs in twaine.
The righthand path goth vnderneth the walles of Pluto déepe.
That way we must, if path to Paradise we think to kéepe.
The lefthand leades to paine, and damnid sinners sends to hell.
prophet pure that dost excell, Do thou no furter freat, wil depart to yonder féeld To fyl the number there, and me again to darknes yéelde.
Go worship, go thou glory great of Troy, with heauenly grace, God send thée more good lucke, and with that word he turnd his pace.
Aeneas turnd his eyes, and in the rock on lefthand side castle broad he séeth, with thre thick walls encompast wide.
Whom enuironned with rage of flaming flood that fier out spewes, dampishe firy flood, that sounding stones outhelching stewes.
gate against it stands, ful huge of height, with pillers great Of Adamant vncut, whom force of mankind non can beat, Nor gods themselfs of heauen: vpstands to skies a brasen towre, Where sits Tisiphonee with blood read tooles, and visage sowre, That combrous monster féend, both daies and nights the watch she kéepes Before that entry grim, with gargell face, and neuer sléepes.
From thens wer howlings heard, and wretches wawling tost in paines, And clinching loud of iron, and gingling noise of dragging chaines.
What vengeaunce noise is this? virgin tell, what haue they do? That thus tormented ben? what meanes this bounsing? this outrage? Than Sibly thus began.
Troyan duke of wisdome sage, No good man may come néere this cursid house of dampnid Hell, But me, whan in Auerna woodes Diana set to dwell, She taught me than their paines, and through these places al did gide.
This boistous empier kéepes fir Radamanthus, king of pride, Correcting men for sinne, and al their falshodes heares and tries, Constraining to confesse what euer thing they did in skies: Differring til their death, as if al paines escapid were.
Anon, the giltie soules with ramping force and grisly feare Tisiphonee doth take, and scourging them she swappes with whippes, And serpentes grim she shakes, and ouer them she stamping skippes, With flocks of swarming féends, and al her sisters out she calles, Infernal hideous haggs, and to their turments them she stalles.
Than verily with thondring fearefull noise, the sacrid hookes Doth opening turne their gates, séest what a gard against vs lookes? What faces? what a watch ther stands at euery gate in sight? With fifty garing heades a monstrous dragon stands vpright? Yet sitts a worse within.
Two times as broad descends, two times as hedlong downright déepe: As heauen vpright is hie, if men therto from thence might péepe.
There lie the Titans brood, and of dame Earth the linage olde: Downthrown with lightning dintes, and in that gulf are tombling rold.
There saw serpentféeted bastards twain, of giauntes syse, That in conflict with heauen, to teare the skies did enterprise, Despising Ioue himself, whom from his throne they wold haue thrust.
Eke Sulmon there saw, in cruell wreake of turmentes iust.
For he the flames of god, and thondring soundes wold counterfeat.
He borne with horses foure, and shaking brondes and torches great Through contreys al of Greece, and townes triumphing went about, And honors due to God vsurping toke of euery rout.
frantik man, that péereles lightning clouds wold think to skorne, With brasse and ronning stéedes, that footed ben with hoof of horne.
But Ioue almighty than, a firy dart on him down flang, His artes could him not help, nor cressetts fierce wherwith he sprang.
But hedlong he to hel in whirling storme was thrown to déepes.
There plungid now in paines, he in the botom crawling créepes.
Eke Tition the darling déere of Earth which al thing bréedes You shuld haue sene, that furlongs nine of ground with body spréedes.
And huge on him there sitts, with crokid beake and croming pawes gastly Gripe, that euermore his growing guttes outdrawes.
And tiring tearith furth his euerduring liuer vaines, Nor neuer rest there is, but fresh renewes his endles paines.
What shuld now rehearse the beastly Centaures rable all? Whom ouer hangs a stone that euermore doth séeme to fall.
Their bridebedds faier are spred, and golden carpets shine ful bright, And precious princely fare before their face is set in sight.
Than comes the foulest féend, and al their deinties ouerbroodes, Forbidding them to touche, and from their hands doth snatch their foods, And beats with burning bronds and thondrings thick her mouth doth cast.
There they that did their brethren most abhorre while life did last, Or beat their parents, or their clients cause haue foule betraied, And such as gatherid goodes vnto themselfs, and no man paied, Nor almes neuer gaue, wherof there is to great a throng.
Or for aduoutry haue ben slaine, or reis warres in wrong.
Or rebells to their prince, or maisters goods wold not discerne: Includid in that Iaile their paines they bide.
What pains: what world of wo ther is: how ech his fortune féeles.
Som rolls vnwoldy rocks, some hangs on hie displaid on whéeles.
There euer sitts and euer shall Vnhappy Theseus, and Phlegias most of misers all: Among those caytiues darke and loud with voice to them doth rore, Learne iustice now by this, and gods aboue despise no more.
One wretch his contrey sold, and prince of strength therto did call, He forgid lawes for bribes, and made, and mard, and altrid all.
Another leapt into his doughters bed, confounding kindes, All ment outragious dedes, and fyld their foule outragious minds.
Not if had a hundred mouthes, a hundred tonges to spend, And voyce as strong as stéele, yet could neuer comprehend Their sondry sinnes and paines, nor of their names shuld make an end When Sibli to Aeneas thus had said.
Now make me spéede, Go furth, kéepe on thy way, performe those things that thou hast néede.
Dispatche we now ({quod} she) spie from hence the chimneis topps Of Ciclops boistous walles, sée their gates their forge, and shopps, Where we commaunded be to leaue this gift of golden spraies.
She said, and ioyntly both they past through croking darksom waies, And marching through the middes, vnto the gates approchid néere.
Aeneas through them rusht, and than him self with water cléere Besprinckling, toke the braunche, and at the gate he fyxt it fast.
These things so done, and all the goddesse gift fulfyld at last:
Into the gladsome féeldes they come, where arbers swéete and gréene, And blessed seates of soules, and pleasant woods and groues are séene.
fressher féeld of aier whom larger light doth ouerstrowe, And purer breath, their priuat sonne, their priuat starres they knowe.
Some to disport them selfs there sondry maistries tried on grasse.
And some their gambolds plaid, and som on sand there wrastling was.
Som frisking shake their féete, and measures tread rimes thei sowne, And Orpheus among them stands, as priest in trayling gown.
And twancling makes them tune, with notes of musike seueral seuen.
And now with Yuery quill, now strings he strikes with fingers euen.
There were the Troyan lords, and antike stocke of noble race, Most prudent princes strong, and borne in yeres of better grace.
Both Ilus, and Assaracus, and founder first of Troy, Ring Dardan, at their armour wéedes he wondred much with ioy.
Their speares beside them stand, their charets strong are set on ground,
Their comly coursing stéedes along the launds do féede vnbound.
What minds, what loue thei had, to dedes of arms whan life thei drew, Or what delite in stéedes: the same them dead doth now pursue.
Another sort he séeth, with hand in hand where gras doth spring, That feasting féede them selfs, and heaue and hoaw for ioy they sing.
Among the Laurel woods, and smelling floures of arbers swéete: Where bubbling soft with sound the riuer fresh doth by them fléete.
There such as for their countreys loue while liues in them did last In battel suffrid wounds, or priestes that godly were and chast, Or prophetes pure of life, and worthy things to men did preache: Or to adorne mans mortall life did science goodly teache: Their heads ar compas knit with garlond floures right fresh of hewe.
To whom than Sibly spake, as round about her fast they drewe.
Onto Musaeus first, for he inclosyd is in throng With numbers great of soules, and him they kéepe alwaies among, Bresthigh aboue them all, and all to him theyr heads incline.
Declare ({quod} she) you blessyd soules, and thou préest most diuine What place Anchises hath? where shal we find him? for his sake Wée be come here, and passyd haue the fluddes of Limbo lake.
Than vnto her the sacred préest with wordes ful gentle spake.
No man hath certen house, but in these shadowes broad wée dwell.
In beddes of riuer bankes, and medowes newe that swéetely smell.
But you, if such desire you haue, passe ouer yonder downes, My self shal be your gide by easy path into those bownes.
He said, and went before them both, and fieldes ful bright that shynd He shewd them from aboue, and all the downes they left behind.
Anchises prince, that time in pleasant vale surueyeng was The soules included there that to the world agayn shuld passe.
And reknid al his race, and childers childerns line he told, And kest their destnies al, and liues, and lawes, and manhods bold.
He whan against him there Aeneas comming first beheld: As he did walke in grasse, his hands to heauen for ioy vp held, With tricling teares on chéekes, and thus his voyce from him did yeld.
And art thou comen at last, long lokid for, my son so déere? Thy vertue ouercame this passage hard, and now so cléere, Do behold thy face? with rendring speche to speche of thine? So verily me thought, and in my mind did deuine Acompting still the times, nor me my carck hath not begild,
What contreys thée (my son) what combrous seas? what nations wilde? Turmoyld with daungers al, thée scapid now do receiue? How sore afraied was, lest Lybie lands shuld thee deceiue? He therunto: Thy ghost father swéete, thy greuous ghost, Perturbing in my dremes hath me compeld to sée this coast.
On Tirrhen shore my nauy stands at seas, now let vs ioyne Good father hand in hand, now thée from me do not purloyne.
Thre times about his neck his armes he wold haue set, and thries In vaine his likenes fast he helde, for through his hands he flies Like wind, vngropable, or dreames that men most swift espies.
This while Aeneas séeth a croked vale, and secret wood,
And shrubbes of sounding trées, and fléeting through them Lethee flood,
With sléeping sound, that by those pleasant dwellings softly rann: And peoples thick on euery side that no man number can.
As bées in medowes fresh, (whom somer Sonne doth shining warm) Assembling fal on floures, and lilies white about they swarm, With huzzing feruent noyse, that euery féeld of murmour ringes.
Aeneas with that sight amasid stood, and of those things
The causes al did are, what floud it is, so dull that glides? And what those peoples ben, that fill so thick those water sides? Anchises than to him.
These soules ({quod} he) that bodies new Must yet againe receiue, and limines eftsones with life endue: Here at this Lethee floud they dwell, and from this water brinck These liquors quenching cares, long forgetfull draughts they drink, That of their lyues, and former labours past, they neuer think.
These things to thée, full trew shall set furth before thine eyes, And shewe thée all our stock, of thée and me that shal arise.
That more thou maist reioice Italia land to find at last.
father, is it true? may soules that ones this world hath past And blessed ben in ioy, to bodies dulle again remoue? What meane they so? why wretched wordly light do they so loue? will declare forsooth, nor long (my son) wil thée holde, Anchises aunswer made, and all in order did vnfolde.
First heauen and earth, and of the seas that flittring féeldes and fines.
Thes gloriose starrs, this glistring globe of moone so bright that shines, One liuely soule there is, that féedes them all with breath of loue: One mind through al thes members mixt this mighty masse doth moue,
From thence mankind, and beastes, and liues of foules in aier that flies, And al what marblefacid seas conteines of monstrous fries, One chafing fier among them al there sittes, and heauenly springes Within their séedes, if bodies noisom them not backward bringes.
But lompe of liueles earth, and mortall members make them dull.
This causeth them, of lust, fear, grief and ioye, to be so full.
Nor closid so in darck, can they regard theyr heauenly kind, For carcas foule of fleshe, and dongeon vile of prison blind.
Moreouer, whan their end of life, and light doth them forsake: Yet can they not their sinnes nor sorowes al (poore soules) of shake.
Nor al contagions fleshlie, from them voydes, but must of néede Much things congendrid long, by wondrous meanes at last outspréed.
Therfore they plagid ben, and for their former fautes and sinnes Their sondry pains they bide, some hie in ayer doth hang on pinnes.
Some fléeting ben in fluddes, and déepe in gulfs them selfes they tier.
Til sinnes a way be washt, or clensyd cléere with purgin fier.
Eche one of vs our penaunce here abides, than sent we bée To paradise at last, we fewe these féeldes of ioye do sée.
Till compas long of time, by perfit cours, hath purgid quighte Our former cloddrid spottes, and pure hath left our ghostli spright, And sences pure of soule, and simple sparkes of heauenly light.
Than al, whan they a thousand yeres that whéele haue turnd about: To drinck of Lethee floud, by clusters great, God calls them out.
That there forgetting al their former liues, and former sinne, The mortall world afreshe, in bodies new they may beginne.
Anchises sayd, and therwithall his sonne and Sibly takes, And drawes, them through the mids of al that prease yt sounding makes, Vnto a mount, from whence they may theyr orders long a rowe, By leysour ouer read, and as they come theyr faces knowe.
Now let vs sée what glory great our Troyan line shal spréede, And what redoubted lusty laddes, Italia land shall bréede, Most princely sprites, our noble Troian fame aduaunce that shall, In brief wil dispatche, and thée declare thy destnies all.
Séest thou not yonder liuely child that leaning bendes his speare? His lot is next to rise, and next in world his head shall reare, Of Troyan and Italian blood commixt, thy worthy childe, Thy Siluius, borne after thy deceasse in forest wylde.
Whom late at last to thée thy wife Lauinia bearing bringes,
stately king him self, and father great of stately kinges.
From whom our linage long shal Alba kingdoms riche enioy.
Than yonder Procas next, the proud renown of former Troy, And Numitor, and Capis good, and he that thée by name Shall represent, Aeneas Siluius of noble fame.
And dedes of armes with vertue mixt, if euer he may raygne, If euer he his Alba lands, and kingdoms may obtayne.
Which lusty laddes behold, from them what corage doth redound.
And how their toppes with oken bows, and ciuill crownes ar bound.
They vnto thée Nomentum land, and Gabios townes sl tame, And Fidenas, and cities great and proude they shal reclame.
And Collantine, and Coram hilles, suppresse they shal with toures.
These names shal than vprise, now nothing is but nameles dust.
Than Romulus, that valiant impe of Mars, him furth shal thrust, To match his graunsir great, whon Ilia Quéene shal bring to light Of Troyan blood, séest not his dubblecreastid head vpright? And with what grace the king of heauen doth mark his chosen knight? Behold my son the man, for through his lucke and huge deuise: That péereles mighty Rome, that gloriose Rome aloft shal rise.
Whose rod shal rule the total earth, whose mindes shal match the heuen, And reyse their walls they shal, including toures, and mountains seuen, Most fortunat in frute of men, as Berecinthia Queene, From whom the race of Gods, and linage al discended bene.
She riding through the world, in charet borne with godly grace, Her hundred déerlings swéete her childerns childern doth embrace All heauenly wightes, al scepter bearers bright, in starrs on hie, Now this way turne thy face, and on thys nation cast thine eye.
sée where Caesar is, and of Iule The progeny that vnder poles of heauen shal beare the rule, This man, this is the man, of whom so oft haue thée told, Augustus Emprour, prince deuine, he shal the world of gold Saturnus Golden world (sometime that was) eftsones restore.
On Garamants, and Indes, and contreys conquerd more and more His empier out shal stretche.
Beyond the starres the kingdoms ronne, Beyond the firmament and signe, from course of yeare and sonne.
Where Atlas (mighty mount) on shulders strong the heuen doth turne, And vnderpropes the pole that beares the starres that euer burne.
For drede, and temples great of Gods with aunswers gresly shakes.
And Nilus flood for fear his issues seuen doth foule confound.
Nor neuer Hercules him self could walke so much of ground, Though he with dart the windy footed hinde did ouertyer, Though monsters swift he slew, and dragons quaking brent with fier.
Nor Bacchus victor so could nations wild and proud reclame.
Though he with bridlyng bits of vines did ride on Tigers tame.
And stand we stil in doubt by valiaunt dedes to purchase fame?
Or for Italia land to fight, shuld we our destnies blame? But what is yonder he, that Oliue palme so comly beares? Most like a priest? lo now know, know those hoary heares, And whitishe beardid chinne of prudent Numa, Romain king, That vnto lawes and peace shal first the simple people bring, From poore estate to mighty kingdom cald, whom shal succeede He that his contreys ydlenes shal breake, and force of néede To sturre themselfs in armes, king Tullus, he shal vp reuiue Their slugging sprites, and teach to winne, and triumphes eft atchiue.
Next vnto him, with greater boast, king Ancus them shal guide, That of the peoples praise to much already takes a pride.
Wult sée the Tarquin kings? and stately soule of Brutus brest?
He first the Consulship on him shal take, and first of all, His onely sons vnto their death, for welth of Rome shal call, Whan they with battailes new against the Consuls wold rebell: Himself for fredom sayer, with edge of axe shal do them quell.
Vnlucky man, how euer latter age shal praise the same, His contreys loue him driues, and gréedy lust of endles fame.
Sée Decios, and Drusos, and his are that doth distraine Torquatus.
But yonder matches twaine, whom shine thou séest in harneis bright, Now louing soules they be, while both are wrapt in dark of night.
Alas, what wondrous warres? if euer they in life apéere,
What bloody fighting féeldes? what slaughters wild shal they vpstéere?
The fatherlaw from Alpes hilles, and towres of Fraunce shal fall.
The son in law, from Estern lands shal moue with armies all.
Not so my lads, not so, such greuous warres do you not mind, Nor with your hands your contreys wombe to teare be so vnkind,
And chiefly thou, thou from the gods of heauen that dost descend,
He with triumphant ioy, in charet borne, and mighty traine Shall clime the Capitoll of Rome, whan lords of Greekes are slaine, And townes vprootid ben, Corinthus, Argos, great Micene, He victor conquer shal, and from the ground subuert them cleane.
And wreke his graunsirs old of Troy, and Pallas church defilde.
Or noble Cossus thée who can forgetting leaue behinde? Or gracious Gracchus line, or capteynes twaine who can withstand Two Scipios? two thonderboltes of warre: for Lybie land deadly fatall plage: or who can thée extoll ynough Fabritius? that much canst do with small, or from thy plough Serranus thou that comest? and after conquests sowest thy corne.
Where now away withdraw you wery me? you noble borne You Fabij? thou Maximus, thou onely art the man That al our welth forlorne, by sober lingring reskue can.
Some forsing metalls fine shal brasen shappes with breath endue, wéene they will to marble stones giue life with likenesse true.
They causes best shal pleade, and course of heauen in wondrous wise,
They shal describe with rod, and teache the state of starres that rise.
Remember Romaine thou, to rule thy realmes with empier iust,
Thy subiects euer spare, and stomacks proud down vanquish plaine.
So lord Anchises sayd, and (as they wondrid) spake again.
Behold, how gorgeous gay with spoyles Marcellus goth vpright, Aboue all men, by shulders hie he doth surmount them quight.
He, whan the Romayn state with great commotion troubled is,
Shal stay with horsemen stout, and make the Moores their purpose misse, And ouerthrow their throngs, and rebell French in combat kylde, His armour spoyles to Ioue· for offering third he shall vpyelde.
goodly springold yong in glistring armour shining bright, But nothing glad in face· his eyes down cast did shewe no chéere.)
father, what is he that walkes with him as equall péere? His onely son? or of his stock some child of noble race? What bustling makes his mates? how great he goth with portly grace? But cloud of louring night his head full heauy wrappes about.
Than lord Anchises spake, and from his eyes the teares brake out.
son, thy peoples huge lamented losse séeke not to knowe.
The destnies shall this child, onto the world, no more but showe,
Nor suffer long to liue, gods, though Rome you think to strong
And ouermuch to match, for enuie yet do vs no wrong.
What wailings loude of men in stretes, in féeldes, what mourning cries In mighty campe of Mars, at this mans death in Rome shall rise? What funeralls: what numbers dead of corpses shalt thou sée? Tyber flood, whan fléeting nere his new tombe thou shalt flée?
Exalt his graunsirs hope so hie: nor neuer Rome shal bréede An impe of maruel more, nor more on man may iustly bost.
Durst no man him haue met in armes conflicting, foteman fearce, Or wold he fomy horses sides with spurres encountring pearce.
piteous child, if euer thou thy destnies hard maist breake: Marcellus thou shalt be.
Now reatche me Lillies, Lilly flours, Giue purple Violetts to me, this neuews soule of ours With giftes that may spreade, and though my labour be but vayne: Yet do my duety déere shall.
And compas round the campe they wandring went, and vowd about, In borders broad of ayer, and of the soules surueied the rout.
Which whan Anchises thus had shewd his son in order due, And kindlid glad his mind with fame of things that shuld ensue: Than him of al his warres, and great affaires to come, he told, Of king Latinus towne, and of his realmes and peoples bold, And how eche labour best may voidid be, or easely borne.
Two gates of sléepe there be, the one men say is made of horne, Wherthrough by passage soft do sprites ascende with senses right.
That other gate doth shine, and is compact of Yuery bright.
But false deceitful dreames that way the soules are woont to send.
With talking thus, whan lord Anchises first had made an end: And counsaile gaue his son, and all his mind had put from dout, He brought them both, and through the Yuery gate he let them out.
He toke his way furthwith, and to his nauy went by land.
And finding there his mates, he brought them to Caieta strand.
Their ankers from their foreships cast, their pups on shore thei stand.
AENEAS burieth Caieta his nurse, and calleth the place Caieta, by her name.
From thence he passeth by the seat of Circes, by prosperous winde is brought to the mouth of Tiber, and driuen with a contrary streame: he arriueth on the coast of Laurentum.
And vnderstandynge thereby Ascanius woordes, that the same was the lande that was predestinate vnto him: he sendeth vnto kinge Latinus, that ruled those quarters, an hundred oratours, which should both carie gifts vnto him in his name, and request a place wherin to build a Citie.
Kynge Latinus gently hearyng theyr embassadge, ouer and besides their request voluntarely offreth vnto Aeneas, his daughter Lauinia to wife, whom by the pro+phecy of his father Faunus, and the answer of the southsayers: he was co~maunded to bestow vpon a straunger.
This while Iuno displeased with the prosperous successe of ye Troians: calleth Alecto out of Hell to disturbe this peace.
Who first enrageth with her furie Amata, kynge Latinus wife, Turnus also.
Then, turnynge her self to the Troian youth, whiche then haply was busied in huntyng: bringeth vnto theyr hands a tame stag which was dearly beloued among Tyrrheus the kynges heardmans children.
Whom when Ascanius had wounded with an arowe, the husbandmen betakyng them selues to weapon, set vpon the Troians.
Alecto from an hie place giueth thalarme, in which tumult are sleyne Almon.
Tyrrheus eldest sonne, Galesus the ritchest husbandma~ in all that countrey.
Who when they were braught dead vnto the citie, Turnus and Amata do pricke foorth kyng Latinus to make war, and to reuenge this iniurie.
But he callyng to remembrance the destnies, and the league whiche he made of late with the Troians: could not be perswaded to make war agaynst them.
Mezentius with Lausus his sonne do accompany Turnus into battell.
Also Catillus and Coras Tyburtine brothers, and Camilla of the realme of Volsca, a most valient woman, and diuers other, whose names are recited in the end of the booke.
Thy bones, and name, thine honor there preserues, and settlid be In great Italia land, if that may worship do to thée.
But good Aeneas, whan her obyt ryghtes were ended al.
And tombe vpreisid round, as soone as hie seas down did fal,
The wind with pipling blows, nor moone doth lack to giue them light, The trembling water shines with beames reflected glistring bright Along dame Circes coast adioynant next, their course they cut.
Where Circes Phoebus doughter proud her welthy seats hath put, In sounding saluage woodes, and sauours swéete by night she burns.
And precious weauing webs, with clattring tooles she works and turns.
From thence wer wailings heard, and lions wrathful loud did grone, Resisting in their bands, and nere to night they make theyr mone, Both bristlid groining bores, and beares at mangers yelling yawle, And figures foule of wolues they heare for wo to fret and wawle, Whom from the shappes of men, to brutishe beasts, and faces wyld Dame Circes did transforme, with herbes of might, and charms vnmild.
Which sore mischaunce, lest simple Troyans poore shuld féele the like, Or in those hauens ariue, or on that parlous coast shuld strike: Neptunus fild their sailes with prosprous wind, and gaue them way To flée that cursid shore, and from that daunger did conuey.
And now the sea with sonne beames waxid read, and hie from skies The golden morning bright with roset whéeles did mounting ryse,
And they their ships in marble seas with ores did wrastlyng towe.
And there Aeneas from the seas beheld a hugy wood, Where fléeting swift with whirling streames most pleasant Tyber flood Breakes out it self in seas, with sandy waters troblous read, Where sondry sortes of foules, on euery side, and ouer head, Their wonted chanel kéepe, and banks, whose chéereful noises shril: Reioycid swéete the skies, and in the groue they flew at will.
He bids his mates, and to the déepe floud glad he doth descend.
Now muse, now let vs se: what gouernment, what state of things, In Italy that time there was, what captains great, what kings, Whan first this straungers fléete in Latium laud did ships ariue
Thou goddesse giue me might, of gastly warres now must sing, Of mortall battailes fought and slaine with armies king by king, Vprores of angrie realmes, and all Italia mixt with blowes must report, a greater course of things to me their growes,
King Latin than that contrey helde, Well aged now, and cities long in welthy peas did welde.
This man was Faunus son, Marica goddesse was his dame.
King Picus, Faunus father was, and he doth fetche his name From thée Saturne great, thou art his syre and first of blood.
No son to him there was, non issue Male (so fortune stood) For in his springing youth withdrawen he was, and life did yelde.
One doughter did remaine, and al that house susteining helde, Now husbandripe, now wedlockable ful, of laufull yéeres.
From large Italia land, ful many a lord, and princely péeres, Ful glad for her did sue, but ouer al, of beauty most, King Turnus lusty prince (of kingly stock that best might bost) Aboue them al was chief, and him the Quéene did sée most méete, And wondrously did hast, to ioyne with him her doughter swéete.
Laurel trée there was, amids the court, that hie did sprede, With sacred crops and bowes, and many a yere in reuerence had: Which whan king Latin first that tower did buylde, by destny glad He found, and vnto Phoebus great did consecrate the same, And of that Laurel trée, did Laurent cal that cities name.
wondrous thing to speake, this Laurel bushe ful thick of browse: From skies descending down, a swarme of bées beset the bowes, Incessant thick with noise, and fast with féete in cluster clung Al sodenly did close, and on the top with heft they hung.
An alien captain, ({quod} he) And alien army comes, and gettes possession here sée.
And parties clustring cleaue, and gathring strength the tower thei take.
Besides al this, whan she her self to godds did offring make·
Lauinia virgin pure, and stood at the altars next her Syer: wondrous sight was séen, that all her hear had cought a fier, And crakling flame outspred, and all her garmentes brent at ones.
Her robes, her virgin lockes, her crown beset with preciouse stones.
Which sodenly did stint, than blustring smoke, and blasing light With violence vpflew, and to the roof it ran vpright.
This dréedful signe, and on this wondrous sight men marueld much.
For like to her in fame al prophetes sang, shuld be non such.
But causes great of warre, betokened were by her to growe,
But Latine king, that on these monsters all did muse and carck:
His father Faunus mind and sentence sooth he went to harck, To dark Albumea wood, which on the mountain growes ful great, Where sacred flood doth sound, and fountains falling down do sweat.
From thens the countreys nere, and through Italia nations all Do fetche their councell chief, and in their doubtes for aunswers call.
The préest his offring makes, and killes the shéepe at dead midnight.
And laieth his limmes at rest, and soundly sléepes on fléeses white.
There visions straung he séeth, many a spryte ful thinne that flittes, And sondry voyces héeres, and with the gods in taske he knittes, In heauen, in Lymbo pooles, and soules he séeth in hell that sittes.
There: whan king Latin first deuoutly prayed for aunswer full, hundred chosen shéepe he down did kill that bare theyr wulle, And spred their backs on ground, and resting slept vpon their skinnes, With méeke desier: than through that groue a loud voice thus beginnes.
Séeke not to set thy doughter déere with none of Latin land, worthy son, nor trust this wedlock now thou hast in hand.
son in law from contreys far there comes, whose stately race Vnto the starres our name shal lift, whose issue great of grace, All things within this world, where euer sonne doth round recule, On both sides londs and seas, shal vnder féete down tread, and rule.
These warnings of his father Faunus giuen at dead midnight, King Latin did not hide, but Fame the cities filde furth right, Of all Italia realmes, whan to the shore this Troyan fléete In landing toke their banck, and fastned ships with cables méete.
Aeneas with his captains chief, Ascanius faier to sée, On gréene grasse toke their eas, and vnderneth a séemely trée, Their deintes furth they drew, and meat they set on cakes of meale, Refeshing swéete their minds, so Ioue him self did pleas to deale.
And mountain frutes they toke, and heapes of apples hie they pight.
Whan al things els were spent, and they by chaunce wer driuen to bite Their crusts of cracknel cakes, and eat for skantnes vp their cremmes, And hungry brake with hands their leauings last, and set there gommes
Vpon their fatal bread, nor trenchers broad they did not spare:
How now sirs? haue we eat our tables vp for want of fare? The child Ascanius said.
That voyce receiued strait, al fear from them did first exclude, And end of labours brought, and from his mouth as he it said His father toke that word, and with deuotion great he staied.
Alhayle contrey mine by destnie due, And you al hayle ({quod} he) Troian goods of promise true.
Here is my dwelling house, my resting lond: my father old (Now comes it in my mind) these secretes me ful often told, Whan thou (my son) thy ships on coast onknown dost first ariue, And hunger hard for lack to eat thy tables thée shal driue, There maist thou trust thy resting place to byld, and safly there Foundations make of walles, and houses hie be bold to rere.
This was that hunger sore, this is our last of labours al, Al sorowes now shal ceas.
Wherfore come of, and in the morning next at sight of sonne, What people dwells hereby, what townes they kéepe, and where they wonne, Let vs enquire and loke, and from the hauen withdrawe we al.
Now skinke your cuppes to Ioue, and great Anchises chéerely cal.
And pray to gods for help, and fetch furth wines in plenty round.
This spoken, he with garlond bowes his temples freshly bound, And praied his gods of peace, and worship gaue vnto dame Ground, (That formost is of gods) and aungell good that kéepes that place.
And Nimphes, and fairie Quéenes, fluds vnknown he sought of grace.
Than Gods of night he calde, and signes of starres by night that rise.
The almighty father than, thre times arowe from heuens on hight, Did signe of thondring showe, and golden beames with burning light Was séene, and with his hand himself in cleare skie shooke the cloude.
Anon the rumour spred, and through the campe was blasyd loude, That now the daye was come, that houses hie they shuld possesse.
Their bankettes they restore, and man to man their ioyes expresse.
And wines in bolles they set, and cuppes they crowne, and feasts renew.
The morning next, whan torche of burning sonne the world did vew, And day dispersyd was, on euery syde they séeke, and send Surueiours through the coast, and topps of mountains next ascend.
city chief they finde, of Numik lake, here springs the well.
This riuer Tyber is, here Latin peoples strong do dwell.
Than lord Anchises son, from all his bands a hundred knightes Embassadours did choose, and to the king on message dightes.
Their crownes in compas knit with bows of peace, and myld attyre, To beare the king his giftes, and leage to Troyans to desyre, They furth without delay, with spéedy féete did plie their pace,
Whiles he describing drewe to bilde his walls a comly place, In facion like a campe, with trenche and bulwarkes strong and hie.
And now the knights their iourney nere had past, and toures they spie, Of king Latinus town, and loftly castels large appéere: And orderly they set them selfes, and walls approchid néere.
Before the towne the liuely youth, and children fresh of lust On horses tried them selues, and coursers wyld vpturnd in dust.
Or whirling drue their dartes, or launces long with strength they shake.
And some their bowes did bend, and some for wrastling matches make.
ridyng post forthwith vnto the king doth tidynges beare, How forein knightes vnknown, in garme~ts straunge approching were, He bids men them receiue, and to his court to bring and call.
Himself to counsell went, and in the mids he sat in hall.
Halle of huge estate, with pillers hie a hundred borne,
There wonted were the kynges to take their crownes and no where els.
And there theyr scepters stoode, this was both minster, court, and hall, Here stoode theyr offryng pewes, and many a slaughter down did fall.
And Lordes at tables round in solempne dayes did feast and dine.
There was besides all this, full many an ymage olde and fine Of antike Cedar wrought, and row by row his graunsirs tall Both Italus and Sabin kyngs, and he that first of all Did plant Italia vynes, Saturnus olde, with crooked hooke In hand, and doublefaced Ianus slie did backeward looke, At entry first they stoode, and other kynges of olde discent, That for their countreis loue, in battayle fight their blood had spent.
And ouer this, there hangs much enmies harneis fixt on height, And spoyles, and captiue chares, and halberd axes, huge of weight, And helmet crestes, and brasen boltyng barres of conquerd townes, With speares, and battrid shéelds, topps of ships, and garland crownes.
Himself in kyngly throne, with cuttid coape, most like a God In heauenly armour sat, and held in hand his bagle rod.
Dame Circes déere his spouse from shape of mankinde did remoue.
She chaunged him by charme, and smit his head with golden spray.
And poysoned drinkyng draughtes, and him of man she made a iay, And to the woods he flew, with speckled wings of colours gay.
In such a temple, and so costly seat, and comly wrought,
If fréendship such he séekes, and if he list this leage to bynde:)
His right hand ones to touche, shal pledge of peace remayne to mée.
Depart your way and to your kyng do you my wordes declare: doughter haue, whom ioyne to neighbour none skarcely dare For tokens downe from heauen, for woonders dayly thicke that rise.
The destnies do forbid, and prophetes bookes pronounce likewise, That for the peoples wealth a straunger borne should haue that chaunce, Whose famous bloud should to the starres of heauen our name aduaunce.
Perhaps him fortune cals, and if in minde rightly gesse: This man is he, and if gods will so be, would no lesse.
These thinges he spake, and horses straight from stables furth he calles, Thrée hundred fresh there stoode, at mangers hie bestowd in stalles.
For euery Troyan knight, a palfray braue he bids out bryng, In crimsin couerid all, and of their féete as swift as wyng.
Their brestes embroydred gilt, their poitrels pendant compasfolde, All gilded glistryng bright, and vnder téeth they gnaw their golde.
charet for Aeneas eke, with coursers like in tire, Of heauenly séede, and from their nosethrils fierce outbreathyng fier.
To mixe with mortall stéedes, and stale the stormes for that intent.
With such rewards, and with kyng Latins woords, the knights of Troy On horses hie returne, and peace they bryng with feastfull ioy.
Behold, from Craecia lande dame Iuno Quéene did than remoue, (The testy spouse of Ioue and hie on cloudes she stoode aboue Beholdyng all these things, and from the Cape of Sicil strond She vewd the Troian fléete, and army saufly set a lond, She séeth Aeneas glad, and plattes vprise for men to dwell, And nauy desert stand: with boylyng moode her brest doth swell.
Than shakyng mad her head, her wrathfull hart did thus expell.
This fortune vile of Troy, how euery chaunce my purpose lettes? Where they not cleane downkilled? yet could they not be cleane destroid? Were they not caught? yet could they not be caught? hath fier them noid? Hath burnyng Troy them burnt? but through the thro~gs, through ye fiers They founde away? wéene against their lucke my power expiers.
Or haue left my wrath? and yet not fylde am falne at rest? Expulsed from their land them pursued, and down opprest
With totall power of stormes, and totall seas on them brought.
Both force of skies and déepes on them spent, and all for nought.
What good did Scilla me? what coulde preuayle Charibdis wood? Or Sirtes parlous sands? be they not now in Tyber flood? In spite of seas, and mée? and where they wisht are setled sure? Yet Mars could haue the might to kill down quite without recure, The hugye Centaurs kinde.
Diana did of gods obtayne, On auncient Calidon to wreake, while one man did remayne.
For what offence? or how could Centaurs so, such wrath deserue? But I, the mighty spouse of Ioue, whom all things els should serue? That nothyng left vntried, to euery shift my self transformde: My strength, my practise spent, and yet my purpose vnperformd: Aeneas makes me shrinke, and Troyes of me shall conquest crake.
What should therefore doubt where euer can my fréends to make? Since heauens may not mooue, yet pits of Hell will vprake.
From Italy to kéepe them of, no shift see can holde.
Yet still prolong the time, and discorde foule betwéen them bréede, And peoples both distroy, were in my minde a worthy déede.
The stepsoune and the father both, shall haue theyr loueday fée, With Troians and with Rutils bloud, this wenche endowde shalbée.
Shall bryng again to dust this seconde Troy, by mine aduise.
Nor Priams wife alone shalbe, whose wombe a brond of fier, To world did bryng, but like successe giue this gentle uier.
These things whan she had sayd, adown on earth she gréesly falles, From darke infernall damps, Alecto mournfull vp she calles.
Alecto foulest fende, in dolefull warres that doth delite, And wrathes, and treasons vile, and sinnes, and slaunders, and despite.
dampned monster grimme, whom all her sisters deadly hates, Her father Pluto lothes, and euermore she bréedes debates.
Such faces foule she shiftes, so many mouthes she turnyng makes, So serpentfull she séemes, and ouer all begrowen with snakes.
Whom Iuno quickned thus, and soone with spéeche she set on fier.
Thou childe of night: Do (virgin) this for me at my desier.
This trauail shalbe thine, let not our honour shrink nor quayle,
Let not the Troians league with kyng Latinus ought preuayle.
Nor let them lande obtayne, nor yet this wedlocke to perswade,
Thou best canst worke this feate: Of strife and wo thou hast the trade, Thou fréendshippes all canst cut, and brethren kinde constraine to fight, And townes vntwine with hate, and cities whole subuert with spight, And houses burne with brondes, a thousand shiftes thou hast to spill, thousand names of harmes, now shake thy self, and worke thy fill.
Giue causes thick of warre, disturbe this peace that is begonne, Set al their youth in armes, and to their slaughters let them ronne.
And first to Latium land, and vp kinge Latines house she sties, And to the Quéene Amata first in secret sort she slides, Behinde her chamber dore, and close her selfe in silence hides,
Both Turnus care and wrath, her female brest enflamyng broyld.
To whom this goddesse, from her vgly hear one viper blew Did draw, and in her bosom soft against her hart she threw.
That therby all her house with sondrie mischiefs should be vext.
He créepyng through her clothes, her tender breast approchyng next, Did folde himself vnfelt, and serpentes foule within her breathes Than shiftyng sondry shappes, about her neck himself he wreathes, And séemes a golden cheine, sometimes a hearlace longe to knit, To rolle her lockes, and thus from limme to limme doth fall and flit.
And while the poyson first, and ticklyng sting with sokyng sinkes, And gropes her gristlebones, and venim droppes her sences drinkes.
Nor yet in minde the burnyng flame did rage without restraint, More soberly she spake, as mothers vse, and made her plaint.
Oft wéepyng for her child, and oft for Troians wedlocke day.
To wandryng outlawes shall Lauinia thus be giuen away? man: nor of your self regard, nor doughter mercy showes? Nor me her mother (wretch) whom with the next northwind yt blowes This traitour will forsake? and to the seas the pyrat thief, Our virgin doughter steale, and spoyle from me my comfort chief? Dissemblyng rouer vile? hath not the like, ere this be séene? Did Paris so not cloyne from lands of Greece dame Helen quéene? Where is your godly minde? your woonted carck of contrey déere? And faith so often plight in Turnus hand, your kinsman néere? If son in law from countries straunge, wée only must admit: As Faunus answers hids, and in your breast it doth so sit: All lands that of themselues from our estate are seuered cleane,
call them straunge, and so take, in déede the gods do meane.
Than Turnus (if ye list his elders line to call in minde) Of great Micena towne, and middes of Greece you shall him finde.
With language like, whan she Latinus minde in vayne had felt, And séeth him still withstand, and poyson more did inward melt, Which from the serpent shed, and all her limmes infectyng straied: Than verily with monsters huge affright, and déepe dismaied, She raylyng rampes and runnes, and through the towne she troubleth al.
as whan by strength of slyng is cast a whirlyng ball,
Whom boyes for their disport, in cloyster wide, or vacant halles Infentif driue with noyse.
The carelesse prease pursues, with wondryng much the bowl of boxe, From youth to youth that rolles, their corage kindlith more by knoxe.
None otherwise, and with no lesse concours she gaddes about, Through cities middes and townes, and people thicke she gathereth out.
Besides all this in woods, with faynyng feast of Bacchus name, greater mischief springes, and fransie more and voyde of shame, She flies abroade, and in the busshie hilles her doughter hides, The Troians to preuent, while day of wedlocke passyng slides.
For thée alone, This virgin worthy is, thou shalt her wed or neuer none.
Thou god, thy custome is, to shake triumphant hie thy speares, Thy chief delite is daunse, thou comly kéepest thy holy heares.
The Fame outflies, and madnesse like enflames the mountayne wiues, To seeke them dwellinges new, the Quéenes example out them driues.
Their houses all they leaue, and with their heares disheuilid bare, Their naked neckes they wag, and frantiklyke they rage and fare.
Some other lift their voyce, and skies they fill with quaueryng shrickes, And girt in skinnes they iet, with vinetrée garlands borne on prickes.
Her self among the middes with flamyng torch in hand outsprynges.
Proclames her doughter bryde, and Turnus wedlockes feast she singes, With wrestyng wilde her face, and sodenly with bloudread eyen She makes a noyse.
Who euer Latine bloud doth loue, and you that mothers be, Vnlace your heades attyre, and celebrate this daunce with me.
To Bacchus let vs singe and to the mountaines out go we, If any gentell hart doth pitie this my wofull plight,
If any touched be with iust remorse of mothers right.
Thus into desert mountayne woods, and hauntes of beastes vnmilde, Alecto stingyng driues this carefull Quéene with madnesse wilde.
Whan she with mischeif such kyng Latins counsell troubled had, And topsituruy tost his houshold all with sorowes sad: Incontinent this dolefull dame vpsterts, with waylfull winges,
Which citie, whan dame Danae by stormes was cast on grounde, Men say she first did builde, and for a vow the same did founde.
place, which of our gransirs olde did Ardea name obtayne, Of anticke date, and yet the name of great Arde doth remayne.
The fortune, sometime was: there Turnus kyng in toures of might, Was takyng swéet his rest, and sléepyng sounde at darke midnight.
Alecto than, her frownyng face, and fendly limmes of wormes Puts of, and to a woman old in likenesse her transformes.
Her forhead foule with wrinckels long she plowes, and horewhite heares In cap and kerchief knittes, and Oliue braunche theron she weares.
And sodenly before his eies with these woordes she appéeres.
Why Turnus? wilt thou sée thy labours longe thus lost in vayne? And canst thou suffer Troian clownes thy kyngdom thus obtayne? Kyng Latin thée reiectes, and with thy bloud that thou hast bought, Thy wedlock he denies, and heyres of aliens in are brought.
Go now, go venture yet thy self in danger, laught to skorne.
Go fight, and vanquish yet the Tirrhens host, their enmies sworne.
Bring Latines to their peace, and kill their foes, for thanke forlorne.
These thinges to thée to tell (where now thou liest in pleasant rest) Almighty Iuno bad, and me this time on message drest.
Wherfore come of, in mustryng call thy youth, and through thy landes In harneis put thy power, come boldly forth with all thy bandes, And Troians now by Tiber flood that sit, with captaynes all, Destroy them down to death, and burne their ships resist that shall.
The great assent of heauenly gods so biddes, and kyng Latine, If he refuse to obey, and to thy wedlocke due encline: Than let him féele, and Turnus power at last repentyng know.
The bachler hearyng this, to her in mockyng made a mow.
The nauy lately brought to Tiber shore: Not as thou dost coniect, hath béen to me vntolde before.
Fayne me no néedelesse feare, no such tumult, nor Iuno Quéene Vnmindefull is of vs.
But thou a dotyng trot, whom withryd age from trueth exiles, In vayn thy self dost vexe, with causelesse carke (O foole therwhiles) And kings affayres, warres with néedelesse feare thy minde begiles.
More méete thy temple kéepe, and serue thy gods good aged crone.
To men belonges the warres, let men with warres and peace alone.
In talkyng thus: Alecto flamyng wood with wrathfull looke Vprose, and sodenly his limmes a tremblyng palsie tooke.
His eyes vpstaryng stoode such sundrie faces out she settes, So many hissyng snakes, so many wayes she fomyng frettes.
Than burnyng broad with eyes, as he in space would more haue spoke, She thrust him of, and serpentes twaine from among her locks she broke And strake him, loud than from her mouth these words she kest wt smoke Lo, the dotyng trotte whom witherid age from trueth exiles.
Whom kynges affayres and warres with néedlesse carke affraid begiles.
Looke herevpon: lo, here am, of hagges infernall most, Both warres, and death in hand bryng.
So speakyng, to the yonge mans brest a firebrond hoat she cast, With blustryng smoky light, and in his hart she fixt it fast.
Than from his dead sléepe feare him brake, his bones and all his limmes On water brastyng out, and streamyng swet down gushyng swimmes.
For armour, mad he crieth: for armour, house, and bed he turnes, With cursed rage of warres, and loue of stéele that inward burnes.
His wrath vpswelles, as whan a caudron great is set on fyre, And stickes are kindled fast, and flame with noyse doth close vpspyre, The liquor leapes for heate, and water waues vptossyng toyles In smoke, and ouer flowyng flood of fome redoundyng boyles, Nor can it self receyue, the vapor blacke in ayer vp flies.
choyce therfore of youth to kyng Latine to sende he hies, Renounsing league of peace, and bids him straight prepare to fight, To cleare the coast from foes, and to defende Italias right, Or he agaynst them both with power sufficyng will descend.
Whan this was sayd, his gods he calles with vows, good lucke to send.
Than straight the Rutils striue, who shalbe first to serue the wars, Eche man himself exhorts, him beauty fresh of youth prefars, Him kings his gransirs moues, him déedes of armes before time tried.
While Turnus thus the Rutils mindes with boldenesse fiercely plied:
Alecto to the Troian nation drew, and foule with wynges,
Where fayre Ascanius stoode, and on the shore the time to passe With engins after beastes, and course of runnyng huntyng was.
There sodenly, among his houndes, this virgin vile of Hell Did cast a trayne, and by the suite their noses fild with smell, Harte to finde and rouse, which afterward of mischiefs all Was chiefest cause, and first the plowmen made to fighting fall.
Harte there was of comely porte, and huge with hornes yspred,
Whom Tirrhus children (from the dug withdrawen) for pleasure bred,
And Tirrhus great their sier, that for the kyng had all the charge Of beastes, and trusted was with heardes that fed in pastures large.
Him tame at euery becke their sister Siluia déere did loue, And wreathyng garland flowres, would trimly trick his hornes aboue, And pure in fountaynes washe, and comely kembe his wanton lockes.
He suffryng euery hand, his maisters bourd, and féedyng flockes Did vse, and thence abroad in woods, and through his woonted gate, He would returne to home, though night on him were nere so late, Him wandryng loof astray, where childe Ascanius swift did hunt, His houndes before them had, as he by custome kept his wont, To soyle himself in flood, and vnder banckes to voyde the heat.
Ascanius kindled than, with loue of prayse and corage great, His dart for ioy outdrew, and crooked bowe he bent of horne, Desirous of that stagge, and seldom sawe the like beforne.
Nor from his hand the goddesse absent was, but sharpely sent The quarrey through the paunche, and through the guts wt sounding we~t The wounded beast forthwith vnto his maisters house he drew, And brayed with piteous noyse, and waylyngs loud he bléedyng threw, Like one beséeching helpe, and all the house with mournyng vext.
Their sister Siluia, beatyng both her handes, for wo perplext, Outcalles the hines for ayde, and plowmen tough, and neighbors next.
They sodenly (for in the woods the plage yet lurkyng sat) Assemblyng flocke themselues, one brought in hand a burned bat, Another caught a clubbe, with heauy knobbes, and what they founde: Echman outhrynges, wrath wepon makes, them Tirrhus gathreth round As he by chaunce that time with earnest minde an oke did cliue In quarter shides, and wedges strong with force therin did driue.
He tooke his axe, and downe with threatning huge descendyng blowes,
But from her tootyng place Alecto foule that mischief sowes, (Whan she her time espied) she flew, and tooke the houses hie, And on the stable top she sat, to reare the countrey crie.
Her fendly voyce she lifts, in crooked crinkled horne on height, And blew the heardmans blast, and wonted signe to rise and fight, So loude: that with the sounde thereof, the trées with tremblyng shakes And caues of mountayne rocks, and woods of déepnes tho~dring makes.
The lakes aloof it heard, and floods and fountaynes neighbours all, And sulphur streames of Nar and mountayne waters downe that fall And trembling mothers to their breast did clasp their children small.
Than verily vnto that noyse, where first their trompet blew, The countrey clownes vprose, with tooles, and wepons thick they drew, Stifnecked plowmen stoute: the Troian youth also brake out, With open campe, and to Ascanius rescue drewe for doubt.
Their armies out they spreade not now like fraies of countreis chubs.
Nor worke with burned bats, nor sharped stakes, nor mountayn clubs.
But trie with edged tooles, and euery féelde with swordes vpright, As stubble starckly stands, and thicke with pointes of weapons pight, The shéelde with sunne vpshines, and to the cloudes repulse their light As whan the tempest riseth first, and seas doth white beginne By small and small to swell, and belchyng flouds reboyle within, At last aloft it mountes, and to the skies the bottom skippes.
Before the voward first, an arowe swift that soundyng slippes.
Doth Almon throw to ground, that Tirrhus childe and eldest was, Beneath his throate it stack, and where his breath and voyce should pas It stopt, and with his tender life expiring left his blood.
About him bodies thicke of men, and olde Galesus good In medlyng making peace, a man of right and iustnesse most That was, and greatest wealth sometime in all Italia cost.
Fiue flockes of shéepe he had, and heards of cattels féeding fiue, And soile so much did turn, as plowes a hundred still did driue.
While these things woorking were with equal chaunce on both the parts: The spitefull Goddesse spied so great successe in al her artes, And peoples fierce of both, with blood and battel ful embrewd.
And saw their armies ioynt in flaughters vile together glewd: She left Italia land, and through the skies of compas wide, Dame Iuno to she comes, and thus she spake with bragging pride.
Lo thy request is done, now strife, and warres among them is,
Go bid them fréendly ioyne, and louyngly like neighbors kisse,
Since Troians haue begun Italians blood thus much to spill:
Yet more shall augment (if may know it be thy will) The townes and borders next will with rumours set on fier, And make them such vprore, that battels mad thei shal desier, And bustling run to help, and euery sielde with armour spréede, Than Iuno said: ynough there is of false deceite and dréede, Good causes stands of warre.
Together now sée they roonne, With bloodshed both embrued, this game of thine is well begoonne.
Such wedlocks let them make, that goodly broode, that Venus elfe.
Such feaste is for them fit, and for the kinge Latine him self.
Thy person ouer mortall skies with longer leaue to stray: The guider great of heauen for ease of mandkind doth denay.
Giue place this time, if any chaunce or trauaile be behinde, My self shall take that charge.
She mountyng furth did flie, with squeakyng wings of lothly snakes.
And leauyng light of skies, her wonted seat in Hell she takes.
Right notable, and for the maruell much in countreys tolde.
darsome vale and déepe, with woods encompast thicke on sides, And headlong down there sinkes, in middes of rockes that hils deuides, roryng stinkyng poole, and breakyng stones the brooke doth sounde.
dongeon darke there is, and dreedfull gulf of gapyng grounde, Where deadly breath outbreakes.
Alecto there (so god did please) Did hide her hatefull head, and heauen and earth thereby did ease.
Nor nothyng lesse this while, dame Iunos hand did workyng cease.
The numbers all of heardes, vnto the citie came with prease, To kyng Latinus court, and brought in sight the bodies twayne, Of Almon flouryng lad, and good Galesus fouly slayne.
They crie their gods for aide, and to the kynge their case complayne.
In middes of that, is Turnus nere at hand, with sworde and fire He threatneth Latin kyng, that Troians wedlocke would requyre.
Than from the woods the wiues, whom Bacchus daunce astoined wilde Cam rampyng down wt dro~mes ye quéenes respect doth giue them sprite.
From euery coast men come, and with the Troians crie to fight, Eche one agaynst al right, against all gods, for warre doth call.
The subiectes swarmyng rise, and to kyng Latins court they fall.
He, like a rocke in seas resistyng standes, vnmoouid, fast, Full like a rocke in seas, whan surgyng waues with winde are cast, Whom strokes of water strikes, with barkyng sound, and beates about, It self with weight it staies, the flouds in vayne their fomyng spout, With ratlyng loud of stones the sides repulse the fléetyng wéedes.
Whan nothyng doth preuayle, and blinde outrage his counsell leedes, And after Iunos becke he séeth how backward thinges appéeres: Protestyng much his gods, and aier of skies that nothyng héeres, Wée runne to wracke ({quod} he) that wo is me, with tempest borne.
Your selues shall first repent, and pay for this your bloud for sworne.
wretched soules, sinfull Turnus, thou shalt bide the paynes, And call to late thy gods, a dolefull death for thée remaynes.
For am sauf at rest, my feble ship is brought to shore, Of happy funerals am dispoyld.
And made no talkyng more: But lockt himself in walles, and rule of thyngs did cleane forsake.
The maner was in Latium lande, which cities all did take, And sacred custome kept, now Rome most mighty still retaynes.
Whan first their warres they mooue, or for renowne wil take the paines To conquer feas or landes, or to the Moores giue mortall warres, To nations vnder North, and countreys distant far from starres, Or peirce with power to Inde, and séeke the seat of mornyng sunne,
Two gates of warre there be, for so theyr names at Rome they beare, Religious, sacred kept to dredfull Mars, and temple there, hundred brasen boltes, and euerlastyng strength of stéele Doth locke the same, and Ianus kéeper standes at threshold héele.
These gates, whan sentence first of fight the lordes haue full decréed, Himself the Consull chief, in robes of pompe, and purple wéede, In warlikewise begyrt, with romblyng noyse abroade displaies.
And first proclames the warres, than all the youth in their araies.
And blastes of brasen hornes with hoarce assent concordyng braies.
In such a sort, kyng Latin than the Troians to defie Commaunded was, but he the gréeuous gates would not come nie, The good prince did refuse, and from that seruice vile he fled, And kept himself in close, and vnder darkenesse hid his hed. Dame Iuno than her self, the queene of heauen, adown did slyde, And tooke the lingring gates, and shouyng set them open wyde, Them turnyng swift with noyse, and brasen postes and hinges brast.
Vncald they stur themselues, some runnes as footemen fierce in féelde, Some stur their startlyng stéedes, dust vpthrowes speares thei wéeld Ethe man for armour cries, and some their shéeldes and harneis light With fat of lard they scoure, whetstones hacke to make them bright.
Their streamers glad they beare, and trompets sound with ioy they here.
Fiue cities great therfore, with forges set in countreis nere, Renew them fighting tooles, both Tyber proude, and Atin stronge, And Arde, and Crustum toures, and great Antemna large and longe.
Their metall masse they bowe, and for their heades the stedfast plates, And buckler bosses broade, and wickers weaue for target grates.
Some beat them coates of brasse, or sturdy brestplate hard they driue, And some their gauntlets gilde, or bootes with siluer nesh contriue.
Regard of shares and culters all they leaue, both sithe and plough They turn to this, and swordes, and glauies, in furneis neale they tough.
And sagbuttes now they founde, vp goeth the signe to battell strokes.
One gettes his shéelde for hast, an other swift his horses yokes In chace to ride, and helmet bright on puttes, thréedubbled shyrtes Of Golde, with gorget great, and trusty sworde about him gyrtes,
To tell what nations tough, what captaynes fierce, what noble kinges, With armies filde the féeldes, what armour stronge, what manred bolde, Italia sacred land did flourishyng that time vpholde.
You ladies, you remember best, and vttryng best can speake.
Skant breathyng thinne of fame by vs doth passe with pipling weake.
First entreth warre from Tirrhen coast, Mezentius, tirant kyng, Despiser proude of Gods, and armies stronge with him doth bryng.
Than Lausus next his son, whose corps in beauty péere had none.
That time, and chiefest fame did beare, saue Turnus corps alone.
Prince Lausus, conquerour of beastes, and tamer strong of stéedes, thousande men from Agillina towne him after léedes.
In vayne that followd him for loue: well worthy to haue had father not so naught, and of his realme to be more glad.
Next them, triumphant fierce with stéedes that wager all did winne, Duke Auentine, sir Hercles worthy séede, of heauenly kinne: Victoriously out shewes his charet faier, and bare in shéelde His fathers armes, a hundred dreadfull dragons huge to wéelde, hundred serpentes grimme, and Hidra monster girt with snakes,
Whom Rhea virgin préest, as she to God her seruice makes, In Auentinus mount, and bushes thick by stelth out brought: Engendring mixt with God, whan Hercules had conquest wrought In Spayne, and Gerion downe kild, and to Italia strand Arriuing braught his beastes, and oxen faier had set a land.
Their parlous pykes in hand, and puncheons close in staues they beare, And pykes lyke broaches long, and fight with foyne of pointed speare.
Him self on foote, a fold of Lions huge vnweldy hide, With brestlid heares vnkemt, and tusked white, and gaping wide In helmet wise did weare, so to the court he come ful rough: All terribel, and his fathers wéede he bare on shoulders tough.
Than brethren twaine of Tiber strong, forsooke Tiburtus walles, (A towne that of their brothers name the people yet so calles.)
Both Coras and Catillus, eger knights of Greekish kynd, Before the voward went, in weapons thick as swift as wynd.
Lyke Bulles, or misbegotten Centaures twaine, from cloudy hilles Descende with stamping noise, and hedlong downe with restles willes They run, that woods do rustling yeld, and bowes with breaking crack.
Nor of Praenesta towne, the founder first therof did lacke: Vulcanus dredful sun, a king of beastes and mountaines cold, fondling found besides a fier (as all report hath told) King Ceculus, a legion large of heardmen next his side, And men of hie Praeneste towne, and al that compas wide, Dame Iunos sacred lande, and Auiena riuer chill, And al that Hernick stones (with watry springs bedewed) do till.
Whome Amaseni pastures féedes, and ritch Anagnia féelds, Nor harneis to them all, nor charrets ratling ben, nor shéelds.
The greatest sort with slinges, their plummet lompes of lead out squats.
And some their sheues of dartes, their heads defensed broade with hats Of heary skinnes of wolues, their rightside shankes be naked bare.
Such is their shift, their leftside legges with raw hides couered are.
But king Messapus, Neptunes child, that coursers wild can tyer, Whom nether strength of stéele can ouerthrowe, nor force of fier, His peoples long in rest, and out of vre of battel strife; Doth sodenly vpcal, and teach to handle sword and knife.
They from their Fescen hilles, and from Faliscus equal toftes, They from Soractus towers, and yelow féeldes of Flauine croftes, And mount of Ciminus with lake, where Capens woods outsprang,
By numbers like they went, and on their king in praise they sang.
As swannes, that in the waueringe cloudes do flie, with sounding swéete, Returning from their foodes, whan singing flocks in one do méete, With stretched necks, their melody they yeld, their mixed voyce, Rebounding beates the skies, that lakes and riuers do reioyce, And Asia longe aloofe.
Nor by their noyse men knew, that harnest bands their clattring cast.
But lyke a cloude of foules, that from the seas were forcid fast, And neare to shore were come, and hoarce with cries their chanel past.
Behold from Sabines auncient bloode, sir Clausus doth procéede, With mighty throng, and like a thronge him self, asmuch to dréede.
From whom descending comes both tribe, and house of Claudia line In Latium land, since Rome to Sabines first did part incline.
And al Mutusca strength, that Oliues beare, and all their downes, They that Nomentum citie kept, and rosy countreis pure Of Velin, and Seuerus hylles, and al that thought them sure In Tetrix rocky cragges, and such as turne the fertile soile Of Forulos, and where Himella streame ful fast doth boyle.
And they that Tiber waters drinkes, or Fabaris good floodes.
Or who~ Casperia sent, or Nursia cold for want of woodes.
And peisants al of Latine land, and seamen come from ships.
And all that feete in cursyd streames of dampned Allia dippes.
As thick as winter waues in marble seas as turnd and tost.
Whan stormes and tempest rise, and sight of starres and light is lost.
Or like to standing corne, that parchid is with heat of sonne: So thick the people prease, from euery coast to warre they ronne.
The ratling shieldes resound, the soyl with trampling beaten quakes.
Than Agamemnons child, an enmy old of Troy, a wakes, Halesus, borne on steedes, and to king Turnus armies great, thousand people brings, of them that ground with mattockes beat To till the blisfull vaines, and they that rake the mountaines fat, Of Messica, and nere the seas al husbandment that sat.
And all Auruncus youth, and they that Caleis lande forsooke And dwellers all beside the fourdes of sholde VVlturnus brooke.
Their weapons troncheons be, and malles of maces, smal of length.
But them by lethrin thongs they while and draw, such is their gise,
Their lefthands Targets kéepe, and hooked Fawchons from them flies.
Nor thou from this accompt, and verses mine shalt passe vntolde Ebalus, whom Telon gat (as goeth reporte of olde) Of lady Sebethis (that Nimphe whan he the kyngdome hent Of Capreas, and landes, but not his sonne therwith content: Sarrastes people riche with empier sore that time did tread, And welthy countries large, where Sarnus brooke to sea doth lead, And they that Batulus doth holde, and Rufas féeldes obiect, And all that frutefull vale, that Bella citie may prospect.
Like Almain rutters, borespeares longe they whirle, or foynyng forks, Their nuddockes bolstred ben, and skulles of heads with barkes of corks Thei shine with brasen sheeldes, thei shine with swords, rapiers bright.
And thée to warres thy countrey Nursa sent, noble knight, Vfens, much renowmed both of déedes, and great good chaunce, Whose mountayne people strong, with practise longe of sworde launce, And huntyng still in woods, and breakyng clottes ben hard of flesh.
They weaponed till the grounde, and euer more their prayes a fresh They fetch from countreys nere, it doth them good to driue and watche.
They liue by bootie spoyle, it is their owne what ere they catche.
Than from Marrhubia there came a Preist, and prophet gay.
His helmet compas knit with lucky bowes of Oliue spray.
From kyng Archippus sent, most valiaunt knight of Vmber lande, That woonted was with songes, and with his charmes, and holy hand, All poysoned adders kinde, and serpentes dreadfull cast on sléepe, And calm their wrathes and stinges, and from their bityng peoples kéepe And ease with art their woundes, and venims all confounde and choke.
But not the Troyan blade coulde he auoyde nor heale the stroke Of great Aeneas dint, nor to his woundes coulde helpe him ought His sléeping songs in vain, nor lechecraft herbes on mountaynes sought.
For thée, the woods did wayle, for thée the fountaynes cleare as glasse: For thée, the waters wept: and lakes lamentyng cried alas: In all Angitia land.
Than of Hippolitus also, the childe most worthy went, Syr Virbius, whom fresh of fame his mother Aritia sent, Brought vp in saluage woods, and by the banckes of holsome streames Of dame Dianas walke, and Nimphe Egerias desert realmes.
For whan Hippolitus (by olde report) was put to payne, And by his stepdams craft, was of his father giltlesse slayne,
In péeces drawn with stéedes, agayn to breath and worldly skies, He was (men say) vpcald, and eft from death to life did rise, By power of Phoebus herbes, and at Dianas sute for loue.
The almighty father than, and king of heauen that reygnes aboue, Disdaining, that a mortal man from dead soules might reuart:
Diana than, Hippolitus to secret woodes withdrew, From fight of man, and to Egeria Nimphe did him betake, Where he alone in desert groues doth worldly care forsake, Nor praise of people séekes, but leading life as he best can,
He yet remaynes, with name conuerted Virbius, Twise a man.
Therfore it is, that from Dianas woodes, and temples cléere All horses ben forbyd, nor to her seruice may come néere.
For they affraied did flée, at sight of monsters than that sprang From seas, and down the yong man threw, and charet ouerflang.
Yet nerethelesse his son, couragiously with horse in féeld Did ronne, and fyrisprited stéeds in charet fierce did wéeld.
Displaies himself in armes, aboue all men with head vpright.
Whose triple crownid creast, and helmet hie, with vgly pawes Chimera monster holdes, and sparcling flames she spoutes at iawes.
The more she fretting fumes, and more with burnings waxeth wood: The more that fighting feeldes embrew them selfs in sheding blood.
But on his target smothe, dame Io standes, with hornes vpright, Imboasid pure in gold, euen like a cowe, with hear in sight.
storie huge to learne: and Argus, with his hundred eien, Did kéepe that virgin there: so portraid was that worck deuine: And Inachus his noble streame did powre from pitcher fine.
cloude of footemen following him pursues, and mixt with dust, The shieldes, and harneis dimmes, clustring thick in throngs thei thrust As well the Greekish youth, as al the strength of Rutill handes, Auruncus ayde, and all Sicanus cities auncient bandes.
Sacrana crewes, Labicus painted buclers, and besides All such as Tyber hilles, and sacred shore therof deuydes, That Rutil ground vpgrubbes, and with their shares applie the soyle, And al that on the mountains neck of Circes seat do toyle.
And Anxurs holy hilles, where Ioue himself is patron chief.
Faronia ioyfull town, of gréene wood groue that tooke relief.
The way that Vfens mighty streame doth stray, and black with pooles, Doth séeke by déepest bales, and in the seas himself he cooles,
And ouer this, there came from Volsca realme, Camilla stout,
With trowpes of horsemen fresh, and glistring footemen many arout.
She closid last her crewes, a woman warlike, strong and sterne.
She neither weauing tooles, nor distaffe worke did vse or lerne.
Nor female fingers had, but bruntes of warres Virago grymme Wold beare, and ouerpasse the windes, with lightnes swift of lymme.
She for a pastime wold, on croppes vpright of standing corne Haue flowen, and with her tender féete, haue neuer an eare down borne.
Or in the middes of seas, on swelling waues before they réele, Wolde course haue fet, and neither dipt in water, toe nor héele.
From houses al and féeldes, the youth with wondring issued out, And matrons gasing stood, both how she rides behind the rout: How princely purple kéepes her shulders light, how trym her heares With gold are vnderknit, her quiuer gorgeous how she beares, And dreadful launce of length, and pointed like to fosters speares.
Turnus giueth a signe of warre out of Laurentum castle, and ioyneth vnto him self in ayd all Latium, and the cities neare aboute: Venulus also is sent to Arpos vnto Diomedes to perswade him to warre by likenesse of the danger.
Wherat Aeneas mooued, and distrustyng the smalenesse of his power: is admonished by Tiberinus, and brought vp alonge the riuer into that place where Rome was afterward buylded, and there requireth ayde of kyng Euander, who fliyng forth of Arcadia: founded a citie vpon the hill Palatinus, called Pallanteum.
When Euander vnderstoode the cause of Aeneas co~myng, he courteously receaueth him into his house, and takyng him with him vnto the sacrafice and solemnities of Hercules wherein he was then busie: sheweth him the cause, and the maner of the sacrafice, and reciteth to his gest the names of the cheifest places in those quarters The next day Aeneas beyng ayded with foure hundred horsemen whom Pallas, Euanders only sonne did gouerne, and part of the power he sendeth vnto his men downe the streame, him self with the residue goeth to Agylla, the most flouryshyng citie of Tyrrhens who bare deadly hatred agaynst Mezentius, whom for his intollerable crueltie, they had driuen out of his kyngedome.
In this whyle, Vulcane entised therto by the flattery of Venus maketh armour for his sonne in law, whiche she bryngeth vnto Aeneas.
Who beyng surprised with he beutie therof: diligently woundreth at euery thynge therin, especially his targat, wherin were curiously engrauen such noble exploytes as should be valiantly atchiued, by his worthy posteritie.
WHen signe of war from Laurent towres king Turnus vp did reare, And hornes vp blowen wish blasses, their tre~blyng tunes full hoarce did teare, When first his egre stéedes, and armour clattryng gan to clashe: Mens mindes molested rose, and sodenly vnbrydeled rashe The youth for madnesse runnes, all Latin townes for quakyng feare Tumultuous clustryng ioyne, and league confeddryng knit they sweare.
Messapus and duke Vfens leaders chief, and puft with pride Mezentius gods dispiser, power of men from euery side They draw, and voyde of filmen wide dispeoplyng spoyle the shyres.
Then to the mightie towne of Diomedes with desires Is Venulus out sent, his needefull strength in time to call, Instructed playne by mouth, what thyng to him declare he shall: How Troians to Italia landes are come, and what a fléete Aeneas bryngs of ships, and how their gods that vnder féete Were conquerd late by Greekes, he now exaltyng sets in fame, And kyng will néedes be cald, and saith him destnie giues that name, Dilatyng more, how many nations béen that ioygne their déedes With Troy: and how the Troian name in Latium shrewdly spréedes, What these beginnyngs meane, and if his chaunce should giue successe What sequel worke he would: more manifest him self may gesse Then either Turnus kyng, or kyng Latinus list expresse.
All which consideryng great, The Troian prince did view, and fluddes of care his breast did beat.
His wisdom swift now here, now there, he kest, and did deuide In sundrie thoughts his minde: and ech deuise he tost and tried: As in some brasen cawdrons lippes, where water standyng streames, When sunne reflected shines, or face of Moone with quiueryng beames: The twincklyng light vp leapes, eche corner séekes and flickering flits, Now hie, now low, and tops of house, and rafters waueryng hits.
Then was it night, and creatures all that wéery were on grounde, Both byrdes groueling kindes of beastes déepe sleape hath setled sound: When lorde Aeneas vnderneath colde skies in sight of stars, Perturbed much in minde with troublous carcks of heauy wars: As on a banke he sat, sore musyng sad with carefull brest: He layde him downe at last, and late his limmes he gaue to rest.
To him the god of Tiber flood, which rules that pleasant place,
Among the Poppler leaues in grisell gowne of droppyng wéedes, sayle his shulders spred, his hear beshadowed was with réedes, Than speaking thus, Aeneas hart with comfort words he feedes.
heauenly childe of gods, that Troy destroyed dost now reore, Which bringst vs Troian wals, and lastyng wealth for euermore, Longe looked for of Laurent feeldes, and townes of Latium great, Here is thy certein house: do thou not shrinke thy certein seate, Nor feare thée not for all these threatnynges huge: all bréede and yres Of gods appeased cease.
And now to thee (least fansie vayne this dreame thou do suppose)

No fables pronunce, now of this thing thou hast in hande, How thou shalt victour be giue eare in brief wil thée tell.
nation on these fronters cald Arcadia neare doth dwell: From Pallants line they came, and king Euander vp they tooke, They chase theyr place, and citie builded on that mountaines nooke, Which of his grandsier Pallant slain, now Palanteum hights.
Take them to thy relief, and league with them compounde and smight, Myself along these bancks shal thée conduct with passage light, Against these streames with ores: that nothing let thy spéede to stay.
Arise, go to thou goddesse son: and first when starres decaye To Iuno make thy vowe: her threatning mode and wrahtful tene With prayers meekly please: and when thy conquestes ended bene, Than me thou shalt reward: for am he that fléeting déepe Do straine these bancks thou séest, and pastures fat do féede and kéepe, Most ioyfull Tyber blue, best liked streame to heauens on hie, Here is my mighty house, here cities great my head may spie.
He sayd: And sodainly his flood, he foltring mixt in lake From sight.
Aeneas eies both night and sléepe did than forsake, He rose, and with his face vpright against the mounting sonne, Whan first his hands he dipt in waters pure that there did ronne, He helde them vp to skies: and thus his voice he straight begonne.
Nimphes, Laurent Nimphes, Quéene of streames waters cléere And thou Tyber thou blessed flood and father déere, Receaue Aeneas now, and from these daungers last defend.
Where euer sacred lake, that pitie such dost vs extend In our extreme distresse, what euer soyle and fountaine faire Conteines thy holy head: vnto thy seate wil repaire, Myne honours euer due, and euer gifts thou shalt haue good, Hornfronted kingly god, of westerne streames Imperial flood, Be with vs, this time, and al thy grace do prosper full.
So spake he than, and from his fléete two barges apt doth cull,
With rancks of rowers twayne, and all his campe in armour set.
For by the shore among the rootes on ground in gréene wood shawe
Sowe of syse vnséene, all colour white with broode they sawe.
Whom good Aeneas vnto thée (o Iuno most of powre) Euen all to thée he kild, and on thine altars did auowre.
That liuelong night did Tyber flood his streames downe couch and calme With lingryng soft, that neither moouyng made of waue nor walme, But milde most like a poole, or pleasant ponde of water dull, So setled smoothe it stoode: that nothyng lets their ores to pull.
Their way therefore begunne with talkyng cherely plied they fast: Thannoynted Firtrée slides, by shelues and fourdes along they past: The waters wondryng stoode, and woods with woondring gasing made At shinyng shéeldes of men, far glistryng straung of newcome trade, They gase at gorgious ships, and painted pups aloft that swims, They pluckyng swift their Ores, that night and day do tyre their lims, And reatches long they win: that trées with bowes do hide them oft, And circles wide they cut in waters gréene of shadowes soft.
And through the woods they wade, gladsom groues that grow a loft.
The flamyng sunne his compast midst of heauen had entred in:
Which now the Romain might, to match the starres haue made so tal Euander king that time, that citie kept of substance small, They swifly turne their shippes, and to the towne approchinge fall.
That day as Fortune was, Euander king in solempne guise His patrone feast did kéepe, with honours great to gods in skies.
But vnto Hercules most chief, in gréene wood groue vpstald Afront the towne.
His onely son with him was, Pallas cald) With him the chief of youth, and Senate counsell poore and good.
To gods encense they gaue, on smokyng altars moist of bloud.
When first the loftie ships they saw, and darke in shadowes lowe So slydyng through the woods, and swift with ores so silent rowe: With sodain sight affraied they rose, and tables troublyng reaue.
Whom Pallas bold forbids that offrings holy they not leaue, Himself with sworde outdrawn, against them fast to shore he flew, light? Then from the banke aloof, how sirs {quod} he? what causes new? What mooues you thus these waies vnknowe~ to serch? where would you
What people? what place dwel you? bryng you peace, or list you fight?
Than lord Aeneas from his puppe on hie this answere told, And Oliue braunch in hand betokening peace he forth did hold.
The men of Troy thou seist, and Troian weapons, Latins foes, Whom they with armour proud thus wandring stil to driue dispose, Euander kynge we séeke, go cary this and say that knights Of Troians stronge are come, and pray with him to ioine our mights.
At such a reuerent name, did Pallas then astonied stand.
Come forth ({quod} he) prince, what euer thou art, and here at hand Go speake my father to, and strait his righthand claspinge held, They landing left their flood, and to the frith they came and feld.
Then lord Aeneas to the king these wordes did fréendly moue.

King Dardan founder first of Troian townes and parent old,
That sun to Dame Electra was, as auncient Greekes haue told, To Troian Kyngdomes came, Electras father void of doubt Most mighty Atlas was, that heauens sustaines on shoulders stout.
Your line from Mercury procéedes, whom May most white of hew, On olde Cilenes Mount, conceyuing bare by storie trew.
Mayes father Atlas is, if iust report hath filde our eares.
That Atlas her begat, that stars of heauen on shulders beares, So bothe one bloud wée be, from one good spring our stocke departes.
These thynges consideryng I, by neither message, freind, nor artes, Did practise thée to groape, euen my selfe my person here ventred haue my head, and to thy court sue most dere, That nation proude of Turnus lande whose warres doth thée molest: The same doth vs likewise most deadly vexe, were wée supprest Nothing they thinke should let, but all Italia landes at eas They may subdue with yoke, and east, and west possesse the seas.

Few words at last he sayd: Most pusaunt lord (o prince of Troy How glad am of thée? how welcome here thou bringest me ioy? How wel thy parent great thou dost present: his words and voyce Me thinkes here, in great Anchises face do reioyce.

And when the morning next, on earth her light shal rendring bring: With succour home shal you send, and aid with comfort more.
Therewhiles, this offring feast (which to differ were sinne to sore) This yerely sacrifice diuine (since here fréendes we be) With gladnes let performe, and celebrate this day with me, And your confederates fare accustom now your self to byde.
Whan he thus said, the deintie meates and cups withdrawen asyde, He bids agayn restore, and Troyans set on gréene grasse bancke.
But chief, on beddes bespred with Lyons hyde of heare full rancke, Aeneas he receyues, and Maple throne to him prefarres.
Than al the princely youth, and temple préest from the altar barres Contending bring their meates, entrayles of bulls, and seruice rost, And bread in basketts lade, and wynes they skinke with cakes compost.
Aeneas iointly fed, the Troian youth also dyd dyne, With tripes of sacrid stéeres, and total backes of oxen chyne.
Whan hungre staunched was, and last of eating first gan slake, The king Euander sayd: This chéere quod he, that here we make, This offring deintie day, this yerely feast religious pure, This altar great of god, no superstition vayne obscure, Nor errour blynde began (o curteis gest) but cause extréeme, And due deserts of him that vs from daunger did redéeme,

For after conquest wrought In Spaine, (and Gerion triple bodied kilde) with booties braue: Most mighty Hercules here came, and herds of bulls he draue This way, with stéeres right huge of syse, this riuer syde they fed.
The beasts but setled wer, and brooke and vale along they spred: But Cacus fendly sprite that nothing ment but shameles theft, No mischiefe left vntried, no craft vnsought, but al things reft.
Foure goodly bodied bulles he from their pasture stealing tooke, And foure of heifers large, and most of beautie faire to looke.
And lest perhaps their féete bewray them should by steps of cleaze, He by their tailes them drew al backward plucking from their leaze.
Their treadings outward shewd, and euery path did outward guyde, And to his caue them brought, where darke with stone he did them hyde.
When men shuld seke, no signe they saw, al tracts were outward tried.
This while when Hercules from hence departing wold remoue, And gathering tooke his béeues, that ful were fed fro laundes aboue, The cattayle rearing cried, and euery wood with bellowing fild Lamenting thence to mooue, and hils with noyse they left ilwild.
One heifer lift her voice, and loude in dongeon sounding shrill: She yelling answere gaue, and Cacus heape dispointed yll.
Than verily sir Hercles furiouse minde for egre paynes Did burne with bitter gall, his armour tooles in hands he straines, His heauie clubbe with knobs, and vp that hill he ramps on hie.
There Cacus, shrincking furst and furst affrayed: our men did spie.
With troubled eies more swifter then: than winde he trudging flings, Strayght to his caue he flew, feare to his tentoes added wings.
Whan he his lodge had lockt, and by his chaines a sunder wrong His huge vnweldie stone downe let, that there for rampier hong With yron and Vulcanes art, his bolts and barrs he fastening ramd, His dongeon mouth he stopt and strong with stuffe he stifly cramd.
Behold, furthwith syr Hercles present was with flaming brest, And entries al he vewed, nowe here nowe there his eyes he kest, For angre gnashing tethe: thre times alone in feruent moode, Al Auentinus mount he compast round, and thrise he stoode, Attempting stil those gates, and strong assaulting bounst thereat In vayne, and thre times in this vale he wéery resting sat.

That rocke where hedlong next the flood, it partly low did leane, With shulders shoouing long in vayne he tried, yet adding strength: He shogging styl did striue, at last it shooke, and quite at length, He lowsened low the rootes, than sodenly where most it swaied, He ouerthrewt that with the throw, hie heauen rebounding brayed.
The banks wt murmour brake, ye streame ran backward wild affraied.
But than the caue, and Cacus vgly court disclosed cléere:
None otherwise, than if by force whole earth shuld gaping clyue, And show the infernal seates, and kingdoms pale reueling ryue: Most hateful sight should be: an endles gulf down reatching déepe, Shuld fowle apear, and crauling soules at light shuld quaking créepe.
When he with day vnloked for was caught, and shrinking low His depest den he tooke, nor neuer earst so lowde did blow: Sir Hercles with his tooles on him did prease, and weapons all He fearcely plied both loggs of tymbre long, and milstones tall.
He grunting foule at mouth (for hope was none to scape by flight) cloud of stifling stinkinge smoke (a wondrous thing to sight) He from his iawes outspued, that al the vaut with darknes stuft, Depriuing eies from sight, and through the doungeon thicke he puft, His fumes as blacke as night, and mixt with mist he perbrakt fier.
That thing sir Hercles wold not bide, but hedlong down for yre, Euen through the flames he lept, where smolthring stremes did most redound Of smoke, and where most boiling breth did caue most darke confounde.
There Cacus black in cloud, and belching fearce his burnings vaine:
He groping straitly gript, and round in knot he wound in twaine, Then crushing necke and eyes, his thirstie throte of blood did choke, Anone the gastly den wide ope is set with gates vpbroke, The cattel furth are fet, then pyles of pelfe and robbery spoyles To heauen are shewd, his carcas eke misshapen vile of foyles,
His grisly squeased eien, his lothly face, his bristled brest, His mongrel membres rough, his quenched fier in iawes opprest.
From that time furth this honor grew, that youth with gladsome game, This holy day do kepe, Potitius first began the same, And great Pinarias house, that Hercles offring euer serues, From yere to yere, and for his worship more that thus deserues: This groue and altar set, which euermore the chiefest shal Be cald of vs, and shall in dede be euer chiefe of all.
Wherefore come of, youth, and for the praise of so great gift: With braunches bynd your heads, and cups in quaffing loke you lift.
And cal our general god, and skinke furth wines with glad good wils, He said, then twisting Poppler braunch, his crown with leaues he hils, With Hercles Poppler leaues (al dooble huid) his temples tide, And sacred boll with wine in hand he gripte, then side by side Al men with feasting dranke, and bords they lade, and gods did praye.
The sun this while from skies did néere to night discending swaye.
And now the seruice priests, and furst Potitius led their bands, Of custome great in skinnes, and torches burning bare in hands.
Their presents hie they heape, that euery boord with bourden sweats, Than singing measure layes, at the altars burning daunsing round, The skipping Salii were com, with poppler braunches bounde, In raye men set them selues, the yong men here, the old men there.
How first he tender chyld his stepdaines monsters kilde with eas By hand, and serpents twain to death he wringing flat did squease.

Aeneas wondring much on euery side his eyes did cast, With euery place in minde he rauisht was, and oft enqueres Eche thing, and monuments he gladly lernes of elder yeres.

But bowes of trées them fed, and hunting hard them kept from cold, Furst from Olympus mount (right neare the skies) good Saturn old, Whan he from Ioue did flée, and from his kingdoms outlawd stood, He first that wayward skittish kynde disperst in hilles, and wood, Did bring to thrift, and gaue them lawes, and all the land this waye
And vnder that good king men say, the golden world did dure, Such pleasaunt peace he taught, and peoples kept in iustice pure: Till worser age at last, of baser sort by small and small, With mad desier of warrs, and loue to haue: corrupted all.
Than cam Ausonia stre~gth, than Scicil folks and countreys straunge, And oftentimes her name, Saturnus land was driuen to chaung.

Whyle these things hasting wer by Vulcan lord in Lemnos lande: Euander king from bed, the dawning day bad vp to stande, And early songs of birds his roof that fild with mirthfull note.

if almighty god would me my yeres of youth restore Euen as was, whan at Praeneste walles (my toupes before) fought, when heapes of conquerd shéelds victor offring brent, And with this right hand than, king Herilus to hell sent, Whose mother at his birth him gaue thrée liues in limmes to lag, (A grisly thing to speake) thrée weapons he by course did wag, Thrée times to death he must down vanquisht be, yet breathings all This righthand him bereft, and soules, and armour thrise made fall.
Not now déere son, from thyne embrasings sweete shuld be pluckt, dulcet son: nor so Mezentius borderer, blood had suckt Dispiting stil my head such murthering deathes had not béen séene, Nor such asort of burgeis wifes shuld widowes now haue béene.
But you glorious gods, thou chief in heauen that raignst on hye Most mighty Ioue, of poore Arcadia kinge respect the crie,
Giue gracious eare this tyme, and to my prayers piteous bende.
If destnies me by your good grace my sonne home saufly sende, If looking him liue: and wée in one may méete agayne: Than craue longer life, and glad shal receaue all payne.
But if (as god forefend) som sore mischaunce doth fortune threat: Now now let me depart, and cruell lyfe of casting freat,
While doubtful carck me kepes, while hope in mynd vncertain is, While thée my derling childe, myne onely ioy my parting blis, Thus haulsing here hold, er tidings worse myne eares may wound, These things his father shed at leauing last, and flat in sound With sobbing fainting fel: his pages him to house conueyed.
And now the horsmen band at open gates went out vnstayed.
Than other Troyan lords, him self in midds did Pallas ryde In glistring painted armes, and gay with cloke embroidred newe, Lyke Lucifer that gracious dawning siar, whom pure of hue Dame Venus chiefly loues aboue al fiers in heauen that shyne, Al darknes he resolues, and gladneth skies with face deuine.
The women stand on walles with trembling harts, and far with eyes Pursue their glittering harneise troupes, and clouds of dust that rise.
They through the thornie downs wher néerest way no compas makes In armour iointly ryde, hie shoutes vprise, and clustring strakes They gallup, and vnder their trampling féete the ground with breaking quakes.
Ther is a groue of gréene wood frith, by Cerits riuer celd, Religious, long and broad in reuerence kept by fathers old, Whom caues of crokid hils with dales and downs that compas fets On euery side doth close, and woods of firtree blacke besets.
To Siluan god of beasts and fields that auncient Greekes men say Did consecrat that place, and gaue both groue and feastful day, Which Greekes somtime possest of Latium countrey first the lands.
Not far from thence duke Tarchons host, and al Aetruria hands Incamped saulfly lay, and from the hill their legions strong Al plaine might now be vewed, that broad in fields outstretched long.
Aeneas to that place, and warlike youth, in mynd wel pleasd Alighting, wery went, and horses trymd, and bodies easd.
But goddesse Venus whyte, from through the clouds descending clere Was ready there with gitfs, and to her sonne approching nere: Whan secret him she saw, far from the flood in crooked vale She offring shewed her self, and thus she shortly brake her tale.
Lo here my husbands worke, my promise due, cast of thy doubt son: nor fear not now to coape with al proude Laurents rout, And Turnus now to combat cal, though he be ner so stoute.
She sayd, and of her son thembrasing swéete furth with she fet.
Than vnderneth an oke in sight, those glistring armes she set.
He gladful of those gifts, with mynd for ioyes in myrth extolde With sight could not be fild, but eies on eche thing stil he rolde.
He wondreth, and betwéene his armes, and hands he oft vpturnes helme most horrible, with crests, out spitting flames that burnes.
murthring fatal blade, a brestplate stif of bras most fine, All bloodread, sanguine, bygge, like many tymes whan sun doth shyne, Some blue cloud catcheth beames, and burning bright with ruddy rayes loof it self it shewes, and streaming light lykewise displayes.
Then bootes of siluer light enameld gorgeous mixt with gold.
speare also with shéeld, whose wondrous worke can not be told.
(Not ignoraunt of age to come, and destnies that shoulde fall) The firie puissaunt god had made: there all Ascanius race In order faire was wrought, and foughten fields in euery place.
He there also had put, where gréene the caue of Mars begins she wolfe downe was layed, and next her dugs two goodly twins, Two daggling sucking boies, her flanks betwéene thei hanging plaide, Their mammies teats they lap with hungrie lipps nothing affraide.
She turning round her neck: now one, now one, them swéetely lyckt Reforming soft their limmes, and soft with tong them smothly stryckt.
Nor far from thence was Rome, and Sabines virgins rashly raught At sight of stately playes, and thence by force for wedlocks caught, The story all there stood, and sodenly new war did rise To Romulus and Tatius old, and lords of Sabines wise.
Within a while those kings (their al contencions quenched quyte) Before Ioues altar cam, and holding bolles in armour bryghte They stood, and with a swyne downe slaine did leag conclud and smyte.
Not far from thence was Metius torne, in quarters pluckt by stéeds, But why thou Alban to thy words accordid not thy déeds? And of that lying lord did Tullus drag those false entrailes Euen through the wood, that thornes and briers with blood besprinckling, hailes.
Than king Porsenna strong commaunded Romains eft restore Their Tarquin outlawd king, and long be seiging wrang them sore.
Him angrie, threatning like, you mought see chaaf disdaining than, That Cocles durst resist while bridge behind him broken was, And Cloelia captiue wench with broken bands the streame did pas.
Stoode Manlius that champion chief, his countrey wals to saue.
He for the temple fought, and enemies clambryng downe did pull With stubble starke of stéele, the Pallas court of Rome was full.
And flickryng there in golde, the siluer Gander keakyng cried At hand, and in the Porches next the Frenchmen entryng spied.
The Frenchmen entryng were, and takyng Towres did fearce inuade, By bushes climyng close, and kept with helpe of darke night shade.
Of Gold their Tresses were, their golden garments trim them decks, In garded frocks they shine with roddid welts about theyr necks, In partlets knit with Golde, two slingyng speares eche one doth lift, In Mountayne guise, and shields of length defende their bodies swift.
Than cam the skippyng sort, in daunce disguised shakyng shanks, The Salij praunsing Priests, with mitred crownes and coppid tancks.
The Luperts naked went, and armour holy liften aloft, That down from heauen did fall, the matrones chast in Charets soft Religious led their gods, and through the town procession brought.
Along way far from thence, the dennes of Hell most déepe wer wrought, And louryng Limbo gates, with sundrie sinfull wretches pangs.
Thou Catilin wert there, on threatnyng rocke thy carcas hangs, Thy turments there thou bidest, and still dost feare those fendly iawes.
But good men by them selues, and Cato them did giue their lawes.
Among all this there went the salt sea broad with swellyng broth Of Gold, but gréene the frisking floods did fome with hoary froth.
And cut in siluer cléere the Dolphins swimming compas daunst, The streames wt tayles they swept, through ye tydes they sheri~g glau~st.
In mids were brasen fléetes of shippes, and Actia warres at large Men might haue sene, how battels both conioyning bent their charge.
The seas with harnies shines, that boyling floods with gold did spring.
With commons all, with lords, wt saints, wt gods most great of might,
Aduauncing cheif in ship, whose temples twaine with flames vpright Outsparkling spoutes a fier, his fathers star his crowne bespreds.
Another wing with prosperous windes, and Gods in army ledes Agrippa loftie prince, whose pendant streamers proud stands out, His crowne couragious shines with garlond wun from topshipsnout.
On thother part with all Barbaria force of diuerse armes Anthonius drags his traine of nacions thick, in threngs that swarmes.
He victour late in wars, from countries far wher Sun doth ryse,
From peoples blacke of Inde, from redsea shore, from eastern skies,
All Aegipt and all Asia strength extreme with him he drew,
Whom proudly (fie for shame) his Gygtian wife doth next persue.
Togither all they rusht, and pluckt with ores conflicting clasht, The waues wt wrastling fumes, fronts to fronts their ships thei crasht To chanell déepe they draw, a man would thinke ye mountaynes méete In seas, or iustlyng woods with woods hole rocks, Ilandes fléete.
So huge wt weight me~ work: fro~ towres, tops their darts down strikes Their wildfire Okam flies, and stormes outhrown of tooles with pikes.
The cloudes with cries are mixt, both ships seas with slaughters spred, All Neptunes flittryng féelds with bloudshed stremes are darkned red.
The Quéene in mids them all with timbrell noyse her bands vpcheeres, Nor yet two deadly serpent snakes, to her at backe appéeres, All monstrous kinded gods, Anubys dog that barkyng slaue: Agaynst all Romain guids (both Venus, Neptune, Pallas graue) Their weapons vp they holde, outragious Mars among them stamps, All cut in carued stéele, and hags infernall fearcely ramps.
Dame Discord through them runs, with garme~ts torne she ioyful skips, Whom grim Bellona mad pursues at hand with blouddy whips.
These thynges beholdyng thus, Apollo shootyng plied his bowe, Aloft from skies, all Aegypt than, all Inde downe couched lowe, All nations wilde of South Arabia proude for all their cracks, All Asia scattryng fled, all Sabey kyngdoms turnd their backs.
The Quéene her self was séene with winds aduaunst vpliftyng sayles To flée, and still with slackyng shrowds she more and more preuayles.
Amonge those slaughters, her (for death at hand) wt countenance pale, The firie god hath made be borne with waues, and westerne gale.
But there agaynst with body great, was Nylus mournyng put, His bosom openyng broad, and callyng home their course to cut.
His garment gowne he spred, and wyde his lap of waters blue, And to his lurkyng floods his conquerd men alluryng drew.
But Caesar through the Romain wals thrée times triumphant borne To great Italia gods he payed his vowes eternall sworne.
All stréetes with mirth resounds, with games, wt sports, wt clapping ha~ds In euery temple wiues, at euery altar singyng quéeres, At the altars, euery floore with offryng slaughters strowd of stéeres.
Him self at Phoebus porch (so white as snow) in throne downe set,
Surueys al countreys gifts, and garnisht posts with presents fret.
In long arayes they gon, the conquerd nacions captiue sad, As diuerse of their tongs as in their wéedes and armours clad.
Thre sundry sorts of Moores had Vulcan cast, som tuckt in shyrts, Some trayling mantels loose, or sirpleys windie wyde of skyrts: Of Cara, Lelega, by south, and archers bred in caues Of Gelon sands, Euphrates now did fléete with softer waues.
And Flemings furthest out from men, and Rhyne with hornes in twaine, Vnconquerd Danes, and flood Araxes (bridge that did disdaine).
Such works in Venus gift he wondring saw by Vulcans shéeld, And knowing not the thinges, their figures glad he long behéeld.
At last, his childrens chaunce, and fame he did on shulders wéeld.
Whylst Aeneas is busie in Tuscia to seeke ayde, Turnus is by the Raynbow admonished not to omit so good an occasion, and speadeth him self forth as neare as he can to his enemyes.
Who seing them defensed on euery side in theyr tentes to the intent that he might cut away from them all hope of flight, assaieth to burne their fleete.
But at Venus ernest sute: Iupiter deliuered the shippes from present burning, and transformed them into so many Nymphes of the sea.
Towards night, Turnus layeth a watch before the towne gates for feare of soddein eruptions of the enemie, in which watch Messapus is cheif.
Therwhiles the Troians take counsell whom to sende to Aeneas to make him priuie of these thinges, which Nisus and Euryalus, a payer of faithful freendes take in hand to do.
Who departyng forth of the towne, and findyng the watch ouercome with wyne and sleape: sley Rhamnetes with a numbre of Rutilians, lade them selues with the spoyles.
But in the mornyng, beyng spied of Volscens horsemen: they flie to the woods.
There Eurialus by weight of his armour, and ignorance of the way much hindred, falleth into his foes handes is by Volscens slayne.
Nisus likewise, when he had slayne Volscens, and valiently reuenged Euryalus death beyng strooke through with many a mortal wound falleth downe dead vpon his freends body.
Their heads are caried vpon spea+res poynts into the tentes, where the Troians knowyng them from the walles, a great sorow riseth through the whole towne.
Turnus ceaseth not to assaulte his enemies with all force, and great slaughter is committed on both partes.
There Ascanius killeth with the shoot of an arow Numanus, that ouer proudly aduanced himself: Pandarus and Bitias proude of their good successe, open the gate, and driue backe the enemies entryng in with great slaughter.
Whereof Turnus beyng certefied: issueth into the towne through the open gate, and putteth the Troians to flight, but at length oppressed with multitude, retyreth to the side of the towne which is next the riuer, and armed as he was, leapeth into the streame, and so escapeth.
Dame Iuno downe from heauen the Rainebow red her seruaunt sent To Turnus dredeles prince.
In great Pylumnus vale, his parents woods whom round did close.
To whom dame Rainbow thus, with mouth bespake as red as rose.
Turnus ({quod} she) that thing which neuer god if one had sought Could graunt to thée: lo, tumbling tyme alone it self hath brought.
Aeneas now from home to king Euanders house is gone, And left both campe and mates; and town, and fléete with sauegard none.
The fines extreme of Corytes townes he séekes, nor yet ynough, But Lydas power he drawes, and armour giues to men from plough.
Leaue doubting, take thy time, cal charets out, now set furth stéeds, Breake boldly al delayes, go take that campe that al thing dréeds.
She said, and lifting equal wings to heauen she mounted slowe, And huge in flight she spred, and vnder clouds, cut of her bowe.
The yonge prince her beknew, and holding hands to skies on hie He wondring her pursued, and as she fled he thus did crye.
Rainbow beautie bright of heauen, who through the clouds this tyde, Hath drawn thée thus to ground? se, se, whole heauen deuyde.
se the stragling starrs, that from the poale their course declynes, Such clearbright storme? folow fast al these miraclose signes What euer thou art that me to armour calst, and with that word Went foorth, and from the swelling streame, he water sipt at forde Requiring much his goddes, and aire did lade with vowes outpowrde.
And now the total hoast in fields displaied their pace did hold, Right rich of hors, right rich of broydrid robes, and braue of gold.
Messapus voward helde, the rerward kept yong princes twayne Of Tirrhus, but him self king Turnus midst in battaile mayne, Vauntsquaring spreds his armes, and ouer all by shoulders shynes.
Resembling Ganges flood that ouerflowes seuen streames, and fines In silence burbling broad, or Nylus fresh with waters fat Whan couching close he swells, and seasoneth fields with fléeting flat.
There sodainly a darksom dusky fog most lyke a cloud The Troians might behold, that round with rolles the skies did shroud.
Furst from a banke on hie did Caycus watchman crye aloud.
What is you black, mates? that lyke a bowle such dust vp skralls? Set swiftly furth your tooles, bring weapons out, and clym your wals.
Here is our enmy lo, heylagh, loud clamours than they throw.
The Troyans al about at gates and wals, them close bestowe.
For such commaundment them Aeneas best of martiall skill At his departyng gaue, if any chaunce should rise them yll:
Not rashly ioyne they shuld, nor trusting field their strength extend, But closely kéepe their campe, and saulf their wals with bancks defend.
Though shame therfore with wrath prouoks to fight disdainful déepe, Yet gates to them they set, and due precepts obedient kéepe, And harneyst hye they stand, forstalling foes on rampiers stéepe.
Turnus (as he before the people slow, in post did flye) With twenty chosen knights, on horsback stoute the fortresse nye, Al sodenly vnlooked for is com, whom whyte with speckes Thracian stéede vpheaues, and helmet red gold crested deckes.
Is any here good lads, wil furst with me prouoke our foes? And to the winds a dart he whirling shooke: lo, there it goes Quod he, this fight beginnes, and boystous large on field he flyes, His mates with noyse pursuen, with grisly shouts vplifting cries.
They wondren at the Troyans dastard harts, their corage weake, That neither géeue them dare in open field, nor fearce outbreake In armes as men, but faintlie kéepe their fort, now here, now there He troubous vewes their wals, and ryding séekes ech entring where.
Aye watching lyke some Wolfe, that counterwaiting shipfold cots, Through stormy showres and winds about mens deiries houling trots At midnight séeking stealth, whan careles loud the lambes do bleat In saulfgard nere their dammes, he fretting false and mad for meate Doth absent teare their lims, so gripes his guts that gathring gnawes, Long fasting furth him dryues, and thrist of blood vpdries his iawes.
Euen so to Rutile prince, as serching wals and campe he turnes: His fumes vpsparkling spréeds, and sore in bones his grief him burnes.
What shift inuent he shal to giue thassault, or where find place To breake the Troians trench, or dryue them down to equall space.
Their fléete that secret lay, euen at the syde of Troian wall, Enuironed with trench, whom water floods encompast all He sodenly onsets, and to his mates for fire exclames.
Him self outcasting flings his pynetrée bronds with feruent flames.
Than echman stoutly sturres, the kings own presence men furth pricks.
On euery syde fresh youth for armour takes black burning sticks.
Than blasing cloud with pitch commixt Doth ryse, and smoke from torches mount, to stars with sparks betwixt.
Now Muses tell what god did from the Troyans turne this yre So great: and who then kept their fléete from fumes of fatal fyre? Speake trusting old report, but fame thereof shal neuer expyre.
What tyme Aeneas prince in Ida woods his nauie made
At passing first from Troy, and through deepe seas shuld take his trade: The mother of gods men say, that Berecinthia heauenly hight, Peticion that tyme made to Ioue celestiall great of might Entreating thus by spéech.
Giue son ({quod} she) to thy deare dame, One boone which must aske, since heauens to thée bin brought so tame.
Pynetrée frith had, which many a yere fauoured muche, And in the top a groue there grew of trées, there was none suche For beames of timbre black, and firtrée bourds with pitch and tarre.
Great offrings there tooke, and folks to serue me cam from farre.
Those trées to Troyan prince, whan he so much of ships had néed: gaue with glad good wil, now care my hart doth grype for dréed.
Releas my fear, let now thy parents words thus much obtaine.
Let neuer surge of seas, nor whirlwynd storm their nauy strayne, Nor course of sailing shake, since on my hilles somtime they grewe.
Her son to her than spake, whose wind doth stars and world subdue.
mother what thing meanst? or which way destnies woldst thou presse? Can frames of mortal hands immortal state by right possesse? Or should Aeneas prince in doubtful daungers wandring stray? That certein is of seate? what god so great such maistries may? Nay whan fulfild they haue their fatall course, that ports, and realmes Of Latium lands they touch, what ship somtyme so skapes the streames, Their mortal shape from them wil withdraw, and chaunge them all To maidens bright of seas, lyke water Nimphes with bodies tall.
Lyke Clotho goddesse clere, or Galatee with membres whyte, Who through their foming waues with persaunt brest doth swimming smyte.
He spake, and by the fens of Stigies flood his oth he tooke, By pitch of Lymbo pits, by gulf and banks of Plutos brooke.
He gaue a nod, and at his beck, whole heauen trembling shooke.
The day therfore of couenaunt present was, and destnies dewe Performed had their time, whan Turnus fearce with dredful vewe, Compeld that lady sainct from sacrid ships that fire to dryue.
There furst a sodain light before mens eyes did straunge ariue, And huge from morning skies descending cloud down gliding ran, With quéeres of spritual wights, than dredful voice wyde aire began To fil in Rutiles eares, and troupes of Troians brym to skan.
Do not affright your selfs to saue my ships with labour vayne, You Troyans, nor in armour put your strength, nor take that payne.
For furst shal Turnus waters al consume, and burne vp seas Er he my sacryd trées haue power to touch, go loose at ease, Go saltsea goddesses, your lady biddes, and as it spake: Incontinent ech ship their bands at shore, and halsers brake.
And down (as dolphins don) conuerting sharp their beaking snouts,
In depe sea sands they drown, whence vp furth with they ryse by routes.
maruel monstrous much, in virgin shapes and faces trym On seas them selfes they shooue, and sporting swift in sight they swym.
Lyke Mermaides ladies light, of number iust, and not one more As they before did stand, with brasen stemmes in shippes at shore.
Astonyed Rutils stood, euen he him self in minde affrayde Messapus, and his horses troubled were, the streames eke stayde Their waters hoarce of sound, and Tyber trembling foote retrayd.
But not to Turnus bold did corage ought relent or hope.
Mens harts with words he lifts, chéering chydes with skornes at skope, These monsters to the Troyans come, lo god him self you sée Hath take from them their strength, and wonted shift alwayes to flée, No Rutile powre doth néede, our fiers, our swords, they durst not byde, The seas therfore to Troians fast are stopt, no place to ryde Nor hope to skape they haue: lo, halfe the world beraft them is.
As for the land in our possession lieth, and ouer this So many thousands strong Italian nacions armour beare.
The Troians fatal songs, nor iuggling sights can me not feare, Nor answers from the gods, if any such the wretches boast.
Ynough for Venus is, and destnies past, that once this coast Of rancke Italia land the Troyans poore had leaue to touche.
My fortune them withstands, and lykewyse may destnies vouche To kyl that cursyd brood, and for my spouse vproote them quyte.
Nor not alone this grief doth Agamemnons kindred byte: Nor Greeks haue onely cause for wedlock spoyle them selfs to arme.
Yet had it bin ynough to stroy them ones, if but one harme Suffized had their sinne, and not with spyte all female kinds Thus villaynly disdain? what? doth this half trench puff their mynds? Doth dichwors giue them pryde? so neare the death? such srufgard thin? Saw they not Troyan wals in fiers down sink with gods within? But what is he (good mates) wil yonder trench with me go teare With tooles, and ouerrun this campe, that trembling sinks for feare? néed no Vulcans armes, nor thou sand ships, séeke them not.
Let al Etruria ryse, and ioyne for helpe in Troyan knot.
They shal not feare no darke, by night on them wée list not steale.
We wil betray no watch, nor kéepers kill as Greekes did deale, Nor blynde in horses paunch wil we go lurke, but cléere by day Their walls in compas round withfier, and foarce assaulting fray.
They shall not thinke vs Greekes, nor at our youth haue cause to skof, warrant them, nor such as Hector ten yeres long kept of.
And now therfore since better part of day from vs is fled: Remaynes no more, but sith wée haue our things thus far welsped, Prouyde your self good chéere, and looke for fight to giue dispatche.
There whyles to set the skoute, and euery gate with warde to watche Messapus charged was, and walls to girt with fiers and lights.
Of Rutils seuen and seuen to gard the siege, most actiue knights Elected were by lot, ech one his hundred souldiours led, Carnation creastid youth in burnisht gold gay glittring red.
They stray, they shift their turnes, and al along down layde on gras: With wines them selfs they chéere, and cups vpturne bolles of bras.
Their fiers before them shyne, and long with watch ye night they pas, Auoyding sléepe with mirth.
These things beholding brim did from their walls the Troyans spie.
In armour strong they stood, and som their towres did hold on hie, For drede they grope their gates, and som did bridges clampring ioyne, And bulwark banks they wrought, and engine tooles to fend and foyne Al weaponed, them sir Menesteus and Serestus sharply plies, Whom lord Aeneas had, if any fortune hard should rise: Made maisters ouer youth, and gouernours al things to guide.
Afront the vaumures long by lots to daungers truly tried The legion waiting stood obseruing course, ech kéepes his charge.
One gate did Nisus kéepe most egre knighte with speare and targe, Whom huntresse Ida sent as freende to serue Aeneas part.
bowman stout with shafts, and swift with stroke of whirling dart.
Next him Euryalus his mate, whose fairer was there non Through al Aeneas campe, nor Troyan armour did put on.
Fyne princock fresh of face furst vttring youth by buds vnshorne.
One loue betwéen them was, and iointly fought like brethre~ sworne.
That time also they twaine one standing kept with gate beforne.
Sir Nisus first, what is it? god sets thus mens minds on fire? Swéete fréend? or is ech mans mind his god furth driuen by dern desire?
Some great conflict or famous fact to attempt long whyle my brest Incessaunt me prouokes, nor can content with quiet rest, Thou seest how carelesse nowe these Rutils bin this watche that kéepe, Their lightes disseuered shyne, and they them selues in wynes and sléepe Resolued slurg on grounde, wyde Silence walkes, now fréendly harke What rysing mooues my sprite, and wherupon my thought doth carke.
Aeneas home to call bin Lordes and people firmely set, And men they séeke to sende, that tidynges certayne soone may fet.
If they will giue to thée such benefites as requier, (For vnto me shall fame of so great fact suffice for hier).
By yonder banke thou séest, could a way me thinks finde out To passe to Euanders court, and by the same reuert about.
Euryalus astonid stoode, such loue him prickt of prayse, He coulde him not conteyn, but to his fréende thus feruent sayes.
In thynges of so great weight my felowship dost Nisus grutche? Forsakst thou mee? should send thée alone to daungers suche? Not so my father Opheltes beaten in warres did me conduct Through fearefull Graecia frayes, nor so my minde did euer instruct In tremblyng toyles of Troy, nor with thée such parts haue played Since great Aeneas campe, and destnies me extreme haue stayed.
beare a mynde perdée dispising death, lacke not spright To thinke this prayse well bought, with losse for thée of life and light.
Such thyngs in faith of thée did not dred, Gods forbod so to thinke, no, me almighty Ioue so sped Or who so els of gods indifferent lookes, my head so strike.
But if there should as many thynges thou séest in daungers like, If any sore missehap or chaunce or god should backward shooue,
would thou shouldst remayne, thy yeres to liue don best behooue.
Let one suruiue that me from foes may take, or my dead corse For money may redéeme, and to enterre haue some remorse, Rewardyng me with earth, or if my lucke not so vouchsaue: Giue offrings for my soule, and it set foorth with tombe or graue.
Nor cause will to thy déere mother be of so great grief, Who thée alone (O ladde) pursues good soule of matrones chief, Respecting daungers non, and lest Acestes land so lief.
Excuses vaine, in vayne thou dost but knit, Nor myne affection first doth from my brest ought chaunge or flit.
Let vs be gone ({quod} he) and calles the skoute, they strayt supplied
Thei leuing sta~dings both furth hied In one minde knit like mates, and for their king enquéeryng spied.
All other breathyng soules, on soyles disperst, than easments tooke, Releasing paynes with sléepe, and cares from harts forgetfull shooke.
The dukes of Toians chief, and chosen youth about them bolde: Their counsayle than supreame for kingdoms weight did carkfull holde, What should be don, or to Aeneas now who message beares.
They leane with shields in hands, consultyng sad vpon their speares.
Amids the campe in field than Nysus to them fresh of chere, With mate Euryalus beséekes accesse, to speake them nere, thyng of burthen great and worthy of thancke they haue to breake.

But after his decesse, the Rutils wan by war that praye.
Eurialus them caught, and on his shoulders strong in vayne He fitly them bestowd, and of his spoyle he was right fayne.
Than duke Messapus helme with beauteous crestes adorned pure On head he puts, than campe they leaue and passe their iorney sure.
This whyle from Latin town, one troupe of horsmen sent that way,
(Whyle al the rest in legion armed stood and did but stay) Came furth, and aunswer brought of their estate to Turnus king.
Thre hundred shieldmen al, al vnderneth duke Volscens wing, And towards now the campe they drew, and walls approched nye, Whan from a far these men take left hand course they might espie.
And by the glimsing night Eurialus that swift went on His hie helme him betraied, that brightsom beames reflecting shone, Was not for nought espied.
Duke Volscens cryed amids his troupe, Stand felows, where this way? what be yée so that shrinking stoupe? Wher run you armed thus? they not an answere to them gaue, But swiftly through the woods made hast in trust that night shuld saue.

Nisus went on, and enmies all vnwares had scapid quyte.
And past that place which afterwards Albanus mountaine hight Of Albas name, king Latin there great pastures did maintaine Whan furst he stood and for his absent fréend did looke in vaine.
Eurialus poore lad, what countrei now shall thée séeke? What path shuld pursue? strait back again from créeke to créeke Through that deceitful wood vnwynding wayes perplext he sought, Stil tracking marking steps through thickets silent stragling blynd.
He heres their horse, he heres their rustling noise, and enmies wynd.
Not long betwene there was when to his eares the crye cam hot, and furst Eurialus he séeth whom al mens hands had got, Through fraud of night and place of troublous tumult wareles trapt, Vainstrungling working much, but round about him all they wrapt.
What shuld he do? what strength? how could he shift or dare dispose To rescue thus this lad? should he run rashly midds his foes? Enfoarcing faire to death with comely wounds his lyfe to lose? He swiftly shooke his dart, and hie beholding bright the Moone: He whirling bent his arme, and thus he feruent made his boone, Thou goddesse, thou this time, thou in our labours lende reliefe, Thou beauteous Quéene of starrs in forests virgin keper chiefe.

Duke Volscens storming frets, nor him that did that weapon fling: He one where could behold, nor whither feruent mad to spring.
But thou this whyle ({quod} he) these two mens death shalt surely rue, If any hoat blood in thy hart there be.
Than verely in dede dismaide Did Nisus loudly shryke, nor more to lurcke in darknes staide, Such torments than him toke, he cried amain with voice affaied.
Tis I, tis I, here, here am that did, turne all at me, Rutils with your tooles, my onely craft here it is, not he, He nether durst nor could, this heauen, these stars, witnes take.
Onely for to much loue his wretched fréend he nold forsake.
Such words he gaue, but déepe with dynt the sword enforced furst Had ransakt through his ribs and swéete white brest at once had hurst.
Down falls Eurialus in death, his limmes, his fair fine fleshe
Al runs on blood, his neck down fainting nods on shulders neshe, Wel like the purple floure that cut with plough letfalling loppes In languish withring dies, or like weake necks of poppis crops Down peifing heauy heads, whan rain doth lading gréeue their tops.
But Nisus to his enmies fearcely ran, and through their mids, Duke Volscens out he sekes, he onely Volscens battaile bids.

Yet nerethelesse his sword like lightning bright with both his hands

Nor waylyng lesse there was, whan Ramnes kyng was headlesse found, So many Lords at once through al the campe so strowd on ground, With Neuma, with Serranus huge concourse and preasing strong About their bodies came, some yet haulf panting stretcht along.

Besides all this (a piteous grisly sight) on speares they stick
The heads of these two knights, and loud with cries they them pursue,
The paynefull Troians tough did on their left hand walles within Resistyng set their front, for flood their righthand compast in.
Their trenches hie they holde, and lofty towres defendyng kéepe, All pensiue standyng sad, and heads on poales before them péepe
To well poore wretches known wt filthy bloud down droppyng déepe.

But Heauen wt moane she filles, thus through people wailyng spréedes And is it thus, Euryalus, that thy face beholde, Myne ages late relief myne onely ioye, my comfort olde? And couldst forsake me thus thou cruell hart to leaue me alone? Nor entryng daungers such might thy mother caytiue crone, Optayne thy talkyng last, and make on thée my latter stoundes? Alas, in land vnknowen, alas, to féede Italian houndes, To foules a pray thou lieft, welaway for euermore.
Nor wretched mother I, thy funerals brought out before, Nor could come close thine eyes, nor wounds with waters washing bath With clothyng coueryng soft, which both nights dayes to rath Did ordayne gay for thee, and hourely hastyng did prepare, In webbing wastyng time to ease thereby myne aged care.

But brighthras troupe from far, his fearfull shiuring sounds expels, Thicke, thick, and therevpon men shout, that hie heauen yalping yels.

No more with such deceit they care to coape in conflict blinde, Strongharted Rutils bold, but from the trenche they seke to driue With darts and hurling tooles.

Pryuernum Capis kilde, him furth before Themillas speace, Had pinched small with prick, he like a dolt kest of his targe, And handlyng groapt his grief, an arrow therfore swift with charge His left side wyng cam by, and to his ribbes his pawe made fast, That loongs, and breathing pypes, that mortal stroke with brusing brast: There stoode in armour fine, the worthy son of Arceus duke, Gay néedle wrought in cloke, embroyded brown in Spaniards puke: Much noble, fayre in face, his father him to warfare sent, Syr Arceus bred in woods, and by the floods of Simeth banks, Where stands Palycus church, and altars gracious rendryng thanks.

Him cracking thus, and iangling more dispyte with odious songs: Ascanius could not beare, but sinnowy bow of horse hyde thongs He bent, with pointed shaft, and armes disbukling seuerall wayes.
Before hie Ioue he stands, and humbly thus with vowes he prayes.
Almighty Ioue giue to my bold beginnings good successe, Vnto thy temple shal solempne gifts of offrings dresse, yong stéere white as snow, with guilded front of liuely lust, Hyeheaded lyke his dame, and with his horne desyres to iust, Already strong which with his féete vpsparpling spredes the dust.

Go go mens manly dedes with mocks disdaine, Twyse captiues Troians lo, these answeres Rutils send againe.
Ascanius spake but thus, the Troyans than with ioyful voyce, Al ioyntly gaue their shouts, and lifting minds to starrs reioyce.
That time as fortune was brightheaded Phoebus for disport Beheld from ayry coast bothe Latines hoasts, and Troyan fort, As hie on cloude he sat, and thus to Ascanius gaue report.
Thats thats my péereles lad, such vertues new leads lords to stars, Begotten of gods, and gods engender shalt, by right al wars Must vnder Dardanes line, in time by destny quite down synke, Nor Troy can thée containe, and with that worder one could wynke, Him self from skie down skips, and breathing puffs remoues from ayre Than to Ascanius he drawes, and chaunged countenaunce fayre,
Was henchman bearing armes, and kept his garde of trust vnfilde, The old man him to Ascanius than had put, so Phoebus went, All things like aged man, both voyce, and hew he did present, Whyte heary locks and angrisounding armour, calme of brest.
And to Ascanius thus that feruent was his words he drest.
Let it suffice thée now that Numan fréely vanquisht is Good child: lo now Apollo great commends thy prayse for this.
He geues thée chief renown, nor lyke with tooles to match doth passe.
Abstaine, hencefurth from blowes my boy, so Phoebus entring was: And in the mids his tale, men mortals eyes he cleane forsooke, Desserring thinne from sight, and flittring fourme to skies betooke.
The lords beknew that god, perceiuing strayte his tooles deuyne,
His arrow sheues they heard, and ratling noyse of boltbag fine.
At Phoebus worde therefore, and in respect of his great grace: Ascanius back they kept that egre was, them selfs in place Succeds, and ventring liues eftsones to daungers turne their face.
They strike, they bende their bowes, they whirle fro~ strings sharpe shooting showres: Al stréetes with tooles ar strowd, than helmets sculs with battrings mard, And shields dishiuring crack, vpryseth roughnes bickring hard, Loke how the tempest storm, whan winds outwrastling blowes at south, Raine ratling geats the grounde, or clouds of haile from winter mouth Down dashing headlong driues, whan god from skies with grisly steuen, His watry showres outwrings, and whirlewind clouds down breakes from heauen.

Them selfes before their towres, both right, and left hand braue out stept Al armed stif in stéele, and bright with crests their standings kept, Hyheaded like two trées, like two great Okes by Padus banks, Besides their ioyful flood, aboue their mates they ryse by rancks.
Their heads to heauen they lift with lofty tòppes vnshorne they beck, Beshadowyng broad the bows, and hie surstretching skies they check.
The Rutils in thei breake whan furst they saw their entrie frée. Immediatly the Dukes in armour gorgious gay to sée, Syr Quercens, and Equicolus either beaten turne their backs: Or they with all their bands euen in the gate went dead to wracks.
Than more more mens minds disordring chafe co~tempning doubts And thither Troians now round gathryng draw, by plumpes routs, Conflicting hand to hand, and further salyeng dare runne outs.
To captain Turnus fierce, than troublyng folks on backfort side post with message runs, how Troians now haue caught new pride, Great murther stoutly made, and how their gates breade ope they set.
He leaues his works begun, and huge with wrath to giue the onset, To that presumptuous gate, and brethren proude, he rushyng runnes.
The chief by Theban dame, for he against him furst did shoue: He threwe down dead with dart, the Italian tronke in skies aboue Disseuering, tender aire, cam through his brest and out at back, His stomack round it rent, the wound from caue giues out blood black Permixt with some, and fixt in loongs the steele warmewaxing stack.
Than Bitias that boystous sturd with eies of sparckling hew, Not with no dart, for dint of dart, could lyfe not make him yeld.
But thrown with strength extreme a troncheo~ speare most stro~g to weld, Big like a lightning bolt at him he draue, whom doubled folde Could neither backs of bulls, nor brest plate faithfull strong of golde Susteine from mortal plague, his membres huge down foltring flusht, The ground at falling grones, and thondring huge his shield he crusht.
As by the Bayon shore men building hauens done for the nones
With laboring lo~g beforn, through engins meanes lay mo~strous stones.
Down sinks the weldlesse weight, and on the ground it setled stands.
Thy wyld seas méeting mixe, and darkning skies vpleapes the sands, Than with the sounds the soyles adioynant shake, and mountains next, Where whelmd by gods reuenge in dongeons déepe are giants vext.
Their army puissant Mars both pricks, and foarce to Latins harts Did adde, and stings of egre wrath, in ech mans brest vpstarts.
He made the Troians flée, and gaue them blackday mixt with dréede, From euery syde they flocke since now the sight procéedes in dede, And in their mynds the murthering angel sits.
Whan Pandarus his brother saw down falne before his eyes, In what case fortune stands, and how things now in daunger lyes: The gate with much turmoyle conuerting hinges hookes on rings, With shoulders shouing broad at last he shuts, and bolts vpwrings, And many his mates in hard conflict he leaues, and out them lockt.
But other he receyues as with the preas they rusiling shockt Vnprudent man, that whan the Rutil kinge did through intrude: Coulde him not entring spie, but in the fort did him include, Euen lyke a Tyger wylde among the flocks of cattailes rude.
Incontinent new light their eyes distraynes, and armour straunge Did grisly giue theyr sound, his quyuering crest with bloodread raunge Like beams of lightning burnes, and from his shield that flames outflew.
Anon theyr hateful face, and monstrous lyms the Troyans knew, Distraught with sodein sight.
Ince~st with feruent wrath: Thou shalt haue here but bad refuge.
This is no ioynter towne, king Latyns wife gets here no gage, Nor she ({quod} he) thy fathers walls this time empoundes in cage.
Thyne enmies for thou séest, hence neuermore shal Turnus out.
To him than Turnus spake, al smyling sober fre from doubt.
Begin (if any manfull minde thou hast) approche me rounde.
Ish make thée Priam tell that here thou hast Achilles founde.
The wynds vpcaught that stroke, and Iuno Quéene the daunger brake, Wrong wresting as it went, and in the gate did stick the stake.
But not this toole, of myne which in my right hand here shake, Shalt thou escape, great difference now shal our two puissans make (Quod he,) and stretching broad with armes his sword did mounting lift: His brainpan through it smote, and in the mids it made a cliff, Deuiding chekes, and chaps, and heares vpgrown with gapyng wou~de.
The soyle than shuddring shooke, and with the weight did yeld a sounde.
Down lyueles falls his lyms, and armour mixt with blood and brayne With corps he strowd the ground, and equal clyuen in porcio~s twaine, His head on shulders hung, one here, one there disseuered slaine.
The Troyans than for fear theyr féete gan take with trembling flight.
And if he victor than remembred had, and tane foresight, Straite wayes to breake the bolts, and through the gates his folks let in: That day to Troyan war, and to their lynage last had bin.
But furious feruent mynde, and gréedie lust of slaughters more Enforst hym for warde still.
Furst Phalarim and maister veines of Giges huge he sheares.
And as the people fled he gathering darts, and skattred speares Bestowed them in their backs, for Iuno gaue both might and mynde.
Than Halim felow vnto them he ioynes, and kylls behynde Syr Phegius with targat pyke down pusht, than vp the wall He runns, and such as fighting there, of this knew nought at all Neomonus, and Prytanis, with Hellus he downe stewe.
Alcander than and Lynceus which toward him stout drewe, Outmustring mates for helpe, he leaping trench did swift preuent, And with his glittring glayue he such a stroke vnwares him lent: As hand to hand he fought, that quite from shoulders at one choppe His head with helmet fell, and far from him did hobbling hoppe.
From thence sir Amycus he slits that wilde beasts euer stroyed, More lucky non there was, nor neuer man more oft them noyed, With oyntments armyng stéele, wt poysoned tooles he still them cloyd.
Than Clytius, and the dulcet freend of Muses Cretea fine.
Syr Cretea Muses mate that euermore with voyce deuine Melodious warblid songs, his pastime chief was harpe and kit, By numbryng ran his Rimes to synowy cords concurrant fit: Alwayes of stéedes, of armes, of men, he sang of battails mayne.
At last the leaders great, whan they first heard their men so slayne: The Troyan captaynes came, sir Mnesteus and Serestus strong, They saw their straglyng mates, and enmy entred thicks among.
And Mnesteus, what auayles this flight? where run you now ({quod} he?) What better bulwark walles? what other townes or trench haue ye? One man alone (O sirs) euen in your mids inclosd in campe, So many slaughters made? in such a fort round skotfrée rampe? So many chieftain knights vnuenged sends to Lymbo dampe? Make ye no more of countrey soyle remorse? faintharted fy? What shall wée shame our gods? and great Aeneas nought set by? With such rebukes mens mindes vpkindled staied, thick with preas They stoode.
But small and small from flight did Turnus than surceas, Retiryng to that side where flood the fortresse gyrdes aboute.
So much the more pursute the Troyans make with restles shoute, And clustryng close they shooue.
As when sometime men gathring thicke Lyon wylde assaylne, and hard with tooles oppressyng pricke.
But he affraied resists, sowerskowling grim he backward strides, And neither taile to turne his pride him lets, nor wrath his sides Will suffryng make him shew, nor forward can set furth his ioynts, Though fain he would, not able he is yet for men, for weapons poynts.
None otherwise did Turnus than retracting séeke bypath, With stalking doubtfull steps, and déepe in minde reboyles his wrath.
Yet notwithstandyng twise his enemies mids he did inuade, And twyse conuertyng backs them take their walles in flight he made.
But thuniuersall campe together ioyning whole did rise, Nor Iuno Quéene durst more against such strength so great suffice.
For Ioue vnto his sister down her ayry Raynbow sent With message nothyng milde, and how that some should soone repent If Turnus from the Troians loftie walles did not reyéelde, The yong prince now therfore, with neither right hand yet, nor shield
Enduring can resist, so thick thrown tooles on ech side prest About his temples rounde big bounsing beats, nor neuer at rest His helmet tincgling tings, and stones with bumpes his plates disglosse, His topright crest from crown downe battred falles, nor brasen bosse Sufficient is for strokes so doubledriuing they not stint.
The Troyans al with speares, eke he him self with lightning dint Syr Mnesteus forward shoues, than euery lim on streaming swet Doth drop down black as pitch, nor giues him time his breth to fet.
Faint panting puls his ioynts, and tierd with pains his entrails beat.
Than with a leape at last to Tyber flood in all that heat He headlong kest him self, in complet armour compast all, He smooth with chanell blew did softly him receyue from fall, And to his mates him glad (from slaughters washt) home sent withall.
Iupiter callyng a parliament of Gods: exhorteth them to concorde, Venus complayneth of the Troians danger, and Iunos vnsaciable malice, and requireth at length some end of calamities.
Iuno layeth all the blame in the Troians, as ye first causers of war, in Venus her self.
When Iupiter perceaued they would grow to no agreement, to offend neither his wife nor his daughter: promiseth to take part with nether, but will put of all to the indifferencie of destenies.
This while the Rutilians returne to thassault with all their force, whom the assaulted repel with all their might, this in Latium.
Aeneas hauyng braught al things in Etruria to wisshed end, beyng assisted by diuers peoples: returneth to his mates with a nauie of thirtie sayle.
There he meeteth with the Nimphes that were not longe before transformed from shippes, and is by them certefied both of the losse of his fleet, and of the daunger of his men.
Then he landeth his power within the sight of his enemies.
The Rutilians leaue the sledge, and run to shoare to keepe the enemie from landyng.
Where Pallas, after many slaughters on his enemies: is at length slayne by Turnus.
With sorow wherof, Aeneas all enraged: maketh plenty bloudoffryngs on his foes for his freendes soule.
Then Ascanius issueth forth, and ioyneth power with his father.
Iuno carefull for Turnus, casteth before his eyes a false representation of Aeneas.
Which, whilst he pursueth into a ship: Iuno breaketh the cables, and by force of a tempest, bringeth him to the shore neare Ardea.
Mezentius then, at Iupiters commau~dment, entreth the battle, and sleyth many both Troians and Etruscans, vntil Aeneas haue wou~ded him, and being rescued by Lausus his sunne: is scarce able to departe the field Lausus is also sleyne by Aeneas whylst he endeuoreth to reuenge his fathers wounde.
Which when Mezentius vnderstoode: he returneth into the battle, and is sleyne by the same hand that his sunne was.
BRoad open in this while of glorious god thalmighty hall, The father of gods, king of men him self doth councel cal Into the starbright seat, whens kingdoms large in seas and landes He lofti low beholds, both Troians fort, and Latins bands.
In parliment house they sat twigated wyde: him self begins.
Celestials great, how happens now so soone your sentence twins
Reuolting iudgement fixt: why shew ye thus with minds vnméete, Ioues forefended warres should Latins now to Troyan fléete? What discord now contrarious maks you fearce? what wroth, what feare Sets these, or those on gog not suffring rest to shield nor speare? time to fight there comes, cal not to fast for fatal houres.
Who wylde Carthago proud in tract of yeres to Romishe towres
Destruction great shal send, and mountain tops down tearing breake.
Than spare not your dispites, than rap and reaue who list and wreake.
Now let them rest, and quiet league compound your selues to smight.
Thus Ioue in brief, but not in brief than golden Venus bright
For what thing els haue we to whom for helpe now crye we can? You se how Rutils rampe and with what brauery bolne in pride King Turnus prosperous rydes, scant in their wals can Troyans byde, But euen amids their gates, euen on their bulworks rampier brims: They bickring dayly dye, that trench and dich with bloodshead swims.
Aeneas absent knowes not this, will you geue neuer leaue To rest poore soules from siege, must enmies euer stil downe reaue The walles of springing Troy? and yet more still with straungers hoasts Poore Troyans troubled bin, yet ones agayn from Greekish coasts Must Diomedes ryse? wene my flesh must yet be cut, And me your heauenly chyld man mortall shal to daungers put.
But if contrarye to the pleasure of your heauenly grace, In Italy ben Troyans entred wrong, vsurping place: Than let them buy theyr sinnes, nor ayde them not, but if they haue But folowed your precepts, which gods and spright such mumbers gaue: Why now should any creature dare controle or hang down groyne To bend back your decrées, or destnies now presume to royne? What should now reherce our nauy brent at Scicil shore? Or name the king of stormes with all his tempest wynde vprore Against vs whole vpraisde, and Raynbow clouds so oft down strainde? And now the fends forsoth for that one quarter yet remainde Vnsought besydes the world, yet sodenly lo thence to skies Alecto reare she did, and made by madnesse towns vpryse.
Supremyty, nor for their empier moues me not such things, Wée looked long in vayn whyle fortune was, but this not wrings.
Make victours whom you fauour most, our hope so hie not springs.
If no one corner be that your spouse can vouchsafe to giue To Troyans poore for spite, nor countrey none, nor place to liue: Yet by the piteous fall of smoking Troy from soyle destroyed, Good father beséeke let me Ascanius kéepe vncloyed: Let me my nephew small withdraw from Mars, as for my son Aeneas, he shall tosse in seas vnknown as earst hath don.
And what way fortune leades, where euer it be, let him go proue, Yet let me saue his childe and him from batails hard remoue.
In Cypres land some cities faire haue, haue Cythere, Idalium, Paphos hie, and Amathus, let him dwell there, Vnfamous frée from wars, and honourlesse lead out his age, Than may your grace condempne al Italy to great Carthage In slauedome vnder Moores, no hindraunce than to Affrick towres Can com, large empier rule they may no Troyans nere their bowres.
What hath our seruice now preuaild, what goodnes haue we got By skaping Greekish fiers, and mortall plagues of Mars so hot? So many parlous lands, such wast wyde seas with paines outworne, Whyle Troians Latium séeke, to reise the walles so oft down torne? Had it not better ben, if in their countreys reking dust, On soyl where Troy did stand they setled had, than thus to trust? Yet giue them wretches leaue to turne their backs, and home retier Vnto their natiue streames, lorde be so good at my desier.
Reuert their former toyles, all miseries that earst haue béene
Enforst with furious rage vprose: why dost thou me constraine, Déepe silence now to breake, and to disclose my chouched paine? Did either god or man Aeneas thyne to warre compell? King Latin to impugne, or yet his subiects cause rebell? Italia land he tooke by destnyes worde: admit so were Through mad Cassandras sprite, yet did wée euer tyce him there To leaue his campe vnkept? and to the wynds his lyfe commit? To giue his childe the charge of walles, and wars did wée giue writ? Or make him nacions moue in rest that sate, or faithes remit? What god did such deceit? where was that time that power of ours? So fore or where was Iuno than, or bowe down sent with shoures? Is it so vyle a thing that springing Troy besieged standes With fier? and that king Turnus séeks to saue his countrey landes? Of king Pilumnus blood Venilia Nimph that had to dame?
What is for Troian théeues, al Itali with bronds to flame, Subdue their neighbours lands, and robbrie boties riue by snaps, Compel men giue them wyues, and spouses reaue from parents laps, Entreat for peace by becks, and traitors arme their ships for traps? Thou couldst Aeneas thyne from hands of Greeks somtime withdraw.
Suppliedst his place with cloude, with empty winde of wauering flaw.
Thou couldst conuert their fléete to seuerall ships with stormes renewd.
If wee help Rutils ought, lo what a sinne, what broile is brewed? Aeneas absent knowes not this? nor maye he absent knowe.
Thou hast Cithera townes, hie Paphos, and Idalium lowe, Why troublous sturrest thou thus me~s angry moodes, why dost procure New warres to Latium town that trauayls old could scant endure? Ist we that will vpturne the flittring state of Troy from soyle? Came it by vs, or first by him, that Greeks made Troy a spoyle? Who first began that cause, why rose in armour fixt on wreke Europa and Asia both? who did their leage by theuedom breke? Was it by my conduct, thaduoutrer stale the Sparta Quéene? Gaue them tooles to trie, or louers wars mainteind with spléene? Then oughst haue ben affraid for thine, now causles dost but square In vain, and flimflam flirts out throwst at them that nothing care.
Such talkings Iuno gaue, and heauenly wights with murmor round All sondry cried assents, as first whan blasts begin to sound, With puffs they wag the woods, and tombling blind with soft vprore They nere pronostike winds, and tels the seaman stormes before.
Thalmighty father than that all thing rules in totall some, Bespake, and at his spéech, the court of high gods staggred domme, And from the grounds the soyle contrembling shook, than lofty ayre, Than winds layd down their noyse, and calme sea surges setled faire.
Take this therfore in minde, and in your brests imprint my saws, Since Rutils with the Troyans will not knit nor take no laws: And forasmuch we se your quarel striuings make non ends: Loke how mens fortune stands, this day what hope ech one pretends, Be it Troyan or Italian he, no difference finde they shall, Our iudgement right shal stand, this is our sentence once for all.
If fatall fortune be that Troyan campe besieged is, Or Troyans by deceit Italia lands haue taken amis: Nor Rutils we discharge, ech mans owne medlings euen or od

They stil among them selues, in hashards hard of wars did striue.
Distrest Aeneas than with ships at midnight streames did cliue.
For from Euander first whan to Etruria campe he came: He met their king, and to their king declared his blood, and name,
What help he séeks, what help also he brings, what peoples mights Mezentius gathering drawes, of Turnus brest the spitefull sprights He shewes, and wherevpon mans wit in such case may conclude He giues aduise, with mixt entreating words, al which thinge vewde:

These onely wordes he saied, and in this while the gray day light Returning ripe appéerd, and darknes far did chase of night.
First to his mates he bids, that they their standars shal pursue, With armour match their mindes, and wayte for fight in order due.
And now in sight his Troian campe he hath, and vewes their field,
Aduauncing stout on puppe, in lifthand than his glistring shield Vplifting large he shewes, the Troians gaue to starres a crie, Vpmounting on their walles, hope kindlith wrath with comfort nie:
Their weapons vp they throw, as in the clouds done herds of craws
With crockling casting signes, when lo~g in are they lau~ch like lanes, When southwind first thei flée, and glad wt sounds their ioy proclames.
But these to Rutil king, and Latin lords great meruels were, Till toward shore they loke, than fléetes arriuing bustling there They saw, and vnder ships the seas al couered shew no where.

But not from Turnus bold did corage ought or hope remoue To send them loof from land, or from the shore with force to shoue.
He cheres their sprits which speech, and of him self to his men doth crie.

But when the calmed sea to swell by force of tyde appeares: He quickly wendes his shippe, and to his mates request doth make.

For whilst on sands it smits, and striks on banks of beach and stone, Vncerten on which syde to fall, and surges sore it beates: It splittes in twaine, and men in midst of waues, and water wéetes.
Whom broken oares, batches, and fléetinge stiues of boord, and beame, Do staye, and ebbe pulles backe their féete againe into the streame.
Ne Turnus sluggish slouth doth stay, but fierce with spéede he bends Gainst Troyans all his power, and on the shoare against them tends.
Aeneas first the rusticke sort sets on For happy hansils sake, and Latynes layes the ground vppon.
Where Thereon tooke his bane, the mightiest man in all the field
And through his golden plated Iacke he thrust into the syde.
Then Lycas next, from mothers wombe cut foorth wherof she died,
Sacred, Phoebe to thée, who might in youth haue shund before Warres doubtfull haps.
And Cisseus hard, not pausinge enymore, With cruell Gias, who with clubbs the rancks to ground did beare: He sent to death.
Nought Hercles armes which they in fight did weare, Nought might their valient hands, ne sier helpe that Melampus, was Alcides mate, whilst he on earth his traueiles great did passe.
To Pharon loe, with boastinge talke who doth him self aduance: Into his gapinge mouth his hugie dart he threwe by chance.
And thou lykwyse, with yellowish tendre downe on chéekes in pryme While Chtius dost pursue, Cydon, in an vnhapie time: By Troian hand yslaine, quite carlesse of thy wented loue To boies styll borne, poore wretch the force of wofull death shuldst proue, Had not a troope of brothers rescued thée, sir Phorcus séede, Who seuen were in tale, and seuen dartes they cast indéede, Wherof some from his shyeld, some from his helmet backe do flye In vayne, and Venus noble dame directeth some awrye As they were throwne.
Reach me my dartes (for none in vayne with righthand he did shake
Against the Rutils which sumtime in Greetian bodies ran In Troyan fields, a mightie speare he ketcheth quicklie than, And throwes it foorth, which flying strikes of Moeons shield the brasse,
And percinge through, with breast plate stronge into his breast doth passe.
To whome Alcanor steppes, and brother his from fallinge stayes With his righthand, through whose arme streight ye speare flies foorth his And all with blood imbrued his course he képes yet still amayne, wayes, The arme from shoulder hanges, stayed vp by synewes one or twayne.
Then Numitor from out his brothers corps doth pull the dart, But lefull tys not sure like wound on him agayne t'impart.
Then Lausus stout of limme, and trusting speares him thither hies, Where Driopis with sturdy lance full sore he strykes from farre: Right vnderneath the chynne, the bloody wound his throate doth marre, And with one blowe, of language both and life hym réues, but he With forhead beats the ground, and black blood spues that all may sée.
And thrée likewise in Thracy borne in farthest northern coast, Thrée also who of Idas sier, and Ismara soyle might boast: By dyuerse meanes he throwes to grouud.
Halesus in that space Comes on into Aruncas hands, and of Neptunus race Sprongefoorth Messapus braue with stéeds, now these, now they do striue In very brinke of Latine land ech other thence to driue.
Lyke as contrary wynds amid the aier that roue about Do fight amonge them selues, with equall force, and courage stout, Not one vnto the other, not cloudes, nor seas do yeld a whyt, The battell doubtfull hangs, ech thinge aduerse so close doth syt.
None otherwise the Troian bands, and Latin ranks they ran Togither, settinge foote to foote, and stickinge man to man.
On thother syde, where as the streame of peablestones great steare Togither rouled had, and throune downe trées vppon the shoare:
Th' Archadian band whose wont was not on foote theyr force to trye,
When Pallas sawe to Latines turne theyr backs, and fast to flye, Whome sharpnes of the place had forst from horses to alight, The last, and only shift which serues for men in such a plight: With prayers oft, and oft with taunts prouokes them vnto fight.
whyther flie ye mates? now by your selues, and deeds of might, And by your prince Euanders name, and battels wonne or this, And by my hope which match vnto your countrye prayses is, Trust not vnto your féete, through mydst of foes a way we must Breake forth, wheras the thickest rout of foes vppon vs thrust.
This way both ye, and Pallas duke, your natiue soyle requests.
No gods agaynst vs fight, tis mortall foe that vs molests Mortall lyke vs, as many soules, and hands we haue as thay.
Behold, we are beset by mighty sea that stoppes our way, By land we can not flye, shall we to Troy by sea agayne? This sayd: into the thickst of all his foes he thrusts amayne.
And first by cruell destnies thither braught he méeteth streight
whome whilst he pulles at a stone of hugy weight:
With bended weapon sticks, in myddle space the rybbes betwéene As backbone wold permit, and foorth he pulles the speare agéene Fast stickinge in the bones, on whom fir Hisbon falles not iust Though so he hopd, for whylst in furious rage to ground he rusht Vnwares of fellowes chance: with cruell death him Pallas flewe, And soone his mighty sword quyte through his wellinge lungs he drut.
At Helene next he goes, of Rhoetes eke auncient stocke offpred Anchemolus, that durst with incest file his stepdames bed.
And you likewise Twynnes, your fall in Rutil fields you tooke Of Daucia impes, Larid, and Tymber, who most lyke did looke, And scarse could be discernd, to parents a most swéete deceat.
But Pallas now vnto you both hath diffrence gyuen great.
For why Tymber, thy head of, Euanders swoord did stréeke,
And fingers half a liue do mooue, and weapons downe let fall.
Th' Arcadians thus hartned on, and viewing therwithall His valient déedes: both gréefe, and shame do them to battell call.
Then Pallas soone sir Rhoeteus, which in charret fled him bie Throughgirdes, and tarience like he giues to Ilus or he die.
For he at Ilus did from farre direct a mightie dart, On Rhoeteus which, (betwéene that came) did light, and strake his hart.
Whiles Teuthra thée, and brother Tyren thine he flies, who réeles Downe from his charret, beating Rutil ground with both his héeles.
And like as wisshedly, when winds in sommer season blowe, The shéepheard doth his fiers, in diuers partes of woods bestow, Who quickly taking hold, togither iointly runne apace Through largest fieldes, sir Vulcans power doth take his cruel race.
He like a conquerour sits, and lustie fiers doth looke vpon: None otherwyse their fellowes force togither méets in one, Which Pallas, thée delights.
And stout Halesus fierce in field Sticks such as do withstand, and close defends him self with shyeld.
He Ladon sleyes, and Pheretus, and Domodocus quite, Strimonius righthand eke he soone strikes of, with sword ful bright Raught to his throate, and Thoas face he batters with a stone, And goary bloudie braynes together dasshes with the bone.
The father tellyng things to come: in woods Halesus hid.
But when to auntient sier, colde death his hoary eyes vndid:
The destnies hands layd on his twine, and him bequeathed thay
Graunt, father Tyber to this Dart, which here in hand rest, Goodfortune, and a redie way into Halesus breast.
This armour, and the spoyles of this the man thine Oke shall haue.
But Lausus, at so worthy mans death suffreth nere adéele His rankes to feare, him self the greatest part of war, and right Agaynst him Abas sleyes, the force, and stay of all the fight.
Downe falles th' Arcadian broode to grounde, Hetruscan youth is slayne, And you Troians of the Greekes vnhurt, there take your bayne.
The rankes togither runne, with captaynes match, and equall might, The rerwards fast approch, so that the thronge in midst of fight
There Lausus, youthes, that very much of semblant age appeare, Of passyng beuty both, to whom fell fortune had denide Their countries more to see, and Ioue that all the worlde doth guide Would not consent that they together méete their force to trie.
But vnto ech their chaunce remaynes throught greater foe to die.
To rescue Lausus, he through mydst of routs flies swift as wynd.
When he beheld his mates: leaue of from fight, he sayes, anone, My self will Pallas match, for Pallas vnto me alone Belongs: whose father present here wish he were to view.
This says: his mates thus chargd, wt spéed themselues from field wtdrew At Rutils quicke departure thence, and charge so full of pride, The youth much marueyling, stoond at Turnus stands, eyes doth glide His mightie corps vpon, and sharply ech thing he doth beholde And thus replies vnto the kyng with woords, and courage bold.
Ether for princely spoyles, will prayse deserue, well wooune in fight: Or for a noble death, my sier estéemes of both aright.
Thus sayd: he foorth procée des amidst the playne, chilly colde th' Archadians harts do feele through euery vayne.
From charret Turnus leapes, and foorth on foote he drawes him nie.
Like as a Lyon fierce, when on a mount he stands on hie, And spies from far in fields a bull prepare him selfe to fight: He thither hies, such was the looke of Turnus commyng, right.
Whom when he thinkes within the reach of his darts cast to bée: Then Pallas first drew neare, good fortunes ayde at néede to sée, Although in strength not match, and thus to loftie skies he sed.
By harbour of my fathers, and to thée stranger tables spred Alcides, thée pray, good fortune to my purpose giue, Halfe dead that he may sée me of his armour him beriue, And Turnus or he die beholde me stoutely win the féeld.
Alcides heard the youth, and from his hart within doth yéeld woful gréeuous grone, and frust rate teares lets fall amayne.
Then Ioue with fréendly words his soonne recompforts thus againe.
Ech mans day stands prefixt, time short, and swift with curelesie bretch· Is lotted all man kynd, but by theyr déeds their fame to stretch: That priueledge vertue gyues.
Vnder the loftye walles of Troy Full many soonnes of gods were sleyne, yea Sarpedons anoy, My childes was there ywrought.
Turnus likewise his desinies call, And to his sixed terme of graunted lyfe runne forth he shall.
This much he said, and straight his eyes to Rutil fields downe bends.
And Pallas then with mightye force an hugie speare forth sends, And glittrings sturdie sword from hollowe scabbard out doth pull, That flies, and where the armour on his shoulders rises, full It lights, and passinge forth alonge on brym of bucklar bright: At length it doth on part of Turnus hugie body light.
Then Turnus, aiminge longe in hand a dart of sturdy oke Wel typt with steele, at Pallas forth it flunge, and thus he spoke, Loe, sée if that our dart be sharper then thy weapon was.
He sayd: and through so many linings forgd of iron, and brasse, And through so many folds of hydes of bulles there laid about, The whirlinge head through shield at one blowe beats a passadge out.
And gorgets force throughgirds, and glides into his mighty brest.
In vaine the warmed weapon he from the wound doth quickly wrest, For by the self same way both blood, and soule their passedge take.
He falles vpon the wound, and armour fallinge noyse doth make,
On whom thus Turnus sitting, sayes: Ye Archades (quod he) these words sée faythfully ye tell Euander to, send his sunne as he deserueth well.
What honour of the graue, what comfort is in buriall most: graunt, no litle price Aeneas harbour him shall cost.
He sayd, and then anon his lift foote to the corps he reight Starke dead, and quickly pulles away his belt of hugie weight,
troype of youthes were sleyne, and beds embrued with blouddy spight.
This booty Turnus vaunts him of, and ioyes he doth it hold.
Vnskilfull is mans minde of chance to come, and future fate, And knowes no meane to kéepe, once raysd a loft in happy state.
To Turnus time shall come, when he shall wish he dearly bought That Pallas were vntoucht, these spoyles, and very day in thought Shall hate.
His mates with wofull dole, and bitter teares him lay Vppon a shield, and Pallas thence they carie thicke away.
gréefe, and honour great that to the father will remayne.
This day thée first braught to the warres, this tooke thée thence again.
Yet dost thou leaue behinde thée hugie heapes of Rutils slayne.
By this time had no vayne report herof, but trusty poast In hast vnto Aeneas told, in what distresse his hoast Did stand, that time it was his vanquishst Troians for to ayd.
Cut with his sword amid the ranks, thée Turnus proude to finde For slaughter new, Pallas, Euander eke he beares in minde, And still in sight they stand, and tables which in gestred wise He first approcht, and righthands giuen.
And strait he there espies Foure valient youthes at Sulmo borne, and foure which vfens bred, Whom thence he hales aliue, and offers vp vnto the dead, And burning bonefier flambes he all bedewes with captiue blood.
At Mago next, when as a speare he threw a far that stood: By stouping he escapes, the quiueryng speare foorth flies his wayes.
Then suppliant on the ground his knées embracing: thus he sayes.
Now by thy fathers ghosts, and by Iulus hope, thée Beséeche preserue this wretched life both to my soune, and mée.
An haultie house haue, wherin there lies déepe hid in grounde
Some fasshiond, and some not, in me ne Troyane conquest lye Doth not, my selly life can not so great aduentures trye.
He said, gainst whom Aeneas thus replies with words full fell.
These summes of siluer, and of golde wherof thou late didst tell: Kéepe for thy chyldren, Turnus first these customes tooke a way Of war, when he erewhyles in cruellwyse dyd Pallas slaye, This doth Anchises soule, this doth Iulus vnderstand.
And speakinge thus, his helmet fast he roughly raught with hand, And bended downe his neck by force, and treatinge styll for lyfe:
Into his throate he thrust vp to the hilte his fatall knyfe.
Not far, Aemonides, to Phoebus, and Diana préest, Whose head with myter bownd, and sacred stoales was brauely dréest, All glittringe in attyre, and well beséene in armour fayer, Whom méetinge: out the field doth chase, and standinge on him there Doth offer vp, and couers with his shade.
Serestus takes The armour vp, therof to thée a monument, Mars, he makes.
The ranks do then restore sproonge forth of Vulcanus noble séede: Syr Coeculus, and Vmbro, that came from Marsi hilles indéede.
Ganst whome Aeneas stands in rage, and soone stricks of ground Anxurus left arme and therwith falles to earth his bucklar round.
The same some loftie words had spoken, and those he firmly thaught In time shuld take effect, his mind perhaps to heauen he raught.
And promyst to him self hoare heares, and race of many yeares.
Syr Tarquitus on thother syde, that braue in armes appeares, Whom Driope Nimphe sumtyme had borne to Faunus siluane god, With him thus raginge méets, who with his lance in length full od: His breastplate, and his shield of hugie weight he breaks in twayne, And strait his head, that now begins to pray, but all in vayne He swappes to earth, and downe to ground the corps yet warme he kest, Wheron he stoutly stode, and thus he spake with hatefull brest.
terrible now lye there, thy noble mother shall not haue Thy corps for to entumbe, or lay thy bones in natiue graue.
To foules thou shalt be left, or surginge sea shall beare awaye Thée to the hungrie fish, a very swéete, and deyntie praye.
Antaeus, and sir Lycas eke, kinge Turnus vowards, he Pursueth strait, with Numa stronge, and browne Camertes thée Of valient Volscens borne, most rytch of ground in Latine land
Lyke as Briareus, who an hundred armes had, as men say, And eke an hundred hands, and fifty mouthes wherwith alwaye Fier from his breast he spet, when Ioue against him lightninge threwe, So many bucklars vp he held, so many swords he drewe.
None otherwise Aeneas conquerour chafes the field about, When once his sword wart warme, but loe against Niphoeus stout, His charret horse against, and eke his breast his course he tooke.
But when the horse espied him comminge farre with egre looke: For feare they do retyre, and foundringe backward downe full sore They throwe their lord to grownd, and drawe the charret to the shore.
In charret drawne with milkewhite stéds comes ridinge in that tyde Syr Lucagus, with Liger that his brothers horse doth guyde.
There Lucagus full fierce his naked sword about doth glyde.
Aeneas then no longer could their franticke rage forbeare, But to them hies, and vp in sight he holds an hugie speare.
To whom thus Liger speakes: Not Diomedes horse, not yet Achilles charret héere Thou seist, nor Troyan fields, now end of war, and life so déere Thou in this land shalt find.
These Bedlem words of Ligers ioye Abroade flie forth at large, howbeit the noble prince of Troy, Meanes not with words to wage but forth a dart at him he kest, As Lucagus downe stoupes to fetch his stroke with weapon prest, And forth his horse doth beate, and liftfoote quickly puttinge out Prepares him self to fight: the lance by thutmost brim about Of glittring shield slydes by, and way into his flancke it found.
He beaten from his charret falles half dead vnto the ground.
To whom then good Aeneas prince with bitter language sayes.
Lucagus, no slow flight tis of horse that thée betrayes, Ne yet no ghost, nor dreadfull shape of foes enforst thée flye.
For thou thy self thy charret lefts, downeleapinge from onhye.
This sayd: the charret raygnes he takes, the other brother cryes, And holdinge vp his hands on earth falne from the charret lyes.
Now by thy self, and parents which thée bred so worthy a wight, Syr Troyan spare my lyfe (I pray) from dreadfull deathes despight.
Such wordes of late Thou didst not speake, now die, and parte take of thy brothers fate.
The harbour of his soule, his brest forthwith he perst with blade.
And many a valient slaughter more about the field he made, The Troian duke when here, and there he ran in furiouswyse, Much lyke a rumminge streame, or when a whirlewind black doth ryse.
Ascanius younge at length comes forth abroad into the playne, With all the youth, and tentes they leaue that were beseydge in vayne.
sister myne, and eke the same to me most louinge spouse.
As thou didst thinke, dame Venus (for deceaud thou art not sure) The Troyans welth sustaynes, els warres they might not thus endure.
In hands no force, in harts no might they haue, no paynes abyde They could, vnlesse sum heauenly wight did them support, and guyde.
Why dost thou gréeue me still, aye wt words great dreadynge bringe? Such force in loue as haue had of yore, or ought to haue If now had: thou shuldst not sticke to graunt that do craue, Omnipotent since thou art, both Turnus now from fight to take, And him for euer salf to auntient Daunus sier to make.
Howbeyt now let him dye, and yéeld his blood to Troyans hands.
Yet in direct descent of kinde of goddes he rightly stands.
Pilumnus fouerth is from his syer, thy temples largly he With gifts adorned hath, which furnysht well with presents be.
If stay of present death, or tyme for mortall youth you séeke, Which so you thinke may determe: take Turnus then awaye, And do by flight, his dangers prest which destnies threat, delaye.
So longe am content he lyue, but if you farther craue, By subtile treatie sure redresse of all this war to haue, Or that the fates may altred be: your hope is spent in vaine.
In word which you ne dayne, What if you that in hart wold graunt, and Turnus lyfe prolonge? But giltlesse now an heauie end him bides, or wold wronge Did iudge, and with neadlesse feare were deceaued quyte, And thou which canst: these things a newe woldst turne to better ryte.
And with her bringes a winter storme, and cloudes about her bends.
And to the Troyan host, and Laurent tents she fast doth hie.
And there an hollowe cloud, a forcelesse shadowe, by and by, Much lyke Aeneas shape (a thinge most strange, and rare to sée)
Euen so all those gainst whom Mezentius hath iust cause of ire.
None hath the hart in equall fight to méete him hand to hand, But throwinge darts, and raisinge hugie noyse aloofe they stand.
He fearlesse looks about, and doubts whichway his course to make, And gnasshes with his téeth, and on his back their darts doth take.
From auntient coasts of Coritus, a Graetian Acron hight There came, who promist wife, and weddinge had forsane by flight.
Whom when Mezentius sées, amyd the rankes moue stur, and strife: In purple plumes full braue, and scarlet wéede of promist wife.
Lyke as an hungry lion, about the forest rownd doth praunce, (So hunger mad constraines) if he a rowebuck swift by chaunce, Or els as Sore may find, whose tendre hornes begin to ryse: He rampes for ioye, and wyde he gapes, and vp his brestles flyes, And falles vpon him cloase, and strait he bathes in goary blood His gready iawes: Mezentius so him hies against his foes in hasty mood.
Vnhappy Acron falles to ground, and earth with héeles doth beate, Whilst vp he yelds the gost, and speare not broken with blood doth weate.
Ne sir Orodes wold he dayne, that thence apace did flie To cast to ground, ne at his backe his tremblinge dart to wrie.
But full in face him méets, and man for man with him doth fight, Inferiour in deceat, but not in déeds of martiall might.
On him then prostrate on the earth both settinge foote, and speare, Of war no porcion smale, loe tall Orodes lieth there.
His mates agayne a dubled sound sendforth with ioyfull hart, He diynge speakes: sure vnreuengd my death what euer you art, Thou shalt not find, ne longe enioy, like destnies thée do call, And where lie, these very fieldes shall sée thy fatall fall.
Thou now shalt die, as touchinge me: the father of gods, and men.
Looke he to that, and with that word the speare from corps he drew.
Vnto his eyes doth bitter rest, and deadly sléepe ensue, With aye continuing night, and neuer more the day to view.
Then Caedicus sir Alcathous sleies, Hidaspes eke at length Is by Sacrator sleyne, Parthenius eke by Rapo, in strength Right rough likewise sir Orses, and Messapus réeues of breath, Sir Clonius strong, Ericates Lycaonius sendes to death.
Who now by fall offrantike iade lies on the ground, the same
footeman him now sieyes on foote, and who from Argos came Sir Lycius, him against of grandsiers force not frustrate quight: Braue Valerus downe doth throw, sir Sale Antronius killes in fight.
And him Nealces sleyes in castyng dartes of noble skill, And could from very far strike with an arrow what he will.
The gréeuous fight like sorowes now, mutual deathes had wraught, Ech others slew, and they them selues were soone to slaughter braught, Both conquerours and the conquered sort, ne these will flie, ne thay.
The Gods from Ioues supernall house their bootlesse wrath do way, And pitie on both partes takes, and on poore mortals heauie plight.
On th'oneside Venus fayer lookes downe, on th'other Iuno bright And pale Tisiphone frets, and fumes in thickst amid the fight.
Mezentius fierce a mighty dart then shakyng in his hande,
Comes fliyng to the field, much like Orion great from lande When he on foote through midst of déepest seas, and surges walkes, And cuts a way through lakes, and to the shoulders in waters stalkes.
Or when an auncient Oke from highest hilles he home doth fetch, And walkyng on the grounde his loftie head the cloudes doth retch.
Euen so Mezentius fierce in monstrous armour in comes he.
Aeneas straight when him within the rankes afarre doth sée: Prepares against to goe, but he awhit not dreadyng stayes, Vntill his foe approche, his mighty corps he there doth payes.
And measuryng with his eye the space how far his dart could glide: This righthande this of mine, and fliyng launce which here guide, Be happy God to me pray, and here a vowe make, The spoyles which now from of the corps of this same théefe take: Thou for a monument, Lausus, shalt enioy, he sayd, a launce Then straight casts foorth, that flies, and from Aeneas shield doth glau~ce, And worthy Anthor strake, and twixt his ribbes and guttes it went.
Anthor to sir Alcides mate, that was from Argos sent, And to Euander claue, and auncient Itayle towne possest: With others wound vnhaply falles, and face to heauen he kest, And yéelding vp the ghost, swéet Argos oft doth call to minde.
Aeneas then a dart doth cast, that flies as swift as winde.
And where the hollow bosse about with thréefold plates of bras, With linen linings, and with thréefold playtes of bulleshide, was Well linde: the whirling dart through flies, and in his flanke doth light, No force might it withstande.
That hunge downe by his side, when Tyrrhen blood he doth espie.
And to him trembling al in rage he quickly draweth nie.
Then Lausus for his fathers chaunce doth mone in piteouswise, When he the déed beheld, and plentie teares ran downe hys eies.
This hateful hap of death, and eke those valient factes of thyne, (Yf later Time therto to credite giue do not repyne:) Thy passing déeds, noble Youth, in silence shal not lye. Mezentius hurt retires, and back vnweldy fast doth hye, And with his shield his enmies speare also with him he drew.
Forth Lausus sprang, and strayt him self amid the weapons threw.
And now his righthand vp he cast, his mighty stroke he fet:
When vnder Aeneas sword he comes, and it with stay doth let.
Their mates with mighty noyse, and shout, this worthy déede pursue.
And hid with Lausus shield the father him self from thence withdrue.
And darts they thicke do throw, and foes from far prouoke to fight.
Aeneas ragyng frets, and shields him self with bucklar bright.
And like as when a cloud, fulfraught with hayle to ground doth fall, The ploughmen do from out the fields with spéede conuey them all, The husbandmen thence hie, the wayfaryng man some harbour takes: riuers bancke, or hollow stony cliffe his succour makes, Whilst downe it poweres, that when the Sunne returns agayn to sight: To woonted traueill fall, and labour lately left they might.
So stands Aeneas still, with weapons on ech side opprest, On him whilst that this cloud of war, and ragyng all doth rest.
And Lausus then beginnes to check, and Lausus thus to threat.
Whether desperate runst? dost atte~pt thinges for thy power to great? This foolish loue of thine hath thée vnskilfull quite forlorne.
And he likewise on thotherside, no lesse doth bragge, and skorne.
Vnto the Troyan prince great furie now in breast doth raigne, And destnies had the vitall thréed of Lausus cut in twaine.
For through his bulck Aeneas soone his mighty fauchon draue, And hid it in him whole, his shield, and all his armour claue, His coate also his mother which of soft fine golde had knit, And fild his bosome full of bloud, his life away doth flit, And sorowfull to the soules doth hast, and body leaues behinde.
But when he saw his face which now to gastly death resignid,
His face which pale in wondrous sort did looke: he wofull stands, And pitifully bewayles, and vp with greif doth cast his hands.
The semblant deape of fathers loue comes eft into his mind.
What praises due youth, shall for these thy merites find? What may Aeneas work so worthy a nature to requyte? Thyne armour kéepe, wherin alwayes thou tookest thy most delyte.
Thy soule vnto thy grandsiers gosts, thyne asshes to the graue send, if that thy freends herof a due reguard will haue.
This onethinge yet a comfort to thy dolefull death shalbe,
His fellowes staggringe he Much blames, and vp the corps he liftes, begoaring all with blood The curious kembed lockes, as then the finest facion stood.
Therwhiles his father on the banck of Tyber noble flood.
His woundes with water wipes, and féeble body there doth rest Against a bending trée, his brasen helmet, and his creast: Far of hanges on a bough, his armour great lies on the grasse, And chosen youthes about him stand, he pantes for breath, and as He féeble was, his neck doth ease, his beard hangs downe on brest.
And much on Lausus he enquires, his mind can take no rest, And many forth vnto him sendes from fight him to recall, And of his fathers carefull hart him to enforme withall.
Then Lausus dead his mates bringe home with griefe and dubled paine.
Lamentinge sore so mighty a man, so mighty a wound had slaine.
The mind that mischeif did abode, his sunne afar did know.
His hoarye heares with filthy dust he daubes, and vp doth throw
Both handes vnto the heauens, and fast vnto the corps doth cleaue.
sunne, had such lust here styll to liue, ne life to leaue, That shuld thée to cruell enmies rage obiected sée, Whom begat? and with thy blood preserued aliue to bée, Thus liuinge by the death? To me poore wretch doth nought remaine, Saue exile sharpe, a bitter wound my wofull hart hath slaine.
And (my sunne) thy noble name with foule reproch haue staind, Pulst forth through spyte fro~ princely throne, place where father raind: Due punishement haue well deséerud, at countreis hands to dye All kinds of death, which (but to glose) cannot sure denye.
Howbeit, as yet, liue, ne men, ne light do forsake, But shorty so will do, and with that word: he doth betake Him to his wounded thigh, wheron he stands in painfull case.
The deaply stroken wound doth cause him much to slack his pace.
But nought in courage quaild for stéede he calles, his only stay,
And only comfort still that was, wherby he went away
Still conquerour from the field, and to his steede began to cast.
Rhoebus, longe (if ought to mortall men be longe at all) Wée liued haue, this day with blouddy spoyles returne agayne: Or with Aeneas head thou shalt, and so of Lausus payne Reuenger be with me, or els if force no way can finde: With me togither shalt be slayne, since thou of valient kinde, Canst not abide (I thinke) a straunge, or Troian lorde to know.
This sayd: vpon the woonted backe himself he doth bestow.
And eche hand strayt he armes with deadly dart, and pearsing speare.
The brasen helmet glittryng shines, and creast of horses heare, And swift he thronges into the thickst, great shame hart doth freat Deepe lodgde within, and madnesse mixt in breast with sorow great, And loue incenst with rage, and priuie touche of enmies might.
Then thrise Aeneas there with mighty noyse he calles to fight.
Aeneas knew his voyce, and glad in minde began to pray.
The kyng of Gods, Apollo eke do graunt thou say not nay, To deale with me in fight.
This much he sayd, and with an hugie speare him straight doth méet.
To whom then he, cruell wretch with threats why dost thou gréet, Since thou my Sunne hast slayne? this was the next, and only way For thée to frame my fatall fall, and weaue my last decay.
No loue to lothsome light beare, for life do not care,
Nor is there any of the Gods whom regard, or spare.
Leaue of, come to die, but first this gift to thée brynge.
He sayd: and strait a quiueryng dart against his foe doth flynge.
Then forth another, and then another he throwes, and rounde doth ride mightie race, the golden shield can well their force abide.
And thrise the Carrire rounde about him standyng in the fielde In castyng foorth his dartes he rode, the Troian lorde his shield Thrise carieth rounde, with cruell wood of dartes quite ouerspred.
But when he shames so longe to stay, so many a sticking head
To pull away, and néede compelles vnequall fight to trie,
And foes incensed rage, aye bent to bloud, and death doth spie, Much castyng in his minde: at last breakes foorth, and doth enforce dart into the hollow temples of the warlike horse.
Vpstandes the stéede on end, and beates the aier his héeles withall, Then downe he tumblyng comes, and faultryng on the man doth fall.
He grouelinge on his face with shoulder wrest from ioynt there lies.
The Troyans, and the Latines eke with clamour touch the skies.
Aeneas fliynge comes, and from the sheath his blade drawes out, And this with all he speakes.
Wheres now (I pray) Mezentius stout? Where now that cruell force of mynd, and courage bold in fight? To whom Mezentius, when he larger breath, and heauens sight Had drawne, and daunted sprites began refresshed well to be: bytter foe, why bragst thou thus, and threatnest death to me? By slaughter is no wronge ywrought, ne came so to fight, Ne did for me my Lausus deare such league, or bargeine smyte.
This one thinge request, of lordes if vassayles grace may craue, My bodie let entombed be, wote my subiectes haue Great hatred me against, theyr rage defend from me away, And do vouchsaufe in one self graue, my sunne, and me to lay.
He spake: and strait the sword aduisde into his throat receaues, And gushinge goary blood the lyfe amid his armour leaues.
Conquerour Aeneas setteth vp a monument to Mars for Mezentius slayne.
Pallas corps is with great pompe sent to Euanders towne.
Embassadours are sent from Latinus, to intreat for truce of twelue dayes, duryng which time they yeld the dutie of sepulture to their dead, on both partes.
And thiswhile Venulus that was sent at the beginnyng of the war, to require ayde of Diomedes: returneth with deniall.
Then Latinus destitute of hope calleth a counsell, and consulteth to send Embassadours to Aeneas with conditions of peace.
Drances, and Turnus vppon auncient hatred inueigh one at the other.
Therwhiles Aeneas deuiding his armie in twaine: sendeth his lighthorsemen before directly to the towne: And he himself, with the rest of his power, marcheth through woods, and ouer hilles towards the hiest parte of the towne, whiche beynge once knowne within Laurentum towne, they leaue the counsell, and prepare suche thinges as are necessary for resistance.
Then Turnus vnderstandinge Aeneas intent: by spies, deuideth likewise his power in twayne, and giueth Messapus, and Camilla charge of the horsemen.
Himself taketh the straytes, wherethrough Aeneas must needes passe to the towne, there lieth in ambush.
The horsemen on bothe sides meete, and the victorie is a great whyle vncerten.
There Camilla after many slaughters, whilst vnwarely she pursueth Cloreus Cybeles priest, mooued therto by ye beutie of his armour: is by Aruns strok through with a dart.
For not longe after he was stroke through likewise with an arrow, by Opis, a Nimphe of Dianas trayne.
The Rutilians dismayde at Camillas death: commit them selues to flight, the Troians prepare to besiedge the towne.
These heauie tidynges beyng tolde by Acca, Camillas mate vnto Turnus: leauyng the ambush he hastneth to come succour his men.
Aeneas followeth after, and bycause the night drawinge on, they coulde not fight: both pitche their Tentes before the towne.
THe dawning day thiswhile, ye Ocean sea had cléerely left.
Aeneas though some Time on those whom warres of liues had reft,
His care constraines him to employ, theyr graues for to prepare,
And now his minde, and senses all on funerals fixed are:
To gods yet nathelesse, at risinge of the morninge gray, For conquest great obtaind, his vowes, and seruice due doth pay.
mighty Oke, whose boughes were quyte shread of from euery side, Vpon an hill he and armour braue theron he tyde, The duke Mezentius spoyles, a monument mighty Mars for thée.
And fittes therto his creastes, which yet with goare blood droppinge bée, And truncheons burst of speares, his brestplate in twelue places smyt, And in so many thrust through, and bucklar bright of brasse doth fyt To his lefthand, his blade with Iuerie trimd hunge downe his nick.
Then there his mates (for all the troupe of lordes about him thick There stoode) reioycinge he exhortes and thus to them gan say.
Here now remaine the spoiles, and hansell of the hautie kinge.
Mezentius loe here lies, whom to his death these handes did bringe.
Next goe vnto the king we must, and to Laurentum wall.
Cheere vp your hartes to fight, and hope the war will haply fall.
Let lingringe none vnwares, so soone as ensignes we assay At Gods commaundment to remoue, and youth from tentes conuay: Vs hindre, or els feare from purposd fact vs hartlesse stay.
Therwhiles our mates, and bodies which vnburied lie: to graue Let vs betake, this only due, departed soules do craue.
And go ({quod} he) these worthy wightes which with their blood, this land For you haue bought: with last rewardes do honour out of hand.
And to Euanders sorowfull towne let Pallas first be sent.
Whom not deuoid of courage stout, myshap his life hath rent, dire, and dismold day hath drencht full déepe in deadly lake.
These thinges he wéepinge spake, forth his way to place doth take Where Pallas body dead Acetes autient fier did tend, That was Euanders parge in youth, but not vnto the end With like goodluck alotted was companion to his sun.
About him seruantes all the rout, and troupes of Troians run, And dolefull dames of Troy, with heare of custome quite vntrust.
So soone as into loftie dores him self Aeneas thrust:
Wity wofull cries, and plaintes resoundes againe the pallaice great.
But when he saw the head of Pallas faier held vp, his face, And wound in breast so smooth, broad gapinge open a mighty space, Which Turnus launce had made: the tricklinge teares ra~ downe his eies.
wretched lad ({quod} he) when lucky fortune gan to rise, Enuied she thée to me? that thou our kingdome shuldst not se, Nor yet vnto thy fathers coastes as conquerour borne to be? Not this promise to Euander kinge thy sier did make, When him parted fro, and me in folded armes did take.
And to a mighty reigne me sent, and warnd me what might fall, The men were fierce, the nation hard that shuld fight with all.
And now deceaued much with frustrate hope, and vaine desier, Perhappes he praiers makes, and altars heapes with blood, and fier.
This youth now dead, and to no heauenlie power beholdinge, we With heauy hartes do honours giue that nought auailinge be.
These are our glad returnes, and triumphes after wars so bold, This is the trust in me repoasd, yet sure thou shalt not se With shamefull dastard woundes thy sunne (Euander) sleyne to be.
Ne wish him dead whilst he did liue, greife, and sorow most, How great astay Ausonia, and Iulus hast thou lost?
When he for all thease thinges had wept his fill, the corps a non
He biddes them vp to take, out of his armie many a one, thousand men in tale doth choose the funerall pompe to guide, And present be at fathers teares, some comfort to prouide, Though smale in his so great a greife, which wofull fathers take.
Some hurdles thick with force do frame, some do the coffin make Of tendre twisted twigges of trées, and slendre slyppes of oke.
And on those buylded beddes, with boughes thick shadowes do prouoke.
Hereon the lad aloft on wad of cuntrey straw they lay.
Much like a flower which virgins thombe from stalke hath nipt away, Whether it be tendre violet, or languishinge daffadill white, Whose glittringe hue not yet is gone, nor passinge beutie bright, Though mother Tellus yéeld no sappe, and strength is vaded quite.
Two mantels then with purple fine, and gold that stiffe did stand: Aeneas forth did bringe, which once Quéene Dido her one hand In happy state for him had made, with webbe of gold full smal.
The one of these vpon the youth for honour last of all He putteth on, and lockes that shalbe burnt therwith doth hyde.
And many a worthy spoyle reséerud since Laurent war besyde, He heapes theron, and biddes the spoyles be borne in longe aray.
And horse, and weapons addes, which from his foes he tooke away.
And certen captiues bound for sacrafice therwith he sent Vnto thinfernall gods, whose blood the fiers shuld all besprent.
And truncheons great of speares, with armour tane from foes theron, The capteynes biddes to beare, with foes names fastned thereupon.
There goes Acetes sad (good man) with store of yeares opprest, His face eft manglinge with his nayles, eft bounsing of his breast With faintnes downe he falles, and corps alonge on earth doth rest.
And charrets also forth they leade, embrued with Rutil blood.
Then Aethon next, his courser fayer, beréeud of trappings stood,
And after wéepinge comes, and weates his face with mighty teares.
Some beares his speare, his helmet some, the resdue Turnus weares Since him he slew, the sorowfull bandes of Troyans do ensue, And Tyrrhen capteynes, th' Archads eke, with weapons turnd ascue.
But when this goodly traine afar, was marched on the way: There still Aeneas stood, and moorninge wise these words did say.
The selfsame wofull chaunce of war, doth vs from hence withcall, Of many another valient youth to wayle the wofull fall.
He said no more, but to the walles his steppes he strayt withdrue.
And now Embassadours were sent from Latine towne so great, With braunch of Oliue bough in hand, for licence to entreat.
Such bodies as lay dead in fieldes, with mortal woundes opprest For to requyre, that they in graues might take their finall rest.
Gainst conquerd wightes, wantinge breath, no fight remaynes at all.
His hostes that he wold dayne to spare, whom fathers he once did call.
To whom then good Aeneas, since but iust, and rightfull thay Did aske: doth licence graunt, and more vnto them thus doth say.
What fortune foule, Latines, hath you to such warres betake, In such a rash, and foolish sort our fréendship to forsake? And do you leaue, and licence now for men departed craue? Whom do wysh, that when they lieud, the same shuld rather haue.
Ne had come, but destnies here a place for vs did chuse, Ne do gainst your nation fight.
Your kinge did me refuse To enterteyne, and rather claue vnto kinge Turnus might.
For whom more equall it had byn to trie this deathes despite.
If that with hand this war to end, and Troyans hence to shooue He do prepare, it better were in armes with me to prooue.
Then he shuld liue whom gods, his life, or his righthand would
But now depart, and for your peoples burials do prepare.
The auntienst then that Drances hight, for crime, and iust desart With Turnus that offended was, his wordes thus gan impart.
péerlesse prince of great renowme, in armes of greater fame, How shall shew thy prayse, or to the gods compare the same? Thy laud for Iustice shall we first, or martiall feates admire? These thinges vnto our citie we will shew with great desire.
And thée vnto Latinus king, if fortune graunt, will ioyne, Let Turnus in some other place for leagues anew purloyne.
Moreouer, and the hugie moles of fatall walles to reare We shalbe glad, and to that work on shoulders stones to beare.
He ended had, with one consent the same they all alow.
And for twelue dayes they Truce do take, and peace a space do vow.
The Troyans, and the Latines mixt in woods do wandre frée, And rownd on toppes of hilles they rome, and holtes full huge that bée.
And here with stroke of mighty are the brittle ashe doth sownd.
There loftie Pynes that touch the starres, are throwne vnto the grownd.
The mighty okes, and Ceders smellinge soote the wedges teare, And sturdie Cartes do crack, full heauie laden them home that beare.
Euander wofull man, his house, and all his town doth fill, That Pallas was in Latium late a coquerour, did report.
Th' Archadians run vnto the gates, as is their wonted sort: They funeral brondes do beare, the wayes alonge echwhere do shéene With rankes of flambinge fiers, and seuerals make the fieldes betwéene.
The Troyan rout approchinge fast do ioyne their wofull lay.
Whom when the auntient Dames perceaud to pallaice take their way: With wofull cries, and piteous shoutes the town they do repleat.
But forth into the thickst he thronges, and down him self doth lay Vpon the beare where Pallas was, and there doth wéepinge stay, And scarce vnto his speach with much adoe could ope the way.
Didst not, Pallas, thou to me thy sier this promise make, That charely thou woldst thy self to cruel warre betake? knew rightwell the nouell pride, and glory first in fight, And pleasaunt honour wunne in armes: how much preueyle it might.
hard beginnings to lad, and sorowfull martiall trayne, My sacrafice, and praiers fond to gods powrdforth in vayne.
And most holly wife and Quéene, by death thryse happy thée, That hast not lyeud vnto this day, this wretched sight to sée.
But by seinge this, my fatall terme haue passed quite, That father yet remayn aliue, and sée this wofull sight.
More méete had byn the Troyan armes followed had in féeld, And ouerwhelmd with Rutil dartes, my lyfe to death had yéeld.
And only me this noble pompe, not Pallas home shuld bringe.
Ne shuld you, Troyans, blame, your league, ne yet the thinge, Which we wt righthandes giuen on both partes swore, whe~ in my grou~d Most faithful harbour, and in court you incertaynment found.
But since my sunne by death vntymely from this life must pas:
comfort take, the Troyans since to Latium in he braught,
So many thousand Volscans sleine, his fatall end he caught.
Nor other funerall rytes shalt thou, sunne Pallas, get of mée, Then good Aeneas, Phrygians eke, and Tyrrhenes gyue to thée.
Great monumentes they bringe, of such as died by thy righthand.
And thou lykewise, a mighty corps now dead in armes shuldst stand, If match had byn his age, and equall yeares lyke strength to thyne Had, Turnus, made: somuch therat should not then repine.
But why do you Troyans now so longe from battle stay? Depart, and to Aeneas kinge from me this messadge say.
That this lothsome life endure, since Pallas now is dead: Thy righthand is the cause, which to the fathers hoarie head, And to the sunne doth Turnus owe, herin thou maist deserue Alonly well of me, and proue thy chaunce.
Not to preserue The ioyes of life séeke, ne doth myne age thesame requier.
But to the ghostes belowe to beare those newes is my desier.
The morninge had therwhiles to mortall men restord agayne The chéerful day, that nought to them but traueiles bringes, and payne.
Great bonefiers build, the bodies thither of all their fréendes, the thronge As cuntreys custome biddes do bringe, and fier therunder make.
The loftie heauen anon with thick and smutchy smoke lookes blake.
And thryse about the burninge fiers they ran in armour bright.
And thryse on horsback rode about the fiers with hollowinge rite.
And wofull waylinges forth did send, and teares letfall amayne, Vpon their weapons, and vpon their harneis like the rayne.
The crie of men to heauen ascendes, and ratlinge Trompetes sound.
And some the spoyles of such as there lay sleyne of Latine ground: Their helmets fayer into the fier, and guilden swordes they threw, And bridles braue, and charret whéeles yet warme, and some they knew, By others are cast in, their shields and weapons void of luck.
And many an oxe thernigh, they done to death, and thither pluck, And many a brestled Boare, and cattayle store the fields throughout: They sley and flinge them in the flames, then all the shore about Their fellowes burninge they behold, and bones half brent do kéepe, And scarce from thence can be withdrawen, til moystie night that sléepe Prouokes, the heauen inturnd, and whole with starres replenisht had.
Now on the otherside in semblant sort, the Latines sad Innumerable bonefiers built, and many a body thay In graues deape digd bestow, and many a corps they send a way To neighboures nigh at hand, and to Lauinium towne agayne.
The resdue, and the hugie heape, of such as there lay slayne, Both numbrelesse, and honourlesse they burne, the fields full wyde With plenty flaminge fiers, bright shininge shew on euery syde.
The thirde day had from heauen nights chyllie shade expeld away, When heauelie the Ashes heapes which there confused lay:
And now within the walles, and towne of ritch Latinus kinge, The greatest noyse was heard, and far the wurst, and wofulst chéere, Of mothers, and sunnes wiues, mixt with the plaints of sisters déere.
And babes bereft of fathers swéet, this cruell war detest, And Turnus promist spousals, that twas he aboue the rest That was in batayle sought, that he his force must trie in fight, That for Italia scepter séekes, and honour due of right.
These thinges good auntient Drances fiercely telles, and record béeres That Turnus tis alone, whom Troyan prince in fight requéeres.
With diuerse things besides, which many against him did dispute.
Howbeit the counance of the Quéene doth them at full refute.
The fame of many monuments tane do much his name aduaunce.
Then in these sturres, amyd this tumult hot, by woundrous chaunce: Behold, from forth the mighty towne of Diomedes kinge, Embassadours with answere do returne, that they nothings
With so great trauail spent, with giftes, nor gold to end haue brought, Nor ernest prayers tane effect, new meanes there must be wrought, Or of the Troyan prince some league of peace there must be sought.
With sorow great in soundings then downe falles Latinus Kynge.
And that Aeneas Destnies there, and power of gods did brynge: The wrath of gods there shewes, and graues fresh digd before his face.
Wherfore assembly great, and nobles all to come in place
By wrytes he warnes, and to his princelye house doth them transport.
They all do méete, and to the place ech way they thick resort.
Latinus then in mydst amongst them all, of auntienst yeares, With carefull countnance sittes, and cheife in hand his scepter beares.
The legates then, that from Aetola towne with answere came, He biddes declare their charge, and orderly requires the same.

When he our message heard: with calmed speach these wordes gan say.
happy nations, where Saturnus kinge somtyme bare sway, Ausonians auntient eke, when you your liues in quiet lead, What fortune causd you then the pathes to straungie warres to tread? So many of vs all, as Troyan fieldes with warre did foyle, (Such thinges passe, as vnderneath the walles with wofull toyle Were done, and whatkind men do vnder Simois water lye) The same with wofull punishment throughout the wordle we bye.
And all of vs great penaunce for that foule offence sustayne.

For why? my mates which haue lost, the ayer wt winges haue raught.

And since that time all other thinges doubt, and feare as ill, When like a bedlem beast, celestiall wightes with stéele smit, And into Venus hand a gréeuous wound did hastly hyt.
Do not pray, my fréendes, me to such batayle euer call.
For neuer since first great Troy downe fell by fatal fall, With Troians would haue ought to do, ne doth it me delight, When of these mischéeues do thinke, though they be finisht quite.
As for the presentes which to me you bringe from out your land: Vnto Aeneas beare them back, with whom wée hand to hand Or this haue fought, and him against in open armes haue stand.
Beléeue me that haue tryed, in shield with what force he doth rise? And with what deadly dint his mighty speare in fight he wries? Yf that besides this man two other such Troy towne had bred: Them selues forth to Inachus towne the Troyans sure had sped.
And Graetia with contrarie fates shuld wayle her heauie plight.
For surely what soeuer stay was made in Troyan fight:
Wherby that warre to terme of ten yeares complete was delayd.
Of valient courage both, and both in armes of worthy might.

Some riuer swift do stay, the streame within doth ratlinge sound, And all the bankes about with cracklinge noyse agayn redound.
So soone as were their mindes appeasd, and mouthes at rest did stay: The kinge to gods first praid, and from hie throne these words gan say.
Before this tyme, Latines, to determine of this case More méete had bin, and my self therof desierous was.
And not thus at this present tyme, a counsell now to call, When foes be fast at hand, and enmies rownd besiedge the wall.
bootlesse warre, Citizens, with stock of gods we beare, And with a man, whose valient force no warres could euer weare, Nor wearie once in fight, nor cause him leaue though he were wunne.
If in Aetolian armes some hope to put you once begunne, Whom now for aid you call: henceforth sée that reposed bée Echones hope in him self, which how smal tis, yow all do sée.

The bodie whole of all the realme within this warre was prest.
And now at last what sentence in my doubtfull mind doth lye: meane to shewe, in few wordes (giue eare) will descrie.
There lies an auntient field to Tyber riuer neare about, Forth buttinge on the west, and to Sicilia stretchinge out.
Arunci, and Rutilians till the same, and hillockes smart With ploughes they turne, and mountains sharpe to pastures do conuart.
This region whole, and hillie coast with Pines that doth abound: Lets for the Troyan fréendshippe giue, and equall leagues compound.
And make them fellowes in our land, and place vnto them yéeld, Since that so great desier they haue, and cities let them buéeld.
But if to other coastes to cut, straunge nations to assay They do entend, and from our land they may depart away: Twyse ten tall shippes of Itail Oke lets build them by and by, Or moe, if so they néede, the stuffe by Tybers side doth lye.
Let them the numbre point, and for their shippes the fashion show: And wée the kéeles, and workmanship, and tacklinges will bestow.
Morcouer these our wordes to tell, and leagues of truce to frame, An hundred legates forth to send to them, in Latines name:
And giftes of price to beare of Iuerie, with great summes of gold.
And kinglie cloth of state, and mantel, badge of all our land.
To publique welth down torne almost, set to your helping hand.
And fame of great exploites atchieud against him causd to kick.
In gooddes right ritch, but more of toongue, in warre of dastard mynd, But yet in sad, and counsell graue, not farre the best behind, Full fit sedicous seede to rayse, whom mothers noble blood With pride had prickt, but of his father vncerten still that stood: Standes vp, and him in wordes doth blame, and aggrauates with ire.

But let him giue me leaue to speake, and pride lay down a side, By whose vnhap, and dealinges far from honest maners wide, (For speake will, though swordes to mée, and cruel death he threat) So many valient captaynes died, and all this citie great With mourninge sittes amoapte, whilst Troyan tentes he doth assay, Then takes him to his héeles, and welkin winnes with armes to fray.
Amonge these many giftes to Troyans which you send, one thinge Do cause moreouer likewise to be borne, mighty kinge.
Let no mad rage of eny man so much your mind peruart, But that vnto so worthy sunne in law, you would impart Your daughter bright in mariage, perpetual peace to make.
But if such feare of Turnus in your tremblinge breast do ake: Lets him entreat, and ernestly to him then let vs sue, That to our kinge, and cuntrey he would yeeld that is their due.
Why dost thou thus our citizens in doubtfull daunger bringe So often, thou of Latium plagues that art the only springe? By warre no sauftye sure we get, for peace wée all do craue At thy handes Turnus, and the maid Lauinia younge to haue.
And first my self, whom scarce (I knowe) thou thinkst thy fréend to bée, Nor care to be, for pitie loe entreatinge come to thée.
Take pitie on thy cuntreymen, lay downe thy Peacockes traine, Depart, since thou art vanquished, to many bodies slaine Wée do already sée, our broad wyde fieldes forlorn do lie.
But if such great renowne, or courage bold in breast on hie Thou dost conceaue, or princesse younge thou dost desier soe: Attempt him then, and with bold hart encounter with thy foe.
That Turnus may by meanes therof enioy a Quéene to wife.
Wée sellie sotiles, vnburied sort, and vnbewayled, rife About the fieldes shall lie.
And thou, if eny force remayne, Or sparck of fathers valient vertue in thy breast: agayne Looke him in face that thée doth call.
Hereat then Turnus all in rage doth boyle in burninge brest,
And giues a grone, and from his hart full deape these wordes doth wrest.
Great sloare of talke is redy, Drances, euermore to thée, When blooddy warres do handes requyre, and first in place to bée Thou wilt be sure, to parlament when Senatours resort.
But still the court must not be fild with wordes, and vayne report, Which in abundance great from thée do flie, whilst citie wall Betwéene thée, and thyne enmye standes, nor ditches blood withall Do flowe about.
Wherfore as is thy wunted guyse persist, And thoundre out thy twatlinge talke, as longe as thou shalt list.
And do of feare mée then accuse, when thy couragicus hand So many heapes hath sleyn of those that came from Ilium land.
And all the fieldes about with monumentes braue decked stand.
And there what can thy mighty manhcde do thou mayst assay.
And as for foes, wée néed not to go séeke them far away, For rownde the walles they do besiedge.
Come on, and let vs goe, And still through dastard cowardice continew not so sloe.
What? with thy pratlinge toongue alone thus alwayes wilt thou fight? And shall thy foolish féete be prest alwaies to shamfull flight? Was repulst? or is there eny (wretched varlet) well That can auouch the same? with Troyan blood when Tyber swell, And all Euanders stock, and house to ruine brought to bée, And all th' Archadian host, of armes, and force despoild shall sée? Not so did Bitias find in me, nor yet Pandarus fell.
Nor thousandes, whom this righthand in one day sent down to hell, When was cloasd with walles, and hard with heapes of foes beset.
By warre no sauftic shall we get? these vaine deuises let Be boded to Aeneas head, and to thyne owne estate.
Nor cease not styll to troble all with foolish fearfull fate, And to extoll that nacions force, that twise was woonne in fight.
And now the valient péeres of Greece the Phrygian armes do dread.
Or els Aufidus riuer swift runnes backe vnto his head.
See, this dissembler vile great feare doth feyne for dread of me, And aggreuates the crime that it might séeme more big to be.
But neuer thou by me thy life shalt lose, hold thee at rest, Let that abide with thée, and still remayne within thy brest.
And now come to thée, and counsels great thou dost disclose, Most mightie prince, if in our strength no trust thou dost repose, If so wée be forsane, and when our force is once subdued, Wée quite away ben cast, and fortune cannot be renued: Then lets intreat for peace, and yéeldyng handes to him submit.
But, O, if any iote of woonted vertue bide as yet:
will extoll, who, cause he would no such thing once beholde: Himself did yéelde to death, and with his téeth did teare the ground.
But if some sparkes remayne, and youthes vntwitcht may yet be founde, And fréendly townes in Italy, and peoples mayne of might.
But if to Troians fall with losse of bloud, the price of fight, And equall slaughter they sustayne, and like lucke them attaynt: Why should wée thus like dastardes vile, at first beginnyng faynt? And feare before wée do beginne to fight, doth vs appall?
Chaunge thinges to better state, and Fortune whom she did disgrace: Oft times agayne doth rayse, and prinkes him vp in prouder place.
Though Diomede, Arpenses eke to vs no help will bring, Messapus will, and happy prince in warre Tolumnius king.
And Dukes from many nations sent, nor tis no simple prayse The mighty mustars tane through Latium lande are like to rayse.
And from the noble Volscan blouddes the mayde Camilla hight, troupe of horsemen that conductes in brasen armour bright.
But if the Troyans me alone do séeke for hand to hand, And so you please, and publiqueweale so much do withstand: So conquest (as trust) from these handes will not part away, That any hazard for this hope dread for to assay.
With courage gayntst him will go, though he Achilles pas, And weare like armour strong, that made by hand of Vulcan was.
This life, Turnus, to you all, and to Latinus vow, To any of mine auncestours in prowes that will not bow.
If me alone the Phrygian prince do call, am content,
Or whether on mée (wofull wretch) the wrath of god is bent.
would not for my sake, that Drances died, or do sustaine, If the conquest win, one iote of praise woon by my paine.
These wordes amonge them selues they do debate of doubtfull thinges.
Aeneas then remooues his campe, and forth his battaill bringes.
When loe, into the pallaice strait with dred, and tumult great, skout comes in, that doth the totall town with feare repleat.
That Troyans now from Tyber shoare come fast in battail ray.
And Tyrrhen bandes in rankes there round about the fildes they lay.
Then strayt amazed were mens mindes, and peoples breastes with feare Astoond, and with no simple flames of ire incenst they were.
They tremblinge then for armour call, the youth for weapons fret, The sorowfull fathers wéepe, and mumblinge moninge voices fet.
An hugie noise of sundry tunes into the ayer doth ryse.
None otherwise then like a shole of foules aloft that flies, And on a thicket lightes, or when by Padus riuer shoare The horcey swannes do lift their lay, the bankes the same do roare.
Then Turnus takinge present tyme, citizens, he sayes, Goe call a counsell now, and sittinge speake of peaces prayse, Whilst foes into our realmes do run, no more therof he sayd: But forth he flinges, and soone him self out of the house conuayd.
Thou Volusus, commaund ({quod} he) the Volscans, armes to take.
And thou thy self the Rutils leade, Messapus, ready make, And with his brother Coras ioynt the coastes about to skoure.
And some to fortefie the gates, some furnish euery tower.
The rest with me, as haue told, into the field shal yéede.
They by and by vnto the walles do fliynge with fliynge spéede.
Thassemblie then, and counsels there begun the kinge forsakes, And with vnwilling mind them to another tyme betakes.
Then much himself he blames, that neuer by his owne accord, He sentfor to the town, and termed sunne the Troian lord.
Some trenches cast before the gates, some pyles aloft do rayse Of wood or stone, alarme the trompets call to bloddy frayes.
Anon with sundrie troupes, they compas rownd about the wall The matrones with their laddes, for daunger calles to labour all.
Nolesse vnto the sacred church of Pallas goddesse strait The Quéeene is born, a beuie braue of dames on her do wait.
Great giftes she bare, and next her side Lauinia bright of hue,
The cause of all the strife, and downe to ground her eyes she threwe.
In thronge the Ladies thick, the church with incense soote doth smoke, And from their loftie thrones, with wofull voices thus they spoke.
thou that only art of warres, Tritonia virgin, cheife, Do breake the weapons with thy hand of this proud Troyan theife.
And strike him dead to grou~d before our gates that workes our greife.
Kinge Turnus raginge then of striues forth to the field is prest.
His braue Rutilian armour now was buckled to his brest, With brasen scales right rough, his thies with plates of gold were clad, His head was yet vnarmd, his sword tide to his side he had.
All glittringe bright he shynes, and from the pallaice forth he goes Triumphinge in his mind, and whole in hope hath foyld his foes.
Lyke as a noble horse that from the stable is start away, And frée doth raunge about, in open fieldes, and pastures gay, To others leaze, and heardes of mares doth headlonge runninge dash, Or hies him hastly to some woonted streame himself to wash.
His mane then vp he liftes aloft, and wanton runnes his way.
The crispinge curlinge lockes vpon his neck, and shoulders play.
With whom Camilla méetinge there with gward of Volscan rout:
Against him comes, then there the Quéene her self the gates without Down lightes, of whom did all the armed troupe example take, And softly from their horse they leapt, and thus to him she spake.
If noble hartes may eny hope repose in valient handes: Turnus, both dare and vowe to méete the Troyan bandes.
And with the Tyrrhen horsmen eke encounter on the way.
Let me the onset giue of formest fight this present day.
Stil stay you heare on foote, and manfully the walles defend.
Hereat then Turnus on the virgin fierce his eyes doth bend.
virgin flower of Latium land, what thankes to yéeld to thée, Or kyndnes to requite shall deuise may worthy bée? But since thy valient hart doth all aduentures great excéede: am well pleasd (O Quéene) to part this payne with thée indéede.
Aeneas, as fame telles, and skoutes sentforth for that entent, Before him well arayd his troupes of horsmenlight hath sent, That ransack shuld the fieldes, him self through craggie hilles on hie, And desertes deape, in hast vnto the town approcheth nie.
In secret Ambush I, in yonder wood, in place not wyde, That so both waies may besiedge, myself entend to hyde.
Do thou vpon the Tyrrhen horsmen set with ioyned band.
With thée shal sharpe Messapus yéede, and troupes of Latine land, And stronge Tiburtus power, and take to thée the charge of all.
He sayd, and with lyke wordes Messapus forth to fight doth call.
Him with his captaynes al alike exhortes against their foes, And forth him self anon before them all with courage goes.
There lies a vally low with crooked turnes a craftye place, And fit for sleightes of war, whom thickets black on ech syde trace.
The sides do narow shut, a lytle path therto doth lye, And passadge passinge streight, on ragged cragged entrance hie.
This plaine lyes quite vnknown, and corners saulf to lurck within, Whether on the lifthand, or the right the battayle you begin, Or on the Hill you list to stand, and storme of stones down cast.
By rediest way in coast well known, doth Turnus thither hast, And quickly takes the place, and in thick woods him self he hides.
Therwhiles Diana faier in loftye skies aboue that bides: Dame Opis swift to her doth call, a chast and fellow mayd, And one of her vntouched troupe, and thus to her she sayd With heauie chéere, virgin pure, Camilla forth doth pas Vnto a bloody warre, armd with our tooles in vaine, alas.
Whom do loue aboue the rest, ne to Diana new This likinge lately sprang, nor ioy in mind on sodeyn grew.
Pulst out through spite from natiue realme, and subiectes hauty might, When Metabus from old Priuerna town did take his flight:
mate in exile sharpe, and her by mothers name did call, And of Casmilla her by shorter name Camilla hight.
Her in his armes he bare when through the desert toppes, his flight Of wast forlorn hilles he tooke, and dartes about him flew, And him one euery syde, thick troupes of Volscans did pursue.
When loe, in midst of flight Amasenus with water store Aboue his bankes brakeout, such plentie rayne not longe before There fel, wherouer whilst anon to swim he doth assay: He feares (alas) his burden déere, pure loue doth cause him stay.
Then musinge much in mind at last this practyse best he thaught.
mightie speare which into hand that tyme by chance he caught, When as he fought, of knottye wood shaptforth, and Oke fulstout, To this his doughter déere in barke of trée encloasd about
He bindes, and fitly to the middes of mightie speare he ties, And shakinge it oft in his valient hand, thus loud he cries.
Diana bright, and virgin pure that in these woods dost bide, vowe a seruant here to thée, that bound vnto her side Most humblie holding fast a speare, flies from her foes, receaue Her (goddesse) to thy charge, whom here in doubtfull case leaue.
He said, and strait with bended arme the weapon forth he throwes, The waters sound, aloft the riuer swift, Camilla flowes.
Then Metabus when now the prease began approch him nie: The riuer strait he takes, his speare, and babe, therwith doth wrie, Out of a gréengrasse turfe, a gift that great Diana sent.
No people house for harbour him, nor walled cities lent, Nor if they eny offred had, he neuer would consent.
shéepheardes life amonge the sole, and sauage hilles he led.
His tendre child in thickest thornes, and beddes of beastes he fed With milke of mares vnmild, and suck of breastes were neuer caught, And to her tendre lippes in milkinge, downe their speanes he raught.
But when her pretie foote she first began to set to ground: Her handes, and euerie place with sharpned dartes he laded round.
quiuer on her shoulders smale he hanges with crooked bow.
In steade of golden caulle, and mantel braue shuld hange below: Tygers skinne downe from her head alonge her back doth fall, With lytle childish dartes her handes he armes to play with all.
Or by a twisted thonge about her head she whirles a slinge, Wherwith sumtime a Crane, sumtime a Swan she downe doth bringe.
Her many noble dames through Tyrrhen townes wheras she went: Haue wisht in vaine, their doughterlawe she were, but she content Alone with chast Dianas grace: her self preserueth still Vntwight vnto her tooles, and to maydes life beares best goodwill.
Wold god she had with no such fond desier of warre bin cought, When first the valient Troyans to prouoke in fight she sought, Whom do tendre much, and yet she here remaind with mée.
Now her with destnies sharpe, and fatall fall opprest sée.
Descend, déere Nimphe, from heauen, and Latine fieldes go visite streit, Wheras with haplesse hap, and blooddie broile this fray they feight.
Take these, and from this quiuer, shaftes of sharp reuenge addresse, And whosoeuer her sacred corps with wound shall once oppresse, Where he of Troy or Latium be, his blood shall that repay.
Then in an hollow cloud anon her wofull corps away, And armour vndefilde, vnto her natiue soyle will beare, And in a worthye sepulcher my self interre her there.
She said, the~ through ye flickringe aier with winges she downward slides, And giues a rush, and with a tempest black her bodie hides.
Therwhiles the Troyan bandes vnto the walles approched nye. Hetruscan capteynes with theyr troupes of horsmen, by and bye Them selues bestow in good aray, the palfries stamping fret Throughout the field, and rain with sturdie bittes forth softly iet Now here now there, the field rough sta~des with many a pyke and latice, And from their loftie helmets far the glittringe Sunbeames glaunce.
On totherside Messapus sharpe, and Latines fierce to fight, And Coras with his brother, and Camillas winge so bright Standforth agaynst them in the field, and launces fast they make Within their restes, and pointes of tre~blinge speares fast charged shake.
Their foes abode, and noyse of stéedes them sore on fier do set.
But when both armies were at cast of dart togither met: There still awhyle they stayd, a shrichinge shout they sodeyn raise, Their chaumpinge horse they harten forth, the dartes flie euery waies Lyke snow that thick doth fall, black shade the heauen quite ouerlaies.
And first with spitefull speares, Tyrrhenus with Acontius tall Encountringe fiercely méet, and first with mightie noise do fall To ground, the stéedes echothers breast with breast doth squéezinge iolt.
Acontius there vnhorst as swift as thickest thundrebolt, Or lyke some stone by engine great of war forthflunge downe lightes, And into thinne and flickringe aier exhales his vitall sprites.
Incontinent the rankes are broke, and Latines put to flight: Cast back their shieldes, and headlonge horses prick to citie right.
The Troyans then, and first silas sharpe the routes pursue, And now to gates they néere were come, the Latines then anew mighty noyse extoll, and horses neckes about they wrie.
The Troyans turne their backes, and largely yéeldinge raynes, do flie.
Lyke as the sea with altringe course that forth doth running freat: Somtime doth flow to shoare, rockes with rouling waues doth weat, And fominge on the sand and beach, alonge doth tumblinge glide.
Somtime doth swiftly ebbe, when force doth fayle, and back doth slide From rockes and shoares with vailinge streame, and failinge flud it falles.
The Tyrrhens twise the Rutils chase in fight vnto the walles,
And twise repulst looke backe, and backes with burklars broad defend.
But when they to the fight a fresh and third assault descend: The rankes together run, and man to man doth stifly sticke.
Then shoutes are heard of such as fall, and in the bloud waxt thicke Bot men and armour déepely waultryng fall, and stéedes half dead.
The battell growes, when Orsiloch sir Remulus did dread Himself to set vpon: into his horse a speare he thrust, And vnderneath the coursers eare the head leaues stickyng iust.
Then vp the stéede enraged standes on ende, and vp doth throw His legges with breast erect, nor in no wise coulde bide the blow.
He falles vnhorst to ground, Catillus driues to earth down right Iolas stout of minde, of stature eke a goodly knight.
And great in armes Herminius hard, whose head with golden heare Lies bare with shoulders bare, nor of his woundes doth stande in feare, So great in armes he lies, ye speare prickt through his shoulders quakes, And twise throughgirt his backe, his deadly payne twise double makes.
Goare bloud on euery side is shed, by fight are numbres stayne.
And by their woundes they séeke a glorious death for to obtayne.
And now this manly Amazon in slaughter much doth ioy
In midst of fight, whose pap, least vse of warre should her anoy:
Her tender shaftes about she shootes in quiuer which she beares.
Sometime her sharpned are vnwearied takes into her hand, Sometime her guilden bow, the tooles of chast Dianas band.
And if perchaunce repulst, she doo retyre pursued in chace: Her bowe she turnes behinde, and strikes her followers in the face.
About her chosen mates do ride, Larina, and Tulla bright Pure virgins, with Tarpeia that with glittryng axe doth fight, Italian trulles, and chast Camilla of speciall purpose those For honours sake, for time of peace, for trustie seruice chose.
Like as Amazones of Thracie lande when waters thay Of Thermodoon beat, with armour painted passyng gay, About Hyppolyta their Quéene, or when the virgin stout Penthesilea home in charret comes, the femell rout With shritches shrill reioysing cries, and shieldes like moones cut out.
Whom dost thou first, whom last, virgin fierce, by force down throw? Or O, how many corpses slayne on grounde dost lay full low? Eumenius first of Clytius father borne, whose naked best
Against her there that stode with launce of firstrée through doth threst.
He fluddes of blood out spuinge, falles, and earth with téeth doth teare, And where he fell vpon his wound, lies tumblinge diynge there.
Next on him Lyris she, and Pegase throwes, and Lyris while His bridell raignes he raught: from horse to ground he doth requile.
But Pegase whilst he came to aid, and féeble hand forth held: Both ioyntly headlong wise with dubled fall to ground she feld.
And couchinge downe vnto her speare from far doth fetch her run At Terreus, and Harpalicus, and Demophoon stout, And Cronius stronge, and many a capteyn more of Troian rout.
And looke how many shiueringe shaftes forth from her side she drew: So many carcases to ground of Troyan knightes she threw.
There Ornitus a farre in armour straunge, and hunterwise, Vpon a proud Apulian stéede about the batteyll flies.
Whose neck, and shoulders broad an hyde late hald from Oxes back Did couer, on his head the large wide gapinge iawes there stack Of wolf, with threatninge, grinninge, glittringe gréedy téeth full white.
clounish club in hand he weld, he thronges in thickst of fight, In stature all the rest by heyght of head he doth excéede.
Him she (nor was it when their foes retierd a glorious déede) Strykes through, thus she speakes with hatefull hart as there she stoode.
Thoughtst that some beast in chace thou, Tyrrhen, hadst within a wood? The day is come when as a womans armour shall refute Your boastinge bragges, yet no small fame to this thou mayst impute, That by these handes thou diest, and with Camillas launce art slayne.
Orsilochus, and Butes next, two bodies mightie mayne Of Troian rout, but Butes her agaynst with dart she strake, And forth a way betwixt his gorget, and his helmet brake About his neck that glittringe shynes, his shield hanges downe his side, And feyninge from Orsilochus as though she fled, doth ride The Carrire round, and craftely she kéepes the middle place, And whilst he her pursues, therwhiles she followeth him in chace, And through his armour stronge, the flesh, and bones, and axe she beates Highrisinge at her blowe, and whilst he twatlinge much entreates: She dubleth still the wound, with warm braynes his face he weates.
Herewith come in, and at first sight astunned much he standes Sir Aunus sunne of Appenine, a martiall man of handes,
When he percéeud from fight he could no wise escape away: By treacherous trayne he thought, and gloasinge guile her to assay, And thus began.
woman thou if to a trustie stéede Thy self commit, of truth is it a great or valient déede? Forsake thy horse, and match on ground thy self to me betake, And vnto equall fight on foote thée quickly ready make.
Then shalt thou know to whom this glory fond due prayse shall bringe.
He said, but she enraagd whom griefe with sharp desier did stinge: Vnto a mate her stéede she tooke, in armes on ground she standes With blade on foote forth drawne, and bucklar pure fast hent in handes.
The younker then supposinge that by craft he her had quit: Away strait swiftly prickinge flies, not lingringe neuer a whit: His nimble stéede with raignes he quickly turnes, and thence him hies.
His peartly prauncinge beast with iron spurres apace he plies.
Ligur vayne, and to no purpose bragge, and proud of hart.
In vaine sir subtile, thou assayest to trie thy cuntreyes art.
No slypprie shift shall thée aliue to craftie Aunus saue.
These wordes the virgin spake, and fierce on foote a springe she gaue, And swiftlye soone outran the horse, and fast the raignes she raught And at him strake, and glad on enmies blood reuenge she wraught.
Much lyke a that from lostie towre his flight doth take, And at a twigginge doue vnto the cloudes swyft winge doth make.
When her at souse hath tane with talantes sharpe her guttes pulles out, The goarie bludde, and fethers plumed flit the ayer about.
These thinges the father of gods and men in heauen that sits on hie: Doth héedfully behold, and warly weighes with watchinge eie.
Then Tyrrhen Tarchon stout to entre fight he did prouoke, And with no gentle rage of frantike anger forth him stroke.
Wherfore in thickst of slaughters great, and rankes enforst to flie, On horsback Tarchon thronges, and sundrie voyces liftes on hie.
The winges he hartneth on, and ech man by his name doth call.
And such as were repulst, he makes a fresh to fightinge fall.
What feare is this: that neuer will repent your foolish flight, Tyrrhens dastardes still? what dau~t within your hartes doth light? woman straglinge you pursues, and doth discomfit quight.
Vnto what end these swordes, or weapons do you beare in hand?
Not so at Venus games, nor warres by night you lingringe stand.
Nor when god Bacchus crooked pipe to dauncinge you doth call, And vnto costly cates, and tables lade with wyne to fall.
That is your ioy, that your delight, when as the prophet good With sacrafice, and fatted ost, doth call you to the wood.
This said, into the thickest foes himself forth thronginge flinges, And mad he méetes with Venulus, whom chaunce against him bringes.
There raught from of the horse with his righthand he held his foe, And forceblye him wringinge to his breast, away doth goe.
noyse vnto the heauen they rayse, the Latines turn their eies Vpon this fact, and Tarchon swift about the field he flies, Both bearinge man and armour still away, and from his speare The head he wrested of, and euery place he searcheth, wheare deadlie wound he may bestowe, he wrestlinge do~th rebell To saue the sword from out his throat, and force by force repell.
And as the noble Egle which in the aier aloft doth flie, When vp a snake hath snatcht that late a sleape on ground did lie, And fastned him within his foote, and claspt with talantes round: The snake about him wriglinge windinge wreades with griefe of wou~d, And scales doth roughly rayse, and angred with her mouth doth hisse.
With crooked beake he wrestlinge nippes her neuerthelesse for this, And forth his way he flies, and with his winges the aier doth beat: None otherwise his pray from Tyburt oste sir Tarchon great Triumphinge beares away, their captaynes dede, and happy chaunce The Lydians followinge forth do run.
Comes in whom Aruns due to death by craftye sleight full slie: Doth ride about, the esiest syde for his behoofe to trie.
And looke through thickest rankes wheras the virgin fiercely flew: Sis Aruns thither hies, and secretly her steppes doth view.
What way she conqueresse doth returne, and foote from foes doth bend: That way the youth by stealth his nimble reignes about doth wend.
And now thisway, now that agayne, and round about the place With fatall, certayne, speare in hand, doth followinge after trace.
By chaunce vnto Cybele sacred priest, sir Chloreus hight, From far aboue the rest in Phrygian armes did shyne full bright.
fominge courser forth he prickt, whose breast, and buttokes wide skinne beset with brasen plates, and glittringe gold did hide.
Himself in purple sad, and scarlet pure full fine beséene,
In Lycian bow his shaftes he shot, in Creta made that béene.
His golden bow from shoulder twanges, a guilden helme he beares.
The yelowish silken weed, and bosoums wyde with bouges he weares: Those lappets ratling large in knot of costly gold were tyde.
His coate with néedle embroidred was, his sturdie thies did hyde skirt of purple silke and gold in foreyn cuntrey wrought.
The virgin him, for cause his armour braue wherin he fought, And Troyan spoiles on temples hange she would for honours sake, Or els herself in huntresse wise, with gold full braue would make: With blind desier pursues, and all encenst through thickest rout, With greadie womans lust of spoiles, she flies the field about.
When Aruns longe in wait that lay, had fit occasion spied: whirlinge dart he threw, and thus vnto the gods he cried.
Most mighty god Apollo guyde of drad Soractis hill, Whom we aboue the rest adore, to whom soote smellinge still Of Pinetrees hugie flames we féede, and through whose only might Thy seruauntes dare to walke on fierie coales hot burninge bright.
father graunt that by our tooles this shame be tane away, Almightye since thou art, not for the virgins spoyles pray, Nor monument séeke, nor pillage proud from her to take.
Some other déede hereafter this shall me right famous make.
But let this cruell plague faldowne with dint of this righthand, And deuoid of fame will hence return to natiue land.
Apollo heard his prayer, and part to graunt he was content, And part to be disperst in flickringe aier abroad he sent.
That Quéene Camilla fierce with deadly wound downestayn shuld bée, He graunted, but with saufe return his natiue soyle to sée: He did not graunt, that voice he bid the windes abroad confound.
Then when the whirlinge dart forth throwne in ayer had raisd a sound: Both armies gan attend, and eies vnto the Volscan Quéene They all do cast, she mindes no whit the thinges the~ wrought that béene, Nor ayer, nor yet the sound, nor dart aboue full wift of flight,
Till vnderneath her sacred pap the fatall launce doth light, And deaply entringe in: at full in virgins blood doth bayne.
Her fearfull femall guard togither runnes, and doth sustayne Their faintinge ladies corps, fast Aruns flies before them all, Whom as did ioy refresh: so feare admixt did much appall.
And now he dares nomore vnto her launce himself to truft,
Nor yet into the sight of that Virago himself to thrust.
And lyke a woolfe, before the hatefull hunters him do chace, Vnto the wast for lorne hilles forth hies himselfe a pace, When he some heardsman hath, or heckfer great of grease, and lim Deuourd, and guiltie in hart of that foule fact, and deede full grim: His tremblinge tayle betwéen his legges lets fall, and wooddes doth séeke: Sir Aruns so him out of sight withdrawes in semblant leeke, And with his flight content amidst the thickst him self doth hyde.
She diyng drawes the dart that in the wound did déepe abyde, The mortall blade in wound full wide stickes fast within her syde.
Shée faintes for want of blood, her eies to death yéeld vp their due.
Strait from her face departes the stayned chéekes, and purple hue.
And dyinge thus to Acca, one of her companions saies, virgin to Camilla true before the rest alwaies, With whom she woonted was her cares and sorowes all impart, And thus to her began to speake with failinge faintinge hart.
Vntill this tyme, sister Acca deare, of force was, Acruell mortall wound my life abbridges now, alas, And althinges round, me séemes, looke rustie dustie dark as hell.
Flie hence, and do with spéed, my messedge last to Turnus tell, That he to batteyle come, and kéepe the Troyans from the towne.
And now farewell, and with that word the raignes she let fall downe.
Her self to earth not willinge sinkes, and waxinge cold, vntwynes
By smale and smale herself out of her corps, and then resignes Her lithie head and neck to death, and armour doth forsake.
Her ghost flies fast with greife and great disdaine to Lymbo lake.
Forthwith a mighty noyse the golden starres in heauen doth touch, And since Camillas death the battle fierce encreaseth much.
They thicke come ranning on, both all the bandes of Troyans stout, And Tyrrhen captaines, with Euanders winges th' Archadian rout.
And now Dianas dearlinge bright, Nimph Opis sits on hie Vpon the toppe of loftiest hilles, the batteile to descrie.
And when from farre she sawe in raginge noise of youthfull trayne, With wound vnworthie, and wofull dolefull death Camilla slayne: She fet a sigh, and deepe from out her breast these wordes she said.
To deare virgin, thou to deare a cruell price hast paied, That thou the valient Troyans durstes prouoke in open fight.
That thou Dianas grace in wooddes didst serue forsaken quight:
It nothinge thée auailes, or that our quiuer thou didst weare, Or glittringe golden bowe vpon thy tendre shoulders beare.
Howbeit thy noble Quéene meanes not to leaue thee voie of fame, Nor that thy drierie death shall couered sleape for lack of name.
Thy corps that did defile with mortall wound, what euer were he: With death deséeurd shalbe requit.
Beneath on hill full hie, The tumbe of old Dercennus kinge raisd vp a loft doth lie, With mightie mount of auntient Laurent ground, an Ilex trée With glummish darkish shade bespreddes the same, that none may sée.
Here first this goddesse faier, with passinge speadie course doth light.
And from this hillock farre sir Aruns aimes within her sight.
Whom when she glittringe sawe in armes, and vainlie puft with pride: Why fliest thou hence ({quod} she) approch, and here thy steppes do guide.
Come néere that now must die, and due desart receaue agayne For Quéene Camillas death, and with Dianas shaftes yslayne, So vile a wight so worthy a death for fact so foule must bide? She said, and strait in Thracian huntreswise, from by her side golden flight forth of her quiuer pluckes, and bow she bendes, And drawes him deape vntill the nockes méete iust at both the endes, And handes do equall leuell stand, and arowehead doth twight The bowhand, and the stringe vp to her eare she drawes vp quight.
Sir Aruns heard at once, and shaft fast in his body stack.
Him yéeldinge vp the ghost, and fetchinge deape his finall grone: His mates forgetfull in the field abroad do leaue a lone.
And Opis strait with winges to loftie heauen doth take her flight.
First at their ladies death do flie Camillas horsmen light,
And captaines all are quaild, and standardbearers forst in chace: For rescue runne, and to the town do fast on horseback hie.
None dare the Troians stout, that followinge after fast do flie, With setled foote withstand, nor yet in warlyke armes resist, But bowes vnbent on shiueringe shoulders beare with faintinge first, And coursers with their hooues the rotten dustie fieldes do shake.
Vnto the walles and whirlwind black with tumblinge dust doth rake.
And matrones tootinge out ye loopes their breastes there beate straitwaies And forth a womans shritch vp to the starres in heauen they rayse.
There those that first into the open gates most swiftly prest:
The mingled enmies power in thickest routes did them molest.
Nor wofull death they do escape, but at first entrance in, And euen within their citie walles, and when as housd they hin: Throughgirt with speares are sleyne, some shut the gates, and do debar Frée entrance to their mates, nor dare for life the same vnspar,
Amongst defendauntes falles, and such in armes as yéeld their breath.
Such as were shut without before their parentes wéepinge eyes, When cruell force constraines, some headlonge into ditches flies.
Some blinded with the dust, and giuinge spurre, and yéeldinge raigne: Against the gates, and rampiers hard of poastes do runne amaine.
The matrones from the walles when they beheld Camilla dead, Their tremblinge dartes cast forth (for so their cuntrie loue them lead) And staues of oke ystéeld, and poales of length forebrent at end, And dare the dread of death assay, whilst they their walles defend.
Therwhiles within the woddes, an heauie messedge Turnus frayes, And to that valient youth a tumult great doth Acca raise.
That Volscans vanquisht are, and fierce Camilla sleine in fight, And enmies fast approchinge come, and all in batteile quight Haue ouerthrowne, that feare vnto the citie walles doth goe.
He then enraagd (for why the power of Ioue would haue it soe) The hilles possest of late, and thickets sharpe doth strait forsake.
Who scarce was now come forth, and large abroad the field did take: When lord Aeneas to the forest wide himself doth spéede, And hilles doth ouertrace, and from thick wooddes doth forth procéede.
So both vnto the walles in hast with all their power do flie, And both the marchinge troupes not manie paces distant lie.
But when the smoakinge fieldes with dust Aeneas did behold, And marchinge bandes in batteyle ray of town Laurentum old: And Turnus did from farre Aeneas irefull countnance view, And tramplinge of their féete, and neighinge of their horses knew: Immediatly they had their armies ioynd, and batteyle tried, Had not sir Phoebus bright with purple mantell brauely died His horses dipt in seas, and bringinge night: expulst the day.
They pitch their tentes before the towne, and trenches deape do lay.
When the Latines were vanquished, Turnus seyng all his help to be reposed in him self, contrary to the perswasion of Latinus, and the Queenes manifolde teares: determineth to fight hande to hande with Aeneas, and sendeth suche worde vnto him by Idmon his messenger.
Aeneas is therwith pleased, and with solemne othes on both sides they make the league, which Iuturna through perswasion of Iuno in the shape of Camertes, disturbeth.
First of all, Tolumnius the southsayer, yt by a false shew proficied victory to his side: striketh through with a dart one of Gilippus sunnes.
Aeneas likewise, seckyng meanes to appease the tumult: is wounded by an arow vncerten by whom it was shot, and is constrayned to leaue the battell.
Which Turnus vnderstandyng, supposing he had gotten a great occasion of good successe: maketh greate slaughter on his foes.
Aeneas, amended: co~meth agayne forth, and rescueth his mates, and namely calleth for Turnus in fight.
But Turnus still withdrawynge him self (for Iuturna his sister, in shape of Metiscus the wagoner, cariyng him alwayes aside would not suffre him mecte with Aeneas in battle) he determineth to besiedge the towne, and Ieadyng his amny nere to the walles casteth fier vp to the Turrets, and houses.
Then Amata supposing that Turnus was slayne: through extreame sorow hangeth her self.
These thynges beyng tolde vnto Turnus by sages seyng that he must needes fight, or suffer his confederate towne come into his enemies hands before his face: voluntarely prouoketh Aeneas to the combat according to the tenure of the league.
In which fight Aeneas hauyng the victory, and beynge almost mooued to take compassion, and graunt life to his enemie: yet when he saw the gyrdle vpon his shoulder whiche he had taken from Pallas, whom he had slayne before, sodenly mooued with anger: thrusteth him to the hart.
WIth daunted force, fight vnlucky late, when quaild to bée His Latines stout of yore, most valient Turnus prince did see, Himself a marke to ech mans eies: outragious gan to boyle, And rise in rage, much like a Lyon fierce of Affricke soyle, Whose breast, when as with dint of hunters speare is wounded déepe: He then prepares himself to fight, and curled lockes doth kéepe
Crect with rage vpon his neck, the slickinge launce with pawes Of hunters, bold he breakes, and fominge frettes with bloddie iawes.
Noneotherwise the rage of furious Turnus forth doth breake, And to Latinus kinge with troubled mind he thus doth speake.
In Turnus is no stay, why dastard Troians should forsake Their word there is no cause, nor yet the bargayne they did make.
le match him sure, bringe sacrafice, our league come vnderstand.
Ether the Dardan lord will send to hell with this righthand: runaway from Asia land, let Latines kéepe them still, And countries common shame with sword alone cut of will: Or quite he vs shall ouerthrow, and wife Lauinia haue.
To whom with sober moode Latinus than this answere gaue.
most couragious youth, how much the more thou dost excéede In valient harte: so much the more tis méete shuld indéede Giue graue aduise, and charely for chaunces all prouide.
Thou hast thy father Daunus realmes, and many a towne beside Wunne with thine hand, Latinus welth, and courage hath likewyes.
In Latium land and in Laurentum soyle right large that lies: Are many moe vnmaried dames, and not of basest line.
Now giue mée leaue the trueth in open wordes for to vntwyne.
And print it deape in mind what herof to thée shall showe.
On eny of her auntient loues my doughter to bestowe was forbid, so all the goddes and men to mée haue told.
Bold yet for loue of thée, and for our kindredsake as bold, And for our heauie spouses teares: all promise made brake, And from my sunne his wife, my self to wicked armes haue take.
Since which tyme, Turnus, thou hast séene, what chauncee did eusue, What warres, what paynes to thée as chéefe amongst the rest there grue, Twise ouerthrowne in batteils greate scarce in the towne can kéepe The hope of all Italia land, and Tybers channell déepe Yet with our blood doth warmed ru~ne, and fieldes with benes looke white.
where turne so ofte? what madnes moues my mind so light? If Turnus die, and strayt for them as for my péeres send: Why rather do not whilst he doth liue this quarrell end? What will my cosins Rutils say, what all Italia land If thée to death shuld betraye (which chaunce the goddes with stand) Which dost our doughter craue, to ioyne with vs in wedlocke land, Reguard the doubtfull happes of warre, and do some pytie take
Vpon thine auntient sier, whom wofull warres do carefull make, And Ardea countrey deare, full far from hence doth now disioyne.
But Turnus all these words cannot perswade his rage resigne, Which euer waxeth more, and still in healing doth augment.
And when he once coulde speake, these words from out his mouth he sent.
father deare, this care which you in my behalfe do take: For me do lay aside, nor be so carefull for my sake.
And suffer me in stéede of prayse a famous death obtayne.
For wée our darts do throw, and swordes do draw not still in vayne.
And strength in hands wée haue, from our woundes bloud runneth red.
Far shall his mother be, that flying him with cloud shall spred, And in vayne flickeryng shade withdraw her self soone out of sight But now the Quéene at nouell guise of battle much affright: Did wéepe, and like to die, her sonne in law in armes she hent.
Turnus, by these teares of mine, or euer if thou were bent Amatas honour to preserue (for hope of elder yeares Thou art, and rest alone, and honour only which vpbeares The state of Latine realme, our shakned house on thée doth lie) Graunt me this onely thing, do not with Troyans battell trie.
For whatsoeuer chaunce thou in this battell dost sustaine: Turnus sustaine the same, and lothsome life refraine Therwith am determd, for sunne in law Aeneas sée, neuer shall abide, and mée my self a captiue bée.
Lauinia then with teares her mothers talke did vnderstande, With burnyng blusshyng chéekes, whom couler much had out of hand Inflamd with heate, which vp into her face foorthwith did spred.
Like as when Iuery white by chaunce is staynd with scarlet red, Or purple roses pure with Lilies white lie mixt in place: Such was the virgins hue, such were the coulers in her face.
Him loue disturbeth much, and on the mayde his eyes he staies, And burnes to battell more, and to Amata shortly saies, mother, do not now with wofull teares me thus pursue.
Ne giue me cause hereby to dread that lucke shall light ascue.
Tis not in Turnus power, if destnies will, his death to fly.
Go Idmon, tell the Phrygian kyng this messedge by and by Which will not please him well, when first tomorow in welkin bright, In purple charret drawen the mornyng cleare shall rise in sight: His Troyans foorth he do not lead agaynst the Rutil bandes.
The Troyans still do hold, and Rutils eke their blades in handes.
In that same fight with our two blood shall ended be the stryfe, And in that field be tride, who shall Lauinia wed to wyfe.
When he these wordes had said, and hied him into house apace: He calles for stéedes, and ioyes to sée them fome before his face.
The kéepers quick there stand about, and them with handes prouoke, With soundinge blowes on breast, and curled manes wt co~bes do stroke.
Anon his gorget gay with gold and siluer damaskt bright, And scarlet worke ywrought, vpon his shoulders fitteth tight.
His sword and targat next, and ruddie plumes of feathers braue.
The sword which vnto Daunus old sumtime god Vulcan gaue, And fierie flaminge hot in lake of Stix did deapely quent.
Then strait a mightie speare, that to an hugie pillar lent Erect amid the house, with valient force in hand he tooke, Sir Actor of Aruncans spoile, and fiercely foorth it shooke Thus criynge out, speare, whom neuer yet cauld in vaine, The time is come when thou with mée this brunt must néedes sustaine.
Thée mightie Actors hand somtime, but now doth Turnus hold.
And with a valient hand from of his neck his gorget teare Of that some Cocknie Phrygian knight, and drench in dust his heare, And lockes with bodkins frisled fine, and moyst with Mirrhe, and oyles.
These furies forth him prick, and from his face with rage that boyles The sparckles sprinclinge flie, and eyes with flaminge fier do glow.
Lyke as mightie Bull sendes forth his voice, and loud doth low, When first he comes to fight, and proues his hornes in rage to whet.
And spiynge farre a trée, himself therto doth cloasly set, And rough with stroakes prouokes the wind, and grauell flinges about.
Nolesse therwhiles in mothers armour stronge Aeneas stout, Himself to warre prepares, and sharpneth vp himself with ire.
And ioyes the warre with league so ended is, his great desier.
Then next his mates, and to Iulus griefe doth comfort bringe, Instructinge them in destnies all, and legates to the kinge He biddes with certain answere to return, and to declare The whole conditions of the league, what they in ordre are.
The next day risinge had the hilles with light scarce ouer spred,
When first sir Phoebus horse forth of the sea did lift their hed, And from their loftie nostrelles wide did blow the broad daylight: When strait before the citie walles they measure for the fight An equall plaine, both Rutilmen, and Troyans mixt a vie.
And fiers in midst they make, and altars large they build on hie, Of earthen turues yframd, vnto th'indiffrent gods to stand.
And fast some water fetch, some cracklinge fier bringe in their hand, In surplice white of linen clad, and temples compast round With wreath of Veruine soote, and holly herbes togither bound.
The Latine armie issueth forth, and bandes with dartes that fight In clusters thick to gates do thronge, and Troyans armie bright, With Tyrrhens armd in sundrie sort, with speed they forth do flie: Nonotherwise in armour prest, then if that by and by They shuld to battayll fierce descend, and thick in thousandes told The captaynes scour about, in scarlet braue, and glittringe gold: The ofspringe of Assaracus, Mnestheus, Asylas wilde, Messapus eke a tamer stout of stéedes, Neptunus childe.
And when at certeyn signe into their place they hie them all: Theyr pikes they pitch in grou~d, and downe their shieldes they let to fall.
The matrones then with great desire to sée, and rascall rout, And men vnweldie old: the turrets hie, and toppes about Of houses do bestride, and loftie ridge of gates do clim, And vp the walles they slyde, and couch them thick vpon the brim.
But Iuno from a loftie hill, that now Albanus hight, (For then it was deuoid of name, renowme, and glorie quight,) Lookt downe, and all the campe at length, and breadth she did behold.
And both the armies viewd, both Latines stout, and Troyans bold, And Laurent towne, and strayt to Turnus sister gan to speake, One Goddesse to another, that standinge lakes, and fluddes that creake Doth ouerrule.
This honour great, the kinge of heauen aboue For maydenhode bereft.
Thou knowest before all Latine ladies bright, how only thée, That to almightie Ioues ingreatefull bed ascended haue: do estéeme, and willingly a place in heauen gaue.
Now lerne thy griefe, and do not mée henceforth, Iuturna, blame.
So farre as fortune would permit, and destnies graunt the same: Both Latium state, and Turnus, and thy walles did defend.
But now the youth with partiall fates sée, in sight to wend.
Now fatall destnies day, and cruell force, at hand they bée, Ne may with mine eyes abide this fight, or league to sée.
Thou, if thou canst deuise some meanes, thy brother to aduaunce: Assay, perhaps in time poore wretches may haue better chaunce.
Scarce had she said, but strait Iuturna forth in teares then brake, And thrise or fouertymes her cumlie brest with fist she strake.
This is no tyme for teares ({quod} Iuno then) but make some spéede, And Turnus saue from death, if such meanes may be made, indéede.
And do them strait to warre prouoke, and breake the league they make.
Let mée be authour of the déede, this said: she did for sake Her doubtfull much, and troubled sore with wofull wound of mind.
Therwhiles the kinges Latinus with an hugie trayne assignd, In charret drawne with fouer horse rides, whose auntient temples round With glittringe beames of gold in numbre twelue about were bound, The Su~nes his grandsiers badge, in charret drawne wt two horse whight Forth Turnus comes, with launces twaine broad armd with iron bright.
On thother side Aeneas, founder first of Romane blood, With burninge bucklar bright, and heauenlie armour stronge and good, And next Ascanius younge, of mightie Rome the second hope) Forth of their tentes procéede, a priest beséene in purest cope, younglinge yelt of brestled sow, and twynlinge shéepe vntwight Bringes forth, and hales the beastes vnto the altars burninge bright.
They turninge then their faces forth vnto the risinge sunne: Do sprincle bran and salt about, the scissers round do runne About the temples of the beastes, and wyne on altars lay.
Then lord Aeneas with his fauchon bright forthdrawne: doth pray.
Beare witnesse of my prayer, Sunne, and thou Italia land, For whose alonly sake these trauayles great tooke in hand.
And thou almightie Ioue, and thou nolesse, Iuno bright, More gentle goddesse now trust, and Mars of warlyke might, Who as it séemes most best to thée, all maner warres dost guide.
You Springes and Riuers eke call, and what soeuer doth bide Relligious due to heauens aboue, or blueish sea belowe.
If that on Turnus happie luck the conquest do bestowe:
Tis méete that to Euanders towne we conquered goe agayne.
Iulus shall depart the realme, and from all warre refrayne The vanquisht Troians shall henceforth, nor armes herafter take,
Nor yet molest this land with warre, that they shall hap to make.
But if through force of armes to vs the conquest lotted bée, As so hope it shall, and Gods vs graunt the same to sée: neuer shall Italians force the Troyans to obey.
Nor do séeke to be their kinge, but this, that iointly they, Vnuanquisht nations may in euerlastinge league abide.
Myself will goddes, and reliques tende, Latinus warres shall guide, My father inlawe his woonted crowne shall weare, my mates, they shall Build vp a towne for mée, and by Lauinias name it cal.
His eyes to heauen he castes, and both handes to the starres doth hold.
Aeneas, by the same both land, and sea, and starres sweare,
And power of goddes infernall grimme, and cruell Plutoes seates.
Let Ioue heare that, that breakers false of leagues with thundre beates.
touch the altars here, and fiers that stand before vs all, And all the heauenlie powers, herof for recorde do call: No day shall once this peace disturbe, or concord frustrate make, Howeuer the case do fall, nor cause mee willinge it forsake.
Not though the land into the sea he threw, and drencht vs all, Or shuld enforce the loftie heauen in Lymbo low to fall.
Like as this Mace (for in his hand by chaunce a mace he had) Gréene leafe shall neuer burgein more, nor spray, nor pleasaunt shad, Since first in wooddes it grew, and from the stock was cut away.
Now roote it lackes, the knife did cause both leafe, and braunch decay, Somtime a trée, howbeit the workmans hand, the same in gold Hath now incloasd, and geuen it to the Latine kinges to hold.
With suchlike wordes, amonge the~selues their leagues they stablish sure Amid the rout of all the lordes, the beastes then sacred pure, Within the flaminge fiers they slay, and from them spraulinge quicke: Their tremblinge entrayles take, and altars heape with launces thicke.
But now to Rutil crue this match right much vnméete doth séeme.
And now with waueringe mindes in sort perplext herof they déeme.
But cheifly when more neare their farre vnequall strength they view.
His secret walkinges forth augmentes the same, his eyes he threw
Vpon the ground whilst he in sacringe was, his heauie chéere,
His hollow chéekes, and palenesse in his face that doth appéere.
This talke when sad Iuturna saw, now more and more encrease,
The common peoples hartes now quailinge from this league to cease: Into the thickest thronges, and semblant of Camertes face, Whose stock right noble was of graundsiers old, and fathers race, And name with vertue fraught, himself in armes of valient might, Into the thickest rankes she comes, enformd of all aright, And sundrie rumours forth she blabbes, and bablinge thus doth say, Ist not shame, Rutils, thinges of such great waight to lay Vpon the lyfe of one? are not in numbre wée, or might Their matches? loe the Troyans all, and Archades in sight Here scand, the fatall armie, and Hetruria Turnus foe.
Scarce haue they man for man, if them against in fight we goe.
He to the goddes aboue before whose altars now he prayes: By flickringe fame shall flie, and liue in mouth of man alwayes, But wée with losse of natiue soyle, proud lordes for to obay Shalbe constraind, and lingringe now here in the fieldes we stay.
With suchlike wordes the souldiours mindes with rage she kindleth sore, And murmour great through out the field encreaseth more, and more.
The Laurent peoples mindes are changd, and Latines hartes likewise.
And those that late for truce from warre, and saulftie did deuise: Wish now for armes, couenantes all full faine would frustrate make, And on kinge Turnus ruthfull case compassion great do take.
To this a greater thinge Iuturna ioynes, from heauen on hie signe she downe doth send, that nothinge could be found, wherbie
Th' Italians mindes might more be mooud, or more with monsters guile.
For why, the bird of mightie Ioue aloft on winge did toyle Amid the ayer, and fierce a shole of foules she did pursue, And twigginge forth a pace fast on her flight the Egle flue.
When soodenly she stoopt downe to the streame, and sousinge feld noble Swan to ground, and gripinge fast in talantes held.
Th' Italians thick their mindes herat erect, then all the rout Of foules from flight with noyse returne (a straunge sight out of dout) And heauen with winges they do obscure, and thick a cloud they make, And on their foe they fiercely set, and round the ayer they shake.
And still so sore they him assault: till vanquisht with their might, For want of force he faintes, the pray out of his foote he quight Lets falle in to the streame, and away to skies doth take his flight.
This warninge of the goddes the Rutils then with shout accept, And strait their handes prepare to fight, and forth Tolumnius lept
prophet proud that was, and first this, this ({quod} he) and cries, Tis longe for which lookt, and with my self did deuise.
both acknowledge, and embrace the power of goddes, come all Rutils, and with mée your captayne strait to battayle fall.
Who~ this vile strau~ger wretch in warre like hartlesse byrdes doth feare, And all your shoare alonge with wofull sword, and fier doth teare: Anon shall flie apace, and to salt seas himself betake.
Do you with one consent your rankes strait thick in ordre make, And your forlorne kinge by warlyke prowes séeke to defend.
He said, and runninge forth his dart against his foes doth bend.
Forth flies the whistlinge Cornell dart, and ayer doth certen part.
Wherwith a clamour huge doth rise, the bandes with feare do start, And stout couragious hartes through tumult great wax fiery wood.
This whirlinge dart nine bodies fayer of brethren, where they stood Bychaunce direct against, (whom faithfull spouse, a Tuscan bred: Vnto Archadian, Gilippe bare of yore that her did wed) And one of them strake in the midst, whereas his belt did sit, And now away is torne, where fast the buckle holdes thonge in bit.
noble youth of beutie braue, in glittringe armour stronge, And smit him through the ribbes, and laid him downe the sand alonge.
Then strait the valient brothers band with greife accenst in ire: Some drawe their naked swordes, and some theyr sturdye darts require.
And forth they headlonge blyndly runne, and Laurent bandes anone On tother side do fast approch, and Troyans many an one In rankes right thick forth flowe, Agillini, and Archads braue, And all this only lust, to trie with dint of sword they haue.
The altars downe they driue, a tempest sore of wepons flies, troublous sturdie storme of iron and stéele obscures the skies.
The Latines strait snatch vp the Boules, and Censers burninge bright.
Latinus takes with goddes repulst and foiled league, his flight.
Some stéedes from charrets do discharge, and mount on horses hie, And with sharpe drawne swordes hent in hand forthwith do hast the~ nie. Messapus there, Aulestes kinge, that princely crowne did beare Of Tyrrhens all, that passinge greadye was the league to teare: With courser stout doth ouerthrowe, who yéeldinge back, doth fall, And (wretch) against the altars that behind him stoode withall Both head, and shoulders smites, Messapus fierce strait thither flies, And with his launce much like a beame whilst there Aulestes cries,
And suppliant sues for life: from loftie palfrey woundes him sore, And thus he speakes: That sure is thine, this sacrafice before The Gods of greater valew is, then that was slayne of yore.
Th' Italians thither ran, and spoyles from carcas pantyng raught.
Sir Chorineus a flamyng brond from of the aultar caught, And to Ebusus cumming fast, whilst he prepaard to fight: Into his face the bronde he forst, his huge beard brent a light, And swealed causd a stinke, he followeth still, and by the lockes With lefthand held his foe, whom roslyng and amazde, he knockes Against the ground, and with his knée constraynes him there to lie, And with his Fauchon strikes him in the side.
Then by and by Sir Alsus that a sheapheard was, and fierce in voward fought: With naked sworde in hand, fast followes Podalirius stoute, And large him lies vpon, whom Alsus with his sharpned axe Raughtbacke, fro~ brow to chinne wt sturdie stroke right cleauing packs.
Downe strait he falles, armour large with goarebloud doth embrue.
Vnto his eies doth bitter rest, and deadly sléepe ensue, With aie continuyng night, and neuer more the day to viewe.
But lorde Aeneas vp his righthand held vnarmed quite, With open head, and to his mates he cried withall his might.
Whether run you sirs? what discord great doth thus your minds inuade? stay your rage, the couenants all are drawne, and league is made.
And alonly lotted am Kyng Turnus to assay, Let mée therewith alone, and all your feare expell away.
With this righthand the league stablish shall, and firmely tie, For by this sacrafice is Turnus due to mée to die.
Amid this tale, and when these wordes scarce yet were spoke all:
Beholde a singyng shaft, with fluttryng feathers downe doth fall,
Vncerten by whose hand forth shot, or by what force forth throwne, Or what chau~ce Rutils prayse hath brought, or els what God, vnknowne The glorie of so worthie déede lies hid in secret still, And no man for Aeneas wound himself be praised will.
When Turnus saw forth of the fight Aeneas to depart, His captaynes much dismayd: with sode in hope doth fierce forthstart, For stéedes and tooles he calles, and proud by leapyng mountes on hie Into his charret swift, and with his handes the raygnes doth wrie.
Full many a worthy man to death forth flying mad doth send, And many he leaues fordead, some crusht with whéeles he bringes to end,
Or els in fight with dartes forth flunge doth strike them in the back.
Like as when blouddy Mars, in rage pricktforth doth make to crack The streames of Hebrus colde, and with his bucklar them doth tire, And now to battayle prest sendes forth his stéedes incenst with ire.
They in the open playnes more swift then winde, their way do take, And with their stampyng féete the vtmost coast of Thracia shake, And rounde about dame Dreads right dririe looke, and Angers face, With Treason ioyntly ioynd, the trayne of Mars, the lande do trace.
Such one then Turnus quicke in thickst of throngs, his smoaking stéedes Hotgoth, and (wofull case) at enmies death vauntes in his déedes.
The swift horshooue a blouddy dew about doth sprinkle rounde, And stampes the goary bloud like morter mixt with sandie grounde.
And now he Sthenelus throwes, and Thameris, and Phole to death, Him méetyng, and with him, him farre, farre both he réeues of breath.
Imbrasus sunnes Glaucus, and Lades, whom Imbrasus olde In Lycia fostred vp, and with like armour them did bolde, In fight at hande to trie, or flight on horse the windes to win.
On th'otherside Eumedes forth flies fast, thickst throngs within, Right noble Dolons impe, in feates of armes a doughtie knight, Like graundsier in his name, in hart and hand his father right.
Who once for that to Greekish tentes a spie he should be sent: Achilles charret craaud to haue for paynes in trauayle spent.
Howbeit Tytides gaue him other hire for ventred payne, Twas not his chaunce vnto Achilles horses to attayne.
Whom Turnus when from far in open field did once espie, When first him had pursued with dartes right light that fast did flie: His coupled horse he stayes, and from his charret downe descendes, And to him dead almost, and throwne to grounde he quickly tendes.
His foote on necke he sets, with righthand forth his blade he drew, And déepely died it in his throate, and forth these wordes he threw.
Loe here the fieldes, and which in warre proude Troian thou hast sought: Italia measure liyng now, such recompence is wrought To such as mée to war prouoke, so walles they do erect.
Next him he Brutes laies, at whom a launce he did direct.
Then Cloreus stoute of limme, Sibaris valient wight of hand, Daretus and Thersiloch fierce, that stiffe did him withstand.
Tymoetus eke that on his neck from coltish iade downe fell.
And as the northern Thracie wynde (in semblantwise to tell)
When forth it bloustringe blowes; and deape Aegeum sea doth raise, The billowes forth do roule, and to the shoare do take their wayes As whirlinge windes do driue, the cloudes flit fast in heauen on hie: So Turnus where he takes his course the thronges fast thence do flie, And headlonge troupes retire, a courage fierce him forth doth prick, The waueringe ayer his plumes beares back that in his creast do stick.
This peartnes Phegeus might not bide, nor pride of stomake bold.
But to his charret steppes, and some raignes in hand doth hold Of swift forth runninge stéedes, and turnes their heades another way.
Whilst thus he forth is drawne, and on their manes doth hanginge stay: mightie launce forth flunge him groouelinge to the ground doth cast, And armour double lynd with plate through gorget thick doth brast, And pearcinge to the quick, the vpmost skinne with smale wound rast.
But he with bucklar bent before his breast makes at his loe, And sharpe sword drawne in hand for more assurance, forth doth goe, Whom one the charret wheeles downe dinges, and axle swift in flight Throwes to the ground, and Turnus followinge, soone doth downe alight, And twixt the gorget brim, and space wheras the helmet standes: His head he smites away, and leaues the corps vpo~ the sandes.
These bloodie slaughters fierce in field, whilst Turnus conquerours wrought: Therwhiles Mnestheus with trustie Achates, both Aeneas brought Still bléedinge to his tent, with younge Ascanius by his side, And leaninge to a launce with limpinge pace doth slowly stride.
He frettes, and forcinge striues the shaft, and head forth whole to halle, And askes their best aduice, and faine would know their iudgmentes all, Where it were best the wound wide ope to launce, and arrow hid To cut quite out the flesh that so to warre returne they did.
And now Iapis came, to Phoebus deare the rest aboue, Iasus sunne, with whom surpriso somtime in feruent loue: Apollo gladly gaue him giftes his artes that he shuld know
In thinges to come, in Musick swéete, in skill of shaftes and bow.
But he, wherby he might prolonge his bedred fathers dayes: Chose rather skill in power of herbes, and Phisickes noble praise, And such like knowledge dumb deuoid of honour, to frequent.
Aeneas chaufinge stoode, and to a mightie launce him lent, And youth a troupe about him thick, and sad Iule his sunne.
He at their teares vnmooued standes, as erst he had begunne.
Right Surgeonlike, and forth he fettes his oyles, and salues in store.
And eft he tries the powers of herbes, which him sir Phoebus tought, And tremblinge sundrie thinges applies, but all (god wote) for nought.
And eft the stickinge arowhead with hande he doth assay, With nippers eke sumtime, from out the bones to drawe away.
But fortune will no way assigne, Apollo doth no good.
And now the rage within the field still growinge wareth wook, And fierce doth more arise, and now the mischief is at hand, And all the ayer aboue with smokinge dust full thick doth stand.
The horsmen néere approche, and dartes fast on the tentes do fall.
wofull showte of Souldiours to the heauens flies vp withall,
But Venus much appauld at this her sunnes vnworthie paine: Gréene Ditainie from Ida sacred mount in Créet she bringes, The stalke with te~dre leaues, and purple flowers full fresh that springes.
An hearbe to Roebuckes wild, and beastes not tame right welbeknowne, When as their backes sticke full of dartes, hunters thick haue throwne.
Dysguyso in cloud obscure the same Dame Venus thyther bringes, And into water vessels bright it secretly she flinges, And makes therof Infusion large, the vertue forth to take.
And of Ambrosias holesome iuce therte doth sprynclinge shake, Wherto she addes the fragrant sappe that Panax soote doth make.
Anon the wound with this by chaunce Iapis auntient, baynes, Vnwares herof, and loe in soode in sort, flye all the paynes From out hys bodie quyte away, the blood was staunched strayght, And gently followes forth the shaft with handes alonly wayght, And by and by his former strength returnes to euerie lym.
Then quickly fetch his armour stronge Iapis calles) for him, Why stand you still? and first doth him incense agaynst his foes.
Not by mans helpe Iapis cries) thys cure thus forward goes, Tis not, Aeneas, my righthand, that thée thus saufe preserues, greater god it is that thée to greater déedes reserues.
He greedie then of fight his legges in golden armour tyes On euerie side, all lets he hates, then for his speare he cries.
And when he fitted was of shield, and armd in euerye place: All complete as he stoode, Ascanlus younge he doth embrace, And vp his beuer lyft, and fwéetly kessinge, thus he spake.
Learne courage shout of mée, my child, and perfect paynes to take,
Of others happie chaunce to haue, this righthand shall defend Thée in this warre, and after this to greater honours send.
And sée that thée, when riper yéeres haue made a perfect man: Thine auncetours most famous factes in mynd thou carie than, Let fier Aeneas, and thine vnckle Hector thée incyte.
When he these wordes had spoke, forth of the doores he walked right, Of mightie lim, and in his hand an hugie launce he bare.
Then Antheus and Mnestheus both, with thronginge troupes forth fare.
And all the rout runnes forth, and tentes alone they leaue vnkept.
smoultringe smoakinge dust, a longe the campe with féet is swept.
And all the ground about with weyght of steppes then treblinge lept.
Then Turnus saw him marchinge towardes fast with great aray.
Th' Italians all beheld the same, and through theyr bones staytway soodeyn shiueringe ran, Iuturna first of Latines side, Perceaud and knew the noyse, and sore affright away she hide.
He flies him forth in open field, his hoast he leades apace.
Much lyke a bloustrynge storme, that from the sea to land doth trace, When droppinge cloudes dissolued fall, then husbandmen do wringe, When longe before (alas) they sée what harmes tis like to brynge.
For downe it throwes the trees to ground, and corne it layes alonge, And althinge swéepes to earth, the windes before to shoares do thronge, And crackynge ratlinge sound do make, as ruffe they huffe about: Euen so his bandes agaynst his foes the Troyan captayne stout Leades forth, and they themselues in wedges thick do flockinge throw.
There Thymbres with his sword Osirius lent a deadly blow.
Syr Mnestheus then Archetius flew, Achates dyd behead Syr Epulo, and Gias sharpe sir Vfens left for dead.
Then falles Tolumnius calcar slayn to ground, that first in hast,
And furious frantyke moode his dart against his foes dyd cast.
yellinge shoute then to the heauens they throw, and all affright The vanquisht Rutils turne theyr dustye backes in sodeyn flyght.
But he none daynes such as he méetes with all, on ground to throw, On horseback none nor to inuade, nor yet on foote below Such as dartes flinginge follow after fast, but he alone In mydst of all the dustie myst, and thick thronges euerie one: For Turnus séekes about, and him in combat doth require.
Iuturna then Virago fierce, whose mind was set on fire With pantinge dread, her brother Turnus wagoner, that hight
Metiscus downe from out his place, and charge she tumbleth quight.
And from the Summer farre away she leaues him on the ground, And vp shée leapes, and lithie raignes with hand she turneth rownd, Resemblinge shape, and voice, and armour of Metiscus stout.
Like as the swallow black, that statelie courtes doth flie about Of lordes, and princes great, and loftie buildinges largly tries, And for her pratlinge younge doth féedinge séeke on gnats, or flies, Sumtime in entries wide, sumtime about déepe slandinge lakes, With tendre houeringe winges her skirringe flight swift forward takes: So doth Iuturna through the thickst of foes her horses béete, And euerie place about with fliynge charret swift doth méete.
Sumetime her brother here, and sumtime there doth vauntinge show In quarters farre and néere, nor lettes him giue nor take a blow.
No lesse Aeneas séekes with him to méete through crooked waies, And through his thickst asnned hoast, and quailed Latine rayes, And loud him calles by name so oft as him he hath in sight.
And looke how oft he ment him to pursue with horses light: So oft Iuturna strait the charret stéedes away doth turne.
Alas, what shuld he do? his hart in vaine with rage doth burne, His pensiue mind is much distract with diuerse doubtfull cares.
Messapus then that in his hand by chaunce, as hapt, that bares Two lithie quiueringe dartes, well tipt with stéele, full swift of flight: The one he shakinge holdes, and forth it flinges with leuell right.
Still standes Aeneas, and strait to his shield him self doth fit Downe stoupinge low, howbeit the fliynge darth, his helmet smit, And downe his lustie plume of from his creast to ground it threw.
Then strait his rage arose, and courage great by Treason grew, When stéedes he sawe were turnd awrie, and charret back was raught: Then Ioue, and altars all of broken league he there besaught.
At last he thronges into the thickst, and there in luckie fight Right dreadfull blooddie slaughter makes, he spareth none in fight, And all incenst with ire, vnto his rage he gaine the raygnes.
What god to mée will now at large this pine, and wofull paines, And sundrie slaughters sore, and death of dukes in verse vnfold, That were by Turnus made in course, and Troyan captayn bolde With such fell force these nations stout, Ioue, was it thy will They thus shuld méete that shuld hereafter liue in concord still: Aeneas pa not longe but Sucro Rutil, out of hand,
(That only stroke did cause the fliynge Troyans still to stand) He strake into the side, and where most spéede of death doth rest: Betwéene the short ribbes déepe his sword he draue into his brest.
Then Turnus, turnes Amycus downe, and Diore by his side, Two Troyan brothers déere, and forth on foote to them doth stride.
And at Amycus when he gan approch, a dart he threw.
Diores with his sword he strake bright glittringe which he drew, And both their heades he cut from corps, and blooddie sprinclinge yet: Vpon his charret top, with egre moode aloft he set.
Aeneas Tale and Tanais slaies, and next Cothegus stronge, All thrée at one assault, and sad Onytes liues not longe, Of Thebans auntient stock, and of Peridia mother déere.
Then Turnus brothers sent from Lycia farre to Troy yféere, Menaetes eke Archadian youth, that warre did feare in vayne, And neare to Lerna fishie brinckes an handiecraft did traine.
simple house that kept and princes welth did neuer knowe, His father hired had a litle land, and that did sowe.
And like as flaminge fiers, that kindled are in diuerse wayes
In drye and cracklinge woodes, or on the boughes of ratlinge Eayes.
Or when the swift, and fominge streames from loftie hilles that fall, raginge roaringe raise, and forth to sea they runne withall, Ech findeth out his way, and downe they driue whatso withstandes: No sloer forth Aeneas flies, and Turnus stout of handes, And both within the battayl byde, now now they fret with in, Theyr breastes wt courage brast, whose valient hartes no force can win.
And now to wound echother sore they méete with deadlye foode.
Aeneas there, Murrhanus proud of graundsiers great that stoode, And antique names of noble Belsiers old was woont to showe, And Pedigrues farre fet from all the Latine kinges arowe: He réeues downe with a rocke, the stonie tempest layes him lowe, And vnder horses féet and charret flinges, the whirlinge whéele Him prostrate ouerrunnes, and eft with stampe of shoe of stéele: The swift forth flinginge hoofe with mightie poyse oft striketh hard, And of theyr master throwne to ground the stéedes take no reguard.
Then Turnus with sir Hilus méetes that headlonge runninge ran, And through his temples armd with gold his dart he forced than, The dart soone through the helmet flies, and strait in braines it stéeke No not thy hand stout Cretes, valienst most of all the Greekes From Turnus could acquight, nor yet Cupentus Gods him saue, When once Aeneas cam in place, but soone his brest he gaue Direct against Aeneas launce, the speare on him doth fall, Nought to the séely wretch his brasen shield preuayld at all.
And thee likewise, sir Aeolus, Laurentum fieldes did sée Quite ouerthrowne, and flatly prostrate on the grounde to bée.
There now thou liest, whom Graetian hoast, could neuer ouerthrow, Nor yet Achilles fierce, that Priams kyngdom layd full low.
This was thy time of death prefixt, nigh Ida thou wast borne, In Lyrnesse didst thou dwell, in Laurent fields thou liest forlorne, And now the armies all were bent, all whole the Latine rout, And all the Troian crue, Mnestheus, and sir Serestus stout.
Messapus eke a tamer good of stéedes, Asylas stronge, And Tuscan rankes, and old Euanders swift Archadian thronge, Eche man now for himself withall his might there doth his best.
No stay, nor rest, to cruell fight ech man is ready prest.
There, to Aeneas then his mother faier this mynd did send, That to the citie walles with spéede he shuld his armie bend, And with a soodein mischeif all the Latines hartes affright.
Then as for Turnus round about the hoast he cast his sight: The towne he there beholdes deuoid of warre, to stand at rest, greater shape of warre right then doth kindle in his brest.
For Mnestheus and Sergestus strait he calles, and Serest stronge; His valient captaynes all, and all the heape of Troian thronge Togither runnes, he takes an hill, their shieldes, nor weapons thay Lay not aside, he in the midst aloft, thus gan to say.
Let be no stay at that bid, Ioue on our side doth stand, And soodeyn though charge, let none it slackly take in hand.
This towne the cause of all the warre, and kinge Latinus land, Vnlesse they do submit themselues, and graunt for to obay: Ile surely sack, and race vnto the ground this present day.
Forsooth shall attend till Turnus please with mée to fight? And then agayne his leasure wayt, when he is vanquisht quight? This Towne is chéefest cause, my mates, and head of all the sore.
Goe fet me fier atonce, and do the league with flame restore.
He said, and strayt with one consent a warlike wedge they make,
And thick vnto the walles in clustringe thronges they forth to rake.
Sum runne vnto the gates, and whom they méete they stay downeright.
Sum flinge foorth dartes, and welkin hie with weapons do obscure.
Aeneas there amongst the first his righthand holdes vp pure Vnto the walles, and much in wordes doth blame Latinus kinge, And Gods to record calles, that they to warre againe him bringe.
That twise Italians waxt his soes, and brake their couenants twise.
Then strait amonge the citizens a discord great doth rise.
Sum bid vnlocke the towne, and open wide the gates to set To call the Troians in, and kinge Aeneas in to set.
Sum armour take, and still persist the walles for to defend.
Like as a swarm of Bées that in an hollow Pumice pend, shepheard when by chaunce hath founde, and bitter smooke applies: They fearefull then within, about through waxen castles flies, And with hot hummyng sounde themselues to angre do prouoke.
Out flies from forth their hole apace in heapes, the filthie smoke, The hollow caue beneath with noyse confuesd doth rumblyng sound, And into open ayer abroad at last doth brim rebound.
To Latines ouer this befell a misaduenture great, That all the wofull towne with teares, and sorow did repleat.
For when the Quéene beheld the foe to drawe the citie nie, The walles to burn, and vp to loftie houses fier to flie, No power of Rutils neare at hand, nor Turnus to resist: Vnhappie dame, that Turnus had bin slayne in fight shée wist.
And mated much in mynd with gréeuous feare, shée cries, alas, That of these mischiefes all herself the cause, and worker was.
And all with ruthfull rage incenst, shee blabbes forth many tales, And diyngeripe with nayles her purple robes in ragges shée hales.
Then on a beame with in the pallayce hée a cord she fies,
And hanges herself theron, and (fie for shame) there so she dies.
Which wofull chaunce, when once the Latine women vnderstoode, And first Lauinio bright her daughter deere: as franticke wood Her golden lockes she rent, and roset chéekes with nayles she tare, And all the rout in semblantwise right frantickly do fare.
The houses nie with noyse resounde, and all the towne about This wofull faine doth flickryng fléete within and eke without.
Their courage they let fall, his princely robes Latinus rentes, His hoarie head (good man) and auntient beard with durt besprentes, Amazed at his ladies death, and at the cities fall.
And much himself he blames, that he before did neuer call Aeneas to him prince of Troy, his sunne in law to bée.
Therwhiles lorde Turnus warriar stout, in open field doth sée few poore scattred souldiours, whom he slowly doth pursue.
For now his horses he with courage lesse to runne doth view.
There to his eares a doubtfull noyse the whirlyng aier then braught.
He listnyng stoode, and with attentife eare the sounde he raught Of Laurent sacked towne, and of their pitious clamour thoe.
Alas, why is the citie thus dismaid with gréeuous woe? Or what great outcrie is the same, that doth the citie rayse? He sayd, and therwith welnigh mad, the charret raygnes he stayes.
To whom his sister then, as she Metiscus countnance bare, And of his runnyng charret raygnes, and stéedes had tane the care: With such like wordes replies.
Nay rather let vs follow now The Troians Turnus here, where conquest ginnes on vs to bowe.
There others are that with their handes the citie will defend.
Let vs likewise with slaughter vile the Troians make to smart, So thou with equall numbre slayne, and honour shalt depart.
sister déere, knew ere this how thou by subtile slight, The league didst ouerthrow, and threwst thy self into this fight.
And now in vayne thou séekst mée to deceaue, Goddesse pure.
But who from heauen thée downe to come, such trauayles to endure Requested, such aduentures wilde to bide, and vncoutrould? Was it bycause thy brothers wretched death thou wouldst behold? For whereabout now do goe? what chaunce may me betide, That to my rent, and torne estate some succour may prouide? My self Murrhanus saw of late that me by name did call, Who whilst he liued was to me the best belooued of all, Of limnie a mightie man, and slayne likewise with mightie wound.
Vnhappy Vfens, eke lest he our shame should see, on ground Now dead he lies, the Troians both his corps, and armes enioy.
The houses spoyld (that mischeif yet remaynd, and great anoy) Shall abide to sée? and Drances woordes not prooue vntrue? And shall this ground faintharted dastard Turnus flying viewe?
Is it so vile a thyng to die? hellish hegges belowe
Come help pray, for heauenly powers no sauour mée will showe.
To you my soule deuoid of such a crime, shall downe descend, No deale inferiour to the graundsiers great of all my kend.
Scarce had he said, when loe sir Sages lockt on fominge stéede, Flies through the thickest foes, whose face deepe wounded sore did bléede With dint of arrowe fallinge swift, and thus he criynge spake.
Turnus in thée is all our hope, on thine some pitie take.
Aeneas rageth now in armes, and threates he will confound The turrets of Italia land, and citie burne to ground.
And now the fier to houses flies, the Rutils bend their eyes On thée, and all the séely Latines sure do so likewyse.
Latinus kinge is much in doubt, and murmour great doth make, Whom he may call his sunne in lawe, or what league he may take.
And ouer this, the Quéene most true to thée, her death hath wrought With her owne cruell hand, and light of life estéemd at nought.
Before the gates Messapus stronge, ioynt with Atinas stout: Alone susteyne the force, and all the rankes them round about Do stand full thick, and iron thronges of dartes do daunt their face, And thou thy charret here alone in desert fieldes dost trace.
Then Turnus at the diuerse shape of thinges astunned staid, And downe his eyes he kest to ground, and whustinge nothinge said.
And there atonce great greife and shame his heauie hart doth freat Déepe lodgd within, and madnes mixt in breast with sorow great, And loue incenst with rage, and priuie touch of enmies might.
But when from mind he darknes draue, and brought againe the light: His flaminge eyes with ire vnto Laurentum walles he rold, And from his charret hie the goodlie towne he did behold: When loe the flashinge flames aloft the battelmentes had caught Of Turnus noble tower, and vp to heauen they cracklinge raught.
tower stronge, made of wood, the prince himself had built alone, And choules had vnderlayd, and ladders made to mount theron.
Ah sister (then {quod} he) my death drawes neare hold thée content, Where goddes, and spitefull fortune call, to followe full am bent, And with Aeneas hand to hand to méete, and what our payne Augmenteth els with losse of lothsome life: that to sustayne.
And, sister, after this thou shalt not sée me play the part Of cowarde knight, but giue me licence now with all my hart thée beséech, before my finall rage, to rage a while.
He sayd, and as his desperate mind with inward wrath did boyle:
From charret downe into the open fieldes his leape he takes, And forth through foes he thronges, his sorowfull sister there forsakes.
And through the thickst of all the hoast holdes on his frantique pace, And on ech side the ray of enmies rankes he doth displace.
Like as a rocke that from a loftie mount doth headlonge fall, Enforst with rage of wind, or els with shoures, and water gall.
Or when longe yéeres with auntient tract of time the hold did lose The hugie hill falles downe with woundrous force, and away it goes, And proudly springes on ground, and wooddes, and beastes, and me~, all Before him tumblinge turnes, and roulinge runnes forth like a ball.
So through his vanquisht hoast forth Turnus mad in hast doth flie Where all the ground about with blood doth deepely drenched lie, And whirlinge deadlie dartes in th'ayer aboue do make a cloud.
He beckens with his hand, and with his mouth thus cries aloud.
Stay stay Rutils now, and Latines hold your handes, no more.
What euer chaunce befall, tis due to mée though it goe sore.
Tis méeter the broken league with smart deseru'd shuld bie, And in your stéed myself a lone with blade the quarrell trie.
They strayt withdrewe the~selues, and wide roomth made him by by.
But lord Aeneas, Turnus name whence once in eare he tooke: The sturdie citie walles, and loftie towers anon forsooke.
And lingringe layes aside, and all attemptes leaues out of hand, And leapes for ioy, and thundrynge there doth great in armour stand: As much as Athos mount, or Eryx hill, or rough with wood, And whom with snowie toppe all yéere to stand it doth much good Hie auntient Appeninus hill, that to the cloudes doth rise.
Then Rutils all, and Troyans all do bend their héedfull eies.
And all Th' Italian troupes likewise, both those the walles on hie That kéepe, and those with enginnes great to breake the walles that plie· And armour downe from shoulders lay.
Latinus mazed standes, When such two mightie men he sées of limme, so stout of handes, In places so farre distant borne méete there with so great might, And fully bent their force to trie in single handed fight.
Then they when first in emptie field ech other gan to viewe: With trauerse swift about, ech one his dart at other threwe.
Then strait to hand they come, theyr swordes and targates méetinge dash.
There might you heare the grou~d to grone, their blades wt blowes do clash Thickedubled fet, good chaunce, and prowis togither in one are mixt.
And like as when contention falles two mightie Bulles betwixt, On toppe of hugie Syla mount, or hille Tabernus hie, That for dominion euermore, and mastershippe do trie: With hornes they do inuade, the fearfull kéepers stand a side, And all the flockinge heard about déepe silent doth abide, The hefers mumblinge soft do make, who now shall rule the roast, And whom the heard shall followe, as they do féede about the coast.
They with all force, with mortall wounde ech other séekes to smight, And with their perlous crooked hornes alone is all their fight.
Their foule black reakinge blood, with channell large doth fall to ground, And necke shoulders bathes, with bellowinge bloud the wood doth sou~d.
None otherwyse Aeneas fierce, and stout lord Daunius méete With targates redie bent, and round the ayer with noyse repléete.
Then Iupiter in heauen aboue in equall balaunce wayghes Theyr destnies both, and from his sentence graue a whyle he staies.
And vnto ether diuerse chaunce alottes, who shall endure Moe trauailes hard, and who the present death to die is sure.
There Turnus vauntes himself and well he hopes, with all his might sturdie blowe he fettes, and on his toes he rises right.
The stroake lightes home, the Troyans shout, the Latines shake for feare, And both the armies roundabout amazd stand gapinge there.
But loe, the false and brittle sword is broken, and at that blowe
And quite vndoone he was, had not he tane himself to flight.
Thence fast he flies more swift then wind, and sées there in his sight straunge sword hilt, his stout righthand likewyse of weapon voyd.
Reporte doth goe, that when to battle first to go he ioyd, And mounted first his charret hie forst forth with feare and ire: His fathers sword he then mistooke, and as hast did require, His wagoner Metiscus sword he tooke in stéede of his, Which longe, while Troyans turne theyr backes in flight, sufficient is.
But when to armour made by god Vulcanus come it was: The mortall sword at first blowe flies about like brickle glasse, And litle shiuers round about lie shininge in the grasse.
There Turnus in his flight, the broad wyde fieldes doth trace about, Now here he turnes, now there, and courses round fettes in and out.
On euerie side a ringe of Troyans thick incloasd him all, On this side lay a fenne, on that side stoode the citie wall.
No lesse Aeneas then (howbeyt full déepe with arrowe smit His faultringe knées do faile, and to runne fast will not permit) Him after hies, and foote to foote at héeles him vrgeth nie.
Like as a Deare, that to the pleasaunt soile apace doth hie, And there in meash of hugie net entrapt, doth quakinge feare.
The hunter comes wt howndes, wt great barkinges drawes him neare.
He at the sturdie toyle, and bankes full hie right sore agast: thousand wayes doth turne and wend, the noble hownd doth hast, And gapinge comes at héeles, and now doth pinch, or like to pinche: He snoppes his iawes, and is deceaud is bit by half an inche.
Then rises round a shout, that shoares, and lakes the same rebound, And all the heauen about with thumpinge thundre doth resound.
Then Turnus fliynge fast doth all his Rutils forely blame, And for his sword well knowne, he calles to euerie one by name.
Aeneas present death doth threat, and great destruction there, If eny do approch, and them still tremblinge more doth feare, And threates the citie downe to race, and walles vnto the ground.
And still (though wounded) drawes him néere, and now fiue courses round About they had absolu'd, and back fiue courses they begunne, Both this way now, then that, nor for no trifle it is they runne, But for kinge Turnus life they striue (alas) and for his blood.
By chaunce therby an Oliue wild with bitter leaues there stood, Sacred to Faunus god, to mariners a ioyfull trée, Where such as saufe from shipwrack foule, and drenchinge saued bée: Are woont their offringes vp to hange, and garmentes knowne at full.
This trée without respect at all, the Troyans vp did pull, That without let wherin to fight the whole field they might haue.
There stuck Aeneas dart, him force in castinge thither draue.
The roote it fast did hold, he bendes him downe, and there assayes Thereout to pull the speare, and it at Turnus cast, his wayes As forth he runnes, whom he in runninge could not euer take.
Then Turnus raginge mad with feare, his prayer thus gan make.
Faunus pitie take praye ({quod} he,) thou worthie Ground Hold fast the dart, your honours if euer saued found.
He sayd, and to the goddes his sute he did not make in vayne.
For though he striued longe, and at the clunge stemme much did stay: Yet by no strength Aeneas could his speare pull thence away.
Thus whilst he fiercely forcinge standes, and still doth pluck and strayne.
Into her brothers wagoners Metiscus shape agayne Iuturna chaungd, his sword vnto her brother doth restore.
That Venus at this Nymphes so bold attempt disdaininge sore, Drew néere, and from the roote beneath the dart she plucked out.
Then they with weapons armed both, and waxt with courage stout, This trustinge sword, the other fierce with speare Aeneas bent: Gainst other gone, with marciall might ech one at other went.
Therwhiles thalmightie kinge to Iuno speakinge thus he told, That from a yellow cloud aboue, the batteill did behold.
What shall the end herof be wyfe? what now remaineth? say.
Aeneas is a god thou knowest, thyself canst not denay.
And that to heauen he longes, and to the starres to be extold.
What dost thou worke? or in what hope abidste in cloudes so cold? Ist méete a god with dint of mortall wound defilde shuld bée? Or els (for what Iuturna could she do were not for thée?) The sword restoarde to Turnus be, and force to vanquisht growe? Leaue of at last at our request, lay downe thy courage lowe.
Nor let such priuie Rancor fret thée more, this care and smart Let them (good Iuno from thy swéete and pleasaunt mouth depart.
Wée to the last are come, the Troyans vexe by sea and land Thou mightst, and blooddie wicked warres to rayse was in thine hand, And houses to deface, and monefull mariages to make.
Thus Ioue then spake, And goddesse Iuno with a louly countnance thus replied.
Both Turnus, and the earth, and all left against my will.
Ne shuld you sée me now in ayer alone to sit so still, And suffre thus such worthie vnworthie thinges, but armd in fier In thickest thronges would thrust, and on the Troyans wreake myne ire.
Iuturna confesse, causd her wofull brother aid, And for his life (alas) bid what could, shuld be assaid.
Yet weapons none wilde her take, nor yet to bend her bowe, sweare by dreadfull springes whence streame of Styx alo~ge doth flowe.
The only true, and reuerent Oth that heauenlie goddes do make.
And now do giue place, and lothsome warres quite forsake.
But yet this one thinge now, which destnies course doth not denay: For honours sake of thine, and for all Latium graunt pray.
That when (wherto yéeld) in perfect peace they wedlockes knit, And holsome lawes appoint, and lastinge leagues of frindship smit: Of Latine old inhabitours thou wouldst not chaunge the name, Nor Troyans to be cauld, nor Teucers yet commaund the same.
Nor let the~ chau~ge their speach, but weare their wéedes they ware of yore.
Let Romane ofspringe be of power through great Italian might, Troy downe is falne, and with the name now let it perish quite.
To whom the maker of goddes and men thus answered smilinge mild.
Thou art my sister déere, and old Saturnus second child, Why dost thou then such hugie waues of rage roule in thy breast? But goe to, from this late sprunge greife set whole thy hart at rest.
graunt thy sute, and wittinge willinge there to do agrée.
Ausonians shall their language kéepe, and customes as they bée, And as it is their name shall byde, in bodie only mixt Shall Troyans be, no diffrence more them both shalbe betwixt.
Theyr maners, and theyr sacred rites will oppoint them all, And will cause all nations still they Latines them shall call.
This stock that of Ausonian blood commixt shall shortly rise: In vertue men shall passe, and passe the Goddes that dwell in skies.
Vnto thée honour doe no nation shall so much as thay.
Dame Iuno gaue a nodde, and glad, her mind she turnes a way, And from the ayer departes, and leaues the cloud where she did stay.
When this was done: the father of Goddes a newe deuise doth prooue, How from her brothers aid Iuturna Nymphe he may remooue.
Two wofull plagues there béene, that by right name men Furies call,
At one birth brought to light, and with like stinges of serpentes fell Them all did arme, and like wynges gaue that shift windes do excell.
These Ioue before, and in the seat of Pluto dreadfull kinge Attendinge stand, and wofull feare to mortall men they brynge, If dryrie death at eny time, or sicknes vile to beare Ioue do commaund, or cities naught with bloodie warres to feare.
Of these then one from heauen Ioue downe doth send with spéedie flight, And to Iuturna with ill lucke byddes flie her to affright.
Away she goes, and vnto earth with whirlewind flitteth fast, Noneotherwyse then when a shaft swift forth with bowstringe cast In deadlye bytter poyson dypt, through cloudes apace doth flie,
Which mortall shaft a Parthian shot, or Cydon man did wrye: The singinge toole through shadowe flies, that none perceaue it may.
So went this child of Night, and so to earth shée tooke her way.
When Troyan host at hand, and Turnus hand she did espie: To shape of slendre foule herself she chaunges by and by, Suchas are woont on grislie graues, and desert houses sit By night, and in the darke their wofull tunes do charme, and chit.
To this foule forme thus turnd, at Turnus face she skirringe cries,
And strikes his targat with her winges, as here and there she flies.
This new feare the~ his droupinge limmes with dread did cause to quake, His heare rose vp on end, his tremblinge voyce in iawes fast stake.
But when the Furies hatefull shritch from farre, and winges she knew: Iuturna wofull wight, her heare from of her head she drew, And with her nailes her face she rent, with handes she beat her breast.
Ah Turnus now ({quod} she) what may she do that loues the best?
That may practise same, thy wofull life for to prolonge? Myself agaynst such monsters to oppose am of might? Nay nay, the battayle now leaue, nor me with feare affright Do any more you filthy foules, and hegges of Limbo low, Your hellish sound, and clappyng of your winges well do know.
And well wot the proude beheastes of Ioue so great of might, Now for my Maydenhoode bereft doth he me thus requight? Why gaue he mée eternall life, and death did take away? So that by mortall end these lastyng greifs might delay, And with my brother déere now downe descende to shadowes dead, If like as he (which would to God) a mortall life lead.
No pleasure of my pleasures all shall pleasant be to mée brother Turnus déere, and all for lacke, and losse of thée.
What grounde (alas) will gape below my corps therin to take, And bring mée downe (a Goddesse though be) to Lymbo lake? This much she sayd: and strayt her head in mantell blue she hid Sore sighinge, and anon she threwe herself the streame amyd.
Aeneas forceth forth, and mightie speare in hand doth shake Of sturdie tymber framde, and with great courage thus he spake.
What tarience now is this? why, Turnus, dost thou kingre thus? In flight wée must not striue, but neare at hand in fight was.
Transforme thyself to euerie shape, or els thy best assay.
By force of armes, or els by craft to rid thyself away.
Or wish vnto the loftie starres by flittryng winges to flie, Or couered els within some hollow caue in grounde to lie.
He shakyng then his head: tis not thy bitter wordes that me Do make a feard, but Gods me fray, and Ioue my soe ({quod} he.)
He sayd no more, but strait a mightie stone he there behelde, mighty auntient stone, that then by chaunce within the felde There for a Bounde did lie, and strife twixt lands for to appease.
Scarce could twelue chosen men that on their shoulders lift with ease, Such men meane, as now a dayes the earth to light doth bryng.
This vp in hand he caught, and tremblyng at his foe did flyng Arysing vp therwith, and forth his vease he fet withall.
But he nor when he came, nor when he went to minde doth call, Or when he lifted vp his hande, or when the stone he threw.
His knées do fayle, and through his bloud a chilly colde there flew.
The stone then rowlyng through the emptie ayer his way did take, But foorth at full it did not flie, nor yet the mark it strake.
And like as in a dreame when sleape by night hath cloasd our eies, Sometimes in vayne great courses foorth to run wée do deuise, And in the midst of all our force anon begin to fayle, Our tongue is tied, and through our body quite our strength doth quayle, That make no noise wée can, nor able are one worde to say.
To Turnus so, what euer manfull meanes he doth assay: Successe the cruell Furie doth deney.
Then in his minde thousand thoughtes arise, his eies he back doth cast behinde, And on the Rutils, and the Towne he lookes, and doubtes for feare, And trembles when he thinkes at hand to come the fatall speare, Nor knowes which way to wend, nor how against his foe to flie, His charret nor his charret mayd he can no where espie.
Whilst thus he doubtes, Aeneas forth his speare doth shake in sight, And vauntadge watcheth with his eie, thenstrait with all his might, Afarre he flinges it forth.
Not so doth cast the hugie stones The enginne greate, that to breake walles of townes is made for nones.
Nor with such clappe the lightninge bright out of high heauen doth brast.
The murdringe speare flies forth, and whirlwindlike, doth flit as fast.
And through his armour brane of proofe it heates, and bucklar bright With seauen thick lininges layd, into the thigh it strake him quight.
Then Turnus wounded doune to grownd with dubled knées doth fall.
The Rutils wofull shoutes do rayse, and round the hilles withall Resoundinge make, and all the wooddes the noyse beat back againe.
He then on grownd, his yéeldinge eyes, and hand of pardon fayne Entreatinge vp doth hold, and sure haue deseru'd ({quod} hée) Nor pardon aske none, vse now thy chaunce at will on mée.
But if reguard of auntient sier, thy mind sumdeale may tuch, (For vnto thée of late thy father Anchises old was such:) Vpon kinge Daunus auntient yeares do thou some pitie take, And mée, or whether thou meanst deuoid of vitall lyfe to make: Restoare vnto my fréendes, for thou hast wunne, these handes of mine Th' Ausonians saw to yéeld, and faier Lauinia now is thine.
Fierce there in armes did stand Aeneas castinge downe his eyes, and still he staid his hand.
And more and more the gentle spéech to swage his mind began: When loe, (alas) th'unluckie Belt that on his shoulders than Aloft with buckles glittringe bright with gold that garnisht were, Appéered, which he knewe rightwel, that Pallas younge did beare: Whom Turnus with a mightie wound had slayne not longe before, And now the pilladge of his foe vpon his shoulders wore.
But when with eyes these tokens great of greife he did behold And spoyles, with rage incenst, in furie wood, and vncontrold: Ah wretch ({quod} he) dost thinke that wearinge spoyles of mine, from mée Shalt so escape? Now Pallas with this wound, now Pallas thée Doth offer vp, and on thy wicked blood reuenge doth take.
This sainge, déepe him to the hart with naked sword he strake
All hot with ire, the natiue heat his limmes doth strait forsake,
His ghost flies fast with greife, and great disdayne, to Lymbo lake.
Master Phaers Conclusion to his interpretation of the Aeneidos of Virgil, by him conuerted into English verse.
THus farfourth (good readers) aswell for defence of my cou~trey language (which haue heard discommended of manie, and esteemed of some to be more than barbarous) as also for honest recreation of you the nobilitie, gentlemen and Ladies that studie no Latine, haue taken some trauaile to expresse this most excellent writer, as far as my simple abilitie extended.
And if god sende me life and leisour, purpose to set forthe the rest, vnlesse it maye lyke some other that is better armed with learning, to preuent my labours, whereof assure you, woulde be right glad, contenting my selfe sufficie~tly with this, that by mee first this gate is set open.
If nowe the yong writers wil vouchesaue to enter: they may find in this language, both large and abundant campes of varietie, where in they may gather innumerable sortes, of most beautifull floures, figures, and phrases, not onely to supplie the imperfection of mee: but also to garnishe al kindes of their owne verses with a more cleane and co~pendious order of meeter, than heretofore co~monly hath ben accustomed.
And if any further help may do to that purpose, shal more gladly bestowe my trauaile hereafter, if may knowe that these my beginnings be of you gently taken and embraced.
Trusting that you my right worshipful maisters, and studentes of Vniuersities, and such as be teachers of children and readers of this auctour in Latin, wil not be to muche offended, though euery verse answere not to your expectation.
For (besides the diuersitie betweene a construction and a tra~slation) you know there be many misticall secretes in this writer, which vttered in English would shewe litle pleasour, and in myne opinion are better to be vntouched, than to diminishe the grace of the rest with tediousnes and darknes.
ha+ue therefore folowed the cou~sel of Horace, teaching the duety of a good interpretour, Qui quae desperat nitescere posse, relinquit, by which occasio~, somwhat haue in places omitted, somwhat altered, and some thing haue expounded, and al to the ease of inferior readers, for you that are learned need not to be instructed.
meane not to preiudice any that can do finer, only desyre you to beare with my trauaile, and among other to pardon my first booke, wherein found this new kinde of fingering somewhat straunge vnto me, and to say the truth had neuer any quiet from troubles, to co~fer or peruse that booke, or any of the rest, as most
You may therefore accept them, as thinges roughly begunne, rather than polished, and where you vndersta~d a faute, desier you, with silence paciently passe it, and vpon knowledge geuen to mee, shal in the next setting forth, endeuour to reforme it.
And if anye with this wil not be contented, than let him take it in hand, and doe it a new him self, and nothinge mistruste, but he shal find it an easier thing to controlle a peece or two, than to amende the whole of this enterpretation.
Thus commit you to god gentle Readers, and praye you correct these errours escaped in the printing.

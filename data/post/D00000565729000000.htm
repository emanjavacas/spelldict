woman child, of right shape and comely proportion, which child is now aliue, wherat the parents and neyghbors reioyced, thinking al thinges had ben well and their busines ended but so it fell not out.
For you shall vnderstand that after the former perill was past, newe panges began to arise vpon the sorrowful wo+man in such sort that it caused a lamentation among all the wiues.
Thus with painfull throwes she endured two daies more, and at the last was released of her painfull burden, the ninth day of the same moneth she brought forth this monsterous child, a terror to all the behoulders.

Latham M. Browne our minister with diuers others which haue seene the same can certifie you.
Many times hath the Lord shewed vs his wonders, and maruelous workes, to be a fore warning of the punishments whiche he hath prepared for sin: What a number of straunge tokens, monsterus birthes, blazing starres, earthquakes, dreadful signes in the ayer, and fearefull stormes and tempests to moue vs to repentance and amendment of our wicked
liues hath he shewen in our land, and yet few or none regardes it.

The Lord be mercifull to this our Countrey of England, vnto whom our most louing God hathe giuen many warninges, yea as many as euer Ierusalem had, and yet we continue in our former sinnes.
The Ayer hath beene corrupted because of sin, the Skie hath shotte foorth fiery thunderboltes and lings because of sin, straung commes hath eatned destruction for our sinne, the earth hath quaked because of the wrath of God for sinne, and mountaines haue remoued out of their places to giue vsÂ· warning to remoue from our sinne.

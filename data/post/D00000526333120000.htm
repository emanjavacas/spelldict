Heir followeth the coppie of the ressoning which was betuix the Abbote of Crosraguell and Iohn Knox, in Mayboill concerning the masse, in the yeare of God, a thousand fiue hundreth thre scoir and two yeares.
For protest vnto euerie man that heareth the wordes of the prophecie of this boke: If any ma~ shall adde vnto these thinges, God shall adde vnto him the plagues, that are written in this boke.
Imprinted at Edinburgh by Robert Lekpreuik, and are to be solde at his hous, at the nether bow.
Iohn Knox vnto the reader, wisheth grace mercie and peace, from God the Father, and from our Lorde Iesus Christe: with the spirit of righteous iudgement. [leaf motif] AFter that the Prophet Isayas in great vehemencie, had rebuked the vanitie of Idolles, and Idolaters as in the
chapters, of his prophecie doeth appear, at last he bursteth forth in these wordes.
Let them bring forth there Gods (saeth he) that they may shaw vnto vs thinges that are to come, or let them declare vnto vs thinges that haue bene done before.
&c. Shaw thinges that are to come, that we may vndersta~d you to be Gods, let you do ether good or euill, that we may declare it.
By which wordes, the Prophet doeth as it were in mockage, prouoke Idolaters, and the Idoles to produce for them selues, some euident testimonies by the which me~ might be assured, that in them was power, and that there religion had approbation of God.
which when they could not do, he is bold to prononce this sentence: Behold ye are of nothing,
and your making is of nothing, abomination hath chosen you.
In which wordes the Prophet damneth, bothe the Idoles, the Idolaters.
The Idoles, because they can declare nothing to proue any power or wertue to be in them, why they should be worshipped as Gods.
And the Idolaters, because from Gods month they could bring no assurance of there addulterat and vsurped religion.
If this reasoning of the Prophet, had sufficient strength in his aige, to shaw the vanitie of the Idoles, and the phrenetick foolishnes of suche as worshipped them: then may the godlie this day moste assuredly conclude against the great Idole presented by the Papistes to be worshipped in there masse, and against the patrons of the same: that it and they are
It, because it hath mo makers then euer had the Idoles amongest the Gentiles: and yet hath no greater power, then they had.
And they because, they worshipped there owne imagination, and the workmanship of there own ha~des, without any assura~ce of God or of his word.
If any think that speak more liberally, then am able to proue, let him consider what makers the Idoles of the Gentiles had, and what makers the God of bread hath.
And then let the power of bothe be co~pared, and let me be rebuked, if speak not the treuth.
The Prophet in discription of there vanities, maketh these gries.
The earth bringeth forth the tree, it groweth by moistour, and natural wacknes, it is cutted doun by the hand of the hew
parte thereof is burnt, a parte spent in vses necessarie to man, an other parte chosen to be made an Idole.
This is formed to the licknes of man or woman, and then set vp and worshipped as a God.
All these and some mo, shall we find to assist concurre in the making of this great God of bread.
The wheat is sowen and nourished in the earth, rain, dew, and heat bring it to maturitie.
The reaper or scherer cutteth it doune, the carte or fled, drawen by hors or some other beast, draweth it to the barne, or to the barnyaird.
The tasker, or the foot of the ox tradeth it out.
The millar, and the milstones by the help of wind or watter, maketh it to be meall.
The smith maketh the yrnes, that giues to that God, his lenth and breaid, licknes and form.
The fyne substance of that God is nether wood, gold, nor siluer, but watter meal made i~ maner of a dra~mock.
And then must the workmen take good hede to there hand.
For if the fyre be to hote, that Gods skin must be burnt, if the yrnes be euill dight, his face wilbe blecked, if in making the roundnes, the ring be broken, then must an oher of his fellowes, receaue that honor to be made a God, and the crased or cracked miserable caik, that ones was i~ hope to be made a God, must be giuen to a babby to play him withall.
And yet is not all the danger past, for if there be not an anoynted preist to play his parte aright, all the formar artificers haue lost there laboure, for without him that God can not be made: yea, if he haue not intention to co~secrate, the fashioned God remaueth bread, and
These are the artificers and workmen that trauell in making of this God: think as many in nomber, as the Prophet reciteth to haue trauelled in making of the Idoles.
And if the power of bothe shalbe compared, think they shalbe found in all thinges equall, except that the God of bread is subiect vnto mo dangers then were the Idoles of the Gentilles.
They were deaf and dum, it can not speak, hear nor see.
Brieflie in infirmitie, they wholie aggre, except that (as haue said) the poore God of bread is moste miserable of all other Idoles.
For according to there matter whereof they are made, they will remaine without corruptio~ many yeares.
But within one year, that God will putrifie, then he must be burnt.
They can abyde the vehemencie of the wind, frost, rain, or snow.
But the wind will blow that God to the sea, the rain or the snow wil make it dagh again, yea, which is most of all to be feared, that God is a pray (if he be not wel kept) to rattes and mise.
For they will desyre no better denner then white rounde Gods ynew.
But then what becometh of Christes natural bodie? by myrackle, it flies to the heauen againe, if the papists teach treulie, for how sone soeuer the mouse takes hold, so sone flieth Christ away letteth hir gnow the bread.
bold and puissant mouse, but a feble and miserable God? Yet wold ask a question, whether hath the preist or the mouse greater power? by his wordes it is made a God, by hir teith it ceaseth to be a God.
If any think that oght not to mock, that which the world so long hath holden, and great Princes yet holde in so great veneration.
answer, that not onelie I, but also all godlie oght not onelie to mock, but also to curse and detest, whatsoeuer is not God, and yet vsurpeth the name, power, and honor of God.
And also that we oght bothe to mock, gain say, and abhorr, all religio~ obtruded to the people, without assurance of God his word, hauing nether respect, to antiquitie, to multitude, to authoritie, nor estimatio~, of them that mantean the same.
The Idoles of the Gentiles were more ancient, then is the Idole in the masse.
There worshippers, manteners, and patrons, were mo in multitude, greater in authoritie, and more excellent before the world, then euer was any that bowed to that
And yet feared not the Prophet Isayas to mock and iest them, yea, sharplie to rebuke them, in these wordes.
They are dung backward with shame, they shalbe ashamed, whosoeuer trusteth in a grauen ymage, and that say to the molten ymage,
All the makers of graue~ ymages are vaine, there pleasing thing+es shall not proffet them.
For they themselues are witnesses, to there Idoles, that they nether se, nor vndersta~d any thing, and therefore they shalbe ashamed, who then (sayeth he) shall forge a God? or a molten ymage that profiteth nothing? behold all those that are of the fellowship thereof shalbe confounded, for the workmen them selues are men, let them all be gathered together, and stand vp, yet they shall feare and be confou~ded together.
And when he hath fully painted forth there vanitie, he concludeth.
They haue not vnderstand, for God hath shut vp there eyes,
that they can not see, and hartes, that they can not vnderstand, none considereth in his hart, haue brunt half of it, euen in the fyre, and haue baken bread also vpon the coalles thereof haue rosted fleshe earen it, and shall make the residew thereof an abomination, shall bow to the stock of a tree? &c.
Thus, say, we see, how that the Prophet doeth triumph against the Idolaters, in mocking of there madnes, and painti~g forth of there vanitie.
Who then can iustlie be offended against me or any other albeit by all meanes possible, we let the blind world see, the vanitie of that Idole? considering that by it, hath the glorie of God bene more obscured, then euer it was by any Idole in the earth.
the name, nature, power, and honor of God, but to that Idole allone.
If any think that the Scriptures of God giue vnto them patrocinie, ether to beleue Christes naturall body to be there, after the wordes of consecration (as they cal them) ether yet to beleue that Christ Iesus, in his last Supper, did offer vnto God his Father his body and blood, vnder the formes of bread and wine, he is miserablie deceaued, for the Scripture maketh no mention, of conuersion or transubstanciation of bread in Christes naturall bodie, but witnesseth that bread remaneth bread, yea eue~, when the faithfull receaue the same,
The bread that we break, is it not the co~munication of Christes bodie? the cup of blissing which
we blisse, is it not the co~munion of the blood of Christ we many, are one bread, and one body, because we are all partakers of one bread.
as as ye shall eat of this bread, and drink of this cup, ye shew the Lordes death till he come.
Let therefore, a man try himself and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this &c. By these wordes we may clearlie vnderstand, what iudgement the Apostle had of the substa~ce of that Sacrament, euen in the verie action of the same.
And as touching that foolish opinion, that Christ Iesus did offer his body vnto God his Father, vnder the formes of bread wine. &c. (which the Papistes make the ground of there masse) what suffrage that euer it hath by man, of God, nor of his word, it hath none.
The Scripture dooth witnes that God the Father gaue his Sone vnto the world, that the world might be saued by him, and that Iesus Christ did offer him self ones vnto God,
for the destructio~ of sinne, and for to take away the sinnes of many, but that euer he did offer him self vnder the formes of bread and wine (as the Papistes alledge) the holy Goste doeth no where make mention.
And therefore the faithfull not onely may reiect it as the dreame and inuention of man, but also are bou~d to abhor detest it as a doctrine broght in by Satan, to deceaue suche as delyte not in the veritie of God, to whose and voice are the faithfull onely
M. Quintyne that great patron of the masse, in this subsequent conference,
aieds for the probation of his affirmatiue, Christ Iesus did offer (sayeth he) vnto God his Father, in his last Supper his body and blood, vnder the formes of bread and wine. &c.
For the probation hereof, say he adduces the fact of Melchisedec that broght forth bread and wine.
But how sone he is ashamed thereof and how vnable he is to proue that which he alledgeth to be moste easie to be prouen, the diligent reader may
that ether Christe Iesus or yet Melchisedec, did make any suche oblation, as he the fond Papistes do imagine.
sayeth M. Quintyne, haue hurt my own cause, was caried away with zeal &c.
It apperteaned not vnto me to proue any thing, but to defend my artickles as they are written.
and his will resolue me an dout, then will giue my iudgement, whether he oght to proue, or to defend onely.
My dout is this, whether are M. Quintynes artickles necessarie to be beleued to Saluatio~, or are they suche as without danger of damnation, we may dout of them? If we may dout of them and not offend God, then assuredly think that M. Quintyne may hold them for treuth, til that the falshead of them be manifestly declared.
But if they be suche as we are bound to beleue as a treuth of God, and an doctrine necessarie to Saluation, then is M. Quintyne bound to shaw to vs that God hath prononced them, and not man.
which if he be not able to do, and that in plaine and expressed wordes, then must we reiect them as deceauable,
fals, accordi~g as we be taucht by our maister Christ Iesus saying: My sheip heare my voice, but a stranger they will not heare.
If M. Q. will not be reputed an fals Prophet, one that teacheth lies in the name of God, and so expone him self to Gods here displeasure, he may propone no doctrine to the Church of God, the assurance whereof, he bringeth not from the mouth of God.
If M. Q. were brawling in the scooles, or bragging of knowledge amo~gest the Philosophers, wold pacientlie abyde, that he should affirme as many paradoxes, as pleaseth him.
But in the Church of God to affirme that God hath spoken, when God hath not spoken, or done that which he is not able to proue, by his plaine word, that he hath done, so to do (I say) is altogether intollerable, and therefore let M. Q. searche the Scriptures, for the probation of his affirmatiue, or els will cry als loud as can, that he hath lost his cause, and is conuicted an manifest lear: in that he hath affirmed Iesus to haue done that, which no Scripture doeth witnes, that he hath done.
Let all men therefore that will not follow lies, detest the masse, till that it find a ground within the booke of God, as am assured it neuer shall.
And that shall the reader more easylie perceaue, by this conference that followeth.

And sa fair ye weill, of Crosraguell this Sonday, the of September.
THe treuth is, that the cause of my co~ming in these partes not of purpose to seak disputation, but simplie to propone vnto the people Iesus Christ to be the onelie Sauiour of the world, and to teach further, what are the fruites that God requireth of the members of his dear sone. &c.
But heauing that ye had in oppen audience proclamed blasphemous artickles, making promes to giue further declaratio~ of certane of the~, this last Sonday, lykewise in oppen assemblie, could not but of conscience, offer my self to be your aduersat in that
And this far for the cause of my co~ming yesterday to khos
That ye haue required disputation of the ministers (of whome some are yet present) could haue none, hardlie beleue it, the contrary being assured to me by diuers of honest report.
That ye offer vnto me familiar, formall, and gentill reasoning with my whole hart accept the condition.
For assuredlie my Lord (so style you by reason of blood and not of office) chiding brawling vtterlie abhor, but that ye require it to be secrete, nether se iust cause why that ye should require it, nether yet good reson why that should grant it.
Yf ye feare tumult asye pretex, that is more to be feared where many of euill mynd haue a few quiet and peceable men in there danger, then where a iust multitud may gainst and violence, if it be offered.
Of my Lord of Cassilles promes, nothing dout as touching my owne person, for stand in the protection of the Almightie, to whom render hartly thankes, when his mercie and power boweth the hartes of men, to assist the cause of the iust.
But wonder with what conscience ye can require priuat conference of those artickles that ye haue publicklie proponed? Ye haue infected the eares of the simple? Ye haue wounded the hartes of the godlie, and ye haue spoken blasphemie in oppen audience.
Let your owne conscience now be iudge, if we be bound to answer you in the audience of
of whom the one half are alreadie persuaded in the treuth, the other perchance so addicted to your error, that they will not be content, that light be called

Yf ye send your artickles to the baillies of Air, it shalbe sufficient discharge for you.
And thus crauing your answer, hartlie desire God if his good pleasure be, so to molifie your hart, that ye may prefer his eternal treuth, conteined and expressed in his holy word, to your own preconceaued opinion.
Iohn Knox the abbotes second letter, whereunto answer is made brieflie to euerie head of the same.
IOhn Knox ressaned your writing, this monu~day the seuint of September, and considered the heides thairof, and first quhair ye say, your cu~ming in this cuntrie, was not to seik disputation, but simplie to propone vnto the people, Iesus Christ crucified, to be the onely Sauiour of the warld, praise be to God, that was na newingis in this cuntrie, or ye war borne.
greatlie dout, if euer Christ Iesus wes treulie preached, by a papisticall prelat or monk.
Secondlie, quhair ye alledge that proclamed in oppen audience blasphemous artickles (he is ane euill iudge that condemnis or he knowes) than had bene tyme to yow to haif called them blasphemous, quhen ye had sene them, red them, and sufficientlie confutated them.
had hard them, and thereof feared not to pronunce them suche as they are.
Thridly, quhair ye alledge that promist declaration of the saides artickles, on Sunday last

Apperantlie mair lyke to seik perturbation and cu~mer, nor the glorie of God.
Als was inhibeit be my Lord of Cassillis to his returne in the cuntrie, as wrait to yow of before, for auoyding of cu~mers.
Ferdlie, gif required disputation of Iohn Villock, and als of maister george Hay, gif thay had ocht to say to ony warkes set furth be me, report me to the auditor, and als gif thay refused or not, to the tyme thay had auised with the counsell and the brethren.
Maister george Hay offered vnto you disputation but ye fled the barras.
Treulie it is not secreit, that is in the presence of al persones.
Quhair ye say ye do not of my Lord of Cassillis promes, as your person.
Treulie apperanlie ye refer als lytil his as ye may, considering ye conuoyed with one nomber of strangers as is aboue reheirsed.
Quhair ye say, ye stand in the protection of the Almichtie, swa dois all gude christiane men as ye, bot apperanlie ye put als lytil in Gods handis as ye may, that gois accompanied in euerie place, quhairsumeuer ye go with sic multitude, quhidder it be for deuotion, or protection, or rather tumultuatio~ God knawis, for knaw not.
Quhair ye wonder with quhat co~science can require priuat conference (treulie haif mony gude ressonis mouand me) first to auoid tumultuation, perturbation, and cummer.
Your reasones are as stark to your selfe, as ye think them.
Secondly, that we may haif ane ressonable no~ber that may beir witnes of baith our pairtes, but clamor or tumultuation.
Thridly, am certane gif we cum to the iust tryall of the treuth, chair man be conference of mony buikes, quhilk can not be done co~modiously in publick audie~ce.
Attoure it wilbe mair handsum and easie for me, nor misteris not sic crying out, as gif it in oppe~ audience, for gif ye victorie co~sist in clamde, or cryi~g out, wil quite yow ye cause but father pley, and yit praise be to God, may quhisper in sic maner as wilbe hard sufficientlie in the largest hous in all catrick.
Quhair ye say haif infected the earis of the simple haif wounded the hartes of the godlie, and haif spoken blasphemie in oppen audie~ce.
meruell how ye foryet your self, chidand and railland on this maner.
Considering ye said ane lytill afore, ye did abhor all chiding and railling, bot nature passis nurtor with yaw. Iohn Knox.
will nether interchange, nature nor nurtor with yow, for all the proffets of Crosraguell.
Quhairfore man beir with your babline and barking, as dous Preices, hear poweris Maiestrates, and mony hundrethes better nor I. Quhair ye esteme me as ane bragand Pastor, say and, that cht to haif respect to my haill flock.
It is question to me gif it de the weill of my flock, to mak oppen disputation in profound mysteries concerning the christiane religion, but yit will not refuse gif ony man will mak impugnation, but conuocation of strangers, or tumultuation, haif hard of publick disputation in scoulis, but not afore vulgar and rude mul+titude of people.
Ye are not then so weall ne in the ancient writers as ye brag.
Quhair ye desyre me to cum to dispute in S.
Iohnes Kirk of Air, ye may be sure will not dispute with yow thair,
for mony gude ressonis, quhilkis to write, war ouer prolitt, bot gif ye pleis to conueine according to my first writing, salbe readie at all tymes, vpon viii. dayes warning, and sall send yow the artickles viij. dayes afore to auise with.
THis letter wes none otherwise answered for that tyme, but by appointing vnto him the place, according to his owne desyre, albeit that no reason could haue required that of me.
EFter hartlie commendation, forsameklil as vnderstand thair is ane disputation appointed betuix yow, the abbote of Crosraguell in Mayboill, the xxviij. of this instant, to the quhilk am not willing that ony of myne mak disputation with yow, except it cum of your occasion, for can not vnderstand that ony erudition fall proceid to the auditor of the famin, bot rather contradiction and tumult, the quhilk.
wald sould not be for your pairt, lyke as am willing to cause the abbote of Crosraguel to dissist.
As to quhasaeuer that wil proffer them self to preach the trew word, conform to the consuetude
of the realme, may do the famin without impediment as wrait to yow of before, in ony of my rowmes.
And desires yow to write me ane answer of this writing, and God keip yow.
AFter hartlie commendation, of my seruice vnto your lordship, your L. letter dated at S. Iohnes chapell the xxiii. of this instant, receaued in Vghiltrie the xxv. of the same.
As touching the disputation appointed, the occasion did procead of the abbote, who in oppen audience of the people, did propone certaine artickles, whereof the moste part conteane deceauable doctrine, whiche nottheles he promised not onely to explaine, but also to manteane against any that wold impugne the same.
Whereof being aduertised, and so near in the countrie could do no les then offer my self aduersary to that doctrine, which am assured shalbe certaine damnation, to all those that without repentance depart this
And vpon that motiue repared to Kirkoswald, where because the abbote compered not, preached, and after the Sermon a seruand of the abbotes presented vnto me a letter, conteaning in effect, that as he had required disputation of the other ministers, so did he of me, and did appoint vnto me, that day eight dayes in Mayboill.
My answer wes, that to dispute wes hartlie content, but because had before appointed ye maister of Maxwel to be in Dumfreis that same day, desired the day to be prolonged, to my returning from Nethesdaill.
In this meane tyme by letters past betuix vs the xxviij. of this instant is appointed which day be the grace of God mynd to keap.
Nether yet in my iudgement is there any iust feare of tumult, for the persones that shall conuene with me, will promes and keap all quietnes, and of your lordship nothing dout but ye will take suche ordour with your freindes, that by them there shall no occasion of trouble be offered, and albeit that the erudicion shal not perchance be suche as the godlie wold desyre, yet dout not bothe the veritie and the falshead shall appeare in there owne colors, albeit not to all, yet to suche as ether haue eares to hear ye treuth plainly spoken, or eyes to discerne darcknes from light.
And therefore wold moste humblie require of your lordship, rather to prouoke and encurage your freind to the said disputation, then in any maner to stay him, for if your lordship do co~sider that whil, that he oppenlie preaches one
thing, and we an other, that the hartes of the people are distract, yea, and inflambed one against another, your lordship should rather feare tumult and trouble to ensew thereof, then of mutuall conference, in the audience of peceable and quiet men.
The nomber is not great that is admitted to hear, and therefore trouble is les to be feared.
Please your lordship to vnderstand that the veritie oght to be to vs, more deare then our owne liues, and therefore we may not leaue the mantenance of the same, for feare of that whereof the ishew is in the handes of God, to whose protection moste hartlie commit your lordship.
Of Vghiltrie in haist the same houre your lordships letter wes receaued.
IOhn Knox persaif the policie vsed be yow and vthers, to mak my awin ay my partie.
was persuaded be my Lord of Cassillis not to rancounter yow, or
els treulie ye suld not haif passed vnrancou~tered as ye did, bot ye salbe assured sal keip day and place in Mayboill according to my writing, and haif my life, and my feit louse, notwithstanding ony writing that is cumin to me, fra my Lord of Cassillis, therefore keip tryst, and excuse yow not vpon my Lorde of Cassillis writing, notwithstanding that knaw it is purchest be your policie,
to put me to schame, and your self to aduansment, quhilk sall not ly in your power, thairfore assure yow, in cace sould do the samin with the haissart of my lyfe, do ye the lyke without excuse.
Attoure that thair be na conuocation bot conforme to your writing, or els thre scoir at the maist, of the quhilkis tuentie to be auditors on ather syde.
IOhn Knox and baiillies of Air, this present is till aduertise yow that ressaued writing and credit with this gentle man, fra my Lord of Cassillis, certifi and me that he will keip day appointed for our disputation, thairfore keip your promes, and pretex na ioukrie be my Lorde of Cassillis writing.
TO nether of these did answer otherwise, then by appointing the day, and promising to keap the same.
For can pacientlie suffer wa~tone men to speak wanto~lie, considering that had sufficientlie answered my Lord of Cassillis in that behalf.
SOme other letters are omitted because they were of les importance, follow the condictons.
THe day houre, condicions and nomber aggreid vpon, for the co~ference betuix maister Quintyne Kennedy abbote of Crosraguell, and Iohn Knox minister at Edinburgh.
The place the Prouestis place of Mayboill, the houre to conuene is at eight houres before none, the day foresaid, the nomber for euerie part shall be fourtie persones, by there Scribes learned men, with so many mo as the hous may goodly hold, be the sight of my Lord of Cassillis.
And heirupon, bothe the said abbote and Iohn Knox are wholylie and fullylie agreed.
In witnes whereof they haue subscriued these presents with there handes.
Crosraguell Iohn Knox THe nomber receaued within the hous foresaid, and so many besydes as pleased my Lord and his freindes.
Iohn Knox addressed him to make publict prayer, whereat the abbote wes soir offended at the first, but whil the said Iohn wold in no wise be stayed, he and his gaue audience, which being ended, the abbote said be my faith it is weil said.
And so after that he had spoken certane wordes, he comman+ded one of his Scribes to read openly his protestation as followeth.
Heir followes the coppie of the ressoning quhilk wes betuix the commendator of Crosraguell and Iohn Ki in Mayboile concerning the masse, in the yeare of God.
PErceauing the great perturbation con+trouersie and debeate, quhilk is stirred vp laitlie in all Christen realmes, for the cause of religion (honorable auditor) and als being remembred of the terrible se~tence conteined in scriptures toward all negligent pastors in this dangerous tyme.
was constrayned in conscience notwithstanding my great inhabilitie, as it pleased God to support my imperfectiones to giue instruction to all those co~mitted to my cure, within my Kirk of Kirkoswald, how they shoulde be able to be enarmed against all wicked and decetfull preachers quhilk gaes about not knowing they come, nor by ordre.
And to the effect that our flock micht haue bene the more able to haue bene warre with all fals wicked vngodly doctrine.
Amang other godlie lessones conteined in my exhortation inserit certane catholick artickles hauing their warrand of the scrip+tures of almighty God, according to ye doctrine of the halie catholicke Kirk, and burdyned my
conscience in the presence of God the saides artickles to be godlie, necessarie and expedient to be beleued by all good christiane men.
Iohn Knox vpon sonday the aucht day of September, came vnto the said Kirk of Kirkoswald, being certefied that might not be present, and as was enformed to make impugnatio~ to my saides artickles wherethrough wrote to him, certifying that wold affirm the saides artickles, and in speciall the artickle concerning the masse against him or quhasoeuer pleases to make impugnation there to vpo~ aucht dayes warning, the place being in any hous of Mayboyle, the nomber tuentie on either syde, without any further conuocation.
Shortlie we being agreed by writing of the day hour and place, quhilk was the
am co~men conforme to my writing to affirme the saides artickles as they are written, beginning at the artickle concerning the masse.
Protesting alwayes that come not to dispute any of my artickles as maters of faith religion disputable, co~sidering there is ordre taken alreadie by the Kirk of God (as wold say) be the generall councelles, deulie co~uened quhilk represents the vniuersal Kirk of almighty God to whom it apperteines to take ordre quhensoeuer question rises for maters concerning faith and religion, but according to the doctrine of S. Peter and als S. Paule to render my dett and duetie to all that inquires therfore: and after that maner to abyde gentle and
formall reasoning of all that pleases, as may stand to the glorie of God and the instruction of the auditor.
And to the effect foresaid that we may come to formal ressoning, as to ward the artickle co~cerning the masse, wil ground me vpon the Scriptures of almightie God, to be my warrand co~forme to my first co~firmation, quhlik was gathered vpon the priesthead and oblation of Melchisedec: and was presentet you in Februare, and as yit has gotte~ no answer, notwithstanding that it was of sober quantitie sextene or lynes.
Wherfore please you to receaue this same confirmation yet as of before for to be the beginning of our formall reasoning, concerning the artickle of the masse in maner as after followes.
The Psalmest als the Apostle S. Paule affirmes our Saluiour to be an priest for euer, according to the ordure of Melchisedec, quha made oblation and Sacrifice of bread and wine vnto God as the Scripture plainly teaches vs: now will reason on this maner.
Read all the Euangell wha pleases, he sall find in no place of the Euangel quhere our Saluiour vses the priesthead of Melchisedec, declaring him self to be an priest after the ordor of Melchisedec, but in the latter Supper, quhere he made oblation of his precious body blude vnder the forme of bread and wine prefigurate by the oblation of Melchisedec: then are we compelled to affirme that our Sauiour made oblation of his bodie blude in the latter Supper or els he was not an priest according to the
Iohne Knox protested that he mght haue the coppie of this formar writting giuen in by my Lord in writ, to answer therto more fullie, at greater leaser, which was deliuered vnto him.
And in lykemaner, my Lorde protested that he might haue place to reply, if he thoght good.
The answer of Iohn Knox to the Abbottes oration, giuen in by the Abbote before the disputation, in writ.
WHen&soeuer it pleaseth God of his great mercy, to shew the light and to blow the trompet of his true word vnto the blind vnthankful world, after darknes and lo~g silence, it hath the stre~gth to moue and walken not onelie the chosen, but also the reprobate, but in diuerse maner: for the one it walkeneth, from ignorance, error, supersticion, vanitie, and horrible corruption, to walk before there God in knowledge, veritie, true seruing of his maiestie, and in puritie of life.
But the other it walkeneth from there formar and yet to there further co~demnation.
For suche as in the time of darknes did liue as men without God, at ye sound of the trompet, calling them to repentance, addes and ioynes to there format corruption, blasphemie against God, and against his eternal veritie.
discouereth there turpitud, and that the trompet wil not suffer them to slepe, as that they did before without open reproche:
they shame not to call light, darknes: darknes, light: good, euil: and euil, good.
And to bring that to pas, to wit, that the light shine no more, doeth the whole ba~d of suche as oppone them selues to the veritie of God, so earnestlie trauell, that stugardes and effeminat men become actiue and strong Souldioures to the Deuil.
The exemples hereof are in Scriptures so co~mon that they nead no long rehearsal.
For what was the estate of the fals Prophetes and Preastes in the dayes of Isayas, Ieremie, Ezechiel, Micheas and the rest of the true Prophetes of God.
What care (I say) they which by ordinarie successio~ oght to haue teached the people of God, tooke ouer there charges, the complaintes attestations of the true Prophetes vsed against them do witnes.
In the which they call them dum dogs, blind watchemen, suche as regarded nothing but ambition, tyarous cheare and lustes of the flesh.
Pastors that fedd not the flock, but fedd them selues.
men from the moste to the least, giuen to auarcie, apostattes that had left God, his lawes, statutes, and ordinances, and had laid them selues doun to sleape in the middes of corruptio~ out of the which they could not be walkened.
But yet how vigilant and actiue they were to resist the true Prophetes and the doctrine offred
For then wes Isayas and suche as adheared to his doctrine,
holden as monsters in the eyes of the proude preastes,
Then was Ieremie accused of treason, cast in presone, and dampned to death.
Then wes Micheas openly striken vpon the mouth, and briefly then did none of the true Prophetes of God escape the hatred and cruel persecutio~ of those that clamed the title and authorie to rule in the Church.
The same may be sene in ye dayes of Iesus Christ: for how negligent and careles wes the whole leuiticall ordor (a few excepted) these wordes of our maister Iesus Christe do witnes.
wo be vnto you Scribes and Pharises Hipocrites, for ye steak the kingdome of heauen before men: ye your selues do not enter, and suche as wold enter ye suffer not.
But when the trompet began to blowe in the mouth of Iohn the Baptist, and when Iesus Christe began to preache to make mo disciples then Iohn did, when Iohn called them progenie of vipers and Iesus Christe did terme them blinde guides, how careful was the whole rable then?
For then were ambassadours send to Iohn to knowe by what authoritie he made suche innouation amo~ge the people and in the religion of God.
Then was he accused for breaking of the tradicso~es of the ancients.
Then was he cal+led Beelzebub, And in the end he was procured to be hanged betuex two theues.
diligence wes all this broght to pas? wes it not by them who before had abused the law? blinded the people, deceaued the simple, and vnder the title and name of God had sett vp the deuil and all abomination to ring ouer men?
For in place of Gods true worshipping they had erected a market,
The eiection whereof did so enrage those dum dogs that with an bay they began to barke against Iesus Christe,
and his moste holsome doctrine: and that because the zeale of that great God, their bellie, did altogether consume and eat the~ vp.
These thinges we knowe to be moste true, and therefore we oght not to wo~der albeit the true worde of God reteane the own nature, and that the self same thing chance now in our dayes that heretofore hath bene fully performed.
As for my self nothing but the great perturbation, controuersie, and debate, lastly stirred vp in all christen realmes, for cause of religion, is the cause that my Lorde abbote hath of lait dayes troubled to vnaccustomed
For if the supersticion, idolatrie, pride, vaine glorie, ambition, vniust possessions,
superfluous rentes and filthy liuing vsed manteyned heretofore by suche as clame the name and authoritie of the Church had not bene openly rebuked and a parte therof in dispyte of Sathan supressed it may be thoght that my Lorde in this his impotent age could haue contented him self with the self same ease and quietnes that in his yonger
But now the tro~pet soundeth dampnatio~ to all negligent pastors, and thereof is my Lorde afrayed, and therefore to discharge his conscience he wil take the paine to instruct his flock, to warne them to be ware of fals teachers.
wil interprete all to the best part, if my Lordes eye be single, his worke is good.
But if the light that appereth to be in him,
and in his sect, be nothing but darcknes, how great shall the darcknes be? my Lorde is a clerk nedeth no interpreter of suche places of Scripture.
Yet for the simple (I say) that rightlie to teach the flock of Iesus Christe,
For els a zeale without knowledge is nothing but the cause of further blindnes.
Yea, if the blinde lead the blinde, the ignorant idolater take vpon him to teache the ignorant people of lo~g time broght vp in idolatrie: neither of bothe can escape condemnation so long as they follow that traine.
And therefore it wil nothing vnburding my Lordes conscience albeit that after his negligence and lo~g sile~ce he begin to cry to suche as he tearmes his bewar of fals prophetes.
For it may be that him self be one of that no~ber.
Yea, perchance the falsest that they haue harde this hundreth year.
For if he be a fals Prophet that teacheth men to follow strange Gods, that prophecies a lie in the name of the Lorde,
and speaketh to the people the diuination and deceat of his own hart,
that causeth the people to erre, and leaue the old pathes, and to walke in
That constantlie say to them that haue prouoked God to angre.
And to all that walk after the lustes of there own hartes there shal no euil chance vnto you. &c.
they be fals prophetes that be auaricious and studie for adua~tage, that sowe pilloues vnder the arme hoilles of wicked men, and lay sinners a sleap,
and promes life to them, to whome they oght not to promes it.
If these be fals prophetes (I say) as the Scripture effirmeth them to be, then standeth my Lorde abbote in a wonderous perplexitie and suche as beleue him, in no les danger.
For God hath neuer pronunced, suche artickles as my Lorde calleth holsome doctrine, the chief of them, to wit, the masse, purgatorie, praying to sainctes, erecting of images suche other, haue no assurance of Gods worde, but are the meare dreames, statutes, and inuentions of men, as there particuler examinatio~ (if my Lord pleaseth to abyde the tryal) wil more plainlie witnes, therefore, it is no sufficient assurance to the conscience of the auditure, that my Lord burden his co~science, in the presence of God that his artickles be godly, necessar, expedient to be beleued.
For so haue euer the fals Prophetes done, when they there doctrine, was impugned.
Did not the prophetes and preasts of Baal affirme there doctrine religion to be godlie, against the prophet Elias?
They did not onely burden there conscience, but also offred them selues, to suffer
tryal (God him self being iudge) before ye King and before the whole people.
The self same thi~g did the fals prophetes against Micheas and Ieremie, and therefore yet againe say my Lords conscience (if a blind zeal be worthy of the name of conscience) will neither saue him self nor others, because it is not grounded vpon God, his reueilled wil nor promes.
If my Lorde thinketh that the holy catholick Church is sufficient assurance for his conscience, let him vnderstand that the same buckler had the fals prophetes against Ieremie for they cryed,
the temple of the Lorde the temple of the Lorde, the temple of the Lord, but as he with one stroke did brust their buckler a sonder, saying put not your trust in leing wordes: so say we that how catholick (that is vniuersal) that euer their Churche hath bene, holy are they neuer able to proue it, neither in lyfe, making of lawes, nor in soundnes of doctrine, as in my answer giuen by mouth, haue more planely shewen.
It pleaseth my Lorde to terme vs, wicked and deceatful preachers, who go about not knowing wherefro we come, nor by what ordoure, further he feareth not to pronu~ce our doctrine, fals wicked, and vngodlie, for of vs, our doctrine it is plane that my Lorde ment and meneth.
answer that as by Gods worde, we accuse the whole masse of mannes nature, of corruptio~, and wickednes, so do we not flatter our selues, but willingly confesse ourselues so subiect to corruption and naturall wickednes, that the good
that we wold do, we do it not, but the euill that we hate, that we do.
Yea, we do not deny but that in our liues and outward co~uersation there be many things bothe worthie of reformation and reprehension.
But yet if our liues shalbe co~pared with the liues of them, that accuseth vs, be it in general or be it in particular, we doubt not to be iustified, bothe before, God and man.
For how many ministers this day within scotland, is my Lorde abbote (ioyning with him the whole rable of the horned Bischoopes) able to co~uict to be adulterers, fornicators, dronckards, bloodscheders, opperssors of the poore wedow, fatherles, or stranger, or yet, that do idilly liue vpon ye sweat of other me~nes browes.
And how many of them from the hiest to the lowest, are able to abyde an assyse of ye forena~ed crimes.
And yet shal we be called by the~ wicked and deceatful preachers, euen as if ye strongest moste co~mune harlot, yt euer wes knowe~ i~ the bordell, should sclander reuile an honest pudick matro~.
The deuil as that he is perpetuall enimie to treuth and to ane honest life, so is he a lear and accusar of our brethre~, and therefore albeit suche as serue him in idolatrie and all filthines of life, spew out against vs, there wennome and leis, wt testimonie of a good conscience, we refer vengance to him, to whome it aperteineth, neither yet wold we haue ones opened our mouthes for the defence of our owne innocencie (for God be praised, euen before the world it will vtter the
self, war not that in sclandring our liues, they go about, to deface the glorious gospel of Iesus Christe, whereof it hath pleased his mercie to make vs ministers: and in that eace, let them be assured, that the lies which without shame assurance, they causies womet out against vs, with shame and double confucion they shal iustlie receaue againe in there owne bosomes.
If my Lorde abbote alledge, that he accuseth not our liues and external conuersation, but our doctrine which he termes fals, wicked, and vngodlie, we answer, that as that doeth more greiue vs, nor the sclandring of our liues, so doubt we nothing, but that he that made his fauorable {pro}mes, to afflicted Ierusalem in these wordes:
All instrument that is prepared against thee, shal not prosper, and euerie toung, that shal rise against thee in iudgement, thou shalt rightlie conuict and condeme of impietie.
We doubt not (I say) but the same God, will in this our age, confound the tounges, that oppone them selues to his eternal veritie, which is the grou~d, and assurance of our doctrine.
And therefore we nothing feare to say, that my Lorde in the end shal spead no better (if he continew, in that his irreuerent rayling) then suche as heretofore, haue blasphemed Iesus Christe, and his eternall veritie, to the which albeit for the present, they wil not be subiect, and that because our persones and presence whome God maketh ministers of the same, are contemptible and despysed, yet in the end, they shal feal, that in rebelling against
our admonicions, they were rebellious to the mouth of God, and in defasing vs, they haue dispysed, the eternal Sonne of God, who of his mercie, hath sent vs, to rebuke there impeitie, and to reduce to knowledge, and vnto the true pastor againe, suche, as through blind ignorance, haue followed the inuentions, and dreames of men: and haue soght iustice, remission of sinnes, and reconciliation with God, by other meanes then by Iesus Christe, and by true faith in his blood.
But of this point, knowe my Lorde moste doubtes, To wit, whether God hath sent vs, or not? For my Lorde sayes we go about, not knowing wherefro we come, nor by what ordor, we answer, that in our consciences we knowe, and he him self, wil beare vs record, that we are not sent by that Romane Antichriste, whome he calleth Pope, nor yet from his carnal Cardinalles, nor dum horned Bischoppes: and thereof we reioyse, Being assured, that as we are not sent by Christes manifest enimie in the earth, so are we sent by Iesus Christe him self, and that by suche ordor, as God hath euer kept, from the beginning, when publick corruption entered in the Church, by sleuth, and impietie of suche, as of duetie oght to haue fedd the flock, and to haue reteaned the people vnder obedience of God, aswel in religion, as in life and maners.
The ordor of God (I say) hath bene in suche publick corruptions, to raise vp simple, and obscure men, in the beginning of there vocacion, vnknowen to the worlde: to rebuke the manifest defection of
the people from God, to conuict the pastors of there formar negligence, fleuth, and idolatrie, to prononce them vnworthie of there offices.
For so was Helias sent in the dayes of Ahab, Ieremie in the time of corruption, vnder Iehoiakin, and Zedechias.
Amos vnder Ieroboam, and the rest of the Prophets, euerie one in there own tyme, and after the same ordour hath God rased vp i~ these our dayes, suche me~, as my Lord his faction termes, Heretikes, Schismatikes Zuinglians, Lutherians, Oecolampadians, Caluinists.
To proue the Pope, to be an Antichr+iste, his whole glorie in the earth, to be altogether repugnant, to the co~dicion of Christes true ministers.
The masse to be idolatrie, a bastard seruice of God, yea more corrupted the~ euer was the Sacrifice in ye dayes of the Prophetes, whe~ yet they affirmed them to be abominable before God.
The defence of mannes frewill to do good, and auoide euil, to be ye damned herisie of Pelagius.
The forbidding of mariage to any estate of men or woman, to be the doctrine of Deuills.
And the forbidding of meat for conscience saik, to {pro}cead of the same fontaine.
The erecting images in Churches, in publick places of assembleis, to be against the expressed commandement of God.
Prayer for the dead, and vnto sainctes, to be work done without faith, and therefore to be sinne.
Briefly God hath rased vp men in these our dayes, so to discouer the turpitud and filthines of that Babiloniane harlote, that hir werrie
golden cuppe, in the which hir fornication wes hid before, is become abhominable to all suche, as trust for the life euerlasting.
And they haue further sett so vehement a fyre in the werray ground of hir glorie, that is, in hir vsurped authoritie, that she and it, are bothe like to burne, to there vttermoste confusion.
they are but rayling knaues yt dispytfully speak against there holy mother the Church.
haue alreadie said that the Prophetes in there dayes wes euen so rewarded of those, that had the same tytle dignitie, that now our aduersaries clame.
And yet did they not escape the plagues prono~uced, and in the same confidence stand we, reioysing further, that howsoeuer they repyne, storme and rage, yet they that are of God, hear vs, knowe the voice of Iesus Christe speaking in vs his weak instruments, and do flie from that horrible harlote, and from hir filthynes, which is to vs a sufficient assurance that God hath sent vs for the co~fort of his chosen.
But my Lorde perchance requireth miracles, to proue our laughfull vocation.
To bothe answer, that a treuth by it self without myracles, hath sufficient stre~gth to proue the laughful vocation of the teachers thereof, but miracles destitute of treuth, haue efficacie to deceaue, but neuer to bring to God.
But this by the grace of God shalbe more fully entreated, in the answer to Vinzetes questiones therevpon.
before make end, to my Lorde, and vnto the rest of the Popes creatures.
And it is this? If they will studie to keap them selues, in credeit estimation, let them neuer call our vocation in doubt, for we in continent will obiect to them, that from the moste to the least, there is none amongs them, laughfully called, to serue within the Church of God.
But all co~mit symonie, all are heretykes, all receaue the spirit of lies, and ye leprosie of Gehezi, and finally, being accused in there first ordination, they neither can giue grace, nor benedictio~ to the people of God, and this by there own law offer my self to proue, as euidentlie as my Lords Bischops, abbots, Priors, and the rest of that sect, are able to proue the~ selues, called to ecclesiasticall function (as they terme it) by there fathers bulles, and co~formation of the Pope.
wonder not a lytil, that my Lorde should alledge, that wes certified that he might not be present at Kirkoswald, the day that first offred my self to resist his vaine and blasphemous artickles.
am able to proue that by his promes he had bou~d himself ofter the~ ones to be present.
And also that by famous gentle men that same Sonday in the morning he was required either to come and teach according to his promes, and so to suffer his doctrine in audience of suche as he named his owne flock, to be tryed, or els, to come and heare doctrine, with sobrietie and gentilnes, to oppon at his pleasure.
think it shalbe as hard to proue, as to proue that Melchisedec, made Sacrifice of bread, and wine vnto God.
But my Lorde shall haue libertie of me, to alledge in suche cases what pleaseth him, so long as his allegation shal not preiudge the veritie, nor giue patrocynie to a lie, in maters of religion.
It is not of great importance, whether was certified, or not, that my Lorde could not be present, as he alledgeth.
And that is some argument, that greatlie feared not my Lordes presence.
The letters that haue passed betuix vs, together withsome answers, that differed, shalbe put in register before the disputation.
That men may see, the whole procedings of bothe parties.
And this muche by writ, to my Lordes first oration giuen in, in writ.
Now followeth my answer, to the rest, giuen at that same instant by mouth.
BEcause perceaue, bothe in your protestation and artickle, that ye dispute not vpon these maters, as disputable, but as of things alreadie concluded, by the Kirk, general cou~selles, and doctors: must say somwhat in the beginning, how farre will admit of any of the forenamed.
And of the Kirk first (I say) that acknowledge it to be the spous of Christs Iesus, builded vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets: so that into all doctrine, it heareth
the voice of the spous onelie, and an stranger, it will not heare,
And therefore if yt any multitude, vnder the title of the Kirk, will obtrude, vnto vs, any doctrine necessar to be beleued to our saluation, and bringeth not for the same, the expres worde of Iesus Christ, or his Apostles, &c. men must aperdone me, althogh acknowledge it not to be ye Kirk of God, for the reason foresaid.
And vnto the generall counselles, answer the same, to wit, that suche as hath bene gathered duelie in the name of God, for extirpatio~ of heresies, with my whole harte do reuerence.
Prouided alwayes, that the doctrine, that they propone to be beleued, haue the approbation of the plaine worde of God, or els with that ancient must say, that more credit is to be giuen to an man, bringing for him,
the testimonie of Gods Scriptures, then to an generall counsell, affirming any doctrine without the same.
And as co~cerning the authoritie of the doctors (for whome praise my God, as that do for all them whome he maketh profitable instrumentes in his kirk) think my Lorde,
will bind me no straiter, then he hath desyred to be bound him self, that is, that men be not receaued, as God.
And therefore with Agustine consent, that whatsoeuer the doctors propone, and plamly confirme the same by the euident testimonie of the Scriptures, am hartlie content to receaue the same, but els, that it be laughful to me with, Ierome to say,
whatsoeuer is affirmed, without the authoritie of Gods Scriptures, with the same facilitie it may be reiected, as it is affirmed.
Thair ar diuers heides quhair with am offended, willing that the purpose we come for, may go shortlie to passe.
And as the occasion sall serue of the doctoures, counsalles and ocht elles, quhilkis ar not expresly contened in the Scriptures.
Ye are not ignorant (my Lorde) that in euerie disputation, the ground oght so to be laide, that ye mater disputable, or the question, either come vnder an perfite definicion, or els vnder an sufficient discription: and specially when the question is, De woce simplici.
Yf it please your Lordschip to defyne the masse, or yet sufficientlie to discriue it, will take occasion of yt, which think wrong.
And if not, then must explaine my minde, what masse it is, that intend to impung, and haue called idolatrie, not the blissed institution of the Lorde Iesus, which he hath co~manded to be vsed in his kirk,
to his gaincomi~g, but that which is cropen in, into the kirk visible, without all approbation of ye worde of God.
And this masse, say, hath a name, a forme and action, an opinion conceaued of it, and an actor of the same.
And vnto the whole foure say, that neither the name, the forme and
action, nor the opinion, nor actor, haue there assurance of Gods plaine worde.
As to the diffinicion or description that gaif the last yeir, will abyde at it this yeir, for am not cu~min in vse of est, non est.
And as to ye masse that he wil impung, or any mannes masse, yea, and it war the paipes awin messe, will mantein nathing but Iesus Christes messe, co~forme to my artickle as it is writtin, and diffinition contened in my buik, quhilk he hes taine on hand to impung.
As can conceaue, my Lordes answer, conteineth thre heades, the first is, a relation to his booke as conteaning the difinicion of the masse.
And the third, an affirmation, that he wil affirme no masse, but ye masse of Iesus Christ, yea, not if it wer the popes owne masse.
That haue not red his Lordeschipes booke (not excusing thereintill my own negligence) and therefore it appeareth vnto me, that rather his Lordship, should cause the diffinition to be red out of his booke, nor to burden me with the seaking of it.
As co~cerning his lordshipes constancie, beseak the eternal God, to make vs all constant, in his eternal veritie: for inconstancie in the treuth, can not lack infamie, and great danger.
But to me it appeareth, that in no wyse it can hurt, the fame, nor conscience of the godlie, to confesse them selues men, who
bothe may erre, and also be occation that others erre.
And yet, when that the fuller knowledge commeth vnto them, by the spirit of God, no ma~ oght to impute vnto them inconstancie, albeit they retreat there formar error, as in diuers heades did that learned Augustine.
But the thride head doeth moste delite me, to wit, that my lord hath affirmed that he will defend no masse, but the masse of the Lorde Iesus:
which if his lordship will performe (as my good hope is) then dout not, but we are on the werray point of an christiane aggrement.
For whatsoeuer his lordschip shall proue to me, to be done by the Lorde Iesus, that, without all contradiction, shall embrace.
Prouiding that his lordship alledge nothing to be done, by Iesus Christe, which his owne institution, witnesseth not to be done.
define the messe, as concerning the substance, and effect, to be the sacrifice and oblation, of the Lordes bodie and blude, geuen and offered by him, in the latter Supper.
And takis the Scrip+ture, to my warrand, according to my artickle as it is written.
And for the first confirmation of the same, groundes me vpon the sacrifice and oblation of Melchisedec.
To the second, thank Iohn Knox of his prase and prayer of my constancie, and in lyk maner for christiane cheriteis saik, prase God with all my hart, for his induretnes and pertinacitie (gif swa be that he be in error) and will wish him, that he be willed to refuse his pertinacitie, as sall do my co~stancie
To the thrid, for auoiding of cauillation, mein that will defend no messe as concerning the substance, institution effect, bot that messe onelie, quhilk is institut be Iesus Christ.
Omitting to further consideration, the answer to the definition, to the last two heades shortlie answer, that praised no constancie, but that which is in the treuth.
And as touching my owen indurednes, wherewith my Lorde seameth to burden me, plainlie protest before God, that if knew my self in error, in that cace, or in any other, that concerneth the doctrine of Saluation: should not be ashamed, publictlie to confesse it.
But the last parte of my Lordes answer, appeareth somparte to varie (in my iudgement) from his formar affirmation, which tooke to be, that his lordship wold defend nothing in ye masse, which he was not able to proue, to be the verray institution of Iesus Christe.
And therefore, must haue recourse, vnto the formar diuision of the masse: which is in name, action, opinion, actor.
And humblie requireth of his lordship, that he wold signifie vnto me, if he wold be co~tent to proue the name to be giuen by Iesus Chrste:
the whole action and ceremonies from beginning, to the end, to be the ordinance of almightie God.
The opinion, which hath bene conceaued, taught, and written of it, for to be aggreable with the Scripturs of God.
of God, to do that, which he there publictlie protesteth, he doeth.
As willing that the treuth cum to ane tryall, will not trifle, bot schortlie geues for answer.
wil begin at the best first, quhilk is ye substance and effect.
And as to the ceremonies, actor and name, sal defend them abu~dantlie (Godwilling) conform to my artickle quhen cum thairto.
The ceremonies vsed in the masse, and the opinion conceaued of the same, haue bene holden substanciall partes thereof,
And therefore, oght the co~science of the weak, and infirme, first to be deliuered from that bondage.
For what my Lorde affirmeth of the masse (to wit, that it is a sacrifice) this perchance may be also alledged to aparteane to the right institution of Iesus Christe, in some cace, which ones wes woid, bothe of those ceremonies, and that damnable opinion.
am not cumin heir to mantein the opiniones of me~, but to defend ye institution of Iesus Christ, conform to my artickle.
that my Lorde is willing to defend no thing, but the werray institutio~ of Christ Iesus.
And haue alreadie affirmed, that neither the name of the masse, the ceremonies vsed in the same, the opinion conceaued of it, neither yet that power, which the actor
vsurneth, hath either the institution or assurance of Iesus Christe.
am willing to defend my diffinition concerning the messe, as haue diffined it, and takes Goddes word to my warrand,
and as to the ceremonies actor and all the rest fall defend God willing to be aggreable with Goddes word all throuch abundantlie as tyme and place sal serue beginning first at the substance and effect.
answer, that albeit in my iudgement, the conscience of man, oght first to haue bene sett at libertie, yet hoping that my Lorde wilbe co~tent, according to his promes, that the name, ceremonies, and the rest of the accidents of the masse suffer the tryal by the worde of God.
am content shortlie to enter in the bodie of the mater.
promes, before this honorable auditor, to defend that all co~tened in the action of the messe to be aggreable with Goddes word, prouiding alwayes we gang to the substance.
Your lordship is not ignorant, that in euerie difinition, there oght to be, Genus, which take your lordship here maketh this term (Sacrificium) but because the term is generall, and in ye Scriptures of God is diuersly taken, therefore, it must be broght to a certane kinde.
the Scriptures there be sacrifices called EVCHARISTICA that is, of thankes giuing.
The mortification of our bodies, and the obedience that we giue to God, in the same, is also called Sacrifice.
Prayer inuocation of the name of God hath also the same name within the Scriptures.
But there is one Sacrifice, which is greatest, and moste of all, called, Propiciatorium, which is that Sacrifice, whereby, satisfaction is made to the iustice of God, being offended at the sinnes of man. &c.
Now desire of my Lord that he appoint vnto the masse, whiche of these Sacrifices best pleaseth him.
Quhat ye mein be the Sacrifice, Propiciatorium, presentlie will not dispute.
But tak the sacrifice vpon the cro, to be the onelie Sacrifice of redemption, and the Sacrifice of the masse, to be the Sacrifice of co~memoration, of Christs death and passion.
So farre as can conceaue of my Lordes answer, he maketh no Sacrifice, Propiciatorie,
in the messe: which is the chiefhead, which intend to impung.
For, as for the co~memoration of Christes death and passion, that grant, and publictlie do confesse, to be celebrat in the right vse of the Lordes Spper, which denie the messe to be.
quhilk haue chosen, to defend my diffinition be, and artickle euen as it is writtin.
Protesting that this mekle is win, that the Sacrifice of the masse, being denied by me to be a Sacrifice Propiciatorie for the sinnes of ye quick and the dead,
according to the opinion thereof before conceaued, hath no patron, at this prese~t: am content to procede.
protest that he hes win nothing of me as yit, and referres it, to black and quhite, contened in our writing.
haue openlie denied the masse to be an Sacrifice Propiciatorie for the quick.
And therefore referre me vnto the same iudges that my Lorde hath clamed.
Ye may deny quhat ye pleis, for all that ye deny tak not presentlie to impung, bot quhair began thair wil end,
that is, to defend ye messe, conforme to my artickle.
Seing that neither the name, the action, the opinion, nor the actor of the masse, can be defended for this present, wold glaidly knowe what should impung.
and quhair ye are glaid to knaw, quhat ye sould impung, apperanlie that sould be na newinges to yow, for certifie yow ye sould impung my warra~d alledged for defence of my diffinition and artickle.
ye vnderstand the oblation made in bread and wine by Melchisedec, plainly deny, that Melchisedec made any oblation or Sacrifice, of bread and wine vnto God, and desires the text to be iudge.
It is your pairt to impung, and myne to defend, for am the defender, and salbe Godwilling.
Can impung more plane, then when denie your ground? M. Quintyne.
say the denying of the ground is na proper impugnation.
Your lordships ground is, that Melchisedec is the figure of Christe, in that,
that he did offer vnto God bread and wine, and therefore yt it behoued Iesus Christe to offer in his latter supper his bodie and blood, vnder the formes of bread and wine.
answer to your ground, yet againe, that Melchisedec offered neither bread nor wine vnto God.
And therefore it, that ye wold thereupon conclude hath no assurance of your grou~d.
Whether that the probatio~ of a negatiue, should be deuolued vpon me, especially when haue denied your chief ground, am content the learned iudge.
Moued throuch feruor of the tryall of ye treuth of Goddes worde, refuse logik captious cauillationis for the present (not perchance for ignorance) bot yt we tyne not tyme,
to finnish and establis our godlie pretence for the ease and quietnes of the conscience of the noble men heir present.
haue els protested, that abhor all cauillationes, and yet againe declares vnto your lordship, that in my iudgement it is the way moste succinct, yt your lordship proue your own grou~d, that is, that Melchisedec, offered vnto God bread and wine, which denie.
There is no mentio~ made of any oblation of bread and wine, made by Melchisedec vnto God, but onelie yt Melchisedec being King of Salem,
And that being Priest of the moste hie God, he blessed Abraham as the text beareth witnes.
And therefore say that the text, preueth not that any oblation of bread
Ye do affirm that Melchisedec brocht furth bread and wine.
Will ye deuolue vpon me now, the persone of an answerer, seing that ye refused your self of before the same? M. Quintyne.
This quhilk he calles answering, is mair {pro}perlie to be called impungnation in this cace,
in that, finding the text to serue nothing for my purpose, is plaine impungnation to my pretence.
And swa are ye cled rather with the personage of ane impungnar, nor ane defendar.
Whether that susteane the personage of an impungner, or of an defender, am not bound to answer, what wes done with the bread and wine, after that it was broght forth.
It suffiseth to me for my formar purpose, that there is no mention made in the text, that bread and wine by Melchisedec was offered vnto God.
that Melchisedec made no oblation of bread and wine vnto God.
It suffiseth to me, that in the text there is no mention made that Melchisedec, made any oblation of bread and wine vnto God, as ye before alledged, and hath laide for your ground.
say the wordes of the text ar plain that Melchisedec maid oblation of bread and wine vnto God,
and desires yow to impreue the same be the text.
For in the text there is no me~tion of oblation of bread and wine made vnto God.
And therefore am content, that the whole world iudge, whether the ground be not sufficientlie inprouen or not.
Melchisedec brocht furth bread and wine, quhilk he did not without cause, and ye deny yat he brocht it furth,
for the cause, that alledge, ergo, for some other cause.
Quhilk gif ye wil not, nor can not shaw presentlie, sall do deligence to cause the present auditor vnderstand cleirly, that he brocht furth bread and wine for the cause alledged be me.
Prouiding that gif ye will not shaw the cause presently, that ye sal haue no place to shaw it heirefter.
answer, that he broght forth bread wine, the text plainly affirmeth, and haue alreadie granted.
But that he made oblatio~ of the same, because the text {per}porteth it not, can not gra~t it.
As touching the cause wherefore he broght it forth (if place shal be giuen to coniectors, and that not grou~ded without great probabilitie, and also with sufrage of some of the ancients, to wit, Iosephus Chrysostom.)
It may be said that Melchisedec being an King, broght forth bread and
And this, for your satisfaction of the cause, why he broght forth bread and wine: euer still sticking vpon the principal grou~d.
That because no mention is made, that Melchisedec made oblation of bread and wine vnto God, deny it, as of before.
Of Iohn Knox saying is aboue reheirsed, conceaue twa heides in special, the ane is,
that Melchisedec maid na oblation vnto God, dot he did bring furth the bread and wine, to refresh Abraham and his companie.
will answer vnto the saides heides formally, and on this maner.
First wil mak impugnatio~ vnto ye last heid quhair it is thocht that he did refresh Abraham and his companie.
In that the text is manifest in ye contrar, in sa far as the text testifies, that Abraham and his company war refreshed be the spolye of the enimies, and was not refreshed,
nor mistered na refreshing of Melchisedec, quhairfore it is manifest that Melchisedec brocht furth bread and wine vnto ane vther effect, nor to refresh Abraham and his companie.
My formar proue, that Melchisedec, did not offer bread and wine vnto God, standeth vpon this ground, that the text maketh mention of no maner oblation made there vnto God of bread and wine.
And therefore in a mater of so great importance, darre not affirme oblation to be
first, answer, that there is no contradiction betuix these two, Abraham and his company, were refreshed of the spoolies of there enimies: and Abraham and his company were refreshed of the liberalitie of Melchisedec.
And first, because in the tyme when Abraham and his company receaued there nourishement of the substance of there enimies, they were out of the presence of Melchisedec: and not returned vnto there cou~trie.
But albeit that they had bene euen in the presence of Melchisedec, yet they might haue bene nourished, partlie be his liberalitie, and partlie be there owne prouision.
And thridly because the text doeth not affirme that Abraham and his, wer nourished onely of the spoile.
For satisfaction of the auditoure, and to cum quicklie to the point without drifting of tyme will refuse reasoning, after scoolmaner, and will go yit to the text, and depend thairupon.
And on this maner sayaud (Saif onely that, quhilk the yong men hes eatin) inferr of this text, that it dois appeir, ye and is manifest, that thair remaned mair nor was eitin, be Abraham and his company, for the present.
do not deny, but there remaned substance, which wes neither eatin nor consumed by Abraham and his company, but what shalbe hereof
infer yat not onely thair remaned substance, bot thair remaned mekle mair substance, nor Abraham and his company was able to consume, yea, and to gif ane great deale away, for quhy, Abraham was victor of foure Kingis, quhairthrouch he obtened ane great spolye, not onely of foure, bot also he gat the spolye of vther fyue, and gat all thair viuers and meat, quhairthrouch it is manifest be ye verray plaine text that Abraham and his company, had mekle mair meat nor they war able to consume, and swa mistered he nor his company na refresching of Melchisedec, considering he and his company was bot ane meine nomber (as wold say) thre hundreth auchtene.
The victorie of Abraham is in the text specified, as also the nomber of the Kinges vainqueshed.
And that there remaned substance, yea, mekle more then was spent; do not deny.
But this wil not necessarlie conclude, but that Melchisedec of his liberalitie broght forth bread and wine, to the purpose forsaid: as be coniecture, is moste probable.
For men of godlines and ciuill honestie, do not onely shaw them selues, liberal in tyme of extreme necessitie, but also wil declair there beneuolence without great neid, yea, and in greatest aboundance.
will desire him to declair his opinion, conforme to the text, quhither Abraham and his company, recouered of the nyne Kingis spolyeis bread and wine, and vther sustenance, quhilk treulie, albeit the text do not proport the same in plaine wordes, yit can na man of iudgement think vtherwise, as can gif many hundreth examples in the Scriptures, and ane in speciall, quhair Iesus Christ our Lorde speakis in his awin prayer, called the Pater noster, of daylie bread, quhairinto is to be vnderstand all required vnto the sustentation of man, albeit the text dois not expresly declair the samin.
haue spoken of substance in generall, so instructed by the plaine text, which maketh mention neither of bread nor wine, in expressed wordes, other nor of that which Melchisedec broght forth.
And by all apperance, there could not any great store, of bread and wine be caried back againe, by Abraham and his company, after the victorie of his enimies.
For plaine it is, that he broght nothing back, which they before did not carie away (him self and his company onely excepted) we read that they toke the pray of Sodom and Gomorra, and caried with them the substance,
Now albeit that in the beginning there victualles had bene great, yet being suche a company as we may iustlie suppose them to haue bene: and also being arriued within there own costes, it is not appeari~g that great store wes reserued.
But howsoeuer it be, this mater standing in co~iecture, we wil of necessitie conclud no thing, seing that the holie Ghost hath not expressed it.
acknowledge with his lordschip that to be the familiar phrase of the Scripture, that vnder the name of bread, is commonly taken all thinges necessar for the vse of ma~nes bodie, like as these, Frange efurienti panem tuum. &c. M. Quintyne.
Hauand consideration, that Iohn Knox, wald cast in ane suspicion in the hartes of the honorable auditor (saifand his pardone) be continual repeticion of this word coniecture, we wil do as God will giue vs grace, to tak this policie out of the hartes of the auditor, and that by proper discription of argumentes of inferrence or coniecture, quhairfore the auditor sall consider, that thair is sum conietures and argumentes of inferre~ce quhilk necessarlie concludes and followes vpon.
And arcalled nottheles argumentes of coniecture or inferrence, because the ane worde is not the other, nor dois not expresly conclud the other, as for ane familiar example, Spirat, ergo viuit, as wald say, he aindes ergo he liues.
Quhairfore infer that this conference of phrase, or maner of speach quhair it is said in the text, al thair victuallis, necessarly inferris breid wine, and all vther thingis expedient to be eatin, co~sidering thair was great aboundance in the citeis quhilk war spolyeit as do this phrase, break vnto the hungrie thy bread, and swa quhatsumeuer
may be inferred of the ane phrase, necessarlie may be inferred of the vther.
Hitherto haue trauelled, to make difference betuix that, that man of necessitie is bou~d to beleue, and that which man may either beleue, or not beleue, without any hurt of conscience.
What God in expressed wordes and sentences, hath committed to vs within the Scriptures co~manded the same to be beleued, he requireth of vs that necessarlie we beleue the same.
But where the spirit of God hath keped silence, and hath not in plaine sentences, declared vnto vs the will of God our Father, there may a man suspend his iudgement, without hurt of conscience, yea, and more sure it is, not bouldlie to affirme, that which is keped close, by the wisdome of God: then that we should rashelie affirme any thing, without the warrand of Gods worde as we are taught by the admonition of Augustine.
know bothe the strength of them, that are called Necessario Concludentia, and of those whiche stand in probabilitie,
which bothe grant to haue the strength in persuasion: but the faith of man requireth a surer ground, then any argument that can be deduced from nature (to wit) it requireth hearing, and that hearing of the worde of God, according to the doctrine of the Apostle.
Now to my Lordes argument, say it doeth not necessarlie conclude, that Abraham and his souldiors broght more reddie meat, suche as bread and
wine back from there victorie, then they were able to spend, albeit that they caried with them the whole substance, yea,
the whole victualles of Sodom and Gomorra. &c. Because that in the iorney some might haue bene lossed, in the iorney no dout but muche wes spent, and in the victorie the rest might haue bene dispersed or lost.
For by all apperance Abraham had smal respect to bread wine,
more then to that which might reasonablie susteane him and his company vnto there returne.
And thus from coniecture we shal co~tinually pas to co~iecture, onles that my Lord be able to proue, that the text affirmeth in plane wordes, that suche superflouous aboundance of bread and wine wes broght back, vnto the time that Melchisedec met him (& althogh his Lordship be able so to do as am assured no man is able) yet shal alwayes Melchisedec and his libiralitie stand still vnconuicted.
To meit all the heides co~tened in Iohn Knox, partickle aboue rehearsed, notwithstandinge appearanlie am constrained to the same.
And first quhair he makes ane meine, that go by naturall ressonis to persuade, to take the suspicion of men iustly of me in this heid, say and do affirme, yt haue done not in that cause as yit, bot co~forme to the Scriptures althrouch.
And quhair Iohn Knox speakis in general of meat, our contention was for bread and wine, quhilk inferred necessarlie of the text.
ane resson schortlie, grounded vpon the Scripture, quhairfore the phrase alledged be me concerning the meat sal not include bread and wine asweil as his phrase concerning the bread, be his opinion, without expres Scripture sall include all kinde of vther meatis.
purge me first, that neither burden my Lorde, with informalitie, neither yet, that his lordship, trauelleth by naturall reason onelie, to persuade to man.
But because the whole state of the cause (as vnderstand) standeth in this, whether that Abraham and his souldiors broght back againe, superfluitie of bread wine or not, haue desired the same to be prouen by the expres+sed worde.
The phrase is not mine onely, but did aggre with my Lorde,
And now why think that Abraham, and his, broght no superfluitie of bread and wine back againe? the reason is, because the text doeth plainlie affirme, that victualles, besydes the other substance, wes caried away by the enimies.
But that any victualles, besydes the substa~ce were broght back againe, there is no specification.
Because perceaue Iohn Knox, dois not meit the heid of my partickle quhair do mark the conferrence, betuix the phrases of the Scriptures alledged be vs baith: quhairin (efter my iudgement) consistes the marckis point of the purpose, will trauell na further thairin, notwithstanding
And swa wil go to ane vther heid, to assure the reader that Melchisedec brocht not furth bread wine, to refresch Abraham and his company, wil ground me properlie vpon the text, and on this maner.
The text sayis, Protulit or proferens, quhilk is in the singular nomber as, ane, person bringand furth bread and wine, quhairfore necessarlie it concludes he brocht not furth bread and wine to refresch ane multitude, as Abraham and his company was, quhllk was not possible to ane person to do: but onelie to mak Sacrifice conforme to my beginning.
What haue answered, the beneuolent reader shall after iudge, to the present coniecture of my Lorde, answer that if Melchisedec allone without al co~pany had broght onely furth so muche bread wine, as he wes able goodly to carie, yet shal it not be necessarlie concluded that therefore he broght it not forth to gratifie Abraham, for an small portion may oftentymes be thankfull to many, but my Lorde appeareth to shoote at that ground, whiche haue not laid for my principal.
And therefore albeit his lordship shuld win it, yet my formar strength were litle deminished (in my iudgement) for onles his lordship, be able to proue by the {per}taine wordes of the text that the bread and wine wer broght forth to be offered vnto God, my principall ground doeth alwayes abyde.
and als the ordinarie manere of speaking, doeth often tymes attribute to the principall man, that which at his co~mandement, or wil is done, by his seruandes or subiectes, whereof offer my self, to shaw in Scriptures, mo testimonies then one, with tyme.
And yet this is not my chief ground, but this speak for explaning of the text.
Of the formar pertickle mark twa heides in speciall, quhilk dois not onely giue apperance for my pretence, bot plainlie dois conuict, as the godlie and ineffectionat reader may cleirly perceaue.
The first heid is, quhair Iohn Knox dois allege that Melchisedec brocht furth bread and wine,
to refresch Abraham and his werie companie, quhilk plainly differis fra his speaking present, say and that it was to gratifie Abraham and his company, quhairinto thair is sic manifest diffirence as it giues plaine persuasion, his ground in this heid to be nochtis.
Secondly, it is against the ordur of nature, to think that ony ane man (lat be ane King and ane Preist) sould bring furth that might gratifie, lat be to refresch sic ane multitude as, thre hundreth and auchtene werie personis.
What my Lordes iudgement doeth moue in the harts of the auditure, remitt to there own iudgement, but plainly affirme: that neither in my worde, nor in my dytment is, there any such repugnance or diffirence, as iustlie may conuict
For in my formar sayinges, my wordes were, that by probable coniecture, the bread wine were broght forth by Melchisedec, to refresh Abraham and his werie company.
that he and his whole co~panie were thereof wholylie refreshed.
And in my latter wordes, say, that albeit there had bene no more bread and wine, then Melchisedec onely broght forth, yet doeth it not thereof necessarlie conclude, yt the same were not broght forth, to gratifie Abraham.
In which maner of speach, this terme gratifie, doeth nether repung, nor yet differ, from the terme refresh, otherwise, commonlie doeth in maner of speach Benus and Species, that is to say, the more generall, and the inferior.
For in sofar as Abraham and his company were refreshed by the bread wine (were it neuer so litle) in sofar doeth he bring it forth, to gratifie him.
And thus endeth the second dayes trauell, all whole spent to answer my Lordes shifting.
Whereto he wes moued, because he wes not able to proue that Melchisedec offered bread and wine vnto God, as willinglie ones he tooke to proue.
As dois Iohn Knox, sa do with all my hart, remit me to the iudgemente of the auditor, in this heid: and will not report the heides, of his formar pertickle for auoiding of prolixtnes.
And thus beginnes M. Quintyne the thrid day, hauing this argument written in paper which he caused to be red.
Quhatsu~euer opinion is conceaued of the Sciptures of almichtie God, hauand na expres testimonie nor apperance of the same, is alluterlie to be refused (as sayis Iohn Knox him self).
Bot swa it is, that Iohn Knox a win opinion, conceaued or contracted of the Scripture, co~cerning the bringing forth of bread and wine, by Melchisedec, to refresche or gratifie Abraham and his werie company, is not expresly contened in the Scripture, nor hes na apperance of the samin: therefore it followis weill, that it is alluterlie be his awin iudgement to be refused.
Moued on godlie zeill (honorable auditor) that in this dangerous tyme, the treuth sould cum to tryall, in sic maner, as the conscience of sic, as ar perturbed (safar as lies in oure sober possibilitie) sould be establesed, and at quietnes: we set furth certane artickles (as plesed God to gif vs grace) vnto the quhilkis, Iohn Knox tuik on hand to mak impungnation: specially to the artickle concerning the messe.
Day houre place beand appointed and obserued, come to defe~d my artickles, and in speciall my artickle concerning the messe.
And according to the samin, tuik me properlie to my warrand, grounded vpone Goddes word: vnto the quhilk warrand, Iohn Knox, as yit hes maid na impungnation, bot desyred me to sustene and defend the name, the actor, the ceremonies, the opinion of men co~ceaued
of the messe, and gif it wes ane Sacrifice Propiciatorie.
beand willed, that we schortlie sould go to the ground, and effect, and substance of the purpose quhairfore we come, stude be my artickle and warrand, as they ar written: not refusand to defend, the heides aboue reheirsed, as tyme and place sould serue.
And notwithsta~ding that was sufficientlie grounded vpon Gods worde, quhilk tuik to be my warrand,
and tuik lykewise vpon me, farr aboue my habilitie, the place and personage of ane defender: nottheles throuch occasion that serued (as work will beir witnes) was co~strained to tak vpon me the personage of ane persewer, farre by my appetit, yea, and the weill of my cause: and als by the opinion of all sic as wald the weill of the samin, moued on godlie zeill (as God be iudge) that the trueth sould cum to a tryal,
to the pleasure of God, and satisfaction of the honorable auditor, beand cled with the personage of ane impungnar, expres contrar to my mynd, for sic causes as ar abone reheirsed, maid impu~gnation, not be manlie imaginationis, bot be the manifest worde of God.
first to tak away Iohn Knox conceaued opinion, that Melchisedec brocht furth bread wine, to refresche or gratifie Abraham and his werie company, called to remembrance, how that the spulyeis of nyne Kingis, and of certain citeis to, was recouered be Abraham, quhairthrouch, he and his company, was sufficientlie refresched, and had yneuch to be refresched on, swa
that they mistered not to be refreshed with breid and wine of Melchisedec.
Secondlie quhair Io. Knox maid question, that they had not bread wine.
Inferrand that in this phrase, was contened bread and wine, conforme to the phrase of the Scripture, quhair mention is maid onelie of bread, contenand all thingis necessar for ma~nis sustentacion, he find and this not sufficient satisfaction.
Yit yeid not to ma~nis imagi+nation, bot to the plaine text, and grounded me vpon the wordes of the text sayand.
Inferrand, in that it was spoke~ in the thrid person singular,
it was against the ordoure of nature, to think that ane ma~, sould bring furth (especially he that was ane King and ane preist) to tak that paines to bring furth bread and wine, that micht gratifie (lat be to refresch) thre hu~dreth and auchtene men.
could na wise bring Iohn Knox, to confesse that thing quhilk appered vnto me conforme to the Scriptures of almichtie God, and all gude resson he sould haue confessed.
as did begin, as my conclusion wil beir witnes, that he wald haue iustified his opinion conceiued of the Scripture, co~form to his awin sayingis, be the expres word of God.
And of my liberalitie wil grant him yit, gif he hes any maner of apperance of the samin, notwithstanding he said to me, he wald not gif me ane hair of his
Protesting first, that may answer, in writ, vnto the formar argument (because as perceiue it wes before conceiued in writ) enter in shortlie vnto the long discourse, made by my Lorde: not willing to answer euerie part thereof, but onely so muche, as may appear to infirme the iust cause.
And first, where that my Lorde affirmeth, that haue made no impungnation vnto his lordships artickle concerning the masse, am content, that not onelie this honorable audience, but also the whole earth be iudge, in that point.
that ether the masse, hath approbation of the plaine worde of God, ether in name, action, opinion (to witt written of the masse, taucht of the masse, and in the conscience of men, conceiued of the masse) finally that the actor therof, for his vsurped power, hath no greater assurance of Gods worde.
Which whole heades being denyed to be disputed, at the present, against my Lordrs artickle and ground, did thus reason: that his lordeship wes not able to proue that Christ Iesus, in his latter Supper did offer his bodie and blood vnto God his Father, vnder the formes of bread and wine.
His lordeship taking for his proue, the alledged Sacrifice of Melchisedec in bread and wine, offered vnto God.
did lykewise deny, that Melchisedec did at that tyme (to wit in the presence of Abraham) offer ether bread or wine vnto God, which hath bene these two dayes bypast
haue alwayes denied, that the holy Spirit, in any notable or euident place of Scripture doeth affirme suche an sacrifice to haue bene made by Melchisedec vnto God: whil ye did hear no place of Scripture adduced, for the approbati+on thereof, my Lorde demandand of me, what then thoght wes done with the bread wine, answered, that albeit, wes not bound to giue my iudgement, because that he wes bound to proue his affirmatiue (as yet say he is bou~d) and thereof wilbe content,
that his lordshipes moste fauorable freindes, of best iudgeme~t, yea, euen if his Lordeship please, the Lordes of the Session, be iudges in that point.
answered, say, that be coniecture, the bread and wine were broght furth by Melchisedec, to refreshe Abraham, and his werie company.
Vpon which occasion, his lordship (how iustlie let all me~ iudge) did cleith him self againe,
And did adduce suche thinges, as best pleased his lordship, whereto did answer, as ye whole conference will report, and as suppose, sufficientlie to euerie thing obiected, except that because my Lord did not touche the exposition alledgede by me, vpon the wordes, Melchisedec allone did bring forth bread and wine (as my Lorde alledgeth) differed to bring in the conference of Scriptures, to proue that it is an thing in Scripture verrie commone, that the thing, that is done at the co~mand of any notable
persone, is attributed vnto him self, althogh it be done, be seruandes or subiectes at his command, which do now shortlie.
It is said in Scripture, that Noie did all that God co~manded him: and plaine it is, that God co~manded him to make the Arck,
which wes i~ building the full space of a hundreth yeares.
God further co~manded him to furnish the Arck with all kynde of victualles, which the text affirmeth, that he did.
Now if we shal conclude, that Noie allone cutted euerie tree, Noie allone did hew euerie tree, and so forth: it appeareth to me that we shal conclude a great absurditie.
The same is euide~t in Dauid, of whome mention is made, that he being Prophet and King,
deuided to the whole people, yea, vnto the whole multitude of Israel, yea, bothe to men and women, an portion of bread, an portion of flesh, and an portion of wine.
If we shall think, that Dauid did this with his own hand, we shall conclude in my appearance, ye formar absurditie.
The same is manifest by many other phrases, yea, and by our daylie maner of speaking.
think my Lordes exposition coact, in that he will admit none to haue broght forth the bread and wine, but Melchisedec allone.
But howsoeuer it be, it moueth me nothing, for vnto suche tyme, as that my Lorde, in plaine wordes pronounced by the holy Goste, proue that Melchisedec, did offer vnto God bread and wine: he hath prouen nothing of that, which he took on hand to proue.
which his lordeship calleth the best, is so long in finding an sure ground within the Scripture, that the rest in the end, be found altogether groundles, at the least within ye boke of God.
And therefore desyre, as of before, to hear his lordshipes probation of the principal.
am sorie that we ar contrined on this maner, to driue tyme, ather parteis in iustification of his a win cause: bot wisses quicklie to go to the markis point, as haue euer done, conforme to my artickle and to my warrand: and makis the haile warld to iudge, quhither it is my deutie, efter formall ressoning, to defend the saides artickles, or to proue, or to impung.
Quhair Iohn Knox makis ane meine, that haue brocht my argume~ts or purposes in writ: quhat haue in worde or writ, or vtherwayes, praise God.
Bot the trueth is, according to my custome, maid memorie, efter my repose, of sic heides, as thocht, was able to haue busines ado with all.
And that did be the grace of God onely, not that am eschamed to be learned with ony man that wil teach me.
And as to the conclusio~ of his partickle, quhair he dois mak meine, yat haue na grou~d of the Scripture for the messe (as he beleuis) will God sall frustrat his expectation in that,
And assures him will God sall iustifie the messe als sufficientlie, conforme to my artickle, as he and all the rest of his opinion in christendome, salbe able to iustifie be expres Scripture, or ony vther meine, that
And that it be not thocht that thir ar wantone wordes, like as the mater sould not cum to pas, bot that wald trifle the mater: will desyre Iohn Knox maist humblie hartlie, for Christes saike, lat vs go schortlie without trifling to the purpose, and lat wark beir witnes.
And swa requires, to resume my argument, and say thereto formalie as effeires.
Because that euerie man muste giue accomptes before God, not onely of his workes, but also of his wordes and thoghts.
will make no further protestation, whether that haue defended hitherto my own opinion, or a manifest treuth, or whether that haue impungned any treuth of God, or a manifest lie (let this be said with reuerence of all persones, for the iustnes of the cause) leauing, say, the iudgement to God: say that haue in plaine termes iustlie oppungned bothe the grou~des, broght forth by my Lord, for defence of his artickle.
For in plaine wordes, haue denied, that Iesus Christe, into his latter Supper, did make any Sacrifice of his bodie and blood, vnder the formes of bread and wine, vnto God his Father.
And lykewise haue denyed, that Melchisedec did offer vnto God, bread and wine as of before.
which grou~des, because my Lorde hath not hitherto {pro}uen, must hold them as impunged and oppu~gned: euer whill, hear the ground of Melchisedec, plainly prouen, by plaine Scripture (to wit)
that the plaine Scripture say, that Melchisedec offered vnto God bread and wine:
or that it be of any plaine and euident Scripture, plainlie conuicted, that so he did.
His lordship, oght not to think it strange, althogh require to answer in writ, to that argument, which his Lordeship hath {pro}ponded, conceaued before, and co~mitted in writ, for such take to be, the libertie of all fre dis+putations.
For so long as God doeth minister vnto me, spirit life, with iudgement and habilitie, intend (by his grace) til oppu~g, that which in my co~science hold to be damnable idolatrie.
And where his lordship sayeth, that he is als able to affirme the masse (which impung) to be the ordinance of God, as that or any of my opinion, is able to proue Iesus Christe to be one substance with the Father:
with reuere~ce of his lordshipes personage blood, and honor, and with the reuerence pacience, of the whole auditor, say, that the assercion is not onelie rashe, but also moste dangerous, yea, and in a part blasphemous.
For, for to compare the greatest mysterie, yea, the whole assurance of our redemptio~, with that, which as it hath bene vsed, hath no approbation of Gods worde (for that haue impu~gned, and intendes to impung) can not lack suspition, of a lightlie esteaming of our redemptio~.
And to cut the matter short, the formar question being decided (to wit whither that Melchisedec, did offer vnto God bread and wine) offer my self, without further delay, to proue, that Iesus
Christe, is of one substance with the Father: and that by the euident testimonies of Gods Scriptures.
And therefore yet as of before, humbly require his lordeship, to prepare him for his probation of the formar, to witt, of the oblation of Melchisedec.
Quhair Iohn Knox dois affirme, that in plaine termis, he hes iustlie impunged, baith ye grou~des, brocht furth be me, for defe~ce of my artickles.
And quhair he sayes, that in plaine wordes, he hes denied, that Iesus Christe, into his latter Supper, did make ony Sacrifice of his bodie and blude, vnder the formes of bread and wine, vnto God his Father: or that Melchisedec did offer vnto God bread and wine,
answer, that it is his deutie to mak impugnation, to my assercion, conform to my warrand, for denying, is na proper nor sufficient impugnation.
And quhair he sayes, that because haue not hidderto prouen the saides grou~dis. &c.
answer, that it is my deutie to defend and not to preif, conform to my artickle, my warrand.
And quhair he desyres tyme to answer to my argument, {pro}poned this day in writ, frely grant it vnto him.
yat my assertio~ is not onely rashe, bot also maist dangerous, yea, and in ane pairt, blasphemous.
answer, that quhair he sayes, am to rashe: wis his modestnes in this samin, sic as becu~is ane sinceir christiane, like as he is reckned to
And quhair he callis my assertio~ in ane pairt blasphemous: than had bene tyme to haue called it blasphemie, quhen he had prouen it in deid sufficientlie.
And quhair he sayes, it is dangerous, thair is na danger, it be and vnderstand, as say, and treulie meines.
For am mair nor assured, that Iesus Christ our Lord, is ane substance with the Father,
als that Iesus Christ is the author and institutor of the messe.
And swa dois not ane veritie, mak impugnation to ane vther.
Bot in this maner of speaking, wil plaine my industrie, giuen vnto me be the grace of God,
willing to contrafit the wisdome and prudence, of the wise and prude~t medicinar (for we are, and sould be of resson, medicinars to the saule) for lyke as the prudent medicinar, dois expell ane vennome or poysome, be contrapoysone.
Lutherians, and Accolampadians, against ye blissed Sacrifice of ye messe, be conference with the damnable herisies of the Arrians, quha did alledge ten testimonies of Scripture for ane, geuand mair appearance, to preif that Christ was not ane substance with the Father: nor dois the Caluinistes, Lutherians, and Aecolampadians, to preif that the messe, is idolatrie: as fall sufficientlie iustifie, as may stand to the glorie of God, and weil of my cause.
To the latter pairt, quhair he sayes, to cut the mater schort, the question be and decided (to wit quhither that Melchisedec did offer breid and wine vnto God or not) he offeris him selfe
without farther delay, to proue yat Iesus Christ is ane substance with the Father.
wis of God, he and all vthers of his opinion mistered als lytle probation or persuasion, to the ane, as do to the vther, as wald say, to beleue the messe, to be the institution of Christ Iesus, as do mair nor assuredlie beleue, Christe to be ane substance with the Father,
and desyres na probation thereof: bot sall God will and preif ye ane be the Scripture als expres, as he sall preif ye vther.
And quhair he humblie desyres me, to prepair me for the probatio~ of the formar (to wit of the oblation of Melchisedec) humblie and hartlie desyre Iohn Knox, as he will testifie his feruor, that the treuth cum to ane tryall, and as he will satisfie the expectation of the noble auditor, that he will mak impugnation formallie according to his deutie, to my last argument and conclusion.
Where my Lord to vnburden him self of that, which by all reason, he oght to susteane, to wit, to proue his affirmatiue, by him self proponed,
For he that {pro}poneth for him self an affirmatiue, and his aduersar denying the same, is euer still bou~d to the probation thereof, and the aduersar hath euer still impungned it, vnto he proue it, and thereupon desire iudgement.
To the Second, stil affirme that it is his lordships deutie,
to proue his affirmatiue, whereupo~ standeth the victorie of his whole cause: wc is be me in plaine wordes denyed.
and promises vnto him an answer, againe in writ, this present conference being put to an sufficient end.
As my protestation will witnes, speak against the assercio~ onelie and not against the persone: whiche yet (in my iudgement) lacketh not suspicion of the formar crimes.
For howsoeuer my Lord be persuaded of the ground and assurance of the messe (the assurance whereof haue not yet hard) my self am fully assured, that there be mo then ten thousand, which euidentlie do knowe, the vanitie and impietie of that masse, which haue impungned: who nottheles, moste constantlie beleue Iesus Christe, to be of one substance with the Father: yea, that do beleue, whatsoeuer by the Scriptures of God, can be prouen necessarie, for ye saluation of man.
Therefore yet againe, say, that to lay in any maner of equalitie, that which is moste sure, and that which was neuer yet plainlie prouen by the Scriptures of God, to be the institution of Iesus Christ: is more subiect to the crymes foresaid, then that can be subiect to any suspicion of immodestie for my formar wordes.
How that euer my Lord vnderstandeth and meaneth, that his lordship is als able, to proue the masse to be the institutio~ of Iesus Christ, as am able to proue Christ, to be one substance with the Father:
think that an great nomber will think my lords affirmation, verrie hard to be prouen.
And my self will still continually dout, vnto the tyme, hear the probation led.
To the seuent, as touching my Lordes comparison of the mediciner, and of his lordships industrie.
What the pastors of ye Church oght to be, the Scriptures plainly do teach vs: but what vniuersallie they haue bene these nyne hundreth yeares bypast, histories, experience, and recent memorie, hath taught vs, yea, and presentlie do teach vs: to the great greif of all Christianitie.
Where that his lordship doeth in plaine termes, condempn the Caluinistes, Lutherians and Aecolampadians, of herisie: wold haue required of his lordship delay of time, according to his desyre of me, vnto the tyme, that there cause had bene sufficie~tlie tried, in an lawfull, vniuersal counsell, deulie indicted, and conuened.
But where that he compareth, the doctrine of the forenamed, with the damnable heresie, of Arrius: wold lykewise haue wished vnto his lordship greater foresight, in so graue a mater.
For howsoeuer the Arrians appeared to abou~d in testimonies of Scriptures, without all ground, indistinctlie co~gested (and that because they made no diffreence betuix the two natures in Iesus Christe,
but did foolishlie appropriat to the Godhead, that, which did onelie aperteane to the manlie nature) yet think I, that my lord shall neuer be able, by plaine Scripture, to impung any chief head, ether affirmed, or denyed, in doctrine of saluatio~ by the foresaides persons:
lyke as did the godly and learned in there ages, the foresaid damnable herisie.
To the last, haue alreadie promised to answer, to my Lordes argume~t in writ: and therefore oght not to be burdened with it now, especiallie because it is without our formar ground, and doeth not properlie aperteane to the cause.
And yet therefore now last for conclusion, that we shal not be compelled continually to repeat on thing, desyre my lord according to his deutie, and reason of disputation,
to bring forth his probation of his two formar groundes, be me plainly denyed.
This conference being ended, for this tyme, my Lorde presentlie did rise, for trouble of body, and then Iohn Knox, did shortlie resume, the principall groundes.
And because the noblemen heir assembled, were altogether destitute of all {pro}uision, bothe for hors and man, the said Iohn, humblie required the foresaid Lord, that it wold please him to go to Air, where that better easiment migh be had for all estates.
Which because my Lord vtterlie refused, the said Iohn desired when that the said conference should be ended.
of the Quenes maiestie, and her honorable counsell, that he wold co~peir in Edinburgh, and there, in there presence, finish the said conference.
The said Iohn did promes, to trauel with the secret counsel, that the said licence might be obteined.
And desired the foresaid Lorde, to do the lyke with the Quenes maiestie, whereupon the said Iohn Knox, took instruments and documents.
gaif Iohn Knox ane argument in writ, desiring him that he wald iustifie his opinion be expres testimonie of Scripture, or ony apperance thereof.
Quhairto the said Iohn required tyme to gif answer, and the tyme, micht nawise serue, of farder ressoning, for sic causes, as ar comprehended in the said Iohn Knox writing.
And as toward his desyre of me to Air, treulie it was ye thing that micht not presentlie, co~modiously do.
Bot alwayes, will copeir before ye Quenes grace, and sic as hit grace, plesis to take to be auditors, to defend the saides artickles, and in special the artickle concerning the messe, as thay ar written, and quhair it be hir grace plesure, swa that the habilitie of my bodie will serue ony wise as hope to God it sall, to quhom be praise glorie and honor for euer.
Crosraguell The answer to my Lordes last argument, proponed by him in writ, the last day of disputation.
WHat&sumeuer opinion, is conceaued of the Scriptures of almichty God, hauand na expres testimonie nor apperance of the samin: is vtterlie to be refused, as sayes Iohn Knox him self.
Bot swa it is, that Iohn Knox a win opinion co~ceaued or contracted of the Scripture, concerning the bringing furth of bread and wine, be Melchisedec, to refresh or gratifie, Abraham and his werie company, is not expresly conteined in the Scripture, nor hes na apperance of the samin, thairfore it fal wis that it is be his awin iudgement to be refused.
Yf should grant vnto you, my Lorde your whole argument, should but declare my self ignorant of the art, and lyndful of my owne affirmation: but yet had ye prouen nothing of your intent.
The chief question, and controuersie betuix you and me, is not whether that my interpretation of that place which your instance and not: but whether that Melchisedec the figure of Christe, did offer vnto God bread wine, whiche ye haue affirmed, and haue laid it to be the ground and cause, why it behoued Christe Iesus, to haue made
oblation of his bodie and blood, vnder the formes of bread and wine, in his latter Supper.
So that it rests to you to proue, that Melchisedec the figure of Christ, did offer vnto God bread and wine. &c.
And apperteines not vnto me, to proue my opinion, nor interpretation.
For supposing that my opinion, co~ceaued of that place were to be reiected (as ye are neuer able to proue it to yet is your affirmatiue, neuer the better prouen, for if ye will conclude: it wes not broght forth to refresh Abraham (which yet is not prouen) ergo it wes broght forth to be offered vnto God: babes will mock you, and send you againe to your logick.
But yet my Lord with your leaue must come nerar you, and say, that the maior or first part of your argument is fals and that ye falsly alledge vpon me, that which neuer spak nor ment.
Read the whole conference betuix you and me, and ye shall not find that haue simple affirmed that all opinion of man, conceaued of the Scriptures, is vtterlie to be reiected: onles the same be prouen by the manifest worde of God.
For am not ignorant that some interpretatio~s ar tollerable, yea, and may be to the edification of the Church, althogh they do not fully expres, the minde of the holie Goste, in that place.
But haue affirmed, and yet affirmes, that nether the authoritie of the Church, the determination of the counsell, nor the opinion of the doctor, is to be receaued in matters of faith, in the doctrine concerning our saluation: onles the same
And therfore my Lord, with your leaue, must say, that ether wilfully or els by some ouersight, ye haue omitted bothe in the maior in the minor of your argument, that which should haue bene, ye cause and assurance of your conclusion.
Whatsoeuer opinion is conceaued of the Scripture of almightie God, concerning faith and the doctrine of Saluation, hauing no expres testimonie of the same, is to be reiected.
But so it is, that Iohn Knox owne opinion, concerning the bringing forth of bread and wine by Melchisedec, is a matter concerning faith, and the doctrine of our Saluation, and yet hath no testimonie of Gods expressed worde: therefore it is to be reiected.
Yf on this maner ye had reasoned, my Lord, (as of necessitie ye must do, if ye conclude any thing against me) wold haue immediatlie denied the second part of your argument, and haue said: that to know or define, what wes done with the bread and wine, broght out by Melchisedec, is no artickle of our beleue, nether yet is it a doctrine, necessarie to the Saluation of man.
For nether did Adam, Abel, Seth, Enos, Henoch, Mathusalem, nor Noie, beleue any suche thing, nether yet is there since the dayes of Abraham, any co~mandement giuen by God, to beleue suche an artickle, yea, further in the whole Scriptures, there is no mention made what wes done with that bread and wine, and therefore it can be no artickle of our beleue, nor yet no doctrine concerning
our Saluation, and so hath your argument broken the owne neck.
Yf list, my Lord to sport a lytill with you, might find some occasion in the second part of your argument.
For where ye affirme that my opinion co~cerning the bringing forth of the bread and wine, by Melchisedec, to refresh Abraham and his companie, is nether expresly conteined in the word of God, nether yet hath appearance of the same: and therefore vtterlie it is to be reiected.
Now my Lorde giue me leaue, to turne this part of your argument in your owne bosome, if can, and that so may do, thus reason.
The opinion conceaued by my Lorde Abbote, concerning bread and wine, broght forth by Melchisedec to be offered vnto God, is not expresly conteined in Gods Scriptures, therefore it is vtterlie to be reiected.
Bewarre my Lorde, that ye be not beaten with your own batton:
for then must the masse, yea, the best part of the same, stand vpon an vnsure ground, that is to say, vpon the opinion of man, and hauing no assurance of Gods expressed worde.
But now my Lorde, meryues set asyde, humblie require you, by my pen, as did by mouth, that depelie ye consider, with what co~science before God, ye affirme ye doctrine to be holsome, yea, necessary to be beleued,
ye are able to bring no prufe out of the manifest word of God.
The second day of our conference and disputation, when wes co~strained to answer, your treuole co~iectures and vanities: your bragges and boste, ofter blowen out then ones, were, that your probation should be so euident, that the stones should heare your probation, and ye dead walles should se the iustnes of your cause.
paciently did abyde (althogh perchance with the greif of some brethren) these your wantone wordes, and thoght with my self Parturiunt montes. &c.
But what is now produced and broght forth; the world may se.
It may appeare that ye were hard beset, when for to auoide the prufe of your owne affirmatiue, ye fled to impugne, that which apperteaneth nothing to the purpose.
For as wes not bound to haue shewen vnto you what thoght wes done with the bread and wine, broght forth by Melchisedec, so wes not bound to haue defended, my interpretation and iudgement of that place: but vnto you it alwayes aperteineth (and if euer we meit againe vpon that head, it wilbe yet iudged to aperteine to you) to proue that Melchisedec, did at that time offer bread and wine vnto God, which am well assured, that ye are neuer able to do, by any testimonie of Gods worde.
And the greatest thereof, for all his sicker riding hath ones loste his stirropes, yea, is altogether set besydes his sadil.
And yet the common brute goeth, that ye my Lorde, your flatterers, and
collateralles brag greatlie of your victorie, obteined in disputation against Iohn Knox, but will not beleue you to be so vaine onles shall knowe the certantie by your owen hand writ.
Let all men now iudge vpon what ground the Sacrifice of the masse standeth.
The heauenly Father hath not planted within his Scriptures suche a doctrine.
It followeth therefore that it oght to be rooted out of all godlie me~nes hartes.

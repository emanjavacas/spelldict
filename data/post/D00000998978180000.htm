figure figure blazon or coat of arms george keith his saying that the light within is not sufficient to salvation without something else prov'd to be contrary to the foundation of the christian religion
by edmund elys

by the foundation of christianity understand the ground or reason we have to believe that jesus christ is a person to save his people from their sins his people that is to say those who put their whole trust and confidence in him to deliver them from all evil and to bring them to the everlasting enjoyment of all that is truly and really good for them
the people call'd quakers plainly and expresly declare that by the light within they understand jesus christ himself and all that comes from him tending to the conviction and conversion of sinners
now since the light within is the onely true and eternal son of the onely true and eternal god light of light very

god of very god yet but one god is it not a kind of blasphemy to say that the light within is not sufficient without something else how vain and absurd to say no worse is keith's insulting over whitehead in the pamphlet he entitles keith's second narative in these words here now at length he hath openly shown his deism and antichristian doctrine for if it be an offensive and false assertion to say the light within is not sufficient to salvation without something else the contradictory must be true that the light within is sufficient to salvation without any thing else and so without christ's blood outwardly shed and his sacrifice on the cross and intercession for us in heaven all which are something else than the light within men
answer such a proposition as this the light within is sufficient to salvation without any thing else is to be rejected for this reason that such words imply this false supposition that there may be something that is not included in the signification of undefined span alphabet goloss

undefined span alphabet
by him jesus christ the light within all things consist that is they have their being undefined span alphabet in him whose nature praeexistent to the humane nature which he was pleas'd to assume for us men even for our salvation is the one nature or being absolutely infinite
shall here recite some words of a letter sent to keith in answer to one received from him you say the light within us could not become a curse for us nor be hanged on a tree to this answer that the same person or he himself who is the light within us became a curse for us and was hanged on a tree
you say also that

god is in all the devils and he is light essentially in them all and yet would it not found harsh to thy ears to say the light in all devils is sufficient to their salvation



answ such a saying would indeed sound very harsh to my ears for god is not in the nature of devils as he is in the nature of man for our salvation not for the salvation of devils the true light was incarnate by the holy ghost of the virgin mary and was made man and was crucified also for us under pontius pilate he suffer'd and was buryed the third day he rose again according to the scriptures and ascended into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of the father and he shall come again with glory to judge the quick and the dead whose kingdom shall have no end
whosoever does not act contrary to the manifestation of his present duty may be truly said to walk in light and shall from time to time have so much explicit or implicit knowledge of what our blessed lord hath done and suffer'd in the flesh and of his intercession as the true light the infinity of wisdom knows to be necessary for him whosoever therefore faithfully adheres to the light within tho he be depriv'd of the sight or hearing of the holy scriptures of all good books and of all religious society he shall as certainly remain in a state of salvation as if he had all such outward means of grace
shall say no more at this time but that beseech almighty god to give his grace to thee and my dear christian reader that we may know the love of christ which passeth knowledge that we may be fill'd with all the fulness of god

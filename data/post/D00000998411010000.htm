For quhen a man is wreth or furius Malancolyk for wo or tedius Than is al plesance till hym maist contrare.
And semblably than, so did wyth me fare, This melody intonyt heuinly thus For profund wo constrenyt me mak care.

Thocht had profund wit angelicall.
The heuinly soundis of thair armony Has dymmyt so my drery fantasy.
Baith wit and reason, half is lost of all. yyt (as knaw) als luchily say sall That angellyk and godly company.

Scho wes peirles of schap and portrature, In hir had nature fynesyt hir cure.
As for gud hauyngis thair wes nane vot sche, And hir array wes so fyne and so pure, That quhair of wes hir rob, am not sure, For nocht bot perle and stonys mycht se, Of quham the brychtnes of hir hie bewtie.

Thus remanyt in to the garth twa houris Cursand the feildis with all the fare coullouris.
That awolk oft wariand the quhyle Always my mynd wes on the lusty yle In purpose euir till haue dwelt in that are Of rethorik cullouris til haue fund sum parte.
Becaus sa sone of my dreme escheuyt Nocht seand quhow thay wrechis wer torment That honour mankyt aud honeste myscheuyt Glaidly wald amyd thys wryt haue breuyt Had it sene quhow thay wer slane orschent, Bot fra saw all thys weilfare wes went Till mak ane end sittand vnder a tre In laude hf honour wrait thir versis thre.
hie honour swete heuynly flour degest, Gem vertuus, maist precius, gudlyest For hie renoun, thow art guerdoun condyng, Of worschyp kend, the glorius end and rest, But quhan in rycht路 na worthy wicht, may lest, Thy gret puissance, may maist auance all thyng.
And pouerale, to myche auale, sone bryng: the requyre, sen thow but pere路 art best That eftir this路 in thy hie blys we ryng.
Of grace, thy face, in euery place, so schynys That swete, all spreit, baith heid and feit, inclynys.
He docht, rycht nocht, quhilk out of thocht, the tynis, Thy name, but blame, and riall fame, dyuine is, Thow port, at schort, of our comfort, and reid, Tyll bryng路 all thyng, tyll gladyng, eftir deid.
All wycht, but sycht, of thy gret mycht, ay crinis Schene, mene, nane may sustene, thy feid.
Hail rois, maist chois, til clois, thy foys, gret mycht Hail stone, quhilk schone, apon the trone, of lycht.
Vertew, quhais trew, suet dew, ouerthrew, all vyce, Was ay, ilk day, gar say, the way, of lycht.
Amend, offend, and send, our end, ay rycht, Thow stant, ordant, as sant, of grant, maist wyse Til be, supple, and the, hie gre, of pryce, Delyte, the tite, me quyte, of syte, to dycht.
The auctor direkit his buke to the rycht nobill Prynce, Iames the ferd Kyng of Scottis.
Laud with Palm of victory The Laurere crown of infynyte glory Maist gracius prince, our souerane Iames the ferd Thy maiesty, haue eternally Suppreme honour, renoun of cheualry, Felycite perdurand in this erd.
With blys in the heuyn by fatal werd路 Resaue this rusty rurall rebaldry Lakand cunnyng, fra thye puyr lege onlerd Quhylk in the sycht of thy magnificence Confydand in so gret beneuolence Proponis thus my wulgare Ignorance Maist humely wyth dew obedyence Besekand oft thy mychty excellence, Be grace til pardon all sic variance, With sum benyng respect of ferme constance.
Remyttand my pretendit negligence Thow quhais mycht may humyll thyng auance路 Breif路 burall quair, of eloquence all quyte with russet weid, and sentence imperfyte Til cum in plane, se that thow not pretend tha Thy barrant termis, and thy vyle endyte Sall not be min, wyll not haue the wyte路 For as for me that kend tha, Thow art bot stouth, thyft louys lytht but lyte Not worth a myte, pray ilk man till amend tha.
Fare on with syte, aud on this wyse end tha. &c. Finis.

a true prophecy of the mighty day of the lord

england who lies in the faln and lost estate separated from the true and living god by thine iniquities notwithstanding

all thy profession of his name in outward forms and observations repent repent and turn unto the lord god almighty who waits on thee to be gracious unto thee and to make thee the glory of all the nations of the world if thou wilt diligently

hearken to his counsel the light that is in the conscience of every one to wait in it upon the lord god that he may guide thee by his power

and this have to declare unto thee from the lord which he hath made known unto me concerning thee england certain years ago when the everlasting covenant of life was csionrmed unto my soul in the lord jesus

christ that should go with the ransomed of the lord unto sion enquired of my god to manifest unto me where sion was that might return

thither worship him inspirit in truth there being so many confused cries in thee england who professes to worship the only true god some saying lo here is christ in the presbyterian practice so called and the independent so called cries lo he is here and the anabaptists so called saying lo he is here and others in outward forms saying he is here according as christ forerold that the time should come when they shall say lo here is christ and to there as it is fulfilled in thee but christ faith believe them not look not forth for the kingdom of heaven is within and as the lightning

that shineth out of the one part under heaven and shineth unto the other part under heaven even so shall the son of man in his day and this witness and while was waiting on my god to make known unto me where sion was the word of the lord came unto me with witness to my spirit that christ was not divided and that there was no rent in his garment for the lord is one and his people one and that all thy outward forms

of worship england where thou art waiting for christ in observations is contrary to his will for christ saith the kingdom of god is not in observations neither shall they say lo here or lo there for behold the kingdom

of god is within you and that all thy strict observing of thy outward forms is but imitating the saints practices in thy babylonish and heathenish wisdom for there is nothing but confusion in thee and that all thy outward

forms is the outward court which is without the temple that the

angel was not to measure for it is given unto the gentiles and the holy city shall they tread under foot and this was made known unto me from the lord my god to be the estate and condition thou stoodst and dost stand in england in all thy outward forms and observations having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof for under all thy profession

is most cruel oppression every one oppressing one another according unto their power from the highest unto the lowest so that the cry of the oppressed seed within the hearts of thy inhabiters england and those that are oppressed in outward oppressions in thee hath entred into the

ears of the lord god of sabboth and he is coming in power to set the oppressed free and to bring them to sion which in the eternall riches of

his love he made known to me where sion was according unto the desires he had raised up in my heart and the word of the lord came unto me saying will gather my people out of all forms and observations and out

of all kindreds tongues and nations and will pour my spirit upon them and purge away their filth with the spirit of iudgment and of burning and will write my law in their hearts and put my spirit in their inward parts and they shall not depart from me but shall be bound up in union with me in the free

covenant of life in the lord jesus and one with another in the one spirit so shall the lord be one and his people one and this is sion the city of the living god to whom all the promises of the lord are unto

the scripture of truth wherein they need not to teach every man his neighbour and every man his brother saying know the lord for all shall know me from the least unto the greatest for will be merciful unto their unrighteousness and

their sins and iniquities will remember no more

and this is the holy city the new ierusalem which iohn bare witness of wherein there is no temple for the lord god almighty and the

lamb are the temple of it and the city had no need of the sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of god doth lighten it and the lamb is the light thereof and the nations of them that are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour unto it
and the gates of it are not shut at all by day for there shall be no night there there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth neither that works abomination or makes a lye but they that are written in the lambs books of life and all that walk in the light of christ within which light exerciseth the conseience and leads into the holy city the new

ierusalem where the true worshippers of the father are who worship him in spirit and in truth and are come out of the night and need no candle neither

light of the sun for the lord god giveth them light and they shall raign for ever and ever and this is the true church in god sion which shall

become the praise of the whole earth and from whence the law shall go forth according unto the promise of the lord and the word of the lord from ierusalem then shall righteousness run up and down with a mighty stream

and oppression shall cease

and this glory of the lord was by the lord made known unto me which

shall be made manifest to the inhabiters of england if you will hearken diligently to the counsel of the lord which is the light in your consciences and in it waite on the lord to be guided by his power waited in the counsel of my god in the calling where was placed until the year
and in the eight month of the year as it is accompted of men the word of the lord came unto me saying the leaders of my people causes

them to err in drawing them from the light in their consciences which leads to the anointing within which the father hath sent to be their

teacher which would lead them into all truth to seek the kingdom of god in observations where it is not to be found so my people perish for want of bread freely thou hast received freely give and minister and what have made known unto thee in secret declare openly
which word constrained me by the power of it to leave my wife and children and to run to and

fro to declare to souls where their teacher is the light in their consciences which the lord hath given unto every one a measure to profit withall for the exercise of the conscience towards god and men and

waiting in the light for the power of christ he would lead them up to the living fountains of water where their souls would find refreshment in the presence of the lord and their bread should be sure and their water

never fail as the lord hath made manifest to my soul and to worship him in truth at new ierusalem to sing hallelujahs and praises among the redeemed sons and daughters of god in the beauty of holiness unto the lord god that sits upon the throne and to the lamb for evermore

to you rulers of england whose names will be honorable if you will honour the lord in obeying his counsel which is the light in your consciences that he may guide you in all your waies to you am moved to write thus saith the lord god almighty will overturn overturn orerturn

until have given it unto him whose right it is and he will give it me
as you have seen the power of the lord manifest on many that are in the place where you are a cloud of witnesses the bishops and the king the lords and the late parliment who all professed the name of christ but

they would not obey his counsel the light in their consciences but walked after the counsel of their own hearts and improved their power for their own ends and would have dissembled with god and the country but

our righteous god hath overturned them to their everlasting shame and contempt

now if you will not obey the light in your consciences to rule in the power of the spirit to break every yoak of unrighteousness and put every filthy and abominable thing out of the sight of the lord that the oppressed

may be set free but you will cause both smal and great to worship the image of the beast in forcing them to obey the heathenish and unrgihteous laws made by nebuchadnezzar nature proud flesh who set up himself a king to oppress all under his power and set up whom he would to rule and ranig with him over others in tyranny cruelty and oppression in all unrighteousness which beast received a deadly wound with a sword by the little horn spoken of in daniel before whom three horns fell which

was the kings power in these three nations and the horn had eyes to see what they should do the light in their conscience and a mouth which speaketh great things what they should do for the glory of god whose look was more stout then their fellows beheld the same horn made war with the saints of the most high god and prevailed against them as it is fulfilled

many of them have been persecuted and some cast into prison by their power and this is the beast that had power to give life to the image that the image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not

worship the image of the beast should be killed and this is fulfilled that when the beast received his deadly wound with the sword of the righteous justice of god in cutting down the kings power then did the other beast which was the power that reigned after him give life to the image of the beast that the image of the beast spoke and this was fulfilled in giving power to the unrighteous laws made by the kings where the priests and unrighteous lawyers and iudges that judg for rewards that as many

as would not worship the beast in obeying the will of proud flesh which is the image of the kings power he must be killed cast into prison and there starve and be broken to pieces with daniel and by the power of proud nebuchadnezz nature must be cast into places some into close prison by the wrath of proud flesh and must neither buy nor sell nor have

any benefit of the law but he that hath the mark of the beast and the number

of his name here is the patience and faith of the saints
and you saints of the most high god stand in his will for these words are sealed up until the time of the end and you shall stand in the lot at the end of the dayes here is wisdome let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man and his number is six hundered threscore and six
now if you hold up this glorious image which was set up by nebuchadnezzar nature proud flesh in humane wisdom which that image spoken of in daniel was but a type and figure of this which now shines gloriously in forms and observations and denies the life and power of jesus christ you will be found to be the strength and glory of this great image and this declare unto you from the eternal god of power you shall be overturned as all that have gone before you which have set up this great image and caused all both smal and great

to bow down and worship it the stone cut out of the mountains without

hands shall smite this glorious image and break it to pieces and it shall become like the chaff of the summer threshing floor and the wind shall carry it away and no place shall be found for it and the stone that smites the image

shall become a great mountain and shall fill the whole earth
be valigilant for the truth upon earth ye rulers of england and give over building up sion with blood and ierusalem with inquity as it hath been in this nation by all that upheld this image which the lord had overturned cast out before you and is still held up by you the heads thereof judge for rewards and the priests teach for hire and the prophets thereof divine for mony

yet will they lean upon the lord and say is not the lord amongst us no evil can come upon us
prize your time and stand stedfast in the counsell of the

lord the light in your conscience hearken unto it let it alone guide you in all your counsel that christ may be head in you all then will the glory of god be the end of all your undertakings and you will remove this filthy and abominable thing out of the fight of the lord the iudges that judg for rewards and the lawyers that plead for mony and the priests that teach for hire and set over the people to judge their causes

men fearing god and hating covetousness to judg their causes without rewards and that the people may be taught freely without mony or price

by the free spirit of christ in the hearts of his saints who cannot but declare freely as they have freely received then will the mighty power of god go along with you in all your wayes if you will stand in his counsel

and walk in his fear to depart from all evil which is the beginning of wisdom and your names will become a sweet favour through the power of the lord among his saints as all the names of the righteous are and you shall partake of the glory of the lord which is manifesting to his chosen people in this nation which he hath chosen to make known his power in exalting the kingdom of jesus christ and he will make it the glory of all the nations in the world and the mighty god of power will be

unto us salvation for walls and bulworks and we shall sit under our vines and figtrecs and none shall make us affraid and this shall be the portion of your

cup if you will deny your selves and diligently hearken to the counsel of the lord the light in your consciencs to which speak which shall eternally witness me the truth declared unto you for the mouth of the lord of hosts hath spoken it who hath raised up his own seed in his people in this nation which cannot cleave to this great image which was set up by those

that were in the place where you are which the lord hath overturned and cast out in his indignation and is not yet taken away by you and while you uphold it the anger of the lord is kindled against you
there is no peace to the wicked saith my god

thisis the day that the god of heaven will set up his own kingdom

which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left unto other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand for ever and ever
here have declared my conscience in declaring unto you what my god hath made known unto me concerning you and the nation which shall shortly come to pass he that hath an eye to see let him see and he that hath an ear to hear let him hear

to all you unrighteous iudges that judg for rewards and lawyers

that plead for mony who devour the creation and set people at variance destroy many families and delight in unrighteousness and to all

high and low who grinde the faces of the poor and cause them to groan under your cruelty and oppression hear the word of the lord

thus saith the lord god howl and weep for the misery which is coming upon you for the cry of the oppressed hath entered into the ears of the lord and he is coming to render vengeance upon you and to set the oppressed free
for the trust of your mony and gold shall eat your flesh as it were fire for you have heaped

up treasures for the last day and ye shall be cut down ye fruitless trees that cumber the ground be cast into the lake for it is the place prepared for you and for all fearful and unbeleeving and the abominable and murtherers

and whoremongers and sorcerers idolaters and all lyers shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone which is the second

death

life hating it and disobeying it it is your condemnation this is the day of your visitation prise it lest you perish in the mighty day of the lords anger which will speedily come upon the children of disobedience

in this nation and else where for the lord will make the earth as the garden of eden and hath begun his great and strange work in this nation

and is making up his jewels and gathering his wheat into his garner sons and daughters up unto himself and will bundle up you tares

and cut down you fruitless trees and cast you into the place prepared for you who defile the flesh cumber the ground and walk contrary to

the righteous law of god the pure light in your consciences to which light speak which will eternally witness me when the book of conscience is opened

to all you who have professed your selves to be the ministers of christ and walk contrary to the doctrine of christ in having the chiefest places in the assemblies standing praying in the synagogues and having

upper most rooms at feasts greetings in the markets and of men called masters as the scribes and pharisees did which christ cryed wo against and every one of you seeking your gain from your quarters as the false prophets did when the lord sent isaiah the true prophet to cry against them

and you hold up the horrible filthy thing committed in the land

in bearing rule by your means as the false prophets did when the lord sent jeremiah the true prophet to cry against them

and you seek for the fleece and clothe your selves with the wool and feed with the fat and make a prey of the people as the false prophets did which the lord sent ezekiel the true prophet to cry against

thus saith the lord will require my flock at their hands and cause them to cease from feeding my flock neither shall the shepheards feed themselves any more for will deliver my flock from their mouths that they may not be meat for them
now is the lord gathering his people from under your power which you have made a prey of and you make the people

to err and bite with your teeth as the false prophets did when the lord sent micah the true prophet to cry out against them and you cry peace as they did and he that puts not into your mouths you even prepare war against him and this is fulfilled by your going to law with poor people for your wages and others in raising persecution against every one that will not obey you in your vain traditions

wherein you steal every one the word of the lord from his neighbour in taking a part of scripture and adding unto it your wisdom and so speak of the saints conditions which you cannot witnesse fulfilled in your selves a false vision a divination and deceit of own heart

and so causes the people to err by your lies and by your lightnesse as the false prophets did when the lord sent jeremiah the true prophet who knew the word of the lord to be as a fire and hammer to cry against them and all the saints that know the word of the lord

knows it to be a fire and a hammer in them in transforming them by its power from under the powers of darknesse into the glorious light and liberty of the sons of god
see you how you dawb up the people with untempered morter seeing vanities and divining lies unto them saying

thus saith the lord as you may find it written in such a place of scripture which was spoken by the lord in them which gave it forth and thus you steal the saints words to speak of when as the lord never spoke by you as the false prophets did when the lord sent ezekiel to cry against them and now he hath raised up his sons and daughters who obey

his counsel to cry against you and this declare unto you from the lord night shall be upon you that you shall have no vision but

shall be ashamed and confounded yea you shall all cover your lips for there shall be no answer of god

wo wo unto you you murtherers of souls whose blood hath cryed unto the lord god almighty and he is coming in power to require their blood at your hands who have shut the kingdom of heaven against men as the scribes and pharisees your forefathers did in telling

people the light of christ which every mans conscience in which light he is to wait for the power of christ to guide him out of every evil way to walk in purity and holiness without which no man shall see the lord
you tell them it is the light a natural

and you will not enter into the kingdom your selves to be guided by the light in your consciences which would lead you into the kingdom nor suffer them that are entering in to enter in and

here you shut all from the kingdom of heaven which is within them in drawing them from the light in their consciences which would lead them unto the word of faith which is in their hearts the anointing

of the father wherein they need not to teach one another but as the anointing teaches which is in truth and is no lie which all the children of the lord are witnesses of in their measures who walk in the light and see your deceits how you murder and destroy souls for mony to maintain you in pride and pleasure though the light in you consciences cry against you for your practices but you hate it and will not obey it but to it speak which will witness me eternally when the book of conscience is opened to your condemnation who shut all people

out of the kingdom of god which is within them in turning them aside from the light in their consciences which the lord hath given unto every one a measure to guide them into the kingdom and then you make a prey of them in telling them they must wait for the kingdom

of god in observations which you call ordinances which you have set up in imaginations of the saints conditions which is recorded in the scripture of truth some of you say lo here is christ in

the presbyterian practice and saith another lo he is here in the independent practice and the anabaptist saith lo he is here and others that walk in outward observations say lo he is here according as

christ foretold that such should come that would say lo here is christ lo there is christ as it is fulfilled in you who draw people to seek the kingdom of god in outward observations but saith christ beleeve them not for the kingdom of god comes not with observations for as the

cometh out of the east and shineth unto the west so shall the coming of the son of man be and this witness but you turn them from the light in the conscience which would lead them into the kingdom to look forth at the glorious image you have set up in outward observations and they must pay you so much a year for it as will maintain you in pride and pleasures to be masters among the sons of men and so you worship the works of your own hands offering up sacrifice to an unknown god whom you ignorantly worship having no scripture for many things you do

there is no scripture for your call into the ministry of the gospel of christ by humane wisdom nor for your making bargains with the

people for so much a year

there is no scripture for your sprinkling water on the face of a child calling it baptism

there is no scripture for your stealing the saints words in taking a part of scripture and adding to it your wisdom tearing it in sunder in

dectrines reasons uses helps motives according unto the fancies of your brains

there is no scripture for your particular houses that you have to creep into where none must come but your selves and whom you please to declare your sermon as you call it which is a divination of your own hearts one day after another and one year after another

there is no scripture for your putting davids words into the mouths of poor ignorant people to sing praises unto the lord as lord

am not puff'd in mind have no scornfull eye water my couch with my tears all the night make my bed to swim all my bones do tremble when they cannot witness these conditions and so cause them to blaspheme the name of god
and when the light in their consciences cries against them for lying in the presence of god and blaspheming his great and glorious name you tell them it is the light of a natural conscience

and so murders their souls in shutting them out of the kingdom of god as the scribes and pharisees and all the false prophets did that denyed christ to be the light who enlightens every one that comes into the

world and here you are found to be among the false prophets scribes and pharises walking in their ways and every tree is known by its fruits which all the prophets who walked in the light christ that

was the light cryed wo against and you are all turned out of the way in rejecting the corner stone christ which enlightens the conscience of every one to guide them unto him as the false builders did and go

in the way of cain to murder and greedily run after the error of balaam who loved the wages of unrighteousness so that as a troop of robbers wait for a man so do you of priests murder in the way by consent as the priests did when the lord sent hosea the true prophet

to cry against them for you commit lewdness in turning every one from the light in their consciences which the lord hath given unto every one a measure according unto their ability to guide them up into the kingdom of god and you turn them aside to seek the kingdom in observations harkening unto the dark inventions of your

brains in adding your wisdom unto the testimony of christ and this is your portion the plagues written in the book will be added unto you
here have cleared my conscience dealing plainly with you declaring

unto you whence you are as the lord hath made known unto me that you may be without excuse in the mighty day of the lord which will speedily come upon you wherein you shall give account for the blood of souls that have been shut out of the kingdom and destroyed by you to the light in every one of your consciences speak which shall eternally witnesse me when the book of conscience is opened

repent repent and give over deceiving the people and destroying their souls and haste haste to meet the lord in returning within to be guided by his counsel the light in your consciences which you have

rejected lest ye perish in your gainsayings kiss the son in obeying his counsel the light in your conscience that let's you see the evil of your doings lest you perish in the way for if his anger be kindled a little blessed are all they that trust in him

to all you who have set up a finer image in gospel ordinances as you call them under the forms of independent and anabaptists and say you are the saints whom the lord hath chosen and have only a right to the best of the creatures to eat of the fat and be clothed with the finest of the wool and make merry with the creatures and live in pleasures

and when the light in your conscience cries against you to use your liberty but not as an occasion to the flesh to make no provision for the flesh to satisfie it and the lusts thereof but you must be perfect as heavenly father is perfect you regard it not but hearken unto the counsel of your own hearts which draws you to look at the words of

paul where he saith find a law in my members warring against the law of my mind so ye wrest the scripture to your own destruction for your encouragement to live in the flesh and say none must be free from the body of sin while he is here in the body and thus you deceive your selves and all whom you draw from the light in your conscience which cries for a perfect fulfilling of the law of god for the soul that

sinneth it shall dye though paul did complain of a body of sin it was in his growth and it was his burden which made him cry wretched man who shall deliver me and he witnessed it put off the law of the

spirit of life in christ jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death for christ is made manifest to destroy the works of the devil and not to destroy the law to save man from the condemning power of

the law while he lives in transgression of it for the law hath power over the fleshly man so long as he lives but be came to fulfil the law

and all the saints beare witness of it in their measures some witness it

fulfilled others wait following the lambe daily in the cross till they come to the fulfilling of it that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit

therefore mind the light in your consciences diligently hearken unto it and it will smite your glorious image of forms and observations

and break it to pieces and will rend off all your glorious coverings of your outward profession will let you see the wo is unto them that are covered and not with the spirit of the lord
to the light in

your consciences speak which will eternally witnesse me if you hearken unto it to be guided by it you will never find rest in outward

forms and observations but in putting off the body of sin through the obedience of the spirit that the righteousness of the law may be

fulfilled in you in walking no more after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are christs have crucified the flesh with the affections and lusts

and the body is dead in regard of sin but the spirit is alive unto righteousness and this you must witnesse or else all your religion is vain and your

souls will perish

to all you inhabiters of england how long will you drink of the

cup of abominations the wine of the wrath of the whore which hath made you drunk and all nations to lay out your mony for

that which is not bread to the merchants of babylon who fill unto you the cup of abominations in drawing you from the light in your

consciences which is given unto every one of you a measure to guide you up to god to seek for the kingdom of god in observations and christ saith it is not in observations but within so they keep you in captivity in babylons kingdom under the power of sin hell and death

to every particular inhabiter of england write come out of babylon

all forms and observations and traditions which are set up by the will of man now is babylon come in remembrance before god and the vials of wrath must be poured upon her and upon

merchants for by their sorceries are you inhabitants of england and all nations deceived and in her is found the blood of the prophets and saints and of all that were slain upon the earth haste

haste come out of her lest you partake with her in her sins and so partake with her in her punishment
which will speedily come upon her for the mouth of the lord of hoasts hath spoken it return within every one in particular examine your hearts and mind the light in your conscience and it will alwaies let you see where your hearts are and what they delight in for it is the heart the lord requires he will no longer be worshipped in words forms and observations but in spirit and in truth and in sincerity in the inward

parts therefore every one be faithfull in taking heed to the light in your consciences which the lord hath given to every one a measure to profit withall for the exercise of the conscience towards

god and men in minding your watch to wait in the light in measure it will bring to judgment all the powers of darkness in you and the righteous law of god will cry through your earthly and carnall

hearts till judgment be brought forth into victory and your wills will be brought in subiection unto the will or god to wait on him for refreshment from his presence who satisfieth the hungry with good

things and take heed of consulting with flesh and blood for that leads into pride and disobedience into hell and destruction mind the light in your conscience which is the sure word of prophecy that you cannot be deceived taking heed unto it as unto a light

that shines in a dark place untill the day dawn and the arise in your hearts diligently hearken unto it and you shall eat

that which is good and your soul shall delight it self in fatnesse there is your teacher within you the light in your consciences loving it

and obeying it is your life hating it and disobeying it is your condemnation to that pure light in your consciences speak which will eternally witness me when the book of conscience is opened in you now you have time prize it in waiting on the lord in the light to make your calling and election sure in putting off the old man and his deeds and putting on the lord jesus christ in righteousness and holiness without which no man shall see the lord in so doing you shall

escape the wrath of god which is coming upon the children of disobedience in this nation and elsewhere for the lord will make the

earth as the garden of eden and hath begun his great and strange work in this nation which shall make the ears of them that hear to tingle wherein he is exalting the kingdom of the lord jesus which kingdom shall break down all the kingdoms of the world and shall fill the whole earth for the mighty day of the lord is coming that shall burn as an oven and all you that are proud and all you that do wickedly shall

be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn you up saith the lord of hosts and it shall leave of you neither root nor branch
but unto you that fear the name of the lord shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in his

wings and ye shall go forth and grow as calves of the stall and ye shall tread down the wicked and they shall be as ashes under the soies of your

feet in the day that do this saith the lord wherein he is now gathering his elect together his scattered sheep that have been scattered

in the cloudy and dark day and will bring them from the people and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon a good pasture and upon the high mountains of israel shall their fold be and there shall they lie in a good fold and in fat

pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel and will raise up for them a plant of renown and they shall no more be consumed with hunger in the land neither bear the shame of the heathen any more but they shall

dwell safely and none shall make them afraid thus shall you know that the lord your god am with you and that the house of israel is my people saith the lord god

light which is in the conscience of every one and wait upon him to be guided by his power and all you that disobey the righteous law

of god the light in your conscience you shall be swept away with the beesom of his wrath and your place shall be no more for the

and praises to the lord god omnipetent who is taking to him his great power to sit upon his throne and to the lamb for evermore

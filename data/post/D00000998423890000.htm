GENERAL AND RARE MEMORIALS pertayning to the Perfect Arte of NAVIGATION: Annexed to the PARADOXAL Cumpas, in Playne: now first published:
[Figure: BRIEF NOTE SCHOLASTICAL, FOR THE better vnderstanding of the Decorum obserued, (or, at the least, regarded) in this present Treatise, written vnder the Names of Three diuers Proprieties, States, or Conditions of MAN: Wherby yt may appere, that they are not Scopae dissolutae: or, Du Coq l' Asne: But, by the will, and Grace of the Highest, Recorded.
First, yt was needfull, for the Vnknown Freend to declare his Sensible grief, conceaued, to see, and perceiue an honest Ientleman, and Philosopher by the malice and ignorance of sundry his Cuntrymen, to be almost oppressed, vtterly defaced, and by dangerous reports, greeuously and dammageably discredited.
And secondly, to make a mournfull, and dolefull Supplication generall, to all his Cuntrymen, to help the sayd Ientleman to haue Iustice, and due amends, now at the end of his dayes.
And all this, is the rather thus endited, that God his great Graces bestowed on him, should (to God his great glory) be acknowledged thankfully, and not be suffered any longer to be so craftily, wilfully, and violently trodden vnder foot, or barbarously despised.
And it is likely, that, vnleast this Vnknown Freend haue fauourable audience, and Credit, (in those things, which in this Aduertisment he declareth: being Sensible, both past, present: pertayning to the forsayd Ientleman,) that the Me+chanicien his industry, and great zeale, (vsed in collecting, and penning, from the sayd Philosopher his mouth, the Hexameron Plat Politicall, of the Brytish Monarchie ,) shalbe but slenderly, and slightly regarded or wayed: and therby, the same to be found, finally, to les Commodity Publik, auailable.
But, yf the same Aduertisement be earnestly, speedily, vnpartially, charitably examined, and considered, good hope may arise, that Omnia cooperabuntur ad Vtilitatem Salutem{que} Publicam procurandam, ac promouendam, expeditissimè potentissimè.

The Epistle in Meter, (annexed in the end of this Book,) was by the Mechanicien sent, after that the vnknown Freend had (at his own charges, and with his careful Trauail concurrent,) put the foresayd two Treatises, in Print: deliuered again into the hands of the sayd Mechanicien the whole Impression therof.
The diuers Intents and purposes of which are easily to be perceiued.
Therfore, yf to haue sayd thus much, was necessary, the same also may suffice.
necessary Aduertisement, by an vnknown freend, giuen to the modest, and godly Readers: who also carefully desire the prosperous State of the Common wealth, of this BRYTISH KINGDOM, and the Politicall SECVRITIE thereof.
are these our drery dayes: (my welbeloued Cuntriman) Seeing the conditions of to to many, are become such, as, to be to to curious of other Mens dooings: As though, they them selues, were superhabundantly perfect: or dwelt in Security, of not beyng at any tyme, hereafter, either surueyed, or controlled for their own.
is such, that they can, and dare, cunningly and craftily, conuey to them selues (or, to whom they list) the Title and Interest of the thanks and commendation, due to other Men: who are not of so brasen visages, as to practise such ambitious fatches for them selues, or to procure such malitious Disgraces, to other: But are of that myldenes of Spirite, as, PATIENTLY TO ATTEND THE END, which shall reueale the VERITY: when, iust gwerdon, shall to euery Man be distributed, accordingly.
and vayngloriously doting, that they can not like, consent, or well suffer any od Man, beside them selues: or, otherwise, then by them selues, to receiue due Salary, either of Credit, Commendation, or liberall Consideration: where, their word or working (directly or indirectly) may hinder the same.
Fourthly, how pitifull is the Case, that diuers, of sundry states, haue, (of Late,) become so shameles lyers, and to some priuate mens liues, (thereby) so dangerous, That, if Credit had bin giuen to them, (by other, than the light hedded sort) of such Murders and Treasons, as (most diuell like) they haue imagined, and reported to be: and withall, (wholy, of their own hellish myndes, without any spark or drop of Veritie,) haue fathered the same vpon the very Innocent (yea, so much an Innocent, as for any such thought, in his hart, at any tyme, embracing or It had bin greatly to haue bin douted that the mighty wrath of God, would not so long haue forborn the iust reuenge (of so haynous abhominacions) taking, vpon, aswell such wicked and principall Forgers, as on other the fickle fauourers, or careles sufferers of the same, any whit to preuaile.
Seeing the Prince of Darkenes hath sundry such his Factors: And yet, one other kinde, more wicked and abhominable, than the rehearsed: which are such, as not onely, they them selues, Diuelish horrible facts, but also practise other very fraudulent feats: And all, to their priuate Lucre onely: Chiefly ayding and furnishing vp their own shamefull Credit herein, with the Cownterfeting of other honest and learned Men their letters: as, written vnto them, in such their vngodly and vnlawfull affayres: Or, as falsly, reporting their Conferences had with them, to the behoof (say they) of such, as are become their miserable and Cosened Clients.
the most wily Tyrant, and Insatiable Bludsucker, layd the plat, for a wofull Tragedy contriuing: yf, the power and Iustice diuine, did not bridle his malitious Rage, and Infernall fury? How, hath he (I pray you) insinuated his Credit with some, so far, and so long since: that diuers vntrue and Infamous Reports, by their Sinister information, haue bin giuen vp to such, as haue gathered Records, of those Mens Acts, who dyed in the Cause of Veritie? And so, the same hurtfull vntruthes, beyng (yet) the rather Credited, by reason of the Dignity of the place, wherin they were enstalled, haue seemed, to the foresayd Diuelish Cosener, and also, to the Credulous Cosen (yea, and to very many others,) to haue bin a certain kynde of warrant: To the one, without feare, to Counterfet letters, or Discourses, answerable to the foresayd fowle vntruthes, vnaduisedly Recorded.
And to the other, without suspition, lightly to Credit any such matter, reported.
And, so, hath the Feend Infernall, most craftily, and vnduly, gotten the honest Name and Fame, of one extraordinary Studious Ientleman, of this land, within his Clawes: that, diuers his mere Malitious, and wilfull Enemies, do verily hope, that it is impossible, that this Ientleman, shall, with this English or Brytish State, either (during his life) be counted a good Subiect, or a Commendable, (nay, scarse a Tolerable) Christian: or, any his Acts or Trauailes, all ready past: or, other his intended exploits, of great Importance, shall be, in this Land, acceptable: or, of the people, of this kingdome, receyued: as, by the fauour, light, and Ayde of the Blessed Trinitie vndertaken, inuented, Compassed, and atchieued: but, rather, by wicked and vngodly Arte, to be framed: and, by the help of Sathan or Beelzebub to be finished: vnleast, the wise, or the peculiarly chief Authorized, will vse due Carefull, and Charitable Discretion, From henceforth, to repres, abolish, and vtterly extinguish this very Iniurious Report, (for these xx. yeres last past, and somwhat longer,) Spred Credited, all this Realm ouer: it is to wete, That the Forsaid Ientleman, is, or was, Not onely, a
Great doer therin: Yea, The Great Coniurer: so, (as some would say,)
Before, that the (mentioned) Diuelish Cosening was vsed: this sklanderous vntruthe was recorded, and Credited: But, by these new deuised Cosening forgeries, the same, may (with some) seeme to be vndoutedly confirmed.
Oh Lord, with how tickle and strong Snares, and with how wily Laberinthes, hath the most enuious Traytor, to the honor of our God and Christ, bewrapped and Daunted many a thousand of simple honest Mens fantazies: inducing them, to Credit this Infamous Report? To Credit it, (I say) in respect of the honorable Seat, wherin, it was, (very vnaduisedly) set downe.
In dede, euen he: who, at the beginning, sayd, Ascendam in Coelum, similis ero Altissimo: euen he, hath setled this intolerable sklander of the vertuous, among the glorious Renown of the Righteous: to so great hurt, and dammage of the Ientleman (who, to all other Men, is harmles) as, neuer to him, by any one Mortall Man, the iust Amends, can duly be made.
would to God, this foresaid sklander, and other Disgracing Reports, to to rashly, and euen then recorded, when this Courteous Ientleman was also a prisoner himself: (& bedfellow, with one Maister Barthelet Greene) had bin, in due tyme espyed, and vtterly cancelled, and razed out of all Records, wherin they were vnduly, and vnaduisedly (first) admitted.
Nerer to pres this Matter in particular, it is nedeles.
But, by this, and such like foule ouersight of Man, Cruell despite of the hellish Enemy, it is come to pas (among many other great Inconueniences) that, wheras the said Studious Ientleman, hath at God his most mercifull handes, receyued a great Talent of knowledge and Sciences: (after his long, painfull, and Costly Trauails, susteyned for the same:) and both by God, being warned, and, of his owne disposition, desirous, not onely to enlarge and multiply the same, but also to communicate to other: He findeth himself, (now, at length), partly forced, somwhat to yelde to the wickednes of these tymes, (being not possible to sayl against the windes eye): And partly demeth himself (in Gods Iudgement,) excusable, not to bestow any more of his Talent Carefull Trauailes, vpon the Ingratefull and Thankles: Nay, vpon the skorners and Disdainers of such his faythfull enterprises: vndertaken chiefly, for the Aduancement of the wonderfull Veritie Philosophicall: And also, for the State Publik of this BRYTISH MONARCHIE, to become florishing, in HONOR, WEALTH, and STRENGTH: as much, as any thing in him, mought haue bin therto, (by any means,) found seruisable.
But, who would haue thought, that they, who are (in dede) of the honester sort, and more charitable: yea, of the wiser, and (by Office) mightier (& some of them, taken for his especial great freends) would, so many yeres, haue bin so Careles, or slack, to Ayde, and procure the Innocent, to be deliuered, from the greuous, and most Iniurious spoyle of his good Name and Fame: and all the inconueniences, depending theron? Or, who would haue thought, that so great, so vncharitable Vntruthes, should so vndiscretely haue bin published: by those Men especially, who, otherwise, in woord and life, were very modest, and Circumspect? thought it good, Therfore (my honest freend and Cuntryman) to aduertise thee, of some parte of the Cause, of the strange maner, of this Treatise comming to thy sight, or reading: As, without the Name, of any certain Author therof: And, without the Name, of the zealous Artificer, who first did sollicite, and collect such matter (by as it were) from this Ientleman.
And Thirdly, without my own Name: into whose hands, the sayd Artificer, hath deliuered all the matter, that he could get of this Brytish Ientleman: to the Title of this booke, answerable: yea, and other rare Instructions, also.
only discouraged to labor, or pen any more Treatises, or bookes, him self, in ARTIFICIALL METHOD, for his vnkinde, vnthankful, disdainfull, and sklanderous Cuntrymen, to vse (nay abuse:) but,
also, is loth (and hath great reason, so to be) to haue his Name, any more, prefixed, or subscribed, to any Treatises, passing from him, either by writing, or by speech.
And, both these Inconueniences, are purposely committed: to auoyd, or, somwhat to preuent hensforward, the farther grief and offence, that might grow to him, and his true freends: to perceiue the former sundry sorts of Caterpillers, and great hinderers of the prosperous Estate, of any to knaw vpon the leaf, or flower, of his Commendable Fame: who, would take very quickly an Occasion (by the forefronts of bookes, garnished with his BRYTISH NAME,) to fall to a fresh pang of enuious busiosity, impudent arrogancy, and dogged malicious speeches vsing and vttring against the Ientleman: who (vndoutedly) wisheth euill to none.
And (perhaps) though it were very good matter, that should, by him, be contriued and written, and vnder his Name, be published: yet, they would (in perusing it), either peruert their own Iudgements of it, through their vnquieted, and mere malicious fantazie, wilfully bent against him: or, rather, in dede, through their own great Ignorance, would verify the Prouerb: Scientia non habet Inimicum, nisi Ignorantem: as, they did by his Monas Hieroglyphica: dedicated to the late Emperor Maximilian: wherein, the Queene her most Excellent Maiesty, can be a sacred witnes (as haue heard) of the Strange and vndue speeches, deuised of that Hieroglyphicall writing: Or, if they liked the matter: then, they would say, that such a Treatise, (vnder his Name, published) is not, or was not, of his owne compiling and ordring, as Author therof: but that, some other Man, now liuing, or long since dead, was the only and first Author, of such a good Treatise.
And, that of malicious Iniury, hath bin very notably vnto him, for these many yeres past, about his Booke Intituled Aphorislica: and is, yet, searse ceased in all corners (for, it is backbiting worke, and seeketh Corners.)
For, some men, (And they such, who ought to haue bin honest and discreet, as they are, or were accounted learned) haue, very enuiously, fathered it, vpon the excellent Mercator Rupelmundanus (yet liuing at Duysburgh ,) as, to be the only and true Author of those Aphorismes
But, afterward, when that was found a fable: Then, vpon one Vrso (who liued many hundred yeres since) was all the Commendation bestowed, for that Aphoristicall worke contriuing.
And then, agayne, after that, vpon one Alkabitius: And at length, with shame enough (but more will follow) being driuen from these mere enuious, and spitefull false deuises: yet (most obstinately and impudently) they still auouch to diuers Ientlemen, and certaine Noble Men, that some other, or (in effect) any Man els, was the Author therof: rather, than they would honestly acknowlege the Truthe, of only this Ientleman his peculiar Industry, and no small skill, vsed in the contriuing and framing of that Booke: containing the chief Crop and Roote, of Ten yeres his first Outlandish Homish Studies and exercises Philosophicall: as, partly in the preface therof, to the Reader, is specified: but more habundantly and purposely, hath that point bin proued and testified to some, who were (before) fowly infected, with the sklaunderous Opinion, that one Vrso was the Author of it, and not this honest Brytish Ientleman: as, at an other tyme, will be made more euident: When, a ful declaration, in more conuenient place, may be made, of the mere malicious, very rash, and Brutish Censure, of a certain Doctor, (yet liuing.)
Who, lately, endeuored him self, to perswade some right worshipfull Ientlemen, that it were good, and behoofull for this Common Wealth, If the sayd Philosopher, were Banished this land, for euer.
Bicause, said this Doctor (but most vntruly: as is now very euident, to Thousands of Men, of this Kingdom, and other) That, to no Man of this Realm, he did at any tyme, or yet doth, or will, communicate any part, of his learned Talent, by word or writing: But is wholy addicted, to his priuate commodity only auancing, by his own Studies and practises very secret.
That Doctor, his name, shall not, here, by me, be disclosed: for that, he hath (vpon honest Repentance, for his so iniurious dammageable Intent) receiued his Sentence of free forgiuenes: in the presence of worshipfull witnes, yet aliue.
And when, likewise, the perfect declaration may more aptly be had, of the most Iudas like pranke, of an other Doctor: who (in the tyme of this Brytan Innocent his Captiuity: and somewhat, before the day of his enlarging, by letters, sent to his keper, from the Right honorable Priuy Counsail, to KING PHILIP and QVEENE MARY) did, very ernestly sollicite with the Lord Chauncelor, (with whom he could do very much) And with the Bishop of London, (whom, also, he could half perswade) that it were requisite, and Iustice, that the sayd Brytan Captiue, were not set at liberty at all: but, should be forthwith committed to PERPETVAL PRISON: And that, vpon such respects, as he, most vnchristianlike and maliciously, had deuised: and very impudently, vpon his Credit with them (such as it was) would haue forced, to preuaile.
But, God would not suffer the sayd Courteous Captiue, his great freendship and humanity, a few yeres before, vsed toward that Doctor (in Paris so, to be requited, with worse, then Ingratitude.
Besides, that the sayd Captiue, could neuer (nor yet can) be duly charged, with any word or deed, vttred or done, contrary to the performance of his duty toward his Soueraigne and the higher Powers.
And though here omit many other great Iniuries, done vnto him, about the bereauing him, of the true and due Title and Interest, in and to his own works, writings and Inuentions, in other places recorded (And among that sort, omitting that foule Iniury, done to him by one Ioannes Franciscus Offhuysius whose booke De Diuina Astrorum facultate was of this Brytan Philosopher, his Inuention, chiefly: As, may be made euident, both by the matter therin contayned, being compared to his Propaedeumata Aphoristica And also, by the said Franciscus his daily familiar Letters solliciting and requesting those such like Hypotheses Astrologicall at the said Philosopher his hands: he being, moreouer here conuersant with, and depending vpon this our Brytan Mathematicien aboue a whole yere.)
Yet must Note vnto you, euen here, that one of those Iniuries, was aboue all the rest, so Notorious: and withall, so notably well known, to be an Iniury, that the last yere, a certain Mechanicien, (being busied about matter of Nauigation), calling to his Remembrance the same Iniury: being a fowle and Impudent brag, that an English Mariner, (now, aboue,
yeres sins, had made, to diuers honest men: the new Sea Instrument, newly also, called the Paradoxall Cumpas As, to haue bin of his Inuention.)
was so inflamed with Indignation against this arrogant Mariner, his abhominable Impudency, (so long tyme, by this Ientleman, very patiently suffred,) that he made very earnest request to this Ientleman (the true Inuentor, of this Instrument Paradoxal) that, although, all the Iniuries receiued at their hands, who were deemed learned, he would not very sharply reproue: and, but at leysure: yet, that it should be an Act, mete and needfull for him to do, (being also behoofull for the Common Wealth) speedily to detect, such shameles Braggers and Crakers: onely sophistically furnished, to outward shew: and that, with other Mens rare Inuentions: but, of them selues, vtterly vnhable to Inuent any worthy Conclusion, to be profitably practised, on Sea or Land.
Which Mechanicien his ernest request, (by the foresayd Ientleman) being graunted, was the very chief first occasion, of these Rare Memorials (concerning The perfect Arte of Nauigation so comming in Record: after a Mechanicall and vulgar Artificer his blunt maner of penning, and collecting the same.
Who, about the Entrance into the matter of Nauigation, finding good Opportunity, to speake First of a continually to be mainteyned, for manifold great Commodities procuring to this BRYTISH MONARCHIE: (which, no other way, can be brought to pas:) and among them all, the PERPETVALL POLITIK SECVRITIE and better preseruation of this famous Kingdom, from all Forrein danger, or Homish disorder, to be the chiefest: and most needfull Publik Benefit: (and vndowtedly, likely, to ensue therof:) he was dutifully willing, rather to follow some brief discussing of that very waighty matter, (and especially in these dangerous dayes, and Incredible peeuish practises, ful often deuised against the GOOD PEACE, AND PROSPEROVS TRANQVILLITIE of this INCOMPARABLE ILANDISH MONARCHIE:) then, to fall to the foresayd Generall and Rare Memorials recording, of THE PERFECT ARTE OF NAVIGATION: which, he, (therupon) set aside, a while.
And wherof, now, only the Second Volume entreateth: vnder this proper Title: THE BRYTISH COMPLEMENT, OF THE PERFECT ARTE OF NAVIGATION.
For, no vulgar doctrine, or practise, is therin conteyned: But rather the GENERALL COMPLEMENT, and (almost in particular,) all that, which hitherto, was wanting: or, which mought be most needfull to so excellent an Arte, and (to this kingdome) most beneficiall of all other Mechanicall exercises: And such is the foresayd Brytish Complement, (as do right well know) that the Contents therof, are aboue the most part of the best learned mens expectations, (yea, or hope) of being brought to pas: and all that, in rare, general, and excellent Conclusions of Gubernautik, chiefly.
And so great, is the Volume therof, that, to haue it fairely and distinctly printed, with all the Appertenances, it would be, (in bulk) greater than the English Bible, of the greatest volume: And yet, the plat of Inuention, Disposition, and recording therof, was finished in les, than
monthes space: it is to wete, of September, October, Nouember, and December last.
Due Laud and Glory, be, therfore, ascribed to the free geuer of all good and perfect Gifts.
The third Booke, neither will, or may (as yet) say any thing of.
The Ientleman his desire was, that it should be vtterly suppressed, or deliuered to Vulcan his Custody.
But, the fourth Volume, may Iudge it, to be as an Earthly Paradise: Booke, of as great godly pleasure, as worldly profit and delight: Booke, for the BRYTISH HONOR and WEALTH (And that, in diuers maner) such an one, as neuer, King Ptolomaeus or Prince Abilfada Ismaël or any Geographicall or Hydographicall Discouerer did write, or Collect: as (for my simple Capacity) do verily Iudge of it.
The Title wherof, is, OF FAMOVS, and RICH DISCOVERIES: The Discourse therof, not only conteineth the Generall Suruey Hydrographicall, of all the whole world, (and chiefly the rare Euidences for all the partes therof, most Septentrionall) but also, a particular and ample examination, of King Solomon his Ophirian three yeres voyage: And also, the lawfull and very honorable Entitling of our most gratious and Soueraigne Lady, QVEENE ELIZABETH, (and so, this BRYTISH SCEPTRE ROYALL) to very large Forrein Dominions: such, as in, and by the same, duly recouered and vsed, the Course of the Diuine prouidence generall, in this present Age, will bring to light and life, matter of great Importance and Consequency, both to the Glory of God, and the benefit of all Christendom, and Heathenes.
The greatnes of this Volume, is not much les, than of the Second.
And one way, it far passeth the Second: For, in the Secret Center therof, is more bestowed, and stored vp, than may, or (in this place) will expres.
The same Volume, was, chiefly, of the Ientleman his own very speedy collecting: And (by his wil, and order) hath this Inscription, or Dedication, TO THE MOST VVORTHY: And the same Inscription, to be written, or printed in letters of Gold.
And had not the Incredible, and manifold Iniuries, and vndue Disturbances bin, which haue happened to him (by sundry parcels of tyme) for the space of three Monthes, and more, (in Totall summe), within the tyme of all these Collections, most speedily and Carefully heaping vp togither, since August last: am rightwell assured, that, neuer, in so small tyme, so much matter, of so great Importance, with such syncere and dutifull zeale to pleasure his Natiue Cuntry: had by any Subiect (BRYTISH or ENGLISH) bin deliuered from him, by Inuention of his own, or by Circumspect Collection, or discrete Application, out of former or present writers, and Authors.
What is than (I pray you) in all his life tyme, to be thought likely, or possible, and in tymes more commodious, to haue bin Inuented: Or, conuerted to better Method of Knowledge, or vse of practise: or notably reformed, by the said Ientleman? Especially, for the space of these Thirty yeres, last past? In which long tyme of his Tyrocinie, he hath, incessantly, to the vttermost of his power, and hability, followed an extraordinary, and most painfull, and very costly Course of Philosophicall Enquiries making, after the best Verities: which, may yeld, (by due Considerations of the Creatures, their vertues and properties) to their Creator and ours, Glory, Praise, Honor vnspeakable: for his Infinit Goodnes, Wisdom and Power: the euident print, Demonstrable proof, wherof, the same, (our God), hath bestowed most abundantly, in his own handyworke, of all his Creatures Creating: all the whole, and vniuersall world ouer, dispersed: nay, rather Filling the whole Cosmographicall frame, and Orbe: from the Center therof, to the vttermost Circumference of the same: being, to Mortall mans outward eye, vtterly vnsensible.
It will appeare, hereafter, in due tyme, that, greater, furder, and of longer Continuance, hath bin his doings, and very well liked of, Aduertisements and Instructions, in sundry affayres Philosophicall, and Cosmopoliticall, FOR VERITIE, IVSTICE, AND PEACE FVRDERING, than hath, of any Three, of his neerest freends, and most familiarly acquainted Cuntrymen, bin (as yet) perceiued.
And this also, may say of the same Ientleman (without seeming to flatter him, or any whit to abuse thee, my honest freend and Cuntryman:) or, he him self, with great Modesty, and no arrogancy, might (to God his high Glory) say: That, yf in the foresaid whole cours of his tyme, he had found a Constant Assistant CHRISTIAN ALEXANDER: BRYTAN, should not haue bin, now, destitute of a CHRISTIAN ARISTOTLE.
Any farder, is nedeles, to be disclosed of this Ientleman: whose greuous wounds, (by dedly sklanders, vpon diuelish Enuy, only: and the same, priuily slasht, and hewed into his Sydes: and nere vnto his Hart) are not, yet, in the perfect and charitable Chirurgiens, curing.
The more Lamentable, will the case be found: and the remedy, to late, thought vpon, am greatly afraid.
In the mean space (my louing freend, and vnpartiall Reader) am, to aduertise thee, that, as concerning the publishing of the other two great Volumes: though, the Inuentions, and Collections be such, as sayd, and of great Value: both for the HONOR AND WEALTH OF ENGLAND, and no little furderance of the GLORY OF GOD: yet, (by Order, taken by him, who hath the chief Interest therin:) the same, are not to be printed, VNTIL THE PROOF BE PAST, How, this Mechanicien, his zealous, dutyfull, and humble Aduertisement Politicall, (for the Perpetuall Garde, and furder Seruice, of a to be mainteined, without any Cost or Charge to the Queene her most excellent Maiestie, or any vnpleasant burden to the Commons, and faithfull Subiects, of this BRYTISH MONARCHIE) shall be liked of, and accepted: (for the zeale, and matter, mean, rather, than for any Rhetoricall polishing bestowed on it.)
Seeing, the same, conteineth in it, such Fragments of Instructions, receiued from the foresaid Philosopher: being, hitherto (almost) a Freendles freend.
Why say I, freendles? Seeing, a Ientleman, of great Experience in this world, sayd vnto him, in my hering, within these few dayes: Tu certè Infoelix, at multos inter Amicos.
But, for all that, betwene a cold freend, and a faint harted Enemy, is small diuersity.
And vndowtedly, a fayned, hollow harted or Hypocriticall freend, is worse, ten tymes, than an open Enemy: And, in very dede, is not to be counted a freend.
And, so, may the outward repugnancy of these two sayings, aptly be reconciled.
But, proceding in my former purpose, you may vnderstand this, moreouer: that the Second Booke or Volume, (to this Preface apperteyning) will be of more hundred pounds, Charges, to be prepared for the print (in respect of the Tables, and Figures therto requisite): than you would easily beleue.
Therfore, though there were no warning, of Attendance to be giuen, to vnderstand the issue of liking or misliking the foresaid, (zealously collected, and as humbly presented) Politicall Aduertisement: yet, this matter of Charges, so far passeth my slender hability: and, withall, is so dreadfull to the Printers, for feare of great los therby susteining (So rare, and few mens Studies, are in such matters employed) that, delay, on my part, is rather, that way, Constrained: And, therfore, no Order is to be thought vpon, by me, for the printing therof: TYLL, COMFORTABLE AND SVFFICIENT OPPORTVNITY OF SVPPLY, DOTH VERY VVELL SERVE THERTO.
And before, bid thee Farewell (my Cuntryman) may yet aduertise thee, of one point more (whither the sayd Second Volume, be euer printed, or no) That, therin, is one parcell conteined: so, contriued and Dedicated vnto the AEternall, Royall, and Heroicall Honor, and Renowm of our Incomparable Gracious QVEENE ELIZABETH: that, all the whole world ouer, yea, among the Heathen, as well as Christen: what language so euer they speake, that haue to deale with Hydrography, or Dangerous and long voyages by Sea: euen they, will, most thankfully, and for euer, sing and extoll her marueilous Princely Benefit herein: as, to them, chiefly for her Maiesties sake and Merits, imparted: who, hath bin so constantly fauorable, and so gracious a Soueraign Lady, vnto the Inuentor therof, her most faythfull and obedient Subiect.
The richest Pyramis at Memphis did neuer so far, and so durably spred the Fame and Commendation of the Builders therof, as these TABLES GVBERNAVTIKE, will win, and procure the large loue, and good liking of our Elizabeth, all the world ouer, and while the world endureth, to florish.
The English Title therof, is, THE BRYTISH QVEENE ELIZABETH, HER TABLES GVBERNAVTIK.
And the same, is of many Quires of Paper, conteining.
Now, haue sufficiently (for this place tyme) giuen vnto you (my courteous Cuntryman) Aduertisements: which (I trust) you will take in good part thankfully: yf, in your own Conscience, you plainly that all my zealous speech, herein bestowed, tendeth to the Aduancement of vertue, and to the great Benefit and Commodity Publik.
At an other tyme, hope to haue Comfort, and conuenient Opportunitie, to impart vnto you, other matter: for your exceeding good Contentation, and great delight also.
And, in the mean space, trust that this my syncere, blunt, and simple Aduise, shall be some Occasion, that hensforward, this honest Ientleman, shal be fully restored to the Integrity of his duly deserued honest Name and Fame: And, also receyue great Publik Thanks, Comfort Ayde of the Whole Brytish State.
To the Honor, Welfare, and Preseruation wherof (next vnto his duty doing vnto God) he hath directed all the course of his manifold Studies, great Trauailes, and incredible Costes.
As, both, by these his Hexameron Lessons (First, here, for Security of the same) spedily Dictated: and also, by very many other his wordes, workes, and writings els: both, in England, and other where, spoken, done, communicated, and published, will, or may abundantly be testified.
And, so, Fare you well in Christ, my Courteous, and vnpartiall Cuntryman: And, for a Remembrance, at this our most freendly Farewel, take this heauenly Counsail with thee: Omnia quaecun{que} volueritis vt faciant vobis homines, sic vos facite illis: haec enim est Lex Prophetae.
Which kinde of skantlin, and Measure diuine, being, before hand, and in due tyme, layd vnto all our thoughts, wordes and dedes, may be as a good and familiar Angell vnto vs: to help vs to shonne, and flie from all sklandrous speeches vsing: all malicious, or seditious Libels skattring: and all other vniust, vncharitable dealings: yea, and from consenting or suffring of the same, where we can, or ought, to redres the Cause.
And, Then, the Glory, and Peace of God, will florish in this BRYTAN MONARCHIE.
Ouer which, (so reformed) that our most Gracious and Soueraign QVEENE ELIZABETH, may, very many yeres, most prosperously and Triumphantly Raigne, it is (vndowtedly) our bounden duty, feruently and full oft, by Prayer, to request at his hands, who is the King of Kings, Almighty.
To whose Protection, furderance also, most hartily, and dutifully, commende the very waighty Case, of this Common Wealth: not vtterly vnduly, or, (yet) out of season (I hope) in this first booke ensuing, somewhat Considered of: as, in a Preface, very nedefull, to the BRYTISH COMPLEMENT, OF THE PERFECT ARTE OF NAVIGATION.
And herewith, (once more), say, Adieu and well motest thou Fare, my Christian Brother, and syncerely beloued Cuntryman.
Anno, Stellae (Coelo Demissae, recta{que} Reuersae) Quinto: Iulij verò, Die.
discrete, and singuler fauorer, of all good Artes, and Sciences, M. Christopher Hatton Esquier: Capitain of her Maiesties Garde, and Ientleman of her priuy Chamber.
NOt onely my dutifull good will toward your Worship, and my great desire, to doo some thing beneficiall to this my Natiue Cuntry: But allso, a certain stinging Indignation, agaynst the Impudent Attempt of such, as vse, wrongfully to challendge to them selues, other mens Trauailes, (and not hable to yeld any Ingenious Inuention of their own) haue, at this present, forced me, to doo my Indeuor, for the publishing of this strange Instrument, with the name of the true Inuentor therof, annexed: And humbly to dedicate my simple Industry herein, to your worships protection.
Trustyng you will the rather accept the same, beyng (as it were) a Crum, to my great Contentation, faln from his plentifull Table, whom (I am assured) you doo derely and sincerely, both loue and esteme: as well, of your own most curteous disposition toward all men, with whom your worship hath to doo: as also, for sundry his vertues, and excellent Skill, in many Arts, and Sciences, Wherewith the highest hath very graciously blessed him.
For which his habilitie, and Talent, he is all wayes most humbly thankfull, to the onely Author, and giuer, of all goodnes and wisedome.
yeres (at the least) haue had the Ientleman in great admiration: As well for his foresayd excellencie in good learning (so iudged of, long sins, by the learned, in sundry Nations) As, for his most ready Curtesie in Communicating or conferring to and with such, as duly require his Aduise, Opinion, or Iudgement, in any Science, Arte or Practise, wherein he hath had any speculation or exercise.
Such Commendations, as these, allthough they be great, (and rare, in any Studious Ientleman of this Kingdom, els:) Yet, neither the same, nor ten tymes as great (sownding lowd about his eares, for these many yeres past) haue at any tyme, or yet doo, any one pyns point, puf vp his hart, vayngloriously: but haue, and doo make him more Ioyfully thankfull, to the kingly and free giuer, of such his great Talent: So great, as, Quibus Res notae sunt, qui illi benè volunt, existimant orationem non esse parem Magnitudini Rerum gestarum (As that prudent Atheniensien Gouernor, Pericles sayd, In oratione Funebri: Commending them, that manfully had spent their liues, in the late warres, then: Alij, ignari, iudicant laudes esse immodicas: quia inuident excellenti virtuti.
Laudes enim eò vs{que} tolerabiles sunt, donec ea dicuntur, quae Auditores se quo{que} facere posse arbitrantur: Si Maiora dicuntur, Inuident, non credunt.
Therfore, pardon me (I beseech your worship) Yf in rehearsing here, and there (glaunsingly) some points of his due Commendation, speak far short of that, which (farder) your worship and other, doo, or may know, and more aptly can expres, to Gods glory: for his graces, on that Ientleman, so abundantly bestowed: Who (I know right well) doth make no les account of your Worship, then the Iustice of dutifull and perfect Amitie requireth.
Which is a thing, very rare (now a dayes) any where to be found.
And for better proof of the Premisses, (by your leaue, and with your patience) will, here, truly and briefly Note such matter vnto you, as neither (Withall) is impertinent to this Paradoxall Instrument, now, first published: nor mete to be let pas (in a manner) vnknown, and vtterly vnrecorded.
monthes last past, a vertuous Ientleman and Marchant, with zealous Intent, for the Auauncement of God his glory, and the great Commoditie, and honor of this kingdom, procured vnto him, Worshipfull, yea and Honorable Ayde also: to set furth Ships, for a Northwest Discouery: And shortly after, there came abrode, in Print, a little English book, containing some probable reasons, tending to the perswasion of the same Cours and voyage: In the Epistle of which little book, no small pece of Credit (for the Attempt to be liked of) was ascribed to M. his Iudgement, (as, there, is to be sene) set down, in his Mathematicall Praeface, with the English Euclide, published: So it came to pas, that it was his wurshipfull freend M. Edward Dyer his fortune, First, to Aduertise him (as he told me) both of the sayd book, by the Title therof: and of his Name, in the foresayd Epistle (to good purpose) vsed.
Whereupon, he, calling to Remembrance his old Atlanticall Discourses, to the self same purpose (at the sayd M. Dyer his request) almost ten yeres sins, set down in writyng: And perusing throughly all reasons and allegations (both Pro and Contra now, in the sayd Pamphlet expressed: did, furthwith, by euery Article therof, in the Margent, Note their value, or imperfection.
And, straight way, after that, made a new Collection, for the same voyage, very probable.
new Considerations of his own: very pleasant, in probabilitie, for an other voyage of Discouery: (in respect of Safetie, Nerenes, and Commoditie) nothing inferior to that, which they, now, haue vndertaken, God send them good spede.
And, M. Dee, being thus furnished, aswell to maintein probably his former Iudgement (by M. Gascoyn recited, in the foresayd Epistle) and intending to geue those his,
new and very straunge Articles of Consideration, to him or them, whom he should apt and desirous to furder the sayd Discouery (no les, then this was by a discrete, carefull, diligent, and constant Procurer, follower and furderer, brought to the present execution): And also, purposing freendly to examin, and faithfully to Instruct M. Capitain Frobisher and M. Christopher Hall and other, that should haue the chardge about the sayd Northwest Discouery (As he was, partly by the right worshipfull Sir Leonell Ducket Knight, and partly by M. Frobisher him self, before that, requested to doo) made, then, no delay, to repayr to the Moschouy house: Where, he found him self courteously and very worshipfully enterteined.
And at that tyme of his abode there, and after that, at sundry other tymes, of his Resort, thither, and to their Ships, he proceded so with them, according to his Intent: and pleasured them, so much according to their desire: That he finding them, quick of apprehension, and likely to remaine Thankfull, for his pithy instructing of them: And they, finding him (aboue their expectation) skilfull: And (more then could be wished for) Carefull, for their well doing, in this their commendable and honorable Attempt: both the one and the other, became very sorry of their so late acquaintance and conference, for these their waighty affaires furdering: And greatly misliked their want of tyme, sufficient for the Compleme~t and principall pointes of the Perfect Art of Nauigation learning at his hands.
Such pointes, (I meane), as needed either great knowledge in the Sciences Mathematicall, and Arts Mechanicall: or expert Skill, of many Causes and effects Naturall Such points (I say) to their affaires, and the Perfect Art of Nauigation he very aptly could, right willingly wold haue dealt with them in: Yf that pinch of tyme, wold haue so permitted.
For, it is very euident, by his description of the Perfect Art of Nauigation (in his foresayd Mathematicall Praeface declared) and also, common reason, and dayly experience, will confirme the same: that, not onely, such skill and furniture, as both here is rehearsed, and in that Praeface is specified: But, other also, is most nedefull for him to be fraught withall, that shall be allowed for an exact Hydrographer, or of such an Incomparable Ilandish Monarchy as, this BRYTISH IMPIRE hath bene: Yea, as it, yet, is: or, rather, as it may, (of right) ought to be: As haue bene informed by him, who can reasonably declare how: WHom, also, haue heard, often and most hartily Wish, That all manner of persons passing or frequenting any our Seas, appropriate: and many wayes, next enuironing England, Ireland and Scotland might be, in conuenient honorable sort (at all tymes,) at the Commandement and Order (by Beck or Check) of of Three score Tall Ships, (or more:) but in no case, fewer: and they, to be very well appoynted, throughly manned, and sufficiently vittailed.
The Publik Commodities wherof, ensuing: are, or would be, so great and many, as the whole Commons, and all the Subiects of this Noble Kingdome, would (for euer,) bles the day and houre, wherein, such good and politik Order, was (in so good Time and Opportunitie) taken, and established: And esteme them, not onely most worthy and Royall Counsailers, but also Heroicall Magistrates, who haue had so fatherly Care for the Communaltie: and most wisely, procured so Generall Brytish Securitie
That, henceforward, neither France, Denmark, Scotland, Spaine nor any other Cuntry, can haue such liberty, for Inuasion, or their mutuall Conspiracies, or Ayds, any way, Transporting: to annoy the blessed State of our Tranquillitie: as, either they haue (in tymes past) had: Or els, may haue, whensoeuer they will forget, or contemne, the Obseruing of their sworn, or pretended Amitie.
Besides that, report me to all English (Sayd he) of how great value to them, and Consequently, to the of this Kingdom, such a Securitie were? Wherby, both outward, homeward A] (continually) their Marchantlike Ships (many or few, great or small) may, in our Seas, and somewhat farder, pas quietly vnpilled, vnspoyled and vntaken, by Pyrates, or other, in time of Peace.
The wisedom and purpose of that most politik Lawmaker, King Minos may, herein, to vs, be a sufficient Aduertisement.
Et dominatus est in maxima parte eius Maris, quod nunc Hellenicum (.i. Graecum) Et Regnauit in Cycladibus, primus Conditor multarum vrbium in illis locis Cùm inde Cares: filios suos Gubernatores Ac Praedandi consuetudinem (sicut consentaneum est) quantùm potuit, mari Idque ob eam cansam fecit vt vectigalia Redditus magis ad se peruenirent
What Abundance of Mony, now, lost by Assurance, giuen, or taken, B] would by this meanes, also, be greatly out of danger?
¶And Thirdly, how many men (before time of vrgent nede) wold, A] thus, be made very skilfull, in all the foresayd Seas, and Sea Coasts: in their Channels knowing, in Soundings all ouer, in good marks taking, for auoyding dangers, in good Harboroughs trying out, in good Landings assaying, In the order of Ebs and Fluds obseruing, and all other points aduisedly learning, which to the Perfect Art of Nauigation are very necessary: Wherby, they may be the better hable to be diuided and distributed, in a greater Nauy, with charge of Maistership or Pylotage, in tyme of great nede? For, this Art of Nauigation requireth a great skill and industry.
And, Yf, yeres since, it was found true, among the Graecians that Ars est enim Res Nautica, si quid aliud: Nec discitur obiter: Sed ita est, vt in eam solam, cura intendatur, ne obiter alia agantur: How much more, now, in our dayes, may it be truly affirmed: When, it is, ten tymes more, (in particular skill, and ingenious feats) augmented, then it was, in those dayes? They of this Nauy, should oftentymes espy or the Priuy Sownders and Serchers of our Channells, flats, banks, Pyts, &c.
And so, very diligently, deciphring our Yea and in the Ryuer of Thames also: otherwhile, vp to the Station of the
And likewise, very mete with the abhominable Theues, that steale our Corne, and vittailes, from sundry our Coasts: to the great hinderance of the Publik plenty of England.
And these Theues, are, both Subiects and forreyners: and very often, and to to euidently sene: and generally murmured at: but, as yet, not redressed: for all the good wise Order, by the most honorable Senat of the Priuy Counsayll, taken therein.
and apt ages of men) wold be, by this meanes, not only hardned, well to broke all rage and disturbance of Sea, and endure healthfully all hardnes of lodging and dyet there, but also wold be well practised, and easily trayned vp, to great perfection of vnderstanding all maner of fight and Seruice at Sea? So that, in time of great nede, that expert and hardy Crue of some Thousands of wold be to this Realme a Treasor incomparable.
And, who knoweth not, what daunger it is, in time of great nede, either to vse all Or, to be a fortnight in prouiding a little Company of Omnigatharums: taken vp, on the sudden, to serue at Sea? For, our ordinary are generally intended, or, now may be spared, to be employed otherwise, if nede be.

¶How many Hundreds of lusty and handsome Men, wold be (this
way) well occupied: and haue needfull maintenance: Which, now, are either Idle, or, want sustenance: or, both: In to to many places, of this renowmed Monarchy? ¶Moreover, what a Cumfort and Sauegard, will it, or may
it be, to the whole Realme, To haue the great Aduantage of so many warlike Ships, so well manned and appointed (for all assayes) at all houres, ready to affront straight way, set on, and ouerthrow, any sudden or priuy forreyn Trechery: by Sea (directly, or indirectly) attempted agaynst this Impire: in any Coast or parte therof? For, sudden forrein Attempts (that is to say, vnknowen or vnhard of to vs, before their Readynes) can not be done, with great power: For, great Nauies, most commonly, are espyed, or hard somwhat of, and that very certainly, while they are in preparing: though in the meanewhile (politikly) in diuers places, they distribute their Ships, and their preparations appertaining.
at all tymes, not onely lye in our hands, greatly to displease and pinch the Pety forrein Offender, at Sea: but also (yf iust occasion be geuen) on land, to doo very valiant Seruice: and that, speedily: as well, against any of the foresayd forreyn possible Offenders: As, also, against such of Ireland, Scotland, or England, who shall, or will trayterously, rebelliously, or seditiously assemble in Troups, or Bands, within the Territories of Ireland, or England: while, greater Armyes (on our behalf) shall be in preparing, against them: Yf, farder nede, be.
For, skilfull are, also, on land, far more traynable to all Martiall exployts executing: and therein to be more quick eyed and nymble, at handstrokes, or skaling: better to endure all hardnes, of Lodging, or dyet: and les to feare all daunger, nere or far: Than the can be brought to the perfection of a
As (to the same Intent) the Incomparable, and most expert Graeke Capitain Pericles in his Oration (had to the Parlement Senators of Athens auowched: Comparing their State, to the State of the Lacedemonians.
Saying: Cum{que} Praesidium aduersus nos collocabunt, nocebunt illi quidem: quia excursionibus vastabunt Agros, recipient Transfugas: Sed non poterunt simul obsidere nos, prohibere nostras Nauigationes in ipsorum terram: Vbi cos Classe vexabimus.
At nos quidem plus habemus Industriae, ad praelia in terra, ex vsu rei Nauticae: quàm ipsi habere possunt ad Rem Nauticam, ex vsu Militiae Terrestris.
Nam, nec vos (quanquam bello Persico, Classe vtimur, nos exercemus) satis Idonei estis.
¶By this Nauy, also, all Pyrats, our own Cuntrymen (And they to no small number) wold be called, or constrayned to come home.
And then (vpon good Assurance taken of the reformable, and men of choice, for their good Abearing, from hence forth) all such to be bestowed, here and there, in the foresayd Nauy.
For, good accownt is to be made of their bodyes, (allready hardned to the Seas) and chiefly, of their Courages and Skill, for good Seruice to be done at the Sea.
¶Nynthly, Princes and Potentates, our forreyn frends, or pryuy foes, (the one for loue, and the other, for feare) wold not suffer any Marchant, or other, (Subiects of the Queenes Maiesty), either to haue to speedy wrong, in their Cowrts: Or, by vnreasonable delayes, or trifling Shifts, to be made wery, and vnhable to follow their right: And, notwithstanding such our freends, (or, Priuy foes), their Subiects, wold be glad, (most reuerently) to become Suters and Petitioners to the Royall State of this Kingdom, for iust Redres: Yf, any kinde of way, they could truly proue them selues, by any Subiect of this Realme, Iniuryed: and they, wold neuer, be so Stowt, Rude, and dishonorably Iniurious to the Crown and Dignity of this most Sacred Monarchy, as, (in such Cases) to be their own or, to vse against this Kingdom, and the Royall chief Cownsaill therof, such abhominable Terms of Dishonor: as, our to to great Lenity, and their to to barbarous.
And, all this, wold come to pas, through the Royalty and Souerainty of the Seas adiacent, or this Monarchy of England, Ireland, and (by right) Scotland, and the Orknayes allso, very Princely, prudently, and valiantly recouered: that is to say, by the sayd duly and iustly Limited: Discretely possessed: and Tryumphantly enioyed.
¶Should not forreyn Fishermen (ouer boldly, now, and to to
Iniuriously, abusing our Rich Fishings, about England, Wales, and Ireland) by the presence, ouersight, power, and Industry of this be made content, and Iudge them selues well apayd, to enioy (by our leaue) some great portion of Reuenue to enriche them selues, and their Cuntryes by: with Fishing, within the Seas, appertayning to our Ancient Bownds and Limits? Where, now, (to our great Shame, and Reproche), some of them, doo come, (in maner) home to our doores: and, among them all, depriue vs, yerely, of many hundred thousand pownds: which, by our Fishermen, vsing the sayd Fishings, (as chief), we might enioy: And, at length (by little and little) bring them, (Yf we wold deal so rigorously with them,) to haue as little portion of our peculyer Commodity, (to our Ilandish Monarchy, by God and Nature, assigned) as, now, they force our Fishermen, to be with: And yerely (notwithstanding) doo, at their fishing, openly, and ragingly vse such words of reproche, toward our Prince and Realm, as, no true Subiects hart can quietly disgest: And, besides that, such shamefull wrongs to the good laboursom people of this Land, as is not (by any reason) to be born withall, or endured any longer: Destroying their Nets, Cutting their Cables, to the los of their Anchors: Yea, oftentymes, of Barkes, Men, and all.
And, of these sorte of people they be, which (other whiles) by collour and pretence of comming about their feat of fishing, doo subtilly and secretly vse Sowndings, and Serchings, of our Channells, Deeps, Showles, Banks, or Bars, along the Sea Coasts, and in our Hauen Mowthes allso, and vp in our Creeks, sometymes in our Bayes, and sometimes in our Roads, &c. Taking good Marks, for of the dangers: And allso trying good Landings.
And (so, making perfect Chartes of all our rownd about England, and Ireland) are become (allmost) perfecter in them, then the most parte of our Maisters, Loadmen, or Pylots, are: to the dubble danger of mischief in tymes of War: And, allso to no little hazard of the State Royall: Yf (malitiously bent), they should purpose to land any puissant Army, in tyme to come.
And, as Concerning those Fishings of England, Wales, and Ireland: Of their places: Yerely seasons: the many hundreds of forrein Fisherboats, yerely resorting: the diuers sort of fish, there taken: with the appertenances: know right well, that (long all such matter, concerning these Fishings, is declared vnto some of the higher powers of this kingdom, and made manifest, by an other honest Ientleman of the Middle Temple.
Who, very discretely and faithfully hath dealt there in, and still trauaileth, (and by diuers other wayes also) to farder the of England, so much as in him lyeth.
But, Note, (I pray you) this point very aduisedly: That, As, By his plat, of our sayd fishing commodities, many a hundred thousand pounds of yerely Reuenue, might grow to the Crown of England, more than (now) doth: And much more, to the Commons of this Monarchy, also: besides the inestimable benefit of plentifull vitayling, and relieuing, both England: and Ireland: And beside the increasing of many thousands of expert, hard, and hardly Mariners: And besides the Abating the Sea forces of our forrein Neighbours, and vnconstant freends: And (Contrarywise) the encreasing of our own power, and force at Sea: So, it is most euident and certain, that Principium (in this Case) is, Plus quàm dimidium totius.
As haue hard it verified (prouerbially) in many other affairs.
Wherfore, the very Entrance, and Beginning toward our Recouering, And the foresayd Commodities enioying, at length: Yea, and the onely means, of our Continuance therewith: Can be no other, but by the dreadfull presence, and power, (with discreet ouersight, and due order) of the sayd being (whole som tymes, sometyme a parte therof) at all the chief places, of our Fishings: as yf they were Publik Officers, Commissioners, and Iusticiers: by the Supreme Authority Royall, of our most Renowmed QVEENE ELIZABETH, rightfully and prudently therto assigned.
So, that, this is thought to be the onely Maister Key, wherewith to open all Locks, that kepe out, or hinder, this Incomparable Brytish Impire, from enioying (by many means) such a yerely Reuenue of Threasor, (both to the Supreme hed, and Subiects therof, as no plat of Ground, or Sea, in the whole world, els, (being of no greater quantity) can with more Right, greater honor, with so great ease, and so little Chardges: So nere at hand, in so short tyme, and in so little danger: any kynde of way, yeld the like, to either, King or other Potentate, and absolute Gouernour therof, whosoeuer.
Besides the Peaceable Security, to enioy all the same, for euer.
Yea, yerely and yerely, (by our wisdom and valiantnes duly vsed) all manner of our Commodities, to arise greater and greater: as well, in wealth and strength, as of forrein loue and feare, where it is most Requisite to be: and also of Triumphant Fame, the whole world ouer, vndoutedly.
Also, this will be the perfect means, of very many other, and exceeding great Commodities, redownding to this Monarchy: which, our Fishermen, with their Fisherboats onely, can neuer be hable to Cumpas, or bring to pas: And those, being such, as are more necessary, to be cared for (Presently) then wealth.
Therfore, the Premisses well wayed, aboue and before all other, this Plat of a will (by Gods grace) be fownd, the playn and perfect A. B. C. most necessary for the Commons, and euery Subiect, in his calling, to be carefully and diligently musing vpon, or exercising him self therin.
Till, shortly, they may be hable, in effect, to read before their eyes, the most ioyfull and pleasant Brytish Histories, (by that Alphabet onely, decyphred, and so brought to their vnderstanding and knowledge) that euer, to this, or any kingdom in the whole world els, was known or perceiued.
¶Furdermore, How acceptable a thing, may this be, to the Ragusyes,
Hulks, Caruailes, and other forrein rich Laden Ships, passing within, or by any the Sea Limits, of her Maiesties Royallty, euen there, to be, now, in most Security, where, onely heretofore, they haue bene in most Ieopardy: as well, by the Rauin of the Pyrat, as the Rage of the Sea, distressing them: for lack of Succour, or good and ready Pilotage? What great frendship in hart, of forrein Prince and Subiect: And what liberall Presents, and forrein Contributions, in hand, will duly follow therof, who can not imagin? ¶Moreouer, such a (sayd he) wold be in
One were appointed, to Consider and listen, to the dooings of Ireland:
And, an other, to haue as good an and ready hand, for Scotish dealings:
An other, to Intercept or vnderstand, all priuy Conspiracies (by Sea to be communicated) and priuy Aydes of Men, Munition, or Mony, (by Sea to be transported,) to the endamaging of this kingdom, any way, intended:
An other, against all Pyrats haunting our Seas: A] And therewith, as well to wast and garde our own Marchants Fletes, as they shall pas, and repas, betwene this Realm, and wheresoeuer els they may best be planted, for their ordinary Marts keping (yf England may not best serue that turne) And also, to defend, help, and direct many our B] forrein freends, who must needes pas by, or frequent any of those Seas, whose principall Royallty, (vndoutedly) is to the Imperiall Crown of these Brytish Ilandes, appropriate.
One such Nauy, (sayd he) by Royall direction, excellently well manned, and to all purposes, aptly and plentifully furnished, and appointed: and Now, in tyme of our Peace, and quiet euery where (Yet), set forth, to the foresayd Seas: with their Chardges and Commissions, (most secretly to be kept from all foes and forreiners) wold stand this Common wealth, in as great stead, as sowr tymes, so many Ships, wold, or could do, yf, vpon the sudden, and all at once, we should be forced, to deale, (for remouing the foresayd sundry principall manners of Annoyance:) we beyng, then, vttorly vnready thereto: And the Enemyes requiring speedy (and admitting no successiue) defeating.
¶To Conclude herein: This vndowtedly, will stand the Realm in better stead; then the enioying of fowr such Forts or Townes, as Callys and Bulleyn onely, could do.
For, this, will be as great strength, and to as good purpose, in any Coast of England, Ireland, or Scotland, betwene vs and the Forrein foe, as euer Callys was, for that onely one place, that it is situated in.
And will help to enioy The Royallty and Souerainty of the Narrow Seas, and of other our Seas also, more seruisably, then Callys or Bulleyn euer did: or could doo: yf all the Prouisoes hereto appertayning, be duly obserued: forasmuch as, we entend, now, Peace onely preseruing: and no Inuasion of France, or any Enemy, on that Mayn, inhabiting: toward whom, (by Callys, or Bulleyn,) we need to our Land forces.
&c. Much (I know,) may be here sayd, Pro, Contra in this Case.
But, God hath suffred such matters to fall so out: and all to vs, for the best, yf it be so (thankfully) construed, and duly considered.
For, when all forrein Princes, our Neighbors: dowtfull freends, or vndutifull People: (Subiects, or vassals) to our Soueraign, shall perceiue such a houering purposly, here and there, euer ready and hable to ouerthrow any their malitious and subtile secret Attempts, intended against the weale Publike of this most Noble kingdom, in any parte or Coast thereof: Then, euery one of them, will, or may think, that, (of purpose) that Nauy was made out, onely to preuent them, and none other: And for their destruction, being bewrayed: as they wold deme.
So, that, no one, such forrein Enemy, wold aduenture, first, to breake out into any notable disorder, against vs: Nor homish Subiect, or wauering vassall (for like Respects) durst, then, priuily muster, to Rebellion: Or make harmfull Rodes, or dangerous Ryots, in any English, or Irish Marches.
But, such matter as this, iudge you haue, or mought haue hard of, ere now, (by the worshipfull M. Dyer ,) and that, abundandy: Seeing, Synopsis Reipub.
Brytanicae, was, at his Request (six yeres past) contriued: As, by the Methodicall Author thereof, vnderstand.
Whose Policy (here) For the Partings, Meetings, Followings, Circuits, &c. of the Ships (to the foresayd belonging) with the Alterations both of Tymes, Places, and Number, &c. is very strange to here.
So that, in Totall Somme, of all the foresayd Considerations, vnited in one: Yt seemeth to be (almost) a Mathematicall demonstration, next vnder the Mercifull and Mighty Protection of God, for a faesable Policy, to bring or praeserue this Victorious Brytish Monarchy, in a marueilous Security: Whereupon, the Reuenue of the Crown of England, and will wonderfully encrease and florish: And then, therupon, Sea forces (a new) to be encreased, proportionally: &c.
And so, the Fame, Renowm, Estimation, and Loue, or Feare, of this Brytish Microcosmus all the whole and Great world ouer, will speedily be spred, and surely be settled.
&c. Truly, was carryed (almost, ere was aware) and that, very pleasantly, into the Consideration of the manifold and Incredible great Commodities, that may arise to this Kingdom, by Nauy, such, as haue (by good Instruction) spoken of: whereas, my chief purpose was, and is, to entreat of matters, touching this and the perfect Arte of Nauigation.
But, seeing the word of a Nauy, was so nere, in Sownd, to Nauigation: And seeing, no Nauy (in dede) can be dealt withall, at Seas, accordingly, without good skill of Nauigation: (though Nauigation, may be without a Nauy) verily, for so good a purpose, and so nere to my matter, fauored my fantazy, while it somwhat strayed from my principall Intent.
For, my principall Intent and his chiefly, (whose brief Aduertisements herein wold gladly make some Remembrance of) Is, (as it ought to be, of duty) to be fownd faithfull, seruisable, Comfortable, and profitable to the Politicall Body of this Brytish Wherof, we all, be Members, by God his mercifull Ordinance.
That is to say: All true Subiects, their Chief Intent, and principall purpose, (in all worldly their affayres, Artes, Sciences, and Studyes, &c.) ought to be, the procuring, furdering, mainteyning and encreasing of the weal and Commodity Publik, so much as in them lyeth, and as, they decently and dutifully may.
And, So, the End of Ends, and yttermostscope of the sayd Arte of Nauigation, is such Publik Commodity, of this whole kingdom intended, and meant: that, from that Publik fowntain, very easily and certainly, may be deriued to euery priuat man, his proportionall parte of delitious Refreshing, and vitall preseruation, in very godly sort, and politik order.
for, before Publik: Or, no publik Commodity at all, cared for, or intended:
is euidently hindred, or, indammaged: There, by great wisdom, any such wold speedily be Cured from the Ruinous and Lamentable daunger, to the Strength and life of the ensuying, of those three kindes of so greuous and venemous wounds, if they be, ouerlong, neglected.
And, as Concerning the former that may, aswell Reporte some parte of his Plat, and Considerations, for the Charges thereof bearing and mainteyning, as haue expressed his earnest wish for such a Nauy to be set forth, for the Causes alledged: After this manner, was his entrance into that parte of his discourse.
What wold that Noble, Valiant, and Victorious Atheniensien PERICLES, say, yf, now, he were lyuing, and a Subiect of Authority, in this Brytish Kingdom? What Common Contribution, wold his pithy Eloquence perswade, for the mayntenance of this Who, taught by word, and proued in effect, Vnam Pecuniae parandae rationem putandam, Naues quamplurimas habere: Alias verò extra eam rationes, nullius momenti existimandas.
And so, effectually perswaded the Atheniensiens, Quòd, NAVES, Diuitias: Diuitias verò, aegestatem ducerent.
Which AEnigma of Prudent Pericles is thus (in Latin) expounded out of the Graeke Suidas.
Opes igitur in Terra, Inopiam arbitrari: In MARI autem sitas esse Opes, existimare: Nihil aliud est, nisi vnas putare Opes, Naues Reliqua, Inopiam iudicare: Cuiusmodi est Pecunia Spectaculorum, Iudiciorum.
Suadet ita{que}, Omnes in haec factos sumptus, Nauibus esse assignandos.
And, syns this matter of the hath somwhat occupyed myne Imagination, haue fownd (Sayd myne Instructor) by that worthy and excellent Plutarch his Graeke histories, of Notable mens liues, that this Peerles Pericles (about two thousand yeres sins) faithfully and ernestly intending, to aduance the Atheniensien State and And to make it, after the best manner, to excell all other, with whom it had, or might haue to doo: perceiued, the only means, to be Such, as, by manifold, and more forcible Arguments, the like, must to this Brytish Ilandish Monarchy be much more auailable, To procure vnto it, Triumphant prosperity: And how? By Sea Security: And how, that? By this in due tyme prouided, and discretely, at Sea mainteyned.
For, Pericles wisely vnderstanding, that no other means was so easy, so ready, and so sure, for Athens to atteyn to their wished for Souerainty, among their freends and foes, dwelling about them: But if, they were Lords and Maisters of the Seas, nere and far about them: he wold not lose any opportunity of fardering his purpose therein, both by Ships preparing, and apt men trayning vp to Sea discipline.
And therupon wold not, Imperitis Voluptatibus Ciuitatem delinire: But with such exercises delight them, as, besides other their priuate Commodities growing thereby, The Principall and finall Publik purpose, might also therewith, be brought to greater nerenes.
As: Sexaginta autem Triremes quotannis emittere, in quibus multi ex Cibus nauigabant: stipendium{que} singulis octo Minae erat: qui eas pro meditatione, exercitatione ad Nauticam Marinam Disciplinam, perciperet.
This Pericles also, by many his victories, was found and tryed, abrode (on Sea and land) Vir bello fortis strenuus: as well, as, a most prouident and Circumspect Cownsailor, at home.
Nulla enim incidit (eo Duce) ne fortuita quidem Belli offensio.
And, Quàm diù in Pace vrbi praefuit, moderatè vsus est Imperio, tuta Ciuitas erat: Opibus{que} ac Potentia (ipso Rempub: gubernante) praecipuè florebat: As Thucidides witnesseth, and other.
And now behold, what followeth (in Plutarch noted, of some parte of that most comfortable frute enioying, which, of the former Ships prepared, And the Citizens to Sea discipline before hand trayned vp, was reasonably expected: Deindè, Magna Classe, optimé{que} ornata, instructa, Graecas quidem Ciuitates, quarum ope subsidio iuuabantur, benignè humané{que} tractauit: Vicinis autem Barbaris Nationibus, Regibus Tyrannis, ostendit Potentiae molem, licentiam{que} audaciam, quacun{que} libitum foret Nauigantium: Maré{que} totum, sub suam ditionem Imperium redigentium.
O, a Sownd Cownsailor and Couragious Capitain, most mete for the Brytish Sea Royalty recouering.
Pericles thy life (certainly) may be a pattern and Rule to the higher Magistrates (in very many points) most diligently, of them, to be imitated.
But, albeit, that such a Graeke Pericles can not, readily, for our purpose, be found out: Yet, it is (Sayd myne Instructor) of some graue and expert men, thought probable, that this Politik Deuise, and humble Aduertisement, can not so sone take effect, as all the States and the whole Commons of this Brytish Impire, may, (for the manifold and waighty Respects declared), both very faithfully desire, and also very quickly be induced, to be, after a most easy manner, Contributary thereunto: vnder the name of perpetuall Beneuolence, for Sea Security.
For, who is there, of this Kingdom: true and naturall borne Subiect (Spirituall or Temporall,) but very willingly wold: and without any his hinderance, could, yerely forbeare (to furder and stablish so marueilous a Benefit publik) The Hundredth Peny, of his Rents and Reuenues: and the Fiue hundredth peny, of his Goods valuation? And after the same rate, is to be vnderstode of all and euery Fraternitie, Guyld, Corporation, Misterie, Brotherhood and Communaltie Corporated or not Corporated, within this Realm of England, Wales, and other the Queenes Maiesties Dominions, their goods and reuenues.
And that, for onely the first and immediatly next ensuing seuen yeres space.
Then, for the second seuen yeres, to pay onely, The Hundred and fiftith peny, of his or their Rents and Reuenues, and the Seuen hundred and fiftith peny of his or their goods valuation, yerely.
yeres expired, to pay for euer, but the half of the first Contribution.
yeres fully expired, (after the day of this decree and Act making,) the Rate to be, yerely, but The Two hundredth peny, of his or their Rents and Reuenues, and the Thousandth peny of his or their Goods valuation, for euer, And that, mean, onely, of all naturall born Subiects, of this our blessed Iland ALBION.
So that, such an exact valuation of their wealth and hability, should not hereafter (in any wise) be a thing to the Subiects and Commons, praeiudiciall: And a cause of greater Charge, or burden to them, in their Ceasments (to come) for any other Publik Seruice, or Commodity, than heretofore, the most generall manner of fauourable leuying, of such other Taxes and Subsidies, hath bene vsed.
But, Beleue, vndoutedly, After that this SEA SECVRITY (with that fauour of the Omnipotent King, which he chiefly beareth to Iustice, and Peace: and by the wisdom, and prudency of the higher powers of this Impire) shall be ones established, and confirmed, in trade of due execution, (either by means here expressed, or better), Vndoutedly, All other extraordinary TAXES, SVBSIDIES, RELIEVES, and LONES, &c. will cease, and vtterly be needles, FOR EVER.
Prouided and excepted alwayes, that no man being in the retinue of the shall with this Contribution be any thing charged: of what degree, or hability so euer he be.
Suerly, Seeing God challengeth the Tenth yerely, and First frutes, continually: in Token of our Thankfulnes toward him, and for Mayntenance of the Leuites, that are of the Spirituall Ministery, Truly: the Tenth of the Tenth, mean, the Hundredth parte of our Reuenues, As it is a les portion then the other, So will many thowsands, be more willing to geue it, and more truly to Recken it, also, then (now adayes) they doo the other: And will Iudge This new Beneuolence, as a gratious, godly, politik Easter Offring, toward the Repayring and new Strengthning of the fowndation and Walls of TEMPLVM PACIS or Solomons Temple, (as it were) mean, of the whole Brytish Monarchie: Wherein, by this means, we may, in Peace, ioyfully, all the dayes of our life, and thankfully, serue the King of Kings, and Lord of Hostes: Little dreading, and les feeling the fury of any forreyn Enemies power.
And thereby, also, be the better hable to cut of, and speedily to
And, as for the Free Denizon, yt is most reasonable and fauourable handling, that he be Contributary herein, The Two hundredth parte of his Yerely Reuenues,
and value in Substance: ioyntly esteemed: And the mere Forreyner (here inhabiting) to be aunswerable, yerely, for the Hundredth parte of his Substance onely.
In their Natiue Cuntry, they know (and we are not ignorant) how far greater Sommes, they haue byn Tributary of, yerely: and not, the Thousand part, to their Commodity so auailable, as this will be: And as they also will gladly acknowledge: Yf they haue a faithfull hart: wishing (as they are bownd in Conscience) the prosperous estate of this Renowmed Kingdom: Which, so charitably and fatherly, in their necessityes, and half voluntary Banishments, hath receyued them, and still protecteth them: in no les Security, then the true and Naturall born Subiects of this Brytish Impire, are protected in: aswell from all forrein violence, as all other Iniuries within this Land,
Also, that euery Forreyner or Alien, (Denizon, or not,) falling not vnder the generall reckning and order of Contribution aforesayd, and notwithstanding, of the Age of seuen yeres, or aboue, shall yerely yeld to this Contribution, fowr pence, euery one, for a Pety Forreyn
Finally, of the wages of all hyred Seruants, the Hundredth Peny, of euery fiue Nobles wages, is to be accownted of, yerely: yf their meat and drink be also allowed them, besides their wages: As most willingly, all Discrete Seruants, English and other, will yeld thereto.
That is, of euery fiue Nobles wages clere, receyued, or to be receiued, onely fowre pence to be due to this Contribution, yerely.
And of any wages vnder fiue Nobles, nothing to be accownted herein, due.
And aswell, for the foresayd forreyner, his or her Pety Curtesy: as also, for all Seruants, their fiue Noble Grote, of Contribution, The Maister, (or he, or She), with whom the sayd Forreyner or Seruant (or being both) is or shalbe abyding (at the tyme of Contribution, or Contributions,) to be charged with the same, for lack of payment therof.
To be playn, and very brief: Who is there, in this whole Kingdom, so Temperate and Thrifty in his expenses: that dispendeth not, yerely, in very vayn, and vtterly vnprofitable Charges, (I will not name some, worse,) the Hundredth part of his yerely Reuenues: and the Fiue hundredth part of the value of his Goods? Let euery man, vnparcially, examin him self, and his own Case, therein.
But, yf we, now, wold leaue of, such vanity, and (in dede) folly, and turn that vayn folly to Ripe wisdom: And that superfluous charge, priuate, to wealth publik: We may be iudged to haue geuen an attentife eare, to the Kingly Prophet: and to haue bin obedient, to his Counsayle: Where he sayeth: Declina malo, fac Bonum: Inquire PACEM, persequere eam. Syr, pardon me pray you: for, though meddle not with the Mysticall and spirituall sense, hereof: (for, am neither Doctor, nor Bacheler of Diuinity: no, nor, of any calling Leuiticall) Yet, truly, this exposition, or application, is not vtterly vnapt for this our purpose, of seeking wayes to preserue the Peace publik, with all forreyn Princes: And to establish the Security therof, perpetually: So far, as humain policy, may make reasonable account, of so likely and circumspect meanes, duly executed.
Sword, keepeth peace: So, this Nauy, by his present readynes, and the Secret of his Circuits, and visitations of sundry forreyn and homish Coasts, obserued: will make the malitious murmurers, and priuy malefactors, of all sortes, to kepe in, and to forbeare their wicked deuises and policies: which, otherwise, against vs, they wold aduenture to execute.
Moreouer, wheras, some are of Opinion, that prety Speede, were nedefull, in the Premisses (as the tickle and perillous State of Christendome, is, at this present:) Truly, in Respect therof, we haue great cause to thank God, for the honest and prudent disposition of some Subiects of this Realm: at whose hands (till Ships enough for the purpose, might aduisedly be built) we may, partly buy, and partly hyre, both in number and goodnes, Ships, sufficient, to serue, in this Case, with all Opportunity.
But, as Concerning any of her Maiesties Principall Nauy, to be among them, now, the first, for Cowntenancing of their Credit, or furnishing of their Strength, he wold not presume, to spke therof: referring (very dutifully) such points, to the great wisdomes of the highest Magistrats, to consider of.
And, Certaynly, if any thing, may (reasonably) be alledged, as a Hinderance, whereby this Incomparable Ilandish Impire, shall be barred (yet longer) from tasting of this most delitious, Comfortable, Cordiall, and preseruatiue frute of Peace and Tranquillity (politikly
assured:) of Wealth and Riches, comming in, abundantly, to Queene
and Subiect: And, of right honorable Renown, and great freendship,
procured both nigh and far: Yf any thing (Sayd he) may seeme of Importance, that, probably and possibly may hinder this Publik Policy, from being put in execution: The first thing may be, a Certayn Dout, which may arise among the graue Cownsaylers, and circumspect Gardians
of this Whether the Threasor, by the former rate, generally in England leuyed and collected into their hands and order, will be sufficient to counteruaile all Charges, ordinary and extraordinary, to such a or no:
Also, they will, or may dout, whether vittailes will hereby wax scarse, and dere, the whole Realm throughout, or no:
And Thirdly, the Poore and faithfull Commons, will on their part, only dout, of the true, due, and iust vsing and Bestowing of the foresayd yerely Beneuolence: and that, perpetually: according to the very godly and politik Intent of the perpetuall Contribution therof.
These three douts, chiesly, being reasonably dissolued, will return to the and other Nauigation matters, thus, a while, set aside.
As for the first: Yf the Touchestone of all Subiects wisdom, that is, the Queene her most excellent Maiestie, and her right honorable and faithfull priuy Counsaill, do like, this Pety Nauy (for the purposes before rehersed) to be set and mainteyned: So that, the same, become not chargeable to her highnes: but be sufficiently prouided for, by the most easy and voluntary Contribution of her louing and faithfull Subiects, and other, (in maner, aboue specified:) Then, it is to be sayd to the Dout of want of Mony necessary: That, yf the ordinary and vniuersall Beneuolence of England, will not suffice (Though it will amount,
Yerely, to aboue an Hundred Thousand pounds) And especially, seeing the greatest Charges will be at the first preparations: yf all things be made and bought new: Yt is (vndoutedly) to be supposed, that many a Thousand of Men and Women: Yea (in dede) the most parte of all the former Contributers, seeing or vnderstanding the first yeres Contribution (before hand, deliuered) so well and duly bestowed, toward their Intent performing, wold, presently (vpon a Second Publik warning, of want,) of their own honest discretion, become (agayn) as Liberall and Beneficiall,
(and, but for this once) Extraordinary, as onely the Six hundredth peny of their Goods and Reuenues, ioyntly, should be of value.
That is, for him that may dispend, by Rents, of Lands, or otherwayes, a Hundred pounds, yerely: and be also, in Goods, worth
pounds, to yeld now, in extraordinary Contribution, xx. s. onely: and neuer, after that, any more extraordinary Ayde, to be, in this behalf, or otherwise, required.
Moreouer, in this Case of want, for such a Publik Benefit furdering (as neuer was the like thereof, to this Brytish Monarchy so probably,
assured) we wold craue, the Charitable and Brotherly Beneuolence (and that onely for this ones, As for the first setting vp, of the sayd And, but, according to this most easy, and Second Rate to be leuyed) of the Inhabitants of Ireland, Iernsey, Garnsey, the Counties of Northumberla~d, Cumberla~d, Westmerland, the Town of vpon Tyne, the Bishoprik of Durham: and of all those Cities, Boroughs, and Townes (onely the Town of Barwick to be excepted herein) which by any Letters Patents, of the Queenes Maiestie, or of her most Noble Progenitors, (otherwise) haue Exemption, Priuilege, Immunities, from paying any Tax, or Subsidy. &c.
And likewise, of the Inhabitants of the Fiue Ports, and euery of their Members: And also of the present Inhabitants within the Liberties, of Romney Marsh.
And therupon, good and sufficient Prouiso to be made, and established, to all and euery of the foresayd extraordinary Ayders, that this their discrete and voluntary Contribution, shall in no case (hereafter) be vnto them any thing praeiudiciall, or dammageable to their Charter or Priuilege of Immunitie.
¶And this Request, with no little Reason, may be offred to their Courtesies, to Consider of: Seeing, not onely, it is for the better and more assured Peace and Tranquillitie enioying, ouer all these Kingdomes of England, and Ireland: and for a marueilous and Incredible wealth, and no les Strength, procuring to the same: But also, forasmuch as, all the former, ordinarily exempted of all Taxes, and Subsidies, &c. shall, or may, by the continuall Seruice of this Nauy, and also by the Threasory therof (hereafter) be greatly ayded: and that (peculiarly) to the lessening both of their Charges, and also of their Danger, many wayes: In respect wherof, such Priuileges, Immunities and Exemptions, were first granted vnto them: and continually haue bin, and are confirmed.
So that, such their extraordinary Beneuolence, shall not seeme merely giuen: no, nor so chargeable vnto them, as lent Good: But, to be Mony most commodiously (for their peculiar Causes, and behoof) somwhat before hand, disbursed.
¶Also, yf it were presently known, that this (vndoutedly) should, for the foresayd exceeding waighty Respects, very shortly, be consydered of: And with conueniency and Opportunity, furdered to the setting furth, and vse therof: vpon that True and sufficiently warrented Assertion, and declaration: How many godly Aldermen,
and other well disposed Marchants, of the City of London: How many a Marchant Venturer, owner: Yea, how many great Staplers, and Clothyers, throughout the whole Realm: Yea, and how many other, of all States and Professions, wold very charitably, in their Legacies, Remember: or, be contented to be put in mynde, of deuout Contribution, or Legacy, toward the Threasory augmenting, for due mayntenance of the foresayd ¶How many a Bishop, Dean, and Archdeacon, &c. With their
own hands, wold (Extraordinarily) be example to the Layity, of turning, Liberally, the Mammon of Iniquitie, to the preseruation of Publik Tranquillity: and the mayntenance of the Politik Security therof, against Forreyn fraude and force: and all Homish possible Rebellions?
¶But, and if the Incredible great, and manifold Commodities ensuing therof, were but had, a yere, two, or three, in proof: (O Lord) What lode wold be layd on, then, among the Godly, wise, and hable Subiects, to the better mayntenance of a bigger Nauy: And of new deuised, more warlik Ships? How many wold contend with other, vertuously, to excell herein: as zealous Benefactors, to the And so, for euer, to remayn recorded: not in boke onely, with pen and Ink marked: but in the harts of all Brytish, and English Posterity: and in their thankfull memories, deeply Imprinted.
Could the deuout zeale, and Intent of our forefathers, be so Beneficiall to Thousands: And, without any Commaundement, or Request Publik, (they being then, in darknes, and beclogged with Superstition) most gladly, be so liberall, to the building of so many fayr Monasteries, &c.
Their decking, and Threasory within: and enduing with Landes, abrode (far and nere) to their charge, of so many Hundred Thousand pownds, as, now, (in manner) are inestimable: And shall we, now, in the clere Sunne shyne of the pure Truthe and Gospell: in the tyme of true Religion, known, and obserued (As we will be cownted of,) Shall we, (I say), be either so ignorant, how to vse our Liberality: Or, so colde in Charity: or so blynde in foresight: Or, so priuatly scraping, and miserably hoording vp: or, so thankles and vnfreendly to the Common State of this kingdom: Where, both, our Ancestors haue receyued their life, mayntenance and wealth: And we our selues, no les: and are most desyrous, that our Childern, Wiues, freends, and Posterity, should enioy as great Commodities, by means of the Publik Society, and the Ciuill Communalty, being preserued in Secure Tranquillity: Shall we (I pray you) in vertuous zeale, and Liberality, and chiefly, in these our Respects, of very needfull and certayn, very Godly and great Commodities enioying, be far Inferior to them, in their Respects, such as they were? We, being in wealth, and Reuenues also, far Richer, now: than they; then were? God forbyd: that so great disorder, and lack of discretion, should be to be suspected now, or to be douted of, in the people and Subiects, of this Godly, wise, and rich Kingdom.
¶And How, can any Man, reasonably doubt of the Hability of so mighty a kingdom, to set furth, and maynteyn most easily, only Three or Fowrscore Tall and Warlik Ships: Where, so many Thowsand Thousands, of folks, are Contrybuters to the Charges requisite? Seeing, only Forty or Fifty worthy Subiects, of their own pryuate Hability, doo very easily, and (in manner) contynually, Maynteyn in trade, at Sea, so many (and more,) such tall Ships: And the same, well Appoynted, well vittayled, well Manned: and they, Duly payd: And chiefly, Seeing Such a of Threescore Tall Ships, and eche of them, betwene eightscore and two hundred, Tun of Burden: And Twenty other smaller Barks, (betwene and Tun,) may be new made, very strong and Warlike: and all, well vittayled, for Six Thowsand, Six hundred, and Sixty Men: and those Men, Liberally waged: And both Ships, and Men, to all needfull purposes, sufficiently appoynted: and so maynteyned continually, and that, very Royally, FOR EVER: for les, then Two Hundred Thowsand Pownds Charges, YERELY, sustayned.
¶Moreouer, In Respect of farder toward the Charges maintayning: Yt is not to be forgotten or neglected, that for a while,
at the first (and perchance, now and then, afterward) this Nauy, is likely to mete with, and to Sease vpon, Diuers Pyrats and Rouers: who, either at broader Seas (you may ges, where) or els, nerer hand, haue made Rauening hauock: And now, they, and their Goods, Threasor, Ships, and all, will fall into the hands, of Our or some parte therof.
Mary, herein, my Instructor, wisheth some Iust and needfull Order to be prouided, and kept inuiolably.
That such Ships, Goods, Threasor: &c, should not rashly, greedily, or disorderly be dealt withall.
As though, we our selues, also, would be come Parteners with Theeues: where, now, we are BY GOD AND OVR GOOD QVEENE, constituted, as Discrete Iusticers faithfull Reformers of manifold Wrongs, at Sea, susteyned: And therin, to execute our Charge, asmuch, and as conueniently, as we may: Therfore, after that such a Pyrat, Ship, and goods, are vnder our safe Custody bestowed: Proclamation: is, so immediatly to be made, that within a Monthe after, (or six weekes space, at the fardest,) yt may be published in sundry chief and most frequented Portes, of this kingdom: lying, (as may vpon sundry Circumstances be gathered) most apt, and toward the places, either from whence those goods came: or toward which, they were to be caryed: with all such necessary Notice and Aduertisement published, by the Proclamation aforesayd, as may be auaylable to help the true Owners to their goods agayne.
Those taken Pyrats, alwayes, can (herein) best Instruct, where, of whom, when, and how, they came by that Booty.
The wares them selues, the Marchants Marks, Letters, Bills, Reconings in that Ship or Ships, with those Pyrats fownd, will also geue some light to such Marchants here, as are best acquainted, with men of those quarters and Cuntryes, from whence, such goods came: Or whither they were to be brought.
And, so, after the first Proclamation made, euery six weekes after, the Like to be made, in place conuenient, as before: Till a whole Yere and a Day space, be fully expyred, after the Day of the sayd Pyrats taking.
And, yf, within that yere and a Day space, No Claym be made: That, then only, and not before, of All such goods, (not yet Claymed), Sale be made, by Auction Publik.
Prouided allways, that of wares, which wold, by such length of tyme, take great hurt, or Perish: (in good order of Auction,) Mony be made in due tyme.
And then, owt of all manner of that Auction Mony, all Charges, vntill that tyme, sustayned, to be first Discharged: And so, the whole Some therof, remayning: And the Threasor also of Gold, Syluer, and ready Mony, (Yf there be any,) is to be distributed, after this manner, Yf it shall by the Higher Powers, be so liked of:) Diuide the Some, and Value of all, into Ten equall Partes.
are to be allotted to the Threasory of the Exchecquer Royall of our Souerayn: to the Threasory of the to be shared among the Capitaynes, Souldyers, and Mariners: That is to say, among all the Men of those Ships, which did present an actuall seruice, in the taking and Maistering of the foresayd Pyrat, or Pyrats: and one parte of those Ten, to be Due to the Lord Admirall of England, for the tyme being.
And as concerning the Shares, which are to be parted among the sayd Seruitors of the This, is Iustice: That (generally) it be distributed, according to the proportions of their Monthes wages: one compared to the other.
And (particularly,) Od Rewarde, owt of the Nauies Threasor, is to be cheerfully and thankfully geuen, to whosoeuer (at that tyme,) did most valiant and manfull seruice.
And so, for a Second, Third, and Fowrth. &c. Yf it so fall owt.
¶And of all Goods, Threasor, Mony, and Iuells &c. By meanes of the foresayd Proclamations (or otherwise.)
Duly challenged: After all former charges, for the preseruing therof hitherto, shall be accordingly
payd, by the Lawfull Challendger: And vpon his paying also, only the Tenth of the cleare value, of the so challenged Goods (the sayd charges Deducted) Restitution, presently, is to be made to the sayd Challenger: And then, that Tenth, is to be distributed, in manner before by
Yf the same be so liked of, By our Souerayn.
annexed, will make it most Certayn, that Threasor will not faill vs, for the Royall and Triumphant maintenance, of this our And, that is: Yf yt wold please the Queene her most gracious goodnes, to be so bountifull to the Commons, as to Geue, Graunt, and Assure FOR EVER, to the Threasory of the foresayd all that her Right, Title, and Interest to the TENTH of all Forreyn Fishings, within the Royall Limits and Iurisdiction of her BRYTISH SEAS of England and Ireland: where, now, No man, in her highnes behalf, or to her vse, receiueth of any Forreyn Fisherman, any one Peny, in token of their dutifull acknowleging her Royallty, within her due Limits of the foresayd Seas.
There is a dubble Title, and a Third Reason, of this Lawfull demaund: The Titles, are these: Aswell for occupying those Our peculier Seas, and (to their great Gayn) otherwise, then as a Common Sea Passage: And also, for that they shall not be, nor ought to be exempt of all Tything, there, toward God his parte: where, with les cost, they receiue greater Benefit, then any Husbandman, of Tylth of the Earth.
In Respect (therfore) of Gods Glory: the Royall Authority, in our own Coasts, will Induce them, By Right and Might, to Remember both God, and Queene, by whose fauours, they are so greatly benefited, within our forsayd Sea Limits.
Which Limits (According to the Iudgement of myne Instructor,) Are, in all places, to be accounted, directly to the Myddle Seas ouer, Betwene the of her own Kingdom (and of all Pety Iles, to the sayd Kingdom appertayning) and the Opposite of all Forrein Princes: And in all Seas, lying immediatly betwene any two of her own Coasts or the whole breadth of the Seas ouer (in such places) is, by all Reason and Iustice, appropriat to her peculiar Iurisdiction and SEA ROYALLTY.
The Proportion of the Equity of this Iudgement, dependeth somwhat vpon the Ciuill Law, concerning Partition or Propriety of Iles growing vp in fresh water Riuers.
And it is not vnreasonable, to deme Seas betwene diuers next Kingdoms, to be in like and Analogicall Condicion, in respect of King and King: As fresh water Riuers, are, in Respect of Priuate Subiects, of one Kingdom, whose Grownds are lying on both sydes of the sayd Riuers: Though the Stream and waters therof (after a sort) be accownted Common.
Diuers priuate Groundes, haue, through them (by Praescription so wonne, or otherwise purchased:) Some, Iter: Some, Actum: Some, Viam: Yet, no man, that, may there lawfully pas, may also lawfully dig, to his gayn (or otherwise) In Itinere, Actu, or Via, of that sort, without furder and due licence obteyned.
So, all high Wayes, are cownted Common and Publik, to pas in: But, for any Priuat Man, (though he be a Subiect,) in any parte therof, to dig for a Quarry of Stone, or myne for Owre, or Stonecoles &c. Yt is not lawfull: though he wold fill it vp again, as well as he found it first.
So, here, the Brytish Seas, are Common, and free for all Ships of all Nations to pas in, and vpon: But, as co~cerning the Fish, vnder the water of those Seas: (Which Fish, God Nature, bringeth fauourably within the peculier Bownds Iurisdictio~ of Our Royall Precinct:) No Forrein Subiect, ought, customably, or otherwise (presumptuously) therin, to cast Net for the same: or, (vsually or presumptuously) to serch, or drag, to his priuate gayn, therin, without the especiall
good leaue, of the Maiesty of our Souerayn Queene (the vndouted Lady and Mistres, of the Sea Coasts next adiacent) first obteyned: or, generally to be
hoped for: Or, at the least, not expresly known to the
For, we will, to all our Opposite Neighbors, also attribute, allow, graunt and yeld as good Right and Interest, for the other Moyty of the Seas, to their Shore and Coasts appropriat, as we do now challendge, for our peculyar half.
So, that, this is most Iust, Conscionable, and Godly: Herein, To do, as we wold be done vnto.
Which poynt, tendeth greatly to the Assurance of all good Amity, and peaceable Traffique contynuing, with our faithfull, or louing Neighbors.
And, Seeing Iustice, and God, is on our side, what Shame and discredit ys yt, or may it be, to vs, with all Christen Nations, (that shall truly vnderstand the Case:) yf we, like faynt harted and degenerated Meacocks, should, now, make dainty, shrink, or be afrayd, valyantly to season on, and prudently to enioy, this so manifest Right and possession of our Sea Limits: and that, euery way? being, in dede (where they are greatest) in respect of other Princes late Attempts, and Succes, of enlarging and settling their new deuised Sea Limits: not so great a parte, as a drop of water, is, in respect of a pottle.
Can that Pety Marchantlyke king of Portingall, haue any reasonable Pretence: either, by Law of God, or Man, to inuade and posses: not, Quod nullius in Bonis erat, aut est: But, many other mens Ancient and lawfull Possessions, and Kingdoms: though they were, (and some yet be) Infidels? And that, in a course much longer, from his own, little, rightfull, and originall Kingdom, than half the world is about, in the greatest Circle: yea, after the shortest Cut or Cours, which any way, they can be brought, to the bounds of their late forced Royallty? And shall not we, haue the Courage and skill, rightfully to enioy the very Precinct of our own Naturall Ilandish walls, and Royallty of our Sea Limits, here, at home, and before our doores? Can the Portugale King (by the Popes Authority) cause the King of Spayn, to make his Nauies and Armados to forbeare comming within any portion of the East half of the whole world? (as, to enioy, or be maister of any Sea, Mayn, or Iland therein:) And also, will the King of Spayn, be contented, so, to condescend and allow vnto the Portugale, vpon condition, that the other half of all the world (Westward) mought be at the like his choys and Iurisdiction? (And though, in dede, betwene them two, and before God, this Couenaunt Negatiue, is firm, and inuiolably to be kept: Yet, neither of them, by any law, of God or Man, can farder season on, as their New possessions, but, as we, and other, lawfully, may: That is, where they finde, Quod Nullius in Bonis est ,) Can they, honorably (Quoth he) thus presume, and with a Christien, Conscience, Deale, Diuide and Share the whole world, betwene them two only quo Iure, quáue Iniuria as much as they can: And will not they, or must not they, and all our opposite Neighbours, be so reasonable, yea and honorable with all, as to alow, like, and commend our wisdoms and Industry, to enioy the skyrts and Purlewes (as it were) of our Brytish, naturall, and appropriat Sea Limits? And that, in the most decent, peaceable, and freendly manner, that Princely Counsaylors harts can deuise, and most discrete Capitaynes, vnder them, can execute? Well, (Sayd he) my Hope is, that vnder our good Souerayn Elizabeth (ere long, if it be her pleasure) the AEquity of this Case, will, or may, be maryed, with the Security of the whole State of this Impire: And that they two, will bring furth COMMON
FAME: Three most lawfull Brytish Childern, and long wished for, of the true, Brytish, and Christian Druides, they being also, Politicall Philosophers, and not Sophisticate.
Beleue Pericles his Saying, betymes: Magnum est, enim, potiri Mari.
Note, here, (I pray you,) a fowrfolde wise purpose, vnder One golden Saying: to the Brytish Monarchy (at this Instant) most aptly, applyable: SI INSVLANI ESSEMVS.
Besides all this: Yt is most ernestly and carefully to be considered, that our Herring Fishings, against Yarmouth chiefly, haue not (so Notably to our great Iniury and los, and the great and Incredible gayn of the Low Cuntries) bin traded, but from xxxvj. yeres agoe, hitherward.
In which tyme, as they haue in wealth, and number of Boats, and Men, by little and little, increased: and are now become very rich, strong, proud, and violent: So, in the Race of the self same tyme running, the Coasts of Norfolk, and Suffolk, next to those Fishing places adiacent, are decayed in their Nauy: to the Number, of
Sayle, And they, from Threescore, to a hundred Tun, and vpward: besides Crayers, and other.
Wherupon, (Besides many other dammages, thereby, susteyned publikly:) These Coasts, are not hable to trade Iseland, as in tymes past, they haue done: to no little los, yerely, to the of this Kingdom.
But, the Herring Busses, hither, yerely resorting, out of the Low Cuntries (vnder King Phillip his dominion) are, aboue.
The North Seas Fishing, (within the English Limits,) are yerely possessed of
The Western Fishings, of Hake, and Pylchard, are yerely possessed by a great Nauy of Frenchmen: who, yerely, do great Iniuries, to our poore Cuntrymen, her Maiesties faithfull Subiects.
Strangers also, enioy at their pleasure, the Herring Fishing of Alamby, Wyrkington, and White Hauen, vpon the Coast of Lancashire.
And in Wales, about Dyfi, and Aberysthwith, the plentifull Herring Fishing, is enioyed by
But (In Ireland) Baltemore, is possessed yeerly, (from Iuly to Michelmas) most commonly, with
Say of Spanyards: entring there, into the Fishing, at a Streict, not so broad, as half the breadth of the Thames, against
Where, our late good King Edward (the Sixth,) his most honorable Priuy Counsaill, was of the mynde (once) to haue planted a strong Bulwark: for other waighty Respects, as well, as for his Maiesty to be Souerayn Lord of the Fishing of Myllwyn and Codd, there.
Blackrock, ys yerely fished by or, somtimes Sayle of Spanyards, and Frenchemen.
But, to Recken all, should be to tedious to you, and make my hart to Ake, for sorrow.
&c. Yet, Surely, think it necessary, to leaue to our Posterity, some Remembrance of the places, where, our rich Fishings els, are, about Ireland: As at Kilsale, Cork, Carlingford, Saltesses, Dungarwen: Yowghall, Waterford, La foy, The Band, Calibeg. &c.
And all, chiefly enioyed, as securely and freely, from vs, by Strangers, as yf they were within their own Kings peculiar Sea Limits: Nay, rather, as yf those Coasts, Seas, and Bayes, (&c) were of their priuate and seuerall purchases: To our vnspeakable los, discredit, and discomfort: And to no small danger (farder) in these perillous tymes, of most subtle Trecheries, and fickle fidelity.
And, as for Ireland Fishings, some Towardnes of good Pollicy, and somwhat like reason of prouidence, was in the heds of the honorable Counsailors and Parlement Senators to King Edward the fowrth: When, in the fifth yere of his Raigne, this Act, (among sundry other,) was established: That no Ship, or other vessell, of any forreyn Cuntry, shall go to Fishing in the Irish Cuntryes: And, for Custome to be payd, of the vessell that commeth from forreyn Landes to Fishing.
Farder to vrge, or more particularly to specify the Conclusions, and reasonable Sequeles, as well of the words of the Act, as the Intent of the Act making, is needles, in this place.
Now, then, who can dout, (to begin withall) but that it is a most reasonable and freendly Request, of all these forreyn Fishermen, to require, (with all circumstances of Humanity, Courtesy, and Freendship, therin, and thereto vsed,) The Tenth onely, of all their yeerly Fishings: by such means, as, most conueniently for them, and to our behoof, best, we may receiue the same: In Token, of their reasonable Acknowledging the ROYALTY of this Brytish Monarchy, in the self same Brytish Seas, and Coasts, to be, by God and Nature established: where, they receiue so great Commodity: and where, from hence forth, no Iniury by any Man of ours, shall be to them done, or offred: But, their thankfulnes to God, (in respect of Tithe) and their Freendly duty to the Royall Maiesty, and Imperiall Dignity of our Souerayn Lady Elizabeth, (within her own Sea Limits) is, thus, in rightfull, decent, and freendly manner, required.
¶And here, also, the Third Reason of Demaunding the forsayd Tenth before spoken of,) is to be playnly specifyed: Which is this.
Wheras, the Herring Busses, and other Forreyn Fishermen, haue, heretofore, vsed to be at great Charges, with hyring Wafters and certayn Ships (of their own Cuntry) appointed Warlike: for their Garde and Defence, in the tyme of their Fishings, within our Brytish Sea Limits: Now (by the Politik order, and valiant Industrie of her Maiesties executed) No Pyrat, Rouer, or Pilfrer, nor any Warryour, in Ship of War: No, nor Executioner of any Letter of Mark, shalbe permitted to vse, or haunt any of our Brytish Seas: and therefore, None of these sorts, shall brede vnto the Forreyn Fishermen, any Disturbance, Los, or hyndrance, in the tyme of their sayd Fishings: And, besides this, by the means of the sayd (contynually maynteyned at the forsayd Seas,) all manner of their Merchantlike Ships, at all tymes, may freely and safely pas, and frequent, not only the Brytish Narrow Seas, but also Diuers other Seas: being within, or any thing nere the Walk and Circuits, of the same
Wherfore, In regard of their sayd great Charges Sparing: And for such Securitie enioying in the tyme of their Fishings, (Which two points, are by our supplyed, and to them procured): And in regard of the inestimable Los, and Dammage, assuredly preuenting, (against all Pyrats, Warriers, and all other violence of Man,) Which, els, might happen to their Merchantlike, very rich Laden Ships, Hulks, or other, passing within, or nere the Circuits, which are (ordinarily and extraordinarily) of our to be vsed and frequented: (Whereby, also, among their own Nation, great Sommes of Mony, oftentymes, lost by Assurance taking, may, now, be saued.)
In Regard (I say) of these fowr, their great Benefits, by this receyued: And in regard of the Fyfth inestimable Benefit, and Riches, yeerly receyued, of the Fish taken within our appropriat Sea Limits.
And Sixthly, in respect of the Honor, Reuerence, Priuilege, and Praeeminence, which (By Law) is Due vnto her Royall Maiesty, enioying the Lawfull Possession of the Brytish Sea Royalty (Though, for a few yeres, last passed, yt hath byn by Pyrats, and other, somwhat abused:) And Seuenthly, In respect of Gods parte, and their Forrein Tythe, Duly and thankfully paying, of our peculiar Commodities, by them receiued: And that, the rather: Bycause her Maiestie doth geue the same, For the preseruation of So many, of sundry Nations, from the Rauyn of the Pyrat, and mayntenance of Godly Peace, and good Order, in her Royall Sea Circuits.
And Eighthly, in Token of their Freendly, Honest, and Iust meaning toward vs: And in token of their syncere and vnfayned making great Account of our sound Amitie, and good Peace with them to be continued: In respect, of all the Premisses, The forsayd TENTH of Forrein Fishing (as before) demaunded, and agreed vpon, FOR EVER: may seme, both, on our behalf, and also, on the behalf of all the honest and well aduised Forreiners (whom it doth, or shall concern,) to be very reasonably, iustly, and freendly demaunded, decreed, and accorded vpon, FOR EVER: That is to say, so long tyme, as the sayd shall enioy, the ROYALL SOVERAINTY of the BRYTISH SEAS: according to this first Plat, or, some better Institution, thereof.
Yt is also to be known and Noted, for our Comfort herein, toward the Charges of the sayd That the Tenth, yeerly, of all Forreyn Fishings, within the Sea Limits, to her Maiesties Royalty appropriat, is aboue an Hundred Thousand pownds, de Claro
Gwicciardine in his Description of the Low Cuntry, geueth good Euidence of one portion therof.
As, of our Herring Fishing alone: (what say I, Ours? Nay, the Flemish Herring Fishings, in our English or Brytish
For, he recordeth, that the Low Cuntries, make yeerly Thousand pounds sterling, of those Herring, Salted and Barelled: Rebating the Charge of the Salt.
By this, you may haue a gros gesse, of farder Reconing.
But, how soundeth this Latin Record, in a true discrete Brytish Subiects eares: either, in respect of the los susteyned, in Reuenue: or, in Respect of some Disgrace, redounding to them, that can Redres the same: yf, it be amysse? Est etiam eodem tempore, Copiosissima Halecis Piscatura, in Littoribus Angliae Scotiae: quae, per Piscatores Flandriae instituitur: quibus posteà, sortitur Nomen: vt, Romam ille Piscis delatus, Halec Flandrorum appeltur
The same Sea, is called MARE BRYTANICVM: And the be called of all Nations likewise LITTORA BRYTANIAE, Littora Angliae: And yet, the Herring, therin taken, are called HALEC FLANDRORVM Nay, we our selues, call them, Flemysh Herring: Yea, we our selues, being beaten from our own Fishings, and Fishing places, are glad to buy our own Commodity, of Strangers: Against all Reason, Conscience, Law, and good Ciuill Policy.
Yt were a shame, to allege, that they are woorthy to enioy our Fishings, as Lords therof: bycause, they can skill to handle and order the Herring, better, than
We must take hede of that Reason, betimes: For, so, they can do our Wooll, and vndressed Cloth: the more wicked or vnskilfull, are our workmen at home, the whiles: And the les of our wooll, and vndressed Cloth, wold haue bin put into their hands, to try such Maistries therewith: &c.
Then, By Gods grace, we may (comfortably) thus Answere to this first Dowt, In the name of the whole Body Politicall.
Seeing, Our Reuenues, now, and wealth, are greater, then was our forefathers: And Seeing, we are sufficiently perswaded of the manifold Publik Benefits, such, as neuer hapned to our forefathers (for all their Incredible foresayd great Charges) And which, by all humayn coniecture, are like to ensue: not only to our selues, but also to our Wiues, Children, Kindred, Freends: And so, to this whole Brytish Kingdom, vniuersally: both now, and euer, after our dayes: We will (say we) be found, through Gods help, so well aduised, so discrete, so liberall herein, and bountifull, as, aboue all things, this Publik Peace, and Generall Security, chiefly requireth, that we should be: And the Hundred Thowsand pounds, all manner of wayes, to these vses, collected, will amount to be so many, as we throughly are perswaded: (These last discourses, well considered: and two more, which we, of our selues, with great reason and probability, will annex hereunto) That, contrary to the first dout, we confidently, now, may trust, that, not onely, for this a sufficient masse of Threasor, will easily and spedily be contributed: But, great Ouerplus also, will thereof grow (ere long.)
a Parte therof, shall be employed toward the Relief of such poore Men, as either by Sicknes, maym, or vnweldynes of age, are to be dismissed from the sayd Nauy: and other, to be taken in, in their roomes.
Part, toward the finding of the poore Widdowes, and Orphanes of such Men, as in good seruice, in the sayd Nauy, haue manfully spent their lyues:
Parte, toward a sufficient Stipend, for in sundry, and apt Ports of this Iland, to be resident, and ready to serue, Mathematically and Mechanically, with Quadrants, Rings, Chartes, Sea Compasses, Sandglasses, and such other furniture, as to the charge and Seruice of Pylotage, and Maistership in the foresayd Nauy, may be found needfull: each one appoynted to Ships: (or a Quarter of the whole how great so euer it do grow hereafter:) To those Ships, mean, that are to the Coasts, next him, assigned.
And those Pylots, First, to be chosen out of them, that haue, allready, become expert at Sea: And then, by the of England (for the tyme, being) to be informed farder, as appertayneth: And that, euery yere, once, by their appointed repayre, made vnto him, at place certayn.
parte, for Preparation of Store, of things necessary to the sayd Nauy: And eche thing, excellent good, and perfect in his kinde.
parte therof, to be bestowed toward necessary Hauens, Harboroughes, Ports, Blockhouses &c. mainteyning: or, in most needfull places, new making.
Parte, in building euery yere, some excellent Ships of war, for the foresayd
Forreyn Discoueries making: for Gods glory, the and the Honorable Renown of this Ilandish Impire.
Wherupon, also, dependeth the First of our two discourses, before spoken of.
For, so may parte of the Threasory of the be employed, toward New Discoueries making, that, of all such Discoueries, the half Charges may be Contributed out of the Threasory of the foresayd And so,
likewise, the half clere Gayn therof comming, to be to the sayd Threasory due, and answered accordingly: by like, and like number of Officers, as are for the rest of the Society of such Discoueries.
Greater Publik Equitie, is in such a manner of New Societies making: and with better order, and more ayd, may greater things be attempted, than hitherto haue bin: with the Timerous myndes of a Few: and therefore, with their to to straight Allowances, at their first Onset giuing.
(oftentimes) not only their first Charges haue bin lost: But also, the Attempts discreditted: as of things, either vnlucky, vnlikely, or where, none of all these points, hath bin the occasion of such yll Succes.
By this means, all Marchants, and other, that Partners of Priuileged voyages, shall be, not only vnhindred, of their Gayn: but, rather, greatly furdred, to bring that to pas, by Publik Ayd, and to the Benefit Publik, and Priuate also: which, before, with much adoo, could scarse be maistered: to make them (a few parteners of such Societies) to become, Priuately, Welthy thereby.
Hereuppon also, the Queenes Maiesties Customes, both owtward and homeward, will greatly be encreased: And all the Commons, and Body of the Realm, will grow in greater loue, with the Marchants Dooings: and better like of the Princes establishing of such Priuileged Societies: When, the wary and carefull Diligence of the Merchant, and the gracious Priuilege of the Prince, shall (PROPORTIONALLY) be beneficiall to ONE, FEW, and ALL.
(Which is the chief Mark, that One, a Few, and All, shold shote at.)
For, so, shall such Dooings, be asmuch auaylable to the then, as, now they are to the Priuate Lucre of a Few: And that, with Publik Dammage.
Seeing, the self same things, which they Bring in, or Deale with, now, be Deerer bought than they were, before any such New Trade or Society, therin Priuileged.
¶And in like sorte, is to be sayd, in this our Second Discours, of all other Homish Discoueries, to be made within the Queenes Maiesties Dominions, of her Brytish Impire.
For, most certayn yt is, that there is Naturally couered in the Earth, and vnknown, in these Dominions, so great Riches of Lead, Tyn, Copper, Syluer, Gold, and Diuers kyndes of other very commodious and proffitable Minerall Matters, as might incredibly encrease both the Threasor Royall, and also of all the Partners Publik and Priuate: who, should Proportionally, be at all Charges, about such Minerall Discoueries, to be throwghly and Maisterly executed.
And by the way: How think you? Doth it not sting the Naturall born Subiects, that Strangers shall be grafted into their places: and their Publik and priuate Parte of Benefit, to be, thereby Cut of? The Strangers Science, and Cunning, might be recompenced, and their Charges allowed: But, so vnnaturally to deale with the True and Naturall Body Politik, yt is not Necessary: will say no farder.
And, if Strangers, wold not so deale, other, wold: and will be found.
This thing, being once, by due Publik order and Authority, established: How many an Owre, and Myne, (very rich,) wold be disclosed and pointed to: Where, they are: and Minerall Examples, of great Cumfort, shewed by diuers Priuate Men? (Ientlemen and other) who, now, will neuer open their Mouthes, to disclose the same: Bycause, in their own Grounds, where their Propriety (by Gods law, and the Law of Nature) should be, to them, most beneficiall of all Men: now, (as the manner, yet, is) their parte, wold be least, of all other.
But, when, with better Allowance to the Prince, and the Proprietary Owner of the Soyle also, (where any Gayn may rise by Myning) and with some great Publik Commodity (as to the Threasory of the these Minerall and Mettall woorks, shall be followed, Then, Priuate Men, will not grudge, though or an hundred other Priuate Partners, haue great Gayn of their peculiar ground.
And therupon (Say we) the Commodity, all manner of wayes, will arise greater, than euer it will do, otherwise, by such Societies, as they now are.
And vpon this Consideration, that, of their Perpetuall Beneuolence, for Sea Security, Some portion therof, shall be employed to such Publik vses, as both the whole Body of the Realm, may vndoutedly haue some sensible and certayn proof, that their Publik Threasory of the doth, as proportionally encrease, as any, or a few Priuate Mens Coffers els, before, were, or (by good order) mought haue bin, by such Societies, well amended: vpon this Consideration (Say we) How gladly, and how readily, will euery Man be Contributer therunto, after the most easy Rate, and proportion prescribed? And making this Reconing among them selues, (ouer and besides all the former marueilous great Benefits Publik, rehearsed:) Thus, will they, then, say: Yea Mary: This, is like, in dede: When, our Common Threasory, is as carefully, and discreetly augmented, by the wisdom and Authority of the Higher Magistrates, and the witty and Circumspect trauailes of our Parteners, (Marchants, and other, whosoeuer) As, before, by such Priuileges, All, was intended and procured for the Benefit onely of a few.
And chiefly, Seeing, before, the gaynfull wares and things, wherof they were Parteners, were, by their vnhabilities (not insatiable Couetousnes) that dealt with those Attempts: or by the manner, as they dealt with them, become very dere: and derer, than before such their Societies established.
Reason perfect none can be yelded, why it should so be: But, this Single soule Allegation, is often repeated: The great Charges, which hitherto haue byn layd on their Shoulders, in that peculiar Trade of their Society.
And therfore, assone as they are in possession of any thing, to raise Mony on: they think it politikly done, to make presently their Reconing of their whole Charges hitherto susteyned: And so, by and by, to begyn to raise the pryces of their things, higher, than they found them, before their new Societies erected: to hasten, thereby, their discharge, or Recompence of Dammages (say they) as yet susteyned.
And so, by that means, the poore Commons, buying the same wares derer, than before: become (seely Soules) Contributers to these few Mens priuate wealth amending: But, to the decaying and weakening of the wealth and hability of the Commons.
And therfore, by the prescript of humayn Reason, yt is a more perfect Politicall Ordonance, so, before hand to ease all such disordered Charges, that, both, Rich
Forreyn New Trades, and great Threasor, may substancially and throughly be brought in, and purchased to this Kingdom: publikly, as well, as priuatly: And also, that Gods great Bountifulnes,
Couertly bestowed vpon this Incomparable Ilandish Monarchy, may, by Publik Ayde also, be so brought to light, handling, and vse, as the whole Commons, hereby, may in their become wealthyer: And pryces of such things as (either one way, or the other) are gotten: may be either kept low, or brought low: That, the greatest parte of this Kingdom, (which are the poorer sort) may, both, laude and bles God, for the wisdom, Charity, and Iustice, of their Gouernors (Wherupon also, they will both better loue them: And for very loue, be more affrayd, to them.)
And also, vniuersally, all the Realm ouer, the true and faithfull Blessing and prayer of all honest Subiects, may be concurrent with, and assistant to, all such honorable and Publik Attempts, either
Homish: for the better succes therof obtaining, by Gods mercy: wherewith, these our two brief Discourses, in this place, shall be finished.
These Ten Generall, and Extraordinary means, of increasing the Threasory of the in this place, may be thought sufficient, for the probable Dissoluing of the first Dowt.
And, as for the second Obiection, yt is more easy and certayn, to put that point, owt of all Dowt.
mean, as Concerning Scarsity, and Dearth, of Vittailes, suspected or Dowted, by the continuall vittailing of this Nauy.
Mary, herein, some forecast must be vsed: as, sundry other, in other points, are.
For, as the Men, to Furnish the forsayd Nauy with, are to be chosen, (and that, with Diuers Considerations) owt of all Shires, and Coasts of this Realm of England: So, likewise, the vittailes, are, so, to be prouided for, that the whole Realm, may yelde the same: euery parte, according to the fertility of the Soyle: And according to the Store to be reserued, for their Seruice, actuall or possible, otherwise.
And that is very needfull: yf, against forreyn Enemy, we should nede a Mayn Army (one, or mo,) by land, any way, toward Coast or Border: or, for the vittailing, in tyme of nede.
And, seeing the Vittailes, shall be so indifferently, or proportionally prepared, all the Realm ouer (as before,) How can any one party, in this Publik, and Case, finde him self straightly, vnduly, or vniustly, dealt withall? And, as the Vittailes, and Men, should rise, (after a sort) ioyntly and proportionally, within the places correspondent: Store alwayes to be reserued: as sayd: (And such, about the Riuer of Thames chiefly, and within certayn myles therof, And in other Quarters: as, both for the City of London, continually: And the in tyme of nede, may be [as it hath bin] seruisable:) So, should the Ships, receiue those Men and Vittayles in, at Twenty sundry Places, or Ports, in England.
Now, seeing then, this Vittayle, thus orderly and indifferently prepared, out of all Places, is to be bestowed on yea, and them, our own Cuntrymen: And not, on FORREYNER, SCOT, FRENCH, FLEMISH, DANE, or SPANIARD, &c.
And some of them, either Sonnes, or Brothers, or Fathers, or Cosens, or Kinsemen, or Singular Freends: Yea, some, Esquyers, some Knights, some Barons: And some of them, Landlords, to sundry of vs at home, here remayning: Fourthly, Seeing, this Vittaile is to be bestowed on them, who do, and will aduenture their lyues, in all Casualties and dangers of the Sea: And against all violence of Pyrate, or any open warryor: And that, not, for any their own Priuate Quarrell: But for the Publik Safety, and Security, of all England and Ireland.
Not, for thyne, and myne, alone: But, for the Safegard and prosperous Estate, of Millions of Men, Women, and Children, within this Monarchy, on Land: (and by this means,) at their ease, quyet, and pleasure, remayning.
Considering then, well and ernestly, all those generall Respects: What true and Sound member, is there, of this Common wealth: and faithfull desirer of the blessed Peaceable Security, of England and Ireland, vnder our Souerayn Empres, our most Gracious Elizabeth: who, will not (in a manner) be willing, the Charges to be borne (parte and parte like) the whole Realm throughout? wherewith, to bestow meate and drink, on them, continually: that refuse no one day, or a moment (yf occasion be offred) to aduenture their hart blud, lyfe, and Lymmes, for vs: And on Seaboord, continually, to endure hard dyet and lodging: for Commodities innumerable, of both these whole Kingdoms? But, it is not so meant: as, to haue any farder Contribution of purs, then is before spoken of.
But, what is he, (Yea, what is he, say agayn?) is he, a sound member of the a faithfull Subiect to our good Queene Elizabeth: or, a Charitable Christian, that either wold (in this seruice, or at any tyme els) hide Corn, or other vittayle, from Publik Ayde, and Or els, wold not be content, to receiue the due value, and reasonable Pryce therof, very gladly? But, most miserably, wretchedly, couetuously, yea vnchristianly, (I will not say, Trayterously) wold desire (now chiefly) to enhance the price of Corn, and Vittayles, to the great pinching of the poore at home: And perchance, for a Trayterous means, to hinder the vittayling of the foresayd or, to make it odious, or doutfully thought of, to some: as though, it were a iust occasion, of prices of Corn and vittayles starting vp: more now, then before? O, vayn, blynde, Couetous Miser (who so euer he be, that is so mynded.)
Thou, and thy like, and that of late dayes, when no Army, or Nauy, hath bin to be vittayled, hast, on the sudden, and in the tyme of great Store, all the Realm ouer, (euen then) God knoweth, vpon what wicked Intent, or misconstruing, or light Credit geuing to Coniecture, found in some new Three halfpeny Prognostication: hast, most vnreasonably enhaunsed the Prices of Corn, Butter and Chese: And at other tymes, of Beofs, and Muttons, &c.
Pray thee, be Reasonable: and think truly: and make Reckening with me, Christianlike; and like a good Member of this And, as a true Subiect, to our Souerayn.
What, may be the true cause, of Dearth (whensoeuer it pleaseth God, to vse that his skourge?) Any other thing, but Want of Corne, or Vittayles? That Want, yf God send yt, is eyther by the Ordinary Causes Naturall, taking effect, according to the Predestined Plat of this whole wordls aeconomie and contynuance: Or, it is, by Extraordinary Means, of Gods sending: And that, Diuersly, and in diuers tymes, and States of the Corne, or Cattayle &c.
These, be true Dearths, vpon great wants of Corn, or Cattayle to be had: Or, at the least, to be had so good, as is behoofull for Mans bodily Sustenance? All other Dearths, that come not of Want, by Diuine means: are either by
Fraudulent Want: As, through Corne, and Vittayles stolne, and Priuily conueyed to our Enemyes, or Fickle freends: for Priuate gayn only: to the hinderance of the Or, by falsly Pretended Want: As the Vnchristianlike Practise, of such Caterpillers, and Rauening Wolues: (Deuouring Come and Cattell) wold make the Commons beleue.
And, when, Abundance and Sufficiency is, to make and Wrast a Dearth: by selling Three Quarters of Wheat, of the very value (then) of fowr: And Three Oxen, of the very value of fowr: and so, of Shepe &c.
What a Deuouting, and Rauening, is this? Of to Devoure and consume one: and the same, neuer more to be hard of, in this And this, only, for his most Priuate Gaynes sake, to be Bagged, or Chested vp, for his Idoll, to behold or Delight in, As in his strength, and furniture: ready to mainteyn hym, in other wicked purposes: And (as God knoweth) foolish with some of that (so miserably and diuelishly scraped together; or violently, in manner, wrasted out of the poore Commons hands, and mouthes) to be at Charges, to enclose some parte of the Commons, from a poore Village, or Township.
With some, to buy his neighbours House, or Farme, ouer his hed: and so, to make him freends, of the Mammon of Iniquity.
Nay, Nay, make himself, the Carefull and doting louer, of wicked Mammon: The Diuell Infernall, and not of God, nor his Members: Nor the members of the Yea, many at Thousand of such, as, eche one of them, is more profitable and Comfortable to the of England, than a Thousand such Mammons dearlings are.
mean the Maryner, the Soldyer; the Ientleman, Esquyer, and Knight, yea and Baron: now, Tost and Turmoyled at Seas: being the Publik Watchmen, Garde, and Champions, for the most Blessed State of Tra~quillity publik, in this Sacred Monarchy, preseruing.
And no les, is the Error and disorder vsed in this Kingdom, of Trade, and Monopolie two greuous hindrances, to the
Iacobus Episcopus Pacensis sayd very well, in his book De Republica: dedicated to the King of Spayn: Ne oneret
Annona, Vaenalium iniqua sint: animaduertere oportet in DARDANARIOS, qui praeemunt, vt ea postea Carius vendant.
Sed illa, omniumest vlissima, quae vetat, Ne quisquam vnquam frumenm vt vendat.
Ea enim est, vt res frumentaria, iustis vendatur, vilitas Annonae
Quamobrem, plurimùm interest, vt ea Lex Conseruetur: qui secus fecerit, acerrimè coerceatur.
And as for MONOPOLIE this, had the same Simancas Noted, out of his Constitutions.
Iubemus, ne quis cuiuscun{que} Vestis, vel Piscis, vel cuiuslibet alterius ad victum, vel al quemcun{que} vsum pertinentis Speciei, Monopolium audeat exercere: Neue quis, illicitis habitis Conuentionibus, aut pacisci, vt Species Corporam negociationis, non minoris quàm inter se statuerint, vaenundentur.
quo{que} artifices, aliorum{que} Operum penitus arceantur, pacta inter se Componere, vt ne quis, quod Commissum sit, Opus, impleat: ant iniunctam alteri solicitudinem, alter intercipiut.
Si quis autem MONOPOLIVM ausus fuerit exercere, bonis proprijs expoliatus, perpetuitate damnetur Exilij.
Agayn, what Reason hath any Man to go about, by raysing pryce of vittayles,) to brede opinion in some simple heds, that this Nauy, is occasion therof: And so, to cause misliking of that, by one mean: which by his former Publik Contribution, he pretendeth to be glad and desirous, that it should continually be well mainteyned? What dubble and hypocriticall dealing were that? With one hand, to offer Bread: and in the other, to hold a Stone, ready to geue a blow therwith, to the Receiuer of that bread? All such sorts, of Fraudulently or Violently caused Dearths, as, they are very much against the and Common Comfort, (to be receiued of Gods mercifull Plenty, or Sufficiency of Corn and Vittayles sent vs:) So, will they now, (as the poore Commons are in good hope) either, for very Conscience sake: Or, for good zeales sake, to the due and Reasonable maintenance, of the foresayd be vtterly abhorred, eschewed, and very well left.
And here, also, the poore Commons wold (yf they Durst) make Supplication, All, kneeling on Knees, Man, Woman, and Childe: and ioyntly, with one most humble Voyce, Request the Higher Powers, That No more Vittayles (Corn, or other,) might, vnder Licence, (or cullor therof,) be Transported to Forreyners: or otherwise, (in this Realme) by Priuilege to be vsed: Than, as may be best, to the of all them at home, and for the sufficient and more easy Mayntenance, of those Valiant worthy Publik Watchmen, lying owt at Seas.
¶And, furdermore, that in tyme of Excellent Plenty, and good cheap: the Ouerplus of Corn, and other vittayles, may be brought to the next Publik Garners and Stoarhowses, being at, or nere vnto, the foresayd Twenty Ports, to the assigned.
And there, with Publik Mony of the Pety Nauy his Threasor, to be payd for, presently:
And from those Garners, or Stoarhouses, only, to be, to places conuenient Transportable: vnder the Generall Licence, from her Maiesty, before, graunted vnto the Body of the Pety Counsaill, of chief Officers, to the appointed.
¶And wold, also, make humble Request, that the Incredible Abuses of Purueyers, and Takers of vittayles, and other things, might be more narrowly sene to, and duly reformed.
And Fifthly, the selfsame Brytish and English Commons, Man, Woman, and Childe, with wringing hands, most pitifully lamenting a Remediles Inconuenience, and haynous Absurdity, already, and to long, committed: wold, most humbly and dutifully, make Petition, that Presently, such vnparciall prouidence may be vsed: That, from hencefoorth, The Priuate Commodity of a few, shall not cause the Braynes of many a thousand, of true and faithfull English Subiects, to fly in the Ayre.
Braynes (say they) Armes, Leggs, Lymmes, and lyues of the Commons, to be (as the Case may fall out, which, God forbid,) solde after a sort: Though, not directly, and willingly: yet Indirectly vnwillingly (in respect of our Intents therin:) Seeing the Chiefest Instruments, wherewith to work so wofull a Spoyle and Calamity, are dayly (almost) from this Kingdom conueyed: (No, no, it goeth not so nycely to woork: For, open Markets and Sales, are made of them, in great plenty,) to such Copemens hands, as, No one of them, doth hartily, and will constantly, or can perpetually, wish our prosperous estate.
Nay, such, as, for many yeres, (almost continually) some of them, haue gone about, to ouerthrow, and confound, this blessed Brytish Monarchy: And some of them, such a Nation, whose Records, Chronicles, and Histories, both Ancient, and of late dayes, published, do term Their Ancient And, in dede, in hart, do ernestly desire, and constantly Hope, one day, to handle them so: What thousand crouching Salutations so euer, (with Monsieur and, Vostre Commandement, Monsieur: and the like appertenances, of glorious glosing, and depe dissimulation, their great Necessity (at any tyme) teacheth them to deuise, and counterfet.
true Lesson, this Olde Prouerb, will be found, in Such: That, which is bred in the Bone, will neuer out of the flesh.
Good God, who knoweth not, what Prouiso is made and kept, in other Against Armour carrying out of their Limits? Such, and to such Places, chiefly, from which, (possibly) they may, thereby, receiue great dammage.
And shall we, with the most terrible, forcible, and hurtfull kynde of Weapon, and Engyn, furnish both the Infidels, and the Barbarous Princes forreyn, (though, far from vs, yet to the destruction of Christians, notwithstanding.)
And also, nere at hand, such kynde of people, as, (which way so euer, the matters in controuersy, fall out, finally) will be found, an Incredible great Scourge, to this Kingdom, by vnsuspected means: as the wofull Commons, make their pitifull Reconing, already: or greatly do dout: how rude, so euer, some of these people, of them selues, be: And how simple and slender so euer, their presently sene, and known Nauy, is to be regarded.
Therfore, if the Brytish Communalty, may obteyn so much Grace at our Souerayn, and her most Honorable Priuy Counsailes hands: As, to enioy the Benefit of by means of the foresayd Then, such of Iren Ordinances, we shall greatly nede, for our own Ships furniture: And also, other Iren works, diuers wayes.
Fewell also, and Ship Tymber (from tyme to tyme) we shall haue occasion to vse, more, then els, wold be occupyed.
And then, the want of so many Hundred Peces (of Iren we mean, and not, of Bras to) as haue bin, of late, from hens transported, will make very euident, the Dubble Dammage, and Treble Danger, possibly, ensuing therof, when, our Enemies, being with our store furnished, we must be constrayned to prouide the like, new: and so, be driuen to tarry a great tyme.
And also, to take the fortune of all faults, In Iren Peces, happening.
Whereas, otherwise, at leysure, the Principall good Peeces (in all Respects) heretofore, continually culled out: And, in Rupe Tarpeia, of our New Troy, reserued, mought (without any detriment to the Prince or Commons) haue now serued our turns very well: And so, the Poore Commons should not haue, One, and the same Awle, twise thrust in their right Eyes.
As, to see, and fele agayn, the Incredible Spoyle of Woods, and Forests, as hath bin made, to furder Iren works withall: And yet, (Notwithstanding,) Iren to be now, derer, than it was, when, from beyond the Seas, we were chiefly serued therof: And our Iren also (yet) worse, then the forreyn Iren.
And our Woods, and Forests, already, so destroyed thereby, that Fewell, and Tymber, of all sorts, (of necessity) in many places of this Realm, is become, on the sudden, extremely dere: and therupon, Pryces of vittayles, somwhat the higher raysed.
Oh, the Lamentable Spoyle of our woods, sundry wayes: both, contrary to Lawes made, and also, for lack of sufficient Prouiso and due execution, as wisely and iustly performed, as either Olde Lawes made, or new, deuised, was, and may be, a sufficient Token of wisdom Speculatiue, in Lawmakers heds: But the great Rechelesnes, in the Practise (which onely, should be the great Profit to the expected) doth make vs seme great Hypocrites: in good Lawes making: and keping the Bookes, wherein, the Lawes are recorded: but not obseruing the Lawes, in our Actions Ciuile.
Peraduenture, yf (among sundry other Ordonances, for preseruation of Wood and Tymber, to be made) some Prouiso were established, by Act of Parlement, that No man should Buyld, or cause to be Buylt, but with these Three poynts, concurring: First, according to his Habilitie, and not aboue: Secondly, according to his State, or Vocation, and not aboue: Thirdly, according as his Necessary Affaires, and allowable Commodities, shall require, and not Superfluously: Therupon, fewer Banckrupts, and more would be found: Les Ambition, and more Charitie, wold be vsed: And, Thirdly, better Cheap of more Store and Choyce of and other, wold be reserued.
The Penalties of the former Transgressors, might be, after this, or, a better manner, Decreed.
Of the First, the House and Houses, so built, to be sold, by Auction: And the Tenth parte of the Whole Value, to be contributed, to the Threasory of the
And the other Nyne partes, to be payd to the Creditors: to euery Man, proportionally: so as the same will reach: And, yf there be any Ouerplus remayning, the same, to be restored to the sayd
Of the Second, the House and Houses, to be duely valued: And the Fifth Parte, of the Whole Value, to be immediatly Payable: the one half therof, to the Queenes Maiestie her Exchecquer: and the other half therof, to the Threasory of the
Third, the valuation of the Superfluous Houses, or other Buildings, (beeing duly estimated and rated:) the Twentith parte therof, to be forfetted to her Highnes Threasory, onely.
Out of which Three manner of Forfets, and Amercements, the Fifth parte of the Forfet, is to be awarded due to him, or them, who truly do geue Aduertisement of the sayd Disorder: and sufficiently doth the same, so to be, as his Aduertisement specifieth.
Now then, how can it stand with the Termes of good Policy, All these great Incommodities Publik, depending vpon our greatly disordred Iren Mynes: And yet, notwithstanding, such Warlike prouision, as, so Derely to the Commons, is wrought and made therof: For a fewe Mens priuat commodity (we know not whom) to be caryed away, far and nere: to our great disfurnishing: And to the furniture and Strengthning of Moore or Moschouite: or other Forreyn Prince: French or Fleming: our Secret Mortall Foes, or vnassured Freends? In effect: The Sorrowfull Commons, most hartily wishing the to be duly mainteyned: And most assured, that thereto, will be requisite, not onely, Stoare of such Iren Cast Peces, But also, of Tymber, Fewell, and other Iren worke: (The pryces of all which, being by the foresayd disorders, vnreasonably enhaunsed) do greatly dout, that either the foresayd things, will, (by farther disorder,) become deerer, then they now are: Or els, the Extremity of the pryces, being, then, made more sensible: the simple Multitude, or some other wrangling head, will Impute all, to this new deuised Policy, of the mainteyning.
And therfore, in this place of Consideration of Pryces and Dearth, they wold haue had such a Petition (as before) most humbly moued, to the higher States.
But no one man dare, (I know no iust cause why) vtter, in Dutifull order, the Tenor of the Premisses, to the higher powers.
Though, (disorderly) many Thousands do murmur at the matter, in marueilous manner: when, dayly, they finde so many Camps (as it were) of Iren Peeces, ready layd to the Forreyn Market: and for Forreyn Nauyes, or Forts furnishing.
Deliuering (thereby) a Rod, of our own making, into the hands of them, who could finde in their harts, to skourge vs with wyer whips, as God best knoweth: And to bring vs, into farder Inconueniences, then, either Dearth of Tymber, Fewell, Iren, or Vittayles, are to be esteemed.
But, vnto God his most Mercifull and Mighty hands, we commit our principall Protection, now and euer.
And Suerly, yf there be any Brytish, or English Pericles, now lyuing, who conueniently may, and will, both Zealously take to hart, and also Circumspectly, and depely looke into these, and like Matters: (Nothing fawning vpon Forreyners, Nor to much listening or leaning to their Aduises, or Deuises, best for them selues, and their Purposes: and not for vs, and Ours: Nor fearing Forreyn, or Homish hurt, therefore: Meaning none, him self) He wolde not make Strange, though the weaker and Imperfecter sorte of People (Which are so nooselled and embroyed vp to the elbowes, Yea, to their hart rootes, with the Insatiable loue, of To to Priuate Lucre, that, therefore, they care, To to little, for the Publik and He would not (I say) be Agast, though such wolde Diuilishly Maligne hym, and Subtily seke his Discredit, and Confusion: as (in deede) the Atheniensiens and other, did, to good Pericles and other, his like.
Yet, for all that, such Pericles wold goe forward, so long, as he might preuayle: obseruing the wise Precepts, of Perfect Politik Gouernment.
And to such, as fownd them selues greued, by any their Priuate Payne, Los, or Chardge, susteyned, by meanes of his Direction or Cownsaill, for Dutifull, and Nedefull Seruice, to be done, to and for the Militando or, or otherwise, he wold say thus: (For, so, sayd the True Pericles:) Non est mihi inexpectata Indignatio Vestra: Intellexi enim me e{que} ob caus, Vos conuocaui: vt vos admoneam, reprehendam vet mi
Patria, ebus esse Priuatis: quám Repub: Nam, Priuatus tenet Opes, tamen Euersa Patria, simul haec omnia peret
Quando igitur, Ciuitas, Priuatorum Ciuium Difficultates sustinere Potest: Nemo autem Priuatus vnus, Rempub.
Laborantem Sustentare potest: Iustum est, Versos I, opem ferro: Et non (quod vos nunc facitis) Perterritos Priuatis Iacturis, deserere REMPVBLICAM.
Omnibus autem Imperantibus accidit, vt In praesentia, in odio sint.
Praeclare autem facit, qui Inuidiam propter Res Honestas magnas perfert.
Odia autem, non sunt perpetua: Sed praesentem Splendorem, aeterna Gloria.
Ego autem affirmo, cùm duae partes Bellantibus vsui sint, TERRA, MARE: Vos, Maris Dominos esse: eius partis Cui nunc Imperatis, Reliqui Maris: SIHAC CLASSE, quam habetis, PROCEDERE VOLVERITIS.
Nec vllus Regum, nec vlla Gens, impedire vos in Mari potest.
In the ATHENIENSIEN STATE, then, yf that were True, Much more, may the BRYTISH IMPIRE Verifie that worde, absolutely, NOW.
ALBION, BRYTAN, ENGLAND, and (I say) BRYTAN, agayn: What is to be hoped, of the Races of those thy true Noble Courages: fraught with wisdom and valiantnes: whose worthy Fame (most certainly) is registred all the world ouer? God forbid, that it should truely be sayd: that Onely now, in our days, None can, None may, None dare: or None will, Carefully, and Faithfully vndertake to do so due seruice to God, so Beneficiall to this Impire, so victorious an exploit for his own Immortall Renown establishing, as, to Merite some parte of a Praeface to the Memoriall of his Triumphant Stile, such, as the Romane Pompeius Magnus did iustly deserue, in the Romane Impire.
Which, with these wordes, by Plinie is diligently recorded: and for euer (thereby) and Gratefully remembred: CVM ORAM MARITIMAM PRAEDONIBVS LIBERASSET: ET IMPERIVM MARIS, POPVLO ROMANO RESTITVISSET: Ex Asia, Ponto, Armenia, Paphlagonia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Syria, Scythis, Iudaeis, Albanis, Iberia, Insula Creta, Basternis: Et super haec, de Regibus Mithridate At{que} Tigrane, TRIVMPHAVIT.
What was the Actuall Praeface, and politik to all these Triumphes? Was it any other, than, IMPERIVM MARIS, POPVLO ROMANO RESTITVTVM? God graunt vs (therfore) the verity and of this Sea Souerainty, euery way: And that, with all Oportunity.
To Conclude then, (In this poynt Answering:) And to end my Conference, with that kinde of People, which either delight in Dearth of Gods sending: or vse (nay abuse) Dearth Fraudulently procured by other: Or, will them selues Violently force in, And Counterfet a Dearth: And all, for Priuate Lucre onely: (which is a poyson to the of this Kingdom) To those, confidently affirme: And, Euident and sure it is, that the Mayntenance of the can cause no one Grayn, or any one pound of Beof, Butter, or Chese: Or any quantity of any other vittayle, to be wanting in this Kingdom: No more, than yf no such Nauy, were to be vittayled.
And the Reason is: No more Men, are now fed at Sea, thereby,
than (yf no such Nauy were) should and wold be fedd at Land.
And the little diuersity, and Changing of the place, of the eating of it (As from Land, to Sea) ys not the Cause of any great want.
And therfore, (by Reason, afore declared,) no Iust cause of any Dearth, thereby growing.
Secondly, the Vittayles are so Proportionally, and discretely from all
Quarters and Partes of this Kingdom prouided: and so orderly serued in, as no one Corner therof, is, thereby molested, or left destitute of Corn or vittayle: otherwise, than by their own Iudgements, may very well, in that place (to so good vse) be forborne.
Thirdly, True and speedy Publik Payment also, will help to pleasure
many Farmars, and other: and be a means, of better cheape buying, commonly.
But, olde Custome, yll vsed, of Debentur Bylls their ouerlong delayed discharge, shall (here) vtterly be abolished.
Fourthly, the of (by Princely Priviledge) duly prouided, and discretely saued, and ordered, in our Publik and Garners, of the may in tyme of True Dearth not onely be a to this Realm, for the Charge of maintayning so many Thousand English or Brytish Subjects as appertayn to the But also (by very good reason) may be deemed, and politikly made to be seruisable, for the relief, of many an Hundred of the poore at home: And that, for pryces, tolerable.
mean, the sayd to be peculiarly seruisable euery one of them, to such places as do most commodiously, or next vnto them, to the
From some of which places, before (Ordinarily, and in the tyme of Plenty) parte of the Publik Prouision, was gathered into the sayd Garn, or
Which manner of pleasuring the Commons, is very Charitable Iustice.
Fifthly, by the Continuall of this (duly vsed) we shall,
Either, at Sea, be a Terror or Bar, to such, as els (abhominably) wold conuey out of this Kingdom, the Publik of diners sortes of Vittayles.
So that, they will not (hensforward) lightly attempt that their wicked desire: And thereby, the Commons may the longer tyme (within the Realm) enioy the frute of Publik Plenty, lately florishing:
Or, if any (notwithstanding the vigilant Garde and of our in euery Coast of this Realm) will so diuelishly aduenturous, as most detestably to disfurnish this Land of the Vittayles: euen then, most nedefull (and alwayes by God Nature, and Humayn Industry, appropriat, to this Kingdom) Vndoutedly, we shall very easily intercept, and at Sea, season vpon the conueyed Corn, Butter, Chese, Bacon, Barells or Hogeds of Beof in Powlder, &c. of such wilfull Offenders: being, (by Mans Law, and all good Conscience,) forfetted and lost, from the late lewd Owners thereof.
And then, the sayd Prouision, so may at the pleasure and order of the Queene her most excellent Maiesty, and her honorable Priuy Counsaill, be distributed by reasonable sale, into that parte, or partes of this Realm, which is known (at that instant) to be most destitute.
And where, also, the Publik Garners, and appropriated of the can not conueniently (or, of all the Twenty, the least conueniently) any longer, supply the want, of their peculyarly assigned Territories.
Moreouer, this forfetted Prouision, by some of the smaller Barkes, of the may very speedily, and with small extraordinary Charges, be carryed, landed, either in the very place, where (then) the Dearth pincheth the Commons, most: or, in any place: from whence, very commodiously, by farder Landish or Inlandish Carriage of it, the Sea side, Or, from any Hauen or Creke,) it may be brought: (yea, if nede be), into the very Hart, and Myddle of this
And here, it is to be Considered, also: that the Mony, arising of the foresayd Charitable Sale, of the forfet, will, the one half thereof, become due to the Threasory of our Soueraign: And the other half, to the Cofers of the which is (in effect) the Threasory of the Commons, and
And thus, the Priuate disorder of some one, or a few naughty persons, is so prudently corrected, that, (besides the deserued Penalty, layd vpon the Offenders Backs: and the Publik Terror, thereby procured to the like mynded Misers,) both the Vittailes them selues, do relieue and pleasure many Hundreds of honest and faithfull Subiects: And the Mony therof, also, is no les profitable to the encreasing of the Threasories, aswell of our most Gracious Queene, as also, of the
And, Seeing that the accustomed Goodnes, (yea the most mercifull and Bountifull aeternall prouidence) of our heauenly Father, is such, appropriated vnto this Ile of Albion that, by the Fertility of the Soyle, and due Industry of Man, employed thereto, it is very plentifully and holesomly hable (one yere, with an other, and most commonly) to Vittayle Two tymes so many more, as the Naturall Subiects of this Land are, in multitude, of Men, Women and Children, (So that, the same, might, by very good Order, be reserued within this Kingdom.)
Who is there then, of any sound reason, or experience, that can dout, that the Necessary Vittayling of the (The Men therof, being but a little Parcell, of the whole of this Kingdom,) can cause any vndue Want, or Dearth of vittayles? Seeing, also, by this Hypothesis it followeth, that within euery Three yeres, space (Ordinarily,) Stoare may be Layd vp, for Six yeres: or, at the least, for Fowr: to maintayn the whole Realm: yea, though, for two yeres together, neither Wheat, not Barly did grow at all, in the same: or, at the most, did yeld (clere) but fower graynes, for one, sowed.
And, where speake, of Corn and Grayn reseruing: mean, no longer, Store to be made thereof, then (holesomly) the same may serue.
Wherein, also, is many a foule fault committed, in this Kingdom: either by the diuelish Greedy guts, ouer long keping back their Corn from the Common Market: or by other, to negligently vsing it, (in shorter tyme) reserued.
But, when, Extraordinary plentifull yeres do come, then, may the Publik Threasory, fele the great Extraordinary Benefit therof: (as, before is told, how:) And, also, the Ordinary Store, yerely be layd vp, Notwithstanding.
And, here, you may Note: that, very seldom, any Dearth, onely of God his sending, doth continue aboue two, or three yeres, togither, continually.
Therefore, Conclude, that we of this Kingdom, might (vpon wise Order taken, and inuiolably obserued,) so enioy continuall Plenty: Or (at the least,) Sufficiency of all manner of most nedefull Vittayles: (And of Corn and grayn chiefly,) that, the price of Wheat, should not, in any Common Market, arise aboue a Mark the Quarter: Rye, x.s. and Barly, viij.s. the Quarter.
And Butter, Not aboue ij.d. the pound: and Chese, not aboue a peny the pound, &c.
And here, vse this phrase, Not aboue: For, rather, the Prices will be les.
And thereupon, you may easily Conclude, that all Laboring Men, Handicraft Men, and other, may affoord their Labors, yea, and wares, better cheape.
And so, a marueilous number of other Commodities, will therof ensue: wherof, any man of experience, or good iudgement, will sone perceiue the Dependency, or Consequency.
Vnto which peculiar great Blessing of God, our enioying, No certayner, readyer, and easier means, can be deuised, Than, by the Continuall Circuits of our Thereby, (besides many other Commodities, ensuing) either keping in, and terrifying the wretched harts of them, who, vnduly wold, (els,) proloyn Corn, and Vittailes, out of this Realm: Or catching them by the back, assone as they begin to Cros the Seas, to any forreyn Nation.
Of which point, this may suffice to aduertise them, that are faithfully willing, to follow constantly the Redres, and Reformation of the manifolde disorders, herein, continually committed, against the of this Brytish Monarchy.
And, where the Quantity of Vittayles, before hand, together, at once prouided, Maketh a Shew, of great Waste, either made, or in Danger to be made: (yf Diligent Regarde therof, be not had:) Weake hath that Man, that wold think Waste to be made, for Laying vp together, in a Fortnights space, so much, as shall not be spent, in Fowrtene Wekes.
But, yf there should so much be spent in a Fortnight, as wold duly serue the Nauy Fowrtene Wekes: Then were there Waste, indede: And so, some Want, fondly procured, more, than els is nedefull.
Or, yf, vnder Pretence of Beof Powldring, for the some Fals Iudas wold steale or proloyn Hogshed, Two, or Six, to send ouer Seas, to Forreyner: And that, for Priuate Lucre: or for a Farder, and Worser Intent, &c.
But, that, and such like sowle Disorders, will be left now, (We Hope:) or, most Narrowly be sene to: As well in Beof, as Butter, Chese, and Bacon, &c.
And, as for Seeing to, or Sauing of the Vittayles, that they be not lost: Ye nede not Dowt.
And, As for Excessiue Feeding at Sea: Who knoweth not, their Dyet to be but Reasonable, and Sufficient? With Hunger rather finishing their Meales, than with Vnweldy Carcasses: Ouercharged with Meat and As among vs, at home, many a Thowsand is? Omyt also, to speak of the great Ayde of Fresh Vittayles, which the Nauy may haue, sundry Wayes, at Seas: by Diuers kynde of good Fish, (our Men being sufficiently skilfull, now, at length, to preuent or Cure the Skyrby.)
As Pylchard, Whyting, Haddock, Playce, Sole, Cunger, Herring, Burt, Thornback, Salmon, Bream, Gurnard, Mullet, Mackerell, &c.
All, being (most commonly,) Better, then we haue them at Land, brought to vs. Which good Fish, will also, be a Means, of their spending les Flesh, at Sea: And therefore, to Nede the les, from Land.
So that, Yf all things be Duly, and Deeply Wayed: besydes a great number of other the Principall Benefits, Redownding to this Kingdom (by the foresayd it is rather thought, that the streict Dyet, (in dede, a moderat, prescribed, and vniform Dyet) of our Publik freends at Sea, in the foresayd Nauy employed, will be a means of very much Vittayles, and Flesh sauing: and to help toward plenty finding, on Land.
For (As noted Vice, or Disorder is:) Of the self same Men, some, wold at their Landish home, or in Alehouses, and Tauernes, eat and drink, more, then Mans nature, behoofully needeth: Or els, some wold be more fine, delicate, and costly in their Dyet, then wisdom and discretion wold Prescribe them &c.
So that, No dout, can here remayn, that Dearth can haue Roote, or iust occasion, to rise, or grow in this Kingdom, of this Temperate Dyet, allowed to them at Sea: who, els, ought to haue asmuch, or wold haue costlyer, and more, yf they had continued on Land.
And, while the Consideration of one great Ayd, and Means, for Flesh to become better Cheap, is in our hands: think it very needfull, to geue you to vnderstand, that by the wicked Wilfulnes only, and euident fraude, of diuers Subiects of this Realm, There is, yerely, destroyed, more than Fiue Hundred of good fresh Fish, within this our Ile of ALBION.
And though, then, not for Man, when they are so destroyed: yet, within short tyme after, they wold be.
And likewise, though, not then, likely to amount, in the whole Quantity, yerely, to so many loads: Yet, at the tyme of their being (of the Myddle sort) they wold euidently appere, so, to be rated: or rather, far aboue.
And neither, any more Charges, nor yet any greater trauaile of Man, is to be employed, for the same sorts of Fish hauing and enioying: both, when they wold be (as is sayd) And also, when the foresayd great haboundance of Vittayles, by them, might be enioyed: Than is, when, so abhominably, they are destroyed, and vtterly spoyled.
And, that this brief, and very needfull Aduertisement, may be found the more manifestly true, and duly geuen: You may vnderstand, That, in the Riuer of Thames only (as my Instructor, by Worshipfull Ientlemen, and other Men of experience, heretofore hath tryed out) most commonly, euery yere, by the Fishermen belonging to some one small Town (or within a little Circuit about it,) there is destroyed, aboue a Thousand Busshels, of the yong Fry, of diuers kindes of good Fish: which, in due tyme of their growth, and by lawfull order, being taken, wold haue byn to satisfie Two Hundred Thousand Men, one day: Or, Twenty Thousand Men, ten dayes: or, Two Thousand Men, an Hundred dayes, or, Fowr Thousand Men Fifty, dayes. &c.
Which Account, dependeth vpon the Rating of euery kynde of Myddle Fish, to be (one with an other) of Ten tymes so much meat, as, when, they are destroyed in such Small Fry, as we mean of: And also, that a Bushell of such Fish, is hable to satisfie One day, for their sufficient Repaste and Sustenance: (the Bread and drinke, requisite thereto, being excepted.)
What is, then, (I pray you) to be rekened, of the Publik Dammage, of
Cart loads, of Fish, (yerely) thus destroyed? How may it (reasonably) any longer, remayn vnreformed? Which Cartload, (according to the former Rate of Myddle Fish,) do amount and ryse, of only Bushels of Fry, yerely destroyed.
But, yf you suppose to be only and that euery one of the sayd Nets, euery day, only for dayes, in euery whole yere, destroy, but one Bushell of very small Fry: The Somme therof, doth amount to Nyne Thousand Bushels of Fry, so destroyed, yerely.
Which Fry, when it should be Myddle wold be, (one with an other) of Ten tymes more Meat and Fish, than, when, it is so destroyed.
Therefore, the of the on the Thames, may, very probably, be accused, conuicted, iudged, and condemned, as the most abhominable yerely Destructioners of Nynety Thousand Bushels of Fish.
And, if you abridge me, in the number of the dayes of their Labor, yerely: will, then, charge eche of their Nets, with destroying dayly, more, than a Bushell of Fry: one day, with an other, euery day of their Labor.
And know (notwithstanding,) how much, kepe me, within my Bounds, yet: How Horrible and Intollerable, so euer, this Fact, doth sound in your eares: who haue not listened to this matter, before now: nor know the Verity therof, yet.
Of this Nynety Thousand Bushels of Fish, if you will account but euery Bushels, (which make six Quarters,) to be a Cart loade: the Somme will be Cart loads, of fresh Fish: which is destroyed, yerely, by the only: And that, in the Noble Riuer of Thames, only.
Whereby, it is most euident, that my first Assertion, of Cart Loads of fresh Fish, destroyed, in the whole Realm of England, is most vndoutedly true.
So is it, now, also, Probable: that, in all England, by the manifold disorder, vsed about Fry and Spawn, destroying, there is yerely Spoyled, or Hyndred, the Broode of Two Thousand Cart Loads, of fresh Fish, of myddle skantlyn.
The Value, of the foresayd Nynety Thousand Bushels, of fresh Fish, (one with an other, being rated at fiue Shillings a Bushell) is Two and Twenty Thousand, and Fiue Hundred Pounds, of Current Mo+ny of England.
Which quantity of Fish, also, (according to our former Hypotheses) wold mainteyn, for one day, a Thousand Thousand, and Eight Hundred Thousand Men.
Or, Nyne Hundred Thousand Men, two dayes: Or, Three Hundred Thousand Men, six dayes: Or, a Hundred Thousand Men, dayes: Or, Fifty Thousand Men, dayes: Or, Thousand Men, dayes. &c.
And, yf, in the Riuer of Thames, only, do not (in your Opinion, or, in the estimation and knowlege of them, who are somwhat expert in these Cases,) seme duly charged, with this Incredible Spoyle, and Dammage Publik: will allow, vnto you and them, into this Reckening (to make vp, the full and heaped vp measure, of this abhominable Iniquity) all the Destruction of Fry, and yong Fish, which the or, do yerely make: who are fayn, euery two howrs of the Flud or Tyde, to discharge their Nets, for feare of breaking.
will geue you also, the Spoyle, which is yerely made with the Engynes, called Kyddels.
And they, are in the Thames, aboue an Hundred and Forty.
And now, you can not dout, but haue good reason, to warrant you, that the Destruction and Spoyle of Fry and yong Fish, made yerely, and that only, by the Three former vnlawfull Engynes, (occupyed in the Thames) doth amount, yerely, to the foresayd Publik los, of Bushels of Myddle good Fish: in the Totall Somme: mean, when, the same should come to be, of Myddle growth.
Though, at the tyme of their Spoyling them, they are, in Measure, but Nyne Thousand Bushels.
only, are the chiefest Cause, of the foresayd exceeding great Destruction of FRY, and yong Fish, (to the Intollerable Dammage Publik,) but
also, lye in the Riuer of Thames, to the great Annoyance, and Cumber (many tymes) of the Ships, and Boats, passing betwene London, and Grauesend (and farder:) And otherwhile, to the losse, both of Goods and Liues, of many of her Maiesties Louing, and Faythfull Subiects: What discrete Subiect, or true Member of the Brytish, or English Monarchie, is there, who, in his hart, Doth not abhorre this Haynous Enormity? and will not, with his Voyce, Hartily, Cry owt, and Say: Fy on them, Fy on them: Away with them, Away with them: Who, so abhominably, conuert Mans Meat, to the Feeding of
Bury some of their vnlawfull Spoyle of Fry, and young Fish, in the Shores of the Thames, and Otherwhere.
God, of his infinite Goodnes, sendeth vs (Yerely) Euident Tokens, of the great Habundance, of this kynde of good Vittailes, prepared purposely for this parte, of this Brytish Albion: But, these Cast Incredible Much of such a Threasor, before their Swyne, to Battle them withall: And are, (by that meanes,) great Hynderers, to the Wealth, and Reliefe Publik: and also, to the Glory of God: Who, wold be Duly Glorifyed, and Praysed of many a Thowsand of the Rich, and Poore, who, should be Serued, Pleasured, and Relieued, with the great Habundance, of the Dyuers sorts of good and wholesome Fish, Swarming in this Incomparable Riuer of Thames (from the one end therof, to the other,) in very mayn Skulls: Yf these Publik Enemies of God and, Man, did not (more than Barbarously, and les than Christianlike,) vtterly spoyle, and wickedly tred vnder their feet, such a Blessing and liberall Gift of our GOD, and most louing heauenly father, profered vnto vs, and in manner, put into our hands.
Very much, more abhominable, and more vnreasonable, is the wickednes of these than was the Disorder, heretofore (and till of late) committed in Ireland: where, the Inhabitants of diuers Cities and Towns, adioyning nere to Riuers, that do Eb and Flow (in which Riuers, the Fry of Salmon, Ele, and other Commodious Fish are bred and nourished) did kepe great heards and numbers of Swyne: which, at low water, they do, or (till of late) did lead, of suffer, to fede vpon the Strands, of the sayd Riuers: where they do, or did, destroy great Quantity of Salmon, and Ele Fry: and of diuers other good Fishes: to the great hurt, and hindrance of Fishing: and the exceeding great dammage, of the
As, by the Act, made against the same, at Dublyn, Anno vndecimo of our most Gracious Souerayn Lady, Queene Elizabeth, more at large, may appere.
And, at this present, am the bolder, to expres my Instructor his feruency, against the their haynous endammaging of the of this Kingdom: Seeing, for (abowt) an Hundred and Fifty yeres ago, the whole Body of this Realm, by their Parlement Senators, left vnto vs, worthy Record of their vigilant Eye (to finde out such Offences) and their Politik Prouiso: by very good Iustice, either to Cut of the Cause, of so greuous hindrance to the or, discreetly to punish the fact (so often, as it should be Committed) with a Hundred Shillings, to be Forfetted, to the King.
In the Second yere, of King Henry the Sixth, these are the wordes of the Statute, to our purpose, prudently established: CAP. XV. ITem, it is Ordeined, that the Standing of Nets, and Engins, called Trinks, and all other manner of Nets, which be, and were wont to be fastened, and hanged continually, day and night, by a certayn tyme, in the yere, to great Posts, Boats, and Anchors, ouerthwart the Riuer of Thames, and other Riuers of the Realm, (which Standing, is a Cause and an Occasion of as great, [and more] destruction of the Broode, and Fry of Fish, and Disturbance of the Common Passage of vessels, as be the Weares, Kyddels, or any other Engins,) be wholy defended, for EVER.
And that, euery Person, that so setteth, or fastneth them, from henceforth, to such Posts, Boats, and Anchors, or like thing, continually to Stand, (as afore is sayd,) and be duly therof, by the Cours of the Law, conuict: he shall forfait to the King.
C.S. at euery tyme, that he is so proued, in Default.
Prouided alwayes, that it shall be lawfull to the Possessors of the sayd Trinks, (if they be of Assise,) to Fish with them, in all seasonable tymes: Drawing and conueying them, by Hand: as, other Fishers, do other Netts: and not fastning, or tacking the sayd Netts, to the Posts, Boats, and Anchors: continually to Stand, as afore is sayd.
Sauing alwayes, to euery of the Kings liege People, their Right, Title, and Enheritance, in their Fishings, in the sayd Water.
But, what shall any Zealous Louer of Iustice, and good Publik Policy, say, or think, herein? Seeing, so long ago, so Iust, sufficient, and easy a Remedy, was prouided, against these
aswell, for the manifold Cumber, Danger, and Dammage, happening by them, to such, as should, and did pas (Vp or Down,) vpon the Thames, by Day: and chiefly in the Dark Nights, and Foggy Weather: As also, against the exceeding great to the Naturall and Ordinary Encrease, of very good Fish, (of diuers sorts) wilfully, and very vngodly, procured by the sayd hath byn, no better regarded? And, seeing,
Sutes in the Law, haue byn, in our dayes, commenced, and followed (by vertue of the sayd Act) against the sayd And they, therupon Condemned: And yet (that notwithstanding,) their vnlawfull Practises, still are continued? And Thirdly, Seeing, (before our Eyes,) the Dammage to the and the incredible hinderance to that plenty of Vittailes finding and enioying, which God hath prepared for vs, is, by these procured, more now, than euer before, most vnlawfully, and fraudulently: etiam, cum Calumnia quadam to the Pitifull Clemency, and the very great Lenity, vsed toward them? Therfore, Seeing, (I saye,) that Neither the foresayd very good Law, can feare them: Nor, the Amercements, (as they are vsed,) do sufficiently pinch Nor, the manifold iust Complaynts (besides Costly Sutes, made and had) against these are (yet,) of sufficient effect, to the poore Commons, to be vsed herein, according to the Lawes of this Realm: But that, they remayn remedyles, (yet,) and are euidently Spoyled (yerely) of an incredible great Publik Benefit, by these Trinkerly disordred, and vnlawfull Fishings (as before is declared:) How can I, hope, that, vpon this very brief, and simple Aduertisement, of my Instructor, These shall vtterly, and speedily, be cut of, without any longer sinister means to be vsed, by any Subiects, to beard, or, to deface so commendable and needfull a Statute, as that is, which before is expressed, against the Standing of any But, yet, for all that, such is my Confidence in the goodnes of her most excellent Maiesty: and so, assured am, her Maiesties hart, to be fraught with pitifull Compassion, on the Lamentable, and due Complaynts, made, of the great and excessiue hynderance, and dammage to her Commons and Subiects wealth and relief: And, likewise, so well, are we acquainted with the most commendable Iustice, executed by her Maiesties most Honorable Priuy Counsaile, when duly and throughly they vnderstand the Causes: That, (with calling these things, to my Remembrance) not only, now, my Hope is reuiued: but, also, dare half warrant the Commons, That henceforward, shall be vnpartially constrayned, to vse their Trade of Fishing only, according to the Law: and, Not, as they (most vnlawfully and very vngodly,) to long a tyme haue done, and very abhominably at this present, they do: Yerely destroying far more Fish, than they send, good, seasonable, lawfull, and allowable, to the Markets.
For, the more parte of those, which they send, are Vnseasonable or Vnlawfull Smelts, or Wherin, the only, might sufficiently well, (or, with much les serue: as the wise and expert, are well assured of it.
Of the diuers, yea the manifold other abuses, of Fishing: or hyndrances to the same, in this noble Riuer of Thames, only: to disclose, rehears, and expres the matter, and manner, particularly, fully, and vnpartially, it doth require a peculiar, and great Treatise.
But, to Conclude this necessary Digression, withall: may, aptly enough (and omitting many other,) Note only two manners of Hyndrances: Which, (easily, and most quickly) may be redressed: The one, is, of long tyme vsed, and (I know not, why,) permitted: and yet (notwithstanding) is a great Hindrance and cause of Destruction, to the Western store of diuers kyndes of good Fishes.
And that is, the Fishing with any manner of Net, in the places, which either for a Season, or in the other, which are continually exempted from being Fished in, (commonly called Seueralls, and Rough places.)
In which places, what vnlawfull, or vndue Subtlery is vsed, to auoyd the Roughs, and Stakes, for feare of hurting, or renting of their Nets, (and yet, to beat, and punch the Beds, or Skulls of Fish: and by [in manner] thundring thumping, and pashing, or, with Chayn drawing vnder the water, &c: to driue the Fish, to their Nets) may easily be vnderstood, and dayly sene, or nightly hard, and perceiued.
But, with all men, of sufficient Iudgement (in many Respects,) it may be condemned, as a great hyndrance to the Broode and Store preseruing: and a violent breaking, of the first Intent of the Politik Ciuill Senators: who, made the Ordonances, for such Places Seueralling, or vtterly Exempting, and reseruing vnransakt, and vndisturbed.
And though will make great shew of good Argument, to the Contrary: yet, it is best, to make sure woork: in Circumspectly establishing the Priuilege, and exemption of those peculiarly assigned, and well known places, of Store and Broode: from any manner of Net casting in the same, or any artificiall disturbance, purposely, therin to be vsed, for any Fish taking.
The Second Hyndrance, is the Stinching, Soyling, (or, rather Beslouening,) of the Thames: Both Shores, and Channels: Where, the yerely Recours, and far more Plentifull Haunt, than now is, of the Western Smelt, (which is the Seasonable, and best Smelt) was wont to be.
And this new, and to bold Attempt, hath, but of very late yeres, excessiuely, bin enterprised: Not only, (as sayd,) to the great Hyndrance of the best, and most Seasonable Smelt, his annuall Delight, as in times past (and till, of very late) to Return, and abyde in great Plenty, for the space of the whole Season, in the Ancient Place of the chief Western Smelt Fishing: But, also, to the causing of many lothsome Sights, horrible Sauours, and infectuous euaporations, of such Dunghill stuf: to no little grief of Sent, and no les danger to the health of very many, of Court, Cuntry, and City: which, either do frequent, or (now and then) pas vpon the same Riuer of Thames, betwene the City of London, and Richemond: where (most vsually) our Soueraygn, euery yere, doth make some abode.
Betwene which two places, as our Soueraigns, (Kings and Queenes) haue very often, and (almost) yerely, heretofore, passed by water: So, durst no man, in those dayes, so carelesly, and vnlawfully annoy, and bestinche the Thames: either, Banks or Shores, (in that Tract of the Riuer, chiefly: being, also, the fayrest and pleasantest passage, of the whole Riuer:) both, in respect of not offending, either the Eye, or Smell, of the Maiesty Royall: and also, for feare of breaking Ordonances, generally prouided, and very duly appliable to the same Case.
And how, either already, it hath offended, or may here after, offend the Eye and Nose, and be dan+gerous to the health, aswell of the right Honourable, Priuy Counsailers to our Soueraygn, or, of other of the Nobility: or, of the Ladyes and Ientlewemen of the Court: As of very many other also, of all Degrees: any man may easily iudge, that either hath those his two Senses
in respect of Cleanlynes and whol+somnes in Publik and Princely Passages: or who hath due and expert perceiuerance,
that, both it is Vnlawfull, and also Needles, in Such Maner to be done, as it is.
And some, haue of late, so much encroached vpon the Patience of the Commons (in this vndecent and vnlawfull filthy Attempt:) yea, so far, as, not
only, by Scattrings, they haue annoyed the Channels, and Publik Shoares, with the sayd Dung: and (in some places, nere the vsuall Landing of the right honorable Priuy Counsaile, and Embassadors: and of other her Maiesties Subiects, of all sorts) with the Recours of the Carts to the Dung boats sides, haue made such Publik Shores, and Stronds, as before, were very clean, hard, and grauelly, to become (thereby) very myry, and depe to the knees: and vyly stinking, at the Eb, when the Sunne hath had any power thereon: And chiefly, if the wynde do cary the Noysome Sauour therof, toward any man: But
also haue made two kynde of or the one immediatly to receiue from Boat the foresayd Filth: And the other, not far of: and nere, or in the High and Publik wayes: or in the Lords waste adioyning.
Both which kyndes of new deuised Dung hills, if heretofore, any Law or Policy did permit, or rather, not sufficiently preuent: yet (notwithstanding that slight permission, or want of Prouiso better Consideration, aduise, and examining of the matter, will or may finde good Remedy for the noysome Disorder: and establish some sufficient Order: aswell, for apt places assigning, or admitting, for certayn Leystooss making: as also, for a very short tyme limiting for such stuf, lying or continuing there, to the great Annoyance, and possible Infection, not onely and chiefly of the nere Inhabitants, but of them also, which do and shall pas thereby: of what Dignity, Degree, or State so euer, they (he or she) are: English, or Forreiner.
And, though the therabout, do greatly allow such kynde of helping their poore and hungry erable groundes: more, now, than in tymes past: yet, this Notable dangerous, and needles annoying of so many.
Thousands, of the Queenes Maiesties louing Subiects: (and that for a very few fansies) hath not holpen them, to be hable, or (at the least) admonished them, to be the more willing, to sell their Corn any better cheap, either at Market, or at Home, to their poore Neighbours, or, to other.
And yet (forsothe) for their onely Priuate wealth amending, they dare be so bold, or are become so careles, to annoy, and vnlawfully to vex, with lothesome Sights, and vnwholsome Sauours, so many, and so much, as they do.
Farder will not (as now) say, in this vnpleasant matter: though could.
But, in this point, (as in many other,) the poore Commons, and quiet Subiects of her Maiestie, do Hope, that some Redres, will speedily ensue.
So, that Priuate Gayn, Delight, or wilfulnes, shall not so much either rechlesly, craftily, or violently, deuoure, or bar the or, be so Noysom, and greeuous, to the poore Commons: Whose Health and welfare, ought, in all good to be carefully procured, and constantly maynteined: as much, as any Humayn, or their best Policy, can aduaunce, and preserue the same.
The Third and last Dowt, is of the Due, True, and Iust, Bestowing, of such a Masse of Threasor, which yerely will be, Ordinarily, Contributed: and odly, otherwise, now and then: as by Gift while men are lyuing: Or, by Legacy, after their Decease: and sundry otherwayes.
The meaning hereof, is this: That the Threasor Contributed, may sundry wayes be abused.
As, Partly, through the corrupt Nature, and very falshood of such, as should in Office haue the fingring of yt: Being not contented with their sufficient Salary, and Due Allowance.
Or, by Vndiscrete bestowing some parte thereof: by wasting it to other purposes, or vses, than it is meant, intended, and contributed for: one tyme or other.
Or (perhaps) the Poore Commons, and Body of the Realm, may (to Scrupulously) settle in their Fansyes, Speciall Dowt herein, which they dare not expressely Declare: As might be, To consider many things, which haue bene, in tymes past, Liberally geuen to vses Publik, and to Gods great Honor: (As, in those Dayes, Christian Religion, was rated.)
And the same Gifts, then, most circumspectly also, by the best Aduise of Lawyers, (in Tenor of woords) ordred: And with many other Circumstances, confirmed: Yet, Notwithstanding all that Assurance, And the Force of Legacy Law: Many a Thousand Pounds Rent, of such Free Gifts, haue byn in our Dayes, by Act of Parlement, turned from the first appoynted Vses: And Therefore, herein also, mought the lyke Alteration be Dowted.
¶Easily, and Probably, their Fantazies might, in this their Dowt, be satisfied.
For, there, either withowt Aduise and Consent of the whole State: Or, of a Simple Intent,
but Vaynly, (in Respect of the Means, to obtayn that their Intent,) such Gifts were First geuen: But, in this our Gift, and Publik Oblation, the whole Realm is priuy: the whole Realm consenting: the whole Realm, ayding: And the whole Realm, certainly feeling the Publik Commodity of Peace, Wealth, and of Blessed Security, thereby, enioyed.
And, Seeing the Case so standeth, who can Dout, that euer hereafter, in any Parlement, all the Parlement Senators, or the more parte, will be so much corrupted in their Iudgements: as, either to mislike the Continuall Garde of this Monarchy, by the foresayd or, to Sollicite it to be layd aside, in parte, or in all: And wold (notwithstanding) haue the Commons, the Realm, vrged to the Contynuance of the foresayd Perpetuall Beneuolence: for Sea Security onely, meant, and giuen? ¶Secondly, to Preuent the likelyhood or possibility of such dangerous
Innouations: No les Wisdom and Prudency, may herein be vsed, than was in Athenes vpon Occasion, not vtterly vnlike to this: But, ours, for manifold Purposes, to vs, more Commodious, than theirs, could be to them.
The Peloponnesians being returned homeward from Attica, Thucidides Lib. recordeth some of the Atheniensiens new Ordonances ensuing: Saying: Post quorum discessum, Athenienses Praesidia excubias disposuerunt, in Terra, in Mari, sicut volebant per totum Belli tempus seruari.
Et decreuerunt Mille Talenta de Pecunia in Arce posita, reliqua summa segregata, separatim reponenda esse, ne{que} insumenda: sed de Reliqua Pecunia, in Bello sumptus faciendos.
Si quis suaderet, vel decerneret, vt ea Pecunia moueretur, aut in alios vsus expenderetur, quàm cùm Hostes Atticam Classe Nauali Exercitu peterent, reprimendi essent, Illi Suasori, Poenam statuebant SVPPLICIVM CAPITIS.
Et centum Triremes praecipuas at{que} instructissimas, quotannis, reliqua Classe seiunxerant, adiunctis singularum Praefectis: Quibus, vnà cum Pecunia illa, ad nullam rem vti fas erat, praterquam, cùm Ciuitas, illa extrema necessitate Periculo premeretur.
The like Prouiso hath byn in sundry other Realms, established: And in this Kingdom also, ordeyned: And, in this Case, full well, and necessarily, may be.
¶And, here also, such other Circumspect Considerations of Prouiso will vndoutedly be had, against all fals and negligent Officers, in any Seruice Publik, (to the vse and behoof, of the foresayd appointed:) That, so sone, as, any of them, shall be sufficiently conuicted of falshood, in their Office, vsed: Rigorous and sharp Iudgement (according to the greatnes of the fault,) shall pas against them: and they vtterly be dishabled for euer, From all Publik function of Office, within the Realm of England, and Ireland: vpon a Band of Recognisance, taken of their hands, to that Intent.
And the matter, Proces and Conclusion, fully to be Recorded, in two books: with the Offenders Name, subscribed with his own hand: (As, sundry other things, els, are, for Safety, and Readynes, to be twise, or oftner Registred.)
And if any Officer shall, twise, or thrise, be found a Trespaser, by his own Negligence, or of any vnder him: in any matter of Importance, touching his Office: After due Amends shall by him, or his Suerties, be made, to the Publik Threasory: That Negligent Officer, shall be put out of his Office, immediatly.
And, after this, or some better Rate, all and Offences of Falshood, and Negligences, and such like, in euery kinde of Officers (to the belonging,) shall diligently (by apt Surueyors) be sene to, and quikly espyed: narrowly sifted, and duly corrected.
So that (vndoutedly) such Iustice, being vnpartially, and speedily vsed, shall make, that, ere long, all these Officers, from the lowest to the Highest, shall be tryed, approued, graue, honest, discrete, and circumspect Men: who will deale so iustly, carefully, and diligently, as their Othes receiued, shall bynde them: And their sufficient Suerties, shall be answearable for: And, as, the whole Commons will hartily request them, for to do: and will, most faithfully promise vnto them, and gladly performe (vpon their good seruice, and due desert) such extraordinary Rewards, and so great, as may encourage any Christen Man, to deale truly, and iustly, in so waighty Affaires Publik: And may also reioyce any godly mans hart els, to see excellent Vertue, receiue such Publik Honor, Credit, and Gwerdon.
¶To Conclude: who Douteth, but that our King and God, of his Infinite mercy may graunt vs, euen at our first discrete and circumspect Choys, and assigning, to finde all sorts of those Officers, so wise, faithfull, Iust, Carefull, and Diligent: as, it may be accounted his very handywork, and great Blessing, herein? Whose Mercifull Prouidence, at no tyme, is wanting in matters Cosmopoliticall, of great importance: and which, also, incomparably surpasseth all Humayn Policie: though the same be most carefully vsed, for matters tending greatly and chiefly to his Glorie, and Honor: as, vndoutedly, this doth.
And so, are the Three former Douts, briefly, and sufficiently (as this place may admit.)
Therfore, Seeing No Dout, or Obiection, (worthy of Consideration, or, of any Importance,) is remayning, to the Contrary of that most zealous WISH or rather, SVPPLICATION which (certainly) is agreable to the Harty Desire, of the most parte of all Naturall, and Faithfull Subiects of this Kingdom, at this very Present: (vpon our own State, both, in it self, chiefly, and absolutely: And also, in Respect, of our Forrein Neighbors, their vnassured Frendship, being Considered): Why should not we HOPE that,
BRYTANICA on her knees, very Humbly, and ernestly Soliciting the most Excellent Royall Maiesty, of our ELIZABETH, (Sitting at the HELM of this Imperiall Monarchy: or, rather, at the Helm of the IMPERIALL SHIP of the most parte of Christendome: if so, it be her Graces Pleasure) shall obteyn, (or Perfect Policie, may perswade her Highnes,) that, which is the Pyth, or Intent of
BRYTANICA Her Supplication? Which is, That, may helpe vs, not onely, to POYPION
But make vs, also, Partakers of Publik Commodities Innumerable, and (as yet) Incredible.
Vnto which, the HEAVENLY KING for these many yeres last past, hath, by MANIFEST OCCASION most Graciously, not only inuited vs: but also, hath made, EVEN NOW the Way and Means, most euident, easie, and Compendious: as, (besides all our own sufficient Furniture, Hability, Industry, Skill, and Courage) our Freends are become strong: and our Enemies, sufficiently weake, and nothing Royally furnished, or of Hability, for Open Violence Vsing: Though their accustomed Confidence, in Treason, Trechery, and Disloyall Dealings, be very great.
Wherin, we beseche our HEAVENLY PROTECTOR with his GOOD ANGELL to Garde vs, with SHIELD AND SWORD now, and euer.
TRuly, can not here let pas, an other Little Discourse, (as there are Diuerse,) of his, much to this Intent.
am not vtterly Ignorant, (Sayd he,) of the Humors, and Inclinations, of the People of this ALBION being (now) the greater Portion, of the BRYTISH IMPIRE
For, although, as well through so many Conquests, as also, great Resortings hither, of sundry other Nations, there hath byn made a Maruellous Mixture of People, of Repugnant Conditions: Yet, from Yere to Yere, the Generall Disposition, of the present Inhabitants, doth, much alike, Alter to this great Imperfection: That is: Though otherwhiles, they know and Taste of the Best: yet, seldome tyme, they do Constantly follow, and continue in the same: mean now, in Publik Behauiour, Et officijs Ciuilibus: For that, their Ciuile Conuersation, and Industry, in many poynts, is nothing so answerable to the Dignity of Man, As the very Heathens did prescribe Rules for the Gouernment therof.
Let CICERO his Golden Book, DE OFFICIIS be the Euidence against them, to the Contrary: And that, in those Poynts, by the Heathen Orator expressed, which both greatly are agreable to the most Sacred Diuine Oracles, of our IEOVA: and also, for the right Excellent.
haue oftentymes, (Sayd He,) and many wayes, looked into the State of Earthly Kingdoms, Generally, the whole World ouer: (as far, as it may, yet, be known to Christen Me, Commonly:) being a Study, of no great Difficulty: But, rather, a purpose, somewhat answerable, to a perfect Cosmographer: to fynde hym self, Cosmopolites: Citizen, and Member, of the whole and only one Mysticall City Vniuersall: And so, consequently, to meditate of the Cosmopoliticall Gouernment therof, vnder the King Almighty: passing on, very swiftly, toward the most Dreadfull, and most Cumfortable Term prefixed: And finde (sayd he) that if this Brytish Monarchy, wold heretofore, haue followed the Aduantages, which they haue had, onward, They mought, very well, ere this, haue surpassed (By Iustice and Godly, sort) any particular Monarchy, els, that euer was on Earth, since Mans Creation.
And that, to all such purposes, as to God are most acceptable: And to all perfect most Honorable, Profitable, and Comfortable.
But, yet, (sayd he) there is a Little lock of LADY OCCASION, Flickring in the Ayre, by our hands, to catch hold on: wherby, we may, yet ones more (before, all, be vtterly past, and for euer) discretely, and valiantly recouer, and enioy, if not all our Ancient and due Appertenances, to this Imperiall Brytish Monarchy, Yet, at the least, some such Notable Portion therof, As, (all Circumstances, duly and Iustly appertayning to Peace and Amity, with Forreyn Princes, being offred and vsed) this, may become the most Peaceable, most Rich, most Puissant, and most Florishing Monarchy of all els (this day) in Christendome.
Peaceable (I say) euen with the most parte of the self same Respects, that good King Edgar had, (being, but a Saxon:) And by sundry such means, as, he chiefly, in this Impire did put in proof and vre, Triumphantly.
yeres past) the Representation of a great parte of the self same Idea which (from aboue onely, and by no Mans aduise,) hath gratiously streamed down into my Imagination: being (as it becommeth me, a Subiect) Carefull for the Godly Prosperity of this Brytish Impire, vnder our most Peaceable Queene Elizabeth.
For, EADGARVS PACIFICVS, Regni sui prospiciens Vtilitati, pariter Quieti, Quatuor Millia Octingentas sibi Robustas congregauit Naues: quibus, Mille Ducentas, in Plaga Angliae Orientali: Mille Ducentas, in Occidentali: Mille Ducentas, in Australi: Mille Ducentas in Septentrionali Pelago Constituit: Vt ad Defensionem Regni sui, contra Exteras Nationes, bellorum Discrimina sustinerent: wisdom Imperiall: most diligently, to be Imitated.
Videlicet, PROSPICERE: to Foresee: Charitable Kingly Parent, that was touched with Ardent Zeale, for Procuring the of his Kingdom: Yea and also, the Peaceable enioying therof.
O, of an Incredible Masse of Threasor, a Kingly Portion, yet, in his Cosers, remayning: Yf, then, he had, (or late before,) any warres: Seeing no Notable Tax, or Contribution Publik, is (Historically) mentioned, to haue byn, for the Charges hereof, leuyed.
marueilous Politicall and Princely Prudency, in tyme of Peace, to Foresee and preuent, (and that, most Puissantly and Inuincibly) all possible malice, fraude, force, and mischief Forreyn.
most discrete Liberality, to such excellent good vses, powring out his Threasor, so abundantly.
faithfull English People (Then) and Worthy Subiects, of such an Imperiall and Godly Gouernour.
your True and willing Harts, and blessed ready hands (Then.)
So, to Impart such Abundance of Vittayles, for those Huge Nauies mayntenance.
So, (I say) as, neither Dearth or Famine, seemed (fondly) to be feared of you, for any intollerable want, likely to ensue, thereby.
Nor, prices of Vittayles, complayned of, to be vnreasonably enhansed, by you: finding, for their great Sales, so good and rare Oportunity.
This Peaceable KING EDGAR, was one of the perfect Imperiall Monarchs of this Brytish Impire: and therfore, thus, his Fame remayneth (for euer) Recorded: ANGLICI ORBIS BASILEVS, FLOS, ET DECVS AEDGARVS, non minus Memorabilis Anglis quàm Cyrus Persis: Romulus Romanis: Alexander Macedonibus: Arsaces Parthis: Carolus Francis: Anno vitae
Glastonbury, Glastonbury: the Threasory of the Carcasses of so famous, and so many rare Persons, Quae olim MATER SANCTORVM dictaes: &, ab alijs, TVMVLVS SANCTORVM: quam, ab ipsis DISCIPVLIS DOMINI, aedificam fuisse, Venerabilis habet Antiquorum Authoritas.)
How Lamentable, is thy case, now? How hath Hypocrisie and Pride, wrought thy Desolation? Though omit (here) the names of very many other, both excellent holy Men, and Mighty Princes (whose Carcasses are committed to thy Custody), yet, that like Ioseph, That Triumphant BRYTISH ARTHVR And now, this Peaceable, and Prouident Saxon, King Edgar, do force me, with a certayn sorrowfull Reuerence, here, to Celebrate thy Memory.
This Peaceable King Edgar, (as by Ancient Records may appere:) His Sommer Progresses, and Yerely chief pastymes, were, The Sayling rownd about this Whole Ile of Albion: Garded with hys Grand Nauy of Sayle, at the least: parted into Equall Partes, of Pety Nauies: eche, being of a Thowsand Ships.
Idem quo{que} AEDGARVS, NAVES CONGREGAVIT: ex quibus, omni Anno, post festum Paschale Naues ad quamlibet Angliae partem Statuit: Sic, AEstate Insulam Circumnauigauit.
Et haec omnia, ad sui Exercitium, ad Hostium fecit Terrorem.
Could, and would that Peaceable, and wise King Edgar, before nede (as being in Peace, and Quiet, with all Nations, about hym) And Notwithstanding, mistrusting his possible Enemies, make his Pastymes, so Royally, Politically, and Triumphantly: with so many Thowsand Ships: And at the least, with ten tymes so many Men, as Ships: And that, yerely? And shall we, being not assured of such Neighbours as may become, to vs, as Cruell and Tyrannicall Enemyes, as neuer King Edgar neded to Dread any the like: And they, as many, and Mighty Princes, as neuer King Edgar coped with the like? Shall we (sayd he,) not Iudge it, some parte of Wisdome, to Imitate carefully, in some little Proportion, (though not with so many Thousands,) the prosperous Pastimes of Peaceable King Edgar, that Saxonicall Alexander? Yea, Prosperous pastimes, those may be iustly cownted, by which, he also made euident to the whole world, that, As he wisely knew the Ancient Bownds, and Limits, of this Brytish Impire: So, that he could, and wold, Royally, Iustly, and Triumphantly Enioy the same: Spite of the Diuell, and Maugre the Force of any Forreyn Potentate: And, all that, so Highly, and Faithfully, to the glory of God, finally, intended, and brought to pas: As the Wisest, and Godlyest Prelats, and Cownsailors of those Dayes, (so cownted of, and recorded,) could best aduise or direct him: Or (Perchance,) but sincerely Commend, and Dutifully encourage him, in: He being, of himself, so bent: As, purposing, first, Inuincibly to Fortify the Chiefest and Vttermost Walls of his Ilandish Monarchy, against all Forreyn Encombrance possible: And in that Fortification Furdering, and Assuring, to trust best his own Ouersight, and Iudgement: in yerely vewing the same, in euery Quarter therof: And that, (as it were) for his Pastime Imperiall, also, in the Sommer Tyme: to the ende, that afterward, In all Securitie, he might, in Winter tyme VACARE :) be at conuenient Leysure, On Land: chiefly, to set furth Gods Due Honor: And Secondly, to Vnderstand, and Diligently to Listen to the Causes and Complaynts, of his Commons.
For, (As Mathaeus Westmonastariensis of him, to his Immortall Commendation, hath left vs a Remembrance:) Habebat autem praetereà Consuetudinem, per omnes Regni Prouincias transire: Vt intelligeret, quomodo Legum Iura, suorum Statuta Decretorum, Principibus obseruarentur: Et, ne Pauperes Potentibus praeiudicium passi, inuestigare Solebat.
Thus, we see, how, in Opportunity, this Peaceable Edgar, procured, to this Impire, such prosperous Security: That his true and faithfull Subiects, all manner of wayes, (that is, at home, and also at Sea, both outward and inward,) mought peaceably, Safely, and Securely, employ their wits and trauayles, for the marueilous enritching of this Kingdom, and pleasuring very many other: Carrying forth, the Naturall Commodities of this Land, abounding here, aboue our necessary vses: (and due Store reserued): And likewise (agayn), Furnishing the same, with all necessary (and not superfluous) Forreyn Commodities: fet from far, or Forreyn Cuntryes.
This, was, in dede (as before is Recorded) a Kingly Prouidence: Reipub.
Besides which great Vtility and Profit publik, foresene: and by this means, enioyed: he him self, vsed most gladly the Aduantage of that Security, in ministring of Iustice: Or causing the same to be executed, all his Kingdom ouer: Not frowningly, or skornfully shunning the ragged and tattered sleue of any Suppliant, holding vp to him a simple soyled Bill of Complaynt, or Petition, and that, homely contriued: Or, afrayd at, and Timerously hasting from, the sickly Pale face, or feeble Lymmed Suter, extremely constrayned, so, to speak for him self: Nor, partially smoothering his own Conscience, to sauor, or mayntein the fowle fault, and trespas vnlawfull, of any his Subiects: How Mighty, or Necessary so euer, they (els) were: But, diligently made Search, least, Pauperes, passi,
loue, of his own Subiects, garding him, at home: And the
Heauenly Spirite, directing all his godly Purposes: Cause Iustice and Equity, in all Quarters of this ALBION to florish.
For which, his Peaceable and prosperous Benefits, at the Eternall King his obtayned: he became, not Insolent, or declyned to Tyrannicl Regiment (as some Princes, in other Cuntries haue made their lyues, cotragicall But with all his foresayd Inuincible Sea Strength, aboundant Wealth, Triumphant Peace: with Security, and ouer all his Monarchy preuayling: his hart, was continually, and most bent, to set forth the Glory, Laude, and Honor of the Almighty Creator, the Heauenly and euerlasting King: By such principall and Princely means, as, (then,) were demed, to God, most acceptable: And such, as many Monuments, yet, to our dayes, remayning, do of him vndoutedly Testify: As this, for one: ALTITONANTIS Dei Clementia, qui est Rex Regum, Ego AEDGARVS Anglorum omnium{que} Insularum, OCEANIQVE BRITANNIANI Cunctarum{que} Nationum quae infra eam includuntur IMPERATOR Demus, gratias ago ipsi Deo Omnipotenti, Regi qui meum IMPERIVM sic ampliauit exaltauit super Regnum Patrum Qui, Monarchiam Angliae sint, tempore ATHELSTANI, (qui primus Regnum Anglorum, omnes Nationes quae Britanniam incolunt, sibi Armis subegit,) Nullus tamen eorum, vlira eius Fines, Imperium suum dilatare aggressus est.
Mihi autem concessit Propitia Diuinitas, cum Anglorum IMPERIO, Insularum OCEANI, cum suis Regibus, vs{que} NORVEGIAM: maximam{que} Partem Hiberniae, cum sua Ciuitate Dublinia, Anglorum Regno subiugare.
Quos etiam omnes, meis Imperijs colla subdere (Dei fauente gratia) coegi.
Quapropter, Ego, CHRISTI Gloriam Laudem exaltare, eius Seruitium amplificare deuotus, disposui: per meos Fautores, Dunstanum videlicet Archiepiscopum, AEthelwoldum Oswaldum Episcopos, (quos mihi Patres Spirituales, Consiliatores elegi) magna ex parte, secundum quod disposui, effeci. &c.
A. Omnipotentis Dei &c. Ipsius Nutu gratia suffultus, Ego AEDGARVS, Basileus Dilectae Insulae ALBIONIS, subditis nobis sceptris Scottorum, Cumbrorum, ac Brytonum, omnium circumcirca quteta Pace perfruens: studiosus sollicitè de laudibus Creatoris omnium occupor addendis: Ne nunc Inertia, nostris{que} diebus (plus aequo) seruitus eius tepescere videatur. &c. Octauo decimo mei Terrent IMPERII Anno &c. Anno Incarnationis Dominicae.
Ego AEDGARVS, totius ALBIONIS Basilcus, hoc Priuilegium (tanta roboratum Authoritate) Crucis Thaumate Confirmaui. &c.
So that, by all these Rehearsed Records, it is most euident, that the Peaceable King Edgar, was one of those Monarchs, in whose hands (if life had sufficed,) the Incredible Value and Priuilege, graunted by God and Nature, vnto this Brytish Monarchy, might haue byn peaceably purchased: In such sort, as the very Blessing and fauour of the Diuine Trinity, hath layd means, for our Industry to Attayn to, and enioye the same, by.
And though sundry other valiant Princes, and Kings of this Land, could recite, which, in tymes past, haue either by Intent gone about: or, by wise and valyant exployt, haue meetly well prospered, toward this Ilandish appropriat Supremacy atteyning: Yet, Neuer, any other reasonable Means was vsed, or by Humayn wyt, and Industry, can be contriued, to all purposes Sufficient, But onely, by our preuayling: And so, by our Inuincib enioying All, within the of our Brytish Royallty, Conteyned.
To which Incredible Politicall Mystery atteyning, No easyer, readyer, or perfecter Plat and Introduction, is (as yet) come to my Imagination, than is, The Present and Continuall Seruice, of Threescore, good, and Tall, warlik Ships, with Twenty smaller and those Ships (great and small) with apt Men, furnished: and all, singularly well appointed, for Seruice, (both on Sea and Land) faithfully and diligently, to be done, in such Circumspect and Discrete Order, As, partly, haue in other places declared: and farder (vpon good Occasion Offred) may declare.
This Grand Nauy, of peaceable king Edgar, of so many Thousand
Succes, therof: are, (in a maner,) Kingly lessons, and Propheticall Incouragements, to vs left: (Euen now) to be as
Prouident for Publik Security, as he was: To be as
Skilfull of our and Royall Limits: And wisely to finde our selues, as Hable to Recouer and
Enioy the same, as he was: who, could not chose, but with the Passing and yeerly Sayling about this Brytish Albion, with all the Lesser Iles, next adiacent, round about it: He could not chose (I say) But by such Full and Peaceable Possession finde him self, (according to right, and his harts desire) the True and Souerayn Monarch, of all the Brytish Ocean, enuironing any way, his Impire of Albion, and Ireland, with the lesser Ilands, next adiacent.
With Memoriall wherof, (as with one very precious Iuell Imperiall,) he adorned the Title and Crown of his Regality: As (with the Testimony annexed of the States and Nobles of his Impire) to Commit to perpetuall Memory, The Stile of his chief worldly Dignity, in this very Tenor of woords (before, also, Remembred:) EGO AEDGARVS, ANGLORVM BASILEVS, omnium{que} Regum Insularum, OCEANIQVE BRITANNIAM CIRCVMIACENTIS, Cunctarúmque Nationum quae infra eam includuntur, IMPERATOR ET DOMINVS.
What nede we, now, any better President: than of a King, so Iust, as Edgar was, to learn, how Iustly, our Plat, for the is Prescribed, and layd owt? And, of a King, so Peaceable, as Edgar was, (And Therefore, Surnamed PACIFICVS ,) To learn those Princely Policies, which not onely stand with the Due Termes of Forreyn Peace, and Amity present, Royally preserued: But, also, cary with them, (Triumphantly) The Deadly Darte, and Hedding Axe, ineuitable to all forreyn Offenders, and Homish Rebells? SOMWHAT MORE, he sayd herein: (which here purposly omit:) But very much, is to be sayd, in the Premisses: (As by my sayd Instructor, perceiued not long synce:) which, to you, or other, in conuenient Tyme and Place, (and after his manner) he him self, can best
AS WELL of the Fowr conuenient Places, for the AERARIVM PVBLICVM, or to be in: (as, LONDON, YORK, and BRISTOW:) Both in respect of Safe Custody, of the And also in respect of the Conuenient Distances, from our Twenty Portes: And from the Fowr Chief Quarters, and the Hart also, of this ALBION: So that, Both to the sayd Exchecquers, and from them, all Payments, and Caryages, requisite, may be conueniently made:
As also, of his Plat, and IDEA De Officijs Or, De Muneribus
Militum Naualium, Nautarum of the In tyme of Peace, In tyme of Dowtfull Inclination Forrein, and in the Tyme of Open War: And that, eyther Ordinary, or Extraordinary, for the Day, for the Weke, for the Monthe, for the Quarter, and for the Yere.
of the to be sent wekely, or Oftener, to our Gracious Soueraign, and her most Vigilant Priuy Cownsailors, from the his in Tymes Suspicious, or Dowbtfull: And but euery Fortnight, Once, in Tymes of Assured Tranquillity: And that, by some of our Smaller Barkes: And to One of the Assigned Twenty Portes, being next to him, at that Instant.
And there, the sayd Messager, with the Smaller Bark, to Attend and Receiue from the Queenes Maiestie, and her Honorable Priuy Cownsaile, their will and pleasure: Answerable to the forsayd Certificat: And such farder Direction, as to them semeth for that Tyme, to be most Expedient.
Fardermore, of the Royall, very Sufficienly to be made, That the and All and euery of the and Mariners, of the with their Ships, shall and be in their Assigned Ports: Within any one Fortnight Space, after the Day of their Receiuing the Expres Charge, and Sufficient Warrant, from our Soueraign, to that Intent: Vnles, Contrary, or Raging Storme, and Tempest, Cause, and Force, longer Delay.
Wherein, the FAITHFVLL COMMONS, do nothing Dowt of the of the Higher Powers, to Forsee, that Such Dutifull Repayre and Attendance of the with all his Charge, (as is here specifyed,) shall be Nothing Dammageable, or Preiudiciall, to the Prosperous Continuance of the those his waighty Seruyces, which partly before are spoken of, and other, which (Yet) are to be spoken of.
There remayne also, to be Declared, the Reasons, why my Instructor doth Wish, and Aduise, Parte of the to be bestowed vpon some Two, or Three Honest Men, who should be Skilfull in As, in the Sclauonian, or Moschouite, the Arabik Vulgar, the Turkish, the Tartarien, the Chiny Language, the Canadien, and the Islandish, &c.
For that, (within these few yeares next following, with Men of all these Cuntries, and farder, Great Affayres are by some of our to be handled: Yf God contynue his Gracious Direction, and Ayde thereto, as he hath very begonne: and that, by means not yet published.
And some also, of the sayd he did Assigne, for a good Stypend geuing to an Excellent Enginer, aswell for Matters of Fortification, as also, for Inuenting of Weapons, or Engyns, Offensiue, or Defensiue, by Land, or Sea: And likewise, for Engyns of Seruice, for otherwise: By Land, and Sea: Either aboue Grownd and Water, or vnder Grownd and Water, &c.
Moreouer, some Parte to be bestowed on Fowr Christian Philosophers, Skilfull, or to become Skilfull, and also Excellent: both in Speculation, and also Practise, of the best Manner of the Ancient and Secret Philosophie: which is not Vulgar: but, Vndowtedly, which may be most Comfortable, and Profitable, to Some, of Courteous KALID, his Disposition, &c. By which Titles of Matter, left Vnspecifyed hitherto, It may Euidently appere, that my Instructor hath (as it were,) but opened the Doore of his Philosophicall and Politicall Brytish Furniture: to be Fauorably vewed of them, whose Insight, is Sharp, and Profound: Whose Zeale, and Care also, for the of this Monarchy, to become most Christianlike Happy, (in all Respects,) is Ardent, and not
Seeing then, NO KINGDOM, in these Dayes, hath more nede of a and to be Continually at Sea maintayned, for the Respects aboue rehearsed: No Kingdome, hath apter TYMBER for Shipping: And thereof (YET) store enough: No Kingdome, hath Skilfuller, and more No Kingdome, hath Subiects better HABLE, and which more willingly will be Contributary for the sufficient Setting forth, and mayntenance of such a continually, at Sea (and that, for the former Respects:) No Kingdome, hath better store of APT and willing MEN: as well couragious Ientlemen, as other: very manfully disposed, to furnish the foresayd Nauy with, for all kynde of purposes: No Kingdome, hath better, or more Hauens, and HARBOROVGHS, (and those, round about it) to Succour a Nauy in, from Dangers, or Distres of Sea: No King, nor Kingdome, hath, by Nature and Humayn Industry (to be vsed) any, more LAWFVLL, and more Peaceable Means (made euident) wherby, to become, In wealth, far passing all other: In Strength, and Force, INVINCIBLE: and in Honorable estimation, Triumphantly Famous, ouer all, and aboue all other: Than this hath: And, (To be brief) Seeing No Kingdome, is more Discrete, and willing to Vse the Opportunity, of any exceding great and Publik Benefit procuring to the same, than this Brytish Monarchy, is, or May be: Our hope, then is, That, vpon the Vniforme, Brotherly, Willing, and Frank Consent, of all States, of Men and People, of this Incomparable Realme of England: to this Godly, Politik, and most Commendable Means: to
preserue Amity and Peace, with all Forreyn Princes: And to Garde this in
Security, from taking Iniury of any, or by any, (Fraudulently, or Forcibly,) And to
kepe our own hands and harts, from Dooing, or Intending Iniury, to any Forreyner, on Sea or Land: Our Hope is, (sayd he,) That vpon this Godly
Author of Heauenly Peace, will so bend down his Mercifull and gratious Eyes, vpon vs: and so manifestly stretch forth his Almighty hand to Bles, Furder, and Prosper the foresayd Oblation, with all the Purposes and Commodities therof expected, and likely to ensue: that, all we may, with the Kingly Prophet Dauid (both old and yong, Rich and most ioyfully, and Triumphantly, IN PERFECT SECVRITIE ,) Syng, Lauda HIERVSALEM Dominum, Lauda Deum tuum SION.
Quoniam confortauit Seras Portarum tuarum: Benedixit filijs tuis in te. Qui posuit fines tuos PACEM, Et adipe Frumenti satiat te. &c. Non fecit Taliter omni Nationi.
For, he hath Strengthened the Barres of thy Gates, And hath blessed thy Children within thee: He hath made all thy Borders PEACE: And with the good Nutriment of wheat, doth satisfy thee. &c.
He hath not done thus, to euery Nation, els: Prayse we all, the Lord therefore.
SOmewhat, haue now sayd, (quoth my Instructor) in this PETY NAVY MATTER: to discharge me of my Duty, to the herein: And very sory am, that know not, as much, as this most waighty Case requireth, to be Speedily known: And that am not able, aptly and Duly to Order and expres so much, as already know.
And most of all, Dowt, that some men will stick to performe, or shrinke to prefer, or be Careles to amend this Simple Plat: of me, speedily, zealously, and vnartificially deliuered to the pen, and very Briefly, expressed.
Moreouer, (Sayd he) if it should not be taken in worse parte, of OVR SOVERAIGN, than, of the Emperour of Constantinople, Emanuel the syncere Intent, and faythfull Aduise, of Georgius Gemistus Pletho was, could (proportionally, for the occasion of the Tyme, and place,) frame and shape very much of Gemistus those his two Greek Orations, (the first, to the Emperor, and the Second to his Sonne, Prince Theodore: for our BRYTISH ILES, and in better and more allowable manner, at this Day, for our People, than that his Plat (for Reformation of the State, at those Dayes, (could be found, for Peloponnesus auaylable.
But, Seeing those Orations, are now published: both in Greek and Latin, need not Dowbt, but they, to whom, the chief Care of such causes is committed, haue Diligently selected the Hony of those Flowres, already, for the great Benefit.
But, Gemistus sayd very well, THEN: GEORGII GEMISTI PLEthonis de Rebus Peloponnesi, ORATIO.

Nam qui antè, Byzantium incoluerunt, Graeci fuerunt ac Dores: (Dores autem, Peloponnesios esse, Nemini dubium est:) Et qui posterioribus Saeculis illustrem illam ex Italica Roma deduxerunt Coloniam, tam{que} praeclaro Byzantium auxerunt Additamento, non sunt Peloponnesijs alieni.
Siquidem, vt AEneadae Sabini pari Iure permisti, Romanam Vrbem foelicissimam incoluerunt, Ita Sabini censentur Peloponnesij de Lacedaemonijs profecti.
Quocirca, nec his de causis parui facienda tàm vobis, quàm nobis, est haec Regio: Quandoquidem maximè propria, curanda sunt maximè: Et haec omnium est maximè Propria.
Et, si de ipsius virtute, qua nulli Terrae cedit, dicendum est, vt ea quae de Anni temporum temperie, de{que} Terra nascentium, omnium ad vitam pertinentium prouentu dici possint, nunc omittam: AD SECVRITATEM sanè, nullam non Regionem haec superat: cum Insula pariter tanta sit, Continens.
Nec difficulter possint eius Incolae, si rectè suppetentibus vtantur adiumentis, cum apparatu minimo, si quis inuadat, repellere: Tùm ad alios, vbi videatur ipsi, accedere: ita{que} Regionis terminos non leuiter augere.
Praetereà, nunc Montium munimenta, qui per totam porriguntur terram, vbi{que} (Arcium instar) eminent, sic vt hostes, etiamsi Campestri solo forte potiantur, tota tamen excidant Regione.
Quo fit, vt non tàm familiaritatis, quàm virtutis ipsius causa curanda videatur haec Regio: "Quandoquidem possessiones potiores, potius etiam studium solent requirere.
Iam cùm omnibus, qui inter Graecos censentur, haec impendit Cura, tùm Regibus maximè, quibus vniuersi Tutela, prae caeteris, est commissa.
Neminem porrò superiorum Regum, propius quàm Te, haec Res attingit
Nam cùm Itali ditionem hanc tenerent, in ea{que} longo tempore Regnassent, soli eam vestrae Familiae Principes recuperarunt.
Et ipse Tu, praeter alia multa magná{que} Beneficia, praeclarum illud at{que} ingens Opus nuper erexisti, ducto per Isthmum Muro: maxima praestantissima Perpetuae Salutis occasione.
Quocircà vos decet, cum priorum Beneficiorum collocatione, haec etiam consequentia coniungere: quò simul ipsi rerum praeclararùm augmento studere videamini, ipsa vobis ante collata beneficia, perpetuitate Consequentium, salua permaneant.
Neque parùm, tùm SECVRITATIS, tùm Emolumenti, magnae quo{que} isti vrbi (vt arbitror) haec Regio rectè constituta adferet: id quod, hoc quidem loco pluribus explicare superuacaneum nobis videtur.
Ac studium quidem summum hanc mereri Regionem, satis me, quantùm res postulat, demonstratum existimo: Quam autem diligentiam, cum prioribus vestris coniungi Beneficijs, quae{que} harum rerum corrigendae potissimùm videantur, quo{que} illae pacto compositae, plurimùm sint fructus allaturae, nunc aperiam: si ea priùs, quae in his minus rectè habent, explicuero.
And agayn: Quocirca, priusquam tale quid eueniat, Decet nos, dum in Tuto Sumus quae minus rectè videntur se habere, corrigere: &, quantùm Liceat, Necessaria praeparare: ne, Si quis fortè casus accidat, eum difficulter feramus.
Nam, in ipso quidem discrimine, non satis commodè correctionem, si quae requirunt, recipiunt. &c. SECVRITATEM deni{que} vniuersis praestant Milites, Praefecti, qui{que} alij alias Reipub. partes curant: singula{que} tùm parua, tùm magna conseruant: praecipuus REX, omnibus Imperans, omniá{que} gubernans, conseruans &c. Quòd si quid sanè aliud, melius pariter et facilius, ab alio subijciatur, illud sequendum erit.
Contemnenda certè res ista non est: nec in hoc statu prauo, simul periculoso, reliquenda.
Atqui nec melius nec vtilius quenquam, quid aliud, eo, quod me prolatum est, reperturum aio: Ne{que} difficulter ad effectum id perduci posse: aut potiùs, difficulter, hoc in statu, res istas diutius, abs{que} magno periculo incommodo, durare posse.
Ne{que} difficulter facies, vt, cùm ipse Rebus presis omnibus, quae optima simul ac Iustissima videantur, ac tùm publicè, tùm priuatìm omnibus vtilissima, constituas. &c. Atque Ego quidem quae fore vtilia censeo, quibús{que} de Causis, dixi: Et, vt, eadem etiam praestantissimis filijs tuis, hac Orationis forma exposui: ita, Tuum praecipuè requirunt Calculum: quem, tanquam ab aliquo sortita Numine., simul honesta videantur, ad exitum perducantur: Faxit autem Deus, vt eum qui prosit, vndecun{que} rectè se habeat, Calculum feras.
ANd Bycause, in Gemistus his Second Oration, to Prince Theodore (this Emperour his Sonne) there are many thinges, (In my Instructor his Opinion) woorth the knowledge and Consideration: and not vtterly vnapt for this place: And for that, it should be a Disgrace, so to mangle the whole matter, and a hynderance to the vnderstanding therof: to break of, the particular Notes, so often, from the other Circumstances of woords, and Sentences annexed in the course of the same Oration, as thinges fall owt, Notable: And bycause, this way, the very whole Text of the sayd Oration, may easier be had, than from beyond the Seas, (as they are,) in Greeke and Latin prynted: thought it some Reasonable Cause, why, should, here, set down the same Oration, whole: that, whosoeuer should mete with the MEMORIALS of these Discourses, nede not want the same, if it be to his Liking.
GEORGII GEMISTI PLEthonis ad Principem Theodorum de Rebus Peloponnes: Oratio Posterior: GVLIELMO CANTERO, Interprete.
[Figure: Elisabetha Regina CVm in Naui Gubernator, omnia pro suo solet arbitrio dirigere, quae ad vectorum Salutem pertine~t: Tùm in Exercitu, Dux, quae ad Militum victoriam.
(Alioqui nec vectoribus, nec Militibus, vel tantillo tempore res rectè procederent, nisi ab Vno vtrae{que} viro regerentur: apertissimè, maximis in periculis, Monarchiam, simul tutissimam vtilissimam deprehendimus:) Veruntamen, et in Naui Licere videmus Vectorum alicui, qui consilio suo communem videatur Salutem iuuare posse: et in excercitu, Militi similiter: illi quidem apud Gubernatorem, huic autem ante Ducem, quae in me~tem venerint exponere.
Illis porrò cùm audierint, vel arripere Licet consilium, vel benignè et sine acerbitate reijcere.
Siquidem non iniquè ferendum est, Siquis in Periculo communi, Salutis publicae curam ad se quo{que} nonnihil arbitretur pertinere.
Enimuerò hac quoque in Gente nostra, atque Vrbe, tibi quidem, vir Clarissime, totius est rei cura commissa: per{que} multorum maiorum, Regum, Patris{que}, etiam Regis, manus, haec ad te deuenit nostrae Regionis haereditas: in qua tibi omnia, prout tibi ac nobis videantur profutura, Licet omniu~ pleno consensu disponere.
Cum autem tuae quidem sic se res habeant, nostrae autem in magno versentur discrimine: (Siquidem, vndique nobis, Terra Mari{que} tenduntur Insidiae: adeóque Domi etiam Barbaris simul Gentilibus, maximè autem vicinis istis Barbaris, qui etiam reliqui Dominij maximam ac potissimam partem nobis ademerunt: Parapamisadae origine cum sint, obiter ab Alexandro Philippi F. deuicti, cum is ad Indos tenderet, nobis nunc, tanquam Graecis, longo quidem pòst tempore, multiplices autem horum poenas expetunt: Cum{que} longè praestent viribus, extrema nobis quae{que} semper minantur.)
Cùm igitur haec ita se habeant, non absurdè mihi facturus videor, Si, cùm de Salute communi paulo melius fortasse, quàm caeteri, sentire videar: ad te, Principem nostrum, accedam, que{que} tibi simul et nobis omnibus existimem Salutaria fore, subijciam.
Illud autem primùm te petam, si forte non Totus Sermo voluptate sit conditus, verùm aliquid etiam subsultet asperius, vt me praestantiora vtiliora patiaris incundis praeferre.
Nam ne Medicos quidem video, cùm Salus aegrotantium agitur, vel acerbissimis cibis, potibus, Pharmacis alijs abstinere: Contráque, Coquos plerun{que}, obsoniorum Voluptate, corpus etiam Adeo non semper quae iucunda, sunt vtilia: verùm iuuant etiam acerbissima.
At{que} hoc primum est existimandum, nec priuatis hominibus, nec Rebuspub. vel in maximis difficultatibus, de meliori fortuna esse desperandum.
Nam Tròiani, qui cum AEnea, capta Graecis patria, in Italiam sunt ex Phrygia delati, ita prosperam deinde sunt experti fortuna~, Vt, cùm Romam paulò post vnà cum Sabinis, de Lacedaemonijs profectis, pari iure permistis, incoluissent, ab hoc principio maximum pariter praeclarissimum obtinuerint Imperium.
Et Persae, post Alexandri Graecorum{que} dominium, Cùm Romanis esset euersa Macedonum potentia, non leuiter ipsi Parthorum ope suas recuperarunt Vires: sed vt etiam contra Romanos, qui tum erant potentissimi, bellum gesserint: vt nonnunquam superati fuerint, ita postremò splendidam reportarint victoriam: ex eáque multis annis Tributum quoque Romanis imperarint.
Quocirca nec nos decet nosmetipsos abijcere, vel de Salute desperare: Sed cùm ipsi post has aerumnas meliora speremus, illud etiam omni diligentia considerare, quibus modis ad SECVRITATEM aliquam res nostrae reducantur, meliorem pro facultate nostra statum nobis comparemus.
Vt autem meliorem sibi statum vel Ciuitas vel Gens aliqua firmiter, (quantùm quidem res humanae ferunt,) comparet, non alia res efficit, quam REIPVBL: EMENDATIO.
Nulla siquidem alia Ciuitatibus est vel faelicitatis vel infaelicitatis causa, quàm Resp. rectè vel secus constituta.
Quòd si qua Casu rectè se Ciuitas habeat, id firmum non est, ac leui de causa potest immutari.
Plerunque aute~, vel bona Rep. conseruantur crescunt Ciuitates: vel contrà, corrupta, ipsae collabuntur ac pereunt.
Nam communiter Graeci non antè latissimè patentem obtinuerunt gloriam, quàm Hercules Amphitryonis F. Iniustitia Sublata, bonam Reipublicae constitutionem, virtutisque studium ipsis conciliauit.
(Siquidem ante Herculem quidem non valdè fuit celebre Graecorum genus, cui Danai, Cadmi, ex Barbaria aduenae, imperarent: post Herculem autem, multas Graeci magnâs{que} tùm Graecis, tùm Barbaris retulerunt victorias:) Lacedaemonij non antè vel Graecorum facti sunt Principes, quàm Lycurgo praeclaram illam Reip: constitutionem acciperent: vel Principatu pulsi exciderunt, quàm eandem negligerent, ac tum sibi Maris imperium vindicarent, qui terram eatenus tenuerant: tùm equitatu minimùm valerent: quem vt alebant ditissimi qui{que}, ita belli tempore, alijs, cum armis qualibuscun{que} tradebant: tùm sociis non clementer amplius imperare~t.
Quocirca sunt Thebanis deuicti, ductu Epaminondae, qui Doctrinam Pythagoricam non segniter perceperat.
Philippus quo{que} ab hoc Epaminonda, cum Thebis Obses degeret, institutus, Graecorum Princeps euasit: nec non eius F. Alexander, cùm Philippi patris, tum Aristotelis insuper institutione, Graecorum Imperium, Asiae Regnum superatis Persis sibi comparauit.
Quinetiam Romani ad maximum Principatum, Reip. bonitate peruenerunt: nec prius res illorum labi coeperunt, quàm Remp. immutassent.
Saraceni deni{que} isti olim quidem parua quaedam erant Arabum pars, ferè parebant: Postquam verò mutata Rep. leges quasdam ferri sibi passi sunt, quae vt non ad aliud quicquam, saltem ad Ciuitatum augmentum bellicas victorias viderentur conducere: Primùm Gentilium Arabum nacti sunt Imperium, deinde Romanorum dominio maximam potissimam ademerunt partem: tum Africam sibi adiecerunt: postremò Persas in suam redegerunt potestatem.
Sed aliae Gentes aliquot, horum vtentes moribus ritibus, foelicitate frui videntur.
Atque adeò isti, qui nobis plurimùm praestiterunt, Barbari his vtentes legibus maxima potentia polluerunt.
Eodem ferè pacto, si quis reliqua consideret, Gentes vrbes reperiet ex bonis vel malis Rebuspublicis, recte se vel secus habuisse.
Quare, si hoc videbitur considerandum, quibus modis tùm ad Salutem perueniamus, tùm potiorem statum nobis comparemus: Emendanda duntaxat est Respublica, prauis institutis in rectiora commutatis.
Iam, cùm sint multa quae Rempub. constituant, eam{que} singula vel meliorem vel peiorem efficiant, nimirum quae plurimis potissimis constabit melioribus, proba futura est Respub. quae ijsdem peioribus, improba.
Ac primùm, quia Rerump. tria sunt genera, Monarchicum, Oligarchicum, Democraticum: Plures{que} item singulorum species, quibus vel corrigitur vel corrumpitur Resp.
Prudentissimi sanè qui{que} Monarchiam, Consultoribus optimis et legibus probis, ijs{que} ratis vtentem, cunctis praetulerunt.
Ac de Consultoribus quidem, primùm, Eruditorum hominum laudatur moderata Copia.
Nam vulgus, quoniam difficulter inter se intelligunt, multos{que} habet indoctos, temerarios plerun{que} fert calculos: Et qui paucissimo constant numero, cùm Priuatim sectentur Lucrum, praua dant ferè Consilia.
At qui simul moderato numero fuerint, non indocti, cùm vt alius aliud consideret, atque in medium proferat, ita Communi vtilitate communiter ducantur, optimi erunt ac certissimi Consultores.
Deindè hoc requiritur, vt mediocri sint fortuna, nec vel ditissimi vel pauperrimi: siquidem illi, prae diuitiarum studio, nihil ferè suadent aliud, quàm vnde Lucrum ipsis aliquod proueniat: hi, prae inopia, nihil spectant aliud, quàm vt Necessitati subueniant suae.
Leges verò, probae sunt, vt vno verbo dicam, quae sua singulis, tùm in Vrbe, tùm in Gente quauis, officia definientes, alienis negotijs vetent se immiscere.
At{que} in omni ferè Ciuitate, Primum maximè Necessarium est, et Numerosissimum, Rusticorum genus: Agricolarum videlicet, Pastorum, qui{que} alij Terrae fructus proprijs manibus colligunt.
Alterum est Opisicum genus, Mercatorum, Institorum, similium: quod primis illis ac reliquae Ciuitati inseruit: dum Opifices quidem Supellectilem humanae vitae necessariam, in medium producunt: Mercatores autem, quae singulis Regionibus vel desint vel supersint, de vna in aliam transferendo Exaequant: quoniam alij suis coguntur rebus vacare, ipsi hanc Prouinciam suscipiunt: Institores deni{que}, de Rusticis quidem, vel Mercatoribus emunt vniuersa: requirentibus autem singulis, quandocun{que} quocun{que} velint numero, diuendunt.
Nonnulli etiam corporis vires elocantes, nunc his nunc illis ministerium exhibendo victitant.
Postremum est Principum genus, qui vel Vrbem, vel Gentem totam conseruant, at{que} custodiunt.
Quorum, vt supremus est Rex, ita post illum, alij alias Vrbis vel Gentis sortiti partes, ritè conseruant.
Cùm enim hoc omnibus persuaderi nequeat, aequitatem abs{que} iniuria sectandam esse, nec tendendas cuiusquam bonis insidias: Nonnulli autem, vel primi vel secundi generis, omissis operibus suis, aliorum inhient laboribus: Contra hos, instituti sunt, ex amicis quidem, Iudices, reliqui Praefecti: ex inimicis verò, Milites, horum Duces.
Quibus, cùm tanquam publicae intentis custodiae, aliundè suppeditanda essent necessaria, Tributa Rusticis, in Dimensum Publicorum Custodum, imperata sunt: Merces pariter et Praemium Custodiae futura.
Cum porrò, tria haec prima sunt hominum in vrbe genera, propria quaedam singulorum esse debent officia: quae quidem proba Lex obire quem{que} iubet, nec inter se confundere.
Principes igitur nullum subeant Ministerium, quandoquidem Imperio maximè contrarium est ministrare.
Sunt autem inter Ministeria, cùm alia quae recensuimus, tum Institoria Mercatura.
At Lex, nec Mercaturam nec Institoriam facere, nec aliud quicquam non liberale tractare.
Similiter Vulgo secernantur Milites; ac Seruatores seruandis: illi quidem ab omni Collatione liberi Militent, ac Populum Hi verò suas res agentes idonea, simul nec grauia Principum Militum delectorum Dimenso, Tributa pendant.
Maior verò pars Exercitus potior, Ciuium sit ac domesticorum, non Peregrinorum: siquidem raro fidi sunt Peregrini, multis{que} mutationibus: interdum pro Seruatoribus at{que} Custodibus hostes existunt.
Domestici verò si rectè curentur, magis firmi sunt at{que} fidi.
De Rusticis autem pleri{que} militiae assueti, per coniugationes diuidantur, eorum{que} alterutro communibus ferè laborante sumptibus, vicissim alter laboret, alter militet: sic vt pariter et familiae suae curam Salutis Communis ijdem, quantum fieri possit, gerant.
Separentur autem in exercitu Pedites ab Equitibus: Peditibus quidem in Turmas sub Ducibus, Equitibus autem in Alas sub Magistris relatis, quò confestim possint, vbicun{que} fuerit opus, ordine adesse.
Neque simul vtrae{que} Copiae, Terrestres ac Nauales, cogantur: verùm alterae semper, eae{que} Si id Vrbis Gentis at{que} etiam Regionis patiatur Natura, potiùs terrestres: ne cum vtris{que} simus inferiores, neutros vincamus.
Ac praestat longè Terrestribus Copijs in militum ac Ducum virtute, quam Nautarum ac aliorum hominum vilium arte fiduciam ponere: ac terra potitos, indidem necessaria nancisci, quàm peregrè petere: relictis{que} Mari proximis locis, nisi cogat extrema necessitas, soli cum vicinis bello vacare: quàm pluribus, tùm cum vicinis, tùm cum exteris.
Iam Tributorum tria sint minimùm genera, Primum Seruitus, deinde certa siue pecuniae, siue aliarum rerum summa, tùm quaedam rerum nascentium pars: Grauissimum quidem Tributi genus est Seruitus, quippe quod non opes arripiat, sed corpora: nec paruam ipsis praebet exactoribus molestiam, quorum praesentiam quotannis requirit: certa verò summa, praeter seruitutem, magnam etiam habet inaequalitatem, dum necessariò penditur, et saepènon pro opibus: quando nec facilè sit opibus cuius{que} Tributum exaequare, nec singulorum opes eandem semper obtineant magnitudinem.
(Eadem quidem per partes quotannis saepiùs pluribus exacta, longè maiorem difficultatem parit.)
Rerum autem nascentium quaedam pars cùm seruitutis minus habet, tùm quouis alio Tributo, tantundem quod efficeret, multo leuior est, ipsa temporis ratione, (quandoquidem, quo tempore fructus singulis colliguntur, de ipsis petitur fructibus:) nec non aequalitatem habet maximam, dum quis{que} pro opibus persoluit: quo fit, vt optimum sit hoc Tributum, cùm leuissimum sit, vt diximus, aequissimum: &, si cum aequitate exigatur, Reipubl. vtilissimum.
Terrae fructus tria potissimùm requirunt, Operas, Sumptus operis praebendos, (vt boues, vineas, Armenta, et similia) horum Custodiam.
Quapropter etiam Tribus iure debentur, Operis, sumptuum Dominis, ac deni{que} Custodibus vniuersorum et Seruatoribus, quos Reges, Principes, alios{que} Praefectos diximus.
Rustici ergo, qui suis laborant sumptibus, cùm liceat ipsis quocun{que} loco, terram quouis pacto colere, duabus fruentes partibus, altera operis, altera sumptibus debita, Tertiam Reipubl. et Custodibus vniuersorum praestent: omni alia Collatione quacunque omni{que} ministerio vacantes.
At{que} hoc sit iustissimum Tributum, Praemium simul ac Dimensum publicis ministris futurum.
Viuendi porrò ratio, cùm reliquorum Ciuium, tùm Praefectorum maximè, non sumptuosa, sed moderata sit: sic vt peregrinas quidem vestes et nugas alias negligant: ad Bellum autem sint omnes compositi, qui{que} huc pertinent apparatus, diligenter procurent: quos quidem, aliò sumptus transferuntur, diminui oportet ac deteri.
Terrae fructus nemini liceat, quocunque velit, nisi alteram partem pro vectigali pendat, euehere.
Sin quis ferro, vel armis, vel alia re necessaria velit mutare, nihil pendat.
Moneta nec improba nec peregrina vtamur: ne videamur etiam praua aliena vti Republica.
Sontes ne Barbarico more mulctentur, vt post mulctam minimùm deinceps peccent.
Nam qui videntur insanabiles esse, eos de medio praestat auferentes, animam corpore liberare, qua non recte nouit vti: quàm illos mutilantes, hanc tùm corpori mutilo at{que} inutili, tùm reliquae Ciuitati alligare.
Leges, aliae{que} similes: Caput autem horum est omnium, de Deo rectè publicè et priuatim sentire, maximè autem haec tria: Primùm, esse Deum quendam praestantissimam omnium Naturam: deindè, hunc homines curare, et res omnes humanas tùm magnas, tùm paruas regere: tùm arbitrio suo cuncta illum rectè iuste{que} semper administrare, nusquam ab officio deflectentem, vel alia de causa, vel hominum donis delinitum, quibus non indigeat.
Quae cùm ita se habent, consequitur illud, vt in cultu sacra donaria{que} modo pietate adhibitis offerant, velut inde bonum omne proficisci fatentes: nec vel minùs praestantes, aut duarum, aut alterius saltem duarum impietatis formarum opinionem sibi comparent: vel nimio sumptu, priuatas domos Rempubl. perdentes, quasi donariorum quicquam proficeret magnificentia: nec amplius quid offerre, sed redimere visi, tertio se impietatis generi obstringunt.
Has demum sententias publicè priuatim{que} confirmatas, necessariò virtus honesti omne studium sequitur.
At vitium quoduis et maxima mortalium peccata, de contrarijs nascuntur sententijs.
Semper enim existunt nonnulli prauis opinionibus imbuti: vel nullum esse prorsus Deum arbitrantes, vel vt sit, res tamen humanas negligere: vel deni{que} vt sit atque curet, corrumpi nihilominus posse, sacris{que} ac donarijs delinitum, nonnunquam ab officio deflectere.
Ab his enim duabus inter se contrarijs de Deo sententijs, tanquam fontibus, duo procedunt vitae genera, plurimùm inter se dissidentia: quorum alterum virtutem vel solum, vel summum ponit bonum, alterum Voluptatem.
Etenim cùm Hominis natura, partim Diuina sit, partim humana, (quod omnibus Graecis Barbaris vel aliqua praeditis mente visum fuit) Diuinitatem quidem Animo, humanitatem autem exprimente Corpore.
Qui quidem Diuinitatem Ducem secuti, cùm rectè de cognata natura senserint, tùm ad virtutis normam vitam omnem direxerint, Boni sunt omnis inter homines Auctores: qui verò mortali ac ferina parte ducti, cùm de Deo secus senserint, tùm ad voluptatem retulerint omnia, magnorum contrà sunt Auctores Malorum.
Inter hos Medij sunt, qui Gloriae student, qui Diuitijs: cùm simulacrum illa sit virtutis, hae voluptates concinnet.
Et in eorum quidem numero, qui virtutem sunt amplexi, cùm alij saeculis omnibus extitere, tum Amphitryonis F. Hercules, quem diximus bona reipubl. constitutione virtutis{que} studio Graecis conciliato, celeberrimos illos reddidisse, cùm sibi primùm ipsi virtutem crebris laboribus certaminibus comparasset: Lycurgus item Lacedaemonius, qui fratre Rege sine liberis mortuo, cùm Coniunx, quae grauidam se norat, ad ipsum se, fetu abolito, Regnum vnà cum Matrimonio delaturum recepisset, re non concessa, quoniam Iustitiae repugnabat, fratris{que} filio tum vita conciliata, tum paterno dominio restituto, aliquanto pòst tempore Legislator suis constitutus, praeclara illa Reip. constitutione introducta, celeberrimam ipsam vrbem cùm inter Graecos tùm inter Barbaros reddidit: Alexander quoque Rex Macedonum, qui per virtutem simul animi magnitudinem, Graecorum Princeps effectus, ipsis pariter Macedonibus, Asiae comparauit imperium: Nec non inter Barbaros, Persa Cyrus, qui Persas suos virtute propria cùm tyrannide liberauit, tùm horum Asiae reliquae dominos constituit.
In altero verò numero cùm alij recensentur, tùm Alexander Troianus, Priami filius, qui in Dearum iudicio, vitae{que} generum electione, tùm Iunone contempta, virtutis Praeside, tum Auctore gloriae Minerua, Venerem voluptatis Deam praetulit.
Quapropter neglectis tùm Regno Iunone concesso, vita cum virtute et foelicitate coniuncta: tùm Minerua oblata victoria bellica, vita gloriosa: Helena verò Lacaena Tindarei F. Menelai Atridae coniuge, praemio tam iniqui iudicij accepta, tanquam voluptatis colophone, vt corpore omnium pulcherrima, sic animo turpissima adultera, cum hac sese simul Patriam pessundedit.
Sardanapalus item Assyrius, qui per Mollitiem et luxum, Asiae Imperium Assyrijs quidem suis ademit, Medis autem concessit: Nec non de Romanis Nero, qui cùm alijs grauibus ac nefandis perpetratis, tùm occisa matre, seipsum quo{que} tandem malum malè perdidit.
Nam Patriam cupiebat quidem, sed prae Romanorum virtute, nondum poterat euertere.
Ac saepè plures existunt huius generis, tum inter Principes, tùm inter Priuatos, alij grauiùs alijs peccantes: in his etiam illi, qui Iustitiam quidem et Veritatem Bonum Commune pro vmbris ducunt, auro autem similibus inhiant: foelicitatem quidem in vestibus, auro, argento, luxu{que} quotidiano ponentes, Propriam vero simul liberorum, et Patriae totius Libertatem, ac SECVRITATEM negligentes.
Quidam etiam donec auro similibus, res caret, ac per se consideratur, vehementissimè Iustitiam Veritatem defendunt: Sed simul atque vel aurum, vel Auri quid simile micuerit, mox lingua ligatur, os obturatur, ac de Iustitia quidem silent: Ad contraria verò, omnis illa conuertitur vehementia.
Siquidem ab his huius generis hominibus, cum reguntur Respub. semper sunt infoelices, quando ne probissimae quidem latae leges habentur ratae, sed omnia temerè permiscentur.
Non enim tantùm probas leges requirunt Respubl. sed etiam ratas: quales quidem per virtutem Principum existunt: quam, tria praecipua Pietatis genera diximus consequi.
Postquam autem alia re nulla, quàm Salute, nunc indigemus, (non enim nos latet, quò res ex amplissimo Romanorum Imperio deuenerunt, quibus duae tantum in Thracia relictae sunt vrbes, et Peloponnesi pars aliqua, ac si qua restat etiam Insula,) Salutem autem Ciuitatum duntaxat proba Republ. diximus proficisci: Respubl. nobis legibus praestantissimis et Moderatoribus quàm fieri poterit optimis erit emendanda.
Etenim quantò res nostrae peiori sunt loco, infirmiores cum potentioribus hostibus committimur, tanto magis Rempubl. potiorem decet nos opponere, quae reliquorum exaequet imbecillitatem.
Quibus autem rationibus optima constituatur Respub. iam diximus: potissimis quibús{que} ad rem praesentem maximè pertinentibus expositis, ijs{que} non valdè difficilibus.
Quae enim res ex vnius voluntate effectum suum vel sortiuntur, vel amittunt, non debent pro valdè difficilibus haberi.
Etenim si tibi, qui Princeps noster es, maxima polles potentia; praeclarae alicuius rei gerendae Deus amorem inspirauerit, cùm virtutem at{que} honestatem exactè secteris, non difficulter hae res constitui poterunt, nec ampliùs erit de salute nostra desperandum.
Siquidem in hoc posita omnia sunt, ex eo{que} vel Salus nostra, vel Pernities dependet.
Etenim si quam rem praeclaram magnam cupias gerere, nihil vel praeclarius vel maius tùm Salute Gentis, tùm Regni SECVRITATE facilè repereris.
Ea porrò non alia ratione, quàm quae modò fuit nobis exposita, componitur: quam{que} omnes vbi{que} laudatae sunt Ciuitates secutae.
Ac si duntaxat ipse volueris, hoc fueris animo, nullo negocio socios operis inuenies: probiores quidem primos muneribus destinans, reliquos autem benefactis mulctis corrigens: ac duobus his, tùm cupiditate bonorum, tùm contra peccantes ira rite vsus.
Siquidem nec absentia bona cuiquam licet adipisci, nisi cum labore desideret: nec praesentia seruare, nisi rationi ira obtemperet.
Constitutionem, si videtur, Consultoribus ordire: eos{que} tibi cùm alijs, tùm numero instructissimos, quemadmodum praecepimus, constitue.
Siquidem hinc aequum est incipere: cum{que} maiori parti visum quid fuerit, ita demùm rerum mutatione~ emendationem aggredi.
Ne{que} illos lateat, quanto res nostrae versentur in discrimine, quantum{que} salutis indigi simus: nec eam nisi emendata Republ. possimus consequi.
Nam qui aegrotant, si consueta viuendi ratione laeduntur, non aliter sanantur, quàm cùm hac omissa, commodiorem deligunt.
Deindè, maiorem exercitus partem expurga: diuisis bifariam Peloponnesijs: in Militantes, Collationem pendentes, prout singulorum feret ratio: sic, vt non ampliùs ijde~ simul et Militent et pendant.
Etenim nec teipsum pariter et gentem seruare poteris, nisi hostes deuiceris: nec hostes deuincere, nisi exercitum potiùs beneuolum animosum, quàm copiosum habueris.
Difficulter autem, pendens Exercitus, beneuolentiam simul animos conseruat: sed vtrum{que}, ferè, perdit.
Praefecti quo{que} secernantur Mercatoribus: cunctis quidem imperetur, ne Mercaturam vel Institoriam deinceps exerceant: sed se pro Praefectis gerant, Reipubl. custodiam et salutem procurantes, non seruilia obeuntes officia, quidem nequam seruorum, qui ponderibus iniustis quacun{que} re alia miseros Rusticos damno afficiunt.
Sin etiam de Mercatoribus aliqui fuerint ad Magistratus euecti, ij vel relicta Mercatura, si fuerint idonei, munere fungantur: vel loco moueantur.
Oportet enim haec secerni, non Praefectos cum Mercatoribus permisceri, nec Milites agros colere, nec Rusticis communem salutem committi: quae sunt omnia Reipubl. prauissimae, quae{que} nihil vnquam magnum vel praeclarum gesserit.
Enimuero nec Asinis ad Equorum vtimur opera, nec Equis ad Asinorum: adeo{que} nec Equis ijsdem ad omnia, verùm alijs bello, alijs ad sarcinas.
Tributis quo{que} multis istis, crebris, inaequalibus sublatis, illud omnium loco repone, quod rerum nascentium Tertiam diximus aequissimè complecti partem, leuissimum pendentibus Reipublicae vtilissimum idem futurum.
Nam propter hoc Tributum, nec temerè quis aufugiet, nec ab exactoribus iniuriam accipiet, dum illi pendentibus quamplurima volunt attribuere, quo videlicet simul Tributum crescat.
De his autem Hilotis, primùm tuae familiae, quot videbitur opus, selige: reliquos deinde Praefectis et Militibus primarijs, quanto voles numero concede.
Tum verò cogantur singuli pro Hilotarum asscriptorum numero Clientes alere, seruos videlicet militares: ne pecuniam publicam temerè profundant: quae{que} hostes in votis habent, vt Salutis Communis impensae turpiter dissipentur, ipsi videantur procurare.
Aquila Rex quidem est Auium, Iòui fuit olim consecratus, minime tamen varias aut fulgentes habet Alas.
Pauo contrà varius quidem est fulgens, sed minimè Regia natura.
Plures{que} Aues aliae Pauone longè viliores, colorum sunt varietate distinctae.
Quare videtur, qui vestibus praetextis ac similibus superbit, tanquam Pauonis pulcritudine gloriari.
Iam illud specta, sitne honestius ac iucundius, huc praecipuè tendentem, bello quantùm licet consulentem, moderato tùm vestitu, tum reliquo viuendi modo, hostes quidem contemnere, de Imperio autem ac Regno Securum esse: an veste praetexta inuolutum, tremere, et hostes metuere.
Quòd si porrò Pastores essetis, vtro modo lac impenderetis? Vtrùm partem quidem alteram ipsi consumeretis, altera verò canes robustos aleretis, qui ferarum insidijs Ouile defenderent: vt eo conseruato tùm Pastores esse, tum fructibus diù frui possetis: an hoc neglecto, partem quidem alteram ingurgitaretis vestimenta prolueretis, altera verò, Canum robustorum loco, Maelitaeos catellos vulpes aleretis, aut Vrsos, vt voracissimas Bestias, ita parùm intentas custodiae? Huc igitur omne studium conuerte, nihil omittens ne{que} praetexens, siue quid aut priorum Regum alicui, aut ipsi tibi aliter olim fuit visum, siue quibusdam non est res placitura: sed cùm omnia mouens, tùm nihil non ad Communem salutem pertinere visum tentans, quando ne Medici quidem sua semper possunt seruare decreta, sed cum omnia mouent, tum nihil ad sanitatem pertinens omittunt, ac secant etiam, vel vrunt, manum{que} interdum vel Pedem insuper ob salutem totius corporis abscindunt.
Horum siquidem ipse quaedam, si videbitur, cum liceat, perages: nonnulla ab Augusto Imperatore, Patre, Salutis Publicae causa postulabis.
Neque tibi ille difficulter ea concedet, cùm huc spectare cognouerit, Ingenium simul Impetum diuinum admiratus.
Caeterum his, quae maximè proximè videntur ad Salutem tendere peractis, reliqua sine vlla difficultate deinceps, quaecun{que} ad Reipubl. virtutem ornatum pertinent, assequeris: ac tandem optimam omnino Rempubl. nobis constitues.
Quanto quidem maior tibi nobis habetur honor, tantò etiam iacturam fore credes maiorem, si quid secus euenerit.
Enimuerò te potissimùm Salutis Communis decet curam gerere, nihil Cunctantem, nec differentem.
Siquidem nec licèt cunctari, cùm sit prae foribus periculum: nec alioqui tale negotium conuenit differre.
Nec imperitè videtur Hesiodus dicere: SEMPER AT IGNAVVS CVM NOXIS PRAELIA MISCET.
AND with this pithy peece of wise warning, by HESIODVS (very aptly to our present purpose) recorded, will end this first Treatise: falling out, in very good Oportunitie, to be in stead of a Preface, for the better vnderstanding and enioying the rest of the RARE MEMORIALS ensuing: collected, according to the Title prefixed.
For which Preface, being thus, (though with more zeale than cunning) finished, yeld thanks most humbly to the Omnipotent Spirit of Veritie, the Spirit of all Comfort and Bountifulnes: which Directed enclined the Minde and Tongue of my Instructer, thus to prefer the SAFETY AND POLITIKELY ASSVRED PEACE VNIVERSALL, OF THIS BRYTISH KINGDOM, before any other Lucre, or Honor, Publike or Priuate: As, without which PEACE AND TRANQVILLITY, neither the COMMONS: nor, the LORDES SPIRITVALL OR TEMPORALL: no, nor yet our most GRACIOVS ELIZABETH, can atteyne to the excellent Scope, and perfection of Ciuill State: vnto which, both, by the Law of God and Nature: and also by Humaine Policy, all sound and Bodies Politike, ought to direct all their Actions Ciuill.
And beseche you (Right Worshipfull Sir,) not onely to take these my speedy Trauailes and Collections in good parte, your selfe: But also, to whom so euer, you will deliuer any one of the Copies, (wherof, only one Hundred are to be printed, by the warning of my Instructor:) You would be my Carefull Orator, to this purpose chiefly: That my good will, and exceding zealous Intent herein, dutifully to pleasure this BRYTISH might be thankfully accepted: and so, my simple very faythfull Trauailes, to be rewarded.
And finally, that you would very earnestly request them, (for the CAVSE,) Speedily, Circumspectly, and Paradoxally to vewe this plat.
And then, to amend the Imperfection: and to Supply the wants thereof: (the better now to be espied, by these few warnings,) and prosperously, to farder some pithy Extract made of the whole matter: So much, as they, both by their Politike skill, and auailable Authority, best can: And, THEN, shall the foresaid PSALMODY, most aptly and hartily, of all true BRYTISH AND ENGLISH SVBIECTS, be song: Lauda HIERVSALEM Dominum, Lauda Deum tuum SION.
Quoniam confortauit Seras Portarum tuarum: Benedixit filijs tuis in te. Qui posuit fines tuos PACEM, Et adipe Frumenti satiat te. &c. Taliter omni Nationi.

YF Priuat wealth, be leef and deere, To any VVight, of Brytish Soyl: Ought Publik Weale haue any peere? To that, is due, all Wealth and Toyl.
Wherof, such Lore as (of late,) Haue lernd, and for Security By Godly means, to Garde this State, To you send, now, carefully.
Vnto the Gardians, most wise, And Sacred Senat, or Chief Powr, durst not offer this Aduise, (So homely writ,) for fear of Lowr.
But, at your will, and discreet choyce, To keep by you, or to imparte, leaue this zealous Publik voyce You will accept so simple parte.
M'Instructors freend did warrant me, You would so do, as he did his: That Redy freend, can witnes be, For Higher States, what written is: Of Gratefulnes, due Argument.
Yf greeuous wound, of sklandrous Darte, At length to cure, they will be bent, M'Instructor, then, will doo his parte, In ernest wise, know right well: No Merit shall forgotten ly.
Thus much, thought, was good to tell: God graunt you Blis, aboue the Sky.

[Figure: treatise perswadynge a man patientlye to suffre the deth of his frende.
Into this worlde naked we entered And so we must agayne out of it fare Deth By no man can Be defended.
There is no kynes thinge it wyll spare Than wherfore shulde we for it care At auayleth nat But passe forthe The harde strokes (chance they vnware) And paciently take them in worthe.
For they that take deth vnpacienly Seme to the worlde to set their mynde Blessed Be they that in our lorde dye For they Be sure the very lyfe to fynde.
comfortable exhortation agaynst the chaunces of deth made by Erasmus Rot.
HOwe bytter and howe greuous a wounde perceth your fatherly harte for the deathe of your mooste goodly chylde lightly co~recte by myne owne sorowe.
And therfore were ryghte moche vncourtoys if that in so sorowfull a chance wolde warne you his father to make lamentation whan that am but a straunger can nat chose but wepe wayle.
Ye myght well thinke me rude and vntaught if wolde go about to heale your gresse whan my selfe had nede of a phisitian: if wolde lette you his father to wepe whan the teares stylle abundauntlye trykell downe from myne eien.
And all be it that the ilke stroke of Fortune oughte deper to perce your fatherly breast: yet your great wysedome was wont so to rule you (in all your dedes) that ye nat onely with a stro~ge a stoute mynde but also with a glad and a mery chere wolde suffre and passe ouer all suche chaunces as happe to mankynde. wherfore ye oughte so to settell your selfe that if ye can nat as yet put awaye clene the sorowe of your harte (for no man can denye but that ye haue ryghte good cause to be heuy) yet at the least wyse some what suppresse moderate the same dolour.
And for what cause shulde ye nat clene forgette it? seinge that the space of a fewe dayes wyll cause idiottes so to do me thynketh reason shulde persuade an excellent wyse man.
For what selye mother doth so extremely bewayle the dethe of her childe but that in shorte space of tyme her sorowe some what asslaketh and at length is clene forgotten? To haue alway a stedfast mynde is a token of a perfecte wyse man.
But for those chaunces vnto the whiche we all egally (bothe more and lesse) be subiecte to sorowe out of measure me thynketh it extreme folys henes.
For who is nat ware (excepte he that myndeth nothynge) that he is borne vnder suche a condition that whan so euer god wyll call hym: he muste forth with nedes departe hence? So than what other thyng (I prey you) dothe he that bewayleth ones deth than lamentably complayne that he is mortall? Or why shuld we rather sorowe the departyngeÂ· hence than the entrynge in to this worlde consideryng that both are egally natural? Eue~ in lyke case as though one shuld gyue great thankes for to be called to a great feaste or dyner and wolde lament and demeane great sorowe wha~ he shulde departe away thence.
If that a man as hit were from an highe lokynge place wolde aduise well the co~dicion and lyfe of all mankynde: myght he nat well reken him selfe a nyce felowe if he amonge so manyfolde examples of priuation amonge so thycke buryals of yonge and olde wolde be greuously vexed in his mynde as thoughe vnto hym onely were chaunced some newe and great yuell: and as though he onely beinge happy aboue other wolde desyre and loke to stande without the co~mon lotte? For whiche consideration the excellent wise men that fou~de and made lawes in olde time to then tent that they wolde some what incline to the affections of pare~tes and to thende they wolde nat be seene to exclude euery body from that passio~ beinge also co~demned of some of the stoicke philosophers: they lymytted vnto the~ a certayne tyme to mourne the whiche endured nat very longe: Either bicause that they well vnderstode and knewe that in those maner of chaunces the whiche are bothe co~mune to all folkes and also do nat hap through any iniury of Fortune but are induced by the verye course and ordynaunce of Nature shorte mournynge shulde suffice: yea vnto them that were nat able to moderate all affections: consideryng that Natures selfe by lyttel lyttell soupleth the wounde that she made and weareth away the scarre: Or els bicause they diligently marked that mournynge was nat onely vnprofitable vnto them that were bemoned but also hurtful to the~ that made suche mone and greuous and vnquiete to theyr frendes acqueyntance and company.
But nowe if a man wolde consider the matter a ryghte doth it nat seme a poynt of madnes wyllyngly of one harme to make twayne and whan ye can nat by no maner reason recouer your predestinate losse yet wilfullye to annoye and hurte your owne selfe? In lyke maner as though a man that his ennemies hath spoyled of parte of his goodes wolde in his anger throwe all that euer remayned in to the see: and than wolde say howe he by that meane dyd bewayle his losse.
If we lyttell regarde the noble Mimus whose sayenge may beseme any philosopher to speake: Thou muste patiently suffre and grutche nat at it that can nat be amended: Let vs call to mynde the moche goodly example of the ryghte excellent kynge Dauid the whiche so sone as tydynges was broughte hym that his sonne that he so tenderly loued was deed: he forthwith rose vp from the grounde and shaked brusshed of the duste he threwe away his sherte of heare and so whan he had wasshed and an noynted with a gladde countenaunce and a mery chere he wente to dyner.
And by cause his frendes maruayled therat he sayde to them: For what entent shulde kylle my selfe with wo and sorowe? For vnto this tyme some hope had that god beinge moued with my lamentation wolde haue saued my childe a lyue: but now all our wepyng teares can nat restore hym agayne to vs a lyue: we shall shortly spede vs he~ce after him.
who is so fonde to crouche and pray hym who~ he knoweth well wyll incline to no prayers? There is nothyng more vntreatable than dethe nothynge is more deffe nor nothynge more rygorous.
By crafty handelynge the sauage beastis yea the moste wylde of them all are made tame: There is a waye to breake the harde marbull stone: and a meane to mollifie the diamant: but there is nothynge wherwith dethe wyll be appesed or ouer come.
And therfore it oughte to greue vs moche the lesse either bicause it can nat be esche wed or els by cause it is egally commune to vs all.
what nedeth me to go aboute to reherce to you here the manyfolde exambles of the gentiles the whiche with a noble and a constaunt courage toke well in worthe the deth of theyr dere frendes? In whiche constantnes of mynde is it nat a great rebuke for vs that be christiens to be of them ouer comen? Call nowe to your remembrance thilke sayenge (well worthye to be enrolled in writynge) of Telamon and Anaxagoras: wyste well begotte a mortall creature.
Thynke vpon Pericles the duke of Athens the whiche is no lesse renowmed for his eloquence than he is for his force and manlynes: al be it that he within.
iiij. dayes space lost his. ij. so~nes that were endewed with ryght noble qualities he nat onelye neuer changed his chere but also he beinge crowned (as was the gyse tha~) spake reasoned amo~ge the people of matters concernyng theyr co~mon welthe. [leaf motif]Haue in mynde also Xenophon the worthy scholer of Socrates: to whom tydynges was brought as he was doinge sacrifice that his sonne was deed: he made no more to do but put of his crowne forthwith dyd put it on agayne as sone as he vnderstode that his sonne was ma~ly slayne in batayle.
Remembre Dion of Syracuse the whiche on a tyme (as he was secretly talkynge with his frendes) sodaynly harde a great noyse and rumblynge in his house: And whan he had inquered what the matter mente and was enfourmed that his sonne had fallen from on highe and was deed: he beinge therwith nothing amoued co~maunded the corps (as the maner was) to be delyuered to women to burye: For he sayde he wolde nat leaue of his pretensed pourpose for that matter.
whom Demosthenes folowyng the vij. daye after the dethe of his onely and most entierly beloued daughter beinge crowned arrayed in a faire white garment he came forth abrode amo~ge the people.
Of whiche dede the accusation of his foo Aeschyies bothe confirmethe the trouthe and setteth out the glorie.
Thynke also vpon the kynge Antigonus the whiche whan he herde tydynges that his owne sonne was slaine in a disordred skermisshe: pausynge a lyttell and beholdynge them well that brought him the tydinges with a stoute and a constante mynde he sayde: Aleynonen (that was his sonnes name) all to late thou perisshest that woldest so folisshely cast thy selfe away amonge thy foes nothynge regardyng thyne owne helth nor my monitions and wordes.
If ye delite more to here the examples of Romanes beholde Puluillus horace to whom (as he was dedicatynge the capytoll) tydynges was broughte that his sonne was deed: he neyther drewe awaye his hande from the poste nor tourued nat his chere from religio~ to priuate sorowe.
Consider howe Paulus Aemilius whan he had within the space of. vij. dayes loste his. ij. sonnes he came forthe abrode amonge the people of Rome and there shewed them that he was very gladde that by the lamentation of his householde (which was but a priuate sorowe) he had redemed the enuye of Fortune bente towarde them all.
Thynke also howe Q. Fabius Maximus (whan he was consul and had loste his sonne that was than a man in hyghe rowme and dignitie and greatly renowmed for his noble act{is}) he came forthe abrode amonge the people gethered to gether and there to them he recited the co~mendation of his sonne.
Thynke on also whan Cato Censorius his eldest sonne died the whiche was a yo~ge man of singlar witte and highe prowesse and therto electe and chosen to be Meyre: yet was he nothynge so amoued with that chance that he wolde in any thynge more slackelye endeuour hym selfe aboute the nedes and busines of the co~mon welthe.
Ye shulde reme~bre Marcius whose surname was kynge whan his sonne of ryghte noble disposition and that stode highly in the fauour and good opinion of the people and therto beinge his only sonne was deed he toke the losse of hym with so constaunt a mynde that forthwith euen from the buriall of hym he caused the Senatours to asse~ble to gether to ordeyne lawes co~cerning their co~mon welthe.
Ye shulde nat forget Lucius Sylla whose valiaunt and moste fierce courage towarde his ennemies the deth of his sonne coude nothynge abate nor cause that he shulde seme falsely to haue vsurped or taken vpon hym to be called by this surname Felix that is to say luckye or welthy. whan Caius Cesar (that was Sylla his felowe in rowmeth) had inuaded Britayne and bad tidynges that his daughter was deed: yet er thre dayes were fully ended he wente about his imperiall busines. wha~ Marcus Crassus (in the warre that he made agaynst the Parthie~s) behelde his sonnes heed the whiche his ennemyes in skorne and derision had sette vp on a morispikes ende the more to exasperate and augme~t his calamitie they approched nere to his armie with wordes of reproche and blame they shewed it vp: he toke in worth all that doinge with so constant a mynde that sodaynelye he rode forby all his batayles and saide to them with a loude voice that that was his owne priuate harme but the helthe and saluation of the common weale stode in the sauegarde of them his men of warre.
But nowe to ouer passe the manyfolde examples of Galba Piso Sceuola Metellus Scaur{us} Marcellus Aufidius: reme~bre whan Claudius Cesar had loste hym whom be bothe begotte and moste entierely loued: yet for all that he (his owne selfe) in the co~mon pulpit lauded and praysed his sonne the cors beinge present all only couered with a littell veyle: and whan all the people of Rome wepte and bewayled his sonnes dethe he his father wepte nat a teare.
And surely lyke as it is a right good ly thyng to folowe do as these men dyd: euen so were it a right shamfull thynge if men shulde nat be founde as stedfast and as stoutely mynded as women haue ben in suche case.
Cornelia sawe and behelde her two sonnes (Tit. Graccus and Caius Graccus) slayne and vnburyed: and whan her frendes comforted her and sayde she had a wretched chaunce: wyll neuer saye (quod she) that am vnlucky or vnfortunate that haue borne suche two children.
But wherto do we now repete these examples out of auncient cronicles: as though we sawe nat dayly before our face sufficient exa~ples? Beholde your neighbours beholde your kyns folke and alies: howe many yea sely women shall ye finde the whiche verye moderately take in good worthe the dethe of theyr children? This matter is so plaine that there nedeth no great helpe of philosophie therto.
For he that wolde co~sider well in his mide how wretched on al sides this our life is to how many pils to how many sickenessis to how many chau~ces to howe many cares to how many inco~modities to how many vices and to howe many iniuries it is endangered: howe littell howe small a portion therof we passe forth (I will nat saye in pleasure) that is nat attached with some maner greffe and displeasure? and than farther to co~sider howe sweftely it vanissheth rolleth away that we may in maner reioyce be glad of them that ben departed out of this worlde in theyr youthe.
The shortnes of our lyfe Euripides sadly expresseth whiche callethe the lyfe of mortall creatures one lyttell daye.
But Phalereus Demetrius doth better whiche correctynge the sayenge of Euripides sayth that the lyfe of man shulde rather be called the Minute of an houre.
But Pyndarus saythe beste of all whiche callethe the lyfe of man the dreme of a shadowe.
He ioynethe two speciall thynges of nothynge to gether to thentent that he wolde declare howe vayne a thynge this lyfe is.
Nowe howe wretched and myserable the same lyfe is on euery behalfe the aun cient poetes semed to perceyue it passinge well: the whiche demed that a ma~ coude nat more truely nor more better name mortall creatures than surname them very miserable wretches.
For the fyrste age or formeste parte of mans lyfe (the whiche is rekened the best) is ignorant: The middell parte of the lyfe is assayled with trouble and care of manyfolde businessis: and yet all this while speake but of them that be moste luckye and fortunate.
Therfore who is he which of very ryghte wyll nat approue the sayenge of Silenus: the best is neuer to be borne the nexte is moste swyftly to be clene extincte? who wyll nat allowe the ordinaunce of the Thraciens the which customa bly vse to receyue them that be borne in to this worlde with lamentation and mournynge: and agayne whan they departe he~ce they be very glad and demeane great ioye? And he that by hym selfe considerethe inwardlye those thynges that Hegesias was wonte to declare to his herers he wolde rather desire his owne dethe than abhorre hit: and wolde farre more indifferently take in worthe the dethe of his frendes.
But nowe your fatherly sorowe co~methe forthe and saythe: He died er his day he dyed in his childehode he died so passyng a good childe yea and so towardlye disposed vnto vertue that he was worthye to haue lyued many many yeres: your fatherly forowe co~playneth that the course of Nature is subuerted seinge that you his father an olde man shulde ouer lyue your sonne a yonge man.
But prey you for the loue of god tell me what ye call before his day: as though euery day of a mans lyfe coude nat be his laste daye? One before he come in to this worlde and wha~ vnneth it hath any shappe of a creature reasonableÂ· is strangled and diethe euen vnder the handes of nature workynge and fourmynge of it.
An other crienge in the cradell is snatched awaye by dethe.
An other in the flowrig youth dieth whan scarsely as yet it hath any taste of the lyfe.
Of so many thousandes of people to how fewe is it gyue~ (as Horace nameth it) to steppe vp on the gryce of olde age? without doubte god hath vnder suche a lawe constituted the soule in the garrison of this littell body that what so euer day or what so euer moment he wyll commaunde it to departe thence it muste by by nedes go.
Nor there is none that can of ryghte thynke hym selfe to be called forthe before his day co~siderynge that there is no man that hath a day certayne to hym appoynted: but that only is his laufull day whiche so euer he our souerayne capitayne wolde shulde be his last day.
If we wyll worke wysely we shulde so abyde euery day as it were our very last.
prey you what maketh hit matter seinge the life is so shorte and fugitiue whether we dye betymes or tary some what longer.
For it skylleth no more tha~ it doth whan many be broughte to execution whiche of them shuld be fyrst heeded or ha~ged: It is all one whiche is the fyrste the thirde or the eight.
And what other thinge els is the lyfe it selfe but a certayne perpetuall course vnto dethe? Sauyng that their chance is more co~modious the which fro~ so laborious an exercise of the lyfe are dispatched be tymes.
But as it is a touche of a braynles felowe to departe away fro~ the army and breke the array without the capitaynes co~maundement: So hit is a foliss he poynte and great ingratitude whan leaue is quickelye gyuen of the capitayne nat gladly to take it: And most specially if he that hath now lice~ce to go may de{per}te his waye home with laude and preyse to hym no rebuke nor shame.
Nor it is nat co~uenient that one shulde sitte and reken howe many yeres he hath lyued.
The age shulde be estemed accordynge to the noble dedes: And he (as Homere sayth) is nat reputed to haue lyued that hath poystered the erthe and made a nombre: but he the whiche sad sobrely passynge forthe his lyfe leaueth behynde hym an honest reme~braunce to them that come after.
Do ye complayne that god sente you forthwith suche a childe as ye wolde desire to haue had many yeres to come? what pardie your so~ne died nat so soone he was nowe come to the age of .xx. yeres: at the whiche age (after myne opinion) it is best for to die for so moche as than lyfe is mooste swete.
Nowe was he to his countrey very bountifull nowe was he to his father very lowely and gentyll nowe was he amo~ge his felowes a very merye companion and nowe had he a good and a perfecte mynde to godwarde.
He decessed ignorant of vicis and whan he had nat tasted but littell of the calamities and miseries of this worlde.
But what be shulde haue knowen haue felte (if he had lyued longer) it is vncertayne.
No doubte we se very often tymes that the latter age dothe bothe infecte the clene conuersation of yonge age with more greuous vices and spottethe and defileth the felicitie of youthe with manyfolde myserable grefes.
From all these iuels and perils deth quickely withdrewe hym.
Nowe may you safe and surely reioyce and be glad that you haue had so good and so vertuous a sonne ye or rather haue.
But be it (as you do suppose) that you had hym and that nowe ye be depriued and haue loste hym. whether of very ryghte oughte you rather to tourment vexe your selfe for that ye haue forgone hym: or els reioyce and be gladde that ye hadde suche a sonne? Take you hede that it be nat a poynte of vnkyndnes that ye shulde remembre the requeste of the gyfte to be restored agayne and nothynge to mynde the gyfte.
No doubte a childe of a good disposition is a great gyfte: but yet is he so gyuen that ye shulde take and haue pleasure with hym for a tyme and nat that he shulde be yours for euer.
You that be a perfecte wyse man co~sider this by your selfe: yea let vs both to gether consider on this wyse.
If a great prince shulde lende vs a tabull of an excedyng great price and of an excellent workemanshyppe to passe our tyme with: whether ought we (whan so euer pleasethe hym to demaunde or call for it) with a glad chere ye and more ouer gentylly tha~kynge hym to delyuer it agayne or els with heuy and sorowfull countenance shall we complayne to hym on this wyse? cruell prince of howe precious a gyfte haste thou spoyled vs? Howe great a pleasure hast thou berafte and taken from vs? Howe sone hast thou taken from vs co~trary to our opinion this so excelle~t a thi~g.
Myght nat he of very ryghte to our so vnkynde complayntes answere on this wyse? Haue this rewarde for my gentyll and courtoys dede? Remembre ye nothynge saue only that that ye haue forgone the moste faire tabull? Haue ye forgotte that of myn owne good wyll and frelye lente it you? And that ye haue nowe so longe whyle (of my gentylnes and sufferaunce) fedde your eies and delited your mynde.
It was of my liberalite and fredome that le~te it you: and nowe whan require it agayne do but ryght: perdie ye haue had by me some aduauntage ye loste nothyng saue that throughe your foly ye femed that thing to be your owne that was but lente you.
And so ye esteme it to be loste that is restored to the owner againe.
But the more precious and delectable that the thynge was that lente and let you haue at your pleasure the more a great deale ye oughte to haue thanked me.
Nor ye oughte nat to thynke hit to be to sone required againe the which with out any iniurye or wronge myghte haue bene kepte from you.
If this reaso~ can nat be proued false by no meane of argumentation: tha~ thynke howe moche more iustly Nature (with suche maner word{is}) might reproue bothe our lamentation and sorowfull complaynynges.
And vndoubted by these maner of reasons our sorowe oughte to be swaged yea if it were so that a man were vtterly extincte by deth and there remayned nothynge of vs after the buriall.
Now if we at the leste gyue crede~ce to it wherof Socrates in Plato doubted nothynge at all that is to witte: the very man to be the soule this body to be nothynge els but the pipe or lyttell house of the soule: Or els to say trouthe it may be called the buriall or prison of the soule: and whan it escapeth out therof than at the laste it cometh to libertie to lyue moche more welthyly than it dyd be fore. wherfore than shuld we sorowfully blame deth seinge that he that dieth dothe nat perisshe but than he semethe rather to be borne.
And we ought to reioyce in the soule (whiche we can nat with our eies decerne) as moche and none other wyse than we be wont to reioyce and take pleasure in our frendes that bene absent.
And doubte whether is more delectable and reioysyng to vs whan they bene present or els whan they ben absent: for so moche as the corporall lyuyng to gether is wonte to mynyster to vs matter of displeasure and the moche beinge in company to gether dothe some what abate the ioyfulnesse of frendshyp.
If ye desyre an example of this thynge be nat the apostels a sufficient argument the whiche than began to take very fruition in Christ and truely to loue hym after the corporal presence was taken from them? On the same wyse is the fre~dshyppe of them that be good the whiche stedfastly perseuer in couplynge and knyttynge to gether of the myndes and nat of the bodies.
And there is no violence no space of tyme nor no distaunce of places that can seuer or diuide the couplyng of myndes.
So that me thynke hit a very childisshe poynt to thynke that a frende were clene lost and gone so sone as he were out of sighte.
You may (as ofte as ye wyll) haue your sonne presente both in your thoughte in your wordes: And he (on the other side) reme~breth you perceiueth the tender affectio~s of your mynde ye and other whyle in your slepe both your soules e~brace eche other talke to gether of some secrete thi~ges.
what thynge letteth that ye may nat euen very nowe imagin to lyue with hym with whom soone after ye are in poynte to lyue? pray you how briefe shorte is all the holle tyme that we lyue here? Hitherto haue vsed the remedies the whiche myghte well vse if had to do with a paynym.
Nowe let vs brieffely co~sider what godlynes christen faith ought to require of vs. Fyrst and formost if it were so that deth were a thynge moste miserable: yet it behoueth vs to take it in good worth seinge that ther is none other remedye.
And more ouer if dethe shulde clene extinguishe man that nothynge after shulde remayne: yet we shulde there with be contente for as moche as hit makethe an ende of many calamities and greffes whiche we suffre in this lyfe.
But seinge that dethe delyuereth the soule (beinge of etheriall begynnyng) out of the dongion of the ponderous beuy body: in a maner we oughte to reioyce and be gladde of them that be departed hence out of this wretched worlde: and that they be retourned home agayne to that welthye libertie from whe~ce they came.
Nowe than co~side ryng that deth (without any doubte) conueyeth the good deuoute soules out of the stormes of this troublous lyfe vnto the porte or hauen of lyfe perdurable and that nat so moche as a here of a mans heed shall perisshe (for the bodies also at length shalbe called to enioye the same lyfe euerlastyng.)
prey you whether ought we to mourne and wepe or els to be gladde and reioyce in hym whom dethe in due tyme taketh out of this moste troublous see of the lyfe and carieth hym in to that quiete sure restynge place of euerlastynge lyfe? Go to nowe a littell while and lay to gether the foule enormities the painful labours and the perils and daungers of this lyfe (if it may be called a lyfe.)
And on the other syde reken caste what co~modities and pleasures (of that other lyfe) are all redy prepared for the godly creatures that be plucked hence away: And than ye shall sone perceiue that no man can do more vnrightouslye than he the whiche lamentably bewayleth that high goodnes vnto the whiche only we be both borne and ordayned euen as thoughe it were a right great and greuous harme.
Ye crie out bicause ye be lefte comfortles alone without childre~ whan ye haue begotte a so~ne to inhabite heuen: the holy remembraunce of whom (as it were of a diuine thynge) ye maye reuerence the whiche aboue in beue~ beinge carefull for you may greatly forther the prosperous successe of your busines here.
For he is nother ignorant of mortall folkes busines nor hath nat forgone with the bodye the lowlye reuerence and tender loue whiche he was wo~te to bere to you his father.
No doubt he lyueth beleue me he lyueth and perauenture is present with vs and hereth and perceiueth this our communication and laugheth and damneth this our lame~tation.
And if the grossenes of our bodies letted nat {per}chance we shulde here hym blaming vs for our wepyng with these maner of wordes.
what do ye? wyll ye abridge your dayes and finishe your olde age with this vnprofitable ye may well say pyuisshe lamentation? wherfore do you with so vniuste com playntes accuse and blame destenyefortune and dethe? Haue you enuye at me bicause am delyuered from the yuels of that lyfe am brought to this felicitie that am in? But be hit that your fatherly goodnes and pure amitie dothe nat enuye me.
Yet what other thynge meaneth this sorowfull complaynyng? Thynke you this worthye to be lamented that am deducte and brought from thraldome to libertie from peyne and care to pleasure felicitie from darkenes vnto lighte from perill and daunger vnto sure saftie from deth vnto lyfe from sickenessis and disseases vnto im mortalitie from so many yuels to so high goodnes from thynges caduke and transitorie to the euerlastynge fro thinges erthly to celestiall and finally from the corrupte and vnclene company of all people to the felowshyp of angels? Tell me (I prey you) for the great loue and kyndnes that ye beare me If it laye in your power to releue me agayne wolde ye releue me? Than what offence haue done to deserue so great hatred of you? If ye wolde nat reliue me agayne than for what purpose seruen all these lame~tatio~s the which (as haue said) are nat only vnprofitable but also vn godly? But ne were it so that immortalite had a while agone clene depued me of all sorowe wolde lyke wyse with wepyng teares bewayle your so rowfull mourning sore haue rewed vpon thilke grosse darke cloudines of your mynde.
But ye say that you on your part wepe make lame~tatio~.
For soth therin ye do nat like louers: but like vnto the~ that haue a respecte to them selfewarde that wyll (to others disco~modite) se to their own bu sines.
Nowe go to tell me what losse is it that ye susteine by my deth? Is it bicause ye can nat haue me in your sight? Pardie ye may neuer the lasse at your owne pleasure remembre me the meane tyme ye and so moche the more welthyly in howe moche am in sure saftie.
For loke that ye esteme me nowe delyuered fro~ all the yuels what so euer they be that maye bechaunce a mortall man in his lyfe: of whiche your longe robustous lyfe (for a great parte) hath experience.
And though that be nat with you with lowly obeisa~ce to do you seruice yet may be a sure an effectuall aduocate for you before the high maiestie of god.
And finally howe small a thynge is hit that deuideth our conuersation familiaritie? Nowe loke that you so endeuour your selfe that whan ye haue well and vertuouslye passed the course of your lyfe that ye maye than at the houre of dethe be founde worthy to be co~ueyed hither.
If that your sonne (I saye) shulde saye these wordes to vs: myghte we nat well be ashamed thus to lament and mourne as we do? with these maner of reasons am wonte to ease the greffe of myn owne mynde: of the whiche wolde that you shulde be part taker nat all only that ye haue any great nede of those remedies: but demed it agreable that ye shulde be partaker of my co~solation of whose sorowe was partiner.
But briefly to conclude all that hath ben at length reasoned: by this maner meane ye shall aswage the smartynge sorowe of your mynde.
haue loste a great iewell: ye haue yelded hit agayne to hym that frelye gaue hit you.
It is a right greuous thing to be thus destitude: It shulde be the lighter borne that may be redressed by some mene.
what dothe it auayle to wepe and wayle for that that can nat be remedied? or why mourne you for that the whiche chaunceth to so manye thousandes as well as to you? Alas can nat chose but wepe for the deth of my sonne: ye but he that diethe well dothe in no wyse perysshe.
But he died to sone: He that diethe well diethe nat to sone.
He dyed longe before his daye was come: There is no man that hath a daye certayne appointed vnto hym.
He decessed in his flourynge youthe: It is than best to dye whan to lyue it is moste swete.
He died a very yonge man: So is he withdrawen from the mo yuels and troubuls of this lyfe.
haue loste the beste childe that any man coude haue: Be gladde that ye had suche one.
He departed out of this worlde an innoce~t: No deth shulde be more desired and lesse bewayled.
Ye but it is nat lefull for me the meane whyle to haue fruition with my sonne: Yes in your mynde you may: and within shorte space you and he to gether bodye and soule shall ioye and take pleasure.
If ye knowe any better remedies than these of gentylnes let me here them: if ye do nat than vse these with me.
And thus fare ye wel which your so~ne also wold ye shuld.

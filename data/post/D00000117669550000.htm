to the right worshipful and much honour'd robert coke esq now a member of the high and honourable court of parliament

sir

it is reported that when one presented unto antipater king of macedon a treatise of happiness that he rejected it with this answer undefined span alphabet am not at leasure you shall find this a treatise tending to happiness here and hereafter yet assure my self it shall find better entertainment when it kisseth your hand not only in regard of the novelty and usefulness of the design but also the author's good intention

as to the novelty thereof though confess to have met dispersedly with many gleanings in sundry authors yet the scattered ears were never heretofore so far as have searched collected into order the large field of this argument lying as a barren soyl or a desolate wilderness untilled

as to the usefulness since all goods may be reduced to bona animi corporis fortunae the goods of the mind the body and of fortune as divine providence hath liberally furnish'd you with the last this manual presents you with the two former
which three and tria sunt omnia rightly improv'd will add such a lustre each to other as will make you shine not only as a star of the first magnitude in the sphaere you are in now but as the sun it self hereafter when you shall be higher and richer

in the reversion of a celestial kingdom whereof your temporal estate thus sanctified made comfortable by the health of soul and body becomes an earnest
certes he is as happy as solomon in all his glory who hath health to enjoy his riches and grace to preserve his health and the hope of glory greater than that of solomon to remunerate his grace
riches without health is but like meat without a stomack which the best cook on earth cannot make relishing or grateful and health unless it relates to soul as well as body is but like a to a restless head which the best chamberlain cannot make easie enough or refreshing but when goodness shall run parallel with greatness and healthfulness with holiness they must needs concenter in the pole of happiness

as to the auhtor's good intention though be a stranger to your honored person yet receiving my first breath and part of my education within the sensible horizon of hill hall in holkham and having known for the space of more than three lives in the law the splendid family of your predecessors there and receiving from them mean the two last of them no small favors and obligations and not knowing how better to testify my gratitude to them than by expressing it to such a person as may be thought worthy in their room to inherit their praises with their vertues as well as their estate have therefore presumed to make this dedication of the of my labor such as it is humbly craving your patronage or pardon and also beseeching in my orisons that the almighty

preserver of men would preserver you and yours in health and prosperity both of body and soul together with length of days subordinately by the observation of such rules as are prescribed in this enchiridion and that he would bless you no less with accumulation of honors and fruitfulness of loyns that as your fortunes look green and flourishing so may your name also to the glory of god the service of your country the hope of your friends and the joy of every one who is no less devoted to your service than

sir your honorer

to the reader

to let pass threadbare apologie worn by so many authors in their epistles prefatory namely importunity of friends let it suffice that after had drawn up some scattered notions into a body for my private exercise and satisfaction the glory of god and the publick good were the grand motives that encouraged me to permit my divine physician to see the light and to travel abroad amongst his patients though he may chance to meet with as sharp censures as the bodily physician upon the miscarriage of his endeavours
confess a more accurate and acute pen might with more confidence have undertaken and better success accomplished the design of the following treatise but in regard no full discourse of this nature hath ever presented

it self to the author's cognizance it hath been my lot to undertake it and my endeavour by the natural and general desire of bodily health to promote the health of the soul and also by the health of the soul to promote the health of the body in which two points all the lines of our several designs must concenter or else the happiness of this life and also of the next will prove eccentrick and to lye beyond the sphaere of our reach
if then thou would'st vivere valere live and that in health and enjoy gaius his wished prosperity epist
john vers
take this advice eschew evil and do good shun vice and embrace vertue for as in the former are lurking the seeds of diseases and mortality so in the latter is contained such a spring of divine sap as bringeth forth the blossoms of health and the lasting fruit of long life
for it must be understood that as there is an agreement and correspondence between the affections of the soul and the temperature of the body and that

as naturally mores sequuntur humores the manners follow the crasis and complexion of the humours so the affections for their parts have great power and influence over the body and though their natures differ much one from another and we cannot by the reasons of humane philosophy comprehend how spiritual and corporeal beings are linck'd together and conjoyned in one yet experience and the effects demonstrate their joint influence and concurrence in the production either of health or diseases

therefore wee see that joy which is an affection of the soul is as it were a medicine to the body and food to the natural heat and moisture in which two qualities life chiefly consisteth and for this cause physicians frequently advise their patients to nourish that affection in them and to avoide the contrary namely sorrow and sadness which last being cold and dry and so hindering the circulation of the blood debilitating the animal and natural

vertues and obstructing the distribution of due nourishment becometh an enemy to life by the consequent consumption of the body

now upon this agreement and sympathy between the body and soul the current of this discourse mainly though not only proceedeth
in which you have the best and yet the cheapest physick that can be prescribed brought unto you not from the apothecaries shop but the treasury of the scriptures the closet of the holy ghost and all this not with a design of destroying the bodily physician's practise for when all is done there will be still need of him at one time or other but of assisting him by a more divine and expeditious method in his cures as well as preventing some unnecessary trouble and charge to the patient
and so conclude desiring thee to cover the imperfections and errata's of this work which may happen through the author's inadvertency

or the printer's negligence with the mantle of candour and charity and to take that in good part which is so well intended by

thy friend

to the ingenious author mr upon his divine physician
what in thy serious studies may we meet when even thy recreations are so sweet
thy book is grace and nature bound together take it which way you will it answers either so prettily so piously compact divinity and physick keep one act
strange treatise can reach down from my shelf consists of soul and body like my self thou shew'st thy self believ't in thy design a good physician and a good divine
and that physician to the mark comes close that cures both soul and body with a dose
go on and prosper fourth and fifth edition till john like luke be the belov'd physician



the author to his book
go little book and try thy fortune where more good thou may'st for least thou can'st do here whil'st to a private shelf thou art confin'd thou as to publick good art still behind then venture forth and freely shew thy skill in curing such as shall thy rules fulfil
would have sent thee in a better dress before thou should'st have tumbled into press but want of time and hast pon life and death may plead for thee when thou art out of breath
howe're termed fool or a physician as suits best with carpers disposition yet let thou momus know a fool in print may sometime give to wiser men a hint how dextrously to finish and compleat what e're in ruder draught is not so feat and to accomplish what in thee's design'd in brief a body sound with a sound mind

the divine physician

the first part

demonstrating by natural reason and also divine and humane testimony that vitious and irregular actions and affections do prove often occasions of most bodily diseases and shortness of life

the introduction
because method is mater memoriae the mother of memory and words must be placed as at a feast and not as at an ordinary in this respect shall observe some order in the following tract

first then let us consider the excellencies

and commodities of health and long life that so by their encomiums we may be drawn and encouraged to follow after the best means in order to the attainment or enjoyment of them

health then in the first place is the greatest bodily blessing which god bestoweth upon any in this life though in regard of its commonness it be little regarded
the benefit of this most sweet sause of all other goods is scarcely discerned by them that enjoy it till sickness come for then not only orpheus his song but much more our own experience teacheth us that nothing is available to men without health neither riches nor honour nor the greatest delights which solomon walk can afford
yea life it self which is so precious that skin for skin yea all that a man hath will he give for it job

as sathan answered the lord even that becomes uncomfortable without health
besides health is a special furtherance help to us in the service of god and in the performance of the duties of our callings the want of it a great obstruction impediment to us therein
for these reasons

the beloved apostle did earnestly wish his gaius prosperity and health
beloved wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health ep john

this is that blessing which the lord promiseth to the obedient
the lord will take away from thee all sickness that blessing which the apostle paul thought worthy to be preserved carefully as appeareth acts

likewise tim


in a word that blessing whose sweetness is so well experimented and relished after the bitterness of sickness that it were but to light a candle before the sun to bring forth any further testimony in the praise of it

secondly long life may be accounted as another blessing which by its magnetick and attractive vertue may not only draw our affections as a but also by its acuminating power set an edge upon our endeavours as a whetstone
long life is a blessing he that shall account it less doth not only forget his own natural desires but also god himself and his commandment which promiseth length of dayes as a reward of dutifulness to parents natural

civil or ecclesiastical
it was a blessing of god upon israel that being in the wilderness forty years their garments did not wear as the garment of the gibeonites so if in many years some mens bodies which are as the garmentss of the souls hold out longer than other mens as though with the eagle he did renew their youth and god did add certain years unto their dayes as he did unto hezekiah isa

this is a great blessing for though we christians as the lord verulam saith in his epistle of the history of life and death do continually aspire and pant after the land of promise yet it will be a token of god's favour towards us in our journeyings thorow this worlds wilderness to have our shoes and garments mean those of our frail bodies little worn or impaired
surely as it is a curse upon the wicked not to live out half his dayes psal

a plague upon the ungodly that they die in their youth job

a punishment upon eli and his sons for their sins that there should not be an old man in his house for ever but all the increase of his house should die in the slower of their

age sam


so on the other side it is god's blessing if he increase the length of our dayes and we die with job being old and full of dayes and go in our grave in a full age as a shock of corn cometh in in his season to the barn job



therefore that heathen cic tusc
was mistaken who said optimum est non nasci proximum quam cito aboleri the best thing is never to be born and the second best to die assoon as we are born
for though long life to some be as wearisome as death is fearful though old age in many be a disease not curable but by death yet these are but accidental life it self is a blessing and the longer we live the more experience we have of god's favour a greater loathing of the sins of our youth and a larger time of repentance as having space wherein to grow wiser and better and thereby to make this life a large preparative to eternal life

health then and long life being now considered as blessings we will henceforth follow the means and leave the blessing to god

chap

the first means being to avoid sin in general which is supernaturally an occasion of bodily diseases and shortness of life

diseases are the interests of sin till sin there were no such things for this cause in general many are weak and sick let a man take the best air he can and eat the best food he can let him eat and drink by rule let him take never so many antidotes preservatives and cordials yet man by reason of sin is but a crazy sickly thing for all this
for as one saith all sicknesses of the body proceed from the sin of the

soul am not ignorant that the lethargy ariseth from the coldness of the brain that the dropsie floweth from waterish blood in an ill affected liver that the spleen is caused from melancholly wind gathered in the but the cause of all these causes the fountain of

all these fountains is the sin of the soul

and this truth from the fountain of sacred writ will be clearly derived unto us our saviour said unto the man that had been years diseased behold thou art made whole sin no more lest a worse thing come unto thee john

jesus thus warning him by shewing him the cause of his infirmity which was sin
those physicians that derive all diseases from natural causes only do not well understand that text for it is spiritually discerned

all sickness is certainly the fruit of sin and many physicians will acknowledge it being induced thereunto by a consequence from an instance of a particular though epidemical disease namely the plague or pestilence which is concluded not only from the word of god lev

but also from the confirmed constant and received opinion of all ages to be flagellum dei pro peccatis mundi the rod of god for the sins of the world the word plague in the greek undefined span alphabet signifying no less for tis so furious a disease as it disdains any

general method of cure when it is in its rage
so that we must needs conclude that whatever be the natural causes of diseases sin is the supernatural and meritorious cause not only of this but also of all other diseases
let me instance but one particular disease more the palsy when our saviour was about to cure a man sick of that disease mark

he first pronounced forgiveness of sins to him to shew that his sins were the cause of his disease
confess diseases in the godly are many times god's love tokens and he doth not alwayes aim at the demonstrating of his justice in punishing sin when he layeth sickness upon men for sometimes he layeth it upon his own children for other ends as for the trial of their faith and patience as we see in job example yet it is true that god doth not chastise or punish those that are innocent but such as deserve it by their sins otherwise he should be supposed as unjust
sin then the spiritual disease is the original and procuring cause of every natural disease so as if there were no sin there should be no sickness

but here peradventure some may object and say how do this appear experimentally and exemplarily in some vicious persons whose blood danceth in their veines and whose bones are moistned with marrow who are in health when he whom christ loveth is sick john

as twas said of lazarus to this answer that the like matter bad almost stifled and amazed job job
and asaph psal
but they soon understood a reason of the several dispensations of god's providence
one general reason might be this it may well stand with god's providence as he is the father of mercies and the god of justice as he shall see cause to let both his mercy and his justice meet together both upon the wicked and the godly
as for instance many times he conferreth benefits upon the wicked and suffereth them to go free from punishment there is his mercy though short and temporal but the evil that is in them he punisheth eternally there is his justice
again many times he punisheth the sins of his best servants with

temporal afflictions but their goodness he rewardeth with eternal blessings there is his justice in punishing temporally his mercy in rewarding eternally and in both these the wisdom of god's providence is discovered
so more particularly god doth sometime permit the wicked to have a sound body with a diseased soul and the godly a diseased body with a more sound soul
but yet for the most part in the revolution of experience we shall find that where sin reignes most there most diseases as are attending upon her and though every general rule in grammar hath its exception yet take this as general without exception that original and likewise actual sins are the seeds of bodily diseases though by gods mercy and providence all things even the sharpest work together for good to them that love god rom


yea sin is not only a spiritual or supernatural cause of bodily diseases but also of shortness of life
for as one saith through sin our bodies are become nothing

but the of diseases and death
sin hath corrupted mans blood and rendered his body mortal and vile before sin our bodies were immortal for death and mortality came in by sin but now alas they must return to dust and tis appointed to all men once to die by statute law in heaven and tis well if they die but once and the second death hath no power over them they must see corruption and this is the wages that sin allows to its servants for the wages of sin is death rom

this is the largess or congiary that sin gives to its souldiers viz death of all sorts this is the just hire of the least sin and this hire is seldom long detained from them that have deserv'd it most

as the lord for the wickedness of the world reduced man's age from almost a thousand to an hundred and twenty years gen

and afterward from that to moses his arithmetick three score years and ten psal

so now for the same cause he hath reduced it to a very little pittance not only to
but to
for in law

no man's life is valued more so that the life of man is but a span and the weavers shuttle is no more swift than it is job

especially when many vices are woven into it for then god's justice soon cuts it off as a weaver cuts off his web from the loom sometimes before it be finished for every disorderly person that hath shortned his dayes by his sins may say as hezekiah did once have cut off like a weaver my life isai

as some expositors render it have shortned my life by my sins
thus er and onan in the
chap of genesis by their sins contracted their lives into the wicked man's abridgment viz into less than the moyety not living out half their dayes
yea so unquestio able is this truth that it was taken for granted in job dayes as appeareth by job interrogation how oft is the candle of the wicked putout and how oft cometh their destruction upon them job


what pleasure hath he in his house after him when the number of his moneths is cut off in the mid
and in solomon dayes it became a proverb the years of

the wicked shall be shortned prov


a truth that is exemplified in most of the wicked kings of judah and of israel
first the kings of judah abijam a wicked king reigned but three years kings

jehoram of whom it is recorded that he did evil in the sight of the lord he reigned but twelve years four with his father and eight alone kings

ahaziah a wicked king reigned but one year kings

athaliah a wicked queen an usurper she reigned but six years kings

ahaz a wicked king reigned but unto the
year of his age kings

amon a wicked king reigned but two years and lived but kings

to be short several others of the same line are chronicled with short periods sin and a sudden death reigning in them successively
secondly we may instance in the kings of israel

nadab the son of jeroboam a wicked

king reigned but two years kings


baasha indeed reigned years but elah his son reigned but two years being slain in his drunken humour by his servant zimri kings

zimri a conspirator reigned but seven dayes for burning the king's house over him with fire he died
now the cause is recorded twas for his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of the lord in walking in the way of jeroboam and in his sin which he did to make israel to sin kings
to
omri a superlative sinner reigned but twelve years kin


ahaziah the son of ahab was an idolatrous king and reigned but two years kings

he being sick sent messengers to enquire of the god of ekron whether he should recover of his disease but had his judgment by elijah who said thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up but shalt surely die which came to pass according

to the word of the lord which elijah had spoken kings
and now what shall more say for the time would fail me to tell of jehoram zachariah shallum menahem pekahiah pekah and some others who through sin lost their lives with their kingdoms being cut off by the hand of god's vengeance either before or in their middle age and although some of the wicked kings of judah and of israel did reign many years by the permission of a long suffering god yet the instances are so few that they are much overballanced by the short lives of those already mentioned

much also of this truth might be observed in the short periods of the wicked reigns of sundry princes not only of this but of other nations but thus much shall serve to have delineated and demonstrated sin to be in general a spiritual or moral cause of bodily diseases and shortness of life supernaturally effected

chap
ii

shewing that many sins are natural causes of bodily distempers and shortness of life

most sins are sins of the flesh which are so named because through our flesh to wit our seed or through carnal generation sin is conveyed into the whole man soul and body also for that the flesh or body is the instrument to execute the lusts of our natural concupiscence rom

thus piscator and peter martyr do judge
now these fleshly lusts we must understand have a powerful influence and operation in the production of fleshly or bodily diseases and this will appear by an examination of the numerous of excess and intemperance which in many places of sacred writs is deemed no less than the transgression of the bounds of god's law
now the or fruits of intemperance are these

first it brings upon us almost all diseases

secondly it takes part with diseases and makes them often incurable

thirdly it shortens our dayes and makes us die in agonies
from whence cometh soreness and weariness melancholy and heaviness of spirits stiffness and pain of joints belchings crudities feavers distastings of meat loss of appetite and other tempestuous evils but from excess and intemperance these experimental effects who can deny since almost every man carries about him and within him a convincing argument thereof
whence is the multitude of physicians saith a modern physician but from the

frequency and multitude of diseases and whence that frequency and multitude but from excess this saith he is generally confessed but the practise still continued the understanding assents but the affections
now intemperance in general may be thus described it is an inordinate and immoderate appetite or desire in our affections pleasures gifts

and the use of the creatures more particularly it is taken for an inordinate appetite and immoderate desire and use of meat and drink and this is when a due mean is exceeded in the too liberal and excessive use of them so that gluttony and drunkenness are the two main supporters of intemperance which is the mother of most diseases
democritus said that intemperate men were valetudinis suae proditores betrayers of their own health and killers of themselves by their pleasures he spake it of intemperance in eating and drinking of which and also of other sorts of intemperance shall further treat in the following sections

sect
of gluttony

this is such a sin as christ gives us a strict caution against it take heed to your selves lest at any time your hearts be with surfeiting
and as it is a sin so a fruitful in the production of other sins deut
yea

fruitful also in diseases of the body
the stoicks imputed all diseases to age but erasistratus did not ill to ascribe all or most of them to excess in eating for if a man feed too much as a physician saith these discommodities arise thereof all natural spirits leave their several standings and run headlong to the stomack to perfit concoction which if with all their forces they cannot perform then brain and body are with heavy vapours and humours so that he is ever under the arrest of some disease or in danger of it
multos morbos fercula multa faciunt many dishes bring or cause many diseases it was the observation of temperate seneca and it is not without reason for physicians do affirm that crudities the fruits of repletion are the nurseries of all those diseases wherewith men are ordinarily vexed
now that which we call crudities is the imperfect concoction of food for when the stomack either through the excess of meat or for the variety taken at one meal or some other evil quality doth imperfectly digest what it hath received the juice of

the meat so taken is said to be crude that is to say raw or to have a cruditie in it which is the occasion of many inconveniences

for in the first place they do fill the brain with many phlegmatick excrements and overheat the bowels whereupon many obstructions are bred in the narrow passages of them moreover these cruduties do corrupt the temper of the whole body and stuff the veins with putrid humours from whence proceed many grievous diseases for when the first chylus is crude and what we eat is malignantly concocted it is impossible to speak as to the less modern opinion that any good blood can be bred in the second chylus of the liver for the second concoction can never amend the first
again these crudities are the cause that the veins through the whole body are replenished with foul and with impure blood and mingled with many humour which do break forth into desperate diseases
and this may be more fully seen if we shall make make an inspection into a treatise of

doctor charlton exercitationes pathologicae
wherein we may observe how and after what manner food becomes the cause or matter of diseases
or if a sum of what he more largely deliberates upon may be satisfactory take it thus from an ingurgitation of food beyond the strength of nature ariseth a repletion from a repletion flow a plethora or an exuperance of good humours and when these by a continual motion have increased to corruption and putrifaction there soon follows a cachochymia or a redundance of ill humours and out of these two spring a most fruitful field of diseases
hence arise feavers inflammations tumours swellings irruption of the vessels bleeding at the nose apoplexies cathexy or ill disposition of the body when the nourishment is converted to ill humours scabiness leprosie and innumerable other diseases for saith he
quid mali precor est quod corrupto sanguine non expectes ac time as what evil distemper pray is there but may be both expected and feared to arise from a corrupt blood thus you see gluttony is a nurse to innumerable diseases

but this is not all it is a to innumerable persons according to the proverb intemperance is a destroying man's life frequently and suddenly according to that known saying by suppers and surfeits more have been killed than galen ever cured
yea by surfeiting have many perished as saith the son of sirach eccl

thus gluttons dig their graves with their teeth whil'st their kitchin is their shrine their cook their priest their table their altar and their belly their god
hence also it is said that meat kills as many as the musket and that pluaes pereunt crapulâ quam capulo lantibus quam lanteis the board kills more than the sword
have read that the spartans to deter others from luxurious feeding erected statues to represent the fatal and fearsul end of those that were given to riot
what schollar hath not read in herodotus of the minstrel of megara whose girdle in the wast was three yards and a half long or of milo crotoniates that great pamphagus athen

yet they died both very weak men and young by

oppressing nature
history records of the scots that they punished

their in this sort first they filled their bellies as full of good meat as ever they could hold then they gagged them and threw them into the next river with their arms pinnion'd saying now as thou hast eaten too much so drink too much
but they should not have needed to punish them by such an artificial destruction for had they waited with a little patience they might have observed this sin to be its own natural punishment destroying more frequently and more generally than any other means for life as one saith is a lamp excess in meat doth shorten the one as too much oyl extinguisheth the other
the glutton then turning that into an occasion of death which was given for preservation of life seldom or never lives long but as he is hateful unto god in idolizing his belly so he is hurtful to himself as a felo de se in hastning his own death

now if any should here require some rules of temperance in eating whereby

they may know how to limit themselves within due bounds that so they may not run out upon the borders of intemperance must suspend that enquiry with its full determination until shall have positively treated of temperance in general only thus much may be inserted here which doctor muffet a famous physician hath written in his book of health's improvement
fools and idiots saith he know you when your horse and your hawk and your dog have enough and are you ignorant what measure to allow your selves who will urge his horse to eat too much or cram his hawk till she be or feed his hound till his tail leave waving and shall man the measurer of heaven and earth be ignorant how in diet to measure the bigness or strength of his own stomack knows he by signs when they are and is he ignorant of the signs of repletion in himself namely of satiety loathing drowsiness stiffness weakness weariness heaviness and belching but we will pass over this and treat of the other branch of intemperance which follows

sect
ii
of drunkenness
that this is a sin and that of no mean degree we may plainly perceive by sundry texts of sacred writ luke

gal


eph

but most especially and most notably in that fearful commination cor

where we are informed that drunkards shall not inherit the kingdom of god
and yet something they shall inherit namely diseases not a few contracted upon them partly perhaps from their parents voluptuousness but chiefly and most certainly from their own habituated disorders
drunkenness saith one dolores gignit in capite in stomacho in toto corpore acerrimos breeds grievous diseases in the head in the stomack and in the whole body

now by drunkenness we must understand all excess in drinking with its degrees as it is taken in scripture phrase for overcoming of or being overcome with strong drink isai

jer

which tend to the alienation of the mind dulling

or clouding of the understanding inflaming the blood and confounding of health
in these and the like respects solomon makes this interrogation who hath wo who hath sorrow who hath babling who hath wounds without cause who hath redness of eyes prov

and tis answered in the following verse they that tarry long at the wine they that go to seek mixt wine

more fully we may consider the effects of drunkenness as they are described by physicians to whose learning and experience we owe no small honour and credence
and they are resolution of the nerves cramps and palsies
inflation of the belly and dropsies redness and rheums in the eyes tremblings in the hands and joynts inclination to feavers and the scurvy sicknesses at stomack and sower belchings
pains of the head and teeth crudities in the stomack and weakness of the stomack

pain in the eyes or dimness of sight trembling of the heart weakness of the liver

distillations the cough a corrupt breath tumours gouts
these and many more are the bitter fruits that grow upon that unhappy tree

and as this vice produceth almost innumerable diseases and distempers so consequently it shorteneth life
the cup kills as many as the canon and therefore those srothie companions that pretend such kindness in a too free and frequent drinking their friends health do prove miserably unkind to their own bodies as well as souls while they drink themselves out of health and life in the conclusion
for this cause drunkenness is said to oppress nature and hasten death by consuming the natural moysture and also by its superfluous moysture drowning the natural heat and thence it is that willows and such like whose natural place is the rivers side and whose natural property is as it were to be alwayes drinking are of short continuance
hence it is that this vice by matrobius is called cita senectus a sudden old age because they that are often drunk soon grow old

or if some will say it is a preventer of old age it must be in its cutting men off before they can attain to it

instances for the illustration of this truth are not few in history
alexander the great in the flower of his age drunk himself to death and killed more by excessive drinking to get that crown of one hundred and eighty pounds weight which he had provided for him that drank most plutarch
erasinus for the same cause hath called eccius jeccius for as he lived a shameful drunkard so being at ratisbon by melancthon he drank more than was fit that night at the bishop of mundina lodgings who had store of the best italian wines and so fell into a feaver whereof he died jo
man
com pag
the same author jo
manlius tells us of three abominable drunkards who drank so long till one of them fell down stark dead and the other two escaped not altogether free from distempers

a modern author in his book entitl'd

the mirrour of examples setteth down two or three remarkable stories to our present purpose

at a tavern in certain gentlemen drinking healths to the lords on whom they had dependance one of them with an oath drinks off a pottle of sack to his lord after which he could neither rise up nor speak but falling into a sleep dyed within two hours after
at a place near mauldon five or six appointed a drinking match laying in beer for the purpose drank healths in a strange manner whereof all of them died within a few weeks after
also at the plough in barnwel near cambridge a lusty young man with two of his neighbours and one woman in their company agreed to drink up a barrel of strong beer which accordingly they did but within hours three of them died and the fourth hardly escaped after great danger and sickness

now the events of these men's lives and their untimely ends are not to be accounted so much accidental as natural effects

occasioned by their foul enormities and frequently attested by the experience of every age though not prevalent enough with the sensual and stupified drunkard whom austin brings in saying malle se vitam quam vinum eripi he had rather lose his life than his liquor but did men seriously while they are sober consider how injurious this sin is to the health of body and soul how it shormeth men's lives lengthneth their punishment here and aggravates it hereafter how it fills men brimful with diseases spiritual and corporal they should methinks respect their welfare better than to buy so small a pleasure at so dear a rate

but in respect of bodily some may object that avicenna rhasis and averrhoes advise the use of wine usque ad ebrietatem even to drunkenness pretending it to be physical as it is a vomitory to evacuate these ill humours in the head and stomack which are the causes of most diseases and that seneca indulgeth thus far sen de tranquill

nonnunquan ad ebrietatem veniendum non ut

mergat nos sed ut deprimat
eluit enim curas ab imo animum movet ut morbis quibusdam ita tristititiae medetur now then we may drink more liberally even unto drunkenness its self not to overwhelm our parts but only to depress them a while
for it washeth away cares exhilarates the mind and as it cureth certain diseases so likewise sadness

to which this answer may be returned that herein many men foolishly erre esteeming the cause of a hundred sicknesses to be the medicine of one and the poison of the soul to be good physick for the body no good bodily phisician will prescribe it no spiritual physician will allow it
cum turpis est medicina sanari pudeat when the medicine is so filthy and odious let us be ashamed to make use of it
when it is so sinful let us be afraid to make trial whether the destruction of the soul be the preservation of the body
let us not do evil that good may come rom

much less when nothing but evil comes from thence as may be still made to appear in this vice in respect of bodily distempers
for drunkenness is so far from conferring any thing

towards bodily health that it rather produceth sickness even by that which amongst some sottish physicians is pretended as a cause of health namely vomiting which is a symptome of sickness and also sometimes a cause of dangerous distempers when it succeedeth a nauseous the stomack with drink so that whatever be the effects of an evacuation by other kind of vomits this by drunkenness is often a cause of many distempers seldom or never a cure of any unless it be of the present sickness of stomack which this vice first caused but how many other distempers and diseases doth it cause which it never cures so that you see drunkenness is a certain cause of many diseases and of shortness of life but seldom a cure unless it be by accident of any

these and many more being the effects of that detestable sin when it meets with that detestable disease the venereal pox which by god's just judgment hath assailed mankind not only in france but in most parts of the world as a scourge or punishment to restrain the too wanton and lascivious lusts of impure persons causing them to receive in themselves that recompence of their errour which was meet as it is in the apostle's phrase rom

though in a different sense
to this purpose mr john abrenethy in his pious and ingenious treatise of physick for the soul thus writeth

this burning lust spendeth the spirits and balsom of life as the flame doth wast the candle whereupon

followeth corruption of humours rotting of the marrow the joints ache the nerves are resolved the head is pained the gout increaseth and as a most just punishment there insueth that miserable scourge of harlots the french pox

also carnal love or fleshly lust in young inamoratoes whose affections are stronger than their reason is a branch of wantonness that is fruitful in the production of such diseases and distempers as do extreamly afflict and weaken the persons captivated as may appear in that example of amnon who was sick with love sam



as the cause with a consumption as the effect being lean from day to day by reason of his fair sister whom he loved
and hence it is that in such persons the heat abandons the parts and retiring into the brain leaves the whole body in great distemperature which corrupting consuming the blood makes the face grow pale and wan causeth the trembling of the heart breeds strange convulsions and retires the spirits

in such sort that they seem rather images of death than living creatures who are possessed with it
now for further illustration of this matter and to revive the mind of the reader shall briefly and compendiously recite these two instances
the first is of king perdiccas whom hippocrates observing and finding him to be in a chronical sickness which made his body to languish exceedingly after long inquiry perceived his pining away to flow from a spiritual disease for the love he had to phila his fathers concubine saran in vita perdic

the other is of antiochus son of king seleucus who burning with an unspeakeable desire and lust for stratonice his stepmother and being mindful what dishonest fires he carried in his breast concealed his inward wound and smothered the flame so long till it reduced his body to the uttermost degree of a consumption and thus lying in his bed like a dying man his father was presently cast down with grief as thinking onely of the death of his only son and his own miserable condition in being made childless plutarch

now how these two perdiccas and antiochus were cured of their languishing distempers is inconsistent with my present purpose to declare

also sodomy polygamy and are sins of uncleanness that by transgressing the rules of temperance do prove frequently occasions of many distempers
yea likewise the immoderate and unseasonable use of the marriage bed which is a breach of some divine precepts thes

lev

is too fruitful in diseases not only in respect of those derived to posterity but also of those propagated on the parents themselves
for according to the judgment of laevinus lemnius and other learned physicians it can hardly be expressed what contagîon and mischief comes thereupon when such immodest and impure conjunctions are indulged for where the right ends of marriage are not observed there persons of both sex at last pay dearly for their unruly lust when their bodies are tormented with the leprosie or pox gouts aches or other distemperatures and

therefore one adviseth that in the private acquaintance and use of marriage there be a seasonable restraint with a moderation that so the pleasure therein be with some regard to the rules of health and long life to both which those sins of wantonness and uncleanness are foul enemies

moreover these sins do shorten and contract life for those that are defiled and corrupted by them do very much sin against their own bodies wasting their strength in pleasure as the flame consumeth the candle and therefore are like sparrows which aristotle saith do therefore live but a short time because of their insatiable copulation
and read that the romans were wont to have their funerals at the gates of venus temple plut to signifie that lust was the harbinger and hastener of death
yea the wisest of meer men doth in his proverbs teach us the praedatory and destructive power of all uncleanness in these words and thou mourn at the last when thy flesh and thy body are consumed prov

it is a fire saith

job that consumeth to destruction job

the lord verulam in his history of life and death
makes this observation that the goat lives to the same age with the sheep which is seldom to ten years and though he be a creature more nimble and of somewhat a firmer flesh and so should be longer liv'd yet because he is much more lascivious that shortens his life
how many examples of goatish men could extract out of history but being confined to brevity must hasten to answer an objection and it is this some diseases are cured by incontinency and venereal evacuations as anorexia viz queasiness of stomack hysterical fits or suffocation of the womb spermatick feavers most vehement pains of the head priapismus satyriasis furor uterinus diseases felt and understood by such unmarried persons whose blood is in its meridian and as by this means such diseases are sometimes cured so consequently life is prolonged
to which may return a threefold answer like a threefold cord which is not quickly broken eccles



first let all be supposed which is here objected yet surely it is but an ill method to cure the body by destroying the soul or to endeavour the prolonging the natural life by shortning of the spiritual the life of grace
we must not as said before in respect of drunkenness do evil that good may come no necessity of health or life ought to persuade hereunto
ludovicus a king of france undertaking a long pilgrimage and his queen not being with him his health began to impair which his physicians observing and knowing the reason of it perswaded him in the absence of the queen to take unto him another woman because his health safety required it which he did utterly refuse protesting he had rather die then have his liie preserved by such an ungodly means

secondly let the objection still be enforced yet there is no necessity to make use of an unlawful cure when there is a lawful one provided for every one that will in that excellent and divine institution of marriage which as it is intended a good prevention of all lustful and

unlawful burnings cor

so by a more warrantable course it hath probably effected some natural cures upon the bodies of some and also by confining the senses to one particular object far less exhausted the spirits and so consequently seldomer occasioned diseases than a licentious indulgence and extravagant and insatiable luxury hath done

but because all this doth not directly meet the objection or fully correspond to the design of my present undertaking therefore in the last place would answer more pertinently that if any of the diseases have been cured or prevented by such unlawful evacuations verily believe as ill or worse have been introduced and nestled into their room or in stead of them so that still the stream runneth clear from the fountain viz that sin more particularly the sin of incontinency and uncleanness is a cause of diseases and consequently of shortness of life as have sufficiently demonstrated unto any whose reason doth not too much truckle under sense

to learn prudent industry and diligence

could shew you how the

sins do frustrate the end of our creation become the sinks of all mischief and evil and so odious and detestable that the very devils in hell are not guilty of them but my design is onely to point out sin briefly and then more largely to prove it to be an occasion of bodily diseases and shortness of life
and of all sins idleness sloth and sluggishness are not the least occasion being the sediment and collection of excremental superfluities for as standing waters soonest putrifie so do the humours of the body in stagno the pool of idleness
the lacedemonians would suffer none of their subjects to spend their time in sports or idleness and when their magistrates were told of some that used to walk abroad in the afternoons they sent to them requiring that leaving their idleness they should betake themselves to honest labours and imployments for say they it becomes the lacedemonians to procure health to their bodies by labour and exercise not to corrupt them by sloth and idleness

idleness saith a modern author not

only stupifieth the mind but also groweth upon the body and blood and betrayeth them to discomplexion sickness and to many infirmities
yea search the physicians library and observe their conclusions upon the six more particularly upon motion and rest and you may find the discommodities of this sin namely crudities obstructions and a multiplication of excrementitious humours and so consequently a languishing loose slabby infirm body
hence it is that such persons corrupted with this vice are unavoidably in continual physick have need of issues and other artificial helps for the evacuation and exiccation of those superfluous moistures contracted upon them by a sedentary and slothful life but especially those women who have passed their youth undisciplin'd and have been bred up in such a delicacy that they know no other business but their pleasures say those find sensibly the pernicious effects of an idle life in those diseases it particularly disposeth them too as obstructions of the liver spleen womb and breast and

in that grievous inconvenience it produteth viz
long travail difficulty and danger in childing as might easily be confirmed by reason but that probably a great part of this sex is sooner convinced by an argument drawn from sence and their own dear experience which is most commonly the mistress of fools

might add hereunto that they which sedentary lives bear weak and sickly children and also demonstrate such vvomen to be injurious not only to themselves but also their posterity
but must hasten to shew you another natural effect of idleness even in both sexes and that is a disease which is the leaven of diseases viz melancholly which proceedeth ofttimes from this vice and excremental superfluities gathered together in the body for no greater cause of melancholly than idleness as democritus jun in his treatise of that subject doth largely shew in place thereof and most compendiously conclude in another viz the epilogue this prescription as an antidote against that disease be not idle be not solitary burton's melancholy

moreover there are many other disease that are the excrescences of this sin but let it suffice in general terms to denote it as a main occasion of bodily distempers brooding and hatching them by a sedentary life so true is that of the poet ovid

corrumpunt otia corpus
idelness corrupts wastes and destroys the body
and the learned galen saith as much otium reddit imbecillas vires membrorum com

also in another place otium liquefacit com

eped
and also nature's great explorator lord verulam in his history of life and death doth denote unto us that an idle life doth manifestly make the flesh soft and dissipable and so consequently an enemy to long life

sluggishness is likewise much of the same nature and property bringing many from the couch to the bed of sickness and from the bed to the coffin
for if the old rule be true diluculo surgere saluberrimum est to arise betimes in the morning

be the most wholesom thing in the world then surely regulâ contrariorum by the rule of contraries to play the sluggard and to exceed that convenient measure of rest which nature alloweth must be if not the most unwholesom thing in the world yet one of the most
and this will appear if we consider the inconveniences of immoderate sleep as they are described by physicians

first in that the heat being thereby called into the body it consumes the superfluous moistures and then the necessary and lastly the solid parts themselves and so extenuates dries and emaciates the body
and secondly it fixes the spirits and makes them stupid it hardens the excrements and makes the body costive from whence follow many inconveniences

lastly the brain being therby filled with vapours the is caused the natural motions of the humours are hindred and stopped crude phlegmatick juices and all manner of superfluous humours are heaped up and increased whence

flows a notable spring of distillations and such like cold and long continuing diseases

by too much sleep the strength is suffocated concoction diminished perspiration hindred the head and bowels hurt sanctor and cole new art of physick
but must not forget my intended brevity

sect
of immoderate anger
anger when it is immoderate becomes sinful when the sun goeth down upon it soon becomes a work of darkness and therefore the apostle after a concession be angry addeth a restriction and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath eph

in which restriction sinful and remaining anger are connexed and prohibited

now as this remaining or immoderate anger is sinful so it is unhealthful for the incommodities thereof are many

and evil as feavers phrensies and madness trembling palsies apoplexies decay of appetite and want of rest paleness collicks plurisies inflammations cholerick caeliack and iliack passions
so that not without cause was the saying of eliphaz wrath killeth the foolish man job

and to this purpose shall infer what find recorded in humane story
the emperour nerva ended his life in a feaver contracted by anger
the emperour valentinian died by an irruption of blood through anger cuspianus chromerus
vinceslaus king of bohemia raging against his fell presently into a palsie whereof he died
also sylla who in his anger had spilt the blood of many at last in his fury raging and crying out against one that had broken promise with him thereby brake a veine within him vomiting out his blood soul and anger together valer
maxim
and ajax through anger fell into a deadly fury

now from these instances we may conclude the truth of that sentence in

eccl

shortens the life and also of that old medicinal rule in schold salerni

si vis incolumem si te vis reddere crede profanum
if thou wilt live in health and free from sickness bane then think thou choler in excess to be prophane

we may add hereunto that anger in excess inflameth the blood and increaseth choler which is for the most part the cause of that acute and dangerous disease cholerica passio or choler which as the physicians write is often so sharp and vehement that it doth deprive a man of life within the space of a day or two even without a feaver

moreover it is observed that children most fretful are usually and that anger if it be inveterate causeth the natural spirit to feed upon the juyces of the body which must consequently

produce consumptions and abbreviate life

of envie hatred and malice
amongst many other these as the apostle saith gal


are works of the flesh
envie is cousen german to hatred and malice and so they are all three upon the account of a base and ignoble race for the devil is their father and concupiscence their mother
they are in the judgment of the holy ghost no less than mental murder for whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer ep john

now saith christ the devil is the father of murderers john


as then we may conclude envie hatred and malice to be mortal sins to the soul so shall prove them to be mortal and destructive to the body
envie saith the lord verulam in the history of life and death is the worst of all passions and feedeth upon the spirits and they again upon the body and so much the more because

it is perpetual and as is said keepeth no holy dayes
it is a sin that doth fret and consume the body and so is a means to hinder health and shorten life and of this the wise man took notice when he termed envie the rottenness of the bones prov

and justly it is called the rotting of the bones because like a fever hectick it doth consume a man and bring him to his end as the rottenness of the marrow that lieth within the bones
envious men cordis sui peste moriuntur they die by the plague of their own heart gregor
an envious man is sui ipsius carnifex his own tormentor and executioner
the grecians call it undefined span alphabet from the word undefined span alphabet homicidium slaughter because the envious man killeth his own heart with this passion
or it may be derived from the word undefined span alphabet corrumpo consumo because it is undefined span alphabet a consumption
livor tabificus malis venenum

yea envie to the heart is like rust to the iron or blasting to the corn like the vultures eating up continually the heart of prometheus or the foolish bee that

loseth the life with the sting it burneth the heart and wasteth the body and is like the worm that breedeth in timber and consumeth it so true is that of the son of sirach envie shorten the life eccl


hatred also produceth the like effects for what is said of envie may as well relate unto hatred and malice
envie slayeth the silly one saith job ch and so doth hatred and malice by causing ill humours in the body for according to the modern philosopher in his treatise of the passions the pulse in hatred is observed to be uneven and weaker and oftentimes faster than usual that a man feels colds with sharp and pricking heat in the breast that the stomack ceases to do its office is enclined to vomit and reject the meats it hath eaten or at least to corrupt them and convert them into ill humours
all which considered hatred can be profitable unto none for ill humours are the springs of most diseases
again hatred cannot be so small but it hurts the body because it is never

without sadness which brings me to the next section

sect
vii
of worldly sorrow and immoderate grief of mind
by those epithetes worldly and immoderate the sorrow to be now treated of is distinguished from godly sorrow which worketh repentance to salvation which is neither wordly nor immoderate and may be thus described worldly sorrow causing death of body and soul is that which is immoderate and humbleth not the heart kindly but disquiets disturbs and distempers it whether it proceed from outward evils and losses or inward evils as most from melancholious humours and worst from an evil conscience and this sorrow may be termed rather attrition than contrition the sorrow for our misery or punishment being called attrition for our sault contrition

but to the point in hand worldly

and immoderate sorrow though it may be look'd upon as a punishment of sin rather then a sin it self yet doubtless it is little less than both being a plain aberration from the rules of christianity so long as tis leavened with avarice despondency distrust despair discontent
hence it is that the apostle paul interdicts excessive sorrow for the dead because it argues despair and want of hope but would not have you ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope thess

excess in sorrow makes it sinful in christians
and here also hath place the caveat of the same apostle any be swallowed up with sorrow cor

upon which place a modern expositor trapp of our own ventureth to say that sorrow for sin if it so far exceed as that thereby we are disabled for the discharge of our duties it is a sinful sorrow yea though it be for sin
with much more confidence then may we term that a sinful sorrow which the apostle saith cor

worketh death

namely the sorrow of the world which by expositors is understood to be that sorrow which is proper to men of the world such as are not regenerated by the spirit of god whose grief and sorrow is nothing but the bitter smart of their misery without any serious and sincere repentance
or by sorrow of the world is meant a sorrow only for the loss of worldly things or which is caused from the fear of god's judgments in unbelievers whereupon there followeth commonly hardness of heart and a reprobate sense and at length if not prevented by repentance despair and damnation which do not only bring a spiritual and eternal death but also by wasting the body hasten a temporal death
and this will appear in respect of the body first by natural reason secondly by divine and humane testimony

first by natural reason
and here we must understand that in sorrow or sadness the heat and spirits retire and by their sudden surrounding and possession of the heart all at once as the physicians observe do many times cause suffocation

they being likewise by uniting encreased do violently consume the moisture of the body and so beget drought and leanness and through long continuance consumptions
or as others thus in sorrow or sadness there is a gathering together of much melancholly blood about the heart which collection extinguisheth the good spirits or at least dulleth and dampeth them besides the heart being possessed by such an humour cannot digest well the blood and spirits which ought to be dispersed thorow the whole body but converteth them into melancholy the which humour being cold dry drieth the whole body and maketh it wither away for cold extinguisheth heat and drieness moisture which two qualities principally concern life

secondly by divine and humane testimony it further appeareth for first solomon saith a merry heart doth good like a medicine but a broken spirit drieth the bones prov

also heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop prov

it maketh it stoop because it wasteth the natural

vital and animal spirits
hence also is that prescription of the son of sirach remove sorrow far from thee for sorrow hath killed many eccl

and that of the same author of heaviness cometh death and the heaviness of the heart breaketh strength eccl

these with the fore cited places out of st paul
epistle to the corinthians might be thought sufficient to confirm this truth did not some men require a further illustration of it by humane testimony and this may be considered in the next place as useful to the same end

undefined span alphabet
it is euripides
sorrows to men diseases bring
hence also and for this cause are those trite and vulgar sayings sadness and melancholy the to sickness
too much sorrow maketh a man to run mad
sorrow is good for nothing but sin

hence also is that conclusion of aquinas in his summs





tristitiae magis corpori nocet quam aliae passiones cùm vitalem motum cordis impediat sadness doth more hurt the body then other passions of the mind because it hindereth the vital motion of the heart
it likewise takes away appetite overheats the heart and lungs corrupts the nutritious juyce causeth consumptions and other cold diseases
out of which we may gather that this affection especially if it be more vehement and inveterate than ordinary doth bring very many and those grievous damages unto the body some part whereof may be evidenced in these ensuing instances
plantius the numidian at the sight of his dead wife presently died laertius
diodorus the logician died for sorrow because he could not answer the question of stilpo
homer died with sudden sorrow because he was not able to answer a fishermans question plut

aristotle the prince of ancient philosophers

when he came to chalcis and saw the ebbing and flowing of euripus that narrow sea near boeotia seven times in the houres because he could not find the cause he fell into an incurable disease caelius

phinehas wife when she heard the sorrowful tidings of the taking of the arck of god the death of her father in law and husband she bowed her self being great with child was delivered and died through sorrow of heart sam


queen mary died as some supposed by her much sighing before her death of thought and sorrow of heart for the departure of king philip or the loss of calice act
mon

now in all this argument we may take notice what fearful effects immoderate sorrow doth produce upon our bodies what a malign cold and dry passion it is wasting the radical humour and by degrees quenching the natural heat of the body yea thrusting her poyson even unto the heart whose vigour she causeth to wither and consumes the forces

by her bad influence whereof we may see the signs after death when as they come to open those that have been smothered with melancholy for instead of a heart they find nothing but a dry skin like to the leaves in autumn so that all things exactly considered we may say that there is not any passion which doth so much shorten our life or make it so infirm and miserable as this in its excess
hitherto might be referred despair an evil conscience such as is neither quiet nor good and such like self tormenting sins which as they are sometimes causes of immoderate and excessive sorrow so by the like influence upon the body do produce such a flow of diseases as suddenly ebb in death

and here lest it should be judged that godly sorrow which worketh repentance because it is sometimes very intense should produce the same natural effects in the body that immoderate and vicious doth you must understand that in true godly sorrow though it be sometimes very intense vehement and zealous there are

such intervals of spiritual joy by reason of the cherishing hope of pardon that all excess with its natural effects is diverted mitigated and in due season avoided

nocte pluit tot redeunt spectacula mane
which in a metaphorical sence may be render'd thus

clouds showers of grief may endure a night but glympses of joy return at

or as david thus may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning psal

the acrimony then in godly sorrow is so corrected by the sweet ingredient of inward consolation that it never proves offensive or prejudicial to bodily health as wordly and immoderate sorrow hath been fully declared to do

of sensual joy and laughter in excess
solomon made trial of sensual joy mirth and pleasure thinking therein to find true content and but in the conclusion found nothing but the husks of vanity wherewith he at first like a prodigal son would fain have satisfied himself but could not as appeareth by his own words said in my heart go to now will prove thee with mirth therefore enjoy pleasure and behold this also is vanity eccl

said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doth it

there is a woe denounced by christ of whom st augustin noteth that tis often read that he wept never that he laughed st aug serm
de sanctis against all such as rejoyce in riot revelling carousing luxury and other forbidden pleasures of this world in that comprehensive phrase unto you that laugh now for ye shall mourn and weep luk

all

inordinate rejoycing or rejoycing in unlawful pleasures may justly have the apostle's reprehension applied to it such rejoycing is evil jam


now as it is evil in respect of the soul so also in repect of the body for that very oft swounding and sudden death hath befallen to sudden and immoderate joy and that because the cordial blood and vital spirits are thereby so suddenly diffused to the exterior parts that life goeth out therewith and returneth not as fernelius noteth
or as of this passion in its excess thus observeth opening extraordinarily the orisices of the heart the blood of the veines doth so huddle in and in so abundant a quantity that it cannot there be rarified by the heat soon enough to list up the little skins that shut the entries of those veins by which means it smothers the fire which it used to feed when it came into the heart in fit proportion of the passions artic

hence suppose it is that the lord verulam saith in his history of life and death
great joyes attenuate and diffuse the spirits and shorten life

instances hereof are many in history let these few suffice

with such like instances might further dilate upon this point but lest an odd humorist should laugh himself out of breath to think of them as improbable or the significant caveats deduced from them as unseasonable in sad times here desist

of servile slavish and all unlawful fear in excess
there is as divines distinguish a divine fear a filial fear a dutiful fear a wise fear and these are all lawful but then there is also a slavish fear a false fear a distrustful fear or a natural fear joyned with diffidence and these are unlawful

servile or slavish fear whereby men do abstain from sin rather in respect of the punishments ensuing thereupon then out of an unfained hatred thereof or a fear which ariseth upon the apprehension of god's justice and wrath against sin and

the punishments and plagues for sin is to be avoided as irregular for we ought to serve god without this sort of fear luke

it is carnal and such as doth no wise proceed from the working of the spirit but is quite contrary to the same for god saith the apostle hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power of love tim


the reason hereof may be in that the perfect love of god in us excommunicates it perfect love saith st john caseth out fear ep john


and as touching false fear though it be rather a fruit of weakness and a punishment of sin for so tis threatned as a punishment by the lord lev

then a sin in it self yet as it is irregular it is concluded within the scope of this discourse and as it is frequent or excessive may justly deserve reproof

distrustful fear is straitly prohibited by those apostles peter pet


and john rev

yea all natural fear when it is joined with distrust and diffidence or excess is to be avoided as unwarrantable in sacred writ num


kings

and was therefore by nehemiah resisted nehem


now as all unlawful and immoderate fear is to be avoided in regard of the soul so also in regard of the body for it is often the cause of diseases as first of that called in latin tremor in english trembling or shaking of the members
metus dejicit vires ac proinde tremorem inducit saith the learned galen com
in lib
epid cap

fear brings down the strength and so causeth trembling
his meaning more largely might be thus viz that the heat which resides in the blood and spirits being that which supports and fortifies the members of man those members being destitute thereof can hardly support themselves but tremble and shake in that manner and whereas the hands and lips shew greater signs of alteration then the rest the reason is for that those parts have a more strict bond with the heart and have less blood then the rest and therefore cold doth more easily make an impression upon them
also it is sometimes the cause of that disease called cordis

palpitatio panting of the heart deut

or at least of the like symptoms and those as dangerous especially when they precede a syncope or swounding which is as proper an effect and catastrophe of this passion as of that disease

moreover it is sometimes the extimulating promoting cause of the lask or diarrhaea for as the author of a certain natural history saith if the natural heat leave the heart and go downward

the fear is not only encreased but it bringeth withal a loosness of the belly
therefore it is written saith he in the book of job where it is spoken of the fear that leviathan bringeth upon men that the mighty are afraid by reason of breakings they purifie or purge themselves job

for fear of him
neither is this all but experience teacheth us at a dear rate that in immoderate fear through the strength of fantasie and imagination sundry contagious diseases as the small pox measles are frequently imprinted in the blood when guilt makes men fearful of deserved punishment

according to that of the wise man the fear of the wicked it shall come upon him prov


and as it causeth diseases so consequently shortness of life

it put the watch at christ's sepulcher into such a shaking fit by an under them mat

and another within their hearts that but for god's mercy it had shaked them into their graves when they became as dead men
it seemeth to be a notable contraction of life by its sudden introduction of the blossoms of old age viz gray hairs which by the extremity of this passion have been strangely effected in the space

of a week or two as tis storied of one mr baynings of london

but more fully to the matter we find the sad and pernicious effect of immoderate fear in this following narration

will ye put me to this torture seeing have no way offended you if it be for my ye need not torment me for as was never ashamed to make a confession thereof no more will now be at this present before you but will if you please freely shew you my mind therein vide clark's martyrol
yet for all this they would have her to the rack
whereupon she again said if must needs suffer this pain pray give me leave to call upon my god first
this they assented to and whilst she was fervently pouring out her prayers to god one of the commissioners was surprised with such fear and terrour that he fell into a swound out of which he could never be recovered
many such like instances might be heap'd up were it not in vain to evince this point per plura quod potest fieri per pauciora by many words which may be done by few and therefore shall conclude it with the sentence of that atlas of experimental knowledge lord bacon in his translated history of life and death pag
great fears shorten the life for saith he in fear by reason of the cares taken

for the remedy and hopes there is a turmoil and vexing of the spirits
and so much shall serve for this section

sect
of immoderate desires ambition excessive cares sollicitude covetousness omne nimium vertitur in vitium all extremes become vicious and those epithites immoderate and excessive signifie as much in relation to desires ambition cares sollicitude and therefore the less shall need to be inferred for the arraignement of them
know then briefly that the are all diseases of the soul

ambition which is an immoderate desire or thirst after honour and worldly glory is a spiritual dropsie that is not easily cured not only a great sin in it self but puts men upon many others
there is nothing saith one the author of the whole duty of man
so horrid which a man that eagerly seeks greatness will stick at lying perjury murder or any thing will

down with him if they seem to tend to his advancement
and it is the more difficultly cured in regard it is as one calls it the shirt of the soul viz the last vice we put off
in a word it is condemned by many texts of sacred writ but shall instance only upon the th of st luke
where we find it lively reprehended both by the real type or example of humility in a young child set in the midst of the disciples and by the doctrine which christ urged to them upon that occasion

sollicitude and excessive care is also frequently interdicted for though a provident care for the things of this life when it is moderate seasonable without distrust of god be warrantable and commendable yet if it be otherwise it is evil and forbidden
take saith our saviour no thought for to morrow mat

and in st luke

we find martha for her immoderate or at least unseasonable care reproved by christ when even a courtesie to her saviour rather then a love to her self was the ground and occasion of that care

so covetousness taken in the largest sense as it consisteth in an immoderate desire of filthy lucre or any thing above ones allotted portion is not undeservedly reproved when by the apostle it is called idolatry col

for it is as he saith in another place the root of all evil tim


not only of the evil of sin but also of the evil of punishment and that punishment not only eternal depriving a man of an heavenly inheritance cor

but also temporal piercing him thorow with many sorrows as the same apostle saith in the forecited tim

the covetous man saith one hath three vultures alwayes feeding upon his heart care in getting fear in keeping grief in spending and parting with that he hath so that he is as it were in the suburbs of hell aforehand

but this is not all the evil that springs from the root of covetousness for it pierceth not only the heart with sorrows but also the whole body with diseases which effect may as well be applicable to sollicitude excessive cares ambition and immoderate desires
so true is that in schola salerni

te vis reddere sanum

curas tolle

if thou wilt keep thy self in health then banish carking cares for wealth

and no less true are the words of a modern physician who largely and learnedly reasoneth upon this point in linguâ latinâ but to avoid prolixity shall as a translator give you his sense only in linguâ vulgari in desire by which

the soul is so out of measure run out and dilated upon a good sometime represented as it were to come as by reason of the delay of it tis presently as twere contracted this singular occurreth that it agitates the heart more violently and furnisheth the brain with more spirits then any other of the passions
for as he noteth further out of a longing for the obtaining that which we ardently desire

the spirits from the brain are most speedily sent into all parts of the body that may serve any wayes to

actions requisite to that purpose but especially into the heart and blood contained in it that being dilated more than ordinarily and moved more swiftly it may send back again a greater plenty of spirits to the brain as well to maintain and fortifie the idaea of this desire as to pass from thence into all the organs of the senses and all the muscles which may be set on work to attain what one desires
and from sollicitude which is excited from the delay of enjoying the thing desired the same spirits are drawn back again to the brain whence it comes to pass that the more subtile blood being withdrawn together from the outward parts the heart is as twere straightn'd up the circulation of the blood hindred and by consequence the whole body rendred weak faint and sickly
so that it ought not to seem a wonder to any that most of those persons whom an amorous affection or desire ambition avarice or any other more fervent longing hath a long time exercised should be brought through a long continuing sollicitude into the deepest languishment of body into a contumatious disposition of ill humours yea further into a consumption and pining and withering

away of the body also into other cold diseases
thus he
immoderate desire hath no rest tis endless and a perpetual rack
the ambitious si appetitum explere non potest furore corripitur if he cannot satisfie his desire he runs mad with a phrensie

hereunto may be referred study or an immoderate desire of humane knowledge which as it was one sin which that heluo librorum unsatiable reader miracle of learning dr james usher of armagh

lamented in himself that he should be as glad of munday to go to his book as of the lord's day for his service so it is no less unhealthful than sinful for we find in the history of his life mean the that he contracted to himself the sciatica by sitting up late in the colledge library of dublin ibidem
overmuch study as machiavel holds weakens the body and as lemnius saith causeth melancholy in that by reason of the immoderate agitation of the mind the native heat is extinguished and the spirits both animal

and vital being attenuated and weakned soon decay and perish by which it cometh to pass that the natural moisture being exhausted the body doth decline to a cold and dry habit
yea when study is extended unto unseasonable hours as is usual with some students it becomes very injurious to the body according to that old sentence in grammar nocturnae lucubrationes longe periculosissimae habentur night studies are accounted exceeding dangerous
they cause dryness of the brain phrensie dotage emaciate the body make the humours adust increase choler inflame the blood and as may be added out of galen and avicenna concerning immoderate watching naturalem calorem dissipat laesà concoctione cruditates facit overthrow the natural heat and hurting concoction cause crudities galen

de sanitate tuenda avicenna

what shall say more amongst many other diseases it sometimes produceth consumptions and sometimes madness and in respect of this last festus his proposition which was indiscreetly applied to paul may truly enough be referred

to many a hard student qui insanit cum art beside thy self much learning doth make thee mad acts

immoderate bookishness seeking to fill the curious brain fills it and the whole body with crudities rheums and other maladies that at last the scholler had need be bookish again and study how to rid himself of diseases
these are the fruits that some men reap by their immoderate desire after the tree of knowledge these are the consequences of that wisedom which is foolishness with god as the spirit of god terms it cor


but again we will consider all the abovementioned enormities and irregularities in this section as they cause shortness of life
the condensation of the spirits as the lord verulam in his history of life and death
writeth is effectual to long life and therefore especial care must be taken that the spirits be not too often resolved for attenuation goeth before resolution and the spirit once attenuated doth not very easily retire or is condensed now resolution is caused by affections of the

mind cares and carpings and anxious expectations
not without reason then is that proverbial sentence care will kill a cat though it be said to have nine lives or that observation of the son of sirach carefulness bringeth age before the time eccl

cura facit canos care brings gray hairs
it antidates old age and so consequently shorteneth life
hence it is that almost in every village we shall find a covetous drooping and at length dropping into his grave not with pure old age but beaten down and overwhelmed with too much sollicitude and carking care before that he can arrive to that maturity

also immoderate study by its subtil acute and eager inquisition after humane learning shortens life for it tireth the spirit and wasteth it
solomon hinteth as much to us in these words and further by these my son be admonished of making many books there is no end and much study is a weariness of the flesh eccles


that is as bishop hall paraphraseth upon the place by these divine words

my son do thou content thy self to be admonished not roving in thy desires after multitude of other volumes whereof there is no end in the compiling and reading of which there is much toil and weariness of the flesh and much expence of the spirits

finally many other irregularities and enormities there are but as most of them may be reduced to one or other of the sections so the like consequential effects may be deduced from them
and so conclude the whole chapter having largely shewed and demonstrated that many sins are natural causes of bodily diseases and shortness of life

chap
iii

containing an enumeration of sundry sins as they are accidental causes of bodily diseases and especially of shortness of life

that we may term an accidental cause which produceth its effect not naturally and immediately by it self but by accident or chance or fortune as the logicians define it
now how many sad accidents do sometimes result from sundry sins which expose men to divers diseases and also to shortness of life may appear by this following accompt which the greater part thereof must crave leave to draw from and illustrate by a collection of several instances in history
first in relation to gluttony and drunkenness we find these following recorded and adapted to our present purpose

gregory of tours reporteth of childerick a saxon that glutted himself so full of meat and drink over night that

in the morning he was found choked in his bed

anacreon the poet a grand consumer of wine and a notable drunkard was choked with the husk of a grape
philostrates being in the bathes of sinvessa devoured so much wine that he fell down the stairs and almost broke his neck with the fall martid lib
alexander the son of basilius and brother of leo the emperour did so wallow and drown himself in the gulf of pleasure and intemperance that one day after he had stuffed himself too full of meat as he got upon his horse he burst a vein within his body whereat upwards and downwards issued such abundance of blood that his life and soul issued forth withal melanct lib

within few years of my own knowledge saith mine author three not far from huntington being overcome with drink perished by drowning when being not able to rule their horses they were carried by them into the main stream from whence they never came out alive

again but left behind them visible marks of god's justice for the terrour and example of others beard's theater of god's judgments

holofernes while he besotted his senses with excess of wine and good chear judeth found means to cut of his head judeth

yea woful experience doth make manifest almost every day in one corner or other of this land that the lord punisheth many with sudden death and destruction even in the midst of their drunken fits although some again to shew his delight is in mercy and not in the sudden destruction of his creatures he punisheth with some lingring distempers whereof this vice of drunkenness is often an accidental cause by exposing such persons to heats and colds the adventitious causes of most diseases to falls bruises fractures dislocations wounds contusions combustions which are the occasions or accidental causes not only of many organical diseases but also similar as might be made apparent if right reason

or mature experience were consulted
and therefore let that proverbial sentence drunken folks seldom take harm be hereafter exploded by all sober persons considering how harmful and prejudicial this enormity hath been declared to be both to soul and body

and now because vina parant animos veneri whoredom is usually ushered in by drunkeness we will in the next place consider lust adultery fornication uncleanness as accidental causes of diseases but especially of shortness of life
and here might shew how all immoderate and unseasonable use of venus doth impede concoction and so consequently produce diseases but shall rather touch upon it as a contingent cause of venereal pox which as in the former chapter we considered as a natural effect in respect of the virulent contagion communicated so in this we look upon it as contingent and accidental in respect of the persons communicating in the abovemention'd sins

but shall choose rather to insist upon

those sins as accidental causes or occasions of shortness of life and to that end shall illustrate the point by these ensuing instances

shechem the son of hamor the hivite ravished dinah jacob daughter for which cause simeon and levi her brethren revenged the injury done unto their sister by slaying shechem and with him all the males that were in the city gen

in the and
chapter of judges we read that the levite's wife having forsaken her husband to play the whore certain moneths after he had again received her to be his wife she was given over against her will to the villanous and monstrous lusts of the men of gibeah who so abused her for the space of a whole night together that in the morning she was found dead upon the threshold which thing turn'd to a great destruction and overthrow not only of those children of belial in gibeah which committed such lewdness and folly in israel but also of their abettors the benjamites who lost above thousand men in the

slaughter through that occasion
thus the first voluntary lust of the levite's wife was most justly punished by a second rape amongst the lustful gibeonites whose lust when it had conceived brought forth sin and sin when it was finished brought forth death

amnon one of the sons of king david was so strongly enchanted with the love of his sister thamar that to the end to fulfil his lust he traiterously forced her to his will but absalom her natural brother hunting for opportunity of revenge for this indignity towards his sister invited him two years after to a banquet with his other brethren and after the same caused his men to murder him for a sam

the same absalom that slew amnon for incest with his sister committed himself incest with his fathers concubines moved thereto by the wicked counsel of achitophel but it was the and occasion of his overthrow and untimely death sam

infinite are the examples that might out of history be collected to this purpose but to avoid prolixity let it suffice only to add hereunto that for these and the like sins many thousands in the world in every age have either by the rage of jealousie in the persons wronged or by the revenging sword of the higher powers punishing wrong suffered the condigne punishment of death

thirdly and lastly to summ up all further addition that might be look'd upon as necessarily relating to this chapter consider in few words that immoderate anger envie hatred malice selfmurder unlawful duels treason murder of others despair rebellion theft ambition covetousness immoderate grief atheisme blasphemy witchcraft and such like do either immediately by themselves or mediately by other sins accumulated and a succession of unprosperous

events attending them prove accidental causes sometimes of diseases but most commonly of an untimely death
and so proceed to the fourth chapter as followeth

chap
iv

containing an enumeration of sundry sins as they are supernaturally occasions of bodily diseases and shortness of life

this chapter may seem to have some relation to the first and so it hath in genere but in regard it differs from it in specie have here placed it as one of the chief to adorn strengthen yea as a to finish and complete the building of this first part of my discourse
but before descend to particulars give me leave here to lay down somewhat in general terms as praeliminary to the present design

though god be the proper efficient

and cause of diseases yet as sin is the immediate cause of god's wrath and anger and a provocation of his vindictive justice in this respect it may be termed a principal though not immediate cause or occasion of diseases more especially of such as depend not upon the ordinary chain of second causes but being above the sphaere of nature are inflicted by the almighty and unlimited power of god
and this the great secretaries of nature as philosophers and physicians should do well to observe according to the advice of hippocrates who would have a physician to take special notice whether the disease came from a divine cause or whether it follow the course of nature
how this place of hippocrates is to be understood paracelsus is of opinion that such spiritual diseases for so he calls them are spiritually to be cured and not otherwise but of this by the way in general
shall now descend to particulars whereof shall make demonstration de facto

and first of the abuse of the ordinances

of god viz the word and sacraments
theopompus a philosopher being about to insert certain things out of the writings of moses into his prophane works and so to abuse the sacred word of god was striken with a frensie and being warned of the cause thereof in a dream by prayers made unto god recovered his senses again joseph
antiq lib
cap

this story is recorded by josephus as also another of theodectes a poet that mingled his tragedies with the holy scriptures and was therefore striken with blindness until he had recanted his impiety

in a town of germany called itszith there dwelt a certain that was a monstrous despiser of the word of god and his sacraments he upon a time in the midst of his cups railed in most bitter terms upon a minister of god's word after which going presently into the fields to his sheep he never returned alive but was found there dead with his body all scorched and burnt as black as a coal the lord having

given him over into the hands of the devil to be thus used for his vile prophaness and abusing holy things dr justus jonas in luther's conferences reporteth this to be true

if you shall despise my statutes saith the lord or refuse to hearken unto my law will visit you with consumptions and burning agues and heaviness of heart lev

col


in a spiritual sense with that of baptisme was struck immediately by the lord and fell so sick by the way that it was thought he would have died and it came to pass by the way in the inn that the lord met him and sought to kill him exod

which words are by some elucidators bishop hall thus understood viz that the lord appeared visibly unto him and sensibly afflicted him with some sudden and violent disease which he knew to be done in regard of his neglect of his sons circumcision

eutychus for sleeping at the sermon fell

down so as he had slept his last sleep acts

but that a merciful god by the hands of paul did raise him up again to teach him and by him all churchsleepers the future danger of such negligence and irreverence in his house his deadly fall not being so much accidental as a judgment from god

and as concerning the unworthy receiving the lord's supper st paul telleth the corinthians undefined span alphabet for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep corinthians


for these abuses of this holy sacrament the hand of god hath been upon many of you so as many of you are afflicted with divers kinds of diseases and many of you are striken with a temporal death here called sleep
now from the apostles declaring this to be the true cause of that sickness and mortality that was amongst them it is to be supposed that either they looked not after the cause at all but took it to come only as a thing of course or which is more probable that they mistook the cause imagined that to

be the cause which was not
a great mortality there was amongst them many died but that they thought might proceed from the distemperature of the body or from the corruption of the air or from want of exercise or from not observing a good diet or from immoderate labour some they thought might die of one of these causes some of another
but the apostle passeth all these over and maketh known unto them that however these might be considerable as causes in their due places yet the true main and principal cause they were utterly ignorant of and that was their abusive and negligent receiving of the sacrament of the lord's supper for this cause many are weak

a truth which had any less than an apostle delivered he would have been esteemed a setter forth of new doctrine or had the apostle delivered it in any dark and obscure phrase flesh and blood would have found out twenty interpretations before ever they would have thought of this but the speaker is so

divine and the speech so plain that it cannot be mistaken undefined span alphabet saith the text for this cause because of your unworthy receiving the body and blood of christ many are sick and many sleep
hence was that speech of saint anselme taken who saith that many diseases that reign in the summer though physicians may impute them to other secondary causes proceed from peoples irreverent receiving that sacrament at easter

that de facto this is a truth see the of the chronicles and the chap
where you shall find that for some abuses and disorders committed in the celebration of the passover the jews were smitten with some troublesom disease for tis here said that upon hezekiah prayer the lord healed the people which implieth plainly that they were diseased and sick before and yet this default was only in the circumstantial points of that sacrament for tis there also said that every one had prepared his heart for to seek god
some defect there was only in some ceremonial rite to be observed

now what we find applied to the passover we may without fear apply to the sacrament of the lord's supper for however they differ in circumstances yet for substance they are the same
sickness we see was sent for the abuse of that and therefore the same punishment appointed for the abuse of this yea inflicted witness the corinthians who for this cause were plagued with divers diseases and sundry kinds of death
and indeed it is not unlike that since these corinthians there have been many thousands who for the very same cause have not as the psalmist saith lived out half their dayes but have been swept away out of the land of the living and gone down with sorrow into the grave
true then it is de facto god hath thus plagued the sinful neglect and abuse of his sacrament

will now also demonstrate that de jure it must needs be so and this will appear if we consider the sin it self to be camelinum peccatum a sin of a very large size burdened with those following aggravations namely that tis a sin immediatly

against christ's own person robbeth god of that which he is most tender of his honour and is in the judgment of the holy ghost cor

suppose if committed no less than a spilling and shedding of the precious blood of christ heb

in a word that tis a sin paramount like saul higher then his fellows
and therefore let us judge in our selves whether the wages of such a sin unrepented of can be less than corporal plagues and temporal death
for if we contemn the sacred body of christ how can we think that god should take any care of ours if we make no reckoning of christ's death tis but just with god to disregard ours
oh then as we tender our health and our lives let us never dare to approach unto that dreadful table without due reverence and a competent measure of preparation

secondly concerning the prophaning the lord's day sacriledge we read several instances of god's wrath upon such declared in corporal plagues and destruction

a certain godly minister preaching and pressing the sanctification of the sabbath and taking occasion herein to make mention of that man who by the special command of god was stoned to death for gathering sticks upon the sabbath day hereupon one in the congregation stood up and laughed and made all the haste he could out of the church and went to gathering of sticks though he had no need of them but when the people came out from the sermon they found this man dead with the bundle of sticks in his arms lying in the church porch
this is attested by a credible author

yea if time would permit or this enchiridion extend to it could expatiate upon such instances as might likewise demonstrate that not a few have upon the breach of the fourth commandment been striken by the immediate hand of the almighty with lameness and sore diseases
and for sacriledge that hath been severely punished in like manner as in antioches epiphanes who fell sick with

grief upon the remembrance of the evils he did at jerusalem in taking away the vessels of gold and silver that were therein confessing that for this cause his troubles came upon him and so suddenly died mach chap
also it is recorded that wicked alcimus for his violation of the sanctuary and his sacrilegious enterprises was immediatly taken with a palsie so that he could no more speak any thing but died suddenly with great torment mach
cap

again ananias and sapphira his wife for their sacriledge cloaked with hypocrisie at peter rebuke fell down dead acts



thirdly swearing blasphemy and perjury do sometimes in a supernatural manner occasion diseases and shortness of life

mr fox acts mon
telleth us of one named john peter to alexander that cruel keeper of newgate who being a most horrible swearer and blasphemer used commonly to say if it be not true pray god may rot ere

die and not in vain for he rotted away indeed and so died in misery

read of a perjuter that forswore himself to the end to deceive and prejudice another thereby but he had no sooner made an end of his false oath but a grievous apoplexy assailed him so that without speaking any one word he died within few dayes

that story in eusebius is very remarkable concerning narcissus a good bishop of jerusalem and three lewd varlots his accusers as it is recited by the abovenamed mr fox
narcissus intending to accuse three notable malefactors of their misdemeanors they thought to prevent his accusation by first laying a grievous crime to his charge and to get credit thereunto each of them bound it with their severeral oaths one wishing to be consumed with fire if it were not so another to die of some grievous disease the third to lose both his eyes narcissus seeing three to one was odds gave place but what became of these perjured fellows the first was consumed by a fire

set in his house the second was taken with a strange disease that his whole body which brought him to a miserable end the third seeing god's judgments upon his brethren in evil confessed the fault for which he continually shed such abundance of tears that he wept out his eyes becoming blind thereupon euseb lib

god who takes notice of mens oaths takes vengeance of their breach and violation

also we find recorded that in the reign of the emperour anastatius there was a certain arian bishop whose name was olympus who as he was washing himself in a bath belched forth many blasphemous speeches against the blessed trinity whereupon lightning fell down from heaven upon him three times and he was burnt and consumed therewith paul
diacon in the history of anastatius

there was also in the time of alphonsus king of arragon a certain hermite called antonius a monstrous blasphemer that belched out vile and injurious speeches against christ jesus and the virgin

mary his mother but he was striken with a most grievous disease even to be eaten and gnawn in pieces of worms until he died aeneas silvius of the acts of alphonsus

fourthly pride ambition haughtiness do sometimes produce the like effects in the like manner as may appear in these following instances

antiochus the same with the aforenamed epiphanes
a notable tyrant and persecutor of the jews in his pride and fume said that he would come to jerusalem and make it a common burying place of the jews but the lord almighty the god of israel smote him with an incurable and invisible plague for as soon as he had spoken these words a pain of the bowels that was remediless came upon him and sore torments of the inner parts mach
howbeit he nothing at all ceased from his bragging but still was filled with pride breathing out fire in his rage against the jews but it came to pass that he fell down from his chariot carried violently so that having a sore fall

all the members of his body were much pained and soon after the worms came out of his body and while he lived in sorrow and pain his flesh fell away and the filthiness of his smell was noysom to all his army and so the wrath of god ended this proud man's miserable dayes

the other is that of king herod surnamed agrippa which put james the brother of john to death and imprisoned peter with purpose to make him tast of the same cup acts
this man was puffed with sacrilegious pride for being upon a time seated in his throne of judgment and arrayed in his royal robes shewing forth his greatness and magnificence in the presence of the ambassadors of tyre sidon who desired to continue in peace with him as he spake unto them the people shouted and cried that it was the voice of god and not of man which titles of honour he disclaimed not and therefore the angel of the lord smote him immediately because he gave not god the glory and he was eaten of worms and gave up the ghost acts



josephus relateth the story how that herod not reproving nor forbidding his pernicious flatterers was presently taken with most grievous and horrible gripes in his bowels so that looking upon the people he uttered these words behold here your goodly god whom you but now so highly honoured ready to die with extream pain jewish antiq lib
cap

thus did this miserable man exemplarily verifie the wise man's proverb pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall prov


fifthly adultery fornication and the like are also sometimes supernaturally occasions of diseases and shortness of life as may appear de facto in the succeeding instances
claudius of asses counsellor of the parliament of paris a man very ill affected to the professors of the gospel committed villany with one of his waiting maids in the very midst whereof he was taken with an apoplexie which immediately after made an end of him beard's theater of god's judgments

in northamptonshire a noble man's servant of good credit and place with his master having familiarity with another mans wife as he was about to commit villany with her in a chamber he fell down stark dead with his hose about his heels which being heard by reason of the noise his fall made of those which were in the lower room they all ran hastily up and easily perceived both the villany he went about and the horrible judgment of god upon him for the same ibidem

also the lustful sodomites for that sin which deriveth its name from the wicked place of their habitation were smitten with blindness gen

a just and proper punishment to stop up those lights that were the windows or inlets and outlets of such abominable lust and concupiscence

and also of a cloud of witnesses more in divine and humane records portending a showr of wrath and vengeance from heaven upon all impenitent sinners even in this life by corporal plagues and destruction
shall therefore add only thus much more to the summ and then give you the total viz that as god is a supernatural agent and his power is not to be limitted to natural means in regard it is evident by many instances that he can and sometimes doth work without means in the production of sundry diseases and mortal distempers a truth not much taken notice of by such as would comprehend all causes and effects within the sphaere of nature so likewise the devil by god's

permission for the punishment of some sins hath power to cause sickness and that supernaturally so he did afflict saul with the vehemency of a frenzy and melancholy distemper sam


so he did the lunaticks mark
and many daemoniacal persons with strange maladies luke
yea and still doth act over his old part in these last dayes though not so frequently as in christ's getting possession in many even in this nation as history and our own experience can demonstrate
and as he can perform this by himself so likewise by his complices and instruments as witches and magicians who by god's permission can cause most diseases yea sometimes death it self to such as they bear malice as might more fully appear de facto by a book intituled the arraignement and trial of witches at lancaster and york but yet their power is so limited by an higher that not all whom they spleen are subject to it but only or mostly such as will not be gathered under the wings of god's providence and protection straying so far in sin as

until they become a prey unto satan and his hellish spies who will at least infest their bodies with diseases and sudden mortality though mercy perhaps may step in betimes to redeem their souls
and thus may we discern the truth of this point that those sundry sins which have mentioned in this chapter are in a supernatural way principal occasions of bodily diseases and shortness of life

a corollary
the result of the whole preceding discourse is that as the body by a powerful influence works upon the affections of the soul so the soul works most effectually upon the qualities and temperature of the body producing by her passions and perturbations wonderful alterations as most diseases and sometimes death it self
for sin is the cause of that excess which is in the qualities of which our bodies are made and consequently of the diseases that proceed from thence which afterward bring death to the body
but this is not all for sometimes it comes to pass that when those effects are not produced by such natural

means the mind being corrupted and viciated doth draw them down from heaven being supernaturally wrought for the greater testimony of god's power and vengeance upon obstinate offenders
so then that is most true which plato saith in his charmides omnia corporis mala ab animâ procedere all the mischiefs of the body proceed from the soul
and thus much shall suffice to have run over the first part of this undertaking which was to demonstrate by natural reason and also by divine and humane testimony that vicious and irregular actions and affections prove often occasions of most bodily diseases and of shortness of life

the second part

demonstrating by natural reason and also divine and humane testimony that vertuous and regular actions and affections do conduce to the preservation of health and prolongation of life

chap


in a transition from the first part to the second the terms vertuous and regular and explained and the method of the subsequent discourse is declared

the cause of the disease being known the cure is the more readily wrought and in this respect shall be the more brief in this my second part because contraria contrariis illustrantur contraries are illustrated by contraries

and that in such a manner as the first part being admitted for a truth the second may regulâ contrariorum by the rule of contraries succeed as a necessary consequence
but before proceed to further illustration shall explicate the terms
by the term vertuous we may understand godliness honesty of life and good manners for the word undefined span alphabet vertue according to the ordinary known notion of it signifieth probity of manners among men as the generical word that contains all moral and christian vertues under it in which sense it is used by st paul undefined span alphabet if there be any vertue phil


and also by st peter pet


as you may take notice of by viewing the original and the annotations of the learned dr hammond upon the same
so by the word regular we understand such actions and affections as are squared according to the direction of god's word which is a rule to go and work by
as many saith the apostle as walk according to this rule or canon gal


hence the scriptures are called canonical because

they contain and give a perfect rule of faith and manners unto the church which is bound to walk obediently according to this rule and to give testimony to it and not by her authority to it and the sense of it as many do without blushing
likewise by this term regular we may apprehend and comprehend whatsoever is according to the dictates or rules of right reason in the whole course and carriage of a moral prudent christian and religious conversation
and this might easily prove by shewing the great congruity that is between that light and the laws that god hath placed in our souls and the duties of religion that by the expresness of his written word he requires from us and demonstrate that reason teacheth all those excepting only the two positives baptism and the holy eucharist as a learned modern author hath said before me in his sermon ad clerum upon rom
and latter part of the first vers is your reasonable service
but shall now proceed to something more proper and adaequate unto

the present purpose and that is to lay down a of the succeeding argument

in the next chapter shall demonstrate in general and particular that vertuous and regular actions and affections are in a sense conducing to the preservation of health and prolongation of life and in the third chapter shall shew you that such actions and affections do in a natural sense conduce to the same end of health and long life and in the fourth chapter prove that the same means through the blessed influence of divine providence do become occasions of the same natural effects and in the last chapter shall answer some objections briefly and then conclude the whole

chap
ii

shewing in general and particular that vertuous regular actions affections are in a sense conducing to the preservation of health and prolongation of life

if we search the scriptures we shall find a great cloud of witnesses and testimonies ushering in this truth viz that a life led in religion vertue and the fear of god doth conduce much to the health of body and also length of dayes as for instance it is written ye shall serve the lord your will take sickness away from the midst of thee exod

also long life is promised as a blessing unto them that keep the commandments in these ensuing words he turn not aside from the commandment to the right hand or to the left to the end that he may prolong his dayes in his kingdom deut

also in these that thou mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his

voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy dayes cap

vers
again health is promised upon like conditions be not wise in thine own eyes saith solomon fear the lord and depart from evil it shall be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bones pro


thus jesus christ the grand exemplar of innocency and integrity was without sin and therefore without sickness

more particularly these blessings are held forth as temporal rewards of sundry moral civil and religious acts and duties and this may appear both by divine and humane authority

first then in respect of obedience to parents we find long life promised as a motive to it in the fifth commandment honour thy father and thy mother that thy dayes may be long upon the land which the lord thy god giveth thee exod

which the apostle calleth the first commandment with promise eph

viz the first affirmative commandment or the first in the second table or the first of all the ten with promise in particular

to them that keep it
which promise sheweth that a more plentiful blessing in this kind followeth from our obedience to this than to the other commandments
and yet confess obedience in general meets with the same blessing as the psalmist doth denote unto us what man is he that desireth life and loveth many dayes that he may see good keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile

depart from evil and do good seek peace and pursue it psal


however there lieth a special emphasis upon the particular observance of the aforesaid commandment by an express and particular promise of long life
but doth this promise alwayes hold yes surely it holdeth generally and for the most part in comparison of the wicked who do not live out half their dayes psal

and if it fail it is but rarely and then in exchange for the better that as the prophet saith the righteous may be taken away from the evil to come isay

say but rarely it fails for to say otherwise were to make the promise of no effect

and the tenor of the commandment very ambiguous
but do not the disobedient live long also truly they have no promise for it and commonly they are cut off by an untimely death or if some of them be reprived until old age they are but comparatively few being reserved only as so many examples of god's mercy and forbearance as the rest being many are soon cut off as examples of his justice
long life then is most commonly the reward of obedience and piety to parents and it must needs be so when divine providence which is more then a wall of brass to encircle and secure us taketh such especial care in the protection and preservation of such as are endued with that eminent vertue as appeareth by what aristotle telleth us viz how that from the hill aetna there ran down a torrent of fire that consumed all the houses thereabout yet in the midst of those fearful flames god's especial care of the godly and obedient shined most brightly for the river of fire parted it self and made a kind of lane for those

who ventured to rescue their aged parents and pluck them out of the jaws of death
ipse dixit undefined span alphabet arist de mundo cap


if providence then wrought so much in a miraculous way for the preservation of the lives of heathens to reward their duty shewed towards their parents surely christians the children of god whose obedience to parents springeth originally from their obedience to their heavenly father may with much more confidence depend upon the same providence for the like preservation and so by consequence the prolongation of their lives as a reward of the same duty

now though have insisted upon the commandment in a literal sense yet by the rules of extension requisite for the interpretation thereof we are to understand there not only our natural parents but as spiritual fathers cor

as ministers and political fathers gen

as magistrates and oeconomical fathers kings



as masters and matrimonial fathers as

husbands eph
to all which a respective obedience may suppose claim a share or portion in the promise of long life

in the second place devout and zealous prayer in a way procureth bodily health and so by consequence length of dayes to enjoy the same
sick abimelech was sent to abraham a prophet to be healed by prayer now therefore saith god restore the man his wife for he is a prophet and he shall pray for thee gen

so abraham prayed unto god and god healed abimelech
so then abimelech was healed by god as the supream and efficient cause by prayer as the instrumental
hence it is the son of sirach adviseth us my son in thy sickness be not negligent but pray unto the lord and he will make thee whole eccles


and also soon after sheweth us that the good success of physicians depends upon something beyond the sphaere of natural means and that is prayer unto the physician of physicians the lord omnipotent there is a time saith he when in their

hands the physicians there is good success for they shall also pray unto the lord that he would prosper that which they give for ease and remedy to prolong life ibidem

this excellent issue of devout prayer is further declared in these following instances
hezekiah being arrested by a violent and dangerous distemper for some arrears due to the great landlord of heaven and earth was further afflicted by a sad message of being turn'd out of the tenement of his body by death but by his humble supplication and mournful prayer unto his merciful lord he had a lease of his life granted him for
years subscribed with a promise according to god's own order and sealed with a miracle to confirm it further upon the dial of ahaz as you may see more fully by a recourse to the sacred text kings


have read that on a time there was a meeting appointed at haganaw upon the rhine where the reformed divines were to meet and in a friendly manner to

debate differences but as melancthon was going thitherward he fell sick at vinaria luther and cruciger hearing of it by long journeys hasted to him and as soon as luther saw how miserably he was wasted with his disease with sighs and tears he brake out into this speech alas how precious and profitable an instrument of the church is miserably weakened and ready to perish and therewithal falling upon his knees he prayed most earnestly for his recovery
and afterwards melancthon confessed that if luther had not come he had died clark's lives of the fathers

yea it is written of this luther that by his prayers he could prevail with god at his pleasure
praying for the recovery of myconius he let fall this transcendent rapture of daring faith fiat voluntas mea let my will be done and then comes off sweetly mea voluntas domine quia tua my will lord because thy will
beatus est qui habet quicquid vult nihil male vult blessed is he that hath what he will and wills nothing but what he should

also find recorded that the lady ann henage lying sick of a violent feaver which her physicians deemed to be mortal mr fox was sent for to be present at her ending and when by instructions and prayer he had prepared her for death he told her that she had done well in thus fitting her self for her dissolution yet that she should not die of that sickness
a knight her being by told him in private that he had not done well in thus discomposing her mind with hopes of life
to whom mr fox answered that he said no more then what was commanded him for it seemed good to god that she should recover
which also came to pass as an effect of fervent prayer which prevailed when natural means failed idem

king edward the sixth as he was constant and fervent in his private prayer so was he as successful therein witness this example sir john cheek his schoolmaster fell desperately sick of whose condition the king carefully enquired every day at last his physicians told him

that there was no hope of his life and that he was given over by them for a dead man
nay said the king he will not die at this time for this morning begged his life of god in my prayers and obtained it
which accordingly came to pass and soon after sir john beyond all expectation wonderfully recovered ful
history of the church

it is said of st augustin in a relation of his life that he was alwayes powerful in prayer so that sometimes thereby he cast out devils and sometimes restored sick men to their health

it would perhaps be tedious to the reader to annumerate any further instances to this purpose as by demonstrating what a wonderful decrease there hath been sometimes observed in the weekly bills of mortality in several places of this kingdom graciously succeeding upon the humble and devout prayers of god's people and therefore shall content my self to insist only upon st james his canon is any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over

him annointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he hath committed sins they shall be forgiven him james

by the elders of the church we may understand the pastors or ministers of the church who are to be sent for by the sick that they may pray for him and with him and their faithful prayer shall be a means ordinarily to save that sick person from the danger of his disease and whereas sins are the cause of his sickness even those sins of his shall upon humble and devout prayers be done away and forgiven

now as concerning the ceremony of anointing the sick body with oyl in the name of the lord this was an extraordinary thing communicated to those which had gifts of miracles used by them as an outward symbole and sign of the spiritual healing and so we deny not but it was an extraordinary temporary sacrament but now that miracles are ceased in the church still to retain the outward

sign is a vain supertitious imitation although st james his oil and the popish ointment do much differ see fulke on the rhem
test

again this usage as a bare ceremony was not instituted by christ or any way commanded to be continued by the apostles or their successors in the church even while the gifts of healing did continue amongst them but was by the apostles themselves very frequently omitted in their working of cures as the learned dr hammond hath observed in his annotations
prayer then you see was the more yea the only effectual and substantial performance or means in the cure and the ceremony of annointing may now reasonably be omitted
obj
but against the use of prayer some may object the words of job job

is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not his dayes also like the dayes of an hireling what need then of prayer when every man's time upon earth like the sea is bounded so as hitherto shall it come but no further

answer only hereunto at present that this may be a general objection against the use of all other means as well as prayer in relation to the cure of diseases and prolongation of life and therefore shall be answered in its proper place designed

a
object
against some lukewarm christians may object further and say have often prayed upon the account of health for my self and others in time of sickness but all my prayers have like arrows shot up to heaven returned upon my own head without doing their errand

solut
to this answer our prayers many times come short of heaven because they are not winged with zeal and importunity it is the importunate beggar that getteth an alms they that faint in their prayers have such a faint heart as never winneth a fair blessing
and therefore as a corroborative against such faintings let us consider how oft we use a medicine for the body before it can be whole how many stroaks on oak

must have before it will fall how over and over again we plough our lands and delve our gardens before we can have our expectation and also how frequently earthly kings must be attended upon before suiters can obtain their suite
surerely favours and mercies even from the king of kings would be slighted and undervalued if fetched with a faint word
and therefore let us vis unita fortior join force to force prayer to prayer and so by a holy violence of zeal besiege the kingdom of heaven and in time it will surrender its self to our lawful desires and requests
for saith the apostle the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much james

indeed if our prayers be without life or come out of fained lips or be distracted with wild and wandring thoughts or if they be tainted with hypocrisie pride or incredulity we can look for no favourable audience from heaven for god heareth not sinners but if a man doth his will him he heareth john

god heareth not sinners that is wilful presumptuous and impenitent sinners

but if a man doth his will by active and passive obedience him he heareth that is either explicitely by granting the individual or particular thing requested or interpretatively by granting that which is aequivalent or far better
now if a righteous man prayeth for health and a prolongation of his temporary life and god still continueth him upon his bed of sickness and within a short time by death giveth him eternal life in exchange for his temporary herein is no severe repulse or denyal but a more favourable audience more satisfactory concession and more princely donation
but you will urge that this last way of granting requests doth not fully answer the scope of the present point
hereupon must reply that though the return of our most faithful prayers must be determined and their success limited by the will of our heavenly father according to the words of christ jesus nevertheless not as will but as thou wilt matth


yet we must understand that it is the will and usual favour of the almighty

to grant the very things we desire and stand in need of commonly by means and herein chiefly and principally by faithful prayer which without natural means is often found more effectual then natural means without it
and to encourage us to make trial of such excellent means we have a promise from truth its self say unto you whatsoever things ye desire when ye pray believe that ye receive them and ye shall have them mark

and this brings me to propose or prescribe

in the third place faith as an excellent means conducing likewise to the health of body and consequently prolongation of life and this in a way also
there was a woman vexed with an uncomfortable disease twelve years she suffered many things of physicians mat

some torturing her with one medicine some with another none did her good but much hurt she had spent all her living upon them luke

and herein saith erasmus was bis misera her sickness brought her to weakness

weakness to physick physick to beggary beggary to contempt
thus was she vexed in body mind and estate yet faith healed her
her wealth was gone physicians gave her over but her faith did not forsake her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole mat

there was a woman bowed down with the spirit of infirmity eighteen years luke

yet loosed
there was a man bedrid eight and thirty years john


a long and miserable time when besides his corporal distress he might perhaps conceive from that eccl

he that sinneth before his maker let him fall into the hand of the physician that god had cast him away yet christ restored him
but may some say it is not mentioned that either of two last were cured by faith
answer that doubtless christ saw the seed of faith in them though it were but as a grain of mustardseed and so rewarded them accordingly

again we may instance in the samaritan whose leprosie though hard to cure yet faith was able to do it thy faith hath

made thee whole luke

but may some say it was not properly his faith but christ's vertue that cured him why then doth not christ say mea virtus and not tua sides my vertue not thy faith hath made thee whole true it is his vertue only cures but this is apprehended by man's faith
the miraculous cure was attributed to mans faith not as to the efficient cause for that was christ's divine vertue but as to the instrumental cause or means by which he apprehended and applyed to himself that divine power by which he was healed
thus in the place or instance in the of math
it is written that the woman which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years came behind jesus and touched the hem of his garment
for she said within her self if may but touch his garment shall be whole
and in mark

we read that when that diseased woman had touched him jesus knew in himself that vertue had gone out of him and he turned him about in the press and said who touched my clothes yet speaking

to the woman he mentioneth not his vertue but her faith daughter thy faith hath made thee whole mark


object
but here some may object that the gifts of healing with other miraculous gifts are ceased in the church and so consequently prayer and faith must needs be ineffectual to the cure of bodily distempers without the conjunction of natural means

answ
to which answer tis true the doctrine of the gospel having been long since sealed and confirmed by so many miracles in the primitive church there is now the less need of them more particularly of the gift of healing and therefore shall not urge those miracles which the church of rome boasteth of as wrought of late times by some of her sons or with her extend the promise of our saviour mark to all future times and ages of the church yet thus much may avouch that as god is still able to work miracles so he hath sometimes even in this latter age wrought miraculously for the convincing the present

times of atheism and the further confirmation of our faith in the gospel
and this mr valentine greatraks in his printed letter to the honourable robert boyle esq maketh appear wherein he giveth an account of divers strange cures by himself performed as the instrument
whereunto are annexed about sixty testimonials of several credible persons most of them eminent and worthy of the chief matters of fact therein related
which printed certificates being examined and compared with the original testimonials which were left in the hands of mr starkey the stationer to that end namely for a certain evidence to mr boyle and for the full satisfaction of all those that are any wise scrupulous that they might see that they were verbatim the same in this respect
suppose it unreasonable to interrogate with nicodemus how can these things be john

seeing there is such a clear demonstration de facto of what was seen done

confess saith a learned modern author of our own cannot see any reason

why god may not yet for the conviction if insidels employ such a power of miracles although there be not such necessity of it as there was in the first propagation of the gospel yet god may please saith he a little after out of his abundant provision for the satisfaction of the minds of men concerning the truth of christian doctrine to imploy good men to do something which may manifest the power of christ to be above the devils dr stillingfleet's origines sacrae pag
to be short as our saviour being in the flesh had power on earth to cure incurable diseases miraculously that is without natural means so being in heaven his power is no less but rather greater over all bodily diseases to cure them with or without means whensoever he will
so that this may comfort us in time of dangerous sickness though our disease be incurable by physick or any natural means yet in this case we are to remember the absolute power of christ jesus our lord who can heal us without means if he see it expedient for us and that his will doth in this case frequently concur with

his power note further that man's extremity is god's opportunity where man's help faileth christ's help beginneth
let us then seek to him by prayer and rest on him by faith not neglecting ordinary means by a too frequent dependance upon or expectation of miraculous cures nor yet forgetting that if the means fail or cannot be had his power is not tied to means but is above them and can and doth sometimes recover us without them when he seeth it good for us
conclude the point then thus that gods blessing upon the natural means and his blessing without means are each received most successfully and comfortably by the hand of faith which is the extraordinary means conducing to the health of body as the ordinary to the health of soul

fourthly repentance if true and sincere doth in the same extraordinary way conduce to the health of body and prolongation of life
and this may be proved first in express terms and secondly by consequence

first in express terms by sundry texts of sacred writ
miriam by repentance was freed from the leprosie num



the israelites repenting obtained a remedy against the fiery serpents and thereby were delivered from imminent death
david after the death of seventy thousand of his people by repentance prevented the destruction of jerusalem sam


rehoboam and the princes repenting at the preaching of shemaiah were delivered from destruction chr

hezekiah having received a message of death upon his repentance had his life lengthened by a lease from above two lives more in our law isay




secondly by consequence
for sublatâ causâ tollitur effectus the cause which is sin being taken away the effect which is bodily sickness and shortness of life as have fully declared and evinced in the former part of this treatise must needs cease and be removed or prevented and avoided
and therefore repentance as you see may rationally be concluded effectual for the health of the body and the

prolongation of a temporary life as it was alwayes granted propitious to the health of the soul in order to ever lasting life

to summ up all let us not think it incredible that these vertues and graces should in such an extraordinary manner conduce to the preservation of bodily health removal of sickness and prolongation of life when we consider the power of god with whom all things are possible mat

and the manifestation of that power not only in the sundry miraculous cures of bodily diseases recorded in the old and new testament but also in some such cures or very like them taken notice of in our modern history and experience
the miraculous cures in both testaments the reader may take notice of at his leasure shall instance now only in humane story and modern evidence

a late intelligent author and faithful relator telleth us that to the kings of england quatenus kings doth appertain one prerogative that may be stiled if not miraculous which was

first enjoyed by that pious and good king edward the confessor that is to remove and to cure the struma or scrofula that stubborn disease called the kings evil
which manifest cure saith he is ascribed by some malignant nonconformists to the power of fancy and exalted imagination but what can that contribute to small infants whereof great numbers are cured every year dr chamberlain in his present state of england
the manner of the cure is briefly thus related there is an appointed short form of divine service wherein are read besides some short prayers pertinent to the occasion two portions of scripture taken out of the gospel and at these words they shall lay

their hands on the sick and they shall recover
the king gently draws both his hands over the sore of the sick person and those words are repeated at the touch of every one

again at these words

that light was the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world
pertinently used if it be considered that that light did never shine more comfortably if not more visibly than in the healing of so many leprous and sick persons
at those words the king putteth about the neck of each sick person a piece of gold called from the impression an angel because in value about two thirds of a french pistol
thus far he

now the effect is clear de facta and from experience and cannot therefore be rationally denyed and tis as clear that the cause must be in regard that neither the hands of the king not the piece of gold given by him have any natural or accidental power or tendency in themselves to effect or produce such a cure especially in infants whose imagination cannot be wrought upon and disposed for the furtherance of it by such outward applications as are then used

another instance to our present purpose we may find in a modern collection being true and faithful relation of one samuel

wallas who was restored to his perfect health after thirteen years sickness of a consumption taken from his own mouth who for the last four years lay and so weak that he could not turn himself therein without help by which distemper his body was so parched and dried that he was almost like a sceleton but upon this cure he recovered his former health and strength whereby he was enabled to follow his trade being a shoomaker and living at stamford in lincolnshire whereof he gave a large account to which must refer you for further satisfaction with much affection and sensibleness of the lord's mercy and goodness to him upon april

now the story as it is at large being much noised abroad divers ministers met together at stamford to consider and consult about it and for many reasons were induced to believe that the cure was wrought by the ministry of a good angel clark's mirror vol


more such instances as these might be inferred and exhibited to the reader but

suppose those already mention'd are a full demonstration of god's omnipotent power that he can work without means and also of his distinguishing mercy that he sometimes doth so for the benefit welfare and encouragement of the godly who are made either administrators or receivers of this gift of bodily health
and this may more fully appear if we consider that edward the confessor as dr peter heylin's cosmog noteth was a man of that holiness in his life that he received power from above to cure many diseases besides the kings evil and that samuel wallas was cured chiefly by observing the supposed angel's injunction in these words but above all whatsoever thou doest fear god and serve him as it is recorded in the story to which referred
the consideration of which instances doth assure us that god's children have in a manner been sometimes agents and sometimes patients in bodily cures and by consequence may be so still

and as touching longaevity the time

would fail me to tell of noah abraham isaac jacob joseph moses aaron phineas grandchild of aaron joshua job elizeus the prophet isaiah the prophet tobias the elder and tobias the younger old simeon anna the prophetess st john the evangelist simeon the son of cleoph as called the brother of our lord and bishop of hierusalem polycarpus disciple unto the apostles and bishop of smyrna dionisius areopagita contemporary unto the apostle st paul aquila and priscilla first st paul the apostle's hosts afterward his and some others whom could name who by ancient record appear all severally excepting simeon that was the prophet luke
and st john the evangelist to have survived an hundred years and this not so much through strength of nature as the extraordinary grace of god thus rewarding their moral and christian vertues

now to conclude this chapter though we are not to depend wholly upon spiritual means and assistances for bodily health and length of dayes

yet we must principally and chiefly respect them being as hinges upon which almighty god doth frequently turn the course of nature
for in him as the apostle citeth it out of aratus the poet we live and move and have our being acts

and job testifieth as much when he saith have sinned what shall do unto thee thou preserver of men job

job knew as well as paul that the wages of sin was death and having sinned how should he avoid that death but by addressing himself to god who is the preserver of men without him there is no balm in gilead sufficient jer

no physician there that is able to recover the health of the people
which is true as well in a natural as in a metaphorical sense
hezekiah lump of figs may be a soveraign plaister but the prolonging of his life came from god the waters of bethesda were in themselves likewise very soveraign but it was after they were moved by the angel from heaven
we may yea we must use all honest and good means to preserve this our tabernacle of clay from ruin and dilapidation say we

must thankfully embrace the good means which nature or art can minister unto us for the preservation or recovery of health the skill and experience of the judicious physician may be made use of and though it were job complaint that there were many physicians of no value job

and though such as these be mention'd with ignominy in the gospel that instead of taking away the poor womans superfluous blood they had sucked away her necessary maintenance she had spent all that she had and was nothing bettered but rather grew worse mark

say though such unskilful empiricks be mention'd with infamy as deserving reverence or reward from none but a sexton who finds most of his employment from such physicians desperate unskilfulness yet those of skill and experience and of conscience are worthy of a double honour of reward maintenance
luke the able and beloved physician deserves a remembrance in st paul catalogue col

and such a physicians skill may be made use of with good success
but yet in the use of secondary means this proviso

must go along we must ascribe the main honour to god for it is from him that health springeth forth speedily as is hinted to us by the prophet isa

let them therefore who want health together with an honest use of the means address themselves with hezekiah unto god who is the fountain of health and he will hear their prayers see their tears and grant them either that which they desire or that which he knoweth in his alwise providence to be better for them

and for us that do enjoy the blessing of health let us return our humble thanks unto god
the living the living they shall praise thee as we do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth isa

and we cannot praise him better then in the words of our church to thee god who hast redeemed our souls from the jaws of death we offer unto thy fatherly goodness our selves our souls and bodies which thou hast delivered to be a living sacrifice unto thee to thee which doest restore the voice of joy and health into our dwellings we offer the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving

lauding and magnifying thy glorious name for such thy preservation providence over us through jesus christ our lord
amen
vid the two last forms of thanksgiving

shewing that vertuous and regular actions and affections do naturally conduce to the health of body and length of life

a life led in religion as the lord verulam in his history of life and death noteth seemeth to conduce to long life
there are in this kind of life these things leisure admiration contemplation of heavenly things joyes not sensual noble hopes wholesom fears sweet sorrows lastly continual renovations by observances penances expiations all which saith he are very powerful to long life
unto which if we add that austere diet which hardneth the mass of the body and humbleth the spirits no marvel if an extraordinary length of life do follow

such as was that of paul the hermite simeon stilita the columna anchorite and of many other hermites and anchorites
now hereunto may add that by the same rule or reason that such a life doth conduce to long life it doth likewise become propitious to bodily health
more particularly and plenarily these following graces and vertues religious acts and dispositions are to be considered as effectual in some measure to the end designed

first faith as it is attended with a confidence of recovery hath naturally a powerful influence upon the body for confidence as galen saith doth more good then physick and this it doth through the strength of imagination
now such is the force of imagination and a man's conceit in working effects in the body that hippocrates exhorteth physicians if two kinds of meat were to be ministred to a patient the one healthful and the other a little hurtful or not so good as the other that they should prefer this being much desired before that not so well liked and generally both philosophers

and physicians maintain that the opinion and confidence of the patient importech much for the cure of any maladie
the reason is plain for the imagination herein though erroniously conceiving things better then indeed and really they are causeth a vehement passion of hope wherewith followeth an extraordinary pleasure in the things which two passions awake or rouse up the purer spirits and unite them together qualifying and refining them in the best manner which thus combined do most effectually with nature and strengthen her in the performance of any corporal action or vital operation in order to the mastery and expulsion of noxious humours
which brings me to say somewhat

in the second place of hope which of all the passions is most advantagious for health and long life in regard the spirits therein which corroborate and quicken all the parts are moderate she stops and keeps them back that they cannot dissipate nor make any vehement agitation for if the spirits be too active and violent

in their operations they may produce strong actions but it shortens our dayes because those spirits easily scatter and so consume the natural moisture which hope useth not to do because say it keeps the spirits in a temperate motion and preserves them from wasting too fast
therefore as the lord verulam saith they which fix propound to themselves some end as the mark and scope of their life and continually and by degrees go forward in the same are for the most part in so much that when they are come to the top of their hope and can go no higher therein they commonly droope and live not long after
we may add hereunto that this may be one reason why kings soveraign princes are not commonly so as others because they have fewer things to hope for and more things to fear

now if hope in general as it is a passion of the soul be so effectual in this kind much more is true christian hope which is at anchor upon more firm ground in as much as the object thereof is more sure certain and more durably satisfactory

and delightful cherishing and encouraging then can be fix'd upon in the alone expectation of any terrene temporal enjoyment

thirdly love which is the sense it may be understood a duty often inculcated in sacred writ and is custos utriusque tabulae the fulfilling of the law rom

is also by reason of that strict tye between the soul and body a great promoter of bodily health for it is observed by an eminent modern philosopher that when this affection is alone that is when it is not accompanied with extream joy desire or sadness the beating of the pulse is even and much greater and stronger than ordinary that a man feels a gentle heat in his breast and quick digestion of meat so that this passion is profitable for the health mr in his treatise of the passion of the soul artic

and now proceed to another passion which being managed with wisdom will alwayes be found in the track of vertue

fourthly joy being regulated and moderated by its reason and sanctified

by the holy spirit is a gracious disposition alwayes seasonable in a christian course rejoyce evermore saith the apostle thess


yea alwayes seasonable because alwayes healtful to soul and body to the body in this respect namely because by dilating and sending forth to the outward parts it enlivens them and keeps them fresh and active it beautifies the complexion preventeth consumptions and some other distempers by assisting the distribution of salubrious nourishment to every part

from these considerations then we may understand that christianity doth not teach us a stoical apathie or take away our passions but only rectifies them and being thus rectified they conduce not only to the health of the soul but also of the body and its longaevity

fifthly labour industry and diligence in a lawful calling is no less healthful to the body then soul
for as by the old sanction we are taught to labour for our bread gen

in the sweat of thy face shalt

thou eat bread yea as paradise that was man's was also his workhouse he was put into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it gen

as also by the fourth commandment it is implied as a duty that we should labour six dayes and do all that we have to do lastly as a provident industrious and seasonable care and employment is so good and warrantable that in this very thing the wise man prescribeth the pismire prov

for our imitation and in this the apostle placeth not only necessity thess


but also religion tim


so is the same very commendable in respect of bodily health it being the salt of humane life which drieth up those crudities which otherwise would prove offensive and preserveth the humours from putrefaction
yea the commodities of moderate excerise are many principally these following


the increase of natural heat and spirit

it assists the distribution of our nourishment


it discusses vapours and fuliginous excrements by the pores or spiracles of the skin and adds colour and vivacity to the whole body


it makes the juices of the body hard and compact and so becomes propitious to length of life


and lastly by consuming and exiccating superfluous moistures in the body it preventeth most diseases so that indigent people as one observeth have this recompence to their poverty that their necessitated labours keep them much in health and without the need trouble and charge of physick
may add hereunto that active and industrious persons be they poor or rich as they are longest free from diseases so also most commonly from the long continuance of those diseases the material cause thereof being consumed in such manner by former labour and exercise as there wants sufficient iewel to maintain the distemper which like the external fire soon dieth and is extinct for want of nourishment and thereby nature in its sphaere the greatest

agent in bodily cures being exonerated of obnoxious humours is ever in a tendency to reduce the body into its pristine and symmetrical constitution

moreover it hath been observed that epidemical diseases as pestilential feavers cathars small pox flux do much easier seise upon such as by contracting an evil habit of body through a sedentary and idle course of life have rendred themselves more obnoxious and disposed thereunto in whom likewise they are more difficultly cured

and now before conclude this point would in kindness admonish those of the foeminine and teeming sex that they would accustome themselves to moderate exercise to diligence and industrie in some lawful and commendable employment thereby to preserve their health and facilitate their delivery
for it is observed that those women which are used to labour endure with far more ease and the irish women because of their stirring and active lives are quick in delivery and here in england

also the industrious laborious women in city and country are very quick at their labours and allow themselves a very short retirement comparatively with others of a contrary inclination so that in this particular also the active and stirring life is of no small advantage

conclude with the wholesom advice of syrach my son hear me and despise me not and at the last thou shalt find as told thee in all thy works be quick so shall there no sickness come unto thee eccl


sixthly temperanco a fruit of the spirit gal


and a vertue here considerable only as it consisteth in the moderation or regulation of the appetite in eating and drinking according to the standard of nature which is content with a little is of all vertues the most conducible to bodily health and long life
that saying of the wise man it is not good to eat much honey prov

sheweth unto us that even the most wholesom and nourishing meat of all other will prove dangerous and hurtful to our health if it be not soberly and measurably eaten

temperance as one saith being not only the carver but also the commander at our tables should alwayes have a room thereat
timotheus having supped with plato and eaten contrary to his custom very moderately slept very quietly that night finding neither cholick to awake him nor belchings in the morning to annoy him wherefore as soon as he awaked he brake forth into this exclamation with a loud voice how sweet how sweet are plato's suppers which make us in the night time to sleep and in the morning to breath so sweetly marsil
fic de sanis slud tu yea the benefits of temperance are many


freedom from almost all sicknesses

length of life and death without much pain

a mitigation of incurable diseases

instances of these or some of these there are not a few in history
socrates is said by sobriety to have had alwayes a strong body and to have lived ever in health and that by the good order of his diet he escaped the plague at athens never avoiding the city nor the company

of the infected though the greatest part of the city was consumed by it aelian lib
it is also reported of galen that famous physician that he lived one hundred and fourty years and that after he was twenty eight years old he was never grieved with any sickness except the grudge of a feaver for one day his rule was not to eat or drink till he had an appetite nor to eat and drink till he had none
this rule he observing was seldom sick and lived as sipontinus writeth to the abovesaid age

cyprian relates that maximinian the emperour seldom used to drink betwixt meals and therefore lived in health to the end of his life

queen elizabeth was famous for this vertue
king edward the sixth called her by no other name then his sweet sister temperance cambd
eliz
she did seldom eat but one sort of meat rose ever with an appetite and lived about seventy years which is beyond the ordinary period of princes and princesses who seldom attain to summ up experimentally moses his arithmetick

in that psalm psal

appropriated to him

we read that the sect of the esseans amongst the jews did usually extend their lives to an hundred years now that sect used a single or abstenious diet after the rule of pythagoras
metaphrastes in the life of saint john writes that he was so abstenious in the use of meats and drinks that he took no more then would suffice to maintain life he lived as ancient record mentions ninety three years
st paul the hermite lived an hundred and thirteen years now his diet was so slender and strict that it was thought almost impossible to support humane nature therewith

but most memorable is that of cornarus the venetian who being in his youth of a sickly body began first to eat and drink by measure to a certain weight thereby to recover his health this cure turned by use into a diet that diet to an extraordinary long life even of an hundred years and better without any decay

in his senses and with a constant enjoying of his health

tis a common proverb which were it commonly observed would make most physicians sick and preserve their patients a long time sound use mederation and temperance and desie the physician
a saying that taken with a grain of allowance doth favour much of truth though little of urbanity
no less observable is that proverbial rithme
gulaepone metas ut sit longior tibi aetas
which may thus be englished

to thy appetite set some timely bounds for so the longer age to thee redounds

that intemperance is the extinguisher and temperance the prolonger of the candle of our life was long ago taken notice of by the son of sirach in these words be not unsatiable in any dainty thing nor too greedy upon meats eccles

latter part

for excess of meats bringeth sickness and surfetting will turn into choler

by surfetting have many perished but he that taketh heed prolongeth his life

temperance then as may be gathered from the preceding instances is not only instead of preventive but also curative physick
for as many by intemperance have relapsed into their old distempers so by temperance some have dispossess'd their lingring maladies and recovered their former state of health and therefore the best physicians do alwayes remember to prescribe to their patients a temperate diet for the accomplishment of their cures as knowing that temperance alone proves commonly more effectual to that end than all their prescriptions and applications without it
for it is to be understood that the perfect cuting of the diseased body requireth not only the external but also the internal physician
the internal physician vulgarly is called nature but more properly it is that interna mumia seu balsamum internum our native liquor of life and inbred

balm of vital spirit
this in all men is the best and greatest physician without the which no medicine can avail no malady can be cured
this is that which doth digest concoct maturate deopilate purge corroborate expel emitigate restore avert and dispatch all sort of bodily griefs unless it be by intemperance or extreamly debilitated by any other impediment or defect
the outward or external physician with all his art method simples compounds antidotes catharticks minoratives diaphoreticks corroboratives anodynes is only but a servant and all his endeavours but service unto the internal physician viz nature
as then in curative physick the principal method of wise physicians whose canon is cito tuto suddenly and safely consists in purgation and corroboration thereby first disburdening and then strengthening nature which in its operations hath a constant tendency to the more benigne constitution so long as it is able to resist the morbifick humour so temperance which consisteth in the

use of a temperate diet no way burdening nature which not will in time work out the noxious and superfluous humours but gradually strengthening it may worthily be esteemed a great promoter of health though not so expeditious as when it is conjoined with the assistance of external means
by temperance alone then it may seem probable to effect a cure and experience hath put it out of doubt that many who have been unwilling or unable to undergo the trouble and charge of physick have yet by the strength of nature and a temperate diet in a reasonable time safely recovered their former health
aurelianus is said to have cured all excess by abstinence and therefore to have had no physicians
and read of the indians and other barbarous people who wanting or at least neglecting the means of physick have yet many of them by temperance giving nature its free course recovered of dangerous diseases and also attained to a great age
yea legimus quosdam sayes an ancient father st hierome morbo articulari podagrae

humoribus laborantes proscriptione bonorum ad simplicem mensam pauperes cibos redactos convaluisse we have read of some saith he who being sick of the gout through abundance of humours did recover their health being forced to a poor and slender diet by consiscation of their goods

not that hereby would derogate from the honour due unto the judicious physician or detract from the use of medicines which the lord hath created out of the earth for he that is wise will not abhor them saith the son of sirach eccl

but at present my design is only to enhance the price and esteem of temperance which doubtless is the mother of health though it often stands in need of the midwisery of natural means to assist it in its productions

to temperance may be referred fasting which when it is religious is thus desined
jejunium religiosum est voluntaria abstinentia cibo potu religionis causà hommius disput religious fasting is a voluntary abstinence from meat and drink for a religious end and thus understood our saviour christ supposed it as a duty

sometimes to be performed when he gave directions to avoid in it mat

and also assured us that if it be performed as it ought not to please men but god it will surely be rewarded by him
this duty he taught us by his own example as well as doctrine for not to mention divine record so well known to most philo saith of him that he seemed to transform his flesh into the nature of his spirit by fasting and watching
and in imitation of christ's act in fasting we read elsewhere that the christians of the primitive times were generally very frequent in the practise of it

now though this religious fasting differeth from that which is moral in respect of the ends moral fasting being nothing else but temperance and moderation in eating drinking yet in respect of the natural effect produced in the body they are the same and do equally conduce to bodily health and consequently length of life not only as preventive but also curative physick

first as preventive and this will appear by this following demonstration deducted from the observation of the most

judicious physicians
the deflux of an humour from the brain is called a rheume which is the mother of most diseases
for sometimes it taketh course to the eyes and thereof cometh a dropping and inflamation of the eyes and a dimness and loss of sight sometimes it taketh course by the nose and is called the pose sometimes to the mouth and causeth great expuition and spitting and the falling of the uvula and sometimes to the and thereof cometh raucedo the hoarsness sometimes to the lungs and causeth exulceration or putrifaction or some great obstruction which bringeth a difficulty of breathing and strangulation sometimes it taketh course by the stomack and causeth lack of appetite and ill digestion and if to the guts then falleth out the flux of the belly called a lask sometime it setleth in the brain and groweth into a gross and thick substance either in the fore part as in the nerves optick which are the conducts whereby the power of seeing doth come unto the eyes and causeth either dimness or loss of sight

or in the conducts that convey the power of hearing unto the ears and there causeth a dulness of hearing or deafness also if it settle in the obstructing the cells or of the brains three ill diseases do grow thereupon called three of the dead sleeps caros coma apoplexia
also if this gross rheumatick matter do settle in the hinder part it causeth the lethargy another of the dead sleeps and the palsy and the fallingsickness and the convulsion and oblivion or loss of memory
and if it come down backward into the neck it causeth a kind of convulsion called teranos when as the neck cannot turn to nor fro but it standeth stiff and stark without motion
if it flow down to the back it causeth another kind of convulsion called opisthotonos wherein the head and the heels are made to meet backward
if it flow forward into the muscles of the breast another convulsion is caused called emprosthotonos wherein the head and the feet are drawn together forward
if it go to the joynts it is morbus articularis

the if to the hands and fingers it is chiragra the if to the knees it is gonagra the if to the feet and toes it is podagra the
also if it fall upon the kidnies then the disease is nephritical as the stone or gravel in the reins
thus from the brain the fountain of nerves is derived that morbifick humour which is the sourse of these and many other diseases but to obstruct and prevent the current thereof there is need of fasting and abstinence from excess
for whereas many a man complaineth of his brain for sending down rheumes the springs and foundation of all dangerous maladies the brain as charron saith may answer him desine fundere ego desinam fluere cease to pour in and will cease to pour out

fasting then by consequence is an especial prevention of most diseases and it may be further proved and illustrated by this following instance
a certain person lately living in the county of norfolk and well known to the author did in the presence of a physician give god

thanks that for the space of sixty years he never knew experimentally what it was to feel three dayes sickness together worthy complaining of
whereupon being requested by the inquisitive physician to discover the means he used for such a continued preservation of his health he returned this following account
fast often saith he but then especially when find the least indisposition of body for then in such a neutral or rather sickly constitution abstain from all usual sustenance excepting timothy allowance a little wine for my stomack sake two three or more dayes until find that nature works off the matter and fuel of approaching diseases
upon which single instance we may ground this observation that abstinence and fasting so long as it is not in excess but from excess is an especial preventive or preservative against most diseases by attenuating those vicious humours which are heaped together through continual crudities in a manner digesting and wasting them and also by that means hastening

the circulation of the blood and then promoting and facilitating the distribution of the nourishable juice it renders the whole body pervious and open dischargeth obstructions discusseth wind moveth the excrements of the brain and all the parts and brings them down into passages thorow which by the extimulating force of nature they are expelled out of the body

secondly it may be considered as curative and this upon the same or the like grounds and reasons whereby it hath been asserted as preventive and therefore there needs no repetition to confirm the point
but by way of illustration we may take notice that the ancient egyptians cured their diseases either by fasting or vomiting which they used either daily or every third or fourth day for they were of opinion that all diseases had their beginning from surfeiting and repletion and that therefore that is the best physick to recover health which taketh away the cause of the disease

moreover read that the sweatingsickness

proper to our english countries at first esteemed incurable was sithence experienced to be cured by the cheapest way of the world even by abstinence alone and that in ireland they cure their agues only with fasting four or five dayes from all kinds of meats leaving nature alone to spend out those superfluous humours which the moisture of their western air breathed into them

it is reported that a certain poor man having the dropsie did earnestly entreat the physician for a remedy of his disease the physician beholding the poor man said merrily to him per annum abstine potu sanaberis abstain from drink one year and thou shalt be a sound man
the poor man took it as seriously spoken and performed it though with much thirst and being made perfectly sound at the years end he returned to the physician and gave him thanks for his advice vid cornel
a lapide in lucam pag

in a word and to instance in our selves or acquaintance how ordinary it is for

some constitutions to fast away or starve an ague the palsy the sickness of the stomack the dropsie gout and some other distempers arising from repletion shall leave to the determination of such as probably by experience may hereto affix their probatumest

and now before conclude this point it must not be forgotten what was in the former part of this treatise suspended and reserved for this place namely a more plenary resolution of this enquiry how may we confine our selves within the bounds and limits of temperance in performance whereof we must make use of the advice of the most judicious and experienced physicians who teach us not to approve as to general practise of that arithmetical proportion or dieta statica the allotment of a certain weight and measure of meat and drink not upon any terms to be exceeded because this were to go about to make a coat for the moon or to fit every foot with the same shoo
for how can it be but that where there is difference in constitution

age sex the manner of life the nature of the meat and the season of the year and so diversities of heat and ability to concoct and digest a different proportion should also be requisite leaving therefore the strictness of lessius and cornaro to speculative and monastick men shall prescribe two general rules of temperance which in a practical observation may well enough suit and agree with all sorts of persons

the first rule is that of hippocrates undefined span alphabet they that study their health must not be satisfied with meat
but as avicen otherwise expresses it must rise from the table cum famis reliquiis with the remainder of their hunger by this means as a modern author of our own saith dr brook's conservatory of health the stomack will well overcome and digest what it hath received and the remainder of thy appetite will be better imployed in perfecting thy digestion

the second rule is that thou takest so much of the creature as after it not to be disabled in the performances of holy

duties or in the duties of following thy vocation for he that gluts his appetite with so much food as thereby to hinder the clearer operation of the fancy the understanding and the memory and finds in himself a certain kind of dulness and heaviness in his spirit which before was quick and active may know for certain that he hath exceeded the bounds of temperance and perverted the end of feeding which is to refresh the strength and powers of the body
if therefore thou transgressest in this point let thy abstinence be the greater and thy care and circumspection doubled at thy succeeding meals

by these two rules alone may we learn to know the bounds and limits of temperance though in respect of its full praise there can be no bounds for it can never be sufficiently commended which in such a superlative sense is so advantagious to the health both of body and soul
and therefore shall put a period to this point by referring the reader for his further satisfaction to the excellent treatises

of lessius and cornaro who have written large encomiums of this vertue of temperance

lastly might instance in the reading of good books in the good society of friends their honest and wholesom discourses exhortatory and consolatory in time of sickness which are very commendable and agreeable to sacred writ and so more largely shew that these very things as seneca saith medicinae vim habuerunt have the vertue of physick et quicquid animum erexit etiam corpori prodest whatever hath raised and comforted the mind hath also been profitable to the body seneca epist

and also might by many examples illustrate these things more especially by that of alphonsus king of naples who being abandoned of his physicians as in a desperate case and calling for quintus curtius took such delight to hear him read that he recovered his health again obtaining that by a little consolation and delight which could not be procured by physick
but to avoid prolixity shall here desist and conclude

the whole chapter having as suppose sufficiently proved and demonstrated that vertuous and regular actions and affections do naturally conduce to the health of body and length of life

chap
iv

shewing that vertuous and regular actions and affections do through the blessed influence of divine providence upon means prove often occasions of bodily health and long life

it is the duty of a christian to depend upon god in his providential administrations for happy is that people whose god is the lord psal

and this happiness consisteth partly in that degree of peculiar providence which respecteth the temporal salvation and preservation of the children of god from imminent dangers more particularly those of mortal diseases and sudden death and also in the ordination and disposition of means

in order to the recovery of bodily health and the proroguing of life
and though there be swarms of contingencies that might be thought to hinder the success of means yet divine providence for the welfare of the righteous so hiveth them and disposeth of them in such order as they unite and combine together to produce the honey of health and long life
for it must be understood that as sometimes for the punishment of sin the hand of providence may be seen in rendering the means used for health successless a colledge of physicians being physicians of no value when and where the lord the great physician withdraws his manutenancy or succeeding hand of providence witness this in asa chr

who had his physicians but not his cure so sometimes the same providence for the encouragement of the godly is displayed in raising persons from the graves mouth and recovering them when mortally sick in the judgment of the most accurate physicians and this sometimes by bringing to light such

means which are very improbable to man's reason though very proper for the recovery of the patient who like epaphroditus was sick nigh unto death but god had mercy on him phil


also sometimes it is displayed in a fortunate concurrence of all needful contingencies in order to the end here designed which some call the blessing upon the means as namely when god by the method of his providence putteth it into the heart of the patient or some friend about him if the disease be dangerous to make a timely and seasonable address to a judicious and experienced physician whose heart is providentially as it were inspired and his memory prompted with such seasonable adaequate and proper prescriptions as by the patients observation thereof together with the use of other means represented to the mind by the hints and intercourse of the same providence become very advantagious to health and long life
in this respect though chiefly in a spiritual suppose that of the apostle holds good all things work together for good to

them that love god rom

and that which the wise man attesteth is no less true the preparations of the heart in man and the answer of the tongue is from the lord prov

also a man's heart deviseth his way but the lord directeth his steps vers

likewise the peculiar distinguishing providence of god in the preservation of the lives of his children is seen thorow the glass of these following instances

the king of israel a wicked person disguiseth himself and hath his armour kings
yet an arrow finds its passage between the joints of his harness on the other hand jehoshaphat king of judah a good king who was in the same fight and in greater danger than king ahab is preserved it came to pass saith the text when the captains of the chariots saw jehoshaphat in his royal robes they said it is the king of israel therefore they compassed about him to fight
but jehoshaphat cried out and the lord helped him and god moved them to depart from him chron


how often did saul hunt david life as

yea though saul had hedged him in round about and gotten him in such a snare as there was but a little distance betwixt david and death yet saul could not accomplish his designs providence by way of diversion had procured another the philistines had invaded the land wherefore saul saith the scripture returned from pursuing after david and went against the philistines sam

yet how often did the lord preserve his life by a happy concurrence of providential contingencies and casualties when the jews went about to kill him their design was ineffectual and paul giveth the reason

thereof saying having therefore obtained help of god continue unto this day acts

which place hath reference to another where it is recorded that as they went about to kill paul tidings came unto the chief captain of the band that all jerusalem was in an uproar who immediately took souldiers and centurions and ran down unto them and when they saw the chief captain and the souldiers they left beating of paul chap

an admirable example of god's good providence who delighted to reserve his hand for a dead lift to rescue and save those that are forsaken of their hopes yea sometimes even by the hands of such a person as had no such intention as we may see in the following words vers
again we read in another place chap
of a combination of above forty conspiratours who had bound themselves with direful curses that they would eat nothing until they had killed paul but providence revealed the plot and conspiracy to paul sisters son and a sweet providence it was that this boy should be by to detect and defeat their

wicked counsel whereby paul escaped as a bird out of the snare
austin relates how by losing his way as he was travelling he thereby saved his life escaping an ambush of the bloody donatists who had waylaid him

the stories are well known how moulin at the time of the parisian massacre was cherished for a fortnight by a hen which came constantly and laid her eggs there where he lay hid
and at cales how an who crept into a hole under a pair of stairs was there preserved by means of a spider which had woven its web over the hole and so the souldiers slighted the search in that place
no less remarkable is the signal preservation of those vertuous and religious potentates queen elizabeth king james and our now gracious soveraign charles the second thorow an ocean of dangers by that discreet pilot divine providence

all which instances are a sufficient comment upon this text he that is our god is the god of salvation and unto god the lord belong the issues from death psal



and the result of the whole point is this that as man liveth not by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god mat

that is to say as bread though ordinarily it hath a nourishing property inhaerent in it for the sustaining of man's life yet so only as that the operation of that and success of other means tending to the preservation of health and prolongation of life is guided by the power of god's providence and appointment so the sweet influence of this providence is chiefly and principally intended and extended to the children of god in blessing the means used by them to that end and purpose
therefore are those sacred texts prescribed as corroboratives to the servants of god and ye shall serve the lord your god and he shall bless thy bread and thy water and will take sickness away from the midst of thee exod

also are not two sparrows sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father
fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows mat

if then

the eye of god's providence be so watchful to defend and preserve the meanest of his creatures that sparrows which are so cheap and worthless and also such birds as naturalists observe shall not perish or die without the permission and concurring will of god in second causes then surely we must not asperse our saviour's logick by denying the inference from sparrows to the children of god seeing this is the scope of the argument urged by our saviour in that place namely that if the eye of divine providence be so careful and circumspect in the preservation of the meanest creatures much more is the eye of the lord as david saith upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine psal

and thus much shall serve briefly to have demonstrated in general that vertuous and regular actions and affections do through the blessed influence of divine providence upon means prove often occasions of bodily health and long life

chap


some objections briefly answered
and the conclusion of the whole

obj
the first objection is of those who cry up an irresistible decree a fatal necessity predetermining the bounds of man's life and so consequently cry down the use of all means whether spiritual or natural as needless and frivolous in order to the preservation of health and prolongation of life and they bolster up their opinion with the forecited words of job by them wrested is there not an appointed time to man upon earth are not dis dayes also like the dayes of an hireling job

doubtless an error herein hath been very prejudicial not only to the physicians practice but also the patients health and lest it should likewise obstruct the good effect designed in this treatise we will not let it pass uncontrolled
for whosoever alloweth this

error must of necessity disallow the petition in the lord's prayer for our daily bread as also of all the divine prayers made for the prolongation of life and preservation from mortal danger or sudden death as likewise of the dispensation of the gift of healing to the physician whom god hath created and honoured to the same end and purpose and of all other means whatsoever tending to the temporal end and design of this discourse

answ
now in answer hereunto shall endeavour to unfold those texts of sacred writ wherein the main strength of the objection lieth as namely the forecited place and also that in the of job
seeing his dayes are determined the number of his moneths are with thee thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass
here then the words of job concerning the end of life limited set and appointed are not to be referred unto causes of destiny but to the obedience and disobedience of god's commandment
or we may more largely answer with some see piscator upon psal


marianus upon job

that the term of mans life is twofold




natural


as it is decreed from above in the and determination of god which doth not alwayes agree with the natural and thus as marianus saith a primâ die pendet extrema in ortu sanxit quantum quisque victurus est the last day depends upon the first and at our birth yea before we were conceived god hath concluded how long every man should live as he that as well the wayes that we would go as the end which those wayes would bring us to


natural which a man may attain unto by his natural strength unless he doth neglect the means or shorten his own dayes by some unlawful deeds and thus the godly may be said to prolong their dayes when by their upright life they have the assistance of the divine clemency to produce them to the furthest period that their natural strength could carry them so abraham lived to a good old age gen
and so divers

of god's saints became old men and full of years and on the contrary the wicked may be rightly said to shorten his dayes when for his impiety the divine hand of heaven doth abridge that ample time which he might have lived and when according as he determined from the beginning when he his wayes he doth measure his life with a shorter line then the strength of nature would have done so lascivious zimri was cut off for his sins in the midst of his age so the old world so the sodomites so the galileans so all those sinners that do provoke the hand of god to use the sword of justice to cut them off for their murders robberies and the like and so the wanton onans roaring duellers drunkards and all others that are loose in their lives and disorderly in their diets or behaviours may be said to be cut off each one of them in die non suo before his day that is before that day ad quem per naturam juxta hominum opinionem pervenire poterat to which nature in the judgment of all men might have brought him if

he had not prevented the same by his unseasonable death vel gladio vel morbo vel aliquâ aliâ causâ violentâ morte non sua either by the sword or disease or some other violent cause as mercerus saith mercerus in job


or if that answer sufficeth not consider this following god almighty who is the creator and conservator of all things in the universe hath appointed to every created thing both a beginning and end or termination of subsisting and moving and doth take notice not only of principal but also of subsequent causes of things governing moderating disposing and ordering them according to his free will and yet all this government is void of fatal violence and most commonly cometh to effect mediately and from deputed causes which vulgarly are called second causes which the divine majesty doth employ as the instruments of his will so long as he doth so govern all things which he hath created as also himself may suffer them to exercise their proper motions for the will of man by divine ordination is the

original of humane actions freely electing what seemeth best for it self especially in externalls and herein the causes so answer the effects as if the effects be necessary the causes are also necessary and if contingent the causes are contingent nor doth the praescience or of god which is certain and not to be deceived abolish the contingency of natural events but the future effect is disposed as it were by a divine providence necessarily or contingently nor doth it null the freedom of the agent nor is the creator obliged to the necessity but moderateth all things freely according to his free will and pleasure and though his omnipotency can dispose of causes and life with every kind of death at his own free pleasure yet it will not urge any person to accept that term of life for a fatal determinination but for a divine ordination of various causes which by the election of the will that as saith can never be constrained prove occasions either of sustaining or destroying life

in brief if still the curious objector remains dissatified wish him convinced potius verberibus quam verbis rather with stripes than stress of words and the indicative story which have read of may apologize for me in my optative mood
a discontented gallant having drowned himself and being much lamented by the spectators for youthful comliness amongst them was one of this erronious opinion who was pleased to read a lecture to them of the inevitable decree of the almighty and not by him to be avoided nor by them lamented
hereupon a young man of the contrary education gave her a great blow over the face which made her challenge him of base cowardise and as great incivility to the feminine sex who returned her in answer that it was the inevitable will of god it should be so and a truth according to her own doctrine which caused her to stagger in her opinion
let us not then scorn the means for as solomon saith judgments are prepared for scroners and stripes for the back of fools prov


obj
another objection is of those whom we call nativitycasters and who by birthstars that is by stars which arise at every ones coming into the world pretend an infallible prediction of the certain time of their health sickness recovery what shall chaunce unto them and of the time and manner of their death and so thereby endeavour to overthrow the use of all means tending to the preservation of health and prolongation of life

solut
indeed we deny not unto that noble science which they name natural astrologie the knowledge of nature's order and the motions of heavenly bodies but we utterly disallow their superstition who professing judicial astrology for with this great and glorious title they deck and garnish their superstition do measure and predict conjecturally every man's fortune and success as touching sickness life and death by the hour of his birth
for while these and confess that recourse must be made from the time of bearing

to the time of begetting what do they else but bewray their own vanity for it is not possible that they should hear and know for certain the very time of conception so that though it be granted that the stars have some influence and power upon our bodies in respect of health and sickness life and death yet notwithstanding it may be rationally denyed that they can be certainly by any such judicial astrological predictions because amongst many other reasons of the uncertainty of the time of conception or instant of begetting
let not men then search into their almanacks to calculate a nativity and in the mean time neglect their bibles which will never be out of date but let them as our saviour adviseth search the scriptures john

and they may read judg

of many thousands dying a violent death nigh one and the same time and if an astrologer had been consulted before that time it is likely that he would have the instanious deaths of an hundred and twenty thousand when most of them

without question had divers and sundry again had he read of esau jacob twins born would he judge them to have been of the same temper and constitution and to have died at the same instant of time it is like he might but surely not without error
yea it may be inferred and proved also by strict observation that other children besides twins have been born at one instant of time who notwithstanding died at several times

furthermore if the time and kind of death depend upon the stars then by consequence shall sins depend upon them too for these are the proper cause of that and the promises of god in respect of bodily health and long life be of no effect
which consequences whoever grants as conclusions without further examination of the premisses fear will scarce ever be directed to christ by a star
shall therefore direct the eyes of such to the reading of that sacred irony in isaiah let now the astrologers the the monthly prognosticators stand up and save thee from the things that shall come upon thee

isay

and also of that dehortatory lesson in jeremiah thus saith the lord learn not the way of the heathen and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven for the heathen are dismayed at them jer


object

a third objection may be drawn from the skill of chiromancy or palmistry which undertaketh by marks and lines in the hands especially by the line of life to measure the extent of every man's life with the time and degree of every dangerous disease incident thereunto and so thereby maketh void the use of all means tending to the temporal end of this discourse

solut
in the confutation of this error let the testimony of a late author suffice the lines in the hands saith he which are counted nature's manuscripts are but the folds of the skin when the hand bends inwardly neither proper to any who have their feet alwayes extended by the same reason we have not those now which we had in our infancy but by accidents diseases and labour are changeable a book fit for justices to

discover idleness dr robinson in his miscellanious treatise

lastly another objection is from those that pretend wizards and witches the oracles of the devil can prophecy or predict the certain term of man's life with the manner of his death and if so say they then how can vertue prorogue or vice abbreviate man's life

solut
answer briefly that sathan though he can give a notable intelligence to some who are his oracles yet his knowledge for the most part is but conjectural
indeed his experience as he is an old serpent and his knowledge as he is an angel are both very great he can quickly take cognizance of the position of matters how things are in their precedent causes both natural and moral
thus supposing that it was the devil in samuel mantle that did the precise time of saul death sam


yet it doth not imply the absolute certainty of the devil's prediction or the fatal necessity of saul death nor is it any wonder if the devil speaks as he doth

for david was anointed saul grows worse and worse and now the sin was laid on namely his going to a witch and a battel was at hand to be fought all the prodromi or of his approaching ruine

the conclusion
and now to conclude the result of the whole is that of the philosopher ex sanitate in anima sit sanitas in corpore from health in the soul ariseth health in the body arist lib
meta
or if you will taste the summ and substance of the whole treatise in the words of an eminent author fellow of the royal society in his late discourse of the excellency of theology
which just now saluted mine eye and gave me such a fair prospect in parvo of my preceding discourse as will not let them pass but shall here insert them both for strength and ornament thereunto
he who effectually teaches men to subdue their lusts and passions saith he does as much as the physician contribute to the preservation of their bodies by exempting them from those vices whose no less usual than

structive effects are wars and duels and rapines and desolations and the pox and surfeits and all the train of other diseases that attend gluttony and drunkenness idleness and lust which are not enemies to man's life and health barely upon a physical account but upon a moral one as they provoke god to punish them with emporal as well as spiritual judgments such as plagues wars famines and other publick calamities that sweep away a great part of mankind
and a little further he addeth those teachers that make men virtuous and religious by making them temperate and chaste and inoffensive and calm and contented do help them to those qualifications that by preserving the mind in a calm and cheerful temper as well as by affording the body all that temperance can confer do both lengthen their lives and sweeten them
thus he

wherefore since righteousness as the wise man saith tendeth to life and he that pursueth evil pursueth it to his own death prov

let our chiefest care be ut sit mens sana in corpore sano that

a healthful mind be in a healthful body that as by the soundness of the one we enjoy the sweetness of our temporal life so by the soundness of the other we may have the happy fruition both of temporal here and of eternal life hereafter

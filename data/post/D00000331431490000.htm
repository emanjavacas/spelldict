the grieuances of the owners and masters of shipping trading to the southwards against the patent for dungennesse lights

it is true that some of vs gaue consent to the setting vp of a light at dungennesse which was intended should haue bin a faire wherein to hane kept a blazing fire light and for the charge of building and maintenance thereof consent was likewise giuen to pay a pennie vpon the tunne of all ships that should take benefit thereby and this penie to be paid part by the owner and part by the merchant at the returne of the shippes

from their voyages and not before

but the patentee hath abused this consent for in stead of a stone tower he hath erected sleight structures of or masts and on the top thereof keepes onely a candle light which is nothing fit for that place for that we cannot haue any benefit thereby because it cannot be seene till ships come very neare it and also that candle light is so euilly kept that it is suffered in many darke nights to go out to the often endangering of our ships and mens liues

and in stead of a pennie vpon the tunne to be paid at our ships returneÂ· the patentee hath inserted a pennie out and a pennie in which is two pence vpon the tunne euery voyage
vvhich two pence we refusing at first to pay he procured his maiesties letter to the to haue our entries refused and our coquets stayed vntill payment were made of the said two pence vpon the tunne
and also he receiueth the like imposition of all ships that bring salt wines or oyles out of the low countries though they come not neere the said lights by or miles nor can haue any benefit thereby

vvee doe therefore humbly pray this honorable assembly to prouide that a faire tower may be built wherein may be kept a blazing at the charge of a pennie vpon the tunne to be payd part by the owner and part by the merchant at the returne of our shippes or otherwise altogether to extinguish the light for much better were it to haue none then such a one by which we can haue no benefit but are often endangered to lose both our ships goods and liues

PLea&se your Maiesty, Iwes not of minde at the first, that this warkesuld haue commed out in my time: For the conscience of my awn weaknes, testifies vnto me, that nathing worthy of light can proceed from sik a ane: Yit notwithstanding, being ouercome at the last, be the instant sute of our Kirk and Session, Iwes content, that their authoritie suld command mee in this.
And gifit sall please the Lord to blesse it, in sick sort, that poore and simple anes· may finde, ather comfort or instructioun in it: suppose learned eares finde na conteniment, will thinke my selfe aboundantly satisfied: For seeing God hes sanctified mee in some measure to his warke, it mann bee an argument of his euerlasting blessing, that giff, quhill life lasteth, it may be imployed alway to the profite of his Kirke: For quha am I, that suld not imploy his awin graces to his awin glorie? and pray God, that it may bee found in that great day, that howe meane that euer they be, yit they were accompanied with this speciall grace, that they were wel vsed.

THE FIRST SERMON, VPON THE SACRAMENTS IN GENErall: Preached the first of February.
For haue receiued of the Lord, that which also haue deliuered vnto you, to wit, that the Lorde Iesus, in the night that hee was betrayed, tooke bread, &c. THAIR is nathing in this warld, nor out of this warld, mair to be wished of euerye ane of you, mair to be craued sought of euerie ane of you; nor to be co~joyned with Christ Iesus, nor anis to be maid ane with the God of glory, Christ Iesus.
This heauenly celestiall coniunction is purchased brought about, be twa speciall meanes: It is brought about be the mean of the word, preaching of the gospell: it is brought about be the meane of the Sacraments and ministration thairof.
The word leads vs to christ be the ear: the sacraments leads vs to Christ be the eie; Twa senses of al the rest, quhilk God hes chosen, as maist meete for this purpose to instruct vs, and bring vs to Christ.
For that doctrine mann be maist effectuall and mouing, that walkens and steirs vp moniest of the outward senses: that doctrine that walkens not onely the eare, bot the eye, the taist, the feeling, and all the rest of the outwarde senses, mann moue the hart maist, mann be maist effectuall and pearcing in the saul: Bot sa it is, that this doctrine of the Sacraments mouis, steirs vp, walkins moniest of the outward senses; Therefore it mann be (gif we cum weil prepared to it) maist effectual to steir vp the inward senses of the dull hart.
But thair is a thing, that yee mann euer remember; Thair is na doctrine, nather of the simple word, nor yit of the sacraments, gif Christ abstract his haly Spirit, that is able to moue.
Therfore, quhen euer ye come to hear the doctrine, quhider it be of the Sacraments, or of the simple word: craue of God, that hee wald be present be his haly Spirit, or vtherwais al the doctrine in the earth will not availe you.
Alwaies, this doctrine of the Sacraments, steires vp, and walkens moniest of the outward senses, and therefore there is na questioun, but it is ane effectual and potent instrume~t to walken, prepare and steir vp our harts.
Then to lat you see, quhat the worde Sacrament meanis: and to remooue the ambiguitie of it; It is certaine, and out of all questioun, that the Latine Theologs, quha were maist auncient, did interprete the Greeke worde [undefined span alphabet], be the word Sacrament, thay vsed the greeke word, not only to signifie the hail action, as the hail action of Baptisme, the hail action of the Supper of the Lord: but thay vsed the word mystery, to signifie quhatsoeuer is darke, hid in it self, not frequented in the commoun vse of men: as efter this maner, the Apostle callis the vocation of the Gentils a mystery.
This coniunction quhilk is begun heir betwixt vs Christ, is called a Mysterie, and the Latine interpreters, callis it a Sacrament, and to bee schort, yee will not finde in the booke of God, a word mair frequent, nor the word Mysterie.
But as to the word Sacrament, quhairby they signifie the Greeke word, we find not this word be the same Theologs to bee tane sa largelie: nather is it tane sa largely in ony pairt of the booke of God.
Alwayis, the word Sacrament, is very ambiguous in it self, and there raise about the ambiguitie of this word, many tragedeis, quhilke are not yit ceased, nor wil not cease, quhil the warld lasts: quher vtherwais, gif they had keeped the Apostles words, and called thame as the Apostle callis tham, signes and seales: all this digladiatioun, strife and contention, appearandly had not fallen out.
But quhere men will be wiser nor God, giue namis to thinges beside God, vpon the wit of man, quhilk is but meere folly: all this cummer fallis out.
The auncient Theologs, tooke the worde Sacrament, as wee may perceaue, in a fourfauld maner.
Somtime they tooke it for the hail actioun, that is, for the haill ministerie of the Elements.
Somtime, they tooke it not for the haill actioun: but for the outward things, that are vsed in the action of Baptisme, and of the Supper, as they took it, for the water and sprinckling of it: for the Bread and Wine, breaking, distributing, and eating therof.
Thirdly againe: they tooke it not for the hail outward things, that are vsed in the actioun; but onely for the material and earthly thinges, the Elements: as for Bread and Wine in the Supper, and water in Baptisme.
And efter this sort, sayis AVGVSTINE: The wicked eats the body of our Lord, concerning the Sacrament onlie, that is, concerning the Elements onely.
Last of all: they tooke it not onely for the Elements, but for the things signified be the elements.
And efter this maner, IRENEE sayis, that a Sacrame~t sta~ds of twa things, the ane earthly, the vther heauenly.
The auncients then, taking the worde efter thir sorts, na question, all thir wayis they tooke it rightly.
But leuing the ambiguitie of the word, take the worde Sacrament, as it is tane and vsed this day in the Kirk of God, for a haly signe and seale, that is annexed to the preached word of God, to seale vp and confirme the truth, contained in the same word, in sick sort, that call not onlie the seale separated fra the word, a Sacrament: For as there cannot be a seale, but that quhilk is the seal of ane euident, gif the seal be separated fra the euide~t, it is not a seal; Bot looke quhat it is be na+ture, it is na mair: sa ther can not be a Sacrame~t, except it be hung to the euident of the word; Bot look what the Sacrame~t was be nature, it is na mair.
Was it a com mo~ peece bread, it remains co~mon bread except it bee hung to the euident of the word.
Therfore the word only cannot be a Sacrament; nor the eleme~t only cannot be a Sacrament; bot word element con iunctly man make a Sacrament: sa AVGYSTINE said weill, lat the word come to the element, sa ye sal haue a sacrament: in sick sort, that the word mann come to the element, that is the worde preached distinctly, and al the parts of it opned vp, man ga before the hinging to of the sacra+ment, and the Sacrament, as a seale mann follow and be appended therefter.
Then call a Sacrament, the word and seal coniunctlie, the ane hung to the vther.
It is without all controuersie, and there is na debait in it, that all Sacraments are signes.
Now gif a Sacrament be asign, as the sign is in a relation, in that Category; for sawe man speake it: Sa the sacrament man be placed in that same Categorie of relation.
Now euery relation again man stand of force betwixt twa things, for an thing cannot be the correlatiue of it self: but in a lawfull relatioun, of force there man be twa things, quhilk twa, hes euer a mutual respect, the ane to the vther.
Ther+fore in every sacrame~t that hes a relation, thair man be twa things, quhilk twa hes euer a mutual respect the an to the vther.
Take me away ane of thir twa things fra the Sacrament; ye tine the relation, tyning the relation, ye tyne the Sacrament.
Confound me ane of thir twa, with the vther: make ather a confusion or permixion of tham, ye tine the relation, tyning the relation, ye tine the sacrament.
Turne me over the an into the vther, sa that the substance of the ane, starts vp and euanishis in the vther: ye tyne the relation, and sa ye tyne the Sacrament.
Than as in euery sacrament, ther is a relation, sa to kepe the relation, ye man euer kepe twa things seuerally in the Sacrament.
Now for the better consideration and vnderstanding of thir twa diuers thinges quhilk are relatiue to vthers, we sal kepe this ordour by Godis grace: First, we sal lat you see, quhat is meaned be a signe in the Sacrament.
Nixt we sal let you vnderstand quhat is meaned be the thinge signified.
Thirdlie, howe thir twa are coupled, be quhat power and vertue they are conjoyned, and quherfra this power and vertue dois flowe.
Fourtlie, and last of al; we sall let you vnderstand, quhither ane and the selfe same instrument, geuis the signe and the thing signified or not, quhither they be geuin in ane actioun or twa, quhither they bee offered to ane instrument or twa, or gif they be giuen efter a maner or twa to baith the instruments.
Mark thir diuersities, the diuerse maner of receauing, the diuersitie of the instruments, and the diuersitie of the geuaris: and yee sall finde litle difficultie in the sacrament.
Now to begin at the signes: Seeing all sacraments ar signes, quhat call wee the signes in the sacrament? call the signes in the Sacrament, quhatsoeuer perceaue and takis vp be my outwarde senses, be myne eie especially.
Nowe yee see in this Sacrament, there is twa sortes of thing is subject to the outward senses, and to the eie especially; ye see the eleme~ts of bread and wine are subject to myne eie: Therefore they man be signs.
Ye see again, that the rites and ceremonies quhereby thir elements are distributed, broken and giuen, are subject to myne eie also.
Then mann mak twa sortes of signes, ane sorte of the breade and the wine, and wee call thame elementall: ane vther sorte of the rites and ceremonies, quhereby thir are distributed, broken and giuen, and we cal thame ceremonial.
Be not deceaued with the word ceremonie, think not, suppose call the breaking of the breade, the eating of the breade, and drinking of the wine ceremonies, think not that they are vayn, as yee vse that word ceremonie for a vayne thing, quhilk hes na grace, nor profit following efter it: na, suppose cal thame ceremonies, there is neuer a ceremonie quhilk Christ instituted in this supper, but it is als essential as the bread and the wine are, and yee cannot leaue a jote of thame, except ye peruert the hail institutioun.
For quhat euer Christ commanded to be done, quhat euer he spake or did in that hail actioun, it is essentiall and mann be done, and ye cannot leaue a jote thereof, but yee will peruert the hail actioun.
The reasoun, quherefore call thame signes, is this: call thame not signes, be that reason that men commonlie call is thame signes: because they signifie only, as the bread signifies the body of Christ, the wine signifies the blood of Christ.
call thame not signes, because they represent only, but call thame signes because they haue the body and blood of Christ conjoyned with thame, yee sa trulie is the body of Christ conjoyned with that breade, and the blood of Christ conjoyned with that wine, that als soone as thou receauis that bread in thy mouth, (gif thou bee a faithfull man or woman) als sone thou receuest the body of Christ in thy saull, and that be fayth.
And als soone as thou receauis that wine in thy mouth, als sone thou receauis the blood of Christ in thy saul, and that be faith.
In respect of this exhibitioun cheiflie, that they are instruments to deliuer, and exhibite the thing that they signifie, and not in respect onely of there representatioun, they are called signes.
For gif they did nathing bot represented or signified a thing absent; Then ony picture or dead Image, suld be a Sacrament: For there is na Picture, as the Picture of the King, but at the sight of the Picture, the King will come in your minde, and it will signifie to you, that that is the Kings Picture.
Sa, gif the signe of the Sacrament did na further; all Pictures suld be Sacraments; but in respect the Sacrament exhibites and deliuers the thing that it signifies to the saul and hart, sa sone as the signe is deliuered to the mouth: for this cause especiallie, it is called a signe.
There is na Picture of the King, that will deliuer the King vnto you: there is na vther Image that will exhibite the thing quhair of it is the Image: therefore, there is na Image can be a Sacrament.
Then in respect, the Lorde hes appointed the Sacraments, as hands to deliuer and exhibite the thing signified: for this deliuery and exhibitioun chieflie, they are called signes.
As the woorde of the Euangell is a mighty and potent instrument to our euerlasting saluatioun: sa the Sacrament, is a potent instrument appointed bee God, to deliuer to vs Christ Iesus, to our euerlasting saluatioun.
For this spirituall meate is dressed, and geuen vppe to vs in spirituall disches, that is, in the Ministery of the word, and in the ministery of the Sacraments.
And suppose this Ministery be externall, yit the Lord is said, to deliuer spiritual and heauenly things, be thir externall thinges: Quhy? Because he hes appointed thame as instruments, quhairby, he wil deliuer his awin Sone to vs.
For this is certaine, that nane hes power to deliuer Christ Iesus to vs, except God and his halie Spirit: and therefore, to speake properly, there is nane can deliuer Christ bot God be his awin Spirit: he is deliuered be the Ministery of the halie Spirit: it is the halie Spirit that seals him vp in our harts, and confirmis vs mair and mair in him: as the Apostle geuis him this stile
To speake properly: there is nane hes power to deliuer Christ, bot God the father, or himselfe: there is nane hes power to deliuer the Mediatour, bot his awin Spirit: Yit it hes pleased God to vse sum instruments and meanis, quhairby hee will deliuer Christ Iesus to vs: the means are thir: the ministery of the word and the ministery of the Sacraments: and in respect hee vses thir as meanis to deliuer Christ, they are said to deliuer him.
But heir yee haue to distinguish, betwixt the principall efficient deliuerer, and the instrumentall efficient, quhilk is the word and the Sacraments: Keeping this distinction, baith thir are true, God be his worde, and God bee his Spirit, deliuers Christ Iesus to you.
Then say, cal tham signes, because God hes maid thame potent instrumentis to deliuer that same thing quhilk they signifie.
Nowe ga to the thing signified, and call the thing signified bee the signes in the Sacrament, that quhilk IRENEE, that auld writer, call is the heauenly and spirituall thing, to wit: haill Christ, with his hail giftes, benefites and graces, applied and geuen to my saul.
Then call not the thing signified be the signs of bread and wine: the benefits of Christ, the graces of Christ, or the vertue that flowis out of Christ onlie; But cal the thing signified, togidder with the benefites and vertues flowing fra him, the verie substaunce of Christ himself; quherefra this vertue dois flow: The substa~ce, with the vertues, gifts and graces, that flowes fra the substance, ar the thing signified heere.
For as to the vertue graces, that flows fra Christ: It is not possible, that thou can be partaker of the vertue, that flowes fra his substaunce, except thou be first partaker of the substance it selfe: For how is it possible, that can be partaker of the iuyce that flowes out of ony substance, except bee partaker of the substance it selfe first.
Is it possible that my stomach can bee refreshed with that meat, the substaunce quhairof, come neuer in my mouth? Is it possible, that my drouth can be slokned with that drinke, that passed neuer ouer my halse? Is it possible, that can sowck ony vertue out of onye thing, except get the substance first: Sa it is impossible, that can get the iuice and vertue, that flows out of Christ, except get the substance, that is, himselfe first.
Sa call not the thing signified, the grace and vertue that flowes fra Christ onelie, nor Christ himselfe and his substance, without his vertue and graces onelie: But ioyntly the substance with the graces, haill Christ, GOD and man, without separatioun of his natures, without discretioun of his substaunce fra his graces, call the thing signified, bee the signes in the Sacrament.
For quhy? Gif na mair bee signified bee the bread, bot the flesch and bodie of Christ onelie, and na mair be signified be the wine, but the blood of Christ onelie, thou can not say, that the bodie of Christ is Christ, it is but a cowpon of Christ: thou cannot say that the blud of Christ, is hail Christ, it is bot a part of him, a cowpo~ of thy Sauiour, saued thee not, a part of thy sauior wroght not the wark of thy saluation: and sa suppose thou get a cowpon of him in the sacrament, that cowpoun wald do thee na good.
To the end therfore, that this sacra+ment may nurish thee to life euerlasting; thou man get in it thy haill Sauiour, haill Christ God man, with his haill graces benefits, without seperation of his substance fra his graces, or of the ane nature fra the vther.
It is a vaine thing to thinke, that we will get God be our mouth: but we get him be faith: As hee is a Spirit, sa eat him bee faith beleif in my saul: Not be the teeth of my mouth, that is a vaine thing.
giue the, that thou might eat the flesh of Christ with thy teeth, this were a cruel maner of doing: yit thou may not eat the God head with thy teeth: this is a grosse faschioun of speaking.
Sa, gif euer ye get good of the Sacrament, yee mann get haill Christ, and there is not ane instrument to gripp him, bot be faith onelie: therefore come with a faithfull hart.
O! but ye will speere at me, and appearandlie the definitioun layd doun of the thing signified, giues a ground to it; gif the flesch of Christ, the blood of Christ be a pairt of the thing signified: how can call his flesche a spirituall and heauenly thing, and Christ in respect of his flesche a heauenly thing? Ye will not say that the substance of Christs flesch is spirituall: or that the substance of his blood is spirituall, quherefore then cal ye it ane heauenly and spirituall thing? will tell you: the, flesch of Christ is called a spiritual thing, and Christ is called spiritual, in respect of his flesh, not that his fleshe is becomd a spirit, or that the substance of his flesh is becomd spirituall: Na, it remaned true fleshe and the substance of it is ane; as it was in the wombe of the virgin, his fleshe is not called spirituall nather, in respect it is glorified in the heauens at the right hand of the father: be not deceaued with that, for suppose it be glorified; yit it remains true flesh, that same flesh quhilk he tooke out of the wombe of the Virgin.
It is not spiritual nather, because thou seeis it not in the Supper, gif thou war quhere it is, thou might see it: but it is called spirituall, in respect of the spirituall ende, quherunto it seruis to my body and saul: because the flesch and bloode of Christ, seruis to nurish mee; not to a temporall life: but to a spirituall and heauenly life.
Nowe, in respect this flesh is a spirituall food, seruing me to a spirituall life; For this caus it is called a spiritual thing.
Gif it nurished me, as the flesh of beasts dois, but to a temporall life, it suld bee called but a temporall thing: But in respect, it nurishes my saull, not to ane earthlie and temporall life, but to ane heauenly, celestiall, and spirituall end: In respect of this end, the flesh of Christ, and Christ in respect of his fleshe, is called the spirituall thing in the Sacrament.
It is called also, the spirituall thing in the Sacrament, in respect of the spirituall instrume~t, quherby it is receiued.
The instrument quhereby the flesh of Christ is receaued, is not a corporal instrument, is not the teeth and mouth of the body; but it is spirituall, it is the mouth of the saull, quhilk is faith: and in respect the instrument is spirituall: Therefore Christ, quha is receaued, is also called spirituall.
In respect also, that the maner of receauing, is a heauenlie, spirituall and celestiall maner, not a naturall, nor externall maner, in respect that the flesh of Christ, quhilk is giuen in the Sacrament, is receiued be a spirituall and secreet maner, quhilk is not seene to the eies of men.
In all thir respects, call Christ Iesus the heauenlye and spirituall thing, quhilk is signified be the signes in the Sacrament.
Now: say in the end, the thing signified mann be applied to vs. Quhat auails it me, to see my health in a buist, standing in ane Apothecaries booth? quhat can it worke toward me, gif it bee not applied? Quhat auails it me, to see my saluatioun afar off, gif it be not applied to me? Ther+fore it is not aneugh to vs to see Christ: bot he mann be giuen vs; or els hee cannot work health and saluation in vs.
And as this saluatioun is giuen vs; wee mann haue a mouth to take it.
Quhat auails it me to see meat before me; except haue a mouth to take it? Sa, the thing signified in the Sacrament, mann bee giuen vs be God, be the three persons of the Trinity, a God, be Christ lesus, quha mann giue himselfe, and as he giues himselfe; sa wee man haue a mouth to take him.
Suppose hee presents and offers him selfe: yit hee can profite or auaile nane, but thame, quha hes a mouth to receaue him.
Then yee see, quhat call the thing signified: haill Christ applied to vs, and receaued be vs: hail Christ God and man, without separatioun of his natures, without discretioun of his substance fra his graces, all applied to vs.
Then say, seeing wee come to the Sacrament, to bee fed bee his flesh, and refreshed bee his blood, to be fed to ane heauenly and spiritual life: and seeing there is na profite to bee had of this Table, without some kynd of preparatioun: Therefore lat na man prease to ga to that halie Table, except in some measure hee be prepared.
Some will bee prepared in a greater measure the~ vthers.
Alwayis, lat na man presume to ga to it, except in some measure his hart bee sanctified.
Therfore my exhortation concerning the way, quhairby euery ane of you ought to prepare your selfis, that ye may dresse you the better to the table, is this: There is neuer ane of you, that comes to the Table of the Lorde, to cast before the Lord, your integritie, iustice and vprightnes: But quhasoeuer gais to the Table, he ought to ga with the acknowledging and confessioun of his miserie: hee ought to ga with a sorrowfull hart, for the sinnes quhairin he hes offended God: he ought to ga with a haitrent of thay sins; not to protest, that he is halie, iust, and vpright: But to protest and confesse· that he is miserable, and of all creatures, the maist miserable.
And therefore, he gais to that table, to get support for his miserie, to get a gripp of mercie at the throne of grace: and to get remissioun and forgiuenes of his sinnes; to get the gift of repentance, that mair and mair, he may studie to liue vprightlie, halilie and soberlie in all time comming.
Therefore, except yee haue entred in this course, and are of purpose to continue in this course, to amend your life bigane, to repent you of your sinnes, and be the grace of God, to liue mair vprightlie and soberlie, nor yee haue done, for Gods cause ga not to the Table.
For quhere there is not a purpose to do weil and to repent, of necessitie, there mann be a purpose to doe ill: and quhasoeuer coms to that Table, with a purpose to do ill, and without a purpose to repent: hee comes to mocke Christ; to skorne him in his face, to eat his awin present conde~natio~.
Sa, lat na man come to that table, that hes not in his hart a purpose to doe better: that hes not a hart to sorrow for his sinnes bigane: and thinks not his bigane folie and madnes ouer meekle.
Lat na man come to that table without this, vnder the paine of damnatioun.
But gif ye haue in your hart, a purpose to do better, suppose your bigan life hes bene dissolute and loose: yit gif ye be tuitched in your hart, with ony feeling or remorse of your bigane life, ga not fra the table, but come with a protestatioun of thy miserie and wretchednes, and come with a hart to get grace.
Gif with a dissolute life, meane not of open slaunders, thou haue also a purpose not to amend, but to doe war, for Gods sake absteine.
Into this generall consideration, there rests thir thinges yit to bee maid plaine vnto you.
Firste, howe the signes and the thing signified are coupled togidder, and how they are conioyned.
Nixt, it rests to be tauld you; how the signe is deliuered, and how the thing signified is deliuered, and how baith are receaued, als weill as they are deliuered.
This being done, fall speake shortly of the vther part of the Sacrament, quhilk is the worde: And last of all, wee sall lat you see, quhat sort of faultes they are, that peruerts the Sacrament, and makes it of na effect.
And gif time sall serue, we sall enter in particular, to this sacrame~t, quhilk we haue in hand.
In the third roume, it coms in to be considered; how the signe and the thing signified are coupled: For about this conjunction, all the debait standes: all the strife that wee haue with thame, that varies fra the streight trueth, standes about the maner of this coniunction.
Some wil haue tham conioyned efter ane way, and some efter ane vther way; and men striues verie bitterlie about this mater, and continues sa in strife, that thorow the bitternes of con+tention, they tyne the trueth.
For quhen the heat of contentioun rises, and specially in disputation, they take not tent to the trueth, but to the victorie: Gif they may bee victorious, and it were but be a multitude of words, they regard not suppose they tyne the trueth.
Reade their works, and books about this coniunctioun, and yee sall craue, rather conscience nor knawledge: yea, gif they had the quarter of the conscience, that they haue of knawledge: na questioun, this controuersie might bee easilie tane vp; but men laking conscience, hauing knawledge, an euil conscience peruerts the knawlege and drawes thame to ane euil end.
To tel you now, how thir twa are conioyned: it will be farre easier for me, and better for you to vnderstand, to tell you first, howe they are not conioyned: for sall make it very cleare vnto you, be letting you see how they are not conioyned: but it is not possible, to make it so cleare, by telling you the maner how they are conioyned.
Yee may perceaue clearelie be your awin eies, that the signe the thing signified are not locally conioyned, that is, they are not baith in ane place.
Yee may perceaue also be your outwarde senses, that the body of Christ, quhilk is the thing sig+nified, and the signes are not conioyned corporallie: their bodies tuitches not vthers.
Yee may perceaue also, they are not visiblie conioyned, they ar not baith subject to the outwarde eye.
Sa it is easie to lat you see, howe they are not conioyned.
For gif the signe and the thing signified were visiblie corporally conioyned, Quhat misterd vs to haue a sign? Quherefore suld the signe in the Sacrament serue vs? Is not the signe in the Sacrament appointed to lead me to Christ? Is not the signe appointed, to point out Christ to me? Gif sawe him present be mine awin eye, as doe the bread, quhat mister had of the bread? Therefore yee may see clearlie, that there is na sik thing as a corporall, naturall, or ony siclike physicall coniunction, betwixt the signe, and the thing signified.
Sa say, it is easie to let you see, howe they are not conioyned.
Then come on, how are they conioyned? We cannot craue here any vther sort of coniunctioun, nor may stand and agree with the nature of the Sacrament: For na thing can be conioyned with ane vther efter ane vther sort, nor the nature of it will suffer.
Therefore there cannot be heir ane vther sort of coniunction, nor the nature of the Sacrament will suffer.
Now the nature of the sacrament, wil suffer ane sacramentall coniunction.
but that is als hard yit: Ye are neuer the better of this: but sall make it cleare bee Gods grace.
Yee knaw, euery Sacrament is a mysterie; there is not a Sacrament, but it conteinis a high and diuine mysterie.
In respect then, that a Sacrament is a mysterie, it followes that a mysticall, secrete and spirituall coniunctioun, agreis weill with the nature of the Sacrament.
As the coniunctioun betwixt vs Christ is full of a mysterie, as the Apostle lets you see, EPHES.
as it is a mysticall and spiritual coniunction; Sa na dout, the coniunction betwixt the Sacrament, and the thing signified in the Sacrament, man be of that same nature, mysticall and spirituall.
It is not possible to tell you be na ocular demonstratioun, how Christ and we are conioyned.
But quha euer wald vnderstand that coniunctioun, his minde mann be enlightned with ane heauenlie eie, that as he hes ane eye in his head to see corporall things: Sa he mann haue in his minde and hart, ane heauenlie eye, to see this mysticall coniunction.
heauenlie eye to take vp this secret coniunction, that is betwixt the Sonne of God and vs, in the Sacrament.
Sa mister not to insist; Except yee haue this heauenlie illumination, yee can neuer vnderstand, nather your awin coniunction with Christ, nor yit the coniunction betwixt the signe and the thing signified in the Sacrament.
But keepe my ground: As the Sacrament is a mysterie: Sa the coniunctioun that is into the Sacrament, na dout, man be a mystical, secret and spiritual coniunction.
Beside this, lut you see, be the generall deduction, that in euery Sacrament there is twa things: quhilk twa, hes a relatioun, and a mutuall respect the ane to the vther.
Sa that a relatiue coniunction, agrees weill with the nature of the sacrame~t.
Then speirs thou quhat kind of coniunction it is? giue thee the coniunction that agrees with their nature, to wit, a relatiue and a respectiue coniunction, sik a coniunction, quhairin the sign hes a continuall respect to the thing signified, and the thing signified to the signe.
Then crauis thou in a worde, the sort of coniunction, that is betwixt the signe the thing signified? call it a secret and a mysticall coniunctioun, that stands in a mutuall relatioun, betwixt the signe and the thing signified.
There is ane vther coniunction, beside the coniunctioun that is betwixt Christ and vs, that may mak this coniunctioun betwixt the signe and the thing signified in the Sacrament mair cleare: and this is the coniunction quhilk is betwixt the word that ye hear, and the thing signified be the same word.
Looke quhat sort of coniunction is betwixt the word quhilk yee heare, and the thing signified that comes in your mind: the like coniunctio~ is betwixt the sign that ye see, and the thing signified in the Sacrament.
Yee may perceaue easilie: there is a coniunction be the effect, suppose yee cannot knaw the sort of coniunction.
For quhy? Yee heare not the word sa sone spoken be me, but incontinent, the thing, quhilk my worde quhairof speake signifies, comes in your mind: speake of things bigane, of things to come, or of thinges that are neuer sa far absent: cannot sa sone speak to you of thame in this language, but the thing signified comes in your minde; Na doubt, because there is a coniunction betwixt the worde the thing signified· Sa, euery ane of you may easily perceaue, that there is a coniunctioun betwixt the word, the thing signified be the word.
As for example, suppose Paris bee far distant fra vs; Yit speake of Paris, the word is not sa sone spoken, but the toune will come in your mind: Speak of the King, suppose he be far distant fra vs, the word is not sa soone spoken, but the thing signified will come in your minde.
Sa this comming of the thing signified in the hart and mind, lats you see clearlie, that there is a coniunction betwixt the word, and the thing signified bee the word.
To tell you of this sort of coniunctioun, it is not sa easie: Because the thing signified is not present to the eye, as the worde is to the eare.
Gif euery thing signified, war als present to your eye, as the word is to your eare; it were easie to see the coniunction.
But seeing the coniunction is mysticall, secrete and spirituall: therefore it is hard to make you to vnderstand it.
Always looke quhat coniunction is betwixt the simple word, the thing signified be the word: that same sort of co~iunction is betwixt the sacrament and the thing signified bee the Sacrament.
For the Sacrament is na vther thing, but ane visible word.
call it a visible word, quhy? Because it conuoyes the significatioun of it, be the eie to the minde.
As this is ane audible worde, because it conuoyes the signification of it be the ear to the mind, in the same sacrament, sa oft as yee looke on it, yee sall not sa soone see that bread with your eie, but the bodie of Christ sall come in your mind: Yee sall not sa soone see that wine, but efter the preaching opning vp of the parts of the Sacrament, the bloode of Christ sall come in your mind.
Now this coniunction betwixt the signe and the thing signified in the Sacrament; stands chiefly, as ye may perceaue, in twa points: First in an relation betwixt the sign the thing signified, quhilkrises of an likenes proportion, betwixt thir twa: for gif there were na proportion analogie, betwixt the signe and thing signified be the signe; there could not bee a Sacrament or ane relatioun.
Sa the first pairt of this coniunction stands in a relation, quhilk rises vpon ane certaine similitude likenes, quhilk the ane hes with the vther.
For looke howe able the bread is to nurishe thy body to this life earthlie and temporal, the flesh of Christ, signified be the bred, is als able to nurish baith body and saull to life everlasting.
Sa yee may perceaue some kinde of proportion betwixt the signe and the thing signified.
The secound point of the coniunction, stands in a continuall and mutual concurring of the an with the vther, in sik sort, that the signe, the thing signified, ar offered baith togither, receaued togither, at ane time and in ane actioun: the ane outwardelie, the vther inwardly, gif sa be that thou haue a mouth in thy saull, quhilk is faith, to receaue it.
Then the secound point of the conjunctioun stands in a joynt offering, and in a joynt receauing, this call ane concurrence.
Then speere yee, quhat sort of conjunction is betwixt the signe and the thing signified? say, it is a relatiue conjunction, a secret and a mystical conjunction, quhilk stands in a mutuall relatioun.
There is na farther to be obserued heir, except only this: that suppose ye conjoin thir twa, be war that ye confound thame not, bee war that yee turne not over the ane in the other: but keepe every ane of thame in their awin integritie, without confusion or permixtion of the ane with the other, and sa yee sall haue the lawfull conjunctioun that sulde bee in the sacrament.
There is not a lessoun that can be learned of this, at least that can marke or gather, except onely the lessoun of the kindenes and goodnes of the everliuing God; quha hes invented sa mony wonderfull sortes of conjunctioun, and all to this purpose, that wee might be conjoyned, to aduance this great and mysticall conjunctioun, betwixt the God of glorie and vs: In the quhilk conjunctioun, our weil, felicity and happines in this life, and in the life to come, dois only stand: That he is sa cairfull to conjoine himselfe with his worde and Sacraments, that wee, in his word and Sacraments might be conjoyned with him.
Gif wee were moued with the care and loue of God, vttered in thir conjunctiones, and it were neuer sa litle on our pairts: assuredly we wald not defraud our selfs, of the fruit of that happy conjunction, nor bring it in sik a loath and disdaine as wee do this day: for wee be folowing and preferring of our pleasures to Christ and his counsell, hes made the stomachis of our saules sa foule and ill disposed, that ather they receiue him not at all, or gif he be receaued, he is not able to tary: And quhy? because ane foul stomach is not able to keepe him, for incontinent we chok him sa, ather with the lustis of the flesh, or with rhe cares of this warlde, that hee is compelled to depart: gif Christ be not baith, deuoured and digested, hee can doe vs na good: And this digestion can not be quhere there is not a gredy appetite to the receit of him; for gif thou be not hungry for him, he is not ready for thee.
And am assured gif all the men in this countrie were examined efter this rule, that there were nane that receuis Christ, bot he that hes a stomach and is hungrie for him, it fearis me that few suld bee found to receaue him.
It fears me, that we haue tane sik a loath and disdaine of that heauenlie food, that there is not sick a thing, as ony kinde of hunger, or appetite of it in our saules.
And quhat is the cause of this? will tell you: Suppose wee haue renounced the corporall and grosse Idolatrie, wherein our fathers were drowned and plunged of before, and quhilk men in some parts gais about to erect now: Yit as the maners of this countrie, and the behauiour of every ane of vs testifies, there is neuer a man that hes renou~ced that damnable Idol, that he hes in his awin saul, nor the invisible Idolatry, that he hes in his awin hart and mynd.
There is neuer a man but to that same Idoll quherewith hee wes conceaued and borne, and wherevnto he addicted himselfe and wes a slaue off before, but to that Idoll he geuis his seruice yit: and therefore meruell not, quhen thou hes addicted thy seruice: set thy affection, powred out thy hart vpon that pleasure of thine awin, vpon that Idoll of thy awin, vpon that lust mischief of thy awin: meruell not, suppose thou haue na appetite of Christ, nor of that heauenlie food.
Quhen thou hes thy saull powred furth on some villany wickednes, hes send it far a feild: how is it possible to the, to retire it, or draw it hame againe, to imploy it quhere thou suld on Christ Iesus? Then let euery ane in his awin ranck, tak heed to his awin domestik Idoll, that ludges within his awin heart, and prease to cleare him of it, or vtherwayis, ye cannot see the face of Christ, nor be pertakers of his kingdome.
There is not ane vther lessoun in christianitie but this: this is the first and the last lessoun; to shake off your lustis and affectiouns, peece and peece, and sa peece and peece renounce thy self, that thou may embrace Christ.
grant, there is greater progresse in this point, in some nor in vthers, some lesse, some mair profites in this; But except in some measure yee cast of your selfe, or quhatsoeuer in your awin eies, yee compt maist precious, to come be Christ; yee are not worthie of him: And this is verie hard to be done.
It is verie easie for a man to speake it, to bidd a man renounce his awin Idoll, quhilk call his affections; but it is not sa sone done.
Assuredly the stronger mann come in, to ding out the affection: yea the stronger nor the deuil, man come in to ding out the deuill, quha makes residence in the affection; or els hee will remaine there for euer.
Therefore, there are not mony that hes renounced thame selfis, and examin thine hart quhen thou will, gif there be ony thing in the warld, that thou louis better nor christ, gif thou bee not content, to leaue father and mother, to leaue wife and children, or quhat+soeuer is dearest to thee in this warld, for Christ, thou art nor worthie of him.
Gif thou be not content to cast off, quhatsoeuer maks thee a stranger to Christ, thou art not worthie of him.
And is this onie little matter, seeing there is na part nor power of our saul, but it is enemy to this, and repines to this heauenlie coniunction; Is this onie litle mater, to cast off and renounce our selfis, that we may come to Christ? Ye saw neuer a greater matter nor this.
It hes not entred into euery hart to consider of this, for this wark of our new creatioun, is ten thousand times greater nor the warke of our first creation.
And therefore it were very necessary, that euerie man tooke tent to himselfe: For the Deuill is so craftie in this point, that hee erects euer ane Idoll or vther in our saul, and sometimes vnder the shew of vertue, quhilk of all is maist dangerous: And in euerie wark that is in our hand, gif it war neuer sa halie, hee is at our right hande, and maks him to haue interest in it.
And hee contents himselfe not with this, vnder the shewe of vertues to dissaue you: But he is sa walkrife, that euen in the best turne, and quhen ye are best occupied in your maist vertuous actions, hee mixes thame with sinnes, and sa dois the thing that lies in him, to make you tine your profit, and loose your reward.
For quhen yee are best occupied, hee gais about to engender in you an opinion of your selfis and sa defraud God of his glory.
Or vtherwayis in doing of good turnes, hee makes you sa slacke and negligent, that gif ye do thame, yee do thame caldlie, or sa indiscreetly, that he maks you begin at the last first, and makes it that suld be first last; and sa as MARTHA wes, to be occupied, and ouer bissie in thay things, quhilk are not sa necessar, as the things quherin MARIE wes occupied.
For she suld haue preferred first the hearing of the worde, to the preparing of Christs Supper.
This is but to giue you ane insight, and to lat you see, that the deuil is sa craftie, that ather he casts in a false conceat of our selfs in doing ony turne, or els makes vs to do that last quhilk suld be first, or then maks vs altogidder sa sluggish and sa negligent that we do the warke of the Lord caldly, and sa ane way or vther, he halds vs euer in a continuall busines.
Sa that we cannot be halfe walkrife: For we haue to do with principalities and powers, with spirituall wickednes, quhilk are aboue vs, within vs also.
For he is not, that hes corruption within him, but Sathan is in him: Sa wee cannot bee halfe walkrife, euer studiing to cast out the Deuill, to renounce our selfis, and to submit vs to the obedience of Christ.
Now, seing that the signe and the thing signified, are diuers: it rests to bee considered how the sign is deliuered, and how the thing signified is deliuered; and efter quhat manner they are receaued: And therefore of this consideration, yee haue thir things to wey. Yee haue first to consider, quhidder baith the signe, and the thing signified, be deliuered to you be ea man or not.
Secondly yee haue to consider, quhidder the signe and the thing signified, be deliuered to you in ane actioun or not.
Thirdly, yee haue to consider, quhidder baith thir things bee giuen to ane instrument or not.
And fourtly, yee haue to consider, quhidder the signe and the thing signified, be offered receaued efter ea maner or not.
Now efter that yee haue considred all thir, in the ende yee sal find that the sign the thing signified, ar not giuen be a man; ye sal find nixt, that they are not giuen in a sort of actioun.
Thirdly, ye sal find, that they ar not baith offered and giuen to ane instrument.
And fourtly, yee sall finde, that they are not baith giuen and receaued efter ane maner.
Sa finding this diuersitie, yee haue this to doe: Marke mee the diuersitie of the propiners and giuers: Marke me the diuersitie of the actions: Mark me thirdlie, the diuersitie of the instruments, and marke fourtly, the diuers manner of receauing.
Mark me all thir diligently, and yee sall finde litle difficultie in the Sacrament.
For first to mak it cleare vnto you, say, that the signe, and the thing signified be the signe, are not baith giuen be ea man; and this yee see clearely.
For as to the signe, that bread, and that wine, ye see your selfe, that the Minister offers vnto you the signe, hee giues you that Sacrament: as that sign is ane earthly and corporall thing, sa it is ane earthly and corporall man that giues it.
Now the thing signified is of ane vther nature: For it is ane heauenly and spirituall thing; therefore this heauenly thing, is not giuen be an earthly man, this vncorruptible thing, is not giuen be ane naturall and corruptible man; But Christ Iesus hes locked vp and reserued the Ministerie of this heauenly thing to himselfe onely.
Therefore there is twa giuers in this sacrament: The Minister giues the earthly thing, Christ Iesus the Mediatour, giues you the heauenlie thing in the Sacrament: For Christ in giuing the earthly thing, will not vse his awin Ministerie immediatlie, nor the Ministerie of ane Angell: but onelie the Ministerie of ane earthlie man.
And as to the dispensatioun of his awin bodie and blood, hee will not giue it to na heauenlie creature, lat be to ane earthly man; but he hes keeped this Ministerie to him selfe, and he dispenses his awin body and blood, to quhom quhen he pleasis: For quhy? gif ony man in the warld, had power to giue Christs body blood, na question this man suld haue power, to cleanse the hart and conscience; For the blood of Christ hes this power with it: and consequently suld haue power to forgiue sins.
Now it is onely GOD that may forgiue sinnes: and therefore it is not possible, that the Ministerie of the heauenly thing, can be in the power of ony man.
Sayis he not, the ministery that haue is of the element, am commaunded to Minister the eleme~t of water only: but as to the Ministerie of the fire of the spirit, Christ hes reserued it to himselfe.
Therefore looke not to get the spirit at mans hand, but at the hands of Christ himselfe onelie, and without this inward Ministerie, wil not giue a straa for the outward Ministerie.
For my outward Ministerie: Yea, suppose it were the Ministerie of ane Angell, and suppose Christ were present in his flesh, to minister vnto you thir outward things: except he conjoyne the inward ministerie of his spirit therewith, it auailes nathing: It may weill make vp a dittay proces against you, against the day of that generall assemblie: but to your saluation, it will neuer profite you.
Therefore this yee suld ay craue, that the Lord wald water your harts bee his halie spirit, as he waters your eares be the hearing of the word.
Then there is twa offerers: the Minister offers the signe, Christ Iesus offers himselfe, the thing signified.
The three persons, ea God, offers the Mediatour, or the Mediator offers himselfe, and that bee the power and vertue of his awin spirit.
As there is twa propiners, twa persons that offeris and geuis the Sacrament, and the thing signified be the Sacrament: Sa thir twa ar offered and giuen in twa actions.
Christ, quha is the heauenlie thing is offered giuen to you, be ane inward secreet and spirituall actioun, quhilk is not subject to the outward eie.
The signe againe is offered and giuen, in ane outward actioun, efter a corporal and visible maner.
As there is twa sortes of actions, sa there is twa sortes of instrumentes, quherevnto the signe and the thing signified are offered: for the thing signified, that is, Christ: is neuer offered to the mouth of my body.
The blood of Christ, the flesh of Christ, haill Christ, or the spirit of Christ is not offered, nather in the word nor in the sacrament to the mouth of my body, get me that in ony parte of the Bible, that there is ony vther maner of receauing of Christ, bot be faith, and tak it to thame.
Sa there is not an instrument, as taulde you, nather hand nor mouth to grippe Christ, bot faith onely.
As Christ, quha is the thing signified, is gripped be the hand and mouth of faith: sa the signe that signifies Christ, is gripped be our awin naturall mouth hand.
Yee haue a mouth in your head, and in your body, als proper to gripp the signe, as fayth is to grippe Christ.
Swa the signe and the thing signified ar offered and giuen, not to ane instrument, but to twa: the ane to the mouth of the bodie, the vther to the mouth of the saull.
Now look be quhat way thir things are offered and giuen, be the same way they ar receaued.
As the signe is corporall, and naturally offered to a corporall instrument: sa is it receaued efter a corporall and naturall maner.
For thou man tak the bread and the wine, ather bee thy hand, or bee thy mouth: the thing signified is not tane efter a corporall maner, bot efter a secreet and spirituall maner: and as it is offered, sa it is tane: there cannot be a thing clearer, the ane is tane efter a natural maner, the vther efter a secret and spirituall maner.
Sa in this last part ye haue thir things to mark: distinguish me betwixt the outward action and the inward, betwixt the signe and the thing signified, and keepe mee a proportion and analogie, betwixt the inwarde and the outward actions: Thinke weill with your selfe, that gif yee bee a faithfull man, Christ is als bissie working inwardlie in your saull: as the Minister is working outwardlie toward your bodie.
Looke how bissie the Minister is in breaking that bread, in powring out that wine, in giuing that bread and wine to thee; als bissie is Christ in breaking his awin body to thee, and in giuing thee the iuyce of his awin bodie, efter a spirituall ane inuisible maner.
Sa keepe me this distinction, and thinke weill with your selfs, that be faith, Christ is als weill ocupied towards your saul to nurish it, as the Minister is outwardly towardes your body.
Then of this discourse deduction: ye maytak vp a doble mater, quher of the Sacrament stands.
It stands of twa sorts of materials: that is, of ane earthlie mater, and of ane heauenly mater: The sign and the thing signified; And as there is a double mater in the Sacrament, sa the Sacrament mann bee handled efter a double maner, be ane outward actioun, and ane inward action.
Keepe the distinction in thir things, betwixt the sign and the thing signified, ye sal not easilie slip in the vnderstanding of the Sacrament.
This being sayd, concerning the generall consideration of the elements (for al this apperteins yit to the elements.)
It rests that wee speake somequhat concerning the word, quhilk cal the vther part of the Sacrament.
Quhat we meane and vnderstand be the word, take the word quhairvnto the elements are annexed, for that thing, quhilk quickens this haill action, quhilk serues as it were a saul, and giues life to the haill actioun.
For be the worde, and the appointment of Christ in the worde, the Minister knawis quhat is his part, the hearer knawis quhat is his part, and euery ane is prepared, howe to deliuer and how to receaue: the Minister how hee suld deliuer, and the hearer how hee suld receaue.
Sa the institutioun of Christ, is the quickning of the haill action.
For all the action hes the warrand fra the institution set down in his word.
In the institution of Christ, there is twa things chieflie to be considered.
Yee will finde in the institutioun of Christ a command, and yee will finde in it a promise: The commaund is this, quhere hee sayis, take eat: the command oblishes you to obey, and craues obedience.
There is a promise also in the institution, and it is conteined in thir wordes, This is my bodie.
As the command craues obedience; sa the promise craues beleife: Therefore come not to the Sacrament, except yee bring baith faith and obedience with you.
Gif thou come not with a heart minded to obey Christ, at least, mair nor thou was wont to doe, thou comes to thine awin damnation.
And gif thou bring a hart alwais voyd of faith, thou comes to thine awin damnation.
Sa, lat euery ane that comes to the Sacrament, bring with him a hart minded to do better, that is, to obey and beleiue Christ, better nor he did off before.
Except yee bring thir twa in some measure, come not to the Sacrament: for whatever thou do, except it flow of faith, can profite nathing.
Nowe there rests onely this, and it wald bee speered, quhat mister is there, that thir Sacraments and seales suld bee annexed to the worde? Quherefore are they annexed, seeing wee gat na mair in the Sacrament, nor we get in the worde: and we get als meekle in the very simple word, as we gat in the Sacrament: Seeing then wee get na newe thing in the sacrament, but the same thing, quhilk wee gat in the simple word, quherefore is the Sacrament appointed to bee hung to the word? It is true certainly, we get na new thing in the Sacrament: nor wee get na vther thing in the Sacrament, nor we gat in the worde, for quhat mair walde thou craue, nor to get the Sonne of God, gif thou get him weill? Thy hart cannot wish nor imagine a greater gift, nor to haue the Sonne of God, quha is King of heauen and earth.
And therefore say quhat new thing walde thou haue? For gif thou get him, thou gettis all things with him, thy hart cannot imagine a newe thinge beside him: quherefore then is the sacrament appointed? Not to get thee a new thing.
say it is apointed to get thee that same thing better, nor thou gat it in the word.
The Sacrament is appointed, that we may get a beter grip of Christ, nor we gat in the simple word, that we may possesse Christ in our harts and mindes mair fullie and largely, nor wee did off before in the simple worde.
That Christ might haue a larger space, to make residence in our narrowe hearts, nor hee could haue be the hearing of the simple worde: and to possesse Christ mair fullie, it is a better thing.
For suppose Christ be ea thing in him selfe: yit the better grip thou haue of him, thou art the surer of his promise.
The Sacramentes are appointed, that might haue him mair fullie in my saull, that might haue the bounds of it enlarged, that hee may make the better residence in mee: This na doubt is the cause, quherefore thir seales are annexed to the euident of the simple word.
They serue to this end also, to seale vp and confirm the trueth, that is in the word; for as the office of the seale hung to the euident, is not to confirme ane vther trueth, nor that quhilk is in the euident; and suppose yee beleeued the euident off before; yit be the seales yee beleeue it the better.
Euen sa, the Sacrament assures mee of na vther trueth, nor is conteined within the word: Yit because it is a seale annexed to the word, it perswades mee the better of the same, for ay the maa the mair that the outward senses be walkned, the mair is the inward hart mind, perswaded to beleif.
Now the sacrament walkens al the outward senses, sick as the eie, the hand, and all the rest: And the outward senses beeing mooued, na question, the spirit of God concurring therewith, mooues the heart the mair.
The Sacraments are then annexed to the word, to seal vp the truth conteined in the worde, and to confirme it mair and mair in thy hart.
Then quhat haue yee to doe, the worde is appointed to worke beleife, and the sacrament is appointed to confirme you in this beleife: but except yee feele the trueth of this inwardly in your harts, except ye haue your harts als readie as your mouth, think not that ony thing will auaile you; All the seales in the warld will not worke, except the spirit of God concurre, and seale the same trueth in your harts, quhilk the Sacrament seales outwardlie.
Except hee mak cleare the sight of thy mind inwardlie, and worke a feeling in thy hart, baith word and Sacrament, sall tyne their fruit and effect quhilk they suld haue.
The hail Scriptures of GOD are but a slaying letter to you, except the spirit of God concurre to quicken inwardlie.
Sa your haill endeuor suld be, to prease to feele Christ quicke in your awin harts: that finding him in your harts, and seing him in your minds, baith word and Sacraments may be effectuall: gif not, your sauls remaines dead, yee are not translated fra that death quhairin ye were conceaued.
Therefore all the study of a Christian suld be, quhen they see the Sacraments, and heares the worde, to labour to find and feele in their hearts and mindes, that, quhilk they heare and see, and this cal to find Christ quick in your awin sauls.
This cannot bee, except yee sanctifie his ludging: For gif al the nukis of thy saul remaine a midding, Christ can not dwell there.
And sa, except ye study to a continuall sanctification, and seuer your selfe fra euery thing that seuers you fra Christ; It is not possible, that hee can liue or dwel in you.
This is a great lesson, and it is not possible to doe this, except, as haue said, a stronger come in possesse vs, make vs to renounce our selfs.
Then, the seals had not bene annexed to the word, except for our cause.
For there is na necessitie on Gods part, that God suld ather sweare, or confirme bee seales, the thing that hee hes spoken.
For his word is als good as ony aith or seale: but the necessitie comes of vs.
There is sick a great weaknes in vs, that quhen hee hes sworne, and set his seales to his word, wee are als new to beleife, as gif he had neuer spoken a worde.
Sa to helpe our beleife, our weaknes and inhabilitie that is in vs: For wee are sa vnable be nature, that wee can beleeue nathing, but that quhilk is of our selfis, and the mair wee leane to our selfis, the farther we are fra God.
say, to helpe this wonderfull weaknes, quhairby wee are readie to mistrust God in euerie word, he hes hung to his sacraments, and beside his Sacraments, hee sweares the things that concerns maist our saluation; As yee hard in the Priesthead of Christ, PSAL.
Hee will not speake onely, but he sweares, and that for our weaknes and infirmitie; but gif hee abstract yit the Ministerie of his spirit, all thir means will do na good.
Now, quhat is the last thing? The last is, how the Sacrament is peruerted, and how we are defrauded of the fruit and effect thereof.
Twa sort of faults peruerts the Sacrament, defrauds vs of the profite and vse thereof, and thir faults are ather in the forme or in the person: In forme, gif the essential forme be spoyled, we get nathing: for quhen the sacrament is spoyled of the essentiall forme, it is not a Sacrament.
There is ane essential forme in Baptisme, and ane essentiall forme in the Supper, quhilks gif they bee tane away, yee tyne the vse of the Sacrament.
The essentiall forme of Baptisme is, baptize thee in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the halie Ghaist: Leaue yee out ane of thir three, or do yee it in the name of ony ane of the three persons onely, ye tyne the essentiall forme of Baptisme: In the Supper, gif yee leaue out the least ceremonie, ye tine the essentiall forme; and sa it is not a Sacrament: speake of the essentiall forme, in respect of the Papists, quha keeped the essentiall forme in Baptisme; suppose they haue broght in trifles of their awin mixt with it: yit in respect they keeped the substantiall forme: It is not necessar, that they quha were baptitized vnder thame, be rebaptized.
Indeed gif the vertue of regeneration flowed fra the person, it were some thing: but in respect, Christ hes this to giue to quhome, and quhen he pleasis, the essentiall form being keeped; it is not necessare, that this Sacrament be reiterated.
Now quhat are the faults in the person that peruerts the sacrament? The fault may be, ather in the persoun of the giuer, or in the persoun of the receauer.
(I speake not of they common faults, quhilk are common to all: but of sik faults as inhables the person of the giuer, to be a distributer of the sacrament, taks the office fra him.)
Sa quhe~ the person of the giuer, is this way inhabled, na question, it is not a Sacrament.
Then againe, in the person of the receauer, the fault may bee, gif their children be not in the couenant, but out of it, they get not the Sacrament.
Indeed, if the Parents efterward comes to the couenant, the children, suppose they be gotten out of the couenant, may be receaued.
Siklike in the Supper, gif a man be ladened with ony burthen of sinne, without ane purpose to repent, hee aught not to receaue it.
Sa then, gif yee lack a purpose to repent, ye tine the vse of the sacrament.
It is only this purpose to repent, that maks me, quha receauis the sacrame~t, to get the fruit and effect thereof.
Therefore euerie ane that gais to that Sacrament, looke quhat purpose hee hes in his heart: Hes thou a purpose to shed blood, to ga to harlatry, or to commit ony vther ill vice, or ill turne that is in thy heart, and is not of purpose to repent: in shewing thee to be without repentance, thou shewes thee to be without faith: And consequentlie thou coms to thy damnation, and not to thy saluation.
Now take heed quhat is your purpose, for gif with a dissolute life yee haue a dissolute purpose, yee come to your damnation.
wes of mind, to haue entred particularly to this sacrament, quhilk we haue in hands: but becaus the time is past, som of you (I dout not) are to co~municate on+ly this: Reme~ber that ye addres not your selfs to that table, except yee finde your harts in som sort prepared.
The first gree of preparation stands in contrition, in sorowing for sin, in a feeling of your awin sins, quhairin yee haue offended God.
sorow in your harts, that ye haue offe~ded sa gratious a God: gif ye bee able, as that woman wes, be the tears of a contrit hart to wesh the feet of Christ, humbly to kisse his feet, and to get a grippe of the foot of Christ, suppose yee dare not presume sa high, as to get him haill, ye are in a good case.
But gif thou want all thir, and hes thame not in some measure: thou lacks all the grees of preparation: Therfore lat nane ga to the table, except hee haue thir in som measure.
But quhere there is a displeasure for sin, a purpose to do better, an earnest sobbing and sighing to get the thing that thou wants: In that saul quher God hes placed this desire of Christ; It is the worke of Gods spirit, Christ wil enter there.
And therfore suppose that saul, be far fra the thing that he suld be at: lat him not refuse to ga to the table, but lat him ga with a professioun of his awin infirmity weaknes, with a desire of the thing that he wants.
Euery an of you that finds your selfs this way disposed, lat him ga in Gods name to the Table.
And the Lord work this in every an of your harts, that this Ministerie may be effectuall in you at this time, and that in the righteous merits of Iesus Christ: To quhom with the Father and the halie Ghaist, be all honor, praise and glory, for now and ever, Amen.
THE SECOND SERMON, VPPON THE LORDS Supper in perticular: Preached the eight of Februarie.
For haue receiued of the Lord, that which also haue deliuered vnto you, to wit, that the Lord Iesus in the night that hee was betraied, tooke bread: &c.
WE ended the consideration of the Sacraments in generall, in our last lesson: (weilbeloued in Christ Iesus) Now it rests, that we dresse vs, to the consideratioun of this sacrament of the Supper in particular.
And that yee may the better attaine to the knawledge, and consideratioun of the great variety of mater, that is conteined in this Sacrament of the Supper: sal prease, as God will giue me the grace, to premit certaine things, for the easier vnderstanding of it.
And first of all, sall lat you see, quhat names are giuen to this sacrament in the Bible, and sall shew you some names, that are giuen to the same sacrament be the Auncients.
Nixt wee sal lat you vnderstand, for quhat chiefe ends and respects, this Sacrament wes instituted appointed be Christ Iesus.
Thirdlie, wee sall come to the thinges, that are conteined in the Sacrament, howe thir things are coupled, how they are deliuered, how they are receiued.
And last; we sall meet certaine objections, quhilk may be casten in the contrare of this doctrin; and, as GOD sall giue the grace, wee sall loose thame, and swa end this present exercise.
Now, we find sundry names giuen to the Sacrament of the Supper, in the booke of God, and euery name, caries a special reason with it.
We find this Sacrament, called the body blood of Christ.
This name is giuen it, na doubt, because it is a heauenly and spirituall nuriture; It conteins a nuriture of the saull, that is able to nurish and traine vp the saull, to a life spirituall, to that life euerlasting: For this cause it is called the body and blood of Christ.
It is called also the Supper of the Lorde, to put a difference betwixt it and ane prophane Supper: for this is the Lords Supper, a halie Supper, not a prophane nor common Supper; a Supper appointed for the increase of halines, for the foode of the saull in halines, to feede the saul to life euerlasting.
Not a Supper appointed for the belly, for he had ended that Supper, that was appointed for the bellie, or euer hee begouth this Supper, quhilk was appointed for the saul.
supper, na doubt, hauing respect to the circumstaunce of time, be reason it was first instituted in the article of that time, whe~ they vsed to suppe.
It is called also in the Bible, the Table of the Lord: It is not called the Altar of the Lord, but the Apostle cals it a Table to sit at, and not ane altar to stand at, a Table to take and receaue, and not an Altar to offer propine.
It is called also the Communion, participaon of the bodie and blood of Christ: We haue thir names giuen to it, beside some vthers in the Scriptures of God.
The auncients of the Latine, and of the Greeke Kirks, gaue it sundry names, for sundry respects: They called it a publict action.
And this was a very general name; Sometimes they called it a thanksgiuing: Sometimes they called it a Banquet of loue: sometimes they gaue it ea name, and somtimes ane vther.
And at the last, in the declining estait of the Latine Kirk, and in the falling estait of the Romane Kirk, this Sacrament begouth to be peruerted, and with this decay, there comes in a peruerse name, and they called it the Masse.
They trouble thameselfs meekle concerning the deriuation of this name, quherefra this worde is driuen: Sometime they seeke it fra ane Hebrue origine: Somtime fra an Greeke, and sometime fra ane Latine origine.
But it is plaine, as the word sounds, that it is tane fra ane Latine origine.
And it is a worde quhilk might haue bene tolerable, quhen it was first instituted: For na doubt, the Sacrament at the first institutioun of this word, wes not then halely peruerted: but now, seeing that be the processe of time, corruption hes preuailed sa far, that it hes turned over our Sacrament in a sacrifice: And quhere wee suld take fra the hand of God in Christ, they make vs to giue: This is plaine Idolatry: And therefore quhere the word was tolerable before; Nowe it ought not to bee tolerable in ony way; It aught not to bee suffered.
And out of questioun, gif wee had eaten and drunken, als oft the body and blood of Christ in our harts and saules, as wee haue eaten that bread, and drunken that wine, quhilk are the signes of his bodie and blood: wee wald not haue thoiled this word of the masse; lat be the very action of it, to be sa rife in this Countrey: But in respect, wee haue but played the counterfait, and defrauded our sauls of the bodie and blood of Christ, and tooke onely the outward Sacrament: Therefore it is, that our zeale decayis: Therefore it is that our loue decayis: Therefore it is that our knawledge and light decayis.
And for fault of zeale, loue, and knawledge, the worde of the masse is become customable vnto you, and not onely the word, but the very action.
will not run out heir, am onely tell and you, quhat comes of the abuse of the hearing of the worde, quhat iudgement followes vpon the abuse of the perception of the Sacraments.
ga to the nixt, that is, to the endes quherefore the Sacrament wes appointed.
This Sacrament was instituted in the signes of bread and wine, and wes appointed chieflie for this end, to represent our spirituall nuriture, the ful and perfite nuriture of our saull.
That as he quha hes bread and wine, lacks nathing of the full nuriture of his bodie: sa he, or that saul, quha hes the participation of the bodie and blood of Christ, lacks nathing of the full and perfite nuriture of the saull: To represent this full and perfite nuriture, the signes of bread and wine in the sacra+ment, were set downe and instituted.
The second ende, quherefore this Sacrament wes instituted, is this; that wee might testifie to the warld, and to the Princes of the warld, quha are enemies to our profession, that we might openly avow, and testifie vnto thame our religion, and our maner of worshipping: in the quhilk wee avow and worship Christ: And that wee might also testifie our loue towardes his members, our brethren; this is the second ende quherefore it wes instituted.
The third end, quherefore it wes instituted, is this; to serue for our speciall comfort and consolation, to serue as a souerain medicin for al our spiritual diseases, as we find our selfs ather ready to fall, or prouoked to fall bee the Deuill, the flesh or the warld; or efter that we haue fallen, and are put to flight bee the Deuill, and wald faine flee away fra God; God of his mercie, and of his infinite pitie, and bothomles compassion, hes set vp this Sacrament, as a signe on a high hil, quhairby it may be seene on euerie side, far and neare, to call all thame againe, that haue run shamefully away; and hee clockes to thame, as a Hen dois to her chickens, to gather thame vnder the wings of his infinite mercie.
The fourth end, quherefore this sacrament wes instituted, is this; that in this action, wee might thanke him for his benefites, and rander to him heartie thankes, that hee hes come downe sa familiarlie to vs, bowed the heauens, as it were, and giuen vs the body and blood of his awin Sonne, that we might rander vnto him hartie thankes, and sa sanctifie his benefits to vs: for this thanksgiuing, this Sacrament wes also instituted.
Ye see with your eies, ther is casten before you corporall thinges, visible thinges, sick as the bread and the wine.
There is againe hid fra the eie of your body, but present to the eie of your mynd, spirituall things, heauenly and inward thinges, baith thir are in the Sacrament.
The corporal, visible, and outward things, they are the thinges that are appointed, to signifie the spiritual, heauenly and inwarde things: And quhy? Nathing without a reasoun.
Thir corporall signes are appointed to signifie the spirituall things, be reasoun wee are corporall, we are earthlie bodies, wee haue our saull ludging within ane carnall body, in a tabernacle of claye, a grosse tabernacle, quhilk cannot be walkned nor mooued, except bee the things that are like to it selfe: It cannot be induced to the consideration of heauenlie things, except, be gros, temporall and corporal things.
Gif wee had beene of the nature of the thing signified, that as the thing signified is spirituall and heauenlie, sa wee alway had bene spirituall and heauenlie; we had not mistered a corporal thing.
Siclike, gif the thing signified had bin as we are, corporall, earthlie and visible; wee had not mistered a signe, to cary vs to the consideration of it.
But be reason the thing signified is spirituall, and wee are corporall; therefore to bring vs to the sight of thir spirituall things, he vses a corporal mean and an outward signe.
This is the resoun quherefore thir corporall signes are appointed, to signifie the spirituall thing.
The spirituall thing in baith the Sacraments, is ane the selfe same Christ Iesus, signified in baith the Sacraments: Yit in diuers respects, he is the thing signified in Baptisme, and he is the thing signified in the Supper.
This Christ Iesus in his blood chiefly, is the thing signified in the Sacrament of Baptism; for quhy? be reson that be his blood hee weschis the filth of our sauls; bee reason that be the vertue of his blood, he quickens vs in our sauls, with a heauenlie life; be reasoun that bee the power of his blood, he ingrafts and imps vs in his awin body: for that sacrament is a testimonie of the remissioun of our sinnes; that is of the cleanes of our conscience, that our consciences be that blood, are weschen inwardly.
It testifies siklike, of our new birth, that wee are begotten spiritually to a heauenly life: It testifies sicklike, of the joyning of vs in the body of Christ.
As it is a testimony, sa it is a seale; It not only testifies, but seales it vp in our harts, and maks vs in our harts, to feele the taist of that heauenly life begun in vs; that we are translated fra death, in the quhilk we war conceaued, imped in the body of Christ.
Tak heed then, Christ in his blood, as he is the lawer of our regeneration, is the thing signified in Baptisme.
In this sacrament of the Supper agane, this same Christ, is the thing signified in ane vther respect; to witt, in this respect, as his body and blood serues to nurish my saul to life everlasting; for this sacrament is na vther thing, but the Image of our spirituall nuriture, God testifing howe our sauls are fed, and nurisched to that heauenly life, bee the Image of ane corporal nuriture· Swa, in diuers respects the same thing; that is, Christ Iesus, is signified in baptisme, and is signified in the Supper.
In this Sacrament the fruits of Christs death, quhereof spake, the vertue of his sacrifice, the vertue of his passioun: call not thir fruits nor thir vertues onely, the thing signified in the Sacrament of the Supper; but rather call the thing signified, that substance, that person, out of the quhilk substance, this vertue, and thir fruits dois flow and proceed.
grant to thee, and it is maist certaine, that bee the lawfull vse and participation of the Sacrament, thou art partaker of all thir fruites, yit thir fruites are not the first cheife thing, quherof thou art partaker in this sacrament; but of force thou man get ane vther thing first.
It is true, that na man can be partaker of the substance of Christ, but the same saul mann be also partaker of the fruites that flowis fra his substance: Yit notwithstanding, thou man discerne betwixt the substance, and the fruits that flowis fra the substance, and thou mann be partaker of the substance in the first roume.
Then in the nixt roume, thou mann bee partaker of the frutes that flows fra his substance.
To mak this clear in baptisme, the frutes of baptisme, are remission of our sinnes, mortification, the slaughter of sinne, and the sealing vp of our adoptioun to life everlasting.
The substaunce, out of the quhilk thir fruites dois flow, is the blood of Christ: Ye mann heir of force discerne betwixt the blud quhilk is the substance, and betwixt remissioun of sinnes, wesching and regeneratioun, quhilk are the fruites that flowis fra this blood.
The fruits of the Sacrament, ar the growth of fayth and the incres in halines.
The thing signified, is the substance; that is, the body and blood of Christ is the substance, out of the quhilk, this growth in faith halines dois proceed.
Now see yee not this; yee mann discerne then betwixt the substance and the fruits, and ye mann place the substance in the first roume, sa that the substance of Christ, that is, Christ him selfe is the thing signified in this Sacrament; for your awin experience makis this cleare vnto you: or your stomach be filled with ony foode, yee mann eat the substance of the food first, or yee bee filled with bread, yee man eat the substance of that bread first: Or your drowth bee quenched with ony drinke, yee mann of force, drinke the substance of the drinke first.
Euen sa, efter this samemaner, or the hunger of your saules bee satisfied, and the thirst thereof quenched, yee man eat the flesh of Christ, and drinke his blood first, and that be faith.
Sa consider the ane be the vther; looke to quhat vse bread wine serues to thy body, to the same very vse, the body and blood of Christ serues to thy saull, and hee that appointed the ane to serue for thy body, the same God appointed the vther to serue for thy saul.
Swa look how impossible it is to thee, to be fed with that foode that coms neuer in thy mouth, or to recouer helth of that drog quhilk wes neuer applied, nor come neuer out of the Apothecaries booth: It is als impossible to thee, to bee fed vpon the body of Christ, and to get thy health of the blood of Christ, except thou first eat his body and drinke his blood.
Then ye see, that the thing signified in the supper, is not the fruit sa meekle, as the bodie blood of Christ Iesus, quhilk is the fountaine and substaunce, quhairfra thir fruits dois flow and proceed.
Now say, suppose Christ quha is the thing signified, remaine ay ane, and the same in baith the Sacraments: yit the signes quhairby this ane Christ is signified in the Sacraments are not ane, nor of ane equall number nather: for in Baptisme, the thing that represents Christ, is water: Into the supper, the things that represents Christ, are bread wine.
Water is appointed to represent Christ in Baptisme, and quhy? Hee hes chosen out water, because it is meetest to represent the blood of Christ, to represent our weshing with the blood of Christ.
For quhat is meeter to wesh with, nor water? Sa there is nathing meeter to wesh the saull, nor the blood of Christ.
Into this Sacrament, he hes appointed bread and wine; quhy? Because there is nathing meeter to nurish the bodie, nor bread and wine.
Sa the Lorde hes not chosen thir signes without a reason.
As the signes in the sacraments are not alwayis ane; sa the same in baith, are not of ane number: For in Baptisme, wee haue but ane element, into this Sacrament wee haue twa elements.
Now quhat is the reson of this diuersity, that the Lord in the ane Sacrament, hes appointed twa signs, and in the vther but ane signe? sall giue you the reason: hee hes appointed only ane signe in Baptism, to wit, water: because water is sufficient aneugh to doe the haill turne.
Gif water had not beene sufficient to represent the thing signified, hee wald haue appointed ane vther signe: but in respect, water dois the turne, and represents fullie the weshing of our sauls, with the blood of Christ: quhat mister then haue wee of ane vther signe? Now in this Sacrament, ane signe will not suffice, but there mann be twa: for quhy? Wine cannot be sufficient alane, nor breade can not bee sufficient alane: For hee that hes bread onely, and wine onely, hes not a perfite nuriture corporall; therefore, that they might represent and lat vs see, a perfite nuriture, he hes giuen vs, baith bread and wine: (For the perfite nuriture corporall, stands in meat and drinke) to represent the full and perfite nuriture of the saul.
Looke how full and perfite a nuriture, he hes to his bodie, that hes store of bread and wine; sa hee that hes Christ, laks nathing of a full and perfite nuriture to his saul.
Then ye see the reason, quherfore there is twa signes appointed in this Sacrament, and onelie ane signe in Baptisme.
There rests yit concerning thir signes, twa thinges to bee speered: First, quhat power hes that bread in this Sacrament, to bee ane signe, mair nor the bread that is vsed in commoun houses: quherefra flowes that power? Nixt, gif it hes a power; howe lang indures and remains that power with the bread? As to the first, concerning the power quhilk that bread hes, beside ony vther bread.
sall tel you, that bread, hes a power giuen to it bee Christ, be his institution, be the quhilk institution, it is appointed to signifie his bodie, to represent his bodie, and to deliuer his bodie.
Then speeres thou of the power? That bread, hes a power flowing fra Christ and his institutioun, quhilk vther common bread hes not: Sa that, gif ony of you wald speere, quhen the Minister in this action, is breaking or distributing that bread, powring out, and distributing that wine: gif you wald speare, quhat sort of creatures are yone? ready answere heere; they are halie thinges; yee mann giue this name, to the signes and seales of the bodie and blood of Christ.
That bread of the Sacrament is ane halie bread, that wine is an haly wine, quhy? Because, the blessed institution of Christ, hes seuered tham fra the vse, quhereunto they serued of before, hes aplied tham to an haly vse; not to feed the bodie, but to feed the saull.
This far concerning the power of that bread: It hes a power, flowing fra Christ his institution.
Now the second thing is this: how lang continues this power with that bread? Howe lang hes that bread this office? In a worde, say, this power sticks with that bread, induring the time of the actioun, induring the seruice of the table.
Looke how lang that action continues, and that the seruice of the Table lasts: sa lang it continues ane halie bread, sa lang continues the power with that bread: but looke how soone, the action is ended; sa soone ends the halines of it: Looke how soone the seruice of the Table is ended; that bread becomes common againe, and the halines of it ceasis.
Then this power continues not for ay, but it continues, onely induring the time of the action and seruice of the Table: this far concerning the elements.
There is beside the elements, an vther sort of signes in the Sacrament: there is not a reat nor ceremony in the Sacrament of the Supper, but euerie reat and ceremonie is a signe, and hes the awin spirituall signification with it: As namelie, looking to the breaking of that bred, it represents to thee, the breaking of the bodie and blood of Christ: not that his body was broken in bone or lith, but that it was broken with dolour, with anguish and distres of hart, with the weight of the indignation and furie of God, that he sustained for our sins quhilk hee bure.
Then the breaking is ane essentiall ceremonie: the powring out of the wine, also is ane essentiall ceremonie: For quhy? as yee see clearlie, that be the wine, is signified the blood of Christ: sa bee the powring out of the wine, is signified, that his blood was seuered fra his flesh, and the seuering of thir twa, makes death; for in blood is the life, and consequentlie it testifies his death.
The powring out of the wine, then tels thee, that hee dieth for thee, that his blood was shed for thee: Sa this is an essential ceremonie, quhilk man not be left out.
Siclike, the distribution, giuing eating of that bread, are essentiall ceremonies: And quhat dois the eating testifie to thee? The applying of the bodie and blood of Christ to thy saul: Sa that there is neuer ane of thir reits, but they haue there awin significatioun, and there can not ane of thame bee left out, but yee sall peruert the haill action.
Nowe quhat profite can yee make of all this discourse? Cary mee this lessoun with you, and yee sall make your profite of thir things: In respect that every signe and ceremonie, hes the awin spirituall significatioun: Sa that there is not a ceremonie in this haill actioun, that wants the awin spirituall significatioun.
Take vp this consideratioun, and thinke with your selfes in that time especially, quhen yee are at the Table, and in the sight of that actioun; that looke quhat thou sees the Minister dooing outwardelie, quhat ever it bee: Is hee breaking that bread, is hee dealing that bread? Is hee powring out that wine, and distributing that wine? Thinke weill with thy selfe, that Christ is als bissie doing al thir thinges spiritually to thy saul; hee is als bissie giuing to thee his awin bodie, with his awin hand: hee is als bissie giuing to thee his awin blood, with the vertue and efficacie of it: Siclike in this actioun, (gif thou bee an faithfull communicant) looke quhat the mouth dois, and howe the, mouth of the bodie is occupied outwardelie: Sa is the hand and mouth of the saul (quhilk is fayth) ocupied inwardlie.
As the mouth takis that bread and that wine, sa the mouth of thy saull takis the bodie and blood of Christ, and that bee faith: for bee faith, and a constant perswasioun, is the onely way to eat the bodie, and drinke the blood of Christ inwardlye, and doing this, there cannot but followe a fruitfull manducatioun.
Nowe comes in the matter, quherein gretest difficultie standis, quhereof spak the last day as God gaue me the grace, yit in the particular wee man speake, as weil as in the generall, but somequhat mair schortlie.
Then yee haue to vnderstande for the better informatioun of your conscience, and for the better preparation of your sauls: yee haue to vnderstand how that bread and that wine, quhilk are the signes, are cowpled with the bodie and blood of Christ, quhilk are signified therby; quhat sort of conjunctioun is this, quherefra flowes this conjunctioun, sall be short in it, becaus spak of it at great length the last day.
Take heede, for and yee giue not attendance, it is not possible that yee can take vp this conjunction.
As to this sort of conjunction, how thir twa are cowpled, wald yee knawe it? Doe this first.
Take tent first of all, to the nature of the signes, and to the nature of the thing signified, ye man take tent to baith their natures, and quhy? Be reson nathing can be coupled nor conjoined with an vther, but in sa far as the nature of it will suffer: gif the nature of it wil not suffer ane conjunctioun, they cannot be conjoyned: or will the nature of it suffer a conjunction, looke how far it will suffer a conjunction, sa far are thay conjoyned.
Nowe mann looke to the nature of the things that ar conjoyned? Yis: First of all then, looke to the thing signified, quhat is the nature of the thing signified; looking to this, thou seeis that the thing signified is of a spirituall nature, of a heauenlie and misticall nature; Then conclude, na questioun this spirituall thing wil suffer a spirituall conjunction, a mysticall and secreet conjunction.
Looke over agane to the signe: The signe of his nature, as taulde you in the beginning, hes a relatioun to the thinge signified.
And the thing signified of his nature, hes a relatioun to the signe.
Swa then the signe and the thing signified wil suffer to be conjoyned be ane mutual relatioun: Baith the sign and the thing signified, in respect they haue a mutuall relatioun the ane to the vther, they wil suffer thame selfes to be conjoyned be a relatiue conjunction.
Now speer ye at me, quhat sorte of conjunctioun is betwixt that bread and that wine, and the bodie and blod of Christ.
To tel you in a word, say it is a secreet and spirituall conjunctioun, sick a conjunction as stands in a mutuall respect, betwixt that bread and the bodie of Christ, betwixt that wine, and the blood of Christ.
Then say, it is a secreet and a spirituall conjunctioun.
Thou wald not bee sa inquisitiue of this conjunction, gif it were corporal, visible, or local, gif thou saw thame baith before thine eies, thou wald not speer how they are conjoyned: Or gif thou sawe thame baith in an place; but in respect thou sees but the ane with thine eie, the vther is hid: this makis the conjunction the mair difficill to be vttered and vnderstanden.
And howe is it possible that yee can take vp this secreet and hid conjunctioun· except yee haue the eies of your mind illuminat bee the spirit, quhereby yee may come to the right vnderstanding of it: But gif yee haue ony insight in thir spirituall maters that comes bee fayth, this conjunction sall apeare als cleirly be the eie of your faith, as the Phisicall conjunctioun dois to the eie of your body.
There is ane vther conjunctioun quhilk serues to make this conjunctioun very clear: To wit, the conjunction betwix the worde quhilk speake, and the thing signified bee that same worde.
Speake of things to you in a language that yee vnderstand: As be gods grace ye vndersta~d this language now; speake of things bigane, and it were neuer sa lang syne: speake of things to come, and they were neuer sa far off: speake of things absent and they were neuer sa far distant: Yit sa sone as speake the word; quhither it be of things bigane or to come, the thing it selfe will come in your minde.
The word streiks not sa soone in your eire, but the thing signified be the same worde come in your mind.
Quhat maks the thing signified, suppose it be absent, to com in my minde? This could not be, except there were a conjunction betwix the word and the thing signified bee the worde: As for exa~ple, speake of the King, quha is now a good peece distant from vs, (I pray god saue him) yee will not sa soone hear the word, but the King quha is the thing signified bee this worde, will come in your mynd.
Speake of things bigan, suppose they be already expired, yit the thing signified wil ay com in your mind: Sa there is a conjunction ye see, betwixt the word and the thing signified be the word.
Tak heed to this conjunctioun, and ye sal get the nature of the conjunction, and cowpling of the sign with the thing signified in the Sacrament: for looke quhat sorte of conjunctioun is betwixt the word and the thing signified be the word, that sam sort of conjunction, is betwixt the sacrament, quhilk is sene to the eie of your bo+die, and the thing signified bee the sacrament, quhilk is seene to the eie of your saull onely.
As for example, sa soone as thou seeis that bread tane in the hand of the Minister, thou seeis it not sa soone, but incontinent the bodie of Christ man come in thy minde: thir twa are sa conjoyned, that thay come baith togither: the ane to the outwarde senses, the vther to the inward senses.
This is not aneugh now, but becaus in the institution, ye are commanded to ga farther, and not only to look to that bread and that wine, but to take that bread and that wine: Incontinent as your hand taks the ane, sa your hart taks the vther: as your teeth eats the ane, sa the teeth of your saull quhilke is faith, eats the vther, that is· applies Christ to your saull.
Swa yee see, there is a conjunctioun heir, secreet and mysticall: and therfore Christ cannot be conjoyned but be a secreet and mysticall conjunctioun.
The conjunction betwixt Christ and vs, is a secret and mystical conjunction, quhilk the Apostle EPHES.
This conjunctioun cannot be tane vp at the first: Sa seeing the conjunctioun is secret and spiritual, and not perceaued but be the spirit of God: All is for nocht, except yee haue some portioun and mesure of his spirit; Al that is taught in the word and sacraments, will neuer do you good; will neuer cary your saull to heauen, except the spirit of GOD illuminat your mindes, and make you to finde in your sauls, the thing that ye hear in the word.
Then learne this, seeing the worde cannot bee vnderstand, but bee the spirit of God: craue that the Lord wald illuminat the eies of your mindes be his spirit: and be yee als cairfull to get the spirit, as yee are cairfull nowe in the hearing of the word.
Now ye haue hard, how the signe is conjoyned with the thing signified: Quhat rests there for you to knaw? There rests to knaw, how the signe is receaued, and how the thing signified is receaued; quhider they bee baith receaued with ane mouth or not: quhider the signe and the thing signified, bee receaued efter ane fashion maner or not: And marking me the diuers manner of receauing, and the diuersitie of the instruments: yee sall not easilie erre in the Sacrament.
The signe and the thing signified, are receaued bee twa mouthes, for yee see the signs, that is, that bread and wine, quhervnto thay are geuin, they are giuen to the mouth of the body: Then the mouth of the bodie is the instrument that receuis that bread and that wine, quhilk are the signes.
As that bread, and that wine, are visible and corporall; sa the mouth and instrument quherby they are receaued, is visible and corporall.
The thing signified bee the bread and wine, is not receaued be the mouth of the body: Na, the Scriptures denies that plainelie; but hee is receaued, be the mouth of the saull.
Then there is twa mouthes; that bread, that wine, quhilk are the signs, are receaued be the mouth of the bodie: Christ, quha is the thing signified, is receaued be the mouth of the saul; that is, be a true faith.
Swa, bring me not to the Table, ane mouth onely (for gif yee bring the mouth of your body only, al is wra~g) but bring with you also, the mouth of the saull, a constant perswasion in the death of Christ, and all gaies weill.
Now, as to the maner, how the signs are receaued, the fashion how the thing signified is receaued: Yee may easilie knawe, that thir corporall and naturall signes, mann bee receaued efter a corporall and naturall maner: They mann bee taken, with the hand or mouth of the bodie.
Againe, a supernaturall thing mann bee receaued, efter a supernaturall maner: spirituall thing, mann be receaued, efter a spiritual maner.
Swa, as the signes are corporall, receaued efter a corporall maner, with the hand, or the mouth of the bodie: siclike, the thing signified is spirituall, and receaued efter a spiritual maner, with the hand and mouth of the saull; quhilk is true faith.
Then ye haue shortly tane vp vnto you, the hail preparation, that is necessarie for the vnderstanding of this Sacrament.
Now, quhat doctrin gather of this? Of this last point, quhere say, that Christ is the thing signified, and cannot bee perceaued, but be faith, cannot be receaued nor digested, but bee ane faithfull saull: quhat kinde of perception establish I, in this sacrament? establish na kind of perception of Christ, but a spirituall perception; hee cannot be receaued, nor perceaued but bee faith; and faith is spirituall.
Therfore in the Sacrame~t, establish only a spirituall perception of Christ, and not ane orall, carnall, or fleshlie perceptioun.
This is the ground: now lat see, quhat inconuenient can folow vpon this ground? The Papists sayis, that vpon this ground, this inconuenient sall folowe: gif there be na perception of Christ, but a spirituall perception (say they) then your sacrament is in vaine; this Sacrament of the Supper, was instituted for naught.
And quhat is their reason? Gif there bee na way, sayis the Papists, to perceaue Christ, but be faith; quhat misters you a Sacrament? Yee perceaue Christ be faith in the word, be the naked and simple preaching of the worde yee get faith; sa the simple word may staike you; quhat mister haue yee of a Sacrament; gif yee get not some newe thing in the Sacrament, quhilk yee culd not get in the word? This is their argument, quherof ye see their co~clusion to be this: we get na vther new thing in the Sacrament, vther nor we do in the word: gif there be na perception but spirituall: Ergo, the Sacrament is superfluous.
Wee admit the antecedent to be true, wee get na vther thing, nor na newe thing in the Sacrament, but the same thing, quhilk we gat in the word.
will giue thee to deuise, and imagine with thy selfe, quhat newe thing wald thou haue: Lat the heart of man deuise imagine, and wish; hee durst neuer haue excogitat, to haue sik a thing, at the Sonne of God, he durst neuer haue presumed, to haue pearsed the clouds, to haue gane sa heigh, and to haue craued the Sonne of GOD in his flesh, to bee the food of his saull; hauing the Son of God, thou hes him, quha is the air of al things; quha is King of Heauen and Earth, and in him thou hes all thinges; quhat mair then can thou wish? Quhat better thing can thou wish? Hee is equall with the Father, ane in substaunce with the Father, true God, and true man; quhat mair can thou wish? Then say, wee get na vther thing in the Sacrament, nor we get in the word; content thee with this: But suppose it bee sa; yit the Sacrament is not superfluous.
But wald thou vnderstand, quhat newe thing thou gets, quhat vther thing thou gets: will tell thee; suppose thou get that same thing, quhilk thou gat in the worde; yit thou gets that same thing better: quhat is that better? Thou gets a better grip of that same thing in the sacrament, nor thou gat be the hearing of the worde.
That same thing, quhilk thou possessed, be the hering of the word, thou possessest now mair largely, he hes a greater bounds in thy saull, be the receauing of the Sacrame~t, nor vtherways he could haue, be the hearing of the worde onelie.
Then speers thou, quhat newe thing wee get? say, we get this new thing, wee get Christ better nor we did before, wee get the thing that we gat, mair fullie, that is, with a surer apprehension, nor we had off before; wee get a better grippe of Christ nowe: For be the Sacrament, my faith is nurished, the bounds of my saull is enlarged, and sa, quhere had but a little grip of Christ before; as it were, betwixt my finger and my thoumbe; nowe get him in my haill hande, and ay the mair, that my faith growes, the better grip get of Christ Iesus.
Sa the Sacrament is felloun necessarie, and it were na mair, but to get Christ better, and to get a faster apprehension of him be the Sacrament, nor we culd haue off before: For gif it were true, that the Sacrament is superfluous: be the same reason it sall follow also, that the repetition of the Sacrament, is superfluous; for quhen ye come to the Sacrament the second time, yee gat na vther thing, nor yee did the first time: quhen yee come to the Sacrament the third time, yee gat na vther thing, nor yee did the first time: and yit na man wil say, that the third and second comming is a superfluous thing; and quhy? Because in the second comming, my faith is augmented: vnderstand better, grow in knawledge, grow in apprehensioun, grow in feeling; and getting the grouth of all thir, als oft as come: There is na man will say, that the oft comming to the Sacrament is superfluous, and it were, ilk day ains; Sa their first inconuenient, availes not; wee get na newe thing in the Sacrament: Ergo, the Sacramentis superfluous.
Then there comes on ane vther thing on the same ground: Gif Christ bee not perceaued but be faith; then say wee, na wicked bodie can perceaue him; hee that lacks faith, cannot perceaue him; he that lacks faith, may perceaue that Sacrament of that bread, and that wine, and may eat of that bread, and that wine; but he that lacks faith, may not eat of the bodie and blood of Christ, signified bee that bread, and be that wine.
Sa there is the ground: Na faithles people can perceaue Christ, nor eat the bodie of Christ in the Sacrament.
Against this ground, they delash their artillerie siclike, and they bring their argument out of the same wordes of the Apostle quhilk haue read.
The words are thir: He that eats of this bread vnworthely, sayis the Apostle, and drinks of this cup vnworthely, is guiltie of the body and blood of Christ: Theris their ground; Sa that their argument will suffer this forme, as gif they wald say, efter this maner: Na man can bee giltie of that thing, quhilk hee hes not receaued; they haue not receaued the bodie and blood of Christ: therefore they cannot be giltie of the bodie and blood of Christ: but sa it is; the Apostle sayis, they are guilty: therfore they haue receaued the bodie and blood of Christ.
answere to the proposition, and say, it is very false: They could not be giltie of that bodie and blood, except they had receaued it: For they may bee guiltie of that same bodie, and of that same blood, suppose they neuer receaued it, but tak heed to the text.
The text sayis not, that they eat the bodie of Christ vnworthelie, but it sayes that they eat that bread, and drinks that wine vnworthely.
And yit because they eat that bread, and drinks that wine vnworthelie, they are compted before God, guilty of the body and blood of Christ.
Now quherefore is this? Not because they receaue him, for gif they receaued him, they culd not but receaue him worthelie, for Christ cannot be receaued of any man, but worthelie.
But they are compted guilty of the body and blood of the Sonne of God, because they refused him: For quhen they did eat that bread, and drinke that wine, they might, gif they had had fayth, eaten and drunken the flesh and blood of Christ Iesus: Now because thou refuses the bodie of Christ offered to thee, thou contemns this body offered to thee, gif thou haue not ane eie to discerne and judge, vpon this bodie that is offered: For gif they had had fayth, they might haue seene his bodie offered with the bread, bee fayth they might haue tane that same bodie, be faith they might haue eaten that same bodie; therefore lacking their spowsing garment, lacking faith, quhereby they suld eat the bodie, and drinke the blood of Christ: lacking faith quhilk is the eie of the saul to perseaue, and the mouth of the saull to receaue that bodie, quhilk is spiritually offered, they ar compted guiltie of that same bodie and blood.
Nowe come on, this may be made mair clear be a similitude· Ye see amangs warldly princes, their custome is, they will not suffer their majestie to be interest in the smalest thing that they haue: Quher can there be a smaller thing, that concernis the majestie of a Prince, nor a seall, for the substance of it is but wax, yit gif thou disdainfully vse that seall, and contemne it, and stampe it vnder thy feete, thou art compted als guiltie of his bodie blood as hee that puttis hand in him, and thou wil be handled efter ea way: meikle mair, gif thou come as ane Sow, or as ane Dog to handle the seals of the body blood of Christ, mekle mair may thou be compted to be guiltie of his body, and of his blood.
This far for the eating of the bodie of Christ: The wicked cannot eat the bodie of Christ, but they may be guiltie of it.
The Apostle maks this speach mair clear yit, bee ane vther speach quhilke haue sometime handled fra this place: remember that in the
it is said, that Apostats, they that makis filthie defection, they crucifie the sonne of God agane, and their falling away, maks thame as guilty as they wer quha crucified him.
Hee is now in the heauens, they cannot gett him out of the heauens to crucifie him, yit the Apostle say is they crucifie him: Quhy? Because their malice is als great as theirs that crucified him, becaus they match in malice with thame that crucified him; sa that gif they had him in the earth heir, they would doe the like: therefore they are said to crucifie the son of GOD: Sicklike in HEB.
there is ane vther speach, the wicked are sayd to stramp the blood of christ vnder their feet: Quhy? because their malice is als great as theirs that stramped his blood: Now, they ar compted for this reason to be guilty of the bodie blood of Christ, not because they eat his bodie, but because they refuse it, quhen they might haue had it.
Now the time remaines yit, quherein wee may haue the bodie and blood of Christ, this time is very precious, and the dispensation of times is very secreet, and hes their awin boundes: Gif yee take not this time now, it will away.
This time of grace, and of that heauenlie foode, hes bene dispensed to you very lang, but how yee haue profited, your life and behauiour testifies: Take vp therefore your selues in time, take your penniworthes of it: for yee watt not howe lang it lasts.
Craue a mouth to receaue, als wel the food of your saull that is offered, as yee do the foode of your bodie: and take this time quhile yee may haue it, or assuredly the time sall come, quhen yee sall cry for it, and sall not get it: but in place of grace and mercie, sall come judgment, vengeance, the dispensation of wrath.
They will not leaue this mater sa, but they insist yit, they bring ma argume~ts to prooue that the wicked are partakers of the bodie and blood of Christ.
That bread, say they, yee will grant, quhilk the wicked man eats, is not naked bread, but is that bread, quhilk is the Sacrament: Now they make their argument: the Sacrament hes ever conjoyned with it, the thing signified: but the Sacrament is giuen to all, therefore the thing signified is giuen to all.
Quhat gif grant to thame all this argument? There suld na inconvenient followe: for the thing signified may be giuen to all, that is, offered to all, as it is offered to all men, and yit not receaued of all: Giuen to all, therefore receaued of all, it followes not.
may offer you twa things, yit it is in your awin wil, quhither yee will take thame or not, but yee may take the ane and refuse the vther, yit hee that offers, offered you the thing that yee refused, as truely as the thing quhilke yee tooke.
Sa God deceauis na man nor woman, but with the word and sacraments, assuredly he geuis twa things gif they wald take thame: Into his word, hee offers the word to the eare, he offers Christ Iesus to the saull: Into his Sacraments; he offers the Sacraments to the eie, he offers Christ Iesus to the saul.
Now it may be, that quhere twa things are truly and conjointlie offered, a man may receaue the ane, and refuse the vther, he receauis the ane because he hes ane instrument to take it, hee refuses the vther because he lacks ane instrument: hear the word, because haue ane eare to heare it with: receaue the Sacrament, because haue a mouth to receaue it with: but as to the thing, quhilk word and Sacament represents, may refuse it, because haue not ane mouth to take it, nor ane eie to perceaue it; and therefore the falt is not vpon Gods part, but vpon our part.
The wicked gets the bodie blood of Christ offered to thame conjointlie, with the worde and Sacraments: but the faulte is vpon their parte, they haue not a mouth to take him, and GOD is not bound to giue them a mouth: (Take heed to that) And were not of his speciall grace and mercie, hee geuis me ane eie to perceaue him, and a mouth to receaue him, wald refuse him, as weill as they do.
Sa this argument dow not, Christ is offered to all, ergo, he is receaued of all, happy were they, and they receaued him.
Quhat rests nowe for the full vnderstanding of the Sacrament? There rests yit some things, we man vnderstand now the sacramental speaches, that are vsed in the sacrament: for ye see, we vse to speake of thame, God vses to speake of thame, and the Ancients vses to speake of tham: Wee vse to say, that the saull eats the body of Christ, and drinkes the blood of Christ.
Thir speaches wald be opened vp to you, howe the saull is said to eate the bodie, and drinke the blood of Christ.
Thir speaches are sacramentall; yee are not the wiser yit, but sall make it cleare to you, bee Gods grace.
They are sacramentall, quhat is that? ye know it is proper to the bodie to eat and drink, thir ar the proper actio~s of the body only: Now he ascriues them to the saul, be ane translation, be ane figuratiue maner of speaking, that quhilk is proper to the bodie, is ascriued to the saul, and it is said that the saull eats and drinks.
The eating of the saull man resemble the eating of the body: then the eating of the saul is na vther thing, but the applying of Christ to the saul, to beleue, that he hes shed his blood for me, that he hes purchased remissioun of sinnes to me.
Nowe come on, quherefore cal you this ane eating? Quhat cal ye the eating of the bodie lat see? Eats thou not the bodie, quhen thou applies the meat to thy mouth? Gif then the eating of the bodie bee na vther thing, but the applying of meat to the mouth, the eating of the saull mann be na vther thing, but the applying of the nuriture to the saull.
Then ye see quhat is meaned be the eating and drinking of the saul: Na vther thing, but the applying of Christ to my saull, and the applying of his death and passion to my saull, and this is only done be faith: therfore he that lacks faith cannot eat Christ.
This far for the eating and drinking of the saull, quhilke are sacramentall speaches.
Quhat rests now of al thir great things, of al this doctrine that hes bin taught? learne me but this ane lesson, learne me to apply Christ rightlie to thy saull, and thou hes win all, thou art a great Theolog, and thou haue learned this weil.
For in the right application of Christ, to the sicke saull, to the wounded conscience, diseased hart; heir beginnes the fountain of all our felicitie, and the welspring of al our joy.
And sall tell you, quhat this application workes, looke quhat the presence of thy saull within thee, (suppose thou want Christ in thy saull) dois to this earthlie bodie, to this lump of clay, as be the presence of the saul, it liues, it moues, it feiles, as the saull giues to the bodie, life, mouing, and senses: that same verie thing dois Christ to thy saull.
Hes thou ains gripped and applyed him to thee? As the saull quickens the bodie: sa hee quickens the saull, not with an earthly or te~poral life, but with the life quhilk he liues in heue~: he maks the to liue that same life quhilk the angels liues in heauen: he maks the to moue, not with warldly motions, but with heauenly, spirituall, celestial motio~s: Again, he inspyres in thee, not outward senses, but heauenly senses; he warks in thee a spirituall feeling, that in thine awin heart and conscience, thou may find the effect of this word.
Swa, be the conjunction of Christ with my saull; get a thousand times a greater benefit, nor the bodie dois bee the saull: For the bodie, bee the presence of the saull, gets onlie ane earthly and temporall life, subject to continuall miserie; but be the presence of Christ in my saull, see a blessed life, feele a blessed life, and that same life takes daily, mair and mair increas in me.
Then the ground of all our perfection and blessednes, stands in this conjunction; sa, suppose thou liued METHVSALEMS daies, were euer crauand: Yit, gif in the last houre, thou get this conjunction, thou may thinke thy traueill weil wared, thou hes gotten aneugh: Sa suld yee not bee bissie in crauing, gif yee were to liue a thousand yeare: for gif ye get him in the last houre, ye haue gotten aneugh: gif yee haue gotten Christ, yee haue gotten all with him: Sa the aplying of Christ to my saul, is the fountaine of all my ioy and felicitie.
And how get we this conjunction, lat see? This is a spirituall conjunction; a conjunction, hard and difficile to be purchased, obtained, and gotten of vs: How then is this conjunction brought about, quhilk ar the moyaners of this co~junction, vpon the part of God; and quhilk are the moyaners vpo~ the part of man; to get me Christ, to put Christ Iesus in my saul, and to make Christ Iesus ane with mee? There is ane moyaner vpon the part of God, that helps to get vs Christ; and ther is ane vther vpon our part: vpon the part of GOD, there is the halie spirit: quhat doth he? He offers the body and blood of Christ to mee.
Nowe vppon our part, there mann be a moyaner; or els, suppose he offer, we will not receaue: Therefore, of necessitie, there mann bee faith in our sauls, to receaue that quhilk the halie spirit offers, to receaue that heauenlie foode of the bodie and blood of Christ, quhilk the halie spirit offers.
Then faith and the halie spirite, are the twa moyaners of this spirituall and heauenly conjunction.
Be thir twa moyaners; be faith, and be the halie spirit; get the bodie of Christ; the bodie of Christ is mine, and he is giuen to my saul.
Now heere coms in the questioun: how can thou say, that the bodie of Christ, is giuen or deliuered to thee, seeing the bodie of Christ, is sittand, at the right hand of God the Father? and looke how great distance, is betwixt heauen and earth; als great distance is ther, betwixt the body of Christ, and thy bodie: how then say yee, that the bodie of Christ is giuen to you? The Papistes cannot get this vnderstoode; and therfore they imagin, ane grosse and carnall conjunctioun: except the spirite of God reueale thir things, they cannot be vnderstand; the spirit of God, mann illuminate our minds, and be bissie in al our hearts, or we come to the vnderstanding of this.
Then wald thou vnderstand, how Christ is giuen thee? This ground is true, that the bodie of Christ, is at the right hand of the Father, the blood of Christ, is at the right hand of the father: Yit notwithstanding, suppose there be als great distance, betwixt my bodie, and the body of Christ, as is betwixt heauen and earth, Yit Christs body is giuen to me: and how is he giuen to me? Be reason, haue ane title of his body giuen to mee: the right and title, quhilk is giuen to me of his bodie and blood, makes mee to possesse his bodie and bloode: The distaunce of the place, hurts not my title, nor my right: For gif ony of you, haue a peece of land, liand in the fardest part of Orknay; gif yee haue a good title to it; the distance of the place cannot hurt your title.
Sa say, the distance of place, hurts not my title, and my right, that haue to Christ: But suppose, he be sitting at the right hand of the Father; yit the title and right, that haue to him, makes him mine; sa that may say trulie, this man is my propertie: Then Christ is not made mine, because pike him out of the heauens: but hee is mine, because haue an sure title right to him, and hauing a sure title, and a just right to him, the distance of place, howe far soeuer it be, can on na ways hurt my title, nor my right; but quhaireuer he be, he is mine, because haue a right and title to him.
Yea, not onely, haue a title to him, but this title is confirmed to me: for as get a title to him in the worde, (and gif gat not a title to him in the word; durst not come to the Sacrament.)
Sa in the Sacrament, get the confirmation of my title, get the seale quhilk confirmes my title.
Then to come to the point: Christs bodie is sittand at the right hand of the Father; and yit hee is mine, and is deliuered to me, because haue right to his bodie, be quhere it will; he was borne for me, giuen to me, and deliuered to me.
Swa distance of place, hurts not the surety of my title, as propinquitie of place, helps not the surety of the same.
giue thee, that Christ wald bow the heauens, and twitch thee with his body, as he did IVDAS: Yit this could not helpe thee a quhit; for gif thou had not a title to him, thou durst not call him thine.
Swa it is not the nearenes, nor proximitie of places, that makes Christ mine: It is onely the right that haue to him.
haue right to him, onelie be faith: Sa bee faith onelie, Christ is made mine.
But they think they haue gotten a great vantage of vs, gif wee bee sa far fra Christ, as the heuen is fra the earth; but that sal be tane fra tham also, be gods grace.
haue a title to his bodie; his bodie is distant fra my bodie; yit his bodie is not distant fra me; that is, fra my saull: say, his bodie, and my saull are conjoyned.
That is a strange ledder, that will climbe betwixt the heauen and the earth; get a cord that gais betwixt the heuen the earth, that couples mee and him togither; and this is only true faith.
Be true faith, christ suppose he be in the heauens, is coupled and conjoyned with mee, quha am heere on earth: How can this be? sall shew you how: Is not the bodie of the Sunne in the lift? It is impossible to you, to twitch the bodie of the Sunne; yit the bodie of the Sunne and yee are conjoyned: howe? Be thay same beames that shines on you, be that light that shines on you: Quhy may not the bodie of Christ then, suppose it be in the heauens, be conjoyned with me that am in the earth, to wit, bee the beams, be the light and gladnes, that flowis fra his bodie? my bodie and the body of Christ, are conjoined be the vertue and power that flowis fra his bodie; quhilke vertue and power quickens my dead saull, makis mee to liue the life of Christ, to begin to die to my selfe, and ay the mair die to my selfe, the mair liue to him.
This conjunctioun nowe is the ground as tauld you, of all our felicity and happines, and haue made it clear to you for the present, sa far as God hes yit giuen me insight, gif he geuis ony farther heirafter, as he communicats it, yee sall haue it.
Alwaies yee see this conjunction is moyaned, be twa speciall moyans, be the moyan of the halie spirit, and bee the moyan of faith: Gif there bee na vther moyaner, but thir twa, quhy craues thou a carnall or a visible conjunctioun? Faith is invisible, and the spirit is inuisible: therefore thou cannot see it nor tak it vp with the eie of thy bodie, the power of the halie spirit is sa subtill, secreet, and invisible, that thou cannot perceaue it, nor take it vp with the eie of thy bodie, and he wil work great effects in thy saul, or ever thou take vp his working.
In respect therefore, that the moyaners of this conjunctioun are sa subtill, secreet, spiritual, quhy thinks thou to get a sight of this conjunctioun with the eie of thy bodie? Quhy imagins thou sick a carnall conjunction, as this quhilk wald not do thee good, suppose thou had it? Knawis thou not that the spirit, that cowples vs and Christ is infinite, sa that it is als easie to the spirit, to couple Christ and vs, how far distant that ever wee be, as it is easie to our saull to cowple our head, and the feet of our body, suppose they be distant.
Then, seing this conjunctio~ is the ground and fountaine, of all our happines, and seeing this ground of happines is sa subtill, and sa spirituall, quhat is your parte? Remooue all your outward senses: Remooue al your natural motions, remoue your naturall discourses, and your naturall reason, and followe the sight and informatioun of the spirit of God: Craue that it wald please him to illuminat your vnderstanding, that bee the light of his spirit, ye may se cleirly the spirituall conjunctioun.
Except the eie of the spirit be giuen you to take vp this spirituall conjunctioun: It is not possible that yee can get any insight in it.
But will the Lord of his mercy bestowe some measure of his halie spirit vpon you, out of question, ye sall sone come to the vnderstanding of it, ye sall thinke the time happy, that ever ye heard this word.
Except ye haue some parte of this spirit, it is not possible that yee can be spirituall: that quhilk is born of flesh and blood, man remane flesh and blood, except the spirit come in make it spirituall: therefore yee man be borne agane of the spirit, yee man be borne in the bodie of Christ, his spirit man quicken you.
This is called the quickening and liuing spirit of Christ bee IOHN, sa sone as this spirit coms in vs, quhat dois it? It chases away darkenes out of the vnderstanding: quhereas before knewe not God, now see him not onely generallie, that hee is a God, but that hee is a God in Christ.
Quhat mair dois the halie spirit? He opins the hart as wel as the mind: quhat dois hee there? That same thing quherevpon bestowed the affectioun of my hart, and imployed the loue of my saull, is be the working of the halie spirit made gaull to me, he maks it vennome to me, and to bee as deadlie hated of me, as poyson.
He workes sick ane inward disposition in my saull, that hee maks me to turne flie from that same thing, quhervpon imployed my loue of before, and to imploy it vpon God.
(this is a greate perfectioun) Alwaies in some measure, he maks me to loue God, better then any vther thing: hee changes the affections of my saull, hee changes the faculties, and qualities of my saull, and suppose our hartes and mindes be made newe, yit the substance of thame is not changed, but only the faculties and qualities are changed, in respect of the quhilk change, wee are called new creatures, and except yee be found newe creatures, yee are not in Christ.
Now to come to the point, this secret conjunction is brought about be fayth, and be the halie spirit; be faith wee gripp the body blood of Christ: and suppose wee be als far distant, as Heauen earth ar, the spirit serues vs as a ledder to conjoyn vs with Christ: As the ledder of IACOB, quhilk reached fra the grounde to the Heauen, to the selfe same vse serues the spirit of God, to conjoyne the bodie of Christ with my saull.
Then take vp all in a word: quhat maks you to haue ony right, or title to Christ? Nathing but the spirit, nathing but faith: Quhat suld bee your studie then? Prease be al means possible to get faith, that as PET. Act.
saies, your harts and consciences may be sanctified be faith.
And gif yee prease not as weill to get faith in your hartes, as in your minds, your faith avails not.
Quhat avails the faith, that fleets in the fantasie, and brings a naked knawledge, without the opening of the hart, and consent of the will; Swa thair man be ane opening· of thy heart, and ane consent of thy will, to doe that thing that GOD bids doe, or thy faith availes not.
Then prease to get faith in your harts and minds, and doing sa, yee do the dutie of Christians.
This is not done without the dilige~t hering of the word, and diligent perception of the Sacraments.
Sa, bee diligent in thir excercises, and be diligent in prayer: Praying in the halie Ghaist, that he wald nurish your saules inwardly, with the bodie and blood of Christ, that he wald increase faith in your hartes and mindes, make it to grow vp mair and mair daily, quhill ye come to the ful fruition of that blessed immortalitie.
Vnto the quhilk, the Lord of his mercie bring vs, and that for the righteous merits of Christ Iesus.
To quhome with the Father and the halie Ghaist, be all honor, praise, and glory, for nowe and ever Amen.
For haue receiued of the Lord, that which also haue deliuered vnto you, to wit, that the Lord Iesus in the night that hee was betraied, tooke bread: &c.
WE heard (welbeloued in Christ Iesus) in our last lessoun, quhat names was giuen to the Sacrament of the Supper, als wel in the book of God, as bee the Auncients of the Latine and Orient Kirks.
Wee heard the cheife ends, quherefore, and quherevnto this haly Sacrament was instituted.
We heard the things that were contained into this sacrament, quhat they war, how they are coupled, how they ar deliuered· and how they are receaued.
Wee heard also some objections, that might bee casten in the contrair of this doctrine: wee hard thame proponed, and as God gaue the grace, refuted.
And last of all, we hard how the faithful saul, is said to eat Christ his bodie, and to drink his blood: Wee heard the maner how Christ is, or can be receaued of vs: And we concluded in this point; that Christ Iesus, the Sauiour of mankind, our Sauiour, cannot be perceaued, nor yit receaued, but bee a spirituall way and apprehension; nather the fleshe of Christ, nor the bloode of Christ, nor Christ himselfe; can be perceaued, but be the eie of faith; can bee receaued, but bee the mouth of faith, nor can be gripped, but be the hand of faith.
Nowe faith is a spirituall thing: for faith is the gift of GOD, powred downe in the hearts and mindes of men and women, wrought in the saull of euery ane, and that bee the mightie working, and operatioun of the halie spirite.
Sa, the onely way to grippe Christ beeing bee faith: and faith of the awin nature beeing spirituall; it folowes therefore, that there is not a way to get a grippe of Christ, but ane spirituall way· There is not a hand to grippe Christ, but ane spirituall hand, there is not a mouth to digest Christ, but ane spiritual mouth.
The scriptures familiarly be al thir terms, points out the nature efficacie of faith.
Wee are saide to eat the flesh of Christ be faith, and to drinke his blood be faith in this Sacrament, cheifly in doing of twa thinges.
First, in calling to our remembrance, the bitter death and passioun of Christ, the blood that hee shed vpon the Crosse, the Supper quhilk hee instituted in remembrance of him, before hee gaid to the Cros.
The commandement quhilk he gaue: Do this in remembrance of me: say, we eat his flesh, drinks his bloodspi+ritually.
First, in this point, in recording and remembring faithfully, how he died for vs, howe his blood was shed vpon the Crosse.
This is the first point; a point that cannot be remembred trulie, except it be wrought be the mighty power of the halie spirit.
The second point of the spirituall eating, stands in this; that I, and euery ane of you, beleeue firmlie, that he died for me in particuler: That his blood was shed on the Crosse, for a full remissioun and redemptioun of mee, and my sinnes· the cheife and principall point of the eating of Christ his fleshe, and drinking of his blood; standes in beleeuing firmlie, that that flesh was deliuered to death for my sins, that that blood of his, was shed for the remissioun of my sinnes: and except euerie saull come neere to him selfe, and firmly consent, agree, and be perswaded that Christ died for him, that saull cannot be saued; that saull cannot eat the flesh, nor drink the blood of Christ.
Then the eating of the fleshe, and drinking of the blood of Christ; stands in ane faithfull memorie, in ane firme beleife, and in ane true applying of the merites of the death and passioun of Christ to my awin conscience in particular.
There was sundrie things objected against this kind of perception; and will not insist to repeat thame, but beside all the objections, quhilk yee heard objected against this kinde of spirituall perceptioun bee faith: They say, gif Christ his fleshe, nor his bloode, bee not perceaued, nor receaued but be the spirit; bee faith in the spirite, then say they, yee receaue him but be ane imagination.
Gif he be not receaued carnally, nor corporally, but onely bee the spirite, and bee faith: then is he not receaued, but be way of imagination, conceat, and fantasie.
Sa they count faith, ane imagination of the mind, ane fantasie and opinion, fleeing in the harnes of man.
cannot wite thame to think sa of faith: for as nane can judge of the sweetnes ofhony, but they that hes taisted of it: Sa, there is nane can discerne nor judge vppon the nature of faith, but they that hes felt, taisted in their harts quhat it is.
And gif they had taisted and felt in their sauls, quhat faith brings with it; alace, they wald not call that spirituall iewell, and onelie iewel of the saul, ane imaginatioun; they call it ane imagination, and the Apostle descriuing it HEB.
cals it ane substance, and ane substantiall ground: Looke howe weill thir twa agrees, an imagination, and ane substantiall ground; they call it ane vncertaine opinioun, fleeting in the braine and fantasie of man: He cals it ane euidencie and demonstration in the same definition.
See howe plat contrary, the Apostle and they are in the nature of faith.
Vpon this, they inferre, that as it is true in the generall, hee cannot bee deliuered nor giuen, but that same way that hee is receaued; and looke quhat way, any thing is receaued, that same way it is giuen deliuered: sa efter thame, he being receaued be way of imagination, hee is also in their fantasie giuen and deliuered, be way of imagination.
For gif he be not giuen, say they, to thy hand, to thy mouth, nor to thy stomach corporall; hee cannot be giuen, but be ane imaginatioun, and fantastical opinion.
The reasoun that mouis thame to thinke, that Christ cannot be theirs, nor giuen to thame truly, in effect and really, except he be giuen carnally, is this: that thing quhilk is sa far absent, and sa far distant fra vs: as the heuen is fra the earth; cannot be said, to be giuen to vs, nor to be ours: But with your awin confession, say they to vs, Christ his bodie, is als far absent from vs, as the heauen is from the earth: therefore Christ his bodie, nor his flesh, cannot bee giuen to vs, except bee way of imaginatioun, and so not truelie nor in effect.
This argument framed in this sort, wald appear to haue some force, and moment in the entrie: Yit let vs examine the proposition of it.
The proposition is this: that thing quhilk is so far absent from vs, as the Heauen is from the Earth; cannot be said to be deliuered to vs, to bee giuen to vs, or any way to bee ours.
Now quhither is this propositioun true or fals? say this proposition is flat fals, and the contrair is maist true; a thing may be giuen to vs, may become ours, suppose the thing in person it selfe be as far distant from vs, as the heauen is from the earth.
And how proue this? Quhat maks ony thing to be yours? Quhat makis ony of you to count a thing to be giuen to you? Is it not a title, is it not a just right to that thing? And gif yee haue as just right giuen vnto you, bee him, quha hes power to giue it, and ane sure title made to you, be him, quha hes the power: suppose the thing that he geuis you, be not deliuered into your hand, yit bee the right and title, quhilk hee makis to you, is not the thing yours? This is out of questioun, for it is not the nearnes of the thing to my bodie and to my hand, that makes the thing mine: for it may bee in my hand, and yit not appertaine to me; Nather is it the distance, nor absence of the thing that makes it not to bee mine, but it may be far absent from me, yit be mine; because the title is mine, and because haue gotten a right to it, of him quha hes power to giue it.
Sa this ground is true, it is a sure title, and an just right, that makis a thing, suppose it bee far absent and distant fra vs, to bee ours.
Now subsume: But sa it is, that a liuely true fayth, in the blood and death of Christ, makes vs to haue ane sure title, and ane good right to the flesh blood of Christ, and to his merites, looke quhat he merited be his death, sheding of his blood vpon the cros, al that, togither with himselfe also, apperteins to me, and that be a title ane right, quhilk haue gotten to him of God, quhilk is faith: And the surer that my title be, the mair sure am of the thing, that is giuen me be the title.
Now this Sacrament of the Supper wes instituted to confirme our title, to seale vp our right, quhilk wee haue to the bodie and blood, to the death passioun of Christ, and sa the bodie of Christ is said to bee giuen to vs: the blood of Christ is said to be deliuered to vs, quhen our title, quhilk we haue of him, of his death, of his body and blood, is confirmed in our hartes· for this Sacrament wes instituted, for the growth and increase of our faith, for the increase of halines and sanctificatioun; quhilk faith, the greater that it be in our hartes, the mair sure are wee, that Christ his death apertains to vs.
grant to thee, as haue saide, that the flesh of Christ, is not deliuered in my hand, his flesh is not put in my mouth, nor enters not in my stomach: Yit, God forbid, that thou say, he is not truly giuen.
For suppose Christs flesh bee not put in thy hand, nor mouth of thy bodie (and quherefore suld it? Hes he not appointed bread and wine for the nuriture of the body, and may they not content you? are they not sufficient to nurish you to this earthly and temporall life? hee hes appointed Christ to be deliuered, to the inward mouth of the saull, to be giuen in the hand of thy saule, that thy saull may feed on him, and be quickned with that life, quherewith the Angels liues, quhairwith the Son of God, and God himselfe liues: Sa the flesh of Christ, is not appointed to nurish thy body, but to nurish thy saul in the hope, yea in the growth of that immortall life) And therefore say; suppose the flesh of Christ be not deliuered in the hand of my body; yit it is deliuered to the part that it suld nurish; the saull is the part that it suld nurish: Therefore to the saul it is deliuered: yea that bread, that wine, are na mair really deliuered to the body, and to the hand of the body; nor the flesh of Christ, is deliuered to the saul, to the hand mouth of the saul, quhilk is faith.
Therefore, craue na mair a carnal deliuerie, nor panse not vpon an carnal receuing.
Thou man not think, that ather God giues the flesh of Christ, to the mouth of the body, or that thou, be the mouth of thy bodie, receauis the flesh of Christ.
For yee man vndersta~d this principal in the Scriptures of God; our saull cannot bee ioyned, nor bound with the fleshe of Christ, nor the flesh of Christ cannot be ioyned with our saull, but be ane spirituall band; not by ane carnall band of blood or allya, nor bee the twitching of his fleshe, with our flesh.
But he is conjoyned with vs, be ane spirituall band; that is, bee the power and vertue of his halie spirit: And therefore the Apostle sayis,
that be the moyan of his halie spirite; all wee quha are faithfull men and women, are baptized in one bodie of Christ; that is, we are conjoyned, and fastned vp with ane Christ, bee the moyan (sayis hee) of ane spirite; not bee ane carnall band, or be ane grosse conjunction; but anelie be the band of the halie spirite; that same halie spirit that is in him, is in every ane of vs in some mesure: And in respect ane spirit is in him, and in vs: Therefore wee are counted al to be ane body, and to be members of ane spirituall, and mysticall bodie: and in that same vers he sayis; We are all made to drinke in ane, and the selfe same spirit, that is: Wee are made to drinke of the blood of Christ, and this blood is na vther thing, but the quickening vertue power that flows fra christ and fra the merites of his death.
We are made all to drinke of that blood, quhen wee drinke of the liuely power and vertue that flows out of that blood: Sa there is not a bande, that can couple my saull with the flesh of Christ, but anely a spirituall band, and ane spirituall vnioun; therefore it is that the Apostle
sayis: Hee that is cowpled with God, and conjoyned with our Lord, is ane spirit with him, and IOHN, in his third chap. sayis: That quhilk is borne of the spirit, is spirit: Sa it is onelie, be the participation of the halie spirite, that wee are conjoyned with the flesh and blood of Christ Iesus; that carnall band, quhither it bee the band of bloode, running thorowe ea race; or bee the carnal twitching of flesh with fleshe: that carnall band, was neuer esteemed off be Christ, in the time he was conuersant heere vpon earth, hee lute nathing of that band; and as he hes left behind him in his booke; he had neuer that carnal band, in ony kind of reuerence nor estimation, in respect of the spirituall band: but as to the spiritual band, quhairby we are coupled with him be an spirite; he euer esteemed of this band, in the time that hee was conuersant in the warld: and in his booke, hee hes left the praise and commendation of the spirituall band.
To lat you see, how lightly hee estemed of the carnal band, of the blood and alya, quhilk we regard sa meekle.
for there they come to him, and they say, Maister, your mother, your brother and kinsfolks stands without, and wald see you, and bee at you: yee heare his answere to their demand; how litle hee esteemes of that carnall band, he answers in the
verse, in a maner, denying that band, and he sayis: They are my mother and brethren, quha heares the word of GOD and dois it: as gif he wald say; it is not that carnall band that esteme off, it is not that carnal conjunctioun that reuerence; it is the spirituall conjunction, be the participation of the halie spirit, quhairby wee are moued to hear the worde of God, to giue reuerence to it, and to obey it.
This carnall band, was neuer profitable as that same, LVK.
dois plainly testifie: For gif the twitching of Christs flesh had bene profitable, the multitude quhair of mention is made in that chapter, that thrusted and preased him, had bene the better be their carnal twiching: but sa it is, that ther was neuer ane of tham the better of their carnal twitching: Therefore the carnal twitching profits na thing.
Sayis hee not him selfe, IOH. to draw tham from that sinister co~fidence, that they had into his flesh onely; my flesh profits nathing, it is onely the spirite that quickens; as to the vther twitching, to twitch him be the haly spirit, be faith in thy saull: this twitching be faith hes ever bin profitable: and wee haue a plain exa~ple of it in the sam chap.
Sicklike, quhair there the poore woman that was lang diseased with ane bloodie issue, be the space of twelue yeares, and had wasted, and consumed ane great part of hir substance, in seeking remeid, shee findis no helpe at the naturall and bodelie Physition: At last, be the vertue of the halie spirit, working faith in her hart; be faith she vnderstands and conceuis, that shee is able to recouer the health of her bodie, the health of her saull at Christ Iesus, quha come to saue baith bodie saull: and vpon this perswasioun quhilk sho hes in her hart, that Christ may cure both bodie and saull, shee comes to him, and as the text sayis, sho preasis thorowe the multitude, quhill she come to him, quhen sho comes to him, it is not saide that sho twitched his flesh with hir hand; in cace the Papistes wald ascriue the vertue quhilk come out of him, to her carnal twitching: But it is said, that sho twitched onely the hemme of his garment with her hand, and with faith, quhilk is the hand of the saull, she twitched her sauiour God and man.
And to lat you vnderstand, that sho twitched him be faith, he sais to her in the end: Go thy way, thy faith hath saued thee, sho twitched him not so soone bee fayth, but incontinent there comes a power out of him, quhilke power and vertue, sho felt be the effect of it in her saull, and he felt it quhen it gaid fra him: The effect quhairby sho felt it, was the health of hir faull, and the effect quhairby hee felt it, was the ganging fra him, and sa soone as he felt it ga fra him, he sayis, quha is this that hath twitched me? PETER, quho was ever maist sudden, answers, and sayis: Thou art thrumbled and thrusted be the multitude, and yit thou speeris quha hes twitched thee, hee answers againe and he sayis, it is not that twitching that speak of: It is ane vther kinde of twitching: There is ane hes twitched me, quha hes drawin a vertue and power out of me.
The multitude taks na vertue fra me: The poore Woman thinking that she had done amisse, and seeing that sho could not be hid, sho coms trimbling, and sho sayis; haue done it: he answers her in the end; and he sayis, depart in peace, thy faith hes saued the, thy faith hes thrawin out a vertue and power out of me, that hath made baith saul and bodie haill.
Sa that this twitching of Christ hes ever bene profitable, is and sall bee profitable.
Lik as the twitching of Christ with the corporall hand, hes neuer bene, is not, nor sall never bee profitable; for quhy? Christ is not appointed to bee a carnall head, to bee set vppon the crags of our bodies, that hee may doe the office of a carnal head thairvnto, to furnish naturall motioun, and senses to our bodie, na, the scriptures cals not Christ ane carnall head: But the scriptures cals him an spirituall head, to be set on the crag of oursaul, that is, to be conjoyned with our saull, that out of him in our saull, may distil haly motions, heauenly senses, that there may flow out of him to vs, ane spirituall and heauenly life.
Then the Scriptures cals him ane spirituall head, as they call vs ane spirituall bodie.
And as the life, quhilk we get from him, is spirituall: Sa all our conjunction with him, is spirituall; and in respect, hee works that same operattion in my saull, quhilk the carnal head dois in the bodie: Therefore hee is counted a spirituall head; Therefore is he counted the head of his Kirk, bee reason he furnishes to hir, spirituall motion and senses, quhilk is the life of the Kirk: Sa to be short, there is nathing in this conjunctioun carnall; there is nathing grosse in it, there is nathing, that may be compast bee our naturall iudgement and vnderstanding: And therfore, quhasoeuer wald attaine, to ony small insight of this spiritul conjunction, betwixt vs and Christ; of force he mann bow downe, and earnestly incall for the spirit, or it is not possible to get ony vnderstanding, and it were neuer sa smal ane insight; how the flesh of Christ and wee are conjoyned, except wee haue some light giuen vs bee the spirit: that is, except our heartes bee walkned, bee the mightie working of the spirite of Christ, this sall remaine, as a dead and a closed letter to vs. Sa yee haue to craue, that the Lord in his mercie, wald walken you, and illuminat your vnderstandings, and mak you to haue a spirituall light, to discerne on thir spirituall things.
Nixt, yee mann studie and be cairfull to remooue all vain cogitations, and earthly fantasies, quhen ye enter to heare of sick ane high mater; yee mann cast off all filthy thoughtes, ill motions, and cairs of the warld; and yee man shake off all things that cloggs your hartes: And thirdlie, yee man come with a purpose to hear the worde, to giue diligent·ear to the worde, and with a sanctified harte to receaue it, with ane purpose to grow increase in halines, as weill in bodie, as in saul, all the daies of your life: And comming with this purpose, na question, the halie spirit sal reueal the things to you that yee want.
And suppose this word passe, and bring not great commoditie for the present, yit the halie spirite hereafter, sal reueale to thee, the truth of that quhilk thou hes heard nowe.
Then this is the point of all, be present in your hartes and mindes, and lat your sauls be emptied of al the cares of the world, that they may receaue that liquour, quhilk is offered in the hearing of this word.
Now go forward, and come to the discriuing of the sacrame~t of the supper, and call this Sacrament of the Supper, ane halie seale, annexed to the couenant of grace and mercie in Christ, a seale to be ministred publikly, according alwayis to the halie institutioun of Christ Iesus, that be the lawful ministerie thereof, the Sacramentall vnioun betwixt the signes, and the thing signified may stande, and this vnion standing, Christ Iesus, quha is the thing signified, is als trulie deliuered to the increase of our nuriture spiritual, as the signes are giuen and deliuered to the bodie, to the nuriture temporall.
Nowe wee sall examine the wordes, and partes of this definition.
First of all, call this Sacrament a seale, bee reasoun that this Sacrament serues to the same vse to our saulls, that a common seale serues to a common evident: As the seall quhilk is annexed to the evident, confirmes and seals vp the truth conteined in the evident: Sa this Sacrament of the bodie and blood of Christ, confirmes and seals vpp the truth of mercie and grace, conteined in the couenant of mercie and grace: for this respect it is called a seall: It is called a halie seall, quhy? Because it is tane fra the prophane vse, quherevnto that bread serued in the night before, that bread is applied to ane halie vse: there is a power giuen to that bread, to signifie the precious bodie of Christ Iesus, to represent the nuriture feeding of our sauls: And in respect, it serues now in the sacrament to sa halie ane vse, therefore call it ane halie seal.
As to this word, it is not mine, it is the Apostles word.
quhere he geuis the Sacrament the same name, and calls it a seall.
And to tell you farther, gif the wisdome of Christ in his Apostle, had bene followed, and gif men had not inue~ted new names of their awn to this Sacrament: but contented and satisfied thame selfes, with the names that God hes giuen bee his Apostle, and that Christ himselfe had giuen to this Sacrament; am assured, nane of thir tragedies nor great stormes and debaites (quhilk neuer wil cease) had fallen out: but quher men will ga about, to bee wiser nor God, and ga beyond God, in deuising names, quhilk hee hes neuer giuen; vppon mens awin inuentions, sicke tragedies and debaits hes fallen out.
lesson be the way; lat na flesh presume to be wiser nor God, but lat tham stoup, and keepe the names quhilk God hes giuen to this sacrament.
say thirdly, annexed to the couenaunt, annexed and hung to the chartour: because it cannot bee called a seale properlie, except it be hunging at ane euident.
Looke quhat it is bee nature, that same thing is it, and na farther; gif it bee not hungin to some euident, it is only the appensioun to the euident, that makes men to count it ane seale: therefore it is nathing esteemed, but being hung to the euident.
Euin sa it is heere, gif that Sacrament be not ministred and hungin to the preached word; to the preaching of the couenant of mercy grace, it cannot be a seale; but looke quhat it is be nature, it is na mair: as be nature, it is but a commoun peece bread, sa it is na mair; gif it bee not hungin to the preaching of the word, and ministred therewith as Christ hes commanded: Therefore say, the seal mann be annexed appended and hungin to the evident, to the preaching of the worde for establishing of the evident, vtherwaies it is not a seall.
But it is not sa with the evident, quhilk is the worde of God: for yee know ony evident will mak faith, suppose it want a seall, and it will serue to make a right, gif it be subscriued without a seall: but the seall without the evident avails nathing: Euen sa it is with the worde of God, suppose the Sacraments be not annexed to the worde, yit the worde will do our turne, it serues vs to get Christ; It serues to ingender beget faith in vs, and maks vs to grow vp in faith: but the seale without the word, can serue vs to na halie vse: therfore say, the seal man be annexed to the worde preached, to the couenant of mercie grace.
Now there followes in the definition, that this seale mann be ministred publiklie: Quherfore say publiklie? to exclude all priuate administratioun of this Sacrament: For gif this Sacrament bee ministred to an priuatly, it is not a sacrament; quhy? Because the Apostle cals this Sacrament a communion; Minister yee it to ane, yee tine the communion: Therefore, gif yee minister it priuatlie, ye tine the sacrament: For this Sacrament, is a communion of the bodie blood of Christ; therefore, of force it mann bee, be way of communication, and sa the action mann be publiklie ministred.
Secondly, this Sacrament mann bee publiklie ministred; quhy? Because Christ Iesus, quha is the thing signified in this Sacrament, is not sick a thing as pertenis to ane man anely; gif it were sa, hee might bee priuatlie giuen and ministred: But seeing Christ, quhilk is the thing signified in the Sacrament, is a common thing, appertaining to euerie faithfull man and woman: therfore, he aught to be commonlie giuen to all, in a common action; in a societie and congregatioun of the faithfull.
Thirdly, this Sacrament is compted a thankesgiuing to God the Father for his benefits: Now it appertains not to ane or twa, to thanke God onelie; but as we are all partakers of his temporall and spirituall benefits: sa we aught all publiklie, to giue him thanks for the same.
Therefore say, in the definitioun, this seale aught to bee publicklie, and not priuatlie ministred, as the Papists dois in their priuate Messe.
This seale mann bee publiklie ministred, according to Christs institution: quherefore say I, Christs institutioun mair, nor mans institution, or Angels institutioun? quhy hauld my selfe at Christs institution? sall tell you quhy; because, a man hes not power, to institute or make a Sacrament; because an Angel hes not power to make or institute a Sacrament: For nane hes power to make nor institute a Sacrament, but he that hes power to giue Christ, quha is the thing signified in the Sacrament: But sa it is, that nane hes power to giue Christ, but ather the Father or himselfe: therfore nane hes power to make or institute a Sacrament, but ather the Father or the Sonne; onely God mann make a Sacrament.
Secondlie, this Sacrament is a part of Gods seruice and worshipping: But sa it is, that nane hes power to appoint ony part of his seruice, or prescriue ony part of his worshipping, but onely GOD himselfe: Therefore nane can make a Sacrament, but God himselfe.
There is na Prince in the earth will be content, to be serued efter ane vther mans fantesie: but hee will prescriue his seruice, according vnto his awin fantasie: Howe meekle mair is it meet, that God suld appoint his awin seruice and worshipping: Therefore there is nather man nor Angell, hes power to institute a part of the seruice of God; the sacraments are ane part of his seruice; therfore, there is na Angel nor man, hes power to institute a Sacramenr.
The greatest style, that ony man in the earth gets in the Ministerie of the woorde and Sacramentes, is that style, quhilk the Apostle giues thame.
There wee are called Stewardes, and dispensours of the graces of God; Ministers of thay mysteries and halie things.
It followes then of this, that wee are not Authours, Creators, or makers of thame; but onely Ministers and dispensers of the Sacraments.
Swa it is cleare, that na man, nor creature hes power to make a Sacrament: Then it mann bee according to the institution of Christ; his institution mann bee keeped: Looke quhat he said, looke quhat he did, looke quhat he commanded thee to do: all that, mann be said, done, and obeyed: Leaue thou a iote of that vndone, quhilk hee commaunded thee to doe, thou peruerts the institution: for there is nathing left in register of that institution, but it is essentiall.
Sa, in the celebration of Christs institution, we mann take tent, to quhatsoeuer he said, did, or commanded to be done: thou mann first say, quhatsoeuer he said; and then do, quhatsoeuer he did; For the ministerie of the Sacrament, man follow efter the worde.
First thou mann say, that quhilk Christ commanded thee to say, and thou man teach, that quhilk hee commanded thee to teach, and then minister the Sacrament.
Then to keepe this institution, we man begin at the saying, say, quhatsoeuer Christ commanded vs, thairester faithfullie doe all that quhilk he commanded to be done.
Swa, quhat call we the word? call the word, the haill institution of Christ Iesus, preached and proclaimed, denounced distinctlie, clearlie, and sensiblie to the people: In sick sort, that gif we leaue ony kind of circumstance or ceremonie of this institution vndone, wee peruert the haill action.
It is agreed condiscended vpon, betwixt vs, quha celebrats this institutioun and all the sects of this warld, quha hes separat thame selues fra this institution, that twa things are necessare, and mann concur to the nature and constitution of a sacrament; to wit, there man be a word, and there man bee ane element concurrand; there is not a sect, but they graunt this, that the worde man concurre with the element, or wee get a Sacrament.
As they are easie to admit this generall, look how easie they are to admit this general, and howe weill wee agree with thame in the generall, quhen it comes to the speciall, and that wee enter into particular in the handling treating of the word, looke how weil we agree in the generall, in the particuler we loope als far sundry: For quhen wee come to dispute, reason on thir particulers; first, quhat wee mean be the word: Secondlie, howe this word ought to bee intreated: Thirdlie, quhat vertue this worde hes: Fourthlie, howe farr the vertue of this worde dois extend the selfe: and last of all, to quhome the words ought to be directed pronounced: In all thir particulers, wee are als far sundrie, as ever wee appeared to agree in the generall.
leaue my conference with any vther sect, and halde me with the Papistes, because wee haue maist adoe with thame.
And first of all wee haue to vnderstande, quhat wee mean be the word, and quhat they meane be it: wee be the worde, as haue said, vnderstands the haill institution of Christ Iesus, quhatsoeuer hee said, quhatsoeuer hee did, or commanded to be done, without eiking, without paring, without alteratioun of the meaning or sens of the word: This wee mean bee the worde in the Sacrament.
Quhat vnderstands the Papistes bee the worde? They preach not the institution of Christ, nor taks not the haill institution, as he left it: but in stead thereof they select, and pyks out of his institution, four or fiue words; and they make the haill vertue of the institutioun, to stand in the foure or fiue words: it maid noght gif they contented thame with they words, because they are the words of the institution: but they eike to they wordes, they paire fra the wordes and alters, the meaning of they same wordes, quhilk they keepe as they pleas.
That yee may ken this; In their Messe quhilk they cal the Supper, wee sal lat you se the substance of it.
deuide the Messe in substantiall things, and accidentall things: To the substance of the Messe there ar three things craued.
There man of force be a preist, that is sick a ane, as taks vpon him the office of our mediator Christ Iesus, to intercead betwixt God man.
Secondlie, to the substance of the Messe is craued, that the Preist offer the bodie and bloode of Christ: Wee come heere to receaue thay thinges; there the Priest offers thame to GOD the Father.
Thirdly, bee this worke, (say they) they obtaine all good things; bee this worke, wrought they obtaine remission of sins, als weill to the dead, as to the quick; but in speciall, they obteine remissioun of sins to the Priest, quha is the distributer, and to him quhom to the Preist applies that sacrafice: And as to the rest of the Kirk, quha are absent, they obteine this remissioun of their sinnes, be this worke generally.
Thir three things are necessare to the substance of the Messe.
As to the accidents that mann concurr to the making of a Messe, they are of twa sortes: Some of thame are alwaies necessar, with out the quhilk that actioun cannot bee: Some are not necessare againe, and the action may bee without thame, but not without a deadlie sinne: Thir things that are necessare, concernis partly the preist, and partelie the action it selfe.
The accidents that are necessary to the Preist, are of twa sorts, an sort are sik, as without the quhilk he ca~not be a preist, the vther sort the quhilk without he cannot be free of dedlie sin: The things without the quhilk hee can not be a Preist are thir: Except he haue power giuen of his Bishop to consecrate, quhilk power is iustified be the vnctioun, and shauing of his croune; except againe hee haue power to speake, that the roofe of his mouth be haill, that hee may speake, he cannot bee a Priest.
Thir twa are alwaies necessare, and concurs to the person.
Vther things againe, are not so necessare: as the Priest man be free fra suspension, fra cursing, deadlie sinne, and all ecclesiasticall pane and censures, thir things are necessare to the person.
There is againe, twa things necessare to the action; ane sort without the quhilk the action cannot be, without the Lords prayer it cannot bee, without the fiue words of the institutioun it can not bee.
Vther things againe are not sa necessare, as the consecration of the place, quhere the Messe is said, the Altar stane, the blessing of the Chalice, the Water, the Murgeons, singing, hee that suld help to say Messe, and the rest.
Swa they and wee in na waies agreis concerning the worde, quhat is meaned be it.
Into the second member, wee are als far sundry, how this worde ought to bee intreated: Wee say the word tane as sayd is, for the hail institution, ought to be intreted efter this maner: First there ought a lawfull Pastour, quha hes his calling of God to intreat it· and this lawful Pastour aught to intreat the word lawfully; quhat is that? he aught to preach it, to proclaim it, and publicklie, with a cleare voyce to denounce it.
He aught to open vpp, and declare the haill parts of it; quhat is the peoples part: and quhat is his awin part; how hee aught to deliuer and distribute, that bread and that wine: how the peple aught to receaue off his hand, that bread and that wine, to informe theirfaith; how they aught to receaue Christ his bodie and his bloode, signified bee that bread, and that wine; as also, he aught to teach thame, howe they suld come with great reuerence to that Table, and communicate with the precious bodie and blood of Christ.
This he aught to doe in ane familiar language, that the people may vnderstand him, that they may heare him, that they may perceaue and take vpp in their hearts, the things that he speakes: For quhat auailes it to you, to heare a thing quhispered, and not spoken out, or gif it be spoken out; quhat availes it you to heare it, gif yee vnderstand it not? For except ye heare Christ in an familiar and hamelie language, ye cannot vnderstand: And except yee vnderstand, it is not possible to you to beleeue; and without beliefe, there is na aplication of Christ; and except ye beleeue, apply Christ to your selfis; your comming to the Sacrament, is in vaine.
Sa of force, gif this Sacrament be lawfullie handled; the Pastour mann preach the institutioun of Christ, that it may be hard, in ane familiar language, that it may bee vnderstood; in sicke sort, that the faithfull peple may be informed how to receaue; the Minister may knaw his part, howe to deliuer and distribute.
This we say, suld be the right handling of the halie institutioun of this Sacrament.
Now quhat doe they? They in place of a Minister, Pastour, or Bishop, call him as thou pleasis, quha is called lawfullie of God: they substitute a Priest, and surrogates an hireling, quha hes na calling, or office now in the Kirke of God.
For the office of a Priest, as they vse their Priesthead, is na vther thing, but the office of Christ Iesus, the office of the Mediatour betwixt God and vs.
For they make their Priestes, dailie to offer vp Christ Iesus to the Father.
Nowe this is the Mediatour, Christ his office; and he did it ains for ay, and ains for all, sayis the Apostle: sa that, they can haue na entry, to doe this turne over againe: And in respect, that their Priests preasis to do this turn ouer again, quhilk hee hes done already; they doe it without a co~mand, they haue not a warrand in the word of God, but givand that they had a warrand of their calling, in the booke of God; yit they handle the sacrament al wrang: for quhair they suld speak forth clerly, they whisper, they conjure the elements be an certain kind of quhispering, quhair they suld speak it in ane knawn language, that the people may vn derstand; they speak it in an vn knawn lan guage; and suppose they spak it in an knawin and familiar language: yit in respect they quhisper it, the peple cannot be the better of it.
And quhat sall say, seeing they handle the worde this way; suppose it be the very institutioun it selfe: yit they sa spill it in the handling, that it is not an halie Sacrament: Then we differ als meekle in the second point; howe the worde aught to be handled and intreated.
Now the third point comes in, to wit: quhat vertue this worde hes, how far the vertue of this worde extends the selfe.
In this hed we grant acknawlege, that the word hes a virtue, the word tane, as said is, workes something, euin towardes the same elements of bread and wine; for we acknawledge, that they elements, be the vertue of this worde are changed, not in thair substance, not in thair nature, nor yit in thair substantiall and naturall properties: But we grant, that the elements are chaunged in ane qualitie, quhilk they had not off before: In sick sort, that thir elements are tane fra the commoun vse, quhairvnto they serued of before; and be the institution of Christ, they are applyed now to ane halie vse: Looke howe far, the haly vse differs fra the commoun vse; thair is als great difference, betwixt the elements this day in the actioun, and the thing that they wer yisterday.
For grant that the elements are chaunged; and yit, this element proceeds not of the nature of the elements, fra an closed vertue, supposed to be in the words· nor fra the whispering of the words; but it proceeds, fra the will of Christ, fra the ordinance and appointment of Christ, set downe in his awin institution: for that thing is halie, quhilk GOD cals haly, and that thing is prophane, quhilk God cals prophane.
To lat you vnderstand, how thir signes are made haly, it is necessair that thir twa thinges bee considered.
First, quha is hee that makes thame halie, quhither God, Angell, or man: Secondly, quhaeuer hee be that marks thame halie; be quhat mean and way makes hee thame halie.
And be the consideration of thir twa, we sal com to the consideratioun, and right weying of the sanctification of the elements: As to the first, we say; that God is onelie he, that may make a thing, quhilk was common, to be halie: So wee say, that God be his will and ordinance, declared and set downe in his word; hes made the things that were common be his appointment to bee haly.
As to the way and meane, quhairby they are made halie; it is the word of GOD, the institution of Christ, the will of Christ, declaired in his institutioun, that makes thame halie: For the preachinge and opening vpp of the worde, and institutioun of Christ, lats vs see, that God hes made thir things halie; not onely, that he hes made thame halie, but lats vs see ane halie manner, how they suld be vsed; in quhat place, at quhat time, with quhat heart, and to quhat end.
Sa it is the will of Christ, declared in his institutioun, quhairby the thinges that were commoun before, are nowe made halie.
There is vther twa things also, that maks the same elements halie, and thir twa, are vsed in this institutioun: there is praier and thankesgiuing; for praier and thanks giuing, makes the creatures of GOD to our vse halie: quhair vtherwayis, gif wee receaue the creatures of God like dogs, and thanke him not for thame; it is ane sure taken, that they were neuer Sanctified to our vse.
Be praier, we obtain grace and strength from God, to vse the creatures, and this hail action halilie and lawfullie, as it suld be: And therefore, not onely in this haly action, suld wee begin with God, and at the incalling vppon his name; but in all actions of the warld· wee suld beginne in Gods name.
Sa it is the will of God, praier and thanksgiuing conjoyned with the elements, that makes thame halie: al thir three, contained in the action of the Supper, makes the seales halie: for beside the will of God, declared in his institutioun; In the supper, we vse ane incalling, and in this incalling, wee vse ane thanksgiuing: the Sa the Elements are not made halie bee the worde of God onelie: but be the vse of prayer and thanksgiuing, quhilk three are the onelie mean and way, quhereby thir things are sanctified.
To expresse and declair the sanctification of the elements: the Evangelists the Apostle PAVLE, vses indifferentlie the word TO BLES, and TO GIVE THANKS, and commonlie they place the one word for the vther: for yee see that MARKE, and PAVLE, vsis the worde BLES: MATHEVV LVKE, vses the word TO GIVE THANKS, and all in ane signification: And MARKE himselfe in the
vers speking of the same action of the supper, he vses the word TO BLES, and in the
verse, he vses the word, TO GIVE THANKS, and baith in ane signification; to lat you see that the Apostle, Christ himselfe, and the Evangelists, vses the worde TO BLES, TO GIVE THANKS, indifferentlie, to signifie the sanctification, and consecration of the Elements: except yee take the ane for the vther, it sall bee hard to get ane good mening out of the Apostles words: for remember the Apostle
hee sayis: the cuppe of blessing quhilk wee blesse; quhat is that? take the worde to signifie as haue saide, quhilk wee blesse, that is, quhilk wee sanctifie prepares bee blessing.
Sa to blesse and to giue thanks in the Supper, signifies navther thing, but to sanctifie; or vtherwaies gif yee take the worde in ane vther signification, yee sall fall in ane errour: for quhy? God is said to blesse, and Man is said to blesse: God is said to blesse, quhen he giues good thinges to his creatures, for God his blessing is ever effectuall, therefore he is saide to blesse, quhen hee giues good things.
Man againe is saide to blesse, ather priuatlie or publiklie, quhen he crauis blessing at the hands of God to any man, quhen he blesses in the name, and at the commaund of God, any persone or people.
Nowe if yee ascriue blessing in ony of thir twa significations to the cuppe, it is all wrang: for wee vse nather to craue blessing to insensible Elements, nor yit to blesse thame in the name of God.
And God vses to giue good thinges to the Sonnes of men, and not to insensible creatures: Therefore wee are compelled to vse the word, blesse, in the third significatio: The cup quhilk we blesse, that is, quhilk wee sanctifie and prepares be blissing.
This far wee vnderstand, for the sanctification of the elements.
Now lat see, how they sanctifie ther elements, and quhat is the forme of their consecratioun; sa far as vnderstand of it, stands in thir fiue wordes: Hoc est enim corpus meum.
It stands in thay fiue words; and in the quhispering of thame; for gif yee quhisper thame not, ye tine the fashion of incantation: for the thing that wee call sanctifieng, they call quhispering: And the quhispering of they fiue words, they cal the co~secration of the elements.
And quhen the wordes are efter this way quhispered, they presuppone sick ane hid and monstrous vertue, to bee inclosed in the syllabs; that the vertue and power quhilk flowes fra they wordes, is able to chase away halely, the substaunce of the bread: Sa that the verie bread, and substaunce of it, is altogither destroyed bee this power.
Secondly, that this power that flowes fra thir words, is able to rugg and pull downe ane vther substaunce; to wit, the fleshe and blood of Christ Iesus, that sits at the right hand of his Father, and is able to put it within the compasse of that bread; that is a straunge and ane great vertue, that not onelie will thrawe downe that substance, but put it within the compasse of that bread.
They same fiue words, quhispered in this maner, hes sick a monstrous operation, say they, that they are able baith to chase away the ane substance, to rug downe ane vther, and to put it within the compasse of that bread.
We altogither deny, that ther is sik a vertue in thir wordes: for as haue said before; we deny not that the word hes a vertue, but wee deny that there is sick a vertue inclosed in the wordes: wee deny the qualitie of the vertue, and the quantitie of the vertue, or that it flowes from sic a fountaine.
For we graunt that the word hes a vertue, there is neuer a woorde that God spake heir, but it hes a vertue joyned with it: but we deny that this vertue is inclosed in the sillabs, in the whispering or pronouncing of the words: for gif there were sic a vertue and power inclosed in the sillabs, be that reason it suld followe, that there were a vertue in the figure and shape of the letter that makes vp the wordes.
Now there is na man will thinke, that there is any vertue in the figure, or shape of the letter, and there is as litle vertue in the sillabs, or in pronouncing of the words themselues: Sa wee deny that there is any vertue inclosed in the sillabs, or resident in the worde; but wee say, that there is a power conjoyned with the worde, and this power is not resident in the word, but is resident in the eternal worde, in the essentiall worde, quhereof IOHN makes mentioun in the first of his Evangell.
The worde quhilk wes fra the beginning, that is, the Son of God Christ Iesus.
We say there is not a dram weight of this vertue, and power resident in na creature that ever God created: but it is onely resident in Christ Iesus: And therefore there flowes na vertue from the syllabs, nor fra the wordes that ar spoken, but fra Christ his spirit, quha giues the vertue to thay words.
Swa wee differ in this, wee say that there is not a vertue resident in the syllabs; wee say that the syllabs pronouncing of the sillabs, works nathing: but we say that the vertue is resident in the person of the sonne of God, and he workes be his awin word.
Now we say, there cannot be sik a monstrous chaunge, as to say, that the whispering ofsa mony words, suld change the awin substance of the bread, Rug doune the substance of the bodie of Christ, and put his body in sa narrowe ane compas: wee say that cannot bee, and this sall preiue bee thir three rules: to wit, be the veritie of the flesh of Christ Iesus, be the articles of our beleif, and be the true end of the institution of this Sacrament; and sa wee sall see be Gods grace, the infinit absurdities that followes vpon their opinion.
The first principle that lay, is this; seing that Christ Iesus the sonne of God, in the time appointed, toke true flesh of the wembe of the virgin, and vnited himselfe with our nature in ane personall vnioun, to the end, that our nature, quhilk fell altogither fra integrity in the first Adam; might recouer the same in the second Adam; yea, not only the same; but sa meekle the greter, as our second Adam excels the first in all degrees; and in respect he took on ane body, like vnto ours in al things, (sinne excepted:) Sa, of necessitie it mann folow, that the definition of ane true bodie, and the inseparable properties therof, mann be competent to him.
But thir are the inseparable properties; to wit, to be in ane certaine place, to bee finit, circumscriued, visible and palpable: For all thir conueines quarto modo, as the Logicians sayis) to ane body; sa that they cannot bee seperate fra the subject, without the distructioun thereof.
Then reason on this maner; All true humane bodie, is in a certaine place: Christ Iesus bodie is a true humane bodie: therefore it is in a certaine place.
call a place, a certaine condition of ane organical bodie, quherby it comes to passe, that quherever the bodie be, of necessitie, it is limitat within that place, and quhill it is there, it cannot be els quhere.
Craue yee the probation of my proposition, of the Doctors? Read AVGVSTINE, writand to DARDANVS, spekand of this same bodie of Christ: Take away a certaine rome fra the bodies, and they sall be in na place; and gif they be in na place, they are not.
treatise: the bodie (sayis he) into the quhilk the Lord raise; of necessitie it mann be in ane place; but his diuine efficacie and nature, is diffunded euery quhere.
And in his third Epistle, hee sayis, howe meekle that euer the bodie be, or how little that euer the bodie be; it behooues to occupy the bounds of a place.
And besides thir, the historie of the Acts, prooues maist euidentlie, Christs bodie to be in a certain place, as ACT.
the wordes are thir: Quhom the heauen must containe, vntill the time that al things be restored, quhilk God had spoken be the mouth of all his Prophets.
Suppose need not to insist, in the probation of thir things; yit follow foorth.
Secondlie then, reason efter this maner; All humane bodie is finite and circumscriued: but the bodie of Christ is a humane bodie: Quhat warrands of the Doctours haue for this? leaue many purposlie, and takes me onelie to AVGVSTINE: he writ and to DARDANVS; beleeue sayis he, Christ to bee euery quhere, in sa far as he is God, but onelie to be in heauen according to the nature of a true bodie; and in his
beleeue sayis he, the bodie of Christ to be sa in the heauen, as it was in the earth, quhen he gaid vp to heauen: but it was circumscriued in a certaine place in the earth: Ergo, it is sa in the heauen, and consequently, it cannot be in the Messe bread, and ther baith at ane time.
The last reason is this: al humane bodie, is visible and palpable; but Christ hes a humane body, and he is corporally present, as ye say: therfore Christs bodie is visible and palpable.
prieue my proposition, be Christs awin words, tane out of LVK.
Into the quhilk place, to perswade the Apostles of the veritie of his bodie, and to prieue euidently, that it was not fantasticall; he vses the argument tane fra thir twa qualities, and hee commaunds his Apostles to feele and see, latting thame to witt thereby, that as thir twa senses are the maist certaine of all the rest: sa are they maist able to discerne, quhither gif he was ane body, or ane spirite: as gif he wald say; gif be visible and palpable, yee may be out of doubt, that haue an true bodie.
For as the Poet sayis, quhilk TERTVLIAN cites also to this sam purpose.
Be thir arguments, it may be euidentlie seene, how this transubstantiatioun may na wayis stand with the veritie of the bodie of Christ Iesus.
And as it fights with the flesh of Christ Iesus, sa it repugnes directlie against the articles of our beleife: for into our beleife, wee profes that Christ ascended out of this Earth to the Heauen; quhere hee sits at the right hand of the father; quher he gouernes and directs all things in heuen and earth; fra the quhilk place, hee is to come in the last day to judg the warld· This article lats vs see, that he hes fleeted his dwelling, quhilk he had amangs vs in the erth, hes ascended into the heuens, quhere hee sits at the right hand of his Father, and sal remaine there, according to the testimonie of PET. quhilk cited out of Act.
Gif he sits at his Fathers right hand, be to remain in heuen quhil the last day, he is not corporally into the bread: but the article sais, that he sits at the right hand of his fa+ther PET. sais in that place, that he is to be conteined in the heauens vnto the last day: therefore this transubstantiatioun fightes directlie agains the articles of our beleife, the manifest place of the scripture.
Thirdlie, that it fightes agains the end quherfore this sacrament wes instituted, it is mair nor evident: for the end of the Sacrament is spirituall, as the effect that flowes thereof is spiritual, and the instrument quhereby this spirituall foode is aplyed to vs, is also spirituall: But of ane naturall and corporall presence, ane spirituall effect can neuer flowe: therefore the corporall and naturall presens of the bodie and blood of Christ Iesus, repugns directlie to the end of this sacrament: for the corporall presence mann haue a corporall eating, of this eating, follows a digestion in the stomach, the thing that is digested in the stomach, is neuer able to feede thy soule to life eternall: Sa, this corporall presence mann ay tende to ane corporall end, quhilk is directlie contrair to the ende, quherefore this Sacrament wes instituted.
Attour, gif the bred were transubstantiate, it suld become the thing signified; gif it becomes the thing signified, this sacrament suld wante a signe, and sa it suld not be an sacrament: for euery sacrament as ye hard, is ane signe.
Now to say, that the accidents of true bread, as the hew the roundnes of it, that they may serue as signes, that is mair nor follie: for betwixt the signe and the thing signified, there man be ane conformitie: but there is no conformitie betwixt the accidents, and the bodie and blood of Christ Iesus: for gif sa were, the accidents be houed to nurish vs corporally, as the body and blood of Christ Iesus, is appointed to nurish vs spiritually.
Farther, gif the bread become the bodie of Christ Iesus, it sulde followe that hee had ane bodie without bloode: for hee hes instituted ane signe, a pairt to represent his blood.
Alswa, gif there had bene sick a wonderfull thing, as they speake of, in this sacrament, there walde haue bene plaine mention made thereof in the scripture: For God himselfe works neuer a notable worke, but hee vtters it ather in opin tearmes, or priuat termes in the scripture, that thereby he may bee glorified in his wonderfull works; as yee may reade in the Evangell IOHN,
There yee see, that chaunging is manifestlie expressed: Therefore say, gif there had bin sic a monstrous change in thir elements of the Supper, as they affirme, the scripture walde not haue concealed it, but expressed it: but in respect, there is na mention made of this change in the scripture: therefore there is na sic change in this action.
Farther, gif there were sic a change, as they speake, ather it is before their words of consecration be spoken, or followes efter that same word be spoken; gif the change bee before the words of the consecration be spoken, the consecration is superfluous, their proposition is fals; gif the change bee efter the word be spoken, This bread is my bo+die; their proposition is fals also, becaus the worde bread is spoken, or the last sillab of their fiue words bee pronounced.
And yit they obstinatly perseuere, and vrges vs with the letter, affirming that the wordes of Christ are sa plaine, that they admitte na figure.
They wald haue spoken mair aduisedlie, gif they hadde sought counsall of AVGVSTINE, to haue discerned betwixt ane figuratiue speache and ane proper: for hee into the thirde booke, and
Chap. of Christian doctrine, speaks efter this sort, gif the speach says he, appear to command a wickednes or a mischiefe, or to forbidd ane happines, or ane welfair, it is not proper, it is not figurate, and he subjoynes for ane Example, a place out of IOHN.
Except sayis our Master, yee eat the fleshe of the sonne of Man, and drinke his blood, yee haue na life in you: quhereunto AVGVSTINE adjoynes, this speach sayis hee, apeares to command a mischiefe, therefore it is a figurat speach, quhereby wee are commanded to communicate with the sufferings of Christ Iesus, and with gladnes to locke vp in perpetuall memorie, that the flesh of the Lord wes crucified and wounded for vs: for vtherwaies it were mair horrible (as this same AVGVSTINE, maks mention in the second book agains the aduersaries of the lawe) to eat the fleshe of Christ Iesus reallie, then to murther him, and mair horrible, to drink his blood, then to shed his blood; yit notwithstanding, they hauld ay still, on ea tune, and sayis, that thay words aught to bee tane properlie.
Sa that it appeares, that of verie malice, for contradictions cause, to the ende onely, that they may gainstand the truth, they will not acknaledge this to be ane sacramentall speach.
For they are compelled, nil they, wil they in vther speaches of the like sorte, to acknowledge ane figure, as GENE.
All thir speaches are sacramentall, and receauis a kinde of interpretation, yit they malitiously preas to deny vs this in thir words; Hoc est corpus meum quhilke they are compelled to grant in the rest, as specialy quhere PAVL cals the rocke Christ.
Nowe quhen they are dung out of this fortres, they flie als vnhappely to the second: to wit, that God bee his omnipotency, may mak the body of Christ baith to be in heauen, and in the bread baith at ane time: ergo, say they, it is sa. Gif denied their consequent, they wald be weil fashed to proue it: but the questio~ stands not heir, quhither God may do it or not: but the questioun stands, quhither GOD wil it or not, or may wil it or not.
And we say reuerently, that his majesty may not wil it: for suppose it be true, that he may, mony things quhilk he wil not: yit it is as true; that there is mony things, that hee may not will, of the quhilk sort, this is: thir are reduced to twa sorts.
First hee may not will they thinges, that are contrare to his nature, as to be changeable, as to decay, sic vthers.
For gif he might will thir things, they sulde not be arguments of ane puissance, or of ane power, but rather certaine arguments of his impotencie and infirmitie: And therefore suppose he may not will thir things, hee leaues not of to bee omnipotent: but sa mekle the rather, his constant, and invincible power is knawin.
Secondlie God may not wil some things, be reason of an presupponed conditioun, as sick thinges, quher of he hes concluded their contrair of before: of the quhilk sort, is this, whilk is now controuerted: For seing that God hes concluded that all human body, suld consist of organicall partes, and therfore to be comprehended, and circumscriued within ane, and the awin proper place: And als, seeing he hes appointed Christ Iesus to haue the like body, and that not for ane time, but eternallie.
In respect of this determined will, say, God may not will the contrair now, ather to abolishe this bodie quhilk hee hes appointed to be eternall; ather yit to make it at ane time, in respect of ane thing a bodie and not a bodie, quantified not quantified, finite and infinite, locall and not locall.
For to will thir thinges, quhilk are plaine contradicent in thame selfes, hee may not, na mair nor it is possible to him to will a lie.
Swa, it may bee seene of al men, that wee preserue the omnipotencie of God, and with reuerence from our harts, acknawledges him onely, to bee onelie omnipotent, and wils all men to esteeme thame as calumniators, quha abuses the ears of the simple anes, to perswade tham the contrair of vs.
They are not content with this, but they say, that the Lord may wil a contradiction, and make baith the parts to be true at ane time.
And to prooue this, they wald bring in, the miracles quhilk GOD works; as they wald say, euery miracle includes a contradiction.
As for example: God made a virgine to beare a sonn, they thinke this warke brings with it a contradictioun; to beare a sonne, say they, is the ane part of the contradictioun, and to bee a virgine, is the vther pairt of the contradictioun.
This warke is a miracle, but it implies na contradictioun: For concerning the halie virgins birth, therein is na contradiction.
There was a miracle indeede, that a Virgin suld bear a sonne contrare to the cours of nature; for to be a virgin, and yit to haue a child, are not contradictorie, gif she haue conceaued and brought furth be miracle, as did the blessed virgin: but to bee a virgin and not a virgin at ane time, this is the contradictioun.
Sa Christs bodie to bee visible and invisible, locall and not local, at ane time; is in everie respect the like contradiction: and therefore impossible to be true.
Their vther Example of Christs entering in, the doors being closed and shut, quhat apearance of contradiction hes it? Can they preiue that he entered through the doores? and gif hee did, then there wes ane alteration of qualities, and that be miracle; ather in Christs bodie or in the doores, but na contradiction in nature: vnles you know not quhat is a contradiction.
Their third and last example of the fier in NABVCADNEZERS Oven, quhilk consumed the ministers, but hurt not thame that were in the middest of it; apears to be of na weight, be that quhllk hes already bene answered.
They imagin as apears, that in every miracle, a contradiction is implied, quhilk is absurde.
Gif they can prooue that this fier wes baith hotte and cold, then they say some thing to the purpose: but that it burns vp some and hurts not vthers, is na contradiction; because, bee miracles, the force thereof wes repressed.
Swa, this second ground halds fast; God may not will that thing, quhilk implies a contradiction: but sa it is, that the reall presence of the bodie of Christ in the Sacrament, implies a contradictioun; for it makes the bodie of Christ, visible, and inuisible, compast and not compast at ea time: therefore, GOD may not will sick a thing.
Quhen they are dung out of this, they make their last refuge, to an peremptour defence in their opinioun; for say they, Christs body is exemed fra physical rules; for Theologie is not subject to physicall rules.
It is a verie il gathered co~sequence, to say, that we subject Theologie to Physicke; because that wee first, according to Theologie, quhilk is the law of God, and nixt, according to Physicke, quhilk is the lawe of nature, defends the naturall properties, of the true and naturall bodie of Christ Iesus.
Then grant this, that Theologie is not subject to Physick; quhat of this? Ergo, Christs bodie is exemed fra physicall rules.
How followes that pray you? Be quhat law may yee exeme, or can yee exeme the bodie of Christe? Bee the law of nature, ye cannot: for he was maid of the seed of DAVID, and tooke on true flesh of the wembe of the virgin: And far lesse, be the law of God: quhilk is Theologie: For yee knaw, that Christ was appointed from all eternitie, to take on our nature, and to become true man.
Indeed it is true, that the law of God, cannot bee subject to the law of nature: For the law of nature, flows of the law of God, as out of the awin spring: but it is als true, that gif yee exeme Christes bodie, fra the lawe of nature, yee sall exeme it also fra the law of God.
For affirme, that the scriptures sa consents with the law of nature; that gif yee denie the ane, yee sall denie the vther; and gif yee admitte the ane, yee sall admit also the vther.
Therefore, gif you looke weil about you; yee sall finde the bauke in your awin eie: for yee peruert, baith the law of God, the lawe of nature, bee ane new inuented physicke of your awin: for quhasoeuer he be, that attributes to ane, and the self same body, natural and vnnatural properties, quhilk directlie feights agains thame selfs; say, this man peruerts baith true Theologie, and Physicke: but yee, to ane and the selfe same bodie of Christ Iesus, attribute naturall and vnnaturall properties: therfore it is yee that peruerts, baith the vse of true Theologie, and the ordour sett downe, and established in nature.
Craue yee the reason of my proposition? say, it behooues als weill in Theologie, as in Physicke of necessitie, ane of the contradicent enunciations to be false.
But ains to make ane end with you; we sal answer to your last subterfuge.
For sa yee reason; a glorified bodie, is not subject to physicall rules; but Christs bodie is glorified: therefore it is not subject to physicall rules.
First of all, or wee answer directly, we man consider, quherin stands the glorification of ane bodie: then, say, the answere sall be easie: the Apostle PAVL,
Sa also, sayis he, is the resurrection of the dead.
The body is sawen in corruptio~, is raised in incorruption; It is sawin in dishonor, is raised in glorie: It is sawin in weaknes, and is raised in power.
And a litle efter; this corruption mann put on incorruption, and this mortality, mann put on immortalitie.
Be this cleare Antithesis, PAVLE clearlie descriues, the glorification of ane bodie: for hee oppones thir twa; the vnglorified bodie, and the glorified bodie: And to the vnglorified body, he ascriues corruption, ignominie, infirmitie, carnallitie, mortalitie.
To the glorified bodie againe, he attributes incorruptioun, glorie, power, spiritualitie, and immortalitie.
Of this opposition, wee may gather easilie, quhat the resurrection glorification apports to the bodie.
Shortly, bee thame we see, that the body is onely spoiled of corruptioun, shame, infirmitie, naturalitie, and mortalitie: And to take vp all in an word, it becomes, onely spoyled of all the infirmities of our nature; that it may be cled, with ane mair glorious apparrell; as with incorruption, power, glorie, spiritualitie, and immortalitie.
Wee see then that this glorification imports ane change indeed; but beleue na man will be sa mad, as to esteme this change to be made in the sub stance: for gif sa wer, the aulde substance behoued to decay, and ane newe sulde arise: but wee hear na worde of sic things in this descriptio~, as litle is the change made, in the quantitie: for wee hear na word, nather of augmentatioun, nor diminution of any substance, quhilk behoued to be, gif it were in the quantitie.
The fardest that wee can persaue; this mutatioun consists in the qualities, bee the quhilk, the bodie casts of the auld coate of infirmitie, and cleathes it selfe, with the coate of Glorie: For Christ efter hee rais, he baith gaide and come, wes seene and twitched.
Of the things before deduced, it clearlie followes, that in respect the glorie of the bodie of Christ, hes wrought na change in his nature substance; and consequently, in his naturall dimensions; nather yit in any vther essentiall propertie: that therefore the glorificatioun of his bodie, exemes it not fra the rules of physicke.
For sa lang as the nature of ane true bodie remaines, there is na supernaturall gifts, quherewith it may be glorified; war they neuer sa high, sa farre as may bee gathered of the scriptures of GOD, that may hurt, ather the nature, or the natural propertie of it.
For ther is na gift nor qualitie, that may hurt natur, but that gift that is agains nature: but the supernaturall gift, is nather vnnaturall, nather yit agains nature: therefore it cannot hurt nor impaire nature.
And my reasoun is this: They gifts, that decores and beautifies nature, they cannot hurt nor impair nature: but al supernaturall gifts, beautifies and decores nature: Therefore they cannot take away, nather nature, nor yit, the naturall propertie.
They leaue vs not sa, but out of this same doctrine of PAVLE, concerning the glorification of the bodie, they draw ane objection, to prease vs. PAVL grants, that ane glorified bodie, is ane spirituall bodie: but ane spirituall bodie, is ane inuisible bodie: therefore ane glorified bodie, is inuisible; and bee the consequent, the bodie of Christ is inuisible.
Suppose the argument bee not formall; yit to make short, denie your assumption: For gif there were na mair, but that same worde bodie, that word might be ane argument to you, that the spirituall bodie is not invisible.
But yit, to open vpp the matter mair clearlie, according to the minde of PAVL in that place.
verse of that same Chap. shewes the change that sal become in the qualities of the body, be the resurrection: For he sayis of ane naturall bodie, it sall become ane spirituall bodie.
He straight way in the nixt verse, immediatlie following, expones thir twa qualities: for in the
verse, that is called an natural bodie, says he, quhilk is maintained and quickned, be an liuing saul only; sic as Adams was: and againe, that is said to bee ane spirituall bodie, quhilke togither, beside the saul, is quickned with ane farre mair excellent vertue, to witt; with the spirite of God, quhilk descended fra Christ, the second Adam vnto vs.
Then according to this ground, answere with AVGVSTINE ad Constantium: As the naturall bodie is not ane saull, but ane bodie; euen sa, the spiritual bodie, is not said to be a saull, but ane bodie; and bee consequent, it is not inuisible.
But to take vpp this head, sall giue thame onelie ane knot to loose, and sa make an end of this point.
Then reason, gif therefore Christs bodie is naturallie and really in the Supper, be reason that it is glorified, it follows consequentlie, that quhen it was not glorified, it culd not be reallie present: but it wes not glorified quhen this Supper wes first instituted: therefore it wes not reallie present in the bread, at Christs first supper.
Gif his body wes not naturally present in the bred at the first Supper, it cannot be naturally present nowe: For quhatsoeuer yee vse nowe in the administration of your Supper, or of your Messe, call it as ye will, according to your awin confessioun, ye vse it according to the ordinance, forme and maner, that Christ Iesus himselfe vsed in his first Supper: For yee say plainelie in your disputatioun at POYSSIE·, and in all the rest of your workes; That Christ Iesus first of all obserued that form, quhilk yee vse in your Messe, and left it to his Apostles, and to their successors, that they sulde doe the like: and sa bee your awin words, yee haue drawne your selfes in a crucified your Messe.
Quhat can ye answere to this? Ye will not stande dumbe am assured; for maintenance of your religion, yee man say somthing: for gif this reason bear it away, ye haue done with it.
Then wee say, quod the Papistes, that suppose the bodie of Christ, quhilk wes locallie present with the rest of his disciples wes not glorified, yit the bodie quhilk he exhibite in the bread wes glorified.
Yee might as weill haue halden your peace, and saide nathing: For take tent to the wordes of the text, as they are written.
quhere it is saide, hee toke the bread, and quhen he had giuen thanks, hee brake it, gaue to them saying, this is my bodie quhilke is giuen for you, and PAVL.
hes thir wordes, Take, eate: This is my bodye, quhilke is broken for you.
This relatiue quhilk, is relatiue to the bodie, quhilke wes exhibited in the bred: for according to your awin confession, they words are pronounced vpon the bread, directed to it.
But that same bodie wes giuen and broken for vs, that is to say, crucified and demayned with anguish dolors.
To be crucified and broken with anguishe and dolours, can on na waies agree and conueine with a glorified bodie: but the bodie that Christ exhibite in the bread, is sayd of the Evangelists, to be crucified and broken for vs: Ergo, that bodie wes not glorified.
Now last of all, they are not yit content, but sayis, Christ can make the bread his body, and therfore his bodie is really present.
That Christ can make the bread his bodie, wee grant: for Christ beeing God, can do quhatsoeuer hee will: Onelie let them shewe, that Christ will make of reall bread, his reall fleshe, and then this controuersie is brought to ane end.
Christ indeed makes the bread his body, not reallie, but sacramentallie: For Christ hes not a bodie made of bread, his body wes made ains of the pure substance of his blessed Mother: ane vther bodie then this, or oftener made then ains, hes hee nane: quherefore all doctrine that teaches Christs bodie to be made of bread, is impious, and hereticall: The Papists doctrine of reall presence teaches, that Christs bodie in the Sacrament is made of bread, bee changing the bread into his bodie, through force of consecration: quherefore wee may bauldlie truelie conclude, that their doctrine of reall presence, is baith wicked and hereticall.
Now in conclusion of this head, beseke thame, seeing that reasoun failes thame, that they fight not agains God, for maintenance of a lie, how auld that ever it be, (for the Diuell is auld aneugh, and yit he coulde neuer change his nature) but lat thame rather glorifie God, in confessing thir speaches to be sacramentall.
Then quhat is the reason and ground, quherefore the papists pulles downe the substance of the bodie of Christ, and the blood of Christ, and makes the very substance to be corporallie, reallie, and substantiallie in the Sacrament? The reson is this, because they cannot see be their naturall judgement, nor cannot vnderstand be their natural wit, the trueth of this, to wit, how Christes flesh and blood can be present in the Sacrament, except hee bee present to their corporall hand, to their corporall mouth and stomach.
Gif they had an light to inform them, that Christ might be present in the Supper, and not to the hande, to the mouth or stomach: they walde neuer haue thought of sick a monstrous presence, as they compt to be there: but being destitute of the spiritual light, they followe their naturall reasons and maks a naturall and carnall presens.
Swa that yee haue this lessoun to note of this: There is na man that hes not the spi+rit of God to vnderstande this word: this is my bodie, but out of question, he will doe as the Papistes does; that is, he will vnderstande it carnally: and sa they misknowing the right meaning of it, it is na maruell, suppose they and wee differ in this mater.
For will yee speare at the Papist first, gif the true bodie of Christ be there, or gif the true fleshe and blood of Christ be there: he wil say, it is there.
Wil ye speare quherein? He will say in, and vnder, the accidents of the bread and wine, vnder the hewe and roundnes of the breade.
Will yee speare againe at him, be quhat instrument it is receaued? he will tell you be the mouth and stomach of the bodie: sa this is their gros vnderstanding of the bodie and blood of Christ.
Will ye speare at the VBIQVITER, gif the true bodie of Christ be present? he will say it is.
Will ye spear gif it be in, with, or vnder the bred? hee will answere, it is in the bread, contentiuè, that is, that the bread conteines it.
Wil yee speare at him, to quhat instrument it is offered? hee will answere, that the bodie of Christ, is offered to the mouth of our bodie, and that the blood of Christ is offered to the mouth of our bodie, as the Papists dois.
Will ye speare at vs again, how Christ Iesus his true boand blood is present? wee wil say, that they are spirituallie present, reallie presente, that is presente in the Supper, and not in the bread: we will not say, that his true fleshe is present to the hande, or to the mouth of our bodie, but wee say, it is spirituallie present, that is, present to thy spirit and faithfull saull; Yea even als present inwardlie to thy saull, as the bread and wine, are present to thy bodie outwardelie.
Wil ye speere then, gif the bodie and blood of Christ Iesus bee present in the Supper? Wee answere in a word, they are present in the Supper: but not in the bread and wine, nor in the accidents nor substance of bread and wine: And we make Christ to be present in the Supper, because he is present to my saull, to my spirit and faith.
Alswa, we make him present in the Supper; because haue him in his promeis, This is my body, quhilke promeis is present to my faith, and the nature of faith, is to make thinges that are absente in thame selues yit present: And therefore, seeing he is baith present be fayth in his promeis, and present bee the vertue of his halie spirit, quha can say but hee is present in the Supper.
But yit the word wald bee opened vp, quhat wee mean bee the worde present, howe a thing is sayde to bee present and absent? And knowing this, yee sall finde all the matter easie.
saye, thinges are saide to bee present, as they are perceaued bee ony outwarde or inwarde sense, and as they are perceaued bee ony of the senses; sa are they present, and the farther they bee perceaued, the farther present; and be quhat sense ony thing is perceaued, to that same sens it is present.
As gif it be outwardlie perceaued, be ane outward sense; that thing is outwardlie present.
As for example, gif it bee perceaued bee the outward sight of the eie, be the outward hearing of the ear, be the outwarde feeling of the hand, or taist of the mouth; it is outwardlie present: Or gif ony thing be perceiued be the inward eie, be the inward taist and feeling of the saull; this thing cannot bee outwardlye present: but it mann be spirituallie, and inwardly present to the saull.
Sa say, euerie thing is present, as it is perceaued.
Sa that gif yee perceaue not a thing outwardlie, it is outwardlie absent; and giff ye perceaue not a thing inwardlie, it is inwardlie absent.
It is not distance of place that maks a thing absent, nor propinquitie of place, that makes a thing present: but it is only the perception of ony thing be ony of thy senses, that makes a thing present, the not perception, that maks a thing absent.
say; suppose the thing it selfe, were neuer sa farre distant, gif thou perceaue it bee thine outward sense, it is present to thee.
As for example, my body and the Sunn, are als far distant in place, as the heauen is fra the earth; and yit this distaunce staies not his presens to mee: Quhy? Because perceaue the Sunne be mine eie and vther senses; feele him and perceaue him bee his heat, bee his light, and bee his brightnes: Swa, gif a thing were neuer sa far distant, gif we haue senses to perceaue the same, it is present to vs.
Then the distance of place makes not a thing absent to thee, thou haue senses to perceaue it.
Siclike, the propinquitie of place makes not a thing present, it were neuer sa near, gif thou haue not senses to perceaue it.
As for example, gif the sunne shine in thy verie eine holes, gif thou bee blinde, hee is not present to thee, because thou cannot perceaue him.
sweete tune will neuer bee present to ane deafe ear, suppose it bee sung in the eare of that ma~, becaus he hes not a sens to perceaue it: And a weill tauld tale will neuer be present to a foole, because hee cannot vnderstand it, nor hes not judgement to perccaue it.
Swa, it is not the neernes, northe dista~ce of place that makis any thing present or absent, but onelie the perceauing, and not perceauing of it.
Nowe the worde being made cleire, speere yee howe the bodie of Christ is present? To giue our judgement in aword, as yee haue hard fra time to time, he is present, not to the outward senses, but to the inwarde senses, quhilk is faith, wrought in the saull.
For this actioun of the Sacrament and of the Supper, is partlie corporall, and partelie spirituall.
call this actioun partely corporall, not in rerespect only, that the objects, that is, that bread and wine are corporall: but also in respect my mouth, quhervnto thir things are offered; the instrument quherby, and the maner how thir things are receaued, are al corporall natural.
call the same action againe, partlie spirituall; not only, in respect of Christ Iesus, quha is the heauenlie and spirituall thing of the Sacrame~t; but also in respect of my saul, quhervnto Christ is offred and giuen: in respect the instrument quhereby, and the maner how he is receaued, are all spirituall: For gett not Christ corporallye, but spirituallie.
Swa, in thir respects, call this action, partlie corporall, and partlie spirituall.
Now confound me not thir twa sorts of actions, the corporall and naturall signs, with the spiritual thing, signified therby: Confound not againe, the mouth of the bodie, with the mouth of the saull: Confound not thirdlie, the outward manner of receauing bee the hand of the bodie, with the spirituall maner of receauing, be the hand of the saull.
And sa it sall be exceeding cleare to see, that ilke thing sal be present to the awn instrument, that is; the bodie of Christ, quhilk is the spirituall thing signified, sall be present to the spirituall mouth and hand; and the bread and wine, quhilk are the corporal signes, are present to the corporall mouth and hand.
Then howe is any object present? corporal object, is corporallie present, and ane inwarde object, is inwardly present: Of quhat nature is the thing signified? It is of ane heauenlie nature.
Then speare ye, how he is present? He is spirituallie and heauenlie present to thy saull, the mouth of thy saul; quhilk is faith.
For it were a preposterous thing, to mak the thing signified present to thy bellie, or to the mouth or eie of thy body; for gif sa were, it suld not be spirituallie present: Because euery thing is present, as it accords to the awin nature: Is it a bodily thing, it is bodilie present, and gif it be a heauenlie thing, it is spirituallie present.
Sa thinke, na man can doubt, how the bodie of Christ is present; hee is not carnallie present, but spirituallie present to my saull, and to faith in my saull.
Now the last part of our conference, is this; we haue to consider, to quhome the words aught to be directed pronounced: For we and the Papists differs in this last head.
Wee say, that the words aught to be directed and pronounced vnto the people, to the faithfull communicants.
They, be the plat contrair, sayis, that the words aught not to be directed, nor pronounced to the people, but to the elements; and not to bee clearely pronounced, but quhispered on the elements: Sa that, gif they be spoken to the people, or spoken openlie, their charme auails not.
Now say, as the actioun is peruerted be thame in all the rest; sa they peruert it in this point also; in speaking that to the dumb elements, quhilk they suld speake to the people of God.
For sall prooue it clearly be three arguments, tane out of the Scriptures, that the words aught not to be spoke~ to the bread, but to the people of God.
And first say, the promises of mercie and grace, aught to bee directed and pronounced to thame, in quhome the Lord performes thame, and makes tham effectuall.
But sa it is, that the promises of mercy and grace, are performed and made effectuall, not in bread and wine, but in faithfull men and women: Therefore, thir promises suld bee directed to faithfull men and women.
And this promise, is made to na vther thing, but to faithfull men and women; and sa to tham onely, it aught to be directed.
Secondly, we haue to consider, that this sacrament, seales vp a couenant of grace and mercy.
Now quhom with makes God his couenant of mercie and grace? Will he make a couenaunt with a peece bread, or anie dumb element? There is na man will enter in a couenant with his seruant: lat be to enter in a couenant with a dumbe element.
Sa in respect, this Sacrament seals vp a couenant; this couenaunt of necessity, man be knit vp with ane faithfull saul, and not with the dumbe element: and therefore, thir words cannot be directed to the elements.
Thirdlie, looke to the end, quherefore this Sacrament was appointed: Is it not to lead vs to Christ? Is it not to nurish my faith in Christ? Is it not to nurish mee in ane constant perswasioun of the Lordes mercie in Christ? Was this Sacrament appointed to make the elements Gods? Na: For will yee marke Gods purpose in this institution; ye will find, that Christ hes not set down his institution, to nobilitat the elements, to fauor and respect the elements, quhilk were bread and wine yisterday, to bee Gods to day.
Wee on the contrair, sayis plainelie, that the institutioun of Christ, lookes not to the elements, to alter their nature.
Indeed, it is appointed to alter vs, to chaunge vs, and to make vs mair and mair spirituall, and to sanctifie the elements to our vse.
But the special end, looks to this; to make vs halie, and mair and mair to growe vpp in a sure faith in Christ, not to alter the elements, nor to make thame Gods.
And therefore, be all thir three argumentes, it is euident, that the words, aught not to bee directed to the elements, but to the people faithfull communicants.
Now to make an end of this, there is ane thing, without the quhilk, wee cannot profit; lat vs discourse neuer sa lang, vppon the right vnderstanding of the Sacrament.
Yee see nowe, all that is spoken, concerning the Sacrament, is grounded and depended vppon fayth: Haue a man faith, albeit it were neuer sa small, hee getts some grippe of Christ, and some insight in the vnderstanding of this Sacrament: but lacking faith, suppose a man paine him selfe, to make the Sacraments neuer sa sensible, it is not possible, that hee cann gette a grippe of Christe, or onie insight in him: For without faith, wee can not bee Christians; wee can nather get a sight of God, nor feele God in Christ, without faith.
Faith is the onelie thing, that translates our saules out of that death and damnation, quhereintill wee were conceaued and borne, and plants vs into life.
Swa the haill studie and indeuour of a christian sulde tend to this.
To craue that the Lorde in his mercie walde illuminat his minde, with the eie of fayth, and walde kendle in his heart a loue of fayth, and worke in his hart, a thirst and desire of the object of fayth, and mair and mair to thirst and hunger, for the food of fayth, that nurishes vs to life eternall.
Without this fayth, (howsoeuer the naturall man, and vnderstanding natural wald flatter thy selfe,) surely there is na blessednes, but all his life is mair nor terrible miserie.
For quhatsoeuer it be that flatters and pleases thee nowe, bee it a thought or motioun of the minde, or an action of the bodie, that pleases the now without fayth: the same verie motioun cogitatioun, and actioun, sall torment thee efter this: Swa without faith, it is not possible to please GOD: and quhatsoeuer pleases not GOD, is doone to torment thee.
Therefore craue mercie, for quhatsoeuer motioun, cogitatioun, or actioun, quherein thou hes offended GOD, or bee that same, GOD sall offend and torment thee: And to eschew the offence of God, there is na moyane, but be true faith.
Therefore the study of a Christian suld be, to grow in faith.
Now bee hearing of the woorde, thou gets faith, and bee receauing of this Sacrament, thou getts the increase of fayth: and hauing faith, the receauing of the Sacrament sall bee fruitfull: But without faith, thou eats thine awin condem. nation.
Sa, the haill studie of ane Christian, is to get faith; and this faith cannot be obtained with idlenes, but be earnest praier: Therefore lat euery ane of you, fall downe, and craue earnestlie this faith, and the increase of it, quhereby, ye may bee worthie receauers of this sacrament, and that for the righteous merits of Christ Iesus: To quhome with the Father, and the haly Spirit: be al honour, praise, and glory, for now and euer.
THE FOVRT SERMON, VPON THE PREPARATION to the Lord is Supper, preached the
Let euery man therefore examine himself, and so let him eate of that breade, and drink of that cup. &c. SVppo&se the doctrine of our tryal and due examination, (welbeloued in Christ Iesus) ought to go before the doctrine receauing of the Sacrament: yit notwithstanding, seing that preparation is alwayes, at all tymes, aswel necessare for the hering of the simple word, as for the receauing of the visible sacrament.
(For no man can heare the word of God frutfully, except in som measure hee prepare his saule, and prepare the eare of his heart how to hear.)
Therefore the doctrine of preparation dew examination mann come in the awn place, and be very necessare for euery ane of you.
The Apostle in the wordes that wee haue redd, interponis his counsaile, and giues his aduise: and not only giues his aduise, bot giues his admonition and command, that we suld not come to the Table of the Lord, that we suld not cum to the hearing of the worde rashlie; but that euerie ane of vs, sulde come to this holy work with reuerence, that we sulde prepare, and sanctifie our selues in some measure: and seing we go vnto the King of heauens Table, it becomes vs to put on our best aray: and in ane word, he takis vp the haill doctrine matter of this preparation, quhill as he sayis: Let euery man, and let euery woman trye and examine them selues, as gif he would say: let euery ane of you trye and examine your saules, that is, try the estait of your awin hart, and condition of your awne conscience.
Look and beholde in quhat estaite your hart is with God, and in what estate your conscience is with your neighbour.
He bids not your neighbour try you, hee bids not your companion try your hart: but he bids your selfe in person, try your awin conscience, hee bidds your self trye your awin hart, by reason nane ca~ be certaine of the estait of your hart, or of the co~dition of your co~science, but your self.
Now he secludis not vthers from the triall of you neither, (for it is leisum to the Pastour to try you) but others can nocht try you sa narrowlie, as ye your self can.
For na man can know sa mekill of me, as knaw of my self: na man can be certain of the estait of your heart, and condition of your conscience, and yit ye your selfis may be certaine of it.
As to others, men may judge of your heart and conscience, according to your works and effects, and except your workes and effectes, be very wicked, and altogether vitious; wee are bound in our conscience, to judge charitablie of your hart conscience.
Therefore there is nane sa meet to try the spirite of a man, to try the harte or conscience of a man, as is the man himselfe.
Nowe that this tryall may goe on the better fauoredlie, ye haue first to vnderstand, quhat it is that ye suld try, quhat yee call a conscience, quhilk the Apostle commandes you to trye.
Secondly, yee haue to wey and considder, for what reasons and causes suld yee try your conscience.
Thridly and last of all, yee haue to see in what chief points, ye suld trye and examine your conscience.
Then that we speake not to you of things vnknawne, it is necessare for euerye ane of you (seeing there is nane of you that lakes a conscience) to vnderstand what a conscience is; and so nearely as God shall giue mee the grace, will bring you to the vnderstanding and knawledge of a conscience.
call a conscience, a certain feeling in the hart, resembling the judgement of the liuing God, following vpon ane deede done be vs, flowing from ane knawledge in the minde, accompanied with ane certaine motion in the hart, to wit; feare or joy, trembling or rejoysing.
Nowe wee shall examine the parts of this definition call it first of all, ane certaine feeling in the hart: for the Lord hes left sic a stamp in the hart of euery man, that he doeth not that turne so secretlie, nor so quietly but hee makes his owne heart to strike him, and to smite him: hee makes him to feill in his owne hart, whether hee hes doone weill or ill.
The Lorde hes placed this feeling in the hart; quhy? becaus the eyes of God lookes not sa mekill vpon the outward countenance and exteriour behauiour, as vpon the inward hart.
hee saieth to SALOMON: The Lord searcheth all harts, vnderstandes al imaginations of thoughts.
he sayes, The Lorde shall lighten things that are hid in darknesse, and make the counsels of the hart manifest.
Sa, in respect the Lorde makes him chieflie, to haif to do with the harte; therefore in the harte he places this feeling, quhilk is the chiefe parte of conscience.
say nixt, that this feeling resembles the judgement of God; for this feeling was left and placed in our saule, for this end purpose, that we might haue as domesticke and familiar judgement within our selfes, to subscriue and resemble the secreete and inuisible judgement of the high God; a particular judgement to go before that generall judgement, in that generall and great day, quhere euerie man sall bee justified or damned, according to the particular judgement, that is within his awne conscience.
In the meane time, this conscience is left in vs, to make out our hail proces in this life, to halde in the trauels of the liuing God, as it were, in that last judgement.
For the bookes of our owne conscience in that last day salbe opened, and euerye man sall receaue according to the report of the decreet, that is within his awne conscience; therefore say, that our conscience resembles the judgment of God.
The third thing that say, is this; It follows vpon an deed doon be vs, our conscience, nor our heart strykes vs not, before the deede be done.
Our hart strikes vs not before the euill turne be committed: na, it goes not before the deede, but the straik of the conscience, and feeling of the heart, followis immediatly vpon the deed, in sick sorte, that the deede is not so soone doone be thee, but thy conscience applyis it to thy selfe, and giues out the sentence against thy selfe.
Therefore saye, it is a feeling following vpon ane deede done be vs.
And nixt saye, flowing fra ane knawledge in the minde, for except the conscience haue information, and except the hart knaw that the turne quhilk is done is euil, the hart, nor the conscience, can neuer count it to bee euill.
Therefore knawledge must go before the straik of the conscience.
Thy hart can neuer feele that to be euil, quhilk thy mynde knawis not to be euill.
So knawledge must euer go before feeling, according to the mesure of thy knawledge, according to the nature and qualitie of thy knawledge, accordinglie sall the testimonie and straik of thy conscience be.
For a light knawledge, a doubting and vncertaine knawledge, makis ane light small straik: as in the other part, ane haly and a solide knawledge drawin out of the worde of God, makis ane heauie straike of the conscience: Sa the conscience mann answere to the knawledge.
If wee haue na other knawledge, but the knawledge quhilk we haue by nature, be the light and spoonkes that are left in nature, our conscience will answere na farder, but to that knowledge.
But if beside the light of nature, we haue a knawledge of God in his worde, and a knawledge of God by his holie spirit working in our harts, our conscience then will go farder, excuse, or accuse vs; according to the light that is in the worde: Sa that the conscience is not acquired or obteined, at quhat time wee are enlightened bee the working of the halie Spirite, and hearing of the worde of God; but our conscience is borne with vs, is natural to vs, is left in the saule of euery man woman: and as there are some spunkes of light left in nature; sa there is an conscience left in it.
And gif there were na mair, that same light that is lefte in thy nature, sal be aneugh to condemne thee.
Sa the conscience is not acquired, gotten or begun at the hearing of the worde, or at that time quhen we begin to reforme our selfes, be the assistance and renewing of the halie Spirite: bot euerie man bee nature hes a conscience, and the Lorde hes left it in our nature: and except that this conscience bee reformed according to the worde of God, that same naturall conscience sall be aneugh to condemne thee eternallie.
Last of all, saye, accompanied with a certaine motion of the hart: and we expresse this motion, in feare or joy, trembling or rejoicing.
In very great feare gif the deed be exceeding heynous, and the straik of the conscience be very heauie: Than the conscience takis neuer rest, for guiltines mann euer dreed.
Bot gif the deede bee honeste, godlie, and commendable, it makis a blyth hart, and makis the harte to burst out in joy.
Sa to be short in this matter, (for purpose not to make ane common place of it) ye see that in euery conscience there mann bee twa thinges: First, there mann be ane knawledge, and nixt there mann be ane feeling, quherby according to thy knawledge, thou applyis to thy awin hart the deede doone be thee.
Sa that, according as the word it selfe testifyes, it ryses of twa partis, it ryses of knawledge, according to the quhilke it is called science: and it ryses of feeling, according to the quhilk the CON is put to, it is called conscience.
This conscience the Lord hes appointed, to serue in the saull of man, for manie vses: to wit, he hes appointed euerie ane of your consciencis to be ane keeper a and a careful attender vpon euerie action doone by you: so that that action can not be so secreetlie, so quietly, nor so thifteously convoied, but nil thou, will thou, thy conscience sall beare ane testimonie of it: thy conscience sall bee ane faithfull obseruer of it, and a day sal be ane faithful recorder of that same acti+on: So the Lord hes appointed thy co~science to this office, that it attends and waits vpo~ thee in al thy actions, na thing can slip it.
Sicklike the Lord hes appointhy conscience and placed it in thy saull, to bee ane accuser of thee: so that quhen thou dois ane euill turne, thou hes ane domestick accuser within thy awin saull to finde faulte with it.
Hee hes also placed it in thy saull, to beare ane true and stedfast witnes against thee: yea, the testimony of the conscience resembles not onlie a testimonye or witnes, but the conscience is als good, as ten thousande witnessis.
The conscience also is lefte in the saull, to do the parte of ane judge against thee, to giue out sentence against thee, and to condemne thee; and so it dois· for our particular judgement mann ga before the generall and vniuersall judgeme~t of the Lord, at that great day.
And quhat mair? He hes left thy conscience within thee, to put thy awin sentence in execution against thy selfe: This is terrible: he hes left it within thee to be ane verye torture, and a burriour to thy selfe: and sa to put thy awin sentence in executioun vpon thy selfe.
Is not this an matter mair nor woonderfull, that ane and the selfe same conscience, sall serue to sa manie vses in ane saule, as to be ane continuall obseruer, and marker of thy actions: ane accuser, ten thousande witnessis, a judge, and a burriour and tormentour, to execute thy awin sentence against thy self.
Sa that the Lord misters neuer to seeke a member of court out of thy awin saule, to make out a lawful proces against thee: but thou sall haue all thir within thy selfe, to make out a full proces against thy selfe.
Take heede to this, for there is neuer a word of this that sall fall to the ground, bot ather yee sall feill it to your weill, or to your euerlasting woe.
And this secreet and particuler judgement, that euery ane of you caries about with you; bydis sa sure and sa fast within you, that doe quhat ye cann, gif ye wald imploy your hail trauellis, to blot it out, thou sall neuer get it scraped out of thy saull: gif ye were als malitious and were become als wicked, as euer anie incarnate Deuill was vpon the earth, ye sall neuer get this conscience altogeather scraped out of your saull: But nill thou, will thou, there sall als mekill remaine of it, as sal make thee inexcusable in the great daye of the generall judgement.
graunt thou maye blot out all knawledge out of thy minde, and make thy selfe to becom als blinde as a modewart: grant also, that thou may harden thy hart sa, that thou wil blot out al feeling out of it, sa that thy conscience will not accuse thee, nor finde faulte with thee, but thou sall haue ane delite in ill dooing, without a remorse: but denye that ony gree of wickednes in the earth, sall bring thee to that pointe, that thou may doe euill without feare: but ay the mair that thou dois euill, and the langer that thou continewis in euill dooing, thy feare sall be the greater: yea, in despyte of the deuill, and in despite of all the ma+lice of the hart of man, that feare sall remaine: And suppose they walde baith conspire together, it sall not bee able to them to banish that feare, but that gnawing of the conscience sal euer remaine: to testifie to thee, that there is ane day of judgement: graunt also, that there sall be ane vicissitude, and that feare sall not alwaies remaine, but sall be some times turned ouer in security: Nather sall that security alwayes byde, but sall bee turned ouer again in feare: sa that it is not possible to get this feare hailelie scraped out, but the greater that the security be, the greater sall thy feare be, quhen thou are walkened.
grant thirdlie, that this feare sall be blind; for fra time a man by euill doing, hes banished knowledge out of the minde, and feeling out of the hart quhat can remaine there, bot a blinde feare.
Quhen men hes put out all light, and lefte nathing in thair nature, but darknes; there can nathing remaine, but a blind feare: So graunt, that the feare is blinde, for nather knawe they quhairfra the feare commis, quhat progres it quhereunto it tendes, quhere, nor quhen it sall ende.
Therefore they that this way misseled vp in thair saull, of men in the earth they are maist for als long as thou may keepe in thy minde, a spoonke of this knawledge and spirituall light, in the quhilk, thou may see the face of God in Christ, quherin thou maye see, ane in the death and passion of Christ, and quherein thou may see, the bowellis of mercye offered in the bloode of Christ; gif thou haue any spoonke of this light (albeit it were neuer so little) to direct thee: And albeit this knawledge, were neuer sa euill wounded, yit there is mercie aneugh for thee in Christ.
But gif thou close vp all the windowes of thy saull, of thy hart; make them to become palpable darknes, that thou nather knawe, quhairfra the terrour comes, nor yit seeis onye that is the miserie of all miseries.
Wee haue mony things to lament, we haue the estait of this Countrey to lament; they are not present, quhom to this doctrine speciallie appertains; Alwayis there is nane of you, but yee haue to take heed to your consciences now, quhill laiser is giuen you, that yee bannish not altogither this light, quhilk is yit offered to you, and quhereof, some sponks yit remaines.
For see, the maist pairt of our great men of this countrey, ru~ning headlongs, to banish the spoonke of light that is in thame; and they will not rest, sa lang as there is a spoonke of it left, quhil it be vtterlie bannished; and quhen they haue done sa, alas quhat can folow, but a blind and terrible feare in their conscience, quhilk they can neuer get scraped out.
feare without an outgait, a feare to grow and not to decay, a feare to deuour tham halelie at the last.
Therefore, euery ane of you, take heed to this light that is within you, take heed that the foul affections of your hearts, drawe not your bodies efter thame; see at the least, that they affections bannish not this light, and sa lang as the Lord offers to you this light; in time craue, that of his mercy, he wald giue you that grace to imbrace it, to take vp a new course, yit to amend your liues, quhill yee haue time.
The bodie sall leaue the saull, and the saull sall leaue the bodie; but the conscience sall neuer leaue the saull; but looke quhereuer the saul gais, to the same place sall the conscience repair: and looke in quhat estait, thy co~science is quhen thou dies; in the same estait, sal it meet thee in that great day.
Sa that, gif thy conscience was a burriour to thee, in the time of thy death, gif thou gat it not pacified, in the time of thy death, it sall be a burriour to torment thee in that general iudgement.
Therefore, this matter wald be weill weyed, and euerie ane of you, suld studie to haue an good conscience; that quhen the saul is seuered fra the bodie, leauing your conscience at rest and peace with God, it may bee restored to you, and meet you againe, with als great peace and quietnes.
pray the liuing Lorde, sa to sanctifie your memories, that yee may keepe thir things, and that euery ane of thir things, may sa sticke with you in some measure, that to the ende of your life, yee may remember vpon thame.
The second thing that wee haue to speake off, is this; we haue to try consider, wherfore we suld examin our conscience; for what causes suld a man or woma~ bee mooued to try thair awin conscience and saull: sall take vp the reasons shortlie.
It becomes euery ane of you, to trie your conscience; quhy? Because the Lord will make his residence in na vther pairt of the saull, but in the conscience: he hes appointed his dwelling to be in the hart of man, and into the will and conscience of man: and therefore, it becomes you, to make his dwelling place cleane, and to take heede to your heart.
Nixt, suppose the Lorde of heauen made not residence there; yit, in respect the eie of God is ane eie, and able to pearce thorow the very thicknes of the flesh of man, how darke and grosse soeuer it be, to pearce thorow the very secret hirnes of thy conscience (for vnto the eie of God, the maist secreet hirne of the conscience, is als patent, cleare and manifest; as onie outwarde, or bodilie thing in the earth can bee to the outward eie of the bodie.)
In respect therefore, that his eie is sa percing, and that he casts his eie onely vpon our heart; it becomes vs to try our harts.
Thirdly, he is the Lord of the conscience; There is not a Monarch of the earth, that hes ony soueranitie or lordship ouer the conscience; onely the God of heauen, onlie Christ Iesus, King of heauen earth, is Lord of the conscience; hee hes power onely to saue and tine: Therefore, quhen thou dresses thee to this Lords Table; becomes it thee not to looke vpon thy conscience, to trie thy conscience, and to examine the estait of it? Last of all, quhilk is ane of my chiefest reasons; it becomes thee to trie and examine thy conscience; quhy? Because the welfare and health of thy saull, dependes vpon thy conscience; gif thy conscience that is within thy saull be weil, gif it be at peace and rest, thy saul is weill; gif thy conscience be in an good estait, thy saull mann bee in ane good estait; gif thy conscience be in good helth; of necessitie, thy saull mann bee in good health: For the good health and weill of the saull, depends vpon ane good conscience: Therefore it becomes euerie ane of you, to try weill your conscience.
There is not a law that ever was set down or deuised; but of all the lawes that euer was made, it is leifsom to vs, to haue a care of our health, it is leifsome to vs, to seeke sic things as may procure our helth, preserue entertain our helth; Now subsume: but the helth of thy saull, stands in the health of thy conscience, in preseruiug thereof: Therfore be al laws, thou aught to attend to thy conscience; gif thou keep thy conscience weill, thy saul is in health; and gif thy saul be in health; lat troubles com quhat wil vpon the bodie, thou wilt bear thame out all: But gif thy saull be diseased, gif that dwining siknes occupy thy saull, quhilk ane euill conscience brin gs on, thou salt not be able to beare out the least trouble, that can come vpon the bo+die: quhere as, gif the conscience were at rest, in good health; that trouble could not light vpon thy bodie, but the stre~gth of ane good conscience, suld beare it out.
Then haue yee not reason, and mair nor reasoun, to take tent to your conscience, to examine and trye your conscience, in quhat estait and disposition it is.
Now, because it is ane sauourles jest to tell you, that health is necessare, and not to open vp the way, how this health may be acquired, preserued, and intertained, Therefore, to keepe your conscience in quietnes, and in good health; sall giue you thir few lessons.
First of all tak heed, that ye kepe fast, a perswasion of the mercie of God in Christ Iesus; examin quhen thou lies down, and examin quhen thou rises vppe, in quhat estait thou art with God; quhither thou may looke surely for mercie at his hand or not: art thou perswaded of mercie; assure thy self, thy conscience is at ane good point, thou hes health in thy saul, for be keeping of faith the conscience is preserued, as sayis the Apostle,
Keep this perswasion, halde it haill and sound, hurt it not, bring not thy saul in doubting sa far as thou may, stay not, nor hinder not thy perswasion, gif thou walde keepe health in thy saull: for gif thou doubt, or in onye wayes diminish thy perswasion, and assurance, assuredlye thy assurance cannot so sone be hindered, nor diminished; bot in that same article of time, sall follow, the diminishing of the health of thy saull: Yea, it cannot be, but in that same article of time, followes the hurt of thy conscience, for faith will not dwell, bot in ane haill conscience.
Thairfore in quhat article of tyme thou dois against thy conscience, in that same article of time thou loses ane gree of thy perswasion of the mercy of God: and vnto the time that thou fall downe at the feete of Christ, obtein mercy for that ill deed, purchase peace at his handes, to repaire thy perswasion; thou sall euer doubte of mercie, and want healthe in thy conscience.
Then this is the first lesson, to keep health in your saulles, look and see, that ye be perswaded of mercy.
The second lessoun to keepe a good conscience, or to keepe health in thy saul is this: Yee mann flee, eschewe, and forbeare quhatsoeuer may trouble the helth of your saull, quhatsoeuer may trouble the quietnes peaceable estait of your conscience: Cast it out, forbeare it, and eschewe it.
This generall is good: but quhat is it, lat see, that troubles the quiet estait of the conscience? Nathing in the warld but sinne, nathing in the earth, but an euill nature: Therefore, wee mann of force, to keepe health in our saulle; forbeare and eschew sinne, we mann flee sin, and rid our hand of it.
It is not possible, that yee can baith keepe a good conscience, and serue the affections of your heart: and therefore, to keepe peace and health in thy saull; thou mann bidd thy lustes goodnight: thou mann renounce the lusts and affections of thy heart, and thou mann not doe, as thou was woont to doe: thou mann not bee giuen to the seruice of thine affections, and of thine appetite, to put thame in executioun as thou woont to doe: but incase, thine affection or lust, commaund thee to doe onie thing; quhat is thy part? Thou mann try, howe farre this may stande with the good will of God, and how far that affection quhilk commands thee, may agree with the law of God.
Is there sic an harmony, that that, quhilk thine affectioun commaunds thee, may stand with Gods law and halie will? Na question, it is ane sanctified affection; thou may put it in execution.
But efter this triall, gif thou find thine affection to be exorbitant, and out of rule, carying thee plat fra God, and agains his lawe: Beware of it, resist it: beware, that thou put not the will of it in executioun.
Or vtherway is, gif thou fulfill the will of that affectioun ane hour, quhat pleasure can that bring with it? It may weill bring with it, a flattering pleasure in the entrie: but it closes euer with a bitter remorse in the ende.
Then to eschew this bitter remorse, suld yee not all trie your affections? Yee mann examine and try tham, be the square of Gods law, ye mann see, how far they agree with his law, or how far they disassent from it: and in sa far as, they disassent fra that law: lat euery man denie himselfe, renounce his affections; and swa, this triall being tane this way be thy selfe, it sanctifies thine affections, makes Christ to ludge in thy saull, makes thy conscience to be at rest, and the halie spirite this way, maks baith bodie and saull, to be in good health, and to reioyce.
The third lesson is this, Studie to doe well: Walde thou keepe healthe in thy saull; studie to do better and better continuallie: At least, haue a purpose in thy saull and hart, to take vp a better course dailie.
Quhilk is the last lesson? Seeing that quhen wee studie to doe best, and that the iust man, that is, the maist halie man, fallis sa oft in the daye, as seauen tymes in the daye: yea rather, seuentye tymes seauen tymes, quhat is thy parte in thir slippes, and snappers? Suppose thou fall, as thou can not eschew to fall, ly not still there: sleep not there quhere thou hes fallen: It is a shame to sleepe there, therefore, ryse againe: And how sould thou ryse? Be lifting vp thy saull, and running to the fountaine of grace mercie: bee running to Christ Iesus to seeke to be for a day, or for a year: but it aught to bee euery day, and euery yeare of thy haill lifetime.
For that conscience, that suld rest for euer, with the liuing GOD, that conscience, quhilk mann euer looke vpon the face of the Sonn of God: It can not be ouer wel scowred, we cannot look ouer narrowly to it: the mair curious we be in searching out of this conscience, we are the better occupied: speake of our awn conscience, speak not of our neighbours.
ga to the third, and come to the points quhairintill, euerie an of you, suld trie and examine your selfis.
giue you twa points; quhairintil, euery ane of you, aught to try and examine your consciences.
Try thy conscience first in this point; quhither thou be at peace with God, quha is the Lorde of heauen, or not: Nixt, trie thy conscience in this point: quhither thou be in loue amitie with thy neighbour, or not.
Wald thou knaw, quhither thy conscience, bee at vnitie and peace with God, or not? thou sall knawe it this way.
The God of heauen, hee cann haue na societie, nor can keepe na companie, with that saull, quhilk is alwayis vnclean, that is euery way defiled: na, he cannot.
Now speake not sa precisely, that mak a saull to be fullie sanctified, and perfectlie halie in this life.
Na, in this life, there is wonderful iniquities, grosse sinnes, and great faults, quherewith, euen the righteous ar defiled: But this is my meaning; There is na saull, cann bee at peace with God, or quherewith the Lorde can haue ony societie, but in some measure, it man be sanctified, and made halie: for GOD cannot make residence in a saull, that is a stincking midding alway: and therefore on force, in some measure it man be sanctified; there mann be sa meekle made cleane, in ane nuke or vther of that saule, quherein the Lord of heauen, be his halie spirit may make his residence.
Nowe lat see, quhereby is the saule sanctified? PETER Acts
sayis, that the saull of man is purified be faith; that the heart of man is purged bee faith.
Sa faith opins and purges the heart: bee faith in Christ Iesus, and in the merites of his blood, we haue peace with God.
Being iustified be faith, wee haue peace towards God, thorough our Lord Iesus Christ, sayis the Apostle, ROM.
Nowe comes in this point, ye haue to proue your selfs, quhither yee bee in the faith or not, as the Apostle sayis.
Trie and see, quhither yee haue faith in Christ or not.
Examine, gif your saull be seasoned with this faith: for gif yee haue not faith in Christ; Christ is not in you: and gif Christ be not in you, yee are in ane euil estait, ye are in the estait of the reprobat and damned.
Sa, euery ane aught to looke carefullie, and see, gif hee hes a beliefe in the blood of Christ or not: quhither hee beleeues to get mercie bee his merites, and sanctificatioun be his blood or not: For gif thou haue na measure of this fayth, thou hes na measure of peace with God: Be reason, our peace with God, is ingendered, and grows daily mair and mair be true faith in Christ.
Now this faith, quher it is true, quhere it is liuelie, and couples the heart with God, as haue spoken; it mann breake out in worde and deed: It cannot be halden in, but it mann breake out.
It mann breake out in word, in glorifying the God of heauen, quha hes forgiuen vs our sins: It mann breake out in word, be giuing a notable confession of they sinnes, quherein we haue offended him.
It mann breake out in deed, in doing good workes, to testifie to the warld that thing, quhilk is within thy heart: to testifie to the warld, that thou, quha hes this faith, art ane new man; that bee thy good example of life and conuersatioun, thou may edifie thy brethren, the simple anis of the Kirke of GOD: and that bee thine halie life, thou may draw sinners to repentaunce, that they seeing thy light, they may bee compelled to glorifie God in thee.
Then in the first point of triall, lat vs looke to thir three; to the heart, to the mouth, and to the hand: Take heed, that there be ane harmonie, betwixt thir three, and that they all sing ane sang: for gif the heart, bee inwardly coupled with God; there is na doubt, but the mouth wil outwardly glorifie him: and gif thine hart and mouth be renewed, and be ane: of necessitie, thou mann vtter this, in thy conuersatioun: There mann bee agreement betwixt the hart, and the hand: thy conuersation mann be changed with the heart, and be halie, honest and godly, as the heart is: Swa that, gif thy conuersasion be good; it is a sure taken, that thou art at ane with God: but gif thy conuersation be not good; lat men speake quhat they wil, the hart is but defiled: this true and liuely faith, hes na place in it.
Then will thou speare, quhen art thou at ane with God? Quhen thy conuersatioun, thine hart, and thine mouth sayis all ane thing; then na questioun, thou hes the warke of fayth, wrought be the halie Spirit in thy heart, quhilk makes thee to bee at peace with God.
This is the first point, quherein yee suld trie your selfs.
The nixt point is loue; yee mann trie, quhither yee be in loue, and vnder charitie with your neighbour or not: For as thou art not coupled with God, but bee the band of faith: sa thou art not coupled with thy neighbor, nor joyned with na member of Christ in this earth, but be the band of loue, amitie, and charity.
Tak away loue, thou art not a member of this bodie: For loue is the maister sennoun, that couples all thir members of Christs body togither, maks tham to grow vp all in a spirituall and mistical vnitie.
Loue is the onelie marke, quhereby the children of Christ, and members of Christes bodie, are knawen from the rest of the warlde.
Loue is that halie oyle, that refreshes our saules, and makes vs like vnto God: and the mair wee growe in loue, the mair God be his spirit dwels in vs; for God is loue.
Sa that, except in some measure, loue towardes thy neighbour dwell in thy hart, thou can haue na society with thy neighbour, and far lesse with GOD. Gif the manners of men were examined be this rule; wee suld find a multitude of godles people in this Country, quha hes their hearts raging with malice, ilke ane against vthers: and quhere the Deuill, and a malitious spirite dwels; there is na place there for the haly spirit: now suppose the Lord hes gan about, be al means possible, late and air, to instruct thame, and to infound in thame, this precious loue and amitie towardes God and their neighbour, and sa to alter their condition: Yit they will not suffer thame selfis to bee walkned, quhill the great vengeance and malediction of GOD, light on their carcases.
Alwayis this loue, this honest and godly conuersation, flows all fra the root of faith: sa that, gif thy hart haue faith, in any measure; and it were neuer sa small; in that same measure, thou man haue loue towardes thy neighbour: and this loue is neuer idle, but it is euer vttering the selfe; ather in ane effect, or vther: And in respect faith is the ground, quherevpon all the rest dependes, and in respect, that this faith, is sick a jewell, as without the quhilk, it is not possible to onie of you, to please God; without the quhilk, al your doings are abhomination before him; without the quhilk, yee are left in a terrible miserie: quhilk miserie, is sa meekle the mair terrible, that ye are ignorant of it: Is it not good reason, that we knaw and vnderstand, how this fayth is wrought and created in our saules bee the halie Spirite, and howe it is intertayned and nurished in our saules: That seeing how it is created, and hearing tel the maner, how it is brought about; ye may examine your consciences, and see quhither yee bee in the faith or not.
My purpose was to haue insisted langer in this matter, nor this time will suffer.
Nowe therefore, as time will suffer, and as God will giue the grace, sall lat you vnderstand, how the halie Spirite imployes his trauaile, in the heart and mind of man woman; and quhat pains he taks in creating and making vp this jewel of faith in their sauls.
Yit or enter to this wark, to lat you see the trauaills of the spirit of God, in working of this faith in your harts: It is necessare, and mair nor necessare, that yee vnderstand first, your awin miserie and infirmitie: and that ye knaw how the Lorde was induced, to recouer you out of your auld estait, to recreat you, quha were lost be the deede of your ADAM.
Then to take vp the matter the mair highlie, call to your memories this ground: That man vniuersallie, and euery ane particularie beeing corrupted, being lost, and that be his first forebears faulte: (For gif there were na mair but that same first fault and sinne of his, wee are all justlie oblished and bound to ane double death, baith of body and saul for ever.)
Man, this way vniuersally and particularlie, being vtterly lost, without any hope of regres left in his saull, without ony sense of the recouerie of that for mer estaite, or reparing of that image quhilke hee had tint throw sinne lang of before: he being lost be this sinne, and lefte in this desperate estait in him selfe, quhat dois God? The euerliuing God, God, onlye wise; quhais wayes are vnsearchable, hes found out ane waye, how that man this way lost; yit hee may bee saued.
In this turne, he soght counsaill, quhome at? Not at any creature: but he sought counsaill at him self: the persons of the Trinitie, sought counsaill at them selfis: ea God was moued to seeke counsaill at him self, onlie moued in him self: for he had not ane externall principall outwith him self, to induce him.
Swa he seeking this counsell at him selfe, and beeing mooued in him selfe thereto: AS EPHES.
quhat dois hee? Quhen all men and women sulde haue died for euer, it pleasis him of his infinite mercie to select out of all, and to elect a certaine number out of the loste race of ADAM, that suld haue perished for euer.
In this his counsail and decreet, moued say of him self, and seeking counsaill at himself onlie, he selectes a certaine number out of this rotten race: quhilke certaine, he will haue sanctified, he will haue justified, he will haue glorified.
And therefore to bring about the work of their saluation, quhat dois hee? He appointes his awin naturall sonne (for he had but ane naturall sonne,) he appointes the second person of the Trinitie, his awin naturall Son, God in power, glorie, and Majestie, als high as him selfe: aequall with God the Father in all things; he appoints him to work this warke, to bring about this wark of our redemption and aeternal saluation: (this is but the mysterye of it in some measure disclosed.)
And therefore in the fulnes of tyme (for he dispensis all times according to his wisedome,) at sik tyme as he appointed, he maks his sonne to come downe, to sease him selfe in the wemb of the virgin, to take on our flesh, to take on the likenes of sinne, he tooke not on sinne, but he took on the likenes of sinne.
Quhat call that likenes? our flesh is the likenes of sinne: hee took on our flesh and nature, the lyknes of sinne, quhilk wes perfitelie sanctified, in the verie moment of his conception, in the verie wembe of the virgine: Hee tooke on this flesh, that in this flesh and nature, sin might be banisht and dung out of vs for euer.
And quhere we suld all haue gane ea gaite, (for there was na exception of persons be nature;) Christ Iesus our Saueour, hes elected vs: and according as his Father in his secreet election, before the beginning of the worlde, had elected vs: the same Christ Iesus in his awin time hee callis vs, hee makis vs pertakers of that saluation, quhilk he hes purchased: and hee repairis not onlye that Image quhilk was lost in our ADAM, he places vs not in a terrestriall paradise, quhere ADAM was placed at the beginning, (and quhat mair could haue bene sought be vs?) but he giues vs a far mair excellent image, nor we lost: he places vs in a mair high, and in a mair coelestial Paradise nor wee lost.
For, sa meekill the mair heauenlie is the paradise quhilk hee giues vs, as the second ADAM is mair excellent nor the first: and as the Son of God, and God him selfe, gais far aboue any creature that euer was; man, or Angell.
Therefore it comes to pas, that be the benefite of the second ADAM, Christ Iesus our Sauiour, the Sonne of God; quhereas, gif we had remained in that Image quherein our was first created: wee suld haue setled our selfis in the earth for euer, we culd not haue craued a better Paradise, nor ane earthlye Paradise for earthly tabernacles.
Be the benefite of the Sonne of God, saye, it comes to pas, that we are plucked vp out of the earth to the heauen, and to ane heauenly paradise.
And quhat haue we to do with heauen? Are we not made of the earth, to returne to the earth? becoms not ane earthlye paradise, ane earthly body? Yit the Lord in his mercy sendis downe his Sonne, to draw vs vp out of the earth to the heauen: This is sa high a thing, that it cannot be easily co~sidered: For this drawing of vs to ane heauenlie paradise, is a thing mair nor coulde haue beene thought of, that wee suld liue ane Angels life in heauen: how could the hart of man think on this? yit it pleased the leuing Lord in the great riches and bowels of his mercie, and in the exceeding greatnes of the power of his mercie towards vs: (The Apostle in that Epistle to the EPHESIANS, can not get words anew to expresse this; hee knawes not how to begin, nor how to end: quha~ he speakes of the riches of that mercye.
And gif ye look that Epistle to the EPHESIANS narrowlie, ye sall finde maa high, and excellent stiles, giuen to the riches of that mercie, in that Epistle, nor in ony other parte of the scripture.)
It pleased him, say, of his awin mercy, not to giue vs simply the Image quhilk we lost, nor to leaue vs in this earth: but it pleased him to giue vs, a better image: and beside that, to place vs in heauen, to byde with him for euer.
Now, restes his mercy and grace heir? Na: But that this saluation quhilk hee hes alreadye purchased, and brought about, be his Sonne our Sauiour Christ Iesus, that it might bee alwaies accomplished, hauing nathing lacking in it: As he redeemed vs in his awin person perfitlie: Swa, he makes this same redemptioun, to come to our knawledge, and makes vs sure of it in our owne consciences; and to this ende, quhat dois hee praye you? As he be his death purchased our ful redemption: sa he maks it knawin to vs: hee intimates it to vs, bee our inwarde calling: letting vs baith finde and feele in our heart, quhat hee did in his bodie for vs: For our Lord· quhen he maks his seruants to proclaime this redemption, and to intimate it to our consciencis: he workis this jewell of faith in our saulls, quhilk assures vs, that the Sonn of God hes died for vs: For quhat coulde it auaile vs, to see our redemption, to see our saluation and our life a farre of, gif a way wer not founde out, and a hande, a moyan giuen vs, quhereby we may apprehend that saluation, apply it to our self.
Quhat can it avail a sick man, to see a drog in ane Apothicaries booth, except a way be found out, how it sall be applied to his sick bodie: Swa, to the end that this worke of our redemption and saluation, may bee fullie and freely accomplished: Look how freelie hee hes giuen his onely Sonn, to the death of the Cros for vs: als freelie hes he founde out this way moyen, propyned vs with this hand quhereby we may take hald on Christ, apply him to our saulls.
There is not a waye, nor ane instrument in the Scriptures of God, quhereby ony man or woman, may apply Christ to thair saulls, but only the instrument of faith: therefore faith cannot bee aneugh commended.
Turne to faith, and it will make thee to turne to God, and swa conjoine thee with God, and make all thine actions to smell weill in his nease: And there is neuer a good actio~ that we do, suppose it glau~ce neuer sa weill before the warlde, gif it bee not done in faith, but it is abhomination before God, will help foreward to our da~nation: Hauing faith, all the creatures of God mann laugh on vs; they mann all conspire to the furtherance of the worke of our saluation: As be the contrare, lacking faith, there is neuer ane of the creatures of God, but they sall be enemies to vs, and conspire to our damnatioun.
For faith conjoynis vs with the GOD of heauen, and makis vs heauenlye.
This jewell of faith, seasons all the giftes and graces quhilk God giues vs.
will not giue a straw, for all the riches of the earth to my saull, without faith.
And quhat auailes it to ony man, to haue all the sciences, wisedome, and knawledge in the earth, without faith? for the deuil hes all this knawledge; and is not the better.
Quhat auaillis it to me, to conques all the Monarches, Kingdomes, haill riches in the earth? quhat can all thir auaill to my saull? Na thing; but to make out a proces against mee, gif want faith.
Therefore all the benefites and giftes of God, without faith; auailes nathing, but to augment our misery.
All the giftes and graces of God, are abused without faith: Faith onlie makes thee to vse the benefits graces of God rightly: faith onlie suld bee sought, keeped, and interteined heir in this life: hauing faith, all the rest of Gods graces are profitable to thee: for this jewell keeps them all in order, and makes them al fruitful: quhere, lacking this jewell, there is nathing heir in this earth, but it will beare testimonie against thee.
Then let vs come to speake yit of this faith, how it is created in euery ane of your sauls.
quhere our maister sayis: Na man can come to mee, except the Father quhilk hath sent mee, drawe him.
Into the quhilk words, we see cleaerlie, that except we be drawne, except we be compelled, except wee bee rugged, except of vnwilling we be made willing, be God the Father; it is not possible for vs to come to his Sonne.
Quhat is the reason of this, that the spirite of God mann draw vs, and make vs willing or euer we come to God? Becaus be nature, we are not onlie wounded and lanced be sinne and iniquitie; but as the Apostle shawis EPHES.
Yea, farder looke, howe voide any carcase is of a naturall life, als voide ar our sauls (suppose they be liuand the naturall life) als voide are they of the life of God, of that heauenlie and spirituall life, quhereunto we in this life doe aspire: vnto the tyme that the spirit of God draw our harts mindis, that is; quicken our hartes and mindis.
Nay, it is not a draught as wee take it commonlie, it is a verye quickening of a dead thing: It is a quickening of that thing quhilk was voide of the life of the spirite.
Then, except the spirit of God drawe vs, that is, quicken vs with that spirituall heauenlie life: it is not possible to vs to come to heauen.
And ex+cept hee nourish this life, quhilk hee hes begunne, it is not possible that wee can stand in this life.
Swa, the spirit of God is said to drawe vs, that is, to begin this life in vs, and be the same halie Spirit to continue nourish this life in vs.
Now be the draught of the spirit, our sauls ar quickened: and bee the drawing of the spirite, vnderstand na other thing, but the forging and creating of faith in our sauls, quhilk makis vs newe creaturs.
Lat vs see now, quhat order the spirit of God keepis in drawing vs, and in forging and creating this faith in our sauls.
First of al, deuide the saull in na ma parts, nor commonlie it vsis to be deuided: that is, in the hart and in the minde.
Our mind then being ane clud of darknes, altogether blinde naturallie: there beeing nathing in that mind of ours, but vanity error, quherby we vanish away, can neuer bide at na good purpose: quhat dois the spirit of God? The first work that euer the spirit of God dois, he takis order with the mind: and quhat dois he to the mynde? He bannishis darcknes, he chaisses out vanitie and blindnes, that naturally lurkes in the minde: and in stead of this darcknes, he places in the mynde, a light· a coelestiall and a heauenlie light, a light quhilk is resident in Christ Iesus onlie.
Then the spirite chaisses out that clud of miste and darcknes, and places light in the mynde.
And quhat dois hee be this light? Wee getting this inward and heauenlie light in the mind, and ane sanctified vnderstanding; incontinent he makis vs to see God: not onlie, as hee is God the creator of the warld: but alswa, as hee is God the redeemer, and hes redeemed vs in his Son Christ Iesus.
Now before get this light, quhat is my heart and mynde dooing? There is neuer ane of you, but yee haue experience, as my selfe haue, in quhat estait the heart and minde is before this light enter.
The mynde is lyand drowned in blindnes, the hart is hardned, and they baith conspire together in ane vice, to set vp ane Idoll in steed of God: ane domestick inuisible idoll, quhat a sort of idol is that pray you? Na doubt, an warldly or flesh+ly affectio~, ane or vther: this is set vp in the throne of thy hart: And on this idol, thou bestows the seruice of thy hail hart, of thy hail minde, of thy haill saull bodie: Sa, that the seruice, baith of saul and bodie, quhilk suld be bestowed vpo~ God onlie, is imployed vpo~ that idoll, quhilk is set vp in thy hart, that is, in the place of God, in the steede of the maist high God: And thou art mair addicted to the seruice of that idol, nor euer thou wes to the seruice of the liuing God.
Yea, vnto the tyme that this Idol of ours be banished, that this blindnes, quherthrow this idoll is serued, be tane away; there is not ane of you, but ye are seruant to ane lust or vther: thy saul that suld be consecrat to the seruice of the liuing God, it is imployed vpo~ ane affectio~ or vther: vpo~ ane warldly or fleshly lust of thin awin But now, fra time the Lord begin to scatter the cluds of our natural minds vndersta~ding: begin to chase away this thick mist of the dark saull; places therin a sponk of heuenly light, quhilk flowis out of Christ: And quhere we were children of the night and darknes of before, he makes vs to be light in the Lord, and to bee children of the light, and of the day.
Then wee see, that all the things in the warld, beside the liuing God, are vanities, deceaueable allurements, vnconstant shaddowes, fleetand and flowand without ony byding: and then wee see that our hartes and mindes was set on ill continuallie.
Then wee begin to abhor that Idoll, and to seek to serue God onlie.
Now except the Lord of his awin mercy goodnes, place in vs this light, vnto the tyme that we get some glimmering of this light, wee can neuer see our awin vanitie, lat bee to see God.
This then is the first warke of the Spirit, hee bannishes darcknes and errors, and places light in our mindis.
Nowe, this first wark of the Spirite, is termed oftymes in the Scripture, vnder the name of faith: for the minde hes the awin assent perswasion in the awin kynde, als weill as the hart hes: and therefore the mind being illuminat seasoned with this light, the assenting and knawledge in the same minde, is called faith.
The Apostle, and the Euangelists giues to this knawledge, the name of faith: for fra time ains thou haue ane eie to ken God, and quhom he hes sent Christ Iesus, fra ains thou get a sight of him, and gets accesse to him, gif it wer na farder nor in the mind, it is called faith.
But we are forbidden to stand heir, gif faith ga na farder nor the minde, it is not the faith wee are seekand.
For the Faith that justifies, and dois vs good, mann oppin the heart, als weill as it oppinnis the minde: it mann bannish that idol and affection, out of the hart, and in his steed, set down a Throne to Christ Iesus.
Sa that, except the good Spirite of God ga farder, nor rhe mynde; and bannish this idol, als weil out of our harts, as out of our minds, we get not that justifiing faith, quhereby wee may looke for mercie.
Yea, the Spirit of God mann not onlie stand in lightening the minde: but it mann mollifie this hart of thine, and change thine affection: And quhere thy affection was wicked and ill, Gods Spirit mann change the will: and hee neuer can change the will, except he make the ground of thy hart good: that it may be set on God, and bring foorth good frute aboundantlie to the awner.
And quhat teaches this? This teaches you to seeke, for ane honest hart, and to seeke instantly, quhil ye obteene it.
For quhat auails it to ony man to ken quhat is good, or quhat is ill, except he haue a way shawin him, how hee sall eschew the ill, and a moyan giuen him to make him selfe pertaker of the good? Is not this ane idle and vnprofitable knawledge to mee, to see a far off: and to ken, that this is good for mee, quhen as finde not a moyan how to be pertaker of that good, that it may be ane speciall good thing to mee.
Is it not ane idle knawledge also, to ken that this is ill for mee, that it wil do mee ill gif doe it: and yit that same verye thing will do; and na vther? Swa, the Spirit of God linckes thir twa together in this warke: and as he reformes the minde, hee reformes also the heart, and makes you to be pertakers of that good quhilke you see, and to eschewe that ill quhilk yee see.
And this is the second warke of the Spirit, not onlie to present a thing to thee, but to make it thine in effect.
For, howbeit the minde wald do hir turne neuer sa weill, and lat thee see that Christ is thine; and present him to thee, neuer sa oft; gif the hart be not reformed, that wil, and cruked affection that is in thy heart, will prefer it selfe to Christ, and will make thee to compt all but follie, in respect of that Idoll.
And therefore it were ane idle and ane foolish thing for mee to see my saluation, except get grace to be pertaker of it: quhat auailes it to thee to see the Diuel, to see thine awin sins that slayes thee, except thou get grace to eschew tham: sa the second wark of the spirit is this; he enters in the heart, he dantons the hart, wo~derfully cha~ges it, makes the will of it obedie~t; he mollifies the affection, quhilk was hard of before, in sic sort, that it is made to poure out thy affection in some measure on the liuing GOD, quhere it was powred out on ane idoll or vther of thine awin before.
Then except the hart wil do his part, as the mind dois his part; the haill saull is not consecrate to God: for God hes not made the saull, that the heart suld serue thee, and the minde onely suld serue him: but thy seruice is then onelie acceptable to GOD, quhen thou consecrates thy hart, as weill as thy mind to him.
Now this mater is sa cleare, that it misters not to be illustrat be similitude: Yit to make it mair cleare vnto you, we sal lat you see bee a similitude, that the apprehe~sion of the mind is not aneugh, except yee get the apprehension of the heart also.
In corporall things, in meat and drink that serues for the vse of your bodies; there mann bee of this meat and drinke, twa sort of apprehensions; and as there is twa sort of apprehensions, of the meat and drinke, that is the food of the bodie; swa, there is twa sort of apprehensions, of the bodie blood of Christ Iesus, quhilk is our meat and drinke spiritual.
Of meat and drinke corporall, there is ane apprehension bee the eie, and be the taist: that quhil as the meat is present to you on the table, your eie takes a view of this meat, discernes on it, and makes a choyce of it; Yea, not onelie the eie, but also the taist, discernes on that meat, and the taist approouing it; that is called the first apprehension.
Now vpon this, quhilk is the first, the second apprehension followes: that is, efter that ye haue chewed that meat, letten it ouer your halse, and send it to your stomachs, quhere it digests, and conuerts in your nuriture: Then in your stomach, yee get the second apprehension.
But gif swa bee, that your eie like not of that meat, that your taist like not of it nather; the second apprehensioun followes not: for thou wilt spit it out again, or reject it, and prefer an vther thing to it, that thou likes better.
That meat quhilk thou likes not, enters neuer in thy stomach, and sa it can neuer bee conuerted in thy nuriture: For it is onlie the second apprehension of the meat, that is the cause of the nurishment of the body, to our corporall food: Swa that, gif yee chewe not this meat, and lat it ouer; it feeds you not.
Then it is onely the second apprehensioun, that nurishes our bodie.
It is euen siclike in thay spirituall things (sa far as they may bee compared) in the foode of Christ Iesus, quha is the life and nuriture of our saules and consciences: there mann bee twa sorts of apprehensions of Christ Iesus; The first apprehension, is be the eie of the minde, that is, be our knawledge and vnderstanding· for as the eie of the bodie, discerns bee ane outwarde light; sa the eie of thy mind, discerns be ane inward and renewed vnderstanding, quhereby, wee gett the first apprehension of Christ.
Now, gif this first apprehension of Christ, like vs weill, then the nixt followes: wee begin to cast the affectioun of our hearts on him, wee haue good will of him: For all our affections proceeds fra our will, and our affection being renewed and made halie: we set it halely vpon Christ, we loue him; and gif wee loue him, wee take hald on him, we eat him, and digests him; that is, wee apply him to our sauls: and sa of this loue liking of him, the second apprehension dois folow.
But gif sa be, that we haue na will of him, that we haue na loue nor lyking of him; quhat doe we praye you? Then we reject him, and prefers our awin idoll, and the seruice of our awin affecton to him; and swa, the second apprehension follows not: We cannot digest him, and gif wee digest him not that spirituall life cannot grow in vs.
For look in quhat place, the eie serues to thy bodie; in that same roume, serues knawledge and vnderstaunding to thy saule: and looke in quhat place, thy hand and thy mouth, the tast and the stomach, serues to thy body; in that same roume, serues the heart and affection to thy saull: sa that, as our bodie cannot bee nurished, except our hand take, and our mouth eat the meat, wherthrow the second apprehension may follow.
Likewise, our saules cannot feed on Christ, except we gripp him, and imbrace him hartelie be our wil and affection.
For we come not to Christ, bee ony outward motion of our bodie, but be ane inward motioun and apprehension of the heart: for God, finding vs al in a reprobat sense, hee brings vs to Christ, be reforming the affectioun of our saules, bee making vs to loue him.
And therefore, the second apprehension, quhereby we digest our Sauiour, will neuer enter into our saules; except, as he pleases the eie, sa hee please the will and the affection also.
Nowe gif this come to passe, that our wil and affectioun is halelie bent vpon Christ; then na dout, we haue gotten this jewell of faith: haue yee sic a liking in your mind, and sic a loue in your heart of Christ, that ye will preferre him to all thinges in the warlde; Then na questioun, faith is begunne in you.
Now, fra time a thing be begun, there is farther required: for suppose this faith be formed in your mindes, in your harts and saulles, yit that is not aneugh, but that quhilke is formed, man be nurished, and hee quha is conceaued, mann bee intertained and brought vp; or els the loue that is begone in me bee the halie spirit, except be ordinare means, it be daily intertained and nurished, it will decay: except the Lord continue the draught and working of his halie Spirit; it is not possible that can continue in the faith.
And how mann we nurish and continue fayth in our saules? Twa maner of wayis: first, we nurish faith begun in our saul, be hearing of the word: not of euerie word, but bee hearing of the worde of GOD preached: and not bee the hearing of euerie man; but be hearing the word preached be him that is sent.
For this is the ordinair meane, quherevnto the Lorde hes bound him: he will worke faith, be hearing of the word, and perceptioun of the Sacraments: and the mair thou heare the word, the oftner thou receaue the Sacraments; the mair thy faith is nurished.
Nowe it is not onely, bee hearing of the word, and perception of the Sacraments, that we nurish faith.
The word the sacraments, are not able of thame selfis, to nurish this faith in vs, except the working of the halie Spirite, bee conjoyned with their ministerie: But the word and sacraments, ar said to nurish faith in our sauls, because they offer and exhibite Christ to vs, quha is the meat, the drinke, and life of our saules: and in respect, that in the word Sacraments, we get Christ, quha is the foode of our saules; therefore the word and Sacraments, are sayd to nurish our saules: as is set downe Acts
The Disciples of Christ, were earnestlie occupied, and continued in the Apostles doctrine and fellowshippe, and breaking of bread, and praiers: bee thir meanes, intertening, augmenting, and nurishing the faith that was begun in thame.
Then the halie Spirite begets this faith, works this faith, creats this faith, nurishes and intertaines this faith in our saules, be hearing of the preached word, and be participation of the sacraments, quhilk are the ordinair meanes, quhereby, the Lord nurishes vs, and continews this spirituall food with vs: For looke be quhat meanes, the spirituall life is begunne, bee thay same means, it is nurished and intertained.
As this temporall life is intertained and nurished bee thay same meanes, quhereby it is begun.
The~ seing be thir means, the haly spirit begets this work of faith in our sauls: it is our dutie to craue, that he wil continue the wark, quhilk he hes begun: for this cause, we suld resort to the hearing of the word, quhen it is preached, and to the receauing of the sacraments, quhen they ar ministred, that we may be fed in our sauls to life euerlasting.
But alas, we are come to sic a loath, disdain, offcasting of this heauenlie foode in this Countrey: That quhere men in the beginning, wald haue gane, some twentie miles, some fourtie miles, to the hearing of this word: they will scarcelie now come fra their house to the Kirk, and remaine ane hour to heare the word, but bides at hame.
Weil say, ouer great welth, gars wit wauer; and the aboundance of this word, ingenders sik a lothsomnes, that it is a rare thing to find out onye, that hes that thirst and desire to heare the word, as they were wont to haue in the beginning: And as to our great men, they wil not heare it at all: for they cannot heare the thing that accuses thame, and conuicts thame, but because this word accuses conuicts thame, they run fra it.
But they suld not do swa; they suld not run fra Christ, nor fra his worde that accuses tham: but they suld hear the worde, and as the worde accuses thame, they suld accuse tham selfs also that therby, they may come to a confessioun of their sin, obtaine mercie for the same.
Sa, quhen Christ accuses thee, thou suld not run fra him, but thou suld draw neer to him, thou suld threepe kindnes of him and make irruption, as it were, and forciblie enter in his kingdome.
It is not the way, quhen thy sinne twitches thee, and quhe~ Christ accuses thee, to run fra him: Na, thou suld then turn to him; thou suld confes thy sin, cry Peccaui, seek mercy: and efter that thou hes gotte~ mercy, this word sal become als pleasant to thee, and thou sall take als great delite, to come to the hearing of it; as euer thou delited to fly fra it before.
But alas, our lothsomnes and disdaine, is grown to sick ane height; that truly, am moued to beleeue firmly, that the Lord hes concluded, that wee sal not enter in his rest; and that only, for the great contempt of his mercy and grace, quhilk is now sa richly offered: For why? God cannot deal vtherwayis with vs, nor he dealt with our for fathers the Israelits, for the negligence of the euangel, quhilk was but then obscurely preached: for the~, it was farre fra the incarnation of Christ; and the farther that it was fra his incarnation, the Euangell was ay the mair obscurely preached, vnder darke types and shadows; Yit notwithsta~ding, the fathers that hard that euangel preached, and beleeued it not; they perished all in the wildernes, except twa, as ye haue hard sometime fra this place: And gif they, for the contempt of sa darke ane light perished: Meeklemair mann ye, that are their children perish, for the contempt of the Son of righteousnes, quha is risen sa plainlie, shines sa clearlie now, in the preaching of the gospel: except the Lord in his mer+cy preuent you, and except yee preuent his judgment be earnest seeking, and except ye seeke a feeling, seek inward senses, that ye may see feele the grace that is offered.
Craue againe, that he wil sanctifie your hearts be repentance, that yee may repent you of your sinnes, and take vp ane honest, and ane godly conuersation in all that baith body and saull may bee saued in the day of the Lord.
The Lord worke this in your sauls, that ye may seeke mercie, seeking mercie, ye may get mercy: and in mercie, yee may get a grip of Christ, and that for his righteous merites: To quhome with the Father and the halie Spirit, be all honor, praise and glorie, for now and euer.
THE FIFT AND LAST SERMON, VPPON THE PREparation to the Lords Supper, preached the
Let euery man therefore examine him self, and sa let him eate of that breade, and drinke of that cup. &c.
INTO the Doctrine of our triall and due examination; the Apostle, as yee heard, (weilbeloued in Christ Iesus) hee gaue vs a speciall command, that euery ane of vs, suld trye and examine narrowlie our selfis; that is, that euery man suld condiscend, and enter into his awn conscience, try and examin the estait of his awin conscience; in quhat estait hee findes it with God, and in quhat estate he finds it with his neighbour: hee inioynes this tryal to our selfes, and commands that euery ane of vs, suld take paines vpon the true examination of our consciences; hee injoyns this warke to vs, quhy? Be reason na man knawes sa meekle of me as do my selfe; be reson, na man can be sure of the estait of my conscience, but my selfe; be reason na man can sa diligentlie, nor sa profitably try my conscience, as my selfe: therfore chiefly it becomes every man, and woman, or ever they enter to the hearing of the worde, or giue eare to the worde, or their mouth to the Sacrament: It becomes thame to trye and examin their awin consciences.
Not that the Apostle walde seclude the tryal of vther men: for as it is leasume to me to try my selfe, sa na doubt it is leasume to my Pastour to try me: It is leasume to vther men that hes a care ouer mee, to try and examine me: but na man can do this, sa profitably to me, as my selfe: and suppose we had neuer sa mony examiners, and triers, all is lost, gif we try not our selfs: Swa, quhither there be a second or a third trier: let our selfe be the first, and let our selfe be ane: And na dout the Apostles mind hes bene this to let vs see clearlie, that he or she that comes to that table, and hes not that knawledge, nor is not of that ability to try thame selfes, are prophane commers, comes vncleanly as dogs, and therfore man come to their awn destruction.
Let euery man therefore grow in knaweledge, growe in vnderstanding, growe in the Spirite, that hee may bee the mair able to trie and examine his awin conscience.
To the end that ye might ga fordward, and proceede in the worke of this triall with the better speede, and with the better fruits: Into this examination we laid downe this ordour.
First of all, wee lute you see, quhat is that, quhilk wee call a conscience, and quhat is meaned therby: Nixt, we lute you see for quhat causes ye suld put your consciences to this trial and narrow examination: thirdlie, sa far as time suffered, we entered into the points, quhereinto euery ane of you suld try and examine your awin consciences.
As to conscience, that yee may call that difinitioun to your memorie; will resume it shortlie.
Wee call a conscience, a certaine feeling in the heart, resembling the righteous judgement of God, following vppon a deed done be vs, flowing of knawledge in the minde: feeling accompanied with a motioun in the heart, a motioun, ather of feare or ioy, of trembling or rejoysing.
leaue the opening vpp of thir pairts to your memories; and pray God, that they may be weill sanctified.
come nixt to the causes, quherefore euerie ane of you, suld bee carefull in trying and examining your awin consciences.
The first cause is; because the Lorde of heauen, hes his eie continuallie vpon the conscience; the eie of God, comes neuer off the conscience and heart of man; as prooued to you, be sundrie places.
Nixt, be reason this God hes chosen his ludgeing, and hes sett downe his throne, to make his residence in the conscience: Therefore, that hee may dwell in cleanenesse, you aught to haue a regard to his dwelling place.
Thirdlie, hee is the Lord: Yea, the onelie Lorde of thy conscience, quha hes power onely to controle; quha onelie hes power to saue, or to tine: therfore, that it may doe good seruice to thy awn Lord, thou aught to take tent to thy conscience.
And last of all, in respect, that the health of thy saull, stands in the estait of thy conscience; and gif thy saull bee in good health, thy bodie cannot be euill: Therefore in respect, that saull and bodie, dependes vppon the estait of the conscience; euerie ane of you, suld carefullie looke to your consciences.
will not amplifie this, but remits the matter to your memories: howe the health of the saull, and weilfair of the saull, suld be keeped.
Nixt, come in the thrid and last rowme, to the points, into the quhilk euerie ane of you, suld try and examine your consciences: And as ye remember, set down twa points, quhere into it behoues you to put your consciences to triall.
First, to knaw quhether your consciences wes at peace with God, or not: secondlie, quhether your consciences wes in loue, in charitie, in amitie with your neighbour, or not: Into thir twa points chieflie, yee mann try and examine your selfis.
To ken quhether yee bee at peace with God or not, ye mann first try, quhether ye be in the faith, or not: (as the Apostle speakes) quhether yee bee in the faith of Christ or not: For, being in the faith, and justified thereby; of force yee mann haue peace with God, as the Apostle speakes.
Then the nixt cair mann be to try your faith, and to see quhether ye haue faith, or not.
Faith can na waies be tryed, but be the fruits: faith can not be judged on be mee, that lookes on it at the least, but be the effects: Therefore to try quhether yee be in the faith, or not: take tent to the frutes: take tent to thy mouth, take tent to thy hand, take tent to thy wordes, and to thy deedes.
For, except thou glorifie God in thy mouth, and confes to thy saluation: and except thou glorifie him also in thy deedes, and make thine haly life to testify of thy haly faith, all is but vaine, all is but meer hypocrisie.
Therefore to knaw the synceritie of thy faith, thou mann take tent, that there be ane harmony betwixt thy hand, thy mouth, and thy hart: that there bee a mutuall consent, that thy doings prejudge not thy hart, that thy mouth prejudge not thy hart: but that mouth and hand, may testifie of the synceritie of the heart.
Gif the heart, the hand, and the mouth, consent and agree in ane harmonie together: Na question, that hart that breakes foorth in sa good frutes, is coupled with God: there is na question, the light of thy actions, the beames and shyning of thy life, sall make the name of thy good God to bee glorified.
Therefore the haill weight of our tryall stands chieflie vpon this point: to see quhether wee bee in the faith, or not: to examine quhether Christ dwels in vs bee faith, or not: For without faith, there can bee na coupling, nor conjoining betwixt vs and Christ: without faith our hart can not be sanctified and clenged: and without faith we can not worke bee charitie: sa all depends on this onlie.
And therefore that ye might the better vndersta~d quhether ye haue faith or not: gaid somequhat mair highly in this matter, and begoud to lat you see, how the haly Spirit creats faith, workes faith in your sauls, harts, and mindes.
begouth to let you see, quhat order the halye Spirite keeped, in forming and in creating this notable instrument in your harts and mindes: Not only how he ingenders and begins faith, but alswa how he interteinis it, how hee nourishes it: and we lute you see, the externall meanes and instrumentes quhilk he vsis to this effect.
To beget faith in our sauls, the halie Spirit vses the hearing of the worde preached, bee him that is sent; the ministerie of the Sacraments, as ordinarie meanes and instrumentes: quhilk ordinare meanes are onelie then effectual, quhe~ as the haly Spirit concurs inwardly in our hearts, with the worde striking outwardlie in our eare: and with the Sacrament outwardlie receaued.
And except the haly Spirit grant his concurrance to the word, and to the Sacrament; word and Sacrament wil not work faith.
Swa, all depends vpon the working of this haly Spirit.
The haill regeneration of mankinde, the renewing of the hart and of the conscience, depends on the power of the haly Spirit: and ther fore it becoms vs cairfully, to imploy our trauails, in incalling for his haly Spirit.
Be the same means and na vther, that the halie Spirite begets faith in vs; bee the same meanes he nourishis and augments that, quhilk he hes begotten.
And therfore, as wee get faith bee hearing of the word; sa be continuall and diligent hearing, we haue this faith augmented, and nourished in vs.
And heir drew out my exhortation, that gif ye wauld haue that spirituall life nourished in you, and gif ye wald haue a farder assurance of heauen: on force ye mann baith continuallie and diligentlie, heare the blessed worde of God.
Now it rests that euery ane of you cairfullie applye this doctrine to your awin saulls, and enter into the tryall of your awin consciences: to see, gif this faith, as spake, bee begunne in your hearts and minds, or not: How far, or how little the halie Spirit hes proceeded in that wark, try with mee, and with you.
The first effect of the haly Spirite, quhereby yee may try your minde, quhether it bee in the faith, or not; is this: Reuolue in your memories, and remember, gif at ony time, it pleased the Lord in his mercie to turne the darcknes of your minde vnto light, to make that darcknes quhilk wes within you to depart.
Be the quhilk dark+nes, nather had yee ane eie to see your selfis, quhat yee war bee nature: nor yet had yee ane eie to see God in Christ, nor ony part of his mercie.
Examine saye, quhether gif this darcknes of the naturall vnderstanding, be turned into light, be the working of the Spirit, or not: Gif thou art become a childe of the light, a childe of the day: Gif thou art become as the Apostle speakes, light in the Lord: Gif there be this alteration maid in thy minde, that quhere naturallye off before, it was closed vp in darcknes; quhere it was filled with vanities and errours; quhere it was closed vp in blindnes: gif the Lorde hes at onye time, enlightened the eie of thy minde, and maide thee to see thine awin miserie, to see the vgglines of thin awin nature: to see they hainous sinnes, in the quhilk be nature thou lyes: Gif he hes granted to thee, ane insight of thy self in some measure: and vpon the vther side, gif hee hes graunted thee ane and hes giuen thee ane insight of the mercie of God in Christ Iesus: gif thou haue gotten ane insight of the riches of his grace in Christ: Na doubt, the halie Spirit hes begun a good warke in thee: wark, quhilk will bring foorth repentance, quhilk in his awin time hee will perfite.
Sa this is the first cair that ye aught to haue, and the first point quherin ye aught to examine your mindes: to see gif there be any light in it, quhereby ye may knaw your misery, and haue a insight of the mercy of God in Christ.
This being doone, that thou findes a sight of thir twa in thy minde; fra thy minde, ga to the heart, and as thou hes tryed thy minde, sa try thine hart.
And first examine the hart, gif it bee altered or not: gif it be in ony sort reformed or not, that the will of it bee framed and bowed to Gods obedience: that the affectioun bee turned in the luif of God, and bee powred out on him, as it wes powred out on vanities, on filthines, and on the warlde off before.
Try quhither the ground of the hart, and the fountaine quherfra the motions and affections proceeds; be sanctified, or not: For of ane haly fountaine, halie waters mann distill: of ane halye fountaine, halie motions, halie cogitations, and sanctified considerations mann flow.
Try then and examine your heart, gif the spirit of God hes wrought ony sik reformation (as spake off) in the hart or not: And that thou may take vp the working of the halie Spirit, the better in thy hart and conscience, quhilk makis chieflie residence in the hart: sall lay before thee the first effect, that euer the halye Spirite brings foorth in thy hart: in framing it, in mollifying it, and in bowing it to the obedience of God.
Thou sall knaw the working of the haly Spirit, bee this effect: to wit, gif, as thy minde seeis, and behaldes quhat is ill, seeis and behaldes quhat is good, seeis and behaldes thine awin miserie, and thy sinnes that hes casten thee in this miserie: and seeis and behalds the riches of the mercie of God in Christ: Gif as thy mind seeis thir twa, thy hart be reformed and prepared, to loue the sight of thame.
As thou seeis in thy mind, the mercie of God, that in Christ: gif thou hes ane hart to desire mercie: gif thou hes ane thirst and earnest desire, to bee pertaker of mercie: quhere this desire and thirst is, there the halie Spirit is, he hes, na doubt, opened the hart.
Vpon the vther side, becaus, as thou seeis mercie, thou seeis thy miserie: gif as thy minde seeis the miserie, seeis the fountain quherefra thy misery flows a to wit, fra thine awin sins, gif then thyne heart also hates this; the halie Spirite is there.
Gif as thou seest sinne, quhilk is the cause of thy miserie, with the eye quhilk is giuen thee in thy minde; thou hatest this sinne with thy heart: na question, the halie Spirite is there.
And as thou hatest it, gif also thou sorrow for it, (for it is not aneugh to hate it, gif thou lament not the committing of it, with a godlie sorrowe deplore it:) the halie Spirite is there.
And thirdlie, gif with thy lamenting, thou haue a care and a studie to eschew that sinne; for quhat auailes it to lament; gif like a dogg, returning to his vomit· thou fall in that same golfe againe.
Therefore, quhere there is ane hatrent of sinne, a sorrowe for sinne, a care and a studie to eschewe sinne: na questioun, the halie Spirite hes opened the heart, and is working out that precious instrument.
Take vpp all this in a worde, take vp all the operation of the haly Spirite, and working in the heart in a word· and bee this examine thy heart.
See and perceaue, gif the halie Spirite hes entred sa farre with thee, to worke in that hard heart of thine, an ernest, a diligent study, a carefull solicitude, continually to be reconciled with the gret god, quhom thou hes offended: Is there sick a thing, as ane thirst and ane desire to be at amitie with him, quhom thou hes offended, to be reconciled with the God of heauen, quhom thou hes offended be thy manifald transgressions: quhere this care, and study of reconciliation is: Gif this care study of reconciliation be in the heart; there is na dout, but the hart that thirsts for this reconciliation is hartelie content, not onlie to renounce sin, to renounce al the impieties, that seucred thee fra God: but the hart that is indewed with this thirst, will bee hartely content, to renounce it selfe, to cast downe it selfe, for als stubborne as it wes off before, to caste down the self at the feete of the mightye GOD, and bee healilie content, in all times comming, to be ruled be his halie will: Not to followe the awin lust, the awin will and appetite, as it did off before; but to resigne the self healilie in the handes of the mightie God, to bee ruled be his wil at his pleasure, and to obey his appetite.
And except ye find this dispositioun in your awin heart, to quite your selfis, to renounce your selfis; it is a vaine thing, to you to speake, that yee haue a thirst to bee reconciled.
And the mair that this study grow is, the greater that the apprehension of my miserie, of the deep gulfis very hels (quherunto my saull is subiect) growes in my saull, the mair earnest wald be to be reconciled: to be reconciled, wald not stand, for the renuncing of the lusts of my hart; but wald renou~ce my hart, the obedience of the wil appetit of it· Quhy? becaus see, mann die for euer, except the Lorde reconcile him self with mee.
see the huge deepes oceans of all misery, in the quhilk sal fal in the end, except in mercie, the Lord reconceile him self with mee.
To eschew thir deepes and inconueniences, is there ony question, but the hart that hath a sense, and is touched with thame; wil maist willingly quite the self.
Againe, seing the Lorde hes tane paines to deliuer mee out of that deepe misery, in the quhilk drowned my self, and hes purchased my redemption bee sick a coastlie price: not with golde, nor with siluer, or ony draffe in the earth: but be sick a wonderful way, be sick a pre+tious price, and rich ransome: Looking to the greatnes of our misery, and to the greatnes of the price, quhereby hee hes redeemed vs: quhat hart is it, but it willinglie walde renunce the selfe, to get a part of that redemption, and to be deliuered out of that hell, quherein wee are presentlie, and quherein wee will be in a greater measure ester this, except we be reconciled.
Swa then, with this chose, there is joined a disposition in the heart, quherby the hart is willing in some measure, to renunce the selfe.
This lesson is oft tauld ouer to vs bee Christ, in his Euangell: We mann ather take vp a crosse and renounce our selfis also, or wee cannot follow him.
The mair that this thirst growes in the heart, the mair this renouncing of our selfis growes: the mair that this thirst decayes, and is diminished in the heart, the mair cleaue wee to the warld, the mair cleaue we to the flesh, and the mair are we ruled and guided be thame.
Sa, ather mann wee nourishe a thirst of righteousnes, a hunger of life euerlasting, a thirst of mercie, a hunger of that justice that is in Christ; or it is not possible that in any measure, we can bee disciples to him.
Now ga fordward: The heart that efter this sorte is prepared, that with a thirst to be reconciled, is disposed also to renounce the self: this heart into the quhilk there lyes sa earnest a thirst, is neuer frustrat of the expectation: that gree die heart is neuer disapointed: but as the Lorde hes imprented in it, ane earnest studie to bee reconciled, and to get a grip of Christ: Sa in his mercy he grants vnto that hart the possession of mercie, hee puts that heart in some measure, in possessioun of the mercye quhilke it seekes, in possessioun of Christ Iesus him self, quhom it seekes.
The quhilk apprehensioun of Christ, the heart sensiblye feels and gripes, in that peace, quhilk he giues to the conscience: sa that the conscience quhilk wes terrified, exceedinglie gnawen, and distracted off before; be the incomming of this peace, and of Christ with his graces; incontinent it is quieted pacified: there comes a calmnes and soundnes in the heart, and all troubles and stormis are remoued.
With this peace is conjoined, ane taist of the powers of the warld to come.
The heart gets a taist of the swetnes that is in christ of the joy, whilk is in the life euerlasting, quhilk taist is the only of that full and perfite joy, quhilk saull and bodie in that life shall enioy.
And the arlispennie (as yee knaw) mann be a part of the sowme, and of the nature of the rest of the sowme.
And therefore, that arlispenie of joy assures vs, that quhen wee sall get possession of the haill sowme, it sall bee a strange joy.
And thir documents halds vp the heart, and makes it not to linger, nor wearie in the expectation of that life: but being refreshed now and then therewith, be sa mony arlis pe~nies: they assure vs of the full fruition of that joy, for the quhilk in patience wee will sustein all troubles.
Swa, as the halie Spirite workes a thirst in vs, to be at Christ, a thirst of mercy and reconciliation with him: the same halie Spirit disapoints not that same expectatioun, nor thirst; but puts the saull and hart in possession of Christ: bee the quhilk the conscience is pacified, the heart is rejoiced, and we get a taist of the sweetnes, and of the powers of that life to come.
The sensible feeling of the quhilk taist, that passes all natural vnderstanding, quhat dois it in my hart and conscience? It workes a wonderfull assurance and perswasioun that God loues mee.
The feeling of his mercie in the bowels of my heart, in the bottome of my conscience, works a certain assurance and perswasion, that he is my God, that he will saue me for Christs cause; that the promise of mercy, quhilk durst not for my life applye to my conscience off before; now bee the feeling of mercie, dare baldly apply, and say: mercie apperteins to mee, life and saluation apperteins to mee.
For the conscience being exceedingly terrified, and seeing na thing in God but fire and wraith: it is not possible, but it mann flee fra him: it can not approch to ane consuming fire: but fra time the con+science get a taist of this peace, mercy, sweetnes; Looke how first it fled fra him off before: now efter this reconciliation it will runne als fast to him, and wil posses him, mair and mair, fullie.
Sa the assurance and perswasion of mercie, ryses of the feeling of mercie in the heart and conscience.
And except the hart feele it, and taste it in some measure: dare not, nor na conscie~ce dare for the life, apply God and his mercie to the self.
may be sure in generall, that all my sinnes are remissable, and that may come be mercie, or feele it: but to apply this mercie in particular to my selfe, quhill feele a taist of it first, dar not.
Swa, this particular application, quhereby we claime God, and Christ as propertie to vs, as gif na man had title to him but wee, and to call him my God, my Christ, and to claime his promises, as na man had entres to them but wee: this comes of the sense and feeling of mercie in the heart: And the mair that this feeling growes, the farder experience, that wee haue in our awin hart of this peace and mercie, the greater growes our faith and assurance: Our perswasion becoms sa strong, that we dar at last come out with the Apostle and say: Quhat can twin mee fra the luif of God? Nather death, nather life, nather Angels, nor principalities nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, is able to seperate mee fra the loue of God, quhilk is in Christ.
This particular application, quhilk ryses (na doubt) vpon the feeling and sens of mercie, is the specifik difference, the cheef mark and proper note, quhereby our faith, quha ar justified in the blood of Christ, is discerned fra that generall faith of the Papistes.
Our faith bee this particular application, is not onlye disscerned fra the generall faith of the Papistes, but it is discerned fra all the pretended faithes, of all the sectes in the warld.
For the Papist dare not applye the promis of mercy to his awin saul, he compts it presumptio~ to say, am ane elect, am saued and justified.
And quherfra flowes this pray you? Only fra this, that in their conscience, they haue neuer felt mercie, they haue neuer tasted of the luif, fauour, and sweetnes of God: For, looke how fast the conscience fleeis fra God, before it get the taiste of his sweetnes: It runnes als diligentlie on him, threapes luife on him, efter that it hes gotten that taist.
Swa, they miserable bodies contents thame with this generall faith, quhilk is na vther thing, bot ane historicall faith, that leanes only on the treuth of God, quherby knaw that the promises of God are true: Bot the Papist dare not come, and say: they are true in mee; quhy? becaus hee hes not felt it, and the hart of him is not opned.
But our justifieng faith, as tauld you, consecrates the haill saul, to the obedience of God in Christ.
Sa that it rests not only vpon the truth of God, nor it rests not only vpon the power of God: suppose thir be twa chiefe pillars of our faith alswa: but speciallie and chieflie, it rests vpon the mercie of God in Christ: it rests also vpon the truth and power of God, but speciallie vpon the promise of grace and mercie in Christ.
The saull of the Papist, being destitute of the feeling and taist of mercie, dare not enter in this particular application, and swa hee can not be justified.
Yea: na doubt, sa mony of them as are justified, in the mercy of God gets a taist of his mercie, and kindnes, or thay die.
Then ye haue onely this to remember, the opening of the heart, the pacifiyng, quieting of the conscience; they worke ane assurance and a strong perswasion of the mercie of God in Christ: The mair that the heart bee opened, the mair that the conscience be pacified, the mair that the taist of that sweetnes continue and remaine, the mair art thou assured of his mercie.
Swa then, wald thou knaw, quhither thy faith be strong or not, quhither thy perswasion of Gods mercie, be starke or not? Take tent to thy conscience; gif thy conscience bee hurt, assuredly thou will doubt; and gif thou doubt, thou can not haue sicke a strong perswasioun, as vtherwayis thou wald haue, gif thy doubting were away.
Not that wil haue faith to be sa perfit in this life, that there be alwaies na doubting joined with it.
clame not to that perfection: but say that ane hurt conscience mann ever doubt, and the mair wee dout, the les is our perswasion: Swa the mair thou hurt thy conscience, the lesse faith thou hes.
Then thou mann come to this point: Keepe mee a sound conscience; intertaine peace in thy conscience, and thou sall keepe faith, and sal haue thy perswasion in that same measure, that thou hes of rest and peace in thy conscience: the mair that thy conscience bee at peace and rest, the greater sall thy faith and perswasioun be.
Sa this ground halds fast, ane doubting conscience, makes a weake faith; and the mair the doubting in the conscience bee, the weaker is the faith.
Then the Apostle lies not; quha says, that faith dwels in a good conscience, that faith is locked and closed vpp in a good conscience: Sa that gif yee keepe a good conscience, ye sal keepe a strong faith; and gif yee hurt your conscience, yee sall hurt your faith.
Nowe to make this mair sensible: How cann bee perswaded of his mercie, quhais anger feel kendled against me, against whom my conscience shewes me to bee giltie of manie offences.
Na question, sa lang as the sense of his anger, and feeling of my offences bides; cannot haue a starke perswasion, that he will be mercifull to me: but quhen gett accesse to his countenance, and ane sight that hee hes forgiuen me; then begin to be perswaded.
Sa keepe a good conscience, and thou sall keepe faith; and the better that thy conscience be, the starker mann thy faith be.
Then the hail exhortation that we gather on this point, dependes vpon this: That euerie ane of you, in quhat rancke sa euer yee bee; take tent to your conscience: for loosing it, ye loose faith; and losing faith, yee loose saluation.
Bee yee in the ranke of great men, yee aught to tak tent to your consciences: Speciallie, in respect, that the Lord hes placed you in ane great calling: Yee haue mony thinges, quherein, ye aught to controle your consciences.
Yee aught to craue the aduise of your co~science, or euer ye put your hand to onie warke: In respect yee are bound in manifauld duties to God, and to your inferiours: And na doubt, gif some of our great men had aduised weill, these dissolutions had not fallen out into their awn bodies.
Thir oppressions of the poore, thir deadlie feids, with their awin companions, walde not burst out in sick ane heigh measure, gif they had aduised weil with their consciences.
But the Lorde, seeing thame take sa little tent to their consciences, hee spoyles thame of fayth, and of the hope of mercie: and out of question, yee fall see their end miserable; Yee sall see thame spectacles of the judgements of God: they that hes eies to behauld it, sall see the God of heauen, make thir men, quha gais sa dissolutly to wark, spectacles of his judgeme~ts to the warld: For the Lord leaues not sic men vnpunished.
Be theyr example, it were verie necessare, that men of inferiour rancks suld take tent to their consciences: and therefore, let euerie man, according to his calling, examine his calling, bee the rule of his conscience.
And speciallie, this becoms you that are judges; It becoms you, before ye pronounce, and gif forth judgment, to aduise with your conscience and law thereof, and in judgement, not to folow your affection, but to follow the rule of your conscience.
Likewayis, yee that are of inferiour ranks to Iudges, and yee that are aduocats, controlle your doings be your conscience, and giue not the leages nor subjects of this Countrey, just cause to complaine on you: terrifie tham not, fra the pleading of justice be exorbitant prices, and extraordinair kind of doing: but moderate al your actions sa, that they agree with the rule of your consciences; that sa farre as in you lies, justice cease not.
This that speake to thame, speake to you of the Merchand estait also: See that yee looke not sa meekle, to this or that, as to the conscience that is in you; quhat in conscience yee may doe, according to the measure of knawledge, that God hes placed in you: and quhatever yee doe; beware, yee doe not against your knawledge.
graunt your knaweledge will not bee sa learned, as it suld be and this makes mony deformed actions; Yit lat not a man doe against his knaweledge: but let euerie man doe according to the measure of knawledge, quherwith God hes indued him: And suppose it be not weil reformed, yit or thou do be ges, be aduised with thy conscience, and followe thy knawledge: For that quhilk is done doubtinglie, is sinne.
Swa, quhateuer thou doe; let not thy eie, thy hand, nor ony member of thy bodie, do against thy knawledge: For this is a step to that heigh sinne against the halie Spirit.
This is the readie way, to put all knawledge out of your mind.
For gif me~ do against knawledge, continue in doing against knawledge: at last, they will become a masse of darknesse, the Lorde will scrape all knawledge out of their minde, and all feeling of mercie out of their heart, giff they feele it not better: Therefore, euery ane of you, follow your knawledge, and according to the measure of your knawledge, let your actions proceed.
It hes pleased the Lorde, to poure this liquour, this precious ointment in vs; sup+pose we be earthly and lame vessels, miserable creatures; yit it hes pleased our gratious God, to poure sic a precious liquor in our hearts and minds, and to concredite sick ane jewell in our hands and keeping, that bee the vertue of this liquour, we may tak hauld on Christ, quha is our justice, our wisedoome, sanctificatioun, and redemption.
Suppose we be miserable creatures, yit the Lord of his mercie, hes a respect to vs in Christ, in giuing vs this precious liquour, quherby our sauls may bee seasoned to life euerlasting.
In this, that he powres it in our hearts, we see clearelie, that it growes not in our hearts, nor breeds not in our nature.
Na, this gift of faith, is not at mans co~mand, nor vnder his arbitrament: as gif it lay in his hand to beleeue, or not to beleeue, as he pleases.
It is the gift of GOD, poured downe freelie of his vndeserued grace, in the riches of his mercie in Christ.
quhere the Apostle sayis; and to an vther is giuen faith bee the same spirit: as also, PHIL.
quhere hee sayis: For vnto you it is giuen for Christs cause, that not onelie yee suld beleeue in him, but also suffer for his sake.
Sa faith is the gift of the halie Spirit: and this gift is not giuen to all men and women, as the Apostle plainelie declares: All hes not faith.
This gift, suppose it be giuen, it is not giuen to all, but is onely giuen to the elect, that is, to sa mony as the Lord hes appointed to life euerlasting.
This gift, quhere euer it is, and in quhat heart soeuer it bee, it is neuer idle, but perpetuallie working, and working weil by loue and charitie, as the Apostle sayth.
This gift, quher euer it bee, is not dead, but quicke and liuelie, as the Apostle IAMES saith, in his second Chapter.
And to let you knawe, quhither it be liuely and working or not, there is not a waye, but to looke to the fruits and effects that flowes fra it: And therefore that yee, be your awin effectes, may be the mair assured of the goodnes of your faith: will giue you three speciall effects to looke on, be the quhilk ye may judge vppon the goodnesse of your faith.
First of all, looke to thy heart, and cast thine eie on it: Gif thou hes a desire to pray, a desire to craue mercy for thy sinnes, to incall vpon Gods halie name for mercie and grace: gif there be sick a thing in thy heart, as ane desire to praie, gif there be ony peece of thine heart inclined, and hes a thirst to seek efter mercie and grace: suppose the greatest part of thy heart repine, and wald draw thee fra prayer: yit assuredlie that desire that thou hes in ony measure to prayer, is the true effect of the right faith.
Gif thou haue a hart to pray to God, suppose this desire be but sclender, assure thy self thy saull hes life: for prayer is the life of the saull, and maks the faith liuelie; for why? Praier is Gods awin gift; it is not our gift, for gif it were ours, it wald be euill.
But it is the best gift that ever God gaue man, and sa it mann be the gift of his awin haly Spirit; and being his awin gift, it mann make our faith liuelie.
Beside this, thou art not able, nor thou dare not call vpon him, in quhom thou beleeues not, as the Apostle saith.
For gif intreat him be praier, mann trust in him.
Then praier is a certaine argument of iustifying faith and beleife in GOD: For cannot speake to him; let bee to pray to him, in quhome trust not: And suppose the heart be not fullie resolued, and weill disposed; yit gif there be ony part of the heart that inclines to praier, sticke bee it; it is a sure gadge, that that part beleues.
The second effect, wherby thou sal knaw, quhither faith bee in thee or not, is this; looke and aduise with thy selfe, gif thy heart cann bee content, to renounce thy rankour, to forgiue thy grudges, and that freelie for Gods cause: may this be done be thee? and will thou forgiue thy neighbour, as freely as God hes forgiuen thee? assuredlie, that is the effect of the right Spirit; for nature could neuer giue that.
There is nathing, quherevnto nature bends the selfe mair, nor to rankour and enuie; and there is nathing, quherein nature places her honor mair guckedly, nor in priuie reuengement.
Now gif thy hart bee sa tamed and brought downe, that it wil willinglie forgiue the injurie for gods cause; that is the effect of the right Spirite: This is not my saying; it is Christs saying, MAT.
quhere hee saith: gif yee do forgiue men their trespasses, your heauenlie father wil also forgiue you; and
verse: but gif yee do not forgiue men their trespasses, na mair wil your heauenlie Father forgiue you your trespasses.
Sa wald Christ say; he that forgiues wrangs, sall get wrangs forgiuen him; but he that wil reuenge his wrangs, wrang sal be reuenged vppon him.
Therefore, as thou wald bee spared in thy wrangs, doone to the mightie God; spare thou thy neighbour.
will not insist; examine quhither ye haue faith or not; examine it be prayer, examine it bee the discharge of your awin priuie grudges; for gif yee want thir effects: Ane heart full of rankour, an hart voyd of praier, is ane heart faithlesse, and meet for hell.
The third effect of faith is compassion; thou mann bowe thy heart, and extend thy pitie, vpon the pure mem+bers of Christs bodie, and suffer thame not to lacke gif thou haue: for except yee haue this compassioun, yee haue na faith.
Examine your selfs bee thir three effects, and gif yee finde thir in onie measure; how beeit, it were neuer sa small· you haue the right faith in your hart, the faith that you haue, is true and liuelie, and assuredly God will be mercifull to you.
This faith of ours, suppose it be liuely, yit it is not perfect in this warld, but euerie day, and euery houre, it craues a continuall augmentatioun, it craues euer to be nurished: for the quhilk increase, the Apostles thame selfis, LVK.
And our maister commaunds vs to pray, and say, Lorde increase our faith, beleeue, Lorde helpe my vnbeliefe.
Then Christs commaund lats vs see clearely, that this faith, misters continually to bee nurished and helped, and it cannot be helped, but be praier: sa we suld alwayis continue in praier.
That this faith suld be helped, and that wee suld bee perpetuallie vppon our garde, in feare and trembling to gett it augmented: the terrible doubtings, the wonderful pits of desparatioun, into the quhilk, the dearest seruaunts of God are casten, dois clearelie teach: For the best seruants of God, are exercised with terrible doubtings in their saules, with wonderfull stammerings, and they will bee brought at somtimes, as appears in their awin judgement, to the verie brinke of desperatioun.
Thir doubtings and stammerings lets vs see, that this faith of ours wald bee perpetuallie nurished, and that wee haue neede, continuallie to pray for the increase of it.
It pleases the Lorde, at somtimes, to let his seruants haue a sight of thame selfes, to cast thame downe, and to let thame see, how ouglie sinne is: It pleases him, to let thame fall in the bitternesse of sinne, and to quhat end? Not that he wil deuour thame, or suffer tham to be swallowed vp be desperation.
Suppose EZEKIAH cries out, that like an hungrie lyon, the Lord is like to deuour him, bruise him in peces: yit the Lord suffers him not to dispair.
And suppose DAVID cry, cannot away with his consuming fire, may not bide the fire of the Lordes ielousie; yit he dispairs not: But the Lord casts his seruants very low; to quhat end? To the end, that they may feele in their hearts and consciences, quhat Christ suffered for thame in the yarde, and on the crosse, in saull and bodie: Yea, wee wald thinke, that there had bene plaine collusion betwixt the Father and the Son, and that his suffering had bene na suffering: except we felt in our sauls in som mesure, the hell quhilk hee susteined in full measure.
Swa to the effect, that wee might clearelie vnderstand the bitternes of sin, that we might knaw, how far wee are addetted to Christ, quha suffered sicke torments for our sinne, and that we may be the mair able to thank him, and to praise his halie name: hee suffers his awin seruants to dout, but not to dispair: he forgiues thir doutings, he forgiues thir stam rings, and in his awn time, hee supports tham, and brings vs to the waters of life.
Thir doubtings, as haue oft spoken, may ludge in ane saul with faith; for douting faith, are not extreamly opponed; Onelie faith and dispair, are extreamelie opponed: and therfore, faith and dispair, can not baith ludge in ane saule; for dispair cuts the pillers of hope, and quher there is na hope, there cann bee na faith.
But as to doubting, it mann ludge, it will ludge, and hes ludged in the saules of the best seruants that euer God had.
Looke to the Apostle, we are alwayis in doubt, saith he, but we dispair not.
Sa, douting and faith may ludge in an saul: quherfra flowes this doubting? We knaw, that in the regenerat man, there is a remnant corruptioun: For wee gett not our heauen in this earth: suppose we beginn our heauen heere, wee get it not fullie heere: And gif all corruption were away, quhat suld there rest, but a full heauen heere? Sa it is onelie begun in this life, and not perfited; therefore there remains in the saul, a great corruptioun, quhilk is neuer idle, but continuallie occupied.
This corruption is euer bringing foorth the birth of sinn, part lesse, part mair; euerie sin hurts the conscience; ane hurt conscience, impairs the perswasion, and sa comes in the doubting.
For there is not a sinne that we commit, but it bannishes light, casts a slough ouer the eie of our faith, quherby, wee doubt and stammer in our sight.
And were not the Lord of his mercy taks vs vp, giues vs the gift of repentance, and maks vs euery day, als oft as we sin, to cry als oft for mercy, sa to repair the losse that wee haue of faith, to repair the losse quhilk we haue of the feeling of mercie, we wald gang on, and halely put out that same light.
But it pleases the Lorde; suppose we be euerie day sinning, to giue vs the gift of repentance; be repentance, to repaire our faith, to repaire the sense and feeling of mercie in vs, and to put vs in that same estait of perswasion, quherein we were off before.
Therefore, gif God beginn not, continue not, and ende not with mercie: in that same moment, that he abstracts his mercie fra vs, we will decaye.
Swa, yee mann bee diligent incallers for mercie: ye mann be instant continuallie, in seeking to haue a feeling of mercie.
Now, howsoeuer it be sure and certain that the faith of the best children of God is subject to doubting: yit it is als sure certaine, that it is neuer healilie extinguished, albeit it were neuer sa weak, yit it sall neuer vtterlie decay and perish out of the hart, quherein it makes ains residence.
This comfort and consolation, the Spirite of God hes set downe in his word, to hald vp the troubled hart: that howsoeuer faith bee weake, yit a weake faith, is faith: and quhere that faith is, there mann euer bee mercie.
that the giftes and calling of God, are without repentaunce.
But amang all his giftes that are of this sort, faith is ane of the cheefest, therfore it can not be reuoked againe.
that faith is ains giuen to the saints: ains giuen: that is, constantly giuen, neuer to bee changed, nor vtterlye tane fra thame.
The Lorde will not repent him of this gift, but the saul quhilk he hes luifit ains, he will luif perpetually· It is true and certaine, that the spoonks of faith quhilk are kindled in the hart be the Spirite of God; certaine it is, they may be smored for a lang time: they may bee couered with the asses of our awin corruption, and with our awin ill deeds and wickednes, in the quhilk we fall: it is true, that the effects of a liuelie faith wil be interrupted, and that thy lusts and affections will preuaile for a lang time: Sa that quhen thou lookes on thy self, vpon the judgements of GOD that hangs on saull and bodie, and quhen thou lookes vpon thy dissolute life, and on the anger of God agains this dissolute life: In the minde, in the hart and conscience of him that hes sa smored and oppressed his faith, it will oft times come to pas in his awin judgement, hauing his eies fixt on him self onlie: that he will thinke him to be a reprobate, to be ane affcast, and neuer able to recouer mercie.
Quhere this corruption burstis furth in gros maner, efter that the Lord hes called thee: Look howe sone the Lorde beginns to walken thee again: incontinent, thou fixes thine eies vpon thine awin life, and enters in a deepe consideration, als weill of the grauity of thy sinne; as of the weight of the wrath of God, quhilk thou seeis following thereon; and is salaith to remit thy cogitation, to pans vpon the deepnes of the mercie of God; standing fixt in this co~sideration, it can not bot come to pas in thy awin judgement, bot thou art ane And yit God forbid it wer sa, for suppose they sponks of the spirit be coue+red, be the corruption that is within thy saul, yit they sponks ar not halily put out And to let you see, that they are not put out, suppose they burst not foorth in the outwarde effectes, that the warlde may knaw thee to bee ane faithfull man as it wont to doe; yit thir spoonkes are not idle, and thou sall finde thame not to bee idle in thee.
As for the confirmation of my argument, that howsoeuer our bodies bee lowsed to all dissolutioun, efter our effectuall calling within vs in our sauls, and that yit the spoonks are not idle, yee see, that suppose the fire bee couered with the asses; yit it is a fire: there is na man will say, that the fire is put out suppose it bee couered: Na mair is faith put out of the saull, suppose it be sa couered, that it nather shawe hewe nor light outwardlie.
Example of this wee haue clearlie in DAVID: Efter his lamentatioun in that psalme of repentance.
he prayes to God in thir terms: Cast mee not away from thy presence: And quhat subjoines hee? And tak not thine halie spirit from mee.
Had he not lost the Spirit, be his adultery and murther? Na: for hee walde not haue saide then, take it not from mee, but restore it to mee.
It is true, he vsis sick fashion of language, as PSAL.
he sayes: Restore to mee the joy of thy saluation: not that he lacked the Spirit healilie; but that the Spirit lacked force in him, and mistered strengthening and fortification: It wald bee steered vp, that the flame of it might appeare.
Therefore saye, in respect DAVID sayes sa clearlie, efter his adulterie and murther; take not that Spirite from mee: it is a certaine argument, that the faithfull hes neuer the Spirite of GOD alwayes tane fra thame, in thair greatest dissolutions.
The second point is this; How proue that thir spoonks are not idle, suppose the outward effects bee interrupted.
As DAVID felt this in his conscience, sa euery ane of you may feele it in your awin consciences.
The Spirit of God in mans heart can not bee idle, but thir spoonkes, in the mean time that the bodie is castin lowse to all dissolutions, thir spoonkes are accusing thy dissolution, are finding fault with thy manners: thir spoonkes suffers thee not to take the pleasure of thy body, without great bitternesse, and continuall remorse.
And thir spoonkes quhere they are, they will make the saull quherein they dwel, to vtter thir voces, at ane time or vther; ains in the twentie fowre howres: Allas, am dooing the ill quhilk wald not doe, gif hadd power or strength to resist my affectioun, and gif might be maister of my affection, wald not for all the warld do the ill quhilk do.
Againe, gif had power to do the good quhilk wald doe, walde not leaue it vndoone for all the warld.
Swa thir spoonkes, suppose they haue not sick force and strength presentlie, as to resist the affection, and to halde the ill turnes vndone; yit perpetuallie in the heart, they are finding fault with thy corruption: and suffers thee not to take thy pleasure without paine: but last of all makes thee to vtter thir voces: Gif had strength to resist, walde not doe the ill quhilk do.
Quhere thir voces are, na questioun, they are the voces of a saull, quhilk the Lorde hes begun to sanctifie: and being ains sanctified, in despite of the Diuell, and of the corruption that is in vs, this faith shall neuer perish: But gif the haill saull without contradictioun, with a greedie appetite and pleasure bee caried to ill, and hes na sorrow for it: that saull is in ane ill estait: can look for nathing to sick a saull but death; except that the Lord preuent tham.
But quhere this remorse and sorrowe, and sick voces are in the saull; that saul in the time that God hes appointed, sall recouer stre~gth: The Lord sall neuer suffer they spoonkes to be halilie tane awaye, but in his awin time he sall fortifie tham, make thame to breake out before the warlde in good warks.
The Lord in his awin time, he wil sanctifie tham: he wil scatter the asses of corruption, steir vp the sponkes, make tham to breake out in a better life, nor euer they did before: as ye may clearly see that DAVIDS repentance hes done mair good to the Kirk of God, nor gif he had neuer falle~.
Thus far co~cerning the effects Suppose the effects of repentance bee interrupted, yit they spoonks are not extinguished.
For, there is na man will thinke, that the fire quhilk is couered with asses, is extinguished; but being stirred vp in the morning, it will burne als clearlie, as it did in the night before.
There is na man will compt the treeis, that nowe in the time of winter, wants leaues, fruit, and externall beautie to be dead: there is na man wil cou~t the Sun to be out of the lift; suppose it be ouercled with a clud of darknes mist: There is a great differe~ce, betwixt a sleepry disease, and death; for men ar not dead, suppose they be sleepand; and yit there is nathing lyker to death nor sleepe.
As there is great ods, betwixt a drunken man and a dead man: sa there is great odds betwixt the faith that lurks for a quhil, and vtters not the selfe, and the light that is vtterlie put out.
Quhen wee burst not foorth in outward deeds; GOD forbid that we suld thinke, that thir sponkes are halelie extinguished: Indeed the saul that is visited efter foule defectiouns fra his calling, against his knawledge; or this saul recouer the former beauty; it is in a straunge daunger.
For gif the Lord suffer thy corruption to get loose, in sik sort, that it carie thee as it will, and bee all meanes possible, make thee to labour, to put out the spoonke of regeneration.
Quhen the Lord beginnes to challenge thee, or to gar thee rander a compt of thy bygane life: the saull of that man, quhen it is challenged, is in great daunger.
Sa that, na questioun, quhen the Lord begins to lay to your charge, your dissolute life, the contempt and abuse of your calling: Assuredlie your sauls are sa neere to the brinke of desperation, that there can bee nathing nearer.
For, will thou look to God, thou will see nathing bot his anger kendled, as ane fire against thee: Will thou looke to thy selfe, thou will see nathing, bot sinne prouoking his anger: thou will see the contempt and abuse of thy calling, multiplying his anger: thou will see nathing, bot matter of dispaire.
And quhat is the best pillar surest retreat, quherupon sick a saul that is sa neere to the brinke of desperation, may repose? will giue thee ane helpe quhereupon, quhen thou art assaulted be all high tentations thou may repose: quhen there is na thing before thee bot death, quhen thou seeis the Diuell accusing thee, thine awin conscience bearing him witnes against thee, thy life accusing thee, and the abuse of thy calling accusing thee, quhere sall thou ga? Ga back ouer againe, to thy bygane experience, cast ouer thy memorie, and remember, gif God at ony time, in onye sort hes loued thee: gif euer thou hes felt the loue and fauour of God in thy heart and conscience: Remember gif euer the Lorde hes swa disposed thy heart, that as hee loued thee, thou loued him: and had a desire to get him.
Remember on this, and repose thine assurance on this: that as he loued thee ains, hee will loue thee ay, and will assuredlie restore thee to that loue, or thou die.
The heart that felt ains this loue of God, sall feele it againe: And look quhat gift, or grace, or quhat taist of the power of the warlde to com, that euer the Lord gaue to his creatures in this life: to that same degree of mercie, hee sall restore his creature or euer it depart this life.
Sa the saull that is tossed with high assaultes, and great dangers: quhere present things will not helpe, it is necessare, that it haue recourse to bigane things, and keepe in memorie, the bigane experience of mercie, quhilk the Lorde hes freely shawen toward that saul.
This same memory salbe sa pleasant to the saull, that it sal stay it presently fra desperation, vphauld it vnto the time, the Lord pacifie that hart, and giue comfort to that saul: quhilk being done, that saull sall see, that howsaever hee was angry, he was angry onely for a quhile.
speake thir things, not that thinke, that euery an of you hes taisted of tham: and yit in some measure, the seruants of God mann taist of thame, and ye that hes not taisted of thame, may taist of thame or yee die.
And therefore, quhither yee haue taisted or not taisted thame: It cannot be, but profitable for you, to lock vp this lesson in your hearts, and remember on it faithfully, that gif the Lord at onie time, put at your hearts, ye may remember, and say with your selfs; gat a lesson, to gang backe to my bigan experience, thereon to repose.
And suppose, ye be not put at presently your selfs; yit, quhen yee visite thame that are troubled in conscience; let thir things be proponit to tham as comforts, vse tham as medicaments maist meet to apply to the greif of the inward conscience: and sa ye sal make your fruit of this doctrine, posses your sauls in a good estaite.
This far for the first point, quherin euery ane of you aught to try and examine your consciences.
The second point is this, try quhither ye haue loue towards your neighbour, or not: for as we are coupled with God bee faith; sa be the band of loue, we are coupled with our neighbour: gif yee want loue· yee can haue na societye with your neighbour.
For loue is the chief principall branch, that springs of the root of faith.
Loue is that coelestial glew, that co~joins al the faithful members, in the vnity of ane mysticall bodie.
And seing that religion wes instituted of God, to serue as ane pathway to co~uoy vs to our chief felicitie: and happie we can not be, except we be like vnto our God: like vnto him we can not be, except we haue loue: For as it is set down
God is loue; Sa, seeing God is loue it selfe, quhasaeuer will resemble him, mann be indued with the oile of loue.
This only ane argument testifies to vs, that this loue is ane principal butt, quherunto al things that are co~manded in religion, aught to be referred To spend lang time in the praise of loue, it sal be na wayes necessare, seing the haly scripture resou~ds, in blasing the commendation of it: bot that we speake not of a thing ambiguous, we sall lat you see, how this word is considered and tane in the scriptures.
Loue is considered, ather as a spring and fontain, quherfra the rest proceeds: that is, for the loue, quhereby we loue God.
And as loue coms first fra God, is powred be his halie Spirit in our harts: sa, it first redounds vpward, strikes back vpon him selfe: for the loue of God mann euer ga before the loue of the creature.
Nixt, we take this word for that loue, quhereby we loue Gods creatures, our neighbours, specially them that are of the family of faith.
And thridly it is tane, for the deedes of the second table, quhilk flowes fra this loue.
Nowe, quhen speake of loue, speak of it as in the second significatioun: to wit, as it is tane for the loue of our neighbour: And taking it swa, call loue the gifte of God, powred in the harts of men women: be the quhilk gift, we first loue god in Christ our sauiour; nixt in God, for Gods cause, we loue al his creatures: bot chiefly our brethren, that ar of the familie of faith, the children of ane common father with vs.
say, first the loue of God, as it coms fra God, it returnes to God: as it coms down fra him, sa it strikes vpwarde to him againe: is it not good reason? for quhy? Let thy heart fixe thy loue als lang as thou will vpon the creaturs, thou sall neuer be satiat, nor thy affection sall neuer be content, except thou get a grip of God.
But gif ains thou loue God in thy hart, cast thy affections vpon him, and get ains a grip of him: the langer thou loue him, the greater satiety con tentment sall thou haue: thou sall not thirst for ane vther.
For, as to the creatures, there is neuer a creature that God created, but it is stamped with his awin stamp, and euery creature beares his Image: and looking to the image of God in the creature, suld it not draw thee to him, that thou fixe not thy hart vpon the creature: for his awin image in his creature, sulde lead thee to him selfe.
And therefore the mair that thou knawes the creatures; the greater varietie of knawledge that thou hes of the creatures, the mair suld euery particular knawledge of thame drawe thee to God, and the mair suld thou wonder of thy God, and knaw thy duety towards him.
And seeing that delite flowes of knawledge, and that euery knawledge, hes the awin delite with it: as the varietie of knawledge that rises vpon the creatures, suld make the minde to mount vp to the knawledge of God: sa the varietie of delites, that rises vpon the diuersitie of this knawledge, sulde moue the heart vpwarde, to the loue of God: and the hart getting a grip of God and being seased with the loue of God: and the minde being occupied with the true knawledge of God; sa sone as heart and mind is full of God, the hart is quiet and the minde is satisfied.
Sa that the mair this knawledge grows in thy mind, the greater contentment hes thou, the mair the loue of him growes in thy hart, the greater joy and rejoising hes thou in thy saull.
For quhy? In God ye haue not only all the creatures: but yee haue himself, beside the creatures: And therfore in God, ye haue al the knawledge delite that can rise of the creatures: and beside the creatures, ye haue God himselfe quha is the Creator.
And swa say, the mind of man, can neuer quiet the selfe in the knawledge, nor the heart cann neuer settle the selfe in the loue of naked creaturs, in respect they ar flowing vanitie, as SALOMON cals thame: but in the infinite God, rightlie knawin, and earnestlie loued; the mind sall see a full rest, and the heart sall haue a perfite ioy.
For our affection is sa insatiable, that na finit thing will satisfie it, nor there can bee na solide setling vpon the thing that is transitorious.
Sa the loue aught to strike vpward, and redound first to God, in quhais face, the heart sall find full and perfite ioy.
The second argument that vse, is this: seeing there is only an precept left be our master in reco~me~datio~ to be obserued be vs, to wit; that euery ane of vs suld loue anvther: Therfore our wise master, vnderstanding well, that quhere loue was, there misterd na ma laws: that the life of man, be loue only behoued to be maist happy, left only the same in chief recommendation, and taks vp the hail law euangell in a word, Loue.
And gif the hart of man were indued with loue, his life might bee maist happy and blessed: For there is nathing maks this life happy, but the resem+blance likelyhood that wee haue with God.
The nerer we draw to God, the mair blessed is our life; for there cannot be sik a happy life, as the life of God.
God is loue; therfore, the mair we draw neere to loue, the mair neer ar we to that happy life: for we are in God, partaker of the life of God.
Quhen speak this, ye mann not thinke, that loue in God, loue in vs, is an thing; for loue is but a quality in vs, it is not a quality in God; there is nathing in God but that quhilk is God; sa loue in God, is his awin essence: Therefore, the mair yee grow in loue, the neerer ye draw to God, and to that happye and blessed life.
For there is nathing mair profitable, mair agreeable and conuenient to nature, nor to loue; and aboue al things to loue God: And therefore it is, that God and his Angels are maist happy blist, because they loue all thinges, and desires ever to doe good.
On the vther side, there is nathing mair vnhappy, nathing mair noysum, mair hurtfull, and that eats vpp nature mair, nor to burn with envie and hatred, And heirfore it is, that the deuils ar maist miserable, quha torments thame selues with continual mallice and hatred, burning with ane vehement appetite, to bee noysum to all creatures.
Sa as the life of the Deuill is maist vnhappy, because hee is full of envie and malice: Siclike our life mann be maist happy, gif wee be full of loue.
To speake of loue will na farder: Onelie gif ye haue loue, marke the effects of it, set downe
vers. quhilk effectes, gif yee haue not in some measure, yee haue not true loue.
end heere, yee see in quhat points, euery ane of you aught to be prepared; ye mann bee indued with this loue, and yee mann bee indued with faith: and gif yee haue thir in onie smal mesure; gang baldly to the hearing of the word, and to the receauing of the Sacrament.
This is the preparation that we allow of: grant, the Papistes hes a preparatioun, but nathing like to this, and therefore they cann haue na warrand of the word of God.
Last of all, seeing wee are commanded to try our selfs: he that lacks knawledge, cannot try himselfe: furious man cannot try himselfe: childe cannot try himself: therefore they aught not to com to the Table.
All thir things being weill considered; he that hes faith loue in ony kind of measure, let him come to the Table.
And all thir things seruis, als weil for the hearing of the word fruitfully, as for the receuing of the Sacrament.
Therefore, the Lord of his mercie illuminate your mindes, and worke some measure of faith and loue in your hearts: that yee may be partakers of that heauenly life, offered in the worde and Sacraments: that ye may begin your heauen heere, and get the full fruition of the life to come, and that in the righteous merits of Christ Iesus: To quhom with the Father, and the halie Ghaist, be all honor, praise, and glorie, for nowe and euer: Amen.

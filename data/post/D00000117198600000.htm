the case of the english weavers and french merchants truly stated
the design of the weavers in their bill contained in the preamble is the encouragement of them in their trade which is confessed by all to be necessary and very beneficial to the whole nation which they say is much discouraged by the frequent importation of silks especially from france most of which are privately conveyed hither without paying of custome by which means the french merchants are sufficiently enabled to undersell the weavers in their commodities and consequently carry away the trade of these nations
the french merchants in answer to this say the weavers of england are under a great mistake and that their discouragement is not because the french merchants do not pay their customes but because the weavers live too high and are not so good workmen
and as the weavers in their preamble refer to the books for proof so have they ingeniously done likewise
therefore here follows a true accompt of the particular entries of all wrought as well as unwrought silks in the port of london from michaelmas to ditto
together with the places from whence they came by which it will truly appear whether the english weavers or the french merchants are under a mistake and it is humbly submitted to serious consideration it being conceived by some eminent merchants and tradesmen in and about this city to be a matter of very high concernment to trade and the general interest of the nation

observations
besides to the entries of silks wrought up here may be added the great revenue that comes to the king by dying stuff imported which amounts the same year to a great quantity whereof is used in the dying of the silks here manufactured
it is worthy observation that the wrought silks imported are doubly rated to the silks that are manufactured here so that there hath been entred at the port of london of wrought silks weight less than one fourth part of the silks wrought here
now the french merchants say that we make not so many as they import and it is too true because we are prevented by their unfair dealing nay tis verily believed and by some of themselves confessed that we make not one sixth part of the silks that are worn in these nations but suppose there were one third part made here how greatly then is the king wronged and his subjects the handicrafts men discouraged when instead of accompting at the for per ann and upwards they pay but little more than
subsidy for the additional duty is not to be accompted in this calculation
from hence it appears that the french merchants are greatly mistaken in their grounds of the english weavers discouragement in their trade for certainly per ann and upwards with the additional duty added to it escaping customs will enable them to carry on their trade and consequently incourage a forreign interest when the english artists must sit still although as good if not better workmen than the french as may be proved if occasion offers
but to take particular notice of the french manufactures of silks imported if the merchants and traders therein be observed they will be found to be most guilty of the occasion of the weavers complaint by their bill therefore here follows a true accompt of what they have entred at london and other ports from michaelmas to ditto

it is modestly conjectured that the french merchants trade for at least double the quantity in silks more than the natives and yet they enter not one ninth part in weight of silk to what the english do nor pay little more than one third in subsidy to the king so that did they make a true entry whereas they pay they ought to pay per annum so that they pay short of their duties in subsidy
but if they object that a great part of this silk is wrought up in ribbons laces against that may be set the vast quantities of their ribbons laces which are imported without paying any duty because prohibited and besides allow them to take off one half for the manufactures of ribbons and laces made here which is the most they can reasonably do yet notwithstanding they answer not their duty by per ann in subsidy besides a moiety thereof for additional duty
it is observable that far greater quantities of french silks are vended in these nations than of italian silks and yet enter not so much in weight neither do the italian wrought silks so much prejudice the native artists because few or none of those kinds or sorts of silks are here manufactured but by the frequent importation of french silks and stuffs which are chiefly paid for with monies not with other commodities the english artists are greatly discouraged as from others so especially from the making of fashionable figured silks and stuffs in which they are sufficiently skilful and most inclinable to therefore the discountenance of the french silks and stuffs is chiefly aimed at by the weavers bill
these things considered it makes the weavers wonder that the french merchants should in their paper say the king would lose per ann if a seal for their goods be appointed which they know is the only way to prevent their goods from escaping the customs and many other inconveniences by the french trade whereas by the accompt aforesaid it appears there was paid in subsidy for all silks from forreign parts but little more than in one year
nor do the weavers design a monopoly as is reflected by this seal they being no way fond of that trouble but willing to wave the same if any other way may be found as effectual to the end designed by their bill that is security of his majesties customs and incouragement to english artists in their trade
after a serious perusal hereof it is hoped the french merchants reasons against the weavers bill will be weighed in the ballance with the grand end intended and then no question but they will be found too light all which is humbly submitted

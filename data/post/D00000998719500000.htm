sir henry vane his speech

my lord maior and worthy aldermen and the rest of the gentlemen of the citie of london the houses of parliament have seldome in matters of any great importance but beene ready to communicate them unto your selves as knowing how neerely you have interested your selves with them in these publique dangers and for the publique liberties of the kingdome and preservation of religion at this time above all the rest they have thought it necessary to acquaint you with a resolution which they have take in regard that as they have had former experiences of your ready affections in all cases of exigency to assist them and in them

your selves and the whole kingdome so they doe not doubt but at this time they shall bee prevented by your owne inclinations considering that what they have now in hand is if it can bee possible to put a speedy issue to these unhappy and to these lingring distractions that wee have had thus many yeares together the occasion of their resolution is this it having pleased god by the late overthrow which hee gave the enemy by sir william wallers forces for to occasion the enemy now to draw out all his garrisons to endeavour to take the field with all the power hee can make and if it bee possible to come suddenly upon those forces that so lately routed them the parliament thought it wisedome and providence for to give order for all their forces on the south side trent those under my lord manchesters association those likewise of the severall garrisons that can bee spared those also of his excellency my lord generalls army that at this time is in a hopefull way of recruting and likewise in the last place those that they might expect from your owne ready affections they have known your willingnesse they have knowne your watchfulnesse at all times for to comply with their occasions and with the necessities of the commonwealth at this time they doubt not but you will bee the more encouraged to it because through the blessing of god it may put an issue unto this warre at least it is that as is in the parliaments desire and will bee in their endeavours they have therefore thought fit thus publiquely to recommend this businesse to you to quicken your affections which are at all times very much stirred up for their service and they doubt not therefore will bee to this they desire you therefore as knowing the severall wayes that you have among your selves for subscriptions for contributions for setting out those that are of able bodies and of good affections to the cause knowing how much that this citie hath sent forth and those persons that have beene an honour to the citie in behaving themselves with that gallantry as that it may bee truely said that the enemy doth apprehend no forces like unto those that come out of this citie being persons that for religion for courage for faithfulnesse to the cause and for publiquenesse of spirit to the parliament have ever shewed themselves as firme and as forward as any whatsoever they doe not doubt but you will shew your selves so at this time also and acquit your like men which is that as am for to recommend to you there

collonell hollis his speech

my lord major and citizens of this famous citie whith have done so famous things for religion for the parliament for the whole kingdome truely there needs not many words to encourage you your owne affections prevent all that can bee said you have beene sufficiently told the occasion of this meeting with you by these committees which are sent from the two houses of parliament your owne wisedomes doth sufficiently informe you of the necessitie of doing that which is now desired of you by these lords here and these gentlemen that have spoken before it hath pleased

god to give us a very great advantage by that happy successe which god gave to the endeavours of that gallant
gentleman sir william balsore and that other gallant gentleman sir william waller it behooves us to improve this occasion and it hath beene the wisedome of all states as it is the dutie of all christians to meete gods blessings and to goe along with them but truely besides this there is a necessitie lies upon you too for there is as great a wisedome to meet the enemy and to prevent him in his designes hee is now drawing and assembling all his forces together and therefore you are not onely invited unto it by such reasons as wisedome may suggest unto you but by such forcible arguments as necessitie imposes to you this is necessary for you to doe for your preservation my lord generall who hath spoken to you hee hath told you how ready and how willing hee is to engage himselfe to adventure his person his life his fortunes all that hee hath with you he hath had experience of your fidelitie before and hath received the fruits of it severall times and that makes him am sure the more cheerefully offer himselfe to you againe and wee all know your affections to him to bee such as you will not suffer him to goe into the field but as the generall of the forces raised by the parliament for the defence of religion and libertie if his army had been recruted this had not beene needfull unto you at this time but it hath pleased god so that other occasions have diverted it that his army not being recruted for then hee would have beene willing to have spared you hee knowes how much it concernes the wealth and trade of this citie that you should keepe at home to follow your occasions here and that your purses as they have alwayes beene should have beene open to supply the wants of the army hee would have spared you but now the parliament throw themselves on your affections and desire you to offer your selves as one man for it is to no purpose to goe by little and little it is but as a little water throwne on the fire that doth but enrage it and will not quench it but now if all will joyne their purses their persons and their prayers together doubt not but we shall through gods blessing see an end of these miserable and distracted times and the lord put it into your hearts to doe that which is fit for you to doe which wee know you will doe

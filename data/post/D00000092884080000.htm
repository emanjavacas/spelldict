live in the life and power and wisdome of god every where then you live in christ the saviour the redeemer the leader of his people israel the son of god who came not to do his own will for nothing but life and power and wisdome shall stand and be a hiding place in the terrible day at hand therefore feel it possess it enjoy it all ye who profess your selves to be followers of christ and remember that a name to live is not enough or to be counted a follower of the lamb but feel and possess the lambs life which takes away the sin that bears the iniquity for god is raising his own seed into dominion and victory over all and his kingdome which hath no end which shall abolish all other kingdomes feel him born whose right it is to raign upon whose shoulders the government must be christ the power of god and the wisdome of god the leader and preserver of his people know him all people who profess his name in words and appearance in you or else you are reprobates foolish virgins without life without power without wisdome from above that's pure and peaceable so dwell in the dread and power life and wisdome of god that you may be found in christ iesus the saviour in whom the father is well pleased that by him you may be lead guided and preserved to gods glory and be the wise virgins possessing the

oyle which makes glad the soul the substance the light life and power of god in which alone is salvation and not in another for the day of tryal is come that nothing will stand but life it self therefore every one to his tent dwelling in the retiredness in the stilness in the patience feeling the life of god the undaunted spirit that lifts up a standard when the enemy comes like a flood and be not deceived with dreams or a spirit of slumber but be awakened and feel the power that raiseth the dead and quickneth up to god and keeps in the awakenedness your hearts open unto him your understandings cleared by the thundering power of the lord god which cleares all which drives away the clouds and causes the showers to descend to the refreshing of the seed immortal in which alone the blessing is to whom the mercyes are and with whom the covenant is and promises are amen for ever

so all feel and possess the pure power of the eternal god then you feel the covenant and live in the covenant then you live with god as enoch did in the new and living way which abides for ever to all generations christ the seed which bruiseth the serpents head and reconciles to god the father of it so all friends who feel the power of god live in it dwell in it then you dwell in gods covenant which he made with abraham and his seed for ever then you know the words of god in the mouth of the seed which never goes out but is in the covenant in the power christ for ever who is come to destroy the works of the divel to smite the earth with the rod of his mouth and to slay the wicked with the breath of his lips to whom all judgement is committed in heaven and earth to whom every knee must bow of things in heaven and things in earth this is the higher power let every soul be subject to it guided by it possess it live in it then you know christ as the wife the husband then you know the church that is in god the piller and ground of truth but who are from the power of god in themselves are from christ are from the new covenant are from the wisdome of god are from the leader are from the redeemer and saviour not members of his body such know not the redeemer to live such know not the bride the lambs wife the kings daughter which is all glorious within such know not the cross of christ for the cross of christ is the power of god which croseth bindeth and limiteth the self will and wandering desires of the earthly man such are the foolish virgins with the lamps a form without the oyle the power the anointing which makes the face to shine gives boldness strength joy peace courage and dominion over all the contrary

now is the day come which shall manifest all things who are in the power and who are out of the power for who are in the power are in christ the saviour the covenant of god and who are out of the power are out of gods covenant in which all things are good and blessed and so are yet in the fall not raised by the power but in the curse and the ground of it so read within with the light of gods witness and see the ground in which ye now stand whether it be in gods covenant the power and life and wisdome from above or whether out of it in the alienation in the lower power the fall out of gods covenant and life which giveth dominion over all the world death hell and the grave and the darkness and powers of it
so all who dwell in gods covenant you dwell in that which he hath remembred which was with abraham his friend who rejoyced to see his day and with isack and iacob in whom the seed was called for whose sake he will plead with all flesh and work wonderful things for the deliverance of his chosen remnant so feel that which makes you valiant for the truth upon earth read within upon the earth let the truth be and you in it valiant and bold giving up all in the will of the eternal god for he loveth a chearful giver and in so doing you will feel in the stilness blessings and rest with him in the midst of trials and tribulations for by his outstretched arme is he gathering his seed from the four corners of the earth and will bring them into the holy land which is prepared a rest for them that love him so all friends dwell in the truth it self in gods power and wisdome and fear which will keep the mind staid and stable in dominion over all the fear and threats of men and out of all the snares and temptations of the divel and the world in him which was before the fears the snares the world the divel and the persecuting spirit was and will be when it shall be no more for ever in which your souls will rejoyce and prayse the lord who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light in which is no occasion of stumbling but keeps in the pure feeling and discerning moderation and setlednesse above the darke mountains where we feel him dayly gods delight before the hills the mountains or the foundations of the earth were laid in whom are all the treasures of life wisdome and knowledge so all friends dwell in him and lye down in him where none can make you afraid

and keep your meetings every where and wait in the dread of god and be zealous for his name and truth and live in the retiredness in which his terrible power ariseth in his lambs and babes to guide and preserve

them in dominion and life over all to his glory and their comfort and pure refreshment in his everlasting covenant which changeth not and keep out of all extremes to the right hand or left but judge it and rule and reigne with christ the unchangeable covenant of god whose kingdome is not of this world whose throne is heaven and the earth his footstool here you dwell in the elect which cannot be deceived nor overcome

so all live in the power the love of god out of all rents strife prejudice and contentions in christ the covenant the holy mountain where there is no hurting nor destroying but dominion over all changeables known in the free life and seed which hath no end of which god is father which changeth not and out of covetousnesse which is idolatry and slavish fears of tryals and want therein and out of carelesnesse and excesse in the moderation and wisdome of god and fashion not your selves like unto them that know not god but know and follow him that is not of this world whose garment is without seam or rent woven from the top to the bottome whose life and wisdome and doctrine the world cannot receive so hears the crosse known to the lusts of the flesh the lusts of they and the pride of life which is not of the father but of the world so all in the crosse dwell which crucifies to the world and the nature spirit and wayes of it in which the saints glory is and peace which gives to feel over all the earth and unclean spirits in gods kingdome for ever to reign
so in his eternal power and dominion life wisdome and peace the lord god almighty keep and preserve all his upright hearted and tender lambs unto himself pure and spotless unto the end amen
this a faithful testimony and visitation of gods spirit unto all who professe his name in this notable day of tryal in which he will make a final seperation between the two seeds in which none shall abide covered but such as are covered with the spirit of the lord

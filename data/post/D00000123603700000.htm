lord chancellor's petition to his highness the prince of orange on his entrance into london

most humbly sheweth

that your petitioner who was once lord high chancellor of england is now become the lowest of your supplicants and from the first and chiefest councellor about the throne a miserable dejected captive in the tower

do not presume to justifie my integrity that would be an arrogance as black as my crimes
confess am as unworthy to live as am unwilling to die and therefore prostrate my self to the of your grace and clemency that fountain of inexhausted goodness whence only mercy can flow upon so vile and notorious a delinquent
to innumerate my crimes would be as numberless as the enemies have created by them nor will presume to prophane your sacred ears with so black a catalogue whose precious minutes are more happily imploy'd in the weightier affairs of the nation the restitution of those laws and liberties which by my byass'd and precipitate council endeavour'd to subvert
what cou'd be more pernicious and destructive to the fundamental laws of the nation than to establish a power in the monarch to dispence with them what greater inlet to popery than to take off the test and penal laws what deeper stroke to the protestant church than to erect a court of ecclesiastical commissioners to pull down her pillars what sharper persecution of the prelates than by publishing an arbitrary declaration for the of which illegal warrant so many since have been treated as criminals in the tower nor cou'd there be a more irregular method than the late regulating of corporations for a free election of parliament
in all which and many others to my shame must confess have been all along a principal counsellor and instrument
these may it please your highness are the crying crimes which were they yet greater is in your power to mitigate by your intercessions to the parliament having already the king's pardon
if you vouchsafe this mercy to an humble supplicant will promise in some measure to make retaliation by discovering some arcana imperii or intriegues of state what am capable of which may highly concern your highness's interest in this kingdom

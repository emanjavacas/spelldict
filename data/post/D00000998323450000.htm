divine love or the willingness of jesus christ to save sinners discovered in three divine dialogues between


christ and a publican

christ and a pharisee

christ and a doubting christian

with several other brief tracts
by london printed for crouch at the george over against the

to the reader
this treatise though small in bulk yet may be of more use then the many great volumes of controversy wherewith the press and the world have so many years been tired

the method is very plain

and familiar by way of dialgue though it is sometimes much abused yet may be managed to the profit and benefit of the reader as hope this is which is intended for the use of honest plain hearted christians to shew them almost all in the words of jesus christ himself his exceeding willingness to save and help poor humble repenting and returning sinners as also his rejecting and casting off of proud self conceited and

pharisees and hypocrites who having never been sensible of the exceeding sinfulness of sin do therefore never understand the absolute necessity of a saviour if any poor soul receive the least spiritual advantage by it have my end in this publication

v.p

divine love discovered in three dialogues


between christ and a publican

between christ and a pharisee
between christ and a doubting christian

the first between christ and a publican

in the great day of the feast jesus stood and cryed saying if any man thirst let him come to me joh
then

drew near all the publicans and sinners for to hear him luke
and he said unto one of them

jesus poore publican what makes thee draw near to me

publican because they say lord that thou art a friend of publicans sinners mat

so am and thou art welcome my beloved friend sit down therefore with me and my disciples mat



good master though am unworthy to come into thy presence yet through thy leave i'le sit here at thy feet to hear

thy gracious words mark
luke
john

how knowest thou that my words are gracious

lord have heard thee say that publicans harlots shall enter into the kingdom of heaven before the pharisees which think themselves far better than us mat
luke


and what say the pharisees to that


they murmur among themselves and say this man receiveth sinners and eateth with them luke



didst thou ever hear

ine preach besides that time

yes once besides and it was the best and comfortablest sermon that ever heard

dost thou remember any of it



yes though have a bad memory yet remember thou didst say if a man had a hundred sheep and did loose one of them he would leave the ninety and nine in the wilderness and go after that which was lost until he find it and when he had found it he sayeth it on his shoulders rejoycing and when he comes home he calleth together his

friends and neighbours saying unto them rejoyce with me for have found my sheep that was lost


is that all thou dost remember



no remember somewhat more that thou didst speak of a woman that had ten pieces of silver and when she had lost one piece shee sought for it till she had found it and then called her neighbours together to rejoyce with her
also thou speakest of a man that had two sons the one that lived still at home and was obedient to his father the other that went away from

his father and spent his fathers means among harlots till he came to poverty and yet when he returned to his father his father did receive him willingly and made him great welcome and entertainment

well done my friend thou hast well remembred but dost thou know why speak these comparisons


no sir do not well know that


it was to comfort and encourage the publicans and great sinners that did here me and to silence the jews that did murmur because they came to hear me and because received them


it is true lord there were many of us there then but we did not know what thou didst mean by the lost sheep the lost piece and the wicked son


did mean thy and companions the publicans harlots and sinuers that are in a lost condition because of your sins and wickedness in the eyes of others as the pharisees quite lost and adjudged to perish for ever


but who was it lord that did seek for the lost sheep and the lost piece of silver



it was who am the saviour

of sinners and the shepherd of the sheep that am come to seek and to save that which is lost luk
mat

lord am one of those that are lost what shall do to be saved act



am the way and the door if any man enter in he shall be saved and whosoever believeth on me shall not perish but have everlasting life joh



lord canst thou save such a sinner as am



yes have power to save and power to destroy but came not to destroy

mens lives but to save them jam

and art thou willing lord that should be saved

yes am willing that all should be saved and come to the knowledg of the truth tim



but lord am a wicked and a sinful man luke


know dear soul thou art so but came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance mat


but lord am not an ordinary but an extraordinary sinner

notwithstanding poor man hearken for thy comfort there was a certain creditor that had two debtors the one owed five hundred pence and the other fifty and when they had nothing to pay he freely forgave them both luk


but lord am a greater sinner then either of them both for have nothing but sinned all my life time



what though am come to deliver those that were all their life time subject to

bondage heb



lord be merciful to me being a sinner

for think there is not a greater sinner upon earth then am luke


am merciful and will be merciful and will pardon thy sins jer

lord am such a sinner deserve no pardon for have wearied thee with my sins

though thou dost not deserve pardon and though thou hast wearied me with thy sins yet will pardon thy iniquities for my own names sake esa

lord do think my sins are so great that it is impossible for them to be pardoned

do not think or say so for all things are possible to him that believeth mark


but my sins are so red think all the water in the sea cannot wash them away

though thy sins be as scarlet they shall be as white as snow and though they be red like crimson they shall be as wool if thou wilt turn to me from them for my blood can cleanse thee from all sin esa
john


but lord if should turn to thee from them yet they are written down and thou wilt not blot them out jer


am he that bloteth out thy transgressions yea have bloted out as a thick cloud thy transgressions and as a cloud thy sins return therefore unto me for have redeemed thee esa



but if should return unto thee yet when sin again thou wilt remember my sins


no will pardon thee and thy sins and iniquities will remember no more heb

oh lord am the child of wicked parents and thou hast said thou wilt visit the sins of the father upon the children to the third and fourth generation

oh but lord scarce think that any so wicked as my self were saved for was an idolater an adulterer

the character of a true christian with some divine contemplations observations and directions to a holy life

a true christian is one that hath had clear convictions of sin especially his master sin unbelief and of christ that is the want and worth of him and of judgment that is of punishment as the due desert of sin joh



he is unbottomed and broken off from himself he hath no confidence in himself his birth education parts performances and best works are impure and imperfect in his own sight phil

isa

he is hardly brought to believe he hardly believes that he doth believe and hardly casts away his confidence when he doth once truly believe


upon selfe suspition he doth greatly desire to be searched and doth earnestly search himself psal

and last and psal


he doth resolve never to go on in any sin or to neglect any duty

he prays to god most against his dearest and master sin and praises god most when he hath power against it

he never repents for any sin he hath forsaken for any good he hath done or for any affliction he hath suffered for christ


he hath love to all christians and seeks unity among all and makes union

and godliness the ground of his fellowship and communion phil

pet

rom
cor


in reading the scripture he observes what helps on his holiness and teacheth as well as what increaseth knowledg

he cares not what he hath whether he goes nor what he suffers with christ and for him without sin

his faith helps on his holiness and his holiness helps up his faith



though he alwaies resolves to follow christ through every condition yet he much suspects and fears that he shall not be able to hold out

he seeks and prizes holiness to serve god here as much as happiness hereafter

he fears god and sin more then men and suffering gen
dan


he neglects not his duty though he knows there is great danger in doing of it deut



he is one that is careful to lay in and to get true grace in his heart as well as in his profession as the wise scribe mat
and wise virgin mat

he can and dare do nothing against the truth cor
especially if he knows it

he cleaves to the lord and follows after the lord fully in the worst times and when others forsake him num
joh


he respects all and rejects none of gods commandments

psal
sam



he takes patiently and thankfully the harshest words and the hardest dealings of god sam

kings
job
to the end

he is much affected with and afflicted for the sufferings of the godly and the sins of the wicked as david jeremiah lot paul

he is one that when he is recovered from his former backsliding remembers his former good condition and prizes it and praises god

and hates his sin more then he did before hos
and


he seeks and esteems sincerity more then any garnishing gifts prizes plain and poor christians that are honest and upright more then they that have parts and wealth if they be less sincere

he is one that exerciseth a good conscience in all things

he is one that fears god and his name and desires grace for grace sake neh



he is one that prays at his first conversion acts
god hath no children

he beholds christ in the deepest affliction as well as in the most spiritual ordinance

he believes he shall sooner overcome his outward enemies by praying for them then by praying against them

he prefers christ before self and suffering before sinning



he desires to live so holy that we may keep christ in heaven undispleased the spirit within him ungreived his conscience undefiled unwounded and unseared his profession unstained his brethren unoffended and poor sinners unstumbled


his care is to wait on god to walk with god to work all his works in and for god to bring his will to submit to the will of god in all things to glorifie god and to gain good to himself by all he doth and suffereth to do what good he can to others

and receive what good he can from other christians to deny himself and to be found in christs righteousness without his own phil




a true christian will desire to be freed from
doubts of his eternal condition
from the power of corruption
from the fire of the law in his conscience
from the fierce temptations of sathan
from scruples in matters of opinion
from wicked places and persons where he can neither do nor receive good nor be without danger of evil


from a bad frame of heart as hardness straightness lukewarmness
from the fear of death


a true christian desires
to know god in christ
to know himself in christ
to know christ in him
to know himself as he was without christ eph
tim

wicked and wretched in respect of sin unwilling to good and weak in respect of good rom
and
and

a miscellany of divine contemplations observations and directions to a holy life

a christian is to put forth his faith in prayer and afterwards to follow his prayer with faith

reading of the scripture helps meditation meditation prayer and prayer every good work



man may come too late to god when the door is shut but god never comes too late to men luk
mat

pray that thy last days and last works may be best and that when thou comest to die thou maist have nothing else to do but to die

tis very hard to behold our own gifts without pride and the gifts of others if they excel ours without envy


do not commend thy friend nor discommend

thy soe too much least thou be judged to be partial


oh my soul will neither great love great mercy great forbearance great intreaty great patience great promises nor great wages prevail with thee to serve christ free better and more constant and selfdenying

a deep sence of sin begets deep sorrow for sin and true sorrow for sin leads to faith and from hence flows inward peace joy and holiness



a passionate and troubled spirit is like a little rill of water which every shower of rain changeth the colour of it and makes it muddy

the fear of death is ingrafted in the common nature of all men but faith works it out of christians

nothing will be terrible where the love of god is apprehended and nothing grievous where love to christ is excercised


careless hearing makes carnal hearts and carnal

hearts makes cursed lives


oh my soul look for death hourly long for it greatly prepare for it carefully meet and welcome it joyfully for it is christs servant to direct his spouse the soul to him and thy friend that comes to set thee at liberty from thy sins it will discharge thee from thy prison dismist thee from thy sorrows and bring thee at once to enjoy all thy desires


christians though disagrecing in opinion should agree in affection and

though differing in controversie yet should agree in charity


he that cannot pitty the sinner and hate sin doth not reprove out of love to christ nor from a gracious spirit

god makes christians feel him or his hand that he may hear them strokes makes crys and whippings mournful complaints to him


my soul bear up with christ bear off from sathan and the world bear down thy corruptions

and bear forth thy testimony


clear knowledge of christ in the understanding begets fervent love in the heart and both godliness in the life

he that would live for himselfe only or cheifly in the world is not worthy to live a day in it

would be glad to be out of the world when have no service to do for god in it


god hath set the tongue between the brains and

heart that it may advise with both and guarded it with teeth to keep it in and yet how unruly it is


a christians security and safety is in doing his duty and he should always study his duty more then his safety for if he will take care to please god god will take care to preserve him

the love of the master the sweetness of the service and the greatness of the reward are sufficient encouragements to serve christ



the heaviest afflictions on earth are but light in comparison of christs sufferings sins desert or the punnishment of the wicked in hell

lay in lay up lay out for christ and remember that you will shortly reach immortallity but never eternity

oh christian why should not he please thee who art but finite that pleases god who is infinite even jesus christ


a christian should desire

to dye that he may be fully freed from sin and have a full fruition of christ that he may be above all fears and doubts and may be able to serve the lord incessantly and unweariedly


a true christian when he goes from hence changes neither his work nor company but his place and condition only


be still imployed in doing good and you shall not be much tempted or troubled with evil for the devil hath great advantage both against those

that are idle or
david was found guilty of the first sam

and jehosophat in the last chron



sence of misery must precede sence of mercy and the more we feel and fear misery the more we desire seek for and prize mercy

it is the least of afflictions to be afflicted by men for they can afflict but the outward man only and of all man is the emy but god yea satan and do afflict the is more intollerable



that christian is most in prayer that hath most sence of his own wants and is most comfortable ordinarily that is most penitent and the same word in the greek signifies to want and to pray and the same word in hebrew to repent and to comfort

be more thoughtful and careful how to use what you have to gods glory then to gain more


take heed of being humbled and yet unhumbled that is of being brought outwardly low and yet

the heart continue still high


sometimes ejaculations or short and suddain pantings and breathings out of desires to god may be more acceptable to him and more prevailing with him then long prayers

never reckon what thou hast of outward worldly things unless it be to praise god for them or to serve god better with them


it is the property of a true christian to justifie god and to judg himself

under the greatest afflictions


learn to know sin to disallow of it to dispise it to overcome it inwardly and to put it from thee to fear its return and to be more estranged toward it more watchful to avoid temptations and wise to shun occasions that lead to it


to dye should be no more to a christian then to breath or to pass over a great river on a sure bridge or in a safe boat or to return from a field where a man hath been

working to his own house to take his rest

make hast to do thy work christian and god will make hast to give thee thy wages

the hardest dutys in christianity are to deny self and to destroy sin


a heart unconverted is contented with nothing but what is helping it on to hell and it hath never enough of that to wit sin and a heart converted is never satisfied but with what helps it toward

heaven and yet thinks he hath never enough thereof to wit christ and grace


to take pains about unnecessary and unprofitable things is laboriously to mispend time

get christ christian to bind thy conscience to the peace and thy affections and flesh to the good behaviour

be not ambitious of love and greatness and thou shalt not be so soon an object of envy



he that converts a sinner covers a world or multitude of sins and gains more then a world to wit a soul jam
pro


take heed of covering any mans good with his evil but let the one plead for him as well as the other against him

one of the chiefest works of the soul is selfe examination and yet a christian will find himself most backward thereto and soonest weary therein



seasonable and unexpected mercys are very sweet and acceptable

the more a soul is exercised in spiritual meditation the less with carnal temptation and the more frequent and powerful in private prayer the more free from and the more potent against corruptions

sin was condemned by christ to save the sinner rom
oh then let not the sinner seek to save the sin to wound christ again



quick onsets and endeavours to reform are far better then many purposes and resolutions

small sins yielded to make way for greater and one sin for another

be sure to praise god when you receive power against sin and temptation and you shall be sure to find god ready to give you power another time when you want it


when and where wickedness is most then and there the godly should

strive to be most godly
it is a sign of sincerity to be good in bad times and in bad places and among bad persons as noah lot and joseph were


at the day of death but especially at the day of judgment a christian will wish he had sinned less served god and suffered for him more

if christians were not sometimes afflicted they would forget both themselves and others for affliction works humiliation in men themselves and compassion toward others



it is a hard thing for a profane man to attain the shaddow of religion or for a careless though true christian to attain the substance
and it is hard for a true christian that hath the substance to keep up the sence and savour either of the excellency of jesus or the evil of sin always in his heart


oh what time do christians mispend what duties do they neglect what mercies do they slight what corruptions do they embrace what temptations do they lie

under what corrections do they undervalue
oh what heart qualms and fleshly weaknesses cry out upon us to make ready and yet how unready how unripe how unwilling how unmindful and unthoughtful are we of our latter end and this is because we are unassured of christ unweaned from the world unweary of sin unbroken from self and unapprehensive of the glory to be revealed and enjoyed hereafter



fear thy friends more then thy foes thy sins more then thy sufferings

and liberty more then bondage


christians should not give offence carelesly nor take offence causlesly

bad times well improved are far better then good times not redeemed or mispent

it is and shall be the care of a christian not to suffer for sin nor to sin in suffering

there is no real bondage but what is either from sin or for sin



affections parts or applause from the world or from christians are very dangerous and not to be trusted in

never trusted christ but found him faithful nor my own heart but found it false

shut thy eyes from beholding thy ears from hearing and thy heart from entertaining sin


take heed of reproving or upbraiding another in passion or to provoke them thereto for tis

better be silent then sin in speaking tis better to keep thy light under a bushel then to put it into the hand of him that will blow it out or tread it under his feet


destroys and the more we loath our selves the better we love others

christians should not envy the patience of god toward their enemies for it is nothing in comparison of what grace he shows to them


of all men a christian

may be freer to lose or to part with any thing then another man for he loses nothing but what is hurtful to him to wit his sins or what he shall regain and recover of a better sort and in a more abundant degree
as if he lose a small temporal estate he hath in reversion an eternal inheritance
if he lays down a body that is full of corruption he shall have another free from corruption and therefore he may say better then the heathen could what keep lose and what give or lay out save



sins best is before but its worst is behind and the sting and tayl of it is longer then it self where sin is not killed it will kill

a christians conversation should keep from the shew of sin and his conscience from the guilt of it

the power and strength of corruption is but seldome known to wit when temptations opportunities and occasions of tryal come



the best way to keep from sin is to set god in his power purity and glory still before our eyes to fear our selves to keep near christ to fast and pray privately to engage other christians for our help to cherish the holy spirit to keep up constant practice of holiness to provide contrary means against it to resolve strongly to withstand it to eye gods promises commands and threatnings to withstand the first occasions of sin to reason it off at a distance to believe it away when it comes near

to avoid all occasions thereof and to keep on still the armour of god


christians are often apt to be most weary of that condition that doth them most good like peter not understanding what christ did in washing his feet joh


christians in and under afflictions should be growing holy and through their afflictions should be going on toward happiness affliction is part of the way of sanctification leading to salvation and it is like an leading

to an house that is on the top of an hill for so is heaven and the greatest hardship is nearest the end of the journey


they have but a slight profession whose profession doth not lead them out of sin and through sufferings he that is worse under affliction as ahar may well fuspect his own sincerity

christ will soon be sensible of those christians afflictions that are sensible of their own sins


it ought to be a great

part of a christians trouble that he can be no time what he should be that is sinless and servicable that he is not at all times what he is sometimes that is slighting sin judging himself loving christ and dispising the world greatly


it is strange and a very bad sign to see christians look more upon the sins of the wicked to ripen them for misery then to mind and holiness to ripen and fit themselves for mercy


he loves not a reprover not values his reproof never

profits thereby but is more his sins then his souls friend


tis a sign of a hard heart to desire the eternal destruction of the wicked for obtaining of their own temporal and corporal liberty safety or honour as if one should desire to have another cast into the fire and be burnt that himself may be warmed thereby

in the midst of earthly businesses the soul should redeem some special time for secret and private duties



it is the will of christ that christians should rejoyce more in what christ hath done for them then in what they have done or can do for him

christ kept the law legally christians kept it evangellically he kept it perfectly they kept it with full purpose and endeavour


ask thy soul christian whether he be willing to receive christ upon his own terms and for his own sake and to accept of pardon and life through him freely without

looking at all upon thy own righteousness
art thou contented that christ should be honoured in and by thee and that thou shouldst be despised and dishonoured for his sake


god doth never or his power truth and faithfulness

he is a strong christian that seeks gods glory more then his own salvation but he is no christian that seeks neither


it is a great ease to and an unburtherning of the

to confess sin sensibly humbly brokenly and with hatred to it


christ and sin are most magnified in the eyes of believers in their affliction but in a very different manner and to a different end for christ appears as the greatest good and sin as the greatest evil and then christ will be most desired and sin most despised
it is the duty of a christian to suspect and search himself when he doth not know evil by himself



account the least spiritual thing better then the greatest and best of outward and temporal things

keeking from sin is physick but repentance for sin is physick

strive greatly to have and excercise a good conscience toward god and men to commit thy soul life and condition to the lord and then expect the worst of men and the steb of christ


thou must die once

whether thou suffer or no and thou canst but die once if thou suffer


the sins of christians are new sufferings to christ and the sufferings of christians are wounds of christ eph
ezek

labour to act those graces chiefly that are most contrary to your mastersins


a christian may know the weight of sin by the sufferings of christ for if that strong bar of steel did bend under the weight

of our sins what shall poor weak man do who is but a reed or rush


sathan accuses god to men and men to god but christ excuses and answers all his accusations against his people

he that will not take example from others shall make an example himself

lord as a sign that shall be able to die for thee let me find my corruptions dying in me by power from thee


he that loves not christ

more then his life is like to lose christ and his life but he that loves christ more than his life will be sure to save and keep both mark

luke


christians should account restraints from sin great mercys to them but recoveries out of sin with spiritual advantage greater

sin hath no mother but a mans heart nor father but satan

satan draws the soul into it either by power or policy by force or by fraud



a christian should desire to have his heart tyed to the lord and to be strong in faith upon christ in love to christ and in resolution for him

the reason why men do not more magnifie gods grace is because they do not behold their own vileness and the reason why men do not see their own vileness more is because they do not apprehend gods goodness more clearly and fully


when a christian comes to be as weary of his sins as

of his afflictions god will certainly put an end to them


there will be a reviving of old sins if there be not effectual repentance for them and a care by faith through all duties and ordinances to get new strength against them and a constant watch kept over them

a christian comes not to know the weakness of his grace till the spirit ceases to work in and by it nor the power of his corruption till satan works therein by his temptations



it should trouble a christian much to have such graces as he receives from god beget so little good in him

the lord would soon turn from his wrath if men were turned from their wickedness

he commands most and best that commands in love humility and

the world is a great nothing deluding the bad and disturbing and distracting the good



the holy law of god teaches a man to see his own deformity and requires from a man conformity to it self

sathan works more upon men by slight then by might avoid therefore his cunning and thou wilt avoid his cruelty

he hath not learned to rule well that hath not learned to obey well

an even christian is always best



rusling and persons and professors have commonly more self then grace if any at all

the less a man strives for himself the more will christ strive for him

thoughts of our own death will much tend to deaden sin

prayer is a good preparative to suffering when christ had prayed he went out to meet judas joh



be never at peace with sin satan or christs implacable enemies

in two cases tis hard to act faith

when there is nothing sensible or visible to second and support it

when there is very much of these outward things to fill and take the senses withal

as christ was saved from death though he died heb
so are true christians when they overcome death by their resurrection through christ



learn by lighter crosses to look and prepare for heavier

as our good works and rformances should have an operation upon our souls and hearts to strengthen faith so should our weaknesses and sins to work repentance

no power can keep him in bond whom truth and innocency acquits


if thou hast faln into sin through violent temptations seek speedily for repentance for it recovery

out of it and reformation under it
if god hath kept thee from falling still fear watch pray and live by faith in christ


prepare your self for death and pull out its sting

by bewailing sins past

turning to god in time to come

purposing a new life none can dy ill that hath had a care of living well perswade your self if you live well you shall die well and if you die well doubt not but you shall have eternal happiness


wish not for a long life

so much as for a good life he hath lived long who hath lived well a short life in grace endeth in an everlasting life of glory


distrust not gods providence in any matter although you see the means wanting neither when you have them let them be reed on more then god himself but pray to him for the prosperous use of them


love all things for gods sake and god only for his own and look you make him your friend whosoever be your enemy for this you shall do if as an

obedient child you always live in the eye of your heavenly father


give no offence to any man justly whether within or without for wo to them by whom offences come

carry your self unto all so as the weak may be won the strong may be comforted and the wicked be ashamed

delight to do all the good you can to gods children and to receive all the good you can from them



think it the greatest work in the world to die well which to do you must inure your self to die before hand

by dying to your sins

learning the word of affection before it actually leave you

in your last learning of if do it willingly yea joyfully whensoever wheresoever or howsoever god shall call you

greive for nothing so much in the world as for your own sins and in them for nothing so much as for offending so loving a god



let your meat apparel and recreation be lawful needful and moderate

labour alwaies to learn to die defie the world deny the devil despise the flesh and delight your self in the lord be penitent for your sins past and present and yet despair not be strong in faith and yet presume not
desire with the great apostle to be dissolved and to be with christ with whom even in death there is life


use your life and keep

it with as much quietness as you can so that you offend not god that ease that cometh with his displeasure turneth at length to an unspeakable pain and the gain of the world with the loss of his is extream beggary and wretchedness


the greatest honour that man can give to god is to confess his truth truly and faithfully in time of trouble and affliction

it is but a folly for any one that truly professeth christ crucified to look for the love of the world



infidelity is the cause of all our misery which causeth us to fear man more then god and to esteem things present more than things to come

love is that flower which shall never fade but shall flourish more and more till it be made perfect in that place where faith and hope shall have no office but shall then fully possess that which they have so long patiently waited for in this world


after the lord hath made a christian to know

what he is in himself he will doubtless shew him comfort and declare to him what he is in jesus christ his son


the mind of man cannot be contented patiently to bear the troubles either of soul or body until it be regenerated and possessed by gods spirit

why should we christians fear death can death deprive us of christ who is all our comfort our joy and our life


let us tarry with christ

one hour in tribulation and affliction and doubtless he will keep us for ever with him in joys everlasting


patience and perseverance under great tryals are the proper notes whereby gods children are known from counterfeits they that persevere not were alwaies but hypocrites


if christ be our captain we must follow him as good souldiers if we keep company with him in afflictions we shall be re of his society in glory

if we forsake not him he will never forsake us if we confess him he will confess us if we be ashamed of him he will be ashamed of us
therefore as he forsook father heaven and all things to come to us so let us forsake all things to come to him being most sure and certain that we shall not lose thereby


afflictions are in separable but not infallible notes of salvation for none shall be saved but he must suffer afflictions but all that are afflicted shall not be saved



wealth is not the way to heaven but the contrary let all our care be how to live well and then to be sure we shall never dye poor

afflictions and sufferings are sometimes the way to glory in this world joseph had never been a courtier had he not first been a prisoner


gods children are ever the better for being miserable it is good for me that was afflicted let god use us how he will on earth so that we may have what he

hath promised to those that love him in heaven who would not be a lazarus for a day that he might sit in abrahams bosome for ever

some heavenly meditations exhortations and consolations of that blessed martyr mr john bradford and other martyrs written out of prison to several friends
to mr j.h consider what this life is consider what death is consider what is prepared for you after death


concerning this life know it is full of misery vanity and wo it is a

plain banishment and hath nothing in it that hath continuance it is therefore compared to a vapour to smoak to a shaddow yea to a warfare to a vail of misery wherein we are compassed about on every side with most fierce and fearful enemies and should we desire to dwell there should we be fond to live in this toylsome and laborious world should we wish to continue in this wretched estate should we take pleasure to remain in this dangerous condition daniels den was not so dreadful as is this dungeon we dwell in


concerning death to gods dear children what other thing is it then the dispatcher of all displeasure the end of travil the door of desires the gate of gladness the port of paradise the heaven of heaven the entiance into rest and quietness the into felicity and the beginning of all blessedness
it is a very bed of down and therefore compared to a sleep for the bodies of gods people to rest out of which they shall arise and awake most fresh and flourishing to everlasting life
it is a passage to the father a chariot to

heaven the lords messenger a leader unto christ a going to our home a deliverance from prison and bondage a dismission from war a security from all sorrow and a freedom from all misery
should we be dismay'd at it should we be afraid of it should we trouble to hear of it should such a freind as this is be unwelcome should the foulness of his face fear us from his good conditions should the hardness of his husk hinder us from his sweet kernel should the roughness of the tyde tye us to the bank and shore

should the hardness of the saddle set us on our feet to perish by the way rather then leap up and endure the same a little and so to be where we would be


concerning that which is prepared for you after death if should go about to express it the more should do so the further should be from it
for the eye hath not seen neither hath the ear heard nor is the heart of man able to conceive in any measure the joy mirth melody pleasure power wealth riches honour glory wisdom knowledge treasures security

peace quietness and eternal felicity which you shall enjoy world without end with god the father son and holy spirit
amen

wo to our blind eyes that see not this wo to the hardness of our hearts that feel not this wo to the deafness of our ears that hear not this in such manner as we should do whereby we should be so far from fearing death that we should rather wish and desire it

to the professors of the gospel by mr john bradford martyr

it is lord that have sinned against thee it is mine hypocrisie my vainglory my covetuousness my carnality security idleness unthankfulness and such like which have deserved the taking away of our king edward of thy word and true religion of thy good ministers by exile imprisonment and death it is my wickedness that causeth success and increase of

authority and peace to thy enemies

let us reprove the works of darkness let us fly from all idolatry let us abhor the antichristian and romish rotten service let us detest the popish mass and forsake their romish idol let us prepare our selves for the cross let us be obedient to all in authority in things that are not against god and his word for then answer with the apostle it is better to obey god then man

if you find and feel in your selves an hope and trust in god that he will never tempt you above

what he will make you able to bear then be assured the lord will be true to you and you shall be able to bear all afflictions but if you want this hope and confidence fly and get you hence rather then by your tarrying gods name should be dishonoured

hang on the providence of god not only when you have means to help you but also when you have no means yea when all means are against you

give god this honour which of all other things he chiefly and principally requireth at your hands namely to believe that

you are his children through christ that he is your father and god through him that he loveth you and pardoneth you all your offences that he is with you in trouble and will be with you for ever that when you fall he will put under his hand and will not let you lie long in sin

let the life you lead be in the faith of the son of god for the just doth live by faith which faith flyeth from all evil and followeth the word of god as a lanthorn to her feet and a light to her steps her eyes be above where jesus

christ is she beholdeth not things present but rather things to come she glorieth in afflictions and knoweth that the afflictions of this present life are not to be compared with that far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory which god will reveal to us and in us

now of this glory the lord grant us a lively tast here then shall we run after the scent that it sendeth forth it will make us valiant men to take to us the kingdom of god whether the lord of his mercy bring us in his good time through christ our lord

to dr by mr john bradford martyr

set before your eyes the end of this straight way rather then the narrowness of the passage so doth the husbandman in plowing and tilling the ground set before him the harvest time so doth the fisherman consider the draught of his net rather then the casting of it in
so doth the merchant the return of his merchandize and so should we in these stormy days set before us not the loss of

our goods liberty yea of our very life but the reaping time the coming of our saviour jesus christ to judgment

the more we lose here the greater joy shall we have in the world to come the more we suffer here the greater triumph shall we have there for corruptable dross we shall find incorruptable treasure for gold we shall have glory for silver we shall have solace and joy without measure for riches we shall have royal robes for earthly we shall have eternal pallaces we shall there have mirth without

measure pleasure without pain and absolute blessedness felicity and happiness without end

to certain of his faithful friends by mr john bradford martyr
yee have cause to rejoyce my dearly beloved friends in the days of tryal and confirmation in and by which god our father maketh us like to the image of jesus christ here that so we may be like unto him hereafter

for if we suffer with him we shall raign with

him if we be buried with him we shall rise with him if we are companions with him in affliction we shall rejoyce with him in glory if we sow with him in tears we shall reap with him in joy if we confess him before men he will confess us before his father in heaven if we take his part he will take ours if we loose any thing for his names sake he will give us all things for his truth and promise sake so that we ought to rejoyce and be glad for it is not given to every one to suffer loss of country life goods house and all things for the lords sake

what can god the father do more for us then to call us into the camp of his dear son what can jesus christ our saviour do more for us then to make us his warriors and fellow souldiers what can the holy ghost do to us above this then to mark us with the badg and cognisance of the lord of hosts

be of good comfort be of good comfort my dear hearts in the lord confess him and his truth and fear not the prison loss of goods or life fear rather that prison out of which there is no deliverance

fear rather the loss of those goods which last for ever fear rather the loss of that life which is eternal whereunto you are called and the way by which god will bring you to it because you know not certainly whether it will be by prison fire or halter whensoever these come let them not dismay you nor seem strange unto you for no small number of gods children are gone that way

the journey is but short though unpleasant to the flesh perchance if we should dye in our beds by a corporal malady it

would be much longer and also more painful but in gods sight it cannot be so precious and gainful as know this kind of death is

and now commend my self into the hands of my father by whose providence came into this world by whose providence have been kept in this world and by whose providence leave and depart out of this world

let us make our selves ready to ride in the fiery chariot leaving these sorry mantles and old cloaks of our carcases behind us

in ashes for a little time which god shall restore unto us again in a glorious manner

to a faithful friend of his by mr john bradford martyr
be willing to carry the cross of christ least you carry the cross of the world the flesh and the devil

one of these four crosses you must carry three of them bring to hell and therefore the greatest part go that way which is the broad way only the forth

bringeth to heaven but few go that way as well because the way is straight as also because but few walk in it how beit though it be straight it is but short and the few are many if you consider the godly as the patriarks prophets apostles martyrs and confessors and christ jesus with all his guard and train

think not scorn to come after them who are gone before you

hourly look for elias fiery chariot to come and catch me up to heaven my cloak that is my carcase shall leave behind me in ashes which doubt

not my lord will raise up and restore to me again at the last day glorified even like unto his most glorious body
that portion of the good spirit which my father hath lent me wish to be doubled yea trebled upon you all

if we suffer in the cause of christ our sufferings are but short and the time of ease to gods enemies is not long the time of our rejoycing shall be endless but the time of their torments shall be everlasting and intollerable
our breakfast is sharp but our supper will be sweet
the afflictions of this life may

not be compared in any part with the glory that shall be revealed

to his godly friends
and by mr john bradford martyr

cast your care on the lord for he careth for you and hath counted all the hairs on your head so that one shall not perish if you commit your selves to his ordering whereas else your heads and bodies yea and souls too shall perish if ye withdraw your selves as unwilling to take his

cup and to drink of it not that would have you to thrust your selves headlong or rashly to pull them upon you or that would not have you use such honest and lawful means as you may in the fear of god and with a good conscience to a void the cross and give place to evil but that would have you willingly to put forth your hand to take it when god offereth it in such a manner as with a good conscience you cannot escape then take it kiss it and thank god for it
it is a most sure sign that god loveth you as he saith whom

love chastise rev
and if ye are not partakers of correction surely ye are no children heb

but if once chastise you and ye kiss the rod verily he will cast the rod into the fire and will imbrace you and kiss you as a mother doth her child when she perceiveth it to take her correction in good part

consider not the things of this life my dearly beloved brethren which is a very prison to all gods children but the things of everlasting life which is our very home but to the believing of this you must open the eyes of your

faith as moses did who set more by trouble with gods people then by the riches of egypt and pharoahs court
your house home goods yea life and all that ever ye have god hath given you as and to admonish you of his love and to win your love to him again now he will try your love whether you set more by him then by his tokens or no
if ye for his tokens sake that is for your house home goods yea life will go with the world least you should lose them then be assured your love as he cannot but espy it to be a

strumpets love so will he reject and cast it away with the world

in another letter to the same persons by mr john bradford martyr
my dearly beloved heavy is this anger fallen upon us all doleful is this day
now hath antichrist gotten all his power again now is christs gospel trodden under foot now is gods people a division and a prey for the wicked

now is the greatest of all plagues fallen upon us

the want of gods word and all these judgments we have yea alone have justly deserved

oh that as write with my hands alone so could wish david sam

and with jonas in heart say so
but do not do not see how grievously have sinned and how great a misery is fallen upon us for my unthankfulness for gods word for mine hypocrisy in professing preaching hearing and speaking of gods word for my not praying to god for the continuance of it for my not loving it throughly as it required

oh good father it is we that have sinned and therefore deserve the taking away of thy good word it is we that have done amiss we have dealt unjustly with thy gospel we have procured thy wrath and therefore just art thou in punishing us just art thou in plaguing us for we are very miserable

but good lord and dear father of mercies whose justice is such that thou wilt not punish the poor souls of this realm which yet have not thus sinned against thee as we have done for many yet never heard thy word for

our trespasses and whose mercy is so great that thou will put our sins out of thy remembrance for thy christ sake if we believe and repent

lord let us remember that all thy dearest children have carried the cross of gracious affliction in this life in whose company thou dost place us and dost lay such a cross upon us as thou wilt make us able to bear to thy glory and our salvation in christ for whose sake we pray thee to shorten the days of this our great misery fallen upon us most justly and in the

mean season to give us patience repentance faith and thy eternal consolation amen amen amen

to mr and his wife prisoners in

have heard my good brother and sister how god hath brought you both into his of correction he say hath brought you where you are and though your reason and wit tell you it is by chance and fortune or otherwise yet my dear beloved know for certain that whatsoever was the

means god your father was the worker hereof and that for your good though it may be your old adam and poor sences may tell you otherwise yet say of a truth it is your duty to think that this cross is of gods sending and cometh from him and it is out of his love and fatherly affection for your benefit and profit sake

but here perhaps you will object what benefit what advantage can it be you are now kept in close prison your children and family are without good overseers and by this means your goods are diminished

poverty will approach and it may be more dangers also as loss of life

these you will say are no benefits but disadvantages and those no mean ones neither so that you would be glad truly to know what benefit can come to you by this cross which seemeth rather to bring you very great loss and damage
to these things answer that it is true indeed as you say of your bodies families children substance poverty life

but if you would consider

a while with inward eyes as you now behold them with outward then perhaps you would find more ease

do you not now by your inward sense perceive that you must part from all these things as well as with other worldly benesits tell me then have you not this benefit by your cross to learn to loath and leave the world and to long for and desire another world where is perpetuity and eternal happiness

you ought of your own mind and free will to have forsaken the world and all

earthly things using this world as though you used it not and having your hearts only set upon your treasures in heaaven or else you can never be christ true disciple that is to be saved and to be where he is

and think you my dear hearts in the lord think you that this is no benefit to be compelled to do thus by this cross that so you may assuredly enjoy enless glory with the lord

how doth god now as it were fatherly correct you to remember you of your former offences concerning these things and all

other your miscarriages that your repentance and remission might ensue thereupon how doth god now compel you to call upon him and to be earnest in prayer are these no benefits doth not the scripture say that god doth correct us in this world because we should not be damned with the world that god chastneth every one whom he loveth that the end of this his correction shall be joy and holiness doth not the scripture say that they are happy that suffer for righteousness sake as ye do that the glory and spirit of god

resteth upon them that as you are now made like unto christ insuffering so you shall be made like unto him in reigning doth not the scripture say you are now going the and right way to heaven my dearly beloved what greater benefit then this can a godly heart desire

the lord open our hearts to see and feel this indeed then shall we think the cross and afflictions which are the means to bring us to this to be very advantagious then shall we thank god that he would chastise us
and that we

may do this indeed my dearly beloved let us still remember that our cross comes from god and that they come from god as a father for our profit and benefit and therefore that we ought to call to mind our sins and to ask pardon for them and to look certainly for help at gods hand in his good time such help as shall make most for gods glory and for the comfort and benefit of our souls eternally

now if we do throughly believe and sensibly conceive these things then there will issue out from us hearty thanksgiving

which god requireth as a most precious sacrifice

and that we may all be thus thankful through christ let us use earnest prayer to our god and dear father begging of him to bless us keep us and comfort us under his sweet cross for ever and ever
amen amen

to mr laurence sanders by mr john bradford martyr

ah good brother that could alwaies have god his majesty mercy heaven and hell before

me then should indure as moses as seeing him that is invisible

blessed are they that die in the lord then how much more they that die for the lord
all here therefore god be praised do willingly pledg our captain christ of his cup even when he will or how he will
let us rejoice in the straight way which few find and fewer walk therein but fewest of all continue therein unto the end
doubting of gods favour is the very dungeon of dispair
who live soberly but such as are holy

once accepted and beloved of god in christ and ever beloved for whom he loveth he loveth to the end

repentance and justification is the gramar school wherein we must first be conversant and learned before we go to the university of gods most holy predestination
the pattern which we must follow is christ himself and not the multitude nor custome
in all things we must avoid the seeking of our selves as well in doing as in learning things undone

long did the lord linger

and tarry to have shewed mercy upon us but we were ever the longer the worse

he that will not have gods blessing it shall be taken from him

bishop ridly in a letter to the dispersed brethren

we never had a better or more just cause either to continue our life or shed our blood we cannot take in hand a more certain clear and manifest truth
for it is not any ceremony for which we contend but it toucheth

the very substance of our whole religion yea even christ himself

what can all their cruelty do against us but make our crowns more glorious yea beautify and multiply the same esteem nothing available for me which will not further the glory of god
whosoever knowingly neglecteth and regardeth not to keep a good conscience he cannot have peace with god nor a lively faith in his mercy

if our doctrine were once the truth of gods word do you think that the alteration and change

of the times can ever make it an untruth

let us joyn hands together in christ and if we cannot overthrow yet over power and as much as in us lies let us shake those strong holds not with carnal but with spiritual weapons
it is not the slanderers evil tongue but a mans own evil deed that can defile him before god
yours by gods grace in our master christs cause unto the stake and thenceforth without all dangeror peril for ever and ever

doctor taylor in a letter to bishop cranmer
god be praised again and again for this your excellent promotion which you are called unto at this present in that you are counted worthy to be allowed among the number of christs records and witnesses england hath had but a few learned bishops that would stick to christ so as to burn for his cause

for gods sake pray for us for we fail not daily to pray for you we are strongter and stronger in the

lord his name be praised and we doubt not but ye be so also in christ sweet school heaven is all and wholly on our side

rejoice therefore in the lord and again say rejoyce
pray for me will pray for you god be praised since my condemnation was never afraid to die

bishop hooper in a letter to certain godly persons

let us prav unto god so to furnish us with faith and patience that we may rather dye ten times then to deny him

once it is very requisite that the members of christ comfort one another make prayers together confer one with another so shall you be stronger and gods spirit shall not be absent from you but be in the midst of you to teach you to comfort you to make you wise in all godliness patient in tribulation and strong in persecution
ye see how the congregation of the wicked by helping one another make their wicked religion and themselves strong against god his truth and his people

if any smart gods people

shall be the first if any suffer shame they begin if any be subject to slander it is those that he loveth so that christ sheweth no face nor favour nor love almost in this world outwardly to them but doth as it were lay clay upon the sore eyes of those that are sorrowful yet the patient man seeth as st paul saith life hid under these miseries and adversities and light and sight hid under this foul clay

the will of our father be done in all things if he will life life be it if he will death death be it

it is a trouble to loose

the treasures of this life but yet a very great pain if they be kept with offence to god cry call pray and in christ daily require help succour mercy wisdome grace and defence that the wickedness of this world prevail not against us
we began well god preserve us to the end

this life is short and miserable happy are they that can spend it to the glory of god

we may be tempted of the world the flesh and the devil but yet although these things pinch yet they do not pierce and although they work sin in us yet in

christ no condemnation to them that are grafted in him

mr richard rooth in a letter to certain martyrs condemned at colchester

oh dear hearts in christ what a crown of glory shall ye receive with christ in the kingdome of god oh that it had been the good will of god that had been ready to have gone with you for lie in the bishops little ease in the day and in the night lie in the and we look every day when

we shall be condemned for they say shall be burned within ten days before easter but lie still at the pools brink and every one stepeth in before me but we abide patiently the lords leisure in many bonds in fetters and stocks by which we have received great joy in the lord

oh my dear hearts now shall you be cloathed with long white garments upon mount sion with the multitude of saints and with jesus christ our saviour who will never forsake us

oh blessed virgins you have played the wise virgins part because you have

taken oyl into your lamps that you may enter with the bridegroom when he cometh into everlasting joy
but as for the foolish they shall be shut out because they made not themselves ready to suffer with christ nor venture to take up his cross

how precious shall your death be in the sight of the lord dear and precious in his sight is he detah of all his saints farewell mine own dear hearts and pray the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen
pray pray pray
by me richard rooth written with my own blood

mr john philpot in a letter to mr r.h.r.g.m.h and j.c glorious is the course of the martyrs at this day never had the elect of god a better time for their glory then this is
now may they be assured under the cross that they are christs disciples for ever

many go on well till they come to the pikes and then they turn their backs and give over in the plain field to the shame of christ and his church that

hath so faint hearted souldiers in his camp at the time of need in that wherein his glory ought most manfully to be shewed

be content to have your faith tryed every day by some cross or other as it pleaseth god to put it upon you and if god put no grievous cross upon you let your brethrens cross be your cross which is a certain token of true brotherly love
hitherto we have not resisted unto our blood must not be too dear for the lord and then his kingdome shall not be too dear for us

we have taken our pressmony a great while let us now learn to serve him faithfully and not to fly out of the lords camp into the world as many do

mr john careless to several martyrs condemned to die for the truth in
so great honour is not permitted to the highest angel in heaven as to suffer for the name of christ
full glad may you be that ever god gave you a life to lose for his sake

a weak faith hath ever a cold charity annexed unto it which is quenched with every unkind word

nothing can anger the malicious mind and cankered heart of satan more then the mirth gladness and hearty rejoycing of gods children in their good christ
only christs true disciples do mourn for his absence therefore they shall doubtless rejoyce in his presence which will be so much the more joyful by how much the more his absence is sorrowful

according to your faith and as you believe so shall

it be unto you and as you think god to be unto you such a one you shall find him to be think therefore ever sweetly of the lord and of his goodness

mr john careless in a letter to mr john bradford

now with a merry heart and joyful tears take my farewel of you mine own dear brother in the lord begging him to send us shortly a joyful meeting in his kingdome that we may both sing praises together unto

him with his holy angels and blessed spirits for ever and ever

farewel thou blessed of the lord farewel in christ depart unto thy rest and pray for me for gods sake
well will hope in god and pray all night that god would send me some comfort to morrow and if the lord give you leasure to morrow let me hear four words of comfort from you for gods sake

oh that my life and a thousand such wretched lives more might go for yours
oh why doth god suffer me and such other poor worms to live that

can do nothing but consume the alms of the church and yet take you away so worthy a and labourer in the lords vineyard

but wo be to our sins and great unthankfulness which is the cause of taking away of such instruments of the lord as should set forth his glory and instruct his people if we had been thankful to god for the good ministers of his word we had not been so soon deprived of them the lord forgive our great ingratitude and his and give us true repentance and faith and

stretch forth his hand of mercy over us for his dear son christ his sake take not away all thy true preachers out of this realm lord but leave us a seed least england be made as sodom and gomorrah when thy true lots are removed and gone

but why go about to mingle your mirth with my mourning your just joy with my deserved sorrow if loved you as pretended should surely rejoice with you most hartily and praise god from the very bottom of my heart should praise god night and day for your excellent

election in and through his great mercy

should give him most humble thanks for your vocation by his gospel and your true knowledg in the same
should earnestly praise him for your sweet justification whereof you are most certain by gods grace and spirit should earnestly pray to him for your glorification which shall shortly ensue

should rejoice and be glad to see you dignified by the crown of martyrdome and to be appointed to that honour to testifie his truth and to seal it

with your blood

should highly extol the lord who hath given you a glorious victory over all your enemies visible and invisible and hath given you grace and strength to finish your course as you have begun
oh that the time were now come that might put off this frail tabernacle of the flesh in this heavenly security quietness of conscience in jesus christ
yours for ever in the lord jesus john careless living in hope against hope

mr john careless to mr philpot
my dearly beloved brother god hath brought you into a straight place out of your pinching and painful seat in prison you have plentifully poured upon me your precious oyntment the sweet savour whereof hath greatly refreshed my faint and tired soul
ah good jeremiah hath pashur put thee in the stocks why now thou hast the reward of a prophet thy glory never began to appear until now

oh good mr philpot which art a principle pot indeed filled with most precious liquor as appeareth by thy plenteous pouring out of the same pot most happy ordained to honour by the high potter thou dost contain heavenly treasure in thy earthen vessel
oh pot thrice happy in whom christ hath wrought a great miracle altering thy nature and turning water into wine and that of the best out of whom the master of the feast hath filled my cup so full that am even overcome in joy of the spirit through the same

be not offended dear heart at my metaphorical speech for am disposed to be merry and with david to dance before the ark of the lord and though you play on a painful pair of organs the stocks not very comly nor easie to the flesh yet the sweet sound that came from thence to me from you causeth me thus to speak

oh that were with you in the body as am present in spirit that might sing all care away in christ jesus our blessed saviour and redeemer from all trouble for now the time of comfort is come

mr laurence sanders in a letter to the true professors of the gospel

my dear friends in the lord the times are perilous and dangerous we must therefore be circumspect and not solace delight our selves in carnal security but with a joyful and contented mind we must now venture into the ship of christs cross and afflictions and now let us seriously weigh and consider all the perils dangers and hazards that we must expect to meet

in our journey to our heavenly countrey yet let us account it comfort enough in this dangerous voyage that we have the company and fellowship of such an adventurer as our blessed lord jesus to go along with us when he was once in the ship with his disciples with his word he did asswage the swelling of the dangerous seas and he hath not left us alone in this ship either to sink or to swim but will be awaked if he be call'd upon by importunate prayer

epigraph mat
come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden and will give you rest

soul
come unto me what voice is this here

iesus
it is the sweet voice of thy saviour dear he calleth labouring sinners to him flee he calleth laden sinners such as thee
he calleth sinners bids them come away he calleth all oh why then shouldst thou stay he calleth such as by sin are undone he calleth thee therefore unto him run

soul
but how should come to thee blessed lord sin is the only thing by thee abhord

and am nothing else but sin and thou

wilt not of sin of the least sin allow besides thou art in heaven and how shall reach unto thee thou art above the sky and poor creature grovling on the earth the mold from which at first came by birth

iesus
remember soul my blessed word that saith that coming to me is alone by faith

soul
thou lord that puttest faith into mans heart

bestow on me that gift to me impart

such other graces as may let me see my want of christ that may come to thee
my sins thou know'st a heavy burden are a load that is too big for me to bear
no slave that's under turkish tyranny is under such sad bondage as am
but it is unto thee christ come believing in thee oh make me a room within thy arms take me into thy heart

and since my faith is weak strong faith impart

iesus
poor soul take comfort though thy faith be small a grain of mustard seed's smallest of all
yet of mustard seeds of faith allow so that thy soul unto my scepter bow
nay of one grain a wonder let it be to thy poor soul that such love is in me that accept of faith even of the least that receive so poor so vile a guest as wretched man who nothing hath to bring

to make him acceptable but his sin

soul
blessed jesus mount me on the wing of holy faith let me not feel the sting of conscience but let me answer all that believed and went at christ his call
my saviour call'd and unto him went he gave me faith and helpt me to repent
come with sorrow that sinned have come with faith that thou my soul wilt save
it is but weak lord must confess

it is a feeble hand yet ne're the less

it is the hand of faith and it is true it lays holds on thee claiming but its due and that is rest which thou hast promised me and my poor soul is restless till with thee
rest is that good all creatures do desire rest is that good to which all saints aspire
if th bodies resting after labour be so sweet so pleasant as we know and see then what is it to have the soul to rest

in the enjoyment of a god still blest

from thee is all the rest for which look for it is written in thy sacred book that those that cast and roul themselves on thee thou wilt receive lord receive thou me
for still this prayer will pray though brief lord believe lord help my unbelief
thou art now mine by faith thine by love from this perswasion let me never move

epigraph oh that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes psal


that could stand firm at last and not be reeling too and fro that could my god hold fast and never never let him go


how often do go astray and leave my rest my wonted bliss

like a lost sheep in the

which dangerous and barren is


have no pleasure in my sin and yet act it o're and o're i'm still the same that have been though fain would be so no more


long to keep the law of god but still break it to my pain my stomach serves to take that food

but straight cast it up again


my god take me unto thee with fire hot zeal melt thou my heart that now may newmoulded be and made sound in my better part


lord lead me by thy grace that may never wander from thee more thou art my life cannot die thou art my all can't be poor

epigraph see another law in my members warring against the law of my mind rom

wretch that am my wishes are my pain two laws so different rend my heart in twain
my heart divided bleeds in either part offending either law i'm sure to smart inslav'd to sin i'm forc'd to bear this yoke
kiss the rod ev'n whilst feel the stroak
the ingrateful serpent in my brest warm

how drink poyson and imbrace my harm

my pleasure is my trouble and the heat of fond desire what is't but a cold sweat alas i'm taken with the baits of sin those corrupt joyes but feed the worm within triumph when my heart me pris'ner takes my minde is griev'd thus at the spoil it makes
jesus for me wounded see my wound give me thy bruises that may be sound with thy blood wash my heart in blood imbru'd give me that peace which may this war conclude

epigraph help thou my unbelief mark

help master of my faith i'm forc't to wink at this bright truth in these great depths sink tis beyond my reach cannot tread nor can swim unless thou hold my head my reasons at a stand thus are thy ways past finding out how dazling are thy rays sun of righteousness to humane sight thou art so glorious can't see for light

my joys are chang'd to doubts and fears which roul

like stormy billows in my wavering soul shine forth my son amidst these showers of tears let thy clear beams pierce through these cloud of fears
shew me thy hidden mauna angels food long to tast and see that thou art good
i'm come to see the lord though vile and poor let me in i'le die else at thy door
oh lord restore me to thy grace hope thou dost but hide thy face

jesus do but look on me

like peter i'le weep bitterly
by thy bright face shew me my stain i'le pour forth tears to wash it clean
hope the day will come again anon the sun of righteousness is set not gone

having the loyns of your mind girded

there is a god my soul how durst thou stray thou'lt meet his vengeance if thou go this way
return return lo this path seems too broad here many go the way to heaven's no road
my soul put on thy garments gird them fast twill make thee comely thus to go
and now am resolv'd in spight of hell and my false heart i'ie still strive to do well

in all my warfare i'le hold fast my shield

then satan do thy worst i'le win the field

a farewel to the world


world farewel farewel find thee too unkind
took thee for a friend did love to play with thee all day
but thou didst cheat me still to my shame lost every game
thy stakes were pleasures and deceitful toies

mine were true coyn full weight large solid joys


now thou hast got all that had see thou slightest me
thou used'st to imbrace me kindly and give me thy hand
with many promises of love but lo thou art my foe
though all my serious thoughts and company fool that was left to follow thee


but i'le return to them again i'le rome no more from home

the mind that stays within shall ne're complain of wind or rain

of care or greif for storms shake only breasts that seek their rests without doors where is nought but toile as though to be kept warm they'd lie in beds of snow


great god leave the world and come to thee open to me call let me find thy throne of grace seek thy face i'le die to sin put off myself and then be born agen

christs blood shall be my life the word that can

call up the dead is breath to the new man

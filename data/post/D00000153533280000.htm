unjust weights and unjust measures both these are abomination to the lord vers
printed in the year
the line of righteousness and justice stretched forth over all merchants
all friends every where live in the seed of god which is the righteousness it self and inherits the wisdom and is the wisdom it self with which wisdom ye may order rule and govern all things which be under your hands which god hath given you to his glory govern and order with his wisdom all the creatures that you have under you and all exchangings merchandizing husbandry do what you do in the wisdom of god and with it which is pure from above and gentle and easie to be entreated vvith this vvisdom which is not earthly sensual nor devilish you do good unto all and hurt no one nor your self for it is pure and preserves pure

so this is the word of the lord god to you all keep all in the power of god over all the unrighteous world which power of god was before it was in which power of god you will be preserved in justice in truth in equal ballance and vveights and measures in the truth uprightness and honesty to all people
so all here in this are serviceable to god in their generation and to the creation and to god and it a blessing
do rightly that is the vvord of the lord god to you all whether ye be of what calling or profession or sort soever or husbandmen do

rightly justly truly holily equally to all people in all things and that is according to that of god in every man and the witness of god the wisdom of god and the life of god in your selves and there you are serviceable in your generation labouring in the thing that is good which doth not spoil nor destroy nor waste the creation upon the lusts

and all merchants whatsoever and traffickers by sea or land this is the word of the lord god to you all do justly speak truly to all people whatsoever then are ye a dread and a terror to the unjust vvrong no man no man if it may be never so much to your advantage but be plain righteous and holy in this are you serviceable to your own nation and others by your change and exchanging of things and merchandize and to the lord god ye come to be a blessing in the creation and generation
live in the life of truth and let the truth speak in all things and let righteousness and justice be acted and holiness in all things without any guile fraud or deceit and so that is to god and men and according to that of god in every one and this sheweth forth the fruits of believers that are passed from death to life from death which came by sin the original of which is the devil
so being come from death to life which goes over him over him say who is the author of all unrighteousness now in the truth and righteousness you will all have peace favour and the blessing of the lord in all things and that keepeth out the covetous mind and covetous desires the power and life of god that goes over the power of death which brought the sin that which keepeth over this hath the blessing and the enercase of the heavenly riches and that shall not want the creatures nor any good thing from them the lord will not withhold
so be careful to do good in all things to all people whatsoever in the fear of god serve him and be dilligent and not stubborn in any thing but pliable in the power of god that keeps you over all the power of unrighteousness acting so in that that ye may be a good savour in all nations slands and places where you come in the hearts of all people doing truly plainly uprightly faithfully justly and honestly according to the light of christ jesus in every man that that you may witness all then will your words lives and conversations preach and manifest that ye serve

god in the new life and that ye have put off the and his deeds which are unrighteous and that ye have put on the new man which is after god in righteousness and holiness according to his image
loathe deceit and unrighteousness wronging cozening cheating or unjust dealing but live and reign in the righteous life and power of god and vvisdom that presses all the other down to answer the good and just principle in all people and that will win people to deal with you doing truth to all without respect to persons to high or low whatsoever young or old rich or poor and so here your lives and vvords will preach you come
all and dealers about husbandry whatsoever cattle or ground to you all this is the vvord of the lord god do rightly holily justly honestly plainly and truly to all men and people whomsoever you have to deal withall wrong not any in any cae though it be never so to your advantage deny your selves and live in the cross of christ the power of god for that destroyes injustice and without holiness none can ever see the lord and out of righteousness there is no true peace therefore all of what sort sover or what calling soever do justly whether ye be masters or servants fathers or mothers sons or daughters to one another and to all do that which is just and righteous uprightly and holily in that you will have peace and see god

so in all husbandry speak truth act truth doing justly and uprightly in all your actions in all your pratices in all your vvords in all your dealings buyings sellings changings and commerce with people let truth be the head and practice it and in all your vvords let truth be spoken this brings rightousness forth and deceit to the judgment bar
vvrong no man nor covet nor cheat nor oppress nor defraud any man in any case but keep your dominion in the truth in righteousness holiness and equity in the power and light and vvisdom of christ in this you answer the light of christ in every one and are a blessing to the lord god and to your generation you are serviceable and come to walk in the new life in which the righteous holy god is served in which righteousness ye have peace

and in which holiness ye see god for the kingdom of god stands in righteousness peace and joy in the holy ghost
so speak the truth whether merchants or trades men and all sorts of people whatsoever in all your occasions and in all your tradings dealings and doings speak the truth act in the truth and walk in the truth and this brings righteousness forth for it answereth the vvitness of god in every one which lets every one see all the deeds and actions they have done amiss and vvords which they have spoken amiss so the vvitness of god within them ariseth a swift vvitness against them for their vvords which they have spoken amiss and for teir actions which they have done amiss and brings them to the judgment bar and to condemnation
here righteousness goes forth and here the sweet savour to the lord god begins to ascend and truth and equity ariseth both to be acted and spoken

so ye all friends of what calling soever that dwell in the power of god and feel the power of god and the light of christ jesus dwell in that act in that that ye may answer that of god in every one upon the earth with your actions and by your conversations and by your vvords being right just and true this goes over the unjust untrue unholy and unrighteous in all the whole vvorld and reacheth to the good and true principle of god in all people which tells them when they do not do equally justly righteously and holily so that is the vvord of god to you all friends of what calling soever ye be live in the power of truth and vvisdom of god to answer the just principle of god in all people upon the earth and so ye answering of it thereby ye come to be as a city set upon a hill which is above that mountain that is in the whole vvorld that lies above the just principle of god in every one there which the power of god goes over so let your lives preach let your light shine that your vvorks may be seen that your father may be glorified that your fruits may be unto holiness and that your end may be everlasting life
dwell in the power of the lord god and light and life with which ye may feel and see before the unrighteousness was in this you will know the everlasting righteousness brought forth which answereth the righteous principle of god in every one to which they must come down to lead them and guide them to teach

them to speak and act truth justly righteously and holily and that hath the dominion which doth justly holily and righteously speak act and think and this hath the praise of god and they who do so come to answer what god requires to love mercy do justly and to walk humbly with god
and this is more then all the talkers of justice righteousness and holiness whose life denyes what their tongues profess and talk of by that god and christ is dishonoured so these are no good example neither serviceable in their generation nor creation nor any but them who live in the power of god and in his vvisdom in which they have the righteousness peace truth holiness justice and equity this is comely and avourable both to god and man
and all of what trade or calling soever keep out of debts owe to no man any thing but love go not beyond your estate lest you bring your selves to trouble and cumber and a snare keep low and down in all things you act for a man that would be great and goes beyond his estate lifts himself up runs into debts and lives highly of other mens means he is a vvaster of other mens and a destroyer he is not serviceable to the creation but a destroyer of the creation and creatures and cumbreth himself and troubleth others and is lifted up who would appear to be some body but being from the honest the just and good falls into the shame therefore dwell every one of you under your own vine that know redemption from the earth and seek not to be great but in that and dwell in the truth justice righteousness and holiness and there is the blessing enlarged

and no one of what calling soever run into debt uury and exaction for many people have been wronged thereby they that have taken of them who by it have appeared great and lived above what they were and so would seem to be therefore be true and honest holy and righteous every one in that which ye have owe to none any thing but love and in that ye will feel the blessing and come to be serviceable in the creation serving one another in love and not in oppression or taxation and that keeps all down in the power vvisdom and life of god and bends all minds to strive for one anothers good and to help one another in that which is good just and righteous and serve one another in that in that you live in the life and in the seed the power

and righteousness that is everlasting which is of god and his vvisdom through which ye come to answer the good just and holy principle of god in every one upon the earth in which power ye have dominion in which ye come to live the life that is to god and life which shall stand when the world is ended and in this life power and vvisdom of god that is endless you are a terror to all that be in the vvisdom below you are a terror to all that be in the unrighteous actions and vvords and you are a terror to all that be in the unjust and unequal doings and all the defrauders cozeners cheaters lyers and wrong dealers in the power of god and his life in which ye have justice ye have truth ye have equity ye have righteousness and it cometh to be in you as natural your words your lives your conversations your presence and your practices both judge and preach and you are a terror to all men in the just life and everlasting righteousness christ jesus living in him and in his wisdom and walking in him and speaking the truth as it is in him in all things your lives and your words are a terror to all that speak not truth in your dealings and to all that act not truly and righteously in their doings your lives do judge them and are a judge to them and through your constancy faithfulness and life which is everlasting you bring many to amendment for both life actions words and conversation preach all these preach to the unrighteous world being in the everlasting righteousness which over the world hath dominion through which life power seed of god and wisdom you reach and answer the good and just principle of god in every one and it you will make at last to confess you though they may go on in the contrary for a time
so in that power wisdom and dominion and strength that gives you dominion over all and to answer that of god in all in the love and power of the lord jesus christ preserve and keep you all in his wisdom life seed and dominion that to him you may be a blessing and a good savour in the hearts of all people and let all yor actions and words be one with the vvitness of god in all people amen

the vvicked and unrighteous ow envy and hatred and with that they pay their debt but the righteous just and harmless

who owe nothing to any man but love with that they pay their debt but drunkards adulterers swearers rioters who eat and drink and rise up to play and live in pleasures wantonly upon the earth fighters quarrellers envious malitious unjust unrighteous all such actions and practice judge out of the power of god and out of his kingdom
all friends every where that be or merchants or factors or any other trades keep low in the power of god and do not go into things beyond your capacity nor reach after things more then ye can justly perform and answer all men but all in your places be just and true that ye may answer all men within and without with truth and justice in your returns that you may keep your words so say and so do which is the royal law of liberty in all your tradings else you are a dishonour to christianity
therefore your business that what you do and what you say you may perform that you may not break your words and promises for if you do ye go to loss neither are ye masters of what ye take in hand for a master should be a top of things and be in that which can command things

and none to be negligent in their business but give an account by words or writings how things are with them when others write to them so that none may wrong one another in these outward things nor oppress one another but be serviceable one to another keeping their words their going into things beyond their ability makes them break their words keeping within their compass with that which they may answer lest any be lifted up for it is a bad thing to be lifted up and

to make a noise and a shew for a time with other peoples goods and cannot keep their word their promise their day such may be lifted up for a time and break and fall and go out as a stink and bring a great dishonour to christ and true christians and therefore keeping your word your day and keeping your just measure your just weight that keeps down the oppression and by that just measure and weight and your word and day by the power of god and his spirit in your own hearts and there the blessing is doubled there you come to be rich and you are a good savour to god and in the hearts of all people
so every one strive to be rich in the life and kingdom and things of the world that hath no end for he that covets to be rich in the things of this world falls into many snares and hurtful lusts
and therefore let him that buyes or sells or possesses or uses this world be as if he did not let them be masters over the world in the power and spirit of god and let them know that to owe no man nothing but love yet serve god in truth and one another in their generation

for friends if you be not faithful in the outward treasure outward mammon who will trust you with the true treasure or who can believe that ye have the true treasure but that you speak by of it so say to you all see that you are faithful in this outward mammon this outward treasure of the things of this life of this world faithful to your word faithful to your dayes faithful to your promises in all your tradings traffickings bargainings true and just and righteous and honest in these outward treasures or mammon concerning the things of this world of this life of these outward riches just and faithful true and honest

men and women in these outward things say as christ saith who will trust you with the true and heavenly treasure if not as before therefore say to be faithful in these outwards that shews an honest man and honest woman faithful in all your dealings and practices between man and man and woman and woman that sheweth an honest heart and a faithful man and woman in outward things that answers the faithful principle in all people
so all men and women to be faithful in these outward things one to another that shews the good heart to receive the true treasure that you may be faithful in it to god who have been faithful in their outward treasure or mammon one to another
so let every ones conversation be without covetousness let not that be once named among saints and do to all men as you would have them do to you that is the law and the prophets if not judged by them for the kingdom stands in righteousness mark stands in it and in peace and joy in the holy ghost mark in it
postscript

holiness becomes the house of god whosoever acts unholily it is that doth dishonour his house and doth not become it whosoever acts unfaithfully in this outward treasure or mammon or in the true treasure to god is not justified in the sight of god nor man for they are justified by faith through faithfulness both of god and man for whosoever doth righteousness is of god and he that doth not righteousness is not of

god for god loveth the righteous and delighteth in them but not in them that do unrighteousness for in the righteousness they have peace but out of righteousness people have trouble
so all god's people his children his saints must be holy as he is holy and therefore do that which is holy and just in all your lives conversations and whatsoever ye do let it be done to the praise and glory of god mark that have god's praise and glory in your eye in all your speakings and doings then you will be preserved to his glory and then you will honour him and they that honour him he will honour and beautifie and cloathe with the fine linnen the righteousness of christ that men may not see your nakedness for god will have a holy people to serve him in holiness a true people to serve him in truth and in his spirit and in his new and living way above all the dead wayes that are come by sin and unrighteousness and transgression of his spirit power and command
so all you that know his power and spirit live in it that you may glorifie god in all your lives and conversations and words that you may answer that of god in all that you may glorifie god in your bodies souls and spirits which are his who hath made them and gives them to you for that end to whom be glory and honour forever who created all for his glory and for his honour
so the lord god almighty keep and preserve you faithful in all things to his glory and honor forever


let this be read in all the men and vvomen's meetings

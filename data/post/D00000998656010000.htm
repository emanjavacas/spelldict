a duell between a iesuite and a dominican begun at paris gallantly fought at madrid and victoriously ended at london upon fryday the day of may anno dom
by thomas gage alias the english american now preacher of the word at deal in kent

curteous reader

the cause of my being at present at london requiring some satisfaction and just vindication thought fit to set my self in the publick view of my country and once more to appear with the poor and beggerly cloak of my former american stile
the object of my discourse being a jesuite and a dominican both professours of a sole religion my pen shall drop before thee a dream the relation whereof may peradventure delight the sense and fancy of some and from thence get further into the hearts of some others now holding the stern of the ship of this
it is a most true and well experienced saying that odia religionum sunt acerbissima and may be instanced both at home and a broad but especially between the jesuites and dominicans both clothed with outward weeds of dissembled mortification but both inwardly lupi rapaces ravening wolves with sharp teeth of passion biting and

devouring one anotherÂ· this passion begun with the birth of ignatius founder of the jesuites order a fiery birth seconded speedily with a fiery name what else signifieth ignatius but igninatus born for fire of mischief and sedition this fire began to burn at paris and with it that ever since lasting quarrell between the ignatians now jesuites and the dominicans
there it was that ignatius like a cobler beyond his last took upon him to soar above his reach and to search into the mystery of the blessed trinity which proving too hard for his weak brain brought him to a publike censure and judgement for his speedy triall the dominicans being the grand inquisitors of the inquisition court were nominated judges who finding ignatius too saucy with the secret trinity of one glorious and immortal god and traducing it with blasphemous and erroneous principles condemned him to a publike punishment no less then whipping
lashes they were that did not only gall ignatius his back but ever since have caused lashing and clashing between ignatius his children and the dominican whippers
and if ignatius his name betray his fire stil blown and further kindled in most parts of the world by his train of jesuites so likewise doe the dominicans in their legend confession acknowledge fire to be blown by them who boast that when their founder dominick was born his mother saw in a dream stand by her a dog with a lighted torch in his mouth and a globe which if true may better signifie that he and his children also should kindle fire of rebellion and sedition in the world then what they most foolishly fancy upon it
thus gentle reader if you please you may take notice of these two fiery brands of christendome the ignatian jesuite and the barking and biting dog with fire in his mouth the dominican
but as two laid together upon one hearth strive with the fire that is in them not only to burn what comes neer or is laid upon them but further are active in burning and consuming each other
even so where ever these two the jesuite and dominican do meet they according to their from hell infused activity indeavour to kindle not only the fire of discord and rebellion in the or kingdomes where they live but also burning passionately each against the other doe indeavour like one to consume the other
oh how did ignatius his fire with a violent flame about the yeere run in spain over all the houses and cloisters of the dominicans

who by the jesuites then were so prosecuted that with weapons they were forced to defend their lives in their cloisters against the fury of the common people stirred up against them by the fiery jesuites and were like to bee banished that kings dominions for heresie imputed to them because against the ignatians and suarez his crew they held that mary christs mother was conceived in sin and not like jeremy sanctified in her mothers womb
tedious might be in relating their clashings in china iapan in rome yea and in england but must make hast to madrid and from thence give thee reader intelligence of a single combate or duel fought before the king and his court in the kings chappel between florentia a grand jesuite and domingo de torres a dominican both chaplains to that majesty when my self was living in valladolid in spain
florentia envying the dominicans fortune honor who by the laws sof arragon are constant confessours to the kings of spain and ambitious of that place himself thought if he could any wayes banish them from the court of heaven he might soon cause them to be banished from the court of madrid and from hearing that majesties confessions
whereupon he plotted a feigned dream and sleep that should befall him in the pulpit ready to preach before his majesty and his nobles
up to the pulpit he goes to act in publike his secretly contrived plot before the naming of his text hee faineth a sleep resting upon his hand and elbow the court being for a while in suspension wondring what had befallen the sleepy and drowsie jesuite at last he awakes with a dissembled amazement and craving pardon of his majesty relates his dream as followeth
sacred majesty being in a sleep have dreamed that was in heaven wel said jesuite thou mayst dream of heaven that is all thou art like to have and there saw the glory of all the saints and among them herme negildus and many other kings of spain with philip your father whose glory may be your majesties incouragement saw also of all religious orders some but above all ignatius was most glorious with his train of saints but prying earnestly amongst them and casting a carefull eye about all the corners of that capacious court could see no dominican saint which hath made me judge that surely their lives here upon earth are unworthy of eternall life in glory and that their ambition to be great here especially about your majesty is cause of their losse of any greatnesse hereafter in heaven
thus having

with a lying dream unthroned all dominicans from seats in glory who doubtlesse without a lye may be said to have none there and banished them that court hoping to work a banishment of them from the heart and affections of his majesty and his nobles he went on to his text suiting his discourse with his faigned dream fancy
but the dominicans hearing of this jesuiticall plot against them made choice of one of their best champions by name domingo de torres who might enter into duell with florentia having goliah defied the host of the guzman or dominican families
therefore upon the next domingo de torres being appointed to preach in the kings chappell no sooner gets up into the pulpit but like as florentia before he fals a sleep for a small time and dreams
but awaking out of a dissembled slumber before any choice of text was made he relates unto his majesty his dream thus
may it please your majesty this place as it breeds too much sleep and dulnesse in the hearers of our sermons which therefore work so little upon their hearts so it seems the preachers themselves are here subject to slumbering yea and to dreaming as hath appeared in father florentia and now again in my selfe who have dreamed that saw hell opened before me and that by some chief devils was carried about all the corners thereof where saw many kings damned for their wicked lives unjust commands and tyrannizing power over their subjects whose damnation hope will prove a terrour to your majesty from acting like them there also saw some who have bin of yours of your fathers councell yea let flattering of princes be far from my mouth dreamed that neer unto the gates of hell saw a coach driving furiously and in it your majesty with many of your nobles here present that the count of olivares did drive the coach
hope it will but prove a dream and that none about your majesty will for the time to come drive your soule by wicked counsels to that dismall house of darknesse and eternall ruine
further saw many fryers of mine own order damned yea of all other orders with them beside bishops abbots prelates and many priests for lewd and carnall lives yet must confesse that in all the places had gone through saw not one jesuite which made me wonder that they all should live so holily that none of them should goe to hell
but being at the gates ready to come out demanded of some chief devils whither they had no jesuites

in their dark and horrid dungeons and unto me they replyed they had more of them then of any other orders and that if would goe back should see the place and number of them
went back and at the furthest part of hell was shewed unto me a wel covered with a stone of a vast and mighty bignesse and for the taking of it up legions of divels were gathered together the well being opened saw a bottomless pit burning with fire and brimstone wherein were thousand thousands of jesuites and further demanding why they were kept in hell by themselves under more restraint of so waighty a stone then others
answer was made by some chief devils that they feared the jesuites power and liberty more then all others and that as in the world where they have power they are masters of kings people and laws to subvert and ruine all so if they should in hell give jesuites liberty not keep them under great restraint they would there also become masters and as in the world they rule by breeding rebellion and sedition so if power and liberty were given to them in hell they would to eternally racking torments adde a further fire of mutiny faction and sedition
thus much affrighted with the sight of so many damned jesuites fearing they should rise up and master all hell before the well were covered again made hast to depart
was not far gone out when like as father florentia in the way saw heaven also opened and looking carefully where the dominicans were that could not be seen by florentia in his dream saw that at the furthest part of heaven they were hid under our ladies mantle and that as in the world they serve her most so in heaven they have protection under her glorious garment and mantle
thus torres having delivered his dream freely went on to preach suitably against the jesuites over ruling power in states courts or kingdomes
the duell being ended between these two dissembling dreamers the event followed that torres was promoted to the archbishoprick of saint foy in the and florentia his ambitious thoughts with other his brethren were stopped and with great care and vigilancy their too great power prevented and weakned
thus gentle reader with dreams have pleased thy fancy indeed they were dreams but according to my true and faithfull relation they were really acted before the king and court of spain let them therefore enter beyond our fancy to work a horrid detestation of such

dissemblers and dreamers amongst us that our nation and people may not be deluded with doctrine of mantles in heaven nor our state and subverted with indulgence of power and liberty to them to whom devils according to torres his dream dare not indulge too much command and power in hell
but lastly reader must shew thee a further foil and fall of a jesuite in our city of london and so give satisfaction to some of my present being here because my coming out of the country hath been misconstrued by some who will not know that high powers have commanded me up and by those that know it aspersions have been laid upon me that for delinquency and siding with some gentlemen in kent now prisoners in london by warrant from high powers was commanded to come and answer for some misdemeanors against the present government
know therefore that upon the second of february
at the marques of winchester his house in coven garden was apprehended a jesuite by name peter wright alias bele and for high treason committed to newgate whither also was transported from the clink one thomas dade a long time prisoner upon suspition of being superiour of all the dominican fryers in england
these men being to be tryed at the sessions and generall gaol delivery holden at the old baily upon the

and
day of this present month of may and the right honorable henry rolle lord chief justice of england and member of the right honourable councell of state being informed that was able upon oath to give in evidence against both the iesuite and the dominican by his warrant commanded me up from deal in kent the place of my abode
in obedience unto which order came up having no thought of peter wright the iesuite but confident that with safe conscience could give evidence against thomas dade as a fryer and superior of the dominicans for that he was formerly mine own superiour when professed obedience to those superstitious wayes and particularly to the order of the dominicans
being come to town began to weigh with my self the danger on the one side might be in by reason of the bloudy tenents of popish enemies and the greatnesse of the marquesse his friends whose cause must needs bee published with the publike triall of his priest
on the other side weighed the service of my country and the state whose bread eat and whose protection enjoy and resolved that no danger could be

great that should undergoe nor death more glorious the what should suffer for the of england as now setled by authority of this present parliament
being therefore commanded by my lord chief justice of england in company of mr clark of the warrants and others to visit first in peter wright and thomas dade with other prisoners there in hold to see if did know them was by words uncivilly entertained by them whose tender mercies would prove cruelties against me if they could with advantage finde me here or beyond sea catch me within the command of their tyrannical court of inquisition instituted by the bloudy men of belial the dominicans
thomas dade found to be indeed the same man that he was indited for superior of the dominicans who also had formerly owned me when a dominican for his inferiour and had exercised authority over me
peter wright found to be a grand jesuite formerly chaplain to colonel gage my brother and to his regiment in flanders who from thence came over with him to oxford took up armes with him against the parliament of england whom had often seen say masse in and about gant in flanders where out of a deadly inbred spite against dominicans he was a meanes to cast out of my brothers regiment one peter martyr alias craft a fryer of that order
this man was actually chaplaine and heard confessions of the papist souldiers and commanders when one captaine vincent burton of the same regiment harboured satanicall thoughts of murthering my person and with such base continued thoughts no doubt but formerly confessed came from flanders into england where hee indevoured an assault upon my lodging and murther upon my body but by the watching providence of god was prevented and himselfe escaped
the dominican pleaded for mercy and found it the evidence not being very strong to prove orders or masse saying but onely to prove him a fryer with command in england over that order
the jesuite having nothing to say against strong evidence was cast and condemned and so let ever justice and righteousnesse spring forth and flourish in the state and of england so let men of belial be destroyed shebaes cast over the wall zimries and cozbies be slain and no doubt but the plague will cease
now gentle reader if after this my publike service any untimely or violent death or mischiefe shall befall me here in town or in my

return to kent or any time hereafter desire thee from this my declaration to take notice that through spite malice hatred and envious contrivances of bloud thirsty enemies have been butchered and by their butchering of me a doore hath beene opened unto me to let me goe through a dark and dismall entry into a glorious place of rest which doubt not but that shall enjoy it when once have finished my course and fought a good fight as faithfull to the lamb against all antichristian abettors and so take leave of thee well affected reader with the angels carroll and doxology glory to god on high on earth peace and good will towards men especially in mine and this states enemies that they may learn with good will and affection better to affect those that seek the glory of god the kingdome of christ here the inward peace of god and their consciences

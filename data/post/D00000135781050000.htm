neither the seeming unsuitableness of the text nor the real defects of the sermon the marks of a hasty composure have deterr'd me from venturing it abroad for hope my design will be approv'd by all good men who will grant it to be a seasonable office to the duty of imitating the piety of our deceased queen whole death is an unspeakable loss to this age but twill be much dangerous if she who was greater than the queen of the sou shall rise up in the judgment th this generation and condemn it because her christian vertues were not followed

of remembrance and imitation of deceased holy rulers
epigraph

heb xiii
remember them which have the rule over you who have spoken to you the word of god whose faith follow considering the end of their conversation

the death and funeral of the meanest person carry most useful instruction in em every house of mourning is a school which god doth open and where he teacheth most profitable lessons which all the living are obliged to lay to heart
for which reason the royal preacher hath affirm'd against the common opinion that tis better to go to the house of mourning then to the house of feasting eccles

but

at this time the providence of god calls us to a house of mourning that hath most extraordinary characters all things consider'd it may truly be said that in several ages there hath not been such a funeral as that which is celebrated this day
speak this not with respect to the ceremonies and magnificence of it which are very extraordinary but on the account of its sorrowful and sadning circumstances for not only a royal and crowned head is laid in the dust but a religious and holy ruler is removed out of the world a queen whom the grace and spirit of god adorn'd with a far richer and more glorious crown than that of the finest gold
so that she was the flower of princes the glory of her order and the great ornament of her age and nation

such a treasure the righteous offended god hath taken away from this world which was not worthy of it and if ever a pompous and magnificent funeral was due to any it is to her and perhaps few deceased princes have been attended to their sepulchres with such marks of highest honour which is pay'd to her not only throughout her own kingdoms but also in these provinces which did enjoy her happy influence and therefore can understand how justly she deserves the most mournful and magnificent obsequies
but it will be granted that the most pompous funeral can't do any advantage unto her who

can have no more for

ever a share in any enjoyments under the sun
and it can bring as little profit to the living even to the spectators of so unusual an interment which will be ended within the narrow bounds of one day
but we must conclude that whenever god raises up so eminent an example of holiness tis on design of procuring a lasting benesit to the world and of conveying such advantages as will the presence of that exemplar
and tis our own fault if we do not share in these advantages which will more enrich us than the inheriting of a whole kingdom would doe

the devouring grave hath swallow'd up the beauly and all the bodily excellencies of the deceas'd queen but there are two immortal things which death hath no power over her memory and example which now seek entertainment in our breasts and are able to make her more honourable and us more happy than legacies or even children left by her which latter god also pleas'd to deny to her and us
by cherishing her memory and imitating her example we shall not only pay the highest honour to her but shew the truest kindness to our selves as also comply with the special obligation which god himself hath laid on us both by giving and taking away so excellent a queen

confess the text which have chosen to assist you on this occasion speaks of deceas'd

teachers and ministers of the gospel whose office consists in guiding men to the heavenly happiness by speaking and declaring the word of god and therefore their character is different from that of the deceas'd queen but it must be granted that the agreement and resemblance between civil rulers and spiritual guides is sufficient to found an equal obligation unto the duties enjoin'd in the text for the station of both is so singular and eminent as to make their memory precious and their example useful to those who had the opportunity of knowing their holy lives and happy deaths
to which might add that the conversation of a pious magistrate doth really speak and publish the word of god tho not in the same manner with the sermons and discourses of ministers of the gospel so that the meditations offered by the words read to you are very sutable to the funeral of a queen whose life and death have set a most excellent copy for our imitation
both these shall endeavour to represent to you when have first spoken to the words themselves
in which we are call'd to consider a duty to be perform'd unto deceas'd holy rulers and a proper direction to assist the performance of the latter

the two duties enjoin'd with respect to deceased holy rulers are


the remembring of them after their death
ii
the following or imitating of their faith

the direction which assists the performance of the latter duty is laid down in the last clause of the verse considering the end or issue of their conversation
concerning the duty of remembring deceased holy rulers shall lay down a few conclusions to explain the nature and grounds of it


an honourable rememerance after death is commonly and justly esteem'd
the common desire of it has been look'd on as an evidence of the immortality of human souls
however that be which tis hot proper now to dispute tis certain that there is a strong desire planted in our souls of perpetuating our names and memories after we have left the world vast expences of pains and treason have been laid out on this very thing
the learned have been willing to employ their time and labours to leave behind em some written monuments to preserve their memories and have judg'd it a sufficient reward of their learn'd labours that they might be able say as the roman poet did

non omnis crescam laude recens

shall not totally dye and be extinguish'd but shall grow after death by the succeeding praise that shall be given me
princes and great men have expended their treasures on buildings and other magnificent durable works as we read of absalom pillar erected only to preserve his name sam

and tis related by moses that one chief design of those who built the tower of babel was to make themselves a name to procure for themselves an honourable remembrance after death
gen

ii
all the methods us'd by wicked men can't procure em an honourable remembrance after death
while they live their power and terror may gain some flattering praises but after death their name is condemn'd to infamy and reproach
prov

there is an art of embalming dead bodies to prevent their putrefaction but nothing can embalm the name of the wicked
many times their memory is quite forgot and buried under the dust of time notwithstanding all their endeavours to preserve and perpetuate it

but if they are remembred tis with infamy and

execration as are absolom haman herod nero and many more who have left their name for a curse as god did once threaten the idolatrous jews isa

iii
tis the will of god that the righteous should have an honourable remembrance after their death
this is one reward which the supreme ruler hath adjudg'd to them that fear god
psal
the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance
and to such who want children to perpetuate their memory god did promise to give a name better then of sons and daughters isa
and this is laid down as an universal maxim that the memory of the just is blessed or honourable prov
many are the instances of those who lived obscure and unregarded to whom after their death god has given a name that has excell'd the honour of princes
mary the sister of lazarus who poured the precious ointment on the head of christ hath a lasting and honourable remembrance whereever the gospel is preach'd

aquila and priscilla who were but mean yet have had their praise in all the churches and will have so to the end of the world

iv
the honourable remembrance of religious rulers after their death is very useful to the world
for


the consideration of this is proper to excite rulers unto religion and piety while they live
indeed this ought not to be the principal motive but it may be regarded in its place as a lower reward which the divine bounty bestows on them who have faithfully served him
among other marks of god's favour by which david was encouraged unto the service of god this is mention'd that the lord had given him a name like to the name of the great men that are in the earth sam

whatever doth animate and excite a magistrate unto religion and vertue as the honour that attends em is proper to do must highly promote the common good
and


the honourable remembrance of holy rulers gives a lasting influence unto their good example after their death
tis truly observ'd by the psalmist that when the breath or spirit of a prince goes forth or departs out of the body in that very day all his thoughts perish psal
but surely tis not the will of god that the example of a good ruler should perish also
no this is too precious a thing to go down into the grave and be cover'd in darkness
the ecacy of a pious example ought long to survive the person who gave it
many years after david decease his holy example did influence the young and excellent prince josias of whom tis said chron

that he walk'd in the

ways of david his father
he imitated the piety and righteousness of david which were carefully transmitted unto after ages
the best examples in the world can have no influence unless they be kept alive by a due remembrance of em
hence it became a most common practice in the ancient church to appoint an annual commemoration of the martyrs whose examples were judg'd to have the greatest efficacy
it must therefore be an inexcusable negligence to forget the faith and holiness which alone we are oblig'd to imitate and this leads us to consider the

ii
and principal duty enjoin'd in the text and laid down in these words whose faith follow or imitate where it must be premis'd that the word faith in this place must not be taken in the strict sense as it denotes an internal act of the soul by which a convinc'd sinner receiveth christ as he is offered to us in the gospel but in a larger signification as it imports christian piety or holiness which is the constant fruit of faith in the former sense
and tis not unusual with the apostle to take this word faith in the metonymical sense as where he mentions the unfeign'd faith or piety which was in timothy and had first dwelt in his grandmother and mother tim

thus in the same epistle chap
speaking of himself he saith have fought the good fight of faith
have acted as a true christian soldier or

combatant
again in this epistle heb
christ is styl'd the author and the finisher of our faith
the leader and rewarder of christian piety and indeed tis not possible to imitate the faith of others but as it is discovered in a holy conversation by which a visible copy or pattern is propounded to our imitation the nature of which is so well known that need only mention the particular ingredients of it as


an esteeming judgment which is made concerning an example set before us
can't seriously imitate that which despise and disesteem
to which must be added
an attentive regarding of this example
a limner must attentively view the original which he intends to draw
we read when gideon would have his soldiers imitate what himself did he saith look on me and do likewise jud
the


and principal ingredient in imitation is the actual resembling of an example set before us
as when a writing scholar imitates a copy given by his master he makes his letters and writing like unto the copy so that when the apostle requires us to follow or imitate the faith of deceas'd rulers his meaning is in other words

tis indeed your duty to remember them who have had the rule over you their faith and holiness must be preserved in your

memory but this is by no means enough the great duty to which you are most strongly oblig'd is to form and order your profession and practice according to their good example that so you may be truly like unto them

the reasons of this important duty are as obvious as they are obliging for


when god doth give holy rulers tis on this design that their example might be imitated
tis found by experience that imitation is one of the strongest principles of human nature which is more easily drawn by example than by the wisest reasons
and especially the practice of a ruler or magistrate is commonly more prevalent than any law
the true observation of the poet is almost in every bodies mouth

componitur orbis regis ad exemplum

how often is it charg'd on jeroboam the first king of the ten tribes that he made israel to sin his idolatrous practice did infect the whole nation
but when righteous rulers are given to a people the wisdom and mercy of god provide a remedy against vice and a cogent motive unto the practice of religion
for the religious example of a prince or ruler doth in a special manner adorn the doctrine of christ and is proper to convince the world that piety is not a mean and dishonourable character

as many do falsly imagine that strict religion is inconsistent with honour and greatness and are prejudic'd against it when they see it entertain'd by persons of a lower rank

but this objection is refuted by the christian example of those who have power and authority and therefore an imitation of such is most reasonably urged and there want not instances of the happy effects which the piety of rulers hath produced in their subjects as tis related that the people of israel serv'd the lord all the days of joshua who did not only lead em in their wars but went before them in the path of righteousness josh

hence twas that when god did promise to the jewish nation that he would restore their judges as at the first and their councellours immediately is added as the consequent of such a blessing afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness isa
a

ii
reason which enforces this duty is that the imitation of pious rulers is the best way of honouring em after their death
all agree that a good king or queen ought to be honoured after their leaving of the world
many ways have been invented and still are us'd to honour deceased rulers such as poems and orations

publick mourning and pompous funerals costly monuments and other memorials of the dead
the gentiles were willing to build altars and temples and pay divino worship to their deceased rulers not to mention the extravagant and absurd methods which some barbarous nations used

but as the last are altogether unlawful so the former are very doubtful and inconsiderable for they may proceed from another principle besides true esteem for the deceas'd but when we imitate the piety and vertue of a ruler after his death this is an infallible testimony of unfeigned esteem
this doth erect the most lasting monuments unto his memory for by this means the souls of men become so many shrines and temples where he lives and inhabits after he is taken out of the world
in the

iii
and last place the imitation of holy rulers renders em publickly useful after their death and so doth compensate the damage that is caus'd by their departure out of the world
if the deceas'd queen whose death we lament could be rais'd to life again this would be justly counted a publick and exceeding gain but it will be a far greater advantage if her holy example doth live after her
her life abstractly considered can't do such service

unto our nation or the protestant interest as her faith and piety can do were they generally followed for these would be a far better defence and then any courage or conduct then any armies or navies can be
god himself has assur'd us that rigteousness exalts a nation prov
we of this age have had a convincing experience of the truth of what the psalmist has affirmed

that no king is saved by the multitude of an host and a mighty man is not delivered by much strength an horse is a vain thing for safety
that we and our brethren could be perswaded to try this unfailing experiment mean the practice of true holiness to which god hath promised deliverance and success isa
wisdom and righteousness shall be the stability of thy times and strength of salvation
to the same purpose is the known declaration made by the blessed god psal
that my people had hearkned unto me and israel had walked in my ways should soon have subdued their enemies

but because the imitation of holy examples is attended with some difficulty and the absence of em after the death of the persons is apt to weaken their influence the apostle lays down a most proper direction to assist the performance of this duty considering the end of their conversation
the original word

which is translated consider hath a significancy which our language can't well express for it imports such an accurate contemplating as is us'd about the

most sublime and worthy objects accordingly a greek interpreter expounds it very exactly reviewing and illustrates it by the instance of a limner who accurately views the original
the object of this consideration viz
the end of their conversation is not conceive to be restrain'd unto the very last moment of their life but takes in the circumstances of their death and the manner how they acted their last part when they were leaving the stage of the world
and truly there can't be a more worthy spectacle than a christian ready to encounter the last enemy
the lights of the world never shine so bright and glorious as in their setting
and an attentive regard unto the exit of a christian and the finishing of his course will very much assist the imitation of his faith and piety
for


the concluding part of a christian's life doth agree with his preceding course and conduct and therefore is a confirming testimony unto his former conversation
tis taken for granted that dying persons judge more wisely than at other times whence tis that the sayings and counsels of such are especially valued and regarded because at such a time men will not dissemble and are least byass'd by common opinion
when therefore the last words and actions of a christian agree with his former life they are an authentick seal by which he

signs his religious choice and conversation
tis often seen that wicked men when death approacheth change their note and heartily condemn their own evil life yea they will warn others against such a course as themselves liv'd in
by this they blemish their former course and proclaim the folly of it
if a dying christian did at last and confess his mistake this would quite spoil all the efficacy of his example but when he seals the doctrin which he profess'd and obey'd with his last breath yea when he is call'd with his blood this gives a mighty force unto the holy example which he leaves behind him
when the apostle would strongly excite these believing hebrews to imitate the holy patriarchs after a description of their vertues he saith of them these all died in faith heb

at their death they acted the same faith which had govern'd their lives
there is no just pretence to suspect that strict religion is a cheat or counterfeitshew for tis own'd and stuck to at a time when men are the most oblig'd to use the greatest sincerity
and

ii
the concluding part of a christian life demonstrates the singular advantage of faith and holiness
one of the most common objections against a religious life is that which was made in the days of the prophet malachi chap
it is vain to serve god and what profit is it that we have kept his ordinance the

happy conclusion of a christian life doth fully refute and silence this objection and withal strongly enforces the imitation of such an example
we are therefore expressly required to mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace or happiness psal
this might easily be prov'd by many evidences of which shall only mention three that are most obvious


the fortitude and courage of a dying christian proves the excellent usefulness of faith and piety
tis no contemptible privilege to overcome the fear of death as the apostle and his companions had done who could say we are confident and willing rather to be absent from the body and present with the lord cor
all the helps of wit and learning of reason and education can't do this service tis often seen that the wits and beaux esprits the bold and valiant are afraid to die their courage fails when they receive the sentence of death whereas a real christian though of the timorous sex and of a vulgar education is enabled to triumph over death and the grave because to such god has given the victory through jesus christ cor


the supporting hope in a dying christian is another fruit of faith and holiness it will be granted that we can never stand more

in need of this cordial than at the end of our lives when we are entring into the dark valley of the shadow of death but tis not riches and treasures not greatness and power not a crown or a kingdom that can furnish with this sustaining hope
death will certainly overturn the hopes of wicked men who had nourish'd a strong confidence on the mercy of god and some lifeless form of religion what is the hope of the hypocrite when god taketh away his soul job
but the righteous hath hope in his death prov
a faith that worketh a gospel obedience is the only root which can bring forth the hope which sustains a dying christian
the consideration of which is a very forcible motive unto the imitation of such an example


the inward peace and joy which sweeten the death of a christian evidence the great advantage of a holy conversation
the peace and gladness of a wicked man are like a house built on the sand that makes a fair shew as long as nothing assaults it
how oft is it known that the approach of death quite spoils the mirth of a secure sinner who then feels an earthquake in his breast and the review of his past life changes his joy into sadness and terror
the midnight cry that proclaims the coming of the bridegroom must be terrible to the foolish sleeping virgins who had not made themselves ready for the

but the diligent christian who has employ'd his time and opportunities in pleasing and honouring of god hath just reason of rejoycing when he is near the end of his race and is going to receive the glorious prize
no question but the apostle felt a most reviving gladness when he us'd the language which we read tim

have finish'd my course henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness tis related in the life of st ambrose that when the noblemen of milan visiting him in his last sickness requested him that he should pray for the lengthning of his own life which they judged necessary for the publick good he made this most excellent answer have not so lived among you that should be ashamed to live longer nor am afraid to die for we have a good master non ita inter vos vixi ut pudeat me vivere nec timeo mori quoniam bonum dominum habemus
if we reflect on these particulars we shall discern how proper and suitable is the direction laid down in the text which requires to consider the end or concluding part of the conversation of those who have liv'd and died in the faith of jesus and especially of those whose eminent station had made their example more obliging and efficacious
and this character certainly belongs unto the deceased queen mary of ever happy memory whose faith and piety come now to represent
none must expect an accurate

delineation of such a pattern from so rude a hand as mine this work either is or will be done by some able hand shall only attempt without flattery to relate such instances of her unfeigned piety as were manifest to all who had opportunity of observing her life and can't be deny'd even by her enemies

her parentage and descent her beauty and wit her moral conjugal and royal vertues must be past over in silence as not necessary to my design which is only to represent the christian vertues which did shine in her carriage and conversation
of which the


first and indeed the foundation of all the rest was her spiritual knowledge and thorough acquaintance with religion
ignorance or a consus'd knowledge of religious matters in high or low doth blast the soul and make the life unfruitful of which there are too many evidences every day set before our eyes
sad it is to consider how protestants of all ranks content themselves with a slight knowledge of their religion and preferr any other skill before this they are able to discourse pertinently of business and news and the cases that occurr in war and peace but the bible is a strange land to em as if they were no ways concern'd in it but so it was not to this pious queen whose constant diligence in studying the scriptures and reading the books

that explain it may shame some who are call'd ministers and the most who bear the protestant name
this exercise did employ a considerable part of her time and laid the foundation of that eminent goodness which gain'd her an universal esteem

ii
a second instance of christian plety was her religions observing of the day and appointments of god most of the great ones make little account of these and therefore tis no wonder that few of them lead holy and exemplary lives
but tho the deceas'd queen was educated in a vitious court and liv'd many years in a country where the day of god is almost universally profan'd yet she made conscience of sanctifying it according to the institution of god and practice of the best christians in the world
she did not sacrilegiously divide the between god and the world between religion and vanity but employ'd it as a portion of sacred time and by holding on in this course she gain'd strength to resist and overcome the temptations by which those of her order as also most others are vanquish'd and enslav'd
twere heartily to be wish'd that those who are willing publickly to commend her to make verses and orations in her praise would imitate this part of her example and that all would follow her diligence and seriousness about all the appointments of god and particularly

the lord supper which she would not partake of without spending many retir'd hours in making due preparation for that solemnity
and this leads to

iii
a third instance of her unfeigned faith and piety viz
a constant and diligent performance of the secret duties of religion
she did not confine her devotion to a church or the publick solemnities of worship as too many both high and low doe but made conscience of spending some part of every day and especially her morning hours in secret attendance upon god and minding the concerns of her soul
like moses she often ascended alone into the mount and her secret converse with god made her face to shine and adorn'd her life with rare humility and meekness and the government of her passions
so that her moderation was known to all and scarce ever any angry and bitter language was heard from her mouth which was one happy fruit of her secret religion as we read concerning moses that he was the meekest man in all the earth but withal he had more secret communion with god than any who liv'd in his time

iv
a fourth instance of her unfeigned faith and piety was her love to all good men though of a different communion
her esteem and affection were not confin'd to one party

or to the church of which her self was a member
this is the unchristian character of many that they hate and despise those who differ from them in the circumstantials of religion but the deceased queen had a larger soul she lov'd and valu'd the image of god she found it
tis well known how frequently may say constantly she joyn'd in the worship of god with the dutch and french churches though their constitution and order are very different from those of the church of england
have been a witness of the kindness and respect with which she treated english dissenting ministers and was present when she thankt one of that quality for a practical book of divinity which he had publish'd and had been put into her hands
this consideration makes our loss the greater because she is taken away who was so capable and willing to compose the unhappy differences in matters of religion which she did lament and earnestly wish'd the removal of em
what did hinder her healing and designs shall not stand to enquire


the fifth and last instance of her faith and piety which shall mention was her bounty and liberality unto the distressed
those who never had themselves experience of want and distress are tempted unto a neglect and disregard of the miserable most of the great and rich chuse rather to lay out their treasures

on any vanity than in relieving the destitute and distressed
but this pious queen was rich in this kind of good works and did as willingly seek out objects of her charity as others do avoid em
the character which solomon gives of a vertuous woman did most visibly belong to the deceas'd queen prov
she stretcheth out her hand to the poor yea she reacheth forth both her hands to the needy
and it might truly have been said of her what job alledg'd as an evidence of his sincerity in the service of god job
the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me and caus'd the widows heart to sing for joy such a christian practice this wise queen laid up treasure in heaven and therefore was not unwilling to remove from this earth
and this leads us to reflect on the happy end of her conversation her triumphant death which crown'd her religious life
for though few could find more charms in life than she on the account of her age and high station together with the general love of subjects and strangers all which are wont to render an untimely death very unwelcom yet she could receive the sentence and message of death with an undaunted mind and a chearful submission to the divine disposal
she needed not to beg longer time to prepare for death which is the common request of high and low who first understand the use of life when the end of it approaches this folly she was not guilty

of but as a wise virgin had betimes

trimmed her lamp and dressed her soul to meet the heavenly bridegroom who hath wash'd her from her sins in his own blood and bestow'd on her a far more glorious crown then that which death hath taken from her head
so that we have no cause to mourn for her

as those who have no hope

but we have the justest cause to mourn for our selves and our nations yea to lament this forlorn earth which hath lost so excellent an inhabitant and rare example of christian piety we may justly suspect that because she was so little imitated while she liv'd therefore god hath remov'd her from this world in which tis to be fear'd the darkness will now encrease when so great a luminary is eclips'd
and the darkness of impiety and prophaness will draw after it a black tempest of calamity and desolation
the untimely death of a religious ruler hath often been a presage and of national judgments
thus it fell out to the kingdom of judah after the death of josiah chron last chap compared with the latter end of the preceding
and our nation had the same sad experience after the death of the pious young king edward the vi on which immediately followed the bloody and dismal days of mary

to prevent such calamities no better direction can be given than that laid down in the text viz
to follow the faith and imitate the holiness of the deceased queen
could we and those who were related to her be persuaded to walk in the steps of her faith and piety we should reap more advantage after her death than we did in her life
tis a memorable wonder that is related king

how when a dead man was cast into the sepulchre of elisha as soon as he touch'd the bones of elisha he revived and stood up on his feet
we may hope that if the holy example of the deceased queen might touch our dead souls they would be reviv'd and gain spiritual life yea our nation would live and be made a praise in the earth

we are willing to express our esteem and respect to her many have been at some expence to wear the tokens of sorrow which can bring no real advantage either to her or our own souls why should we refuse to imitate her good example which will bring the greatest and most lasting benefits question not but many will endeavour to procure and keep some memorial or relique of the deceased queen a jewel or picture or garment or perhaps some of her hair which are all useless and insignificant things whereas would we be at the pains to get and preserve the likeness of her piety this would make us happy indeed
for this end shall add some arguments

and motives which may persuade us unto this imitation
and


first none can with any reason judge this imitation to be a disparagement to them
what shall any count it below them to study the scriptures to sanctifie the day of god to serve god in secret to love all good men to relieve the distressed when they see how this glorious queen did place her highest honour in such a practice can any disdain to bear the yoke of christ which she did so chearfully submit to is there any colour or pretence to object that strict religion doth not agree with the character of the great and honourable when she did esteem it her principal ornament and excellence oh amazing folly that the vices of rulers should soon grow into fashion but their vertues should be slighted and undervalued
secondly the lowest and meanest are capable of imitating her christian piety as to the substance of it
a resembling of her power and regal dignity is impossible her stature beauty and faculties of mind are not the objects of our imitation but surely the poorest and most despicable may walk in the steps of her faith and holiness
there is but one common path to heaven both for princes and peasants


thirdly we shall be if we refuse to imitate one whom we our selves praise and commend
a life that is not worthy to be imitated can't deserve commendation
what shall we answer to our judge when this perplexing question is put to us if you did commend why did you not imitate her and if you would not imitate why did you commend her persuade my self that few princes have found more to commend em than the lamented queen both in her life and after her death and yet fear few will heartily endeavour to follow her example
but let us consider that to be condemned out of our own mouths is the saddest case in the world luk
how can we escape when we are condemned by our selves
fourthly we all have the same essential helps and assistance which the deceased queen had
indeed her high station gave her some accidental advantage but we have the same bible the same sabbaths the same ordinances the same spirit to assist us which she enjoy'd
christ the sun of righteousness shines alike to the lowest shrub and the tallest cedar
nay


fifthly we have much fewer hinderances in the practice of religion the snares and temptations of a crown and a court are most dangerous obstacles in the way to happiness

the passage to heaven is much easier from a cottage than from a palace


in the last place we shall all desire to have the happy end that she hath had to die with such hope and joy as she found when she was leaving this world
balaam wish that he might

die the death of the righteous is as vain as tis common to those who will not work righteousness
the end of a journey must have some resemblance unto the quality of it
we must never expect to have the latter end of the religious and to overcome the last enemy if we refuse to imitate them who have fought the good sight of faith and have flnish'd their course with joy as this pious queen did whom her imitators shall see shining with a far brighter glory than any throne can bestow
till then farewell great and excellent queen farewell happy and glorious saint may thy memory always live in our breasts and thy example be efficacious in our lives

the end

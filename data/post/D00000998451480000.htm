Of the blynde Iudgementes of people concernynge the secrets celestyall in the merytes of sayntes.
And howe a cry sten man shall vowe vse hym in vowes and pylgrymages and oblacyons.
WHere as do dayly here and se great dynysyons: and opy nyons the one contrary to a nother amonge crysten people whiche haue or shuld ha ue one fayth one god and one especyal me dyatour vnto god.
For vs whiche is cryste Thesu our redemptor (as paule ascrybeth to the Corynthyans.
Notwithstandynge we haue many folysshe fantasyes now adayes in Iud gementes secrete mysteryes of god in reasonynge dyssputynge whiche engendreth sysines and folysshe blynde opynyo~s amo~ge crysten people some wyll say why or howe is this man fallen in decay syc nesse or myschaunce beynge a good man.
And why is suche one auaunced in welth dygnyte prosperyte beynge an oppressor of pore people a vysyous {per}son in lyuynge hereupon shalbe sayd dyuers oppynyo~s passyng ma~nes reason whiche pertayneth onely to the Iudgementes of god and not of man for cryste sayth here to.
Also some wyll reason on the merytes lyynge of sayn: whiche of them was holye then the other or hyer in fauour with god: oft tymes suche questons engendreth stryfes and sysmes with dyuersties of opynyons and so procedeth therof enuye pryde and vayne glory when one preferryth this saynt another that saynt and one this pylgrymage or ymage and another at pylgrymage ymage suerly these sensuall opynyons rather dspleaseth saynts then pleaseth them For the lorde omnypotent sayth am not the lorde god of dbate or stryfe: but of vny+te and pas whiche standeth in trewe mekenesse and not in exaltynge or magnyfyeng this or that some be more styred to thr saynt or pylgrymage then to that othr and that with great mynde and affyon.
Trewely suche mynde or affyon is more worldly carnall then celestyall or spyrytuall or godly sayth not god am not he that hath made all sayntes (yes trewly.)
And more ouer he sayth haue gyuen the~ grace and haue gyuen them glory: am onely sete to all theyr meryt preuented them with the swetnesse of my blessynges know myne elect and chosen people afore the worlde was created haue chosen them from the worlde they haue not chosen me: called the~ by my grace.
And drewe them by my mercy led them throughe all temptacyons sent them inwarde comfortes gaue them perseueraunce crowned theyr pacyence know the fyr ste man and the last loue them all with suche loue as can not be estemy on erthe.
And thus sayth oure lorde am to all my saynt in all thyng to be praysed honoured and in all and euery of them whom haue gloryously magnyfyed and predestynated without any meryte in them goynge byfore me.
Therfore he that disprayseth the left of my sayntes dothe no honour to the greatest: for haue made both the lesse and the more.
And he that dyspyseth any of my sayntes he disprayseth me and also other of my sayntes in the kyngdom of heuen for they be all one and faste vnyed and knyt togyther in one sure bond of perfyte charite they loue me moche more then them sel or theyr owne merytes for they rapt aboue theyr owne loue holye abyde in my loue in the which they rest by eternall fry syon.
Wherfore let euery man cease of theyr carnall myndes affccyonat opynyons bestly whiche can not loue but prynat ioye to serche the state of my in heuen for ye Iudge after your folysshe blynde sentence and not after the pleasure of the eternall trewth of god.
Thus in moche people is great Ignorancy: and specyally in them that haue so lytell lyght of ghostly vnderstandynge: that they can not loue no person with a clene herte we may not ymagyn ce lestyall thyng as we do terestyall for they be so fae in dyfference vnlyke that no herte nor iye nor tonge can esteme or iudge as Paule testyfye to the Loryntheans the. ii. chapytre.
They be very well contented with the Ioye that they are in so men co de refrayne them selues from suche vayne argumentes.
Also many there be that wyll reason who is hyest in heuen: suche know not whether they be worthy them selues to be nombred with the lest that shal come thy ther for it is a great thynge to be one of the lest in heuen: where al be noble or excellent For all that shall come thyther shall be called the sones of god and so shall they be in dede as saynt Paule wytnesseth to the Ro mayns the.
All those that werke in the spyryte of god they are suerly the chyldren of god do ye nat co~syder what the mother of the sones of zebedei desyred of cryste that the one myght syt on the right ha~ de and the other on the left hande when he shulde come to his kyngdom what answer gaue he Mat. xx. chapytre.

It is not to me to grau~t you but for those which my fathr hath prepayred it for wherfore let all crysten people leue all suche mystycall reasons co~cernynge to the one ly hye dyuyne power of god whiche neuer erthly creature hath had nor shall haue kno weleg of wherfore this suffyseth to a good crysten man.
And so to procede also to se and here the great dyuersyes of myndes opynyons one co~trary to the other greuyth my conscyence very fore Reme~brge the very trewe sayenges of cryste.
And here in ddynge his omnipotent power: where as the Euangelyst sayth.

And agayne yf we mynde or do it for any affeccyon for oure owne solace and pleasure.
In so doynge it auayleth lytell and in it apperynge more ypocrysy then perfeccion.
Then when ye are moued to any Pylgrymage by powe dyuyne or by aduersyte co~strayned by hop as by se or on lande or fyre or any other peryll.
And then when ye vowe or make any {pro}myse or pylgrymage: gyue your hole honour vnto god fyrste with herte myn de.
And then vowe or promyse no more in that extremyte then thou wylt {per}fytly performe when the tyme co~meth.
And then do it with dyscyon sobernesse auoydyng all vayne glory and in your pylgrymage call vnto your remembraunce what god of his mercy dyd for you: at the vow or pro myse makynge and with faythful mynde do it in the way of penaunce repentaun ce of your mysdedes synnes and in wyllynge no more to offende god to your pow er and wyll and when ye come where you haue vowed.
Then in no wyse suppose or thynke yt the same Karued ymage or payn trd pycture wrought with ma~nes hande hath any lyfelynesse or grace or comfort no more than hath any ymage of the same sort in your parysshe churche or els where and yf you haue any other truste or confyden in them you do playne ydolatry afore god.
Also be the place neuer so holy and the pyc ture or ymage appere neuer so gloryous or curyous in syght be you well ware of any truste or confydence in them: for in so doynge you dyshonoure god as apperyth exodi.
And to the Corynthyans. x. chapytee ascrybeth partly) how we shal do in this cause (and in the.

And in so doynge you do fulfyll your pylgrymage purely and trewely: bothe to god and to the presentacyon of the ymage whiche gloryfyeth in the wyll of god in heuen as we do or shulde do here in erthe santfy his name and glorye in hym.
But we ofte tymes do our owne folysshe cerymonyall wylles or pleasures whiche are but fantases and vayne glory wherof we shal neuer haue thankes.
For though they appere neuer so gloryous to the people And also as concernynge your oblacyons be it golde syluer wax or lyghtes suppose it co~meth of your owne fre wyll deuocyon to ofer what ye lyst without any on and do consyder it to be well done so you hurte not your self nor your co~ scyence therin pond here in your conscyence howe the wyll of god is santefyed in vs: when he chargeth vs to do the werk of mercy to the pore ned: whiche is the blessyd ymage of god (and that ye gyue or offre to the lest of them ye do it to cryste hym self sayth the euangelyst Mat.

Neuerthelesse do thynke and alowe pyl grymages and oblacyons very expedyent in the syght of god profytable to the soule so that it be done accordynge to the law and wyll or pleasur of god.
And other wy se it is frustrat voyde be you sure wherof you shal neuer haue thankes nor fauour of god for your wylfull wastynge and wyll not do that whiche ye be co~maunded to do.

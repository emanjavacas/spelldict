to the honourable edward deering of london esq his majesties merchant and receiver general of his majesties revenues in the counties of kent essex surrey

honoured sir

not only your acquaintance with the sciences mathematical and the many profitable labors of the industrious person whose life here publish but your known affection to all the friends of urania hath invited me to this address as also to return my humble thanks for that you were pleased lately in a company of yet ignorant opposers as well nobly to favour the truths of astrology as courteously to own me and my meaner arguments in its behalf
in which contest by your prevailing and sinnewey reasons you so far wrought upon their passion and prejudice little than a miracle that at length those angry opponents although some of them were men otherwise learned and elderly too began ingeniously to acknowledge that they had never heard so much discourse of astrology in all their lives and therewithal frankly engaged to enquire into the grounds of that science before they believed any more reports against it
a good president for all that are enemies to any truth upon the bare of others or because the ignorant multitude as taught by the supercilious

man in black have declaimed or rather snarl'd against

it
vox populi is not alwaies vox dei and truth is too coy to be courted by the she hath select favourites to whom she dispenceth her graces

in your acceptance of this dedication you will help to preserve to posterity a true son of science one whose industry was such that ages will scarcely equal
and yet sir not so much protect him as that mean piece have in the following history drawn of him scarce to the life confess
my numbers are too immusical to sound forth his worth and my colours now like his ghost too pale and lifeless to express his great deservings
mr wing was his own best herald and his fame will live for ever in his own works
what have done is only to pay a grateful respect to his ashes as he was my friend that future times may find he had some who were contemporary with him that knew how to value him and his merits
if therefore sir you will vouchsafe me but a corner of the mantle of your nobler reputation and favour for my defence you will thereby at once keep mr wing warm in his coffin and cover the many imperfections of him who thus endeavours to embalm his memory against the of envy and detraction and esteems it one of his greatest felicities that he hath an opportunity to entitle himself

honoured sir from my study in by the westminster
your real servant and honourer gadbury

some remarks on the life and death of mr vincent wing compared with his nativity

mr vincent wing was born at north luffenham in the county of rutland in the year of our lord
on the ninth day of april at five hours minutes or afternoon
he was a branch of an honest and virtuous stock as proceeding from parents rather good than great who with their ancestors have been long seated in the said town of luffenham enjoying

a greater blessing in their continued and setled condition

than many others in the multitude of riches a fixed habitation being even the mightiest mercy that fortune can bestow upon mortality and so characterized by god himself to moses in the mount
whereas a wandring or erratique condition or course of life either in persons or families is not only a reproach but a curse to them that undergo it and their future generations
and this cain in the beginning of time and the jewes since the death of our saviour have by a long and miserable experience found certain and true
but mr wing family hath been happy above many other families in the inheriting so peculiar a blessing

and yet not more fortunate therein than in the bringing forth this their ingenious and industrious son who from his own merit and endeavours with god's blessings thereupon hath not only preserved but much augmented the reputation of his deserving predecessors and so firmly planted his name and memory there leaving to his posterity an estate and fortune considerable to support and maintain it should their after endeavours be wanting thereunto of which am credibly informed there is at present no just cause to doubt

where a large purse or ample fortune to a father is wanting the son though never so prompt and meritorious must be content to miss of a liberal breeding and thus it fared with mr wing

whose lot it was to be of capable years and fit for learning even in the worst of times viz at the begining of our late unhappy confusions when rebellion was opposed to loyalty plundering and to the providing for and advancement of posterity

the pistol and to terence and tully
and every person though of a fortune competent had enough to do to shift and provide for himself
in which unhappy and perhaps unheard of calamity mr wing best friends and parents sharing were the more disabled for pursuing his promotion and encouragement in learning
but although it was his luckless fortune and unhappiness to want an academical education yet such was his natural inclination and propensity to an acquaintance with letters that by his own industry

and study he had in time conquered a competent portion of learning viz
a perfect acquaintance of the latine tongue and a moderate understanding in the greek by which happy advantages the greatest and most critical authors and masters of astrologie

and the mathematiques in their own language were no strangers unto him
from whence we may collect this true and modest observation

that mr wing was

born a scholar although not bred or made one and therefore preferrible before many thousands that had the gainful advantage of an university learning and yet were not therewith

capable of matching him in mathematical and astrological performances

so excellent is an innate worth and glory that all the external paints and florishes cannot so much as equalize much less transcend or surpass it

yet let the ingenious reader know that have no for the muses or for such whose happy fate it is to suck at the sacred brests of minerva as having the schools of learning in adoration and ever bearing a high honour and value for all those that derive science from them and could heartily wish that our english universities were so happy as to nurse and foster

only such whose genitures render them capable of learning what they always prudently teach those being the most probable of making returns of gratitude unto them and of sounding forth to the world their deserved honour and fame
how many are there that be constantly educated in schools of good literature that for want of a genious to cope with and conquer science become rather the scorn than honour of learning of every wood a mercury

cannot be made
if the flint have no fire in it naturally in vain is the steel applyed unto it in hopes of procuring any
schools of learning being like unto skilful lapidaries who polish the diamonds of our minds and understandings and set a radiant lustre upon them although we bring them thither rugged and mishapen and thither we must bring them or go without our errand

and indeed men must have peculiar stars for the attaining such a peculiar favour and blessing from the hand of god and nature and being so furnish'd will in time appear and shew themselves and dart forth their native splendor like our mr wing although they should want the embellishes and polishes of education· yet say not all out so happily and if this our deceased friend were so eminently successful and deserving without them and shined in his generation above and beyond so many that had the enjoyment of such adorning acquisitions what would he have done and how spreading would his fame have been if his so rare natural parts had met in conjunction with them

but because mr wing was an astrologer and mathematician and that perhaps these papers may be mostly inspected by such as are inclined to those curious sciences shall desire and expect the pardon of the ingenious if swerve a little from common method in the writing the life of this my worthy friend and here before proceed any further insert his nativity as it was curiously done by his own hand and by himself friendly communicated to me several years

before he dyed he being of so generous a mind and courage and yet so humble withall that as he did not fear to or any evil of himself so he was not elevated or puffed up with the thoughts of any prescient advantages that were likely to issue to

him but used his nativity and what he understood thereby as the great apostle used the world as if he used it not
submitting himself even in the best or worst of things by it either promised or threatned ever to the guidance and governance of that universal power that ruleth all things by the wisdome of his providence even god blessed for ever figure nascitur vincentius wing anno

here are no less than four planets competitors for the honour of almuten in this geniture viz
the moon mercury jupiter and venus and truly if understood his mind and actions aright he equally shared in their peculiar qualities and significations
for he wanted not the publick fame and multiplicity of business that the moon gives nor the ingenuity that mercury bestows nor the justice and goodness that jupiter affordeth nor yet the harmless and pleasant

conversation to sweeten the rest for without that all business is a burthen and all knowledge a slavery that venus patronizeth but of this more anon

the sun alone is hylech

or propagator vitae the geniture being diurnal and he in an aphetical place
and being just entring taurus we may admit venus the alchocoden

or giver of years

or should we in respect of the moon being so powerful in the figure admit her a sharer in the designing of life which is not altogether unreasonable but agreeable to the opinions of omar and firmicus then will jupiter be alchocoden which is in effect the same for both their mean years are and more they cannot give of themselves in this nativity because one of them is oppressed by saturn quadrate and the other by mars his opposition and although mr wing lived beyond these four years at the least that is to be attributed to the strength of his nativity in general and not to his alchocoden which could not preserve him above the aforesaid number of years for the reasons before remembred

saturn is the anareta or the destroyer of life in this geniture as being first locally placed in the eighth house secondly as afflicting the lady of the horoscope thirdly as he is lord of the fourth house which astrologically signifieth the grave fourthly as he is a planet inimical to nature
and accordingly when the

sun or hylech was directed to his conjunction or body mr wing dyed

and so come to consider of the nativity it self and to compare it with the actions dispositions and inclinations of the deceased person to whom it appertained

herein you see that signum justitiae

or the coelestial ballance is ascending the horoscope and the royal fixed star undefined span alphabet or the virgins spike ariseth therewith

plainly demonstrating mr wing according to the rules of astrology to be born for an honourable end and purpose

and to do great and worthy things in his generation which he hath not failed to perform thereby eminently justifying the influences of those stars

that sub deo have honoured him at his intrat into this world
the benigne planet venus is governess of the horoscope and posited in her exaltation

in trine of the moon and in a noble reception of luna and jupiter all of most admirable import and signification as every understanding astrologer knows
and agreeable hereunto mr wing as he was honoured equally with many above his degree so he merited such respect being a man

of a very just and pious frame and temper

generally even humored

at sometimes he would admit of facetiousness without scandal affability without injury and did a little delight in a free and harmless conversation being neither too austere on the one hand

or too vain and fruitless on the

other
but like his horoscope was equally poiz'd between both and yielded to neither extream
he was scarcely known to envy any man and do you not see that mars is the weakest planet in the scheam as if he had wanted choler to awaken revenge or to create a passion but on the contrary was kind respective and obliging to all men even to his enemies as the holy rule enjoyns if they were not beyond the line of reason malicious and provoking
he was nothing ambitious or insulting

but rather meek and humble and always apt to depreciate himself
he was never distrustful or suspicious of others because free from the taint of those qualities himself and always virtuous and true hearted
these are the natural significations of such happy and positions together with their genuine verifications
and the better to enforce and make good all this that we have said and more it is observable that the noble trine of the moon and venus before spoken of is made from those two planets greatest dignities viz that of astrologers called house and exaltation which gave mr wing a more curious frame of soul and a better opportunity and means to shew the excellency integrity activity and evenness thereof than if so glorious an aspect had proceeded from weaker parts of the heavens mean from such parts or places wherein those planets had less delighted or had been more meanly and

poorly dignified
thus we see by experience that the dignities of the planets are no vain and idle things and that we ought to esteem more of them than of chimera's or castles in the aire
could produce a great many parallel instances but this is so certain and undoubted a truth that it needs not

from this admirable trine

and it's happening not only in the dignities of the planets trining but in the dignities of the benevolent planet jupiter

the patron of things divine

proceeded that great and unfeigned love duty and reverence which mr wing constantly paid to religion and to the service of god being always known for a true and zealous frequenter of the church and an adorer of the clergie esteeming them the most worthy of honour and reverence that god himself had been pleased to commit the charge of his most honourable and valuable jewels in the world unto even the souls of men
he was indeed so much and so great a votary to religion and piety that many of the almanacks he annually wrote were in a manner sermons or expositions or applications of some useful texts of scripture encouraging people by the word of god as well as by the works of god to follow that which was religious audable good and profitable
by which ingenious and pious practice of his we are made happy in the acquaintance of this great truth against the perverse wilful obstinate

unreasonable and crooked opinions of the enemies to all stary learning
that a man may be a good christian and yet an astrologer and that divinity and astrologie to a sober and unprejudiced understanding are not incompatible there being no such antipathy between the word

and works of god or those that study the one and the other as naturalists tell us there is between the sun and rue or the vine and colewort but that they may well stand and grow together
caeli enarrant gloriam dei
psal
vers

he was a person of a very ready ripe and pregnant wit and had good judgment and memory thereunto annexed the want of the later of which was a defect that the learned doctor hammond exceedingly bewailed in himself saying that it was easier for him to pen twenty sermons than to get one by heart
what mr wing read was his own and thence he began to be a mathematician

in his younger years being capable of understanding all the parts of arithmetique of the several ways used in surveying land measuring all sorts of heights and distances
as also of making all kinds of dyals with many other neat and commendable acquirements by that time he was but eighteen years of age as have often heard himself as well as others report
so that in a sence it may be said of him as it was of the holy st remigius and the great doctor thomas

from the time of his first capacity of learning he out stripped those that were much his superiours in age and may justly add in education also

and truly he had need be naturally ingenious that attempts such lofty crabbed coy and difficult studies at any time much more in his juvenile years when the feather of youth is high and spreading and principally waves us to vanities seldome suffering our inclinations to reach after serious or weighty things they being as contrary thereunto as blood to melancholy heat to cold winter to summer
but this mr wing was born

to prove the influences of the stars certain and true and by an apt demonstration

in himself to shew us that the god of stars is not tyed to the meaner methods and observations of men or to his own ordinary way of working but pursues the rules of his own good will and pleasure varying from his common course how and when and as oft as he pleaseth
thus he can satisfie the stomach beyond man's reason without food

the thirst without wine and feed our intellectuals also if he vouchsafe it without instruction of books or letters

tis his prerogative peculiar to make strong things of weak and excellent things of things contemptible and despised an age in youth and contrariwise a childishness in elder years and by this his foolishness sometimes to amaze othertimes to destroy the wisdom of men
thus to

declare his omnipotence

he is pleased to raise ventidius though of a very low and mean extraction to the greatest honour and dignity in rome and to make cicero whose parentage or original if story may be credited was scarce known pater patriae the father of his country
and thus by god's especial favour and benignity is mr wing raised from an indifferent degree and quality

to be a reputation to his country and a promoter of the severer sciences
and from them to an equal honour for indeed he hath taken more than equal pains with the admirable and ingenious kepler with the ever celebrated alphonsus

with the renowned ticho brahe with the immortal and ever glorious julius caesar with all which illustrious and famous persons his name and memory will for ever shine in the treasury and bibliotheck of fame for his indefatigable and admired industry

acquisitions and performances in all mathematical and astrological learning

to fit him with a soul for these illustrious enquiries for such they are he had in his nativity a noble reception of mars and mercury and mercury swift in motion and this by the dignity of the house

viz the greatest that can be and such that astrologers generally account equivalent to a sextile or trine aspect of them

and the moon which is the conveyer of all the other planets influxes to this our terrene star is hastning to an aspect of them both
which

in an astrological sence forceth the imagination fancy and ingenuity of a person pardon the expression for it is very true that is so born beyond the common rate of exertion and ripens the mind with all its faculties in so celerous and active a manner that it affordeth a harvest of wit and judgment in such men before there will be an appearance of a spring in others that shall unfortunately want these forwarding configurations
and thus it cometh to pass that some persons are so prodigiously and to a miracle illuminate and afford great crops of art and learning before others of more tenebrous and cloudy souls can put forth either leaf or blossome

thus it was apparent in the nativity of that reverend prelate

the late lord primate of ireland doctor usher whom paulus testardus justly stile

seculi ecclesiae decus eximium the greatest honour of the church and age who having such a configuration in his geniture was so active and forward in his studies

that the history of his life saith he was created master of arts at twenty years of age
thus also the late reverend bishop of durham doctor morton from the same reason in his nativity was learned betimes in comparison of many others as is recorded in the history of his life
so also the late learned doctor hall bishop of norwich being born when mars and mercury were in trine aspect was known to be master of as

large and spreading intellectual abilities as any learned in the whole world witness the several incomparable pieces he wrote and left behind him in print especially that learned and pious treatise entituled his contemplations
thus likewise the most learned and acute phylosophers henry cornelius agrippa and john baptist

morine whose noble genitures shewed the same worthy configurations and who more nimble and fortunately forward in all kind of learning than they infinite numbers more could instance in who as these already mentioned with our mr wing enjoying such excellent and beneficial rayes of the stars have been as comets in the ages they lived and flourished in attracting the eyes and wonder of all men towards them for their great and fortunate parts and performances but these few are sufficient

by this we are instructed how god almighty in his wisdome hath suited and proportioned all inferiour actions

persons and things to the motions and configurations of the heavenly bodies and how much it makes for the honour of his majesty that all temporary productions are ordered and disposed of by this coelestial as it hath pleased him to appoint and ordain at the first

from this happy reception of mars and mercury together with the moon configurations with them of which before you have heard it is mr wing was not only

capable of knowledge and understanding but was therein very communicative and diffusive
he hated to hide his talent in a napkin

or covetously to cloyster up that science which he so happily above many thousands of others had attained unto and was blessed with all
he was freely willing and ready to impart any thing let it be never so curious and choice a secret to any ingenious person or son of urania and hath often publickly professed that it was his great discontent and trouble if at any time in his writings he thought he had not been plain even to the meanest or most ordinary or costive understanding

and to go a little further in this argument these configurations did not only give him a great love unto and a delight in knowledge but a strength of mind and ability of body for the same
thus was he fitted for travelling thorow the most crooked and crucifying parts of astronomy
as those of the restoring the most hard to be found places of the two most critical planets in the heavens mars and

mercury

he had in all respects an active geniture and accordingly hated slothfulness and idleness with a perfect hatred accounting it a shame and error for any man to foster or cherish such contemptible issue or to think that he was created or brought forth into the world for so despised and inglorious an end
and was therefore so frugal of his time like the thuscan philosophers

that thought the loss of a day irreparable as not only not to or mispend any the smallest part or portion thereof after he was of capable and understanding years but very prudently and advantagiously to improve every little minute making his books his recreations and his severer and wasting studies his pleasures

if he were of any thing covetous it was of knowledge being indeed scarcely ever satisfied therewith making it his business to frequent the company

of the most learned and excellent men when he came to london at any time and so to spend his time whereas others generally turn such journeys into pleasure and recreation and truly so did mr wing too
for such converse was his delight his mind being principally placed upon such a felicity
thus did mr wing constantly both abroad and at home labour after the discovery of the most mysterious things in astrologie geometry algebra trigonometry and all other parts of mathematical learning

but mr wing did not labour after this toylsome manner only to satisfie and please himself but to profit and advantage others
and to this purpose after his many years painful labours and a consuming of himself in study and business he hath published to the world these several books following


his urania practica or practical astronomy

harmonicon coeleste or the harmony of the visible world

astronomia instaurata in four parts

ephemerides of the coelestial motions for
years with an excellent introduction to the knowledge of all mundane alterations

an ingenious treatise of surveying

examen astronomiae carolinae in his own defence

astronomia britannica written in latine now in the press and almost ready to be published

computatio catholica an excellent treatise now almost also ready to be published besides his annual labours which always tended to the utility of the ingenious astrologers and mathematicians

in which pieces of astronomy he hath most facilely solved the not very easily solved phaenomena of the heavens and so plainly proved the motion of the earth to be an apparent physical truth that the very soul of copernicus the first inventer of that opinion

as to this later part of the world by a happy metempsychosis seems to have enlightned him to the demonstration thereof and this by such unerring axioms and most conspicuous verities that the long embraced

contrary opinions with all the insoluble systems thereunto belonging are quite out of doors and scarce so much as thought of now much less with pristine earnestness defended by any of the most able astronomers of this age
so that had the unfortunate bishop of ratis bone but lived in our more transparent and knowing times he had never dyed a martyr for so sure and sound a truth

nay had saint augustine been contemporary with mr wing his doubt about antipodes had been fully resolv'd
may we not now without vanity aver that he was the restorer of astronomy to this later age and not only so but that he was so happy in his attempts of that kind that he did nothing without success nay conceive may without offence urge it since others far more competent judges of his surpassing abilities than my self have done it before me
mr wing hath performed more in and toward the rectification and perfection of the coelestial motions than all the ingenious mathematical heads in both universities have of late years done and for the same was honoured and had in eminent esteem with most of the best learned in this our british nation

among the many observables in mr wing this we may not omit in his praise and to his eternal honour let it be remembred he was always a loyal person and good subject and in the worst of times when it was esteemed a

crime to be obedient to a lawful prince and sovereign

and so much the fashion to be anarchical and rebellious mr wing was so conscientiously just as always to own his allegiance ac+counting it far better to perform a vow made to god on the behalf of his prince than nimbly and unchristianly to swallow perjury a sin the very heathen would disdain and protest against and although the times he was necessitated to live in afforded him many great and unhappy examples to that unloyal and ungodly purpose yet he still continued his integrity and duty as well knowing that treason against our sovereign is equal to sacrilege against our saviour

indeed mr wing had not only a just and loyal heart but a good and loyal nativity to shew and to signify it
there was when he was born in the heavens a happy trine between the lady of the ascendent and governess of the medium caeli
we know it is as natural for some persons to be repugnant and opposite to government and to their prince or governor as for some children or servants to be disobedient or rebellious to their parents or masters
the reason whereof is perhaps a secret in astrologie and scarce known to the best of artists
it may be worthy thanks to divulge it and it is this

as the gentle and amicable rayes between the lords of the medium caeli and horoscope make loyal and dutiful persons or subjects so their unfriendly beames to each other create

rebels incendiaries and unloyal persons
the ingenious genethliacal astrologer may spare me the trouble of instances he can easily prove the truth hereof himself

albeit mr wing was a man of such admirable parts as you have heard yet he was the least admirer of his own abilities of any man in the world but still industrious to improve them
his desire was so strong after study that he even neglected himself for it's sake and for the great contentment he took therein
and though his attainments were great yet was he known more to lament and bemoan his defects and imperfections than any way to boast of his skill
he was no way ostentatious but on the contrary very humble and had nothing of the pharisaical temper or humour but like the laden ear in harvest still bent his head downward and with the peacock more often look'd upon his feet than his plumes being ever observed in all company to give unto others the precedence or right hand which perhaps did not inherit the hundreth part of his understanding and knowledge

but now although he was of so a temper and disposition and never apt to begin quarrels or contentions with any man yet hath it been his fortune against his inclination to be engaged in differences he having been by some ambitious and troublesome persons publickly abused in print by two especially

who have after their heaping upon him undeserved reproaches in an impudent and shameless manner made use of his works to dress and furnish out their own and this without crying peccavi or seeking of a reconciliation from him
to signifie

which hard measure from his unexpected as well as undeserved antagonists he hath in his nativity mars an angry planet lord of his seventh house posited in virgo retrograde in the twelfth angle which hath signification of scandal and detraction
and the moon cum cauda draconis and in quadrate of mercury in the seventh house a place denoting publick adversaries strifes and contentions apt and proper arguments hereof as any astrologer must needs understand and acknowledge
more plain and speaking testimonies of the malice of enemies cannot in any nativity be found as if mr wing had been born into the world on purpose in matters of controversie to encounter men of brutish principles and conditions

howbeit it is eminently known that mr wing was of courage sufficient and capable for to resent an injury and would upon any good occasion be so just to himself and to the truths that the world was made partaker of by his happy pen and pains as to give his enemies to understand he did not wear his soul without him who ever did

that had the grand significators of his nativity strong but could easily

vindicate himself from their causless cavils and scomma's and their want of ingenuity and charity towards him

and when beyond reason provoked he did accordingly with a spirit of soberness reply unto those his antagonists who were so bold and daring to attempt the lessening of his unblemish'd fame and reputation to do that which was indeed impossible and therefore spare their names make way thereby for the advancement of their own
he also hath the virgins spike ascending and the moon with the stars of apollo

and could not from thence but have a great spirit and be readily apprehensive though not revengeful of injuries and would therefore in cases of difference only endeavour to acquit himself but not calumniate his adversaries
and therefore we may say of him as it was of another in a like case non silet silet he might be said to be silent and passive toward his enemies in respect of revenge but not in regard of reproof
and surely herein he is no more to be ceusured than the harmless worm for turning again when it is most churlishly and injuriously trod on

nor was mr wing singular or alone in partaking of the malice of enemies or of being unworthily traduced
mr wing saviour who had the same

ascendent with him was so served before him
the brightest sun attracts the basest and most envious exhalations
the great

hippocrates had a thessalus to oppose him and divine homer met with a momus and zoilus
and we know that there are as many nebulous and in the english sphear as there be glorious and shineing ones
no truth in heaven or earth but hath its
no day without its shadow or diamond that wants it foyl
never was any person famous for any thing yet but as he met with favourites so he found detractors
and what excellency can we name or think of that hath been free from opposition or interruption and therefore it is no wonder that a man so popular as mr wing hath met with his share of affronts and abuses it should rather have been recorded a miracle for him to have missed them
but mr wing was too great a philosopher and too good an astrologer to be concerned or troubled at such vanities
it was a satisfaction to him sufficient to know that he had justly and fairely demonstrated and advanced the truth of what he studied and therein discharged a good mind
and he having met with the approbation and thanks of the most judicious and knowing for his great pains and industry looked upon the ignorant and false attempts of his adversaries to be too sinenless to impare his worth and their hatred too imbecil and truthless to torment or discompose him

he appeared first upon the theatre of the world in the two and twentieth year current of his age

beginning then to write and print his annual books or almanacks and as a fit direction for the favouring of such a purpose the sun then came ad sextilem ueneris in tauro she being governess of his ascendent and one of the almutens of his geniture and the sun the grand patron of publick fame and glory located in septimâ domo the great angle of business and action
and that which is as remarkable together with so favouring a direction he had a very auspicious revolution for that year as you may behold by the following scheam thereof

figure revolutio solis ad punctum radicis

mercury april


moon vac ad quadrine jupiter sextile sun saturn


in this coelestial figure you see the lords of the horoscope and medium coeli are in their sublimities or exaltations and in a short quadrate to each other equivalent to a sextile and the one of them in trine to the and the other casts the same aspect to the undefined span alphabet or eleventh angle and royal

the lady of the ascendent at birth as there is almuten of this revolution and herein returned to her radical place casting a friendly sextile to mercury the patron of learning and books in the seaventh house and a trine to the nineth and ascendent
it is in all respects a most admirable position of heaven and most properly agreeth unto the happy and immortal effects of this natives pen

indeed mr

wings writings found a most excellent welcome into the world among all sorts of ingenious persons even so great and happy an one that at length in that year wherein fifty thousand of his almanacks have not sold or gone off the company of stationers as have been credibly informed had esteemed it but a year of an indifferent sale
so universally spreading was this persons fame he beginning to write under so happy and favourable a revolution and direction
and these his annual books or almanacks he continued twenty eight years together thereby making an addition to his former reputation but never growing less

or loosing of any his once purchased honour
he still gained ground but never lost any and not only his almanacks but his other more laborious writings also met with a very happy entertainment and success so that in

truth all persons that have printed and sold his works as well as those that have bought and read them are debtors to his memory and pains
and the and printer as well as the astronomer must mourn the unhappy loss of mr wing

but now mr wing was not only a good man and singular good artist but he was a kind and loving neighbour· and for his temperate and sober behaviour and demeanor was infinitely beloved of all those he lived among as well of the more rustical and unpolished sort of people which generally look upon astrologers as conjurers and mathematicians as as of those of the best quality and breeding obliging the latter by his ingenuity and industry in science and the former by his humility and readiness at all times to do them good
so that the meaner sort of people were always ready to serve him and the better sort of persons

to assist and encourage him in any of his studious attempts
he was a serious cordial friend and hard to be removed in affection when once he had settled it upon any man and when he was necessitated to be an enemy being naturally so great a lover of peace and friendship it was as great a trouble to him

as the knowledge of letters was pretended to be to a noble roman when he came to signe

the death of any offendor
in his greatest provocations and from the very worst of his enemies as am informed he would admit of a reconcilement upon the easiest terms imaginable he ever loved to preserve amity and friendship and to crush or banish enmity and hatred

he was likewise known to be a most careful and loving husband and a kind and indulgent father as appeared both in the prudent government of his family in his lifetime and by his disposeing and ordering of things at his death for the good of his relict and children that they might not after his decease turn wolves and tygers each to other as in too many very good families for want of such care and foresight it is god knows too frequently seen and when past remedy too vainly lamented

lastly mr wing was a man so naturally made for action and so much abominating remisseness and dulness that to follow his employments he often hazzarded his much to be prized health he having for near thirty years together been constantly upon business riding early and late in all kinds of weather wayes and seasons which sine dubio was the propinquate cause at length of a very great hoarsness which began to seize

him violently in the beginning of the year of his age it being a year climacterical which hoarsness was after some interval of time attended with a consumption and catarrhe whereof in the moneth of september
and the twentieth day thereof when the moon was in an opposition of saturn he ended all his tedious labours and travels with this his terrestrial pilgrimage and so receiving an exchange to a better life is now at rest with god

behold how the heavens were posited in the revolution of the year of his death as you may see in the following sceam

herein you see the lord of the ascendent and lord of the eighth house are applying to a conjunction and this upon the cuspe of the eighth house in the radix and not only so but they are both of them in a hateful opposition of mars and in quadrate aspect of saturn and the lady of the ascendent in the radix is in this figure returned to the place of saturn and oculus tauri who were radically placed in the house of death
saturn

also is by direction as well as position promittor of death in this nativity
all which are as so many trumpetters of this natives approaching fate which he instead of being daunted at welcomed with a great deal of chearfulness even to the very last
and indeed no man that hath lived well and uprightly done good in his generation as mr wing had done need be affraid of death or of the knowledge of the time thereof
it was a blessing that

holy david prayed for and that st paul desired and although it may be the sinful mans terror and torture to know it it is the just mans joy

the direction that cut off life was the sun to the body of saturn viz the meeting of the hylech and anareta in an anaretical place thus proved

if the learned ptolomy may be credited as indeed why should he not if he speak truth when he sayes aphor

that those persons who have libra or aries ascending

at their birth shall not need the envy of others to bring them to their ends but be the unhappy cause of their own deaths

although believe and all the world knows and is satisfied that mr wing was not felo de se as lawyers speak being of better principles than to commit a violence upon or against himself yet am convinced that in a charitable and just sense he made the aphorisme good
for we know his soul was so set upon business as before you have heard that he laboured not only beyond his strength even till the last but against the opinions of his physicians not that he conceived in so doing he any way did hasten or accelerate his death but because he hated idleness being a man of so unwearied a fancy that he was active and working to the last and had not strength and vigor first left him he had never left his employment for he dyed labouring even in the middest of his business as well as his years

the worthy albohali tells us that if the significators of death in any nativity shall be in domibus vel exaltationibus suis a malis liberi erit mors ejus in parentes et proximos suos
and so true we find his words for they take full place in mr wings nativity that as mr wings life did not cross or contradict the influences of the stars neither did his death
for he as the holy patriarch jacob dyed among his relations received an honourable interment

on the death of so many eminent astrologers and mathematicians and particularly on the expiration of mr vincent wing
our mirth and pleasures leave us for a space while sighs and tears usurp upon your place behold the wounds the stars do give their friends the fates spare none may bring about their ends
first they force loyal neve resign his breath next learned fisk compel to yield to death then the great oughtred in a goodly age his part being done they hurrey off the stage culpeper follows the physicians foe all astrologians surely are not so
and painful booker too they take to's rest
angels themselves subscribe mortuus est
but death not satisfied unless he work a sure famine in astrology and make the world with his massacres ring hath last of all remov'd laborious wing
sure death turn'd courtier will not be deny'd the thing he covets though the best man dy'd
ah cruel tyrant what ill hast thou done to bless'd urania her scarce risen sun must set before it the meridian mount what shall we now of fair urania count she could have spar'd thee quacks fools good store and traitors full as many more which tribe thy hungry stomach might suffice in taking them thou'dst sav'd urania's eyes

but at her friends to cast thy envious dart

at once strikes blind and dead her eye and heart
no more astrologers since these are gone trouble your serious skill or thoughts upon poor mortals life and death your period's set and the alchocoden that governs it must veile to th anareta all your pain cannot from it the meanest minute gain

tis natures privilege to be severe and let her reign triumphant in her sphear

courteous reader

in the foregoing discourse you are informed of the death of the person of mr wing but his fame that is still surviveing and this not only in his own laborious pieces emitted into the world in his life time but in a son he left behind him who bears his own name and is so far inclined to his fathers studies that he hath for this present year
wrote his undefined span alphabet or almanack and by gods blessing intends the annual continuance thereof

DISCOVERY OF THE FRAVDVlent practises of IOHN DARREL Bacheler of Artes, in his proceedings CONCERNING THE PRETENDED POSSESSION and dispossession of William Somers at Nottingham: of Thomas Darling, the boy of Burton at Caldwall: and of Katherine Wright at Mansfield, Whittington: and of his dealings with one Mary Couper at Nottingham, detecting in some sort the deceitfull trade in these latter dayes of casting out Deuils.
We may not do euill that good may come of it.
Dum per mendacium tenditur vt doceatur fides, id demum agitur, vt nulli habenda fides, Aug. ad Consentium.
THe feate of iugling and deluding the people by counterfeyt miracles, hath been as auncient, as it hath beene in all nations of the world, wherein the Egyptians were growne so expert, that their sect of inchanters durst challenge God his embassador in working of wonders, vntill they were shamefully foyled at making of Lyce.
As these were mated by a silly vermine, so the rable of Bell his priestes tooke as foule a fall, whose grosser wits could deuise no better way to purchase an opinion of deitie to their God of flies, then by fayning, that his omnipotencie lay in infinite eating, pretending that his Godhead was able to consume as much in a night, as two hundred men.
These had a publike ayme, the countenancing of false religion, by a face of deitie, falsly drawne vpon stockes and stones, for a priuate end of a priuate person.
We haue a notable president in the Symon Magus: the drift of whose feyned miracles in bewitching the people, was to be reputed [undefined span alphabet] a wonderfull man, and to be pointed at with this Euge, [undefined span alphabet]; this man is the power of Almighty God.
Adde vnto these, Numa Pompilius his feyned Nimph, Socrates his Genius, Sertorius his Hynde, Mahomets false conceyted Doue, we shall find the tract of all to bend to one of these two endes: eyther gracing of false religion by this graceles feate, or the raising of their own greatnes in the opinion of the people.
The great Impostor of Rome, maister of this facultie, hath so led the world in a string, by this Legerdemaine: bewitching by his counterfeyte miracles, the mindes of the ignorant, giuen to adore al, that they doe not apprehend in the weakenes of their sense, as he doth now proclame by one of his Herauldes with open mouth.
Nemo vnquam haereticorum miraculum edidit: none but he and his schollers can cogge a miracle kindlie, and hee and his Priestes can dispatch a miracle as easily as a squirrell can cracke a nutte: a miracle in the bread, a miracle in the wine, a miracle in holy water, a miracle in holy oyle, a miracle in our Ladies milke, a miracle in the asses tayle, a miracle in Lampes, candles, beades, breeches, ragges, bones, stones, omnia stultorum miraculorum plena, nothing done in his religion without a miracle and a Vice.
And that which passeth all, the least bone of a canonized Saint, (traitor Sainct Campion forsooth), hath more force in it sometimes to cast out a Legion of Deuilles, then the name of Iesus, then prayer, fasting, inuocation of the Trinitie, Exorcising, coniuring, and Maries reliques, Crosse, holy water, and all.
And would to God the Pope could vaunt of this tricke alone, that none but hee and his were seene in this mistery: and that there were not risen vppe amongst vs schollers, not out of his schoole, but of his occupation as touching this point, who, (vpon what ayme, leaue to God their conscience, such as it is), whether vpon Symon Magus his [undefined span alphabet], to seeme to be great in the peoples eyes: or the enchanters pride, to crosse God his gouernors in the church, who professe not this prettie feate: or the Bellites conceit, to grace an idoll of their owne idle braynes: or of an impious simplicitie, holding it lawful to lye, cogge, and fayne, so as it bee to a good ende, and (as their fauourites tearme it) to the glorie of God, haue taken vpon them to bee deepely seene in this misterie of deuilles.
And one especially aboue the rest, hath played his publike prize in this iugling science, casting out more deuils by prayer and fasting after a good dinner, perhappes at after nooone, then wee reade that euer any of the Apostles at so full a season did.
Which being now discouered to be but a pure play, containing two principall parts, of a vice and a deuill, there hath beene deuised two miserable shiftes to helpe him off the stage, that he might not be hissed at of all the world.
One, that this action (like the day of iudgement acted on a stage) though fayned in it selfe, yet procured reuerence and feare in the simpler and looser sort, whilest the imaginary Deuilles seemed to stand in such awe of the worde of God: the other, that to cast out a Deuill, is no such great matter, as men make account of, being but mirandu~ no~ miraculum, in the nature of a wonder, and not of a miracle.
The former is borrowed from a Champion of the Popes, who to vphold the shop of his forgeries and lies in an Apologeticall treatise: sticketh not to affirme this impious rule: honesta docendi ad pietatem nunquam potest esse ratio inhonesta: So as a mans meaning be good and religious, it skils not, though his meanes be bad and impious.
singular foundation to vphold the Pope his and to make religion a pageant of Puppittes.
It was peraduenture at the first, a supposed good entent to deuise the fearefull fire of Purgatory, the least sparkle whereof, is of more tormenting force, then all the fiers that be in the world: that men might bee more feareful, of committing small sinnes.
And so likewise the painting of Almighty God like an ancient Philosopher, with a graue long beard, and a booke in his hand, that the boyes might haue a reuerend impression of his fatherlike wisedom: voluntary pouerty whippings, pilgrimages, images, worshipping of reliques, and adoration of the Crosse, and the blessed Budget of all the Pope his pedlary trash, is blanched ouer with as faire a face of good intent to the glorie of God, as this iugling mistery of casting out deuils.
Open but this creuise in the dore of the church, that ill may be done to any good end: you shal haue religion like a Homers Ilias, a fardle of fictions, a bundle of lies.
God is truth, will be worshipped in spirit and truth: all falshood and forgerie are of the Deuill, and as opposite to truth, and consequently vnto God, as death vnto life, and darknesse vnto light.
Saint Austine his resolution is of so high a pitch in this point, as he saith plainly it is not lawfull to dissemble for the safetie of a mans soule.
And the heathen Philosopher in the fourth of his Ethickes, speakes better Christianitie in this case, then our iugling diuines [undefined span alphabet] a lie is simply bad, and simplie to be condemned.
The second shift is as silly as this is sinfull, that to cast out a Deuill is but a wonder, and not in the nature of a miracle in deed.
What dull conceites had the rulers of the Iewes, that they could not see this slie sillie shift, to depraue the miracles of our sauiour Christ, and to tell the people there was no iust cause they should belieue, that our Sauiour was the sonne of God, in doing such mightie miracles among them: the chiefe one whereof was casting out Deuilles, by reason that action was but Mirandum non miraculumÂ· a strange thing for silly people to wonder at, and not a miracle to enforce them to belieue.
But they not able to denie the euidence of the miracle, put it vpon Belzebub, alledging that it was done by the Prince of the Deuilles.
Our Sauiour pointing at the hand that did the deed, telles them that it was no other power then the finger of Almighty God: secluding both the arme of nature, and helpe of the Deuill, from this diuine action.
And if our can point out a finger equall to the finger of God, and challenge as good interest in it, as our Sauiour Christ did, or his Apostles, they shall easily obtain the credite of effecting a miracle.
There is a place in the last of S. Marke, wherein they mightily please themselues, and taking it as a rod of defence to maintaine their cause, it proues in handling, a serpent that deuoureth them vp.
The words are these: These signs shal follow the~ that belieue in my name: they shall cast out deuils, and shal speake with new tongues, shall take away serpents, and if they shall drinke any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them, they shall lay their handes vppon the sicke, and they shall recouer.
doubt not but they are wise enough to keep themselues warme, and to deny ioyning issue out of this place, but rather take example from a giddie brother of theirs, who conceyting a warrant out of these wordes for proofe of certaine brainsicke conclusions, that hee helde, made this his issue, that if hee tooke downe and it did him no hurt, that then his positions should bee receiued as the Oracles of God: which hee doing accordingly, and for a little time, not feeling any harme to insue, was rauished with a wonderfull iollitie of this his strange tryall.
But his pittifull Metamorphosis was as quick and strange: for as soone as the poyson came neere vnto his hart, he roared, yelled, and raged exceedingly, and in this miserable torment ended his life.
VVe will not be so hard taskmaisters, as to put them to this tryall for their extraordinarie gifts, but will set them vp an easier rest.
Let them with all their iugling driue out a melancholicke spirite, out of any poore soule in Bedlame, let them lay their handes vpon those that are troubled with the dropsie, sciatike, or the gowt: let them recouer sight to the blind, or limmes to the lame, and wee will giue eare vnto their application of that scripture.
But if they bee vnfaithfull in those lesser mites, who will trust them in matter of their greater treasures? These giftes are acknowledged by the fathers, to haue shined in the Apostles time, and in some fewe ages after the Apostles: but alwaies with this note, as the learned hold, in ijs qui dono miraculorum claruerunt, in such as were euidently indued with the gifte of working miracles.
Touching the nicenesse of the difference betweene Mirandum miraculum, both tearmes spring from one roote of wonder or maruell: an effect which a thing strangely done doth procure in the minds of the beholders, as being aboue the reach of nature and reason: and not onely God his supernaturall actes done in the lande of Egypt, are called maruailes and wonders, but one and the selfe acte done by the finger of God, hath diuers and sundry names giuen it in diuers and sundrie considerations.
of Saint Iohn are generally called [undefined span alphabet], as being significations of his omnipotent power.
of Luke, shewed vpon the man taken with the palsie, is called by the multitude that beheld it, [undefined span alphabet], because it extended the compasse of their conceit.
of Iohn, Christ his deedes are called [undefined span alphabet], for their power in amazing the vnderstanding and sences: and so [undefined span alphabet], as causing men to gaze: [undefined span alphabet], as procuring wonder: [undefined span alphabet], for the excellencie of their cause: and [undefined span alphabet], for their wonderfull effect: and the very same names that are giuen by the holy Ghost to the actes of Christ, effected by the onely finger of God, are attributed to false prophets in the
of Marke, and to Antichrist himselfe in the second of the second to the Thessalonians, [undefined span alphabet], in all power and signes and wonders.
And therefore, whether they iuggle vnder the colour of [undefined span alphabet], or [undefined span alphabet], the feate is alike, and the deceite all one.
Thus much for a taste of legerdemaine: open the curtaine, and see their Puppettes play.
This first Booke containeth the number, that are pretended to haue beene dispossessed by M. Darrel: The occasion that his practises were called in question by her Maiesties Commissioners for causes ecclesiasticall at Lambeth: The indeuours of M. Darrels friends to extoll both him and his doings: The great vncertainty of the grounds, whereupon M. Darrell, and all other casters out of Diuels doe in these daies build their skill, and of the shifts they haue, not onely to set themselues on worke, but also to maintaine their credites, when their iugling is called into any question.
The number of such persons as are said to haue beene dispossessed by M. Darrels meanes.
IOhn Darrell a Batchelor of Artes, being about the age of three or foure twentie, but then no minister (as hee saith) did take vpon him about thirteene years since to cast, first one Diuell, and afterwards (vpon a pretended repossession) eight Diuels, out of a maid neere seuenteene yeares old in Darbishire, named Katherine Wright.
The historie of this feate he himselfe writ, and gaue one copie of it to the Ladie Bowes.
M. Darrell for ought that is generally knowne, was out of worke.
Notwithstanding (besides the publishing of the said historie) he omitted fewe occasions to intimate, what he had done touching Katherine Wright.
Insomuch as growing thereby into some smal credit with the simpler sort: he became very peart and proud in that respect.
Something to this purpose he confesseth in these words: Some thought that did glorie somewhat too much in the action of casting forth Diuels.
The cause of which his glorie inlarged it selfe forsooth in the saide yeare
when pretence is made that he cast a Diuell out of a boy in Burton, called Thomas Darling, then about the age of foureteene yeares.
Of this worthy acte a booke being penned by one Iesse Bee a Sadler in Burton, the same was first contracted by one M. Denison a minister in that countrey: and then after it had beene seene and allowed by M. Darrell, M. Hildersham, it was published in print: and was commonly sold and called for, by this title, vz.
The booke of the dispossessing of the boy of Burton.
What M. Darrell tooke vpon him after this his second exploit, it may bee surmised by glorying in the first.
But yet his name was not so famous, vntill the
of March next following, when being sent for into Lancashire by one M. Starkie, vpon the report of M. Dee his Butler, who told the said M. Starkie what M. Darrell had done at Burton, he dispossessed in the said M. Starkies house seuen persons, at one clap: vz. Iohn Starkie, Anne Starkie, Margaret Hardman, Elianor Hardman, Ellen Holland, Margaret Byrom, and Iane Ashton: which Iane is since fallen into the hands of certain Seminarie priests, and hath beene caried by them vp and downe that countrey, to sundry recusants houses (as certaine idle men were wont to carry puppets) and by her cunning counterfaiting of certaine fits, staying of herselfe by the secret directions of the said Priestes, she hath gotten God knoweth what: they by such lewdnes haue wonne great credit, but her Maiesties subiectes, haue in the meane time beene shamefully abused.
Of the dispossessing of the said seuen parties, there is a booke that runneth from hand to hand, penned by M. Dicons preacher at Leigh (as M. Darrell saith,) and iustified from point to point (although very childishly) by one M. More, a preacher of his owne allowance: who ioyned with M. Darrell in the pretended dispossessing of the said seuen.
Touching which booke there are added (in the end of the said historie of the boy of Burton these words, vz. Shortly you shall haue the true storie come forth of those seuen in Lancashire, that were possessed with vncleane spirits, and all seuen deliuered at one time by this man: meaning M. Darrell, as he himselfe confesseth.
But of all that euer M. Darrell dealt with, William Somers one of Nottingham supposed to be possessed, is the youth, by whom (as it seemeth) he hath wonne his spurs in the opinion of many, especially women.
He had in his hands nine of the former persons, but two or three daies, and so dispatched them: but Somers stucke in his fingers almost fiue monethes.
When hee began with Katherine Wright, he dealt but rudely (as he confesseth himselfe) vnskilfully: Marry by the time that hee tooke Somers in hand at Nottingham, which was in Nouember
Of his proceedings with the said Somers, and of the said Somers fits, diuers treatises are come abroad.
M. Darrell himselfe hath written a short historie concerning that matter, and besides that, an Apology of his own penning, for the iustifying of himself is lately come out in print: there is also published printed an other booke in his behalfe: intituled, briefe narration of the possession, dispossession, repossession of W. Somers.
Lastly, M. Darrell hauing played his tricks so long with William Somers, that all which the boy could doe began to grow very stale in Nottingham, then hee attempted to practise with Mary Cooper the sister of Somers, and there was no remedie but she must be possessed: and so he set a new matter on foot, which was very zealously followed by certaine wiues in that towne: but before it came to any perfection M. Darrell began to be disclosed for a dissembler.
Touching all these (sauing those in Lancashire examinations haue beene taken, and aswell by the confessions of the parties, as by diuers other circumstances, it doth plainely appeare, that all which was done betwixt Darrell and them was meerely counterfeyted.
But for as much as his greatest peece of cunning and legerdemaine was imployed chiefly about Somers, (as hauing then learned more then before) and that his practises with that boy, were and still are so greatly insisted vpon by him his friends, that nothing will be digested that is spoken against them: the greatest paines haue bene taken to find out the packing that hath beene vsed in this cause.
The occasion why M. Darrels dealing with Somers was called into question at Lambeth.
IT is a common vse when any men for matters of crime are called into question, (and especially if they are like to fal out hardly with the defendantes) to discredite the witnesses, to slaunder the plaintifes, and to take exceptions both to the Iudges, and to their proceedinges.
And hereof the course that M. Darrell and his frendes haue held, may be an example: hee the said M. Darrell being charged with diuerse notable cosenages, in pretending by hypocriticall sleightes to cast out Deuils.
The particulars to this purpose in euery point are not here so pertinent: some of those onely, that concerne the occasions pretended, why M. Darrell hath bene called into question, and the persons that by authority haue looked into this cause, and the witnesses that haue beene produced in it, are meete to bee considered: For they doe argue a great combination or associatio~ to haue wrought some great worke, if they had not by fortune stumbled in their way.
Some giue it out, that the detecting of one Alice Freeman to be a Witch, was the occasion through M. Freeman her kinsmans dealing, that William Somers was first accounted to be a counterfaite.
Others of deeper insight, say that the Deuill himselfe enuying the happy estate of Nottingham, by meanes of M. Darrels preaching there, did raise vp that slaunder of possession to hinder it.
There be also that giue it out (iustly as they say) that the first occasion of mouing this euill (forsooth) against M. Darrell, was his threatning the iudgements of God against such Pastors, as let their people perish for lacke of instruction.
And one seemeth to ascribe the hard conceite held by some, of M. Darrel, to the want of faith, telling vs that when Lazarus was raised from the dead, some were hardned, and complayned vpon our Sauiour.
The same fellow also reporteth, that it hath been giuen out by one, a great man amongst them (meaning her Maiesties Commissioners for causes ecclesiasticall) that seeing they haue taken it in hand, they will haue the credite of it: insinuating that otherwise M. Darrell might long before this time haue beene discharged, as a man blameles and innocent in those pointes whereof he was accused, and to strengthen this grosse vntruth, that appertayneth, (as shameles as the other,) where hee sayeth that there hath beene running to the Court, to forestall the Lordes and Ladyes of Honor, and to hinder the preferring of petitions in M. Darrels behalf, to the Lordes of her Maiesties Priuie Councell.
Who haue troubled the Lordes and Ladies in that matter, they know best themselues: but indeed some haue done it, peraduenture to haue had Darrels practises smothered vp, for the auoiding (forsooth) of such slaunder, as might otherwise fall vpon the Ministery.
But aboue all the rest, that is a substantiall conceit, that M. Darrel cannot be endured, because he hath such a feate in casting out Deuils as many other men want.
It cannot be endured (sayeth the author of it) that those kind of men, which are accounted the of the world, should be thought to haue such interest in Christ Iesus, as that by their prayers and fasting, hee should as it were visibly descend from heauen, and tread downe Sathan vnder their feet: whereas other men, who account themselue, more learned, excellent, and wise, then they, do not withall their Phisicke, Rhetoricke, pompe primacie accomplish the like.
But God hath chosen the foolish thinges of the world, to confound the wise, and the weake thinges of the world to confound the mighty.
place indeed of scripture aswell applyed, as that in the fourth of S. Mathew, Hee will giue his Angels charge ouer thee, least at any time thou shouldest dash thy foote against a stone.
But to insist no longer vpon these vanities and foolish surmises: the true occasion, that moued her Maiesties saide Commissioners to intermeddle with this Impostor, (wherewith his confederates and companions are so much grieued) and to proceede therein as they haue done, was as followeth.
William Somers hauing counterfaited himselfe to be possessed, dispossessed, and repossessed, and held on that course successiuely, for the space of about three moneths: he did at the last, being got out of M. Darrels hands, confesse and auow, that all hee had done that while, was but dissembled: shewing to the Maior and Aldermen of Nottingham, how he had acted all his former fittes.
Herewith M. Darrell and his friendes were greatly moued, especially when they perceyued the boyes said confession to be so generally belieued, as that there beganne an amongst the neighbours: some holding with M. Darrell, and some against him.
To meete therefore with this mischiefe, and hearing (as it is supposed) that the Archdeacon of Darby had written to the L. Archbishoppe of Canterbury touching that matter, it was thought good to vse some preuention, and to procure a Commission from the L. Archbishop of Yorke for the examination of such witnesses, as should be produced in the behalfe of M. Darrel, to proue that Somers had not dissembled.
The saide Commission obtayned, exceptions were taken against it, because all the Commissioners were addicted to M. Darrell.
Therupon it was renewed, and vpon one M. Euingtons motion, some were made Commissioners to ioyne with the rest, that were known to haue disliked of M. Darrels proceedinges.
When the time came that this second Commission was to be executed, (certaine persons hauing beene examined,) Somers was brought before the Commissioners, who shortlie after his comming, fell to the acting of some of his fittes in their presence, vpon a former Compact and Agreement made betwixt him and others, before he came thether.
Herewith, al that fauored M. Darrell, began to reioyce, and to runne abroad into the towne, telling their friends with great ioy, that Somers was now found to haue been no dissembler: but the rest that had held a contrary opinion, they were greatly rated and checked: insomuch as when some of them came out of the house where the Commissioners sate, they were not onely rated at exceedingly, but to one of them by the throwing of a stone some violence was offered.
Thus M. Darrell and his friends triumphed for nine or ten daies, hauing by the direction of the said Commissioners Somers amongst them againe, who playing his old trickes denyed that hee had dissembled.
But this their ioy ended, when the saide dayes were expired: for Somers, by the direction of the L. Chiefe Iustice of the common Plees, was no sooner gotten againe out of the handes of M. Darrell and his friendes, but of himself he confessed (as before) the whole course of his dissimulation, and why he had affirmed to the said Commissioners, that the fittes acted before them were not counterfaited.
With this alteration M. Darrell and his adherentes were greatly troubled; the partes taking on both sides beganne to be more violent, and the town became to be extraordinarily deuided, one rayling vpon an other, at their meeting in the streets, as they were affected in that cause.
The pulpets also rang of nothing but Diuels, and witches: wherewith men, women, and children were so afrighted, as many of them durst not stir in the night, nor so much as a seruant almost go into his maysters celler about his businesse without company.
Fewe grew to be sicke or euil at ease, but straight way they were deemed to bee possessed.
Briefly such were the stirres in Nottingham about this matter, as it was feared the people would grow (if they were not preuented) to further quarrels and mutinies, or to some greater inconuenience.
Hereof the L. Archbishop of Canterbury being aduertised by the said L. Chiefe Iustice, and others, did thinke it in his wisedome very necessarie to call for M. Darrell by vertue of her Maiesties Commission for causes Ecclesiasticall, who being accordingly sent for, appeared before him and others at Lambeth: from whence hee was committed to prison, by reason of his absurde and vntrue (but yet very confident) assertions: giuing thereby iust occasion to suspect, that he was but a counterfaite: and order was taken for the further examination of that cause, according to the vsuall course by the lawes of the Realm, in such cases prouided.
The issue whereof was, that vpon the hearing of M. Darrell, and the depositions against him in open Court, before the Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, the L. Bishop of London, the Lord Chiefe Iustice of her Maiesties Bench, the L. Chiefe Iustice of the Common Plees, M. D. Caesar M. of the Requestes, M.D. Bing Deane of the Arches, and M. D. Stanhope: (the Earle of Shrewesbury and some other gentlemen of good note, with many others being present,) hee the said M. Darrell, was by the full agreement of the whole Court, condemned for a counterfeyte: and together with M. More (his companion, who tooke vpon him to iustifie the said Darrell, and had otherwise greatlie misbehaued himselfe) they were both of them deposed from the Ministery, and committed to close prison, there to remaine vntill order were taken for their further punishment.
The iustice of which sentence will sufficiently appeare by this treatise, inforced (as it were) to be published by the casting out of certaine Pamphlets, which do so much impeach it: suffering none to escape their bitternes, that haue dealt against M. Darrell (but yet for the truth) in this cause.
Vpon M. Darrels first committing, within a while after, some matters beganne to break out against him, besides the Confession of Somers: it remayneth to note how many of his friendes were kindled, and what choler they shewde by deprauing, not onely of such lawful courses as were taken to finde out the truth, but also of those persons that had to deale therein: notwithstanding they were oft desired but to stay themselues, and suspend their iudgements, vntill the cause were througly examined, heard, and determined.
Diuerse of them came vp to London, in secret corners exclaimed bitterly against his committing to prison, iustifying by many deuises his former actions.
Those who had dealt in his behalfe at Nottingham (thinking by his imprisonment themselues to bee touched) ceased not to solicite great personages in his behalfe.
Hard wordes were giuen out against such as had M. Darrell in examination, and the rest also of her Maiesties said Commission.
letter was written to the Lord Bishoppe of London, threatning him with the authority of great persons, who were said (but falsly) to haue taken vpon them the defence of M. Darrell: and resembling both him and another of Honor (as the author termeth them) to the two false Iudges that condemned guiltlesse Susanna, and to the Scribes and Pharisees that tooke councell together to put Christ to death But of that which is more worthy of reprehension in them, it might in some sorte haue beene borne with (as the common Prouerbe sayeth) for loosers to haue their wordes: so for them to haue taken their pleasure in speaking what they liste, whilest the matter did hang in suspence, and was but in the way of triall.
But now seeing that after long deliberation M. Darrell hath been iudged for a dissembler (as is before expressed) which might haue satisfied any reasonable men: it cannot but be thought a verie outragious course, to continue such like their bolde and rayling lewdnes, and with some increase thereof to publish their choller and stomackes in printe, giuing forth at their pleasures some other written copies containing the like stuffe.
They that imagine Somers was not possessed, but did counterfaite (sayeth the Preface) doe by consequence deny the soueraignity of our Sauiour in the action.
And one of the written Pamphelites: To deny the worke of the Deuils, and God in the dispossession of Somers, may seem to be after a sort, to denye them in the Gospel.
Indeed if M. Darrels credite were as good in saying, that Somers was possessed, and that by his, and his fellowes meanes he was dispossessed: as the Euangelistes and Apostles ought to bee, when they tell vs of diuerse that were possessed in Christes time, (whom our Sauiour did not onely himselfe deliuer, but gaue power also to them and others to doe the like,) then their said Collections were pertinent.
Otherwise many false knaues from time to time, hauing deluded the people with hypocrisie, and pretence of casting out deuils, it is a suggestion of Sathan for any to collect, that thereby the saide actions of our Sauiour, his Apostles, are in any sort blemished: but let them rayle on.
The proceedinges against M. Darrell and others, (sayeth the Author of the briefe Narration) Haue beene verie violent.
And againe, being brought before the seate of Iustice, they who at the same time gaue gentle audience to Papists, Arrians, Atheistes, and Blasphemers, wold not permit M. Darrell to speake anie thing almost in his owne defence.
And the Author of the Preface to M. Darrels Apologie: M. Darrell hetherto could not obtaine so much, as patient audience, or any iudiciall course of proceeding.
Againe, Their proceedinges haue beene indirect, contrary to the royall commaundement of her Maiestie, her lawes, and lawfull Liberties of her loyall Subiectes.
And againe, the saide Narration: his Iudges became parties, pleaders, and accusers: Againe also M. Darrell and M. More are now imprisoned for giuing testimony to the truth.
Again, let men beware in crediting false rumors against those holy men of God, who doe now, or shal hereafter suffer in this holy cause.
Againe, the Deuill and his Agents conspire in one complotte, against this mightie worke of the Lord Iesus.
It seemeth so euidentlie to bee the finger of God, as though we our selues should forsake it, as with Iudas to betray our Maister: Yea with Pharao set our selues to obscure it: Yet the Lord if he loue vs, wil rather make the stones to cry and vtter it, yea the deuels themselues to acknowledge it, then it shall be hid.
Again, when they haue had their swinge but a little, they will be ashamed of their owne folly: Againe, would aduise them that slaunder this worke, and persecute the seruants of God without cause, to take heed, least they be found euen fighters against God.
He that sitteth in Heauen sees their deuises, and laughes them to scorne, and they and all their conspiracies, plots, slaunderinges, and reuilinges shall consume like a snaile.
And againe, when the Saduces, Gallenistes, and Naturalistes of our time haue considered of the matter, wee will expect some new obiections.
In the meane season let him that is filthy, bee filthy still: but doe Sathan what hee can, wisedome shall bee iustified of her children.
These are children indeed: To what ripenes in rayling thinke you they wil grow, by the time they be men? It is true that there is a wisedom: whose children by their outward appearance they may well bee accounted.
If yee haue bitter enuying &c. reioyce not, neyther bee lyers against the truth, for this wisedome descendeth not from aboue, but is earthy, sensuall, and diuellish.
And S. Iude commeth also as neere them: who maketh it a particular note of false seducers, to speake euill of them who are in authoritie.
Now as concerning the witnesses that are vsed in this matter: the said Wisedomes children are mightily (as it seemeth) offended with them, and with such also as did examine them.
The witnesses (saith the Preface) that voluntarily offred to be deposed for the truth, were repulsed: all partiall persons that could bee thought vpon, were presently called.
Also the Narrator: These proper Commissioners refused such as were willing to iustifie the truth vpon their oathes, they picked out whom they listed, and wrote what pleased them.
And a third writeth thus to the Bishop of London, concerning himselfe, others in authoritie.
You condemne the guiltlesse seruants of God, vpon Somers bare report onely, excepting eight or nine false witnesses, who say, that they thinke in their consciences, that the said Somers did but counterfait.
If these fellows words or writings deserued any answere, the truth in this behalf were sufficient to stop their throats: being so wide open sepulchers of falshood and corruption.
But their tongues are their owne, and of likelihood they are determined if they can (as it is in the Psalme) to preuaile with them.
Howbeit (as by the way, and a little to cleare these calumniations) be it obserued, that the whole number of witnesses produced against M. Darrell, being about fortie and foure: thirtie and foure of them at the least, are such as had some extraordinary liking of him, were reputed to be his friends and fauourers.
Of the said fortie and foure, twelue were vsed by Maister Darrell himsefe, as witnesses examined to proue Somers no dissembler: foure of them being ministers.
Seuen came vp to London, to iustifie his proceedinges, and to procure him what friendship they could: three of them also being ministers, and eight others not reckened before, are preachers or graduates.
If there be some three or foure of the whole number, that suspected more falsehood in M. Darrels proceedinges then the rest, yet are their depositions, but vnto some one or two pointes, and those not greatly materiall.
The matters of importance, whereby M. Darrels iugling is detected, are deposed by his chiefest friendes: and therefore there is no such cause of clamor, why they should either bee charged with partiality, or falshood.
If they haue in any sort offended, it may be thought to be rather in concealing something that they knew, then in deuising of any vntruthes against him.
And for the writers of their examinations, they were men lawfully authorised in that behalfe, and publike Notaries, sworne to deale truely in such causes.
Besides, euery of the said examinations is subscribed with the hand of the partie examined, and of the Commssioners who tooke the same.
But it is an easie matter to speake euil, for such as are of the diuising and slaundering humor: who care not what they either say or write, so they thinke it may serue their turne.
Why these men should thus be ouercarried, that nothing will content them, but that when they haue not what they would, they will thus lay about, may be a question.
There is mention made before of a combination or association: the intent whereof may be left at large.
Some little gesses may be made, so they be not inforced as concludent.
M. Darrell being taken at Nottingham by some, for a time, to be a maruellous bugge to scarre the Deuill, was in the heate thereof chosen by certaine in the towne, to be their preacher, hauing otherwise no lawfull authority in that behalf.
This choice, one of his friends termeth such a comfortable calling, and so warrantable, that very fewe ministers in our Church haue had the like.
The author of the briefe Narration, to draw vs peraduenture from further dealing with M. Darrell, or at the least to shew his humor, propoundeth in his margent this question, vz. Whether a Bishop and Elder be all one in scriptures.
And M. More, (as cunning as M. Darrell in dealing with Sathan) saith: that the faith of the Church established vnder the Pastors and Teachers &c. shall bring forth this fruitÂ· namely, to cast out deuils: &c. Hereunto it may be added, that many, who haue taken M. Darrels cause most to hart, haue beene noted heretofore as fauorers of the ouerworne Consistorian faction.
Of these premises it wold peraduenture anger them, if any should collect, that in all likelihood, seeing neyther by learning, nor sufficient arguments, they could heretofore preuaile, for the setting vp of their Presbyteriall conceits, they thought to supply their wantes therein, by this deuise of casting out Deuilles.
It were to bee wished, that at the last they would leaue this giddines, or at the least touching the matter in hand, to thinke more reuerently of those that be in authoritie, and not persist as yet they do, in the further iustification of M. Darrell, their weakenes therein being more apparant by those pointes that follow.
How M. Darrels friends haue set out the pretended dispossessing of William Somers.
AS M. Darrels fauourers haue beene bold to slaunder the persons and courses held for the detecting of his cosenages: so are they very earnest (by extolling aboue the rest, the pretended dispossessing of William Somers to iustifie therein his course and proceedings with him.
The briefe Narration tearmeth it, maruellous worke of God: a glorious worke greater then which hath scarcely beene heard of, eyther in our dayes, or in the dayes of our forefathers for many yeares.
The truth of this worke (saith he) shall breake forth as a light, and the glory thereof as a burning lampe.
And againe: it is a candle lighted by God vpon a candlesticke, in the hart center of the land, that the beames thereof might shine forth, and giue light to all the Realme.
And another of his friends in his said written treatise telleth vs, that, All who loue the Lord Iesus in sincerity, must be careful to cleare publish this worke, as the wonderfull worke of Christs owne finger.
And againe: it may be iustly hoped, that it will proue a matter of as great consequence, as euer any such worke that the Lord gaue extraordinarily, since the time that he restored the Gospell amongst vs, and as profitable to all that truely professe the Gospell of Iesus Christ.
These fellowes (we see) are maruellously rauished with this superexcellent wonder.
But marke how truely one of them speaketh: peraduenture against his will.
It will proue (forsooth) to be a matter of as great consequence, and as profitable, as euer any such worke, since the restitution of the Gospell amongst vs.
For the pretended dispossessing of the maide of Chester, was nothing els but a ridiculous toy.
M. Darrell himselfe will not say, that Deuils are cast out in such sort.
And like to that was the casting of a Deuill out of one Mildred, the base daughter of Alice Norington, at Westwell in Kent, in the yeare
which for all the goodly pretences that were made by two ministers, Roger Newman, Iohn Brainford (equally to M. Darrell and M. More was confessed in the end to be but a meere cosenage.
It seemeth that practise was one of M. Darrels patternes.
Such a worke also was the very wonderfull and strange miracle of God, (as the title of the booke runneth) shewed vpon a Dutchman, of the age of xxiii. yeares, which was possessed of ten Deuils, and was by Gods mightie prouidence dispossessed of them againe, the
Notwithstanding that the Mayor of Maidstone, Nicasius Vanderscheure, (the minister of the Dutch Church there) and Iohn Stikelbowe (the instrument forsooth, that cast out the said Diuell) with diuers others, did subscribe that pamphlet.
In this number may also bee ranged, the strange newes out of Sommersetshire, Anno
tearmed, a dreadfull discourse of the dispossessing of one Margaret Cooper at Ditchet, from a deuill in the likenes of a headlesse beare.
Hereunto in like manner may be added, the very strange vexation of the maid of Bury: of Agnes Brigges, and Rachell Pinder in London: all of them counterfeite and lewde practises, resembling or imitating the wicked deuises of the holy Maid of Kent: who by the instigation of two false Priestes, Edward Bocking, and Richard Masons (with their associates) tooke vpon her in King Henry the eights daies, to haue maruellous traunses, to the great admiration of the whole countrey: as it appeareth very fully in the Statutes at large.
But why doth M. Darrels friend omit the dispossessing of Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, the vii. in Lancashire? Are not their deliuerances of as great consequence as that of William Somers? Surely they are thought so: the profite which is expected, that will insue of all those foure strange works, is, the punishment due to such lewd cosenages: that others hereafter may eschue such wicked practises.
But let vs heare M. Darrels said friend tell his owne tale, how the dispossessing of Somers will proue so profitable: It will so do (saith he) by confounding all Atheists, who thinke there are no Deuils: by conuincing the Papists, who hold, that our Ministers can not dispossesse any: by discouering of witches, Sathan by Somers hauing disclosed many: by teaching vs in Somers, that Gods prouidence reacheth euen to children: by incouraging vs to fast pray often, the same being of force to cast out Deuils: and by the generall furtherance it giueth to the Gospell, whilest thereby we may learne, (saith M. Moore, or his companion, one M. Dicons, writing in deed of the vii. in Lancashire that it is Gods word which we now preach, euen the sword of the spirit which slayeth Sathan.
It is not amisse, that the Papistes are driuen to the Deuill, to seeke after his testimonies for the confirmation of many things: As to winne a better estimation, greater liking of their Sacrament of the Altar: their praying to Saintes: their fustie reliques: their coniured holy water: their Agnus Dei: of their shauelinges, and hypocriticall Exorcists, they beare the world in hand, that the Deuill can not indure any of them, and that he doth not therein dissemble, (as seeming to be troubled with them,) per astutiam, through craft thereby to deceiue, but per infirmitate~, in that he is not able for their holines (indeed) to abide them.
And let them comfort themselues (seeing they wil not bee reclaimed) with that vncertaine distinction, and many other such like stratagems of Sathan.
But for ministers of the Gospell, or any other, (that would seeme to fauour it) to send vs to M. Darrels dealing with William Somers, for the confounding of Atheists, for the conuincing of Papists, or for our assurance, that the worde of God is truely preached amongest vs, must of necessitie bee helde by the grauer sort, to be a meere madnes, or a frensie at the least.
What the casting out of Deuils amongst other miracles in the scriptures can effect, that hath beene long since wrought, through the expelling of them by Christ himself, and by his Apostles: and their miraculous working therein continueth still the like force for the confirmation of our faith, whilest the same is daily offred vnto our consideratio~ by the holy Ghost in the word of God.
It is not here meant to discusse, what we ought to thinke touching the continuance of the power of casting out Deuils: Howbeit for as much as M. Darrels friends do so oft alledge Tertullian, S. Cyprian, S. Ambrose, S. Austen.
S. Chrysostome, with Prosper, &c. it is not amisse to heare what Komnitius (writing against the Councell of Trent saith of this point.
In times past it was a peculiar guift to cast diuels out of mens bodies by the voyce of man, and power of God.
And the same guift continued in the Church, in the times of S. Cyprian, S. Ambrose, S. Augustine, S. Chrysostome, of Prosper: Obsessi in templu~ adducebantur, saepe co~munibus ecclesiae precibus liberabantur: The possessed were brought into the Church, and were oftentimes deliuered by the common prayers of the Church: posteÃ  illud donum. &c.
If M. Darrell haue againe obtained it, let him make much of it: when he can bring vs one, whom we may know to be in deed possessed, both hee and his friendes may haue herein a fuller resolution.
How M. Darrell is made a fitter instrument to cast out Diuels, then many other.
IT is commonly said, that no excellent work is performed but by excellent men.
The dispossessing therefore of W. Somers, being a matter so admirable, M. Darrell must of necessity be some rare person.
In which respect, as before they haue tolde vs, of glory, of lights, of lamps, shining beams (rese~bling belike the supposed dispossession of Somers, to the glory that appeared in the transfiguration of Christ, thereby to iustifie that lewd action) so are they as lauish, in extolling and commending of him: ascribing vnto him many extraordinarie vertues, to couer (if it might be) his counterfaiting and cosenage.
And herein they follow the beaten tract of such like diuell casters: For euery man is not fit for that misterie.
The Exorcising Rabbins amongst the Papistes doe tell vs, that in Christs time, there were some being infidels, that cast out deuils, hauing no authoritie giuen them by Christ so to doe: our Sauiour granting that power then (they say) to Christians onely.
Now of Christians, some were Apostles and Disciples, and some were Lay people, as they tearmed them.
Both which sorts were made fitte persons to cast out diuels: the one by vertue of their calling, being ecclesiasticall: and the other in respect of their holy conuersation.
The layetie had this power (they say) but a while, except it were vpon some extraordinarie occasions.
And therein they giue the chiefe place to women, naming S. Brigit, S. Katherine of Seen, S. Genouefa, and S. Anatolia: that sexe (as it seemeth) hauing a generall disposition, to like wel of Exorcismes.
After the Apostles time (they say) that the power of casting out deuils, which the Apostles and Disciples had, was made an ecclesiasticall office, to bee bestowed by the Bishops, vpon such as were termed Exorcists: whom in our language we may call Coniurors.
But it is to be obserued, that for this assertion, Thyraeus the Iesuite (an especiall Author of M. Darrels, and his fauourers) hath no scripture for his warrant, neyther doth hee pretend any.
Touching these Exorcistes, as amongst the Apostles there was a Iudas, the rest of them hauing puritie of life, annexed to their guift of casting out Deuils: so (they say) it hapneth now that some Exorcists, although they be of wicked conuersation, may notwithstanding, (albeit more rarely) cast out deuils by vertue of their office, giuen them by their Bishops: whereas generally those who are fitte to vndertake that worke, must be also of an Apostolicall conuersation: whereupon it commeth that the Iesuites, and popish Antizans doe tell vs in good sooth, that their Exorcistes must be men of very humble spirites, voide of all leuitie: such as are greatly inflamed with the loue of God: persons indued with hope and assurance, to cast out such spirites as they meddle with: (of which hope and assurance the Apostles being sometimes destitute, as they say, did attempt in vaine to cast out one deuill:) men also, whose consciences are not burdened with any mortall sinne, but for pietie and innocencie of life, are persons of especiall note.
And one reason alledged for this purpose, is very Logicall: Contraria Contrariis pelluntur: they ought to be as good, as the deuill is bad, that can cast him out of his possession: marrie men thus qualified, no maruaile though they tell vs, that Sathan cannot endure them: that the spirites themselues haue complayned, how they haue bin torme~ted, Sanctoru~ praesentia, with the presence of such Saintes: that the deuils sometimes haue beene glad to leaue their possession, not daring to abide their comming vnto them: that the deuils that haue presumed sometimes to abide their presence, haue beene so dressed, as they durst neuer afterwardes returne to those places againe, where they met with them: and that therefore it is not to be wondred, that when me~, who are troubled themselues with Sathan, or haue their children, friendes, or seruantes so vexed, doe seeke after such holy persons, to be deliuered by them.
Indeed our experience doth make it no wonderment, as the Iesuite sayeth.
And herein M. Darrell hath had great lucke: For when hee was not past two or three twentie yeares old, he was supposed to be such a man, as could doe somewhat in that art.
When Katherin Wright was first troubled, shee was by one M. Beresfordes aduice sent to M. Darrell at Mansfield, and to one M. Beckingham, to be comforted, or cured of her infirmitie: because (as he sayeth) hee had heard M. Beckingham to bee a man of note, and M. Darrell a man of hope, for the relieuing of those that were distressed in that sorte.
Thomas Darling being troubled (forsooth), some of his friends sent to Witches.
cunning man was also procured to come vnto him, who tooke vpon him within a weeke to cure him.
Afterwardes Alice Goodridge the supposed Witch, tolde them that the boy would not mend, except they sought for helpe, saying, they might haue helpe inough.
But at those wordes, the Booke sayeth, that the deuill stopped her throat, or else peraduenture, (the author meaneth) she would haue tolde them, what kinde of helpe they should seeke for: this is but a coniecture.
The certainety hereof is, that M. Walkeden (the boyes grandfather) hearing how M. Darrell had helped Katherine Wright, procured him to come to Burton, to helpe Darling: and the reporte was before he came, that one should come from Ashbie, that would giue the boy such directions, as without doing him any hurte, should relieue him.
When the seauen in Lancashire were troubled, M. Starkie going to M. Dee for his counsel, was aduised by him, to call for some honest and godly preachers, with whome he should consult.
M. Dees Butler telling them, what one M. Darrell of Ashbie had done at Burton, M. Starkie and M. Dee resolued vpon him, and writ their seuerall letters vnto him, for his repaire into Lankashire: howbeit in this their course, there was a great imperfection.
For Edward Hartley the Witch, did afterwards tell M. Starkey, that no one man could do his children and the rest there any good, it was too great a worke: but there must be two or three at the least, with feruent and hartie prayer.
And here you may obserue a little kinde of Wonder.
For M. Darrell not knowing (for ought that appeareth) what the saide Witch had affirmed, did of his owne accorde, (after hee was sent for by M. Dee and M. Starkie, acquaint one M. Moore with the matter, and obtayning him to be his companion in that action, fulfilled and deuils wordes, that two at the least must vndertake that worke.
By the time that Somers had his fittes, M. Darrell was of some name: and besides hauing a sister in law in Nottingham, one Mistresse Wallys, shee was not what a man her Brother was: and thereupon being vrged by certaine women, she writ to M. Darrell the letter, importing (sayeth Mrs. Gray that the Lady Zouch, she her self, and diuers other Gentlewomen, requested him to come ouer to see the saide Somers.
Hetherto it may appear, how M. Darrell hath bin sought vnto, which argueth that he was thought by some to bee such a man, as if he met with the diuel, he was able to curb him.
But whether his giftes, and conditions be like the better sorte of Exorcistes, as they haue been described out of Thyraeus, that remayneth to bee declared.
For hee doth not challenge any power to cast out deuils by vertue of his ministery, and therefore it must be his Holines, or nothing, that must support him.
Vppon M. Darrels calling into question, for his dealing with Somers, and the rest, there hath bin great indeuour vsed to colour the same by an extraordinary co~mendation of his carriage, conuersation.
man would think that Thyraeus had bin perused, he is made so sutable vnto his Exorcistes.
One Serson an Attorney with one Serson a Preacher, M. Walleis and M. Small went publikely from house to house in Nottingham, to procure handes (as Small confesseth) vnto a certificate, or testimoniall, concerning his the saide Darrels vnspotted behauiour.
The like indeuour was also vsed, for the procuring of such an other testimoniall from Ashbie.
Others in like manner of his friendes haue published in writing: that he abhorreth all kinde of counterfeyting and dissembling: that he is not giuen to any desire of vaine glory: that if hee had plotted anie such matter as is layde to his charge, hee is not of disposition to haue concealed it, &c.
An other sayeth, that he is so farre from cosenage or deceite, as that hee hath himselfe beene deceyued: that hauing begunne the study of the law, he perceyued therein such great corruption, as he gaue himselfe to the study of Diuinity, that so hee might serue God, and keepe a good conscience: that being a Minister, he preached for the triall of his guifts, hauing no ecclesiasticall liuing: that such was his integrity, as it hath not been beard of, that euer hee did labour for any Church liuing: that hee might haue had once a Personage, if he would but haue saide, could be content to accept such a thing, if it were offered me, which he durst not do for displeasing of God: that he is a man so farre from couetuousnes and ambition, as if he would haue giuen a little vnderhand, hee might haue had a Benefice or two, worth fiue or six hundreth poundes yearely: that he is so farre from pride and vaine glory, as hee hath not beene knowne to disdaine the company of any honest man, though neuer so base: that hee is indeede earnest and bolde, but it is when hee hath a good cause, as the seruantes of God, Peter and Iohn, with most of the faithfull Martyrs of Christ haue beene: and that his aduersaries hauing sifted him, through the whole course of his life, can finde nothing against him.
What is reported of M. Darrell, shall not now be confuted, his honesty, he may be sure will neuer hurt him: You may onely bee aduertised, that his saide friend forgetteth himselfe in affirming, that M. Darrels life hath been so searched into.
For true it is, that diligent care was had, and commandement giuen accordingly, that touching his conuersation, otherwise then appertayned directly to his pretended course of casting out deuils, there should not any one point be inquired into: neither was there, as by the actes in record it may appeare, and as it is supposed, M. Darrell will himselfe confesse.
But to come more directly to the point in hand.
Although these M. Darrels said pretended vertues, doe make him answerable to the popish Exorcists: yet that forsooth is not sufficient, but Thyraeus the Iesuite, must in effect tell vs so.
For M. Darrels saide friende, setting downe certaine reasons, why God hath made him the saide Darrell, rather then many, (otherwise more wise, and learned then he) an especiall instrument in these daies, for the casting out of diuels, maketh this one, vz. in that hee is such a man, as is qualified according to Thyraeus the Iesuites saide rules, set downe by him in his Booke, de Daemoniack, Cap.
Out of which Chapters, that which Thyraeus requireth in his Exorcistes, this man alledgeth to bee manifest in M. Darrell, sauing that amongst some other thinges, hee omitteth, whether M. Darrels conscience bee burdened with anie mortall sinne.
Otherwise for many of the rest, naming them, vz. that hee is a man of good reporte: one that despiseth the world: not couetous: of an humble spirite: not ambitious: not proude: zealous of Gods glory: much giuen to prayer and to the seruice of God: and of an especiall confidence in the Lord: these graces (he sayeth) God hath bestowed vpon M. Darrell: and therefore by Thyraeus rules, were there nothing else to the contrary, he might be thought to bee a well furnished, and verie complete Exorciste.
But one thing is reported of M. Darrel, which passeth the rest, maketh it probable, (you may not doubt) that God hath giuen him an especiall Grace aboue all other Exorcists, now a dayes to expell deuils.
For they say, that after a sort, he hath forsaken house, landes, and all for Christes sake: which being an Apostolicall resolution, why should he not haue that Apostolicall gifte graunted vnto him? Indeede one is as true as the other.
For will you know, how hee hath forsaken all to follow Christ? Hauing two or three houses, and a little land in Mansfielde and else where, left him by his Father, he sold the same, by his owne confession, as dearely as he could, and since hath liued vppon the money, being (as one of his friendes sayeth) fiue or six hundreth poundes.
How the deuill in regarde of this M. Darrels Holines, could not abide his presence, will appeare in the next Chapter.
In the meane while, it may well be saide without offence, that if to sell land, and liue vpon the money, be to leaue all and follow Christ, and a fitte note of one that can cast out Deuils: wee shall not want men of that trade: many Vsurers in England will proue good Exorcistes.
But touching his honesty, iudge thereof, when you haue perused this whole Treatise.
Now his skill to cast out Deuils, resteth to bee a little looked into, together with his doctrine, whereupon hee doth ground it.
V. How M. Darrell knew William Somers, and the rest to bee possessed.
HEe that will take vppon him to cast Deuils out of men, must first know whether they haue any in them, or else he may peraduenture loose his labor.
Forasmuch therefore as M. Darrell and M. More, are the persons of note amongst vs, that haue entred into this course: it is a point of good iustice, that they be heard with some assistance of their friendes, to speake for themselues.
M. More sayeth, That in the Apostles times, those that had the gift of casting out Deuils, had also an other praecedent gifte: first to discerne the spirites, which gift was called, Discretio Spirituum.
But M. Darrell is of an other opinion, and that an absurde one.
For he affirmeth that Christ did not ordaine any meanes, to know who was possessed in the Apostles time: but left that to bee discerned by the manner of their fittes.
And so framing his iudgement accordingly, hee sayeth, that the onely meanes, whereby now men are discerned to be possessed, are the signes which are mentioned in the Scriptures.
But M. More is bolde againe herein to dissent from him.
For although he conceyueth, that the said gift named Discretio Spirituum, is taken away, and that now it is to bee knowne in some sorte, who are possessed, by the signes mentioned in the Scriptures: yet hee will not haue those signes, the onelie meanes, but addeth Prayer vnto them: saying, that the saide signes, and prayer are now the meanes ordayned by God, to succeede, and continue in place of the other: And hee ascribeth so much to prayer in this worke, as without it, hee accounteth the other parte, to bee verie vncertaine.
By prayer (sayeth hee) men that are acquainted with the saide signes, may ordinarily obtaine such measure of Gods holy spirite, as that they may be able truly to discerne, whether the partie, in whome the saide signes doe appeare, be indeede possessed or not.
pretie matter, the gifte of discerning of spirites is left, and a measure of Gods spirite is brought vs for it.
It would bee knowne what that gifte was: If not a measure of Gods spirite, to discern betwixt counterfeytes, and such as were indeede possessed.
It being obiected, that forasmuch as very many worthy, and godly men, notwithstanding their knowledge of the signes of possession mentioned in the scriptures, and their earnest and feruent prayers, haue beene verie greatly deceyued by sundry counterfeyts, it seemeth probable, that he M. Darrel might be also deceiued in iudging the vii. in Lancashire, and W. Somers to be dispossessed: one by way of preuention answereth, that M. Fox, and others, might easily be deceyued therein by Sathan, as not hauing read (as hee supposeth,) Bodinus, Wierus, Mingus, and Thyraeus, that write of deuils, as hee himselfe, M. Darrell, and the rest of that Crue haue done.
But M. More answereth after an other fashion: saying, that it might bee they vsed the saide meanes indirectly, whereas hee and M. Darrell vsed them directly: that they were assured, that God gaue them power, so to vse them: that such their assurance grew from their full perswasion, that the saide parties were possessed: and that it pleased God to endue them with that full perswasion, because they had vsed the said meanes so directlie.
In which his circular folly, euery point is more vncertain the~ other, euen that of their full perswasion: because it is supposed, that they dealt like a couple of cosening hypocrites, (at the least one of them) making shew of that which was not.
But what will M. Darrell say to these pointes, thus confidently set downe by his fellow M. More? They tend so much to his greater worship, as ten to one he will wind himselfe one way or other within the compasse of them, that so he may therin part stakes with him.
And yet it wil be hard for him so to do: For he holding (as it will appeare hereafter) that the wicked, and such as are not reconciled to God, by a true iustifying faith, may in these daies (the power of doing miracles being ceased) cast out diuels: eyther he must say, that they haue no meanes left them to discerne who are possessed (which were absurde): or confesse, that the prayers of the wicked may preuaile as much to that effect (as M. More affirmed theirs did): or els leauing M. Moore to his prayers, hee is driuen to his owne hold, that the onely meanes whereby the possessed may be discerned, are the signes of possession mentioned in the scriptures.
Amongst which signes (he insisting so much vpon them, keeping so many Audits of them) it is much meruailed, why he still omitteth the breaking of fetters and chaines mentioned by S. Luke.
If it had appeared without all iugling, that no iron chaines or fetters could haue held either Somers, or any of the rest, (they hauing beene fastned with them, as the keeper of Newgate could haue vsed them) he had said something.
But to proceed with M. Darrels onely meanes, being the signes mentioned in the scriptures: Of them he telleth vs there are eighteene, but in his Apologie hee nameth but sixe of them: crying, gnashing of teeth, wallowing, foaming, extraordinarie and supernaturall strength, and supernaturall knowledge.
To the which the rest may be added after his vnderstanding: casting into the fire, casting into the water, tearing, pyning, falling to the ground, nakednes, the partie striking of himselfe, abiding in no house but about graues, mountaines, and in the wildernesse; dumbnes, deafenesse, fiercenesse, brusing the bodie of the partie when his fitte endeth.
It may be maruelled why M. Darrell and his friends, talking in their late pamphlets so much of the signes of possession, they still omit those two, or at the least speake not of them directly, which serued his turne in place of iugling stickes, and were the principall groundes, whereupon his legerdemaine did consist.
The one is, that whosoeuer is possessed, is in his fittes altogether sencelesse, and depriued for the time, both of his vnderstanding, and memorie: the other, that albeit such as are possessed doe in their fittes many thinges, as if they were not possessed, and also make very reasonable answeres to such questions as are propounded vnto them, yet it is not they, but the Deuill in them, that doth both aunswere and doe them.
But it may be they are now ashamed of these pointes: for it will bee hard to find any authour amongst the grossest sort of the popish Exorcistes, or else where, that euer maintained these assertions.
The lunatike in the scriptures, was in his fittes dumbe: but it can not bee shewed that hee wanted the rest of his sences.
In some others also it is plaine, that Sathan did speake at some times, as when the wicked spirites desired our Sauiour, that they might go into the heard of swine: but it cannot be thereof inferred, that the partie possessed with those spirits, did neuer in his fittes, speake or doe any thing of himselfe.
Besides, it is a generall position, that Sathan possessing ones body, hath not to doe eyther with his vnderstanding or memory, otherwise then by troubling his fancy.
But let it be supposed, that these two were in the number of M. Darrels eighteene onely signes of possession, mentioned in the scriptures: yet some of his owne friends will therein also oppose themselues against him.
For if the signes mentioned in the Scriptures, bee the onely means to discerne who are possessed: what must become of many other signes, that Mayster Darrell and his friends doe so much ground themselues vpon, as the running in Somers flesh, of a lumpe as bigge as a Mouse, &c. which must eyther vpholde their reputations, or els they are in daunger to fall to the ground? For the preuenting therefore of this inconuenience, and for the inlarging of their boundes to worke in, the author of the Briefe Narration, not contenting himselfe with Maister Moores prayers, nor allowing of Maister Darrelles iudgement in this point, hath learned of the said Iesuite a new shift.
Seeing (saith he) that men in this matter are growne more incredulous then heretofore, it hath pleased God, (besides the signes of possession mentioned in the Scriptures) to giue other signes also more free from cauill, to make his glorious works most apparant and certaine.
And hereof he bringeth for an example one of Somers pretended fittes in these words: all the signes mentioned in the Scriptures, might more easily bee deluded by this conceit of counterfeyting, then this moueable swelling.
If men were here disposed to take exceptions, it might bee demaunded, when God was pleased to giue these new demonstratiue signes of possession, and vnto whom, and how he signified the same: or whether this conceit doth not proceede from some of the popish vnwritten verities? In deede hee relyeth in this deuise vppon Thyraeus the Iesuite, and quoteth for it his booke De Daemoniacis.
Howbeit, if hee follow him too farre, as hee hath already brought him from the Scriptures, so will hee quite dash both him and Mayster Darrell concerning their olde and newe deuised signes of possession: leauing them no assurance at all, how they may discerne who is possessed.
For the Iesuite is flat, that neither the confession of the partie, nor his wicked life, nor his fierce conuersation, nor his barbarous and beastly outcries, nor his terrible countenance, nor the priuation almost of all his vitall functions, nor his continuall diseases, and inward torments, incurable by the Phisitions, nor the hauing of the Deuill oft in ones mouth, nor for a man to consecrate himselfe to Sathan: nor the suffering of more grieuous torments, then those do indure that are in deed possessed: nor for one to seeke to kill himselfe: nor for a man, giuing himselfe to the Deuill to bee presently snatched away by him: nor the reuealing of secrete matters: nor the knowledge of strange languages, neuer learned by the partie: nor extraordinary strength: nor all the signes, that appeared in such as were possessed in the Euangelistes, are sufficient vndoubted signes (saith he) that the partie in whom they appeare is possessed.
If therefore M. Darrell will be a right Exorcist, after the current fashion amongst the Iesuits, he must learne other signes of possession: and Thyraeus (a man so oft alleadged by his friends) will not be dainty to teach him.
For (saith he) these are the signes indeed, whereof there is no doubt, vz. when the parties that seeme to bee possessed, refuse to call vppon God, or to pray to Saintes, or to pronounce the word Iesus: or to receiue some prayer or Psalme: or when they tremble, are afraid, grow impatient, or blaspheme at the applying vnto them of the relique of any Saint, or of a picture made in waxe, called an Agnus Dei, or at the making of a crosse vpon their foreheads, or at the bringing vnto them the sacrament of the Altar, or when they can not abide the Priestes, that doe exorcise them, or at the least doe indure them very hardly.
His similibus signis Daemones prodi dubium nullum est: there is no doubt (saith he) but that by these and such like signes the Deuils are disclosed: to be, it may bee added in these that practise them, either as possessing them, or at the least seducing them.
For what a ridiculous illusion is this, to reiect vpon simple pretences, so many strange signes of possession? some of them carrying with them impossibilities by the course of nature: and to bring such vnto vs, as may so easily bee counterfeyted, by euery youth or girle within an houres instruction.
Here M. Darrels friends will peraduenture say in anger, that both he and they are as farre from these fooleries, as any that haue disliked of their proceedings.
Howbeit, by their leaues, they may in some sorte therein bee checked.
For there is pretence made to the like effect, that the Deuils that M. Darrell and M. Moore met with, could neither abide them, nor the word of God: which are two of Thyraeus infallible signes of possession.
When the parties that are pretended to haue beene possessed at M. Starkies house in Lancashire, did heare that they two would come vnto them, they are made to haue said thus to their particular spirits: vz. Thou naughtie lad, thou makest vs sicke, for thou knowest the preachers will come shortly, meaning (saith M. Moore himselfe and M. Darrell.
Likewise, when they were come to the said M. Starkies house, and that three of the said parties being all of them quiet in the kitchen, sent for seuerally to come to them into the hall, they appeared no sooner before them (as the historie reporteth) but hauing made low courtesies vnto them, they fell downe by course into their fits.
And the third of them, comming in with both her handes closed to her face (not being able (as it seemeth) to indure the brightnes of the godly mens countenances) vttered these words: am come to councell before am called.
At Nottingham also M. Darrell so vsed the matter with Somers, as the boy being in a fitte, when M. Darrell one night left him, crying, now he is gone: now he is gone: now blacke coate is gone: all that were present (saith Robert Cooper thought M. Darrell to be so godly a man, as that the Deuill was glad, and reioyced when he was departed.
This conceite had of him, may also further appeare by the Ballet maker, concerning Somers description in his fittes, of the sinnes that raigned in Nottingham, whereof hereafter, who rymeth thus: But when that M. Darrell came, the Deuill was vexed with the same: His limbes he rackt, hee rent tore, farre worser then he did before.
And touching the other pretended signe, it was an ordinarie course held by the keepers of the boy of Burton, that when any straungers came in, that desired to see him in his fits (as men desire to see monsters and straunge beastes play their trickes): then they would reade some parts of the Gospell by S. Iohn: and straight way (forsooth) the Deuill must shew himselfe, by casting the boy into some fitte.
This reading, they tearmed, the offering of battaile or combat to Sathan.
When one Phippes, a seruant of M. Brinsleyes, supposed himselfe to be possessed, and that the Deuill entred into him, as hee thought in the likenesse of a Nitte: Maister Darrell perswaded him, that hee was not possessed: because (saith he) you receiued comfort, when you heare the word of God read, or any prayers, or godly exhortations: whereas William Somers, and others being possessed, were at such times greatly troubled and tormented.
Againe, M. Darrell and M. More, beginning to exhort some of those in Lancashire, two of them presently cried out mightily with outragious roaring and bellowing: the note vpon that place saith thus, though the Deuill had dissembled hid himselfe in both these (for they had beene quiet sundry daies) yet now the word of God findeth him out: he can dissemble no longer, but must needs shew himselfe.
By these two sleights borowed from the popish Exorcists they did greatly inueagle seduce their beholders: the first tending to the setting out of themselues, to be had in admiration, whilest they were supposed to be such deuout men, as Sathan could not indure: the other, vnder pretence of magnifying the scriptures (which seeke no falshood to winne them commendation) they vsed a colour to ouershaddow their lewdnes, when at their pleasures, they might thereby without lesse suspition, begin and practise their fittes or pageants.
Assuredly it may well be supposed, that if this their course had not beene met with in time, we should haue had many other pretended signes of possession: one Deuill would haue beene mad at the name of the Presbyter: an other at the sight of a minister that will not subscribe: an other to haue seene men sit or stand at the Communion: and so as it had pleased our good Maisters the Exorcists.
And that this coniecture may not be thought to be a vaine collection, you shall see how stinted (as they tearme them) and read prayers, are notablie foyled.
M. Moore telleth vs: that when a prayer was read out of prayer booke, in the hearing of those that were possessed in Lancashire, they, that is the Deuils in them, were little moued with it: but afterwards when M. Darrell, he, with one M. Dicons, did seuerally vse such prayers, as for the present occasion they conceiued: then (saith he) the parties, that is, the wicked spirits, were much more troubled, that is, troubled the parties much.
See, the Deuill was tricte with their conceiued prayers, and could not abide them, therefore such must needs be excellent prayers.
As for read prayers, he careth not for them, they haue no force to trouble him, and therfore who should respect them? But you are detained too long in this matter.
When M. Darrell, with his fellowes, and all other Exorcistes, or Deuil driuers are agreed, (this one position of theirs granted vnto them, that the Deuill may torment a man as much being without him, as within him) can make it apparant vnto vs without their grosse and palpable forgeries: that they are able to discerne who is possessed: then let them tell vs, that they haue dispossessed them.
Of M. Darrels knowledge, who sent the Deuill into Somers, and the rest.
IT seemeth to be a matter very pertinent to the dignitie of an Exorcist, that he bee able to declare who sent the Deuill into his patient.
For men of that trade doe affirme, that sometimes it is God, sometimes holy men, and sometimes witches, that do send them.
To omit their assertions touching God and godly men (although they containe very strange points, and interpretations, as they are propounded, and handled by the Doctors of Deuill driuing) that of witches is now most pertinent.
For all the Deuils that M. Darrell hath hitherto incountred, were sent by them (as it seemeth) into his patients.
Whether witches can send Deuils into men or women (as many doe pretende) is a question amongst those that write of such mattersÂ· the learneder and sounder sort doe hold the negatiue.
Against whom Thyraeus opposeth himselfe, with Thyraerus M. Darrell, that not without very pregnant reasons, if he may be credited.
For he is able to specifie or describe the particular parties that sent their spirites into his patientes, together with their seuerall names, and in what manner the witches did send them.
Middlecub the Familiar spirite of one Margaret Roper of Eckling in Darbishire, did by her commandement possesse Katherine Wright, Alice Goodridge of in Darbyshire, hauing a spirite called Minny, in the likenes of a dogge, parte colored red, and white, did send the same to torment Thomas Darling, hauing first taught her saide spirite, by strayning her own body, and vomiting, how he should handle and vex his.
The seauen in Lancashire were, (as it seemeth) possessed by the meanes of one Edward Hartley, who breathed wicked spirites into them, (as it was supposed) by kissing them.
An old woman meeting William Somers vppon heath, did procure her spirite to enter into him, or by his accepting at her handes a piece of bread and butter, and eating it.
Touching this olde woman last mentioned, M. Darrell for a time was peremptory to the effect specifyed, but since (there falling out a matter contrary to his expectation, wherof hereafter he now affirmeth, and one of his fellowes hath printed it, that an olde woman in Worcestershire, did that stratageme, by sending into Somers a Familiar of hers, called Lucie.
And for Marie Couper (M. Darrels last patient) it was one Alice Freeman of Nottingham, that directed the deuill to possesse her: shee poore woman, suspecting shee had beene with childe, till M. Darrell tolde her it was a wicked spirite within her, that caused her so to swell, would any man desire to haue a question more directly resolued? The onely doubt is to those that be simple men, how M. Darrell came to the knowledge of these thinges.
The Iesuiticall and popish Exorcistes, that holde for this worke of Witcherie, haue but two wayes, (as it seemeth) whereby they know when the spirites are sent by Witches, and the one is the Confession of the deuill, that is cast out, and the other the Confession of the Witches, who threw him in.
And thus far M. Darrell is fully prouided to answere for his skill.
For it was Middlecub the spirite (he sayeth) that tolde him, that Margaret Roper, did send him into Katherine Wright: And touching Thomas Darling, Alice Goodridge confessed, that shee sent her Minnie into him, mistaking him for one Sherrartes boy.
The Booke also of the seauen in Lancashire, doth after a sorte insinuate, that Edward Hartley confessed his sending of seauen deuils into them: But how hee will shifte concerning Alice Freeman, and the foresaide olde woman of Darbishire, and Worcestershire, he hath nothing as yet for ought that is knowne, but VVilliam Somers, and Marie Coupers reports, which his M. Thyraeus sayeth, are not sufficient, although the partyes for the iustifying of them, should offer themselues, ad plagas virgas.
But to helpe him herein, if men may be bold a little with the Iesuite: why should not eyther Mary Couper, or Wlliam Somers, bee aswell belieued, in saying that Alice Freeman, and the saide olde women bewitched them, and by that meanes sent their wicked spirites into them, as Middlecub, who tolde M. Darrell, that Mary Roper sent him into Katherine Wright? For when eyther Thyraeus, or M. Darrell tell vs, that the spirites haue confessed, who sent them: what doe they say in effect, but that the parties themselues told them so? Neither of them both dare say, that the deuils, after they were cast out, did, or doe vse to tel any such matter: but the truth is, that when by their knauery, they haue induced the parties supposed to be possessed, to say that such or such a woman bewitched them: then they tell those that are present, that it is not the saide parties, but the wicked spirites that so confesse who sent them.
And touching the confession of the Witches themselues, that may be left well inough to such learned men, as haue written sufficiently of it.
In the meane while, let M. Darrels foolish conceites be further considered of.
AS there are pretended diuers meanes, whereby Sathan is sent into men, and women, to possesse them: so are there sundry causes deuised, why they are sent.
For example, sometimes they say, they are sent without any respect of the parties offences, into whome they are sent, and sometimes, in regard of their offences.
Now of sinnes or offences they make two sortes: the one Mortall, and the other Veniall; the Mortall are thus recyted.
Infidelity, abusing of the Eucharist, blasphemie, pride, luxuriousnes, enuie, couetousnes, persecution of godly men, disobedience to parentes, slaundering speeches, contempt of religion, for one to curse himselfe to the deuill, to be at league with Sathan, and the contempt of the Sacrament of confirmation.
The Veniall, you must thinke are in number many: these following are reckoned to be of that kinde: Idle wordes, iesting speeches, sporting lyes, immoderate laughing, and such like: For the remission whereof, Non requiritur poenitentia propriÃ© accepta, neque actualis, neque habitualis, neque sacramentalis, repentance being properly taken is not necessarie, neither actuall, habituall, nor sacramentall.
The Bishops blessing knocking on the breast, and a little holy water, will rid a man of them.
That the Deuill is sent into men for mortall sinnes, they holde it cleare: but whether for Veniall sinnes or not, that is made a great question, and Thyraeus resolueth it.
It is most certaine (sayeth he) that Veniall sinnes haue giuen Sathan occasion to possesse men, and they are accordingly deliuered corporally vnto him, pro leuissimis quibusque, delictis, for the least offence that can be committed: very hard cause, that men should be in such a plight for no greater a matter, then a little holy water will wash away.
Now, forasmuch as the spirits that possesse men, haue interest more or lesse in the~, (as some hold), according to the qualitie of the causes, for the which they were sent into them: and will not therefore bee so easilie expelled, when they enter for mortall sinnes, as for Veniall, as it is an especiall parte of the Exorcistes duty (as their rules declare), when they endeuour to cast out the Deuill, to trauell by all the meanes they can deuise, that they may learne the cause of his entrance.
And least any man should thinke, that therein they loose their labours: and for the better iustifying of Thyraeus resolution for Veniall sinnes: both hee and M. Darrell (together with his friendes) doe tel vs verie pretie tales.
The Iesuite sayeth, that the Deuill entred into one maide, because shee was in great loue with a young man, and into an other, for that shee indeuored herselfe to haue a resemblance of Venus picture: and into an other, propter impatientiam, durius prolatum verbum, for vttering a sharpe worde: and into an other, because with some greedines, shee did eate the leafe of a Lettice, (the deuill cleauing vnknown to her, to the nether parte of the leafe,) forgetting to blesse it with the signe of the Crosse.
But hereof there neede no more examples: the doctrine being so plainely set down, that Sathan entreth into men, for the least Veniall sinne: Howbeit if any man desire more, hee may bee assured, that their Legendes will afforde him store of them: and for a new supply, M. Darrell, and his friendes in the meane while, will not herein be silent.
Katherine Wright (forsooth) denying something to Mary Roper, the deuill by the said Maries direction did possesse her.
Afterwardes also, Sathan comming to the saide Katherine Wright in the likenes of a handsome man, that making suite vnto her in the way of marriage, gaue her a piece of bread, shee in taking the same at the deuils handes, and eating it, became to be repossessed.
Wil. Somers had the deuill sent into him, eyther by the old woman of Darbishire, because he denyed at the first to giue her a penny, or by the olde woman of Worcestershire, for that he refused to giue her a which shee much desired.
Why Mary Couper became to be possessed, the cause indeede is not expressed, except it were for dwelling in one house with W. Somers: it being Sathans practise (as M. Darrell saide) not to content himselfe with one in a Family.
For hee meeting Alice Goodridge in a Coppice, did let an escape (as the booke termeth it,) which shee taking to bee done in her contempt, vsed these wordes: Gip with a mischiefe, and fart with a bell, wil goe to Heauen, and thou shalt goe to Hell.
True it is, that M. Darrell (when Somers pretended himselfe to bee in his fittes greatly tormented) did affirme, that hee was not so much troubled for his own sins, as for the sins that raigned in Nottingham.
And yet then he ascribed some parte of his grief, to his singing of wanton and filthy songes: he being a musitian.
For of likelihood, hee hath some other deuise: as that the Deuill may enter into a man for small Veniall sinnes: but being in him, may torment him in many respectes.
bird in a lime bush, the more shee striueth, the faster shee is.
When a man is out of his way, the further hee goeth, the more hee erreth.
And such is M. Darrels case in his groundes, he hath layde to worke vpon, which hath brought him into a maze, that he cannot get out.
Of the meanes alledged by M. Darrell, and others, whereby men are dispossessed.
IT belongeth to those that challenge the skil to cast out deuils, to know the means how it ought to be done.
He were a mad Phisition, that would vndertake to cure a man of the palsie, or of any other disease, that neuer had learned any medicine for it.
As good Phisitions therefore haue fit remedies for their patients to helpe them: so you must thinke of our cunning Exorcists, that they want no medicines for their possessed to ease them.
The ordinary meanes ordayned to continue in the Church, for the casting out of Deuils, M. Darrell maketh to be very ancient.
For he sayeth that it hath beene in the Church, since the fall of Adam.
For hee confesseth that there is no mention in the olde Testament of the institution of that means.
And so of likelyhood; if other of his positions be true, men were possessed from time to time during the space almost of
years, God himself hauing ordayned no way to cure them.
But in saying that the same meanes doe continue now in the Church, that were in vse before the comming of Christ: that, his maisters the popish Exorcistes, will condemne as an error in him.
For one of them sayeth: that the wayes of casting out deuils, in the olde Testament, iam vetustate, si non alia de causa antiquatae sunt abolitae, as being growne in dotage, are now abolished for their age.
If you wil know, what these wayes were, Thyraeus telleth you, one was nomen Tetragrammaton: an other the smell of a certaine roote, reuealed for that purpose to king Salomon: the thirde, the smoake of the hart and liuer of a certaine fish being layde on the fire: and the fourth, the playing of an harpe or citterne, as though Saule had been possessed, (which the saide Thyraeus dare not resolutely affirme,) and Dauids musicke had dispossessed him.
But M. Darrell doth herein differ from the Iesuite, and sayeth: that the meanes in the olde Testament to cast out Sathan, was fasting and prayer, euen the same that yet continueth: therein also differing from his fellow M. More.
For whereas M. More sayeth, that Christ did plainely ordaine fasting, and prayer, to bee parte of the ordinary meanes to continue in the Church, in these words.
This kinde goeth not forth, but by prayer and fasting, thereby shewing the beginning of the said means.
M. Darrel affirmeth, that Christ finding that meanes to be good and godly, did in those wordes but approue it, and so maketh it a secret ordinance of Christ to haue his continuance by way of consequence: As Christ approuing it to be good, did thereby commaund it.
Furthermore, whereas M. Darrell holdeth, that in the Apostles time, there were two sortes or kindes of casting out deuils, the one ordinarie, which was in the Church before the comming of Christ, vz. fasting and prayer, and the other extraordinarie, vz. commaunding of Sathan, to depart in the name of Christ: M. More sayeth, that although hee belieueth that Christ did ordaine fasting and prayer in the saide place of Saint Mathew, to bee parte of the ordinary meanes for casting out Deuilles: yet the same was not a meane to cast out Deuilles in the Apostles time, there being then an other extraordinarie meanes giuen vnto them: and that Christes meaning was, that fasting and prayer, should not be the ordinarie meanes, till after the time that the extraordinarie should cease.
To holde with M. Darrell, that there was an ordinarie meanes to cast out Deuils in Christes time, doth derogate much from the honor of his miracles in casting out Sathan: For the Infidelles might haue surmised, that Christ had done it by the ordinary meanes, hauing vsed the same secretlie without their knowledge.
Moreouer, it may argue the extraordinary meanes to bee superfluous: there being then an ordinary meanes, and that of such facilitie, as will after appeare.
There is great commendation giuen by M. Darrel, in his Apologie of certaine men, (who it seemeth doe fauor him,) that they are learned and reuerend, and of great wisedome and godlines: and indeede, hee sayeth trulie of some of them: howbeit it is thought, that ere it bee long, hee will bee angrie with two of the best of them.
For one of them holdeth, (and of the other hereafter,) that by the saide wordes of Christ: Prayer and Fasting are as effectuall to cure a man, that is sicke of an ague, as to cast out a Deuill: His wordes are these.
am not of their opinion, that thinke the wordes of Christ.
This kind can by no meanes come forth, but by prayer and fasting, doe importe that Christ did ordaine fasting and prayer, as a particular meanes to cast out Deuils, more then to procure mens deliuerance fro~ other afflictions.
It hath beene touched before, that M. Moore accounteth prayer fasting, but a part of the meanes that Christ hath ordained for expelling of Deuils: for that he addeth in the first place, Faith, as it is meere he should doe: although therein he dissent from M. Darrell, as he the said Moore vnderstandeth Faith.
For M. More by faith, vnderstandeth the faith that iustifieth, in these wordes: iustifying faith, hauing annexed vnto it fasting and prayer, is the ordinance of Christ for the casting out of Deuils, for euer to continue in the Church.
But M. Darrell, confessing the necessitie of Faith, in the said ordinarie meanes, saith: that neyther the faith of doing miracles, nor the iustifying faith is therein necessarie: but that the temporary or historicall Faith may suffice.
It being here obiected, that an historicall faith sufficing, (as is before expressed) and that the prayer and fasting in such as haue but that faith, can not please God: it will follow, that the ordinarie meanes which Christ hath left in his Church, for casting out of Deuils as necessarie, is such a meanes as is not acceptable to almighty God: M. Darrell answereth, that the consequence is not good.
And so that point lyeth: but an other may not be left a sleepe.
that the Faith there mentioned, is to be vnderstood to be the faith of doing miracles: that the Apostles were reproued for their weaknesse in that faith: and that if the same had beene strong enough, they might haue cast out the wicked spirit mentioned in that Chapter, ver.
without prayer or fasting: whereby it followeth (for ought that dull men can easily discerne) that M. Darrell holding (as is before mentioned) that place of scripture to be a secret ordinance, for the continuance of fasting prayer, as the meanes to cast out Deuils, and that therein by faith is vnderstood the faith of doing miracles: (which if it had beene strong enough in the Apostles, prayer and fasting had been superfluous): it wil follow it is thought, that the historicall faith will not serue his turne, but that it must be the faith of doing miracles: which must bee vnderstoode for the faith that is required of necessitie, when there is neede to cast out Deuils.
So as if hee want that, hee may (by his owne doctrine) cast his cappe at them.
omit here, that some of good account for their learning, do interprete the prayer and fasting mentioned in the places of S. Mathew, and S. Marke, to bee required in those that are possessed with wicked spirites: and that the forbearing of both, was not any want in the Apostles.
Maister Darrell himselfe doth confesse, that the partie possessed ought to fast and pray, if hee bee able.
Wherein if Sathan hinder him, yet he saith, Almightie God accepteth of his will, and purpose so to do in steed of the deed.
Furthermore, the popish sort do generally require the said prayer and fasting, as a preparation, in the Exorcistes, and not as a meanes: although Thyraeus confesseth, that prayer is something.
For speaking of the meanes, how the Deuill is to bee cast out, after he hath named many, hee is content to giue some little roome to prayer, saying: Oratio quae adhibetur damnari non debet: Prayer, which is vsed in the casting out of Deuils, must not bee condemned.
You see how hardly praier commeth into the ranke of the said meanes.
And it is likewise manifest, what little account they make of the said place in Saint Mathew, to ground themselues vpon, for their casting out of Deuils: (albeit they are as earnest to make a trade and merchandise of it, as Maister Darrell in that they doe not once mention it for that purpose: sauing that they retaine the commanding of Sathan to depart in the name of Christ: which was the meanes that those vsed (saith M. Darrell which had the faith of doing miracles.
Marry besides that, they haue a great number of waies, whereby they vexe and torment Sathan wonderfully in their expelling of him: whereof the scriptures are as silent, as they are lauish.
For example, the sacrament of the Altar, the merites of Saintes, the reliques of Saints, the praying to Sayntes, by saying their letanie: the sprinkling of holy water, the signe of the crosse: the imposition of the priestes hands, the stole which the priest vseth, being laide on the partie: the whipping of the possessed with holy whippes, and the putting of the priestes finger into their mouthes.
Euerie one of these will cast out the Deuill in a mischiefe, (as Thyraeus by sundry pleasant tales, but in good sadnesse doth report:) their legendes being in deed full of them.
Not long before, you heard that these fooleries were reckoned for the signes of possession: and here you see they are (very wisely) made the meanes to dispossesse men.
As if the Phisitions should appoint the signes of diseases for the medicines to cure them.
But suffer the said graue Authour to proceed: for he hath many other things of singular vertues, to terrifie Sathan with, in this great worke: as Vestes sacrae (for their priestes vsually come to the parties in all their massing garmentes and attire) Coerei ardentes, hallowed candelles burning, &c.
And to haue the matter done in a Church, that is a point of good importance: For some Deuilles, that woulde in no wise bee cast out in priuate houses, being brought to the Church, were straight wayes expelled.
But Mayster Darrell very prouidently did preuent this superstitious and erronious conceite.
For vpon some talke and conference at Nottingham, where his faste should bee helde for the dispossessing of William Somers, and some deeming Saint Maryes Church there for the best and meetest place, hee woulde in no respect yeelde thereunto, saying: That if it shoulde page duplicate] page duplicate] be kept there, there would be much attributed to the holinesse of the place: and wishing rather, that the place of his dispossession might be in the field, that so all people might behold it.
But vpon better aduise, it fell out to bee in a narrow low roome.
What effect the said popish meanes haue to cast out Deuils: how easily they expell them, and how they torment them: will haue a time to be imparted.
In the meane while it is pertinent to the purpose, to consider, how mightily (forsooth) the fasting and prayers appointed by M. Darrell, wrought in his patients.
He and his wife, with two or three more, fasting and praying from morning till noone, out went the Deuill from Katherine Wright: he could no longer indure it.
At the pretended dispossession of Darling, by meanes of the fasting of halfe a score, from morning till night, and by reading certaine prayers out of the booke, intituled: The enemie of securitie, (wherein they were oft interrupted, by reason of the boyes fittes) and by M. Darrels assistance though absent: it is to be maruelled (by such as delight in wonders) how the Deuill was afflicted: as appeareth by his wordes (forsooth) but deliuered by the boy, vz. Radulphus, Belzebub can doe no good, his head is stricken off with a word.
Againe, we can not preuaile, let vs go out of him, and enter into some of those here.
Againe, we can not preuaile, for they will not be holpen by witches.
Brother Radulphus, we cannot preuaile: let vs go to our mistres torment her: haue had a draught of her bloud to day.
Againe, there is a woman earnest at prayer, get her away: Nay quoth Iohn Alsop (a man that was present) with a loude voice: we can not spare her.
And againe: Brother Glassop, wee can not preuaile, his faith is so strong, and they fast and pray, and a preacher prayeth as fast as they.
By which preacher Maister Darrell confesseth, that hee thinketh the Deuill meant him.
The same also is at large intreated of, in the booke of the seuen possessed in Lancashire.
Maister Dicons the author of the historie saith: that whilest he was in his sermon, at the time of the pretended fast for their deliueraunce, Margaret Hardman vsed these words, must be gone, must be gone: which must be vnderstood to bee spoken by the Deuill, who was so pinched, that he could stay no longer.
And againe the said Margaret, (whilest Maister Moore was preaching) can not tarrie, can not tarry: am too hot, am too hot: let mee go, let mee go.
The story also saith, that Sathan was so haunted by fasting prayer, and by the word of God so zealously and powerfully applyed, as if fire had beene put into his hole to burne him out.
The Deuill also said to Elianor Hardman: You are too holy now, and haue Gods word amongst you.
Margaret Hardman likewise being greatly affrighted, in came Maister Darrell Maister Moore, where she was standing by the fire, who hauing comforted her with many godly exhortations, out goeth Sathan, saying: that it was too holy a place for him.
It shold seeme, that when Somers was dispossessed, as men being greatly astonished, are therewith stroken into a silence, so the deuil was shrowdly dressed.
He was forsooth, so extreamely tormented by the fasting, prayers, preaching of Maister Darrell, and the rest, as he had no leasure to say what he must doe, or what he would doe: but rudely without taking any leaue of them, departed.
The meanes that Maister Darrell and his friendes doe pretend in casting out Deuils, are as you haue heard, fasting, prayer, and faith: an historicall faith (saith Maister Darrell, a iustifying faith (saith Maister Moore ).
But if you marke well what they say, and what they did, you shall find, that their preaching bare away the bell, in the dispossessing of those in Lancashire, and William Somers.
For whilest Somers was in hand, Maister Darrell, and an other occupied the day with two sermons, and so likewise with the other: Maister Darrels and Maister Moores, and the said Maister Dicons exhortations spent the most of that time.
Now it is to bee supposed, that the rest who were present, did attend to the preachers, and continued not their owne priuate prayers.
Besides, you heare indirect tearmes out of the said historie of those in Lancashire, that their powerfull preaching is annexed for a meanes to prayer and fasting.
Whereunto may bee added the word of God (as the storie saith): Which the Deuills (forsooth) could not endure to heare, but would be gone.
And so you see them fall into the said popish follies, making the signes of possession the meanes and causes of dispossession.
As it is also most apparant by M. Mores conceite, who thinketh prayer more necessarie, then the signes of possession mentioned in the scriptures, for the true discerning of those who are possessed.
And who knoweth whether in time, the naming of the Presbyterie would not haue had the vertue of a popish relique, as well to cast out a Deuill, as to disclose him: and the presence of M. Darrell, M. More, and such like; as great force therein, as the popish priests, thrusting their fingers into the parties mouthes.
Surely, that smelleth hereof, that when M. Darrell and M. Moore came into the place where Margaret Hardman was greatly troubled, the Deuill departed, and stayed no longer.
But the point is, wee see these fellowes as ridiculous in their conceipts, touching the meanes how they should cast out Sathan, as they haue appeared in the premisses, and their iudgements are as well setled in that which followeth.
Of the signes whereby M. Darrell and others do discerne (as they say) when Sathan is expelled.
THe assuraunce that the Exorcising impostors haue in these daies, of the Deuils departure, is answerable to the rest of their vncertainties.
M. Darrels ignorance maketh him (as it seemeth) in this point confident.
He is peremptorie, that because it is said, in the scriptures: that the spirit of the lunatike, when he was cast out of him, did crie and rent him sore, and that he lay as one dead: that therefore these three are infallible signes appointed by God to know when one is dispossessed.
Nay rather then faile, he wil be content with one of them, as in his dealing with Thomas Darling hereafter will appeare.
It may bee maruelled, why the authour of the briefe Narration, seeing how easily some lewde knaue might counterfeite these signes: that hee hath not deuised some other of greater certaintie (because men are so dull now a dayes (forsooth) to belieue such matters) as he hath done touching the signes of possession.
Maister Darell confessing, that in the Apostles times, some spirits were cast out more easily then others, might in reason haue thought, that those that went out so easily, did not so grieuously torment the parties at their casting out, as the rest did.
And somewhat it is, that although there are diuers mentioned in the scriptures, to haue beene dispossessed by our Sauiour Christ and by his Apostles: yet it is said of none but of the Lunatike, Marke
that when Sathan departed, the spirit eyther cryed, or rent him sore, or that they lay for dead.
To make therefore such particularities in one, a generall rule for all, argueth greatly the weaknesse of his iudgements.
True it is, that he blundereth out sometimes, some other signes for his assurance when Sathan departeth: and it may not be omitted, of whom hee hath learned them.
The popish Exorcistes, finding no assurance in the scriptures (as it may be thought,) touching that point, haue deuised many more signes: as when the patie can abide holy reliques, and the presence of the Exorcistes, &c.
When hee saith, that he is deliuered from Sathan: when the Deuill himselfe telleth the Exorcist, that he will be gone: and when according to the Exorcistes commandement, he eyther putteth out some candle, or breaketh some such quarrell in the glasse window, as he was directed to breake at his going: Also, the departing from the said parties, of certaine liuing creatures: as of flies, spiders, antes, and such like: the ceasing of their former deformitie, which Sathan procured: vomiting, Cum quo spiritus egressi leguntur non rarÃ², spirits are often times vomited out: faetor grauis: the Deuils leauing behind him a great stinch: a great swelling in the part that Sathan departeth at: the casting of them to the ground: And lastly, Magni tumultus, cum tumultibus damna, great noise, and therewith daunger: as when the Deuill going out, carieth a peece of the house with him.
When William Somers had lyen a while, as though he had beene dead, after came againe to himselfe, Maister Darrell said therevpon, that he was dispossessed.
His perswasion also that Darling is dispossessed, is confirmed (as he saith) by the boyes continuance so long well.
The chiefe assurance, that M. Darrell and M. More had, that Sathan had left Iane Ashton, was her owne wordes, vz. when rising from her fitte, shee saide, hee is gone, he is gone, am well thanke God.
And hauing wept in the saide fitte, shee also saide, that then Sathan departed from her.
So as here wee haue a new signe of Sathans going out of one, vz. the weeping of the partie.
Concerning Sathans owne worde, that he would be gone, there are diuers testimonies (forsooth) mentioned in the
The booke of the boye of Burton sayeth, that towardes the ende of the fast for his pretended dispossession, he began to heaue lift vehementlie at his stomacke, and getting vp some fleagme and choler, said (pointing with his finger, and following with his eyes) looke, looke, see you not the mouse that is gone out of my mouth? and so pointed after it, vnto the farthest part of the parlor.
And M. Darrell affirmeth, that when he did so vomite, and vsed those wordes, that then spirite left him.
But because he will affirme nothing without good reason, hee sayeth hee is confirmed in that opinion by his owne experience, in that it hath fallen out so with others, at the instant of their dispossession, as they haue reported.
Beholde his demonstration, vz. as they reported, and who were these reporters, and what did they reporte? Margaret Byrom said, that at her reuerting, after she had lien as dead halfe an houre, shee felt the spirite come vp from her belly towardes her breast, thence to her throate, when it left her throate, it gaue her a sore lug, and all that while a darke mist dazeled her eyes: then shee felt it goe out of her mouth in the likenes of a crowes head, and sate in the corner of the parlor, with darkenes about it for a while.
Then went it with such a flash of fire out of the window, that all the parlor seemed to her to bee on fire.
It left behind it a sorethroate, and a filthy smel, that a weeke after her meate was vnsauery.
And besides, the most infallible note amongst M. Darrels three signes of dispossession, vz. lying for deade, is here confuted.
For this partie was reuiued againe before Sathan was gone.
Moreouer, if his position be true, that euery one that is possessed, is senselesse in his fitte, then eyther it must bee confessed, that the saide Margaret was in no fitte when Sathan was going out of her, in that shee felt him: or else that shee lyed when she so reported.
Iohn Starkie saide, that the deuill went out from him like a man, with a great bunch on his backe, as big as a man.
Anne Starkie, that he left her like a foule vgly man with a white beard, and a great bunch on his breast as bigge as a mans head.
Margaret Hardman, that hee departed from her like an vglie man, with a great bunch on his backe.
Elianor Hardman, that hee went out of her like an vrchen, and went through a verie little hole out of the parlor.
Ellen Holland, that her spirite was like Anne Starkies: and Iane Ashton, that the deuill went out of her like a great breath, vglie like a toade, and round like a ball.
Now vpon the credite of these testimonies, Darrell is grown to be a man of great experience: and knew well, what the meaning was of Darlinges mouse.
But why should knowledge bee mentioned in the practises of these iuglers? M. Darrel (I trow) wil not take vpo~ him to haue greater skill in this point, then all the great Iesuiticall popish Rabbins, who haue written much, and haue vsed great traffique in the trade of casting forth Deuilles.
Thyraeus confesseth plainely, that all the saide signes before mentioned, are not infallible argumentes of Sathans dispossession: for sayeth hee: sicuti pro voluntate sua spiritus haec post se signa relinquunt: ita eadem possunt dare, nihilominus in hominibus, quos aliquandiu obsederunt, sedes suas retinere: as wicked spirites may at their pleasure omitte these signes, so they may shew them, and yet notwithstanding keepe their possession.
Besides, hee is also resolute, that there is no necessitie, why wicked spirites when they are cast out, should shew any signes at all of their departure, non rarÃ³ fit, vt discedant nullis sui discessus post se datis signis.
It is not seldome seene, that Sathan departeth, leauing no signes of his going: whereof he bringeth sundry examples.
When therefore these cosening merchantes, doe tell men now a dayes, that they haue cast deuils out of any their children, seruantes or friends: it is hereby manifest, what credite their wordes do deserue.
X. Of M. Darrell, and M. Mores conceite: that Sathan being cast out of one, doth presentlie after seeke to repossesse him.
WHen men haue escaped any greate daunger: it is commonly the aduise of their friendes, that they should take heede of the like.
M. Darrell like a kind friend, had neuer to deale with the dispossessing of any: but for his care therein, hee maye bee thought to haue deserued greate commendation.
For his perswasions to such still haue beene, that they should vse all diligence and circumspection, that Sathan did not againe reenter into them.
This his perswasion hath euer bin drawn from a position, which he stiffely holdeth, vz. that Sathan being expelled out of a man, doth seek presently after to reenter into him again: and that it is commonly a very hard matter to withstand him, by reason of his subtelties, in alluring them by promises, terrifying of them by threatninges.
He had no sooner cast the deuill out of Katherine Wright, but the euill spirite seeking to reenter into her, was for one time, by his assistance resisted (as he himselfe confesseth).
And concerning Darling, he sayeth thus: The monday after his dispossessing, tolde him apart, that the deuill would seeke to repossesse him: and therefore counselled him to watch ouer himselfe, and resist him: adding these wordes, (as Darling reporteth,) that peraduenture hee would appeare in the likenes of a frend, and vse all the meanes he could to perswade him to some euill.
Touching William Somers also: presently after his pretense, that the boye was dispossessed, he affirmed that for a certainety, Sathan would seeke to repossesse him: making that a ground for a new worke, as afterwardes is declared.
For his saide opinion of Sathans seeking to reenter, he relyeth vpon a metaphoricall place in the scriptures: but for his said addition of Sathans promises, and similitudes, that will not so easily be coloured.
When M. Darrell M. More were in hand with the seauen in Lancashire, and had (if you will belieue them,) dispossessed six M. More tolde them, that Sathan would surely assault euery one of them, and that both diuerse times, and by diuerse and sundry meanes.
He will (sayeth he) appeare vnto you in some likenes or other: and hee will intreate you, that hee may enter in againe, and promise you many goodly thinges, as golde and siluer, &c: And if he cannot so preuaile, then he will threaten you to break your necks, to cast you into pits, &c.
If it be here demanded how M. More knew, that Sathan would appeare vnto them in some likenes, his answere is, vz. for that he had beene tolde, that the Deuil seeking to repossesse the boy of Burton, did appeare vnto him in sondry likenesses.
And concerning his knowledge, that Sathan would make such promises vnto them: hee relyeth vpon this, vz. because the nature of man is subiect to bee seduced by such offers.
If these childish answeres remayned not in record vnder his owne hand, would any man belieue them? doth it not giue vs iust occasion to thinke, that he tolde them such tales of a lewde purpose, thereby to draw them to pretend the like? Otherwise would a man fearing God, being in such a conflict with Sathan, (as hee pretendeth) for their dispossession, haue tolde them any such matters vpon Or doth it carry with it any such consequence, as to tell them that Sathan would allure them by promises, and threatninges, because mens natures are subiect to be seduced by such meanes? But what should we dispute the matter with him, or examine the force of his argumentes: seeing euery thing came to passe, as he had foretolde? Remember the similitudes, that the deuill departed from them, and euen in the same (as the story sayeth) they sought againe to reenter into them.
Besides, they attempted them also in other formes, as of a blacke Rauen, of a blacke boy, the head bigger then the body, of a blacke rough dogge with a firebrand in his mouth, of fine white doues of a braue fellow like a Woer, of two little whelpes, that playing on the table, ran into a dish of butter; of an Ape, of a Beare with fire in his mouth, and of an promising them bagges of golde and siluer; and threatning them when they so could not preuaile, to breake their neckes, to drowne them in pittes, to hang them, to breake their backs, to throw them out of the windows: &c. euen in such sort in effect, as M. More, of likelyhoode inspired with one of them, had before declared.
What the story reporteth of M. Moore, may also be applyed to M. Darrell: who made great vse of these ridiculous conceits, in his practises with Somers.
Out of all question, if these absurde mates had gone on, they would haue proued as grosse deluders, as any of the popish or Iesuiticall Exorcistes, if not more grosse: For the popish sort, hauing hammered this point of Sathans seeking to reenter into the same partie, out of whom hee was cast, are so farre from M. Darrell, and M. Mores opinion, as some of them holde, that those spirites, which are once cast out of men, secundo osdem ingredi, vexare non possunt.
And those that relye vpon the place of S. Mathew, Cap.
doe onely inferre, that sometimes Sathan doth so seeke to reenter, but not alwayes.
Besides, the Captaine or Marshall of Deuils, (who taketh vppon him to write most exactly of them in this point,) reduceth all the places, whether the wicked spirites goe at such times, into the number of sixe, as out of one man into another: out of men into beastes out of men, into fayre and great houses (whereof it commeth, that some houses are haunted with spirits,) out of men into desert places, and out of men into hell: pretermitting as a place more extraordinarie, the returning of Sathan, into the partie, that hee had lately possessed.
But M. Darrell and his friendes, will peraduenture bee better prouided in this point hereafter.
And it were conuenient also, that they furnished themselues with some better proofes, for their tales of Mice, of Beares, and Bugges, threatning and promising such great matters.
It may be they haue some conceite, that the Deuilles tempting of Christ, will serue their turne: but assuredly for shame they dare neuer publish it.
How those that tooke vpon them to cast out Deuils, doe get themselues worke, and of their deuises to couer their lewdenes.
THey that make it so ordinary a matter in these daies to cast out deuils, doe not say, that it is an ordinary thing amongst Christians, for men or women to bee possessed: wherevpon it commeth to passe, that the in that skil, haue deuised many wayes to keepe themselues in worke.
It is not pertinent in this place, to shew how the Papists haue intituled their Exorcising priests, to the coniuring of young infants, immediatelie before their baptisme: because although they holde, that thereby the deuill is driuen from them: yet they dare not resolue, that euery infant when it is born, is possessed.
In their exorcising of infantes, they may pretend that they worke great matters, but except you will take their credite for payment, nothing appeareth, but blowing vpon the infantes, (thereby pretending that they blow away Satha~:) thrusting of salt into their mouthes, wetting their noses and eares with spittle, and their annointing of them with their hallowed oyle; meere toyes, wherby their estimation is not much increased.
For the beholders, seeing nothing in those actions to bee maruayled at, are not so much moued with them.
It should seeme that these kinds of deuils (that are thus exercised) are but doltes, and therefore cannot serue these iuglers turnes, as being peraduenture but newly hatched, when infants are borne, and therefore ignorant, how to apply themselues to their contentment.
They cannot cry out, or rage by their praying to Saintes, by their casting of holy water vppon them, by their bringing vnto them of the Sacrament of the Altar, or their Agnus Dei, by their application of holy reliques, nor by their owne approaching neare vnto them, being holy catholike priestes.
And therefore they are deuils of greater vnderstanding, and better experience, that the Exorcistes hunt after: such as are acquinted with the diuine vertue of their so catholike iuglings, and practises.
It is disputed amongst them, whether all infantes bee possessed or not, it seeming an absurditie to commaund the Deuill to come forth of them, if he were not in them.
For the deciding of which doubt, it may be maruailed, if those kindes of deuils be of any standing, when they vse not their infallible meanes, to know the truth therein: which are (as heretofore hath beene expressed,) their application of reliques, and so forthÂ· For if they bee so terrible to Sathan, (as they pretend,) why should he not bee compelled by the force of them to shew himselfe, or his presence, aswell in infantes, as eyther in boyes or wenches, or any other? But as these deluders must haue (it seemeth) more skilful deuils, so must they also haue some elder persons, that are more fitte to bee seduced by them.
Otherwise their reputation, in that behalfe would soone decay, and their holy water, with the rest of their trumpery, want that testimony, that is drawne from the deuils disliking of them: which may not be endured, but prosecuted and defended with all their might and skill.
Neither is this cunning appropriated onely to the Papistes, but extendeth it selfe further, there being men also amongst our selues, who want not their Reliques and deuises, which these elder deuils must feare, and tremble at.
There is a profound question amongst the Romanistes, Whether all Protestants, whom they account heretiques, bee not possessed with wicked spirites.
If it had fallen out, that they had so beene, their Exorcistes would in such sorte haue beene set on worke, as they should not haue beene driuen to haue sought farre for it.
But it is otherwise ouerruled: that (forsooth) although heretickes haue great fellowship and intercourse with Deuils: Obsessi tamen omnes, nec possunt, nec debent dici: yet al of them neither may, nor should he thought to be possessed: propterea quod, &c. because the signs of possession do not appeare in them.
And they that take vpon them to cast out Deuils amongst our selues: notwithstanding, it seemeth, that stinted prayers are very offensiue to them, that they are not resolued of the difference betwixt a priest a Bishop, yet they will not say, that they who hold against them are possessed: albeit men of that humor both haue, and still do depue them, maligne them, and slaunder them vpon any occasion at their pleasures.
So as these Exorcists of both kinds, for want of worke are driuen to their shifts: and like Tinkers walke vp and downe from place to place, seeking to be imployed.
It is a matter of some difficultie to discouer their shifts, and sleights to that purpose, they haue so many; and by their experience doe manage them so craftily.
Diuers of them are here sette downe, and the rest may bee supplied peraduenture by some hereafter.
Sometimes they make choice of some such boyes or wenches, as they thinke are fit for their purpose, whome they procure by many promises and allurements, to keep their counsell, and to bee (as they tearme it) aduised by them.
And these are commonly of the poorer sort, either the children, or seruants of such persons, as the Exorcistes doe well know, to be of their owne stampe, and well affected towardes them.
It falleth out now and then, that they haue some schollers of their own, whom they mean, to preferre: the popish sort to some Seminaries, and others as they may.
And there are none to these, they are so apt to worke vpon: howbeit, they can soone frame the other to their bent, by their cunning.
When they haue any of these in hand, they doe instruct them so perfectly, as when they come to exorcise them, they are in a manner secure: their schollers knowing as well what to doe, as their false maisters themselues.
These are not dealt with, but there must be a great assemblie gathered together, in one corner or other: all of them such persons, as they know to bee their friendes, or at the least such as their said friendes doe bring with them, and are thought fit to bee peruerted.
The company mette, the Exorcistes doe tell them, what a worke of God they haue in hande, and after a long discourse, how Sathan doth afflict the parties, and what straunge thinges they shall see: the said parties are brought forth, as it were a Beare to the stake, and being eyther bound in a chaire, or otherwise held fast, they fall to their fittes, and play their prankes point by point exactly, according as they haue beene instructed.
As if they bee of the new cutte: they crie, they wallow, they foame, and shew the signes of possession, mentioned in the Scriptures, with some others.
But if they bee of the olde instructions: then there are notable Tragedies.
Out commeth the Priest in his massing attire: the hallowed candles are lightened: their reliques, with their Agnus Dei are brought forth: the holy water flieth about the chamber: their hallowed frankinsence perfumeth the place, and so forth.
Whereupon all that are present, (hauing worshipped the said holy misteries) no sooner cast their eies towardes the parties pretended to be possessed, but there is starting, strugling, and striuing: they scriche, they raile, they spit, they crie, they rage and fare, as not being able in any wise without daunger of present death, to indure the presence of the catholique Priestes, and of their holy complements.
But when these Exorcistes can not worke this way (as wanting such fitte schollers to dissemble and collude with them) then by casting about, they (especially the popish iuglers) haue in readinesse some other, as neede shall require.
At their comming to the places where they know they are welcome, but cannot practise as before, if they finde any youth, boy or girle, that is not well at ease, and whose disease is not apparant, (as eyther an Ague, the small pockes, or such like, where of euery man is able to iudge) they will seeme to take great care of them: as being desirous to know the cause of their griefe, and the meanes to helpe them.
In this case it is sufficient for them, if the partie bee troubled, eyther in his stomacke with choller or fleagme, or in his belly with gripinges or collicke, or in his head or ioyntes with aches or numnesse: they can worke vppon it.
In their saide pretended care for such a partie (which maketh them the better welcome) they will procure some ordinarie things to bee giuen vnto him, and then after a while, their manner is, to admire the disease: saying, that for a certaintie, it is very strange: that by the rules of learning, there can be no reason giuen of it: and so after much adoe, they come by degrees to suspect forsooth, and then after a while, plainely to affirme, that out of all question the partie is possessed.
And herein our reformed Exorcistes doe in some sorte agree with them: but that which next ensueth, doth properly (for ought that appeareth) appertaine to the others.
If at their comming to any such places, (the houses of popish Recusants, their most assured friends,) they finde all the housholde well, and yet thinke it conuenient to shew their skill there: then obseruing such youthes as are in the house of eyther kind, and marking which of them is fittest for their purpose, they practise this deuise.
Their manner is, when they come into any such place, to vse euery one very kindly, but especially the younger sort, whom they will take vpon them to instruct.
In which respect they grow shortly to be familiar with them: and then in their priuate talke together, they will cunningly fish from them, whether at any time tofore they haue beene sicke, or troubled, and the manner how.
Here if the parties tell them, that they haue had but so much, as a payne once in their sides, or any particular griefe in some other parte of their bodies: they haue caught the gudgin, that is, the whole matter that they fished for.
Then they vse the parties much more kindly then before, and do seeme to haue a more especiall care of their good estate.
Marry, at the length (as men very carefull, least the said parties should not do wel) they will beginne to suspect, and giue out wordes accordingly, that the said parties are not in so good case, as they looke for.
They insinuate, as though they knew by their learning, that the parties were inclining to such, or such a disease: naming that, whereof before cunningly they had gotten notice.
Herein they proceede with such craft, as they easily draw from the parentes, or masters of such parties, how at such or such a time, or about so long since, they were indeede troubled with such a kinde of disease.
By this meanes their credit is somwhat increased, being deemed for men of especiall knowledge, in that they are able to discerne of such matters.
When they haue gotten this hold, then they begin to deale priuately with the parties, and to say vnto them, that they greatly feare their state of health to be in great danger: insomuch as with little trouble (such is their cunning that way) they make them in deed to suspect themselues.
Then they tell them many strange tales, of bugges and spirites: how Sathan seeketh to molest those children that God loueth, by vexing them in these and those partes, and how afterwardes he will lie hidden in them, and suffer them to be well for diuers monethes, and sometimes for a yeare together.
And here they adde, (but with very good tearmes) that they are afraid by the signes they see in them, that their ancient griefe did proceed from Sathans malice towardes them: and that they verily suppose, he doth still lurke in them: and that notwithstanding, in respect of their good will and liking towards them, they will do their best to make them sound, if they will be ruled by them: not doubting but in verie short time, fully to deliuer them from that their ghostly enemie, and restore them to perfect health.
When they haue thus framed the children to their minds, then ordinarily they deale with the parentes, or maisters, to the same effect, who finding their children or seruantes somewhat drooping, are easily drawne (through the good opinion they haue of the Exorcistes) to yeeld to any course, which they shall thinke meet to be vndertaken in that behalfe.
man would wonder, how all this should sorte with their intents.
For if there should be no further apparance of Sathans possessing the said parties, their friends might suspect they were neuer possessed: and they in pretending to dispossesse them, would be depriued (in all likelihood) of the glorie and fruite that thereby they gaped after.
It is therefore further to be obserued, that when they haue prepared all parties (as is before mentioned) then they appoint a time, when (as they say) if the parties be possessed, they will compell the Deuill that lurketh in them (will he nill hee) to discouer and shew himselfe.
In the meane while, with great deuotion forsooth, they tell many tales of the vertue of holy reliques, and other such trumperie as are before specified: how wicked spirites haue beene constrained by them in such cases, to disclose their lurking: how they haue tormented the parties, and how in the end they haue been cast out.
By these meanes, if the parties pretended to bee possessed, bee not ouer dull, they may learne somewhat: and for the most parte they do so.
But howsoeuer, as the Exorcistes doe vse the matter, it much forceth not: their friends, and those that heare them, are thereby prepared (they know) to admire those tricks, which afterwardes they shall see.
At the time appointed, many are not then called to be present, because the Exorcistes will first see how their geare worketh: and afterwardes they doe frame their companie accordingly.
In the morning when their masse is ended, the Exorcistes keeping still vpon them their massing attire, and all things being prepared (as in the other case before hath beene specified) the partie that must bee dealt with, (hauing beene at the masse, and eyther perfectly well in deede, or troubled with some little ache, sauing that the said iuglers haue skarred him) is in the presence of that assemblie, set and bounde fast with towels in a chaire.
Then the Exorcistes set their holy engynes a working, they crosse, they kneele, they pray, and come with such solemnitie and shew of deuotion vnto the poore youth, that is so bound, as no maruaile if they should fright him out of his wittes.
His colour commeth and goeth: his feare is great what will become of him and therewith beginneth sometime to tremble, and to bee in a colde sweate: wherewith, Ah (say the Exorcistes) see you not how Sathan beginneth to shew himselfe? This is he that worketh these effects: but you shal see more anone.
Then they giue to the partie their holy potion, (as they tearme it) which they tell those that are present, hath a maruellous power to plague and vexe the Deuill.
Sure it is, that the operation of it is greate.
It is almost halfe a pinte of holie Oyle, mingled with almost as much hallowed Sacke, hauing in them both a quantitie of the iuyce of hallowed Rue.
This drinke (which an honest man woulde scarce giue to an horse) these iugling knaues doe constraine the youth (being bound) to take at their pleasure: wherewith hee is in a short time so troubled and intoxicated, as his head groweth giddie: he heaueth vomitteth, and if all this worke not, (as they would haue it) then they burne hallowed brimstone vnder his nose, holding his head by force so ouer the smoke, as they may bee sure to stuffe him with it.
By the time that this hath wrought together with the potion, the youth groweth in effect to bee besides himselfe: Hee raueth, he strugleth, and sheweth great signes of paynes and griefe.
In which his fitte, you must thinke, that the Exorcistes are not idle.
They bring vnto him peraduenture the Sacrament of the Altar, and apply their reliques, and other trinkettes, still ascribing euery thing that the partie eyther doth or saith, to the Deuill: who by that meanes is compelled (as they say) to shew himselfe.
As the operation of the said potion and brimstone diminisheth, so the Exorcistes doe vse their charmes: commaunding the Deuill to cease from troubling the partie, and to lodge himselfe for that time, for example, eyther in his foote, or his toe, and sometimes in his toe naile.
And this is their first pageant, wherby they make it apparant (forsooth) that the parties, whom they vndertake, are possessed.
When all things do fall out herein to their desire, the people present greatly wondring at the matter (as little suspecting the lewdnes of their ghostly fathers) then they appoint some other time for a greater concourse, to see this wonderfull work of God, by his holy catholike priests.
The parties, whom they haue before instructed, are not then much troubled with the said potion, or brimstone: because they can shew their trickes sufficiently, as compelled thereunto by vertue of the priestes words: in short time also the other, hearing what effectes they ascribe to that drinke and smoke, doe frame themselues, for the auoiding of them both, to practise all they heare without them: which is a meanes to procure them great ease.
For you must not thinke, that when they haue such a matter on foote, they giue it ouer suddenly.
True it is, that sometimes they will keep the poore youth in their hands, in spite of his head, to worke wonders with, sometimes halfe a yeare, euen as long as they list themselues.
Againe, there is another way, whereby these fellowes do get themselues more worke.
It falleth out sometimes, that diuers children, hauing heard how such such haue beene thus and thus troubled, they of themselues will begin to faine themselues sicke: if they bee boyes, peraduenture because they would remaine from the schoole: if wenches, for that they would be idle, both of them, that thereby they might be much made of, and dandled.
Now, there being no apparant cause of such their dissembled sicknesse, they are driuen to counterfeite, and to fall to those trickes which they haue hearde of in others: Wherein, if eyther their parentes or maysters beginne to pittie them, then they runne on in their knaueries aboue measure: but especially if they beginne to wonder at them, and to deuise some remedies for them.
If any of our Exorcistes do heare of such an oportunity, they will not let it escape, but by one means or other they wil haue occasion, to goe to that place: where being well entertained, and of credite, the said parties are pretended by them forthwith to be possessed.
And here by the way, you shall obserue a little wonder.
It will hardly be shewed, that any of this sort haue beene found, but eyther in the houses of Recusantes, or of such as haue on the other side pretended some zeale, for they know not what reformation.
Where rayling is ordinary, and euery sleight tale (which is countenanced by a Minister or Priest of those sectes,) is made a great matter, and vrged as an argument for some purpose or other.
Besides, it falleth out amongst vs: that they who haue taken vpon them, to haue cast out deuils, haue stil been men of that humor, as being forsooth more pure then the rest of their brethren.
But to proceede, when these fellowes (as is aforesaide) haue bred a conceite, that the parties mentioned are possessed: then they tell their friendes in their hearing, especially when they are in their pretended fittes, what great experience they haue in such matters.
And amongst many things, they beat into their heads, these false grounds, vz. that those who are possessed, are in their fittes altogether senceles, and that whatsoeuer they doe or say, it is not they, but the deuill in them that speaketh, and doth it: though it seeme neuer so apparantly otherwise.
There hath not beene of auncient time any certaine doctrine in these pointes: but now they are grown into practise with the Exorcistes of both sortes, as being the best meanes to worke their feares by, that hetherto hath beene deuised amongst such kinde of counterfeites.
They are comparable to the aforesaid holy potion and brimstone.
For the children or youthes, (as such must be betwixt the yeares of xiiii. and xviii. or there aboutes,) hearing what these seducers doe reporte, are very apt and readie to make their aduantage of such their speeches: although they know very well, that they lye in so saying.
These groundes thus layde, then the companions goe on in setting out their skill.
They repeate the signes of possession, and how they haue seene these, and those thinges done, by such as were in the like case, not doubting (as they commonly adde,) but that the deuill in the parties, whome they haue in hand, will shew and doe the like in them.
Which thinges and reportes the parties hearing, they fal, aswell as they can, to the practise of them: as hauing thereby libertie, to doe and say what they list, and in a sorte to worke wonders.
It is also the custome of the Exorcistes, when they haue gotten such youthes to vse them very gently: whereby the saide youthes, are the rather induced, so to apply themselues, as they may please them.
For after a short time, they easilie perceiue by the Exorcistes speeches, what they would haue them to acte or speake: and the rather because they finde themselues, not onely to bee admired, and very much made of: but that likewise, the whole course of their former dissimulation, is by their meanes altogether couered.
When the people that are present at these and the former iuglinges, with such like, (suspecting no fraude,) doe beholde how euery thing commeth still to passe, as the Exorcistes doe foretell, and what a dexterity boldnes they haue, in hunting and coursing of wicked spirites, commaunding them, coniuring and cursing them at their pleasure: it is not much to bee maruailed, that they are cast thereby into a wonderfull astonishment.
If any doe surmise these practises to bee improbable, as being much subiect to daunger, in that the said parties, that are so cunningly drawne on in those courses, may vpon many occasions detect them: they must know that these fellowes are well inough furnished in that behalfe.
For first amongst the Papistes, it were sufficient to bring a man into suspition of Heresie, that should but doubt that one were not possessed, if their Priestes affirmed the contrary.
And we see amongst our selues, how hardly it is endured, that our pretended Exorcistes are called into question, But bee it, that the worst should fall out: yet haue they such rules, as if you will allow them, they are safe inough.
For if any doe once fall into their hands, or yeeld themselues vnto their practises, they can neuer bee rid from them by any meanes, so long as they are pleased to worke vpon them.
Some of their saide rules, are as followeth: vix aliquem deprehendas, &c. you shall scarsely find anie amongst those that are possessed, which hath not many wicked spirites in him.
The vse of which rule is very ample, and extendeth farre.
For if any of their patientes, after their pretence of their dispossession, shall in remorse of conscience confesse, the knaueries and lewde dealinges of the Exorcistes with them: then they say that therby it appeareth, they had many deuils in them, whereof some remayning vncast out, they continue in as euill case almost as they were before.
If the saide confession bee made shortly after their pretended dispossession, then the said rule is accounted more probable.
But if the parties continuing well for a longer time, as for a yeare or more, without making shew of any trouble, or vexation of Sathan, (whereby it may well bee thought they haue no Deuilles in them,) and then detect those holy men; by an other rule, they auoide that also: which is, that Sathan for feare of being cast out, will lye lurking in those that are possessed, shewing no signes thereof for a great time, and that the slaundering of them, (being holy Exorcistes) is an apparant argument of Sathans continuance in them.
It falleth out also oftentimes, that such as haue beene in these Exorcists handes, as they doe detect their false practises with them, so doe they also confesse their owne dissimulation, acknowledging the truth in euery thing, and that they were not at all possessed.
To meet therefore with this inconuenience, they haue this rule: Egressi solent persuadere &c.
When the deuilles are cast out of a man, they endeuoure by all the means they can, to perswade, that hee was neuer in them: that so the partie being vnthankefull to God for his deliuerance, they might the better reenter into him.
And therefore there is an other rule to be obserued (they say) by the Exorcistes: Vt liberatum moueant quantum possint, ad credendum se liberatum: that they admonish the dispossessed as effectually as they are able, to belieue, that being possessed, hee is deliuered, and dispossessed: and the pretence is faire, that thereby hee may bee thankfull to God.
If any man, suspecting the parties that are pretended to bee possessed, to dissemble in their fittes, shall offer to make some triall of it: that it is a point almost of infidelitie, and amongst the popish Exorcistes, is very dangerous, and is not well taken by ours.
Howbeit, sometimes it falleth out: that men are more bolde therein then welcome, and that they finde by many direct circumstances, that the parties doe counterfeyte.
But there are rules also to meete with this mischiefe: as, that Sathan doth sometimes permitte the parties to dissemble, and to acte some loose trickes, thereby to make the beholders belieue, that all the rest that they doe, is likewise dissembled, thereby to hinder the glorie of God in their dispossession: and likewise to conceale his owne presence.
Which latter point dependeth vppon an other rule: that forsooth the Deuill laboreth by all the means he can, that he might not be knowne to be in those he possesseth, that so he might auoide the power of the Exorcistes, and continue still his saide possession.
If a man shall reason the matter with these Exorcistes, or their vpholders, and besides the saide confessions of the parties shall alledge, that manie who saw them in their fittes, were of opinion, that they did counterfeyte: oh, (say they by an other rule) that is the practise of Sathan to stirre vp great discord and dissention, in making some to deny, that the parties were possessed: and hereof we haue experience in domibus familiis, in houses and families: Dummodo plures sint in eadem domo: if there be aboue two or three in the house: yea, but (say some vnto them) it is well knowne, that the Deuill is skilfull in all languages, that he is able to reueale many secretes, and if hee were present in anie man to shew the same at his going out, extinguendo luminaria magna, alia similia, by blowing out great lightes, &c.
And therefore how commeth it to passe, that they whome you tearme to bee possessed, can speake neither Latine, Greeke, nor Hebrew, &c. but their owne naturall language onely, nor reueale hidden matters, nor shew their departure by such notable signes? For answer whereunto, they haue sondrie shiftes, or rules: some of them being generall, others more particular, as the qualities of the said obiections doe require.
First (say they,) all Deuilles are not indued with the like knowledge.
Then that the Deuilles by their fall, although they lost not their knowledge, yet they lost possibilitatem illa vtendi, so as they cannot vse the same, nor doe any thing of themselues, but when God will permitte them.
These general rules thus laide, they come vnto their particular answeres, saying, Quod Daemones non loquuntur Latine, Grece, &c. that the Deuilles doe not speake Latine, Greeke, and other straunge tongues in the possessed, because God sometimes doth not permitte them so to doe.
And why doth God abridge them? Vt confundatur humana curiositas, that humaine curiositie (sayeth Mengus) might be confounded, which is delighted rather to heare the Deuill speaking curiously in the possessed, then the wordes of God, vttered by their Exorcistes.
But the sayde Mengus, hath else where two or three other shiftes, to meete with this obiection: as that the Deuils, doe verie rarely vse strange languages, ne credantur ibi adesse, least they should be thought to bee in the parties: and that the Deuils vsing the tongues of such as hee possesseth, doth not easily speake in an vnknown language: for example, to make an Italian to speake French, but doth vse his owne language: quia lingua ad vnum modum loquendi habituata, est illi obedientior, ad motus illi placentes dispositior: because the toung that hath an habite to speake but one language, is therein more obedient vnto him, and more apt to bee disposed of, as it pleased the Deuill.
And touching the reuealing of secretes, (as the sinnes of the parties possessed,) and speaking of high mysteries, they say: that if God doe giue them leaue, they know, and are able to speake, and reueale great and hid matters, but doe it not, although they bee knowne to be in the saide parties, least, in shewing their sinnes, they should bee brought to repentance.
If sometimes (sayeth Mengus) they speake of the great misteries of Diuinity, vt iam audiui, as haue heard them: nunquam vel raro intersunt isti euriosi, vt eorum curiositas confundatur: yet such curious men as make these obiections are neuer present, that their curiosity may be confounded.
Thirdly, concerning the shewing of some great signe, when the Deuill departeth, that they holde it not much to be respected, because it is no argument of the deuils presence in the possessed: in that the wandring deuilles in the ayre at the request of those that are in mens bodyes, possunt facere illamet signa, can blow out great lightes, and worke such signes.
And to an other obiection, which is made, how it commeth to passe, that for the most part such as are pretended to be possessed, are eyther men of the simpler sorte, or women, who may be strangely afflicted, being subiect humoribus matricalibus, thogh they be not possessed:, they say that the Deuilles doe easier possesse men and women of light brain, then those that be wise, ne deprehendantur ibi adesse, that they may not be thought to be in them, and that they vex women maides, rather then men, for these two causes, vz. that they seeke to hyde themselues, sub nomine humerum matricalium, and because women are more subiect to terrors, which open the passage for the Deuilles entrance into them.
Vnto these and such like rules, answeres, and grounds, may be added an other, whereupon all the rest are in a sort built, which is, that the art or exercise of casting out deuilles, is most odious to Sathan, and that therefore hee endeuoureth by all meanes possible, to slaunder and discredite the Exorcistes, being the men that he most abhorreth.
By this rule these Impostors haue such a priueledge, as nothing can eyther be sayd or done vnto them by any: but they are presentlie reputed for the Deuilles instrumentes.
If they be called into question for their falshoode and iugling, or brought before the Magistrates, or imprisoned, or proceeded against: all is done (they say) by the Deuil, or his ministers: daemones superiores mouent, the Deuilles moue the magistrates: illos faciunt incarcerari: the deuilles cause them to be imprisoned: and all is done by the deuill (forsooth) that is attempted for the finding out of their lewdnes.
Their own words, when their iugling is detected, must serue for their iustification: because they are men so loathsome to the deuill.
If they say, that any is possessed, it must bee so.
The parties confession touching his owne dissimulation is nothing, if they will testifye for him, that he did not dissemble.
It appeareth by one of the Councels of Carthage, that it hath beene a practise long since, amongst some lewde persons, to counterfeyte themselues to bee possessed.
And Lyra writing vpon these wordes: The Babilonians worshipped the Dragon, sayeth: that therein they were deceyued by the Priestes that worshipped him, propter quaestum temporalem quem inde reportabant, for their temporall profite which they reaped thereby.
And euen so (sayeth hee,) aliquando sit in ecclesia maxima deceptio populi in miraculis fictis a sacerdotibus, vel eis adhaerentibus, propter lucrum temporale: sometimes in the Church the people are greatly deceyued through false miracles feyned by the Priestes, or by their adherents, for temporall profite.
Howbeit, Mengus (an old seducer, hauing beene an Exorcist, as he sayeth, almost fortie yeares,) writing diuerse bookes of the casting out of Deuilles, as Flagellum Daemonum, a whippe for Deuilles: Fuga Daemonum, the chasing away of Deuilles: Fustis Daemonum, a club to beate them downe: and likewise Thyraeus, with many others, hauing written vppon the same argument, amongst them all, it will be hard to finde, that they euer make mention of any whome they dealt with, that did falsly pretend themselues to bee possessed.
As though they would make men to belieue, that there neither were or could be any such matter: whereas like cosening companions, they doe verie well know it, to be an ordinarie thing amongst them, especially in Italy, for women to make an occupation, of pretending themselus to be possessed.
Whereof it commeth to passe, that in their ordinarie stations, and solemne feastes in Rome, they neuer want some of those counterfeytes, who pretending themselues to be possessed, must forsoooth, by putting their heads vnder some Altars, or by touching some reliques, with stoles about their neckes, and some other trinkets, feine themselues to be dispossessed.
By reason of which false miracles, with diuers others: as the Babilonians were induced to worship the Dragon, so are the bewitched Romanists, to worship those false reliques, and to embrace diuers other points of Poperie.
But for the conclusion of this point, that shall serue, which a publike person in authoritie once said to Mengus: Volo vt scias quod ex numero quinquaginta exorcistarum, quadraginta nouem trises existunt: would haue you to know (saith the said Magistrate) that of fiftie Exorcistes, nine and fortie of them are counterfeites.
To whom Mengus answered: If were not present, you would so iudge of me.
And in deed he the said Mengus might as well haue made vp the fiftie, as any of that kind then liuing.
This second Booke intreateth of M. Darrels particular courses held with William Somers: how hee instructed him at Ashbie de la Zouch, to practise such trickes, as he might be thought thereby to be possessed: how afterwards he dealt priuately with him at Nottingham, supplying his defects in that behalfe, vpon euery occasion with new instructions, of such his extraordinarie cunning, as in deed deceiue the people, was sufficient to haue drawn Somers on throughout the whole course of his dissimulation, though he had neuer dealt with him before at Ashbie, nor priuately at Nottingham.
I. Of M. Darrels intercourse with Somers by startes at Ashbie, from about the yeare
for his instruction, how to dissemble himselfe to be possessed.
MAi&ster Darrell, hauing affirmed that William Somers was possessed: that he with others had dispossessed him: that he was repossessed: was accused before her Maiesties Commissioners, for causes ecclesiasticall, Anno
for a counterfeiting hypocrite, as hauing by many sleights and false pretences compassed such a conceit amongst his fauourers, to the dishonour of God, and great abuse and cosenage of sundrie her Maiesties louing subiectes.
And for some proofe of this generall imputation, he was charged with these particulars: vz. that hee became acquainted with William Somers, at Ashbie de about fiue or sixe yeares past: that he imparted vnto him the manner of Katherine Wrights fits: that he gaue them vnto him in writing, and moued him to learne the practise of them: that he promised him, in so doing he should not want: that he willed him, when he did practise the said fits before any company, he should make mention of his name: that afterwards Somers hauing put them in practise, and telling him the said Darrell, that M. Brakenburie had put him away thereupon for a counterfeite, he the said Darrell told him, that he had not acted his fits artificially, and did himselfe in Ashbie parke teach him to doe them better: that within a while after he willed Somers for his better instruction, to go and see the boy of Burton, how he vsed himselfe in his fittes: that an other time he moued Somers, that when hee should finde a fitte oportunitie, and had learned to doe the saide fittes cunningly, he should put them in practise at Nottingham, and that hee promised Somers to come thither vnto him, and not onely assist him, but likewise said, hee would procure his Maister Thomas Porter to release him of his yeares, which hee knew by the boyes owne report, to bee the thing that hee chiefly desired.
Touching euery one of these particulars, M. Darrell hath beene examined, and vpon his oth hath denied them all, so farre forth as they doe any way concerne himselfe: but Somers, of the age of one and twenty yeares, being deposed, doeth iustifie them point by point, as it may appeare by his words following, with this alteration onely: that his examination running in the third person (as the manner is) now hee speaketh in his owne: for the auoiding of many needlesse repetitions (as this examinate saith, &c.) which otherwise of necessitie must haue beene vsed: which order is likewise vsed in reciting the depositions, which are produced in this cause.
About a quarter of a yeare before my departure (saith hee) from M. Thomas Grayes, with whom then dwelt at Langley Abbey in Leicestershire) was sent one day, to Ashbie de la Zouch (being foure or fiue miles distant) vpon some occasion of busines.
At what time with other boyes, going into an Alehouse, found there M. Darrell, whom little regarding, but playing the wag, and shrewd boy with my companions, M. Darrell departed out of the house, and staied at the dore vntill came forth.
And then he tooke me apart, asked me my name, where was borne, with whom dwelt, and how was brought vp.
To whom answering, as the truth was in euery point: alas quoth M. Darrel) thou art a pretie boy, and my countreyman: knew thy father, and am sorie to see thee in so meane a case: for was simply apparelled, euen as meanely almost as could be.
He also then asked me, what had to doe in the towne, and how long it would be before had dispatched my businesse: whereunto answering truely, that would returne that way very shortly, he promised to bring me out of the towne, to tell me some thinges, wherein if would be ruled by him, should not be driuen to go so barely as did, but be able to maintain my selfe as long as liued.
When had dispatched my businesse, returned homeward, found M. Darrell not farre from the place where left him, talking with two or three strangers, about one Katherine Wright, whom he said he had dispossessed of an vncleane spirit.
After hee had ended his co~munication with them, he went with me along the street in my way homewards: as we were going together, hauing ouerheard some of his speeches with the said stra~gers, asked him what they ment: he answred me with a long speech co~cerning the possession of Katherine Wright, and told me the manner of her fits, in such sort how the Deuill troubled her, and how he had deliuered her, as was greatly afraid lest M. Darrell had beene a coniurer, and would haue done me some hurt: which hee perceiuing (as thinke) bad me be of good cheare, and told me there was no cause why should feare.
For (saith hee) if thou wilt sweare vnto me to keepe my counsell, will teach thee to doe all those trickes which Katherine Wright did, and many others that are more straunge.
Besides (quoth he) if thou wilt so doe, thou shalt neuer want whilest thou liuest.
Hereunto when had agreed, he told me more particularly what the said Katherine Wright did at seuerall times, in her fittes: as that she foamed at the mouth, gnashed with her teeth: cryed and scritched, catched snatched at those that stood by her, especially at him the said M. Darrell): laughed out of measure: fell into great shewes of sadnesse: wallowed and tumbled: cast her selfe into the fire, and sometimes into the water: would lie as though she had been sencelesse: and many other things M. Darrell then told me: saying, that might learne to doe them very easily.
And the better to teach me, hee did thereupon himselfe, acte diuers of them.
For gnashing with his teeth, he knocked his own teeth together diuers times.
For foaming, he rolled his tongue in his mouth, then put out some little spittle betwixt his lips: but said, that might soone learne to doe it better, by rolling a stone in my mouth, but especially if could get a little soape to vse at such times.
Likewise he shewed with his hands halfe open, the manner of her snatching catching, for some other of her doings he shewed some other gestures.
Also he then told me, that for my better remembrance, he would giue me in writing, al the said fits gestures before me~tioned.
And thereupon sitting downe vpon a banke, he did write them, deliuered them vnto me, saying: when thou hast learned them, so as thou canst do them perfectly, thou mayest put them in practise.
He likewise then told me, that when could put the said fits so in practise, as that should be iudged thereby to be possessed: must name him, then (quoth he) it is very likely, that shall be sent for: Which if it fall so out, then (said he) thou must at my comming vnto thee, do all the former thinges that haue told thee, Katherine Wright did.
Vpon that occasion, will take vpon me to dispossesse thee: and afterwards, if thou wilt still be aduised by me, will take thee my selfe, and maintaine thee.
In the end he gaue me xij. pence, and so we departed.
Somers being here demanded, where the said writing was that Maister Darrell deliuered vnto him, of Katherine Wrights fits: answereth, that after he had learned them by hart, hee did teare the paper in peeces, as M. Darrell had straightly charged him.
But further saith, that hee writ them in one of his bookes, called Sententiae pueriles: which booke, together with three others, one Mary Holding, then seruant with M. Gray, but since maried to one William Arnold, kept from him (as he was informed by some of M. Grayes men) in liew of eight pence, which he did owe vnto her.
Also the said Somers affirmeth, that after his former acquaintance begun with M. Darrell, whilest he stil remained with M. Gray, he met M. Darrel three or four times in Ashbie: once he affirmeth, that M. Darrell called him vnto him, and asked him, if as yet he had practised any of those things, which he had shewed vnto him.
To whom Somers answering, that hee had not, because the time had not serued him thereunto: Well (quoth M. Darrell doe them oft to thy selfe priuately, vntill thou shalt be perfect in them, then thou maiest practise them the better publikely.
At other times also the saide M. Darrel did kindly salute him.
Within twelue or thirteene weekes (as thinke) after my first acquaintance with M. Darrel: M. Gray placed me with one M. Anthonie Brakenburie, to keep certaine siluer haired Connies: with whom after had remained about sixe or seuen weekes, (as farre as remember) beganne to put in practise sundrie of those instructions that M. Darrell had giuen mee.
fained my selfe to bee sicke: foamed at the mouth: did sometimes lie speechlesse as though had beene dumbe: so by the space almost of a moneth did counterfeit as wel as could, such fits as Maister Darrell had told mee, that Katherine Wright did practise.
Howbeit, was not (as it seemeth) at that time my craftsmaister.
For M. Brakenburie, M. Randall Barton his brother, being verily perswaded that was but a counterfeit, that had dissembled al that had done, was turned out of seruice, went home to Nottingham to my mother: with whom after had remained about a moneth, was bound a prentise for seuen yeares, to one Thomas Porter, a musition in that towne.
Somers being here demanded, why hee did not call for M. Darrell, whilest he was in his fits at M. Brakenburies, according to the plotte agreed vpon betwixt him M. Darrel, answereth: that if he had perceiued that he had beene thought to haue beene possessed, he wold so haue done: but seeing his dissimulation tooke not that effect, he made no mention of him.
The said Somers, after he was bound prentise as is aforesaid, ran twice from his maister: the first time, in regard of his maisters hard vsage, when he had serued him not aboue a yeare: the second time, for the like cause, for that his maister was not able to teach him, about a yeare a halfe before he fel to his practises at Nottingham.
Being gone fro~ my maister, went to Ashby, enquiring for M. Darrel, found him in a house by the schoole neer the Churchyard.
Hauing met with him, he walked with me a long the way into the fields, after some other speeches, he asked me, whether had put in practise any of K. Wrights fits, that he had told mee of.
Whereupon declared vnto him, what had done at M. Brakenburies, and of the euill successe had there, as before it is expressed: and then M. Darrell said, that had not done those things which he taught me, so perfectly as should.
Then vpon some other further questions moued by M. Darrell, told him how had been bound prentise to a Musition: how why was gone from him, and how meant to go into Worcestershire, to see if could place my self there.
This my determination Maister Darrell did seeme to dislike, wishing mee rather to see if could get a Maister about Burton, or about Market Bosworth, or about Tamworth, because (saith he) would be glad to haue thee in some such place neere vnto me, so as might haue occasion more conueniently now then to see thee.
Nay quoth I) may not place my selfe so neer to Nottingham, least my maister do heare of me, so get me againe home vnto him.
Well then said M. Darrel, doe therein as thou wilt: but remember to put the former pointes (that haue taught thee) in practise, as thou canst conueniently: and then thou shalt be sure to heare of mee.
It may be here omitted, how Somers further bestowed himselfe, whilest he was from his maister, and how he returned to him againe, in hope to haue his yeares bought out: sauing that (as he saith) he did practise M. Darrels instructions oftentimes priuately, but had no fit oportunity to make any apparant shew of them, because in all that time he could not settle himselfe in any place.
Now vpon his second running from his maister, and after he had remained in Essex a good part of a yeare, till he was wearie: he returning homewards again towards Nottingham, with better hope then before, to buy out his yeares, thought it conuenient in his iourney homewards, to take Ashby in his way, of purpose to see M. Darrel, who~ he found there as he saith, had dealing with him, as followeth.
Vpon my comming at that time to M. Darrel, hee asked mee where had been: whither was going, whether had atte~p+ted to pactise any of his instructions.
To whome answered according to his questions: and that had had no conuenient time, otherwise, then when was alone, to doe any of those thinges.
Then he tolde me many thinges of the boye of Burton.
Whereupon, shewing my selfe to haue a desire to goe and see him: M. Darrell said, should doe well in so doing, because that seeing of him in his fittes, might the better learn to do them my selfe afterwards.
Being thus encouraged, went to Burton, where saw Thomas Darling: but perceyuing that a great number of people came likewise to see him, and fearing that some of them might know me, returned to Ashbye, not staying to see Darling in any of his fittes.
At my comming backe againe to M. Darrell, he demaunded of me, whether had seen the boy in any of his fittes: and answered, that had not, for the reason last mentioned: which M. Darrell not well approuing, saide, that might well inough haue stayed to haue seene some of them, because it was not likely, that any there could haue knowne mee.
Then vppon some further occasion of speeches betwixt vs, M. Darrell deliuered vnto me in writing, the particular fittes, which he said Thomas Darling lately had, and did act the most of them himselfe before me, we two being in the parke together alone, by Ashbye.
At that time also, M. Darrell deliuered vnto mee in writing, certain signes and gestures, which were to be vsed, hee said, to signifie sondrie kindes of sinnes: which gestures hee did likewise acte himselfe in the place before mentioned.
Which thinges thus declared and acted by M. Darrell, he would needes see how could doe them, and the other also, which before he had taught mee.
And so vnder a bush in the saide Parke, did act sondrie fittes, vz. these to my remembrance: falling vpon the ground: mouing of my belly: foaming at my mouth: gnashing of my teeth: thrusting out of my tongue, and doubling of the same: drawing of my mouth awrye: staring with mine eyes: turning my face backewardes: the making of two bunches, the one after the other in my face: lying as though had beene senseles, with some others.
Then M. Darrell after had shewed these fittes, did read out of his paper, the gestures before mentioned, to signifie diuerse sorts of sinnes: which he himselfe acting as he read them: lying vpon the ground, did also by his direction imitate the same, wherein if missed, M. Darrell did teach me to doe them better, and saide that with a little practise by my selfe, according to that which he had done, according to his directions giuen me in writing, would quickely learne to doe them perfectly.
But he straightly charged me, that for my life, should keepe these things secrete, saying, that if euer bewrayed them, it might bring vs both in danger of hanging.
These thinges thus finished, tolde M. Darrell, that meant to returne to Nottingham, to see if could get my selfe released from my Maister, and he approuing my purpose therein, said, that when the time serued, might well put all the former thinges in practise there with good effect: and that in so doing hee doubted not, to procure me a release from my maister.
He also told me, that he hauing a sister in law in Nottingham, one Mrs. Wallys, could no sooner name him, when should be thought to be possessed, but that presentlie, and the rather by his sisters meanes, he should be sent for to come vnto me.
And thus far Somers for the proof of all the former particulars, wherewith M. Darrell is charged.
Against this deposition of Somers, there are made sondrie exceptions.
His frends, and likewise he himselfe, are greatly offended, that M. Darrell being a Minister, his oth may not be credited before the oth of a boy.
But M. Darrels oath is greatly impeached by his denying of sondrie thinges, wherewith Somers chargeth him in some others of his bad dealings with him, about his pretended dispossession: the same being deposed by diuerse very sufficient witnesses.
M. Darrell in his Apologie (published since he was condemned for a counterfeyt) doth pretend that this was all which was laid to his charge, concerning his dealing with William Somers at Ashbye, vz. Somers dwelt with Mr. Gray, when dwelt at Ashbye: therefore we two met together in the Parke, and did instruct him.
And there is nothing (sayeth he) but this, besides Somers bare oath, to strengthen his accusation.
It were to be wished, that for his calling sake, he could not otherwise haue beene charged herein: nay rather that he might not haue beene so charged at all: for in such a secret compact, the confessio~ of Somers is of great moment, especially the same being not so bare, (as M. Darrell pretendeth,) but is strengthned with many such circumstances, as do argue the same in all likelyhoode, to be true.
It is confessed by M. Gray, and Mrs. Gray, by M. Darrell himself, that Somers dwelt with M. Gray at Langlye, within
miles of Ashby de la zouch: did run on errands, as Mary Holden the wife now of one Arnold saieth.
M. Darrell at one of his examinations, propounding certaine questions to W. Somers, touching the scituation of Ashbye, the standing of the Church, the schoole and such like, did well perceiue by his answeres vnto them, that hee had beene at Ashbie.
So as there is no impediment in that respect, why he might not meete M. Darrell there, as he hath deposed.
It is also confessed to bee true, that Somers going to dwell with Maister Brakenbury, left certaine bookes at Maister Grayes, as it may appeare by the depositions following.
William Somers told me before the time of his pretended dispossession at Nottingham, that hee had left certaine at Maister Grayes.
And Mrs. Gray, when Somers went from me, he left with one Mary Holden my cook, a coople of bookes in pawne for eight pence.
All that Somers deposeth to this point in effect, appeareth to be true, sauing that, of his writing into one of the books the particular fits, which he sayeth M. Darrell had deliuered vnto him.
And that point was not looked into, because it was found that M. Gray, and Mrs. Gray, were so addicted to M. Darrell in this matter, as there was little hope to trie out the truth thereof amongst their children and seruantes: it being vncertain, who were fit to be examined therein: Marie Holden affirming, that shee had not the bookes, although shee said that Somers owed her two pence.
That Somers practised at M. Brakenburies some such fittes, as he had afterwardes at Nottingham, and that M. Brakenbury accounting him thereupon a dissembler, did discharge him from his seruice, (as he the said Somers hath affirmed,) is thus deposed.
heard it reported by some of my neighbours in Nottingham, that William Somers did play the lewde and counterfeyting boy, whilest he was at M. Brakenburies, and that M. Brakenburie did so account of him, and thereupon did put him out of seruice.
And an other: haue heard that William Somers did practise certaine fittes at Maister Brakenburies, and that M. Brakenburie finding of him as he thought, a counterfeyte, did put him away.
Likewise a thirde: my brother Brakenbury tolde mee, that he thought Somers did dissemble in his fittes, whilest hee was with him, and that he would keepe him no longer.
And M. Darrell himselfe confesseth some thing to this purpose: but obserue how hee would couer that knauerie.
haue heard that whilest Somers dwelt with M. Brakenbury, he was handled after a strange manner.
Likewise that Somers was bound a prentise with Thomas Porter some moneth or fiue weekes, after hee came from M. Brakenburyes, and that hee ranne twise from him, (as he hath deposed,) is acknowledged to bee true, by M. Darrell himselfe.
And so the saide Somers had sufficient oportunitie to goe to Ashbie, and to talke with M. Darrell at such times, as vpon his oath he hath declared.
Furthermore, that Somers in his fittes at Nottingham, before M. Darrels comming thether, did name him the saide Darrel diuerse times (according as he sayeth M. Darrell had instructed him) is deposed by Edmond Garland.
Before M. Darrell was sent for, haue beene present twise or thrise at seuerall times, when William Somers hath in his pretended fittes vsed these wordes: Darrel, Darrell, Darrell.
It sauoreth also of some thing, that Robert Cooper deposeth: how M. Darrell within eight or nine dayes after his comming to Nottingham tolde him, that if he would carefully looke to Somers, he should not loose a penny by him: which sorteth with that deposed by Somers: how if hee would be ruled by M. Darrell, hee should not want.
And the sauour is increased by that which M. Darrell himselfe confesseth, vz. that he was a meanes with some others, to haue a collection made for the reliefe of the saide Cooper: but indeede there were two.
Againe, according to Somers wordes, touching M. Darrels promise, that if hee would put his instructions in practise at Nottingham, hee woulde come thether and release him of his apprentiship, (the same being his chiefe desire), he the said M. Darrell confesseth thus: gaue my worde to Somers his maister, that he should haue thirteene shillinges foure pence to release him of his apprentiship, which afterwardes did performe.
There was such kindnes betwixt M. Darrell and Somers at Nottingham, as being (it may be thoght) old frends: hee and some other of his adherentes entertained him with good cheare: and when afterwardes he was accused to haue bewitched one, M. Darrell dealt with the Maior of Nottingham, that he might be bayled.
Touching the first: well remember (sayeth a Deponent) that the boye was one night at supper with M. Darrell, M. Brinsley, and two Ministers more at the signe of the Castell.
And for the second, (although M. Darrell deny it,) yet M. Aldridge sayeth, that the occasion of Somers bayling, was partly in respect of M. Darrels and his earnestnes with the Maior to that effect.
Moreouer it toucheth M. Darrell somewhat neare, and doth generally argue such a compact to haue beene betwixt him and Somers, in that whilest he was at Nottingham, he had secret conference with him diuerse times.
saw M. Darrell often times talk with my brother alone in my fathers house.
well remember, that William Somers did ofte come to M. Bonners house, whilest M. Darrell lay there, to enquire for M. Darrell, and went to him to his chamber.
saw the boy William Somers come one morning to M. Darrels chamber, and (as remember) no body with him.
came one afternoone to M. Darrels lodging, and there found M. Iohn Beresforde, and the boy with M. Darrell.
And haue heard by good reporte, that the boy did much frequent to goe to M. Darrell at many and seuerall times.
Againe, when Somers was fallen at iarre with M. Darrell, he the said Somers did both write vnto him in a threatning sort, and vse to others, such kind of wordes, as did argue, that there was some packe betwixt them, the opening whereof might much concerne M. Darrell.
In his saide letter, he did write thus, as M. Darrell confesseth.
All thinges that did were counterfeyte, and pray you let it passe, for the more you meddle in it, the more discredit it wil be for you.
And for his words to others, Nicholas Shepheard sayeth: being desirous to know of Somers, what hee meant to write so boldly to M. Darrell, he answered, that M. Darrell had best to let him alone, or else it would turne to both their discredites.
And to the same effect, Iohn Cooper: Many times Somers did speake very hardly of M. Darrell, wishing that hee had neuer knowne him.
Besides, in that M. Darrel hath turned his copy, as touching the Witch, pretended by him, to haue sent her spirite into Somers, it sitteth verie neare vnto him, whilest he was in Nott. little suspecting (as it seemeth) that Somers would haue disclosed their packing at Ashby, or hauing not so throughly foreseen what might fall out in that behalf, he was confident (as he pretended) vpo~ a tale told by Somers in one of his fits, of a certain old woman, that she the said woman had bewitched him, and been the cause of all his trouble.
The tale was, that the Lent before his pretended fits at Nott. he met an old woman on Blackwel that she spake vnto him: that she told him she knew Katherine Wright, that how they two wold come to Nott. vnto him, that she asked him a penny, that he saying he had none, she affirmed he had three pence, how except hee would giue her a penny, she would breake his necke, and throw him into a colepit, (that was neare at hand): that he gaue her thereupon a penny: that shee gaue vnto him a peece of bread and butter, which was the sweetest that euer he did eat of in his life: and that he saw a black cat at that time come vnto her.
Thus far the tale deuised by Somers, as he confesseth as a trick of knauery in one of his fits.
Howbeit M. Darrel hearing the same (in sort as is before expressed,) confesseth that he affirmed for a certainty, or as he verily thought, that the said woman was a Witch, that it was she that had bewitched the boy, had been the cause of all his former trobles.
Wherupon there was a general rumor saith M. Pare, that it was she that had bewitched Somers, none other.
Howbeit al this notwithsta~ding, Darrel now finding, as it may be thoght, that he laid the cause of Somers prete~ded possession to short (in that he the saide Somers had confessed their packing together at Ashbie, doth now ascribe the cause of all the boyes troubles, vnto a woman of Worcestershire, that thereby hee might make it somewhat probable, that Somers counterfeyting at M. Brakenburies, did not proceed from his instructions, (as the boy deposeth:) but from the said woman that had bewitched him.
And thereupon, now both he and his friendes doe giue it out in printe and otherwise, that William Somers became to be possessed by the meanes of a Witch in Worcester, who had sent a wicked spirite into him, called Lucy: and that rumor runneth therby strongly amongst such as do fauour him.
William Somers, being playing his prankes before M. Darrell came to Nottingham, in such sorte as it beganne to be reported that he was possessed, he was vrged (as he sayeth) at one time by some that were present, to tell how he thought, he first grew to be troubled.
Whereupon he deuised this story (as he confesseth of meere knauerie, and to maintain and set forward the opinion already conceyued, that he was possessed,) vz. that whilest he dwelt with M. Brakenburie, he was bewitched as he thought by an old woman, who acco~panied him as hee was going to Bramsgroue: that he denying to giue her a hatband, which he had found in the way, she threatned him: that thereupon the night following, he was frighted, and so began at M. Brakenburies to haue such like fittes, as then hee had at Nottingham: and that in one of his said fits, hee heard something say vnto him, that vpon such a day he wold leaue him, not come to him again, til about
years afterÂ· which time (quoth Somers being now expired, began to be againe troubled, as now you may perceiue: but all these deuises and knaueries of the boye, will not serue M. Darrels turne: it being the common practise of such iuglers, to teach the parties with whom they deale, to attribute their trouble to witches, thereby to make it more probable to the simpler sort, that they are possessed.
And Somers hath els where confessed, M. Darrels course held with him to that effect: and how at their first acquaintance, hee told him, that Katherine Wright was first molested by the meanes of a witch.
Moreouer, hee had heard and read some part of a very ridiculous booke, concerning one M. Throgmortons children, (supposed to haue beene bewitched by a woman of Warbois whereby he saith, that hee learned some points, and was not ignorant, as fit occasion serued, to ascribe what he list to witches.
But all these probabilities and circumstances M. Darrel would auoid, by inforcing diuers supposed contradictions, and impossibilities in Somers deposition.
Somers affirmeth (saith he) that when he repaired to me to be taught, he came from one M. Grayes of Langly (with whom he saith he then dwelt) to Ashbie, where then dwelt, as hee affirmeth: and in a parke there we met.
First, Somers doth not say, that euer hee repaired vnto him to bee taught, but that being with him, he was taught by him.
Secondly, the times of Somers repairing to M. Darrel, were not whilest hee dwelt with M. Gray: but afterwardes, when he was runne from his maister, Thomas Porter of Nottingham.
For Somers onely layeth to M. Darrels charge, that on a time, when hee dwelt with M. Gray, he met him the said Darrel by chance at Ashbie, and was then first instructed by him.
Thirdly, Somers doth not affirme, that M. Darrell dwelt then at Ashbie, when he dwelt at M. Grayes, and met him (as is aforesaid) in Ashbie.
They might meete there together, though Darrell did not then dwell there.
Fourthly, whereas M. Darrell saith, (if he meane plainely) that Somers affirmeth, their meeting in the parke to haue beene whilest he dwelt at M. Grayes: he is therein greatly deceiued.
For their said meeting there was little aboue a yeare, before his pretended dispossession at Nottingham: at what time (hauing seene the boy of Burton by Maister Darrels direction) he returned againe vnto him at Ashbie.
Furthermore, M. Darrell proceeding in the disproofe of Somers imputations laide to his charge, he saith thus.
Now the truth is &c. that Somers was gone from M. Graies fiue yeares before our pretended meeting: For it is nine yeares or there aboutes since he went from M. Graies, and but sixe yeares since went to Ashbie.
If M. Darrell meane their first meeting at Ashbie, it is a palpable vntruth to say, that Somers was gone from M. Grayes fiue yeares before that time: if hee vnderstand their last meeting in the parke, hee was gone in deede from M. Graies aboue three yeares before that time, but not fiue.
But where he saith it is nine yeares or there aboutes, since Somers went from Maister Grayes, and but sixe yeares since he went to Ashbie: if that were true he said somewhat.
For the clearing therefore of these two particulars: First, M. Gray and Mistres Gray being interrogated
how long it was since Somers left their seruice: the one saith: more then sixe yeare past: and the other, about sixe yeares as they remember.
But there is some better certainty to bolt out the truth herein.
Somers was bound prentise (as M. Darrell confesseth) with Thomas Porter, about a moneth or fiue weeks after he was discharged of M. Brakenburies seruice: and Somers saith, that hee remained little aboue a quarter of a yeare (if so long) with Maister Brakenburie: and it will be confessed, that he went from M. Graies to dwell with Maister Brakenbury.
So as if wee can find when Somers was bounde prentise, it will appeare how long it is since hee dwelt at maister Graies.
Now the Indenture it selfe whereby hee was bound, is to bee seene amongst the rest of the examinations: and it beareth date the seuenth of May, in the
yeare of her Maiestie: whereby it is manifest, the premises being true, that it is not yet seuen yeares since Somers dwelt with M. Gray, which iumpeth both with his, his wiues depositions, controlleth M. Darrels nine yeares.
And touching that which M. Darrell affirmeth, vz. that it is but sixe yeares since he went to Ashbie: it is well he limiteth himself to sixe yeares.
If he had said but foure, he might haue beene put in mind by a certaine token of the vntruth therein.
yeares past in one of his sermons at Ashbie (as there is aduertisement giuen in writing) vpon the seuenteenth day of Nouember (the day of the beginning of her Maiesties most happie raigne ouer this kingdome) falling then vpon the Sonday: he inueighed mightily against the people there, for ringing the bels as they do throughout all the realme, in signification of their ioye, and thanksgiuing vnto Almighty God, for the beginning and continuance of her Highnesse most Christian and blessed gouernment: and his zeale, or rather furie, was so seruent therein, as hee tearmed their said ringing, to bee the prophaning of the Sabboth, said they were all in danger thereby of Gods heauie displeasure, or to that effect.
Although it were true, that it is but sixe yeares, since hee went to Ashbie, yet that is not greatly materiall: for he might come to dwell there a yeare or two after his first acquaintance with Somers, without any contradiction to that which Somers hath deposed.
Howbeit (if the information since giuen bee true) he doth therein forget himselfe: for it is reported, that he dwelt in one Perrins house in Ashbie about one yere, then in one Io. Hollands about sixe yeares, and lastly in William Swinsons, about a yeare and a halfe: which being laid together, doe amount to about eight yeares and a halfe.
Whereunto, (if Maister Darrell doe not still continue his familie there, but haue dwelt since a yeare or two at Nottingham that time also since he departed thence, may also be added.
So that for ought that M. Darrell doth here alleadge for himselfe, there doth nothing appeare, but that all may be true that Somers hath deposed, touching their seueral meetings together at Ashbie.
The last circumstance obserued here, for the iustification of Somers deposition in this matter, is this: that as soone as Somers was supposed by some in Nottingham to bee possessed, Mistres Wallis, according to M. Darrels former wordes (as Somers hath deposed) did presently send for Maister Darrell to come vnto him: which circumstance had in this place beene omitted, but that it ministreth a fitte occasion to proceed with Somers confession, how hee demeaned himselfe, after his last departure from M. Darrell at Ashbie.
Hauing (saith he) thus left Maister Darrel, went towards Nottingham, and comming thither, procured my father in law to deale with M. Maior, to be a meanes to my maister, that might be deliuered from mine apprentiship.
Whereupon was compelled to stay with him againe, and so did, till by Maister Darrels meanes was deliuered from him.
During this my continuance with my Maister, found my selfe to be as hardly vsed before, and my maintenance with him rather worse then better.
Besides, did better perceiue, that my Maister could teach me nothing, being himselfe brought vp with a Weauer, and hauing no skill at all in musicke.
Furthermore, vnderstood by his speeches oftentimes, that he meant to keepe me as his apprentise, not onely for the rest of the yeares that was bound vnto him, but for the time also that had beene absent from him.
Whereby, obseruing that he meant to keepe me as his seruant about foure yeares to come, confesse that to bee released from him according as M. Darrell had promised me, did beginne the course that M. Darrell had wished me before to vndertake.
And first, feygned my selfe to haue a swelling in my bellie, pretending thereby to haue great paine: which my Maister told me was nothing els but some colde, that did procure the collicke, and gaue me a drinke, and some other things for it.
Afterwards, when pretended to haue the said collicke, did make shew at sundry times of many wilde lookes and gestures, and about a moneth or three weekes before S. Martins day last (as remember) beganne to fall more roundly to my worke, according to my former instructions.
At one time, making a motion in my bellie, in the presence of one M. Euans Curate at S. Maries in Nottingham: hee, coniecturing thereby that some quicke thing was in my bellie began to make a doubt, as if were possessed.
This Euans dwelt next house to my maister, and comming often vnto mee, brought with him Iohn Sherrart the Clearke of Saister Maries, who diuers times told me of M. Throckmortons children in Huntingtonshire how they were possessed: and hauing a printed booke thereof, hee declared to Euans in my hearing, the manner of the fits that M. Throgmortons children had.
Whereby learned something more then knew before, and did still proceed further and further in my dissimulatinn, as M. Darrel had taught me.
By which occasion M. Euans and the said Clearke grew to bee perswaded, that was in deed possessed, sent for M. Aldridge the preacher of S. Maries, to come vnto me: who refusing twice or thrice, came at the last: being greatly afraid when he saw me in my fits, he gaue it out for a certainty was possessed.
And then the bruite thereof grew to bee very rise, and many both of the towne and countrie came to see me.
At whose comming would be in my dissembled fits, and call oft for M. Darrel: sometimes railing against him, and sometimes willing him to bee sent for, according to our former agreement.
And at one time amongst the rest, whilest was in my said fits, making mention of Maister Darrell, Mistres Wallis his wiues sister was present: who being perswaded with the rest that was possessed, did affirme to sundry persons in my hearing, that her brother, M. Darrel had deliuered nine, that had beene possessed, and said that she would cause him to be sent for.
And accordingly one Hugh Wilson was hyred to go for him.
Of M. Darrels priuate directions to Somers whilest hee was at Nottingham with him, how he should from time to time behaue himselfe in his counterfeiting.
FOr the further strengthening of the general charge exhibited against M. Darrel before her Maiesties said commissioners, to proue his proceedings with Somers to haue beene meerelie counterfeited: he is further accused: that he finding the said Somers at Nottingha~, playing acting of certain tricks signes (as they tearme them) of possession, did by his priuate instructions so leade him on, from one dissembling course to an other, as it was sufficient to teach him in that behalfe what hee had to do, although the matter had neuer beene plotted, betwixt them before at Ashbie.
It is manifest, that as Somers had counterfeited certaine fits toyish behauiour at M. Brakenburies: so he was acting the like when M. Darrell came vnto him at Nottingha~.
But to omit who it was that taught him so to do, it is here to be considered with what craft cunning he did proceed with him.
of Nouember that M. Darrel came to Nott. he could haue no priuate speeches with the boy, by reason of the company that were then present.
of Nouemb. before Church time, M. Darrel came vnto me, told me wherein had done wel ouer night (for the night before he had plaied his feates very artificially) wherein had failed, wishing me to acte my fits more boldly more liuely.
He also then signified vnto mee, that the next day he meant to haue a fast, and said, that then must act the fits he had taught me as a hee should make mention of them, promising that in his sermon he would name them with such leisure, as might haue time to acte them one after an other in order.
of Nouember, also M. Darrel came againe vnto me, before the fast began, and asked me if remembred all that was to doe that day.
To whome answering, that thought should not forget to doe them as hee expected: M. Darrell said, thou must in deed shew thy selfe this day, as it were once for all.
The same morning saith he, that the boy of Burton, and the seuen in Lancashire were to bee brought to the places where the fasts appointed, were held for their dispossessing, the Deuill knowing himselfe to haue but a short time of dwelling in them, did cast them into sundry fittes, and did trouble them more, then at any time before.
In so much as when some were sent to will their friendes to make them readie, they brought word to him the saide Maister Darrell and others, in what case they founde them.
Whereupon quoth Maister Darrell) we were driuen to send sixe or seuen at euery such time, to bring them by force to the said place: which sixe or seuen were very much troubled in the cariage the~.
And euen so said M. Darrel, the like order shalbe taken with thee this morning.
Anone one shal be sent to see if thou be readie: at what time thou shalt shew thy selfe to be much troubled in thy sits.
Vpon signification whereof, sixe or seuen shall come to bring thee vpon their shoulders, whom thou maiest greatly trouble in their cariage of thee, by strugling with them, as others that were possessed did: and as though the Deuill had compelled thee so to doe, being verie loth to come to so godly an exercise.
Shortly after Maister Darrels departure, all thinges were done accordingly.
One Langford was sent to see if were readie: at whose comming did make shew of my greatest fits, in an vnquiet manner.
Thereupon the said Langforde returning to Maister Darrell, by and by seuen came to carrie me, whom (as thinke) did very much trouble: and whereupon it was giuen out, that was so heauie in my fittes, as seuen were scarce able to carrie me.
For the iustification of these particulars thus set downe by Somers, there are few depositions.
Howbeit M. Darrel (notwithstanding his general deniall before mentioned:) yet he confesseth somewhat, which tendeth to the confirmation of this his second conference with Somers: sent (saith William Langford) that morning, to take order for the present bringing of Somers to Smalles house, M. Langford brought me word backe, that so soone as hee spake of the boyes remouing, he was presently cast into a sore fit.
And againe: The boy was brought by sixe or seuen strong men, who had all of them enough to doe, to bring him to the next conuenient and seemely roome, to the place of his abode: he meaneth to Smalles house.
The fast being ended, Somers dispossessed (as it was pretended) M. Darrell gaue vnto Somers instructions priuately, how to behaue himselfe in a new matter, that he was to take in hand concerning his behauiour, when pretence should be made, that the deuil sought againe to repossesse him.
The same night after my supposed deliuerance, M. Darrell came vnto me, and tolde me, that as yet my former practises must not be quite giuen ouer, saying, that the continuance of them would turne both to his and my great benefite.
And then hee further signifyed vnto me, how after that Katherine Wright, the boye of Burton, and the seauen in Lancashire were dispossessed, the Deuill did seeke to enter into them againe, and came for that purpose vnto them in diuerse similitudes, as of a Rat, a dogge, a catte, an olde man, an Ape, a toade, a mouse, &c. Whereupon saide he, for a good while after, they were not perfectly well, but awaking out of their sleepes, and at other times starting, they would cry, away with that dogge, keepe away that catte, and so sometimes besides the former beastes specifyed, they would make mention of Lyons, Dragons, Bulles, &c.
And so quoth M. Darrell to me, thou maiest easily doe. Whereunto agreede, and did after put the same in practise, as occasion serued accordingly.
After that Somers had continued his new begunne practises about a fortnight (in which time he had played many feates vnder a couerlette, as afterwardes shall bee shewed,) then by M. Darrelles direction, hee fell into a new course, which was of the detecting of certaine persons for Witches.
did then (sayeth Somers) vndertake an other matter concerning certaine Witches, according to M. Darrels former directions.
For he had tolde me before, that the boy of Burton, and the seauen in Lancashire had detected certaine Witches, and that might do the like.
Also he had said vnto me, that when the Witches detected by them, were comming vnto the saide parties, whome the Deuilles sought to repossesse: they the saide parties were wonderfully afflicted, vntill the saide Witches came vnto them, and then the Witches being come, and standing by them, the said parties lay still, and so continuing till they were departed, they grew againe after the Witches were going away to be as sore troubled, as they were at their comming.
And thus quoth M. Darrell) thou maiest doe as occasion shall serue.
Hereupon beganne about the xxv. of Nouember (as thinke) in my pretended fittes, to make mention of Witches: and likewise when they were brought vnto me, did pretend as though had beene greatly vexed, vntill they came to my beds side: and then lay still as though had beene a sleepe, vntill they departed: When did againe dissemble my selfe to bee troubled as before.
In these my pretended fittes, this was my manner, vz. Looke where mother Higget standes, take her away, and so of diuerse others to the number of six or seauen: as Alice Freeman, Thomas Groues, William Bend, and his wife, widdowe Boote: my Aunt Else: Millicent Horseley and her sister.
This report of my naming of the saide parties for Witches, was presentlie spread abroad, as to haue beene done by mee through the deuilles skill, in vsing my tongue: whereas do constantlie professe, that onely named them, because had knowne them before to haue been commonly suspected for Witches.
of December, Somers did growe weary of his new kinde of dissimulation, hauing now continued as long in troubling himselfe about Witches, as he had done before in his trickes vnder the Couerlette.
And therupon contrary to M. Darrels perswasions gaue them all ouer, and forbare any further practises, til about the xiiii. of Ianuary following.
About the beginning of December, did growe verie wearie of all my former practises, and thereupon did wholie leaue them, contrary to M. Darrels good liking: who endeuoured to perswade me still to continue in them.
But when he coulde not preuaile with me so farre, although he alledged that it woulde bee an hindrance both to him and mee: and that this course begunne, was not hetherto finished, as it ought to be: then M. Darrell gaue it out, that the Deuill would lye lurking about a man, without troubling of him, sometimes a moneth, sometimes a quarter of a year, and sometimes more.
Whilest thus continued without making any shew of trouble, M. Darrell had priuate speeches with me, sometimes in his owne lodging at M. Bonners, and sometimes walking alone in S. Maries Churchyeard.
And alwaies his speeches tended to this effect: that must not as yet desist from my former practises.
But for any thing that he could say vnto me, gaue that course ouer, for the space of about six weekes.
After many perswasions vsed by M. Darrell, that Somers would vndertake againe his former courses: and vpon some other occasions, (as afterwards it will appeare) he the said Somers falling into his former fittes, M. Darrell presentlie gaue it out, that now he was repossessed, accordingly as hee had foretold, both priuately and in his sermons, that it would come to passeÂ· and then gaue him further instructions, how in his old fits, hee should behaue himselfe after a new fashion.
When had entred againe into this course (saieth Somers,) M. Darrell told me of certaine words, that as he said the boy of Burton had vsed, vz. he fell and caught him, willed me to vse some sentences, or dark sayings, that therby such as should hear me, might wonder the more at me.
And accordingly, in one of my next fits, when M. Darrell was present, (as he was verie seldome absent at such times) vttered amongst some other vain speeches, the words before mentioned: hee fel and caught him.
Which words had no sooner deliuered, but M. Darrell taking hold of them, presentlie said.
good people pray you marke this: for it is a matter of importance, the verie same words the Deuill vttered in the boy of Burton: whereby you may obserue the occasion that the Deuill did againe repossesse him.
Furthermore according to M. Darrels former aduice, inuented and deliuered in an other of my fits these words: the saide stone is softe and the bolder, and flint is hard.
Which wordes M. Darrell being present, did expound to this effect: vz. that by these stones were meant the magistrates of Nottingham, signifying, that some of them had soft heartes to belieue the mightie workes of God, and that some of them were so hard hearted as they would belieue nothing, although God himselfe shoulde come downe from heauen amongst them, thereby condemning such as did affirme, that was but a dissembler.
At the same time also, vsed these speeches: he that runnes on the Ice, let him take heed least he slippe: and these also, he that standes on a hil, let him tumble downe, and he will be the sooner at the bottome: which wordes M. Darrell did likewise expound: but could not well heare him, by reason of the noyse, which was at that time in the place where lay, and therefore cannot tell what sense he made of them.
When Somers had continued his fits again, wherby he was deemed to be repossessed about three weeks or somewhat more, he was verie wearie of them, and would haue giuen them ouer: but M. Darrell would not permitte him so to doe: but kept him in his former course by the space of about a weeke after, vz. vntill the xxiiii. of the said moneth of February, that the Maior of Nottingham, did then vpon good occasion seaze him into his hands.
Hauing remayned about foure weekes in this course, grew againe verie wearie of it, and did refrayne sometimes two or three daies together from my former trickes, and walked abroad as thought meete.
Hereof aduertised M. Darrell priuately in his chamber, saying, that was determined to giue that course ouer: But M. Darrell answered me, that might not in any wise so doe as yet: that in so doing should bring them both into great danger, peraduenture of their liues: and therefore willed mee to persist, promising that if would be aduised by him, should neuer want.
But all his perswasions notwithstanding, still affirmed, that would no longer continue in my former dissimulation, and further saide, that if might not be suffered to be quiet leaue it with his good liking: was fully minded to tell all that came vnto me, from that time forward, that all had done from my first pretended trouble was but dissembled.
Well, quoth M. Darrell) if thou wilt not follow my counsell, it will be worse for thee, and will doe well inough with thee.
For afterwardes when some came to see me, told them plainely in the hearing of M. Darrell, that had dissembled all that had done.
Whereupon M. Darrell being offended, saide to those that hearde me, that they might not in any sort belieue me, because it was not William Somers, but the Deuill that so saide, and willed them therefore to holde me.
So as was at my wits end what shoulde doe: because Darrell had got such credite, as whatsoeuer hee saide was belieued to be true.
After had thus confessed my selfe to be a dissembler, was restrayned by M. Darrels meanes from going abroade, except two or three, such as he liked, were in my company: which was the cause that fell againe, for the space of about a weeke vnto my former dissimulation, vntill had therby gotten more libertie: and then meeting with one Iohn Cooper of Nottingham, the keeper of the poore in S. Iohns, did reueale my mind in part vnto him, telling him, that woulde gladly remaine with him, whereby might bee quiet at the last.
All that hetherto hath beene saide, for the proofe of this seco~d general accusation, laid to Darrels charge, doth pend especially vppon Somers owne deposition.
And in this case little more is to be expected.
For it had been madnes in M. Darrell, if he had not taken such a course in the instructing of him, as hee might bee sure none knew but Somers: and then he doubteth not (it seemeth) but that if the worst fell out, his credite would bee sufficient to ouerweigh the boyes.
For although the circumstances before mentioned in the first Chapter, should be thought insufficient to conuince M. Darrell of his practising with Somers at Ashby.
Yet manie of them together with the boyes oath are very pregnant proofes of this second accusation.
For example, M. Darrels vndertaking that the boyes Father in law should not loose a penny by him, deposed by Robert Cooper.
Likewise his procuring of a collection for Cooper: confessed by himselfe.
Also his priuate conference so oft with Somers: which fower likewise haue deposed.
Moreouer his buying out of Somers years: acknowledged by himselfe.
Furthermore, his earnest dealing, for the bayling of Somers, when he was charged with fellony: deposed by M. Aldridge.
Again, his entertayning of Somers at an Inne or Tauerne: as George Richardson doth affirme.
Againe, Somers threatning of Darrell, when they were fallen out: as M. Darrell himselfe confesseth.
And againe, Somers his wishing, that he had neuer seen M. Darrell: as Iohn Copper deposeth.
Of Darrels instructing of Somers by speaking to others in his hearing, those thinges which he meant that he should practise from the fift of Nouember, when he came vnto him, vntil the seauenth of the same, being the day of his pretended dispossession FOr a thirde proofe of the aforesaide generall complaint, exhibited before her Maiesties saide Commissioners: that M. Darrel did counterfeyt with Somers concerning his pretended dispossessio~: he the said M. Darrell is charged to haue dealt with the boy at Nottingham, so cunningly, as that albeit he had neuer seene him at Ashbie, nor dealt with him priuately at Nottingham: (both which pointes haue been prooued in the two former Chapters): yet the course which hee held with him there, and with those that came to see him in his fits, was so contriued, as it might easily informe Somers what he had to do, and did indeed blind misleade many of the people.
Which second point, vz. the seducing of the people, was as necessarie for M. Darrell to compas as the former.
For otherwise both hee and the boy might haue dissembled, till their heartes had aked, if no man had belieued them.
This accusation reacheth to such M. Darrels last mentioned practises, from the time that hee came first vnto him at Nottingham, being the
Howbeit, for the more perspicuity, and in respect of the variety of the matters, that fell out within the compas of that time, this Chapter comprehendeth, but his cunning and sleightes to the purpose here expressed, from the said fift of Nouember, vntill the seauenth of the same, when it was pretended that Somers was dispossessed.
It being agreede vpon by all those, who in these latter times doe take vpon them the chiefest skill in casting out Deuilles, that it is a matter of especiall great difficultie to discerne truly who is possessed, because there haue been, daily is, and may be hereafter so great dissimulation and falshoode practised in that behalfe, as partlie it doth appeare in the first booke of this treatise: yet M. Darrel hauing neuer seen VV. Somers (as he now pretendeth), did affirme, that he the saide Somers was certainelie possessed by a wicked spirite, vpon the rude report of a simple man, one Hugh Wilson, and vppon a letter receyued by Wilson from his sister in law, one Mistresse Wallys.
Being certified in my sisters letter by the messe~gers further speeches, of the ma~ner of Somers fittes, did send them worde, that those thinges being true, the saide Somers was possessed, and this did before saw Somers.
And herein M. Darrell was so confident vpon so light a report, as in his iorney towardes Nottingham, (the said fift of Nouember), hee tooke M. Iretons house in his way, and tolde him (as he confesseth), vz. of the possession of William Somers, that he was sent for to come to him: that he was purposed to haue a fast for his dispossession, and that he doubted not of good successe, by that means to procure the boyes deliuerance.
This M. Darrels confident bragging, being directly against one of his Maisters rules, that hee doubted not of good successe, as it argueth his ignorance: so the same being ioyned to his rash credulitie, doth make it probable, that eyther hee had layed his plotte with the boy before, or else that he knew verie well, how by his counning to draw on the boy, for the seruing of his turn, as he himselfe list.
More might be collected hereof, but where other matters are so pregnant, it is needelesse to insist vpon it.
The chiefest meanes whereby M. Darrell did seduce the people, and cunningly instruct Somers, without suspition in any that belieued him, were these two false grounds, (whereof in the first booke), vz. that those who are possessed, haue in their fittes no vse of their senses or faculties of their mindes, and that whatsoeuer they eyther doe or say at such times, it is not they but Sathan that doth both say and doe it.
Whereuppon purposing to goe to Nottingham, hee first prepared his way, by laying (as he could) a sutable to that which he meant to builde vpon: vz. that vppon the foresaide bare relation of Hugh Wilson, and before he had then seene Somers, he sent word by him to Nottingham, that hee the said Somers was in his fittes senseles, and that all hee then did or spake was done by the Deuill.
Maister Darrell, among many speeches had with me, told me, that Somers in his fits was without reason, and did pronounce, that if the boy were so handled, as had told him, then by the example of others, with whom (as he said) he had beene, hee neyther heares (quoth he) sees, nor feeles any thing.
Hugh Wilson, vpon his returne from M. Darrell, came to my house, and did report, that M. Darrell said, that the boy was altogether senceles in his fits: that it was not he, but the euill spirit within him, that made him so vnquiet.
Hugh Wilson did report at his returne, that M. Darrell said, that Somers in his fits had no sence, and therefore willed that he should not bee troubled at such times, and that when the said Somers did speake or do any thing in the said fittes, it was not hee the said Somers, but the Deuill that so did, or spake in him.
Concerning these two grounds of M. Darrels, it is not much impertinent that Robert Cooper deposeth in this sort, vz.
The chiefe deceit which was vsed to bleare all their eyes at Nottingham, was the perswasion beaten into them by M. Darrell, that the boy was sencelesse in all his fittes, and that when hee seemed to speake, it was not he, but the Deuil that spake in him.
Besides, M. Darrell is further charged, that as hee had sent worde to Nottingham, that Somers was possessed, be fore he had seene him: so at his comming vnto him thither, he said he was possessed before hee had seene him in any fit: especially such a fit as might not easily bee counterfeited.
of Nouember, did not then affirme William Somers to be possessed, before had seene him in any such fittes, as can not be counterfeited.
And being here demaunded to set downe what signes he saw him then acte, that he thought could not be counterfeited, hee answered: that he saw a certaine extraordinarie swelling in his bodie, beside certaine signes mentioned in the scriptures.
But he would not be drawne to name any of them.
And it had beene good for him that hee had not mentioned the said swelling: but confessed the truth plainly: for that which he hath here denied is proued directly.
At M. Darrels first comming to the towne before hee saw the boy, he said he was possessed.
When M. Darrel did first see the boy at his comming to Nottingham, he said that he was possessed, notwithstanding that he was not in any fitte.
Vpon M. Darrels first comming to William Somers, he did presently affirme vpon the sight of the boy, that he was possessed.
At M. Darrels first going to Somers, he heard him say, that out of doubt the boy was possessed.
M. Darrell did then (vz. at his first comming, and before the boy had any fit) affirme to those that were present, that William Somers was possessed.
Furthermore, it was obiected against M. Darrell, that as he had sent word to Nottingham, before he had seene the boy, that those things which hee seemed to speake in his fits, were not spoken by him but by the Deuill: so vpon his first comming vnto him, notwithstanding that he the said Somers did answere him directly: yet he the said Darrell affirmed, that it was not Somers, but the deuill.
M. Darrell doth confesse some part hereof: but the rest that he denieth is sufficiently proued.
thought (saith he) that certaine wordes then spoken by Somers were not spoken by Sathan.
And was moued so to thinke, because being perswaded that he was possessed, and hauing read in the scriptures, that the deuill doth speake in those that are possessed.
did thereupon say, that thought it was the deuill that spake in Somers.
asked of Somers the same night a question about some matter of faith and principle of religion: whereunto Somers made a fit answere, but with such gestures, as supposed the said answer to proceed from Sathan.
What follie, boldnes, and ignorance appeareth in these two depositions may easily be espied: his falshood also is as manifest by the depositions ensuing.
M. Darrell then affirmed, that when Somers in his fits spake or did any thing, it was not he, but the deuil, that so did, or spake in him.
M. Darrel asked Somers that night how he did, he answered, wel thanke God.
Whereunto M. Darrel replied: doubt it is not W. Somers that speakes vnto me.
M. Darrell demaunded of Somers what was his name: who answering, that his name was VVilliam, smiling therewith: he the said M. Darrel looked very earnestly vpon him, and then said to the standers by: am afraid it is not William that speaketh: whereat the boy fell a laughing againe.
The boy then lay as if he were a sleep, when hee awaked, M. Darrell asked him where he had beene, and he said no where, but a sleep: and then M. Darrel said, feare it is not VVilliam that speaketh vnto me.
This in like manner M. Darrell denyeth, as he hath done the rest.
Also M. Darrell was charged, that as he had said before he came to Nottingham, that Somers was in his fits senceles: so the first night of his comming to the boy, he affirmed the same againe to many in the presence of the said boy: whereunto M. Darrel answered thus: do not belieue that said that night, that Somers was in his fits sencelesse.
Maister Darrel affirmed, that night that William Somers had no sence in his fits, and said to the people: dare assure you that the boy doth not know what he doth in his fits.
Maister Darrell bad that night: let the boy alone: for hee neither knowes, nor sees any thing.
The former three points first laid: vz. that Somers was possessed: that those things which hee seemed to speake, were spoken by the Deuill, and that hee was in his fittes sencelesse: For as much as he deemed it not sufficient, to perswade those that were present for him to affirme the same barely: hee alleadged his experience for them all in the boies presence: saying, that Somers was troubled in like manner and sorte to Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seuen in Lancashire, who had all of them beene possessed.
Out of doubt the boy is possessed (quoth M. Darrel that night the boy being present) for my experience is such, that know it, by the example of seuen in Lankashire, the boy of Burton, Katherine Wright, who had the like fits that this boy hath.
Somers falling into a laughter that night, M. Darrel said, know this was not the voice of William Somers.
And then added: this boy is as the boy of Burton was.
M. Darrel said that night (Somers being present that the boy was possessed, and that he did as the boy of Burton did.
M. Darrel did that night affirme in the presence of the boy, that diuers others that had beene possessed naming the boy of Burton, Katherine Wright, and the seuen in Lankashire) had beene troubled euen as William Somers then was.
M. Darrel affirmed the same night (the boy being present) that William Somers was possessed in the very like manner, that Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seuen in Lankashire were possessed.
Maister Darrel affirmed then to those that were present with the boy, that William Somers was possessed, that in his fittes he had no sence, and that when he spake or did any thing in them, it was not he but the Deuill, that so did and spake in him.
And this the said Darrell affirmed to bee true, because in his experience, others being possessed, did shew the like signes, who had no sence in their fits: and in whom the Deuill spake and did as is before expressed.
Besides M. Darrell was charged, to haue specified the same night in the presence of Somers, diuers others, the manner of such fits as the possessed had in the scriptures, and of those which were seene (as hee said) in Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seuen in Lankashire: that in their fits they would cast themselues into the fire, and sometimes into the water: that they would teare themselues, gnash with their teeth, writh their necks as though their faces had stoode almost backwardes: draw their mouthes farre awrie: and lift vp their bellies.
Vnto all these particulars M. Darrell answereth thus: doe belieue they are true.
Againe, M. Darrell was charged, that after he had told the manner of the fits, (as last before he hath confessed) he then also said to the persons present in the hearing of Somers: that he the said Somers would do the like.
M. Darrel hauing declared (the first night in the presence of the boy) what strange fittes Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seuen in Lankashire had, he then said: vz.
M. Darrell hauing named (the first night the boy being present) certaine signes which the possessed vse, he further said: vz.
If the boy be possessed you shall see such signes in him.
She heard M. Darrell say at that time (vz. the first night) before Somers: If this boy be possessed, hee will foame and wallow and gnash, and many other such like: and by and by hee did some of them.
When Mayster Darrel had shewed them &c. hee said that would do them all, he was sure, and many more before it was long.
Whereuppon knowing his meaning, beganne to put some of those sits in practise, whereby they that were confirmed in that which M. Darrell had told them of my possessing.
And M. Darrel did with some earnestnes confirme them therein, as hauing himselfe (as he said) good experience in such matters.
After that Somers for a time had practised some of those fits, (whereof M. Darrel had made mention,) and said hee would doe the like, to the great admiration of those that were present, and his owne no small reputation: (he but speaking the word, and all things falling out accordingly) then he was charged to haue proceeded to some other points, and to tell them in Somers hearing, that he the said Somers was not so much troubled for his own sinnes, as for the sins of the people, or of the inhabitantes in Nottingham.
At that time M. Darrel affirmed in the hearing of Somers) that he the said Somers was not punished so much for his owne sinnes, or for the sinnes of his parents, as for the sinnes that raigned in Nottingham.
And so hee affirmed of Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seuen in Lancashire.
M. Darrel made a godly exhortation to those that were present, that euery man should be careful to looke to his owne waies, because otherwise the like iudgement of God might well enough happen vnto them.
For (saith he, in the hearing of the boy) this boy is not so much troubled for his owne sinnes, as for the sinnes of the people.
M. Darrel said the same night in Somers presence, that the boy was very euill troubled, and out of doubt it was not for his owne sinnes, but for your sinnes (meaning her, and her mother) and others.
M. Darrel said, that out of question, was not possessed eyther for mine owne sinnes, or for the sinnes of my father and mother onely, but for the sinnes that rained in Nottingham.
When M. Darrel had laid downe his conceit touching the cause of Somers trouble: then he was charged to haue affirmed in the presence of the boy, that Sathan did vse to shew by gestures in those that were possessed, the particular sinnes that raigned in those places where they dwelt.
M. Darrel told them that were present diuers tales of the boy of Burton, of Katherine Wright, how in their fittes they shewed by gestures, the especiall sinnes that raigned in those places where they dwelt.
M. Darrell then and there deliuered before Somers and the people present, that the deuill did vse the partes and members of those that were possessed, so as by signes and gestures he doth often vse to signifie the particular sinnes raigning in those places, where the possessed be.
M. Darrel said that night in the presence of Somers) that it was a practise of the deuill, by signes and diuers gestures to shew the sinnes of other men.
After that M. Darrel had thus shewed his cunning concerning sathans accustomed practise last mentioned then he was also further charged, to haue affirmed in the hearing of Somers, and presence of many, that hee verily thought the deuill would doe the like in Somers, and declare by signes and gestures the sinnes of Nottingham and of others.
When M. Darrell had mentioned these points, hee told the parties present, that the deuill no doubt woulde make me to put them in practise.
Maister Darrel then said in the presence of the boy: that now those who would not belieue the word of God, should bee driuen to acknowledge and confesse their sinnes by the meanes of the Deuill, who would in this boy preach vnto them their sinnes, by shewing the same by certaine gestures of the boyes.
Wherupon the boy lying vpon a bed, began to vse many gestures: as of dauncing, fighting, robbing, drunkennes, whoredome, &c. as they are put put downe since in a ballade.
M. Darrel discoursed that night in the presence of Somers) of the sinnes that raigned in the world, which the Deuill would make shew of.
Somers being an apt scholler for Maister Darrell to practise vpon, hearing by Maister Darrels speeches, what he was to doe, and what was expected at his handes: did leape and skip vpon a bed, and make many signes and gestures: Wherewith (saith Somers all that were present were much amazed: being deceiued with that errour, which Maister Darrel had taught them, that though were present coulde heare none of those thinges, that bee had then tolde them.
Of these gestures though they were but very rude grosse: yet M. Darrell (as his manner is to make euery thing straunge that Somers did) giueth them this report.
These thinges (saith he, meaning the sinnes that Somers had gestured were in such liuely and orient colours painted out vnto vs, that were present, being to the number of some sixtie, that doe verily thinke, that it is not in the skill and power of man to doe the like.
With these gestures Maister Darrel it seemeth was so greatly delighted, as hee coulde not chuse but giue some apparant shew thereof.
For he was in this place charged by her Maiesties said Commissioners, that whilest Somers was acting of them, he himselfe did expounde them very learnedly, to signifie this or that sinne that raigned in Nottingham.
As did vse any of the said gestures, oh would M. Darrell say, to the standers by: see you not how he doth thus, and thus? These thinges signifie that such and such sinnes doe raigne in this towne.
They also that were present hauing heard M. Darrell, would as tossed with my handes, and tumbled vppe and down vppon my bed, presentlie collect and say: oh, hee doth so for this sinne, and so for that sinne, whereby it came to passe, that could doe nothing in any of my fittes, eyther that night or the day after, eyther stirre my head, or any part of my body: looke merily, or sadly, sitte or lye speake or be silent, open or shutte mine eyes, but some would still make an interpretation of it: as to be done by the Deuill in me, to declare such sinnes in Nottingham, as they themselues imagined.
Amongst other collections, that M. Darrell made by sondrie of my gestures: some he saide the Deuill did in me, to signifie my owne sinnes, as those of dauncing, of Vyols and instrumentes, being an apprentise to a Musition.
Likewise my turning the toppe of my toungue towardes my throate.
Maister Darrell saide, that it is signified how hadde vsed it to sing filthye songes.
When Somers beganne his gestures, M. Darrell affirmed that they were the signes, whereby the Deuill shewed the sinnes that raigned in Nottingham, and did himselfe interprete some of them, and by the course of his interpretation, many present seeing the gestures which were plaine, did take vpon them likewise to expound them, affirming this signe to note such a sinne, and that signe some other sinne.
And in the end quoth M. Darrell,) beholde did not tell you so? This is the Deuill, By this course the people were very much amazed, as thinking the Deuill to preach so vnto them, and to note the sinnes that raigned in that towne.
M. Darrell when the boy was in his fittes, and acting certaine gestures, did interprete the said gestures, to mean and declare the sinnes that raigned in Nottingham.
The first night that M. Darrell came, the boy acting certain gestures, he the said Darrell did interprete them, to signifie the sinnes that raigned in Nottingham.
Somers did acte his dumb fitt, consisting of gestures, which Maister Darrell did say, did signifie the sinnes of the people, and when the boy laughed, (as he would laugh extreamely at the end of some of his dumbe gestures), then Maister Darrell wold say, that it was the deuill that laughed, to shew the ioy that he had in regard that he had brought them to commit such sins, as those gestures signified.
The dumbe shewes which Somers did expresse in his fittes that night, both Maister Darrell and all the standers by did conceiue and apprehend, that the sins raigning in Nottingham, and else where abroade, were represented vnto them very liuely: and so much (I thinke) was declared both by M. Darrell and others at that time.
remember that the Lady Zouch, and Mistresse Gray, had the most talke, and did especially interprete some of the said signes: and that when sondrie that were present would aske what such a thing meant that Somers did: they, the said Lady Zouch, and Mrs. Gray would tell the meaning of it, what sinne it did signifie.
Likewise Maister Darrell himselfe, although hee disclameth for his parte the expounding of any of the saide gestures: yet he is pleased to tell vs what sins were then set out by Somers, in such sort, as Roscius himself could not haue done it better.
This euening (sayeth he), he acted many sins by signes gestures, most liuely representing shaddowing, them out vnto vs: as namely brawling, quarreling, fighting, swearing, robbing by the high waies, picking, and cutting of purses, burglary, whoredome, pride in men and women, hypocrisie, sluggishnes in hearing of the word, drunkennes, gluttony, also dancing with the toyes thereunto belonging, the manner of Anticke dancers, the games of dycing and carding, the abuse of the Violl, with other instruments.
At the end of sondry of these, he laughed exceedingly, diuerse times clapping his hands on his thighes for ioy: percase to shaddow out the delight, that both himselfe, and sinners take in their sinnes.
And at the ende of some of them, as killing and stealing, hee shewed howe hee brought them to the Gallowes, making a signe thereof.
It is not vnlikely but that M. Darrell, hath made bold with his oath, in that hee denyeth to haue made then any interpretation of Somers gestures, seeing that he doth not refraine in these words last mentioned, after a sort to interprete some of them.
Besides, it is not likely that the womens expositions would haue carried such credite, except M. Darrell himselfe had beene an Actor in them.
For within a Sonday or two after, they were of that account, as they were thought worthy to bee read publikely in the Church, as it is deposed by Mistresse Gray, and Edmond Garland in these wordes.
The next or the second sonday after, M. Aldrige did repeate in the Church publikely the said signes acted by Somers, with their interpretations before made of them, affirming that forasmuch as they in Nottingham, notwithstanding the admonitions of many godly Preachers, did still continue in their sinnes: God had sent the Deuill to reproue them, and to make them ashamed of their former obstinacie.
Vppon this authenticall reading of the said (more then sottish) fooleries, out commeth a ballade, wherin is supplied some want in M. Darrels history.
Hee telleth vs that Somers did notablye set out by gestures this sinne, and that sinne: but doth not expresse the manner how.
Herein therefore the Ballader hath shewed his skill, as you may perceiue by some of his rymes.
He played the antike there in skornes, and flowted men in making hornes.
And after that he did bewray, how men at Dyce and Cards do play.
He shewed the manner of our Fardingales, our Buskes, and Periwigges, Masks, and Vales, and by clapping of his handes, hee shewed the starching of our bandes.
Much good matter may further bee found in the saide Ballade, very agreeable to the worthines of that exploite.
And thus wee are come to the end of the first nightes worke, after M. Darrelles comming to Somers at Nottingham.
The next day (being Sonday,) M. Darrell is charged, that comming to Somers towardes that night for that sondrie persons were then with Somers, which had not beene with him the night before,) he vsed the like speeches then in their presence, and in Somers hearing, that hee had done ouernight: vz. that hee the saide Somers was in his fittes senseles: that the Deuill at such times did speake in him: that hee was troubled in such manner and sorte as the boy of Burton, Katherie Wright, and the seauen in Lancashire were vexed, when they were possessed: that hee then also tolde them, what kinde of fittes they had: what were the signes of possession mentioned in the scripture, and how Somers by gestures had shewed the sinnes that raigned in Nottingham, with much more to the effect specifyed.
All these pointes Maister Darrell denyeth to haue beene mentioned by him that night: but the contrary is deposed.
Vpon the Sonday in the afternoone, many resorted to see me, vpon the report of those thinges which had beene done ouernight.
Vnto whome Maister Darrell repeated all that he had saide the night before.
In the beginning of whose speeches, did lye as though had beene asleepe, and thereupon, hee telling them that was possessed saide also, that Katherine Wright, the boye of Burton, and the seauen in Lancashire, were in their fits altogether senseles, and neither heard nor saw any thing, more then if they had beene eyther stockes or stones: and that hee saide was my case.
He tolde them also what manner of fittes the saide parties had, and that was possessed in the very same manner, that they were: also what gestures the deuill had vsed in me, to shew the sinnes that raigned in Nottingham: and in the end he added, that no doubt they should see the deuill worke them again, (meaning the fittes which had acted ouer night), before it were long.
Whereupon, (hauing lyen still all this while, as though had beene a sleepe,) beganne to vse all those trickes, which had done the night before, but with some more readines.
As did counterfeyte any of the saide fittes: euen so saide M. Darrell did such a one, and such a one: it is not the boye, but the deuill that doth them in him These thinges made the people to wonder, seeing me doe euery thing almost in such manner and sorte, as M. Darrell had tolde them before, that the deuill would doe them in me.
M. Darrell affirmed the next day at night, (being sonday) to those that were present, (diuerse being then there, which were not there the saturday at night before,) to the same effect, that he had ouernight, vz. that for a certainety.
William Somers was possessed, that hee knew it by the signes of possession mentioned in the scriptures, that hee was senseles in his fittes, that when he spake or did anie thing in his fittes, it was not he but the deuill that spake and did them.
M. Darrell did vppon the sonday at night declare the signes of possession in William Somers.
On the sonday at night in the presence of many hearers M. Darrell did discourse at large, of the seauen possessed in Lancashire, and of the boy of Burton, concerning the manner of their fittes, and said that Somers had the like.
Vpon the sonday at night, he heard M. Darrell discourse of the seauen possessed in Lancashire, and of the boy of Burton, and said that this boy did, and would vse the like trickes that they did in flearing and laughing, and such like.
When M. Darrell had thus brought the people that were prese~t, into a great admiratio~ of his prete~ded knowledge and experience, of Sathans proceedinges with the possessed, and some of them to incline that Somers was indeed possessed as he affirmed: it was moreouer laide to his charge, that then appointing a fast to be held the next day for the boyes dispossession, and mouing men to refrayne from the company of their wiues that night, for their better preparation against the said fast, he did take vpon him to foretell many thinges that would happen that day: as that they should see verie strange thinges: that Sathan would wonderfully torment the boy, and that hee doubted not, but that they should perceiue by the signes of possession and dispossession, that the boy was possessed, and that then he should be deliuered from Sathan.
M. Darrell denieth all the premises, sauing, his appointing of a fast, and mouing of men to refraine from their wiues.
M. Darrell told them that were present, what signes and tokens were shewed at the dispossessing of certaine in the scriptures.
He also then said that the Deuill would shew strange fittes in me, at the time of the fast, whereby they might certainely know that was possessed, and that they should further perceiue by sure and certaine tokens that should be dispossessed at that time, if it stoode with Gods glorie to haue it so.
VVhich thing thus declared by M. Darrell, made the people verie willing (as perceiued), to heare of the said fast.
Maister Darrell tolde them, that the next day there should be a faste: that then they should see, that God woulde worke great wonders if it stoode with his glorie: that then they shoulde perceiue by the signes of possession, that William Somers was indeede possessed with a wicked spirite, and that if it stoode with Gods glory to haue him dispossessed the next day, they should then perceiue that he was dispossessed, by the signes likewise in the scriptures of dispossession.
M. Darrell said before the fast, that they should see the boy do strange things, and then named al the signs of the possessed in the scriptures.
M. Maior seeming to wonder at diuerse strange fits, which Somers had on the sonday at night, M. Darrell said, that he had seen others in the like fits, and that he made no doubt, but that if they might meet together, and ioyne in prayer, they should see him dispossessed, except it were more for Gods glorie to haue it otherwise.
M. Darrell did then and there say thus: you see strange thinges: but you shall see more strange thinges done by this boye hereafter before his dispossession, if it please God.
agreed to M. Darrels motion, to bee one of the Preachers the next day, vpon the comfort of M. Darrell: who affirmed that without doubt they should see great good come of it.
M. Darrell did tell me before the fast, that out of doubt shall see the Deuill deale strangely with the boye, and recited many particulars thereof, which remember not.
And further making some doubt of the euent, and successe of the said exercise: the said Darrell told me, that he made no doubt, but that the saide exercise would worke to good effect, in helping of the said boy: and to that end he did perswade the hearers then present openly to belieue the same.
M. Darrell said (at that time) that out of doubt we should see the Deuill strangely deale with the boy, that wee should see before to morrow at night, (if it stood with Gods glorie) that the deuill should be cast out.
Maister Darrell at the time did pronounce to all the people then presnt, that they should see the Boye doe many strange thinges and named them.
That when the euill spirite went from him, hee woulde rent and teare him, and leaue him for dead.
M. Darrell affirmed, that the next day, they should see Sathan wonderfullie, torment the saide Somers, and perceiue in him the verie true signes of possession, and that also if it stoode with Gods glorie, the deliuerance of the saide Somers, shoulde be made manifest by the true tokens of dispossession.
When the day of the faste came, M. Darrel is charged to haue affirmed in his Sermon, that they should euidentlie perceiue by the signes of possession, that Somers was possessed, and by the signes of dispossession, that Somers should be dispossessed, if God would: and that afterwards comming to entreate of the particular signes of possession, and so of dispossession, he vsed such pawses, as that the boye had leysure to acte them in order as hee named them.
Whilest the first sermon was in preaching (for there were two,) did lye still for the most part vpon a bed, sauing, that now and then, did struggle a little, some being appointed to holde mee.
But when M. Darrell beganne, then fell to prepare my selfe, according to my instructions.
After hee had proceeded a little way in his Sermon, hee did signifie vnto his hearers, that they shoulde see at that time straunge fittes wrought by the Deuill in my person: whereby it woulde most plainely appeare that was possessed.
Not long after, Maister Darrell read or saide out of Saint Marke: Hee teared sore, and then pulled open my doublette, and snatched at the cloathes with my handes.
After he reade or saide, and he foameth, and then (being readily prepared) did foame at the mouth.
At Maister Darrell named wallowing, did tumble and wallowe on the bed, Diuerse other kindes of fittes M. Darrell at that time did make mention of which then did act seuerally, as M. Darrel made mention of them.
After a long time, which M. Darrel and did spend in shewing of these fits (to the great astonishment of those that were present): then hee drew neere to the time, wherein he pretended that should be dispossessed.
Hee told his hearers, that as they had seene mee before troubled by the Deuill with so many fits, and had perceiued me thereby to be possessed: so now (if it stood with the glory of God) they should see me publikely deliuered, by those signes which the possessed in the scriptures did shew in the time of their deliuerance.
When he came to the mentioning of the said signes, applyed my selfe to imitate them accordingly.
As he named the first signe, vz. the spirit cried: then presently cried.
As hee named the second, vz. that the spirit would rent him sore: then did as before is mentioned.
And at his mentioning of the third, vz. he was as one dead: then did presently lie a pretie while, as though had beene dead.
Whereupon there was presently a great noise in the hall, by reason of the people voyces, being greatly moued to see me so dispossessed, as they thought.
It falleth out in this point, that M. Darrell himselfe doth not much disagree from Somers.
Prosecuting my matter (saith he) as my text gaue me occasion, made mention of fourteene seueral signes of a man possessed, partly out of my text, and partly out of other places of scripture: which did, thereby to perswade my auditorie, that Somers was possessed.
And as named those signes, and did insist vpon them, the worde and worke of God concurred together.
So as Somers in his fits, or the deuill in him, did then acte sundry of those signes, euen as read and insisted vpon them.
As for example, repeated out of my text (and he foameth) and then presently the boy foamed: of the rest.
And likewise towards the end of my sermon, noted and insisted vpon the three signes of dispossession mentioned in the scriptures, and presently the boy first cried, without any apparance of life at all in him, and so continued almost one quarter of an houre.
Thus farre M. Darrell vpon his oath, but in his history he is more free.
There he saith, that he handled at that time fifteene signes of possession: (but Somers lyeth there for dead onely some halfe quarter of an houre) that hee said thus to his auditorie.
Whensoeuer one hauing an euill spirit, shall bee brought to Iesus to be cured (which is when the meanes sanctified thereunto is vsed) and lying there before him, shalbe handled in that manner as Somers is here: that is, rent sore, crie and lie for dead, then a commandment is gone forth from Christ to the deuill for his departure, and accordingly he is gone forth.
When therefore you shall see these things come to passe, whereof wee are told before hand, then let vs know, and be certainely assured, that the deuill is as truely gone out of this boy, as wee are now assured that he is in him.
This last clause is the truest part of his deposition.
The one was as sure as the other: both of them being very cosening prankes.
They brake forth (saith M. Darrell confusedly, and all as one man, when they saw Somers lie for dead, into lowde cries vnto the Lord, in his behalfe, as men astonished.
Cooper saith thus: whe~ the people that were present saw and heard these things, they cried out most vehemently in the doing of them: Lord haue mercy vpo~ vs: Lord haue mercy vpon vs: so did M. Darrell with his hands lift vp as high as he could.
The feare astonishment then was exceeding great, there being none present (as thinke) but that they quaked trembled, wept most bitterly.
Two of the company saith M. Darrel) there being present some
euen so it fell out with the inhabitants of Nottingham after this worke.
For many were stricken with feare, some came vnto me, confessing the same, and crauing mine aduice.
And presently after had publikely vsed some words of exhortation vnto them (which was a weeke after the said worke) they made choice of mee for their preacher: and not onely so, but flocked to the house of God, made hast, and were swift to heare the word.
And so the worde of God grew mightily in Nottingham, and preuailed.
How such impostors haue from time to time inueigled the people by such false sleights, it were not much to fill a whole volume.
The popish crew of Monkes, Iesuites Friers could neuer haue gotten so much wealth reputation, nor haue possessed the peoples minds with so great an opinion of them, nor haue beene able to haue drawne them to so great superstition and palpable errours, but by these and such like counterfeit miracles knaueries.
And thus you haue the worthie acts of M. Darrell, from the saturday at euening, vntill the Monday at night next following.
Of M. Darrels cunning instructing of Somers, by speaking to others in his hearing of Sathans seeking to repossesse him, of the acting of certaine trickes vnder a couerlet, from the seuenth of Nouember, vntill about the xxi. of the same.
THe Scope of this Chapter is set downe in the beginning of the former, proceedeth with M. Darrels course, from the time of his pretended dispossessing of Somers, vntill his supposed repossession, vz. for the space of aboue a moneth which was caried on so cunningly, as it was sufficient to instruct Somers what he had to do, although they had neuer beene acquainted at Ashbie, nor M. Darrell priuately instructed him at Nottingham.
Whereas it is agreed vpon, amongst the chiefest of those writers, (who take vpon them great skill concerning the casting out of deuils); that Sathan doth seldome returne to seeke the repossession of those out of whom hee is cast, as it further appeareth in the first booke: yet M. Darrell is charged, that he had no sooner made an end of his sermon on the day of the fast, but that hee laide an other ground for a new cosenage, by affirming to his Auditorie, and in the hearing of Somers, that for a certainetie, Sathan would seeke to repossesse the said Somers, and preuaile against him, except he were mightily withstood by faith.
Mayster Darrell denieth that he vsed then any such words to his auditorie, or to that effect.
At the end of the Sermon, M. Darrel said (as remember) that very certainely the deuill would come againe, and enter into me, except very great care were taken to preuent him by prayer.
At Smalles house vpon Monday, (where the fast was kept, and before M. Darrell and other preachers brought Somers backe to his maisters) M. Darrel said to the boy after the supposed dispossession, that the deuill would be busier with him, then with any other: and that therefore it stood him vpon, to be carefull of himselfe.
And when the boy was dispossessed, M. Darrel said: that now the boy was cleansed, the deuill would returne to him againe, and bee worse with him then before, except hee did withstand him by faith.
After M. Darrell had done his sermon, he said in the hearing of the people, that Sathan would assuredly seeke to repossesse him the said Somers,) and that without great resistance by faith, and great care taken, hee would againe preuaile against him.
When the said Somers was dispossessed (as it was pretended) M. Darrell affirmed, that the deuill would seeke againe to repossesse him.
Againe, M. Darrell was charged, that afterwards he affirmed also the same night, in the hearing of Somers, and diuers others: that Sathan returned the same night hee was dispossessed out of certaine in Lancashire, and that so returning, he appeared vnto them in certaine similitudes, as of a Rat, a Catte, a Mouse, &c. and sought to reenter at their mouthes: that he verily thought that Sathan would so deale with William Somers, except by faith hee were preuented: and that according to his the said Darrels cunning instruction, Somers afterwards affirmed vnto him others, that the deuill sought the same night afer his pretended dispossession to reenter at his mouth, in the likenesse of a Ratte.
All this and euery part of it, M. Darrell denieth to haue beene vttered by him that night.
Howbeit in another place, being againe examined, hee saith thus.
At one time Somers affirmed, that Sathan did attempt to enter into him, the same night after he was dispossessed, in the likenes of a Ratte.
William Somers hauing set downe at large as much as is here obiected against M. Darrell (as spoken by M. Darrel vnto him priuately that night) saith: The same things that M. Darrel told to me, he also told that night to some others that were in the house (as farre as remember).
Vpon these instructions the next morning after my pretended dispossession, affirmed (but falsly) to M. Darrell in the presence of diuers, that the deuill sought to haue reentred into me as lay in my bed, in the forme of a Ratte, which would haue gone into my mouth, but that stopped it with my hand.
Then quoth M. Darrel) to those that stood by, knew that some such thing would happen: and further said vnto them, that the deuill would assault mee many other wayes hereafter.
M. Darrell the Monday at night (as remember) affirmed to diuers in the presence of Somers, that sathan returned the same night that he was dispossessed out of certaine in Lancashire vnto them againe.
M. Darrell affirmed that night (the fast being ended) or the next day, or within three dayes, in the presence of Somers and others: that Sathan would out of doubt seeke to repossesse him: alleadging a peece of Scripture to that purpose: that it was his custome so to doe: that he himselfe had seene the experience of it in others, as in Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seuen in Lancashire: that he did vse to appeare in diuers similitudes, as of a Ratte, a Cat, or a mouse, and many other likenesses: that the Deuil so appearing, was vsed to allure them by faire promises, that he might againe reenter: and euen so he said, he verily thought the deuil would deale with William Somers, therefore willed him to stand stedfast in Christ, or otherwise the said wicked spirit would repossesse him, and bring seuen worse with him.
M. Darrell at his house after the dispossession, did pronounce to the boy and the people present, that after Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, the seuen in Lancashire, were dispossessed, the deuill came vnto them againe at diuers times, in diuers likenesses, seeking to enter in againe at their mouthes, in the likenes of a Ratte, a Mouse, a Dogge &c. M. Darrell said after the supposed dispossession, and in the presence of Somers, that after Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seuen in Lancashire were dispossessed, the deuill came to them again the same night, and at diuers other times, in diners likenesses, seeking to enter in againe at their mouthes.
M. Darrell said, that the deuill did come to some of the possessed the same night they were dispossessed, euen as they were set at supper, offering to reenter them againe.
Within a day or two after the pretended dispossession of William Somers, M. Darrell dealt with his maister Thomas Porter, that hee the said Somers might go home to his father in lawes house, Robert Cooper, being a thing which he much desired.
Hereunto his maister did yeeld, so as he went to his said father in lawes (as he saith) about the xi. of Nouember.
And within a weeke after M. Darrell bought out his yeares, vpon this pretence, for that he wished the boy to be of some other calling then a musition, because (quoth hee) in that calling, hee shall bee driuen to sing many filthy songs.
Thus William Somers hauing changed the place of his abode, it seemed that M. Darrell thought it necessarie to prepare that place as he had done the other.
He was therefore charged by her Maiesties said Commissioners, that resorting to Somers, at Robert Coopers house, he affirmed to the said Cooper and diuers others in the hearing of the said Somers (making then no shew of any trouble) to the effect in euerie point, as lastly he was charged: adding diuers other things: as that when the deuill had appeared to some that had beene dispossessed in diuers similitudes, they would sometimes start, and sometimes bidde away with the Cat, that Ratte, that Dogge &c. that Sathan for a certaintie would deale with Somers as hee had dealt with the rest: that hee would allure him by promises, and sometimes draw him by threatninges: that if hee were not well looked into, he would cast himselfe into the fire, or to seeke to breake his owne necke, or by some other meanes to kill himselfe, and that when Somers had put all these thinges in practise, sauing killing himselfe: then said M. Darrell to Cooper; did not tell you that these thinges would come to passe? Touching these pointes of M. Darrels foretelling that Sathan would seeke to reenter into Somers, what would happen in that behalfe, he the said M. Darrell confesseth the substance of them: sauing (that he finding what was collected by his foretelling in Somers hearing, what wold come to passe) his memory would not serue him, to set downe the particular times when he vsed such speeches.
Sometimes (saith M. Darrel haue told William Somers, that assuredly the deuill would returne, and seeke to reenter into him, except by faith and prayer he should preuent him.
haue told William Somers, that Sathan would seeke again to repossesse him, and it may be that did also tell him, how the deuill did seeke to repossesse Thomas Darling.
And hauing had talke with some others, haue told them in what similitude the deuill departed from some of the parties possessed, as they affirmed: as namely, that he went out of one in the likenesse of an Vrchine, and out of another in the likenes of an old man, with a crooked backe: and haue had likewise communication with them, concerning the seeking of spirits to repossesse them.
What M. Darrel hath not here confessed touching that which is in this place layed to his charge, he denieth to be true.
William Somers being brought to my house, M. Darrell told me that for a certainty the deuill would seeke to reenter into him: that the deuill had so dealt with the boy of Burton, with seuen in Lancashire, had repossessed Katherine Wright: that the deuill for a certainty would appeare to Somers in diuers likenesses, would assault him with diuers promises, and many great thinges, and not so preuailing with him, would threaten him with many hurts dangers.
These things M. Darrel told me in the hearing of W. Somers, being then present well.
He also at that time did further admonish me very earnestly, that should not suffer Somers to be alone, and that he might be very carefully looked vnto.
For (saith he) he wil otherwise cast himself into the fire, or seeke to breake his owne necke, by some meanes or other kill himselfe.
And was the rather encouraged to looke well vnto him, because Maister Darrell tolde me, should not loose a penny by him.
Within three or foure dayes after these speeches, Somers beganne to make shew as though he had beene troubled, (as M. Darrell had foretold): hee made mention of a blacke dogge that offered him gold and ginger.
He said that the Deuill would haue stopped his breath: Looke where a mouse comes: now shee goes vnder me.
Hee affirmed that the Deuill offered him a paire of veluet breeches and a Satten doublet: that he saw a rough vgly beast: that the Deuill appeared vnto him with a crowne on his head, and six more comming with him: also like a like a Crane, and like a Snake, like an Angell, like a Toade, like a Newte, like a sette of violles, and Dancers, and that he stoode before him with a cappe on his head, &c.
In all these new kindes of fittes, M. Darrell was seldome absent, and in the beginning of them, he saide vnto me: See, did not tell you, that all these things would happen? And these words of his foretelling of me of Somers trouble, and the other also of the care should haue of him: he vttered vnto me in the hearing of diuerse.
Whereuppon some of them said, that must be carefull for him indeed, least otherwise hee might hange himselfe, as one Richardsons wife did.
Maister Darrel said in the presence of William Somers, that after Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seauen in Lancashire, were dispossessed, the Deuill came vnto them at diuerse times, seeking to reenter into them, in diuerse likenesses, and that he entred into Katherine Wright, in the likenes of bread which she did eate, and was again repossessed.
And that the possessed in Lancashire, the boy of Burton, and Katherine Wright, would oftentimes on the sodaine say, take away that Catte, that Ratte, that mouse, that dogge, and that this boy meaning Somers) would likewise doe so.
haue heared M. Darrell say in the presence of the boy, that Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, and the seauen in Lancashire, would many times say on the sodaine: take away that cat, that ratte, that mouse, that dogge, and after such his reporte of them concluded: so this boy shall doe.
After came to my fathers house, beganne within a while to looke as though had beene afraide: did now and then starte, and make mention of dogges, of cattes, of bulles, of lyons, and saying, when started, when made mention of such thinges, that they seemed to come towardes me.
Afterwardes, beganne to counterfeyte my self to be much more assalted then before.
cryed oftentimes in my fits, pretending that the deuill sought again to reenter into me, in the likenes of a man, a dog, a lyon, a snake, a toade, a newt, &c. that he promised so he might enter into me again, to make me the wisest man that euer was, and likewise to giue me gold, and costly apparrell, as veluet hose, and Satten doblettes.
Also affirmed, that the Deuill threatned me diuerse times to hang mee, and to breake my necke.
And all these thinges did, according to M. Darrels instruction: and as he had tolde both me and others, that the boy of Burton, and the vii. in Lancashire had done before.
After that VVilliam Somers was thus drawne on to the acting of his fittes last mentioned, and that M. Darrell (as he sayeth) had renewed his two olde groundes of his want of sense, and the deuilles working in him, and ceased not to procure euery thing hee did, to bee wondred at: hee the saide Somers deuised new trickes vnder a Couerlette, vppon this occasion.
Lying vppon his bedde with a Couerlette cast ouer him, hee moued by chance he knew not how, some parte of his body, when hee was supposed to be in a fitte, and therefore senseles.
Whereupon hee the saide M. Darrell gaue it out, that it was the deuill, that made that motion vnder the couerlet: which was such an instruction to Somers, as hee ceased not to feede that error: M. Darrell still most constantly affirming, to euery one that came in: how it was the deuill that so moued the cloathes, shewing himselfe vnder them, in the formes of Kitlinges or whelpes.
Likewise, (sayeth Somers) lying in my bed, did sometimes knocke and fillip with my fingers and toes, against the bedde sides and feete: and this also was ascribed by M. Darrell, as to haue beene done by the Deuill.
Hereupon M. Darrell being interrogated, whether he had affirmed that Somers in such his fittes was altogether senseles, and that whatsoeuer hee did or spake, it was not hee but the deuill that did both, considering that then the deuill by his sayinges, was not within Somers, but without him, hee the saide Maister Darrell confesseth: that he affirmed him to bee senseles in the saide fittes, and that it was a wicked spirite without him, that made those motions, and that the Deuill appeared vnder the saide Couerlette in the similitudes of Kitlinges or whelpes, he himselfe hauing seene, and felt them.
Vppon this his answere, it being obiected vnto him, that Somers being troubled, and in case whilest Sathan was without him, as hee had beene in the time of his pretended possession, it should thereby seeme, that hee was asmuch possessed then as before, his refuge for aunswere was this: that those kinde of troubles were not like any of the fittes he had in the time that he was possessed, but were of an other kinde, and different from the same.
Being oft at Somers fathers house during the time of his pretended dispossession, haue found him doing the same fittes, as wallowing, tombling, staring, foaming, and the rest which haue seene him before to doe, being at Porters house, during the time of his supposed possession.
What time it was said, that Sathan was seeking to reenter into Somers, found him at his fathers house acting his fittes, the same, and after the same manner, that had seene him acte them before at Porters, during the time of his pretended possession.
few daies after that had heard that Somers was dispossessed of a Deuill, went to see him at his fathers house: where found him doing all the same fittes in a sort, and after the same manner altogether, that had seene him doe them before, when he was at his maisters house, and saide to be possessed: which perswaded me more stronglie, that he was nothing but a counterfeyt.
In the time, whilest the deuill was saide to seeke to reenter into Somers, he had the like fittes in euerie respect (without any difference that could discerne,) that he had before hee was dispossessed, sauing, for the running in his flesh.
Somers fittes in the time of his pretended possession, and in the time whilest the deuill sought to reenter, were all one, sauing, for his foaming and wallowing, insomuch as tolde M. Darrell that thought he was repossessed: but he answered me, that notwithstanding the fittes were alike, yet the deuill was not in him, but assayling of him.
Concerning the vanitie of the said motions vnder the Couerlette, and M. Darrels foolish conceite of the Deuilles appearance in the likenes of Kitlinges or whelpes: besides, that which Somers himselfe before hath confessed, there are sondrie depositions, which are set downe in a place hereafter more conuenient.
V. Of M. Darrels cunning instructing of Somers, by speaking to others in his hearing such thinges, as he meant he should practise in the detecting of witches: from about the xxi. of Nouember, vntill about the vii. of December.
AFter that Somers had played his pranks by starting and rayling, and making of motions vnder a Couerlette, for the space of about a fortnight: then M. Darrell brought him on to an other matter concerning the detecting of Witches: affirming in the presence of Somers to diuerse, that it was ordinary with those that were lately dispossessed to detect Witches, and that Somers would doe the like.
These thinges M. Darrell denyeth, saying: After William Somers beganne to detect some women for Witches, haue affirmed at some time or other, that Sathan vseth sometimes to discouer by the parties possessed such lewd persons, as he had before stirred vp, and made instrumentes for the possessing of them.
But deny that euer said that Sathan vseth in seeking to repossesse a man to detect any Witches.
And here M. Darrell was very much plunged: for being demanded whether Sathan in seeking to repossesse Somers, did not by him detect certaine Witches, hee aunswereth, that for ought he could perceiue, Sathan did not seeke againe to repossesse Somers, during those daies, wherein he detected certain for Witches.
This answere seeming strange, he was asked how he knew, that Sathan did not for that time seeke to repossesse him.
Whereunto hee said, that he did so coniecture, for that VVilliam Somers did affirme no such matter: adding that hee had noe other knowledge at any time, that Sathan did seeke to repossesse eyther him, or any of the other nine before mentioned: but their owne reportes, and some other outward troubles.
If he had been here further pressed, hee would no doubt haue started from this answere: or otherwise he must builde a monethes worke vppon this bare coniecture.
But this is too farre prosecuted: considering that the point here obiected and denyed by him, as is before expressed, is sufficiently proued by diuerse witnesses.
heard M. Darrel, affirme, that it was ordinary with those that were lately dispossessed to detect witches.
thought that the boy by extraordinarie meanes had knowledge, that they whome he named were Witches: and was therin confirmed by M. Darrels speeches of the detection of witches, by certaine that he affirmed had beene possessed in Lancashire.
One Mrs. Wallys and others did talke in the roome where Somers lay, of such persons as were suspected to be Witches, before he the said Somers did name them.
haue heard M. Darrell say in the presence of the boy, that the possessed in Lancashire, Katherine Wright, and the boye of Burton, would often vse these wordes: See, See, where the witch standeth thus, and thus attired: see where he commeth, beholde him.
And after that reporte of them concluded, so this boy shall doe.
When M. Darrell vnderstoode that Somers had named certaine persons to be Witches, he saide vnto me, that he thought he would come to this.
And then he told me, that they who had been in other places so trobled, did ordinarily detect witches.
And that one M. Throckmortons children, did the like not long since.
As Somers named any to be witches, M. Darrell procured them to be sent for, for that they might be tried by Somers, whether they were witches, yea, or nay.
Wherein M. Darrel is charged with a very notable cosenage.
When he had sent for the first witch to be brought to Somers: hee told in the meane time to those that were in the house, in Somers presence, that it was an ordinary thing, that whe~ witches came nigh to those that were in Somers case, then they (in such case) would scritch and cry out, be greatly troubled, and so at the VVitches departure.
And that they would lye quietly snoring, as if they were a sleepe, when the witches stoode by them: and so he said it would fall out with Somers: which comming to passe accordingly, as Somers hath set downe more particularly in the second Chapter of this booke.
M. Darrell was greatly admired, and the parties so brought vnto him, were thereupon reputed for witches, and by his perswasion, that Somers could not bee quiet, till they were made fast, they were, as Somers detected them, committed to prison.
M. Darrell denyeth, that he eyther foretolde any such matter, or that afterwards he euer affirmed the same to be an ordinary thing, with those that had bin in Somers case.
And he yeeldeth this reason for his saide deniall vz. for that (sayeth he) had neuer seen any so troubled before, (at the comming and going of Witches) but in mine experience: and namely, in Katherine VVright, shee was tormented and troubled onely, during the time, that the Witch was present by her, and remained quiet both at her comming and departure.
And the like haue heard of the seauen in Lancashire.
By which his deposition, it seemeth very improbable, that the pointes wherewith he is here charged should bee true.
For hee had neuer seene any troubled as Somers was, and his experience is to the contrary.
But the Fox was neare driuen when he tooke this muce, and hee ferreted out of it by verie pregnant depositions.
M. Darrell hauing sent for some, who were named by Somers to be Witches, he did affirme in the hearing of this examinat diuerse others then present, that whe~ the said Witches were comming, the boy would be greatly afflicted till they came before him, and then he would lie quietly till they were gone, and afterwardes at their going away, would be greatly molested againe.
And accordingly all thinges happened, as M. Darrell did foretel.
At their comming he was vehemently tormented (as it seemed) when they came to the beds side to him, he would lye as quietly as though he had been asleepe, and would sometimes snore: but when they were going away again, then hee seemed to be tormented as before.
M. Darrell affirmed in the presence of Somers, and diuerse others, that it was an ordinary thing, when Witches came nigh vnto one in Somers case: that then such the partie possessed would scritch and cry out: but when they stood close by him, that then he would lye quietly, snoring as if he were a sleepe: and at their departure away, scritch and cry out again: afterwards he saw Somers so do in all respectes, when diuerse suspected to be Witches were brought vnto them.
haue heard M. Darrell vpon occasion of speech say, that when Witches stoode by one possessed, the partie possessed should be quiet: but at the comming in and going out of the Witches, the saide possesssed party should be much disquieted.
haue heard M. Darrell say, that it was ordinary with those that were in Somers case, when the Witches haue been brought vnto them, to be greatly vexed at their comming, at their departure, and to lye very quietly whilest the same Witches stoode by them.
Being in a fitte, he would amongst other speeches say, fetch mee such a woman.
Now or euer she came to him, he would seeme to be strangely vexed, and more strangely when shee approached neere vnto him.
But when she was with him, he was in quiet as if hee were a sleep: but if she turned her backe, then was hee troubled as before.
And this was their custome (that were his friendes about him) so soone as they had tried any woman detected, straight way she was sent to prison, and so they serued sixe or seuen.
This triall was sufficient: Mother Boote (and so of the rest) is a witch, and therefore with the rest must go to prison.
As Somers did name any for witches, M. Darrel procured them to be fetched out of their houses.
Somers naming some for witches, M. Darrel procured them to be sent for, and bringing them to the boy, did afterwardes go himselfe to see them put in prison: saying, that the boy could not bee in quiet till they were laide fast.
And this course M. Darrell held vpon the boyes words: so as in two daies he procured to be imprisoned sixe to seuen, vnder this pretence, that they were witches.
Afterwardes also vppon the like occasion, hee caused to bee apprehended, and examined, on Millicent Horsley and her sister.
Furthermore M. Darrel was charged, to haue growne to such vanitie at that time, through the admiration had of him, especially by his followers, and some other credulous persons, by reason of the said course which hee and Somers held for the detecting of witches: as that he affirmed, hee doubted not by Somers meanes to detect all the witches in England.
finding William Somers to haue discouered thirteene witches at Nottingham, and afterwards: said in priuate to some friendes of mine, that thought Somers would bee able to discouer any witch, if he came where they were, or they came where he was: But he denieth the rest, which is deposed as followeth.
heard M. Darrell say, that he doubted not by this meanes (vz by Somers detecting of witches) to discouer all the witches in England.
Besides, the folly of that, which M. Darrel himselfe doth here confesse, might easily by himselfe haue beene discerned; but that through the conceite had of him, he grew to be very impudent.
For those whome Somers had named for witches, no man could iustly blame.
M. Darrell saith Robert Cooper) desired the Maior of Nottingham, to make inquirie through the towne, if any person could charge any of the pretended witches.
The Maior did so accordingly: and nothing being laid to diuers of their charges, they were all set at libertie vppon bonds, sauing two.
But this deuise of Darrels concerning the detecting of witches, is almost laide asleepe.
Of all the partes of the tragicall Comedie acted betweene him and Somers, there was no one Scene in it, wherein M. Darrell did with more courage boldnes acte his part, then in this of the discouerie of witches.
He sendeth for them, procureth the~ to be examined, carieth them before Iustices of peace, goeth to see the~ imprisoned, maketh no doubt but that they are witches, and so bestirreth himselfe therein, as many thereby were greatly seduced, and had him in wonderfull estimation.
One of his friends maketh this discouery of witches, to be one of the worthie fruites of that admirable worke of dispossessing of Somers: telling vs, that witches are the Lordes chiefest enemies: that God would not haue them suffred to liue, and that the hiding sauing of these witches is iustly thought to haue beene one of the first and principall causes of slaundering this worke of Somers dispossessing.
The authour of the briefe Narration, making a catalogue of all the worthy actes, that fell out betwixt M. Darrell and Somers, skippeth ouer the detection of witches, being the fruites of a fortnights worke.
M. Darrell himselfe in his Apologie in this matter is altogether silent, being otherwise very plentifull in the rest.
And this which followeth, is supposed to be the cause of such a change.
M. Ireton, (being a man of very good parts, and yet somewhat ouercarried in this cause, being vnacquainted with the proceedings in it, suspecting no euill) is one of the men, of whom M. Darrell and his friendes haue greatly bragged.
And it is true, that his credite wrought some inconuenience, through his facultie in belieuing those things which were told him: albeit his speeches still did relie vppon this supposition, that if those thinges which he heard were true, then thus, and thus.
Besides some indiscreet opposition in points of learning, did make him to say something, whereof more hold was taken, then peraduenture he meant.
This M. Ireton hauing beene examined, and particularly concerning the point in hand of detecting of witches, saith thus: thinke that Somers did counterfeit those fittes, wherein he tooke vpon him to disclose witches, and am perswaded, that he neuer had any skil by sathans meanes, or otherwise so to do.
By this deposition, that deceit of Darrels is so dasht, as it is supposed we shall haue no more of it: and the rather because it may be thought he was very weary of it, being diuers waies greatly plunged in it.
cannot omit (saith he) how Maister Darrell and had like to haue been foyled in this matter.
Widdow Boote suspected for a witch, being to bee brought vnto me, and hauing notice thereof before, did shew my selfe to bee greatly troubled, both at her comming in, and at her going away, as my manner was.
But vpon a cunning tricke vsed by some that were there present, was greatly deceiued.
For after the departure of the said widdow, she was brought and carried backe againe into the chamber, and out, twise or thrice secretly vnder one of their cloakes, that had laid that plot as afterwards perceiued: so that neither Maister Darrell nor hauing vnderstanding thereof, nor any suspition of such kinde of dealing, could not put in practise my former trickes, but was quiet at euery such her going in and comming out.
Whereupon they that vsed this deuise, did presently publish the same, and thereby affirmed, that out of all question was but a dissembler.
Of M. Darrels course, from about the seuenth of December, vntill the
BY this time Somers began to be wearie of counterfeiting, hauing spent a moneth from the time of his pretended dispossession, in starting in playing his gamboiles vnder a couerlet, and in detecting of witches.
And afterwardes for ought that M. Darrell could doe, he altogether refused to continue his dissembling course any longer: and so made no shew of any of his prankes for the space of fiue weekes.
Howbeit, in the meane time M. Darrel for his part was not idle.
For a general opinion being then conceiued, that Somers had counterfeited in al his former proceedings, partly in respect of some more apparant arguments thereof, in his trickes vnder the couerlet, and in his pretended detecting of witches, M. Darrel being greatly netled therwith, flew to the pulpit, and there rang out diuers peales with great bitternesse against that conceite.
And for as much as the opinion of Somers former dissimulation, was the rather confirmed by his continuing well, and refraining from such follies: hee the said M. Darrell bent his chiefe force to perswade his auditorie, that Sathan would lurke sometimes about one (out of whom hee had beene cast) suffring the partie to be well for a good space, but that he was verily perswaded, that Sathan would not giue him ouer, vntill in the end hee had repossessed him.
Also he tooke vppon him to answere some such treatises, as had beene set forth of particular persons, concerning their dissembling in such cases.
With this argument of deuils hee so troubled his auditorie, that they grew very wearie of it, and some blamed him for it to his face.
These particulars M. Darrell doth after a sort confesse some to be true.
preached at Nottingham about that time sixe or seuen sermons, vpon the
of Mathew (concerning sathans returne to reenter) and in one of them said: that if any who were straungers did doubt whether Somers was a counterfeit or no, would bee glad to satisfie them.
But for them of Nottingham said) that scorned to confute them.
which wordes being laid to his charge at that time of his examination, he did thus expound himselfe: scorned to confute them: that is, let me (meaning my selfe) be had in scorne or disdaine, if do confute so palpable an errour, In an other of my sermons, at such times as it was commonly giuen, out that Somers was a counterfeit: did perswade my auditorie to the contrary the best could: affirming confidently, that he was no counterfeit.
And both in my sermons, and at other times haue affirmed, that the deuill would seeke to repossesse Somers.
What he hath not here confessed of the premises, he saith is vntrue.
It seemed that diuers, who affirmed that was a dissembler, were induced so to thinke, because they had heard of some, who hauing done such thinges as did, afterwardes confessed vppon examination, that they had altogether dissembled.
Some of them heard my selfe make mention of a booke that was set out of a certaine maide in London, that had deceiued many by auoiding at her mouth pinnes and needles, and by doing of other verie straunge thinges.
Of this booke M. Darrell made mention in one of his sermons, and did greatly blame those, that because some had dissembled, did therefore affirme, that was but a dissembler.
And in this point he was so earnest, that after many words, for the iustifying of me and my doings, he said, that they should be condemned, who hauing seene the great workes of God in me, did notwithstanding giue it out, that was but a dissembler.
And in most of his sermons he did enter into diuers discourses of the deuils seeking to reenter into those, out of whome he had beene cast: and of bringing with him seuen other wicked spirits worse then himselfe.
In fiue or sixe of his sermons concerning the spirits returne, M. Darrell did greatly reproue those, that would not belieue that Somers had beene possessed: but gaue it out that hee had dissembled: and likewise against those, who did maintaine that he the said Somers was not dispossessed.
He said also, that for a certtaintie Sathan would repossesse Somers, except he did mightily withstand him.
concerning the spirits returne, that this examinate was much moued with it, and told him he did not well therein: affirming, that the people were cloyed with his often repeating of one thing, and much offended, in that as they said, they could heare of nothing in his sermons, but of the Deuill.
But was especially moued with his often repeating of these words: euen so shall it bee with this wicked generation, applying them still to the people of Nottingham, where haue beene a preacher these twentie yeares: the people there being but as other such congregations are, as willing to heare the word of God preached, as any other in mine opinion.
This M. Aldridge was then a great companion of M. Darrels, but not of his cosenage.
Howbeit, when hee thought his freehold touched, he was moued with it.
But what will he say when hee readeth the briefe Narration, wherein the Author writeth thus.
Vpon Somers dispossession M. Darrell was retained preacher in Nottingham, that populous towne, hauing had no setled preacher there before this time, since the beginning of her Maiesties raigne.
Either M. Aldridge or this companion are in daunger of an hard imputation: except it may be thus holpen: M. Aldridge is Vicar of Saint Maries in Nottingham: whereas this fellow peraduenture accounteth neither Parsons, nor Vickars, nor any that beare such popish names, for preachers: the Doctor to be chosen by the parish, as M. Darrell was, is the preacher (forsooth) that must beare the bell.
How Somers about the xiiij. of Ianuarie fel againe to the acting of certaine fits, wherein he continued at times, till about the xxiiij. of Februarie, and how M. Darrell pretended that he was repossessed.
AFter that M. Darrell had spent about a moneth or fiue weekes in preaching, reuiling of those that held Somers for a counterfeit, in dealing priuately with him, (as he saith) to vndertake againe his former dissembled course: hee the said Somers began to stagger, not knowing what was best for him to doe.
For (saith he) by M. Darrels doctrine well perceiued, that many did expect the Deuils assailing me againe, and so looked for my further trouble: whereby, together M. Darrels former perswasitions, was the rather induced to bethinke me of my former dissimulation, as perceiuing the same to tend to the iustifying of all my other actions: With this inducement some others also did concurre.
Whereas my father in law (he saith) had receiued at two collections, made by M. Darrels meanes, the summe of twentie nobles, or thereaboutes, in respect of his trouble and charge, when was in my former pretended fits: and likewise of such as came to see me at those times, diuers gifts in money: For as much as now by my desisting so long from my former practises, felt some want of my former reliefe, perceiued that my father grew very weary of me, vsing my mother very hardly, threatning to driue both me her, my sisters out of his dores, thought with my selfe, that it wold be best for me to enter again into my accustomed dissimulatio~: that so my father receiuing more relief, my mother might be better vsed, and furthermore, in respect of M. Darrels former perswasions, that if would so doe, should neuer want.
Now whilest was thus debating with my self, what shoulde doe: there hapned a very strange matter, which made me to resolue with my selfe, to fall againe to my olde trickes.
One Sterland of Swenton neare Nottingham, hauing been one day in the market at Nottingham, vpon his comming home fell sicke of a bastard plurisie, as the phisitions reported.
Of this sicknes he died, but before in his rauing he said (as his wife and others affirmed) that had troden vpon his heele, when he was last at the said market, and that had certainely bewitched him.
Hereupon his said wife charging me with fellony, before the Maior of Nottingham, was committed to prison, where remained about an howre or two, vntill was bayled by my father in law, and by my vnckle, one Randolph Milner.
When was in prison, then not knowing what issue the said false accusation might haue, and in the respectes before specified, thought it the safest way for my selfe that could take, to return to my old by as again of dissimulation.
Whereupon, whilest was in prison, affirmed that the deuill came vnto me in the likenes of a mouse.
And so about the fourteenth of Ianuarie, beganne to pretend, as though had beene againe vexed, being come home (after was dismissed) to my father in lawes house.
Vpon this William Somers relapse before mentioned, M. Darrell was charged before her maisties saide Commissioners, that although it be accounted (amongst those who take vpon them the chiefest skill in casting out deuils) to be a matter of especiall difficultie to discerne when one is repossessed: yet he vpon the sight of Somers in his first new fitte, did confidently affirme, and afterwardes preach, that for a certainety hee was repossessed, and that the former spirite had brought seauen more with him worse then himselfe: blaming those with great bitternes, who had before affirmed, that the boy was a couterfeyt.
haue saide at diuerse times that Somers was againe repossessed, and that the same spirite that was cast out of him before, was returned againe into him, had brought seauen more with him worse then himsefe.
When these things thus fell out, sayeth Somers) his falling againe to his new fittes, M. Darrell did grow to bee more and more in credite, it being commonly belieued, that was indeed repossessed, as hee in his sermons had foretold, that it was like to come to passe: which opinion M. Darrell did nourish asmuch as he could, and was verie bitter vpon euery occasion against those, who had said before that was but a dissembler.
Whilest Somers was imprisoned, he said that a mouse began to follow him: and comming home to his father in lawes house, he cast himselfe vpon a truckle bed, and so fell presently into a fitte.
Vpon the sight whereof M. Darrell told mee, that for a certainty he was repossessed.
And afterwardes also, so affirmed in some of his sermons in S. Maries publikely, blaming greatly, and also condemning those in Nottingham, who had before affirmed, that Somers was a counterfeyte.
And this hee did with very great earnestnes and vehemencie.
In this place it is to obserued: how some of M. Darrels chiefe friendes haue left him after a sort in two of the chiefest pointes of this whole action.
One of them hauing giuen his opinion, that Somers did not dissemble those fits which he acted before the Commissioners, deputed from the L. Archbishop of Yorke: but that it was the Deuill in him, that played those prankes in his body, could (it seemeth) be content to acknowledge, that he was possessed: but at the time of his examination, he wouls not affirme, that he the saide Somers had beene at any time dispossessed, although (sayeth he) haue heard by depositions and other reports, that might induce me probablely to thinke that hee was dispossessed.
The other being a very rash and one M. Brinsley a Minister: he at the time of his examination, doubteth asmuch of Somers repossession, as the former did of his dispossession.
am fully perswaded (sayeth hee) that William Somers was possessed with an euill spirite, and that he was dispossessed: but concerning his repossession, am not therein so fully perswaded: although haue many reasons to induce me so to thinke.
Vpon M. Darrels reporte and preaching that W. Somers was repossessed, there was then greater resort vnto him then before, M. Darrell still perswading euery one that came (as Somers sayeth) that he the said Somers was repossessed: and that he remayned in al his fittes vtterlie senselesse.
It might greatly be maruayled (by such as haue not experience, how easie a matter it is, with faire pretence to seduce the simpler sort): what estimation and credite M. Darrell gat by this new forgery of Somers pretended repossession.
Howbeit manie of the wiser sort, that were not possessed with the giddie humor of nouelties, (couered forsooth with zeale and sighinges), did laugh this to scorne, as they did the rest: the rather, because the boyes fits after his pretended repossession, when hee was supposed to haue eight deuilles in him, were not so grieuous or strange in shew, as when he had but one: which argued sufficientlie M. Darrels vntruth, in saying he was repossessed.
That they were not then so grieuous and strange, M. Darrell denieth it: but it is deposed.
The most of those thinges that Somers did at Garlandes, (vz. after his supposed repossession), were meere fooleries Somers latter fittes (hauing as he thought gayned sufficient credite in his former), were more loose and not so cunningly handled as the first were.
The fits which Somers had at my house, were not so strange as those were which he had at Porters house, but were more suspitious and likely to be dissembled, then other were, eyther at Porters house, or at Coopers house, after his dispossession.
Somers fits in the time of his repossession were lesse grieuous then the other in euery respect.
And thinke if M. Darrell had not put the boy in mind of his foaming and gnashing in the saide time of his repossession, he would not haue shewed those signes.
How Somers grew werie of this his said relapse, after he continued therein about six weekes, and of his wordes to Iohn Cooper, that he should be quiet if he might get out of M. Darrels fingers, and be at S. Iohns: he himselfe in the former Chapter hath made mention.
So as now we are come to the xxiiii. day of Februarie, mentioned in the beginning of the third Chapter: because thinges being made so cleare, that M. Darrell was a meere dissembler, and a packer and contriuer in all the premisses: there was no great care taken to looke into his practises: during the time of the said six weeks, whilest hee was pretended to bee repossessed.
This Booke containeth William Somers publike confession, that aswell his pretended possession, as his dispossession repossession all hee had done or, pretended, touching the same, was counterfeyted and dissembled, together with the opposition and deuises of M. Darrel and his frends, to discredite impeach the same, from the time that he first came to S. Iohns, by the Maior of Nottinghams direction, vntill his departure thence. vz. from about the xxiiii. of Februarie, vntill Assises at Nottingham, that Lent.
I. How Somers confessed his dissimulation at S. Iohns in Nottingham, as soone as he was out of M. Darrels disposition.
COncerning the occasion of William Somers remouing from his father in lawes house, to S. Iohns in Nottingham, (a place where the poore are set to worke,) Iohn Cooper the keeper there, deposeth thus.
Being oftentimes with William Somers, in his fittes, and diligentlie beholding the course of his carriage in them: grew verie suspitious that he did but dissemble, and thereupon was well content, to haue the tuition of him, to make triall of the matter: the rather, for that the boyes keepers friendes that were about him, were willing to please him in all his humors.
This Cooper, after hee had signifyed to some pages missing] former presumptions.
For Cattes comming to him, he neuer saw any such thing in his life, nor any other vaine supposed apparition.
For shewing the seuerall manner of offences: he heard M. Darrell and others speake of them, and of his owne fantasie, hee deuised to shew them by demonstration.
Falling into the fire, he did voluntarily, being assured, that alwaies some bodie was neere him to catch him vp againe, before he could receiue any hurt.
After that William Somers had made this confession, before the Aldermen the same night (saith Nicholas Shepheard) he being to lie together: at our going to bed, he shewed vnto mee at my request some of his trickes, in the presence of Iohn Cooper, vz. the knocking with his toes, his motions vnder a couerlet, the writhing of his mouth, and how he thrust his tongue backwards into his throate, with some others.
About three or foure daies after, Nicholas Shepheard, acquainting one Fraunces Wyron with Somers dissembled course: and he the said Fraunces being thereupon very desirous to see his trickes, the time was appointed.
Somers prepared himselfe: Foure or fiue persons meete together: a couerlet was laid vpon the ground for the purpose, and so the boy goeth to his worke.
And first saith Shepheard) he fell downe as though hee had beene in a swound: then hauing lyen so a little while, he wallowed and tumbled, he foamed at the mouth, hee gnashed with his teeth, he thrust his tongue backwardes towardes his throate, and gaping, those that were present looked into his mouth.
These trickes thus performed, he rose vp, but still pretending to bee in his fit, he leapt and daunced, as he did the first night that.
M. Darrell came to him, and shewed the same gestures, which he then also had vsed, and were interpreted to signifie the sinnes of Nottingham.
Then the company desired him to shew his trickes vnder the couerlet, and hee hauing laid himselfe downe vpon the couerlet that lay on the floore, cast a cloake vppon him, vnder the which he did shew them: they that were present catching at the said thing that moued vnder the said cloake, being his hand, and he diuers waies preuenting them: sometimes by clapping his hand vnder his side, and some times vnder his hamme.
Lastly, we moued him to fall into the fire: whereunto he would in no sort yeeld: but after a while (as we were talking together) he came vnto me told me in mine eare, that if wold stand by the chimny, be readie to catch him, he would on the sodain fall into fire.
Accordingly, (I not acquainting the rest then present with our purpose) stood by the fire: and Somers standing by me, hee did (sodainly running a little backe) fall vpon his buttocks into the fire, and presently plucked him vp.
With this his sodaine fall into the fire, those that were present, were greatly amazed: whereat the boy laughed, and then they demanding of him, why he would not cast himselfe into the fire, when they willed him: he answered, that if hee had so done, it woulde not haue seemed straunge vnto them: whereas falling into it vppon the sodaine, they saw it did amaze them.
And in deed perceiued them to be greatly affrighted therewith, as they then confessed, and doe yet acknowledge.
At that time also they asked him, how he became so heauie as it was reported, and he willed them to come and trie him.
The manner whereof was thus: He standing vpon the floore, did shrinke himselfe downewards, and then, first M. Scot, afterwards Frauncis Wyrom, comming to lift him, and taking hold vpon the vpper part of his body, the boy clapped himselfe close vnto them, and seemed to bee so strong and heauie, as they could not lift him.
But Donnycliffe going vnto him, and by my direction taking him below his girdlestead, he did lift him vp very easily.
And then the rest perceyuing their owne errour, did also lift him vp at their pleasure, and went away fully perswaded, that (as the boy himselfe had confessed) he had in deed dissembled in all the course by him formerly held.
All which hitherto is deposed by Nicholas Shepheard, is likewise affirmed from point to point, in effect by the depositions of foure of them: Henry Scot, Fraunces Wyron, Thomas Donnicliffe, and Iohn Cooper.
How M. Darrel dealt with Somers, for the reuocation of his said confession, that he had dissembled.
WHile&st thus some were desirous to see the boy do his feats, and to be satisfied, concerning the truth of his confession, the manner of his tricks, acted before the said Aldermen of Nottingham: so on the other side, M. Darrell and his pertakers were wonderfully perplexed, how the matter might (as it seemeth) bee bolstered out and salued: wherein, how Maister Darrel troubled himselfe, it is not to bee doubted.
For although he neuer had suspected, that Somers would haue detected the secrete plottes betwixt them: yet because hee had taken so much vppon him, and in respect of his pretended experience, had beene so resolute in euery thing, it went to his hart: as well perceyuing, that thereby his credite in casting out of Deuilles woulde bee altogether dashed.
Hee therefore to incounter this detection, hauing heard what Somers had confessed and done before the saide Aldermen, was charged before her Maiesties saide Commissioners, to haue gone vnto him at Saint Iohns, and to haue dealt with him very earnestly, for the reuoking of his said confession: for the iustifying of his former proceedings, in sticking vnto it, that he was no counterfeite.
This M. Darrell doth in effect confesse, in these wordes.
Once went to William Somers, to S. Iohns, after that vnderstood that he had confessed, how in all his former dealings he had dissembled, and laboured to make him reuoke his said confession, that he had dissembled, and to affirme the contrarie.
Furthermore, M. Darrell being charged, that hee was so moued with William Somers at S. Iohns, when he affirmed constantly to his face, that all hee had done before was dissembled: as that he pronounced him to bee in a desperate case, and in the state of damnation: answered thus: did at that time vse diuers sharpe words vnto Somers, vpon the occasion mentioned, but did not vse the words of damnation, or desperatio~, or any words to that effect.
Somers, hauing affirmed to M. Darrell at S. Iohns, that he had dissembled, he the said M. Darrell told him, that he was now in worse case then euer he was.
For now he was possessed with legions of Deuils, and that if he continued thus, hee was in state of damnation, and could not be saued.
Maister Darrell, vpon Somers saying vnto him, that he dissembled, grew impatient, and threatned him, that he was in state of damnation.
M. Darrell, vpon the boyes affirmation of his dissembling, said, thou art a lying boy, and wert possessed, dispossessed, and art now repossessed with many Deuilles: and art in a desperate case.
Which thinking to be vncharitably spoken, perswaded M. Darrell to forbeare such speeches, and to comfort the boy by some good meanes.
Againe, M. Darrell was charged by her Maiesties said Commissioners, to haue sought so many waies to haue withdrawn Somers from his said confession, haue stuck vnto it, that he was possessed; as the poore boy was driuen to write vnto him, intreating him to let him alone, and to intermeddle no more in that matter, for his owne credit: and that notwithstanding he still persisted, vrging him as before.
M. Darrell, my hartie commendations vnto you: This is to desire you, that you would let me be at quiet.
For whereas you said that was possessed, was not: and for those trickes that did before you came, was through folkes speeches that came to me.
And those which did since, was through you speches others.
For as you said, could not heare, did heare all thinges, that were spoken, and knew all thinges that were done in the house, and all thinges that did were counterfeite: and pray you to let it passe: for the more you meddle in it, the more discredite it will bee for you: and pray God and you, and all the worlde, to forgiue mee.
M. Darrell hereunto answering, saith: confesse that Somers did write vnto mee, to the effect here mentioned: and yet such his letters notwithstanding, did afterwards perswade him, that he should not say that he had dissembled his former fits, but confesse the truth: meaning thereby, that he should confesse that hee was possessed.
When M. Darrell perceiued that Somers, by no priuate meanes that he could vse, would be drawne to follow his humour any longer, but did constantly perseuer in the affirmation of his aforesaid confession: he the said M. Darrel was charged, that then he sought to worke for himself in the pulpit, and that so grossely ignorantly, (but yet very maliciously) and that he presumed to preach: that Somers was not onely repossessed in bodie as before, but now also possessed in soule, which was worse.
confesse, that did both preach in one of my sermons, and afterwardes affirmed so much to diuers, that Somers was not onely repossessed in body as before, but also possessed in soule, which was worse.
And the reason that moued me to say, that Somers was possessed in soule, was this: vz.
Because in saying he had in the whole course of his former fits dissembled, he lyed therein grieuously against his owne conscience, to the dishonor of God, hurt of his Church.
Consider the gentle zeale of benefiting the Church, by his facultie and skill in casting out Deuils.
But wretched is his owne case, if lying should be so dangerous, who hath so oft by the testimonie of so many witnesses, forgotten his oth in this cause.
How M. Darrell deuised two or three shifts, to haue auoided Somers confession, that he had dissembled.
WE haue found by the premises in the former Chapter M. Darrelles care to haue brought Somers whilest he was at S. Iohns from his foresaid confession, by perswasion and preaching.
Now there commeth to bee considered, how, when hee could not preuaile thereby, hee deuised two or three sleights, as well as he could, to couer so bad a matter.
Touching the first, whereof William Somers deposeth thus; When my confession before the said Aldermen was blowen abroad, M. Darrell and such as fauoured him, gaue it out, that it was not I, that had made that confession, but the Deuill, and that my said confession was a sure argument, that was againe repossessed.
Part hereof M. Darrell himselfe confesseth: for the rest, an other witnes doth concurre in effect with Somers.
Somers, being at S. Iohns, telling me and others present, that in the former course of his pretended fits, he had dissembled.
answered, that he lyed in so saying: and haue said at some times, that the said speeches of Somers were a confirmation, that hee was againe repossessed.
M. Darrell asked William Somers, being at Saint Iohns, whether he had said, that hee had dissembled.
haue said, that haue counterfeyted, and so do say now, the Lord forgiue me for it: protest before God, before Iejus Christ, that haue in this action greatly dissembled with God and the world.
Saiest thou so (quoth Darrell? But how shal know that this is thou William Somers, which now speakest vnto me: vnto whom said, that thought that to be a vain friuolous question: for that Somers vsed his tongue throat with other parts of his mouth, in as orderly as naturall an habite at that instant, as any of vs all that were present could do: M. Darrell, could yeeld no other reason to the contrary, but that William Somers might as wel aske of him, whether it were M. Darrell that moued the question.
At the same time M. Darrell, proceeding with the boy asked him some other questions: as if he had dissembled then, whether he could acte those fittes againe.
The boy said hee could: let vs see quoth Darrell.
The boy did diuers of them: whereupon M. Darrell, growing to be in a great chafe, breathed out his second oracle: saying, that it was no meruaile though he could do them, considering that hee had more Deuils in him then before.
Hereof M. Darrell hath not beene examined, because it was one of the interrogatories whereunto hee refused to answere.
For true it is, that after that he had beene examined diuers times about this matter, he found himselfe so perplexed, as that he refused to be any further examined: saying, that his conscience was troubled, in that he had aunswered so much alreadie.
For although a lyer must haue a good memorie, yet by many crosse questions, he may be taken short, as it hath happened to him in many particulars.
But to follow the purpose, thus M. Shute hath deposed.
How couldst thou foame so vehemently? send forth such loud fearfull cries? draw extort thy mouth to thy eares? frame thine eies so wide broad? so gastly to behold? &c.
To whom Somers answered: did nothing at the time and day of dispossession, but can performe it, as absolutely now.
Whereuppon Somers foamed immediately, after hee had a little prepared himselfe thereunto, that the foame ranne downe on both the sides of his month, and about his chinne.
After that, he sounded forth very lowde and fearefull cryes, &c. Herewith (as also in respect of some other speeches,) M. Darrell being offended, was readie to depart the house: and being desired to stay, and see the boy performe some other actions, he answered, that he would not stay any longer.
For (quoth he) am perswaded, that hee can doe the like againe, in that he doth them by the same power, whereby hee did them before: but will stand to it till death, that he was possessed, and was dispossessed, and is now repossessed, with many deuils.
When M. Darrell perceyued, that Somers acting of the like fittes voluntarily, that hee had done dissemblingly, it beganne to be held more commonlie, that the boy was a counterfeyte: then thirdly, hee the saide Darrell, and his adherentes, turned their tale, and gaue it out; that his voluntary fittes were but toyes, and nothing like those that hee had when hee was possessed.
The fittes which William Somers did acte, before M. Darrell at S. Iohns voluntarily, did very aptly resemble those that he had, vppon the day of his supposed dispossession.
In the presence of M. Scot, and others, William Somers, did voluntarilie acte his fittes in like sort, and as strangelie to the sight of them, that had seene him doe them before, but especially, to one that was a stranger, they seemed to bee done very extraordinarily, as when it was saide, that hee was possessed.
Howbeit, vpon the acting of them, (though indeede they differed nothing from the former) yet saide to the boy, that they were not so strange, to see what the boy would say vnto me.
To whome the saide boy answered, that now knew them to be done voluntarilie, they might seeme not so strange: but if had not known them to haue been counterfeyted, they would then haue seemed as strange as before.
hauing beene present at Porters house, and at many of W. Somers fittes, in the time of his pretended possession: these fittes, meaning the voluntary fittes, which Somers had acted before him,
more at S. Iohns) were as strange for the manner of them, as those that had seene him doe in the time of his supposed possession, and the very same for the kindes and qualities, and continuance of them, as those were in euery respect.
And besides the casting of himselfe into the fire, being soda ine vnlooked for of me (the boy hauing a little afore denyed earnestly to acte that fitte by name) did affright and skarre me much, vntill Shephearde told me, that it was done vppon compacte betweene Somers and him.
With this deposition of Fraunces VVyron, agreeth the deposition of Thomas Donnycliffe, Henry Scot, and Nicholas Shepheard.
How M. Darrell and his friends to discredite Somers confession, did falsly reporte, that he was induced thereunto by promises, threatnings, and inchantments.
THe three sleightes mentioned in the former Chapter, albeit they were of some force to content those, who were desirous to take any thing for paiment, yet were they not thought sufficient, without some further stre~gthning: whereupon (as it seemeth) sondry factions and slaunderous deuises, were cast abroad by M. Darrel and his friends, to discredite the boy, and all that the he had confessed, by surmising, and thereupon constantlie affirming, that Somers had beene induced there to speake against the truth, by indirect and vnlawfull meanes.
Somers being at S. Iohns, there was a rumor cast about the towne one euening, that the Deuill had carried him thence, and in his departure with him, had dashed out his braines against a wall.
This was of likelyhoode a simple deuise of M. Darrels grossest friendes: but yet such as it was, it wrought for the time.
One euening, whilest Somers was at S. Iohns, two Shoemakers, vz. one Randall Triuette, and one Phillippes, hauing heard (as they sayde) that the Deuill carrying him away, had dashed out his braynes against a post, came running in great haste to know if it were true.
hearing of Iohn Bate of a reporte, that the Deuill had taken away William Somers, and dashed his braynes against a poste, went downe to S. Iohns, to see whether it were so or no.
Amongst many wayes whereby men are corrupted, induced to speake falsly, allurements by fayre promises, haue not the least force: which being very, well knowne to M. Darrell and his good friends, they thought it might carry some good probabilities, and serue for a shift, to giue it out: that Somers was so wrought and drawne on to affirme, that hee had dissembled.
But how vntrulie they haue charged him herein, the depositions following will declare.
William Somers deposeth, that hee was not induced by any promises so to confesse, but that he did it willingly, as being wearie of his former dissimulation, and thinking (sayeth he) that could not vse these wicked vices, that vsed bofore, but it would be spied, God put it into my minde to reueale the truth.
Onely he addeth this, sauing, that when the Alderman, and M. Gregory came first to examine him, he desiring that he might be pardoned for his former follyes, and then affirming that hee would reueale all vnto them: they, the said Aldermen and M. Gregory, promised to be a meanes for him to the towne in that behalfe.
The men, who were chiefly suspected to haue dealt with Somers (as here it is supposed) were Iohn Cooper, and Nicholas Shepheard,: whome M. Darrell procured to bee examined at Nottingham, by his owne Commissioners, touching that pointe: and thereunto they haue sworne as followeth.
neuer knew of any promises made to the boy, to confesse that hee had counterfeyted: but remember that M. Iackson promised, that if hee would declare the truth, hee would be good vnto him, and helpe him to a seruice in London: And Iohn Cooper thus: doe not know anie that perswaded Somers to confesse himselfe to be dissembler.
Richard Hunt, Anchor Iackson, and William Freeman, Aldermen of Nottingham, William Gregory do affirme, that repayring to William Somers, at S. Iohns, he made this suite vnto them, vz. that they would be a meanes to procure the townes fauour towardes himÂ· so that hee might not be punished for any of his follyes past, and that he might bee sent to London, out of that Country, to auoyd disgrace: and then he sayde hee would disclose the secretes of his supposed possession.
Whereupon they promising him, that if they found him to deale trulie, they would be a meanes for him, as he desired, hee shewed them all his trickes, together with the seuerall wayes, how hee did acte them: as it is before set downe in the first Chapter.
Againe, that which saide of the force of promises, what they are able to worke, may also be verifyed of threatninges: and therefore considering that (as they say,) euerie thing eeketh.
M. Darrell and his adherentes haue laboured to impeach the aforesaid confession of Somers, by giuing it out, that he was moued thereunto by terror, and threatninges.
But vpon what slender groundes they haue so done: it will partlie appeare by the deposition of those, whome M. Darrell himselfe procured to bee examined at Nottingham: and by the Testimonies also of others.
Iohn Couper sayeth, that Somers, (after his comming to S. Iohns did pretend himselfe, thrice within a day or two to haue certaine fittes.
Whereupon the saide Couper, putting at one time sondrie wiues out of the house, (at whose comming he the saide Somers, did fall into one of the saide fittes,) and then giuing him some wordes of correction; vz. threatning to whip him, he the saide Somers presentlie rose vp.
Also Nicholas Shepheard confesseth, that in one of the boyes fittes at S. Iohns, hee threatned to haue a paire of pincers to pinch him by the toes, if hee vsed those trickes: and in an other place also (as it is before specifyed,) he sayeth, that vpon his saide threatning wordes, Somers being acting certain trickes, hee the saide Somers gaue them ouer, and neuer vsed them afterwardes, whilest hee was at S. Iohns.
By neyther of these depositions it can be collected, that they threatned the boy, to say he had dissembled, or that thereby he was induced so to affirm.
But by M. Darrels owne rule, in that Somers being in a fitte, heard their saide threatning speeches, and rising vp, had no more fittes, whilest hee was in that place, it seemeth to be apparant that he was a dissembler.
The saide M. Hurt, M. Iackson, M. Freeman, and Gregorie, doe further also testifie, that after William Somers had shewed vnto them his fittes, with the manner of the doing of the~, he did acknowledge that all he had formerlie done, when he was supposed that he was possessed, was dissembled, and done by himself voluntarily, without the assistance of any Diuell or spirite: which he knew to be so, for that he was (as he saide) in good and perfect memory, at the doing of euery thing: and constantly affirmed, that whatsoeuer hee had then confessed vnto them, hee had done it of his owne free will, without compulsion anie wayes.
Moreouer, for a surcharge vnto the saide promises and threatninges, it was also giuen out by M. Darrell, or his adherents, that the said Somers, whilest he was at S. Iohns, was compelled through sorcery and charmes, vsed by one Nicholas Aire or some others, to say that hee had dissembled: insomuch that (as it seemeth) some were examined by M. Darrels means at Nottingham, vpon that point.
But nothing was proued, the conceite proceeding from a shifting and detracting humor.
William Somers, when hee heard of this reporte, writte therof thus.
Be it knowne vnto all men, &c. that did confesse my counterfeyting voluntarily, without any witchcraft, sorcery, oyntementes, papistry, or comurations, or any other vnlawfull meanes.
Iohn Cooper deposed sayeth, that hee neuer knew one Nicholas Aire to haue accesse to the boy, whilest he was at S. Iohns, to his knowledge.
Of all likelyhood, this Ayre was suspected by M. Darrell, to be eyther a Witch or a Coniurer: and then if he were with the boy at all, it was sufficient for M. Darrell to worke vpon, and to enforce the saide effect of sorcery.
One M. Gregory finding by Somers wordes, that his legges were so ore, that hee could not acte his trickes, hee the saide M. Gregory gaue direction to the boyes keepers, that they should annoint them with some oyle, whereby hee might be the more nimble to shew them.
Now forsooth, this oyle was eyther charmed, or when the boye was annointed, some charmes were vsed: and so he saide that he had counterfeyted.
William Somers answered, that his legges were so sore, he could not shew his trickes, and then M. Gregory commaunded, that some ointment might he giuen him: which did, and the boye annointed his knees.
And Iohn Cooper: It is true that there was an ointment brought to Somers, by Nicholas Shepheard, appointed thereunto by M. Gregory, with the which Somers was annointed, because hee might bee more nimble to shew his trickes: But wordes of charme, heard not at the annointing of him But hereof to much: because M. Darrell (as it seemeth) being ashamed of this ridiculous slaunder, hath in his Apologie, where he hath set downe the rest, omitted this.
V. Of M. Darrels ridiculous pretence, that Somers was induced by the Deuill in forme of a blacke dogge, and an Asse, to say hee had dissembled. East there might be any defect ascribed vnto the said promises, or threatninges, or sorcery, or charms mentioned in the former chapter, as being insufficient to draw Somers vnto his saide confession, the deuill is brought in by M. Darrell and his friendes, as a chiefe Actor to that effect: who appearing vnto him forsooth, first in the likenes of a blacke dogge, and then of an Asse, perswaded him to affirme, that he had dissembled.
William Somers hauing affirmed before the Commissioners deputed from Yorke, that he had not dissembled, was asked, why he had then said before, that hee had dissembled.
To whome (as the tale goeth) he made this answere: the blacke dogge with abagge of golde: and being able to goe no further, fell downe into an other fitte.
It had been well, if hee had made an end of his answere, before hee so fell, that so the sense might haue beene perfect.
For one George Small deposed, hath made it vppe: Who reporting his saide answere, deliuereth it thus.
The boye offered twise or thrice to haue answered, before hee coulde answere, his winde seeming to bee stopt: but at the last sayde, that hee had seene a blacke Dogge, which blacke Dogge, had induced him to say, that hee had dissembled.
The rest that were present, could heare nothing (it seemeth,) but his said abrupt speech, vz, the blacke dogge with the bag of golde: but this fellow was of a quicker eare.
It had beene a thing of course with him, (as hee sayeth) in those his pretended fits, when Sathan was said to seeke to repossesse him, to name a blacke Dog amongst other similitudes, (wherin M. Darrell had affirmed, the deuill was accustomed to seek the repossessio~ of those, out of whom he had been cast,) which blacke dogge he fayned then to haue allured him with golde and faire promises, that hee might again reenter.
The remembrance of which his former instruction and practise, caused him to name the said blacke dogge with a bag of golde.
Now for that hee had left his saide speech imperfect, and also vpon some other occasions, he the saide Somers being sent by the said commissioners, to one Edmond Garlandes house: he the saide Garland demanded of him, why he had affirmed whilst he was at S. Iohns, that he had dissembled: seeing that hee had now affirmed the contrarie before the said Commissioners.
Whereunto Somers answering (as he saith) in his knauerie, told him: that being at S. Iohns, a thing did appeare vnto him, in the likenes of a blacke Dogge, and then of an Asse, which perswaded him, partly by promises, and partly by threatnings, to say that he had dissembled, and that if hee would yeeld therein, he should doe any thing that he would.
This tale of Somers was no sooner vnderstood, but it was giuen forth, that whereas there was a blacke Dogge by hap in the chamber, whilest Somers was acting his trickes before the saide Commissioners: the said blacke dogge was out of question the Deuill, that had willed the boy to say he had dissembled, the dogge belonging in deede to a Spurrier in Nottingham.
Of this idle conceit M. Brinsley had beene a chiefe spreader, relying (as he saith) vpon the reportes of M. Ireton, and M. Leigh.
Touching M. Leigh hee reporteth that he the said M. Leigh, seeing the Dogge at the chamber dore, did thinke the dogs eyes did gloare like fire.
But M. Ireton, and M. Leigh themselues being deposed, do testifie hereof as followeth.
The blacke Dogge, which was said to be in the place where the Commissioners sate, was a blacke Spaniel, which since M. Hurt hath shewed to me (as verily thinke) in the market place.
speech or conceite was raised (saith M. Ireton know not how, that the said blacke dogge was a Deuill: which thinke to be a meere toy, vnderstanding that it was a Spurriers dogge.
saw a blacke rough Dogge in the Chamber whilest the boy lay in his trickes: which Dogge was one Thomas Clarkes, a Spurriar in Nottingham, and doe thinke in my conscience, that it was the same, that was about William Somers there none other.
Now M. Darrell building his Apologie vpon such lies and fooleries, telleth vs this matter very grauely in this sorte.
Sathan visiblie appearing vnto Somers (as his vsuall manner is to those he possesseth) sometimes promised him golde, and that he would be at hand, to doe those things for him, he had done, howsoeuer he would haue him, if he would say he had counterfeyted: at other times Sathan also threatned to pull him in pieces, if he would not say so.
man would thinke by these confident wordes, that M. Darrell had beene present, and a witnes of the Deuils said speeches: whereas if he bee well pressed, you shall find he hath nothing but the premises to ground vpon: besides his great learning, wherby he affirmeth, like a cosening impostor, what Sathans custome is in such cases.
How M. Darrell hath falsly affirmed, that William Somers was induced to say he had dissembled, for feare of hanging: whereas he falling into his fittes before the Commissioners at Nottingham, (vpon a former compact) the feare of hanging was one of the chiefest causes, that he then affirmed, that hee had not dissembled.
IT should seeme, that M. Darrell hath a good vaine in teaching: that Somers had a strong retentiue facultie in holding of that which hee hath learned, in that hee was so hardly drawne, as it is pretended, to confesse that he had dissembled.
For besides that which hitherto hath beene reported, of the said promises, threatnings, sorcerie, charmings, and the deuill himselfe: there is added a fixt inducement, vz. the feare of hanging: hee being slaundred to haue bewitched one Stirlande to death.
Whereof Maister Darrell telleth vs: that vndoubtedly, if hee had stoode to the truth, and neuer acknowledged any counterfeyting, hee had beene arraigned and sore laide at for his life.
Now the prouerbe is, life is sweete, and who almost will not make a lie for the sauing of it.
Assuredly, this fellow through his acquaintance with Sathan, (as it should seeme) is growne to extraordinarie and presumptuous boldnesse: not shaming to say any thing that may serue his turne.
For the clearing therefore of this vntruth: Somers before hath deposed, that one cause why, about the foureteenth day of Ianuarie
he fell againe to those fittes, (whereupon Maister Darrel) affirmed that he was repossessed) was this, vz.
The feare of such daunger, as hee otherwise might haue fallen into, by reason of the said accusation, concerning his bewitching of Stirland to death.
And this deposition of Somers, is strengthened with that which M. Crauen hath hereof deposed to this purpose, saying: that one of the reasons which moued him to think, that Somers dissembled, was: because that after his release, vz. from acting of such fittes as hee shewed, when the Deuill was pretended to reenter into him, at the time of his detecting of witches, hee neuer had any fitte, for ought hee knew, till he was bound ouer to the Assizes for a witch.
Besides, after that Somers vpon that occasion, and some others, fell to his old trickes, he continued in them about sixe weekes, did not make his dissimulation publikely knowne, for all that time, and till his comming to Saint Iohns.
So as it is apparant, that Somers for feare of hanging, fel again to his former by ace of dissimulation: knowing, that thereby he should be sure to be defended and vpheld by M. Darrell and his friends, so farre forth as they were able themselues, or by any other meanes that they could procure on his behalfe.
It was therefore too much presumption in M. Darrell to tell vs: that he was drawne to say hee had dissembled, for feare of hanging.
But what, if it was the feare of hanging, that caused him not onely to fall to his olde course of dissimulation, (as is before expressed,) but likewise (after hee had confessed for the space of a moneth together, that in all his former courses he had dissembled) to deny the same before M. Darrels Co~missioners, and to affirme for his safetie that hee had not dissembled? Surely, it will so fall out, if you can be content to haue the same by degrees, made manifest vnto you: as first why Somers fel into his fits before the said Commissioners, and then why hauing so begun, he was driuen to affirme, that he had not dissembled.
It being knowne, that was to appeare before the Commissioners, Nicholas Shepheard, and others moued me, that when should come before them, should shew some of my trickes in such manner, and forme as had before done them, and not rise againe, vntill M. Mayor should call me, that thereby (say they) it may plainely appeare to the Commissioners, that whatsoeuer thou hast done before, was done of thine owne accord, and meerly counterfeited.
This counsell being agreeable to M. Mayors desire (as was informed) did willingly yeeld vnto it.
Somers fell into a fit at Nottingham, before the Commissioners from the Lord Archbishop of Yorke, to the thinking of the beholders, that he was repossessed: where in truth, that very fit was determined of, about seuen daies before his comming before them, vz. that he should fall into a fit before them, and lie in the same, vntill M. Mayor should call him: and accordingly M. Mayor was acquainted herewith.
Somers told me, that he would fall into a fit before the Commissioners, and would rise againe at M. Mayors call, but at no mans els.
well remember, that about a weeke before my Lord of Yorks Comission was set on, Iohn Cooper or Nicholas Shepheard came to my house, and told me, that William Somers, when he did appeare before the Commissioners to be examined, he would fall downe into his fits, lie still on the ground, vntill M. Maior (being one of the Commissioners) should bid him arise.
And further the said Cooper, or Shepheard said, that they would acquaint M. Mayor with Somers purpose, that he might call vpon him, and bid him rise, and so satisfie the company of his counterfeyting.
Cooper Shepheard being the boyes keepers at S. Iohns, did acquaint me with a determination, that Somers had to fall into a fit, before vs that were Commissioners, and that should haue called him vp from forth the said fitte: at which call hee would arise, so to satisfie all men, that it was but dissembled.
Of which practise they acquainted me, at the least a weeke before the Commission was set on.
Now for the second point, let Somers proceed: and the rather because that which he saith is otherwise deposed vnto very fully.
Vpon the said agreement, appearing (saith Somers) before the Commissioners, and after some speeches had with me (by some of them) fel downe, plaid diuers of my tricks, as was accustomed to doe in my pretended fits.
There continued tumbling acting my tricks for a long time, still expecting when M. Mayor would calme.
Whilest was thus tumbling, two did pricke mee with pinnes: one in the hande, and an other in the leg: which although felt most sensiblie, yet endured it, because still waited, that M. Mayor should call meÂ· but he forgetting so to do, and being no longer able to continue in that sort, did rise vp of my selfe, as was wont to doe, in the ende of other in my dissembled fits.
When had thus ended these pranks, the Commissioners asked me, whether had beene troubled with any fit, since came into that place before them, or had feet any hurt done vnto mee: and answered no: and after affirmed vpon other speeches, that had not dissembled.
And being here demanded why he so answered, he saith thus.
Whilest was in my pretended fitte, heard many reioycingly say, that now it was most plaine, that was repossessed, and vtter very sharpe words against those, who had giuen it out, that was but a dissembler.
Besides, began to suspect, that either Mayster Maiors opinion ws altered, who was fully perswaded before (as thought) that had altogether dissembled: or els that he durst not speak his mind therin, and call me, seeing the rest of the Commissioners, and many others so confident in deed, that was repossessed.
Furthermore, also then feared, least Maister Markehams, and one Iaques words, with sundry others, would proue true: who the same morning and ouernight had told me, that if were found to be a dissembler, must bee hanged: Whereas (quoth Iaques if it appeare that thou art not a counterfeite, there can no law nor Iudge hurt thee.
In these respects thought it the safest way for my selfe, to yeelde for that time to their humours, and to aunswere as before is expressed, that had not dissembled.
Now, for the better iustification of this which Somers hath deposed: Nicholas Shepheard saith thus.
went to the Maior, and desired him, to bid the boy rise out of his fittes, saying, that therupon the boy would rise.
But Mayster Maior, being (as thinke) terrified, by reason of the hard speeches of the Iustices, giuen out against those that had said the boy was a dissembler, and by the generall clamour and speech of all that were in the place, being addicted to Maister Darrell and his dealinges he the said Maior woulde not call vpon him.
And the then Maior himselfe, must needes confesse, that omitted to call vpon Somers, and thereby the people growe to confirme their opinions, of the truth of his possession, And touching that part of Somers deposition, concerning M. Markeham, and one Iaques threatning words vnto him, they are iustified in this sorte: The euening before William Somers appeared before the Commissioners, Sir Iohn Byron, and M. Robert Markeham (two of the said Commissioners) as they were riding homewardes by S. Iohns, called for the boy: who being brought vnto them by mee, Sir Iohn Byron said vnto him: art thou the boy, that doest thus disquiet the Countrey? And the boy aunswered, yea: Then (quoth Maister Markham if it be proued, that thou art a counterfeit, thou deseruest to bee hanged.
The next morning also, a little before the boy was sent for to come to the Commissioners, one Iaques, a seruant of Maister Iohn Stanhopes (an other of the saide Commissioners) came to William Somers, said vnto him, in the hearing of me, and of Iohn Cooper, that if he were proued a counterfeite, he must be hanged.
Maister Markham said to William Somers, the night before he was to appeare before the Commissioners, that if he were found to be a dissembler, he must bee hanged: whereby perceyued the boy to be much terrifyed, in so much as he fell a weeping.
Also one Iaques tolde the boy in my hearing, the morning before he was sent for to the Commissioners, that if he did counterfeite, he would be hanged: perseuered so a long time in threatning sort vnto the boy: and afterwards added, that if he were in case, as he was before, then he was innocent, and so no law nor Iudge could take holde on him, or condemne him.
Diuerse others, at the least halfe an hundreth the same morning before he went to the said Commissioners, vsed the like wordes of terrour to the boy.
By these depositions, if the humor then regnant in M. Darrels zealous adherents, so much addicted in outward shew to set out the glory of God, doe not somewhat appeare, the peruser of them may out of doubt be deemed partiall.
This was threatning and terrifying in deed, able to haue shaken the constancie of a stronger man peraduenture then Somers was, the time and the persons considered, that dealt so with him.
It had beene good for M. Darrell, if he had omitted in his Apologie this calumniation, seeing that thereby he is fallen himselfe into the same snare, which he had laid for others.
How Somers was perswaded by threatnings, promises, to haue continued his dissimulation, after hee had beene before the Commissioners at Nottingham, vntill M. Darrell might againe dispossesse him.
WIlliam Somers, hauing confessed before the Commissioners at Nottingham, that he did not dissemble, he was sent by their authoritie (vpon the desire of Maister Darrell his friends) to one Garlands house.
Of his being there, and of the course then held with him, he deposeth in this sort.
When came to Garlands house, there was great concourse again vnto me, and diuers perswasions were vsed, that should neuer say againe, that had dissembled.
Also Mistres Aldridge, (as thinke) M. Aldridge himselfe said vnto me, that now it was apparant vnto all the Commissioners, that was repossessed that if euer hereafter shold affirme, that had disse~bled: M. Maior, the rest of the Co~missioners were certainly determined to hang me, that they had a co~mission fro~ the Queene so to doe. Shee therefore with the rest encouraged me to continue in the course that had againe newly begunne, and promised me, that the next fryday after the Iudges were gone (whose comming was not then farre of) there should be an other fast, and that M. Darrell would then dispossesse me againe.
They also saide, that there should be the same day a collection for me, and that then should, being dispossessed, be placed for halfe a yeare with M. Bolton Chaplain to Sir Iohn Byron, afterwards wait vpon one of the saide knightes grand children.
These perswasions added to the reasons that caused Somers to say, he had dissembled before the commissioners, moued him, as he confesseth, to continue his old practises, for the space of about ten dayes: vntill the Maior of Notingham sent for him the~ce by the direction of the Lord chief Iustice of the common Plees.
And then he confessed before the said Maior, (the last day of March,
Richarde Hurt and William Freeman, Iustices of the Peace, the reasons that moued him to tell the Commissioners, that he had not dissembled, and to continue his fittes at Garlandes house, to the effect in euery point, as is before expressed.
Within two or three dayes after, the iudges comming to Nottingham, he the saide Somers, being sent for before the L. Anderson, confessed at large, how he had dissembled: there shewing his tricks before his Lordship, diuers others, in some extraordinarie sorte, to those that had not seene him before: he presentlie started vp, vppon his Lordships bidding of him to arise, and shewed himselfe to bee as well, as he was before.
Since which time (sayeth Somers, haue beene very well, thanke God, notwithstanding, that M. Darrell did then, and hath since diuerse times affirmed, that remaine still repossessed with deuils, and that am likewise possessed in soule.
And trust that God will hereafter giue me grace, from euer consenting againe to any such wicked courses: hoping that God will graunt both M. Darrell and mee true repentance, for our abusing of the world so notoriously, with such, and so manie our vngodly practises.
That William Somers did acte his fittes before the Lord Anderson, and confessed as it is aboue mentioned, to the Maior of Nottingham, and others, after he was taken from Garlandes house, it will not be denyed.
But for the rest, concerning a pretended faste for Somers second dispossession, that M. Darrel maketh altogether strange, as though he had neuer mentioned any such matter: and Mrs. Aldridge quallifyeth her speeches in some parte, aswell as shee can.
Howbeit there are depositions which doe argue, that to be true which Somers hath herein deposed.
heard M. Darrell affirme (sayeth M. Aldridge) that there should be a new fast after the Assizes, for the dispossessing againe of Somers.
When William Somers was first brought vnto my house, heard speeches deliuered vnto him, to this effect, vz. that now he hauing auowed the truth, in saying that he was no dissembler, hee should stand stedfast vnto that truth: that there should within a short time, an other fast be appointed in S. Maries: when God were so pleased, he should be againe dispossessed, and that afterwardes meanes should be made to M. Bolton, that hee might be with him.
Again, heard Mrs. Aldridge say to the boy, when he was at my house, sent the therby the Commissioners, that if he would sticke to the truth, shee made no doubt but to place him with M. Bolton.
And Mrs. Aldridge her selfe: willed the boy to sticke to the truth, not doubting to make meanes by some friendes, to place him in seruice with M. Bolton, Sir Iohn Byrons Chapleaine, there to waite vpon one of Sir Iohns Grandchildren.
M. Aldridge also confesseth, that vpon Somers comming from the Commissioners, or very shortly after: he saide vnto him: that now it was apparant to the Commissioners, and to the Maior himselfe, that he had not before dissembled, and that now if he should hereafter (as before he had done) affirme, that hee had dissembled, hee deserued to bee punished very sharpely.
If the Prouerbe bee true, that a man may see day at a little hole, what may hee then doe at a great breach? If the Assizes had not beene so neare, M. Darrell (it seemeth) would haue quitte his handes of Somers, as being verie weary of that matter.
He was therefore (as it seemeth) very earnest, both by himselfe and his friendes, to haue had the boy continued his dissimulation a little longer: then he might haue bin rid of him with some shew of honesty.
But it would not be: such iugling will out: and not be concealed.
Of the depositions taken in M. Darrells behalfe at Nottingham, and how vpon the reexamination of his own witnesses, it falleth out: that the bodilie actions of Somers in his fitts, were not extraordinary, as they haue beene misreported.
WE are now come to M. Darrels last shifte, wherein both he and his fellowes doe so greatly triumph: which is, the authority of certain depositions, taken before the said Commissioners, on his behalf, at Nottingham.
Somers, who knew his owne doinges best, saide hee had dissembled, and M. Darrell affirmed that he had not dissembled.
The wiser sort belieued Somers, such as had some good experience of the course held betwixt him and Darrell: others (not to be impeached, so much for their want of wisedome, as for their blinding the eye thereof, by their preposterous affections, they helde with M. Darrell.
The issue was, it must be tryed by a Commission, whether Somers said truely, in affirming that he had dissembled.
The Commission was procured, and expedited the xx. of March by these Commissioners, (if the printed Narration saide truely.)
Iohn Thorold Esquier, high Sheriffe, Sir Iohn Byron knight, Iohn Stanhope, Robert Markeham, Richard Perkins Esquiers: Peter Clarke Maior of Nottingham, Miles Leigh Officiall, Iohn Ireton, Iohn Brown, Robert Euington, and Thomas Bolton, Ministers and Preachers: men for their sufficiencie, it is true, very meete to haue dealt in a farre greater matter.
The Gentlemen are very well knowne, to be verie fitte Gouernors, and are a great stay in those parts of the countrie where they dwell.
If the examination of a matter of high treason had beene committed vnto them, or any other of a lower degree, concerning the good and peace of their Countrie, they had beene within the compas of their owne element, and wold no doubt with all sufficiencie haue discharged themselues therein.
But the hypocriticall sleights of false seducers, in matters that concern religion, they are of an other nature, or else it had beene impossible for Poperie to haue so farre preuayled: the chiefe pointes thereof hauing beene vphelde by lyes, and fayned miracles.
The Commissioners that were their ouersight was the greater, because they could not be ignorant, (at the least one or two of them) how the Church hath beene abused from time to time, for aboue these
yeares, by false Impostors, and iugling Exorcists, who for their own glorie, profite, and other preposterous ends, haue taken vpon them to cast out deuils.
Howbeit something also may be saide to extenuate their ouersight, in that none of the Ministers had euer seene Somers before, in any of his fittes, nor were acquainted with such courses as were helde on from time to time, betwixt Darrell the boy.
Besides, they had (as it seemeth) a good opinion of M. Darrell, and could not easily be led to suspect more then they saw.
And for them altogether: who almost being strangers to that cause, would not haue conceyued as they did.
They found M. Darrell readie furnished with many abettors: but no man shewed his face on Somers behalfe.
M. Darrell, (as the Narrator reporteth) had taken the names of threescore persons, who were readie to haue beene deposed, touching the extraordinarie handling of Somers: but no one witnesse was sought out to be deposed for Somers.
Of the said threescore, seauenteen were examined: which might very well haue seemed to haue beene sufficient: considering that the boy did also concurre with them, in saying, that he had not dissembled, as it hath beene before declared.
And concerning also the witnesses themselues, much might be saide for their excuse.
They, hauing conceyued well of M. Darrell, could not easily suspect any treachery in him.
And to say the truth, those grounds presupposed to be true, (which M. Darrell had taught them,) vz. that whatsoeuer he did or spake in his fittes, it was not Somers, but the deuill that did it and spake it: it may rather be maruayled, that they deposed no more, then blamed that they deposed so much.
For who seeing a man lye, in his conceite, as senselesse as a blocke, would not admire the very shaking of his toe: especially being perswaded, that the Deuill made the motion.
But when he should see him leape and friske, moue the calues of his legges, the flesh of his thighes, thrust out his belly, and make sondry strange motions with his iawes, eyes and tounge: it could not bee chosen, but it must seeme terrible.
Adde hereunto the weakenes of mens nature, which is subiect to be terrifyed with Deuilles, and wicked spirites, especially when they suppose the saide spirites to be present, and in action before their eyes.
M. Aldridge being asked, why heretofore he had affirmed, that he perceyued, whilest Somers was acting his trickes, the formes as it were of kitlings, vnder the Couerlette that lay vpon him, the saide Couerlette being betwixt his eyes and them, rather then the forms of whelps, of Connyes, of Rats: &c. answereth, thinke my so affirming, did proceede of this, &c. because had heard before, that certaine Witches had spirites in formes of Kitlinges, and those formes then came to my minde.
And againe, doe very well know, that a mans senses may be deceyued.
Besides, was then very greatly afraide, which is a great meanes to deceiue a mans senses: being a mighty passion, that will procure many imaginations, cause a man to think that which is but little, to be great, that which standeth, to moue, and that to be, which is not.
Wherby confesse (my great feare considered) that might be deceyued, in affirming many things, concerning the particularities of the saide Somers fittes: and verilie thinke it may be true, that Somers affirmeth, of making certaine motions with his fingers vnder the saide Couerlette, and of his knocking against the Beddestocke, whilest was praying by his bedside.
Adde hereunto, that the said witnesses were fully perswaded, that Somers had beene possessed, dispossessed, and was repossessed: and that they conceyued some good effects wrought in Nottingham, by that which they had heard so oft, both in their Pulpittes, and else where, concerning a power left to the Church, to cast out Deuils.
There haue beene many lewde practises of late yeares in England, thrust forward by sondry trayterous Exorcistes, vnder the pretence of casting out Deuilles: numbers of that generation, vpon secret intelligence flocking vnto them.
Whereof, if any enquirie should be made, examinations taken, you may be sure, you should haue most strange thinges deposed by that crue, although all that was done, was feyned and counterfeyted.
To let men therefore in such cases, and being so affected, runne on forwardes with their owne tales, no maruaile if they seeme verie admirable.
But one thing concerning our witnesses in hande, is worthie of consideration: that the most of those that were examined, were but simple persons, and such as had not beene past twise or thrise with the boy, in all the time of his trouble.
Some (hauing threescore ready) would haue produced his chief witnesses first, but peraduenture it was thoght good policy to lay the burthe~ vpo~ the simpler sort.
These pointes thus premised, concerning the expediting of the saide Commission: you are now further to be aduertised, that sondry of the saide witnesses being reexamined by her Maiesties authority, in causes ecclesiasticall, from the L. Archbishop of Canterbury, and others directed: haue greatly qualifyed their former depositions, by diuerse and sundry interpretations of their meaning, and as though some parts of their depositions had beene mistaken.
Inasmuch as now, the bodily actions of Somers in his fits, which were supposed to haue been extraordinary, do appeare to haue been but ordinary, or at the least, such as a knauish expert boy might easily counterfeyte, in such a co~pany as he had about him: and therby also, that which Somers hath deposed of the said supposed extraordinary motions, is in effect fully iustifyed: concerning the extraordinary motions of my body (as they were termed,) many things were reported of me, which neuer did: and those thinges which did indeede, were made much more strange then they were: hauing done nothing in any of my fittes, which an other man by practise may not easily doe, without the Deuils help.
Whereas Thomas Hayes deposeth, before the L. Archbishoppe of Yorkes Commissioners at Nottingham: that he saw some thing runne out of William Somers legges into the other, and thence forthwith into his belly, swelling the same: insomuch that the same was much bowned vpwarde: and when the same departed thence, hee saw it plainely in his throate, in his tounge, and in his cheeke, neare to his eare root, to the quantitie of the yolke of an egge, which he taking betweene his fingers, found the same to bee in softnes like the yoalke of an egge.
saw a swelling in his cheeke, to the quantitie of a yoalke of an egge, and in his throat, of the same quantitie: further then his throate and his face, could not, nor did see it: (William Somers lying in his clothes but saw a stirring runne down his breast, and into his legges, without any rising, or quantity, that could discern, sauing in his belly, the boy at that time lying on his backe, somewhat bended.
This swelling and running of some thing in Somers body, is one of the chiefest supernaturall actions or passions, (for the Apologie it seemeth knew not whether to call them,) that M. Darrell and the Narrator do insiste vpon, for the proofe that Somers was possessed.
But if they were no other, then M. Hayes, vpon his last examination, hath deposed: there was no greate strangenes in them.
It is supposed that M. Darrell will bee very angrie, to haue these supernaturall runninges so extenuated: Hee himselfe hauing labored so much to haue them admired.
But hee must bee content, for it is very agreeable to his former successe, when he would haue made them strange and maruellous.
When the Deuill was said sensiblie to moue within Somers bodie: first in one legge, and then in an other, could perceiue the legge (saith he) to shake and moue, but nothing in the legge, till Maister Darrell catching hold of the boyes thigh, affirmed that he had it vnder his hand, and called mee and M. Aldred to feele it likewise.
But Somers, being vnwilling that we should so doe, turned himselfe violently vpon his bellie, till by force wee drew him backe, and then wee found nothing, but his gloues, or some such things as he had in his pocket.
If M. Darrell doe not here say, that the Deuil skipped out of the boyes thigh into his pocket, and turned himselfe into a paire of gloues: the Deuill may rather bee thought to haue run vp and downe in his owne cosening pate, then in the boyes bodie.
Of these swellings and runnings, Somers, who should know them best, hath thus deposed.
Whereas (saith hee) it hath beene reported, that had diuers swellings, proceeding from my legs to other parts of my body, contrary to all course of humours, or winde: this say, that of mine owne knowledge, in mine owne hearing, very many false reports haue beene made thereof: some affirming, that they saw a thing runne in my body of the bignesse of a mouse, some of a Ratte, some of a mans fist, and that sometimes those who were present, would affirme as much, of one and the same thing at one time, differing in their opinions, concerning that which they said they did then see.
Besides, he likewise setteth downe, how hee did make the said motions that seemed to runne in his bodie, in these words: did moue first the calfe of my legge, then my which motion of the knee, will likewise make a motion or rising in the thigh.
Also by drawing and stopping of my mind, my bellie would stirre and shew a kinde of swelling.
The bunch (as they tearmed it) about my chest, was by the thrusting out of my breast.
Likewise my secret swallowing did make the ende of my windepipe to moue, and to shew greater then vsually it is: Againe, by mouing of my iawes, one bunch was easily made in the side, my cheeke neere mine eare: and about the middle of my cheeke, with the ende of my tongue thrust against it.
These motions by practise woulde make very fast, one after another: so as there might easily seeme to bee running in my bodie of some thing, from place to place: especially when he was thought at those times to be as sencelesse, and for any motions of his owne to lye as a blocke.
Againe, Henry Nussey deposed before the said Commissioners saith: that hee saw William Somers with his mouth wide open, speake certaine wordes to Iohn Wiggen in Latine, which he vnderstood not, his chappes nor teeth mouing, when he did so speake: and that he saw these things euidently, for he came very neere to him to behold him.
Also, Richard Newton deposed then of this point, after this sort saith: found Somers in one of his fittes, and heard him speake plainly with a continued speech, with his mouth wide open, his tongue drawne into his throat: so that there could bee seene nothing of it, but the rootes in his throate, neither lippes nor chappes mouing, and vttered this speech amongst other: Ego sum Rex, ego sum Deus.
And hereupon Maister Darrell telleth vs this tale, relying for the most part of it, vpon one singular witnesse.
Hee spake (saith he) with his mouth wide open: yea his tongue retorted into his throat, and namely these wordes: Ego sum Deus, ego sum Rex: am God, am King.
But let vs see what Nussey, and Newton, being reexamined, do depose of these points: hearde Somers (saith Nussey speake some words, which vnderstood not: but one Iohn Wiggen told me, that Somers said in Latine, am God: But am not able to say, that he spake those wordes, or any other, without the help of his tongue, neither am able to affirme, that his tongue was turned into his throate, at the time that hee spake the said words.
And with this reexamination of Nussey, agreeth the deposition of Iohn Wiggen, in these words.
Somers, in one of his said fits said, Ego sum Deus, ego sum Rex: which wordes (I thinke) he spake with his owne tongue, and with the mouing of his lippes, and neuer meant to bee vnderstoode, that Somers spake, hauing his mouth wide open, and his tongue turned into his throate, nor did euer at any time heare or see any such thing in him.
And touching Richard Newton, he being reexamined saith thus: heard Somers say these wordes: Ego sum Rex, ego sum Deus: and no more words that remember: which wordes, thinke he could haue said at any other time, when hee was well, as hauing beene at Latine schoole.
He spake then after the same manner and fashion, as hee spake them when he was well, with his tongue and lippes, and his owne voyce, sauing that thinke he counterfeyted his voice a little.
had heard say before came, of many extraordinary and straunge things to bee done by Somers, as that hee could speake with his mouth wide open, without his tongue, or without mouing his tongue, which neuer see him doe, nor thinke hee either did or could doe: for to my remembraunce, his lippes did then moue, and his tongue both, when he said the wordes: Ego sum Rex, ego sum Deus.
With these three depositions of Nussey, Wiggen, Newton, as M. Darrels feined wonder is by them detected, so is Somers confession in that behalfe fully ratified.
Concerning (saith he) the report of my extraordinary speaking, with my mouth wide open, my tongue drawne into my throat, neither mouing my lips, iawes or tongue: say, that the most of these reports are vtterly vntrue.
But confesse, that did diuers times chaunge my voice, speaking sometimes hollowly, and sometimes more shrilly: and likewise that haue spoken many wordes, my mouth being open, as any other man may doe, and also when my lippes seemed (in a manner) to bee shutte.
But neuer spake any word, when my tongue was thrust into my throat: onely confesse that when sometimes diuers would looke into my mouth, did often sodainly conuey my tongue backward, as it were, into my throat.
Many are ashamed, belieue, of these their fond reports, and hope, that in time they will vanish.
Furthermore, one Richard Mee did depose before the saide Commissioners, That hee had seene William Somers stand, and turne his face directly backward, not mouing his bodie, and that his eyes were as great as beastes eyes, and that his tongue would be thrust out of his head, to the bignesse of a Calues tongue.
The seuerall partes of this deposition are pretermitted by Maister Darrell, in his Apologie: sauing that of turning his face backwardes, which he doth somewhat alter, terming it, the setting of his face against his backe.
But let vs see what the said Mee hath deposed, vpon his reexamination.
Whereas haue beene conceyued, to say and sweare, as is before expressed, my meaning was, and is (saith hee) that he the said Somers turned his face a good way towards his shoulder, and not otherwise: and likewise my meaning was, and is, that his eyes were somewhat gogling out, but otherwise no more then ordinary.
And thirdly, my meaning was, is, that by reason it was candle light when saw his tongue thrust out, and by reason of my conceite of the strangenesse of Somers troubles, before saw him: his tongue being thrust out, it seemed somewhat bigger, then if Somers had beene well, should haue thought it to haue beene.
Againe, one Ione Pye, being deposed before the said Commissioners, affirmeth, that William Somers in one of his fittes, vpon the Saturday, that Maister Darrell came to Nottingham, vsed these wordes, with his mouth extraordinarily wide, and strangely open, and without mouing or stirring his tongue or lippes, in speaking any of these words: vz.
will vse William Somers tongue members for three dayes: and that in an other fit the same day, she saw his body doubled, his head between his legs.
But being reexamined, she saith thus: heard W. Somers say in the voice, he was wont to speak, his mouth not being wide open, but with his lips mouing as at other times, as then marked and saw, these words.
will vse William Somers tongue for three daies: but saw not his head between his legs, neither at that time, nor at any time after.
Lastly, William Hunt deposed before the said Commissioners: that he heard a voice proceed from William Somers, lying in one of his fits, his lips being close shut, and neither mouing his lips or iawes, to his vnderstanding, and that hee continued so speaking, to the space of a quarter of an houre.
This deposition, though it be but singular, yet M. Darrell hath thrust it into his Aplogie, but with some falshood, saying: that he did speake distinctly, with a continued speech for a quarter of an houre, his mouth being shutte close.
heard a voice proceede from William Somers (saith Hunt): hee spake distinctly with a continued speech (saith Darrell.
Whereas haue been conceiued (saith he) to report and affirme, that William Somers did continue speaking by the space of a quarter of an houre, hauing his lippes close shut, and neither mouing his lippes, nor his iawes: now say, that many times the said Somers would mumble some secrete words alone, not seeme to open his mouth wide: but when hee spake many words together, he opened his mouth, and stirred his lips, as any other man doth.
And when he seemed to mumble any words as is aforesaid, could not well marke, whether he stirred his lips, and opened his mouth, as at other times, by reason the said Somers did so turne and writhe his face, as coulde not well see.
These were the chief points, which seemed most strange in the said depositions, taken at Nottingham: whereupon it was thought good to haue the said witnesses examined.
And how they qualifie their former wordes, you see it apparant: neither is it to be doubted, but that if all other reports, which haue beene made touching Somers fittes, were throughly looked into, and the authors of them discreetly examined, now that the heat of their affections is somewhat cooled, the issue thereof would sort and agree, with the second cogitations of these their fellowes.
In this fourth Booke it will appeare, how M. Darrell made all things strange that Somers did: How loath he was that any man shold make trial, whether he had any sence in his fits: and how he shifted to excuse the boy, when by diuers circumstances it was supposed he dissembled.
Besides, it is herein directly proued, contrary to M. Darrels grounds and assertions: that Somers in his fits had his sences vnderstanding: that the casting of himselfe into the fire: the motions and knocking in his bed: his pretended knowledge: his supposed great strength, and his skill in diuers languages, were no waies extraordinarie: Briefly, that there was no impossibilitie at all in the boyes fits, and that as he was accounted a dissembler, before M. Darrelles comming to Nottingham, so was he still reputed by diuers, all the while that Somers and he were practising together at Nottingham, notwithstanding that M. Darrell could eyther do, say, or preach to the contrary.
I. How Maister Darrell laboured from time to time, to make those thinges that Somers did, (and were but very toyes) to bee thought both strange and extraordinarie.
If a man go to Rome, and be desirous of nouelties, hee shall find sundry Priests that will feed his humor.
They will shew him Christes napkin, S. Inkes head, S. Andrewes arme, S. Blases wezand, a peece of S. Christophers arme, Saint Peters fingers, the pincers wherewith diuers Martirs were pinched, a peece of the earth where Christ appeared to Marie Magdalen, Saint Annes thumbe, Saint Dominckes stoale, a peece of Saint Paules staffe, that hee walked with, Saint Peters tooth, the Table whereat Christ last supped, some of the fragments of the fiue Barly loues mentioned in the Gospell, a peece of the chaine that Saint Iohn was bounde with: Moyses rodde: Aarons rodde, some of the the towell wherewith Christ wiped his Apostles feete: parte of the reede that Christ was strucke with at Pilates house, the ashes of Saint Iohn Baptist, the vessell into the which bloode and water flowed out of Christes side: many cloutes died with the bloud of Martirs: a stone of Christes Sepulcher: a stone or peece of earth of Mount Caluarie: a stone or peece of earth from the place where Christ ascended into heauen: the spunge wherein they gaue Christ Vinegar and gall: the cribbe that Christ was borne in: the thornes of the Crowne that Christ was crowned with: our Ladies hayre: the Chinne of Saint Iohn Baptistes father: some of Mary Magdalens hayre: a peece of the fatte of Saint Laurence: a peece of the arme, and some of the braynes of Saint Thomas of Canterburie, with many such trinkettes.
And they will vow and protest with great deuotion, that these are no fictions, nor feigned reliques: but the very things themselues whose names they beare, whereby many credulous and superstitious people are drawne to admire them.
It is the manner of the Mountebankes in Italie, resembled by some of our Pedlers, when they open their packes, to set out their ware with many great wordes.
Vnto which kinde of people, and seducing Mirabilistes, Maister Darrell in his practises with Somers, may well bee resembled.
When the boy spake, hee tolde the people it was the deuill that vsed his voice: when hee did any thing in his fittes, hee sayde that it was the Deuill that did it.
If hee stirred his handes or any parte of his body as hee lay in bedde, hee affirmed the Deuill to be in bedde with him.
The mouing of the boyes fingers vnder a Couerlette, hee made to bee Deuilles, in formes of Whelpes or Kitlinges: when hee strugled, hee pretended, that for strength hee was almost an other Goliath.
If hee spake any thing, whereof those that were present vnderstoode not the reason how hee knew it: hee was straight become a kinde of Prophete, and to haue supernaturall knowledge.
Two or three wordes of Latine, which hee had learned at the schoole, was sufficient to giue it out, that in his fittes, he spake Greeke, Hebrew, and Latine.
Briefly, all that the boy did in his pretended fittes, M. Darrell would needes haue to passe, and exceede the naturall power of any man: and so must bee done of necessitie by the Deuill.
Whilest hee was thus ietting vppe and downe the place where Somers was playing his prankes, and setting out the boyes actions, as his chiefe Wares, with such strange wordes and qualities, a man may well remember the saide Romish Priestes in extolling their feyned Reliques, and the saide Mountebankes, and Pedlers, in lying and cogging, to make the best of their packes.
The particulers before mentioned, haue beene partly proued already, and it will appeare to bee true more plainely hereafter: and touching some others, there are these depositions following.
M. Darrell tolde those that were present, Somers being in a fitte, that the Boyes tounge was drawne into his throate, quite out of his mouth, and taking the Candle in his handes, would needes haue the company to looke into his mouth, (the boy lying with his mouth open) and then saide: see you not that it is so? what reason can be giuen of this? It passeth nature to doe any such thing: with Cooper herein, concurreth Edmond Garland.
Vpon the Sonday at night, sayeth M. Hallam, M. Darrell saide (the boy lying in his fitte,) beholde his face is it iust behinde him, which is most strange: but saw not the same strangenes.
M. Darrell tolde the people present at Porters house, on the Saturday at night, when he came to Nottingham, that those thinges that the boy did, passed the power and skill of any man to doe.
With this deposition M. Parre doth fully agree in effect, word for worde.
Concerning the ridiculous gestures mentioned before, that were pretended to signifie the sinnes of Nottingham: M. Darrell himselfe hath tolde vs in his history, that Somers did them in that liuely manner, that hee thinketh, that the like dumbe description of sinnes, cannot be made, by any humaine skill or power.
It hath also before beene obserued, how hee willed the boy to vtter some darke speeches, whereby the people might wonder at him: especially, when they heard his the saide Darrels profound exposition of them.
Somers in one of his pretended fittes, did take vpon him, to expound the Articles of the Creede, which (he sayeth) he was in some sorte enabled to doe, by reason that almost euery Minister, that came vnto him, had in their speeches with him, interpreted them diuers times vnto him.
Towardes the end of the which his discourse, M. Darrell came in: who being enformed thereof, and also of some errors, which had escaped therein, he made the matter very wonderfull: first obserue what is deposed, and then what M. Darrell sayeth.
Comming one euening to Coopers house, Somers fell into a fit, (as they called it) of squeaking, and scritching: and in his fiitte he beganne to repeate the Articles of the Creede, and to tel the meaning of euery Article orderly.
The which his exposition, then thought, and doe now thinke, to haue beene made by Somers himselfe, by the assistance of God, and not by the operation of the Deuill.
Somers did expound the Creede at my house, by the space almost of an houre, Whereupon, M. Darrel then saide to those that were present: that heretofore the boy had noted vnto them, the sinnes that raigned in Nottingham, and that now they should heare him deliuer vnto him, the groundes of their faith, euerie Christian dutie, and other godly rules, whereby they might learne to guide their wayes: and therefore willed them to hearken vnto his sayinges, and to practise the same.
Somers (sayeth hee) hauing made a euery glorious interpretation of the Creede, came in, euen as hee made an end: and being informed thereof, and that some of the simple people were so rauished by the saide interpretation, as they supposed it to be done by the Ministery of a good Angell: notwithstanding, some others tolde mee of some errors that had escaped him: answered them, that vndoubtedly, the said glorious interpretation, had beene made by an euill spirite, transforming himselfe into an Angell of light: adding, that thereof they might be assured, by his mingling of some errors amongst many truthes.
And againe, in his Apologie, speaking of Somers supernaturall knowledge forsooth, he writeth thus: From hence it was, that he continued his speach, in expounding the Creede for an houre together.
M. Darrell was not (as you haue heard) at this exposition, and the commendation it had, did proceede from the simple people: and yet here he sayeth, it was made and tearmeth it a very glorious interpretation.
But his reason why hee ascribeth the same vnto an euill spirit is very strange, and peraduenture may touch himself as nearely as Somers.
For if amongst many truthes by him preached, the falling vpon some errors, be an argument, that it was the Deuill that preached in him, the most of his sermons at Nottingham, touching the possession, dispossession, and repossession of Somers, will haply bee censured in Nottingham, to haue proceeded from the Deuill.
But amongst all the rest of Somers actions, which M. Darrell ascribed to the deuill, there is one other that may not be pretermitted: which argueth, that he thought himselfe to haue wonne such credite, as hee might say any thing, were it neuer so absurde, without suspition of falsehoode or iugling.
At some such times, as Somers being in his fittes, called for drinke, M. Darrell would suffer him to haue none, affirming that it was not Somers, but the deuil that called for it.
This M. Darrell denyeth, but it is deposed in sorte, as followeth.
William Somers asking for drinke, (sayeth Edmond Garland) M. Darrell caused it to be denyed him: saying it was not hee, but the Deuill that asked for it.
Robert Cooper thus: heard Thomas Porter say, that the boy being drye and hungry in the morning, before his dispossession, they durst giue him neyther meate, nor drinke, till M. Darrell had beene first acquainted with it.
Againe, Somers being at Porters house in a fitte, he said he was drye, but yet durst not drinke, because M. Darrell had tolde him, that the deuill would make him drye and hungry, and did forbid him therefore, to take any drinke or meate.
Few men but M. Darrell (it is supposed) would haue suspected, when the boy was drie, that the Deuill called for drinke.
But it was his glory to shew his skill and acquaintance with Sathans practises, and still to pretend that the boyes actions were wonderfull.
Many that were present, when they saw Somers doe his trickes, supposing that it had beene the Deuill that did them, were greately afraide.
But M. Darrell was so strong in faith (forsooth) as, seeming greately to disdaine both Sathan and all his doinges, he checked him, commaunded him, and reuyled him at his pleasure: whereby the simpler sorte of people, ascribed great vertue and holines vnto him.
If the resemblances before made of M. Darrels practises in this point, to Pedlers, Mountebanks, and the Reliquemongers of Rome be not so fitte: then as you remember, Somers and Darrell dissembling and colluding together, thinke vpon the pretie feates, betwixt Bankes and his horse.
Indeed it was one of the greatest wonders that hapned in those actions at Nottingham, that so many were seduced by such palpable fooleries.
How M. Darrell would not suffer (as neare as hee could) any to deale with Somers in his fittes, to trie whether he were senseles or dissembled.
IF M. Darrell in his practises with Somers, had beene of a single heart, none should haue beene more carefull then he, to haue searched and tryed out his dissimulation: considering the common opinion after a while, that he was but a counterfyte.
But hee was so farre from that, as he bent himselfe to the contrarie.
For the chief ground that M. Darrell wrought vpon, being the opinion that Somers was senseles in his fittes: when some who suspected him for a dissembler, thought good vpon diuerse occasions to make triall of it, by touching of him, and asking of him many questions: M. Darrell withstoode them, as much as he could, greatly blaming them for so doing, and alledging sondry pretences in that behalfe.
Herewith M. Darrell being charged, hee confesseth parte thereof, but much more is deposed.
Whilest Somers was in sondrie of his fittes, diuerse attempting to trie whether he had any sense, and whether hee had dissembled, and to that purpose, pricking him with pinnes, and offering violence to some parts of his body, did reproue some, and hinder others for so dealing with him: affirming, that though he could not then feele them, he would afterwardes feele the hurt of it, and be sore.
And touching the asking of the boy any questions his shifte to hinder that, was a pretence, that hee helde it vnlawfull so to doe: because in demaunding any thing of him at that time, it was to aske the deuill a question: wherin the Gentleman disagreeeth from all his authors, that write of this arte: who giue many precepts, when, how, and what they must charge Sathan to tell them: as who sent him: for what cause: what Saintes prayer hee feared most: what is his name: what company he hath with him, and such like.
Besides, he also differeth from himselfe: for when he dealt with Katherine Wright, he had one or two pretie Dialogues with the Deuill.
But it was expedient for him in this case, to dislike of that course.
confesse (sayeth he) that charged the spirite to tell his name, which did then in ignorance, being drawne thereunto by reading a little treatise that came to my handes, concerning the dispossessing of one in the South Country.
Furthermore, being charged to haue asked Somers sondry questions in his fittes, when hee was growne a great man in the vnderstanding of these misteries, he answereth thus: neuer asked any one question of Somers, when thought him to bee in a fitte, supposing that if should so haue done, should haue asked questions of the Deuill, which account a thing vnlawfull.
But true it is, that Sathan oftentimes of purpose to deceiue me, would suffer the boy lye quietly when he was in his fitte, whereby it came to passe, that supposing his fitte had beene done, asked him a question, whereunto Sathan hath answered.
Some that stoode by (sayeth VVilliam Somers, endeuoring to make triall, whether was voide of sense or no, did call vpon me: with whome M. Darrell was angrie, saying, that heard no more then a blocke.
Others would haue pinched me, but M. Darrell did prohibite them: affirming that it would make mee sore afterward.
of Nouember, an other asking me a question, forgetting my selfe did answere him: wherewith M. Darrell was discontented, and blamed the partie in so doing, saying, that it was not I, but the Deuill that gaue him that answere.
Somers many times in his fittes, would talke merilie with the and answere any man directly to any question hee would propound: Which thing M. Darrell himself hath ofte reprehended in the people saying, that the Deuill tooke delight in such vaine prattle.
Somers falling to toyes and laughing in his fittes, the fift of Nouember, M. Darrell sayde in the ende to the people, let him alone: for he is so full of knauerie, that there is no dealing with him.
M. Darrell blamed such as asked Somers any questions, saying, it was the Deuill to whome they spake, and who answered them: though the boy did answere aptly and directly, to any questions that were propounded vnto him.
Againe, diuerse wold adiure the boy in his fittes, or the deuill in him, (as it was pretended) to tell them how he came into him, whome M. Darrell would finde fault with, saying, it was the deuill, and not the boye to whome they spake.
haue asked some questions of Somers in his fittes: and M. Darrell hath answered, let him alone, for he neyther heareth, seeth, nor knoweth anie thing, whilest he is in these fittes.
M. Darrell hauing tolde mee that the deuill was in bed with the boy, and an other shewing me where hee was mouing vnder the Couerlette, catched holde of him, (as it was supposed) with my left hand, and would haue pulled the cloathes off with my other hand, saying, in the name of God, whatsoeuer it is, will see it: whereupon M. Darrell helde the cloathes downe, not suffering me to vncouer him, and affirming, that the boye being in his bed, and in his fittes, to vncouer him, was as much as his life was worth.
M. Darrel, talking with the saide Pendleton of the boyes knowledge, by reason of the wicked spirite that was within him, he the sayde Pendleton, affirming that he had lost something by the way as he came to Nottingham, would needes know of the boy, what it was, that hee had lost: nay quoth M. Darrell, he cannot of himselfe answere any questions, but doth speake onely that which the euill spirite doth put in his minde to speake.
This was a pretie euasion vppon the sodaine: but Pendleton was no way satisfyed with it.
M. Darrell knew very well, that the boy was not able to answere him: and therefore he vsed that shifte, whereas if hee had beene indeede perswaded that the deuill had beene in him, he would no doubt haue suffered him to haue beene put to his plunge, in answering the saide question.
Furthermore the saide Pendleton, demaunding of Somers diuerse other questions, and he answering none of them.
What (qouth he) is the boy deafe? No said Maister Darrell) he is not deafe, but he cannot speake of himselfe in his fittes, except the Deuill doe moue him thereunto.
It being obiected to M. Darrell himselfe, that at one time he catching at that which moued in Somers bed, and vnder the couerlet, said he had hold of the wicked spirite: but would not doe so much, as turne vp the clothes to see what he had in hand, that thereby both he himselfe, and others that were present might haue seene their errours: he the said Darrell doth thus answere.
At one time, taking hold of that which seemed to moue vnder the couerlet, (being about a foote from the masse of his bodie) did feele the same stirre and moue, as if it had been a liuing creature, but did not turne vp the clothes, as thinking or regarding so to doe.
The fellow was neere driuen, or at the least growne verie drie in saying: that hee thought not, nor regarded to turne vp the clothes.
In an other place he saith, that when they saw, as it were, a kitling, and sometimes three or foure running vp and downe vnder the couerlet, wherewith the boy was couered, as he lay vpon his bed, they did sodainely cast vp the said couerlet, to see what was vnder it: but still the supposed formes of kitlings were vanished away.
And is it then possible, that when hee had grasped one of the saide Kitlinges in his hand, that hee should neither thinke, nor regarde to see and trie what hee had holde of? But of all the examples wherein Maister Darrelles courage hath appeared, there remaineth one pertinent to the point in hande, wherein hee shewed himselfe a man: regarding, or waighing the presence of fiue or sixe Deuilles no more, then if there had beene but so many Butterflyes.
very well remember (sayth he) that at one time whilest some were busily catching at the Deuill or spirits, vnder the couerlet where Somers lay, and had so done for a good space, one saying here he is, an other, there he is, and so catching at them (there being fiue, sixe or seuen spirites at that time there) willed them to desist, saying, they were but wicked spirits, that had taken vpon them certaine bodies.
They were but wicked spirits: a matter of nothing: M. Darrels familiar acquaintances, and not to be feared.
The truth was, that the boy was playing the knaue with his handes, elbowes, and knees, and other partes of his bodie vnder the couerlet: which Maister Darrell could not chuse but know, and therefore did what he could to preuent his detection.
How M. Darrell indeuoured to excuse Somers when hee was taken short, and did such toyes, as did argue him sufficiently to be but a counterfeit.
WHen M. Darrell could not alwaies so preuaile, but that many vppon diuers occasions would bee dealing with the boy in his fittes: and thereuppon perceiued by their words, that they did collect by diuers circumstances, that he had his sences, and so did dissemble: he the said Maister Darrell was charged by her Maiesties said Commissioners, to haue laboured by all the meanes hee could with this excuse, and that excuse, how hee might withstand and preuent that conceit and opinion.
Somewhat to this purpose he himselfe confesseth: but more is deposed.
haue at sundry times said, that Sathan in his subtiltie hath done in the boy some sleight and trifling things, at diuers times, of purpose to deceiue the beholders, and to beare them in hand, that he did neuer greater thinges in him: thereby to induce them to thinke, that he was a counterfeite.
Whilest was in these practises (saith Somers) diuers would snatch at the spirite, which they supposed to haue beene vnder the couerlet or clothes with me, and did thereby sometimes catch mee by the hand, sometimes by my foote, and sometimes by my knee: which M. Darrell perceiuing, and that some did thereby imagine that it was but my knauery, hee told them that out of doubt it was the Deuill that made those motions, and that he did sometimes put my hands or feet into their hands that catched at them, of purpose thereby to hinder the glorie of God, which in this work he said, did manifestly appeare.
But when he was present, he would not suffer (as neere as he could) any to catch at the said supposed spirits, nor to cast vp the couerlet or cloathes, as otherwise vsually they did, to haue seene the Deuill, as they pretended.
When Somers and M. Darrell had beene deceiued by the secret bringing of widdow Boote the pretended witch into the chamber, where Somers lay in one of his fittes: whereby they not knowing thereof, Somers lay quiet, both at her comming in, and at her going out: M. Darrell greatly misliking that practise when he knew of it, and perceiued that some thereby supposed the boy to dissemble, did labour to perswade those that were present saith Somers) that they should not so thinke or suspect: affirming it to be the Deuils practise, and that Sathan woulde not of purpose vexe me at those times as he had done before, that so he might (as much as lay in him) rob God of his glory, and blemish the great works which he did shew in me.
When Somers fell to his fittes againe after Christmas, seeing him doe and acte certaine foolish toyes, was therewith discontented: and tolde Maister Darrell before diuers, that verily thought the boy did dissemble.
And Maister Darrell gaue me this answere: that such things as hee did, were but the illusions of the Deuill, assuring me, that hee did not dissemble, but was againe repossessed.
And againe: Maister Darrel would alwaies excuse the boy, if he did any thing that might be thought to be counterfeit: saying, that it was the Deuill that did the same, thereby to blemish the glorie of God.
Being many times and often with the boy, obserued in him many foolish and friuolous gestures: which gaue me some sparke of suspition of his dissimulation.
For in all those fittes, Maister Darrell would say: let him alone, it is not hee in deed, but the Deuill that doth it: and vpon the like occasions would further affirme, that the Deuill indeuoured to darken the worke of God.
Againe, heard Maister Aldred charge the boy, to take heed that hee did not dissemble: whereunto the boy aunswered, that he did not dissemble: for (saith he) do not know of any strange thinges that you say haue done: and thereupon Maister Darrell said: let him alone, it is not hee in deed, but the Deuill that doth it.
And againe, Maister Darrell did labour to perswade the people, and that in his Sermons, that when the boy had done something that might argue him to be a dissembler, it was but a practise of the Deuill, thereby to blemish the glory of God.
Maister Darrell hath said before the boy, to such as haue beene medling with him in his fits: let him alone, for it is not hee, but the Deuill, and that the Deuill would hinder the glory of God, by all the meanes he could.
telling Maister Darrell diuers times saith M. Lowe) that if the Deuill were in Somers, wondred that Somers could speake no language but English: Maister Darrell answered me (as hee did generally to my argument that was alleadged of the boyes counterfeyting) that the Deuill did it to hinder the glory of God in his dispossession.
Being intreated by M. Euington to come to Garlands house, to see the boy in his fits, and to confirme mee that hee was not a counterfeite, because had alwayes doubted him so to bee: went thither, where found Maister Darrell, M. Dodde, M. Hildersham, M. Aldridge, M. Euington, and others.
At my first comming into the house, found the boy in no fitte: but vpon some few speeches vsed to him by the Ministers, he presently fell into one.
In the which fitte he continued a while, and then foamed excedingly: whereat (quoth M. Darrell, and the rest of the ministers) marke pray you, for this is the especiallest signe of his repossession.
Hereupon suspecting something, laid my head close to the boyes head, where heard a kind of grating of somewhat betwixt his teeth, then told Garland the boyes keeper, that thought something was in his mouth.
Whereupon Garland, taking him by the haire of the head, and by his mouth, we shooke out of his mouth a peece of blacke leade, thereupon he awaked out of his fit.
Then quoth Maister Aldridge, Will. hadst thou not a peece of blacke leade about thee, or in thy mouth: no quoth the boy.
And vpon this the foresaid ministers generally concluded, that it was a practise of the Deuil, to throw the said black leade into the boyes mouth, thereby to choke him.
In one fit saw William Somers froath at the mouth very much, so as the foame roaped downe into his necke: and at one time found a peece of blacke leade in his mouth.
At one time foaming (saith Somers very much in my fit, Edm. Garland vpon some mans motion (as suppose) would needes search if had any thing in my mouth: and confesse, that he found there a peece of blacke leade, which had put into my mouth, that therby might foame in more aboundant maner.
Some other examples might be brought of M. Darrels shifting deuises, to preserue the boyes credite, or rather his owne.
For this course was vsuall with him, insomuch as when he was absent, that the boy did any thing that went a wry, his schollers were so cunning, that they were able to coyne him some excuses.
Edward Freeman, going one morning with two or three Shoemakers to Garlands house, and perceiuing that whilest he was there, Somers would not fall into any of his fits, he departed, being desirous that the Shoemakers (who had neuer seene him) should then see a fitte: and at his departure he told them, that as soone as he was gone, they should see him in one.
This Freeman was one, to whome Somers before had confessed his counterfeiting, and therefore hee forbare his fittes whilest he was present.
But he was no sooner out of the dores almost, when he fell to his prankes.
Now at the said Freemans departure, Mistres Aldridge affirmed, that the Deuill woulde not shew any thing to them that did not belieue.
Likewise when M. Crauen twitching Somers by the finger in one of his fits: he the said Somers cried: Oh who is that that nips me? One Wilkinson to excuse the matter said, that it might be the Deuill was then leauing him, when Maister Crauen began to nip him.
How contrarie to M. Darrels assertion, Somers had his sences vnderstanding in his fittes.
THere is no building bee it neuer so strong, that will long continue, if the foundation be not sure.
He is therefore accounted a very vnwiseman, that wil build either vpon the sands, or vppon hollow false grounde. which point of good architecture or husbandry, if Maister Darrell had well learned, he would neuer haue set the frame of all his cosening practises, vpon that moist and marish conceit, that Somers in his fits was altogether sencelesse.
For besides, that none of his fellow Deuill driuers was euer so absurd, as to maintaine his position in that behalfe generally, his weake ground in this particular of Somers is shaken and ouerthrowne, by many depositions.
The chiefe deceit to bleare all their eyes at Nottingham, was the perswasion beaten into them by M. Darrell, that Somers was senceles in al his fits, that when he spake, it was not he, but the Deuill that spake in him.
George Noble alledgeth three reasons, why he thought Somers to haue his sences in his fits, and consequently, to dissemble in pretending the contrarie.
The first is, because (said he) that Somers dancing vpon a bed, and a window being somewhat low, that would haue hurt him, if hee had not taken some heed of the same, he the said Somers would still be looking carefully at the said window least he shold chance to hit it, and so hurt himselfe.
Secondly, in that a Londoner being by, and bidding him the said Somers to serue God: he the said Somers bad him get him into his countrey: and after being asked by the said Londoner where that was, bad him scoffingly, go looke.
Thirdly, hee also then heard, that one should bid him put vp his shirt, then hanging out at his knee, whilest he was dauncing vpon his bed, and he did so.
Vpon the Sonday in the morning went againe to see Somers, where after had a while remained, that the boy was dancing, leaping, and playing diuers trickes vpon his bed, it happening that his shirt hanging out of his knees, and speaking of it to one Rhodes, that stood by me, he the said Somers as he was leaping dancing in his said fit, did with his hand pul vp his shirt, whereby I, together with Peter Rhodes, George Noble, Iohn Rhodes, and Thomas Freeman perceiued, that the boy had sence in that fit, contrarie to M. Darrels saying ouer night.
Vpon the Sunday morning, after that M. Darrell came to Nottingham; went to see Somers, and the house being full, he began his tricks, and as he was dancing and leaping, his shirt did hang out of his hose, and he put his hand in at his codpeece, pulled it vp: and as he ran backward, he looked behind him how neere the wall was for hurting himselfe.
It was constantly receiued (saith M. Hallam that Somers in his fits had neither sence, memory, nor vnderstanding: which he refelleth: First, because he answered directly vnto certaine questions when he was in his fittes, as being asked whether a certaine woman could see, he said she could: being asked how a Sow was killed, he answered, that a waine ranne ouer her.
Secondly, for that staring with his eyes (when made as though would haue put my fingers into them) hee the said Somers winked.
Thirdly, because Somers lying quiet when mother Boote was brought in by me, perceiued, that at such times as Somers shewed himselfe to be troubled, at the comming in of witches, hee knew of their comming before hand.
M. Crauen setteth downe this position, that Somers being in his fittes, had the vse of all his senses.
And hee proueth the same by fiue or sixe reasons: the summe whereof followeth.
First, because Somers remembred what he saide in his fittes, and was afraide, which shewed to him to haue both memory and fancie.
Secondly, for his outward senses, as for seeing, in that haue beene many times present, when the boy hath raysed himselfe vppon his bedde being in his fittes, to see who came in at the dore, and hath named them as they entred, and iested vpon them: also hee would spie if any children stoode neare the bedde, and at them especially hee would many times leape and make faces, and laugh exceedingly when hee saw them afraide.
Thirdly, touching hearing, because the boy would many times talke merrily with the and answered any man directly to any question he would propound.
Fourthly, concerning smelling, for that a Gentlewoman comming in, who had ciuette, and sweete powder (which yeelded indeed a sweete sauour) oh (sayeth the boy in one of his fittes) what a sweet smell is here? Fiftly, for his sense of feeling, in that being pricked with a pin before the Commissioners at Nottingham into the legge, hee sodainely plucked it vppe: and because the same day in an other fitte, made him to cry out with a twitch of his little finger, he saide, oh what is it that nips me? Somers in one of his fittes, whilest was present, did laugh exceedingly: and demaunding of him when his fitte was ended, what moued him so to laugh, he told mee, it was because the Deuill shewed him a bagge of golde, and tolde him hee would giue it him. &c. which moued mee to thinke that he vnderstoode and remembred what hee did, or suffered in his fittes.
His taunting and vsing of slaunderous speeches (when he was in his fittes) against such as he liked not, might easily bee obserued to proceede from his owne ordinarie lewde inuention, besides, many lewde and grosse gestures, not fit to bee mentioned.
Againe, where it was saide, hee had no sense in his fittes, haue heard him diuerse times being in his fittes, call many by their true names, and describe others by nicknames, so as it appeared, hee had both sense and vnderstanding.
With Garland also do agree in effect word for word, M. Parre, M. Aldridge, M. Aldred, and Iohn Sherrart.
By Somers answere vnto mee in these wordes: Ah sirrha, you thinke counterfeyte, resolued my selfe, that hee had sense, and vnderstanding in his fittes, as at other times also had obserued in him.
V. Of the motions and knockinges which were heard and seene about Somers in his fittes, that they were done and made by himselfe, and were not as M. Darrel hath reported, extraordinary or supernaturall.
IN the Certificate to the L. Archbishop of Yorke, from the Commissioners at Nottingham, the knocking and motions about Somers in his bed, were certified amongst the extraordinarie actions done by him in his fittes.
M. Darrell termeth them extraordinary, and supernaturall actions: and in his Apologie writeth of them in this sorte.
Hereunto, adde that most rare accident that hapned vnder the Couerlette, where Somers lay.
at one instant, stirring and mouing vnder our hands, as if they had beene kitlinges, whelpes, or such liuing creatures: the Couerlette being sodainely cast vppe, they vanished away, but throwne downe, they were presently there againe.
He that once hath passed the limites of modesty, doth easily grow in short time to be impudent.
What Somers himselfe hath saide hereof, together with some other fooleries of M. Darrelles, you may peruse in the fourth Chapter of the second booke, and what is deposed, doth here insue.
Hauing heard of many wonders, of certaine knockinges in Somers bedde, was very desirous carefully to obserue the same: so as one night about twelue of the clocke, Somers being waken, heard this noyse somewhat dully, and thinking it to bee about the beddes feete, conueyed my hand into the bedde verie secretly and softly, and on the sodaine laide my left hand on the boyes feete, and there felt one of his toes, slipping downe from the other, which was the verie knocking at that time.
After which time the boye neuer vsed the like knocking in my presence.
For motions, haue beene oftentimes there, when others haue sayde, they haue felt the quantitie of a Mouse, mouing and panting vnder their handes: but my selfe, though haue often endeuoured to feele, and presently followed the hands of them, that sayde they felt, could notwithstanding, neuer perceiue any thing.
For the knocking, haue also heard it &c. notwithstanding, more wondred at the boyes cunning, then at the Deuilles dancing.
Again, this Deuill was of a strange constitution, palpable to some, but visible to none.
And againe, haue discouered the sleighte of his iugling in many thinges: as when the noyce of foure or fiue knockes were heard together in manner of a chime, found one of them to bee his finger thrust vnder his thigh, as he lay vppon his backe: which thing would haue shewed vnto the people, had not the boy by force of his thigh wrested it from mee, and turned himselfe hastely vppon his belly, whereuppon the Chime for that night ceased.
For any likenes or shape, or motion of any bodily substance, to bee seene or felt aboue or vnder the Couerlette, vtterly deny it: except it were the body or partes of the body of the boy, who lying alwayes vnder a Couerlette, might be the sleight and nimble motion of some partes of his body, deceite the eyes of the beholders.
Touching the likenesses of Kitlinges mouing in Somers bed, haue heard much wonder thereof, and at one time Thomas Slater being with mee, wee behelde a thing moue and rolle vnder the Couerlette, whereupon Slater catched it in his handes, and drew his dagger of purpose to stab it, and presentlie wee turned vp the cloathes, and it was the boys foot, which know to be true, because was present at the feeling and doing thereof.
Again, to the tapping and rapping, haue heard the same, and did vpon the hearing of it, imagine that it was the fillipping of one toe with another vpon the bed, and sometimes with his fingers as he found occasion, which suspecting, did at my going to bed secretly practise it.
And it fell out to be so agreeable with that which the boy did, as my wife being in bed with mee, was on the sodaine in greate feare, that Somers spirite had followed me.
Catching on a time at that which saw moue the cloathes, got holde of it, and offering to cast vppe the cloathes, to see what had in my hand, it slipped from me, and did then suspect, and do now belieue it to be true, that the thing had holde of was the boyes priuie members, and that offering to pull vp the cloathes, he shrinking in his bed pulled them out of my hand, not holding fast, because then suspected so much, Againe, Somers lying at my house, found him in a plaine tricke of dissimulation, vz. he lying in a bed, and hearing a knocking at the beds feete, stepped hastely to the place, and catched the boy by the toes, which perceyued to haue made the former knocking, and then said, this is a counterfeyte knacke indeede: Whereat Somers laughed.
For the knocking and tapping, haue oft heard the same, now verilie think, that it was done by the boyes own deuise, which did not formerly conceiue, for that gaue too much credite to the opinion and learning of M. Darrell.
Touching the rapping about Somers bed, and M. Hallam came to the beddes side and heard it: and afterwardes conferring together priuately M. Hallams opinion was, that it was nothing else, but the tapping of one of his toe nayles vppon an other.
haue heard sometimes a tapping about the boyes bed, which verily thinke was eyther the fillipping of his fingers, or some motion with his toes.
Againe, touching a matter of substance, which moued in his bed, did once catch holde of it, and grasped it in my hand, and doe thinke, that it was eyther his knee or his thigh.
saw a thing moue in the boyes bed, and laide my hand on it, but it got from me know not how.
The second time catched at it vnder the clothes, and something pulled my hand very straight, and held it fast, and thinke it was my brothers hand: for that complayning of the hurt had, hee fell a laughing at mee: and at that time both his handes were in the bed.
How Somers casting himselfe into the fire, was voluntarie, and no extraordinarie matter, as M. Darrell hath pretended.
AMong&st the admirable workes of William Somers, his casting into the fire, hath no meane reputation.
M. Darrell telleth vs in his Apology: that the boy being cast into the fire, his handes sometimes were in the fire, and that sometimes his face did lye there a while, and yet that he was not burnt at all.
Omitting some other reports, as of likelyhood condemned by himselfe, vz. that lying in the fire, neither his freeze ierkin, nor his hayre touching the burning coales, were so much as sindged.
But Somers himselfe, who should know somewhat hereof, deposeth as followeth.
As touching the reporte of my casting into the fire, without any hurt or sindging eyther of my hayr or apparrel, this is the truth therein.
Because the wordes of casting into the fire, do seeme to importe much.
First say, that the fyres in my Mistresses house, and then afterwardes in my father in lawes, were but very small, made of slate coales, and so compassed at the endes and foreparte with barres of iron, that except should haue thrust my selfe betwixt the saide barres, and the wall, or haue thrust my fingers betwixt the barres, could not in any wise haue cast my selfe into the fire.
But confesse, that M. Darrell hauing tolde me out of S. Marke, and likewise hauing straightly warned such as kept me in my supposed fits, that they should bee very carefull to looke vnto me.
did cast my selfe now and then into the Chimney, or vpon the yrons or grates: but neuer did so, but when there was company by, that would pull mee out presently, and then also, did it with such warines, as was sure, that rather then faile, might helpe my selfe.
And for the sindging neither of my hayr nor apparrell: when cast my selfe into the fire, had commonly eyther my hatte or cappe on, which might keepe my hayre if my head had touched the fire.
And touching my apparrell, it is vntrue that it was not sindged, for the wings and skirtes of my freeze ierkin did shew the contrary.
For my manner was so to fall into the Chimney, as that sometimes my shoulders onelie should touch the grate, and sometimes my buttockes onely, wherby the wings, shoulders, and skirtes of my ierkin, were apparantlie sindged.
But wearing then old leatherne breeches which were greasie, they indeed tooke little hurt.
And more then this in effect, whatsoeuer is reported, say it is false.
Vnto this deposition of Somers diuers other testimonies may be added.
One thing amongst others, (sayeth M. Bernard) saw William Somers acte verie foolishly.
Hee standing by his sister in the Chimney, sodainely clapt his buttockes vpon the fire by her, hauing on a very good strong payre of letherne breeches, and in his falling downe, hee did not clap himselfe right on the fire, but reeled on the one side, was snatched vp immediately: which seeing so vainely done, went away fully resolued of the boyes villanous dissimulations, and could neuer after bee entreated to see him any more.
Somers at the end of one of his fittes sodainely starting vp, went backewardes to the fire, and fell down with his shoulders on the fire, but no man stepping to him, hee tombled quickly out againe of him selfe.
Hereunto also appertayneth that which is set downe in the first Chapter of the thirde Book, concerning his voluntary falling into the fire at S. Iohns, to the admiration of those that were present, and knew not the compact betwixt him and Nicholas Shepheard.
Of Somers pretended strength and weight in his fittes, that contrary to M. Darrelles and his friendes reportes, there was nothing extraordinary in them.
AS touching the pretended strength of Somers in his fittes, it hath bin reported auowed: that three or foure had inough to do to hold him: that foure or fiue had much a doe to holde him: that some times three, sometimes foure, and sometimes six could scarsely holde him.
And M. Darrell enlarging the matter aboue the warrant of his authors, sayeth: that his strength was often such, that sometimes six men could not rule him, had much adoe to holde him, could scarsely holde him.
Had inough to doe to holde him, (say his witnesses): could not rule him, sayeth M. Darrell.
Hee hath so vsed his tongue to deceite, as hardly he can reporte any thing truely.
Somers hath dealt since his examination at London much more sincerely and particularly in this matter.
Concerning my supposed extraordinary strength, (sayeth he) in that it is sayde, that three or foure, fiue or six, and sometimes seauen men vsing their whole strength, were much troubled to hold or carry me, thinke indeede that seemed diuers times to be more strong then was: because often perceiued that they were greatly afraid, who tooke vppon them either to hold or carry me.
Insomuch as at sometimes haue so skarred sondry with my lookes, as they haue started from me.
Again, also so seemed, for that they (being many that toyled themselues about mee) much hindred one an other by pulling of me contrary wayes.
Besides, for one of my yeares and bignesse, haue a reasonable strength, and doe thinke it no great matter to trouble foure or fiue, that should take vpon them to carrie me: as did those that tooke vpon them to carrie me to Smalles house, the morning before the fast.
It hath also beene reported, that when haue seemed sencelesse, that haue not breathed, that my pulse hath not moued, and that haue beene colde, as though had beene dead: they might as well thinke, haue said, that was dead, and that M. Darrell hath restored mee to life againe.
That therefore which hath beene giuen out touching my pulse, my coldnesse, and my not breathing, is vtterly vntrue.
confesse that the time of the yeare was very colde, when did practise those fittes, and being for the most part in my doublet and hose, could not chuse but be often very cold.
But of these last points, as by the way: his supposed extraordinarie strength is the thing in hande: whereof there are these subsequent depositions.
Sometimes Somers woulde make shew of great strength, when being proued by mee, it was but ordinarie according to his person.
And againe, whereas it was reported, that Somers had extraordinarie strength, found him often of easie strength, and to make shew of greater strength then in deede he had.
saw and heard great admiration of the boyes strength and waight, and seeing one attempting to lift him, was tossed and sweat much therewith, for my satisfaction indeuoured to lift him vp in his fitte, and did it very easily: neyther finding nor perceiuing any supernaturall strength or waight in the saide boy.
was at Garlands house with the boy, where were present M. Darrell, M. Euington, M. Aldridge, M. Hildersham, M. Dod, some others: there some one said, it is giuen out that this is counterfeit, and therefore let vs see him that doth think so, now to trie his strength.
Whereupon M. Euington called out me, (because he heard my opinion thereof before) and bad mee trie the boyes strength.
And so said, the boy was in a fitte, and presently thrust downe his leg as stiffe as might be, and came to him heaued at him lifted him vp.
The ministers asked me what waight he was, answered, that had lifted an hundred and an halfe with more ease in my youth: yet do not thinke him to be of that waight.
Then they bad me to bow the boyes legge: and seeing how he had stretched it out, set my knee to his knee, and then bended his legge backward at my pleasure.
Hearing of the boyes extraordinary strength, thought good to trie it: and vpon proofe, found it to bee but ordinarie: and so likewise for his waight, could neuer perceiue it to bee extraordinarie.
haue often proued the boyes strength in his fittes, but neuer founde it to bee but ordinarie.
And haue oftentimes, when he hath fallen vpon the floore, taken him vp my selfe, and laide him vpon the bed, neuer perceiuing him either to be extraordinarily strong or heauie.
Towards the euening, the boy making shew as though he would throw himselfe into the fire, catched at him, and notwithstanding the great strength waight that he was supposed to haue, vz. that foure or fiue could scarce stirre or hold him, threw him easily vpon the bed, which when the boy perceiued, and that hee was in my hands, to whom he had before discouered his counterfeiting, he presently cried out: Lord haue mercie vpon me, and gaue ouer his fit.
Being with Somers one night, after his knocking had beene discouered, he assaying to heaue vp his bodie in a maruellous manner, and indeuouring to keepe him downe, could not doe it: but looking more neerely vnto him, espied that hee supported himselfe with his legs sholders, wherfore putting my hand into the bed, taking his legs from vnder him, he came down quickly with ease.
More to this purpose may be seene in the fourth Chapter of the second booke, how the boy by shrinking downe, and standing close to him that assaide to lift him, made shew of greater strength, and weight then he had.
Somers knowledge in his fits was not extraordinary, as M. Darrell and his friends haue falsly pretended: neither could hee speake Greeke, Hebrew, or Latine, otherwise then hee had learned.
THe authour of the briefe Narration, to proue that Somers had extraordinarie knowledge: and thereby to inforce that hee was possessed, the same his knowledge proceeding from Sathan that was within him, doth tell vs, that Somers in his fittes spake of things done in his absence, at the instant when he spake them: as that (saith he) of the examination of Millicent Horsley, and of M. Darrels M. Aldriges comming, vnknowne to any there present.
These examples which the Narrator alleageth, being meere vntruthes, cosenages, M. Darrell (it seemeth) is in his Apologie ashamed of them, and therefore hee omitteth them.
Or if not so, his fault is the greater, in that he hath so set downe this matter, as though it had beene much more wonderfull, then by the said examples it could bee well induced.
For thus hee reporteth it: His knowledge was such, that by vertue thereof, hee tolde of those things which were done and spoken diuers miles of him, at the same instant they fell out, and foretold thinges to come.
From hence also it was, that diuine like he continued his speech, in expounding the Creede for an howre together.
Who woulde not thinke by these generall tearmes, that the boye had beene a kinde of Prophete? But they are (bee you sure) a couple of false seducers, and counterfeyte companions: it being impossible, (if they were not madde) but that they should write these thinges, against their owne consciences, and of purpose for their owne reputations, to abuse their Readers.
Concerning the boyes expounding of the Creede, the truth thereof hath beene shewed in the first Chapter of this booke: and for the rest, how ridiculous it is, that which ensueth will declare and make manifest.
And first, as touching this of M. Darrels comming to Nottingham.
Besides, that the boy vnderstoode by Hugh Wilson, and by other speeches of diuerse persons, (to omit the compact betwixt them of his promised repaire, when Somers could so acte his fittes, as he should be thought thereby to be possessed) that M. Darrell was stil expected, he sayeth thus, for his saide pretended extraordinarie knowledge.
As M. Darrell was comming, one ouertaking him vpon Trent bridge, and ouergoing him, reported in Nottingham that M. Darrell was coming, which reporte being brought to the house where lay, heard thereof, and did also perceiue, that he was comming by their looking out, and by the speeches of some others, that ranne forth to see him.
Wherevpon did say, that M. Darrell was comming: which wordes of mine, they that were present heard them, tooke them (as it seemeth) to be miraculous, because M. Darrell had sent worde by Hugh Wilson (but falsly) that in my fittes, heard no more then a blocke, which conceite did nourish as much as could, during the time of all my counterfeyting.
And more then this, concerning this supposed wonder of my foretelling of M. Darrels comming, deny to be true.
Now, for his supposed skill in foretelling of M. Aldridges comming vnto him, and so of diuers which might as wel haue beene added, protest (saith Somers) that this is the truth which insueth, whatsoeuer is giuen out to the contrarie.
There were for the most part diuers in the place, where did lye, when was in my fits: and some of them would bee commonly looking out at the windowes, and as they saw any Preacher comming, or any other man of note, they would say amongest themselues, one to an other, that such a man, naming him, was comming.
Whereby still ouer hearing them (they supposing me to heare nothing at all) did oftentimes then say, that such a man was comming, and likewise named him: which they alwaies thought through M. Darrels instructions, to be done by the Deuill, they supposing me to be possessed.
And thirdly, as touching the report of his skill, concerning Millicent Horsley, thus also Somers himselfe doth depose.
It hath beene giuen out, that I, hauing before named Millicent Horsley for a witch, should tell the time, and the words that she vttered, when she was examined before one M. Parkins, a Iustice of the peace, and others, foure miles distant from Nottingham, where then remained: the truth whereof is thus: Maister Darrell told my father in law, and others in my hearing, that he the said Maister Darrell, Maister Aldred, and some others, were going to carrie Millicent Horsley (that present morning) to the said Maister Parkins, to bee examined.
Whereupon, gessing by the time of Maister Darrels departure, and by the distance of the way, and of the likelihood that she would deny her selfe to bee a witch, said to those that were present by mee in one of my fittes, about eleuen of the clocke, that then Millicent Horsley was in examining, and that she denyed her selfe to be a witch.
Hereof when Maister Darrell at his returne was certified, hee accounted it a great wonder, affirming, that had truely spoken, both concerning the time, and the witches wordes.
And then hee and others tooke vppon them to write diuers thinges about that matter, which had neuer thought of: as that had foretold, that the said witch was picking of her toes, when they came to her house in the morning: and that she denying to go with them, they were compelled to draw her forth by force: which things they also said, were true.
Howbeit, did verie well know, that had neuer spoken of them: but was content to let them say what they list, because such reportes did giue the more credite to the rest of my doinges.
And whereas one Ione Pie hath deposed before the Commissioners, authorised from the Lord Archbishoppe of Yorke, that made mention of Millicent Horsleyes examination, about one of the clocke in the afternoone, doe not thinke, that therein she deposed truely, or at the least thinke Maister Darrell at his returne, signifying, that the said Millicent was in examining, about one of the clocke, did thereby make her the saide Ione to imagine, that it was about that time, when had spoken of the saide Millicent Horsley.
But maruaile, why some other examples of my supposed wonderfull knowledge of one Beresforde, whom was thought neuer to haue seene before: notwithstanding, that about a yeare or more then past, went with the said Beresforde towards Chesterfielde.
Whereupon, when hee came vnto mee in my supposed fittes, named vnto him certaine stiles in the way: and some other thinges, whereof wee had spoken, as we were going together: as that hee should haue beene a schoolemaister, and that hee was going to his brother, &c. which things Maister Beresforde, confessing to bee true, it was reckoned for a miraculous matter: the rather because hee affirmed, that hee had neuer seene mee before, neither was it knowne to any then present, that had euer beene in his companie.
Likewise, it might here haue beene added, how tolde one of the Iaylors, (as remember) of the Queenes prison, howe much money he had in his purse: which happened in this sort: desired to borrow sixe pence of one Henry Ball that stoode by me: whoe presently said to the rest of the companie, that had truely tolde him what money hee had in his purse, and that hee had in deed but sixe pence in it.
Whereupon quoth one of the saide Iaylors (leaning vpon Henrie Balles shoulder by my beds head,) If hee can tell mee how much money haue in my purse, shall then verily thinke that he hath a Deuill in him.
And so the said Iaylor telling Ball softly in my hearing (whom they supposed alwaies to bee sencelesse in my fittes) that hee had three shillinges in his purse, and no more, he did then aske mee what money hee had in his purse: and tolde him he had three shillinges: which seemed to be a very strange matter to all that were present.
And thus farre Somers himselfe, of his owne extraordinary knowledge.
Now let vs heare what is deposed of this matter.
First, that the boy neuer cryed (in my hearing) at the approach of any person accused, but eyther when some noyse was made about the dore, whereby he might gesse of her comming, or else some bodie tolde aloude in the house, that the Witch was comming.
Secondly, that he would raise his head from the pillow at the comming in of euery Witch, and be sure to see her within the house, before hee fell (as they called it) into his sleeping traunce.
Thirdly, that hee cryed sometimes, as though a Witch had beene neere at hande, when none was eyther comming, or sent for.
As once when the Constable said, they would fetch one Morris wise, whom he had affirmed to be a witch, hauing a familiar, in likenesse of a birde: vpon a noise of people at the dore, he cried out after his vsuall manner: which made euery man present to looke for the witches comming in: whereas the Constable vppon some better aduise, neuer went for her.
Fourthly, that when a woman, accused for a witch, was closely brought in for an experiment by M. Hallam, (a minister of honest report) the boy neither cried at her comming or going, nor slept as he was wont whilest she staied in the house.
thought that Somers had named some for witches by an extraordinary knowledge, being therein confirmed by Maister Darrels speeches, of the detection of certaine witches by some in Lancashire.
But now because he named none for witches, but such as were commonly reputed so before, and for that Somers saith, he had no other knowledge whereby he named them: rather thinke it to be true, which the boy affirmeth, then that hee had any extraordinarie knowledge of them.
And againe, at one time, came to Robert Coopers house when the boy was in a fit, there was brought into the house widdow Else of Carleton, formerly nominated by him to be a witch, and sent thither by M. Aldred (as thinke.)
Vpon her comming, the boy grow to increase in his fitte: but when she came neere, and that he saw her, he became quiet.
Whereupon purposing to make triall, whether he dissembled in that point or no, tooke the widdow Else away, and walked to the Church dore, (which was about thirtie yards distant from Coopers house.)
And after some stay made there, returned to the house againe, brought the said woman close behind me: where we found the boy well at meate.
And after some few speeches with him (as asking him if hee had any good meate, and whether should eate with him: he answering yea, if it pleased me) moued my bodie awrie: by meanes whereof, he viewing the woman that stood still close behind me all the while at my backe, did fall presently into a fit.
It is likewise proued by M. Hallams deposition, that the boy had no extraordinarie knowledge, as it was pretended.
First, in that when a blinde woman was taken in suspition to be a Witch, he asking Somers being in a fitte, whether that Witch could see or no: he saide shee could: Secondly, in that when widdow Boote was brought in and out, three seuerall times secretly, he not knowing of it, neyther altred eyther at her comming in, or going out, as otherwise his manner was.
M. Darrell was charged before her Maiesties saide Commissioners, that hee had very confidentlie affirmed, that the boy in some of his fittes, did speake Latine, Greeke, and Hebrewe, in a very admirable sorte.
And he confesseth the same in effect to be true: But hee is conuinced of great ouersight therein, by sondrie depositions.
What M. Darrell hath deposed, doth here ensue: and the witnesses to the contrary doe afterwardes follow.
haue saide that William Somers in some of his pretended fittes, did speake some Hebrew, and Greeke, being altogether ignorant in both those languages: but it was verie little, that hee so spake.
And in that he spake no more, it did proceede from the subteltie of Sathan, who if hee had spoken much in that sorte, should haue made his owne worke in Somers most manifest: and likewise confesse, that diuerse questions being propounded in Latine to Somers, he the saide Somers answered aptlie in Latine so long, that hee driue one speaking into him in that language, to a non plus, as belieue, being one that was no great scholler, although he the saide Somers (as belieue) could not of himselfe haue answered so in Latine.
The saide M. Darrell being here demaunded, whether he was present, when the boy did speake eyther Hebrew, Greeke, or Latine, answereth, that he was not: but sayeth, that the Greeke wordes (which he doth not remember) were deliuered vnto him in writing, by a Maister of Arts, one Bernard: and the Latine wordes (which he hath also forgotten) by one Iohn Wiggen: And touching the Hebrew, hee sayeth, that he hath so heard, but knoweth not who tolde him, nor anie thing of the certainety thereof.
man of such good partes as M. Darrelles friendes do account him, would not haue published such matters vppon so slender groundes.
And yet if he had saide truly therein, his credulitie might in some sorte haue excused him.
Whereas it hath beene conceiued, that should reporte, that William Somers in his fittes did answere in Greek, and Latine, to many questions demaunded of him: for the speaking of Greek, remember that one Maister Iohn Lowe spake vnto him in Greeke, and he answered him nothing but laughed.
And for his speaking of Latine, my meaning was, that Somers saide: Ego sum Deus, Ego sum Rex: and sometimes, etiam, non, &, minime, and otherwise, not any saying, or sentence whole together.
Albeit, (sayeth M. Bernarde) that was oftentimes with Somers in many of his fittes: yet hee did neuer speake or pronounce any Hebrew, Greek, or Latine, at any time, when was present.
And with M. Bernard, doe agree word for word in effect, M. Crauen, and M. Hallam.
went to William Somers, of purpose to trie, whether hee could speake, or the supposed Deuill in him, eyther Latine, Greeke, or any learned language, that might enforme my selfe concerning the truth or falshoode of his pretended possession.
Whereupon apposing him with diuers questions in Greeke, and in Latine, neither he the saide Somers, nor the supposed Deuill in him, did answere one word, eyther in Greeke, or Latine, except etiam, or minime, or such like, without any fitte relation to that which had beene asked.
And againe, talking with Maister Darrell diuerse times about the premisses, and telling him, that if the Deuill were in Somers, wondred that he could speake no languages but English: Maister Darrell answered mee, (as hee did generally to any argument that was alledged of the boyes counterfeyting) that the Deuill did it to hinder the glory of God in his dispossession.
By the perswasion of Mistresse Gray, did goe to see William Somers with this resolution, that if he had (as it was reported) a Deuil in him: the Deuill hauing the vse of his tongue, could speake Latine, Greeke, or any other learned language.
Whereupon, when came vnto him, spake in Latine, and asked an answere from him in Latine againe: but hee did not answere me any thing at all in Latine, but non, and nolo: which perceyuing, tooke him for a counterfeyte, and so afterwardes did alwaies repute him.
There was no impossibility in Somers fittes, as M. Darrell and his friendes haue falsly pretended.
THe generall plee of M. Darrell in his Apologie, and of the author of the briefe Narration, with the rest of his friendes, in defence of himselfe, and to proue that Somers did not dissemble, is this: vz. that those thinges which he did in his fittes, were impossible for him to haue done by any naturall or artificiall power: and that therefore there was some supernaturall cause of them, which was sayeth Maister Darrell) and euill spirite possessing him.
For sayeth hee further, if those thinges most strange, and admirable can be done by any humaine skill, deny not but hee may bee a counterfeyte.
For the better satisfaction therefore of the Gentleman, it may please him to peruse the last Chapter of the thirde Booke, and there to consider, what his owne witnesses vpon their reexamination haue deposed, touching these pretended impossibilities, and also to vouchsafe the reading of these depositions following.
Now consider without feare, what things the boy did in his fittes: thinke any other of his nimblenes and capacitie may doe the like.
neuer did see any thing that Somers did, to make mee to thinke, that it was supernaturall.
And againe, tolde M. Darrell, that Somers was no more possessed then was my selfe: for (quoth I) haue seene him doe all his fittes, and my selfe can doe two more then he hath done.
Why then (quoth M. Darrel thou art possessed with a Deuill: to whome answered, that hee lyed, and that was as good a Christian as he.
Notwithstanding, all the wonders by other men seene, and reported, it was neuer my happe, though often there, to see him doe any thing, which an other boye that woulde haue endeuoured himselfe to the like lewdenes, might not easily haue performed.
was but twise with Somers in all his fittes, and at one of the same times, well remember, that M. Aldred asked mee my opinion, touching the truth or falshood of the boyes repossession, wherunto answered, that saw nothing but it might bee counterfeyted.
was ofte with the boy in his fittes, and could neuer see any thing done by him, but could doe the like.
Seeing Somers in his fittes the fift of Nouember, heauing vppe his belly, drawing his mouth towardes his eares: scriching &c.
departed away perswaded that he was a counterfeyte, and that he did nothing, but that which a boye naughtely disposed might doe aswell as he.
Standing near to the bed where Somers lay vpon the day of his pretended dispossession, and well noting the manner of his present fittes, could not perceiue any extraordinarie thing to be done by the boy, but what any other might well haue done, although M. Darrell did then endeuour to perswade the hearers present, that they were past the power of any naturall man to doe.
Although saide M. Wallys, brother in law to M. Darrell,) had diuerse times heard, that the boy did thinges past the naturdll power of man: yet when saw them, could not perceiue any such strangenes in them: and therefore did forbeare much to visite him.
Seing William Somers vpon the Saturday at night (before his pretended dispossession,) lye on his bed, gaping, strugling, and spurning, obserued that any body naughtily disposed, might haue done the same.
neuer saw (sayeth Richard Newton, one of M. Darrels chiefe deponentes Somers doe any thing, but that a boye of his yeares might easily doe.
Whether these depositions will satisfie M. Darrell his friendes, it may be doubted, they are so strongly possessed with their owne conceites: but to anie reasonable men, they will be sufficient, to shew the vanitie of the forsaide pretended impossibilities.
X. How contrarie to M. Darrels and his friends assertions, William Somers was accounted by many in Nottingham, for a dissembler, from the time that he beganne his practises there, vntill he confessed the same himselfe.
IT hath beene falsly giuen out by M. Darrell and his friendes, that there was no suspition and reporte that Somers was a counterfeyte, till about a moneth after M. Darrels comming to Nottingham, and that then, hee the saide Somers, hauing detected a kinsewoman of M. Freemans for a Witch, he the saide M. Freeman began to reporte that the boy was a counterfeyte.
For the truth is, that he was deemed for a dissembler, not onely before M. Darrels comming to Nottingham, but likewise aswell whilest M. Darrell dealt with him about his dispossession: as afterwardes also in the whole course of his pretended fittes, as by the depositions following it will appeare.
First therfore concerning the opinion held of Somers, before M. Darrels comming to Nottingham.
It being obiected against M. Darrell before her Maiesties commissioners, that he was aduertised vpon his first comming thether, that he the said Somers was thought by many to bee a dissembler: he denyeth the same: but that is deposed, as also that Somers was so reputed: and that hee the saide M. Darrell vnderstanding thereof, laboured as much as he could to perswade the contrary.
At M. Darrels comming to my house (saith Thomas Porter) on the Saturday at night, the fift of Nouember, told him, that it was reported by the townesmen, that the boy did counterfeyte: and M. Darrell in the presence of the boye, and of manie people there present answered: doe assure you, they that thinke so, shall see with their eyes the contrary.
After three or foure dayes, that William Somers did begin to haue fittes, did verily thinke that hee did but dissemble: and when could not perswade him to desist from that course, did refuse afterwardes to come to him for the space of a weeke or more, vntill M. Darrell came: by whose wordes was drawne to be of his opinion, vz. that the boye was possessed: for the which am now very sory, and that was so deluded.
And againe, it was very generally receyued and thought, a fortnight before M. Darrels comming to Nottingham, that the boy did dissemble.
M. Aldred also departing, vpon the fift of Nouember, from Somers with this perswasion, that hee was but a counterfeyte, as before it is expressed in the former chapter, he further deposeth thus.
The next day (sayeth he) spake with M. Darrell, who tolde me, that the boye was no counterfeyte, but possessed with a Deuill: and that hee knew it by the signes in the boy, which were like to those signes that he had found in Katherine Wright, and in the vii. in Lancashire.
And then and there, did change my mind of the boyes counterfeyting, relying on the report, credite, and experience of M. Darrell onely: and yet did alwaies doubt in my hart, that he did but dissemble.
Indeede it was thought by many before M. Darrels first comming to Somers, that the Boy did absolutely dissemble.
Vnto these depositions, all those witnesses may be added, who haue testifyed that M. Darrel, the first three daies that he came to Somers, endeuoured nothing more, then to perswade the people, that Somers did not counterfeyte, but was indeed possessed, thereby to beate down the opinion of his dissimulation: which argueth directly that he was acquainted (as Porter hath deposed) with the said opinion.
Secondly also, notwithstanding M. Darrels peremptory assertions, and all his perswasions, for the first three dayes, and afterwardes, that hee came vnto Somers, that he the saide Somers did not dissemble, but was possessed, and afterwardes assalted to be repossessed: yet many still retayned their former opinions that hee was but a counterfeyte, as the depositions, following do declare.
M. Darrel, at his first comming to Somers, did signifie to the people, that the boy did not dissemble, and made many speeches to assure them thereof: but yet many did still holde the contrary opinion.
And againe, M. Darrel in many of his sermons, and at sondrie other times, hath related the manner of the boyes fittes, before the dispossession, and at the dispossession: setting forth the manner and strangenes of them, and hath blamed such as would not belieue the same, charging them with weakenes of faith: And yet notwithstanding, sondrie persons still helde affirmed, that the matter was but dissembled.
M. Darrel, at his first comming to Somers at my house, both on the Saturday, Sonday, and Munday, did signifie that the Boy did not dissemble, and in those times vsed many reasons and speeches to perswade the people there present, to thinke so: but all that notwithstanding, diuerse persons still helde opinion, that the boy did dissemble.
And againe, M. Darrell in many of his Sermons and other speeches, after the dispossession, vrging that the Deuill would seeke to enter into the boy again, did blame those that would not belieue that the boy was possessed, and dispossessed, and charged them with vnbeliefe: and vsed many such like speeches: but yet all that notwithstanding, sondrie persons still helde opinion, that the boy did but counterfeyte.
When Somers was at my house, and made shew that hee saw the Deuill, in this forme, and that forme: and that Maister Darrell tolde the people, that hee saw the Deuill rolling vnder the couerlet, and expounded the knocking and tapping to be the euill spirit: Maister Hallam, and some others began then to suspect the matter to be more strangely accounted of by Maister Darrell, then in deed it was.
And from thenceforth, many began to obserue the boyes fittes with lesse feare, and more circumspection: But at all times sundrie persons still held opinion, that all was but counterfeited: whereat M. Darrell was continually much displeased.
And againe, M. Darrell in sundry of his sermons after the supposed dispossession, did blame those, who helde that the boy did dissemble in his fits, both at the time of his dispossession, and at other times, charging them with vnbeliefe, and deliuering speeches of scorne and disdaine to satisfie them any further therein.
But all this notwithstanding, many still held and affirmed, that it was but dissimulation.
Likewise Peter Rhodes, George Noble, Thomas Freeman, and Nicholas Shepheard (as it is before deposed mentioned) perceiuing by the boies pulling vp of his shirt, in one of his fits vpon the Sonday morning, after M. Darrels comming vnto him, that hee had his sences, they went their waies with this resolution: that for a certainty (as they thought) he was but a counterfeit.
And thirdly, although M. Darrell, when it was commonly giuen out in Nottingham, that Somers was a countererfeit, did (as he confesseth in his sermons) perswade his auditorie (the best he could) to the contrary, affiming confidently that hee was no counterfeie: and notwithstanding all that hee could say and protest concerning Somers fits, when Sathan was seeking to repossesse him, or any thing hee did alleadge for his repossession, eyther before or since: yet the generall opinion in Nottingham and thereabouts, then was still doth continue amongst the discreter sort, that he the said Somers was in all his said practises a counterfeit dissembler.
Maister Crauen saith, that vpon the wonderfull report of the boyes possession and dispossession, he could not at the first but thinke it to be true: which if hee had seene, hee should not perhaps haue so lightly beleeued.
But after his repossession (as they called it) soone chaunged (saith hee) mine opinion: First, because neuer sawe him doe any thing, which an other lewdly disposed, might not easily haue performed.
Secondly, for that discouered the sleight of his iugling in many thinges, vz. in playing his trickes vnder a couerlet.
Thirdly, because the boy seeming wearie of his seruice, did peraduenture take this course to bee rid of it: which doe coniecture, because that after hee was released, he neuer had any fitte (for ought know) till vpon an other discontentment, when he was bound ouer to the assises for a Witch.
Maister Bernard yeeldeth in like sorte certaine reasons, whereby hee was induced to thinke, that Somers dissembled.
First, because hee had heard that Somers began the like fits foure or fiue yeares before.
Secondly, that being a prentise, hee might thereby procure his libertie.
Fourthly, for that he being a proud boy, his pretended wonderfull fittes, did bring him great admiration, which pleased his humour.
Fiftly, in that his latter fittes were more loose, and not so cunningly handled as his first.
And lastly, because in discouering of Witches, he named none but poore and base people, such as hee thought he might bee bolde with.
And againe, seeing the boy acte his fittes vainely and ridiculously, verily thought that all his doinges were but villanies and knaueries.
obserued many fittes to bee feyned by the boy, during the time that hee was at my house: whereupon held him, and accounted him afterwardes for a counterfeite.
And Maister Leigh: When perceyued that the Deuill, that was pretended to bee in Somers, could speake no language but English, tooke the boy for a counterfeite, and so alwaies after did repute him.
Hauing talked with William Somers, and comparing together all thinges, which happened in the time of his supposed possession and repossession, and what hath beene brought to light since, and considering the present estate of the boy, and diuers particulars, whereof haue beene now examined, doe verily thinke and belieue in my conscience, that they were all in Nottingham, who thought the boy to haue beene possessed, and repossessed, very much abused diuersly: and that the said Somers was but a dissembler in all the course of his said fits: and so consequently, that he was neither possessed by Sathan, as it was imagined, nor dispossessed, nor repossessed.
And the boyes father in law: doe verily thinke, and belieue in my conscience, that William Somers did counterfeit all that hee did: that hee was neuer possessed, dispossessed, nor repossessed: and that Maister Darrell hath dealt very vngodly in all this cause, and eyther by compact or cunning, did draw on the said boy in his dissimulation, for what cause know not, except it were for his owne estimation: which doe verily suspect.
These generall depositions are further strengthened by sundry particular testimonies, in euery Chapter almost of this booke: especially in the fourth and fift Chapters, where it is proued, that the pretence of the boyes want of sence in his fittes, and the knockinges and motions vnder a couerlet, were all meere fooleries and dissembled cosenages.
Besides, although this treatise hath growne to be ouer tedious: yet very many thinges haue beene omitted, which would more fully haue discouered Maister Darrels iuglinges, and vnconscionable practises.
It is true, that lesse might haue beene sufficient in such a paltrie matter: sauing that many haue beene caried so headlong with a preiudicate opinion of as it seemed fit for their better satisfaction, to set out the same more at large, then otherwise it had been conuenient.
In this fift Booke are discouered M. DARRELS proceedings with THOMAS DARLING, commonly tearmed, the boy of BVRTON, with one KATHERINE WRIGHT, concerning their pretended possession and dispossession: and likewise a new course which he had begun at Nottingham with the sister of WILLIAM SOMERS, one MARIE COOPER.
I. How M. Darrels credit, touching his dealing with the boy of Burton, doth relie vpon a false foolish booke, that was published of the said boyes pretended possession and dispossession.
ONe Thomas Darling of Burton vppon Trent, beginning to bee sickly in Februarie,
did afterwardes take vppon him to dissemble certaine tricks: wherein continuing till the weeke before Whitsontide following, he was deemed by M. Darrell to bee possessed, and the next day after (as it is pretended) was dispossessed.
From which time hee continued well, by the space of about eight daies, and then being at the schoole, he fell againe to certaine trickes, and perseuered in them by starts two daies, whilest it was pretented that Sathan sought to repossesse him.
Of this whole matter, a storie was afterwardes published in print, and is of such credite with M. Darrell, and his adherents, as hee the said Darrell doth account it in his Apologie a great absurditie, to call the truth of it into any question.
answere saith M. Darrell) that, that can not possibly be.
For in the booke which is printed concerning him, it is reported &c.
And againe: To say that Darling counterfeyted, is to deny the truth of the booke printed: which for the substance of it, hath beene offred to bee confirmed by the oathes of a great many: and is still, if by authoritie they may be thereunto called.
In one of his examinations he saith thus: account that history to be true in substance, but will not iustifie it in euery circumstance.
And being then demanded what he meant by substance, whether he thought that Darling was troubled vexed, had such dialogues with Sathan in his fits, as the said book doth report: his answere is, that he so thinketh.
Concerning therfore the credit of this booke, it was penned by one Iesse Bee, a sadler of Burto~, allied by mariage vnto the said Darling, in this sort: Darling hauing had many fits in my absence, sometimes was informed of them by worde of mouth, from those two that kept him, sometimes receiued some short notes.
But for the most part, such informations as had, were by word of mouth, both from the said keepers, diuers others.
And when was present my selfe at his fits, tooke the notes of his speeches and other thinges which happened, which notes (when came home) ioyned together, as my memory would serue me: alwaies studying rather to write them in better order, then the boy spake them, then in worse: rather binding my selfe to the sence of the boyes words, then to the wordes themselues.
also confesse, that the boyes speeches were oftentimes deliuered so fast one vpon another, as not being able to write the briefe notes of them, one man would tell me one peece, and an other some other peece: which when came home, did still ioyne together, as is before expressed.
But am not sure, that eyther they told mee the truth directly, or that haue therefore written euery thing as shoulde haue done.
And againe, doe confesse that in penning the saide booke, did of purpose set downe many points, to fauour and giue credit vnto Thomas Darlings pretended torments: that in all my speeches and dealings, vsed to countenance, make likely the boyes pretended possession: wherein confesse my selfe to haue beene greatly ouerseene.
Besides the said Iesse Bee, being absent from Darling, by the space of a moneth, and at London, one Thomas Saunders procured the latter parte of this booke to be penned, and that in this order.
He the said Saunders did take short notes in his tables, and when he came home, he did cause one Edward Wightman vpon his report to set them down.
Also vppon the said Iesse Bees returne from London, the schoolemaister of Burton tolde him someting, which he likewise thrust into the latter ende of the booke.
So as (saith he) all these pointes touching my treatise considered: there may be for ought know, very many vntruthes in it.
This booke being penned thus faithfully by Iesse Bee and others, was afterward abridged by one M. Denison, a minister, at the request of M. Walkeden, Tho. Darlings grandfather.
In doing wherof saith M. Denison) after had read two or three leaues together of the said treatise, did set down the sum of the~ as my memory wold serue me, leauing out many things, and adding somtimes of mine own according to the general sence, as imagined.
Furthermore, being fully perswaded by the constant reportes which had heard, that those thinges which were written by the boy, were in substance true: Paid in the contracting of the saide booke, very willingly amplifie the boyes commendation: as well in respect of his owne wordes, as also those speeches, which sometimes the beholders vsed of him: and did bende my selfe to make many thinges appeare more probable then they were in the written coppie.
As when founde such points, as thought might seeme absurd or repugnant one to another.
did of purpose leaue them out: or els amended them as well as could.
For example: where it was in the written coppie (at large) the boyes torments and afflictions in his fits were all of them no doubt meere illusions: iudging those words to crosse the whole intent and meaning of the booke, did of purpose leaue them out of my Abstract.
Againe, where it is in the said written coppie, of the boyes fittes which hee had the ninth of May, vz. Wilt thou giue me whatsoeuer will desire of thee, if will giue thee leaue to enter into mee againe? Auoide Sathan, thou wert in me late enough: all these words purposedly omitted (as think) for that they could not agree with the rest of the discourse of the boies fits before the supposed dispossession.
Moreouer, by reason that did so much trust my memory in the contracting of this booke, perceiue by comparing it with the written coppie, that haue disordred some of the fits, and likewise the circumstance belonging vnto them, ascribing that to one fit which did belong to another: as also some points of the boys supposed speeches to sathan are mistaken by me, some displaced, altering the sence from the written coppy.
Besides these omissions, alterations, mistakings, confessed by M. Denison him selfe, it further apeareth that his abstract, falling afterwards into some hucksters hands, receiued some new additions.
For saith he, wheras in the printed coppy in the
page, it is said, that the partie of whom mention is there made, did vtter an oath: do verily thinke that the same was added by the printer or some bodie els. Againe, where it is said in the printed coppie, pag.
(speaking how the boy was assaulted after his supposed dispossession) vz. here is to be noted, that howsoeuer sathan grieuously assalted him, yet did he not once torment him, because hee was not as before in him: confesse that there were no such wordes in the written copie, nor belieue that of my self did adde them, but am rather of opinion, that M. Darrell when he perused my abstract, hauing receyued it from M. Walkeden, did adde them.
The occasion that the abstract came into M. Darrels handes, was this: hauing sent the booke abridged, to haue it printed at London, (sayeth M. Walkeden afterwards met vpon occasion M. Darrell and M. Hildersham, telling them of the sending of the sayde booke to be printed, they desired mee to send for it backe, that they might haue the perusing of it before it were printed, which accordingly did, and vpon the receipt of it backe againe, sent it vnto M. Darrell.
And (as thinke) both M. Darrell, M. Hildersham had the perusing of it, and vpon their approbation sent it to London againe to bee printed.
And M. Darrell himselfe confesseth, that hee read, or at the least did heare the said Booke red ouer, before it went to the presse: and yet acknowledgeth vppon diuerse occasions, as hereafter shall appear, that sondrie pointes in it are vntrue.
Which being considered together with the premisses, it may well be thought that M. Darrell writeth falsly, when he telleth vs, that a great many would depose the saide Booke to bee true, if they might bee called thereunto by authority, and that the credite of it notwithstanding, Darling may well inough be iudged a counterfeyte.
Besides, it is here likewise to bee obserued, that for ought which hetherto hath appeared vpon any deposition, M. Darrell did himselfe neuer see Darling in aboue one fitte.
So as al those particulars that are grounded vpon his experience, how the deuill dealt with the boy of Burton, and wherof he made so oft mention, in his practises with Somers, do in effect all of them, depend vpon that corrupt and false and ridiculous treatise.
Of M. Darrels rashnes in affirming Thomas Darling to be possessed, and of his cunning instructing him, how to behaue himselfe vpon the day of his pretended dispossession.
WHile&st M. Darrell was instructing of Somers at Ashbie by fittes, this matter of Thomas Darlings fell out at Burton, about a yeare and a halfe before Somers was ready for him.
And it seemeth it was so acceptable vnto him (hauing been out of worke from the pretended dispossession of Katherine Wright, vz. for about nine or ten yeares,) as that hee thrust himselfe into it somewhat grossely.
For being at Burton vpon occasion, about a moneth before the pretended dispossession of Darling, and before he had seene him in any fitte, he gaue it out, that he thought him to be possessed, vpon the bare report of one Robert Toone the boyes vnckle, concerning the manner of his troubles: not doubting (as it seemeth) but that (being the onely man of note in the Countrie, that had skill in casting out Deuilles,) hee should againe bee imployed, if hee could procure that the boye might bee thought to bee possessed.
This his rashnes being obiected vnto him, before her Maiesties saide Commissioners, he denyeth it: but the same is proued as followeth.
About a moneth before Thomas Darlinges pretended dispossession, Iohn Darrell vpon the day of the common exercise at Burton, came with MÂ· Hyldersham, M. More, (as thinke) and diuerse other Preachers vnto my house, to see the said Darling: but at the time of their being there, he had no fits.
Whereupon did relate vnto M. Darrell, and the rest of the saide preachers, the manner of the boyes fittes: and then M. Darrell answered, that his opinion was, the boy was possessed.
But M. Hildersham, M. More (as remember) did say, that they were of an other opinion, and asked of M. Darrell his reasons, why he thought the boy to be possessed.
And then the Preachers said, they would conferre further about the matter.
Touching this conference mentioned by Toone, it should seeme, it was had by the said ministers before their departure from his the saide Toones house, and that M. Darrell did so farre preuaile therein, as hee did not onely perswade them, that the boy was possessed, but resolued with them of a fast to bee had at Burton for his dispossession: which resolution was altered vpon a very light accident.
(sayeth Iesse Bee) M. Hildersham, M. Darrell, and diuers other Ministers (hauing kept an exercise that day at Burton,) came vnto Thomas Darling: vnto whom M. Hildersham vsed some short godly speeches, the rest being altogether silent, and not offering eyther then, or afterwardes to speake to the boye.
At this time, as it should seeme, the ministers had resolued to haue helde a fast at Burton, for the recouerie of the boy: but they altred that their determination (as haue beene enformed eyther by goodwife Toone, or by mine owne wife,) for that (as the Ministers thought) one being present, when they were with the boy, did laugh at them, wherein they were deceyued, the cause of the laughter being this.
Whilest M. Hyldersham was in his prayer, did set my knee vpon the leg of M. Hastinges Grisley, who thereupon smiling, willed me to remoue my knee, saying, that did hurt him.
And this was the laughter that hindred the saide fast, as was enformed.
Afterwardes Darlinges friendes hauing taken diuerse courses in the boyes behalfe, it was resolued that M. Darrell should be sent for, and accordingly at the request of M. Walkeden, M. Darrell himselfe confesseth he went to Caldwal, where the boye then lay.
Before whose comming thether there was (as it seemeth) great expectation, that he would worke wonders, as partly it may appeare by these wordes of Darling.
About three or foure dayes before M. Darrels comming, heard that one should come from Ashbye, as without doing mee any hurt should relieue me.
It is here also to be noted, that the saide Darling deposeth.
That although hee had heard it commonly supposed, that he was bewitched, and that the Witch herself had confessed as much: yet he did neuer thinke himselfe to be possessed with a wicked spirite, vntill M. Darrell had so affirmed to his Grandfather.
And true it is, that vpon the examination since of some of the boyes friends, touching his counterfeyting, so they might haue saide, that the boy was bewitched, and did not therefore dissemble those thinges hee did: for his possession or dispossession, that they would not stande vpon.
Being come to Caldwall, he no sooner saw the boy in a fitte, but presentlie he affirmed him to be possessed, as Thomas Darling hath deposed, and as he himselfe in effect hath confessed: sauing (that to set some little colour vppon the matter) hee sayeth (but vntruelie) that hee had first seene him haue three or foure fearefull fittes, before he so affirmed.
If hee had done so, yet the same had not beene any sufficient ground for that rash assertion, as it hath beene declared in the first booke and fift Chapter.
Now for the better perswasion of the boyes friendes, that he was possessed, and likewise that the boy might haue an example, (as it seemeth) to imitate, hee tolde them as hee was charged in his hearing of Katherine Wright: who hauing beene possessed, was troubled in such sort, as he the said Darling had bene troubled.
This Maister Darrell denyeth: but hereof the boy deposeth thus.
Maister Darrell tolde diuers in my hearing that were then present, of a certaine woman, whome he affirmed to haue bene possessed, and said: that she in the time of her possession had some such fit as had indured.
He also at the same time repeated (as he was charged) in the boyes hearing, what were the signes, both of possession, and dispossession, mentioned in the scriptures: whereby Darling might learne, what he was to acte and practise the next daye, when he was to be dispossessed.
These poyntes, M. Darrell also denyeth: But Darling deposeth thus vnto them: M. Darrell then also repeated vnto them the signes of possession mentioned in the scriptures: as foaming at the mouth, and some others: and in like manner, he also then tolde the signes of dispossession, as that the parties would lye as though they were dead, and some other signes he then named.
It being further obiected to M. Darrell, that then mouing the boyes friendes to haue a fast for his pretended dispossession: he tolde them, that that kinde of spirite was not cast out, but by prayer and fasting: thereby taking vpon him to discerne the nature of the spirite, which he pretended to be in the boye: He the said Darrell doth denye it.
Whereuppon, being pressed (out of the booke before mentioned, perused by himselfe) that hauing appointed the faste, and moued the parents of the boye, with the whole familie, to prepare themselues to that holy exercise of fasting, and prayer, he alledged (to put by all doubtes) the wordes of Christ: this kinde goeth not out, but by prayer and fasting: his answere is, That this point is not set downe truely in the saide booke, and that he is therein iniurted.
Againe, M. Darrell was charged, that hauing appointed the said fast to be held the next day, hee foretolde to those that were present in Darlings hearing, that they should see the diuell cast him into verie strange fits: and that they should heare the diuel speake in him, whereby the sayd boye might learne, that hee was to acte that day the fittes before mentioned: and hee the saide Darrell, procure to himselfe great credite, when all thinges should fall out as hee had prophecied.
Whereunto hee the saide Darrell aunswering, confesseth somewhat: but more is deposed.
told (saith hee) some of the companie aparte, that if the next daye in their exercise, they should see the boye almost continually vexed, (as said thought it would fall out,) then they should bee thereby further confirmed, that the boye was possessed, and incouraged to continue their exercise, &c.
But Darling himselfe hereof saith thus: Maister Darrell tolde my friendes in my hearing, that they shoulde see mee cast into verie strange fittes the next day, and namely (as remember) that they should heare the Diuell speake in mee: and willed them notwithstanding, that they should not bee discouraged: for (saith hee) when you shall see these things, his deliuerance is at hand.
And whereas the Booke heereof perused by himselfe, sayth, that hee foretolde them what interruptions were like to follow by the enemies rage: Hee sayth, that this poynt, as it is sette downe in the said printed booke, is not true.
When the pretended fast for Thomas Darlings dispossession beganne, there are onelie named foure persons (besides the boye) to haue beene present: and when hee is sayde to haue beene dispossessed, there were but nine.
Besides, the boye is noted in the treatise penned by Iesse Bee, to haue had eighteene or nineteene sore fittes that daye.
Furthermore, whereas there was no Minister to bee present at the sayde faste: Maister Darrell prescribed certaine prayers to bee read out of a Booke intituled the Enemie of securitie.
Againe, for ought that appeareth in the sayde Treatise, none read the Prayers appoynted in that Booke, but the boye himselfe: and commonlie after hee hadde read fiue or sixe woordes, hee fell into a fitte.
These poyntes considered, it being obiected to maister Darrell, that it is not likelie that the Diuell coulde bee dispossessed, by such almost priuate, slender, interrupted, and scambling prayers, assisted with the forbearing of one meale: hee the sayde Maister Darrell aunswereth thus: Howsoeuer the prayers articulated were interrupted, yet beleeue they were auaileable with the fasting that then was vsed.
Whereby it shoulde seeme, that the Diuell, wherewith the boye was possessed, was not anye of that kinde, whereof our Sauiour speaketh in the ninth of Marke, that was so harde to bee cast out, but rather such an one, as Thyraeus maketh mention of, that by going to the church, or by some little checke, might easilie bee
But peraduenture maister Darrell in his aunswere, hath further relation then to the fasting and prayer, that was vsed at Caldwall, where Darling was.
For in the said printed Booke, the Diuell forsooth, is made to haue vttered these wordes by the boyes tongue, in one of his fits.
Brother Glassap we cannot preuaile, his faith is so strong, and they fast and pray, and a preacher praieth as fast as they.
And by the preacher master Darrell saith (as elsewhere to another purpose it hath beene noted) that hee beleeueth he himselfe was intended and meant.
Besides, in the ende of the said booke, the pretended dispossessing of the boye, seemeth to be chiefely ascribed vnto M. Darrell: he had the chiefe commendation of it, insomuch, as when the seuen in Lancashire were to be dealt with, M. Dees Butler tolde M. Starkie what a fellowe this Darrell was, and what he had bene a meanes of, at Burton.
It being furthermore obiected as a fault to M. Darrell, in that hauing taken order for the saide faste, and being very earnestly intreated to be present the next daye at it, and knowing, that except he stayed, no Minister was likely to be there: Yet he woulde not be intreated, but made this answere, (as it is set downe in the said booke of his owne perusall) viz.
My assistance in prayer and fasting you shall haue: but not my presence: His answere hereunto is thus: Where it is expressed in the printed booke, that promised my assistance in prayer, and fasting: it is not true: Howbeit, being reexamined hereof, about three or foure monethes after, he made this answere, viz.
beleeue that said vnto them, that would not be vnmindefull of them, and of that which they had in hand, in my prayers.
But (saith he) being earnestly intreated for my presence at the faste, denyed the same, and that for these two reasons: viz. for auoyding the note of vaine glory, and that the people might through mine absence be kept from ascribing any speciall guift to me in casting out diuels.
In which his second reason it may be obserued: First, his conceite, that the diuell the next day would be cast out: then it appeareth that he had vsed great vauntes of the dispossession of Katherine Wright, or otherwise, why should he haue suspected any such thing by the people? Againe, if this were not a shifting reason, how came it to passe, that he was present at the dispossessing of the seuen in Lancashire: but especially of William Somers, when his name was almost at the highest? And touching his first reason of it being obiected vnto him, that the cogitation thereof, as the case then stood, could neuer haue entred into a man of a single harte, and that thereby it might be reckoned for a note of for any Minister to be present in such an action: his answere is, as followeth.
Albeit, it be not in it selfe a note of for a Minister to be present at the dispossessing of Sathan: Yet forasmuch as did feare, that some thought that did glory somewhat too much in the action of casting forth diuels: for mine owne parte, thought it woulde be a note of in me, to haue bene present at the faste of Darling.
At the time of this examination, hee had set downe parte of his former answere, thus: Yet, forasmuch as in mine owne experience, did finde that some thought that did glory too much, &c.
But afterwardes, vpon his repetition, he strooke out these wordes (I did finde in mine owne experience,) and in place of them, added these: did feare that some, &c. Howbeit, if he had bene so carefull to haue auoyded the note of (as he pretendeth,) he would neuer haue suffered the wordes before mentioned of the diuell, touching his praying, as fast as they did, that were with Darling, to haue passed his handes, for thereby he seemeth so greedy of some commendation, as rather then faile, he was contended to receiue it from Sathan.
V. Of Maister Darrells shiftes and absurdities, concerning the pretended dispossessing of Thomas Darling.
FOra&smuch as Maister Darrell holdeth this for one of his groundes, that the partie to be dispossessed by fasting and prayer, is more tormented that day, then at any time before (Sathan knowing that he hath but a short time in him) it being demaunded of him, the sayd Darrell, how it came to passe that Thomas Darlings fits did grow vpon the day of his pretended dispossession, to be lesse and lesse (as it is reported in the said booke which hee perused) this is his shifting answere: If his fits did grow lesse towards the end of the day, as the booke reporteth, can giue no reason of it, except it should bee that hee was possessed with two spirites, as the Booke doth seeme to insinuate, and then it might be (I thinke) that one being gone out, his fittes might be somewhat the lesse troublesome.
Maister Darrell (we see) is in this poynt ful of vncertainties: as whether it bee true that the Booke reporteth: if it bee true, hee can giue no reason of it, except the boye had two diuels in him: and then hee is furnished, relying vpon that which is written in the saide booke, in these words.
In the ende of one of his fits, about two of the clocke in the afternoone, he strained to cast with great vehemencie, and got vp some fleagme, and choller, at which time if hee were possessed with two spirits (as it is probable hee was,) one of them wente out of him.
Probable? it is more then probable, that these are more then palpable fooleryes, some peraduenture wil say, ridiculous cosenages.
But let vs see what became of the second diuell.
About sixe of the clocke saith the booke, the boy being in a fit, beganne to heaue and lift vehemently at his stomacke, and getting vp some fleagme and choller, hee saide, (poynting with his finger, and following with his eies) looke, looke, see you not the mouse that is gone out of my mouth? and so poynted after it vnto the furthest part of the parlour.
Hereof Maister Darrell being interrogate, sayth: beleeue that the spirite then left Darling, when getting vppe some fleagme and choller, he said, looke, look, see you not the mouse that is gone out of my mouth? And therein am the rather confirmed by mine owne experience, in that it hath bene so with others at the instant of thir dispossession.
It seemeth that Maister Darrell hath mette still with cholericke spirits, which are so hard of disgestion, as no maruaile if his patients from time to time, haue strained themselues to vomit.
But vppon occasion of his saide answere, it beeing demaunded of him howe it came to passe, (if hee the said Darling was dispossessed, when the mouse went from him) that hee did not giue GOD thankes for his deliuerance, till about an houre after, as the Booke dooth reporte, hee sayth thus: Although beleeue that Satan wente out of the boye, when hee sayde: Looke, where the Mouse goeth, yet will not define it, because it may bee, that hee continued longer in him: and for his thankesgiuing, beleeue that hee did then giue thankes to God, when the spirit of God moued him therunto.
This fellow, his faith is as it seemeth, of a strange quality, that can beleeue the diuel was gone, when for ought hee knewe, he might remaine still in him.
Besides, it was vsuall with Darling to giue God thanks presently, at the end of euery fit, (Sathan remaining in him,) which maketh it the more strange, that being cast out of him he should remaine so vnthankefull by the space of an howre.
But the impostor will haue an answere for euery thing, be it neuer so vnlearned or foolish.
He, the said Darrel, being here further demaunded, how (he beleeuing that the boye was dispossessed, when the saide mouse went forth of him) it came to passe, that an howre after, he had (as the Booke reporteth) two fits or trances more? this is his answere: can not giue the cause of it, but thinke that Sathan being without him, might cast him into the saide trances.
It had bin more probable, if he had said, that the boye was so weakened in strayning to get Sathan out of his stomacke, as it could not be chosen, but that he should afterwardes haue diuers sore pangs and gripes.
Moreouer, whereas it appeareth by the saide Booke, that Thomas Darling did not take himselfe to be (forsoth) possessed, nor his friendes that were present, vntill after his last trance: wherein these wordes were heard to proceede from him: viz.
My sonne, rise vp and walke: the euill spirit is gone from thee.
Forasmuch, as M. Darrell affirmeth, that the boye was dispossessed an howre before, when the mouse went from him, it was asked of him, who it was that vttered those wordes: and he answered in this sorte.
am fully perswaded, that the saide Wordes were not Darlings wordes: but were deliuered eyther by a wicked spirite, or by an holy Angel.
It is muche, that there should be such an affinitie betwixt the diuell, and holy Angels, as that they so hardly be distinguished.
But it was well, that he rather inclineth to the holy Angel: for otherwise it might haue bin suspected, that his patient had bin the childe of Sathan: in that the voyce saide: My sonne, rise vp and walke.
If M. Darrell had considered better of the saide Booke when he perused it, he would haue preuented the occasions of these shifts.
For the incountering whereof, wee finde nothing in the premisses of any certainety but within.
Here is nothing but, within him: without him: belieue am the rather confirmed: it may be: cannot giue the cause of it: wil not define eyther this or that, rather incline: If a man had beene hyred of purpose, to haue marred a good matter, hee could not haue managed it possiblie worse: so skilfull a Catte is Maister Darrell in hunting after Darlinges mouse.
Againe, M. Darrell is of opinion, that the onely certaine meanes of discerning one to bee possessed, are the signes mentioned in the scriptures, vz. the crying of the spirite, his renting sore of the partie, and the saide parties lying as if he were dead.
which signes because they are not mentioned in the said book, and for that M. Darrell himselfe was not present to see, whether the said signes did appeare in the boy or not, vpon the day of the fast, it was demanded of him how he knew, or is yet assured, that he the said boy was then, or is yet dispossessed? and thus hee answereth.
am fully perswaded that the signes of possession appeared in the boy that day, and verily think, in that the said signes of dispossession are not mentioned in the saide Booke, it did proceed from the gnorance of those that were present, or of the penner of it, or of both.
And being afterwardes further interrogated: vppon what grounde his saide full perswasion was builte: hee aunswereth: the reasons that moue mee to thinke that the saide signes were shewed, vz. all three, or at the leaste one of them is, for that am fully perswaded, that Darling is dispossessed.
First, by his continuance so long well: Secondlie, by his sensible perceyuing of the egresse of Sathan in the likenesse of a mouse, and by his very cherefull and hartie thankesgiuing to God for his deliuerance.
Note by the way, that one of these signes is sufficient to shewe one to be dispossessed: If the partie doe but crye: M. Darrell can discerne that the diuell is departed.
It was here further obiected to M. Darrell: that Darlings continuance so long well, could be no certaine argument vnto him the said Darrel, that the boye is yet dispossessed, considering how hee helde: that Sathan may lurke in one that is possessed, without making signes of his being in him for a long time: as hee hath oft affirmed of William Somers.
And hereunto, he shapeth an answere in these wordes: Sathan is contented to lye hid, whilest according to his desire, it goeth with the partie and others, that doe not acknowledge the worke of God in their saide parties dispossession: but doe denye and gainesay the same: but in asmuch as it falleth out otherwise in Darlings case, he iustifying the worke of God in his owne deliuerance, and praysing him for the same, and others likewise praysing God for that worke of his, and indeuoring to profite by i: it cannot be, but if Sathan were in Darling, he would shewe himselfe in vexing of him.
You may remember what hath bene noted of these kindes of iuglers in the last chapter of the first booke: how by their owne rules, they seeke to preuent the detection of their cosenages: Somers being dispossessed (as it was pretended) in Nouember
and hauing now continued well aboue a yeare and a halfe, yet forsooth Sathan lyeth lurking in him, because he hath confessed his dissimulation.
Nay, here wee see that Darlinges friends maintaining that he was dispossessed, is made an argument that Sathan doth not lurke in him.
Howbeit if Darling were at all possessed, it is very likely, for ought that hetherto M. Darrell hath said, that so he continueth still: for hee is neither certaine when Sathan departed from him, nor hath any assurance, otherwise then by coniecture, that there appeared vpon the day of the saide faste, so much as the signes of his dispossession.
Of M. Darrels further practises with Darling to pretend, that Sathan sought to reenter into him, and of some other his vntrue assertions, concerning the boyes fittes, and of his cunning dealing likewise with him, that he should neuer confesse his dissimulation.
THe third or fourth day after the pretended dispossession of Darling, (hee the saide Darling remayning very wel without anie shew of trouble) M. Darrel came to the place of his aboad: and after some other communication, entred cunninglie into speech with him, concerning one of his slender grounds, vz. how it was the custom of Sathan when he had beene cast out of any, to seek by all his skill, that he might againe reenter: and thereunto added, that for a certainty, he would so deale with him, the said Darling.
The monday after the dispossessing of Darling, came vnto him, told him apart out of the xii. of S. Mat. that the deuill would seeke to repossesse him: and therefore counselled him to watch ouer himselfe, and to resist him.
If he had put no such thing into the boyes head, he had neuer dreamed of any such matter.
Againe, for the boyes further instruction (as it may be iudged), when M. Darrell had beaten it into him, that the deuill would seeke to repossesse him, he added (as he was charged) that peraduenture in so doing he would appear vnto him in the likenes of a friend, and vse all the meanes hee could deuise to perswade him to some euill, that so he might catch him and reenter.
This M. Darrel denyeth: but Darling deposeth it in these wordes.
M. Darrell comming vnto me saide, that peraduenture the Deuill, in seeking to reenter into me, would appeare in the likenes of a friend, and vse all the meanes he could to perswade me to some euill.
And about seauen or eight dayes after these speeches of Maister Darrell, thus vsed vnto him: hee the saide Darling hauing continued perfectlie wel in the mean time, and being then at the schoole, did fall newly againe into his former course, and pretended himselfe to haue that day and the next, seauenteene or eightteene fits, as perceyuing by M. Darrell, that if he meant not to be reckoned a dissembler, in that hee had done before, hee must also pretend that the deuill was seeking to repossesse him.
Vpon the second day, after the vndertaking of this new dissimulation: Sathan so withstoode, (as the saide booke pretendeth) by the strength of the boyes faith, that hee durst assaile him no longer: insomuch, as a voice was then heard, but vttered with his tongue, saying: the Lorde thy God hath tyed thy enemies fast in a chayne: vnlesse thou fall againe, hee shall neuer attempt thee: and thereuppon the Boye (as the Booke reporteth), was well both in minde and body, and so hath euer since remayned.
This was a quicke dispatch: too hastie a great deale, if that which the book sayeth be true.
For although Darrel affirmeth: that he verilie belieueth, that the said Darling was neuer repossessed: yet there it is said, that the first night of his pretending that Sathan was seeking to reenter into him, a voice was heard from him as vttered by the Deuill, and saying: he fell, and caught him.
And also the next morning, the like words in effect are reported to haue beene vttered, as in the person of God: thou didst fal, and he caught thee.
Besides his friendes supposing (as it seemeth by the booke) that the deuill had caught him againe: they fell againe to their prayers, for the remouing of that heauie displeasure of God.
And there appeareth nothing in the printed booke, whereby it might be denied, that he is not stil repossessed: but the said words pretended to be spoken by the Doue, viz. the Lord thy God hath tyed thy enemie fast in a chaine: which wordes M. Darrell ascribed to the Deuill, Moreouer, Iesse Bee comming from London, and finding the boy in these kinds of fits, saith thereof thus: verily thought, that he was as much possessed then, as he was before, still see no reason why should thinke otherwise.
In deede therein he saith truely: for a dissembling knauish boy hee was before, and so he then shewed himselfe, by the cunning instruction of that Impostor his maister: to whome he was not yet so much beholden, in that he allowed such things in the said booke, as doth argue as much the certaintie of his repossession, as of any thing els that therein is reported.
Furthermore, whereas M. Darrell did neuer see Darling in any fitte but once, and cannot say much of the manner of his pretended trouble, but by hearesay: yet he is confident, that in all his fittes, as well before his supposed dispossessio~, as in those that followed after: he the said Darling was altogether sencelesse, hauing neither memory, nor vnderstanding of any thing he either the~ did or spake.
It shal not be needfull to repeate his words, because he affirmeth as much of all that haue come vnder his handes: it being one of his false generall groundes, whereuppon the chiefe parte of his iugling consisteth.
The vntruth whereof (as it hath beene shewed in the discourse of his dealing with Somers so will it most manifestly appeare in the actions and proceedings of Darling: as they are set out in the said booke, that he himselfe approued to bee fit for the presse, to bee published: and as the boy himselfe hath confessed, and some also haue deposed.
Aboue sixe weekes after the boy beganne his trickes, he had vpon the fifteenth of Aprill, three seuerall fittes in effect together: wherein he had a Dialogue or discourse (as is pretended) with Sathan: which fittes being ended, the booke reporteth thus: He told them that stood by, that if Sathan came againe, he would aske him many questions, and charge him with many things: for he reme~bred what he had spoke~ as well as any that was present.
Likewise after some other dialogues had with Sathan by the boy, as it is pretended, M. Eccarshal Parson of Burton perswaded him (as the book saith) that if Sathan spake to him againe, hee should not answere him.
Whereupon, he being ouerthrowne into foure seuerall fits, one after another, (the last whereof was most intollerable) it seemed by the boyes lookes and gestures, that the euill spirit spake: but because of M. Eccarshals aduise, he kept a discontented silence, as afterwards he told his mother.
Againe, the said booke proceedeth to diuers other particulars which doe ensue: when in his fittes he was depriued of the vse of speech, he would make signes of praying with folded hands: sometimes lifting them vppe, and sometimes striking them vppon his breast.
And being asked if hee could remember what he did, when he made such signes, he answered, that sometimes he prayed.
Againe, being asked at the end of one of his fits, wherein he did scritch pittifully, the reason thereof: he answered: that the paine which he endured was very grieuous, like the pricking with daggers, or stinging with Bees, which caused his crying.
Againe, after an other fit, hee was asked what he saw: he answered, a greene Catte: and then, oh (quoth he) this hath beene a grieuous torment vnto me.
Likewise at the end of an other fit, he said, that a thing spake vnto him with a voice small and shrill: Againe, being asked what he had seene in some other conflictes: hee answered, many and fearefull things, and called to mind a thing that spake to him.
The same question being also demanded of him after an other fit: he said, a great Beare came roaring vpon him: Againe in his extreamitie, he made signes to the standers by to pray: and himselfe by folded hands and other gestures, gaue testimonie, that the spirit of God was mightily labouring against his infirmities, &c. he said, pray, pray, &c. he desired the standers by to sing the sixt Psalme: and so they did, he singing with them very cheerefully &c. he sweat exceedingly dryed his face, as though he had not beene in a fit.
Diuers other things in the said booke to this effect are here omitted: these being sufficient to controll M. Darrels folly, he himselfe iustifying so confidently the booke to be true.
But if they will not serue him, let Darling himselfe be heard.
In all those Dialogues (saith the boy) wherein did as it were dispute and answere Sathan, thinke had my memorie, as had the vse of my tongue.
Againe, confesse, that in all my fittes generally, felt my selfe to be inwardly sore tormented and troubled: and as they asked me when my sit was done, of the torments and griefe had indured: so told them more or lesse how was troubled.
And Iesse Bee, the authour of the said booke deposeth: that he verily thinketh the boies sits were meere illusions: that the boy was very willing to fall into his fittes, because thereby he might shew the graces of God in himselfe, by resisting of Sathan, as he did in some of his Dialogues with the Deuill: that he thinketh that Darling, being well, did know he should haue the vse of his memory, when he fell into his fits: that hee might haue auoided many of his said fits, if he had listed: that he did of himselfe willingly cast himselfe into some fits, when the deuill did not inforce him thereunto: that he did willingly so cast himselfe into diuers fits of purpose, that when the word of God was read, those who were present might thereby the better bee brought to thinke that the deuil could not abide itÂ· so haue a more due and godly regard afterwardes of it.
And further (saith the said Iesse Bee confesse that finding Darling so willing to cast himselfe into his fittes, did also often reade vnto him for the same cause (last before mentioned) and vsed the wordes as they are in the booke, of prouoking him to battaile with Sathan: for thereby well perceiued, that diuers that were present, and had beene before of prophane life, were very much terrified, and haue euer since much more regarded the word of God.
Besides, my practise was, when at the reading of the worde of God, Darling did seeme to the beholders, to haue beene cast into a fitte by Sathan, then to desire those which were present carefully to marke what force the word of God had.
And againe: as saw occasion, by reason of some licentious persons then present, and was thereupon willing that Darling should fall into any fit: in reading would giue some verse that thought to contain substantiall matter, an especiall twinge: that is, read it more earnestly, and with a sharpe voyce: and then presently the boy would fall into a fitte.
This course he confesseth hee held with the boy, whilest he the said Darling continued at Burton.
And the chiefe matters of the booke penned by him, doe containe the great wonders that were wrought in those fittes, to set out (forsooth) the force and power of the word of God.
By reason of sundry the testimonies before mentioned, some other crosse interrogatories ministred to M. Darrell touching this point, hee was driuen greatly to the wall, by mincing the matter after this seely sort.
belieue (saith he) that Thomas Darling had not his sences or memorie in his fittes: but thinke that Sathan might so order the matter, as that hee eyther had, or might haue had his sences in his said fittes.
The reason why thinke he had not his sences or memory, is for that in my experience haue seene it so in others.
But concerning Thomas Darling, haue no certaine knowledge, whether he was alwaies without his sences in his fittes, because haue not searched nor inquired into it.
And thus hauing oftentimes resolutely affirmed at Nottingham, and in sundrie of his examinations: that the boy of Burton was senceles as well in such fits as hee had before his pretended dispossession, as also in the other whilest Sathan was seeking his reentrance: Now he confesseth, that he neuer searched nor inquired into that point, to know the truth: and besides shaketh his false ground in that behalfe, in that he saith: that sathan may so order the matter, as those who are possessed may haue their sences in their fits.
Moreouer, as M. Darrel hath presumptuously falsely affirmed, that Darling was senceles in all his fits: so hath he as grossely and gracelessely maintained, that whatsoeuer hee the said Darling seemed to doe or speake in any of his said fits, it was not he but sathan, that both did it, spake it.
And thus hee saith particularly of certaine dialogues (where it seemeth that sometimes Sathan, sometimes the boy should speake): thinke (saith he) that it was sathan onely that vsed the wordes in those dialogues mentioned in the said booke: he the said Sathan transforming himselfe into an Angel of light, at such times whe~ he seemed to speak godlily.
And in an other place speaking of Darling others he saith: that the deuill at such times did vse their members and parts of their bodies, without their knowledge or vnderstanding.
For the disproofe of which bold vntruths, that which hath beene set downe of the boyes sences, vnderstanding, knowledge memorie, is very material, and much more may be added.
Thomas Darling, who should be the fittest iudge in this matter deposeth thus: do not belieue that what did or spake in my fits, was done or spoken alwaies by sathan: for that diuers thinges were vttered spoken by mee through the assistance of Gods spirit, in the time of my fits.
And againe, as know at this present for a certainty, that haue the spirit of God within mee: so do with the like certaintie belieue, that in my dialogues with Sathan, when alleadged sundry places of scripture, to withstand the temptations he assaulted we with: had the spirit of God in me, and by that spirit resisted Sathan at those times, by alleadging the scriptures to confound him.
True it is, that hee the said Darling (about a moneth, or
weeks after his depositions last mentioned) hauing learned as it seemeth, that M. Darrel was peremptory, that it was the deuil who vttered all the words in the said dialogues: being again vpon occasion examined touching that point, he deposeth in another sort. viz.
beleeue (saith hee) that Sathan did speake and vtter such Godly speeches, as were vsed in those dialogues, that they were not spoken by me, through any assistance of Gods spirit.
This contrarietie doth arise from the boyes affection to Darrel, being so bewitched with a false opinion of his holines, as he supposeth he may say or do any thing that he would haue him.
As for a further example; He the said Darling, being asked whether if M. Darell and the rest of his adherents should now say, that they tooke all his former fits to be fooleries deceits, that they think he was not possessed, he wold not now think that he was not possessed: His answer is thus: Yes would think that was not at all possessed.
Againe, being asked whether if M. Darrel the rest of his fellowes should then at that very instant: tell him that he had fits, and that he were at that instant possessed, he would at the same instant thinke he were possessed: he said yes: would so belieue and thinke.
The said Iesse Bee vnderstanding what Darling had lastly deposed, of the deuils vttering all that was spoken in the said Dialogues: and that it would thereby follow that the deuill moued the standers by to pray and sing psalmes, as it is in one of the said dialogues, and that he diuers others, when they did sing pray accordingly, did therein accompany Sathan, and not Thomas Darling: saith vpon his examination touching this point.
doe verily belieue, that whosoeuer affirmeth, that it was the deuill that moued vs then to pray and sing Psalmes, he saith not truely, but doth lie in so affirming.
Againe, both and the rest of the boyes friendes (as belieue) did verily thinke and were perswaded, that when Thomas Darling did seeme to vse the godly speeches mentioned in the DialoguesÂ· he himselfe did vse them, being directed by the spirit of God: neither did we once imagine or suspect, that the said speeches were vttered by Sathan: and do still belieue, that they were vttered by the assistance of Gods spirit, and not in any sort by the deuill.
And againe, if it bee held for a certaine ground, that whosoeuer is possessed, is so far in Sathans bondage whilest he is in his fittes, as that whatsoeuer he saith it is not he, but Sathan that speaketh it: do then fully belieue that Thobas Darling was not possessed, and that he saith vntruely, if hee affirme that he was possessed.
Furthermore, wheras it appeareth by the said book, that Th. Darling all his friends were of opinion, that all the godly speeches in shew therein mentioned, to haue beene vttered by the boy in his fits, were spoken by him the said Darling through the assistance of Gods spirite: and that likewise the principall scope of the booke doeth tend to the magnifying of the boyes faith, and his wonderfull constancie in his combats with Sathan: M. Darrell being demaunded why he suffered the sayde booke to passe his hands with that great error, considering his owne iudgement, that all those things and speeches, which the boyes friendes reioyced in, proceeded from Satan: hee the said Darrell aunswereth thus: do thinke that the boy, the Author of the Booke, and the boyes friendes, were of such mind and opinion as is here mentioned: and for the Booke, suffered it to passe to the presse, hauing read it ouer at that time cursorilie: and was then of opinion, that a great part of the speeches mentioned in the said dialogues, were vttered by the assistance of Gods spirit, or by the ministrie of an holie Angell.
Howbeit, since vppon better aduisement, as thinke, am perswaded that all the said speeches were vttered by Sathan transforming himselfe into an Angell of light.
If any man will take the paines to peruse those speeches, which Iesse Bee hath fathered vpo~ the boy in the said dialogues: he shal find them to be such, as will hardly be found againe in any story (that euer was written) to be ascribed to sathan.
But peraduenture M. Darrel may haue some conceit: that the boy being supposed to haue two deuils in him, one of the~ had finished the time of his torments, and so was become a faithfull spirit, ready to be translated from hell into heauen, as some in that behalfe haue moralized.
Lastly, it is to be obserued, that Darling after he had continued a while in his first pretended fits, many supposed gaue it out, that he was but a dissembler, as it may appeare by the depositions following.
Whilest Darling was troubled, saith Iesse Bee) many did thinke and affirme it, that he dissembled: one of their reasons was, for that he did pretend that the deuil spake vnto him, when none els did heare him that were present: at which times they heard Thomas Darling pretend as though he answered him.
And Edward Baker: belieue (saith hee) that the boy did dissemble, and vsing these wordes to his mother: pray God he doe not dissemble: she said, that had no faith.
This opinion of the boyes counterfeyting being held by many, it was feared (as it seemeth) least he should be induced by some meanes, at one time or other to confesse his dissimulation, and therupon some of his friendes did encourage him to take heede thereof, and to continue constant in affirming, that he had beene possessed, and was dispossessed.
Some thing to this purpose Darling acknowledgeth in these wordes.
confesse that since the time of my supposed dispossession, my vnckle Toone tolde me, that although it should be saide, that had but dissembled: yet should not be discouraged by their wordes.
And M. Darrell being charged, that since the time of the pretended dispossession of Darling, hee had cherished, entertayned and lodged the boy at his house: and that least his owne packing and dissimulation might happen to be detected aswell as the boyes: hee did vse this, or the like perswasion in effect vnto him: vz. that hee shoulde continue constant, and not suffer himselfe by any allurement to be drawne to say, that hee had dissembled in his former fittes, and that he was neuer possessed with any wicked spirite.
And his answere is thus: One night entertayned the saide Darling in my house at Ashbye: and the rest he denyeth: but Darling himselfe hath deposed it.
haue beene with M. Darrell (saieth he) diuerse times, sometimes at Burton, once at Apleby, once at Packington at seuerall exercises: from whence went home with M. Darrell to Ashby, and supped that night with M. Hyldersham, M. Darrell, two other Ministers, and Mrs. Ireton, at M. Hyldershams house, and did lye that night at M. Darrels.
Also confesse that Maister Darrell hath had some communication with mee, and hath willed me at some times that should bee constant, and sticke to the truth, meaning, that should not suffer my selfe to bee drawne to affirme that was not possessed: but that had dissembled in all my saide fittes; and so consequentlie, that God had not deliuered me from the possession of Sathan.
THomas Darling being sent for by vertue of her Maiesties Commission for causes ecclesiasticall: was examined, concerning his pretended possession, and dispossession, and afterwardes againe was dismissed.
Of which dismission, the author of the briefe Narration sayeth thus.
When they perceyued that the power of God in the boy, was stronger then the malice of Sathan, they let him goe.
His meaning is, that the boy could not bee remoued from iustifying his own, and Maister Darrels proceedings with him.
It may please you therefore to consider, what the boye deposed, before hee went.
Inprimis, (sayeth hee) doe voluntarily of myselfe confesse, that whatsoeuer Maister Darrel did say about my supposed possession, or about prayer for my dispossession, or about my fittes before or after my dispossession: did all eyther of ignorance, or to gette my selfe a glorie thereby.
Item confesse that verily thinke, that if may speake with M. Darrell, can perswade him neuer to take any more such courses, nor to take vppon him any such power, to be able to cast out a deuil.
Item confesse, as that think, if my Lord will deale fauourably with Maister Darrell, and bee good Lord vnto him, hee will of himselfe confesse the truth, vz. that hee did thinke mee neuer to haue beene possessed, and that hee will promise neuer to enter into any such practise againe.
Item confesse, that felt indeede at first some prickings in my legges: and that at the first vomited, and was somewhat euill at ease: but as for all and singuler the fittes mentioned in the Booke, and the dialogues with Sathan, viz. my saying of sentences out of the scriptures to Sathan, his supposed saying to mee, as also all those supposed apparitions of a Catte, a Dragon, a Bear, Lightnings, Thundring, a Lambe, a Doue, a Woman, and so of all the seuerall visions and torments sette downe in the printed booke, confesse they bee all vntrueths, and no credite to be giuen to them, or any of them.
And again: the speciall occasion hee sayth, that first drew him on more apparantly to the sayde fictions, was this conceite put into his heade: that the Deuill coulde not abide the worde of God: that therefore when the worde of God was read, hee did willingly at the hearing of some especiall pointes, cast himselfe into many fittes: that in the same hee vsed sondrie godlie speeches: that the thereuppon obserued the power of the worde: and that hauing little discretion, partlie for his owne praise, and partlie because hee thought the worde of God thereby would bee better reuerenced, hee did proceede in his dissimulaton, as in the saide booke is more at larged expressed.
Being then further asked, why after his pretended dispossession, hee fell againe to his former course: his aunswere is: that hauing hearde of Maister Darrel, that Sathan was accustomed to seeke to reenter into those, out of whome hee had beene cast: hee thought it meete for the better crediting of his former dealing, to take vppon him, as though Sathan had sought to haue againe repossessed him.
Much more he hath set downe to the effect specified, and hath thus subscribed vnto it with his owne hand.
This my confession being read ouer by the L. Bishop of London in my hearing, doe acknowledge to be true, and this doe affirme without feare or constraint, very willinglie, by the vertue of my oath taken to deliuer the truth in those pointes, whereof should be examined concerning my pretended possession.
Howbeit, true it is, that within a fortnight after he was set at libertie, and had conferred with M. Darrell in the Gatehouse, and with some others, he writ a letter to the Bishop of London: affirming that he had beene drawne on by subtilties to make the said confession: and addeth these wordes: what is all this to the purpose? If of frailtie should say, that all was dissembling, was it therefore? If say that this paper is blacke, is it so therefore? Those articles which was sworne vnto before, will stand vnto them, and iustifie them: but concerning the other, will neuer consent vnto them: It must bee euen as the apte scholler of M. Darrels liste: a more proude and desperate forsworne boy, hath not lightly fallen into any mans examination.
His answeres, that he sayeth he will iustifie, are those which haue beene mentioned in the former Chapter: which are in effect as much as is included in this his aforesaide voluntarie confession.
And this may suffice touching this matter, aswell of the boye of Burtons dissimulation, as of M. Darrels practises with him.
breefe of Katherine Wrights confession, touching the beginning of her dissimulation, and of the reasons that mooued her so to do.
THe first beginning of M. Darrels glorie, did proceede from his practises with Katherine Wright: and hee hath enioyed the fruit therof, now about thirteen or foureteene yeares.
The generall cause it selfe, touching the late attempts of casting out diuelies, is of great importance: otherwise it is not vsual, that matters so long past should bee searched into.
Neither had this beene dealt with, but that Master Darrell hath in all his practises, with the rest of his Demoniackes, still insisted vppon his experience in the pretended dispossessing of this poore woman.
Shee therefore, the saide Katherine Wright, being examined, confesseth vppon her oath, that which will not please Maister Darrell.
For she saith: That in all the course of her pretended possession and dispossession, and of her fits both before and since, whatsoeuer she did that seemde to be extraordinary, it was all dissembled.
And yeelding some reasons of the beginning of this her dissimulation, shee sayth, That her father in law one Iohn Mekin, did for sundry yeares vse her hardly, in beating and brusing of her verie sore, that shee grewe therewith to some weakenesse, and for wante of sleepe to bee that being in this case, and going one morning for water to a well, she imagined she saw a childe without feete, and that being therewith greatly afraide, she beganne to be more and more troubled in her fancie, supposing that shee saw diuers shapes and apparitions.
Furthermore, he affirmeth, that about the time of her foresaid weaknesse (she being then about the age of seuenteene yeares) shee beganne to be troubled with a kinde of swelling in her body, occasioned (as since shee hath learned) by some stopping of humours, not vnknowne to diuers women: that vpon signification vnto her father in law, to her mother of her foresaid sight of the feetelesse childe, and what shapes shee saw at sundrie times, and also in respect of her said swelling, he her sayd father in law made much of her: that she finding this alteration in her said fathers vsage towardes her, thereuppon grew to bee indifferently well, sauing that her sayde swelling would often rise, yet she did still pretende to bee troubled with her former kinde of fancies and apparitions, and in her fits of swelling, did voluntarily make her selfe to seeme worse then indeede she was by scriching, casting her armes abroade, starting vp sodainely from the place where shee sate, and sometimes by falling downe, as though she had swouned.
And this course shee confesseth, she hath helde from the time shee began it, vntill the time almost of this her examination, viz. about thirteene or foureteene yeares: partly because shee was by that occasion much made of, and for that shee feared, that if she had shewed her selfe to haue beene perfectly well for any long season, her father in lawe would haue fallen to his former hard vsage of her.
But when shee was examined, she professed, That thenceforth shee would become a new woman, and leaue all her former dissimulation.
Of Maister Darrels proceedings with Katherine VVright, for her pretended dispossession.
IT seemeth that after K. VVright had continued a while in her aforesaid dissimulatio~, a bruite thereof was spread abroad, and diuers came to see her.
Amongst whom, one master Beresford resorting to her, and being mooued in compassion towardes her, tooke her away from her fathers, carried her home to his own house, because, (as hee sayth) her sayde fathers house was no fitte place to giue entertainement, to any that should come to helpe her.
At maister Beresfords house shee continued about a moneth, and then (as hee sayth) hee sent her to Mansfielde, to be comforted or cured of her infirmitie, because he had heard maister Beckingham to be a man of note, and maister Darrel, dwelling then in Mansfield, a man of hope, for the releeuing of those which were distressed in that sort.
At this time maister Darrell was not aboue three or foure and twenty yeares old: but yong it pricketh that will bee a thorne.
The sayd Katherine VVright comming to Mansfielde vppon the Thursday, Maister Darrell had dispatcht the diuell out of her, by the Saturday at noone next following, and in this maner, as he himselfe confesseth.
Vppon the Saturday in the morning, M. Darrell accompanied with his own wife, the goodman of the house, named Edward Loades, the rest he remembreth not, vndertook this worke.
He began (hee sayth) to pray about foure of the clock in the morning, continued in a maner til about twelue, at what time she was deliuered.
The praiers which he vsed, page duplicate] page duplicate] were partly described, and partly conceiued by himself.
One of the prescribed prayers, he read out of the booke intituled The enemie of ecuritie.
Being heere demaunded whether the fiue his associats did continue with him all the while that he praied, he answered thus: It is likely that some did stay with me all the while, and that some of the family, viz. the housholders, did not continue theirs al the while without departure, as haply not being so deuout, that they would forbeare all worldly businesse to attend that holy exercise.
By which his answere, it is likely, that the whole burthen for Katherine Wrights dispossession, did relie vpon the shoulders of M. Darrell and his wife.
diuell could not well be cast out with lesse trouble, if this had beene all: but there was another engine vsed, as Katherine Wright hath deposed in these wordes.
One fashion of Maister Darrell in my pretended dispossession at Mansfield, was to lie vppon my belly, saying that he would by so lying, presse the diuell out of me.
When this strange fashion was obiected to Maister Darrell: Ah (quoth hee) looked for this, and then framed his answer vnto it in this sort: hauing read in the scriptures, how Elias and Saint Paule did stretch themselues along on some that were dead, in their recouerie to life, and being a yong student in diuinitie, not past foure or
yeares of age, did in a blinde zeale (as thinke) lie vppon the saide Katherine Wright as it is obiected.
Afterwards this his said answere being repeated (as the manner is,) he did thus amend it. viz.
did lie vpon the said Katherine Wright, but not vpon her bellie, as beleeue.
This his qualification being allowed of, hee desired about three daies after, a second reuiewÂ· then for the discharge of his conscience (as hee saide) in deliuering the trueth, hee setle downe his minde in this sort: Whereas, being examined vppon the sodaine of a fact doone twelue yeares past, haue said that did the same, as there it is expressed in a blinde zeale, meaning a foolish and indiscreete imitation of the Prophet and the Apostle: do now protest, that hauing called my selfe better to minde, by conferring with my wife, (who was then present) and by better deliberation vppon the same, that verilie beleeue, did not the saide fact, to the ende there specified: loth for that neuer dreamed at that time of working any myracle, neyther did looke for her deliuerance from Sathan: but shee being at that time verie vnrulie, did it to keepe her downe, there being also at that time, another vpon some part of her, and vpon me, that we might the rather keepe her downe.
And thus at the length you haue his perfect answere: wherein it is to be feared, that he hath made bolde with his oath.
For whereas at the third time, hee saith he was taken vpon the sodaine, when he made his first answere, that seemeth not to bee true, for that his said lying vpon her was no sooner mentioned vnto him, but he affirmed that hee looked for it, and had two examples readie for his excuse therein.
But the cheefe matter hee feared, that would haue beene inferred of his first answere, was this, viz. that thereby it would haue beene collected, he had a purpose to haue wrought a myracle, which he (forsooth) by no meanes can indure to heare of.
You may tearme his casting out of diuels, a strange, a wonderfull, and a myraculous worke (as his friendes haue done in their writings, with his good liking) but not a myracle.
Furthermore, as touching the effecting of this myraculous woorke, maister Darrell affirmeth, that although he inclined to thinke, that Katherine Wright was possessed when he tooke her in hand: yet hee was not fully perswaded of it, till after her dispossession.
Howebeit, Katherine Wright sayth thus: Maister Darrell as soone as hee sawe wee, saide hee was of opinion, that was possessed of a diuell, but master Beckingham thought otherwise: and master Darrell was the first that euer heard say, that had any diuell in me.
But vppon his own said speeches, he being demanded why he continued so long in praier vpon the Saturday, being not fully perswaded that she was possessed, he answereth after this maner.
was then fully perswaded that she was vexed with Sathan, eyther within or without her, and knowing that faythfull prayer is the best meanes to withstande sathan, &c.
did ioyne and continue in prayer so long with her.
But being here interrogated, that forasmuch as praiers must be made without wauering, whether hee had not hope by his prayer, to deliuer her from Sathans molestation, whilst hee continued therein so long: do not thinke (sayth he) am bound to aunswere hereunto.
So as here was a diuell cast out by chaunce.
Maister Darrell meant somewhat that sathan could not indure, and therefore hee departed.
Moreouer, forasmuch as Maister Darrel holdeth that Christ did ordaine fasting and prayer to be the ordinarie means to continue in the Church for casting out diuels: and that the dutie of the partie to be dispossessed, is to dispose himselfe before to prayer and fasting, and to performe the same if sathan do not hinder him: hee being againe demanded, why he did not appoynt a fast, as wel as vse prayer for the dispossessing of Katharine Wright, this is his aunswere: was not then of the opinion mentioned, and as nowe am, and therefore did but onely vse prayer.
But whether my self purposed to fast, or aduised Katherine Wright so to do, doe not nowe remember: but beleeue that did not make mention of any fasting to the rest of the companie.
This is a loose shift if it bee looked into.
For if hee were not then of the sayde opinion, why doth he forget why hee purposed to fast or not? hee would not bee thought at that time, to haue had anie needelesse purpose.
But bee it as hee list, yet there wee see, that Katherine Wright was dispossessed, but not by the ordinarie meanes that Christ hath appoynted: and so he must bee driuen to confesse that he wrought a myracle.
Againe, it beeing obiected to maister Darrell, by her maiesties Commissioners, that hee knowing the sayde Katherine VVright to dissemble in her pretended fits at Mansfield, had priuate co~ference with her, taught her how to order her selfe in the manner of her counterfeiting, wherby he incouraged her in that her lewd course: he doth denie it, but thereof Katherine VVright deposeth thus.
M. Darrell after his comming to mee at Mansfielde, did tell and teach mee alone, howe to vse and order my selfe in my fittes.
Likewise maister Darrell being charged to haue had priuate speech with Katherine VVright, before her pretended dispossession, and in the same to haue tolde her, that shee had sundrie diuels in her, that hee heard them speak, and one of them cal another by the name of Midlecub, and diuers other names, he answereth thus: with some others did heare from within her the saide Katherine VVright, (being in a trance) the morning of her dispossession, an intercourse of certaine speeches of which speeches, do not now remember any thing.
strange matter that diuels should talk togither in M. Darrels hearing, yet that their communication vpon his first acquaintance with him, should make no deeper impression in his memory.
Some others (he saith) heard the said speeches, meaning of likelihood his wife: for hauing but
with him, they of the houshold applying their worldly busines, many could not heare them.
M. Darr. told me once alone that had diuels in me: and said knew had none: but he told me yes, saying, that he heard them speake in mee: that were strange (quoth I) seeing my selfe do not heare them.
Why (quoth he) heard them cal themselues in thee, Midlecub, and other names which cannot remember.
Nowe least any should doubt how these diuels came into her, M. Darrell so contriued it, as they were sente thither by one Margaret Roper, a witch.
Hereof master Darrell sayth thus: When Katherine Wright came first to Mansfielde, demaunded of her when and how her fittes beganne she answered, that they began shortly after that she had denied to giue something vnto an olde woman, one Margaret Roper of Eckington.
Whereuppon (saith Iohn Meekin, the maides Father in law, Maister Darrell presently affirmed, that the saide Margaret was a witch, and had bewitched her.
Many other thinges happened no doubte betwixt maister Darrell and his patient, the first three daies before her pretended dipossession, but these are sufficient to shew, how beeing but a nouice in that trade, he bestirred himselfe in so short a time.
Againe, it being obiected to maister Darrell, that hee did falsely pretend the said Katherine Wright to be dispossessed, in that she departed from him, as she came to him, and continued presently afterwardes, when she was caried backe to maister Berisfords, to be as shee was before, he answereth thus: doe verilie beleeue that she was dispossessed, and that she continued well after, for the space of sixe or eight weekes: sauing that three or foure times, whilst shee was at Mansfield, the diuell seeking to reenter, did trouble her a little for some quarter of an houre, or an howre, whom she for that time did resst, and did assist her therein.
And whilst shee remained at maister Berisford, she was not troubled with any fit.
But Katherine Wright deposeth thus: remember that M. Darrell said he had cast a diuell out of me, notwithstanding that neither perceiued nor thought any such matter but was when parted from him in the verie same case, when that hee came to Mansfield: that is, was somewhat helde with my swelling, and the rest did willingly acte of my selfe.
remember that Maister Darrell brought Katherine Wright from Mansfielde to my house, and tolde me that hee had recouered her.
Howbeit, finding her shortly after to bee as euill as before, discharged my selfe of her, and sent her home to her brothers house at Whittington.
Maister Beresford tolde mee, that my Sister Katherine Wright hauing beene with one Maister Darrell, was not amended, and so willed mee to take her home with mee, which did accordingly.
Katherine Wright being returned to Maister Beresfords house, came vnto her, and carefully obserued to see what change was in her, and founde her after her woonted manner, according to her former fittes, nothing bettered by her beeing at Mansfield.
It is to be obserued that Katherine Wright went to Mansfielde about Easter, and remaining there a moneth, was carried backe againe to Maister Beresfords, and from thence to Thomas Wrights, about the Whitsontide after.
By which conference of the time, it appeareth directly, that maister Darrell is herein greatly deceiued, and that Katherine Wright was not at all in anie sort releeued by him.
Within a fortnight or three weekes (as it seemeth) after Katherine Wright was with her brother at Whittington, shee continuing her former practises, maister Darrell was againe sent for to come vnto her, by the direction of M. Beresford (as Thomas Wright affirmeth) and vppon his first sight of her he presently affirmed, that shee was repossessed.
As soone as came and saw her, affirmed to those that were present, that shee was againe repossessed, but am vncertaine whether so said when was in her presence.
If there were nothing els but this to charge M. Darrell with, yet were it sufficient to shew either his childish rashnes, or that he is an Impostor: it being impossible for any man vpon the sodaine to pronounce any to be repossessed, except hee had the guift of discerning of spirits, which M. More saith, is now abolished.
First he affirmed that she was in her fits altogether sencelesse: and that whatsoeuer she either did or spake, it was not she, but the Deuill in her that did both.
Which two pointes being obiected vnto him: he answereth thus: doe not belieue that affirmed her to bee in her fittes altogether sencelesse: but doubt it might bee that said, that whatsoeuer she either spake or did in her fittes, it was not shee but Sathan.
Whether hee said then she was sencelesse or not, it is not materiall: seeing hee hath so affirmed many hundreth times since: but how vntruely concerning them both, these depositions following will declare.
M. Darrel at his comming to me to Whittington, told the standers by that was senceles, notwithstanding that well knew euery one of my acquaintance there present, and heard him euery word what he said, and could answere readily directly to any that asked any questions of me.
It was M. Darrels maner (saith Th. Wright) to affirme that she was senceles, that it was the deuil in her that answered him: notwithstanding that both all others present (as thinke) iudged that she had the commandment of her owne sences, knew what she spake, because at all times she vnderstood any questions made vnto her, would answere roundly and aptly to the same.
At the time of her seconde pretended dispossession, and others did aske her in her fits some questions, which she answered sensiblie.
Furthermore, as touching the ordinarie meanes of casting out Deuils by fasting and prayer, according to M. Darrels owne rules, he being charged not to haue vsed the same, and yet after some interrupted praiers, to haue affirmed, that she the said Katherine Wright was againe dispossessed: he confesseth, that he so affirmed, and for the other point saith thus.
There was no fast appointed: but for my part did fast, and thinke did moue Katherine Wright to do the like.
How likely this is to be true (considering hee was not then of opinion, that fasting was necessarie in this case) may easily bee gessed.
The day of his owne pretended fast was vpon the Sunday: and thereof M. Beresford deposeth in this sort.
M. Darrell comming to my house, wee went together vnto Whittington vpon a Sunday after dinner.
By which wordes, it seemeth that they dined together that day: and then Maister Darrels was but a curtolde fast.
Before M. Darrels comming to Whittington, but after it was knowne that hee should come thither, there was a great bruite that a myracle should be doone there: as William Sherman deposeth: whereupon hee amongst others repairing thither: found (saith hee, as thinke) foure or fiue hundred people gathered togither, at, and about the house of Thomas Wright, where the maide lay.
To which effect, M. Beresford likewise deposeth, that when he and M. Darrell came to Whittington, they found a great number gathered togither, to see what would become of the matter.
Herevppon wee may not doubt, but that M. Darrell laboured to shew his skil: and besides, that which before is expressed, did play indeed sundry prety tricks to moue the grea+ter admiratio~.
For whilst he was indeuoring to dispossesse her, he induced her by cunning speeches, to lie as though she were sencelesse, which he tearmed a traunce.
It is true that he denieth this: but thereof K. VVright deposeth.
confesse that M. Darrell put me in mind to be in a trance, and to lie as though were sencelesse after my violent fits, and that at the time of my pretended dispossessing at Whittington, when should haue lien as though had beene dead: fell fast a sleepe, and then when awaked, heard maister Darrell say to them that stood by, that had beene in a trance.
Another of his feats was this, whilst hee was thus working with her to cast out the diuels: (for you must vnderstand that the first had brought
more with him) he fel to shew the stre~gth of his faith, in daring to enter co~munication with the said spirits, diuers in the meane time trembling quaking as feating some hurt to themselues, when they should bee cast out.
In this his great shew of courage, hee commanded the diuels to tell him theyr names, and one of them (forsooth) saying his name was Roofye: thou lyest (quoth M. Darrell that name is common to all spirits: and then further vrging them, another (forsooth) sayde his name was Midlecub, which M. Darrell approued to be his true name.
confesse, that charged the spirit to tel his name, (which did then in ignorance) and that on spirit sayd, his name was Roofye, in a very great voyce, and in very fierce and cruell maner, that another said his name was Midlecub.
well remember (sayth he) that at the time when M. Darrell charged the spirit to tel his name, he answered his name was Roofye, to whom M. Darrell sayde, that hee lyed, for that was a common name to all spirits: and then hee charged him againe to tell his name, and hee gaue diuers other names which nowe remember not.
Nowe how it came to passe that Katherine Wright vsed those names, she hath before signified: when M. Darrell told her at Mansfield, that he heard the spirits within her, tearming themselues by those names: which names (saith shee) remembred, when Master Darrell asked the supposed diuels their names: and so did answere him in the person of the diuelles, according to the names that had learned of him.
Besides, it would be considered what euil lucke M. Darrell hath in his depositions.
For whereas he saith, that the spirit Roofye told his name in a very great voyce, and in verie fierce and cruel maner: William Sherman deposeth, That hee heard a voyce, which hee thought to be no other, then the maides voyce, she lying vnder a couering.
The speeches spoken (as Master Darrell sayd) by the spirit, were verily taken to bee the speeches of Katherine Wright, and poken by her naturall voyce and none other.
AgaineÂ· hee played a third legerdemaine, aunswerable to any of the former.
For whilst he was further labouring in this matter with the maid, he took vpon him to discern when euery of the said
spirits departed: saying to those that were present, there goeth our one spirit: and then after a while, there goeth out another spirite, and so the nimble fellow proceeded vntil as he pretended,
It may bee easily conceiued, in what a perplexitie the people were, whe~ these eight diuels were thought to be flying amongst them.
Vppon the sunday, &c. (sayth hee) the sayd Katherine Wright shewing the signes of dispossession, as renting sore, crying lowde, and lying for dead, affirmed, that beleeued, that then one of the spirits went out of her: which signes appearing in her eight seuerall times that day, and the night following, sayd she was possessed of eight wicked spirits, and was also dispossessed of them.
heard (saith she) M. Darrell affirme: there goeth out one spirit, there goeth out another spirit, and so till all were gone: notwithstanding, knewe well, or at the least thought, that had none in me.
Furthermore, it being obiected to M. Darrell, that vpon Katherine Wrights naming of Midlecub, as is before expressed, he (hauing learned of the said Kather.
Wright, that she and one Margaret Roper of Eckington were at some iarre, and thereupon had affirmed to Katherine Wright, that shee the said Margaret had bewitched her) did aske the saide Midlecub who sent him thether: and the maid or Middlecub forsooth, answering Margaret Roper, he the said M. Darrell gaue it out publikely, as hee had before priuately to the said Katherine: that Margaret Roper was a Witch, and had bewitched the saide maide: and thereupon procured a Constable to cary her with him the saide Darrel to one M. Fouliamb a Iustice of the Peace, who disliking his course, threatned to sende him to the Gaole.
Hereof M. Darrell confesseth part, and there are some depositions for the rest.
Vpon the occasion mentioned (sayeth M. Darrell) did procure the said Margaret to be carried to M. Fouliambe, who would haue sent her to the Gaole.
At Darrels instigation, she was carried to one M. Fouliambe a Iustice, and he reprouing the said Darrell for accusing the said woman, told him, that if he so demeaned himselfe any more, hee would send him to the Gaole.
M. Fouliambe examining the matter, found no cause in any sort to touch Margaret Roper, and forthwith discharged her.
Againe, M. Darrell was charged to haue perswaded Katherine Wright to scratch Margaret Roper the pretended Witch, till shee drew blood of her: saying, that in so doing shee should be cured, and that hee accordingly procured the said Margaret to bee brought vnto her, and that she the said Katherin did draw blood of her.
These points M. Darrell doth after a sort deny, but with some shifting.
verily thinke that Margaret Roper woulde sundry times haue co~fessed her sself to haue bewitched K. Wright, but that still at the instant, when she should haue deliuered those words, the diuel (as think) did stay her: substantial conceit to be deliuered vpo~ his oath.
But he proceedeth, telleth vs, that he staied her from the gaole, as he remembreth.
It seemeth that this could not haue bin forgotten, if it had bin true.
But he sheweth this reason why hee so intreated for her, telling M. Fouliambe this tale, viz. that the spirit, which had affirmed, that Mar.
Roper had sent him to K. VVright, did likewise affirm, that if the said M. Roper were brought to the said Katherine, she the said Katherine should smart for it: or words to that effect.
M. Fouliambe is dead, so as this dependeth vpon M. Darrels poore credit.
He could not deny but that the pretended witch was brought to K. Wright, therefore as it seemeth, deuiseth this shift to couer that poynt obiected vnto him in this behalf.
Roper being brought to the said Katherine, &c. some others, not being amongst them, as beleeue, would haue had the said Katherine to haue scratched the said Margaret by the face, but as was informed, the said Katherine was not able to scratch her, nor did draw any bloud of her as beleeue.
This scratching of witches, is generally accou~ted a thing vnlawfull, which caused M. Darrell (it may be thought) to pretend this great vncertaintie.
Howbeit, though his memorie be weak, his faith we see is strong.
But K. VVright affirmed vpon her examination, that maister Darrell told her, as is before expressed, and that accordingly, when M. Darrell brought Margaret Roper vnto her, she the sayd Katherine scratched her, and drew bloud on her.
And for the better iustifying of her words therein, T. VVright her brother deposeth thus: In my hearing M. Darrell perswaded K. VVright to scratch Margaret Roper, and to draw bloud of her, assuring her that the said Margaret had bewitched her, and that by drawing of bloud from her, shee should bee cured.
And to that purpose Maister Darrell procured the saide Margaret to be brought to my house to Katherine Wright, and accordingly shee the said Katherine did scratch her by the face, and drew bloud of her.
All which notwithstanding, the saide Katherine receiued no ease thereby.
Lastly, whereas M. Darrell did pretend that then Katherine VVright was dispossessed of eight diuels, and hath since so often bragged of his dealings with her, both at Burton in Lancashire, at Nottingham, in euery place in effect where hee hath come, in so much, as some of his friendes thought, hee tooke too much vpon him in that behalfe: the truth is, as it appeareth by sufficient depositions, that hee deliuered her no more from the sayde eight spirits, then he had done before from the first, and that she receiued no benefit at all, by his prayer and packing with her, but then left her againe as hee founde her.
To this purpose there are these depositions: M. Darrell continued making of a wonder and a dinne to and with her, (when he pretended to cast out eight diuels of her) but what good hee did her thereby, could not perceiue, neither could finde that she receiued any ease thereby.
This certainely knowe that M. Darrel spent at VVhittington some three daies, and that after his departure, she continued as before in the self same maner of fits, that formerly she had vsed.
And Th. VVrightÂ· could neuer find, either by mine owne iudgement or by the opinion of others that were present at the time of her said dispossessions, or afterwardes, that the sayde Darrell had doone any good or ease vnto the saide Katherine, during her aboade with mee.
VVhich most certainly do beleeue, for that the fits which she had before Darrels comming to her in my house, and at the time of his being with her, and likewise all the time after, were still alike, without any change or alteration.
And to conclude, Katherine Wright deposeth, that when in her pretended fittes shee scritched, started, striued to seeme strong, feyned to speake in the person of the deuill, and to acte many such trickes, shee did dissemble, and counterfeyte them all, and acknowledge that in so doing, shee deserueth to bee grieuously punished, both by God and the Queene, and is hartily sory, and beggeth pardon for the same.
But M. Darrell will stand to it like a man, that shee did not counterfeyte and dissemble: but was indeede first possessed by one deuill, then dispossessed, and afterwardes repossessed with eight, and againe dispossessed of them all: Katherine Wright sayeth, that none in the world did know shee dissembled, but M. Darrell, and that hee at Whittington did charge her, that what meanes soeuer were vsed, she should keepe her owne counsell and his: for if euer shee confessed her dissembling, they were both vndone for euer.
And shee addeth, that shee thinketh hee will neuer confesse, that he practised with her to dissemble, by reason of the wordes he vsed vnto her.
But M. Darrell will start at this, and verefie her opinion.
Katherine Wright deposed, sayeth, that since M. Darrels first dealing with her, shee hath continued her dissimulation at times, till within a quarter of a yeare or thereaboutes, before this her examination, for the same causes, that first shee pretended herselfe to be worse then indeed she was: vz. to liue at some ease, and to bee much made of: but now promiseth and auoweth to leaue all her former practises, and to become a new woman, and to liue and work orderly and quietly with her mother and father, as it becommeth an honest poore woman to doe.
But Maister Darrell, he (forsooth) is resolute; that shee was repossessed within a short time after hee had left her, and that so shee hath continued euer since, and so remayneth at this Present.
True it is, that if he should not so holde, he must be driuen with shame to confesse, that all his dealinges with her were vaine and friuolous: which woulde very much discredite the rest of his wonderfull workes.
VIII. of M. Darrels proceedinges with Mary Cooper the sister of William Somers.
THe last that M. Darrell had in hand to worke his skill vppon, was one Mary Cooper of Nottingham, wife of Robert Cooper the younger.
This Mary remayning with her father in law, had seene her brother and Maister Darrelles dealinges with him, at her saide father in lawes house, and did herselfe beginne to practise her brothers trickes: pretending to bee troubled as he was presentlie after Christmas,
at what time her brother falling againe to his olde trickes, was iudged by Maister Darrell to be repossessed.
Of which matter Maister Darrell in his Apologie writeth vauntingly in this sorte.
If Somers be a counterfeyte, and haue taught him, then vndoubtedly Mary Cooper his sister is such, and hath also confederated with vs herein.
For shee cannot onely doe some of his trickes, as they call them, but besides, for a time beganne her fittes, when hee had entred his: hee in like sorte following her, hauing their fittes by course.
And this they did although they were in seuerall roomes, as am able and offer now to proue by a multitude of witnesses.
But hereof as shee will cleare me, so it hath not hetherto beene saide, that shee hath any hand in this counterfeyte action, why then doe any charge that vpon mee? Is it not time well bestowed to deale with this Impostor? See how in effect he reasoneth: taught not Mary Cooper to counterfeyte: therefore taught not Somers.
And againe, if haue taught Mary Cooper to counterfeyte, then shee hath confederated with mee and her brother.
But because M. Darrell will needes bee so gallant in this matter, it shall appeare both what may be, and hath beene laide to his charge, together with his answeres thereunto.
First, Mary Cooper sayeth thus: many times Maister Darrell would call me vnto him alone, being in my fathers house, and tell me that he doubted, that would proue in time to bee possessed, and therefore bad mee looke vnto it.
These pointes Maister Darrell doth in effect confesse to bee true in these wordes: belieue that haue had diuerse times priuate speeches with Mary Cooper: but so as alwaies did cast to auoide suspition of incontinencie: and also that sometimes or other, haue saide vnto her, that as thought, shee would proue to bee possessed with a wicked spirite.
Hee was neuer charged with any suspition of incontinencie, nor other crime, which did not concerne his casting out of deuilles: so as therein he was too cautious.
Howbeit in that, which here hee hath confessed, hee was not so circumspect.
For his particular speeches with her were nothing else, but a cunning proiect to put Mary Cooper in mind, that shee might counterfeyt such a matter, and so she tooke it.
Hereunto also that appertayneth, which shee deposeth thus: oftentimes heard M. Darrell say before my pretended euilnes, that it was the deuilles custome, when he had possessed one in a Family, to seeke to possesse more of the same familie likewise.
This, (as arguing too plainlie his cunning packing) Maister Darrell denyeth: but it is somewhat strengthned by Somers deposition in this behalfe: Before time (sayeth he) that fell againe into this course, meaning his pretended repossession, heard M. Darrell tell some that were present, that except very good heed were taken, the deuill would not cease with afflicting of me: but would also, as he thought, assaile some other in my father in lawes familie.
Of which wordes, did not then know the meaning, till afterwarde, that my sister did pretend herselfe to haue the like fittes to mind, and then did verily suspect that M. Darrell had brought my sister to imitate me.
But afterwardes was out of doubt thereof: for desiring to vnderstand of Maister Darrell, what my sister ayled, hee bad me not to feare her: for (quoth he,) she is but as thou art, and shall doe well inough.
Furthermore, whilest the said Mary Cooper was meditating (as it seemeth) vpon Maister Darrels former speeches, it fellout, that a childe of hers died a little before Christmas: which shee tooke so heauilie, as it made her (as shee sayeth) indeed and truely euill at ease, and somewhat weake: whereupon certaine women, and others in the towne, comming vnto me, tolde me (saieth shee) that was worse, then knew my selfe to be: and that would be as euill as my brother William was.
These wordes added to M. Darrelles former speeches: that hee doubted, shee would proue to bee possessed, and that Sathan was not contente with one in a Familie, together with her experience of the signes of possession; which shee had seene in her brother, and often heard of Maister Darrell, made her, (as shee sayeth) to doe that which shee neuer thought to haue done: that is (as shee addeth) to tomble and tosse, to talke idely, and to laugh: which laughing, woulde sometimes haue restrayned, but could not by reason of the peoples foolish speeches that were present.
This laughing and fleering some woulde thinke to bee but a small matter: but consider what M. Darrell gathered of it, affirmed (saith he) in Mary Coopers hearing, that her laughing and fleering countenance was such, as had seene in others who were possessed.
Againe, the said Mary Cooper being thus deemed to be troubled with Sathan, it fel out, that besides her saide grief and weakenesse, she had also some swelling in her bodie: whereby she verily thought her selfe to be with child.
And otherwise whatsoeuer she pretended in outwarde shew, she neither had, suffred nor felt, (as she hath deposed) any thing in the worlde.
Against her opinion of being with child, M. Darrell opposed himselfe as much as he could.
M. Darrell (saith she) laboured to bring me from my perswasion of being with child: by often saying, that it was no child, but such a child, as God blesse euery good bodie from: and such a child as would sticke by me, as all there in Nottingham should see apparantly.
These wordes of Mary Coopers being deduced into an article (as they are here set downe) M. Darrell answering vnto it, saith thus: haue at sometimes laboured to perswade the said Mary, as it is articulated.
Furthermore, notwithstanding that the said Mary Cooper hath confessed her dissimulation, and the reason that moued her thereunto: moreouer also deposeth thus: when spake any idle wordes to the beholders, knew very well what saide and did: but made shew to speake idly: when laughed, knew that laughed: and in all my pretended fittes, heard and saw, and vnderstoode as well as any present: and did answere directly to any thing that the standers by demanded of me: and when M. Darrell in my pretended fits was vehement and earnest with me, laughed at him, and could not but laugh, if one had giuen me neuer so much: yet notwithstanding M. Darrell saith in this sort: confesse that affirmed, that the straunge troubles, which she endured, did eyther proceed from sathan within her, or by his outward operation: that belieue she was sencelesse in her fittes, and haue said, that her laughter in her fittes did proceed from the deuill: and doe likewise belieue, that when she spake, it was not she but Sathan.
It may hereby euidently appeare, what a garboyle this lewde Impostor would haue made in Nottingham, if he had not beene preuented: for vppon his sayd speeches, diuers of his adherents, specially women, they bestirred themselues in this matter, as Mary Cooper hath deposed.
When mistris Gray (sayth Mary Cooper and the rest of her companie came about me, saying and reporting, that should bee deliuered of some monstrous thing, laughed heartily at theyr folly: and this my laughing they termed my fitte, and would cry out: now Lord blesse her, shee is in a sore fit: the which their foolish wondring made mee laugh more and more: and the more laughed, the more they cryed: Lord haue mercy on her, she is in a strange fit.
Besides, when had laughed till my heart was sore at them, and so was faine of necessitie to lye still, and not stirre, because my strength was spent with laughing, then would the whole company of women, namely Mrs. Gray, and the rest, crie out: Lord blesse her, Lord saue her: Lord Iesus haue mercie on her, now she is in a traunce.
And whereas M. Darrell in his wordes before recited out of his Apologie, doth offer to proue by a similitude of witnesses, that for a time Marie Cooper began her fits, when Somers had ended his, and that he in like sort followed her, hauing their fits by course, and that this they did, although they were in seuerall roomes: which hee maketh a strange matter, and doth thereby insinuate, that they being in diuers rooms, could not know by any ordinary knowledge when eyther of their fittes ended, that so the one might begin after the other had done.
William Somers and his sister (saith he) being troubled together, (as it is pretended) had very much to doe with them: for had no sooner done with the one, but presently was compelled to go to the other.
When had beene a while with Somers, he would breake out of his fit, and crie vehemently vnto me: go looke to my sister: and accordingly still going vnto her, found her in her fits.
But here it is to bee obserued, that there was but a thinne wall betwixt both their beds, so as she might easily heare her brother when he willed me to go vnto her.
Furthermore, when had beene in like manner with the said Mary, and that she had continued a space in her fittes, she would also breake out of them, and crie out vnto me: go looke to my brother.
And still when came vpon her motion to Somers, found him in his fittes.
Now these wordes, vz. go looke to my brother, go looke to my sister, were spoken by them both so lowd, as that they might easily heare one the other.
And in this case they both continued together (as remember) about fiue dayes, whereby was very much wearied and troubled.
And thus this great misterie being laid open, Mayster Darrell needeth not to produce his multitude of witnesses.
Againe, it being obiected to M. Darrell, that Mary Cooper imparting vnto him, how in her dreame she had seene certaine sightes, which made her afraide: he laboured to perswade her, that she was in no dreame, but that she saw such things in deed, and willed her to affirme and auow, that in her fitts she had had such apparitions: his answere thereunto is as followeth.
Mary Cooper hath diuers times told me, that sundry nightes she being brode awake, and not in any dreame, hath seene diuerse shapes appearing vnto her, as of Cattes, Dogges, &c. which belieue were wicked spirits, appearing in such shapes: and confesse that haue affirmed so much vnto others, but cannot depose that so haue affirmed vnto her: howbeit, belieue if haue not spoken so much vnto her, yet haue done it to others in her hearing.
But Mary Cooper deposeth thus: The relation which made before the iudges at the assises, of my seeing strange sights and apparitions, as the apparition of cattes and flames of fire, with the rest, had dreamed of them by night in a dreame onely: and when had told M. Darrell what had dreamed, he perswaded me, that it was no dreame but a true vision: and bad mee say auowe, that had seene those cattes and flames of fire in deed.
By this his perswasion did so say auow, and caused it to be belief or a truth.
You heare in this deposition some mention of the Iudges: whereupon it is fit to remember vnto you, what a very straunge and malicious practise was vndertaken to haue procured the death of a poore woman, one Alice Freeman vpon pretence that she was a witch.
This Alice Freeman was one of those whome Somers had named for witches, is allied to M. Freeman an Alderman Iustice of peace in Nottingham.
This M. Freeman (as it seemeth) had no liking of M. Darrelles proceedings with Somers, which stirred vppe great hatred and malice against him: which because M. Darrell and his adherentes could not execute vpon him: they thought they would be reuenged vpon his kinswoman: It is said (but vntruely) by some of M. Darrels friends, that before the detecting of Alice Freemon for a witch, it was not reported in Nottingham, that Somers was a dissembler, thereby inferring, that the offence taken by her detection, was the cause that raised vp a slaunder (forsooth) of Somers dissimulation: therefore no maruaile, if M. Darrell his associates, were greatly inflamed therewith.
Now this Alice Freeman hauing escaped that imputation in respect of Somers, for that his bewitching was one while laid vpon the Darbishire witch, and afterwards vpon the Worcestershire witch, a practise was vndertaken to charge the said poore woman Alice Freeman, to haue bewitched to death the childe before mentioned of this Marie Cooper: and that she likewise was the cause of the said Maries trouble and vexation, as hauing bewitched her in like manner.
This conceite being thrust into Marie Coopers head, she charged the said Alice with that fellonie: her inditement was framed at the next Assizes: she was arraigned: M. Darrell was one amongst diuers that gaue in euidence against the woman, grounding himselfe much vppon Somers detecting of her for a witch: and matters were so prosecuted against her, as had not the Iudges in their wisedome discerned somewhat, rectified their courses to a due issue, it is verily thought the poore woman (being founde guilty by the great enquest) had beene condemned to death.
Of these particulars, there are no depositions (sauing what Mary Cooper her selfe hath confessed vpon her oath).
Howbeit that the said Alice was so dealt with, it will not bee denied.
was procured (saith she) by Mistris Gray, George Small and his wife, M. Power and his wife, to prosecute the matter of inditement, which preferred against Alice Freeman, at the Assizes for a witch: and receiued money of mistres Gray, to pay for the bill of inditement: and likewise receiued instructions from amongst them to frame in euidence: and they likewise vrged me to moue for the good behauiour against Alice Freeman when she was acquitted.
But in my conscience am perswaded, and was perswaded of the said Alice Freeman, that she was neuer any witch, and did all that attempted against her at the vrging of the parties aforesaid.
Besides, as soone as Alice Freeman was acquitted, went as was willed before to Mistris Darrell, M. Power and his wife, Mistres Aldridge were met together, and stayed for me: and then and there M. Darrell and the rest were earnest with mee, to frame a petition to my Lorde Anderson, and notwithstanding the acquiting aforesaid, to offer to take it vpon my oath, that the said Alice Freeman had bewitched, not onely my child, (for the which before she had beene indited and acquited) but also my selfe, and they framed and gaue me a petition accordingly: but my conscience pricked me not to deliuer it.
If his be true which is thus deposed, it is but agreeable vnto the violent humours that raigne in that kinde of people.
But sure, the practise was fowle: and therefore it was feared (as it seemeth) to be detected.
For after that Somers was in examination at London, the said Mary had a shrewd caution giuen her.
She deposeth thereof in this sorte: Maister Darrell (saith she) and the rest aboue named, meaning Mrs. Gray, Maister Power and his wife, and Mrs. Aldridge told me, that must beware: for if any hole could be espied in my coate, should be sent for to London, as my brother William was.
This Mary Cooper hauing continued about three or foure weekes in her said dissimulation, she did leaue off those practises, as her brother saith, without any assistance of M. Darrell to dispossesse her, and hath beene well euer since.
And M. Aldridge: afterwardes she grew to bee indifferently well, and so doth continue: onely she complaineth, that she hath a kind of stirring in her bellie.
But in deede (as information is giuen) the poore woman liueth orderly and well amongst her neighbors, and is not otherwise troubled, then it happeneth out vppon occasion with other women.
Onely it seemeth she is in great feare of some hard measure to be offred vnto her, vpon the comming to light of her examination.
For thus she deposeth: Now that haue from my conscience told the truth in this matter, shall be so pointed at, reuiled and abused, in the open streetes of the towne, as shall grow wearie of my life.
For the meeting with which inconuenience, it is wished and not doubted, that the Magistrates in Nottingham, will be carefull.
Vnto these notable exploites of M. Darrels, concerning Mary Cooper, Katherine Wright, the boy of Burton, William Somers, something might bee added of his pretended dispossessing the seuen, so often mentioned in Lancashire, out of one Maister Mores examination confession touching that matter.
His said examination is in the Registers office to her Maiesties Commissioners, for causes ecclesiasticall: where all the rest of the aforesaid examinations do remaine.
And if any will take the paines to peruse it, he shal find, that M. Darrel and M. Mores course held with those in Lancashire, was as vaine and ridiculous, as with any of the other.
The authour of the Briefe Narration, after hee hath taken his pleasure against the proceedinges of her Maiesties Commissioners, and such as they deputed for the better examination of these causes, as disdaining and scorning them, he writeth (iudgeing other men of likelihood by his owne corrupt conscience) in this sorte: What goodly stuffe they haue returned, time and malice will make knowne vnto vs.
The stuffe such as it is (vile in deed) his Maistershippe may bee pleased now to peruse: and thereby reape some profit, if he reade it with no greater malice then it was written.
The gentleman concludeth this Narration (as it hath beene before mentioned) in some choller, when alluding to those that cannot belieue Maister Darrels wonders, he saith: Let him that is filthie bee filthie still: And thereunto addeth, that doe Sathan what he can, wisedome shall bee iustified of her children: meaning (if he apply the place with any sence) that Maister Darrell and his proceedings shall be defended and iustified.
Howbeit peraduenture, when he hath better considered the contents of this treatise, he will not be so peremptorie.
Otherwise, he hath here matter sufficient to shew his skill in, for the iustification of it.

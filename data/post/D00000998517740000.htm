the translatovr to the reader
seing the iniquyte of the present tyme to be suche that the mouthes of al catholyks being stopped the aduersaryes only of christ and his crosse are suffred to crie and crowe with open mouthe against our common mother the catholyke churche seing the faithe of our fathers assalted with heresy truthe ouercraked with falshood religion turned in to opinions vnite in to sectes coulde not but thinke it high tyme for euery honest and faythful chrystian in suche sorte as he were able to steppe to the susteining and repayring the ra~pars of the churche being daily bothe by secret vndermyninges and suche open shott so fiercely assaulted and shaken by satha and his ministres

and being vpon these and other iuste respectes entred in to that mynde and determynacion fynding yet my selfe in myne owne conceyte vnable to yelde of myne owne any thinge worthe the reading thought not amisse for a beginning to imparte by the co~modyte of our vulgar tou~ge to my vnlerned

countreme in which sorte thinke the greatest number of the deceyued to consiste some worthy worke of some other mannes

amonge the whiche fynding in myne opinion none more leekly to induce reasonable men to see their owne faulte and by what meanes they haue bene and daily be deceyued haue selected out of the notable workes of the light of this our age that most vertuous and lerned father hosius nowe cardinall and one of the preside~tes in the late general cou~cell holden at trident that discourse and treatyse which he made and intytuled of the expresse worde of god a worke allready translated in to diuerse vulgar tounges sette forthe in sondry editions distracted and solde by greate numbers for the singular and euident co~modyte thereof
and this pece the rather amo~ge the rest haue selected for that haue by experyence noted that there is no one deceyte vsed by sathan that dothe so muche enlarge his kingedome or so muche withdrawe the membres of christ from his mysticall body the churche as dothe that glorious shewe which by his ministres he maketh of his owne worde vnder the plausible name of the vvorde of god

for well ye wote nothinge is in the mowthes of these newe and sedytious ministers and promoters of the ghospel more ryse

and co~mon then the scripture the gospel and the worde of the lorde

the worde of the lorde the worde of the lord is euer in their mouthe
of this they ia~gle
this they ringe allwaies in our eares
but the catholike church of who we shoulde lerne what in dede the word of god is of whose mouthe only we must harken for this worde and by whom only we knowe which is the true written worde of god and what the true sence of that worde is this catholyke churche they speake not of
vve professe in our crede that we beleue in the catholyke churche
if we did in the crede so expressely professe we beleue in the worde of god howe vehemently should that article haue bene beaten into our heades vvhat vauntes what exclamations what repetityo~s woulde here haue suffised nowe the church not the worde being expressed the master and teacher not the lesson it selfe bei~g professed they crake of the lesso and forget their teacher they bable the word
and no word of the church

the parte of lerned and playne dealing me had bene first to define and make playne vnto the worlde what that is which they call the clere and expresse worde of god and which they make as it were their shooteanker their touchestone and their co~mo refuge whe~soeuer they be by the catholiks pressed with sou~de

and vnuincible authorite of the churches doctrine
in dede epicure out of whose schole

this voluptuous ghospell may seeme to haue issued did not leeke to haue thinges plainely defined
but cicero sayeth that without definition it can not be that they which contend aboute any thinge can agree what is the thinge in question
these men therefore seeking to kepe in store blinde and vnknowen angles to flee vnto when they be chased wil not orderly define what is that their gods worde of which they triumphe so much nor allowe any expositio thereof but their owne or any iudge but the vnlerned multytude

sins therefore that is the swete bayte wherewith the mortal hooke is coouered and the softe flese wherin the wolfe is wrapped who gladly will not discouer him selfe this graue vertuous and lerned father hosius the auctor of this treatyse moued with christian pietye will herein manifestly open and displaye vnto thee what is hidde vnder the glorious shewe of gods worde howe farre the bare and darke letter of the scriptures where in they only comprehend their gods worde at the lest yf they lymit it within any compasse is from being so clere and playne as they suppose it
and farther that the same being by them peruerted and deliuered to thee with a wro~ge sence and a wrye hereticall expositio differing

from the churche which is the sure grou~de and piller of al truthe the faitheful interpreter

of gods worde aud the storehowse of al right knowkeadge is in dede so farre fro being the expresse worde of god as that thou shallt plainely perceyue it to be the expresse worde of the diuell

finally thou shalt besides many other notable things by the waye whereof in the table to this booke annexed thou shalt see greate copie lerne also herein the true definition of gods worde and which is the very true expresse and as they call it the liuely worde of the lorde that is the quickening and lifegiuing worde of god
vvhich in dede is open and clere yea so clere shorte and easy as it maye of all persons of all sortes ages and capacytees be lerned euen without euer reading the scriptures
and that is this worde
loue or

charyte the only scope of al scriptures
the ende of all the co~maundeme~tes the co~summatio and acco~plisheme~t of the whole lawe
fro the knowleadge and sight of which true clere and expresse worde of god conteyning in it the somme and effect of all the wordes that euer god vttered in the lawe and the prophetes thou shalt perceyue in the discourse hereof howe farre these men be that yett thinke the selues of suche sharpe wytte and quicke sight that they see beyond all the graue

and lerned fathers that haue bene or be at this daye
and doo with their forged gods worde which is in very dede but their owne worde labour and te~de to none other ende but to the dissoluing of vnite and ma~gling the misticall body of christ the churche

this true worde of god therefore this loue saye and charyte which on the other side dothe not dissolue but vnyte not mangle but amende not rente and wounde but ioyne and heale and is euer occupied in doi~g good hath nowe moued me to bestowe this trauayl in imparting to thee my dere countrey ma this godly and lerned treatyse most necessary for thy health and sauegarde in this perillous tyme
reade therefore with humilyte and suspe~d praye thee thy partial foreiudgeme~t if thou be of the nu~ber of the seduced vntill thou haue read it to the ende
and then if thou fynde thy selfe to haue receyued good thereby as beseche god thou mayest and nedes thou must if thou haue any sparke of grace left vnquenched in thee then geue the honour and glory thereof to almighty god and for recompence bothe to the auctor and translatour afford them in thy deuoute prayers a place amonge thy frendes

to the right fortvnat and renowmed prynce sigismond by the grace of god kyng of polonia mighty duke of lithuania russia prussia lorde and heyre of masouia and samogitia his most gracious lorde stanislavs hosiv's bisshopp of vvarmia his prayer and seruyce reuerently commendeth
of the expresse worde of god

that somwhat should write vnto your highnes of the expresse worde of god right myghty kyng sigismond the vnbrideled bouldnes of the heretikes of our age hath moued me
vvho albeit emong them selues they be wonderfully diuided yet doth eche secte of them so contentiously challenge the same vnto themselues

yea so vsurpe it vnto them selues alone that from the possession therof they labour to exclude not only all suche sectes as dissent fro euery of them but euen the very catholikes and right beleuers
for suche is the arroga~cy of these men so great the forgetfulnes of the selues that they take all others to be but fooles doultes and blockes that ca see nothing in the scriptures and perswade them selues to be the only persons that haue attayned to the true vnderstanding therof

but is it leekly where so great pryde resteth where so great inflation of the mynde is that there can be that spirit which resteth not but ouer the hu~ble and meeke and

suche as fearfully tremble at his word very

notably sayd the wise man
vvher is humillite ther is wisdo wher is pryde and swelling of the mynd ther is follye
for calling the selues

wise men they are become fooles
in the lowe valleys sayeth that holly kynge and

prophet not in the high hills doth god send foorth the springes and fou~taynes of his grace he hydeth his mysteries fro the wyse and

reueleth them vnto the hu~ble and meeke
therfore none do lesse vndersta~d what is the

expresse worde of god then they which most glory therof and which do so arrogat vnto the selues alone the vndersta~dig therof that as the prouerbe sayeth they will seme to

pricke owt the choughs eyes
but this is no newe practys
it hath allwayes been the propertie of heretikes to glory of the clere and expresse word of god and to challe~ge it vnto the selues alone
vvith what other shewe or prete~ce did the false pro}phettes eue before the byrth of christ deceiue the people but with this of the word of god vvhe the pro}phet hieremy did foretel many heauy thigs we reade he vsed to begynne with these wordes as other the pro}phets of god did
thus sayth our lord and did not the false pro}phet ananias also vse the same wordes whe falsely he prophecyed farre co~trary thinges who our lord denyed to haue bee sent fro him vvho in an other place wee heare thus speaking of these false pro}phets falsly do prophets prophesie in

my name sent the not co~maunded them not neither spake vnto the
they prophesie vnto you a false vision a deceiuable prophesie and the wro~ge co~ceyte of their owne hart
and in an other place
harken not

sayth he vnto the wordes of prophetes which prophesie vnto you and deceyue you
they tell you the vision of their own hart and not out of our lord his mowthe
they saye vn to them which blaspheme me
the lord

hath sayed peace shalbe with you and a litle after he sayeth they steal his wordes

vvhich place hierome doth thus interprett

a lye sayth he doth allwayes counterfait

and borowe the likenes of a truthe
for howe could it otherwise abuse and deceyue the simple euen so therefore as false prophetes did lye vnto the people before the comyng of christ saying thus sayth the lord haue seen the lord and the word of the lord was shewyd to hym or to hym so doo heretikes take vnto the the testimonies of scriptures out of the owld and newe testame~t and steale the wordes of our sauiour euery one of that which cometh next to hand of the prophetes apostles and euangelistes and take vnto the their tounges that therwith they may vtter owt of their mowthes the poyson of their hartes
very aptly doth hierom compare heretikes with those lying prophetes and right well said he doth a lye

allwayes imitat and counterfait a trowthe

for as the prophetes of god said the word of our lord the mowthe of our lord hath spoken it
thus sayeth our lord the same phrase and termes vsed also the false prophettes

but what they bothe prophecied lett vs marke a litle
the prophettes of god rebuked

the sinnes of the people exhorted them to amendement and for shewed vnto them the heauy wrathe of god to ha~g ouer their heades that he would co~sume them with sworde famyn and pestilence that he would oppresse them with most harde bondage yea and vtterly destroy them with an vniuersal slaughter

on the other syde those lying prophettes

whom our lorde had not sent nor co~maunded sayde yowe shall not see the sworde and hunger shall not be emong you but the lord will geue you true and sure peace
they cured sayth the prophett the co~tritio of the

dowghter of my people slenderly saying peace peace yet was there no peace and as one other prophet saith of those lyars who said thus sayth the lord whe the lord had not

spoken it they sowde together cusshins for

the elbowe of euery hand and made pillowes to lay vnder the heades of euery age the more easely to entrape their soules

how contrary was the preaching of these

ij sortes of prophetes they thretned to saue these lulled to destroye yet in the meane tyme both prophezied in the name of god bothe gloried in the worde of the lorde

but is not the trade and manner of the prophets of our age euen leeke to this vvhat do they els which be laufully sent of the catholike churche but denou~ce vnto the people the same which esaie hieremie ezechiel

daniel ioël ionas other the pro}phets of god did in those dayes denounce they rebuked the wickednes of the people they exhorted the that bei~g dro~ke they would awake weepe and howle
fearfull thinges they fortolde the
and being so put in feare they exhorted the that they should turne vnto

our lord that they should yeld worthy fruits of penaunce that so being throughly correctyd thy might happely escape the paynes wherwith the lord had threatned the
and being so turned ageine vnto our lord yn fasting

weeping and mourning then at the

last did they discouer vnto the the mercye of our lorde and did forbidde that no person throwgh the greatnes of his sinnes should dispayre of pardo
for our lorde is ge~tle and

mercyful pacye~t and of much mercy and one that wilbe intreatid to remitt his displeasure
he will not the death of a synner but rather that he should conuert and lyue he followeth not mans impatience but loge looketh for our repentaunce so as yf wee

yeld worthy fruictz of penaunce he also repenteth him of his threates and forbearith to lett faull vppon vs the plages which he denounced and with our chaunge is also chaunged him self

thus the myndes of mortall me beyng lyft vp into a better hope lest perhaps the preaching of the greatnes of gods mercye might make them agayn negligent and careles behold how he tempered his speeche
vvho

knowyth sayth ioël yf he shall turne yf he shall forbear and leaue behynd him his blessing

as though he would saye sayth hierome wee truly do exhort so myche as

in vs is to repentaunce because wee knowe the mercy of god to be vnspeakable

but because we can not knowe the bottom of the wisedom and knowledge of god we temper our speeche and wishe rather then presume our sinnes to be forgeuen vs

and remigius the bisshopp of auxerre

about
yeres past or there about following herein hiero

they might sayth he haue answered because the lord is pacye~t and of myche mercy as thow saiest it is not needful that we afflict our selues and do penaunce for he will haue mercy on vs what so euer we do
but the prophett to mete with this sayth what man liuyng knoweth yf

god be turned from the fury of his wrathe to mercye it is not possible for any man to knowe it
it is better that doing penaunce wee meryt to atteyne pardon of our sinnes and after penaunce doon hauing obteyned remission thereof then wee offer sacrifice vnto our lord

after the same sort more then
yeres past rupertus abbat of tuitia by colle

reporting the same wordes
eue yn penance it self sayth he the prophett wissheth vs to be ware and taketh away surety
of the same opinio allso nere
yeres past was albertus

not without cause named the great whoo expownding the same wordes

although saith hee it bee certaine that god pardoneth

the co~tryte yett is it vncertayne whither any man be truly contryte he shall see that he ca not be correctyd whom god hath

despysed
the wicked ma prayed to the lord

of whom yet hee did not obteyne mercye
cain made oblation yett god had no regard

to his sacrifyce
moises saide of some behold not lord their oblations

thus farre albert
behould how ioël preached and how euer since by the space of one thousand ij hundred yeres by long succession of priestes and bisshops euen to this our age these wordes of his haue been vnderstanded

yet did not iohel alone so preache but da+niel

allso
vvhen he expownded to the king nabugodonosor his dreame did hee not in the beginning terribly feare him when hee declared what mischieffs should happe vnto him yet did he not by and by will him to dispayr but shewed him the waye wher by he might escape the paynes which were thretnyd vnto him
let my councell sayth he king please the redeme thy sinnes

with almes and thy iniquitees with mercy toward the poore
vvith these wordes he brought some comforte to the kinge being before stryken with a wonderfull feare
yett would hee not sett him in a carelesnes or surety
he said not be sure thy sinnes shal be forgeeue thee but thus
god will perhaps forgeeue thy sinnes
of wich wordes hierom

treating when daniel sayth hee forknowing thinges to come doubteth of gods determination full rashely doo they which bouldly promise forgeuenes to sinnes
and the ordinary glose saith
this their temerytee is intollerable
thus the prophesied ioëll and thus daniell

but what did the kinge of niniue when ionas the prophett fortolde him it should

come to passe that with in xl dayes niniue should be destroyed did not he bei~g clothed him self in sackcloth and sitting ashes ex+horte the people to penaunce that men and beastes should be couered with sackes that they should stro~gly crye vnto our lorde that men might be turned fro their euill waye and from the iniquitees which they had in hand but did he after suche co~uersion bidd

them stande by and by in surety of pardon no but as ioël and daniel did so did he who knoweth saith he yf godd will be turned and forgeue vs which wordes hiero

expou~ding sayth
therfore this forgeuenes is made doutfull and incertain that while men sta~d yn doubte of their saluacion they shoulde the more earnestly doo penau~ce and more stirre god vnto mercy
which wordes are in like termes repeted of remigius and rupertus and yn the ordinary glose
in such sorte that neuer any one ma yn the church of god semeth otherwise to haue vnderstode the wordes of those pro}phettes
vvhose ma~ner of preaching yn this point wee reade the apostles allso to haue followed
for so did peter

speake vnto simon magus who thought the gift of god might be possessed for moony doo penaunce saith he for this thy wickednes

and pray to god to see yf happely this nawghty thought of thy hart may be forgeuen
if happely saith he he dooth not bid him to be certayne and sure therof

this doctryne of the prophettes and apostles dooth the catholyke churche yett howlde geeuing terrour to sinners

that therby shee may the more effectually stirre them to repe~tawnce which whe they haue done shee dooth not therfore co~maund them by and by to be owt of feare but rather by all meanes dooth feare them from perillows securite and well commawndeth

them to hope in our lord and to doo good
but assurednes of forgiuenes of their synnes and certayn knowledge therof to bragge of and yn that suertye rechlesse to rest shee forbyddeth
for albeit of the mercy of god of his promyses of the merytt of christ his death of the vertue and efficacye of the sacramentes no good man ought to doubte yet when anny man respectyth hymself and his owne infirmitee hee may well feare and stand yn doubt of gods grace in his owne par+te
this is the preaching of the catholyke churche well and rightly agreyng with the doctryne of esay hieremie ezechiell daniel ioël ionas yea and of peter the apostle

but doo these men which not muche more then xxx yeres passed departed from vs agree therwith naye rather they seeme to stand cleane square from this doctrine

for what other thing saye these teachers

but that which ananias semeias and the rest of the faulse prophetes sayde to whom our lord had not spoken you shall not see the swoord say they there shalbe no famyn emong you but sure peace wyll the lord geeue you
peace peace they crye when peace is not and denouncyng a sownde slepe securyte deceyue the sowles of many

for they teache what so euer our woorkes

be so our fayth be fyrme and stedfast wee are sure of our saluation for that god regardeth not woorkes vvhere yet the playn woordes of the scripture be manyfest to the contrary
namely where it speakyth of the niniuites their appeasing of god
god sawe their workes and because they were turned fro their euill waye he had mercy of them
god saw

their woorkes sayth the prophet these fellows on the other syde saye god regardeth no workes behould lord sayth the prophet dauyd my humillite and trauayll and pardon

all my synnes and in an other psalme regard my humillitee and deliuer me because

haue not forgotten thy lawe
behould lord because haue looued thy commandementes

quicken me yn thy mercye

vvhich wordes hilary expounding

the

prophett sayth he reseruyng all to the iudgement of god desireth to be deliuered for

the meryt of his humillitee

whom ambrose following sayth
as he which hath hu~bled his hart as he which hath laboured muche there he desireth his sinnes may be forgeue and here he prayeth to be deliuered
and after a fewe wordes he thus sayth farther

a good wrestlar sheweth his lymmes that the well orderyng of him self for that feate may be allowed he allso then shewyth his lymmes when after hard tugging and paynfull grypes hee is ageyn prouoked to the wrestlyng place to the end the iudge seing his weary and trauayled body compell him not eft soones to wrestle
she we thow therfore the humillitee of thy hart that the tokens of thy vertue may appeare
shew also the paynfull stryfes thy body hath indured that thow mayest saye haue wrestled a good pulle
haue endyd

my race and the spirituall iudge beholding thy striuing for the game may adiudge vnto thee the crowne of iustice because

thow hast accomplisshed the lawe of the game

the prophett prayeth godd that hee would regard his humilyte his trauayll and that he was not forgetfull of his lawe that hee looued his commandementes which saint ambrose commaunded also wee should shewe vnto godd

but the false prophetes and false ghospellers

of our age denye that god regardith our workes
they denye that he hath any care of them and teache that how so euer our workes be yett must euery man stand assured here of that freely for christes sake his sinnes be forgeeuen him
that hee is in the fauour of god and heyre of the lyfe euer lasting for so muche as all our iustice and all our holynes is but

mere synne and a thing condempned
as for contrition that it is a thing so farre from profytyng that it makyth a man the greater synner
that yff remorse of synne doo gnawe any mans conscyence hym doo they commawnd thus to awnswer

vvhat is synne but sinne am notwithstandyng

holly or yf be not yett

christ is god as though it were lausull for euery man to be wicked because christ is god by his iustice teache they wee are iust by his goodnes wee are good yea thowgh wee haue not in vs so muche as one sparke of his goodnes
yea althowgh wee be ouer whelmed yn all kindes of iniquitee
looke how muche the more wicked thow art sayth one of these newe ghospellers so muche the sooner dooth god geeue his grace vnto thee
yea hee commawndeth his followers thus to saye my sinnes doo burde christ not my co~science

but what maye not wee say with hieremie the prophett vvoonders are happened

vpon the earthe to the astonning of men
prophetes prophesied lyes priestes clapped their handes and my people leeked suche thinges
in dede the people hath leeked suche thinges
for so may wee see men rauisshed with the smothe woordes of these lyeng prophetes euen as it were with the sweet songes of meremaydes that yf a man will go aboute to preache vnto them rather true and holsom thinges then those which are swete and pleasaunt to the eares he

shall be hissed out of the place
and rude vnlearnyd asses will not styck sometyme to prescribe vnto the prophettes what they shall preache and to teache them of whom they shoold be taught
see not say they looke not owt for vs those thinges which ar ryght speake vnto vs pleasing thinges

looke owt errours for vs preache vnto vs

only fayth
threaten not hell fyer but promyse vs the kingdom of heauen that after our ryott and delycaces after our incestuous wedlockes wee may yett looke to fynd paradyse open vnto vs what shewe youe vnto vs the way of the lord which wee are not willing to enter yn to what doo youe recyte to vs the name of the holly one of israël

which dooth not enter ynto the secrettes of our hartes

thow seest most vertuows kyng of what sort is the preaching of those which in this our age call them selues gospellers wher yn deed they haue no agreement with the gospell and what ys agayne the doctryne of the catholykes
those men commawnd nawght ells but that eche man stedfastly beleeue and rest well assured that

he standeth yn the state of grace and ys an

vndoubted heyre of the kyngdom of heauen how so euer his workes be and with this their vayne surety they leade men hedlong to the euerlasting paynes of hell

our men on the other syde albeit they co~maund vs to hope for mercy at our lorde his handes yett doo they forbydde men rechelesse to lyue yn securite and farther warne them that they thinke it not inough to amend except they yeeld allso woorthy fruictes of penaunce and shewe foorth by their workes the fayth which they professe that when wee shall appere at the last iudgement it shall not be asked of vs what wee beleued but beleeuing what good or euill wee haue done here in this liffe

but seeme they not on bothe sydes armed with the woordes of the lawe of godd truly

both partes glory of his expresse woorde
bothe crye· the woorde of the lord
the mouthe of the lord hath spoken it
thus sayeth the lord
the catholikes bring foorth these scriptures
shewe foorth good

fruictes of penaunce
except yee repent

yee shall all perishe
vvee must suffer with christ yf wee wyl be glorified with him wee must dye with him yf wee will

lyue with him wee must indure with him yf wee will raigne with him

if thow wilt enter ynto life keepe the

commawndementes
if you knowe these thinges yee are happy so that yee doo them
thow lord wilt geeue to euery man according

to his woorkes

vvee must all be browght before the

iudgement seate of crist that eche man may carry away according as hee hath done yn the flleshe either good or euill
mercy shall make a place to eche man according

to the merytt of his workes
comme quickly and my reward is with me to yeeld to euery man according to his workes

they which haue doon good shall coome

foorth to the resurrection of lyffe and they which haue doon euyll to the resurrection of iudgement
man knowyth

not whither hee bee woorthy of loue or hatred
vvho vnderstandeth his offences

from my secret and hidden sinnes lorde clense me who can saye my hart is cleane

am pure from synnes fearid all my woorkes knowing that thow wooldest not spare an offender
my conscience dooth

not accuse me of any thing yet am not iustified therby
of synne pardoned yett stand not cleerly without feare
say not

the mercy of the lorde is great he will haue mercy on the multitude of our sinnes for his mercye and wrathe are soone at hand and wrath is bent vppon synne

vvith feare and trembling worke your saluation

blessed is the man· that is all wayes

fearfull he that is without feare can not be iustified

these and many others which were to

long to recyte are the scriptures wherby the catholykes and right beleeuers as by the expresse word of god indeuour to proue that it is not inough for a man to beleeue his sinnes be thorowgh christ forgeuen him that hee standeth yn good grace and is an heyre of the lyfe euerlasting howe so euer the matter goe with his workes but euen as it behoued christ first to suffer

and so to enter ynto his glory so must wee allso suffer before wee come to that glorye and as hee walked so must wee allso walke that wee must by our good workes make

stronge or sure our vocation and yett when wee haue all doon wee must not stand assured or carelesse but mistrust all our

workes and say wee be vnprofitable seruauntes so farre foorth as wee be not without feare euen of that synne which is forgeeuen vs

they on the other syde which haue deuyded them selues from the churche bring foorth allso their scriptures and defend the contrary opinion
hee that beleeueth and is baptised shall be saued
so god looued

the world that he gaue his only begotten sonne that euery ma that beleeueth yn him should not peris he but haue lyfe euerlasti~g
doo manfully and feare not at the sight of them
doo manfully and thy hart shalbe

comfortyd
saye yee vnto the cowardes

be yee of good chere feare not
putt on you all the armour of god that yee may resist yn the euyl daye
vvhom resist you being strong yn faythe
hee hath sent his sonne yn

to the world that wee should liue throwgh

him
godd shewyd foorth his loue towardes vs in that that when wee were yet sinners christ was doon to deathe for vs

the lord gouerneth me and shall want nothing

if walke yn the middes of the shadow of death will feare no euill because

thow art with me
the lord is the protector of my lyffe of whom should bee

affrayed in thee lord haue trusted shall neuer be confownded
sure am that

neither deathe nor lyfe nor angels nor anny other creature can seperatt me from the looue of god

all that my father geeueth me shall

come vnto me and him that cometh to me will not cast foorthe
vvhoo so euer callyth

on the name of the lord shal be sauyd
all that is borne of god ouercometh the

world and this is our victory which ouercometh the world our fayth
these be the

scriptures which brentius bryngeth to confirme his assurednes and vayne suerty by
yett they be suche as you shall sooner drawe foorth mylke of a poomisse stone then owt of the the thing which bre~tius seeketh

you see now how owld a practys this hath been of heretikes to glory yn the woord of god sins it was vsed euen yn the dayes of hieremy and ezechiel
but what euen soone after the coomyng of chryst was not that deuyse allso putt yn vre vvell knowen is that storye of the gospell

wher in it is wrytten howe christ so soone as he was baptised was ledd by the spiryt ynto the wildernes and was there tempted of the deuill
but with what other weapons did he assault christ but with the very scriptures

the euangelyst mathew sayth
the

diuell sett him on the pinacle of the temple and sayd vnto him
if thow be the sonne of god throwe thy self downe
for it is written he hath geeuen his angelles

charge of thee that they shall take thee yn their handes lest thow hurt thy foote ageinst soome stone which place ambrose treating of prouidently warnyth

vs saieng

learne here allso for the diuell transsormyth him self yn to an angell of light and of the diuyne scriptures the selues makyth ofte tymes snares to inta~gle the

faith full
so dooth the heretike so dooth hee

ripp vp the faith so dooth hee assault the lawes of pietye
therfore lett not the heretike deceyue thee because he can bring foorth some exa~ples of scripture lett hi not stande much in his owne conceyte because he hath some shew of learning for the diuell allso vseth the testimonye of the scriptures not to teache but to cumpas and deceiue

very excellenty allso doth vincentius

lirynensis a writer allso in the dayes of ambrose handle that place yn that his goulden booke which hee intitules for the antiquitee and vniuersalyte of the catholyke faythe
will the more at large repete his wordes because they are worthy not only to be read but to be lernyd without booke

here sayth hee some man will perhaps

aske whither heretikes doo allso vse the testimony of the scriptures
they doo sure and that vehemently for youe shall see the fllee throwgh euery volume of the holly lawe throwgh moyses the bookes of the kinges the psalmes apostles euangelystes and prophettes
for be it emong their famyliers or straungers in priuatt or in publyke yn their

sermons or bookes at feastes or yn the streates they neuer vtter anny thing of their owne but they seeke to ouer shadow it with some wordes of the scripture
reade the workes of paulus samosatenus priscillianus

eunomius iouinianus and the rest of the pestilent heretikes and thou shallt fynde there an infynitt heape of examples and almost no one half leafe omitted which is not paynted and coloured with sentences of the newe and ould testament
but looke now myche the more couertly they lurke vnder the shadowe of gods word so myche the more must thow feare and be ware of them
for they knowe their vnsauery fylthe would hardly at the first please any man therefore do they sprinckle it ouer as with a certayn sweet spyce of gods word to the end that he which easely would fynd and reiect the errours of men may yett forbeare to contemne that which semeth to be drawen out of the word of god
therefore as they which geue vnto children some bytter drynckes do first annoynt the brimmes of the cuppes with hunny wherby their vnskilfull childishenes hauing fore tasted the sweett feareth

not the bitter
and as they which vtter vnholsome drogges of seedes and liquors vnder colour and names of medicynes whereby he that fyndeth written theron the name of a medicyne suspectyth not the poyson euen so do heretikes

and heerof did also our sauiour hym self forewarne vs crieng out vnto the people

beeye ware of faulse prophetts which come vnto you in sheepes clothing and are with in raueni~g wolues
vvhat other thing is this sheps clothi~g but the wordes vtteryd by the prophets and the apostles which they with playne and symple sinceryte did worke as it were fleses to that vnspotted la~be which taketh away the sinnes of the world

and what other be those rauening

wolues but the fell and greedy wittes of heretikes which do allwayes trouble and assaylle the foulde of his churche and teare in pieces his flocke by all meanes they can but the more craftely to steale vpon the selly shepe keeping styll their woluish feersenes they lay asyde their woluishe shape

and wrap them selues yn the sentences of gods word as it were in certayne fleeses that when one feelyth the softnes of their woll he should not feare the sharpnes of their teethe

but what sayeth our sauiour by their fruicts youe shal knowe them
that is to saye when they begyn not only to vtter the diuin wordes but also to laye them abroade not only to vawnt therof but allso to interprett and expownd the same then lo is perceiued that bitter that sower that rage then doth the ayre of the nue poyson breathe foorthe then are opened prophane noueltyes
then maiest thow behowld the hedge cutt down the awncyent bowndes of the fathers caryed awaye the catholyke faith troden downe and the doctrine of the churche torne in pieces

suche are they whom the apostle pawll streeketh at in his second epistle to the corinthians saying suche false apostles

leeke subtyll workmen transformed them selues into the leeknes of the apostles of christ
what meanyth that how did they transforme them selues in to the apostles of

christ the apostles browght foorth examples owt of the lawe of god
so did they allso
the apostles vouched the saienges of the prophettes so did they to

but when they beganne to expound leeke textes with vnleeke and farre contrary interpretations then were the playn dealers discernyd from the crafty the naturall from the paynted the right from the peruers and finally the true apostles from the false and

no maruaill sayth he for sathan transformyth him self into an aungell of light then is it no greate matter for his ministers to transforme them selues into the leeknes of the ministres of iustice
therfor according to the teaching of the apostle pawll when so euer false prophettes or false doctors vouche the sentences of the lawe of god by the wrong interpretation wherof they labour

to buyld vp their errors it is not to be doubted but they followe the subtill deuises of their auctor the diuell which doubtles he would neuer haue inuentyd had he not found that same of all other to be the easyest waye to deceyue
that where he would induce couertly a wycked and pernicious errour

there to holde forth the auctoritie of gods worde

but some man perchaunce will aske me howe proue youe that the diuell vseth to vouche the scriptures
lett him saye reade the ghospell wherin it is written
then

the diuell toke him vp that is to saye our lord and sauiour and sett him vpon apynnacle of the temple and sayde vnto him
if thou be the sonne of god throwe thy self downe
for it is written he hath geuen his aungells charge of thee that they keepe thee in all thy wayes
they shal take thee in their handes lest thow happ to dashe thy foote against some stone
vvhat will this fellowe do to vs wretchyd men who did with testimonies of scriptures geue the onsett euen to the very lord of maiestye him self if thow be sayth he the sonne of god throwe thy self downe why for it is written saith he

the doctrine of this place is especially to

be marked and remembred that when we see any man with suche an example of euangelicall auctorite bringe foorth the wordes of the apostles and prophettes against the

catholyke fayth wee nede not to doubt but it is the diuell that speakyth by him
for eue as then the head spake vnto the head euen soo do now the lymmes speake vnto the lymmes that is to saye the lymmes of the diuell to the lymmes and me~bres of christ the traytorous to the faithful churche robbers to the religious and finally heretikes to catholikes

but what sayth he if thow be the sonne of god throwe thy self downe
that is wilt thou be the sonne of god and receiue the inheritaunce of the heauenly kingdom then throwe thy self downe that is from this high churche which is reputed the churche of god and from the doctryne and tradition therof throwe thy self downe
and if you aske one of these heretikes that perswadeth suche things to himself how pro}ue you or how will you teache vs that we ought to forsake and lett goe the vniuersall and au~cie~t faith of the catholike churche by and by for it is written sayth he
and therwith all he presently getteth him a thowza~d witnesses examples and auctorities owt of the lawe the psalmes the apostles and prophettes

wherwith beyng expou~ded after a newe and lewd sorte the vnhappy soule is throwen downe headlong from the high tower of the catholike churche into the bottomles pitt of heresies
then with syche promises as followe do heretikes vse wo~derfully to abuse suche as be not heedfull and ware
for they will not stick to promesse and teache that in their churche that is in the conuenticles of

their co~munio the great and especiall grace of god is personally present yea so as without any labor studye or industrie although they neuer aske seeke or knocke yf they be of their number and sect it is so from god him self dispe~sed vnto them that they being holden vp with the handes of aungells that is kept with angelicall protection can neuer hurt their foote against any stone can neuer offend or fall into any errour

thus farre vincentius

and coulde he possibly with more notable markes haue painted foorth the heretikes of our age the in this place wee see he hath done for what doth satha more earnestly attempt by the then to persuade me to throwe the~selues downe to let the~selues fawll from

the doctrine and tradition of this high churche which christ callyth the citee

builded on a hyll vvhich thing so soone as he hath once perswaded the hath he atteynid the vndoubted victorye
for vntill a

man throwe him selffrom that high cite yn vayn are all the attemptes of sathan
but so soone as he letteth him self fawll downe from thence so soone as he is departyd from the fowld and seuerith him self from the rest of the flocke then is he immediatly becoome a praye to the wolf
to this one end therfore doth the diuell bend all his force that he may leade men to throwe them selues downe from the high and infallible doctrine of the church
to sett nowght by the traditions therof to followe and esteme rather the priuatt spiritt of them selues or of any one man then the interpretatio and consent of the catholike and vniuersall churche wher vnto is promysed the spiritt of truth

neither is he without scripture wherby he indeuoureth to persuade the same
for it is written sayth he walke not in the

precepts of your fathers
in vayne doo they

worship me teaching the doctrines and co~maundements

of men
that yf in any one thing he may persuade a ma to throwe him self downe to departe from the precepts and ordonau~ces of his forefathers and from the doctrine and traditio~s of the churche then hath he wonne him within his reache then doth he easely fynd the meanes that he shal daily throwe him self downe deeper
neither is there any doctrine the so farre wyde from all pietye or godlynes wherin he doth not easely stayne and infect his mynd
in this one thing therfore doth he spend his whole studye and trauaill to accustome men to throwe them selues downe and not to make any accompt of the sence and generall co~sent of the whole churche but especyally to resist and withstand the ordonaunces therof

vvhich thing as of all other heretikes

so martiu luther their capitaine and standard bearer in this our age wee see dillige~tly and very handsomly practysed
for what other thing soundeth he in all his wrytings but that men should throwe them selues downe that they should cutt them selues from the churche resist the decrees therof

and what so euer shee commaundeth in despight

to doo the contrary

as for example
the churche co~maundeth thee to fast in the lent and toward the feast of easter to confesse thy sinnes and to come to the receauing of the sacrame~t but

what sayth luther to this thus he sayeth

because it is so appoynted by the churche

for the self same cause will not doo it and yf it had not commaunded me would haue doon it but will now doo it at some other tyme which the churche hath not appoynted at what tyme and in what sorte so euer myne owne free will shall moue me

likewyse the eleuation of the saerame~t he thinketh a thing indifferent but bicause the churche hath thowght good it should be lift vp therfore in despite of the churche he teacheth it must be forborne
ageyn to receyue the sacrame~t in one or bothe kyndes in many places he writeth to be indifferent for that nothing is commaunded therof by any precept of god as of necessitee yet in his booke which he intituled of the foorme of the masse he sayeth

yf by chawnce the councell should so

decree then would wee not receyue yt in

bothe kyndes but in despight of the cou~cell vse only the one kynd or neither of bothe and not bothe and holde them for accursed that by the auctoritee of the councell should vse bothe

but what doth a councell represent but the churche sathan therfore by this his not obscure member commaundeth to do all thinges contrary to the decrees therof yea and that yn despight of the same and by that his worthy lymme yet cryeth
throwe thy self downe
and doth not he throwe him self downe who followeth not that which is vniuersall catholyke receiued and allowed by generall consent of the whole world which professeth the name of christ but more willingly reposeth him self in that which some one fantastycall man hath better leekyd vvho albeit he be perhapps reputed circumspect and discrete yett when he speakyth of hi self vttereth nowght ells as

the truthe it self bearyth witnes but a very lye
for maye a man more throwe him self downe then to slippe from that sence and vndersta~nding which is vniuersall and common

to all vnto that which is but priuatt that is from trowth to fashed which man vtterith whe so euer he speaketh of himself

the very same song therfore which the diuell himself songe vnto christ in the desert the same doth he euen now sing by his members to christians
neither doth he vrge any thing more then that they should throwe themselues downe and lett goe the

vniuersall and auncient faith of the catholyke churche
he promyseth by his membres and yet still teacheth that in the congregations of his communion there is a certain great peculiar and personall grace of god

he persuadeth the vnlerned yf a man

imbrace the priuatt and especyall faith of his members that he though he be not only vtterly voyde of good workes but allso drowned in all kynd of wickednes must yett be well assured he is in state of grace and that the aungells shall one daye take him vp in their handes and leade him straight to heauen that beyng preserued by their protection he shall not once hurt his foote against any stone but standeth highly in gods fauour yf he continewe to the end
this he

will haue his me~bers to make so full and assured accompt of that they must thinke there can be no greater synne or wickednes committed then once to doubt neuer so litle therof which persuasion is co~mon to all heretikes
for the lutherans doo no lesse

carnestly exact this of their followers then do the zwinglians and anabaptistes of theirs when in the meane tyme fyer and water do not more disagree then the doctrines of these men do one from an other so as it ca~not be by any reason but some of them are leekly rather by the handes of diuells to be throwen into the bottomles pyt of hell· then that the aungells of heauen wil vouchfafe to help them vp to heauen
vvho when they haue all a leeke cutt them selues of voluntarely from the body of christ that the heauenly aungells haue then nothing to doo with them it is more certayn then that it may be doubted of
now therfore haue wee seen how sathan assaulted christ with the expresse word of god

and hath he not doon the same also by his lymmes me~bers agai~st the same christ the sonne of god did he not labour by the

expresse word of god to shew that christ was not only no prophett but allso worthy to dye wee reade in the gospell that when the iewes heard the word of christ some sayd

this is a pro}phet some others this is christ yett were there not some emong them that sayd what shall christ come owt of galilee doth not the scripture saye christ cometh of the seed of dauid and foorth of the castle of bethleem where dauid was

the phariseys allso said to nicodemus searche the scriptures and see that owt of galilee shall aryse no prophette
yett not

content therwith by the scriptures which they browght foorth to denye him to be a prophett they cryed out farther saying vve

haue a lawe and by that lawe he owght to dye because he hath made himself the sonne of god

vvho will not be astonyed when he readeth these thinges the membres of the diuell browght foorth the lawe and the prophetts against the very auctor and lord of the lawe and the prophetts
and as to them it seemed proued by the expresse word of god he was not only not a prophett but one

worthy of death as a wicked transgressor of the lawe
so that if against christ him self when he yett walked emong men ther was so earnest fyghting not only by the diuel him self but by his members allso and that with the very sworde of the scriptures what shall wee thinke may not be doon against vs selly men or what will not sathan presume and not hope to co~passe which thought assuredly he could euen by the very scriptures teache that christ not only was no prophett but also worthy of death

nowe therfor is this made playne that the diuell feared not euen with the weapons of scripture to assault christ the sonne of god lyuing here on earth and looke what sence he drewe foorth therof that would he haue to be take for the expresse word of god

but what did he not euen with the same tooles sett on the apostles yes· and that very sore
for what ells shewe these wordes of

of pawll suche fauls apostles are subtyll workmen tra~sfiguring themselues into the apostles of christ
and no marueill
for euen sathan transfigurith him self in to an aungell of light
it is not myche therfore if

his ministers transforme them selues in to the leeknes of the ministers of iustice
how properly pawll heer paynteth owt the fauls apostles of his tyme they woldyn no wyse seeme to preache ay other thing then christ and the gospell
but as the heretikes of our age woold pull from the churche

the catholike doctryn so woold they haue doon the name of the gospell from pawlls preaching and woold seeme to arrogat the same vnto them selues

dooth not pawll openly signifie this whe he thus wryteth vnto the galathians marueyll you are so sone caryed away from him which caullyd you vnto the grace of christ yn to an other gospell which is but one not diuers
only some there be which trooble you and woold turne the gospell of christ
vvhich place iohn chrisostom the true and faythfull interpreter of pawll

expownding saieth

suche is the slaight of the diuell not to laye open the snares wherin hee seekyth to cache and intangle men
for if they had sayd departe from christ yee galathians they wold haue auoyded the as wicked and corrupt deceauers but now

suffring them as it were to remayne in their faith and in the meane tyme couering their frawd with the name of the gospell the vnderminers without any daunger with great bouldnes vndermined the house whil by the spreding of these veyls their right names wer couered
sins therfor they termyd their fraud the gospel pawl also striueth against the name etc

you see now howe eue at that

tyme as in this our age some cloked their deceyt with the name of the gospell and called their frawde the gospel
that which they taught and not which pawll preached they would haue to seeme the gospell and with this honest prete~ce casting a colour before men they labored to crepe into their myndes so doth sathan to snare me alwayes vse some shrowd and doth not streight waye to vse the phrase of the co~mo people shewe

his hornes but layeth the forthe name of hol+ly scripture of the word of god of the gospell that he may the more easely drawe men before they beware in to his nettes
but it becomyth not faithful folcke by and by to be moued with suche masked sprittes nor if a man call his owne trechery the gospell

straight way for suche to repute it

the same pawll allso remembryth writing vnto the thessalonia~s that there were some which feared men by an epistle sent as it were from him as though the day of the lord were eue then at ha~d when yett by pawll no such thing had bene writte
but where as he in his former epistle to the had thus writ+ten

vve which lyue which remayne to the comyng of our lord shal not come befor them which haue slept to those his wordes they fastned that straunge sence which he neuer me~t
so allso eue whyle pawll yet lyued some were not affrayd to misconster his wordes
for thus peter the apostle writeth of

pawlls epistles
that some things therin be hard to be vnderstanded which vnlernyd

and wauering persons do depraue as they doo allso some other scriptures to their owne damnation
if then whyle pawll yet liued on the earth there were some found which turned and misconstrued his wordes what wonder is it if after so many ages past sins his death they haue been and yet be handled in lyke sorte

but what that was which vnlernyd and

wauering persons sowght in pawlls epistles

to peruert augustin teachith in that his booke which he intituled of faith and workes

for where pawll had writte wee thinke

man to be iustified by fayth without the workes of the lawe some lewde and vnlernyd persons sayth he so tooke these wordes that with a certayn wicked securitee and carelesnes they cast awaye both them selues and others whyle they gathered heerby that

to obteyn saluatio only faith suffised which thing he sayeth was the cause that the other apostolicall epistles of peter iohn ia+mes and iuda are chieffly bent and directyd against that opinio so as they very strongly buyld and mayntayn the co~trary
vvhich is that faith without workes proffitteth nothing

as pawll him self also teacheth
vvho defyneth not euery faith wherby wee beleeue yn god but that only to be the helthsome and true eua~gelical fayth which workyth

by loue
vvherby how litle or nothing that fayth auayleth which some thinke sufficient to saluation he so farre foorth shewyth that hee sayth if haue neuer so

myche fayth so as be able to remoue mountaynes owt of their places and yet haue not charitee am nothing
but wher this faith full charitee worketh ther no doubt is good life
for the fulnes of the lawe is charitee

thus farre augustyn

behould pray yow how owld this heresie is which sayth only faith is sufficient to saluation
for it sprang euen whill pawll yet leeuyd and was sought to be prouyd and mayntened eue by the expresse word of god vtteryd by that his elect vessell pawll the apostle when yett this was neuer the mynde of pawll but as saint peter

writeth some vnlernyd and vnconstant heades peruertyd the meanyng of his wordes
and what for gods loue dooth sathan ells now allso more earnestly seeke by his members to beate into the eares and myndes of men but that they should hold for suertye that only fayth suffiseth both to iustification and to saluacion

if peter then at that tyme complaynyd of the peruertyng of pawl his wordes how myche more would he now complayne when this most pestilent doctrine is with syche

vehemencye sett foorth when it is obtruded to the eares and eyes of men with these most pernicious wordes

that the gospell may not suffer to heare

any preaching of good workes
that the sheepe of christ quakyth when he hearyth them namyd of the preacher
that faythe may not abyde any good workes to stand nere her that they which are coueryd as it were with good workes can hardly enter into heauen for that workes following after iustification are vncleane

yea and the best good worke is very synne
that they are pestylent teachers and that it is a roote budding nowght but gawll owt of the newe testament to vexe consciences with workes and that there can not be together in the churche a teacher of fayth and of workes

this so vnpure and wicked doctrine yf peter should heare cloked with the name of the gospel yf pawl should heare these wicked men vawnt them selues that they had drawen this doctryne owt of his epistles wherin it appearyth he did so carefully recommend vnto vs good workes and stirre

vp all faithfull me to vse and embrace them what thinke wee would they bothe saye and doo therunto

but herofinowgh
for in this place wee mynded no more but to shewe that euen in the apostles tyme allso ther wanted not some which shrowded their lewde deceytes vnder the name of the ghospell and which of the very wordes of pawll by peruerting the sense therof fearyd not to professe and sett forward a contrary doctrine
so that if first against christ the very auctor of the scriptures sathan feared not to bring the scriptures and agai~st pawl him self to bring by his members pawll his owne wordes wrestyd into a reprobat sense who can myche merueil if in thies latter dayes he hathwith more impudence attemptyd the same

tertullian is a very owld writer not lo~g

after the apostles tyme
he wrote a notable booke of prescriptions against heretikes wherin he shewyth that this was a great word in their mouthe
seeke and yee shall fynd searche the scriptures
and therin he exhorteth the faythfull that they would yet make some end of their seeking and

therwith all preferryth fayth before trauail in the scriptures
in the end he vseth these wordes

of the scriptures doo heretikes taulk very

myche
to the scriptures they counsell vs as though they could not otherwise geue aduyse touching matters of fayth but owt of the lettres and wordes of faith
now therfore come wee to the purpose
for to this end did we direct and bend the entree of our taulke that euen here wee may ioyne vpon that poynt wher vnto our aduersaryes so earnestly call vs scripture they pretend and with this their bowld countenaunce they moue some very muche
but in the very conflict they wery the strong they take the weake and the indifferent they send awaye with scruple of mynd

then by and by he addeth what is to be

done to them whe they shrowd them selues vnder the scriptures

thus sayth he do wee at the first encownter stoppe them that in dede they are not to be admitted to any disputatio at all of the scriptures
that if their force lie in scripture we must knowe howe they come by it
therefore must wee see to

whom of right apperteyneth the possession of the scriptures to the end he be not allowed therunto to whom in no sorte it belongeth

and lest any should thinke he wrote thus as hauing mistrust in his cause he foorthwith goeth forward in this sort

this would not haue browght foorth for geuing suspicion of diffidence or of desier to haue any other the state of the cause if the case stood not so as heerin we owght obedience

to the apostle· who forbiddeth to enter into questions or to lend our eares to newe and straunge voyces
for an heretike sayeth the apostle must be taulked with after one reprehension not after disputation
for in this did the apostle forbid disputation in that he apoynted an heretike to be rebuked and in that respect only to be taulked with and that but once because he is

not to be esteemed as a christia
nor should be rebuked after the manner of a christian

once or twyse or by testimony of ij or iij witnesses but is a man therfore and in that respect to be rebuked for that he is suche a person as owght not to be disputed with
and

because allso conference of scriptures with

suche a one profitteth nothing but only stirreth

choler and troubleth the brayne

agayne this heresie admitteth not some scriptures and if it allowe some yet doth it peruert the same by some addition or detraction to the defending of that it would proue or yf it receyue some scriptures yet will it not receyue them full and whol
and if it doo yet will it turne them by inue~ting some newe and contrary exposition
no lesse ouerthwarteth the truthe a bastarde glose then a corrupted text
variable preiudices must nedes refuse to acknowledge those things wherby they are ouerthrowen
to those things they leane which either faulsly they haue patched together or haue bene occasioned of ambiguous wordes and doubtfull texts

vvhat shalt thow profit thowe that art best excersised in the scriptures when what so euer thow defendyst he shall denye and what so euer thow denyest he shall defend thow losest but thy voyce in contending with him and gainest nowght but vnquyetnes of mynd in hearing his blasphemyes

the partye if any suche be for whos sake

thow entrest into disputation by the scriptures to the end thow mayest confirme him in the trowthe ha~ging yet doubtfull is leeke inowgh to faull deeper in to heresies when he shall see thow hast profitted nothing the matter remayning in eue termes of defence and denyall
surely of this arguing to and fro he shall departe more vncertayn then he was before not knowing whether of the two is the heresie
but this argument may they also agayn retourne vnto vs
for it is necessary for them allso to saye that by vs the scripture is falsefyed that wee do wrongely expounde them and they therefore will nedes take vpo them to defend the trowth

vve must not therfore appeale to the scriptures wherin the victory is none at all or ells vncertayn or not very manifest
for albeit we supposed the conference of scriptures should not so faull owt betwene catholikes and heretikes that it should set vp both sydes a leeke yet the order of thinges required that this pointe should first be propownded which now lyeth only in

question
as to whom the very fayth belongeth whose be the scriptures fro whom

by whom when and to what teachers that doctrine was deliuered wherby wee are made christians

after the same sorte writeth clemens alexandrinus one that liued aboute that

time also
if sayth he they which followe heresies dare at any time vse the scriptures first they will neuer vse them all nor wholle nor as the very body and text of the scripture speaketh but choosing foorth those things which are ambiguous and doubtfull they turne them into their owne priuat opinion gathering here and ther a fewe wordes as it were flowers and not considering what is signified by them but only abusing the bare and naked termes
in euery word almost which they bring foorth you shal fynd them stickyng in the only names and termes and quyte swaruyng fro the significatio therof

vvhat could be written better or what more aptly to the matter now in hand then that which we fynd writte by that most lernyd ma tertullia he sheweth vs that the vsage of heretikes was to talke mych of the scripture to persuade by scripture and to holde foorth the scripture
but in the meane

tyme he admonissheth vs to stop them at that step and that they bee not admitted to any disputation of the scriptures for that they haue no interest or possession theryn sins the catholikes do prescribe in the possession therof

he allso bringeth for proofe herof the testimony of pawll who forbiddeth vs to wast tyme in co~tending with heretikes
for that allwayes debate breedyth debate and of argume~t groweth argume~t so as ther is lyke to be no end of brauling and co~te~tio wher a ma hopeth to ouercome obstinat persons by disputatio
for neither wa~t they wordes at any tyme and their frowardnesse geueth the courage neuer to be tyered with co~tention
so as it is farre better to auoyde all occasio~s of co~tending with them which is the thing they seeke and to refrayne brawlyng with them by disputation for so myche as therby is that owld prouerb often verefyed by to myche altercation the trowth is lost

but see whether those wordes written by tertullian that this heresie admitteth not some scriptures and so foorth as before be not very truly spoken of the heretikes of

our tyme the first fownder wher of did he

not praye you ope~ly vse the same hatchet to cut of the scriptures which were contrary to his purpose which tertullian sayth marcio the heretike did at that time vse

he taught only fayth to suffise both to our saluation and iustification
and seing that this his doctrine could not stand if the canonicall epistle of saint iames remayned in forse straight waye taking his hatchet in his hand he cut the same of from his booke saying this shall haue no place in my bibles
loe the imperious auctoritee of the man
he caullyth them his bibles wherby he shewyth they haue no fellowship with the bibles of the catholyke churche
hee tawght also prayers and sacrifice for the dead to be superfluous and herunto seing that parte of the scriptures to be directly contrary which for the more parte all the owld catholyke writers bring foorth of the machabees he katcheth ageyne his hatchet and cutetth of also that booke

he tawght farther that all things came to passe by a certayne absolute necessitee and that wee owght to be certayn and sure of

grace and saluation
against this his opinion maketh that which is written in the booke of wisedom and in ecclesiasticus
he therfore with his hatchet cutt of also these bookes
so wee see that those scriptures which serued not his purpose he receiued not but taking his hatchet in hand cut them out of his bibles

nowe those scriptures which he did receyue and allowe did he not by his additio~s and detractions peruert them to his owne priuat purposes making of good latyne lewd high dutche vvhich is layd to his charge not only by the catholikes but allso by the

sectaryes them selues
and yf he did receyue any scriptures whole and sound did he not deuise therunto strange or rather mere contrary expositions which thing we allso see doon by the rest of the heretikes who be no lesse diuers among them selues then contrary to the catholikes in expounding the scriptures which thing to haue lykewyse been doon by the heretikes of his tyme tertullian remembreth

from their owne rules sayth he them selues

do varye whilest euery of them do pype

after his owne volu~tary those things which he hath receiued euen as he that first deliuered the framed the same by his owne fancye

vvith such therfore as receiue no scriptures but suche as they leeke and those which they doo receyue wreast by addition and detraction to their owne purpose or ells deuyse therunto newe and straunge expositions tertullian willeth vs in no wyse to enter into disputation of the scriptures but commaundeth them to be sett ouer to the ecclesiasticall tradition

vvhich his mynde eue luther him self semeth to allowe when he hath to do with sacrame~taries and anabaptistes
but you shal heare his owne wordes
he sayeth

vvee haue read what the holy fathers did

in the councell of nice so sone as they heard the heresie of arius read they hissed it owt with one voyce and would not vouchesase to heare them that presented it nor suffer them to defend it but presently condemned them withowt any disputation as manifest blasphemers
moyses allso in his lawe commaunded

that suche false teachers should be stoned to death
euen so in this case ther is no disputatio to be vsed but suche manifest blasphemers

are to be condemned withowt pleading their cause

as pawle allso commaundeth in the third

chapiter of his epistle to titus that an heretike should be auoyded after one or two war+nings
he allso forbiddeth to timothee all

contentions and disputations as things which do nothing ells but trouble the hearers
for suche common articles of all christendom be now sufficiently heard declared and concluded by the writings and generall co~fession of all christendom
they are confirmed by many miracles sealed vp with myche bloud of many martyres defended by the bookes of al lerned men and not now needing any mans conning or deuise to enlarge them

yet is it not in all pointes trewe that this hyperbolicall doctour reporteth the holy fathers to haue done in that councell of nice as though they had condemned arrius vnheard or his cause vnexamined
for albeit there be extant in socrates and nicephorus an epistle of the cou~cell of nice to the churche of alexandria and to them which were in egipt libia and pe~tapolis in which they wryte that they would not indure so muche

as to heare the wicked opinion of arrius

the madnes of his mynd or his blasphemous wordes yet is it manifest ynough by the epistle of consta~tyne the emperour which euen there followeth fast after that his doctrine was dilligently viewed and considered
for

the emperour vseth these wordes all his sayings and writinges were diligently examined which by their dowbtfulnes or disagreement seemed to brede any pretence or colour

if all thinges were so diligently examined how was it then that arrius was not heard vvherfore that the fathers write they would not vouchesafe so myche as to heare his blasphemous wordes may be more rightly wnderstanded in this sence that after his doctrine was once thoroughly examined and yet he proceded in redoubling his blasphemous talke the fathers would not then vouchesafe to heare him any more but strake him with the sentence of curse and condemnation

for that he was heard socrates plainly shewyth when in the same place he writeth that the emperour signified to the people of

alexandria the determination of the faith

not to haue been simply or rashly made but with great examination and deliberation to haue been set foorth
not that some thinges only were spoken and some thinges past in silence but that what so euer was needfull to be set foorth for the confirmation of the doctryne were layde open and that it was not barely determined but first exactly enquired of and what so euer might geue occasio of dissencio or debate were so reiected that nothing cowld be sayd against them
therfore sayth he the emperour calleth

this concord and agreing sentence of the bisshopps in that synode the sentence of god and yeldeth thankes to the holy ghost for so great concord and vnite of mynde among so many fathers

sozomenus allso when he telleth vs that the bisshops there dillige~tly assembling the~+selues callyd foorth arrius and aduisedly

searched his propositions for they were very ware not to geeue an headlo~g or rashe sentence on either part dooth sufficiently declare vnto vs that arrius was heard but in dede after his cause was thorowghly examined it is leekly hee was not the suffred to

prate or talke any more

but this in the meane tyme is very true that as heretikes allwayes prouoked to dispu+tacion

and browght yn newe faythes so the catholykes lightly auoyded argume~tes and gladly reposed them selues in the faith of their fathers as among the writers of the ecclesiasticall storie

socrates

sozomenus

victor and

nicephorus wee may plainly see
looke in what matter so euer the decree of a councell had once take order that would the catholikes neuer permyt to be browght agayn in question

athanasius writeth that germinius auxentius valens vrsacius demophilus and gaius exhibited a certayn paper of their confession which they would haue had to be preferred before all the auncient councells
but what answer theru~to made the catholike fathers assembled at arimino

vve

said they assembled our selues hither not because wee lacked a fayth for that wee haue bothe pure and sownde but to confound the which gaynesaye the trouth and attempt newe thinges
yf therfore you now beginning as it were to beleue haue thus

written you are not to be accompted as any of the clergy but suche as now beginne to learne the first principles of the faith
and if you came hither with that minde as we did then let vs all agree let vs with curse conde~ne these heresies and hold fast that we haue receiued of our fathers to the end we may cut of

all occasio~s hereafter of keping councels since the fathers once already assembled in the cou~cell of nice haue by sure establisheme~t and sound determinatio preuentyd all farder questions

it seemed an absurd thing to those fathers that any newe fayth or confession of faith should then be brought foorth and that callyd back into questio which they had receiued of their fathers for which cause also in the epistle which they wrote to constantius the emperour he reporteth them to haue vsed these wordes

vve humbly beseeche your clemency with

benigne eares and fauorable countenaunce to behould our imbassadors and that you admitte not to the reproche of the dead any nouelty but suffer vs to remayne in the rules and decrees of our forefathers who we affirme

to haue doo althinges with great wisedo foresight and direction of the holy ghost

soothely these newe things which these men attempt do make the beleeuers to faynte in belefe and do stirre vnbeleuers to conte~pt of belefe
vvhat would these fathers do if they sawe now allmost euery citye of germany bring foorth their seuerall faith or co~fession therof and co~te~d to haue them allowed reiecting the faith of the fathers as though they were no christians can any thing be imagined more absurd or more wicked as though forsooth our fathers were ignora~t of the christia fayth and now at the last christ were to be knowen vnto vs by the meanes of some fewe such as be in deed traytors vnto christ vvherfore the opinion of luther in this pointe is to be comme~ded to witt that suche men are not to be heard but meete to be conde~ned without pleading their cause

yet looke what lawe he gaue to the sacramentaries and anabaptistes the same must him self stand vnto namely synce him self is he whom those men professe them selues to followe as their guyde and capitayne as the first auctor of this their departure

fro the churche and father of so many sectes as are now hard to bee nombred for looke

what augustin writeth to haue happened vnto donatus that as he sought to deuyde christ so was him self dayly deuyded in peecemeles by his disciples the very same doo wee now allso see happened vnto luther

hee laboured to deuyde the churche being christes mysticall body
and is not he him self leek wyse deuided os his followers by dayly hacking and mangling but to saye nothing of the sacramentaryes anabaptistes and campanes whom perhapps luther will denye to apperteyne to him are not melancthon brentius osiander and illyricus professed lutherans but what spitefull enmitye is ther emong them what bitter dissensions in matters of weyght

doo wee not heare melanctho complayne

that where hee wrote the confession of augspurg they now goo about to take from him the name and honour therof for the illyricans doo gredely challenge that to them selues and labour to exclude from the same the mela~cthonists with their maister whom as in diuers other things they shewe to haue

gone fro the mynd of his maister luther so doo they lowdly charge him in the doctryn of the sacrament to haue ioyned him self to caluin his lore
of which thing caluin him self also dooth not a lytle glory

now yn that matter which they will haue to bee the summe of the gospell which is os iustification lord how sore melancthon

and bre~tius dissent the one from the other while brentius defendeth osianders opinion which the melancthonistes thinke most execrable so amo~g the disciples of luther there is litle agreement of the principal doctrines of our religion wherof very contenciously they quarrell emong them selues and be as it were heretikes one to an other so as they neede not to be better blasoned then them selues blasone one an other

vvherfore of right luther must suffer by the lawe which him self gaue to others that there be no disputation allowed to the followers of his doctrine but that so sone as it apperith they be of that sort they bee presently co~demned vnheard
for it is no more trewe of the zuinglians then of the lutherans which is sayd by the disciples of luther

that they are to be restrayned not by writing but by the mace and power of the magistrate especially synce neither these

bringe almost any thing that was not more then a thousand yeres past condemned for heresie

but wee may seeme to haue wandered somwhat from our purpose
vvherfore let vs returne to the matter fro whence wee haue by occasion a litle declyned
vvee haue shewyd you before that eue at that tyme when that most auncient doctor tertullian floorisshed heretikes vsed to vau~t to talke and to holde foorth before them the scriptures and that tertullian doth vtterly forbid all disputation with them or triall of the controuersies to be referred to the scriptures but would haue the putt ouer to the tradition of the churche

but dooth not cyprian allso complayne of the deceyts of the diuell who transfigureth

him self as it were in to an aungell of light and suborneth his ministers leeke vnto the ministers of iustice teaching night for daye damnation for saluation desperation vnder the veyll of hoape infidellite

vnder pretence of fayth and finally antechrist vnder the name of christ that while they falsly report thinges not all together vnleekly they may by their subteltie chase and driue awaye the very truth it self

nothing could be sayd more trewly then

that which wee fynd to be written by cyrill all heretikes gather the occasions of their errour owt of the scripture inspired by god corrupting those thinges by their owne malice which by the holy ghost were well geuen and vttered and so kendling vpon their owne heddes an vnquenchable fier

augustin allso sayeth that heresies and

peruers doctrine intangling and throwing downe headlong the sowles of men in to cometh of none other grownd but whe thinges well written in the scriptures are not well vnderstanded and when that which is not well vndersta~ded is rashely and bouldly vtteryd for a truth

and therfore ambrose did thinke

good in this sort to describe heretikes

heretikes sayth he are they which by the very wordes of the lawe do impugne the lawe for they adde vnto the wordes of the lawe

their owne sence and vnderstanding that by the authorite of the lawe they may sett foorth the shrowdnes and malice of their owne mynd
for wickedness knowing authorite to weygh muche worketh her snares vnder the name therof to the end that sythens an yll thing by it self can not be acceptable it may be commended to the world vnder the name of a good thing

vvhen they which in the councell of carthage were by agrippinus assembled sayd it was no trewe baptisme which was

geuen by schismatikes and heretikes did they not saye they so found it in the holy scriptures and seemed to co~firme that their sentence by the expresse word of god this councell yet afterward by the auctoritte of the churche was disanulled

but let vs heare vincentius lirinensis

talke of that matter

so great excellency of witte sayth he was in those fathers suche flowing vaynes of eloquence suche a number of them that affirmed it so great leeklyhood of truthe in so many texts of the scripture but after a newe and yll sort vnderstanded that me thinke all their great agreement

conspiring in one could neuer haue been ouerthrowen yf only the profession of nouelty which was the only cause of all that great styrre so much then mayntayned defended and extolled had not discredyted the whole matter
they therfore were destitute not of textes and authoritees of scripture but of the trewe vnderstanding of them

vvherfore hilary doth very well

warne vs

remember sayth he that ther is no heretike but faulsly affirmeth that all the blasphemyes he vttereth are warrantyd by the auctoritee of scripture
for hereof marcion

when he readeth the word of god vnderstandeth it not
hereof photinus could

not fynd by his doctrine iesus christ to be a man herof sabellius when he could not vnderstand

this text my father and be all one could not fynd god the father nor god the sonne herof montanus by his madde

weemen went about to maynteyn a newe holy ghost
herof maniche and marcion hated

the lawe because they found it written the letter kylleth and the prince of the world is the diuell
they vtter all the scriptures

without sence and pretend fayth withowt faith
for the scriptures consist not in reading but in vnderstanding not in thwarting but in charitable consent and vnitee

vvhom hierom following in his booke

against the luciferians sayeth let not heretikes flatter them selues if they seeme to fynd somwhat in some chapiters of the scripture which they thinke co~firmeth their heresies since the diuell him self hath allso alleaged places owt of the scripture and the scriptures co~sist not in reading but in vndersta~ding
in leeke sort wryteth allso athanasius

of the arria~s

if sayth he me reading some goodwordes of the holy scripture written in these fellowes bookes will therfore by and by take blasphemies for blessinges it will allso come to passe that whe they see iues of this our tyme dilige~tly to read the lawe and the prophetes they will also with the iues denye christ
perhapps also hearing the maniches vouche certayne places of the gospells they will with them denye the lawe and the prophetes
but if throwgh ignorau~ce they do so boyll and babble let them learne out of the scriptures how the diuell him self the inuentour

and deuiser of heresies for feare of beyng bewrayed by his strong ayer vsurpeth allso thies wordes of the scripture to the end that shrowded therin hee may deceyue the simple so infectyd with his poyson
for so deceyued he eue so allso lead he other heretikes into error and euen so dooth he now persuade arrius that as it were vnder colour of talking leeke an aduersary against heresies he might the better deceyue him in foysting in his owne

chrysostom allso following athanasius

open arrius sayth he the sepulchre of thy throte filled with dead wordes for thou hast not yet that liuyng and quickening word which thow seekest to frame to the ma+yntenau~ce of thy reasons but he so soone as he is callyd maketh the entree of his talke with scriptures
but thow that art the faythfull fear not when thow hearest him bring in scripture for euen the diuell him self when he came to christ and tempted him bourded him with scripture saying if

thow be the sonne of god throwe thy self downe for it is written he hath geuen commaundement to his aungells that they shal

keepe thee in all thy wayes and shall hould thee vp with their handes

and it is well knowen that arrius

browght foorth fowrty places of the scripture to proue that the sonne was not of one substance with the father
and what did he and his followers crake euer of but of the scriptures the gospell and the expresse word of god to the scriptures he appealed and would not otherwyse be dealt with but only with the scriptures

maximinus when hee should enter in

to disputation with augustin prescribed this lawe vnto him that he should of necessite yeld to what so euer he should bring out of the scriptures
for thus he sayth

those wordes which are take out of the scripture faull not to vs by chau~ce synce the lord him self hath thus warned vs saying in vayne do they worship me teaching the preceptes

and commaundements of men

augustin allso writeth euen the leeke of the donatistes

as the diuell sayth he against the very lawemaker browght owt the very wordes of the lawe so ye by the wordes of the lawe accuse the men ye knowe

not and withsta~d the promisses of god which are geuen by the very wordes of the lawe

and a lytle after
you speake sayth he the wordes of the lawe but against whom you speake them youe marke not no more did the diuell when he vtteryd the wordes of the lawe knowe him to who he spake them
he would haue throwen downe our head which was ascending vpward but ye would contract to one lytle part the body of that head which is dispersed throwgh the whole earth

in leeke sort also dealt macedonius as

may be gathered by the sermon which gregorie nazeanzen wrote of the holy ghost

and so played nestorius for he thowght he

was able by the expresse word of god to shewe that mary the moother of ihesu was deliuered but of a bare man because in the canonicall scriptures shee was sometymes callyd the moother of ihesu but neuer the mother of god

leekwyse eutiches whe he denyed ij natures

to be in christ seemed therin to leane to the expresse woord of god and asked of the catholykes
in what scripture those ij natures

appeared haue not learnyd owt of the

holy scriptures any suche ii natures and of suche thinges must wee make searche only in the holy scriptures which are of more force then the doctrines and expositions of the fathers

but what needyth in a manifest thing to vse moe wordes when nothing can be

more truly sayd then is written by augustine
errour could not spring cloked vnder the name of christ but of the scriptures not well vnderstanded neither dare the diuell attempt any other waye but by the diuine scriptures as wee reade in orige
vvho whe he had brought foorth the diuell alleaging those wordes of the psalme they shall hould the vp with their handes

how comith it to passe sathan sayth he

that thow knowest thies thinges to be written hast thou read the prophetes or knowest thow the scriptures though thow hould thy peace will answer for the thou hast read them not that by the reading of holy things thy self wouldest become better but that by the bare letter thow mightest kyll the fre~des therof
thow knowest that yf thowe shouldest

speake out of any other bookes thow coul dest not deceyue neither could thy allegations haue any authoritee
so did marcion read the scriptures as did the diuel so basilides so valentinus that with the diuel they

might saye vnto our sauiour it is writte etc
yf any tyme therefore thou here testimonyes browght owt of the scripture take hede thou do not by and by repose thy self on the speaker but co~sider him well what he is of what mind and dispositio lest happely he faine him self holy and be not so in dede and lest the woulse infectyd with the poyson of heresy lye shrowdyd vnder a shippes skin or lest the diuel speake scripture out of him

this admonition of origen is so depely to be layd vp in our mynd that at no tyme it go owt therof that when wee heare one bring foorth the scriptures or glory of the expresse word of god wee do not by and by beleaue euery suche kynd of sprite
be the lutherans only they in this our age trowe yee which so confidently beate our eares with their continuall boasting of the word of god doo not the sacramentaries with as great or greater assurednes arrogat the same vnto

themselues vvherunto doth caluin appeale but vnto the scriptures when he hath to do with the lutherans vvhat can he beare more vnpacyently then when both by the christians and lutherans he seeth obiected against him the auctoritee of the fathers and councels

vvhen the magdeburgenses wrote wee are coo~mawnded from god to heare the sonne of god caluin ansvereth them in this sort

maliciously and wickedly doo they obiect to vs the auctoritee of christ as though

our mynd were one iote to declyne from his pure and syncere doctryne whoo haue allwayes shewyd our selues in very deed with no lesse reuerence to receiue what so euer hath issued out of the diuyne mowth of the lord then they yn wordes doo boast on their part
lett therfore the sonne of god be vnto vs without all co~trouersy the chieff most perfytt and only maister in whose doctrine it may not bee laufull to alter one worde or sillable
but the obedye~ce of the fayth dooth not lett but that wee may bee attentiue to the sownd vnderstanding of his wordes

loo as wicked and blasphemous as caluin

is yet may he indure nothing worse then to be charged that he geueth not eare to the sonne of god or declyneth any thing fro his pure and syncere doctrine
but what do the anabaptistes with any lesse courage stande also vpon that poynt no truly
for beholde howe one of them as we haue read talked vnto the heaue~ly father in this sort

certainly can not herin be deceiued
thy word heauenly father haue beleued that receyued of the holy ghost as the sure word of truth and a litle after knowe assuredly sayd he that this my doctrine which is the word of god in the daye of vpright iudgeme~t shall not only iudge lordes kinges and the whole world but allso the angells them selues

doth not this honest man thinke him selfe as sure that his doctrine is the expresse woord of god as luther or caluin and yett for all that both his luthers and caluines are in deed the expresse worde of the diuell
but whereto in the end cometh this geare strawnge and wonderfull it is
for lo whyle in this sort euery sect seeketh to vsurpe vnto it self alone the word of god and the true vnderstanding therof there is sprong

vp a certayne newe kind of prophets which

feare not eue by the auctoritee of the scriptures to withdraw all auctoritee from the scriptures
lo wher to at last sathan hath brought this reckening
forsooth to this that he hath drawe wretched men to that passe that looke what doctrine euery of the hath by chaunce imbracyd the same should he firmly persuade him selfe to be the expresse worde of god and not suffer him self by any reasons to be drawen from it
now therfore this is apparant that neuer almost was ther any heretike which did not co~firme his errour by the scripture and which affirmed not his opinion to be the very word of god
the thing it self so she wyth this that farther demonstration needith not but yet the chief of all heretikes of this our age doth also testifie the same who writeth that the holy scripture hath now at the last obteynid this name to be caullyd the heretikes booke because all heresies deryue their course and origi nal spring fro thence
but to what end is this will some man saye doo you go about to extenuat the word of god and to withdrawe auctoritee from it haue you browght vs

foorth so many thinges to the end to shewe that who so euer vseth the testimony of the scripture is an heretike no god forbid that wee should so myche as thinke a thing so straunge and vnsitting for any christian man

no wee rather saye as hillary whilom

did heresye is in the vnderstanding not in the scripture
the sence not the text is blamed

nothing is more holy then the scripture nothing of more auctorite nothing next god more worthy of all honour
but what thing ca be so holy which the enemie of man kind abuseth not to the destruction of man vvee must not thinke that god alwayes openeth their mowthes who wee heare talke of the word of god and alleage the words of the scripture
the most learned origen did well

note to vs that not seldo the diuel also openeth the mowth of syche as vtter the word of god who speaketh alye sayth he it is cer

tayne the diuel openeth his mowth to vtter a lye but thow wilt saye how may he lye that bringeth foorth the testimony of the scriptures which no good man doubteth to haue proceded fro the holy ghost the spirit

of truth and from whom floweth all truthe short and redy is the aunswer hereunto in the scriptures themselues which we knowe to haue ben inspired from god aboue ther can in deed be no lye
but in the sence which man bringeth of whom it is written euery man is a lyar hee that will saye there can

not be a lye what doth he ells but denye the saying of god and as it were charge the holy ghost of vntruth

vvhat then will soome man saye yf euery man bee a lyar dooth it therfore followe that what so euer a man speaketh what so euer hee bryngeth owt of the holy scripture should therfore be a lye god forbidd saye not so

how shall then knowe when hee vtteryth a lye this will the very truth teache vs which can not lye
for that sayeth whoo

so euer vtteryth a lye vtteryth of his owne
no man hath of his owne but synne and vntrouth but yf a ma haue any point of trouth or righteousnes that hath hee of god
hee therfore speakyth the truth which vtteryth not that is of him self but of god

but thow wilt saye agayne speakyth he

not fro god which recyteth the very words of god and the testimonies of the scriptures yow haue heard now not only once but often opened vnto yow by me that the diuel also alleageth testimonies of the scriptures and yet doth he not therfore speake the truth because he speaketh of his owne
vvhat is this speaking of his owne it is when he bryngeth his owne sence of the scripture and not the sence and meaning of god
for this is to bean heretike as before we taught out of ambrose to buyld his owne sence vpon the wordes of the lawe and so by the wordes of the lawe to impugne the lawe

but how shall discerne when a man bryngeth his owne sence and when the true sence and meaning of god this will that notable

doctour of the church augustine teache vs

who in this sort speaketh vnto god thy truthe lorde is neither myne nor

his or his but common to vs all whom thow doost openly call to the communion therof terribly warning vs that we presume not to make the same priuat lest wee be depriued therof
for who so euer doth challenge as proper to him self that which thow hast

geeuen foorth to bee enioyed of all and will make that his owne peculiar which is common to all hee is throwen downe from that which is common to his owne that is to saye from truth to vntruth for hee that maketh a lye speaketh of his owne

doest thow now vnderstand whoo speaketh

of his owne that is to saye whoo speaketh vntrought truth thow seest is not his or his but is common to all
all hath god caullyd publikely to the communion therof
vvho so euer therfore maketh priuatt that is publyke whoo so euer challengith to him self and co~tenciously will make his owne proper that which by charitee is commo to all hee speakith of him self hee speakith an vntrouth
for truth is not any wher ells but among

all that is to saye in the catholike or vniuersall churche

therfore whoo so euer seekith owt any singular vnderstanding or inuenteth any strange and vnknowen expositions or bringeth to the world any newe and singuler opinions though hee shewe six hundreth testimonyes of the scriptures because hee vndersta~deth them not with that sence wich

is receiued of the catholike churche but ioyneth therunto his owne proper and priuat exposition he speaketh of him self and therfore speaketh an vntrouth for the truth is not with any one but with all that is to saye in the catholike churche wherunto the light of sownd and true vnderstanding of the scriptures is promysed of almighty god

so as there can be no surer argument that a man speaketh his owne that is a lye then when he departeth from the sence exposition and consent of the churche for the althowgh he bring neuer so many texts of the scripture hee may vtter in dede the expresse word of the diuell but neuer can he in that sorte bring foorth the expresse and pure worde of god
for it is as certayn that the diuel openeth the mowth of them which teache gods word being owt of the churche as that god him self openeth the mowthes of them which beyng of and with in the churche doo vtter the same
and this is the cause that when so euer ther is in the church memory made of an eua~gelist or any other notable doctour that both in the

entry of the masse and in the canonicall howres this text of ecclesiasticus is read

in the midle of the churche he opened his mowth vvherby is signifyed that god openeth the mowth to no ma vnlesse he be with in the churche
from the true sence and vnderstanding wherof who so euer differeth his mowth not god but the diuell doth open

how famous so euer any doctour of the churche bee yet yf he be not with in the churche if he consent not with the sence of the churche it is certayn that god opened not his mowth
but yf any man speake co~trary to the sence and consent therof wee need not doubt to saye that the diuell opened his mowth
vvho so euer therfore vttereth his owne vttereth a lye and he that speaketh of god speaketh the truth but he speaketh of god which vttereth the scriptures not at aduenture or by his owne priuat sence but with the sence that is common to all that is with the sence of the catholyke churche

and that is it which is truly and properly

caullyd the word of god when to the wordes of the scripture not our owr owne

sence but the commo sence that is the sence of the catholike churche is applyed which to be the very trewe sence and meaning of god is not to bee doubted

for thus wee reade noted by socrates that the emperour constantine calleth the sentence of all them which were assembled in

the councell of nice the sentence of god
for the voyce of the church is the voyce of god

speaking by her
he therfore is a catholike and a right beleuer and syche as can by no meanes vtter vntruth which being mindfull of that is written woo be vnto foolishe prophetts which followe their owne spirite and see nothing followeth not his owne but the spirit of the churche not his owne imagination or conceyte but the sence and consent of the churche
yea thowgh the wordes of the scripture should seeme not very open and playne which syche a one bryngeth foorth yet because he produceth them with the sentence of the churche he vttereth the very worde of god

but if a man will applye therunto his

owne proper conceyte if he will temper the scriptures with his owne imagination for

he ioineth his owne sence to the scriptures which contendeth so earnestly not for the true vnderstanding of the diuine scriptures but for his owne that he will haue that to bee the scriptures which is his when he owght rather to make that his which is the scriptures yf saye he obstinatly defend

syche his sentence against the common sence and co~sent of the whole churche he is an heretike and a schismatike and bring he neuer so many testimonies of the scriptures yet he vttereth not the pure word of god but the expresse worde of the diuell
ther is therfore no authoritee taken from the scriptures when it is sayd that heresies spring not so myche of them as of the lewde and faulse vnderstanding of them

this is an owld complaynte made by

basill that the deprauers of the truth doo not applye their vnderstanding to the scripture but violentlye drawe the mynd of the scriptures to their owne will

but notable is the counsell of clement that when the lawe of god is read it bee not read or tawght

according to the vnderstanding of a mans owne brayne for there are many thinges in

the diuine scriptures which may with force bee drawen to syche sence as eche man shall fancye to him self
and therfore sayth he must we learne the vnderstanding of the scriptures of him which keepeth them being orderly deliured vnto him by his forefathers according to the truth

vvhich counsell rufinus writeth those

ij lights of grece basill the great and gregory nazia~zene to haue followed
vvho whe they gaue them selues to the only study of the scriptures remouing from them al other secular bookes of greke writers they followed not in seeking the true vnderstanding therof their owne fanceys but the writings and authoritee of the fathers whom they allso knewe to haue learnyd that rule of trewe vnderstanding from the apostolike succession

but how farre do they differ fro the dealing of these fathers who rashly faull them selues to the wayghing of euery scripture and beleeue it according to their owne iudgement not passing at al vpon the sence exposition of the fathers to wbom they thinke it iniurious to be put ouer but what

may bee sayd more rightly to these men by vs then that which wee reade to haue been sayde to the manichees by augustin

yow see sayth he your dealing tendith to this end that all auctoritee bee take from the scriptures and that euery mans priuat mynde should tell him what were in eche scripture to be allowed and what to be disallowed
that is in effect that the mynde should not by faith bee subiect to the auctoritee of the scriptures but should make the scriptures subiect to the fancye of the mynd
so as nothing pleaseth him because it is found written and receiued with high and great auctoritee but therfore it seemeth well written because in some respect it pleaseth his fancye
vvherunto doest thow committe thy self thow wretched and frayle sowle all wrapped in cloudes of the fleshe vvherunto doest thow committe thy self

maye wee not well saye also to these men where bestowest thow thy self thow miserable and wretchyd sowlle wrapped in cloudes of fleshe vvhere bestowest thow thy self vvilt thow haue that what so euer pleaseth thee wee should take for scripture and

howld that for the pure and expresse word of god and why not that which hath semed good to al that is to the vniuersal churche

vvhat an intollerable pryde is this vvhat an arrogancy and swelling of the mynde

vvilt thow so challenge to thy self alone the spirit of god and so pull it from all others that what so euer sense thow wilt bring owt of the scriptures wee showld bee bound to beleue that neglecting the sence and vnderstanding of the whole churche can there be a greater arrogancy or a greater tiranny then this

it pleased fryer luther it leekyd him that

this or that scripture shoold haue this or that sence vvhat so euer therfore hath been deliuered fro the fathers what so euer hath been establisshed by aucthorite of councells what so euer hath been receyued and allowed by the continuall practise of the whole churche all that must wee despyse reiect and howld for vayne

neither must suche a multitude greatnes depthe largenesse miracles or hollinesse of so many sainctes of the churche mooue a ma one iote but that sense which hee interpreteth wee must not

dowbt to haue been the very sense and meaning of the holly ghost

and that which the catholikes haue tawght which the auctoritee of the churche hath deliuered which all christian people

haue so many hundreth yeeres imbracyd which schooles defend and mainteyne all that wee must thinke to be the deadly poyson of sathan

how trewly is it sayd of pawll knowledge

puffith vp and charitee edifieth thowgh in deed opinyo of knowledge rather puffith vp then knowledge it self
for if these fellowes had but one cromme of charitee in them could they so swell with pryde to thinke all men in respect of them selues to be blynd foolish blockish and ignoraunt

but eue as wyne if it be not delayed with water dooth trouble the mynd eue so knowledge yf it bee not temperyd with charitee doth with a certayne pryde and ouerturning make a man as it were dronke or rather starke pawll doth very well adde thus but yf a ma thi~ke him

self to knowe myche he hath not yett learned

in what sort he should knowe
for yf he had he would neuer with the opinion of his owne knowleage haue growen so insolent to preferre him self before all others and as it were from an high to looke downe vpon them
for the beginning of trewe knowleage is the knowleage of god which breedeth in vs humillitie and submission and dooth rather deiect then by pryde erect the mynd of man
and wher so great pryde is as we see is in these men what can there be ells in them then in deed a very ignoraunce and not knowing of god

but pawll teacheth vs in an other

place by what meane wee should learne rightly to knowe lett no man sayth he seduce you yf any man among yow seeme wyse in this world lett him becoome a foole that he may be made wyse
so then by the iudgement of saint pawll a man may become wyse yf hee leane not to his owne fancye yf he condescend to seeme in his owne sight a foole yf he examin him self
and yf he seeme to haue any wysedom that he reduce and submitt the same to the

seruyce and obedience of christ the head and his mystical body to beleue what he teacheth and rather with feare and reuerence to imbrace the same then to follow that which seemeth probable to himself

vvhich thing where it is not done what ells followeth then that as augustin writeth all

auctoritee be taken from the scriptures

and doo wee not see it euen now thus come to passe there is sproong vp in this our vnhappy age martin luther who hath with violence broken into the scriptures and shouldering out all others co~tentiously bearyth me in ha~d that the sense of the scriptures is euen suche as he will haue it and as may best accorde with his doctrine in fine he so handleth the matter that he sowght to bee reputed not a dispensor but a lord ouer the holy scripture
he required obedience of

all in imbracing that sence of the scripture which he him self hath browght foorth·

after that spra~ge carolstadius and after him zwinglius oecolampadius and caluin and as luther had reiectyd all the catholykes and right beleuers so did this man together with the rest remoue allso luther

himself
and with greate exclamations

contenciously affirmeth that the scriptures doo not meane as luther sayth but as he him self teacheth

then brake owt in an other corner not

long after one balthasar pacimontanus he in interpreting certayne places of the scriptures dissenteth both fro luther and zuinglius and will nedes haue the scriptures to meane as he doth interpret the and not as they will haue it

the heauenly prophets so called wherof

swenckfeldius is now the ryngeleader espied this that these fellowes thus tempered the scriptures to their owne sence and conte~ded so earnestly not for the scriptures but for the maintenaunce of their owne priuatt and peruers opinio~s and that for ensample they set foorth to the people for the pure and expresse word of god not that which marke or mathew thought but that which them selues had imagined
so as whyle euery ma~s mynde was to him self an authour and teacher what was in euery scripture to be allowed or disallowed they did not submitte them selues to the authoritee of the scriptures

but thrall the scriptures to them selues and as it were vsurpe a rule and maistry ouer them then saye bega~ne these diuine prophetts thus to thinke with them selues

how long in the end shall we indure the

tyranny of these vnhooded and rennagat fryers howe longe shall we be driuen to adore as the expresse word of god what so euer hath lyked them to sprinckle with a fewe wordes of the scripture vvhen yett in the meane tyme we see them so fight and disagree emong them selues while euery of them laboureth that his followers should esteeme and receiue not the mynde of the apostle or the euangelist but his owne proper exposition for the expresse worde of god vvhat will these fellowes now be worshipped as gods what remaineth the but that wee should kneele downe to this or that archheretike and presently worship as the very voyce of god what so euer shall be spoken by any of them

nay we will for our partes rather harken for the mynd of god out of heauen and

will bidde away both with these fellowes thus striuing for the vnderstanding of the scriptures yea and with the scriptures them selues wherof wee now see so many not only

diuers but allso mere contrary expositions daily browght foorth
and looke what it shall please that heauenly teacher to reueale vnto vs that will we receiue with due reuerence as the very expresse word of god and will rather heare him self speake according to the saying of the prophett will heare what the lord speaketh with in me then turne our selues to those bare elementes and naked letters and in them which wee see to be turned this waye and that waye to sette our saluation

it is not needfull to be cunning in the lawe or the scripture but to be tawght of god
vayne is the labour which is bestowed on the study of the scripture
for the scripture is but a creature and a certayn bare letter
it is not meete for a christian to be to mych addicted to the creature
yow must heare god his voyce is to be expected from heauen to teache vs blessed is the man sayth dauid whom thow teachest
he dooth as well teache vs now as in the owld tyme he did the patriarkes and prophettes
christ forbadde that wee should haue any moe maister for that wee haue our only maister in heauen

thou seest heerby most vertuous kyng wher vnto at last the matter is come and how

truely it was sayd by augustine that all

auctoritee is taken from the scripture when a man will not only not be subiect to the authoritee of the scriptures in matters of faith but make them thrall and subiect vnto him neither will contend for the mynd of the scriptures but for his owne
for what so euer him self thinketh that will he haue reputed for the trewe and expresse word of god though all other men thinke the contrary
by to mych altercation sayth one the truthe is lost
and pray yow is not· the truth now in manner lost is not with some men the authoritee of the scriptures taken awaye

in the which only lyeth all vndoubted truthe namely since euery man hath sowght to arrogat to him self the iudgement of the scriptures and remouing the sentence of all others hath sought to haue his owne being wyde and straieng from the churche to be worshipped as the very expresse word of god

but could this matter euer haue come to this passe yf these fellowes reme~bring them selues to be men would rather haue chosen to followe the iudgement of the churche

and therunto reuerently haue submitted themselues then thus insolently to co~maunde men to imbrace the visions of their hartes for the word of god vvhen in deed no man lyuing can be of so excellent learning or of so singular holynes of lyfe that it can be lawfull for vs to receyue his opinion for the expresse worde of god

but on the other syde where as is a consenting

voyce of the whole churche yf a man dowbt that to be the expresse word of god and a most certayn truth what doth he ells but dowbt whether god be true or no vvho it is most certayne and vndoubted to speake by the mowth of his churche

thow perceauest now most fortunat king sigismond that it is not by and by the expresse and pure word of god what so euer is browght owt of the scriptures from the peruers vnderstanding wherof wee see all heresies haue sproong
namely that the diuell him self did also say for it is written etc

vvhen yet the sence wherwith he browght those wordes was the diuells owne and not the pure word of god

the scriptures no doubt are sacred

and holy and in them is contayned the very word of god yf the sownd meaning and vnderstanding therof be applyed therunto
but heresie is in the vnderstanding not in the scripture the sense not the text is in the fault
vvee co~tend not for the scripture with those that haue departyd from vs which boasting them selues so myche of gods woord doo vsurpe the same vnto them selues alone
for they them selues confesse they haue receyued the scriptures from none other but from vs from whom they be departyd who doo allso with reuerence receyue all the canonicall scriptures
they on the other syde because they will not in matters of fayth be subiect to the aucthoritee of the scripture doo receyue only that in the which by wrestyng may be framyd to serue to their doctryne

the controuersy therfore between vs is

not of the scriptures but of the sence and vnderstanding of the scriptures
brefely the selfe same varyance wee reade to haue been in all ages betwee catholikes and heretikes
arius brought foorth this scripture my father is greatter then by which text as

by the expresse word of god he sought to persuade

to the ignorant people that christ the sonne of god was inferiour to his father and was not of the same substau~ce with him
and in deed yf an vnlerned man come to the wayghing of those naked wordes arrius may seeme to haue sayde somwhat vnto him
but what did hereunto the catholikes and rightbeleuers they reuerently acknowleged the text
but that which arrius gathered therof they constantly affirmed not to be the pure word of god since christ neuer spake them in that sence as to teache him self not to be equally god or in any thi~g vnequall to his father
for in that he was the sonne of god he was of the same substaunce with his father but in that he was the sonne of ma he was inferiour vnto him
and allthowgh the sectaryes and followers of arrius tooke that for the expresse word of god yet the catholikes· doubted not to affirme it to be the expresse word of the diuell

euen lyke to this is the contention at this daye of the contrary doctrines between the catholikes and the heretikes for we striue

not with them that haue departed from vs abowt the scripture but about the vnderstanding therof
and to make the matter the playner let vs consyder but this one place of scripture which is now a dayes commonly alleaged it is sayd to be the expresse word of god drinke you all of this
and doo wee denye this to be the expresse

woord of god no but doo willingly grawnt it yet that it is the expresse word of god in that sence which they that bee departed fro vs doe gather of that text that is it which wee doo vtterly denye
for what doo they trowe yow gather of this place of scripture forsooth that all which communicate ye eue the laye people should be bownd by the commaundement of god to receyue the sacrament of the aultar vnder bothe kindes
but that christ spake those wordes in that sense we graunt not
but eue as luther

him self once sayd the same in this case saye wee allso
that christ commaunded nothing in this matter as necessary to the laye people because these wordes were spoken to none other but to the apostles

yow see that here wee differ not abowt

the text but about the vnderstanding therof
for with no lesse yea and with more reuerence then they which haue deuided them selues from vs doo we catholikes receiue this text as the very worde of god

but they would intrude their owne newe

sense forged therunto
and wee seeke to defend the sense receyued in the churche
they looue and leeke the sense which them selues bryng not becaase it is trewe but because it is their owne and will needes defend that with toothe and nayle vvee looue and leeke the sense browght by the churche not because it is our owne but for that wee stedfastly beleue it to be the very trewe sense of the scripture vvhich to be so not one priuatt

man but the churche being as pawl

calleth it the piller and sure grownd of truth and wherunto the spirit of truth was promised and sent hath tawght vs

but let vs yet a little more diligently wayghe the very text it self
they saye the

expresse word of god is drynke yee all of this
ergo it is necessary that all persons

should drinke of the cup and yf any do other wyse they are giltye say they of breaking

the institution of christ
vvee will here a litle nerer ioyne foote to foote with them

pray thee what caliest thow the word of god the scripture
and what meanest

thow by this worde liuely and expresse clere playne and that which is so layde ope to all mens eyes that no man is so dull of sight which may not plainly see it
but yf it be so playne and cleere how cometh it to passe that there is now such a doe about it of thin ges which are clere and manifest is there any man that will moue argument as for example
vvhether it be daye or no when wee see the sonne vp and shinyng vpon the earth of necessite therfore it must nedes followe that this is not so expresse and playne a worde as to thee it seemeth since there ryseth so muche question vpon it
and yf it be so playne and expresse it is a great marueill that in al these
yeres since polonia first receiued and hath imbracyd the gospell of christ and these wordes of christ hauing ben commonly read and rehersed in the churche that no man hath ben founde not only in polonia but neither in the whole world besyde wherin the name of christ is

professed who coulde thinke it in that sence that yow now bryng foorth to be the expresse word of god
that is to saye that therby the laye people should be bound as by the commaundement of god of necessite to receyue the sacrament of the aultar in both kindes

the grekes themselues albeit the laye

people were with them admitted to the cup did yet neuer so interprette these wordes vvho when in the councell of florence more then an hundreth yeres past they assembled them selues with the latynes and contendyd with them about some other matters yet did they not bestowe iij wordes in altercation with them about the vse of the challyce because they knewe there was no precept of christ wherby the laitye were of necessite bounde so to receiue the same
doo you then thinke all men to haue been blynde and suche blockheades and stockes that in so many ages yea eue synce the tyme that the gospell was written they could neuer see this so playne and expresse a word of god but wayghe well with thyself whether this be a point of christian pietye and

modesty so to thinke of the fathers wherof a

great number neuer being acquaynted with the vse of the cup to other the to the priestes themselues in the sacrifice of the masse did yet leaue vnto vs the gospell of christ sealed with their bloud vvilt thow so co~demne them all of blyndnes or impiete that either they sawe not this so playne a place of gods worde or els that seing it which were more intollerable they wold wittingly haue gone against it

but thow sayest what so euer is become of

the fathers the wordes be cleere drinke yee all of this he that sayeth excludeth none

vvith what impudency then dost thow

make of not all but yf he exclude none whic sayeth wilt thow then haue infidels also to drinke of the cup god forbid thow saist for the participatio of the sacramentes pertayneth only to the faythfull
vvhy but a lytle before thow saydest he that sayeth excludeth no man
vvith what face then dost thou now exclude the infidels and so of make not all but in this poynt synce thow thinkest rightly we will

gladly agree with thee and will not be vnwilling to allowe this thy restraynt

but now tell me of good fellowshipp whether thinkest thow children that be christned to be of the number of the faythfuii or

no thow sayest yea how the vvilt thow co~maund them allso to drynke of the cupp no why but a litle before thou saydst that all the faithfull must of necessite drynke of the cupp
vvherfore dost thow now agayne of al make not all vvhy dost thow allowe to thy self that which thow wilt not allowe laufull to the church of god thow thinkest it laufull to keepe children from all sacramentall participatio of the body and bloud of christ and yf to laye persons being past their childhood the one kind be not geuen when yet in that other which is geuen all and whole christ is receyued then complaynest thow that great sacrilege is committed

but here thow wilt saye
as touching infantes that thinke them well kept from

the communion of the sacramente of the body and blood of christ the auctorite of pawll moueth me whoo wryteth lett euery ma trye himself and so eate of that bread

and drinke of the cupp
but how shall an infant trye him self and how shall he iudge our lord his body which is not yett come to reason and vnderstanding

but what praye the if it be superfluous

that they shoold trye themselues whom wee knowe to be cleane being purified by the holy sacrament of baptisme and newly entryd ynto the howsehold of christ vvhat yf litle ones can iudge the body of our lord which they receyue by their god fathers and god mothers who before they be baptysed doo in their name professe to beleaue yea and that the chyld him self beleaueth and renounceth sathan yf the faith of the suertyes and of the churche suffise the infant to the receiui~g of baptisme why should not their triall and iudgement allso suffise him to the receiuing of the sacrame~t verely ruardus tapper a learned man bringeth none other cause why childre are kept from the sacramentall participation of the body and bloud of christ but only that they doo not allwayes swallowe that is put into their mowth or yf they doo yet do they often putt it vp agayne

but god forbidde should reprehend that you doo therin allso farther restrayne this word and denye allso the communion to infantes

for this is in deed the mynd of the churche althowgh wee reade it was otherwyse in the

primitiue churche
but yf thow thinke it is with good reason doone that the churche keepeth infantes from all sacramentall participation of the body and bloud of christ why doest thow not allso persuade thy self that in forbearing to geue the cupp to the laye people it was leekewyse led therunto by iust reasons and waighty considerations

but let vs yet wayghe and examine farther these words of christ which yf wee will rightly vnderstand it behoueth vs to haue regard to those which went before to the end we may therby knowe to whom these

wordes were spoken
mathew descrybing the supper of our lorde speaketh thus but when euening was come he sate downe with his twelue disciples
marke thus but

when the euening was come he came with

his twelue
and luke thus and when the hower was come he sate downe and his

twelue apostles with him
in the former place the word seemyd to yow very playne and cleere how cometh it then to passe that this word twelue should not seeme vnto yow as playne and cleere vvould there be any matter of stryfe yf you would as sharply behould this word as you doo that which went before is not either of them the word of one and the same god both all and twelue

this therfore is the true sense of christ

his wordes drinke ye of this all ye twelue which are set doune with me it is wel knowe there were diuers others in the howse of symon the lepre where the supper was made yet only the twelue apostles sate downe

vvho after he had instituted newe priestes of the newe sacrifice saying make or doe this thinge for remembraunce of me he commaunded them only to drynke of the cuppe which they did as marke writeth saying and they dra~ke all therof
might

you not as laufully gather herby that albeit the sacrame~t of the body and bloud of christ pertayne vnto al yet these words drinke ye

all of this pertayne only to the apostles and

to syche as succeede them to wyt bisshopps and priests and so the expresse word of god in that point to be this that so often as priests make that which christ then made and commaunded them to make that is to saye when so euer they consecrate the body of christ and offer the same in the remembraunce of his passio it is necessary for them to vse both kyndes both in conseerating offering and receiuing so as yf therein they leaue owt that one kynd they may iustly seeme to committe great sacriledge

but shewe vs now one word will not

saye cleer and playne but how darke so euer it be wherof wee may with any reason coniecture that euer christ commaunded the laye people to drynke of the cuppe or at the lest where christ gaue them his bloud to drynke
and yet ye obiect against vs the expresse word of god and with open mowth charge vs therwith when ye can not fynd so myche as any shadowe therof in the scriptures
but wee whether ye will regarde the shadowe and figure or the trouth and thing it self can out of the very scriptures shewe you the contrary of your doctrine

ye are not ignorant that manna geuen to the lewes from heauen was the shaddow and figure of this sacrame~t of the body and blood of christ so was the pascall la~be allso of these all did eate but lyquors neuer came to the vse of any others then of the priests neither did the laye people vsurpe

to themselues any porcyon therof

lett vs nowe come to the truthe and the thinge it self
christ drawing nere vnto

those ij which went to emaus we~t with them when they came to the castell he taryed with the and sitting downe with the tooke bread blessed it brake it and gaue it vnto them
and their eyes were opened and they knewe him and then he vanysshed owt of their syght
this bread the holly

fathers interprett to haue been the sacrament of the body and blood of christ here is no me~cyon made of the cupp
doo yee now see this expresse word of god that christ gaue the sacrament vnder forme of bread alone to them which were no apostles but that hee commaunded to geue or that him self gaue to the laye people his bloud to be dronke owt of the challyce that is so farre from

being the expresse word of god that ye can not so myche as fynd any shadow therof in the scriptures

this did the boemians well vnderstande that of these places of the gospell where the supper of our lorde is described they could not defend their errour wherby they had with priuat auctoritee vsurped to them selues the challyce vvherfore this text of iohn seemed to them a playner word of god to buyld their errour vpon except ye eate the fleshe of the sonne of

man and drynke his bloud ye shall haue no lyfe in you
vvhich word they which in this our age haue deuyded themselues from the churche denye to appertayne any thing to the supper of our lord but will haue them vnderstanded not of the sacramentall but of the spirituall eating
so that which seemed to the boemians the plaine and cleere word of god to the luthera~s was not so cleere
vvho whe they had take away owt of the churche both priesthod and sacrifice which yet the boemians did not for these will haue all men priestes they will also haue these wordes to be spoken vnto all drinke

ye all of this
but to this which the bohemians bring owt of the sixth of iohn a good and learnyd ma hath very well aunswered more then an yeres past

no faithful catholike sayth that the saying of iohn except ye eate etc or ells that any other the commaundements of christ owght not to be kept but the catholike sayeth that the vniuersall church of christ better vnderstandeth which be the commaundeme~ts of christ and how they owght to be kept then husse or his followers the

varyance therfore is not of the wordes of christ which euery good man doth receyue with all reuerence but of the sence and vnderstanding of his wordes

but the heretikes of our tyme as we said

before denye those wordes to be rightly taken of the sacramentall eating of the body and bloud of christ for which cause allso they forbeare to vse the authoritee of this text to the affirming of the vse of the challyce

but wee who doo willingly follow the mynd of the fathers doo not denye but they maye be well vnderstanded of bothe kyndes and yet do constantly affirme that when the

only forme of bread is receyued both the body of christ is eate and his bloud is dronke
they did eate sayth cypriane and dra~ke

of one self bread according to the visible forme
here thow seest it reported they did not only eate but allso drinke of one bread yea and in the scriptures wee reade that bloud was allso eaten
the body of christ is

therfore eate and his bloud is dronke when the only forme of bread is receyued yea thowgh nothing be powred owt of the challyce into the mowthes of the faithfull
for allthowgh it be neither grinded with the teethe nor swallowyd yet is it eaten and dronke by faith and charitee

but it is a wonder to see that the bohemians laboured to proue their purpose by

that place of the gospell where no mention is made either of the cuppe or of the wyne but only of bread which allso alone to suffise vnto saluation the wordes of christ do declare saying if a man eate of this bread he shall liue for euer and the bread which will geue is my fleshe for the lyfe of the world
hee that eateth this bread shall liue for euer
you see how the promisse of eternall

lyfe was made to the bread and not to the cuppe
and in all that sixth chapiter of iohn is made no mencion in any one word either of the cuppe or of the wyne

vvhy doest thow therfore complayne sathan why doest thow so often dull our eares with thy vayne boasting of the expresse worde of god vvhe what so euer is browght foorth of the scriptures if it be rightly vnderstanded seemeth muche more to make to the allowing of the receyued order of the churche then to the maintenaunce of this thine errour

but there is no cause why a christe man should thinke that sathan passeth so muche for the cuppe
for he knoweth wel inowgh it is no whyt materiall to saluation whether a ma vse the cuppe or no synce by his lymmes luther bucer and philipp melancthon he doth manifestly confesse nothing touching the vse of the cuppe to be commaunded by christ as necessary to saluation
full well knoweth he that it was very trewe which by the fathers in the cou~cell of basill which

councell wee knowe in this matter to be receyued and allowed was fully decreed that

whether a man co~municate in one or bothe kyndes so it be done by the ordinaunce and obseruaunce of the churche it profiteth the worthy receyuer to saluation
therfore this offendeth him not that a man should communicate vnder one forme neither dooth he force to haue him communicate vnder bothe
but that it should be doone according

to the ordinaunce and obseruaunce of the churche because in that sorte and none otherwyse it profitteth the receyuers to saluation that is it lo that chiefflly offendeth sathan
and that they should not co~municat in that sort that is to saye according to the ordinaunce and obseruaunce of the churche that is it which he is so earnest abowt

vvell sathan will be sathan for in the hebrew sathan is as myche to saye as an aduersary
he therfore will still be an aduersary both to christ the head and to his body
it is an ordinaunce and obseruaunce of the churche which is the mysticall body of christ that wee should communicat vnder one forme he will haue it doone vnder bothe

but suppose the ordinaunce and obseruaunce of the churche which is the mysticall body of christ were so that we shoulde communicatt vnder bothe formes then wil you haue it done either vnder one alone or vnder neither of bothe
but wil you heare the beast vtter his owne wordes vve recited them before but it shall not be a mysse to heare him agayne thus he speaketh by his chosen vessell luther

if perhapps the councell should so decree

then would wee not receyue in both kindes but then chieffly in despight of the councell would we vse either the one or neither of both and not both and playnlie hould the accursed which by auctoritee of syche councell should vse both

see you now to what end sathan te~deth he seeketh not so myche to haue the vse of the cuppe permitted to the layetie but that all things in despight of the church should be doone contrary to the decrees therof
he is a right sathan
he is the enemye of christ

the head and of his body
he is antichrist
vvherfor what so euer it hath pleased christ to decree by the mowth of his churche allbeit

he knoweth the same to be right and agreable with the worde of god yet dooth he all wayes with toothe and nayle earnestly withstand it
and looke what song he being the head of his body and lymmes did once synge to our head and maister christ the same by his members doth he now recorde to vs being the members of christ throwe

thy self downe
that is to saye as wee haue before heard vincentius lirinensis interprett it lett thy selffawll downe from the doctrine and traditio of this high churche which is reputed the church of god
followe not that which seemed good to the churche but that which leeketh me imbrace the vnderstanding of some priuatt man who being inspired with my spirit shall not doubt to arrogat any thing to him self and to derogatt all thinges from others and followe not the sence and co~sent of the whole christian worlde wherunto it is certayne the spirit of christ wanteth not

therfore so often as you shall heare sathan saye owt of the gospell for it is written drinke ye all of this so often thinke you heare him saye nothing els but that

which he sayd to christ
throwe thy self

downe
for this is it which he seeketh to persuade wnto men that they should despyse the churche which is the grownde and piller of truthe that in the interpreting of the scriptures they should geue more auctoritee to their owne priuatt iudgement then to the decree of the churche
that they should howld for nawght her ordinaunces and cutt them selues of from the body of the churche
vvherfore as touching the vse of the sacrame~t wee may well saye to these men as augustine sometyme sayde to the donatistes

the faulte is not in the sacramentes but in the separation
the fault is not in communicating vnder one or both formes but yf thow communicat contrary to the ordinaunce and obseruaunce of the churche in that only is the faulte and doubtles so great a faulte as that all wickednes compared with this is as a strawe in respect of a beame

then what a kynde of religion is this of some men that saye they are moued with the feare of god and loue of his lyuely word for that is their maner of speache to thinke it

necessary for them to receyue the cuppe as who should saye that in the space of this
yeres wherin polonia with the countries adioyning hath receyued and helde the faith of christ there hath been no man that hath feared god no man that loued

his lyuely worde no nor is at this daye in the whole christian worlde but only syche as hath been inspired with the spiryt of luther

vvhat an arroga~cy what a deuilif he and odious pryde is this so to arrogat vnto thy self alone the feare of god and the loue of his lyuely word that thow wilt vtterly pull the same from all others were they of neuer so singular pietye and godly lyfe vvhat be these men ells then degenerated childre and as the prophett caullyth them the seed of

the harlott and adulteresse that dare thus charge their holy elders and blessed forefathers of so extreme impietye as that none of them should feare god or loue his word and that syche fathers from whom they haue receyued both the rules of well liuing and the doctrine of true belefe vvhich many of them allso haue left vnto vs sealed with their

bloud by whose trauayll it came to passe that wee first heard the name of christ that being drawen out of most thick clowdes and darknes of idolatry wee are sett in the bright and shinyng light of the truth
these are they forsothe which so religiously embrace the expresse word of god saying vnto

vs honour thy father and thy mother

but let vs waygh a litle what feare of god this is wherwith they saye they are so stryke that they may not forbeare the cuppe
sure this is syche an other feare as the iues

semed to be in when they doubted to enter into the place of iudgement lest they should be defyled
they had a great conscience to enter into the place of iudgement thinking that by entring therinto they were greuously defyled but to deliuer vp christ to the gentills to be scornyd whipped and crucified therin had they no religion or conscience at all but rather thought it an offence of conscience and religion to haue done otherwyse
for they persuaded them selues that they fulfilled the commaundement of god in deliuering the sonne of god to the ge~tills to be done to death
vve haue a lawe

sayd they and by that lawe he owght to dye because he made him self the sonne of god
they seemyd to them selues by the expresse word of god to shewe that they rightfully deliuered christ to the gentills to be put to death and theryn were so litle troubled with any scruple of conscie~ce that they thowght they should haue committed a wycked act yf they had done otherwyse
but what should they not with myche lesse fault for any cause haue entred in to the iudgement place then haue crucified christ the sonne of god

but euen syche is their religion which saye they are forbidden by their conscience to content them selues with receiuing the sacrame~t in one kynd very rightly are they touched with the place of the psalme they

trembled for feare where was no cause of feare and that which christ him self sayth in the gospell they straine a gnat and swallowe

downe a camell
they will seeme to feare god they knowe the churche by the expresse word and precept of god is to be

heard and that the custome receyued and allowed by the same is to be receyued and

kept yet when the holly catholike church the mysticall body of christ which he so loued that he gaue his true and liuing body to death for the same when that saye is in daunger to be deuyded in to many partes and to be no lesse cruelly torne and re~t then the true and liuely body of christ was of the iues there shewe they no feare or scruple of conscience at all

but euen as the iues when they deliuered the true body of christ to be rent of the tormentors affirmed they did it according to the expresse word of god saying vve

haue a lawe and by that lawe he owght to

dye euen so these men when they are entred into the leeke councell against the mysticall body of christ when they seeke all the wayes and meanes they can to deuide and cut the same into many partes which their attemptes greate is the pittye haue had to speedy successe taking their entry with the matter of the cuppe will needes seemes to do it according to the expresse word of god still cryeng allso
vve haue a lawe drinke yee all

of this and by this lawe the mysticall body of christ the churche must be deuyded and

cut in soonder
how wonderfull are these

sleightes of sathan how great is the subteltie of his crafty deuises of that very thing which christ would haue to be a sacrament of pietye a toke of vnitee a bond of charite he seeketh to make a cause of dissencion a matter of deuisio and a fyrestone of hatred
for what ells is there done in this sacrame~t

but as pawll sayeth the death of our lord is shewyd and for what cause dyed he verely to gather in to one as iohn sayeth

the children of israell which were dispersid
christ therfore dyed that he might gather together vnite and make vs one body of which matter he allso would this sacrament to be a token
for wee which be many be

one bread and one body in that wee participate of one bread
but here satha the true antichrist not only in word but in deed the very enemye of christ did therfore cast in this contention about the cuppe to separat deuyde disperse and cut in pieces the church which christ by the sheading of his precious bloud hath gathered together so as therby he might make voyd the benefitt of the crosse and death of christ to them that

should followe this wicked and sacrilegious counsell of separation

our lord sayth augustine did in this

sacrament marke and seale vs by this he would vs to appertayne vnto him in this table did he consecrate the mystery of peace and vnitee he that receiueth this mystery of vnitee and howldeth not the bond of peace he taketh not a mystery for him self but a wittnesse against him self

but will you knowe how great a wickednes he committeth then harken to pawll

who telleth the that he is giltye of the body and bloud of our lord that is to say he hath committed no lesse wickednes and shall be gilty of no lesse crime then euen they who with their owne ha~des whipped christ shed his bloud crucified his body and put him to greuous death
and this is the thing which sathan seeketh that diuisio may be wrought in this sacrament of vnitee so as therby christ may be crucifyed agayne and as it were scornyd and mockyd at
but shall it be thus euen with him which calleth it the sauing word deserueth this to be called the sauing worde which co~de~neth to euer lasting

death verely this is no sauing word drinke of the cuppe for iudas dranke of the cuppe and was condemned many heretikes many false bretherne many confessing christ and yet denying his power haue dronke of the cuppe
but how to death and euerlasting damnatio not to lyfe and eternall saluation

but wilt thow knowe what is this sauing

word it is a short worde and an easy looue
charite is this sauing word which who so hath not lett him drynke of the cuppe so myche as he will yett shall he gayne euerlasting death eternall saluation he shall neuer atteyn therby
for it is trewe that is writte he that loueth not dwelleth in death but

he that loueth his neighbour hath fulfilled

the lawe

and can he possibly seeme to loue his neighbour which doth so iudge of them that haue auctoritee ouer him and whom he is commaunded to obey that they neither haue nor euer had any feare of god or loue to his sauing word but allwayes endeuoured them selues to oppugne and withstand the same surely these are not signes of loue but

of hatred
seemeth he to loue his neighbour

which doth not only separat him self from one person but from all which truly professe christ and from the vniuersall catholyke churche condemning his fathers and elders of impiety as men that had resisted the holy ghost and would not embrace a knowe truth

the property of charitee and loue is to vnyte and knytte together and not to separatt and deuyde
this word therfore drinke ye of the cuppe is not that sauing or liuely worde
but the sauing word is loue that is to saye
separatt not thy self from the vnitee and knot of the body of christ fro the agreement of his churche but obediently and reuerently heare the same humble gladly thy sense and conceyte to the sense and consent therof and neuer arrogat so myche to thy self as to preferre thyne owne iudgement before the iudgement therof

it is very well written by augustine

loue and doo what thou wilt
vvhether thou drinke or drinke not of the cuppe so thy drinking or absteyning be in loue and vnitee according to the ordinaunce and obseruau~ce of the churche it proffiteth thee vnto saluation

and contrary wyse whether thow drynke or drynke not of the cuppe standing in deuision thow shalt be gilty of the body and bloud of our lord because there thou seekest discord where christ chieffly co~mended vnto vs vnitee and concord

vvhich thinges being so most fortunatt kyng sygismond who can sufficiently commend this your acte that when to your self it hath allso been often sayd throwe thy self downe that is to saye let thy self fall from the doctrine and tradition of this high churche or at the lest in this only communion of the sacrament of the aultar suffer that to be done which is contrary to the decrees of the churche and differing from the rest of christendome yet coulde your highnes neuer be induced to yelde to these sedicious counsells of separation

but when more then once or twyse you

had openly professyd it appertayned not to your person to determyne any thing in matters tooching religion for so myche as the emperour being allso a chylde of the churche and within the churche not aboue the churche is bound reuerently and obediently

to heare his most holy moother and not to prescribe vnto her your highnes therfore thought meete to referre the matter to the next generall councell or to the iudgement of the holy apostolyke see
vvherin suerly you did a thing which was well sitting to your woorthines and to the vertu and pietye of your renoumed auncetors
for what thing is there that can woorse become a christian and catholyke kyng then to take vppo him to meddle in those thinges which are proper and peculiar to priestes and bisshopps which wickednes when so euer any prynce hath commytted wee reade that god hath most greuously punisshed him

but doo not denye that the vse of the cuppe vppo iust causes shewyd and appering to a generall cou~cell may by the same be permitted to the laye people but yf any one kingdom will vsurp the same vnto it self diuiding it self therin from the rest of the christyan world what dooth it ells but willingly and wittingly spott it self with most wicked schisme

and that is it wherunto sathan tendith

he passeth not for the cuppe but seeketh

to worke the schisme
for yf the cuppe shoold by an agreing consent of the churche be permitted the would he as before by the wordes of luther his member doth appere thinke meete vtterly to refuse it
so seeketh he none other thing but separation and diuision in that sacrame~t which is the pledge and knot of vnitee for it is he of whom the prophet spake which setteth discord emong

brethern of whom christ him self also sayd he that gathereth not with me shattereth
and on the other syde our god is

not a god of diuision or dissensio but a god of peace loue and charitee so as no good man ought to doubt but that it is the expresse word of the diuell wherin nothing is sought but discord and diuision

yet are there some which labour to persuade

vnto the people that this is the waye and only meane to stay the dissensio in matters of religion and that herby only it might come to passe that in your highnes kingdom co~sent and vnitee of doctrine and fayth myght be retayned yf the cuppe might be permitted to the laye people
but these men seeme not as yet to haue sufficiently

learned to knowe the sleightes of sathan
can any wyse and good man beleue that by

permitting an errour errors be take awaye or that separation being graunted vnitee can be reteyned call it an errour if the cuppe be challenged as necessary to saluatio and a separatio meane yf it be permitted to any one countrey apart from the rest of the christian world

and suerly to me this waye seemeth contrary to reason and common sense
the fathers haue been of farre co~trary opinion they thought not the meane to que~che heresies

to be permission but by making of contrary decrees and constitutions

vvhat iniquitee seemed to be in that matter that nestorius would haue our lady to be called the mother of christ did not shee in deed beare christ doo we not fynde her in the scriptures commonly called the mother of iesu and neuer termed directly the mother of god

yet seemed it good to the holy fathers assembled in the councell holden at ephesus to

make this decree that yf any man should call her the mother of christ and not the

mother of god he should be accursed

and litle did it moue them that nestorius still cryed out he leaned to the expresse word of god or that in all the canonicall scriptures it could not be founde that euer she were termed the mother of god and that they owght to receiue nothing which were not expresly contayned therin for they sawe well ynough that the heresie of nestorius wherby he laboured to proue that our lady when shee bare christ was deliuered but of a bare man only could not any other waye be sooner quenched then by a decree and generall constitution to the contrary
neither was their opinion frustrat therin
for soo deepe a roote in the myndes of men did this decree of the holy fathers take that euen to this daye

as long as it is since that councell ther is no natio found wher the gospell of christ is receyued in whose vulgar tong the virgin mary is not more commonly called the mother of god then the mother of christ

agayne wee knowe there is a canon of

the apostles that suche as be christened should be thryse dypped
yet for auoiding the

sclaunder of schisme and the vse or allowing of hereticall doctryne we reade it was decreed in the iiij
councell holden at tolledo

they should be but once dipped lest by thryse dipping following the manner and custome of heretikes they should seeme to allowe their assertion

neither are wee ignorant that christ made the sacrament of his body and bloud in vnleauened bread which custome was also a whyle obserued in the churche and is agayne at this daye
but so sone as the hebionytes bega~ne to sprynge who would needes

haue all the ceremonies of the lawe also as precysely obserued and kept as the very gospell and therfore vtterly denied that this sacrament might be made in leauened bread because all oblation offred to our lord ought by the lawe to be with out leaue the contrary was decreed that is to saye that the sacrament should be made of leauened bread vvhe yet the thing in his owne nature is indiffere~t neither seemeth it muche materyall whether you make it in vnleauened or in leauened bread
but after the heresie of the hebionites ceased the latyn churche

thought good to returne agayne to their intermitted manner of consecrating in vnleauened bread
thus wee see our holy fathers thought not good by permission to noorishe heresies but by meere contrary decrees to suppresse them

but somwhat they saye is to be graunted to the multitude which require this
vvhat yf the multitude should propound this pointe of doctrine that only god the father

were to be adored and called vppon but christ to be holden only for an aduocate shall we say that this is straight wayes to be graunted because the multitude required it the matter goeth yll when we shall rather chose to followe the vnlearned multitude then the iudgement of those who are properly called to this office

namely synce it is truly sayd that the multitude is the

mother of sedition and contumacye and the small nomber the mistrese of discipline

the multitude ought to be gouerned and not to gouerne ought to obey but not to prescribe lawes that kingdom is in an hard and pittefull case where the rule and gouerneme~t standeth in the multitude
as in all other

thinges so chieffly in matters of religion it is diligently to be considered not who or how many doo requyre but what the thing is that is required

the multitude requyred of the apostles and their followers that they should denye christ and offer incense to idolls the power and auctoritee did also earnestly aduyse the therunto
but what did they to this vvee

must sayd they obey god rather then men
and so they were ready to indure al kynd of punisheme~t yea to laye downe their neckes vnto the rather the they would do that they required yea and by their martyr dome they per}formed in deed that they had spoke

vvhat your part is to doo most vertuous kyng in the suppressing of heresies you are not ignorant you are taught this also by the lawes of your contrey to the keeping wherof you bound your self by an othe when you

were inuested in this your kingdom
verely all men which will be accompted christia~s especially wee that be bisshops and guides of religion must rather desire a thowsand deathes then once to denye christ

but he denyeth christ not only which

confesseth him not to be god and acknowlegeth him only for an aduocat or he which dooth not beleue euery poynt and article which the infallible auctoritee of the canonicall scriptures prescribeth vnto vs either of his diuinite or of his humanite but allso he which dooth not in all pointes communicatt with the vnitee of his churche
for christ is both the head and the body the head is the only begotten sonne of god and his body is the churche they be as husband

and wyfe two in one fleshe
vvherfore he dooth as myche denye christ which dooth so dissent from his body the churche that he thinketh the communion therof not to be spred ouer all but to be found separat in

some one part as he which dissenteth from the holly scriptures in any point touching christ him self the head therof as augugustine teacheth vs in many places

there is extant in eusebius an epistle of dionysius alexa~drinus to nouatus wherin he writeth that martyrdome indured for not deuyding the churche is as glorious as that which is indured for refusing to committe idolatry

yea and surely in my iudgement

saieth dionysius it is so myche more glory
for there he suffreth martirdome but for his owne soule but here for the whole churche

vvherby wee may see it is no lesse greuous offence to deuide the churche or

by assent to allowe a schisme then to offer incense to idolls

let it therfore be farre from a christian man and namely from a bisshopp by and by to geue his assent whe a multitude or power requireth a separation from the churche of god
it is to be wished that it may please

god to geue vs this mynd rather to suffer our bodyes to be deuyded from our soules then by our assent to allowe any sacrilegious deuise of separation from christ or his body the churche
of this mynd as it becometh all christians to be so chieffly vs that be bisshopps yf wee will duely execute the office of good pastors

it is well reme~bred most vertuous kyng how when your highnes came first to the gouuernement of this realme and that some thing was then requyred of you which partly tended to separation your highnes curteously as your manner is and yet well

and flatly denyed their request saying you could not without offence of your conscience graunt the same vsing farther in the presence of your councell and a very notable assembly of the people this saying of christ

vvhat auayleth it a man yf he gayne the whole word and suffer his soule to perishe or what exchaunge may a man make for his soule

your princely crowne the empyre of your large and populous kingdome and of so many

dominions adioyning therunto were not so deere vnto you that the losse or hazard of any of them could once moue you to do any thing that should seeme to be against your faith and religion
and why should not the lyke wordes now allso serue for answer vnlesse perhapps this separatio seeme of lesse importaunce then the other being now required to permitt a deuisio to be made from the holly catholike church being the body of christ

but some what is to be grau~ted say they in respect of a publyke tranquillitie
and pray you was not then allso the publyke tranquillite of the kingdome prete~ded vvas

it not said that great troubles would ryse yf the request were not graunted yet god did forsee and prouyde for the tranquillitie of your kyngdome
and yf tranquillite and quyet be to be bought with so great losse of suche a number of sowlls it were better as the prouerb sayeth that heauen and earth should meete and a thousand tymes to indure the losse of this mortall lyfe then being deuided from the body of christ to lead a whyle a happy lyfe heare in yearth in the iudgement of common men and soone after to change the same with euerlasting death and hell tourments that neuer shall haue end
lighter is the losse of goodes and lyfe then of the soule the losse wherof is not to be recouered

reason not as though it were true which they seke to persuade that it should myche perteyne to the preseruation of the tranquillite of your realme yf the vse of the cuppe were graunted to those which require it to whom it may well be sayd you wotc not what ye aske
but it is in deed most

certayne and vndoubted that yf the thing they require be graunted that shall bryng

to your kyngdom mycbe greater troubles

the wyse and pollityke men of this world

which haue written of common welthes haue taught vs how perillous to euery common welth is innouation and chaunge namely of lawes or auncient manners
vvhich they haue proued by a similitude taken of the body of man in so myche as they which leaue their accustomed manner of diet and chose vnto them selues a new hardly and

very seldom doo it without hazard of their health
vvherfore they thinke it better to tollerat some faultes of the lawe makers and magistrates
for that it is often seen that in diuers cases there cometh not so myche good of correcting an errour vnorderly as hurt in that therby men are by lytle and lytle accustomed

not to obey the magistrat so as ofte to chaunge lawes seemeth to be none other thing but to withdrawe all the force and credit from the lawes and to accustome men by litle and lytle to the attempting of moe and greater alterations and ofte we see that thinges which in them selues seeme small do proue causes of great mischieffes

and doo wee not euen presently before

our eyes see those thinges thus to haue happened both emong our neighbours and euen emong them allso which in this your realme applyed their myndes to innouatio~s could touche soome by name which at the beginning requyred but the cuppe which allso soone after they vsurped to them selues
but did they rest there no but after receyued and imbracyd the whole confession of augspurg

and within a whyle reiecting that tooke the picardican religion and after that the gehennian woold haue sayd geneuian but that gehennian and geneuian be all one which lysmaninus the apostata ba~nyshed by your highnesse king sigismo~d dooth now openly professe
vvhat they will doo in the end knowe not perhapps they

will faull to suenckfeldius
woold any man coulde shewe me any one contrey where the cuppe hath by priuatt aucthoritee been begoonne to be vsurped where very sone after many other and most horrible heresies haue not followed

vvithin the memory of our grandfathers in the kingdo of bohemia our next neyghbour first fell this co~tentyon about the cup

which soome cittyes of their owne aucthoritee vsurped to themselues
but what mo~strous heresies did not presently ensue how few townes coold yee find in morauia or bohemia where the vse of the cuppe was receyued in which you might not see sixe or seuen sectes at once and all miserably deuided

one from an other but in germany which with owt great sorrowe and woo~der wee ca~not behould wherof did this sathanisme take beginning but of the cuppe

these sleyghtes which by the members of

sathan are vsed and framyd against true pietye seeme myche lyke vnto a wedge which being very thi~ne at the edge semeth scarce entryd into the wood whe soone after it throwghly cleaueth and deuydeth the same in soonder
but albeit the first edge be but thinne yet maketh it a waye to the growing thicknes that followeth so as when the first part is receiued and edge entryd of necessitee the rest followeth vntyll at the last the whole peece be soondered
and yf a man woulde saye the cuppe to be the thinne and sharpe edge of this destroying wedge he shall no whit erre fro the truth
for where

the same hath been receyued wee see the thicke parte of the wedge hath followed

first the augustane confession which toke

away both priesthood and sacrifice and brought god him self as it were in to an equallite of degree so as he should haue no more honour doo vnto him then to mortal men
the entryd by and by a thicker part which was the tigurin and lascan co~fessio

which tooke away those ij sacramentes to witt of the supper of our lord and of baptisme which yett the augustane confessio had of curtesie left vnto vs to the end that as that confession had left their followers with owt priesthood or sacrifice so this would farther allso leaue theirs withowt sacramentes
and this secte findeth no lesse fault with the lutherans then it dothe with vs that be christians
but co~demneth both of idolatry because we both are persuaded though after a diuers sorte that the very body and bloud of christ is conteyned in the sacrament and therfore as by their iudgeme~t wee made of that a certayne ydoll so doo we also as they saye of the sacrament of baptisme in that wee attribute therunto

remission of synnes and beleue our selues to be saued thorowgh the fonte of regeneratio
looke therfore what we seeme to the luthe rans the same do the luthera~s seeme to the sacramentaryes that is to saye idolaters

at last foorth cometh suenckfeldius who taketh away not only the whole scripture but allso all outward ministery of the word and maketh the sacramentaryes lutherans

and vs christians idolaters all a leeke who hauing regard to the bare letter meaning the canonicall scriptures seeke there in to fynd our saluation
and this was the last but or end of the wedge whose first part being entred and receyued how thinne so euer the edge therof seemed wee see how by litle and litle all the

rest of this sathanisme brake in as more largely wee haue opened in an other booke

thus doo you see most vertuous kyng wherunto the matter is now brought how after that in despight of the churche the cuppe in the beginning had encroched how greate a forwardnes and swaye grewe therby to the rest of the sathanisme
vvho

so euer is a christian man at the lest yf he be of any pietye can not easely be induced to depart from the sense and consent of the

vniuersall churche
but so soone as a beginning of departure in any one thing is made now is it more hard to fynd the end then it was to see the beginning so as not without cause it hath been taken for an old prouerb the beginning is more the the halfe of the whole which wee may see manifestly verefyed in them which at the first by the only vse of the cuppe wowned the selues out from the knot of the churche who sone after receiued if not all other sectes yet at the lest the whole luthera heresie owt of hand

haue wee not to good proufe of this matter

in germany there was set forth a certain interim religio as muche to saie as religion put to daying how well will not saye but at the lest by auctoritee suffred and receyued allmost of all sauing only a few but pray you with them that receyued it was the lawfull priesthood and sacrifice restored agayne according to the forme prescribed in that booke no
nothing lesse
but the interimistes be and were a like with the other

lutherans but that some where they absteyned from fleshe in the lent and on the fridaye and in their diuine seruice or rather prophane to forbeare the calling of it by the right name sacrilegious they vse in some places surplises and other priestlyke vestiments

but in your owne kyngdom doo wee not see the like wher the cupp by great sacrilege is vsurped is not there both the priesthood and sacrifice leekewyse abrogated doo not

laye men arrogat to them selues the office of priestes do they not take on them power which they haue not to make the body of christ and so geue vnto the communicantes mere bakers bread for how can he make the body of christ to whom power is not geuen so to doo

in fyne sathan sayth nothing ells when co~trary to the ordinaunce and obseruaunce of the churche he commaundeth the layety to drinke of the cuppe but euen that which he somtyme sayde to christ him self throwe thy self downe that is to saye
leaue the tradition of the churche
cast away all obedie~ce therunto make none accompt of the auctoritee

of the councells
but a christian man feareth yet to throwe him self downe because he seeth great perill therin and therfore long deliberateth with him self whether he were best so to doo or no
but yf he haue once bego~ne to throwe him self downe then is it not in his owne power to stay him self but that without recouery he falleth hedlong downe to the bottome

augustine writing vpon that text of the psalme he builded the earth on a sure foundation which shall neuer be remoued but continew from generation to generation interpreteth the earth to be the churche and the water which runneth by

and cometh to nothing in an other psalme he expoundeth to be heresies
and for prouision

that waters flowe not in to the churche that is to saye that heresies may not drowne the same great cliffes and ba~kes are set against the sayd floudes
vvhich bankes may well be interpreted to be the decrees of councells
but though the bankes be neuer so strong yet yf there be neuer so litle a hole made into the same straight

waye the whole waight of the waters lyeth

there vppon and soone breaking downe the banke farre and wyde ouerfloweth whole fieldes pastures and villages so as nothing may then stay the violent course thereof

this hole therfore is then opened when against the ordinaunce and obseruaunce of the churche the cuppe is permitted to the laytie
for who may let why by this hole how small so euer it be all kynd of heresies breaking downe the bankes that is to saye violating the decrees of councells may not violently breake into the churche vvhich considered it is a wonder to see that there want not some which are not asshamed to promyse tranquillite vnto the church and to your highnes kyngdom if against the ordinau~ce and obseruaunce of the churche the cuppe

might be graunted vnto the laye people

yf the peece of wood may be preserued whole and sound which the first part of the wedge seeme the edge therof neuer so thinne is driuen and entred into yf it may be prouided that the thick part therof driuen with many blowes shall not yet at all cleaue the peece yf the corne fieldes and meddowes

may be preserued where into the flouddes

by breache made in the banckes doo with great force flowe in and can not easely fynd a waye owt agayne yf a man may be preserued who hath throwen him self downe hedlong from an high tower yf he may stay him self in the middest of his faull so as coming hedlo~g to the ground he breake not his neck or bruse some other part of his body the may in deed that kingdom be safe sownd and quyet wherin the cuppe is vsurped in despight of the churche and councells

many ther be which require a councell but to what end or to what effect may it be yf after thinges therin well determyned it be laufull to the most abiect kynd of men to doo all thinges contrary in despight therof vvill the auctoritee of councells be more regarded and feared then dyettes and parlamentes but haue not wee seene before our

eyes in despight of the kyng and the parlament many thinges done contrary to that which hath in those assemblies been decreed yea and syche thinges as before the decrees made they durst not haue done and shall wee there hoape for tranquillite and quietnes where no auctorite of

councells assemblies bisshopps or princes is regarded vvhere it is sought that we should be without lawe without kynge without priesthood sacrifice sacramentes yea and without a god to vvhere it is so earnestly laboured to buyld and make of that citye which hitherto hath been of one tou~ge and one language a new found babylon wherin

is so great confusion of tounges that no man can heare the voyce of his neighbour

but what nedeth more your self know most vertuous king how whe some thought good to graunt the cuppe to some clamorous persons so that they would rest there they refused to accept it with that condition
fewe there are in your kingdom that will be contented only with the cuppe no not many which will staye vpon the confession of auspurge
most of them that are departed from vs are either picardines caluinistes laskanistes nestorians or seruetia~s of which sectes no one will be satisfied with the only permission of the cuppe
vvho so readeth the

apologie of the picardines shall therin fynd that they seeme only to follow the boemians being willing to rest only vpon hauing the

communio in bothe kyndes and in all other thinges shewe them selues in ma~ner as catholyke as they which are in deed true and perfyt catholikes in all poyntes

againe petrus paulus vergerius who the last yere came into your kingdo for none other cause but only to stirre seditio therin brought foorth letters written to certayne persons which letters he allso caused to be

printed
but was this first the part of an honest ma verely yf he had had any shame yf any sperk of honesty had been in him he would neuer haue attempted any syche matter
but herein he shewed him self a man voyde of all humanitee and ignorant of the honest course and trade of lyfe emong men synce to publishe letters priuatly written is none other thing but as cicero sayd to

take from this lyfe the societye of lyfe and the commodite of secret and familyar talke between absent frendes
he publisshed allso in print ij letters of paulus quartus the bisshop of rome and not content therwith he wo~derfully darkened and deformed with his owne gloses and wrong interpretations those thinges which were therin godly and

vertuously written
heare what he writeth in his notes vpon the first epistle

some man will saye thus yf we might

dryue the pope to this that he would but assent that the ministres of the churches might haue wyues vse the vulgar toung in the administration of the sacramentes and geue the sacrament vnder both formes to the lay people and in all other articles and doctrines to consent with the churche of rome as hitherto wee haue doone would ye not thinke good we should there rest for a tyme and laying vp that gayne in store by lytle and lytle in proces of tyme deuise for the winning of the other poyntes

answer saith vergerius

lyke it not for the matter consisteth not

only in that the minister should haue a wyfe vse his vulgar toung in the churche and deliuer the sacrament in both kyndes but in that he haue a liuely faith that he be a member of christes churche and be of a right iudgeme~t shewing vnto the people that pure doctrine which our lord iesus christ the sonne of god brought out of his fathers bosome
vvhat a defyling of our doctryne what a straunge thing should it be yf we should geue our consent that the pastor of our soules should

be a massing priest annoynted and allowed by some bisshop and me~ber of antechrist etc

here sathan by this his champion goeth to his matter more ope~ly then by the which contend so earnestly for the cuppe and syche other things as seeme of lesse waight vvhose wily deceytes also herein he discloseth and thinkyng it superfluous to vse any more circumstances he fleeth euen straight to the throte to the end that withowt any more delaye god may be brought in order and

equallite of degree with mortall men hauing left vnto him neither any priesthood nor externe sacrifice wherby he should be ac+knowledged to be god
this is the thing which sathan by his lymme and trusty seruaunt vergerius thought good eue at the first brunt to attempt and suerly it hath been truly sayd in vayne is that doone by many which

may be doone by fewe
for what should a man go about the bus he yf he may easely get thorowgh

but heare what after a fewe wordes he addeth farther for after that this man being ouer curious of the state of forreyn common welthes wherunto he is a strau~ger

and euen borne as it seemeth to stirre vp seditions had exhorted the polonians that yf these iij thinges were graunted them they should constantly refuse them he hath these wordes

vvote thow well polonia this matter

which now lyeth in controuersy touching religion may indure no moderation or concord
marke well what saye and laye it in thy remembraunce
for there be some that say were it not trowe we possible that some meane migt be found to appease this controuersy answer sayth he that none can possibly be fownd
for yf the papacy remayne in force the doctrine of iesu christ can not be free
and againe yf the doctrine of iesu christ which wee professe doo preuayle then of necessitee must the whole papacy be rooted vp so as ther is none other meane of concord or establisshing of the true churche of christ but that the whole papacy with all the tiranny and wicked doctryne therof be cleerly taken away

and sure as for that vergerius writeth that the state of religion may indure no moderation or concord can not well denye but he writeth truly
for either a man must be a whole christian or a whole lutheran

there is no haltyng on either syde
as well shalt thou be da~ned yf thou be a half christian or a half lutheran as yf thou were a whole lutheran

call him an half christian which beleeuing

all thinges as he ought to doo of christ the head dooth yet by his owne priuat fancye in certayne rytes deuyde him self from the body
he thinketh he houldeth fast the head and yet deuideth him self from the body
therfore he will be halfe a christia and half a lutheran that is to say a sathanist for christ him self sayth no man can serue ij

masters what participation can ther be between righteousnes and iniquitee or what society sayth pawll betwee light and darcknes or what agreement between christ and belial and in the apocalips wee read

knowe thy workes that thou art neither hot nor cold
would thou were either hot or cold but synce thou art luke warme and neither hott nor cold will by vomyt cast the out of my mowth the luke warme is euen in lyke sort cast foorth in lyke sort vomyted out of the mowth of god as he which sinneth in the contrary part
therfore they

are in dede very muche deceyued which thinke to contriue a concord by mediocrite

in matters of religion
the bed is straight sayth the prophet so as the one must nedes fall out and a scant cloke ca not couer both
they can not be together in one bed that is to say christ and luther may not ioyne in one mans hart the one of them must nedes faull out they can not be both couered with one cloke
vvherfore in some part of rytes and ordinau~ces to professe christ and in an other part luther is nothing ells but to denye whole christ
that is therfore so true as may be that matters of religion admyt no concord by that meane

vve professe in our crede that wee beleue the holly catholyke churche
from her who so euer departeth and harkeneth not to her teaching and preceptes but geueth more credit to his owne iudgement then to hers though he beleue all the rest which is co~tayned in the crede though he beleue and receyue all the scriptures though he honour them as the very word of god as in deed they are being rightly vnderstanded yet hath he nothing to do with christ the head

which hath separated him self from the body

of christ
he is an ethnik and a publican not deseruing in any part the name of a christian

how often did the arians attempt to come to soome agreeme~t with the catholikes vvheru~to to shewe them selues willing they sayd they woold not stick to permytt that undefined span alphabet should be beleued to be the sonne of the father so he were not callyd undefined span alphabet
there was but one poore letter iota in

question or difference between the christia~s and the arrians
yet could not the christia~s thinke meete to graunt it vnto them
for vnder this one letter they sawe them hyde their heresie wherby they were content to allowe the sonne to be leeke vnto the father in fulnes of grace but not in propriete of nature

vvith what sleightes did the goouernour of cesaria seke to persuade vnto basil that he should yeeld to the tyme and not bryng so many churches in daunger by standing vppo the sifting of so nyce a point of doctryne

but what sayd basil therunto

suche taulke sayth he may serue yoong men for they

and syche lyke gape after sych toyes
but they which haue been trayned vpp in the holly scriptures can not suffer to haue one syllable therof brought in question or hasard
but vse rather to offer them selues to any kynd of death

yf the case so requyre
and therin basill seemed to the heretikes to be froward as before him athanasius and hilary were allso reputed
but that which the heretikes

iudged frowardnes that the catholikes and right beleuers esteemed for great consta~cy

vvherby find my self allso the lesse greued if to soome seeme stubborne in sayeng ther can be no concord between catholikes and heretikes onles they which haue departyd fro vs retourne agayne to the place they went from that is to the lap of our mother the holly churche onles they beleeue her commytt them selues to her and submytt their iudgementes to hers
had rather be counted styffe and stubborne with athanasius hilary and basill the lyke a vayne reed to waue with euery wynd but these procedinges which haue remembryd were of long tyme past

lett vs see how ofte in this our age there

hath been practyse for concord between the lutherans and the suinglians
but how hansoomly fell that out to the lutherans vvhat a concord was it that was made between martin luther and martin bucer

martyn bucer in fauor of luther was co~tent to graunt the body and blood of chryst to be substancially in the sacrament so that luther would agayne to pleasure him graunt that the body and blood of christ was not there but at the very instant when it was receyuid

vvhich of these martyns pray you drewe the other to his opinyon vvhether became martyn luther a sacramentary or martyn bucer of a sacramentary a lutheran verely iohn caluin dooth not any other way make a more effectuall argument that

the body of christ is not substancially in the sacrament then of that graunte of luther confessing a reall presence only when it is receiued
vvherof also he gathereth that the body and bloud of our lord are geue vnto vs only by vertu and efficacy but not by their substa~cial presence and none otherwyse then they be present and geuen vnto vs in baptisme

and penaunce or when so euer the death of christ worketh any effect in vs of which opinion he gloriously sayeth phillip melancthon allso was

is not this a proper concord wherby they which are allredy heretikes become greater heretikes and by their sacrilegious bouldnes growing stronger in blasphemies and errours wexe daily worse and worse not

only erring them selues but drawing allso others into errours but let vs passe ouer the sacramentaryes whose impietye the lutherans them selues though they differ not myche fro them doo yet so abhorre and

detest as they may not afoord any of them so myche as a good morowe or indure their

fellowship or company or once to receiue or harbour them but so sone as it is knowen that there is a sacramentary emong them they straight way bannish him out of their cittyes

how often hath there been concorde intreated between the lutherans and the christians vvhereupon was the interim religion agreed vnto but that there were some gaue great hope that concorde

by this meanes might growe betwen the christians and lutherans but hath that succeded according to their expectation no god wot but looke what was with full iudgement of all except only a fewe allowed at the dyetts of the empyre and with their good willes ther determined that soone after was not obserued by them selues which had receiued it

they of lipsia lest they should seeme not

to be wyser then the rest of the whole empyre though at those assemblyes they had agreed to many thinges touching the interim religion which was there prescribed yet thought they many things of their owne and of their master martin luthers deuise meete to be kept and therfore set foorth a

dooble interim which in some things agreed and in some disagreed from the former interim agreed on at the assemblyes

but they of vvittemberg though they

were neer neyghbours to them of lipsia and subiects to the same prince who had subscribed to the interim religion set out allso in writing an other deuise of theirs wherin they would not be caulled interimistes but

adiaphoristes and therin departed from the

doctrine of their maister luther in fewer thinges then the lipsians hadd done

but the cittyes of saxony when mathias flaccus the illyrican had kindled fyrebrands

amongest them would not goo one heare bredth from the deuyses of their martin luther but thought what so euer was spoken or written by him meete to be receyued and adored as the expresse word of god

vve see therfore that after concord attempted and thought to haue been in manner brought to passe there is growen greater discord then before
for as the lutherans most wickedly deuided them selues from the catholike vnitee and the mysticall body of our sauiour christ so did they soone disperse their owne vnitee with hellish discordes among them selues
vvhat a reuell was ther

how many and how bitter contentions between the zelous lutherans for so they would be accompted that follow flaccus illyricus and between the degenerat disciples of luther whom flaccus calleth adiaphoristes and interimistes of which sort

they be that follow melancthon what a doo say hath there been between these only about the surplesse which of auncient tyme the priestes haue vsed to weare in the churches but what was the cause that they thus pursued one an other in syche small matters sure none other but for that the

germayne lutherans feared lest yf any of the auncient customes and ceremonyes were restoryd againe to the churche it might seeme in parte an inclinyng from luther to christ and doubted lest they might seeme therby to open a wyndow agayne to the papacy

if they then which reioyce to be caulled true lutherans tooke syche ware and carefull heed leest by restoring the auncient ceremonyes of the church they should open a wyndow to the papacy with how myche more dilige~ce ought wee that glory in no name but in the name of christ to forsee that ther be none opened for sathan to enter at to whom without doubt they are opened when men are accustomed not to geue eare to the churche and to set at naught her ordinau~ces preferring their owne priuat iudgementes before the iudgement therof

it is most certayne and vndoubted that

this whole sathanisme which now with teares speake it florissheth in germany and buddeth euen in your kyngdom most vertuous prince hath chieffly growen heerby that euery ma dispising the iudgeme~t of the churche hath thought it lawfull for him self to interprett the scriptures and of his owne head to alter the rytes and ceremonyes therof
vvherfore wee are not vnwilling in this poynt to agree in opinion with vergerius that the matter of religion now in controuersy may not admyt any moderation or concorde namely syche as they would haue synce it is so truly written of the blessed martyr cyprian

there can be no socyetee

between faith and infidelitee
he that is not with christ is agaynst christ
he that is enemy to his vnitee and peace can not ioyne with vs if they come with submission and satisfaction lett them be heard
if they come with curses and threates let them be refused

but where that lewde fellowe vergerius writeth there is none other meane or hope of concord except the vniuersall papacy be

suppressed see for gods sake what sleyghtes these be of sathan and to what end he tendeth in seeking so earnestly to ouerthrowe the papacy but that our saying may be the better beleeued wee wil rather bryng foorth his testimony of the papacy who so long as he liued held mortall warre against the same and whose word vergerius adoreth as the very word of god then vse our owne wordes
for thus writeth luther in a certayne epistle to ij parish priestes of the anabaptisme

heare sayth he and see rebaptising taken

in hand of some vpon this grownd that they would doo it in the despight of the pope as men that will haue nothing of antechrist
euen as the sacramentaries will haue in the sacrament but meer bread and wyne in despight of the pope thinkyng them selues able by this meanes to suppresse the papacy
verely this fou~datio is friuolous and vayne wherupon they can build no good thing for by that reason wee must denye al the holy scriptures and the office of preaching for all this haue wee from the pope
and then must wee make allso a newe scripture
then must wee forsake also the ould testame~t lest we should seeme to haue any thing fro the infidell iues

all this is but foolishnes
for christ allso found in the iuishe nation abuse emong the scribes and pharisees yet did he not therfore reiect al things which they held and tawght
but wee confesse that vnder the papacy is

myche good christianitee yea and all good christianitee
and that from thence it hath come vnto vs yea truly wee graunt that vnder the papacy is the true scripture the true baptisme the true sacrament of the aultar the true keyes of remission of synnes the true office of preaching the true cathechisme which is the lords prayer the commaundementes and the articles of the crede
say farther that vnder the papacy is the true

christianitee yea and the very true kernell of christianitee

and lest any man should thinke that

luther wrote this when as yet the light of the euangelicall veritee wherof he so myche vaunteth had not shyned vpon him let him knowe that this epistle was written

by him the yere after he had cut him self of from the churche of god at what tyme his name was very farre spred by the fame of his heresies
thus ye see how the truthe brake foorth from him against his will euen as it did thorowgh the throte of balaam

the prophet all be it he were an enemy of the truth

see you now most vertuous kyng wherunto the deuyses of sathan tend when by his sowldyar vergerius and by others of that kynd he seeketh to haue the vniuersall papacy taken away for he seeketh therin by the verdit of luther to haue taken away the true scripture true baptisme the true sacrament of the aultar the true keyes of remission of synnes the true office of preaching the true catechisme true christianitee yea and the very true kernell of christianitee
and haue not these his deuises succeded as he would haue them

first luther sowght to take away the papacy

and therunto he layd certayne foundations as we haue before shewed
for first in despight of the pope and the councell he graunted the cuppe to the laye people
then he abrogated auncie~t rytes and ceremonies and instituted newe
not long after of the

number of the vy sacramentes he tooke away and last of all he ouerthrew together both sacrifice and priesthood
but what came herof vvith in a short tyme after vp

sprang sacrame~taryes and anaptistes who tooke from vs those ij sacramentes allso of the aultar and baptisme which ij luther had yet of his curtesy left vnto vs and that did they not more in hatred or desspight of the pope then of luther him self if wee may beleue philip melancthon
for

they seing luther thus to play the pope yea and more then a pope could not broke this intollerable tyranny of the man

after this foorth came the heaue~ly prophetes

which tooke from vs both the scriptures and all externe ministery of preaching
at the last owt of what darke caues know not issued campanus and seruetus

which sowght to pull from vs our sauiour christ speaking very blasphemously of his diuinitee
this end at the last they attayned which laboured to ouerthrow the papacy and to do all thinges in despight of the pope

vse somtyme most vertuous kyng to reade the triffles of those heretikes which are of no great name that may knowe the better how things goe amongest them
my happe was emong others to hyt vpon a certaine germayne luther an named erasmus

and not only by syr name but in deed rightly caulled

all beere who wrote a booke against carolstadius and other sacramentaries anabaptistes and image breakers
therein he telleth of one iames sche~ck how

when at berlin he preached to the people the word of luther for the word of god he could not by any meanes be induced vpon the solemne feast day of easter to preache of the resurrection of our lord but vpon easter daye he would nedes preache of the passion
and of an other at francfort that would in no wyse kepe the feast of christmas daye
and why pray you forsooth in despight of the pope lest they should seeme in any thing to impart with the papacy that is to say with christianitee they had rather all the memory of christ his benefits were extinguisshed then they would celebrat the same with those christians that acknowledge the pope

you see most vertuous kyng what thinges haue followed wher the papacy hath been taken away
and this very state of thinges vergerius or rather the diuell by vergerius his solliciter seeketh now to bring allso into

your kingdom for this hath allwayes been an owld practyse of sathan as wee reade written by the holy martyr
cyprian to infest

and persecute in all he may the head ruler of the churche to the end that hauing taken away the master he might with the more violence and owtrage spoyle and ransacke the churche

neither haue heresies or schismes saith cyprian risen of any other occasion then

of that the priest of god is not obeyed and that one priest for the tyme in the churche and one iudge for the tyme in stead of christ is not thought vpon
to whom yf the whole brotherhood would be obedient according to gods teachinges no ma would make a doo against the colledge of priestes no man would make him self iudge not of the bisshopp now but of god after gods iudgement after the fauour of the people declared by their voyces at the election after the consent of his fellow bisshopps no man thorough breache of vnitee and stryfe would deuyde the churche of christ
no man standing in his owne conceyte and swelling with pryde would apart erect abrode a newe

churche
vvhom hierome following teacheth

vs that the saftye of the churche dependeth of the dignitee of the high priest to whom yf there be not geuen a certayne peerlesse power and supereminent ouer all others there will become in the church so many schismes as ther be priestes

heerby may you gather most vertuous kyng wherabout vergerius goeth when he would haue the papacy taken away for he would haue taken away what so euer remayneth of christianitee with in your kingdome or dominions he would haue schismes brovght in heresies spred abrode christ ba~nished owt of all your dominions and that farre and wyde thorowgh owt all the same might creepe this whole sathanisme which wee see hath taken syche depe roote among your neighbours of germany to the great hurt and spoyle of that nation
and to stop that this his enterpryse take not effect nothing more auayleth then vnitee
this vnitee therfore dooth he assaut with all his ingense and deuyses and earnestly laboureth to displace him by whose authoryte it cometh to passe that vnitee is reteyned in the

churche of god
for he seeth that so long as his dignitee and auctoritee remayneth in force he can proffit nothing

but weygh with your self right renoumed kyng how after some had taken away the papacy whether the same men did not soone after deuyse and attempte allso to remoue the emperour
vvhere wee see that emong them it is no lesse reproche to be caulled a caesarist then a papist
vvhat hath passed not many yeres synce in germany your

highnes is not ignorant
but those odious matters had rather passe ouer with syle~ce
it shall be expedie~t for you to remember alwayes this verse which is so common in euery mans mowth

happy is he that taketh good vewe by other me~s harme his owne to eschewe

take heed therfore lest shortly it come to passe that it be counted no lesse ignominious to be called a

regist then a papist
for to this tendeth all their deuyse to take away all order to bring the auctoritee of princes in hatred and contempt and so to induce a confuse popular gouernement without a prynce
vvher of synce vergerius is a

certayne brand and kindleth nothing but

seditions and broyles and for that he caulleth him self an exile of iesu christ and that truly for he hath in deed nothing to doo with christ euen as he hath made him self an exile of iesu christ so shall it be very well that your highnes make him an exile and bannisshed man out of your whole kingdom and dominions

he sayeth this doctryne of ihesu christ which he professeth can not sta~de in surety yf the papacy remayne in force as though ther were any one of all the heretikes of this our age who yet in this one thing doo maruelously agree that the papacy must be taken away which did not as stoutly vaunt him self to professe the doctryne of ihesu christ not withstanding that all and euery of the doo both disagree emo~g them selues and sta~d in a mere opposite of the doctryne of ihesu christ
and yf you seeke narrowly in his pack which doctryne of ihesu christ it is that he professeth suche is the ignora~ce and vnskilfulnesse of the man that beleeue he woold be myche to seeke of a direct awnswer

for so farre as we may gather of his other

writinges he is soo~tyme with the swinglia~s soomtyme with the lutherans and soomtyme with the picardines
as for the confessio of ausburge no man can well iudge him to be of in so myche as he preferreth the confession of brentius whoom he hath in especyall admiration before all other confessio~s
and that brentius dooth allowe the doctryne

of osiandre touching iustification which is the somme of the whole gospell it is well knowen
but how myche they which would be accomptyd of the confession of ausburge doo detest that doctryne it is also cleer both by the censure of the doctors of vvitte~berg and by the writinges and dooinges of mathias flaccus and ioachimus merlinus

for what reckening merlinus made of them whoo being of his flock harkened to osianders doctryne it is not vnknowen for

neither woold he allow them buryall when they were dead nor be persuadyd to affoord baptysme to their children
and can there be any man found that will suffer him self to be persuadyd that this doctryne of vergerius is the doctryne of iesu christ which not only the christyans detest but allso the germayne

luthera~s doo so excedingly abhorre that with syche as professe the same they will neither whill they be alyue nor after haue any communion or fellowship

but will taulke no more of vergerius whoom in this place thought not amysse to reme~ber to the end that eche man may perceyue how myche more openly sathan hath

layed foorth his mynd by him then by those which by certayne vnderminynges labour to blowe vp and ouerthrowe the vnitee of the churche in seeming at the first to requyre nothing but the cuppe and that they are farre wyde whiche thinke that co~cord may growe between the christians and lutherans yf the cuppe might be graunted to the laytee and wyues to the priestes
a goodly concord suerly wherin not the vyces of the papacy which men would leeke well ynowgh but the whole papacy shall be taken away that is to say all christianitee abolisshed
but because wee haue now spoken sufficiently of these thinges let vs retourne to our principall matter

our purpose was to wryte chieffly of the

expresse word of god
vvherof wee haue

shewed you that the heretykes do as myche or more glory and vawnt as do the catholykes and right beleuers

vvee haue also shewed that we contend

not with them about the expresse word of god or the gospell but about the interpretations and expositio~s of them which are departed fro vs to whom we may well vse the same wordes which augustine sometyme

vsed against the donatistes that against christ they beare the enseigne of christ and against the gospell they glory of the gospell which they vnderstand not

vve haue allso shewed this that wereuerently

receyue all the canonicall scriptures and that they on the other syde for so muche as they will not in faith be subiect to

the auctoritee of the scriptures but seeke to make the same thrawl vnto them do not receiue in the but that which seemeth to accord with their owne doctrine that they frame to the wordes of the scripture their owne priuat sence and that they contend not with vs about the sence and mynd of the scripture but about their owne sence vndersta~di~g therof which rather the we would

adore as the pure word of god against the co~uio sence and co~sent of the whole church we are redy to do and suffer all thinges
for wee are persuaded that so to do were right idolatry
synce therfore wee haue at large shewed why wee can not agree with the enemyes of the gospell which by the wordes of the gospell assault the same and contend with vs about their owne mynd and not the mynd of the scripture wee will brieffly discourse the cause why we can not so do

first the most seuere commaundements

of god forbid vs to geue eare or consent vnto them according to these wordes if any man preache vnto you any other gospel then that which ye haue receyued let him be accursed if any man speake blasphemie against the holy ghost it shall not be remitted vnto him
flee from idoles
seeing therfore these men be syche as preache vnto vs a gospell which wee haue not receyued and syche as speake blasphemy against the holy ghost and seeke to be adored of vs as certayne idolls wee obeying the commaundements of god are iustly feared fro consenting with them

and lest any man thinke wee applye

these scriptures to our owne proper sence we will in fewe shewe how the auncient catholyke fathers haue expou~ded them to the end euery man may plainly perceiue that wee doo very truly vse them against these enemyes of the gospell

and first who is ther to who the name of athanasius is not knowe and wel thowght of

vvho as cyrill writeth adorned heauen

it self with the workes he wrote as it were with a most fragrant oyntment

this father therfore in his booke which he intituled of the incarnation of christ as it is by cyrill cited vseth these wordes

vvho so euer besyde these thinges teacheth out of the holy scripture that there is one sonne of god and an other sonne borne of the virgin mary and adopted for a sonne only in suche sorte as wee men be so that there be two sonnes etc
or yf any ma saye that the fleshe of our lord came from aboue and not of the virgin mary or the whole diuinitee to haue been co~founded or chaunged into the fleshe or the deitie of our lord to be passible or that the fleshe of our lord as of man is not to be adored this man dooth the holy and

catholyke churche accurse following therin the holy apostles saying if any man preache

vnto you any other gospel the that which ye haue receiued let him be accursed

behould this good father whose memory in the churche is holy and immortal sayth he is accursed of the catholyke churche who so euer should go about to teache yea though it were owt of the holy scriptures any of these poyntes
but holy father by what auctoritee thinkest thou that may be done yf he teache the same owt of the scriptures for sooth sayth he by the auctoritee of pawll who sayd if any man preache

vnto you any other gospell then that which ye haue receiued let him be accursed

a marueilous matter the same sentence which the heretikes of our age haue allwayes in their mowthe wherby they thinke as with a ramme of iron to assault and ouerthrow the whole auctoritee of the fathers and cou~cells thou bringest foorth on the co~trary syde
to wyt yf any man shal goe about to saye yea though it be out of the scriptures the co~trary of that which hath bene defyned in lawfull councells of the fathers

especially generall and by them deliuered to vs from hand to ha~d thou thinkest him not only not to be harkened vnto but allso to be accursed and that wee must firmly remayne in that which wee haue receiued though a man bring neuer so many textes of scripture in apparence to the contrary

athanasius will not that the children

should iudge of the decrees of the fathers
he will not that syche thinges as hath once been tryed by the rule of the scriptures should agayne be caulled back to the same vnlesse they will shewe them selues not to

be laufull children but the seed of the harlot and adulteresse which if they dare do let them crye tyll they be hoarse for it is writte as the father of heretikes attempting christ once did yet maketh he no doubt by the doctrine of pawll to hould them accursed because they preache a contrary gospell to that which they receiued

but did holy athanasius when he wrote thus teache vs to contemne and holde for nawght the expresse word of god no god forbid it was neuer any part of his thought but he would haue taken for the pure and

expresse word of god that which the catholikes and not which the heretikes browght foorth that sense saye which the catholikes not which the heretikes drewe foorth of the scriptures

vve fynd notably written by hierome

that the gospell standeth not in the wordes of the scripture but in the sense not in the superficiall face or shewe but in the marye not in the leaues full of wordes but in the roote of reason
you see now how the most earnest defender of the catholyke and ryght faith produced these wordes of pawl with whose only auctoritee namely synce he standeth in place of many we will for this tyme be content lest we seeme to long

but yet agayne though perhapps wee maye herein doe otherwyse then becometh vs to the end the truth may the more plainly appere wee thinke it not amysse to bringe foorth euen an heretikes exposition of these wordes of pawl and of that heretike whose

mynd touching the sacrame~t melancthon is sayd to haue followed
he therfore speaketh in this sort intreating vpon those very wordes of pawll

note this worde of the apostle accepistis

ye haue receyued for styl the apostle laboureth to this end that they should not hange as it were in the ayre vpon an vnknowen gospell only by way of imagination but should hould for a certayne and sure definition therof that that was the true gospell of

christ which was deliuered vnto them and which they had receyued
he commaundeth therfore that they should be reputed for diuells which would presume to bryng any other gospell differing from his calling that another gospell wherunto other me~s inuentions are ioyned

and surely this his sentence though he were an heretike we can not but in this poynt very well allowe
for he will not haue any vnknowen gospell receyued but that which hath been deliuered vnto vs and which we haue allready before receyued
but nowe that which is of these men termed the gospell and the expresse word of god came to light in manner but yesterday and was to our fathers vtterly vnknowen
may we not therfore with hierom aptly say thus vnto these fellowes that so earnestly labour to obtrude this new fownd gospell vnto vs

vvhat so euer thou be thou teacher of

new doctrynes pray the forbeare the romaine eares forbeare the faith which hath been recommended vnto vs from the mouth of the apostles
vvhy doest thow seeke after iiijc yeres but wee may now say after fourtene yeres and more to teach vs now that wee knew not before vvhy doest thow bryng foorth that which peter and pawll would not shewe the christian world hath been withowt this doctrine vntill this daye
will for my part being now an owld man hould that fayth wherin being a chyld was borne and bred
vvhat a madnes then were this yf wee should now receyue a straunge vnknowen gospell and reiect that which wee hould by deliuery vnto vs from those holy fathers

for yf they meane the name of the gospell those bookes which wee haue written by the euangelistes and apostles and before them by the prophettes that gospell hath polonia had and receyued

almost this vic yeres past neither is ther any amo~g vs that doubteth but that in the same is the expresse word of god vvherfore as touching the scripture it is none other

ghospell which the heretikes would at this daye obtrude vnto vs but the same which we professe allredy
yea and that is more they openly confesse that they haue receyued the whole canonicall scripture from vs

vvhat gospell then praye you is that which they preache vnto vs forsooth such

a ghospell wherunto as caluin writeth other mens inuentio~s and deuyses are ioyned wherof they bring a straunge sence hitherto vnheard of in the churche of god
and this is it wherof pawll geueth warning saying yf any man preache vnto you any other gospell then that which you haue receyued let him be accursed
that is as myche to saye if luther caluin or melancthon come vnto you and preache the gospell to any other sence or meaning then that which you haue receyued of the blessed fathers yf he tell you any thing contrary to that which they haue deliuered vnto you let him be accursed

be wee not thinke you by these wordes of pawll iustly fearyd from taking the inuentions and deuyses of these men for the true word of god namely synce this is truly sayd

to be a synne against the holy ghost and to blaspheme the same when by contempt wee violat those thinges which haue been deliuered vnto vs by the fathers
vvhich thing that blessed bisshop damasus teacheth vs

in these wordes

voluntary breakers of the canons sayth he are greuously iudged of the holy fathers and condemned by the holy ghost by whose instinct and gift they were decreed
for rightly seeme they to blaspheme the holy ghost which against those holy cano~s do any thing voluntarely or frowardly not co~pelled by necessitee or presume to speake against them or willingly consent to any that attempt so to doo
for syche presumption is manifestly

one kynd of blasphemy against the holy ghost
yow see how this holy man telleth vs it is one kynd of blasphemy against the holy ghost

yf a man presume to do or speake frowardly or malapertly against those thinges which are deliured vnto vs from the fathers
therfore lest wee should become giltye of this kynd of blasphemy wee dare by no meanes consent to these men who thinke it a matter to be fled fro as a pestile~t poyson

of sathan which the catholikes and right beleuers haue taught by the space of so many hundreth yeres which the ouctoritee of the churche hath deliuered all christian people imbraced and the schooles of the diuines mayntayned and on the other syde would haue vs to esteeme the dreames of their owne brayne as the very pure and expresse word of god especially synce wee are twyse warned by these wordes of pawll in one epistle that yf any man preache vnto you

any other gospell then that which ye haue receyued let him be accursed

but chieffly that feareth vs which is

spoken by the prophet depart ye fro idolls vvhich thing allso pawll dooth itterate vnto vs cryeng out flee from the worshipping of idolls which iohn the euangelist

dooth allso repete vnto vs concluding that his notable epistle with these wordes my children keepe ye from idolls
but what be

not trow you luther caluin melancthon and brencius very idolls is there not in these menne a wonderfull heygth lifting it self vp against the knowledge of god doo they not resist and withstand and which

is the property of sathan doo they not extoll themselues aboue all which is sayd or

worshipped as god shewing them selues as it were god and seeke to haue worshipped of all men as the expresse word of god what so euer they wryte or say

but here lest wee seeme to apply these thinges according to the vision of our owne hart as heretikes vse to doo let vs in fewe lay open what the holy fathers haue taught to be signified in the scriptures vnder the names of idolls
hierome expounding that place of zachary will destroy the names

of idolls from of the earth sayth that by these wordes are signifyed not only those idolls wherof we read in the psalmes the

images of the gentills made of siluer and gould being the workes of mens handes but allso those wherof pawll speaketh sayeng

but the spirit telleth vs manifestly that in the latter dayes some shall depart from the faith geuing eare to seducing spirites and to the doctrine of diuells teaching faulse vnder hipocrisy hauing their consciences marked with an hot yron

for euen as idolls sayth he are made by

the hand of the worke man so the peruerse doctrine of heretikes what so euer it self deuyseth it turneth into an idoll and maketh antechrist to be worshipped for christ

leekewyse intreating vppo that place of the

prophet esay their land is full of idolls the workes of their owne handes haue they worshipped and that which their owne fyngers haue made hath man bowed vnto and

humbled him self idolls he interpreteth to be doctrines contrary to the truthe
neither will he haue otherwyse vnderstanded that which is written by the prophett osee they made their siluer and gowld idolls to them selues that they might perishe

augustine allso after he had spoken many

thinges of idolls made with handes ther is sayth he a worse and more base worshipping of idolls when men worship their owne fancyes and honour with the name of religion what so euer they haue imagined in their erring myndes puft vp with pryde and vayn glory
of which kynd of fanceys and vayne visions he interpreteth iosue allso to speake in that place where he sayeth take

away straunge gods from emong you and enclyne

your hartes to the lord your god

leekewyse that place of ezechiell of my gould of my siluer hast thou made to thy self images

but the images of their fanceys

sayth he wherin their carnall soules delight to wallowe ouerturne both all the sacramentes and all the wordes of the holy bookes
but yet it followeth not because those images be faulse that therfore the sacrame~tes and scriptures should be so myche dishonoured that they should be thowght to be theirs because our lord sayd of my gowld and of my siluer

vincentius lirinensis allso a writer of that tyme sayth that the owld testament caulleth straunge gods syche doctrines as are straunge and diuers from the churche because heretikes make no lesse a doo to the mayntenance of their owne opinions then the gentills did for their gods wher allso it is written in the deuteronomy if there

ryse emo~g you a prophet that foretel you any signe or wonder which cometh to passe as he hath spoken and he sayeth vnto you let vs go after straunge gods whom you knowe not thou shalt not harken to the wordes of

that prophet for the lord your god proueth you that it may appere whether you loue him with all your hart and with all your soule or no

here sayth he by straunge gods are signified

straunge newe and vnknowe errours which god somtyme suffreth to be spred that he may trye our constancy in louing of him and in cleauing to his sound doctrine according as it is allso written by pawll there must be heresies for this cause sayth vincentius the auctors of heresies are not by and by rooted vp to the end that they which are tryed may be seen how faithfull and constant and how stedfast a louer he is of the catholike fayth
and in deed sayth he when any nouelty boyleth vp by and by is seen the wayght of the corne from the lightnes of the chaffe
then very easely is blowen away with the ayre that which by no wayght was kept in our lordes barne flower
for some are blowen quyte away some only streeken and being wounded as persons half dead and halfe a lyue are affrayed to perishe and asshamed to retourne as men which had only receyued syche quantite of poyson as

neither would kyll nor be digested nor force them to dye nor suffer them to lyue

heerby it may easely appere what the auncient fathers thowght to be signified in the scriptures by the name of idolls to wyt heretikes and their faulse doctrine
for to imbrace as the very word of god the saying of any one man teaching in ma~ner all thinges contrary to the receyued doctrine of the whole churche and to adore and inclyne vnto what so euer he hath sayed or writte what can be a kindly idolatry yf this be not vvhich who so doeth what doeth he els but adore antechrist for christ

luther sayth that which teache is the word of god and the pure gospell
by and by they adore and inclyne vnto it as before an idoll
the same sayth zuinglius and caluin the anabaptistes and the picardines suenckfeldius seruetus campanus and diuers other heretikes they brynge foorth cer+tayne textes of the scripture wrested into a

wrong sence and by and by this word of men or rather of the diuell speaking by men simple persons doo imbrace and adore as the word of god and the very gospell of

christ
horrible is this idolatry and to be

fled from with full sayle as they say according to the warning geuen vs by the prophetes and apostles
for what other thinge can follow herof but that whyle euery sect vaunteth his owne word to be the expresse word of god their sectaryes and followers must nedes haue so many gods as there be archheretikes

doo you now marke most vertuous kyng to what end sathan dooth by so many his diuers members make so great vaunt and bragging of the expresse word of god there is no one heretike of this our age which hath not allwayes that in his mouth which dooth not glory therof and so particularly challenge the same vnto himself alone as that he will exclude all others from the possession therof
the mynd therfor of sathan

is that wee should bowe downe now before this man and now before that and that we should imbrace nowe his word and now an other mans as the very word of god and so instead of one god worshippe many idolls and in place of one christ bowe downe to many antechristes

but lett vs harken to the voyce of the prophets and apostles crying vnto vs flee fro idolls flee fro idols flee fro the peruers doctrines of luther caluin melancthon and brentius flee as many as be of them which wil haue their owne fanceys worshipped for idolls and labour to haue what so euer they saye or thinke to be adored as the pure word of god and the very gospell

but see most gracious kyng how these germayne gods can not abyde one an other but euen lyke homer his gods make warre emong them selues
speake not in this place of those deadly bataylles and innumerable slaughters wherewith vnhappy germany hath been miserably afflicted synce they beganne to worship these gods and to receyue what so euer was by them sayd or written as the expresse word of god
but harken how the gods them selues which doo thus set to sale to the vnlerned multitude their owne word for gods word do quarrell and braule emong them selues

did not luther as an enemy inuade and set vppon zuinglius and his followers and leekwyse vpon the anabaptistes did he not

labour as myche as he could to cut the throtes of both those wicked sectes vvhom he thought meet not only to be brydeled by his writinges but allso to be kept vnder by the mace of the magistrate
therfore not only emong christians but allso emong the lutherans

them selues is so sore detested the name of zuinglians and anabaptistes that they are as the prouerb sayeth forbidden fyre and water emong them and yf any lutheran

receyue or harbor any of them he is by order greuously punisshed

and pray you be the zuinglians any

more mylde to the lutherans in deed they doo not persecute them with the lyke cruelty
not that they lacke any good wil therto but because they fynd them selues vnable
for they well perceyue their strength is not yet syche that they be able to matche them
but of what mynd they be toward the lutherans it is by their wrytings manyfest to all men for they make euen the lyke accompt of the lutherans as the lutherans

doo of them
the wrytinges of iohn caluin and iohn alasco against ioachimus vvestphalus and against the cityes of saxony doo

well witnesse this
bucer allso wrote that luther was accused of all men to be a man to full of wordes very imperious and ouer bitter not hauing the pacyence to be contraryed by any man which fault the tigurins allso charge him with
if he looke sayth bucer speaking of luther that no man should in any one thing dissent from him then let him proue him self to be a god couertly meaning therby that he sought to be reuerenced as a god and to haue his word adored of all men as the word of god brefly that it were no more laufull for any man to dissent from his mynd then from the sente~ce of god
thus you see his very fellowes thought intollerable this his exceding pryde wherby he presumed to sytte in the temple of god euen as he were god himself

but dooth not caluin allso co~playne that

the churche of god is to imperiously bownd to the deuyses of luther how greuously dooth he take it that they dresse him vp with the spoyle of iohn baptist and call him helias by whom all thinges were to be restored vvith which falshed they did no lesse distayne the name of luther sayth he

then the egyptians did the body of hieremy by worshipping his sepulchre

and yf sayth he the name of helias were to be graunted to luther yet was it a poynt of sacrilegious temeritee to affirme him to be the last helias as though the hand of god were shortnyd that he could not hereafter send a better or at the lest an other as good as he
for by what oracle was it oppened vnto them that the treasures of the mighty power of god were so myche diminisshed and wasted in the person of one man that out of so great and incomprehensible a number the lyke of him might not be found here caluin could not dissemble the grudge he had co~ceyued in that luther was thus caulled the last helias wherby no place was now left for him who thought himself in no poynt inferiour but rather superiour to luther

but ioannes alasco who dooth seeme almost

to consent with caluin beside that in many places he shewyth himself to thinke very yll of luther as it is noted by erasmus albere he writeth thus allso of the lutherans that when all their stuff is spent then they vse to flee to the confession of

augspurg as to their shooteanker and make sayth he so myche a doo of that that there want not emong them yea and not of the meanest sort which say they had rather

dowbt of the doctrine of the apostle pawll then of luthers or of that which is contayned in that confession

you see how the sacramentaryes themselves can not beare that the contentes of luthers bookes or of the augustan confession should be receyued as the word of god though with some for all that it be of more pryse then the word of god
and shall wee christia~s beare that which the lewde zuinglians can not beare and shall wee suffer that to be obtruded vnto vs for the expresse word of god which wee most certainly knowe and haue proued to be the expresse word of the diuell

but some there be perhapps that will in this case geue the lesse credyt to the iudgement of the zuinglians for that the world seeth they dissent from the doctrine of luther
let vs see therfore what iudgement the lutherans them selues haue one of an other
thinke no man will denye but the

confessionistes be luthera~s vvherof though

andreas osiander were himself one yet dooth he not complayne that with his followers the confession of augspurg is more regarded then the word of god and that they which procede masters of art and professors of diuinitee at vvittemberge abiure the word of god and sweare to be subiect to the worde of melancthon marke yee how this fellow condemneth the disciples of melancthon of idolatry and warneth them to flee from this idoll

but to come to melancthon himself did

not he at the first with tooth and nayle defend and esteeme no lesse then the very word of god these doctrines of luther that man hath no free wyll that all thinges happen by absolute necessitee that man feelith no more what god dooth within him then the anuyll feelith what the hammer dooth that workes are not necessary to saluation that no rytes or ceremonyes owght to be admitted into the churche

yet afterward complainyng that he had been to seruilly bond to luther he reiected these his toyes and came to a better mynd

for which cause yet he bred to him self so great hatred yea euen of his owne disciples that they pittefully reuyled him and sought to exclude him from the confession of augspurg wherof it is knowe he was the author

but mathias flaccus is not affrayed to arrogat yet more vnto him self and sticketh not to pronounce his master melancthon to who he was behoulding and all the adherentes

of his doctrine vnworthy to be acco~pted other then very ethnikes and publicans and to make his meaning playne he thus interpreteth him self that no good ma~+ought to haue any familiaritee freendship or co~pany with them and to him which not being especially bound to them by necessitee of lawe should doo any of these thinges he pronounceth the contagion of their lepre and so without all doubt the wrath of god
and that thinke was the cause that

at the last conference at vvormes schneppius merlinus strigellius saerius and certayn other illiricans departed thence without doing any thing for that they thought the fellowship of melancthon and brentius both whom flaccus had excommunicated

from his congregation was of them to be auoyded
namely synce none of them gaue any shewe of inclination to any syche retourne or amendment as they requyred

vvho therfore is there which dooth not now see as cleer as the day light that these be the idolls which the prophetes and apostles so earnestly exhort vs to flee from the heretikes say of this our age luther caluin melancthon bre~tius flaccus they commaund vs to flee as from the vyper and cockatryce for so doo they emong them selues and by their owne iudgement one of an other condemne them selues
but may not wee myche the more iustly accompt them for syche as they are become not only by the iudgement of the catholike church which

wee are commaunded to harken vnto but allso by their owne iudgement one of an other and shall there now be any man that may persuade vs which acknowledge and honour only one god to adore the word of these heretikes as the expresse word of god

christ which hast allmost this
yeres

shyned ouer this countrey with the light

of thy gospell rather take from vs all our worldly goodes the sweet fruition of this lyght yea all thinges which are in this world most dere to mortall men then once to suffer vs to be remoued fro this mynd wherin wee are determyned rather to doo and suffer all thinges then to depart from that thy holly word which allmost

yers past was by thy goodnes deliuered and impartid to our nation and in stead therof to receyue their word which set them selues in the temple as gods and so thrall our selues to the most greuous cryme of horrible idolatry

but to retourne wher wee leeft trust wee haue sufficiently shewyd that the word which is now by heretikes set to sale to the vnlerned multitude for the expresse word of god is not in deed the word of god but the word of the diuel fro the which the min+des of all good men ought to abhorre and to flee from as a deadly poyson according to the wordes of the prophets and apostles which styll crye vnto vs flee from idolls
nowe

is it tyme to blowe the retraict but that we meane first a litle to discusse vnto you what

is the expresse word of god to the end that when you knowe the same the expresse word of the diuell may the better be discerned

there are truly in the scriptures many

wordes of god but they all make but one word of god which is loue for al the lawe sayth the apostle is fulfylled in this one word
and in this dependeth not only the whole lawe but allso the prophetes as christ him self witnesseth the fulnes of the lawe therfore and the end of all the commaundements is charyte
for therunto is referred euery one of the commaundements

seeke none other thing sayth augustine in any of the scriptures let no man geue you any other precept
vvhat so euer is darke in the scripture charyte lyeth hidde theri and what so euer is playne in the scripture there allso is charyte open and playne
this

precept of charitee is aboue and ouer al the heauens and ouer al bookes all bookes are subiect and vnder this euery toung of holly men and euery mocyon of the dispensors of god and of the mynde and body· serueth vnder this onsigne what so euer thou hast and hast not this it proffiteth thee nothing

other thinges yf thou haue not yet haue

this and thou hast fulfylled the lawe
if this alone be absent all is emptye· yf this alone be present all is full
this only it is which suffiseth to saluation and is so necessary to saluation as ther is no meane wherby a man may hope to atteyne the same without charitee

this word therfore which dooth consummat

and abbreuiat this liuely and sauing word this word of charitee and loue is so expresse and playne that clemens alexandrinus

sayth
it may be learned euen without the scriptures for that it is a certayn lawe of the spirite written in the hartes of the faythful be they neuer so simple and vnlerned
no man therfore can be so dull as not to vnderstand this word neither shall any man be excused thorough ignoraunce therof
this is that word wherof the psalmist speaketh saying thy word is a candle

to my feet and a light vnto my pathes
vvherof he allso speaketh wher he sayeth thy precept is cleer geuing light to the

eyes

in deed the eyes of our hart are lightned by charitee as on the other syde they be

blynded by coouetousnesse
vvhither the coouet ousnesse or desyer be of the flesh or of the eyes or of prayse and glory vvher that is there is nothing but meer darcknesse nothing but a fowll dimnesse
on the other syde wher charite is ther is a shining light yea so cleer and bryght that nothing can be darke to him that hath charite therfore it is very well sayd of augustine

let him

loue and haue charite that will come to the knowledge of god in vayne cometh he to reading meditation preaching or praying which loueth not but because loue and charite can not be perfect in any other place then in that heauenly contrey of the blessed sainctes therfore the knowledge of him shall in the end ther allso and no wher ells become perfaict
here in the meane tyme in

part wee knowe and in part wee prophecy

vvherfore yf any man marueyll why as emo~g other heretikes so allso emo~g the confessionistes them selues ther is so great a myst and darcknes that after the manner of the andabates they fyght wyncking or in the darke and can not atteyne to the knowledge of the truth let him now cease wondring

synce he hath learned this to be the cause

therof that they be destitute of that charitee which only geueth light to the faithful
for they would neuer haue deuided vnitee yf they had not first lost charite which is the bond of peace and vnitee
but for this cause are they destitute of charite for that they be full of couetous desire as of many other thinges so chieffly of prayse and vayne glory
according to that is written by the poet he is a rare ma that can geue ouer and renounce his owne wyt

nothing so myche hindreth the fynding

out of the truth as pryde which is the moother of all heresies for ther are euer brawles emong prowde men
but to attayne to the truth ther is none other waye but humillite by the which charitee is noorisshed and vnitee reteyned

and that humillitee is sayth augustine the first second and

thyrd vertue and so foorth how often so euer you should aske of me that aunswer would styll make as it is writte demosthenes somtyme spake of pronunciation

by this way synce heretikes walke not who can myche marueil though they can not atteyne

to the knowledge of the cleer truth vvhat a reuell kepe they both with vs and emong themselues about the expresse word of god yet in the meane tyme can they not see that which is the most expresse clere and playne thing in all the scriptures and as clere as

the sunne shinyng and which alone to haue lerned doth abundantly suffise vs to saluation to wit charitee
for that is the somme and end of the whole scripture as is very wel written by augustine saying

vvho so euer thinking him self to vnderstand

the holy scriptures and euery part therof and yet by that vnderstanding doth not buyld vp this dooble charitee toward god and his neyghbour he vnderstandeth nothing
but who so euer draweth out therof syche an vnderstanding as is proffitable to the building vp and working of charitee though he speake not the very same which he whom he readeth may be proued to haue ment in that place yet for so myche as he is deceyued by syche an vnderstanding as yet worketh charitee he is not hurtfully deceyued neither dooth he therin alltogether lye but he is so deceyued as a man which hauing

lost his waye dooth yett by coasting co me to that place wherunto that direct waye would haue brought him

augustine aduyseth in reading of the scriptures so to vnderstand them as charitee be wrought therby yf wee will not erre to destruction

but doo these men which now a dayes haue nothing more in their mowth then the scriptures and the expresse word of god apply their vnderstanding to this end that they labour to worke and buyld vp nothing but charitee nay whoo seeth not that they doo vtterly all that euer they doo to the contrary vvhich may well appere by these their wordes then the which none are more common emong them

trotz trotz in despight of the pope and in despight of the councell
is this to buyld vp charitee

but wherof growe ther emong vs so many debates contentions seditions warres heresies and sectes wherby wee see the churche myserably torne and deuided but of this only that whiles euery priuatt man cacheth vnto him self the expresse word of god and seeketh to vsurpe and appropriatt

vnto him self the right vnderstanding therof nothing is lesse sought in reading the scriptures then the edifying of loue

and charitee vve see the rude and vnlerned multitude with an intollerable pryde and without wasshing their handes or feete as they saye come vnto the reading of the holy scriptures yea wee see foolishe and fond woomen arrogat so myche vnto them selues that condemning their fathers dispising their bisshops and teachers setting at naught the sence and consent of the whole churche they are not affrayed to preferre their owne expositions before all others vvhom yet they know to haue been conuersant in the scriptures many yeares

both day and night and to haue omitted no study labour or diligence to atteyne vnto the trewe vnderstanding therof whom they allso knowe to be set ouer them and that they owght in those matters to be subiect vnto them in so myche as they haue

the carke and care to make a iust and good accompt of their soules
is this to buyld vp charitee yet thus hath it seemed good to the archeheretyke of our age who first presumed

to geue that was holly vnto dogges and to throwe pearles before swyne vnder

whose feete how filthily they be troden who can without teares behould

notable is that saying of gregory nazianzen

that it is not for all men to talke of diuine matters no nor lauful at all tymes and in all companyes to dispute of all thinges
but good regard is to be had when to whom and to what end that is to be doone which matter he pursueth at large

nothing is better then the reading of the scriptures nothing more proffitable
but there is a certayn tree caullyd rhododaphne

in englishe osiander whose leaues are to beastes poyson and to men medicynable against serpentes
euen leeke vnto this is the scripture which as to sober and wyse men it geueth holsome nouriture so to foolishe and wycked persons it ministreth occasion of heresy and of more wickednes
but were it not better to keepe these brute beastes to whom christ forbadde to geue that which was holy fro the reading of the holy scriptures then to suffer them lyke spyders to drawe nothing therof but deadly poyson

but as for wemen how myche better should they be occuped in spinning on their distaff at syche tyme as they take on them to dispute of the word of god be all apostles be all prophetes be al pastors and teachers sayth the apostle
but now all will be apostles

all prophetes al pastours and teachers yea wemen and all
christ would not that his body should be only one member but that ther should be theru~to many me~bers now these folke on the other syde will haue that all should be one member and one grosse substaunce all of a facyo not distincted with any varietee but a certayne vnfrutful heape and confused chaos without apte proportio or measure
by which meanes not only the body is weakened and the order of nature peruerted but the auctoritee of god is allso manifestly shaken whyle euery man vsurpeth to him self more then is geue him

hereof groweth the dissencion sectes and quarrelles wherwith the christian world is now tormoyled while neither the hand nor the foote will vouchesaff to doo his duety but euery member will take on him the office of the eye and the toong and so neglecting

his owne impudently intrude him self into

the office of an other

but these perhapps may seeme soo~what fro the matter which haue now taken in hand
yet is it not alltogether fro my purpose and matter
but now to returne to my especyall poynt will yow know most vertuous kyng what is the expresse word of god and what is

the expresse word of the diuell for both as haue before sufficie~tly shewed at large may be drawe out of one and the self same scripture but yet learne in a fewe the differe~ce

if a man so vnderstand the scripture as he doo therby edifye and buyld vp charite then is it the word of god
but yf by his vnderstanding therof he buyld that which is contrary to charitee then is it become the word of the diuell
yea and that is more marke this
if a ma out of the holy scriptures

drawe that sence which may be proffitable to the increase and edifying of charitee all be it he saye not the very same which whom he readeth as mathewe marke luke or pawll may be proued in that place to haue ment yet is he not hurtfully deceyued neither dooth he erre from the word of god but

he is so deceiued as a man which strayeth somewhat out of his direct waye and yet by coasting in a fayre playne champion cometh to the same place wher vnto that other way would haue brought him

as therfore they which by sailyng cut the foming seas haue especiall regard to the

pole and the lode starre called cynosura and vrsa minor so they that trauayll in reading of the scriptures must direct the eyes of their myndes to none other thing but only to charitee wher vnto yf they bend their vnderstanding they can neuer swarue from the word of god seing as sayd a lytle before all the wordes of god are but one word of god which is loue
then the which word nothing is or can be in the scriptures more playne and cleer

vvhat a fury therfore is this what a madnes vvhat a blyndnes of mynd the expresse word of god is sought myche stryuing ther is about the same and yet when the same so

expresse and cleer word of god dooth offer it self before our eyes it is not seen
vvhen it dooth inculcate it self into our eares it is not heard
vvhen it offereth it self willingly

as it were to be handled with our handes yet is it not acknowledged or receyued
but wretched men they suffer the same lightly to passe away from their eyes eares handes and hartes while they falsely persuade them selues that their saluation consisteth in knowing and reasoning and not rather in louing and beleuing
doth not that place of

the psalme rightly tooche those men
eyes haue they and shall not see eares and shall not heare handes and shall not fele charitee charitee charite doth in euery place of the scriptures come toward vs and offreth it self vnto our eyes it is of al other the cleerest word of god and without that who so euer thinketh knowledge will bring him to saluation he is farre wyde

very truly sayth a vertuous and lerned

man

the clemency of god regardeth not with how great knowledge wee beleue but with how great deuotio we loue that which we beleue
and an other vertuous ma also

sayeth in the last day wee shall not be asked how myche how sharpe and how lerned our vnderstanding was but how great our affection and zeale to our lord god that is

how simple how right how vertuous humble and deuout and how willing and faythfull our seruyce toward him hath been

vvhich thinges being so why doo we not rather spend our whole study and labour in this poynt which only and alone we knowe to be necessary to our saluation to reteyne among our selues mutuall loue and brotherly charitee which is the very proper marke of the childre of god

in so myche as the vndersta~ding of the scriptures is not to all men a leeke necessary
the simplicitee of beleuing

not the quicknes of vnderstanding keepeth safe the vnlerned multitude
and as the same augustine sayth
the man which trusteth to faith hope and charitee and fast reteyneth them hath no need of the scriptures vnlesse it be to teache others
and therfore by these three many lyue well in desertes and solitary places without bookes

now contrarely all men will search the scriptures and dispute of the sence and vnderstanding therof
but that wher vnto as to a certayne marke al the scriptures are referred and that which those scriptures labour to inculcate in euery place into the

eyes eares and myndes of men that charitee saie which only bringeth saluation no ma~careth to reteyne
and verely looke how myche the oftener and more feruent disputation is made of the scriptures and of the expresse word of god so myche the more dooth charitee which all the scriptures doo with one voyce sounde out vnto vs wexe could in the mindes of men

and is it leekly that the sound vnderstanding of the scriptures and the expresse word of god is there wher charite is wexen

so could and hatred so hot vvhere besides rayling reuyling skofing and contumelyes a man can allmost read or heare nothing and where they them selues which are departed fro vs who had rather be called gospellers then christians doo not only fight against vs but allso one against an other with syche infest ra~ckorous and vnchristian myndes that no cruell barbarians or enemyes of christ his crosse could deale more leeke enemyes

truly before this gospell sprang vp which is proceded from none lesse then fro christ wee neuer sawe any syche bitternes of myndes

or cruell contentions
namely emong those whose office was to teache and open the gospel of christ
and shall wee cal this the gospell shall we call this the expresse word of god from the which all charitee the thing most expressly commaunded in the gospell is so vanished that euen they which glory to haue been the

first which as them selues say haue of late brought to light the buryed gospell doo so hatefully contend emong them selues burne with syche mutuall enuy and so byte one an other that

it can not be long but wee must nedes see them consumed one of an other

this is sure the expresse word of the diuell not the expresse word of god seing as haue allredy so often sayd the expresse word of god is only loue and charitee

that is it that imbraceth vnitee that ioyneth vs all

in one body that geueth peace and with pure hart keepeth the same

and christia charitee can not be kept but in the vnitee of the churche so that in vayne doth he vaunt him selfe to haue charite which doth not imbrace vnitee
but yf this expresse word of god charitee be not kept any where

but in the vnitee of the church who is there that can thinke that the expresse word of god can be found any where out of this vnitee

and this is it that in this treatyce shewed before that somtyme when two men bringe foorth one self text of scripture yet god openeth the mouth of one and the diuel of the other
for he which hauing deuided him self from the churche alleageth it not with the common sence and vnderstanding of the churche but with his owne priuat and wrested interpretatio for so myche as iohn sayeth vvho so euer speaketh of him

self yea though he speake scripture yet vttereth he a lye the mouth of that man doth the diuell open and that which he speaketh is the word of the diuell

but allthough following ambrose wee sayd that charite is the thing which imbra cyth and conteyneth vnitee and which makyth vs all one body wee would not be vnderstanded in that sence as though we me~t therby that euyll and vniust men were excludyd from the body of christ which is the churche
for allthough charitee which the

scripture chieffly commendyth vnto vs be the proper marke of them which doo truly honour god wherby the children of god are discernyd from the childre of the diuel and that those be only they which appertayne to the coompany of the elect yet is there a certayne

other congregacyon or churche of the that are called from the which they be not excluded which are destitute of true charite so they reteyne that which augustine calleth the loue of vnite by the which he sayeth the members of crist are couppled vnto him
the working wherof is to suffer al thing

that ther may be as the same augustine writeth a certain force of suffring houlding the sure handfast of vnitee which was signified by the pytche wherwith the

arke being a figure of the churche was fastned and sodred both within and without for euill men are to be suffred both with in and without lest the knot of peace be dissolued

of which charite allso augustine writeth

in an other place saying

do not thinke any ma to be so vnwyse as to beleue that he which hath no charite doth appertayne to

the vnite of the churche whe it is certayne that they doo belonge to the vnitee of the churche so long as they be not cut of from the same yea though they be destitute of the other effectes of charitee so that reteyning that force or vertu of suffring they be emo~g them of whom pawll writeth supporting

one an other in charite carefull to preserue the vnitee of the spirite in the bond of peace

but here these fellowes will denye that to be the churche of god which we professe and wherof we glory and reioyce to be the hu~ble children and wil go about to challenge that name to their congregation
but would fayne haue them shewe vs their churche
speake not now of the sacrame~taries anabaptistes heaue~ly prophetes nor of the campanians or seruetians all which sectes they haue allredy throwen out of their congregation but let the confessionistes or lutherans shewe vs their churche

melancthon and his followers brentius also with his bande are throwen foorth of that churche which would be counted of the augustan not christian confession as

wee may plainly see by the writinges of mathias flaccus and ioachimus merlinus who glory themselues to be vpright perfect lutherans
but yf any man will geue more credyt to the iudgement of melancthon or of his disciple iustus menius then shal he fynd that they geue the like iudgeme~nt of flaccus as flaccus doth of them

vvhere then shall wee now fynde this

churche of luther melancthon will not graunt it to be emong the illiricans the illiricans on the other syde say it is not emong the melancthonistes or brentia~s whom they haue allredy throwen out from the communion of their churche
and haue not thus the very followers of luther by hellis he discord deuided allso their owne vnitee euen as their maister before did by most impious sacrilege diuide and separat him self fro the catholyke vnitee as from our lordes barne flower vvhere then shall wee seeke this church of theirs which neither of themselues wyll graunt to the other vvho is there so destitute of all reason that will not rather chose to remayne in that churche wherin he was borne and allso regenerat in christ

which was the greater benefyt then forsaking this to betake him self vnto that which to them selues is so vncertayne and vnknowen

but god forbid that a christia catholyke

and right beleuing man should haue any doubt whether that churche wherin not only him self but his parentes his graundfathers and great grau~dfathers haue been entred into the faith of christ be the true church of god or no
for what were this ells but to doubt whether he be a christia man or borne of christian parentes and as it is written by the prophet to stumble at none

daye as in the darke god hath placed his tabernacle in the sunne
he hath planted his churche as a citye vpon an hill which can not be hidden

but of that matter our purpose is not to taulke any more in this place for that it apperteyneth not properly to this treatyse and for that as well in our christian confession as in our writing which we haue late pubblisshed against the prolegomena of bre~tius we haue at large treated of that matter wher we haue taught you which be the markes

of the true churche to wytte that it be one holy catholyke and apostolyke churche wherof except one haue the chiefrule whose auctoritee all do acknowledge it can not be caulled the churche of god

now therfore we wyll not tary any lenger vpon this matter for that trust wee haue sufficiently shewed that the expresse word of god wherof those me brag so myche is not the word of god but the expresse word of the diuel
for the cleer and expresse word of god is charite
vvhich that it may please god by his holy spirite to power into our hartes and once to geue ende to thies schismes and heresies and to restore to his churche the desired tranquillite wee humbly beseeche his infinite mercy
vvhich no doubt he will do not for our merites wherunto most greuous punishementes are dewe but of his owne exceding great goodnes so that we amend our lyues and with confidence adressing our selues to the throne of his grace incessantly contine we in feruent prayer
the conclvsion

this myche had to write vnto your highnes most vertuous kyng of the

expresse word of god at what tyme was preparing to take my iourney to rome and by that occasio letted with myche and mani folde busynes
how be it the faithfull hart beare your grace enforced me to bestowe this trauayll in writing of this matter
the great benefytes allso which without my desert you haue heaped vpon me being so great as doubt whether any man haue receiued the lyke of any kyng of polonia hath driuen me theru~to
vvherfore howe myche the more pro}fesse and acknowledge my self bou~de vnto you so myche· the more carefull am of your safety and namely of the euerlasting saluation of your soule
for the defence wherof will not only not flee any payne and trauail but most willingly aduenture my lyfe
for it is possible ther want not some which do allso beate vpon your eares with thies wordes throw thy self downe for it is writte
but haue so great a confidence in your constancy and in the mercy of god that assisted therwith you will neuer imbrace their wycked counsells of separation or suffer their pestilent persuasions to haue any place with you

for myne owne part yf should see your

highnes which god of his mercy forbyd slipping downe from that high tower of the church would not fayle god geuing me stre~ghth yea though should presently dye therfore but with my body receyue you faulling downe and with the death therof redeme the safegard of your sowll

you knowe most worthy kyng how often haue imployed my trauaill in the defence of the sound and holly doctrine of the churche
you know how synce the tyme your highnes pleasure was to haue me called to the office of a bisshop haue not spared any charges

labours or perill to staye the declyning religion within this your kyngdom and dominions and to the vtter most of my power to susteyne and shore vp the same seeming redy to faull
vvho can be a better witnesse then your highnes what study labour and diligence haue imployed in auowing defending and proouing our auncie~t christia catholike and right religion but for that god is iustly angry with our synnes how litle good hath yet followed therof see to my great grief

this sathanisme doth daily increase more

and more
for when men haue once begonne to throwe them selues downe then are they caryed daily downe hedlong more and more into the bottomles dungio of errours
for as it was in their power to let them selues fall so when they be once going it is not then in their power to stay them selues
vvhat is now the state of your kyngdome your highnes seeth
vvhyle euery man allmost hath none

other thing to dispute of but of the expresse word of god
vvhyle eche man arrogateth vnto him self the knowledge therof and will haue his owne fancy adored as the expresse word of god yea and often is it seene that how myche the more vnlerned a ma is with so myche the more bouldnes he will take on him to taulke and dispute of that which he vnderstandeth not

but lord how myche feare lest while euery ma wil haue what so euer him self sayeth or deuiseth to be houlden for the expresse word of god we shall shortly recken emong vs so many polonian gods as allredy we see of germayne gods vvould god your highnes would be induced most vertuous prince to

harken to the prophets and apostles which styll crye vnto you auoyde idolls
for what

can they be ells but idolls which transferre diuine honour vnto them selues and will haue what so euer they saye or inuent to be houlden and reputed for the very word of god this so horrible an idolatry your highnes must driue and beate backe farre from al the borders of your kingdome and dominions neither must you permit any man to set him self vp as a god or to commaund any person to bowe downe and inclyne before his

word as before the word of god

vvhat is in deed the expresse and cleer word of god you haue now lerned of me and yet though nothing be more cleer and expresse yet is it vtterly extinguisshed when euery man shall take on him power and skil to dispute and reason of gods word
trust haue done that was my part to doo
for

though not learnedly inough yet haue plainlie and ope~ly shewed how great daunger it bringeth to the churche when euery man be he neuer so vnlearned is suffred to take vpon him the iudgeme~t of the expresse word of god
haue also oppened what is that

woord of god which is so cleere perspicuous and expresse that euen without scriptures it may be lernyd by the symplest and that it is not needfull for them that beleeue in chryst to dispute therof but that it behooueth the firmly to retayne the same in theyr hartes and not to suffer it to depart from thence

now your part right mighty kyng seemyth to be this that you forbidd to all your subiectes this reasoning and contencious arguing of the word of god and yf any be curious to knowe what is the expresse word of god that you co~maund the according to the

words of the scripture to learne the lawe at the mouth of the priest
and that you take especiall heed and regard that you suffer not your eares to be beate vpo with these sayings of heretiks if thou be the sonne of god throwe thy self downe for it is written
it is the

expresse word of god
these be the wordes of satha speaking by his lymmes and me~bers whom you ought to hate more then any venemous beast

that which the churche teacheth is the expresse word of god and that which is taught against the sence and consent of the

churche is the expresse word of the diuel
therfore you must stoppe your eares against the doctrines of syche men as vlisses did against the singyng of the meremaydes and whe so euer your hap shal be to heare any syche to geue some manifest shewe and toke how myche your highnes misleeketh it

so did your noble progenitors our kynges your blessed father grandfather and great grandfather all not only notable by the worthy

prayse of their other vertues but allso for their singular pyete and constancy in houlding and mainteyni~g the catholyck and ryght faith yea they so abhorred the socyetee and co~pany of heretikes that some of them as we reade in our chronicles did willingly

refuse kyngdomes being offred them of heretikes because they had a conscie~ce to make or meddle with them
these their vertuous steppes yf you wil followe which we trust and hope your highnes wil the state of thinges in your kyngdom are not yet so desperat or past recouery but that god fauori~g the tra~quillite of the churche may be agayne restored
vvhich happy daye that it may once shyne vpon vs we most humbly and earnestly beseeche almighty god

whereas for the well ordering of that ancient and royall commoditie of the tinne of this our realme of england diuers and sundrie good lawes and ordinances haue beene heretofore made established by the wisedome of former times amongst which there hath been euer speciall care and prouision that all the sayd tinne should be duely brought to our coynage beames and there tried and assayed and by our stampe or marke sealed and allowed before the same should bee put to sale within the land or offered to be shipped for forreigne vent and to that end also our noble progenitors haue been at charge to crect and maintaine certaine coynage houses in seuerall set townes within our counties of deuon and cornewall lying most commodious for the sayd coynage at which places at certaine set dayes of coynage and post coynage appointed our speciall officers of the stanneries doe and haue been wont duely to attend to receiue trie assay coyne seale and allow the sayd tinne by setting our marke seale or stampe vpon the same by which meanes both wee our selfe were secured of the preemption and coynage dueties of the sayd tinne being auncient and vndoubted prerogatiues annexed to our crowne with our duthie of cornwall and also the tinne had his iust and true assay according to the goodnesse and richnesse of it that neither our owne subiects nor others might be defrauded in the buying of the same nor yet the subiect hindered by any vnnecessary delay in the lawfull trading and merchandizing thereof
and whereas out of our princely care to cherish and maintaine the trade and working of such a worthy and staple commodity of so much honor and profit to this commonwealth wee haue not long since taken order to allow a greater price for the working and making thereof then euer was giuen before and haue also by the extraordinary care and industry of our right trustie and right welbeloued cosin and counsellour thomas earle of suffolke our high treasurer of england and of our trustie and right welbeloued counseller sir foulke greuill knight chauncellour of our exchequer lately setled

bet neuerthelesse we are informed that by the secret practise and combination of sundry ill minded and couetous owners and workemen of the sayd tinne workes a great part of the said tinne hath been heretofore and daily is bought sold receiued deliuered and caried away vncoyned aswell in shippes and other vessels which vnder colour of comming to buy cornish slate and stone vpon the coast of cornewall betweene foway and meuagase doe imbesell much vncoyned tinne in blockes as also by marriners and seafaring men who buy vp the tinne in barres commonly called pocket tinne of pewterers and others contrary to the auncient ordinances of our stanneries aforesayd to our preindice and wrong in our sayd prerogatiue the disgracing of our sayd commoditie and abuse of our subiects buying the same vntried and not assayed
in respect whereof as wee might most iustly take aduantage of sundry offenders notoriously faultie in this behalfe which in our naturall inclination to mercie and pardon wee are graciously contented to passe by so wee cannot in our princely care of the common wealth and our owne right but prouide for redresse and reformation of these great disorders for the time to come
and therefore doe by these presents straightly charge and commaund aswell all and singular our louing subiects as all other person and persons whatsoeuer that none of them presume vpon any colour shift or pretence whatsoeuer at any time or times hereafter to vtter sell deliuer or put to sale or to receiue ship carie land or contract for any blacke tinne vnblowen but to such as cause the same to be cast and blowen before it be sold for vse or any white tinne or cast tinne before it be first coyned and stamped with our seale or marke appointed for that purpose as aforesayd vpon paine of forfeiture aswell of the sayd tinne and other condigne punishment in case of land cariage as also of confiscation of the shippes hoyes barques lighters and other vessels wherein any such prohibited tinne shall be shipped or laden for transportation contrary to the intendment of this our proclamation and also vpon paine of our high displeasure and of such further penalties forfeitures and punishments in both cases as by the statutes and ordinances of our sayd stanneries or any other lawe or statute whatsoeuer or by the censure of our high court of starre chamber for disobeying this our royall commandement and iniunction or otherwise may bee inflicted vpon the offenders in this behalfe giuing all our louing subiects to know that any toleration or forbearance for the time past shall be so farre from iustifying or warranting the like abuses to be continued in time to come as contrariwise it shal aggrauate the fault thereof in respect of our former clemencie

and whereas wee are giuen to vnderstand that there are certaine wandring petie chapmen or tinkers and others haunting much about the tinne workes aforesaid who doe make it an vsuall trade to buy blacke tinne by the bowle and white tinne vncoyned by the pound weight or other small quantitie and so doe carie the same from the worke houses to

certaine priuate places of receipt till hauing gotten by this vnlawfull meanes some store together they vent or spend the said blacke tinne before it bee blowen and sell the said white tinne before it be coyned by sea or by land where they find best chapmen to the preindice of vs and our louing subiects as aforesaid our will and pleasure is and wee straitly charge and command all and singular our iustices of peace before whom any such tinker petic chapman or other person offending shall bee brought diligently to examine and finde out where and of whom he had the sayd prohibited tinne white or blacke found with him and where and to whom hee meant or intended to sell the same or hath heretofore sold any other of like sort and aswell the said tinkers and petie chapmen as all other persons who shall be found priuie to the buying or selling receiuing or deliuering of the sayd tinne blacke or white as aforesayd to commit to our gaole of the countie where they shal be taken and otherwise to punish according to the lawes customes and ordinances of our stannerics and as the quality and nature of the offence shall by the lawes and statutes of this realme deserue for contempt of our royall commandement and proclamation in this behalfe willing and requiring all and singular our shiriffes mayors bayliffes constables and other our officers and louing subiects to attach stay and arrest all such purloyners and secret cariers of tinne blacke or white and to bring them before the next iustice of peace for order to bee taken with them as aforesayd as they and euery of them will answere for the contrary hereof at their vttermost perils

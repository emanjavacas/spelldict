An Acte concerning Pewterers, made in the xxv. yeere of the reigne of our Soueraigne Lord, King Henry the eyght, in the minth Chapter.
IN theyr most lamentable wise showen, and pitteously complaine vnto the Kings most royall Maiestie, to this most high Courte of Parliament, the Kings most humble poore and obeysaunt subiects, the Maister, wardaines, poore fellowship of the craft mistery of Pewterers, as wel of the Citty of London, as of all other places within thys Realme of England, that where the said craft or
mistery, before this time hath been one of the best handicrafts within this Realme, which hath not onely growen and contiuued by meane of diuers good acts and statutes made for the true exercise of the same, whereof one was made in the xir. yeere of the Kings most renowmed Father, whose soule God pardon.
And one other was made in the fourth yeere of the Kings most victerious raign, concerning the crafts of Pewterers and Brasiers, of for the true making, mixting and selling of good and true pewter, and brasen vessels.
And also for exercising and vsing of true weights and beames, to be occupyed by the sellers of any such pewter or brasen vessels, within thys Realme, so that none of the Kings Subiects, nor any other person, should (by any sale of any false mixed brasen and pewter vessell, or any vntrue weights) bee deceiued, as by the sayde statutes more plainely dooth appeare.
Which good Statutes duely put in execution, hath caused the saide craft to encrease and multiplye, to the great profite and vtilitie of a great number of the Kings Subiects, and the commoditie of pewter vessell much to be had in reputation, in all straunge Regions and Countreys, vntill now of late, diuers euill disposed persons, beeing the Kings Subiects borne, which haue been apprentises and brought vp, in the exercise of the sayde crafte of Pewterers, haue nowe of late, for their singular lucre, repayred into straunge Regions and Countreys, and there doo exercise the saide craft of Pewterers, teaching straungers
(not onely the cunning of mixting and forging of all manner of Pewter vessell) but also doo teach all thinges belonging to the sayde craft of Pewterers.
By meanes whereof, there is not onely brought (daylie into this Realme) out of strange Regions to bee solde, great number of thinges made of Pewter, vntruely mixted, and made of Tinne, where with the Kings Subectes bee daihe deceiued, and the people of strange Countries greatly instructed, in the cunning of the said craft of Pewterers, in such wise that thereby not onely a great number and quantity of pewter vessel, and other things of pewter, made in diuers sorts and fashions, amounting to a great value, which was dayly and continually wont to bee carryed and conueied out of this Realme, by Merchants, into straunge Regions and Countries, and there to be sold and vended.
Whereby the commoditie of Tin made into Pewter vessell, which hath bin had in great estimation, as things very necessary and commodious, the kings customes thereby much aduaunced, is nowe lyke vtterly to cease and decay, and not to bee esteemed as heere to fore hath beene but also the sayde craft of Pewterers, which at this day setteth and keepeth in worke and occupation, a great number of people, shalbe be vtterly vndone.
And a great multitude of the Kings natural subiects, thereby fall into idlenes, to the great impouerishment of this Realme, if speedy remedy for the redresse of the premises bee not prouided.
it may please your highnesse, by the assent of the Lords spirituall and temporal, and the commons in this present Parlyament assembled, and by the authoritie of the same, to ordayne and enact, that no person or persons hereafter, at any time now inhabiting, or which hereafter shal inhabite within this Realm shall buy, or otherwise take by exchaung for other wares, any wares made, or hereafter to be made out of this Realme,
of Tin, or mixt with Tin, as Platters, Dishes, Sawcers, Pottes, Basyns, Ewers, Flagons, Goblets, Salte, Saltsellers, Spoones, or any other thing made of Tinne or Pewter as aforesaide, whatsoeuer it bee, vppon paine of forfeiture of the same ware, in whose hands soeuer it may be found or taken: and also, lawfull money currant in this Realme to the value thereof.
The one halfe of the same forfeiture to be to the vse of the Kings Highnesse, and the other halfe to the vse of the finders of the same.
And furthermore be it enacted, that it shall bee lawfull for the Maister wardaines of the sayde craft of Pewterers, as well within the Cittie of London, as within euery other Citty, Borough, and Town of this Realm where such wardaines bee.
And where no such wardaynes bee, to the head Officer or gouernour, head Officers or gouernours of the same Cittie, Borough, or towne, for the time beeing, to appoynt diuers persons most expert in knowledge of the same, to make search and seasure, and to take into theyr hands and possession all such wares as heereafter shall be brought contrary to the true intent and effect
of thys present Acte, in whose soeuer handes or possessions any such shall be found.
And also be it enacted by the authoritie abouesaide, that no person or persons, occupying the sayde craft or occupation of Pewterers, wythin this Realme, shall set on worke, or retayne in hys or theyr seruice, any person or persons, to be his or their Apprentice or beeing straunger borne out of this Realme, vppon payne to forfeit for euery such Apprentice and ten poundes sterling.
And that no straunger, borne out of this Realm, shall occupy, exercise, or vse from the feast of Penticost, next comming, the saide craft of Pewterers, nor worke any manner of vessell or other ware aforesaide to bee made of Tinne or Pewter, within any place or places of this Realme, vppon payne of forfeiture of tenne pounds sterling: and also, vppon payne of forfeiture of the same Pewter or Tinne so wrought, in whose hands soeuer it may be taken or found.
And also, bee it enacted by authoritie aforesaid, that no person nor persons, beeing borne within this Realme, occupying or excercising the sayde craft of Pewterers, shall at any time heere alter resort to any straunge Regions or Countreyes, there to vse, teach or exercise ye said craft of Pewterers, vpon paine to loose the priueledge and benefite of an Englishman.
And if in case any of the Kings Subiects at this present time, beeing dwelling in any straunge Countrey or Region, and there occupying the sayde craft of Pewteters, doo not repayre into thys Realme, within three moneths next after request and warning
to him be giuen, by writing sealed with the common seale of the Wardaynes of the sayde craft, within the sayde Cittie of London, and heere in this Realme continually from henceforth inhabit, that then from henceforth he shalbe taken reputed as no Englishman, but shall stand be from henceforth out of the Kings protection.
And forasmuch as sundry euil disposed persons which commonly bee called Hawkers, by authoritie of the Kings letters pattents or placarde, do not only goe about from place to place, within this Realme, vsing buying and selling of brasse and pewter.
And by coulour and pretence of the same Lycenses and Placardes, vse vnlawfull and deceyueable Weights and Beames, but also do vse to sell both pewter and brasse, which is not good, nor truely, nor lawfully mixt nor wrought, to the great deceit of the Kings true liege people, contrary to the fourme and effect of the sayd good Act and Statute made in the sayde fourth yeere of the Kings most noble raigne.
Be it therefore enacted by authority of this present Parliament, that all such lycences and placardes heeretofore had, made, or graunted to any such person or persons, contrarie to the true meaning, fourme, and effect of thys Statute shalbe from hencefoorth by authoritie of this present Parliament, cleerely voyde and of none effect.
And where as in the saide acte of Parliament, (concerning the craft of Pewterers Brasiers) made in the sayde fourth yeere, for diuers causes and considerations in the same contayned, among other things, it is expressed that no person, or persons, vsing the said craft
of Pewterers or Brasiers should fro~ henceforth fill or chaunge any Pewter or brasse, new or olde, at any place or places within this Realme, but onely in open Fayres and Markets, or in theyr stone dwelling houses, but if they were desired by the buyers of such wares, vpon paine of forfeiture for euery such default, ten pounds.
For as much as the same forfeiture is to the only vse of the Kings highnesse, that any partie searching or finding the same, is not intituled to haue any benefit therby, it hath not been knowen that any person, or persons, haue taken any paine to insearch or make any inquiry thereof.
By reason whereof, diuers and many euill disposed persons, vsing buying and selling both of brasse and pewter, and not regarding the saide good act, nor the said penalty, daily goe about from village to village, Towne towne, and from house to house, to sell such pewter and brasse, which is not good.
And also vse deceiueable Weyghts and Beames as they did before the making of the sayd acte, to the great hurt and deceite of the Kings true liege people and Subiects.
Wherefore be it enacted by the authoritie abouesayde, that as well the moytie of the sayd forfeiture of ten poundes, limited in the saide estatute made in the sayd fourth yeere, as also the moytie of all other forfeitures before expressed, and euery of them bee and shall bee to the vse of the Kings highnesse, his Heyres and Successors: and the other moytie of the same forfeitures, and euery of them, to the vse of him, or them, that shall seaze, finde, or present the sayd forfeitures, or any of them, or that shall sue for
the same in any competent Court or Courtes, within this Realme by action of debt, bill, plaint or information, wherein the defendant shall in no wise be admitted to wage his law, or any protection or essoyne to any person or persons, which shalbe impeached to haue offended contrary to the forme and effect of this Statute, shall be allowable.

And further it was enacted, that it should be lawfull to the Maister and Wardaines of the Pewterers, as wel within the Cittie of London, as within euery other Cittie, Borough, or Towne within this Realme where such Wardaines were, and where no such Wardaynes were, to the head Officer or gouernour, head Officers or gouernours of the same Cittie, Borough, or Towne for the time beeing,

And it was also enacted by the authoritie aboue sayde, that no person, or persons, occupying the sayde craft or occupation of Pewterers, within thys Realme, should set on worke, or retaine in his or theyr seruice, any person, or persons, to be his or their apprentice, or Iourneyman estraunger borne out of this Realme, vpon paine to forfeyt for euery such Apprentice and Iourneyman, ten poundes sterling: And that no straunger, borne out of this Realme, should occupy, exercise, or vse, from the feast of Penticost then next comming, the said craft of Pewterers, nor worke any manner of vessels, nor other ware aforesayd, to be made of Tin or Pewter, within any place or places of this Realme, vpon paine of forfeiture of ten poundes sterling: and also, vppon payne of forfeiture of the same pewter or Tin, so wrought, in whose handes soeuer it should be found or taken.
And it was further enacted by the sayde authoritie, that no person, or persons, beeing borne within this Realme, then occupying or exercising the sayd craft of Pewterers, should from thenceforth resort into any straunge Regions or Countreys, there to vse, teach, or exercise the saide craft of Pewterers, vpon paine to loose the Priueledge and benefite of an Englishman.
And if in case any of the Kings Subiects, at
that time being, dwelling in any straunge Countrey or Region, and there occupying the said craft of Pewterers, dyd not repayre into this Realme, within three moneths next after request warning to him to be giuen, by writing sealed wyth the common seale of the Wardaines of the sayde craft, within the said Cittie of London, and here in this Realme continually (from thencefoorth) dwel and inhabit, that then and from henceforth he should bee reputed and taken as no Englishman, but should stand and be from henceforth out of the Kings protection.

And so than the same forfeiture was to the onely vse of the Kings highnes, and the party searching or finding the same was not intituled to haue any benefite therby: it was not knowen that any person or persons had taken any paines to insearch or make any inquiry thereof.
By reason wherof diuers many euill disposed persons than vsing buying and selling as wel of brasse as pewter, and not regarding the said good acte, nor the saide penalty, went dayly about from Village to Village, Towne to Towne, and from house to house, to sell such pewter and brasse, which was not good, and also vsed deceiueable weights and Beames, as they did before the making of the sayd acte, to the great hurt and deceit of the kings true liege people and Subiectes.

bought, or brought into thys Realme contrary to the purport and effect of the sayde estatute, made in the sayde xxv. yeere of the raigne of our sayde Soueraigne Lorde, that then euery such person, and persons, so offending, in letting, disturbing, or withsta~ding the sayd seasure, or taking of such wares as is aforesaide, shall loose and forfeit for euery time so dooing, the summe of fyue poundes sterling, the one halfe wherof, shalbe to the Kings vse, and the other halfe to him or them that will or shall sue for the same, by action of debt, writ, byll, playnt, or information in any the Kings Courtes of recorde, in which action or suite, no Protection, Priuiledge, nor wager of law, shall be allowed nor admitted.

the great and wonderful prophecies of mr patridge mr coly mr tanner tis no wonder if so many strange events and accidents are hidden from the of since so few addict themselves to the understanding the caelestial intelligences in their sundry aspects motions conjunctions and configurations seeing by them as by the monitors of heaven are pointed out the rise and decay of empires kingdoms and states wars plague famine fire losses and the like which the more judicious frequently and which by a true and timely repentance may be averted and the almighty hand stay'd ever then when it is lifted up to give the fatal stroke as appears by the ninevites humiliation david's opposing himself to the destroying angel hezekia's prayer that delivered him from appointed death and many other examples found in holy writ and other warrantable records
but not to be tedious in the beginning now proceed to give the reader the sum of the predictions prophecies or prognostications for the year
as find them set down by these four most learned and judicious astrologers whose heitherto approved truths have struck the world with no small wonder and amazement

this year says mr patridge

begins with no extraordinary action but great councils and consultations which may be hoped to very good purpose for at the new moon two days after its ingress the moon applyes to the sextile of saturn to which may be added the conjunction of the fortunes the sextile of the sun saturn which in the starry dialects are arguments of a quiet and peaceable time and much better perhaps than expected for there are very emergencies good or bad that happen in the world but have some manifestation from the configuration of the heavens and they from the beginning of the year till towards the spring seem to denote nothing less than a stabilitie of worldly affairs were not the two infortanes stars so called possited in a malicious and treacherous sign however the benevolent positions of the favourable planets mittigate the evil pretended from whence we may clonclude and hope for better things than many ill spirited persons desire though to other countrys under their influence to mars and saturn in scorpio threatned rebellious mutinies war falshood perjury uiolation or breach of leagues between neighbouring princes dissensions controversies murthers with backbitings amongst relations some siding with one party or country and some with another having thus discoursed of the first part of the year he proceeds to the second

saturn says mr coly

being in scorpio and jupiter in aquarius it is an ill wind that blows no body profit things seem to be in a moderate good posture many cry out for justice and plead much loyalty some sticking of an old nature falls in the quadrate of saturn mars threatens a foot of subtile aged persons and usually produces many

strange effects and this following the suns ingress some mlevolent malady is to be feared and the aspects being for the part partamicable seem thereby to promise unity concord
agreement
and the position of jove in aquarius denotes a+vancement of worthy men of the long robe so that we have cau to hope well notwithstanding the endeavours of some wick
persons to hinder our tranquilitie and towards the close of
spring hope to hear good news even such as will prove grates to all honest minds
from the spring proceeding to summer says various actions and effects will be produced throughout e+rope and we may wait to see the operation of great things whic are promised in forreign parts and such perhaps that many yea before have not produced for jove falling retrogade into pisce in trine and great reception with uenus with many other favou+rable or friendly configurations from whence we may naturall expect as propitious influences for in any ingress of the sun the fortunes are found in their own dignities or reception the do they influence vertue and such actions as they naturally signi+fie shall be exceedingly augmented and altho eminent change happen yet to the benefit of mankind and justice impartiall executed upon the great and powerful as well as upon the meane sort all things inclining to peace and tranquilitie and so going on to antum or the last division of the year

this month says he meaning september we have a most hateful opposition of saturn mars attended also with the opposition of the fortunes jupiter uenus the square of saturn and uenus the square of mars and uenus from fir'd signs which are notable configurations usually produce wonderful effects for mankind is threatned with strange distempers of body as fevours occasioning megrim madness phranzies appoplexies lethargies with many other anonimous diseases and unnatural hard to be cured and often terminate in sudden death and now expect to hear of many roberies and inhumane actions amongst mankind as also treacherous enterprises very sudden and amazing accidents in many parts of europe for nature still acts to bring her works about marss gives the pox but saturn gives the gout seas plagu'd with pirates thieves infest the land ease proves diseases to each unruly hand nd thus much for the predictions of this learned man from whence proceed to give you an account of the predictions and astrogical judgments of others in general for the year
as taken om their own hands

in the beginning of the year says mr tanner saturn being in the ascending part of heaven and jupiter in the angle of the earth signifie insurrections opposing princes unermining government as also mutations and changes in the afirs of princes and states alterations in laws threatning epecially the ottoman empire and not looking very favourably upn italy and some of the german princes who will be detrimened in their affairs and others find some difficulty and heaviness in he management of their estates and government and the quartile spect of saturn and mars denote many bold daring and unusual roberies and if saturn shall be in scorpio having north latitude it hreatens abundance of rain of rivers and orruption of waters and if oriential it denotes wars and conentions between noble men and their kings and governours especially those countrys under aquarius scorpio and leo yet as us we find that saturn and jupiter are aptly towards their trine aspects which carry a signification of love and friendship along with them and in may they are partially so figurated and so continue in the following july intimating emcassies treaties for peace hopeful proposals which will be promoted by sundry people if not hindered by some malevolent aspect stirring up such as may give it a disturbance however in the following quarter he aspects are more favourable and give hopes of a great settlemen of affairs which god of his mercy grant especially to these ingdoms
to these we may add what he says in his prediction for the year
the configuration of heaven says he attending the solar +gress are of a pretty mild and calm nature and the heaven bodies are moderately disposed as to their mutual aspects yet forreign countrys they prove not so favourable but threatens th with mortal action especially the turks tartars polonians yet soon after calmness may probably insue and we may reason+bly expect to hear of a greater calm tho some other aspect threa+en to keep the world in action nor are the eclipse of this to held of little account in their effects and significations according the rules of astrology and since we have spoke sufficiently of oth prognostical effects produced by the plannets and heavenly bodys what is most noted of them is material to be laid down
of the eclipses and what is observable from them this year
according to mr andrews

the frst eclipse will be upon the of march being of th
moon between the hours of at night being a total centerial eclipse and is to be seen in england if the clouds or mist intercept it not
its beginning will be at minutes past a clock the beginning of total darkness will be at minutes past five th the middle or greatest observation about minutes past six
the be+ginning of the moons recovering light about minutes past the end about minutes towards and at the time of these lip+ses saturn is in the fourth degree of scorpio retrogade in the ascendant jupiter and mars are in the fourth house jupiter being in the degree of aquarius and mars in the
degree thereof the sun and caput draconis are in the house in the
degree of aries and mercury is in the house and in the
degree of the same sign retrograde but to come near in this matter it is the opinion of the learned that an eclipse so posited is of no benevolent nature but denotes sorrow labour imprisonment secret contrivences clandestive actions and negotiations wherefore it ma may be reasonably conjectured that those countrys subject to its

ects may happen to fall under some unexpected disorder hower we are of opinion that these being only secondary causes mpting and not compelling may by the power of god prevented for in his hands are the breath of life and actions of ankind on whom we ought to rely for our safety preservation
the second considerable eclipse is of the moon on the
day september about half an hour after of the clock in the morning hich will be a total and centural eclipse visible with us if the air serene and not with clouds the beginning will be aout minutes past midnight the beginning of total darkness out minutes past one of the clock the middle or greatest obrvation about minutes past two of the clock the beginning recovering light about minutes past three of the clock and end about minutes past four of the clock the total durati about hours and minutes and the digits eclipsed will be minutes and the most material configurations attending is eclipse are the opposition of jupiter and uenus and of saturn mars it happening in the eighth house called by astrologers omus morts and ends in the seventh which they call the angles war quarrels strife and contentious mars is lord of aries where the eclipse falls out is retrograde and in his detriment so hat the effects may seem to be of no pleasant importance as furhermore happening in the fiery triplicity and first decant of aries nd in this case according to the learned it denotes the motion of armys death and destruction of small cattle enmity between the uulgar and noble sort of people murthers thefts discords wars harp fevours apparitions in the air and mutations in those parts subject to the sign wherein it happens which we earnestly wish may be averted from us and that we may enjoy our religion lierty and property in peace and plenty
amen amen
finis

king charles his glory and rebels shame
figure collonel hevvson


to a pleasant new tune or the crost couple

charles the first was a noble king fa la la la la la
his fame thorow all the world did ring fa la
but in this he was to blame that after all his pomp and fame to lose himself at a scottish game fa la twas but a foolish thing

he was a prince of courage stout fa la
although his glass was soon run out fa la behind him he left a noble stock may give traitors a handsom knock for making a king submit to a block fa la good things may wind about then husons eye goes

the blood that he lost as suppose fa la caus'd fire to rise in olivers nose fa la
this ruling nose did bear such a sway it cast such a heat and shining ray that england scarce knew night from day fa la good lord preserve his house

this oliver was of huntington fa la born he was but a brewers son fa la
he soon forsook the dray and sling and counted a a petty thing unto the stately throne of a king fa la
it far surpast a tun

but oliver had a heart of gall fa la
to murther his prince at fa la
he swares whosoever is over the main whether a french king or of spain yet in england no king shall raign fa la lest nol himself should fall

duke humphrey was the first protector fa la henry the second the next projector fa la
then thirdly oliver he took place but lucifer soon removed his grace and set up yong dick the fool of his race fa la dick loved a cup of nector

no sooner was dickee got up to the throne fa la
but he considered twas none of his own fa la
and staring this way and that way about desirous to be resolved of a doubt in comes lambert and turns him out fa la
so lamberts courage was shown

fleetwood desirous of the place fa la sends forth lambert the scots to face fa la
but in the strength of his desire when he did intend poor jocky to fire his men forsook him and left him mire fa la ay and that was his disgrace

thus you perceive how some do rise fa la
and even surmount the aerie skies fa la
but when they are up they shall have a fall witness fleetwood blind hewson and all the ragged rout of a coblers stall fa la
would hewson had both his eyes

when dame fortune casteth a frown fa la
these upstart gallants fall headlong down fa la
could wish they would view their own state and repent before tis to late for fear lest a gibbet will be their last fate fa la
or whipping about the town

clear whitehall of lobster and goose fa la cast rumps and kidneys out of the house fa la fetch in charls from over the main make wars with dutch men peace with spain then we shall have money and trading again
fa la
and then we care not a lowse

citizens look to your hits say fa la
let no cobler preach nor pray fa la tom coblers gone the lord knows whether lambert and he hope are together now fetch in the king we shall have fair weather
fa la whip coblers run away

blind huson was not over kind fa la
to run and leave his men behind fa la
wish we could find him by the scent there's neither law nor rump parliament should save him from death to give us content
good people pitty the blind

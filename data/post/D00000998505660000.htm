where in the parliament holden at westminster in the thirteenth yeere of the queenes maiesties raigne amongst other things there was one acte and statute made intituled an acte against vsurie which acte was then made to continue for and during the space of fiue yeeres next after the end of the said parliament and from the end of the said fiue yeeres to the end of the first session of the parliament then next insuing as by the same acte more at large it doth appeare
and forasmuch as the said fiue yeres were ended and expired in the eighteenth yeere of her maiesties raigne during the tune of the second session of this present parliament begun at westminster in the fourteenth yeere of her maiesties raigne and by diuers prorogations yet continuing therefore some doubts and questions haue bin lately moued whether the said act statute should continue but vnto the end of the last session of this present parliament which in deed was the third session of the said parliament begun in the said
yere of her maiesties raigne and first holden after the ende of the sayde fiue yeeres or else vnto the end of the first session of the next parliament that hereafter shall fortune to be newly summoned
wherefore her highnesse considering that such doubts and questions being moued and spread abroad may breed some troubles and many inconueniences amongst her louing subiects hath therefore thought good to vse the aduise of her iudges and counsell learned therein
and finding plainely by their opinions that the said acte and statute was not determined or expired at the end of the said last session of parliament but doeth yet stand in full strength and force vntill the end of the first session of the next parliament which hereafter shall fortune to be newly summoned doeth now by the aduise of her maiesties priuie counsell for the auoiding of all troubles that by the occasion of such fryuolous questions might hereafter ensue notifie and declare by this her maiesties proclamation to all her louing subiects that the said acte and statute doeth and shall continue and remaine in ful force and effect vntill the end of the first session of the next parliament which hereafter shall fortune to bee newly summoned
and so willeth and straightly chargeth and commandeth all and euery her said subiects to accept it as a lawe yet standing in full force according to the good meaning thereof without any such doubts or questions thereupon hereafter to be had made or moued by any person or persons whatsoeuer in any of her highnesse courts of record or els where

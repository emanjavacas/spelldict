Thus endith the Table [Figure: [Figure: Christ with beast] Of the Sonne and the Mone.
[Figure: AFter the Philosofers sayng the So~ne is the Iye of the worlde the gladnes the Iocundyte of the day the beawtye of Heuyn the mesure of tymes ye vertewe and origynall of all thinges growynge the lorde of all planettys the ledar and perfectoure of all planettys sterrys.
The Moone also as sayth Ambrose in Eyameron is the beawtye of the nyght moder mynistre of all humours mesure of all tymes gyder of the See chaunger of the ayre folower of the sonne.
And forasmoch as she is most lyke vnto the sonne vpon a tyme she began to detracte and diffame the sonne the whiche he perceyuyng spake to the moone sayd? Why doyst thowe bak byte me blasfemyst me haue euer geuyn the lyght and goon afore the to thy profyte and
Go from me quod the Mone for loue the not.
For thy gret brightnes cawseth me to be set lytell store by in the worlde.
For thou were not sholde be in gret dignite The So~ne answered and sayd.
For as shyne in the day tyme bere than the rule So thou without impedime~t occupyest all the nyght at thyne owne plesure.
Let vs therfore mekely obey vnto our maker exalte nat thy selfe by pryde but suffer me paciently to do as am ordeyned and do thou thy dutye.
The mone considerynge no reason in great anger departed gaderyd togyder all the sterrys and began batell shot arowes ageynst the So~ne entendyd vtterly with dartis and arowes to smyte hym and destroy hym.
The So~ne beinge aboue and at a vauntage seynge all this cruelnes drewe out his sworde smote the Mone a sonder.
And threwe downe the Sterrys sayde As oftyn as thou arte rownde shall departe the.
For thys cawse as fables reporte the mone conceyueth nat townde ster+ris often tymes fall downe.
Lesse hurt is to the stryuer to be parted in twayne Then to be all lost and brought vnto vayne.
SO in lyke wyse moche peple being inflate blowe~ vp with pryde elacion wolde be lyke vnto ye so~n haue domynacion aboue all other by their wyllys wolde yt none were aboue the~ nor lyke vnto the~ as the glose fayth.
Pryde is a bre~nyng eleuacyon in ye mynde. dispysing them yt be vnder wold be equall with them that be aboue for why As Crisostom sayth desyre of ex+altacyo~ is great syn vtterly to be dispysed suffra~ce is worshipfull co~mendable.
the prowde peple be lyft vp on height because their fall sholde be the mor greuous For he that falleth but lowe may sone aryse as ye Poete sayth.
But he yt falleth from on hyghe may nat so esely be restored to helth Bra~ches of a tree growynge alowe be conyued from te~pesiys as wryteth Crisostom.
But they that be on hygh be oftyn tymes broken in gret ieo{per}dye. Wherfor quint{us} Curci{us} sayth that a serteyn {per}sone sayd vnto kynge Alexander that a tree beyng of great heyght may ye soner be blowe~ vp by the rote.
And though a Lyon be myghty prowde yet be small byrdes fedde with his flesshe.
Philosofer cam to the Tombe of Alexander sayde yesterday to this man suffysed nat all the worlde.
Now is he suffy+sed with the space of .vij. fote longe.
But there is great space betwene planet planet For as Moy+ses greatest of philoforhers reherseth sayth and also it is written in ye goldyn legende that euery compasse of euery planet hath in thiknes ye waye of .v .c yeres that is to mene as moche space as a man may iourney walke .c. yerys so that dayly his iour+ney extendid to xl. miles euery myle to in length ij. M. pace.
Vppon a tyme a great thycke clowde began to exalt her selfe sayd.
Myn excellencie is great for may by interposicio~ of my gretnes cawse that other pla+netis may not shewe the~self in ye world but at my wyll.
Seynge that am vnder other planetis may doo so moche if were exalted higher then myght do moch more.
And thus this clowde prowdly asce~did vpward tyll she am to saturne.
Saturne seyng thys clowde presumptuously aplyng to go aboue hym was sore greuid sayd vnto her what arte thow that couetyst with pryde to ascende there as neuyr man cam.
shall ascende aboue the quod the clowde and ouuerthrowe the.
That heryng Saturne fore mouyd ordeyned harneys wepyn stoppid fast the waye threwe down the clowd and destroyde hym for euyr sayde.
SO befell it to Nabugodonosor which desirid to be aboue all other kynges princes to be callyd kyng of all Kynges and Lorde of all lordis.
For pryde not consi+deryng that almyghty god hath domynacion aboue all erthly lordships as it is specifyed Danyel .iiij.
harte of Nabugodonosor was lyfte vp be pryde wherfor he was deposid from his dygnyte wherof it was sayd vnto hym.
The dwellyng of the shall be among wylde beastis god shall eiect the cast the owte fro ma~nys company thow shalt ete hay lyke an oxe and .vij. sea+sons shalbe chaunged ouer the.
It is wrytte~ in Hystory scolasticall that Nabugodonosor was not chanuged into a beast vnresonable by mutacion chanuge of the body but by mutacion alienacio~ of his wytte reson also the eloque~cie of his speche was taken from hym he semyd hym selfe that in his forlymmes of his bodye he was lyke to an oxe or a bull in his hynder partyes he thought hymself to be lyke a lyon.
Danyell also all the tyme of his alienacion prayde for hym so hartely that the .vij. seasone that is to saye .vij. yeres by his prayers were chaunged in to .vij. monethis.
In the which .vij. monethis the space of .xl. dayes.
Other .xl. dayes within the sayd .vij. mo+nethis he retournyd to his mynde prayde with great mepynge so largely that his iyen were turned in to rednes lyke vnto rawe flesshe.
Manyon went to haue a sight of hym a stir that .vij. monthis were fully complete fulfyld He was Reuokyd callyd agayn vnto his firste estate but he regnyd not inmediatly for there were ordeyned, vij. Iuges so he co~tynued in abstinence penaunce vnto the ende of .vij. yeres neuer etige bred nor flesshe nor drank wyne in all that longe season.
Of a Sterre callyd Transmontana and other sterrys Dialogo Tercio.
[Figure: Sterre which is called Tra~smo~tana standeth euer fixe in the nauyll of the Heuyn gothe neuer to declyne nor laboureth nat by compasse circuler as other sterrys doth.
It is as a marke or a path of the see to the whiche shypmen geue great attendance.
All other sterrys gadryd them togeder cam to this sterre sayd Thou sittest alway styll haste eas rest and we go a+bout labour without rest and be thy seruantes. aryse thou a whyle and let an other be souerayn occupy thy rome.
To whom this sterre Tra~smonteyn answered sayde ye knowe nat what ye wold haue for your desyre is nat lefull nor to you expedient For haue gret labor great fatigacyon to rule you.
And yf dyd nat wysely conserue you in your places mocyons ye sholde gretly erre for lacke of a gode gyder.
But the other sterris wolde nat be pleasyd but rather more wylfuller to haue theyr peti+cyon and sayde all at onys.
We pray the to suffer vs to chose an other gyder.
Trasmontayn than beholdynge their frowarde wylfulnes departed from them went complayned to hys lorde maker.
The sterrys that seynge made great exultacyon gladnes aplyed the~
to make election of a newe gyder. but therin they cowde nat agree but fell at varyance and began to fyght eche with other as shepe lackynge a shepherde they erryd fell out of good rule.
at last whan they concidered the felicyte that they were in somtyme by the policye gode gydinge of theyr soueraigne the great myserie yt was fallen to them for lacke of hym.
They fell in repentance came to theyr fyrst gyder prayde hym to take them to grace to rule them as he had done before confirmed hym in his worshyp sayd all with one voyce.
The gyder that gydeth with vertewe grace Sholde neuer be changed lest a worse haue his place
EVyn so it is conuenyent for vs to do when we haue a gode ruler the whiche rightfully ruleth gydeth vs we be bownde to loue hym to do hym honor worshyp nat lightly to chaunge hym but cherysshe hym after our power for the great labour that he hathe to gyde vs for our wele.
The degre of gouernance is cal+led great worshyp but it is a gret charge as Barnard sayth what is worshyp or power but a great bourden miserye.
Or what is sublimyte or dignyte of the worlde but a perylous doubtfull tempest.
Who may be in wor+shyp or prelacye without payn or tribulacyon.
Or who is in dignyte without vanyte as Valery telleth. lib .vii. of a Kynge that was of so great witte so gret counsell that whan ye Crowne was delyuered to hym he helde it longe betwene his handes or he set it vpon his hede and consideringe it well and sayd.
noble fortunable garlonde how full of besynes and peryllart thou Innumerable to be tolde.
There is no thynge more laboryous more harde nor more perylous than is to haue great domynacyon or seignyorye. and therfore Valerius dothe shewe vnto vs in Libro .vii.
of Corneli scipion that whan Spayn was fallen vnto hym he answered sayd he wolde nat go thyder shewed the cawse why For he cowld nat do equite right wysnes.
For he thought hym selfe nat co~nynge ne sufficyent to so great a worsship so great a peryll togeder.
VE&sperus is callyd the night sterre and Lucifer the day sterre which apperith in the mornyng.
These two sterrys gadryd togider all other sterrys went with one assent to the creator maker of all sterrys made vnto hym theyr sapplicacyon and sayde Gracious Lorde thow arte a good maker and we therfore thanke the for thow haste ordeynyd bestowyd vs in the best wise.
But for thys cawse we be trowblyd that owre beawte brightnes is not alwaye shewed.
the to take the lyghte fro make hym darke that owre bryghtnes in the tyme may appere be shewyd.
To whom the lorde maker answered sayd your peticion is not lawfull for the sonne is the garnyssher of the day The distrybutour of howrys the Ory+gynall of all thynges growynge and without hym no thyng maye encreace.
Therfore wyllnot condescende to your peticion for it is not exaudible nor worthy to be alowyd.
Wherfore the sterrys seyng they cowlde not haue their desire went ageyn togydre fourmed a newe peticio~ offeryd it to thier maker sayd.
blessid lorde maker of all creatures we beseche the at least to drye vp put a waye the clowdis out of the ayre the whiche lette our bryght lyght to be shewyd For ostyntymes for their lettyng.
we may not apree nor be knowyn as we be.
And therfore lowly we pray the that where as our first askyng was denyed vs of thy godenes grant vs this seconde peticion desyre.
The lorde maker consideryng their symples gaue theym this answer with a sad countenance and sayd.
Holde your peas desire not vnlefull thynges for wyll not graunt them for it is wryttyn in the boke of Caton Aske that is righfull that yt semyth honest.
ye clowds be necessary though ye thinke contrary For they with their rayn moyste~ therth If no rayne shulde fall the erth cowde not be frutefull with this answer he put the sterrys from their desyre and sayde thus in this wyse.
That peticion may Iustly be denyed Whiche at no tyme to Reason is applyed.
MAn by this example it apereth that he that wyl be herd in his prayers or in his supplicacion must aske the thinges that be rightfull honest and resonable to be graunted.
aske the thynges whiche god laudeth promyseth the~ is your askynge sure for yt peticyo~ is sone granted of god Therfore Isyder sayth trewe.
For god granteth them better more for theyr welth then they desyre.
Seneca telleth in ye ij. booke of benefits yt a persone on a tyme asked j. d. of Alexa~der he gaue hym an hole town.
And whan the peticyoner thanked alexander sayd he was nat worthy nor able to receyue so great a gyfte alexander answered sayd natto hym.
retayne in my mynde what beco~meth ye to aske but what becmoth me to gyue So almyghty god doth for oftentymes he granteth nat our askyng becawse he wyll auaunce our peticyon with a better more profitable rewarde.
Som tymes god hereth nat many folkes to their plesure. for he wyll gracyously here them to theyr more profyte and helthe.
[Figure: OVr Lordys bowe after the fyrst Flode apered in the Clowdes hauynge two colours that was waterye and fyrye. signifyenge the Iugement co~mynge. whiche bowe apered by the space of .xl yeres after the byldynge of the Arke As it is sayde Historie Scolasticall.
Cancer is one of the signes of Heuyn and this worde cancer is Eqniuocum hathe many signyficyons But notwihstandyng here it betokeneth the signe of Heuyn And so this signe Canrer went vnto the Raynbowe in a gret anger and sayde.
Thou art to bolde for all heuyn is lytel ynough for the in so moche that thou besyest the to lette me of my course other sterrys that sholde occu+py there.
Wherfore aduyse the to be remouyd lightly or ellys thou shalt be surely coryed of me my company The bowe answered sayd.
Brother thou spekest nat well for am nat about to let ye of thy way for shew my selfe but in the day tyme thou in the nyght ro~nest where plesith the.
Wherfore me thi~keth yf thou entend to fyght with me thou art euyll aduysed for this cawse For thou mayst gader great company of sterrys to hold with the.
And haue frendys ynow both clowdes and also great thonders for to fyghte agaynst the for all thy strength and so there may growe great myschefe.
But wyll cownsell the for the best that goo before a rightwys Iuge that he may termyn thy questyon by a diffinytyf sentence and let the fawte be punysshed there as it is wherto cancer agreed.
whan they bothe were before ye presence of the Iuge and had shewyd there vnto hym theyr mater The Iuge spake than sayd thus.
Thou wycked Cancer it is ageynst the lawe or reason all ye prehemynence yt thou askest desyrest of the bowe.
If thou haue thy wyll and walkynge in ye nyght tyme and the bow but only in the day tym how may it be cre+dyble that he letteth thy waye.
wyll and charge the that thou ne+uer apere in the day tyme.
And condemne the in all ex+pencys costys of the courte.
MAny one in lyke wyse ageynst Lawe and Reason somtyme wyll stryue and fall at alteracy on with out occasyon and be full of questyons. wherfore they be takyn for wra~gelers and euyll people and often tymes they be iuged to the worst.
The bad angell cruell is sent ageynst hym Truly thrugh questyo~s stryues many one be brought to nought. as Isider sayth as loue co~+corde is alway by loynge so stryfe debate is euermore destroynge.
There was somtym an honest ma~ that had thre so~nes whiche when he sholde dye he called them before hym sayd.
Fet me a gret many of wa~dys bownde togyder and so they dyd.
And whan they were brought he sayd to his children folde them breke them.
To whom the fader sayd ageyn plucke out one of them breke all the other.
And they myght well bowe them but they cowd nat breke them.
The thirde tyme the fader spake and sayde to them take one alone and asay to breke that whiche they sone destroyd and brake a sonder.
Chyldren thus shall yt fall vnto you If that ye do con+tynewe togyder in loue and concorde no man shall be able lightly to hurte nor distroye you.
But yf ye varye be deuyded by dyscorde Euery man shall preuayll esely ageynst you and distroy you put you vnder fote and therfore beware of malyce and discorde.
[Figure: OF dyuers Philosofers ye sayng is that the erth is ye myddell parte of ye worlde The conseruer of frutis.
The moder of all growynge thinges The of lyfe and the swalower of all thynges.
Vpon a tyme Heuyn sent downe to the Erth here many gret tempestys of rayn of thonder of lyghtenynge. wherby he greuyd ye erth
when she was angry and gretly displesed she called the ayre to her sayd brother ayre pray the me dyll nat betwene heuyn me For myne entent is vtterly fiyced to ouerthrowe hym for he hathe done gret wro~+ge and iniury vnto me that hope to be auenged vpon hym with suche wayes as can fynde.
Do not so suster but let thy wra the passe For though it be so that heuyn haue greued the now another tyme ye shall be frendys make mery togyder.
The erthe beynge blynde ouercom with anger wolde nat cese but ran caught harneys and began to fyght with heuyn.
That seynge ye ayre raysed vp great darknes brought forth gret clowdes cawsed so gret thyknes that the erthe cowde nat discerne where heuyn was.
And yt contynewed so longe tyll the wrathe wod+nes was clene gone.
Than after that the ayre sent out wyndes purged the contrey droue away the mystes darknessys made all clere and sayde.
Of Ire and malyce to do out the flame we be all bownde and nat norysshe the same.
EVery man ought so to do whan he seyth his fre~dis neyghbours wrothe togider.
For after the saynge of Caton Ire wrathe letteth the mynde that it may nat discerne truthe.
For a man that is angry is past his mynde therfore he is to be temperatly gyded refrayned by his frendys tyll he be remoued from that wodenes tyll wrathe in hym be endyd.
The beginynge of wysdom is to moderate Ire wrath for he that ouerco~meth wrathe doth ouercome his greatest ennemy as Valeri telleth whan Archita tarencius was greuyd with his serua~t he sayd vnto hym.
thou vnhappy creture now wolde corect the yf were nat at this tyme wrothe with the.
Ire and malyce is to be voyded out of the mynde.
For as it is sayde in the booke of prouerbis .xxvij.
Therfore a Iuge ought neuer to geue Sentence whyle he is angry.
Wherfore it is redde in Histories of Romayns that Theodosius the Emperour was oftyntymes prompt and dysposed to do cruell execucyon.
But there was a wyse man yt gaue hym cownsell that whan he felt hym selfe greuyd and angry or euer he gaue any sentence he sholde say and reherse softly within himself xxiij. letters of the .a.b.c. that his mynde myght be refresshed and so to muse what was best to be done.
and that he myght the more rypely se knowe what Iugement ought rightwisly to be gyuen with gode discrecyon and deliberacyon.
KNowe ye as the Philosofre sayth that Ayre is the Spiracle of all thynges liuynge without whome all thynge is sone choked and dy+eth that is liuynge.
The wynde also is ye dry+er of the erthe the mouer of watres trowbler of the Ayre.
And becawse he is trowbler of the ayre the ayre cawsed hym to be Cited before the highe Iuge and maker of al thinges sayd.
myghty lorde and maker of all thynge Loke vpon me beseche the haue mercy vpon me.
Thou hast ordeyned me sufficyently and indewyd me with great priuylege. wherfore gyue lawde and thanke vnto the.
For thou haste made me to be lyfe of all thynges But for thys cawse.
am gretly trowbled and vexed with the wynde For he euer maketh me colde and cawseth me to be vntem{per}ate Therfore saye to hym yf euer from hensforth he presume to blowe vpon me wyll choke hym put hym from his lyfe.
To whom the maker answered and sayd Ayre thou spekest nat well Though the wynde make the colde and bete the with his blast Neuerthelesse he yeldeth the purged and temperat If it so were that the wynde blewe nat on the thou sholdest be seke corrupte bothe tedyous and hatefull to euery man. wherfor thou oughtest to loue hym yt the in good estate and so the ayre was pleased and sayd.
Correctours that correct vs for our owne good we ought to loue to suffre with a glad mood.
SO euery Creature ought to loue them that corect them sheweth the~ theyr fawts ente~de toreduce them to goodnes and to ye way of truthe For truly the seke man that denyeth to drynke the bytter drinke that his leche gyueth hym wyll nat suffre hym selfe to be cu+red and so he shall neuer be delyuered from his sebenes.
hatyth his corectoure shal not be weldyrected Verelye a man louith not his leche whan he wil not suf+fre hym that rebukyth hym for his goode.
He sekyth a blame to hym self that rebukith the wycked man.
wyseman louyth to be rebukyd but a fole is wrothe if he be corecte.

For as softnes is laudable in maner and ire is reprouable so is it contrarye in a dogge.
For a softe dogge is not goode but rathir more to be cherisshed for his fiersnes in tyme nedefull.
And so discreate fiersnes is comendable in hym that hath cure and charge of sowlys &c.
And for it is soo precyous he conceyuyd a pryde and sublymacyon in hym self and sayde.

And a none the fire began to speke fayre and prayde the watyr to destroye hym notte vt+terlye.
The watyr was mercyfull to the fire and did not put hym owt clene. butte conueyde hym to the erth and sayde in this maner· Goddis pleasure he doth fulfyll That yeldith a goode turn for an yll.

And forth they went to gither the deuyll the monk tell they cam to the monastery wher the preste was and they entrid into the Chirche there and toke them to theyr prayers.
And atte the laste this monke rose vppe and lokyd abought coude not fynde hym that brought hym thedyr and sayde to hym self.
And aftyr whan he had taryed longe and the othir shrew came not the monke went owt sought hym and whan he cowde not fynde hym he inquyred for hym of the bredrin of that monasterye and sayde to them.
where is that olde abbotte that came withe me in to yower Chirche.
And they answerde to hym and sayde. we sawe non to but ye aloone.
Then knewe this monke well that it was hys aduersarye the deuyll that had deceyued hym and sayed Nowe consydyr well that ye deuyll with his sotylteys hath brought me fro my Cell but it forthinkith me not For Came for a goode entente to receyue the holy sacrament of Cristis flessh and bloode and then to goo agayne to my cell.
And whan masse was doone the fader and abbotte of that monasterye wold not suffre hym to departe but sayde to hym. we wyll not let yowe goo tell ye haue dynyd refresshyd yowr self. whan dyner was done and he was goynge to his cell.
The deuyll came agayne in lykenes of a yongman in secular clothyng and behylde this monke intentyflye fro the hede to the fote sayo with reiteracyo~ many tymes.
But how maye yt be For haue not bene sene many yeris.

To whome shuld leue my good but to myn own sonne that is so vertuows good and hath forsake the worlde and folowyd thesteppis of godde to hym leue all my goodis.
Nowe if ther be any good man that dredith God and wote wher he is lette hym tell me that he may come and departe my goodis to power people for the wele of my sowle and his bothe.
And manyon haue gone to seke the and cowde not fynde the and as my fortune was for an othir cawse came this waye and happyd to espye the.
Wherfore tary not be my councell but come and sell all thinge and perfourme the wyll of thy fadyr.
The monke answered sayde It is not expedient to me to tourne agayne to the world The deuyll answerde agayne and sayde.
If thowe com not all thy Fadirs gode shall be loste and thowe shalt be counteable for it in ye sighte of god.
But shewe the thy fadirs wyll and desire the to come and distrybute his goodis lyke a goode mynister to them that be indigent and nedy that it be notte consumyd nor my spent be vnthristes but that it maye be spent to the consolacyon and releef of suche as be ver+tuows and in pouerte.
Or what greate burdon shall it be to the to come and do for thy fadirs sowle withe his owne goodis as his syngler trust was in the and then torn agayne to thy Cell.
The deuyll preuaylyd be his false instigacion and so this monke we~t forth with hym tell they came togider to the cyte and ther he forsoke hym.
he wente towarde his fadirs hows wenynge to haue fownde hym dede. and his fadir was Comynge owte of the durre beynge alyue and knewe not his sonne butte askyd what he was and he was wonderfully troublyd and cowde gyue noone answere.
And his fadyr askyde of hym dyuers tymes and many what he was whens he came.
And at laste he sayde with Rubowre and greate confusyon.
And he was ashamyd to tell the Circunstaunce of the mater.
Butte at the laste thus he sayde to his fadir.
The loue of the hath cawsyd me to come hydir for desyred sore to fee the and ther he contynuyd and bode styll and aftyrin a shorte space he comittyd fornycacyon and othir greate enormyteys and synnes.
But notwithstondinge he amendid not his lyuynge nor toke no repentaunce but lyke an vnhappy creature.

It is rede in vitis patrum that one hermyte was ledde by an Aungell to a sertayne place where as was a greate congregacyon of holy monkys and he sawe the placis that lay abought them replete with innumerable multitude of fendes flying as it had bene flyes.
And whan the aungell the Heremyte came togider to a greate Cite where as was kepte a greate fayre this heremyte sawe but oon fende stondynge vppon the gatys and he was Idell and not half occupyed and the Heremyte askyd what it mente.
All that euyr were in the cite were aplyable to perfourme the fendes wyll and therfor one fende was sufficient there.
But in the abbaye it was co~+trary for they resistyd manly and therfore came many fendes togider agayne them to tempte them withe dyuers temptacions.

Cerastes is a serpent so callyd as wrytithe Isidore Ethimologiarum .xii. for that he berithe .viii. hornys in his hede lyke vnto the hornys of a Ram and the hornys of hym be oftyn tymes set vppon riche mennys tablys to eschewe venyme.
And also of his hornys be made knyuys hastis which were wonde to be layde before kynges and Emperowrys that be the swetynge of them it shuld be shewyd if any mete that were sette forth were infecte with poyson.

As greate fawte hath he that holdith as he that fleyth or yeldyth.
Therfore goo fro+me for thy disposicyon is nat goode and thus this precyows Gemme departyd fro the Serpent sayde.

And therfore if thay haue a lytel blaste of temptacion they be soone ouercome and brought to nought as lede in the fire.
Therfore and if thow intende to be precyows in the sight of Godde stody and aplye the to be meke lowlye in thyn own mynde.
Be thow lyke a chylde lowlye in thyn own sight that thou mayst be greate in the sight of Godde.
Forsomoche the more precyows shalt thow be in gods sight how moche thow arte humylyate in thyn own conscience.
And he that is vyle to his owne mynde is greate to Godde.
Consydre the more gloryous thow art in thyn own mynde.

In Rome somtyme was a ladye of so greate humilite and reuerence yt she thought her self vnworthye to come nyghe the awter and to beholde the blessyd bodye of ower lorde. when it was lyfte vppe.

but consydre wele that thy colowre is reede and myn is whyte.
Also remembre that thow arte of grete reputacyon and incomparable valowre.
Wherfor trow verely that lyke as we be deuydid and co~trary in pryce and in valowre so shall we be deuydid in owre wyllys.
It is bettyr therfore for vs not to begynne coniunccyon than aftyrwarde to make separacyon and to withdraw vs frome the thinge that is begon and also syluer sayd these wordis.

But whan they shulde deuyde it the lyon spake and sayde.
For am grettist of worshppe here and the first choyce shall yelde me the secounde parte and ye grettist labowre shall gyue me the thryd yarte.
And but if haue the forth parte shall breke the conuenaunte of concorde and with these wordys he began to gryne with his teth and smote the grownde with his tayle so soore that all they for fere rane awaye and lefte all the hoole harte to the lyon.
Wherby it apperithe that a man owith to be ware to assocyate hym self with his bettyrs for he shall euyr be put to the worse parte as it is sayde in a commune prouerbe.
For they wyl ha+ue the Rype and leue them the harde therfore saith Isope.
By this exemple it is shewyd that it is not good for the weke to be ioyned to the myghty for he wyl not at all tymes be faithfull vnto hym.

Here see and hold thy peas if thow intende to lyue in peace and therfore he had his lyfe and contynuyd longe in greate welth and prosperite.
Wherfore they deuysid a pot full of fayre Copyr and bryght and broughte it to the markette and solde it affermynge with sugryd wordys that this Copyr was Golde.
sertayne chapman came and bought yt. and ioyfully bare it home.
And whan he wolde haue prouyd the perfeccyon of the Golde he fownde it Copir.
Wherfore he was replete with indignacyon and cawsid Golde to be Cyted before a iuge for by cawse he had deceyued hym.
Notwithstondynge Golde made his trewe excuse and sayde to the iuge that he neuyr solde the potte nor deuisid it nor it was neuyr of his generacyon nor kynrede.
Wherfore in great haste the iuge cawsyd ye vendytowris all to be Cyted before hym and punyshed them with greate paynes and so be compulsyon they confessyd the trowth and shewid that they did it for enuye whiche they bare agayne Golde and ther intent was for to haue slaundrid hym that his Name shuld haue bene apay+rid and that he shuld not haue bene so precyows in the worlde.
Wherfore the iuge discretelye correctyd them lyke ther deseruynge and comendid.
He that is bothe goode and pure May euyr sleape sowndlye and sure.

And whan masse was fynysshed and endyd and all the monkys were congregate togider this vntrewe brodyr reportyd and sayd that his boke was stolyn.
Wherfore thre brodryn were assygnyd to serche in euery Cell and they fownde the boke in pafuncis bedde and thus he was falslye accusyd before all his bredryn and assignyd to doo greate penaunce for thefte which he neuyr comyttyd.
And wha~ he had continuyd in penance a sertayne season this false monke was vexyd with a fende and publyshed hys offence with lowde clamoure and shewid that he had wrought that soteyltye hydinge the boke and that he did it for enuye for to haue diffamyd the holy man and desired hartely that he myght be brought vnto hym to be delyuered fro the fende by his hooly prayers.
And whan he was brought before hym he was immediatly helyd and delyueryd from the fendis possessyon.
He that berithe false wytnesse is culpable to thre person+nys.
Secounde to the iuge whome he disseyuith by his lesinges.
Thryd to the innocent whiche he hurtythe by hys false wytnesse.
And therfore be the lawe a false wytnes+ser is bounde to make restitucyon of all suche goods as he hathe cawsid his neybowre to lese be his false recorde.

BEware therfore to stryue or varye with him that thow lyuyste with famylyerly.
For Seneca sayth Nothinge is more fowle then to be at stryf and varyaun+ce withe hym that thowe louyd and bene conuersaunte with.
Neuerthelesse they that desire to lyue peseablye with ther neybowris shuld helpe to supporte them and bere parte of ther charges as the Apostle wrytythe ad Galat .vi. Euery one of yowe bere the burdon of othir.
Ther is nothinge but it maye be suffirde of hym that perfightlye louith his neybowre as it is rede in the Hystory scolasticall.

My Lorde wyl not shewe yowe fayre wordys for myn excuse.
but these greate woundis whiche haue suffyrde for youre loue let them speke for me and expresse also the greate loue and verey trewe harte that haue euir owghte to yowe.
And immediatlye the Emperowre re+ceyuyd hym to grace and shewyd hym greate fauowre euyraftyr.
Also hit is rede in the firste boke of Iapis of Philosophirs of Iulye Cesar howe ther was an olde man lyklye to haue perished in a stryf vppon a daye whan he came before the iugis he prayde the emperour to come and helpe hym.
Emperowr Remembre fawght my self for the in the batell of Asye and made no proctoure and disclosyd his woundis whiche he had there and shewyd them to the Emperowre.
Wherfore he went hym self personallye and sped his besynes and was sore ashamyd in hym self to be Reputyd not oonly prowde but also vn curteys and vnlouynge.

Thus owist thou to do thou crysten man or woman to fynde the wayes to saue thy sowle.
But the medicyne is to be takyn aftyr the gretnesse of the sore and aftyr the profoundite and depnes of the wounde the remedye is to be sowghte as it is rede that dyuers Theuys beynge in greate iubardye and tempest in the see made a vowe if they myght escape they wold be confessyd.
And aftir ther escape they made confessyon to an heremyte.
Of whome to the mastir these whan he was confessyd the heremyte inioyned for hys greate offencis and enormyteys that he shuld goo to ye Pope to be assoylyd. wherfore he kyllyd the Heremyte forth he went to the seconde Confessor and also hym he kyllyd.
And whan he had shewyd hym hys Confessyon he intretyd hym curteyslye and thus whan he perceyuyd

And by that he conceuyd a remembraunce wherto he shulde come and howe sone he knew not.
And thus the deed of deth was so fyxed in his mynde that he ordeyned his state bettyr and amendid his lyfe and went in to wyldernesse and toke vppon him greate penaunce and endid in vertewe Wherfore it is wrytten in the glose.

And if he answer and saye it is iuyl with me ther is no trust of amendment.
Wherfor a wolf which was a leche gre+tely namyd had a syke person in cure and daylye gaue hym good hope of amendment.
The foxe knowing the vertewe of Varuayne and intending to begyle the wolf he went to vysite the pacyent and bare with him a bra~+che of varuayne and inquirid how it stode with him.

Whethir he shulde ly+ue or dye, To whome the wolf answerde and sayde yt he shulde soone be curyd and helyd of his disease.
For he is in amendinge quod the wolf as consydre by mo+cyon of his pulse and also by his vryne.
Leche thow arte begylyd and knowyst not the crafte of medecyne for he may not escape by any meane for the sentence of deth is geuyn to hym.

And so they multyplyed so many wordis that at the laste her husbonde all to coryed her.
But she wold not be styll but sayd it was clyppid with sherys.
Werfore in a greate angir he cut owte her tonge.

And thus he continued and neuer departyd of hismetc to eny that askyd parte but lyke an insaciable gloton kepte all to hym self.

All serpentis seynge hym be ferefull and slee fro hym for with his smellynge he sleyth them.
With his breth also and with his loke he destroyeth al thinge that berithe lyfe.
For the syght of him harmeles no byrde can escape.
And thoughe she be farre frome hym she is deuowrid and brent with his mowth.

Go thow fro me for thowe arte not of my kynde.
Nor thow arte noon of them that shal be sauyd.
Resyste ye the Deuyll and he shall fle fro yowe and the Apostill sayth.
Be ye stronge in batell and fight ye with the olde serpent.
Therfore we must fight agayne hym and we shall haue victorye.
For he is but feble agayne them that wyl with stonde hym as Isidore saith The Deuyll is dredefull in the sight of them that be worldely and flesshly dyssposyd.
But in the sight of the~ that be electe and godlye the drede of hym is vyle and not set bye.
That somtyme ther was a brodir of Relygion that retournyd vnto the worlde agayne and ther he spottyd hym selfe withe lecherye and withe othir vyces and became seruaunte to allmaner of synnes and soo contynewyd longe. but by Grace he repentyd hym and was verye penytent and soorye and lyuyd strayghtlye in a Sepulchre or Charnell hows And ther he chastised him self yn dyuers maners with great

Thow hast ouercome vs monke thow hast ouercome vs and so they fled all awaye. and the goodman remembringe the malyce and wyckednesse of them purposyd verylye in his mynde rathir to dye than to obaye vnto the fendes. and so was he chaungyd fro synne and made lyke vnto an aungell in vertewe to goode Example of many folkes &c.

Therfore bettyr hit is that those that prayse them self goo togider to the see iuge that is the Dolphyn which is a iuste iuge and a rightfull and dredinge God for he shall rightfully detertermyn this mater.
This counsell plesyd them well and forth went these twayn togider vnto the Dolphyn and shewyd to him all ther myndes and to ther power comendid the~+self.

He tournyd him self and disposyd him to batell and caught the Frogge with his cleys and bo+te her and plukkyd her to smale pecys and sayde.
EVery creature owith as ferforth as euyr he can or maye to the vttermost of his power to fle fro batell and stryfe.

And thus saynge the fissh shewyd the~ his tayle yt was cut. wherfor the fisshes abhorryd ye fyssher and fled from him in al possible haste.
The fissher vsid no more fysshinge. wherfore he leuyd in great pouerte.
Of fortune it happid so that a longe while aftir the fissher cawght agayne the same fissh emonge othir.
And whan he knew him he kyllyd him cruelly and sayde.

TRulye many be soo vnkynde that they euermore yelde euyll for good.
He yt yeldith badnesse for godenesse malyce cursidnesse shal neuer departe from the hows of hi~. for that is a greate vnkyndnesse and an vnworthy rewar+de of goode dedys. wherof spekyth Barnarde saith.
Vnkyndnesse is enymye to ye sowle destruccyon of good dedys.
Ingratitude is enymy of ye soule a brinnyg wind drying ye wel of al pyete ye dew of al mercy ye floodes of all grace Agayne vnkynde men maye be reportyd the example of the pouer Townysshman that dayly went

And aftirwarde the dragon wolde haue ete the asse saynge all the grettest seruices be oftyn tymes loste But this villane had counsell of ye foxe which brought the dragon agayne there he was first and sauyd bothe the man and the asse.
Also ther is a nothir example of Gerarde tenersi whiche was in maner of a foole and had nothinge in substaunce of goodes. but he had a sonne and whan he sawe moche people goynge to the Emperowre berynge hym greate gyftes he sayde withe yn him self shall alsoo goo to the Emperowre and present hym with giftes suche as shall please him And ye first that he fownde was a beaste callyd Centaurus.
The which beaste in the nether parties is an horse and in the ouerpartyes it is lyke a man and he is swyfte in rynnynge as an horse.
And than he toke a bere and vppon him and gaue them both to the Emperowre as of the parte and sonde of his lorde and fader.
To whom the Emperour sent great giftes agayne and made him passingly riche.
And aftyr this immediatly this yongman the sonne of this Gerarde faynyd him self to be dede and sent worde to his Fader to proue what moone he wolde make for him and he prouyd that his Fader toke no care for hym and therfore he set the lesse pryce by his Fader and thought him very vnkynde. wherfore sayth Gregory.

Thou arte Queene of all byrdes and Emperesse and if thow wylt take hede to my counsell thowe shalt be princesse and lady of all beastis.
The Egle consentyd and promysyd to kepe se+crete this matere.
The swalowe retournyd agayne to the Foxe and made suche ordinaunce with her withe othir that the Egle shulde fighte withe the Lyon and nomo but oonly they twayne.
And which of them that myght optayne and be victoriows shuld be prince and Ruler both of byrdes and beastis. and whan they were stryuynge in ther batell the Egle spake and sayde.
Noblesse Leonyne yf thow take hede we be disceyuyd be false consellowrs.
For they hope to be delyueryd of our dominacyon and lordshippe and for that cawse they mene and stere vs to batell.
But certeynly hit is bettyr that eche of vs haue dominacyon and rule ouyr his own kynde then that we shulde shamefully sle euerych othr be ther frawdes and sotylteys.
The Lyon beleuyd the saynges of the Egle for he vnderstoode veryly that it was trew and so were they acordyd togider as frendis for cuyr and sayde.
PRinces therfore owe to be ware of suche yt they be not lyghtlye mouyd in them self for wordys nor talys though they be subtellye tolde for ther is ma+ny a false deceyuer.
Be thow mouid at the dede doynge and not at the herynge of the woor+de.
Euerye creature owith to kepe hym self wisely and to beware before that he be not disceyuyd of false counsellowres

There be many flaterers lyke vnto Marmaydes which disceyue many by ther swete voyces.
Of whom it behouith especyallye to be ware and to vnderstonde ther deceytefulnesse.
Wherfore a philosofre callyd Sensippus kynsman of Plato sayde vnto one that flaterde him.
THe Egle cyted allmaner of byrdes and wilde fowles to chapitle.
Sodeynlye ther came honters and byrdetakers and stretchid owte ther nettis and ordeynyd ther snarys to kache of the byrdes.
The Egle beholdinge this and knowinge the great perell by her cryers cawsid opynlye to be cried that all wild fowles and byrdes shuld folowe the banere of the Egle and that they shulde way+te vppon her and flye togider yf they desyred to escape and be owte of daunger.
And so they that were obedye~t and flewe forth with the Egle escapid and were owte of parell.
But there were some that were glotonows inobedyent and they lokyd on the mete and couetyd to haue therof.
And soo they flewe into the nettys where they were faste masshyd and snaryd and then they cryed wretchidlye and sayde.
For inobedyence cawsith deth and curse in this present lyfe and perpetuall payne in tyme comynge. wherfore it was sayde vnto Adam.
Gen iii. Forasmoche as thowe hast eten of the tre of the whiche commaundid the not to ete. Cursyd be the erthe in thy worke and it shall Germyn and bere vnto ye thornys and brerys.
It was also sayde vnto kynge Sawle as it is wrytten primo .xv.
For becawse that thow hast castawaye the woorde of God and not bene obedyent to his comaundment.
He hath cast the away yt thou shalt no lenger be a kynge.
The vyce of inobedience is veray greate for Aungell lofte heuyne.
And Valery saith in his secounde boke puttynge an ex+ample howe fadirs before tyme punysshed ther childre~ for not kepinge knyghtly discipline.
Aurelius cawsed his sonne to be punyshed amonge fotemen for he kepte not his commaundement which correccyon in tho dayes was of the grettest humyliacion that cowde be.
It is also redde in cronicis Romanorum that whan Iulius Cesar had passid the space of .v. yeris in subduynge of enymyes though he had oftyntymes bene victoriows.
Neuerthelesse the dewe honowre which he was wonde to haue was denyed hym at his cominge home and he was not suffirde to entyr thecyte forsomoche as he had Taryed so longe aftyr the space of .iii. yeris which was prefixte vnto hym.
Of a byrde Callyd Herodius and of the kyte Dialogo. li.
HErodius is a dyrde of all byrdes flying most cruell and most rapaunte and gretter than any byrde the which subduyth and ouercomyth the Egle as sayth the glose vpon this verse of the psalter.
But the kyte began to whistle aftyr him and sayde.
Abyde a while thow wycked caytif for shall make ye ballyd for thowe desyrist dominacy on ouyt all byrdes But shall my self auenge all byrdes vpon the.
This Royall byrde this Herodius fleynge in the ayre toke no cure of the lewde woordis of the kyte.
But he cowde not be styll but began to reherse the woordes agayne.
Wherfore this Herodius was greuyd and wold no len+ger suffer hym but swyftely descendid downe vppon ye kyte and with his cleys pluckyd owte his guttis and kyllyd him and sayde.
He that wyll fight and stryue with the stronge Perisshith many tymes sekyth his deth amo~ge
THerfore we maye well co~sidre that it is no smal parell to be vnrasonablye worde full agayn the~ that be myghty or to vexe them to moche as it is wrytten Ecclesia .viii.
Stryue thow not with a myghty man leste that thow fall in to the hondes of him Wherof Isope tellyth a fable that vpon a tyme a wolf drank of a ryuer and a Lambe also drank of the same ry+uer lower and in an othir place.
And the wolf lyfte vp his voyce and spake to the Lambe and sayde.
Wotyst not thow what did to thi fadyr not yitte .viwekys paste.
Sayste thow soo thow vyllane and strayght fel vppon him and deuowrid him.
So do the myghty men of the worlde to them that be vndir for withoute occasion they deuowre them and destroye them.
Ther lakkyth neuer occasion to a lorde or to a man of greate power.

Nor alsoo for pryde she wolde not descende but excedynge her power she la+bowrid vppe warde.
Wherfore she was gretely greuyd and not hable to gide her self nor to flye to the Sonne and therfore she fell without remedy and sayde.

And therfore whan he shulde fight with Sapore kyng of Perce he was ouercome and takyn with all his hoste and God delyueryd him in to the hondes of Sapore for his greate pryde and he was seruaunte vnder him as longe as he leuyd.

And whan the kynge harde this saynge of the philosofre he was greatly compuncte and humiliate in him self. for they that araye them self with Golde and othir ornamentis be sone rewyd of ther beawte if they lacke ther garnamentis as Isope shewith in his fablis.

The asse he sent to myl that he shul+de bere corn and do othir greate workys the lytel whel+pe playde at home with his mastir.
And somtyme hys mastir fedde him of his owne dissh.
The asse seynge yt he labowrid so sore and was wery daylye and that the whelpe was fostirde with good mete and with greate cherissinge he sayde to him self.
This whelpe doth no+thinge but tredith vppon my mastir with his fete and lyckyth hi~ with his tong he is gretly belouid.
Wher for wil assay if can do so as he doth. so this asse came in sodeynly before his mastir and lyft vppe bothe
his forfete and sette them vppon his mastirs shulders and sange in his vncowth and straunge manere.
The Lorde was greatly aferde of him and cried owt and his seruauntis came anone with clubbys and stauys and all to bete the sely asse.
It had be bettyr for me to haue lefte my sporte to haue bene styll than to do as did.
Wherfore we be tawght by this example that a man owith neuyr to attempte to do that thinge which he cannot perfourme of veray kynde as an autowre saith.
Noman assaye to do that kyndely maye not be doon for a foole displeasith when he thinkyth to please.
Of a byrde callyd an Astur whiche sent for an othir byrde callyd Caridrius.
[Figure: IN the ayre the Crane was pursewyd of a byrde that is callyd Astur and at the laste Astur ouyrthrewe him.
But neuerthelesse this Crane with his lon+ge byll smote this astur and gaue hym a dedly wounde. astur this birde felynge hym self sore woundid sent forth messengers and gre+te gyftes vnto a byrde callyd Caridrius seyng.
thou leche and helper both of sowles and bodyes come to me and hele my woundes and shall rewarde the to thy pleasure.
This Caridrius as saith Papie is a byrde al whyte of the which bowellys make fore eyne to be hole and the propirte of this byrde is that if a man shall leue he wyll drawe nere to him· and if he shall dye he wil flye from him.
Wherfore he knewe well that this astur shuld dye breuely and for that cawse he wolde not goo to hym but sayde in this wise.
Of them that shall perissh wil take no cure But of such as shal helth haue ye is most sure
Manyon suche is nowe a dayes if they were well sowght.
For they be frendis in tyme of prosperite and gladnesse and then they vysite ther frendis.
But in tyme of trouble and thay wyl not see them.
It is full harde to proue fren+des in prosperite. and it is veray esy to proue them in ad+uersite. and also it is written Eccles .xxxvi.
Frendis ther be but fewe that be frendlye to ye laste ende.
Ther was somtyme a man that askyd of his sonne yf he had any feythfull frende to truste to· and he answerde and sayd that he had .iii. especy all frendes.
Then sayde his fader a broder and a frende is prouyd in tribulacyon.
hogge and smote of his hede and his fete and put hym in a sacke and sent it to euery of them thre and sayde.
de+sire yowe to bery hym secretly that be not take with the fawte.
And for this cawse his fader counsellyd him to assaye his frendes.
And also he tolde him a nothir example of two louers that were felowys.
Of which the oon gran+ted the othir a wyfe which he had feruently louyd.
And immediatlye he that had grauntyd this graunte went ouyr the see to vysite his frendes.
And whan he was retournyd agayne he durst not for shame shewe hym self nor to his felowe but fell in desperacyon.
And as it fortunyd that same tyme ther was a man slayne.
And wha~ his bodye was fownde ther was great inquysicion ma+de for him that slewe the man.
And soo this man that was desperate confessyd that he had slayne the man which he neuer did.
But for becawse that he wold fay+ne haue dyed for thought and confusyon And whan his felowe knewe hym be a sertayne tokyn.
He sayd that he had kyllyd the man to delyuer his feloowe fro deth laste he that was the veray homycyde seynge all this disclosyd hym self and shewid that he verylye did the dede and that the other twayn were nothinge gyltye.
Of gre+te loue and kyndenesse that was betwene two frendys.
And of them oone was callyd Damon and the othir was namyd Phitia.
And whan the Tyraunte Dyoni se wolde haue destroyde oon of them.
He askyd lycence that he myght goo home to his owne hows and dispo+se his goodes and the othir vndertoke vppon iubardye of lyfe that he shulde come agayne at a daye assygned.
And whan the daye drewe nere and he was not herde of.
Euery man blamyd the other and sayd that he was to hastye for to be his suretye but he sayde playnly he dowbtyd not the constaunce and stablenesse of his fren+de.
And so in the same howre that was assygnyd hym he came and faylyd not.
Wherof the Tyraunt meruay+lyd greatlye and of the sure myndes of them and of yt faythfull frendeshippe and forgaue his malyce and re+myttyd the payne and prayde them to receyue hym in to the thrid degre of loue and good frendshippe.
If oon man wyll doo somoche for an othir that is but mortall What owith he to do for God yt is immortall whiche suffirde hym self to dye for the loue of man.
As hit is wryttyn Ecclesiasti .xix. Forgete thou not the grace of thy surytye and helper for he gaue his lyfe for loue of the &cetera.
[Figure: AN hawke callyd Osmerillus and a Goshawke were confederate togider to goo an hawkinge.
And what game that euer they toke it shulde be deuydid betwene them.
It fortunyd vppon a tyme that they twayn togider toke a Quayle beynge from her neste.
Quayle is a byrde that hath her name of Qualis, or ellys of the noyse that she makyth.
For she cryeth quaquera quaquera whan these tway haukes had this quayle they sayde to her.
Chese the whethir the is leuer that we shall ete the allone.
Qrellys yf thow wylte lede vs to thineste that we shall ete the and thy children togider.
To whom the Quayle sayde Angwyssh and trowble is to me on euery syde what is best wote not.
But lesse hurte me thinkith for me to dye and to fall in to yowre hondes my self alone the~ for to be kyllyd my self and all my children with me.
And so they caught her but or euyr they kylled her she spake and sayde.
Lesse hurte it is to hym ye may none otherwise chese.
Hym self alone to suffre then many moo to lese IN lykewise by example of the Quayle we owe to doo whan we may not escape from perell.
Euer lette vs chese that the whiche shall leste hurte aftir counsell of the wiseman yt sayth.
We be bownde to chese rather for to dye for a comune profite then for to lyue for a syngler auayle as saynte Augustin wryteth+de Ciuitate Dei libro primo.
whan regulus was take and imprysonyd of them of cartage and ye Romaynys had manye of them of cartage in pryson which were yongmen and lustye.
The forsayde regulus was sent home to Rome for an exchaunge.
But or euyr he departyd fro the Cartagenensis he was sworn that if the Romaynes wolde not delyuer the prysoners of cartage he shulde come agay+ne.
And whan he came to Rome he counseylyd the Romaynes not to be greable to theyr petycyon forasmoch as he was an olde man and be lykelyhode shulde lyue but a whyle.
And ther prysoners were yongmen and lykely to doo greate myscheef to the Romaynes in tyme comynge.
And they prayde hym to go no more to car+tage but to abyde styll with them at Rome.
But in no wyse he wolde not be greable but forth he went to cartage.
And whan he came thedir he was cruelly put to deth It had bene profitable to hym to haue bydde styll at Rome but for his oth it had not bene honeste.
And for the profyt of the Romaynes it had not bene vayleable nor profitable.
Of a byrde callyd Carflanchus that wold go to Relygyon.
CArflanchus is a byrde lyke to a fawlcon stronge and myghtye.
This byrde in his yowth was disposyd to go to Re+lygyon and to lyue in perfeccyon.
But for drede of sharpenesse of the Rule he differde it and sayde.
And for this cawse that he wolde begyn no goode dede
[Figure: For drede of penaunce he came neuir to the myddes but rather endid his lyfe full lewdely saynge in this wyse.
He that for drede no vertewe wyll vse Shall perysshe dowghtlesse grace him refuse.
SO many one coueyte and desyre to flye to the grace of God.

VPupa is a byrde as saith Isidore .xii. Ethimol. in englyssh it is callyd a laywynge.
Grekys call her Vpupa for cause yt she oftyn beholdith considerith ye fylthye donge of man.
She hath thre Crestis of feddirs stondinge on her heede and she bydeth moch in pittis and ther as is donge and fylth.
With the bloode of the which byrde if a man anoynte hym self whan he goyth to sleape he shal se fendes abowt to destroye him The byrde for cawse that she is fayre and plesauntely Crestyd and fedryd with dyuerse colowres she began to lyft vp her self beholdynge the Popyniaye dwellyng with the kynge in a Cage of golde the which was fedde clenlye of the kynges mete and thus she sayde.
This popyniaye dwellyth worshipfullye and he labowrith not nor swetith and he is seruyd to his pleasure.
Wherfor purpose to go to the kynge and to profre hym my seruyse and to synge in a cage as doth the popyniaye and to fare well yf maye and to make mery with the kynge.
and whan she had bene there a whyle she toke great thought and was ve+ry sory that she was in captiuite and daunger that som+tyme was fre and at lybertye. and therfore for thowght and heuynesse she leuyd but a whyle. and sayde or she departyd fro the worlde.
They synge and lyue withowte greate labowr but whan they wyll proue it and be includid in a mona+stery and be vndir Rule and vndyr the power of ther souerayne they repente that they haue loste ther lyber+tye as a Philosofre sayth.

And with a Comfortable there he exhortyd his men to fighte and sayde My trewe seruauntis and sowdyowrs dyne and make yow stronge as thoughe ye shal neuer ete more.
And they did soo and were nothinge aferde of his saynge.
And whan ther was no hope to escape he hartyd them soo that they were gladde to suffre deth rather then to lese ther lybertye and to be seruauntis vnto the percys.
That Demetrius kynge of Ponte and Armenye when his owne sone besegid hym and wolde not cese he was sorye therfore and came down to the lower par+tys of his hows and gaue venyme to drinke to all hys wifis his dowghters and his concubynes and he him self dranke of the same for thought and desperacyon for all that whan he sawe that he cowde not dye lyght+lye.
He offrid him self to be slayne to oon of his enymys that entirde be a wall.
Rather then he wolde be subdued to his enymyes and lese his lyberte and fre wyll.
Al+so Orosius tellyth that some men were besegid by the Romaynys and be scypyon of Affrike and consydered wele that and if they were take they myght not resiste the Romaynes.
For cawse the sayde Romaynes shuld not reioyce of ther goodes.
They made faste the gatys of ther cite and brynnyd them self ther Cite and all ther goodes rather then they wolde yelde them self to theyr enymyes.
It is red also in Ecclesiasticall historie that in the tyme of Abrahe.

But his wife that was callyd semyramys was am+bycyows to be Queene and to the Entent yt she myght regne she weddid her owne sonne that was namyd Ny+nus.
The which aftyrwarde toke also Syrye and ma+de a greate cytye of thre dayes iourney to goo or to ryde and aftyr his name that was Nynys he callyd the cyte Nynyue.
And the name of him was Babylio and he enlargyd the cite of Babylon.

Thowe Henne thowe mowrnist not with me when thow seyst my Children destroyed.
Thou wilt not synge with me when bringe forth an Egge oute of my bowellys and am delyueryd from greate parell.
And thus they fell at grete varyaunce and spake vnkynde woordis eche to other.
And at the laste they togi+der went to the Egle and sayde.
Gyue iugement betwene vs rightfull Quene we beseche the if it be co~+uenyent for vs twayne to dwell togider or not.
Let them that be gladde haue their dwellynge alone And they that be sadde togider make ther mone.
FOr it is not conuenient for them that be merye and iocounde to walke with them that be in he+uynesse.
Nor for suche as be sad and sorye to dwel with them that be ioyfull and merye. but as the apostle saith ad Romano .xii. Ioye ye withe men ioyjnge
But noot this well yt great gladnesse somtyme maye cawse sodayne deth.
For therwith the harte waxith greate and the naturall hete goith to the extery or partis and then the har+te faylyth and deth entryth.
Wherof Valery tellyth yt on a tyme ther was tydyngis browght to a woman ye her sonne was dede whan he was absente and it was not so but it sprange of errowre of some symple persone Neuerthelesse she beleuyd hit and mournyd and made greate heuynesse. and as she sate wepyng and sorowi~g Sodeynly in came her sonne and whan she sawe hym she ranne to him and kyste him and sodeynlye feldoun dede.
For in heuynesse the naturall hete Is drawyn firste to the inwarde partyes and suche steringe of the hete geuy the nourrisshinge in the membris so cawsith consumpcion in them and so by processe of tyme folowithe Etica as it is wrytten Prouerbio .xv.
An heuy spirite drieth vp the bonys Wherfore it may be prouyd that worldlye ioye is lyke pure wyne which sone turnith and soo doth it but if it be moderate with holsome sadnesse as it is wrytten Ecclesiast .vii. Bettyr it is to goo to an hows of wepinge and sadnesse then to an hows of festis and myrth.
Tully tellythe that whan any consull of Rome had bene at batell and wonne the victory and was come home.
First all the people shuld come agay+ne him with greate gladnesse.
The secownde all ye pry+soners that he had takyn shulde folow his chare with ther hondes faste manaclyd.
The thryd was that the same victowr was indute with the cotearmure of iouis and sate in a chare and was conueyd withe .iiii. white stedys vnto the capitoly.
For first a man of seruyle condicyon shuld sit with him in the chare that hope shulde be geuyn to euery person to come to suche worshippe if his manhode deseruyd it.
The secounde ye same seruaunte syttinge with him shulde Bobbe him and saye to him.
The thryd it was lau+full to euery man that same daye to bringe agayn him all the rebukys that they wold.
Therfor yf paynymes and hethen men thus wisely cowde myxte ther vayne gladnesse.
Moche more we that be Crysten men owe to represse such vanyteys.
For as saynt Gregory saith Perpetuall lamentacyon and heuynesse folowe ye ioyes of the worlde to suche as loue them in especyall.

Therfore descende come down to me and shall crown the and aftyr that thou shalt be prince and regent of the Hennys as he was.

The Foxe was gladde and sterte and caught the Capon lyghtlye and kyllyd hym and sayd To euery worde no credence thow geue. beware of false men that the wolde my scheue.

Nor comynge to synge. and euyn forthwith the Crowe began to synge and the flessh fellowte of his mowth.
Which the foxe cawght and ete and wente his waye.

But the Fesaunte which is a byrde that came firste owte of Greke and his flessh is veray swete to ete ma+gnyfyed him self greatly saynge.
The Pecocke defendid him selfe to his vttermost power and sayde.
Madame and it please your gra+ce it is not so as the Fesawnte hath sayd.
For my self am fayrer than he and gretter and crestid.
And alsoo my tayle yeldith to me the souerayn worshippe.
And with these wordes he lefte vp his Tayle and spredde it a broode and reioycyd greatlye ther in.

Thow Pecocke thow hast greatly rebukyd thiself in lyftynge vp of thitayle.
For thowe hast shewyd vs a payre of fowle fete.
At last she spake also to the Fesawnte and sayde.
Thow hast rinnynge Ien and thow art but we+ke and thow canste not synge.
And therfore for the impedimentis that thow hast and othir cawsis lefull depryue the from worshippe.
And so they both were put from promocyon and contynuyd withowte worshyppe

For be questyoni~g of the Eleccyon many men+nys fawtis be rekenyd vp. Wherfore they be diuerse ty+mes rebuked and diffamyd.
Wherfore it is not good to stryue for preeminence of worshippe.
For Gregory saith Desire of prelacye is gendrid of pryde of the harte and whosoeuyr desyre soueraynte in erth shall fynde confusyon in heuyn.
This desire to haue gouernaunce is perilowse and to be eschewyd to owre powers.
The higher the ruler is in worship the mo+re is he in perell.
Wherfore princes in the old tyme wol+de not suffre ther children to be preferryd withowt they myght profite as tellyth Helmandus historiographus of helio adriano.

This is to saye to destroye his children whan he promotyth them not for ther merytes.
They owe to be norisshed and excercised in vertewe and whan they ha+ue continuyd in them it shuld be prouyd that they shul be goo before in vertewys that shulde be first preferrid to worship.

Wherfore he commaundid that they shulde be excercy+sed to Runnynge to lepynge to swymmynge to throw stonys with the honde or withe a slynge and in suche other faculteys as longith to knyghthode or seruyce.
That and if fortune had dryuen them to the extremyte of po+uertye they shulde haue theyr sustentacyon and leuyn+ge by reason of ther conynge for of spynnynge and we bynge and of cloth makynge thay had not oonely conynge but also daylye excercise.

And his frendes askyd of him why he gra~+tyd more then he myght geue.
And he answerde sayde that for cause no man shuld departe heuyly yt had spok with him.

It is rede in vitis patrum that a Relygyows man spake blamyd on of his bredren and detractyd him before the couente.
The abotte of the same place was agyd and sayde no woorde.
And vppon a tyme whan he bare behynde him a sacke full of grauell and had layde a lytel of the same grauell before hym oon askyd of him what he bare and he sayde a sacke full of grauell which betokened his owne synnes.
But he sayde while they we+re behynde him he carid not for the~.
But the smal hand full of grauell that laye before him he sayde theke were his brodirs synnes which he had detractyd.
And moreouer he addid these woordes and sayd. bredren it shul+de not be soo. but myn owne synnes owyth euyr to be in my mynde.

Doughter goo and breke thy voyce and synge as thou art lernyd and shewe thi connynge to chere owre hartys.
The nyghtingale was obediente and glad to please and began to synge so plesauntly that almaner of byrdes desirouslye lyftened to her songe.
Amonge al othir a crowe came bye and consyderinge that he sayde to him self.

And he began to Croke in a full fowle maner.
The Nyghtingale was styll and myght synge no lenger ye crowe made so fowle a noyse.
And all the other Byrdes were sore trowblyd and abhorryd the Crowe for he de+spisid the feste.
The crowe answerd and sayde that he wolde solempnyse the feste with other bir+des and he intendid not to remeue from his place for her woordes.
The secounde tyme the Egle chargid hym to departe for noman reioycyd to here him.
But the crow wolde not be styll but began to garre and coye more more.
Wherfore the Egle commawndid him to be kylled without lenger respite and sayde in this wise.

SO it is but foly to speke where the herers be dull to take hede.
And there as be senyowrs speke not tomoche lyke as the crowe sange but lewdlye.

[Figure: CIconya vppon a tyme made her neste in an highe towre withowte in ye toppe and the swalowe byldyd within.
But the swalowe made greate noyse oftyn tymes and reioycyd of brynging forth of her byrdes.
For whan she wolde haue takyn reste with her children she myght not for the chatheringe of the swalowe.
Therfor in the absen+ce of the swalowe Ciconya destroyed her neste and kil+lyd her byrdes.
And whan the swalowe was come home agayn to her neste.
But forasmoch as she knew not who did it she auengid not the dede.
Within a while after ye swalowe repayrid her self agayne and made a newe
neste and brought forth her byrdes and was greatlye glad of them and chyrkyd faste and made moche noyse.
Wherfore Cyconia was greuid greatelye as afore tyme and spake lowde and sayde.

This heringe the swalowe and knowynge veryly that Cyconya had mourdird her children with all her hole mynde she bethought her ho+we to be auenged.
And therfore vpon a tyme whan Ci+conia was slepinge with her children the swalowe ca+me pryuelye and sette fire in her neste and brynnyd her with all her children and sayde.
He that on his Enymyes seyth his quarel bewroke Of moche thowght heuynesse his harte is vnloke.
By this exemple it aperith that hit is not goode to vexe or to wronge them that be vndir for doubte that they wyll be auenged other openly or pry+uelye.

As Isope tellyth yt the Egle flewe in to an highe hyll and fownde the foxys children ther which she toke owte of ther denne caryed them with her to her neste that she and her byr+des shulde haue ete them to ther sowper.
And whan ye Foxe was come home to his loggynge et found not his children he went down to the woode and cried for them and at the laste he harde them wepe and mourne in the Eglis neste.
woordis and with greate reuerence prayde her to delyuer the children.
But vtterly the Egle wold not grant nor gyue audyence to her peticion.
Wherfore the Foxe was angrie and impacyent and wente and gadrid styekys bowys and braunches of vynes that were seere drye and brought a bronde in her mowth and made so greate smoke vndre the tre that she kyllyd the Eglys byrdes.
And whan the Egle considerid al thing she was fayne to meke her self and came downe and delyueryd ye whelpes by compulsion.

[Figure: PIgardue is a byrde as wrytteth vgn+cyo and but a lytell byrde nombrid emonge them that be comestible and hable to mannys sustinaunce as hit is wrytten Deuteronomii .xiiii.
And vppon a tyme whan this lytell byrde was sore pursewyd in the eyre by an othir Rauenows byrde and stoode in greate iudardye of her lyfe.
To haue proteccyon and to be defendid she fledde vnto the alie+te and sayde.
Therfore come vnto the that am but lytell and impotent and knowe no refuge and in me is no resisten+ce.

To whom Traiane sayde If come agayne with victorye and helth shal auen+gethe. and the widowe sayde.
Who shall doo equyte to me yf thow be slayne in this batell.
Traiane answerde he that shal succede me in the Empyre.
To whom the wedowe sayde. and what shal that auayle the yf an other man do rightwysnes to me.
Is it not bettyr that thowe thy self doo ryght to me and so to encrece thyn own merytes than to leue it to an othir man.
Then traiane was mouyd with pitie and descendid from his horse and auengid her cawse and set her harte at reste. also vppon an othir tyme whan oon of ye sonnys of traiane rode throwe ye cyte veray wa~+tonly he kyllyd a widows sonne with his horse.

THer is a byrde as Brito saith the which is cal+lyd Onocrotalus or Onocrotalon and his comyth of Onos that is an asse.
For she hath a face lyke an asse and her body is lyke a swan.
This byrde made her neste in a greate wildernesse and layde her eggis and brought forth her byrdes. but whan she cowde no lenger fynde sustynaunce in the deserte to her and her children she went to the cite and callyd the asse to her frendlye and sayd.

The Asse went with this Onocrotalon through the deserte a greate whyle but at the laste with greate labowre he came to the ne+ste and layde down his burdon and toke his rewarde turnyd him homewarde.
But for cawse that he was in deserte and in a fowle myrye contray and knewe not the perfite waye He cowde not goo home and so he perisshed euyn there in the wildernesse and sayde.

WHerby it aperith that noman shulde goo to far+re contrays that he knowith not for dyuers pa+rellys that dayly happe throwe the worlde.

Therfo+re the crowe with great stodye and be+sy labowre sought the meanys to defi+le the swan and to make him blacke as he is.
But forasmoche as he cowde not bringe his propose abowte while the swan was wakynge.

Wherfore vppon a nyghte slepinge ye swan the cursyd crowe came to his neste in secrete wise and defilyd the swan and made hi all blacke.
And wha~ the daye was and Titan shoone and the swa~ was rysen from sleape and espied that he was effecte pollute he went and wasshyd him self so longe that he was puryfyed and clene from all filth and sayde. who that desireth blessyd to be.
THe crowe signifieth the Deuyll which maye not see nor beholde the clene lyfe of the seruauntys of God. wherfore with all his power and might he is besy to pollute and defile them.
But forasmoche as he cannot preuayle agayne them wakynge he labowrith to deceyue them slepinge wherfore man owith to wake.

In this that haue exchewyd ryotte and compenye and haue spoke but lytell.
But most princypallye am glad and reioyce yt haue labowrid with myn owne hondes put no man to charge for my cawse.
THer is a byrde namyd Carduellus which is a byrde of songe and was inclosyd in a cage in a rychemannys place and deyntely fed for thys worthy man had greate pleasure to here hys songe.
And for that cawse he was plentyuouslye seruyd dayly both of mete and drinke and caryd nothinge
for them that were nedye and within a shorte space ther fell great hongre and many pore byrdes were sore punyshed with hongre and colde for it happyd in ye seruente winter season.
And therfore they went to this Carduell and askyd his almysse.
But he gaue them none but the fragmentys and leuynges of his Table and suche as he wolde not ete him self.
The sely byrdes gladlye toke that was geuyn them and made no re+fuse.
SOme suche folkes ther be whiche vnto pouer people will geue nothinge that goodis but that yt ys vyle and nawghte.
And almyghty God abhorryd the oblacyon of Cayme for cause that he gaue of the worste and he acceptyd the gyftes of Abell for he offirde of the beste.

And therfore with a comune consent they came to him and askyd of him what was the grettest curtesye that cowde be.
To whom he sayd To gyue and to be lyberall.
And he bad them take ther cownsell togidir and tell hym which was the grettest chorlysshnes that cow+de be amonge all other.
And they layde ther hedis togi+der and cowde not accorde.
my self set yowe in the way by the which ye myght wele haue knowyn the playne solucyon of my questyon.
So is takyn awaye most chorlysshnes for it is contrary to gyfte.

And he put her in to his Potecarye shoppe that she shulde smell swete and be pourgyd with medecynes.
but al that sauowryd not with her while she was there but rather she couetyd stynkynge careyne. wher+fore she wolde not abyde but wente her waye.
For her apetite was not to ther clennes and swettenesse was.
and therfore she endyd the residewe of her lyfe in filthede and corrupcyon as she had before vsyd and say+de thus.

They be soone retournyd to ther synnes agayne as a dogge to his vomyte.
Wo be him that in lechery dyethe and woo be to him that in his laste ende makythe an ende of his stynkynge lechery.

The Pellycan was victe and ouercom with the fayre wordes and desires of the Tame byrdes and taryed styll with them a sertayne season and had royall chere and faryd delycatelye euery daye.
But whan he shulde praye and be in contemplacyon and redynge of holy scrypture he cowde not be quyete.
Nor he cowde not lyue soberlye as he had before vsyd for greate habowndance of mete and drinke.
Wherfore he conceyued an inwarde remembraunce of his sowle helth and as sone as he had oportunyte he retournyd in to wyldernesse and in to secrete place where he labowryd in gostely labowre and perfowrmyd a manly batell agayn his goostely enymys and endid his course and obseruyd his feith and deuocyon in greate quyetenesse sayd He that wyll praye and be contemplatyf.

CLene and most Chaste is the Turtyl amonge all othir byrdes.
For whyle she dwellythe with her husbonde she louyth neuer noon other.
And yf he dye she neuer takith mo husbondis nor ma+kes.
And aftir his deth she euer drinketh trowblyd water and sitteth neuer aftyr vpon grene
Ther was somtyme a Turtyll that was a wydowe for her husbonde was decesid. wherfor she was greatly heuy and wolde neuer walke abrode nor take consolacyon.
But in greate merowre and lame~+tacyon she contynuyd and ledde a veray clene and chaste lyfe. and all other byrdes were compassionable vnto her consyderinge that she was lyklye to peryssh for the greate and continuall heuynesse that she made.
Sister why con+sume ye yowre self thus with heuynesse and sorowe.
Come and be mery with vs a while for we in the most glad wise that we can intende to cherissh yowe lodge yowe and doo yowe comforte.
And the Turtill knowin+ge ther good wylles was somdele comforted and went charitably with them.
And all the byrdes receyuyd her frendely and brought her to ther nestis and gaue her parte of all suche vytayles as they had.
This Turtil was armyd with the zele of chastyte and whan she vn+derstoode the greate fornicacyons that were occupyed there.
She myghte in no wyse suffir the stenche of ther lecherye. wherfore she fled and abhorryd the place and wyllyd not to abyde there.
And whan she had doone soo oftyntymes at the laste she vtterly forsoke that lecherows compenye for euer and retournyd vnto the clennesse of chastite and sayde.

SO owe they to do that be bownde to kepe chastite For they shulde not onlye flee fro lecherows personys.
But also fro the howsis of them for the abomynacyon and stenche of lecheryc.
For ther is nothing mo+re stynkynge and hatefull then the stenche of lecherye and flesshly luste with pollucyons and therfore Bernarde
The apetyte of lechery is full of thowght adede of abomynacyon and vnclennesse.
Of a moder and her doughters that kyssed eche othir and ledynge lyke a daunce they lepte all togider in to a greate watyr and drownyd them self for cawse they wolde not be rebukyd of ther neybowris of ther vyolacyon.
And saynte Augustyn tellyth a lyke tale in his boke de Ciuitate Dei of Lucrece whiche whan she was vyolently oppressyd of the kynges sonne Tarquynye she inducyd her frendes to be venged.
And aftyrward she was syke and impacyent of that sa+me synne that was comytted with her and kyllyd her self.
Though she shulde not so haue done as saynt augustyn saith.
For verylye no creature owithe to sle her self for to eschewe the lechery of an other.
For she can not be defilyd with the fawte of eny other person perse+ueringe in a chaste purpose thoughe she be vyolentlye oppressyd.
For the bodye is sanctified or corrupte aftyr ye entente of the mynde.

For whan the chekins that she had hat+chid here the voyce of ther owne modyr by ther own na+turall instinccyon they forsake her that brought them vppe and retourne vnto ther owne modyr that gendrid them.

Vppon a tyme ther was a false partryche that stale ye Eggis of an other byrde in her absence.
and whan she that had bene absente was retournyd home to her own neste and fownde not her Eggis she made greate sorow and sowght all abowte with a full heuy chere for them But at the laste withe greate labowre and stodye she fownde both the egges and the theef that stale them immediatly she shewyd the mater vnto the and he cytyd the theef and examyned the mater subtellye.
But he cowd not come to the knowlege of the trowth For the theef denyed it vtterly. and the iuge cowde not gyue diffinytif sentence of deth for ther was no wytnes+se.

To whom the iuge answerde sayd Thow owyste to proue that thowe haste sayd that iugement maye be rightfull.
But whan noo proof cowde be made of ye matere. the iuge had suspeccyon and commandid them both to be greuously punyshed and emonge ther paynes examynyd of the mater.
And the theef made opyn confessyon both of that myscheuows dede and many othir that he had done before that tyme.
Wherfore the iuge commaundid the theef to be hangid withowt lengar taryinge and sayde.
THerfore begyn thow firste at thi self and reuollue in thyn owne mynde and thinke what thow arte thi self that accusist an othir and whedir thow be not reproueable of that same worde or dede.

And it fortunyd vppon a tyme that he had a greuows strooke of a bee which gre+uyd hym very sore. wherfore he was right angrye and thretenyd the beys and sayde in this wyse promyse yow by God almyghty that and euer ye stynge me mo+re shall ouerthrowe yowe and dryue yowe awaye.

This Chorle within a shorte space after came agayne to his hyues and toke owte the honycombes and forth came a bee stunge hym sore and thryst in his spere and gaue hym a greate wownde wherfore he was woode and in grete angre he ouerthrew all the hyues and destroyd them and the beys seynge the greate furyowsnes of the chor+le.
They forsoke him all at oonis and came neuer more there.
and so the Chorle was brought to greate pouerte that was somtyme vsyd to lyue prosperouslye. and whan he remembrid the greate auayle and profite that he had receyuyd before season of the beys and the pouerte that he was fall inne he bewaylyd his misera+ble state and sayde.

The lyon seynge yt was sore aferde sayd within him self and if this Gryfon take parte agayn me shall be ouercome.
Wherfore dowte yt if he fortifie the beastis shal not mowe du+re.
Therfor both the lyon and the Egle sente forth em+bassatowrs to the Gryfon to vnderstonde what he was and why he sate there.
To whome the Gryfon sayde am a byrde and a beaste but neyther.
And whan he had geuen this answere he was gracyously receyuyd of all beastis and byrdes And so this Grifon walkyd at his pleasure emonge them all for he was not suspect to neyther partye and whan he sawe oportunite he began to treate of peace and for cawse the partyes had no suspeccyon in hym they compromytted the mater frely in to his hondes he gaue sentence yt thei shuld depart fro ye feelde in all hast possible no more to continewe warre but dwell in peace for euer and sayde.

It is red in+vit. pa. yt on a tym ther was a gret stryf betwene an he thin a crysten cam togider with ther kynsmen and

But notwithstondinge oon that was cheef cawser of the discorde and discencyon which was a cursyd man and myscheuows lettyd the peace and sayde that he wolde neuer haue peace while he leuyd.
Be it as thou sayst For this daye shall noon be slayne excepte the and thi sepulchre shall be congruente to thy deseruinge in the belyes of all byrdes and beastis and so it was in dede.
For he was sone slayne in that same fight and troden in the sonde and there he laye all the nyghte.
And in ye morninge his frendes came to burye his bodye they fownde it all to torne and deuowrid of Grypes and of other wylde beastis.
[Figure: IT fortunyd vppon a tyme that the ly+on maryed twayne of his sonnis and he gaue to euery of them a gret woode to ther mariage.
But or euer he sente them fro~ him he warnyd them of thre thinges and sayde.
Children kepe ye my commaundmentis and in especiall obserue these thre thinges and ye shall prospere and leue merylye.
First loke that ye be in reste and peace withe them that be abowte yowe.
The secounde kepe ye well this wood which haue geuyn to yowe that beastis and Catell maye multiply and increce ther in.
And the thryd fight neuer with the kynde of man in nowyse.
The eldeste kepte trulye these commaundementis of his fader and increcyd in greate welth and richesse.
The yonger trou+blyd sore with his seruantes and had neuer peace in his howsolde.
Wherfor he ranne in to the wodes with gre+te furyousnes and cruelly kyllyd all the beastis that were there and shortely to tell he robbyd all the wode.
And at a layser he went to see his brodir and whan he behylde him in welth and hauinge greate aboundance of richesse he sayde.
am vnhappye for lyue in grete penurite and trowble and thow arte and lyuyst in greate peace and pleasure.
To whom the older sayde Thow hast not obseruyd my faders preceptis therfore these incomodyteys bene fall vppon the but praye the to come with me in to the woodis and se how haue keppyd and increcyd my faders goodes.
And as they went togider ther came an hunter and pighte vp his nettys for to Catche of the beastis.
Seyste thow not how yonder lytell man labowrith and intendith to destroye vs.
fader commaundid vs that we shulde not fighte with man in nowyse.
Fye on the wretch wylt thow lese thy noblesse leonyne for vayne fablys my self shal go plucke him on smale pecys. and as he ran in greate haste towarde man and toke noon hede of the nettis he fel amonge them and was faste masshid and takyn and destroyed.
The elder lyon tournyd home agayne and sayde with a full sadde mynde.
The faders preceptis he that obseruith In greate suretye him self conseruith
THerfore it aperith playnly that it is a sure thing to kepe the commaundmentis of fadir and modir and to be obedyent vnto them in all thinge that lefull is as sayth the Apostle ad colos .vi. Children be ye obedient in God to yowr genytowris for yt is rightfull.
It is tolde in fablys that a lyon was bedrede and laye in his bedde styll and myght not ryse for age.
But a whelpe of his which was very strong yonge and lu+stye.
Ioye thow sonne and be merye for almaner of beastis drede the.
Fight thow neuer with man for he is strengest of all beastis.
This yonge lyon was sore temptyd agayne man and sauwghte him to fight with hym.
And as he went he fownde two oxen yowkyd togider vnder a iocke and he askyd of them and sayde.
But we be subduyd of man This whelpe was euer the lenger the fiersar and fon+de an horse fast chaynyd with Iron and a sadyll vppon his backe and to him he sayde.
Arte thow man whom seke and he answerd and sayd naye but he hath ma+de me faste.
The lyon meruaylyd ran forth at the laste he fownde an husbonde man cleuynge a tre.
Let vs cleue this tre firste and after that we shall haue layser nowgh to fighte and with these woordes the man made a greate clyfte in the tre with his axe and tawght the Lyon to putte in his Cleys in to the clyfte that it shulde the soner be clouyn a sonder.
And whan he had put them in the ma~ pluckyd owte his axe and the Cleys of the Lyon were faste in the tre and the man cryde owte for helpe of his neybowris.
To whose clamowre all men of the towne rose vppe and ran owte some with swerdes some with clubbys and some with spetys to sle the lyon And he seynge him self in so greate iubardye for haste he lefte his cleys in the tre and scantlye cowde escape withe a payre of blodye fete.
And so with greate confusyon he tournydde home agayne vnto his Fader and comfermyd hys cownsell For he had prouyd hytte by experience.
And the kyndes of these bir+des be gendrid in eperboray mowntis that is scithia asiaticha and he is ly+ke vnto an Egle both in hede and in wyngis and in all other partyes of his body.
He is sembleable to a lyon and he destroyeth both men horsis. and he putteth a smaragdyne stone in his neste agayne venymous beastes of ye mownte
[Figure: And he sleyth and destroyeth all men that dwell nere him.
But for his Tyrannye and Couetyse he commaundid thre thinges.
First that no man shulde be receyuyd ther ney+ther to bye nor sell.
Secounde that no maner of creature shulde come thedir from other contrays.
The thryd that noon of all his people shuld be so hardye to go to other contrays.
And these thre commaundmentys were obserued of his subiertis and he leuyd in delycis and pleasure and gadryd greate goodes and no wonder.
For what so euer that cam to his possession he partyd with noman therof.
And vppon a tyme by the rightfull iugemente of God.
The dwellers and comprouincy allys of that contrey ran all togider to the gryfon crying and saynge.
And he sent forth legates to other nacyons that were nexte adioynaunte to him that thei shuld sende of ther goodes and graynes vnto him and sell them at ther owne pryce.
To whom they answerde and sayde. thow woldist neuer sell to vs noon of thi goodes.
Nor now in thi nede we will noon sell to the.
He sent agayne other messangers desyringe them to come with marchaundise and to haue fre passage at ther pleasure.
Thow woldist neuer receyue vs before this ty+me nor nowe thou shalt not.
The thrid tyme he sent to them and prayde them to receyue him and his people not to forsake them in mysery and penurite.
Thowe camste neuer to vs tell nowe nede coartyth the and therfore we shall not receyue the but rather dryue the from vs and if thow come to vs.
And soo forsakyn of al people in grete wretchidnes he dyed with all his nacyon and sayde.
He that wyll not serue nor helpe at no nede.
THerfore hit is good to be curteys and to receyue foraynes and straungers and to vse marchaun+dise with other nacyons and to departe the wor+delye goodes with other and let them ronne to comyn vse for owr sauyowre saith Mat .vii.
All thinge that ye wyll othermen do to yow do ye the same vnto them Thus biddith the lawe and prophetis all.
Be thow such to othermen as thowe desyrest to haue them to the.
It is red that whan Alexander went by the waye with his oste and both he and all they we+re nyghe loste with thurste oon gaue to him a cuppe of fayre watir for a greate gyfte and he commaundid hit to be powrid owte.
For he wolde not drinke him self for cawse he cowde not gyue parte to his knyghtes.
Ecclesiasti .x. haue fownde reste vnto me and shall ete of myn own goo+dis alone.
Suche couetowse men shulde not be preferrid Wherfore in the olde tyme suche as louyd auaryce shul+de not be preferryd agayne ye comyn wele as Valety tellyth libro sexto that whan two consullis of rome shul+de haue be sente in to spayne and the romaynes toke counsell and deliberacyon ther vppon.
For the oon of the~ hath nothinge and to the other nothinge sufficith.
Also Valerye tellith that Tiberius the Emperowre chaungid but seldome the iuges of the prouynces for cawse that they that were newe ordeyned were verye redy and intentyf to receyue.
An example is shewyd of a man that was wowndid the whiche a greate hepe of flyes coueryd and oon came bye and sawe them draue them awaye.
Thow hast done euyll to me for these were full and replete.
Nowe shall othir come that be hongrye and do me more greef. and in lykewyse iugis whan thei be nedy or couetowse thei be gredye to catche and desirows to haue.
It is red in the fablys of poetys that a kynge desired of apollyne yt whatsoeuyr he towchid myght be tournyd to Golde and it was grauntyd to him.
And soo whan he shulde towche mete or drinke with his hondis or with his lips towarde his mouth it was tournyd in to golde. and he was oftyn hongry and perisshed for lacke of sustinance.
And so haboundance of richesse makyth a couetows man hongry and destroyeth him it is redde in Croniclys.
That Taryce a queene whan she had takyn the kynge of perce she cawsyd his hede to be smytte of put it in to a botell full of bloode and sayde.
So shall it fall in tyme comynge to couetows tyrauntis the which desire the blode of the pouer people.
As a philosofre tellith that Nero the Emperowre was sene in hell bathinge him self in sethynge golde.
And whan he sawe a greate many of comers bye he sayde to them come hider ye people that be venditowrs of yowr neybowris and bath yowe here with me for haue reseruyd the best parte to yow.
Of a Leoparde and an Vnicorn that fawght with a dragon.
THere is a beaste the which is gendrid of a Lyon and a Parde saith Solinus and is namyd Leo+pardus.
And the femalis of them be bolder and strengar then the malys.
Who so wyll resiste to wode Leopardus muste rubbe garlyke betwene his hondes and withowte Ta+ryinge the Leoparde goith away for he in nowyse may abyde the ayre of garlyke.
And the Leoparde berith a co+lowre subrufe and he is full of blacke spottis and these beastis be moche lesse them lyons and yf he fortune to ete any venyme he sekyth for the donge of man etith it and is hole.
These leopardus be most cruell of kynde in somoche that they can neuer be tamyd to forgete ther cruelnesse.
And neuerthelesse they be tamyd and tawght to hunte and whan thei se ther pray they be lette lose and if he cannot catche hit at the fowrth or the fyfte lepe he is euen wode and what soo euer come before him in that wodenesse he rinneth vp+pon it be it man or beaste but yf the hunter preuyde some beste and gyue it him forthwith.
For it is impossible to please hym but with bloode.
This Leoparde vppon a tyme fawght with a dragon but he preuayled not.
Wherfor he went to the vnicorne and mekely besought him of helpe and sayde.
Wherfore praye the inteer+lye to defende me from the furowre of this dragon. the vnicorne began to exalte hym self herynge this and sayde.
For am an olde warryowre and shall defende the in the beste wise haue thow no doughte.
And the drago~ faught agayne them both spet fire owte of his mowth with greate stench.
And whan the Dragon ga+pyd the vnicorne ranne as faste as he cowde willynge to thrufte him throwgh the throte.
But the dragon mo+uyd his hede and the Vnicorne smote his horne in the grownde faste and cowde not plucke it owte and there he dyed and sayde.

Vppon a tyme dyuers men in harneys pur+sewyd ther enymyes and an other man came and saw them and ran to helpe the man and stode withe hym agayne his enymyes.
Take thow that is thyne and goo thy waye for we desire to be venged on owre enymye and not on the he wolde not be rulyd but made him self redy and sawght agayne them with all his power.
And they had indignacyon of him and maymyd him with ther enymye.
ELephas as Brito saith comith of Elephis grece which is an hyll in lateyne and he is so callyd for the gretnesse of his bodye.
For the warryowrs of Perce and Mede vse to fight in Cowris of Tymbre set vp+pon the of these beastis and cast downe sperys and dartys as from a wall and these Elephawntys haue greate mynde and vnderstondinge and they goo togider after ther manere and they fere the mows and flee from him and they goo two yere with whelpe. and they neuer gendir but oonys.

And by his naturall instinccyon he knowith the innocencye of the virginall flessh and geuyth worshippe vnto the chastite of them.
and as he is lyckynge the brestes and pappes of them he is meruelous+ly delytyd and fallyth a sleape. and withowte Taryinge the mayde with the sworde smyteth him in to the softe belye and shedith his bloode and he fallyth down and the other mayde receyuyth the bloode in the potte.
with the which is dyed a purple colowre that longyth oonly to a kynge to were.
This beaste is very famows and greately reuomyd amonge all other beastis and notwithstondinge he may not knele for he hath no kne+ys.
Vpon a tyme the Lyon walkyd by the wode amon+ge all other beastis and lokyd on them and all made greate curtesye and knelyd down vnto him as to ther souerayne lorde and kynge.
Wherfor the other wilde beastis were inuidious went togider to ye Lyon diffamyd ye elefant. ye lyon cam to hi~ sayd.
Why art thou so proud so harde hartyd yt thou bowist not thi kneys befor me as other beastis do.

But his fawt be prouid for the iuge may him saue
IN lykewyse iugis shulde attende to gyue right fall iugement and not aftir diffamacyon but af+tir the trowth of euery thinge.
For he is notte alwaye fawtye that is accusyd but he that is prouyd as sayth Isidore. and also he saith.
First proue and then gyue iu+gement Wherof Valery tellith of oon callyd Naulius torquatus.
That whan his sonne was accusid vnto him of a trespace and conuicte of the same he gaue sen+tence of him and sayde.
Whan haue cownsellyd my sonne to obserue my commaundmentis and it is prouid vnto me that he hath receyuyd money of his felows contrarye to my byddinges.
therfore discharge him of myn hows and gyue this sentence that he is worthy to be punyshed and shall suffre deth and so he did.
Th{us} a iuge owith to do for he shulde not do contrarye vnto righte for loue nor for hatred.
For Bernard sayth loue and hatrede knowithe not the iugement of trowth.
Therfore Valerye tellyth libro sexto that whan Cale+ricus gouernyd the comyn wele within a cite that he made him self the which was defensyd with full holso+me and iuste lawes amonge all other ther was a consti+lucy on that whosoeuer were take and prouyd in the cry me of adulterye shulde lose both his Ien. and whan his owne sonne was take in the same fawte and al the cite came togider and prayde for him yt the payne might be remytted.
a while he repugnyd at last he was victe and ouercome with the supplicacyon of the people.
But that notwithstondinge he put oon of his own Ien first out and after oon of his sonnys Ien and soo he gaue a meruelows temperament to equyte.
euery of them both vse of seynge and executyd dewe iu+stice and shewyd him self both rightwys and mercyfull.
also Valery tellyth of oon callyd Carandius Tiri+us which made a lawe that whosoeuyr entrid among any company of people with a sworde or a dagger abou+te him shulde dye.
And within a while aftir whan he was come home from farre contreys he cam in to his owne hows with his swerde abowt hym.
And whan he was warnyd of oone that stode bye him of brekynge of the lawe euyn strayte he pluckyd owte his swer+de and kylled him self.
For he wolde not defende hys errowre nor dyssymyle but rather suffer payne then breke the lawe.
Also valerye tellythe libro sexto that whan a iuge had geuyn false iugemente vppon a tyme kynge Cambizes cawsyd him to be flaynt and his skynne to be set faste vppon the iudiciall sete and caw+syd his sonne to sitte and gyue iugementis in the same sete aftir the deth of his fader.
And soo he ordeyned by this newe payne that no iuge aftyrwarde durst bre+ke the lawe nor be corupte peruertynge rightwysnes.
For so commawndith the lawe of God as it is wrytten Deutero .xvi. Ordeyne two iugis and rulers in euery place to iuge the people rightfully and se yt they varye not from equite in to noon other waye for loue nor for drede but do rightfully and indifferentlye at al tymes to euery persone.

[Figure: Lyon ther was somtyme that was a famowse honter and euer this was his customable vsage.
Whan he hontyd he wolde sadly beholde all ye beastis before him and marke surely oone of the beste and hym pursewe with all his myghte.
But the beaste beynge in goode distaunce and remote frome the lyon.
Wherfor the lyon was gre+uyd lackynge of his purpose and faylynge of that he hopyd to haue.
And than he labowrid to haue of the other beastes that he had first forsakyn.
For they were goo and fledde and hydde them in ther couertys. wherwith the Lyon was angir+de so bytterlye that he wolde neuer aftyr hunte more but sayde with grete wodenesse.
It is a great madnesse the suretye forsake Of thinge that is sertayne and the contrary take.
SO manyon whan they may haue ye thingis yt be competent for the~. thei take noon hede therto .coue+tinge to haue bettyr therfor they be oftyn deceyuid cannot com to possessid of suche thingis as thei in tyme past might haue had.
then they wolde take yt thei may not com by recouir yt is loste vnrecouirable.
wherfore thei mourne be in gret heuinesse. agayn who~ dauid spekith .ii. re .xii Now yt he is dede why do faste whethir may cal hi~ agayne shal rather go to hi~.
It is also tolde in fablys that ye Nyghtingale taught a yongma~ yt had takin her to mourne not to gre+tely for a thinge loste yt cowde not be recouerid as it is redde in balaam it is but a madnesse and parell to forsake a thinge sure and sertayne for an other thinge vay+ne and vncertayne as Isope she with by example that
ther was a dogge went ouer a brigge and bare a peace of flessh in his mowth and whan he espied the shadowe in the watyr he forsoke the flessh that he had in his mouth to kache the flessh that aperyd in the watyr.
So do manyon that for couety+se of getynge forsake ther sure possession to optayne yt they haue not nor neuer can haue.
Wherfor Isope saith Thinges certayne owe not to be forsakyn for vanyteys For as it is but madnesse to truste tomoche in surete so is it but foly to hope tomoche of vanyteys for vayne be all erthly thinges longynge to men as sayth Dauyd psal .xciiii.
Wherof it is tolde in fablys that a lady vppon a tyme delyuered to her mayden a Galon of mylke to sell at a cite and by the waye as she sate and restid her by a dyche syde she began to thinke yt with ye money of the mylke she wolde bye an henne the which shulde bringe forth chekyns and whan they were gra+wyn to hennys she wolde sell them and by piggis and eschaunge them in to shepe and the shepe in to oxen so whan she was come to richesse she sholde be maried right worshipfully vnto some worthy man and thus she reioycid.
And whan she was thus meruelously co~fortid and rauisshed inwardely in her secrete solace thin+kynge with howe greate ioye she shuld be ledde towar+de the chirche with her husbond on horsebacke she say+de to her self.
Goo we goo we sodaynlye she smote the grounde with her fote myndynge to spurre the horse but her fote slypped and she fell in the dyche and there laye all her mylke and so she was farre from her purpose and neuer had that she hopid to haue.
Of a beaste callyd Tragelaphus that was a False byldar.
TRagelaphus that is a beaste of a gote and a harte as saith brito and it is a nown compoun+de of tragos that is a goote and is an harte which beaste thoughe he be of the similitude of an harte in somparte.
Neuerthelesse he hath rowgh herys lyke a goote behynde and a barbydde chynne and hornis he hath also lyke an harte and full of braunchis.
This beaste was a principall workman and a greate deuisar in byldinges.
But he was a false disceyuar and begilyd many folkes.
For whan he shulde gyue cownsell for dyuers edificacions to be made.
He wolde ordeyne suche fundacyon that ye byldinge shulde sone fall and to him self he wolde saye Hit forsith not to me thowgh it fall.
the more adauntage in Reedificacion of suche workys and thus his badde cownsell was robbery to euery ma~ that medlyd with him. amonge all other in that countrey ther was a myghty tyraunte wyllynge to bylde a meruelows paleys for him self.
And for to haue it per+fourmyd he sent for this hedemastir and delyueryd to hym money innumerable for the construccyon of the Palace.
This cheef workmastir layde a badde fundacion lyke as he had vsto before tyme in somoche that whan the worke was finisshed the wallys departyd and Claue a sonder in the myddes and all the hoole worke began to synke.
The Ciraunt that seynge was sore agreuyd and cited the archemastir and sayde vnto hym.
was whan sayde the fundacion but nowe it behouith to bere downe this worke and make a bettyr fundacion This tyraunte was wode that soo greate a coste was loste and cawghte him and threwe hym downe from the loppe of the palace and destroyde him and sayde.
THerfore be thow ware to geue false consell and wyckyd.
For many tymes it happith that thei which gyue false Counsell fall in greate trowble and myscheef as it is wrytten eccle .xxvii.
To the gyuer of wycked counsell all myscheef shall happyn he shall not knowe how it comith to him.
As Orosius testith that whan a Tyraunte vppon a tyme had dam+pnyd many innocentis.
goldsmyth that was namid Pimis wyllynge to please the sayde Tiraunte made a grete bull of brasse hauinge a durre in oone of his sydes
by the which they that were dampnyd myght be put in to the sayde brasyn beaste and he gaue it to the sayde tyraunte to the entente that he shuld include al them that he louyd not and put fire vnder and soo in greate paynes they shulde crye and make greate noyse lyke oxen or other beastis.
But this tyraunte abhorryd soo cruell a dede and sayde vnto him that he hym self first shulde entir that by him he myghte haue experience what noyse he cowde make other lyke an oxe or lyke a cowe.
And immediately he was put inne and pwnysshede withe deddely payne that he hadde ordeynyd for other.
[Figure: VNto an oxe ther is a beaste right lyke and is namyd Bubalus.
Soo vntame that for wyldnesse he wyll bere no yoc+ke in his necke.
In germa+ny also be wylde oxen hauinge hornis of so greate length that they be set with drinke vpon the kynges table for ther greate capacite as saith Isi+dore.
it is a beaste of great strength wherfore he cannot be tamyd but yf an iron ringe be fastnyd in his no+se by the which he maye be ledde. and he is blacke or yelowe of colowre and he hath but fewe herys or noon He hath also a forehede of horne desensyd withe tway myghty hornis.
And the flessh of him is profitable not oonly to mete but also to medecyne as saith Plinius lib .xxviii.
This Bubalus was a shomaker greatlye namyd for his conninge whiche by his crafte honestlye and kepte a grete how solde.
But aftir that whan he had gotyn greate goodes by his Crafte he began to despise it and sayde.
This is a fowle craste and a hatefull for euer my hondes be blacke.
sit also continually in filth and turpitude lyckynge blacke ledir and shoone.
But wyll amende it and be an apote carye For then shall be redolente and swete. whan he was a spicer and shulde occupie his craste euery ma~ mockyd him for he cowde no skyl theron nether to bye nor sell.
Wherfore with in shorte tyme all his goodes ye he had before gadryd were consumyd and wastyd and he was fall in greate pouertye and made grete heuynes+se and sayde.
EVery man therfor beware and considre his own state and lyghtly not chaunge.

Nor also to be inclynyd or bowyd from vertue by promes or adulacyo~s.
And also as the expositor super boecium deconsolatione saith that the philosofirs layde or cowchyd two Tonnes of wyne in the entrey of the hows of Iouys and aftir the de+claracyon of the sayd expositor.
The hous betokenyth this worlde present the two tonnys prosperite and aduersite.
Of which it behouith euery creature to taste en+tringe in to this worlde.
Alexander myght not ouerco+me the constaunce and perseueraunce of Diogenes.
For whan he came to him on a tyme sittinge in the son+ne and bad him desire what he wolde and accordinge to reason he shulde haue it.
wolde quod he be+fore all othir thinges that thow kepe not the sonne fro+me that is to meane that thou stonde not betwene me and the sonne. and so hereof came a prouerbe.
That alexander attemptid to haue put diogenem from his de+gre of stablenes but it was more esy to him to depriue kynge Dary from his Roall see by force of armis. and therfore saith Seneca libro quinto de beneficiis that
Diogenes was moche strenger and richer than alexa~+der hauinge al the worlde.
For it was more yt he frely refusyd than euer ye other might gyue. therfore that day Alexander was victe for he founde suche a man to the which he cowde nothinge gyue nor take awaye.
The olde philosofirs dispysyd all temporall thinges and reputyd them to be vyle and of no valowre. wher+fore a Philosofre weppyd for he sawe men labowring and trauelynge with so greate dylygence abowte ther feeldis vynes and how singes as though in them were perpetuall blysse.

This iuuencus was a speciall go+de Coke for he cowde make dyuers go+de dysshes and delicate.
But his connynge was moche the lesse alowyd for he ouersaltyd his mete destroyd it.
Wherfore his lorde callyd him before him and sayde Why destroyest thow my mete that is so sumptuous and delicate with vnmesurable salte.
salte it well for it sauowrith relecith ye bettyr in my mouth.
Seynge his mastir yt he wolde not amende for his greate glotonye he all to bete him and put him owte of his seruyce and soo he was expulsyd fro manye goode seruyce and atte the laste for his insaciable glotonye and inordinate apety+te of vnmesurable sauowre he was kyllyd and wretchydly dyed and sayde.

Obedyent people vnto the belyes haue the lykenesse of vnclene beastis not of resonable creaturis but as the glose saith.

In fraunce somtyme was an abbotte the which dayly was seruyd delicatly and ete of the beste and ri+chesse he lackyd noon.
But he was euir sike and cowde not be repayrid with medecynys.
Wherfore he was in desperacyon of his lyfe and toke vppon him the ordyr of cisterciense in the which for parcyte and scarcenesse of mete he amendid and was hole and stronge.
Wher+fore Galiene saith. abstynence is most excellent medecyne. and also it is wrytten ecclesia .xxxvi.

Go with me to see dyuers thinges that maye proue thy lernynge. and as they wente by a wode syde there came an hunter hauinge a bowe and a~rowis and ordeynyd to shoote aftyr the bere and the foxe.
And whan she espied the bowe and the arowe she lepte a syde and escapid fro the stroke.
The bere was prowde trustyd to his owne strength and came hastely agayne the man willyng to teere him on pecys but the hunter losyd his arowe and smote yt bere and kylde him.
This seinge the lyon sayde vnto the hare. Make me a prouerbe of this that may kno+we thi science.

His felowe descendid whan the bere was goone and askyd of his felowe what the bere had sayde to hi~ in his ere and he sayde.
The bere counsellyd me to be+ware of suche a felowe that hath forsake me in so grete a iubardye.
And it is to be notyd that enymyes that offende eyther to othir to the vttermoste that they can they maye neuer haue sure and continuall peace togider aftir.
Wherof an example is tolde of a chorle that had but oone sonne.
And vppon a tyme he lycencyd hi~ to goo to a place and playe. and a serpent bote him and kylled him and he was buryed and a signe set vppon his graue.
The sayde chorle lay dayly in a wayte and be thought him howe he myght sle the serpente and at laste fownde him and in greate angir smote at hym wyllynge to haue kyllyd him.
But the serpent fledde in to an hole and he smote of his tayle.
And ther grew inextinguible hatrede betwene the chorle and the scrpe~+te.
The chorle at laste spake of peace but the serpente answerde and sayde.
For as longe as thou seyste the graue of thisonne as oftyn as beholde my Tayle cut of ther shall neuer betwene vs by perfite peace nor concorde.
[Figure: OAmula as saith Papie is a female go+te of the wyldernesse.
This gote war+chid on a nyght with a chorle and as she wente homeward from her pastu+re the wolf came to her and sayde.

And truly promyse vnto the whan haue fedde him shal retourne to the agayn.
Go to thi folde and bringe thi kydde with the For desire greately to se him and shall be Fauowrable to yowe both but withowte the he shall haue no grace.
This Female gote sware to fulfill all this and forth she wente.
But whan she came home she kepte her hows and brought
vppe her kydde and neuer retournyd to the wolf. wher+fore the wolf made greate lamentacyon many a longe daye aftir and sayde.
Is not wise to lese it for promys tresour or londe.
So manyon hauing sufficience for concupiscens auarice desire to swalow vp al thinges like wol+fis insaciable that neuer be saturate. wherfore they be voyde oftyntymes and not alwaye fully replete.

The Couetows man shall neuer be fyllyd with money and therfore olde princis hatyd couetyse and forsoke it.
And they desirid not to haue dominacyon to gadre money but for worshippe and conseruacyon of the comune wele. wherfore Valery tellyth. lib .iii. whan Scypion was accusyd of couetyse to the Senate he answerde and say+de in this maner. whan lately had subduyd all Affri+ke vnto yowr power.
reseruyd therof nothinge to my behofe sauf oonly my name.
For he was namyd euyr aftir Scipio Affrican. for he subduyd affrike.
Valery al+so tellith of man tense curione that was the verye loremastir of curtesye of rome and a spectacle of strength whan the legatis of the Sannytes were come to hym and he had receyuyd them in to his place they behylde hym sittynge by the fire vppon a stole etynge his sowpere in a platere of tre.
They offirde to him a gret sum+me of Golde and with swete woordes they prayde him to occupie the Golde to his worshippe and to ete nomore in tre.
And he lawghid and sayde. your labowre is in vayne to bringe Golde to me.
But goo ye and repoorte vnto the Sannytes that the Mantense Curione de+sireth rather to rule them that hath possessyon of golde
than to haue the golde. and also saye vnto them that the sayde Curione wyll notte be corrupte by no money nor by drede of any enymyes.
Also it is tolde in that same place that whan the legatis sent from the sannytes were come to Rome the founde fabrice prince of the Ro+maynes sittinge and syngynge.
To whom whan they had offirde a greate Summe of Golde for ther lyberty He beholdinge not his owne wele but rather the comu+ne profit gaue this answer to them and sayde.
Goo ye fro me and bere yowr Golde with yowe.
For Romay+nes haue more affeccyon to haue dominacion ouir gold+kepers then ouer the Golde.
And also saynt Augustin tellyth de ciuitate Dei that Lucyus Valerius that dyde whan he was consull of Rome was so poore that no money was founde in his hows whan he shulde dye. wherfore he desyred the people to ordeyne for his beryin+ge.
For in that tyme the princes that rulyd the comune thinge that was mooste ryche.
In ther owne howsis they were very pouer. wherfore saint Augustyne saith in the same place that oon of them was twyes consull and he was vtterly expulsyd of the Senate for cawse that .x. powndis of money were fownde in his hows.
Euery man labowrid to encrece the comyn wele and not his owne and desired rather to be pouer in a riche reame than to be riche in a pouer reame And he inducith examplys of the consullys that were soo pouer whan they dyed that they had no goodes to preferre theyr doughtirs to mariages.
but notwithsto~+dinge the necessite of worthymen was releuyd by the se+nate.
And they vsyd customablye to preferre the dough+tyrs of them to worshipfull mariages. and saint augustyn Epistola quinta.
That thei that wisely aduertith and attendith say that it was more to be sorowyd wha~
For in pouertye the integrite of all goode maners was conseruyd.
Richesse corruptyth the mynde of man worse than any other enymye. wherof it is red that the hoste of alexander was enrychid owte of nombir whan Darye was deuicte breuely aftir whan they shulde fight agayne thei of alexandirs hoste were ouercome.
which whan alexandir vnderstode he commaundyd immediatly al tho goodes to be brente that his hooste had gotyn by spolyacyon sayde.
As longe as my people had no possession of goodes ther was noon that myght resiste them.
But now that they be and chargyd with gold and syluer they be made slowghtfull and vnlusty and whan tho goodes were brent and goone they fawghte and were manlye as they were before.
Also it is redde of the Ro+maynes that in olde tymes they warryd to gete worshippe.
To haue lybertye for conseruacyon of the comyn wele and than they obtaynyd and had the bettyr at all tymes But whan ther myndes were infecte with couetyse and auarice then were they continually victe and ouercome.

and all be it so that in the Salama~+dre remaynyth greate strengthe of poyson she ys+etyn of some Beastys and takyn for a foode.
This sayde beaste Salamandre oonly and no mo lyuyth in ye
fire as saith Plinius and putteth owte both the fire and the flame it is the kynde of a Salamandre to be rowgh full of curlyd herys lyke a see calf.
Of whose skynne somtyme is made gyrdyllys for kynges to were.
For wha~ they haue be longe worne then caste in to the fire they wyl not burne but aftir they haue lye longe in the fyre they be clene newly pourgid be new+lye drawyn from the fire as though they were repayrid of newe. of the same skynne be made macchis yn lampes yt wyll not waste for no brinnynge.
Hydrus is a poysonde Serpent that leuith in the watyrs hauing .v+heedis.
The twey serpentis fawght togider but whan the Salamandre was ouercome of the Hydre she lepte in to the fire to escape.
Whan the hydre had the worse and was almooste scomfighte of the Salamandre he fledde in to the watirs.
And so they conseruyd them self from deth and sayde.
He that retournyth to his owne naturall place Shal be defendyd and fynde greate solace.
THus owe we to diffende owre self whan we be temptyd of owr goostly enymyes.
We shul+de manlye resiste and caste owr self in to the watirs of Chastite and clennesse.
Whan we be impugnyd of the watirs of couetyse and auaryce.
We owe to lepe in to ye fire of charite and largesse by example of the downe.
For it is redde in the propirte of byrdes that there be some Goshawkys that take no byrdes but oonly in the eyre And some ther be that take noon but oonly in the londe.
And naturally the downe knowith that. ther+fore she flyeth fro the Goshawke that cachith her in
the ayre and descendith in to the londe If she be purse+wyd of the hawke that rauyssheth on the londe she co~+tinuith and bydith styll in the ayre.
Suche reason shul+de we haue agayne the Goshawke of hell which hath a M. wyles to hurte wherof Paulyne saith.
Our ene+my to whom is knowen a M. dyuerse wayes of noyin+ge shulde be defendyd with soo many diuerse wepyns as he ordeynyth sotylteys.
And therfore whan myn enymye pursewith me hauinge so many disceytes.
mu+ste by Goddys grace ordeyne a M. dyuerse wayes to with stonde him.
It is told yt a demoniak was brought to an holy man which commawndyd the feende to come forth and tell hym his name and he answerde and sayde.
We be thre fendes that dwell in this man am callyd the closer of the harte My secounde brodyr is callyd the closer of the mowth and the thrid is callyd closer of the purse Myn office is to indurate the harte of the synner that he may haue no contricyon and if he be contrite my brodyr labowrith to kepe him from con+fession.
And though he be confessyd my thrid brodir wil suffre him do no satisfaccyon And thus my thrid brodir is namyd closer of the purse.
And by these meanys we preuayle agayne moche people Of the Ape and a beaste callyd Taxus. and in Englyssh a Brocke.
[Figure: OF Taxus the here is harshe rough and is a beaste to the quantite of a fox Of this beaste spekith plinius. .viii .cap .xxxix. and saith whan doggis fo+lowe him he restraynyth and kepith in his winde and his breth and soo he cawsith his skynne to be blowyn and straynyd and be that meane he defendyth the bytynge of doggis and fe+lyth not the strokes of men.
This beast hatith the foxe and hath a custome to fighte agayne him.
But the sub+tyll foxe seynge that he cowde not hurte this brocke for his harde skynne and rowgh here she faynyd her self to be venquyssyd and victe and of subtylte fledde and ran a waye. and while this Taxus this brocke or gray sawghte for his praye.
The false foxe entryd in to hys closette and shamefully defylyd the lodgynge of this graye with pysse and other vnclene thinges.
In someche that he abhorryd to come home and vtterly forsoke
his howsolde and chose him an other lytell mansyo~ for his ease a greate waye thens.
If he lacke mete in ye wintyr he wyll sleape for his dyner for it is a beaste yt leuith moche by sleape .vnto this brocke came an ape and sayde.
For haue affeccyon to goo beyonde the see to marchandise and shall trulye deuyde the lucre betwene the and me.
For all my desire is to lyue easyly. wherfor thou shalt haue thy desire yf thou canste fynde me sufficient suretye and make me an instrumente by the hondes of a notarye.
The ape founde sureteys the bugle and the bull and lefte the oblygacyon in kepinge of the horse and went forth on his iourney and neuir came home agayne.
Taxus this brocke seynge that he was thus illudyd of the ape. he askyd his goode of the sureteys.
Wherfore this beaste complaynyd to the iuge and shewyd hym his obligacion.
The iuge immediatly cyted the creditowris and gaue sentence that they shulde restore the goodes accordinge to ther bonde.
Wherfore they were greatly wroth and euer malygnyd agayne the brocke and pursewyd him.
And at the laste they toke him and wowndyd him sore with many a greate stroke whan he was so woundyd he sayde with greate lamentacion and mourninge.
He that can beware of him that wolde borowe Is euyr owte of stryfe and kepte fro moche sorowe
OFtyntymes it happith that a man lesith his fre~+des whan he askyth his owne goodes that he hath lente.
He is a iocounde man that she with mercye and lendith.
That is to meane ther shulde be a discrecyon in the gyuer and lendar it is tolde in fablys that a doo beynge greate with fawne ca+me to an othir doo that had an hows and withe swete woordes.
Fayre prayers and lamentacion she askyd lod+gynge and desyred hows rome for the tyme of her nede permyttynge that she shulde delyuer the hows to the ownar whan she had fawnyd.
The other was mercyfull and departyd and suffirde her to haue the rome.
And aftir a longe season whan the iubardy was paste The ownar retowrnyd and repetyd his right.
The other lockyd faste the durrys and closyd her erys and wolde not delyuer that she promysyd.
For the teth of my children shal al to rent ye.
Wherfor by this fable a man is tawghte that he shulde not alwaye crede~+ce to hastyly to swete woordes.
As Isope tellyth wyllynge to shewe that nothinge maye profite vnto bad folke whan the shrewyd mynde of them is notte a shamyd to be vnremembryd of a good dede.
Wherfore he tellyth that the wolf was acloyed in the throte and almoste chokyd with a boone of a lambe that he had deuowryd which stacke faste in his throte ouirthwarte.
Wherfore in all possible haste he sent to the crane that he with his longe byll shulde drawe it owt.
The bone owt drawyn fro the throte of the wolf by the meanys of the cra+ne he askyd his rewarde which the wolf had promysed
Thou vnhappy creature lyuest not thow by the gyft of me myght not with oon bytte haue bytte a sonder thy necke.

The wesyl was greuyd with the de+alynge of the catte and enuyed at him greatlye.
Vppon a tyme the mows offendyd and the Catte dyd dew cor+reccyon.
Wherwith the mows was greuyd and went to the wesyll and sayde whan he had done dewe salutacyon.
Myne offencys be grete and am veryly wor+thy to be punyshed.
For haue bene agayne the vnder proteccyon of the catte.
And thus subtelly he sowid dis+corde betwene the catte and the wesyll whan he was iustely punyshed of eyther of them.
At last he browght them to that pointe that vtterly they intendyd eche to kyll other.
and as they were goynge promptely to batel the wesyll spake and sayde.
Why shulde oon of vs sle the other by the meanys of the false mows.
Bettir it is and lesse hurte for vs to kyll him than to kyll owrself.
These wordes plesyd well the catte and they both togider kylled the mows and ete him meryly betwene them and sayde They that make Rancowre discorde or debate Shal not be vnpunyshed erly or late.

Olde fadirs louid no suche glosers dowble tongyd folkys for in them was magnificence and strength for to saye the trowth in all ther spechis as Valery tellyth libro sexto.
That whan all the people hopyd vppon the deth of the tyraunte Dyonyse for ye excedinge bytternesse of his moost cruell maners a wo+man of the grettest age prayde the goddis yt he mighte continewe longe in lyfe without sykenes or disease whan the sayde Tyrawnte knewe it he maruaylyd herbenyuolence withowt his deseruinge and Callyd her and inqueryd what rewarde she had receyuyd of him so to saye.
For a reason that haue prouyd by experience before tyme.
For wha~ was a mayde and had a greuous tyraunte.
and whan he was slayne a worse occupied his rome and then his dominacyon to be endyd desired moost feruently.
a worse rular than thou art we kepe neuer to haue. therfor drede if thow were take fro~ vs. a worse yf it be possible shulde succede in to thy place.
Olde philosophirs also had leuyr dye for saynge trowthe then to lyue and hyde it. wherfore of Dyogene it is tolde that he was shewynge trowthe in euery place.
Of whom Valery spekith .iiii .ca .iii. that whan aristipus had sayde to the forsayde Diogene yt stoode wasshyd wortys.
Dyogene if thou haddiste pleasyd yt tyra~te dyonyse with thi fayre woordes thou shuldist not haue nedyd th{us} to do truly quod he yf thou woldist
do thus thou shuldist not haue nede to flater ye sayd ty+raunte.
For this philosofre had moche leuyr to be fedde and maynteynyd with a messe of wortys say trouth then to be fed with ye kynges deyntis and to flater him or say to him other then trowth.
[Figure: FIue Lambys ther were in nombyr yt were forsakyn both of fader and moder and lefte lyke pupyllis and orphanys were rulyd and gydyd of ther kynsmen and tutowris vp+pon a tyme the wolf callyd oon of these lambys secretly to him and sayde.
Wherfor wyll delyuer to the my lettirs of proteccyon that thow mayst goo sawf.
Neuertheles+se first goo to thi bredren and bydde them come to me with the to conferme this matere.
This innocente lam was reioycid with grete gladnesse went to his bredre~ and shewyd vnto them all this mater.
But go we first to our frendes and tutowris and desire ther counsell. whan they came to them.
Ther tutowris answerde sayde Beware for god sake of suche a mastir.
For and yf ye go and return to him he wil destroye yow and kyll you But they not takinge hede of the holsome consel of ther senyours went forth to the wolf.
The cruel wolf them was very glad and lepte amonge them kyl+led them euery chone and fedde him self and his childre~ and sayde.
THerfore we muste gyue credence to the counsell of our senyours.
Iob· .in agyd folkys is great wysdome and prudence in longe tyme. we shulde do aftir counsell and especyally of our frendes.
For it is sayde prouer .iii. Kepe thow the lawe and good counsell and lyfe shal be geuyn vnto thi sowle and grace vnto thy chekys.
It is sayde that an husbondman labowryd his londe and sew it with hem+pe.
Swalowe that was olde and wise seynge that callyd all othir byrdes togider sayde.
For in tyme comynge hereof shal be made many a com+berows nette.
Therfore go we all togider and spurn it a broode or euir it growe or come vp.
But all othr byr+des wolde not consente but repreuyd the swalowe and
sayde she was full of folyssh drede Vppe grewe this er+be and the swalowe warnyd them agayne that greate parell yt approchid and drew nere.
This swalowe pleasith men and flaterith them with his songe.
This hempe was full growyn and mowe downe and dyuers nettis were made of it and cawght many a byrde.
Then all the bir+des knewe ther fawte and repentyd them whan ther was no remedye.
Therfore he that despiseth profitable cownsell oftyntymes takith vnprofitable and he that thinkith him self to sure fallith oftyntymes in to snarys.
And many tymes the cownsell of a vyle persone is very goode aed profitable for wysdome vaylyth mo+re then strength.
For an example it is wrytten that the Egle fleynge in the eyre and seynge the snayle puttinge owte his hornis.
She descendyd and caught her and helde her styll in her cleys.
And the snayle shrank in to the shell so that the Egle in no wyse cowde ete of her.
Thowghe thow be myghty and kynge of all byrdes thou knowist not all thinge.
Harke surely therfore what saye and doo by my counsell for that in the shell is very good me+te and delycyows.
Bere the shell vp an highe and let it fall and breke and so she dyd and fownde grete swet+tenesse.
THe Crepynge beastis and wormys vppon the erthe toke ther solace agayne the sonne.
But ye moost venymows beaste of all and most perylowse Serpente Basiliscus of whom is made mencyon in the dialogo .xli. lepte in amonge
[Figure: all other and sayde with lowde voyce Who is so bolde that dare fight with me let him come and shal fight with hi~.
The snayle in his cotearmure cam in among all othir redy to fighte agayne this serpente.
But she wysely drewe in her hede fete in to the shell that the serpente cowde not towche her and aftirwarde whe~ she espyed auauntage she put owt her hornys and cleys and pricked this serpent.
lytell space aftir this forsayde ser+pent basiliscus fortified him self and thowghte to excuse him self of yt he had bene shamefully ouircom and sayde wil auenge me.
Wherfor yf ther be any amonge all yow yt is so bolde to fighte shal make him glad+ly to turn his backe fle.
The Irchyn full of spinis heringe this came forthe in his harneys towarde Batell.
And whan this forsayde Serpente sawe him with greate malyce he came agayne him.
Irchyn was harty and made sharpe her prickis smote them in to the serpent and wowndyd him vnto the effusyon of his bloode.
Emong all other a frogge beholdinge this and thoughte to be auengid vpon the ser+pente he vppon him willinge to kyll him.
The serpent seynge the frogge all nakyd and bare without defence and he him self was both wery and hungrye to strength his body he cawght the frogge and swalowyd her in and sayde.
He fightith but faintely that is not arayde And he that hath noon harneys may euer be afrayde
By this we bet awght yt whan we see our greate enymyes somwhat ouerthrowyn we owe not sodeynlye to fall vpo~ them but to refrayne to see the ende.
It is properlye the condi+cyon of a wyseman to drede his enymye though he be but weke.
And therfore noman shulde reioyce the deth of his enymye for dowghte of him self.
Whan thyn enymye hath had a fall be thou not glad therof.
Nor be thow mery vpon the deth of thyn enymye leste ther fall lyke iubardye vppon the For he that gretely reioycith vppon the losse or hurte of his enymye shall fal oftyn in to losse and hurts It is redde that an Emperowre had tway seruauntis of which oon was a taylowre and the other was a barboure.
The taylowre hatyd the barbowre for cawse the emperour had him more in fauowre.
Wherfor he ac+cusyd him to the Emperour that he shulde diffame hi~ and saye that he might not suffir the stench of his breth whan he shauyd him.
The Emperowr was sore greuyd and commawndyd him to be caste in to the see in a sacke.
poyntynge to the shippemen the place where they shul+de cast him his signette of golde fel from his finger in to the see.
This barbowre corruptid the shipmen with money and by them he was conueyed to farre contreys and straunge nacyons. wher as he leuyd prosperowsly And vppon a daye he bought a fissh and fonde the emperowrs ringe in the bely of the same fissh with the which ringe he came to the Emperowr and gaue it to him excusynge him self of the cryme that was obiecte agayne him.
And at the laste for a rewarde he desyred that the taylowre that had ioyed of his deth myght be cast in to that same place of iubardye that he was and so he escapyd. and his enymye was destroyed that hoo+pid he had destroyed him.

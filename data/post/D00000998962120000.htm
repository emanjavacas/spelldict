his majesties resolution concerning the spanish embassadors request with the parliaments determination therein
when the king was pleased to acquaint both houses with the desire of the french and spanish embassadors to transport forces out of england ireland his majesty did withall gratiously expresse his resolution not to consent to those desires without the consent of his parliament
both houses have searcht their journals and find by them that not only they never made any expression of such a consent as they can make no such but by order but that both houses have by vote declared their opinion to the contrary and have inclosed the copy of their votes
that the parliament cannot but wonder that any person should presume to informe his majesty that they had made any such expression having made no such vote which they conceive to be destructive to their proceedings and contrary to the priviledges of parliament
and this being the state of the matter of fact the parliament doth no lesse wonder conceives it a high injury to them that the spanish embassadors should offer a complaint of them to his majesty for doing of that which his majesty having referred the consideration of the embassadors desires to parliament they could not but doe without manifest breach of their dutyes as councellors in this his majesties great councell of parliament for the reasons following

that the want in which forraign states stand of men is such that great use may be made of them by his majesty advantagious conditions had for them in the making or strengthening of alliances abroad as his affaires and reason of state may require which will be lost as to so many and we feare as to more which under colour of these may bee transported if these men should be thus parted with


that the breeding of irish papists in a forraign war may get danger to that kingdome and trouble to this especially serving under the king of spain there being already in his dominions and in his armyes principall fugitives of that nation that in greater commands over a military of the same

that his majesty having sent an extraordinary embassador to ratisbone to demand that in this present dyer justice be done to the electorall house by the house of austria and likewise publisht a manifest by advise of parliament declaring that if this be not done by them with whom how the interests of spaine are involved interwoven is evident to all men his majesty will imploy all such power wherewith god hath enabled him both by his owne arms the assistance of all his allyes to vindicate his honour the parliament conceives that before answer be made to this so just demand it is neither safe nor honourable for his majesty to furnish that prince with forces which may be a disheartning to the protestant party abroad a weakning to his majesty and a strength to his enemyes in case justice be not done to the electorall house which they conceive to have the more cause to doubt by reason of the publication in print of the late generall manifesty to the inclusion of the prince palatine

a ready was to prevent bribery and to make good the prince of orange's declaration humbly presented to the honorable convention
by a lover of his country
the use of the being a sure way to prevent bribery and to make every man give his vote according to the best of his judgment because he can get nothing by doing otherwise no man can sell his vote when it cannot be known how he gives it
that this is necessary to be considered at this time do but remember what hath been the constant practice here in england of our court city country and parliament house
we will here only set down in a few lines somewhat of the practick part for it is used in some cases with more nicety than in others in great councils of state we will mention the most facil here
the electors being assemble in some convenient place as a great hall the doors are shut up and the prime officers who assemble or call together the electors keep the keys till the election be over

the chief officer chosen for that purpose takes the and opens it in the view of all the company to see that it is empty and without secret conveyances then placeth it on the table for that purpose at one end of the room and calls such of the company as set next one by one and gives to each a ball in the sight of the people a little ball made of fine linnen as at venice

he puts it into the box either the affirmative or negative and so departs to one side from the rest and then he calls the next and does the like to him and so of the rest till and are called all who have voted stand on one side the room apart by themselves till the voting is over

the box is somewhat long and hath a partition in the middle the which hath two holes to drop the ball in which are broader at the top and narrow at the bottom the hole is for the

affirmative and the left for the negative

and because that no man shall know on which side a man puts his ball who is giving his vote there is a place roundish made in the box to put in the hand and arm almost half way to the elbow so as the hand being in the party may let his ball drop as he pleaseth
when all have done balloting the box is opened and what is in the affirmative noted down
then the next competitor is balloted for as the former and so of the rest and he who hath most votes in the affirmative is elected
all very easily performed as in and other companies and societies both here and some other governments in a short time without noise without tumult without animosities and the most deserving is always endeavoured to be elected

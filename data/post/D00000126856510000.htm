an answer to a letter from a clergyman in the city to his friend in the country containing his reasons for not reading the declaration

with allowance june the

letter

sir

do not wonder at your concern for finding an order of council published in the gazette for reading the king's declaration for liberty of conscience in all churches and chappels in this kingdom
you desire to know my thoughts about it and shall frely tell them for this is not a time to be reserved
our enemies who have given our gracious king this counsel against us have taken the most effectual way not only to ruin us but to make us appear the instruments of our own ruin that what course soever we take we shall be undone and one side or other will conclude that we have undone our selves and fall like fools

answer

they who had formerly heard the frequent sermons upon loyalty preach'd over tea coffee at sam would hardly then have believ'd that ever any clergyman of london of that stamp would have been seen in publick pickeering against the orders of his prince especially issued forth after mature debate in council
know not kow he can boast such a vast

stock of loyalty as this gentleman pretends to when he shall be so homely as to tax the king with following council to the ruin of his subjects
so that the business of this pamphlet is to render his majesty a person that follows ill counsel to the ruin of the church of england party
nor is it to be question'd but that this single clergyman speaks the sense of many more or at least would have many more believe what he does
that what course soever they take they shall be undone
and yet we find that his majesty has publickly declar'd it to be his aim to fix his government upon such a foundation as may make his subjects happy in the injoyment of their religion with freedom of exercise and their property without invasion
however this loyal town clergyman is an infidel that will give no credit at all to the solemn attestations of the king in this particular
nay he will have it that both the one and the other side will conclude that they have undon themselves and fall like fools that is to say should they have read the declaration in their churches according to the order of council
by which it is apparant that the church of england men have a very bad opinion not only of the declaration but of the very design and meaning of it as if it were fram'd to draw them first into inconvenience and then to undo them
for says he

letter

to lose our livings and preferments nay our liberties and lives in a plain and direct opposition to popery as suppose for refusing to read mass in our churches or to swear to the trent is an honourable way of falling and has the divine comforts of suffering for christ and his religion and hope there is none of us but can chearfully submit to the will of god in it
but this is not our present case to read the declaration is not to read the mass nor to profess the romish faith and therefore some will judg that there is no hurt in reading it and that to suffer for such a refusal is not to fall like confessors but to suffer as criminals for disobeying the lawful commands of our prince but yet we judge and we have the concurring opinions of all the nobility and gentry with us who have already suffered in this cause that to take away the test and penal laws at this time is but one stop from the introducing of popery and therefore to read such a declaration in our churches though it do not immediatly bring popery in yet it sets open our church doors for it and then it will take its own time to enter

so that should we comply with this order all good protestants would despise and hate us and then we may be easily crushed and shall soon fall with great dishonour and without any pity
this is the difficulty of our case we shall be censur'd on both sides but with this difference we shall fall a little sooner by not reading the declaration if our gracious prince resent this as an act of an obstinate and peevish or factious disobedience as our enemies will be sure to represent it to him we shall as certainly fall and not long after if we do read it and then we shall fall unpitied and despised and it may be with the curses of the nation whom we have ruined by our complyance and this is the way never to rise more and may suffer all that can be suffered in this world rather than contribute to the final ruin of the best church in the world

answer

here is a very plausible harangue built upon the bare supposition of a single town clergyman while he refuses to read the declaration which is the very act of his majesties grace and favour that secures him from all those fears and jealousies which he labours to instill into the people
nor is it to be thought that men of reason and loyalty will as the city clergyman seems to be convinc'd so readily believe that the king and his council sit to impose dilemma's upon the subject
we shall fall if we do and we shall fall if we do not read it
but this is only the clergyman's supposal on the other side the refusal to read it is an unquestionable act of disobedience to the command of the soveraign authority than which there cannot be a greater mark of that disloyalty which the clergy of the establish'd religion of much disown
besides that it is a disobedience to the orders of the church it self which injoyns her ministers to read during the time of divine service whatever is injoyned by the king
but says he the reading such a declaration in our churches though it do not immediately bring in popery yet it sets open our church doors for it and then it will take its own time to enter
but says the declaration in the first place we do declare that we will protect and maintain our archbishops bishops and clergy and all other our subjects of the church of england in the free exercise of their religion as by law establish'd and in the full injoyment of all their possessions without any molestation or disturbance whatsoever here is

the word of a king to bar the introducing of popery so much fear'd which if it were sacred as coming from the lips of a crowned head they would have render'd still more solemn by reading it in their churches
and therefore the refusal of it seems to be rather an act of wilful indiscretion than of that religious care and wary zeal to which the city pretends

letter
let us then examine this matter impartially as those who have no mind either to ruine themselves or to ruine the church suppose no minister of the church of england can give his consent to the declaration
let us then consider whether reading the declaration in our churches be not an interpretative consent and will not with great reason be interpreted to be so for first by our law all ministerial offcers are accountable for their actions the authority of superiors though of the king himself cannot justifie inferiour officers much less the ministers of state if they should execute any illegal commands which shews that our law does not look upon the ministers of church or state to be meer machines and tools to be managed wholly by the will of superiours without exercising any act of judgment or reason themselves for then inferiour ministers were no more punishable than the horses are which draw an innocent man to tyburn and if inferiour ministers are punishable then our laws suppose that what we do in obedience to superiours we make our own act by doing it and suppose that signifies our consent in the eye of the law to what we do
it is a maxim in our law that the king can do no wrong and therefore if any wrong be done the crime and guilt is the minister's who does it for the laws are the king's publick will and therefore he is never supposed to command any thing contrary to law nor is any minister who does an illegal action allowed to pretend the king's command and authority for it and yet this is the only reason know why we must not obey a prince against the laws of the land or the laws of god because what we do let the authority be what it will that commands it becomes our own act and we are responsible for it and then as observed before it must imply our own consent

answer

this paragraph runs all along upon a meer begging the question
for it would enforce an argument from a topick that neither

can nor ought to be allowed him besides that it smells very strong of logick as pickeering against the power of princes and insinuating the declaration to be illegal contrary to the laws of god and the land and therefore not to be obey'd
so that a greater presumption certainly could not have enter'd the breast of a of the church of england than thus to question the legality of the king's publick acts
certainly it was never thought unlawful till this gentleman found it out for a king to grant an act of indulgence and a toleration of religion to his subjects
and then again to say the king can do no wrong insinuates that some body has done wrong in advising the order which is a reflexion of too great importance for men of loyal dispositions to scan
if he mean that the order or rather the declaration is contrary to the law of the land that is to say to the penal laws and the law enforcing the test that is absolutely to deny the king's royal power of dispensation which has already render'd them invalid
for he should have first made it out that the penal laws and test were such sacred and inviolable statutes that all things done contrary to them were contrary to justice and equity before he had so slily inferr'd an impossibility of giving his consent to reading the declaration as contrary to the law of the land and the act of a superiour authority nor justifiable by the king himself
but this gentleman did not consider that there is no such stress to be laid upon the sanctimony of the penal laws and that supporting the test
for that the conditions of all humane laws are that the law be honest just possible convenient to time and place and conformable to religion and reason
in every one of which characters the penal laws are deficient if for no other though there are many yet for that very reason alledg'd in his majesties declaration because they discourage and disable his majesties subjects that are well inclin'd and fit to serve him from doing him those services which by the law of nature they are bound to do
but he goes on

letter

secondly the ministers of religion have a greater tye and obligation than this because they have the care and conduct of mens souls and therefore are bound to take care that what they publish in their churches be neither contrary to the laws of the land nor to the good

of the church for the ministers of religion are not lookt upon as common cryers but what they read they are supposed to recommend too though they do no more than read it and therefore to read any thing in the church which do not consent to and approve nay which think prejudicial to religion and the church of god as well as contrary to the laws of the land is to my people and to dissemble with god and men because it is presum'd that neither do nor ought to read any thing in the church which do not in some degree approve

answer

if arrogance and high conceit might pass for arguments here is a fair shew of both for one would think that the head of the church might be as competent a judge of what is fittest to be read in the churches under his protection as the parson of the parish
whoever thinks otherwise must have a very low opinion of the head who takes upon him to be so wise and censorious a member
when the head of the church sends his mandates and injunctions to his inferior ministers reason does in no measure justifie their disputes and oppositions to the inverting the order of nature
and therefore it would have argu'd a much more noble confidence in the truth of his majesties sincerity and piety to have read without boggling the declaration recommended to their publishing in churches which they could not in good manners believe that their soveraign head would have enjoyn'd them had he not it both proper and warrantable
we find the declaration grounded upon the solid foundation of constant royal sense and opinion which no question had the concurrence of many able divines of the first order in the church among whom that learned prelate and famous combatant against the church of rome the of appears to be none of the meanest
so that upon so fair a poise besides the judgement of the king himself the opposit of any other sanhedrim within this nation can never be thoug to be so equal as they pretend in their own cause a cause wherein interest rather than any deep sense of religion seems to carry the greater sway
the declaration duly consider'd and fram'd with mature deliberation is of one judgment but they hand are of another the declaration finding the consciences of the subjects pester'd and incumber'd with penal laws oaths and tests endeavours

to remove those incumbrances
they on the other side strive to uphold the dagons of their animosity against all other opinions but their own
who are now to be the deciders of this controversie who indeed but the soveraign authority in the person of the king who is gods vicegerent and to whom for that very reason unless they will deprive him of that supream dignity all other persons are bound to submit there being no higher tribunal upon earth to give a more authentic determination
and therefore it was that cicers in his oration for cluentius tell us that the supream magistrate is the judge of the laws and the cheif interpreter of the law we only the servants of the law that we may be free
which being so true as it is what must be thought of them that set up an interpretation of their own against the interpretation of the soveraign magistrate but the city clergyman goes on with a very quaint distinction

letter

indeed let mens private opinions be what they will in the nature of the thing he that reads such a declaration to his people teaches them by it
for is not reading teaing suppose then do not consent to what read yet consent to teach my people what read and herein is the evil of it for it may be it were no fault to consent to the declaration but if consent to teach my people what do not consent to my self am sure that is a great one and he who can distinguish between consenting to read the declaration and consenting to teach the people by the declaration when reading the declaration is teaching it has a very subtile distinguishing conscience now if consenting to read the declaration be a consent to teach it my people then the natural interpretation of reading the declaration is that he who reads it in such a solemn approves it if this be not so desire to know why may not read an homily for transubstantiation or invocation of saints or the worship of images if the king sends me such good catholic homilies and commands me to read them and thus we may instrust our people in all the points of popery and recommend it to them with all the sophistry and artificial insinuations in obedience to the king with a very good conscience because without our consent if it be said this would be a contradiction to the doctrine of our church by law established so take the declaration to be and if we may read the declaration

contrary to law because it does not imply our consent to it so we may popish homilies for the bare reading them will not imply our consent no more than the reading the declaration does but whether consent to the doctrine or no it is certain consent to teach my people this doctrine and it is to be considered whether an honest man can do this

answer

the first question here is whether a man that consents to read consents to teach or rather whether teaching and reading be all one certainly no man of reason but will believe the was very hard put to it to lay the stress of a refusal to obey the command of soveraign authority upon a cavill about the signification of a word or two
who could have imagin'd it would ever have been requisite for the council to have consulted a tribunal of grammarians to obviate such an objection as this before they issu'd forth the order for reading the declaration
but whether teaching and reading be all one is nothing here to the purpose for there is not any thing as yet appears in the letter which proves the declaration unlawful to be read which he ought first to have done before he had gone about to split the signification of words to gratifie a conscience therefore squeamish because with the kings favours
for there is no person in england ought to uphold that law which the king condemns if it be not in it self unjust and contrary to the union of mankind
for the introducing of popery into england or the abolishing of any laws that may prevent it if it be the will and pleasure of the soveraign government is no more illegal in it self than it was for the united netherlands to abolish popery and introduce the protestant religion into their dominions contrary to the constitutions of the empire and the laws of spain
so that this moves all this while upon an assertion that the declaration is illegal and contrary to the law of the land
for if the king of england may be depriv'd of his undoubted right of altering repealing or suspending such laws as are inconsistent with those maxims of rule which he proposes at his coming to the crown and which he finds destructive to the greatest part of his subjects he loses one of the greatest advantages which he enjoys to pursue those methods of government

which he deems most proper for the renowning his reign in future history
so much the more hard when the only means which he accounts most proper for his purposes shall be condemn'd for unlawful by a nice splitter of verbal signification
and yet the distinction of reading and consenting is not so difficult as he pretends
for consent is an agreement of thoughts as well as words
but a man may read the story of bell and the dragon in the church and yet not agree it to be orthodox
nor can a man by reading be said to teach his people unless he inculcates what he reads by instruction for tho instruction comprehends reading reading does not comprehend instruction
which is the reason there are so many ignorant persons in the world to whom the bible and the creed it self are read every sunday in the year and yet at the years end they are not able to tell ye whose son iesus christ is or who was solomon father
and whereas he says the king might as well command him to read a homily for transubstantiation as the declaration the inference is false the one being an actual invasion upon the articles of the church of england from which the declaration upon the word of a king is the very thing that secures him the other only a civil duty requir'd in obedience to the king's command and the refusal of it only a piece of fineness to render the king's authority and his proceedings suspected to the people

letter
thirdly suppose no man will doubt but the king intends that our reading the declaration should signifie to the nation our consent and approbation of it for the declaration does not want publishing for it is sufficiently known already but our reading it in our churches must serve instead of addresses of thanks which the clergy generally refused tho it was only to thank the king for his gracious promises renewed to the church of england in his declaration which was much more innocent than to publish the declaration it self in our churches this would perswade one that the king thinks our reading the declaration to signifie our consent and that the people will think it to be so
and he that can satisfie his conscience to do an action without consent which the nature of the thing the design and intention of the command and the sense of the people expound to be a consent may think as well satisfie himself with equivocations and mental reservation

answer
here is nothing still but barely repeated supposition together with an open and glory'd in confession of the ingratitude of the generality of the church of england than which he could not certainly have bestow'd a worse character either upon himself or his friends
since it was an obstinate ingratitude that no renewances of the king's favours could reconcile to him as proceeding from a sowre disgust that his majesty had granted to others the same liberty which they enjoy'd
as if all mankind besides them were bound to groan under the continual yoak of their penal laws and tests no less rigorous and uncharitable
to the remainder of this part the gentleman has form'd a very substantial answer of himself
or says he

letter
there are two things to be answered to this which must be considered

that the people understand our minds and see that this is matter of force upon us and meer obedience to the king

answer
then the refusal was a work of supererogation the people being better instructed than all their reading could teach them and then they must fall that way by going about to instruct them by their obstinacy who were of opinion that their obedience would have been a far better admonishment
to which he answers

letter

that possibly the people do understand that the matter of the declaration is against our principles but is this any excuse that we read that and by reading recommend that to them which is against our own consciences and iudgments reading the declaration would be no fault at all but our duty when the king commands it did we approve of the matter of it but to censent to teach our people such doctrines as we think contrary to the laws of god or the laws of the land does not lessen but aggravate the fault and people must be very good natur'd to think this an excuse


it is not likely that all the people will be of a mind in this matter some may excuse it others and those it may be the most the best and the wisest man will condemn us for it and then how shall we justifie our selves against their censures when the world will be divided in their opinions the plain way is certainly the best to do what we can justifie ourselves and then let men judge as they please
no men in england will

be pleased with our reading the declaration but those who hope to make great advantage of it against us and against our church religion· others will severely condemn us for it censure us as false to our religion and as betrayers both of church and state and besides that it does not become a minister of religion to do any thing which in the opinion of the most charitable men can only be excused for what needs an excuse is either a fault or looks very like one besides this say will not trust mens charity· those who have suffered themselves in this cause will not excuse us for fear of suffering those who are inclined to excuse us now will not do so when they consider the thing better and come to feel the ill consequences of it when our enemies open their eyes tell them what our reading the declaration signified which they will then tell us we ought to have seen before tho they were not bound to see it for we are to guide and instruct them not they us

answer
tempora mutantur nos mutamur in illis was when there was nothing more abominable more hainous or more cry'd down by the gowned clergy of england than vox populi now vox populi is the only suprema that guides them they have no other fears than of the condemnations and censures of vox populi vox populi is vox dei and they dare not read the king's declaration for fear of vox populi and all this out of an infallible certainty that no people in england will be pleased with their reading the declaration but their enemies
more than this they see ill consequences in the declaration and find doctrines in the declaration contrary to the laws of god and the land invisible however to all those vast numbers of lowd and thankful addresters for the publishing of it
synxes in their own concerns but such as car'd so little for the voice of the people that they never melted at the groans of the people when they had the scourge in their hands

letter

ii
others therefore think that when we read the declaration we should publickly profess that it is not our own judgment but that we only read it in obedience to the king and then our reading it cannot imply our consent to it now this is only protestatio contra factum which all people will laugh at and scorn us for for such a solemn reading it in the time of divine service when all men ought to be most grave and serious and for from dissembling with god or men does in the nature of the thing imply our approbation and should we declare the contrary when we read it what shall we say to those who ask us why then do you read it but let those who have a mind try this way which for my part take to be a greater and more unjustifiable

provocation of the king than not to read it and suppose those who do not read it will be thought plainer and honester men and will escape as well as those who read it and protest against it and yet nothing less than an express protestation against it will salve this matter for only to say they read it meerly in obedience to the king does not express their dissent it signifies indeed that they would not have read it if the king had not commanded it but these words do not signifie that they disapprove of the declaration when their reading it though only in obedience to the king signifies their approbation of it as much as can signifie a consent let us call to mind how it fared with those in king charles the first's reign who read the book of sports as it was called and then preached against it

answer
then it appears that the declaration has been read and that by several gentlemen of the church of england also
so that it appears that the reading of it is not of that dangerous consequence to the conscience as the author of the letter would pretend to
for we are to have that charity for those that read it as for those that refused it that the forme had as much care for their consciences as the latter
now then to what purpose all these terrors and affrights of conscience all this dread of the censures of the people for reading it since the business admits such a positive variety of opinion
the loyal and obedient may read it but the scrupulous and refractory will not
well then if the case be so the city clergyman should have done well to have reserv'd his niceties and slicing of significations to himself and not have gone about so zealously to spread the infection of his scruples to the discouragement of others
but he has past the rubicon and will forward

letter
to return then to our argument if reading the declaration in our churches be in the nature of the action in the intention of the command in the opinion of the people an interpretative consent to it think my self bound in conscience not to read it because am bound in conscience not to approve it

answer
to this the loyal gentlemen that read it reply that if reading the declaration in their churches be neither in the nature of the action nor in the intention of the command nor in the opinion of the people an interpretative consent to it they think themselves bound in conscience to read it because they are bound in conscience to approve it
but says he

letter
it is against the constitution of the church of england which is established by law and to which have subscribed and therefore am bound in conscience to teach nothing contrary to it while this obligation lasts

answer
he must of necessity allow the constitution of the church of england to be a strange uncharitable constition that will not allow liberty of conscience to any but it self
and it is his misfortune that he has subscribed to a church that wants the bond of perfection which is the reason that many believes he mistakes the constitution of the church of england

letter
it is to teach an vnlimited and vniversal toleration which the parliament in
declared illegal and which has been condemned by the christian church in all ages

answer
what the parliament declared in signifies nothing against the authority of the scripture which all along declares the contrary
and whereas the gentleman is pleased to say that universal toleration has been condemned by the christian church in all ages there is nothing more contrary to the infinite sayings of the primitive fathers and their successors and that celebrated maxim of tertullian religionis non est religionem cogere

letter
it is to teach my people that they need never come to church more but have my free leave as they have the king's to go to a conventicle or to mass

answer
this is like cardinal wolsey ego rex his leave and the king's
but they are a sorry sort of people that do not know already that a rector of a parish is no sovereign but that the people may come and go where they please without his leave

letter
it is to teach the dispensing power which alters what has been formerly thought the whole constitution of this church and kingdom which we dare not do till we have the authority of parliament for it

answer

it seems the king's authority signifies nothing with this city clergyman
but if he had the authority of parliament for it he would stretch his conscience and read the declaration
in the mean time the king's dispensive power is no business for a man in his station to meddle with nor is he to be such a judge of royal declarations as to be the interpreter of their meaning or intention
that power is not within the verge of his desk or pulpit either neither can the

authority of parliament warrant any such boldness among ecclesiasticks

letter
it is to recommend to our people the choice of such persons to sit its parliament as shall take away the test and penal laws which most of the nobility and gentry of the nation have declared their iudgment against

answer
then not to read the declaration is to recommend to the people the choice of such persons as shall not take away the test and penal laws as if the peoples election of parliament men depended upon the recommendation of the
but the declaration requires no such officious recommendation from them and therefore the gentleman might have spared his complement to the nobility and gentry

letter
it is to condemn all those great and worthy patriots of their country who forfeited the dearest thing in the world to them next a good conscience viz
the favour of their prince and a great many honourable and profitable imployments with it rather than consent to that proposal of taking away the test and penal laws which they apprehend destructive to the church of england and the protestant religion and he who can in conscience do all this think need scruple nothing

answer
the nobility and gentry are mightily beholding to the for his kind encomiums but whether they would have thought it any condemnation of their resolutions in reference to the penal laws and test is uncertain for the nobility and gentry do not depend upon this gentleman's divinity their motions and the circumstances that guide their actions being of a higher nature than to care for the condemnation of their chaplains
however if the nobility and gentry were so kind to do what they did for their sakes the has ill retaliated their favour to lay the load of his actual disobedience upon the shoulders of the nobility and gentry of the nation
but now he's come to his effects and ill consequences for says he

letter
for let us consider further what the effects and consequences of our reading the declaration are likely to be and think they are matter of conscience too when they are evident and apparent
this will certainly render our persons and ministry infinitely contemptible which is against that apostolick canon let no man despise thee tit

that is so to behave himself in his ministerial office as not to fall under contempt and therefore this obliges the conscience not to make our selves ridiculous nor to render our ministry our counsels exhortations preaching writing of no effect which is a thousand times worse than being silenced our sufferings will preach more effectually to the people when we cannot speak to them but he who for fear or cowardize or the love of this world betrays his church and religion by undue compliances and will certainly be thought to do so may continue to preach but to no purpose and when we have rendred our selves ridiculous and contemptible we shall then quickly fall and fall unpitied

answer

he is now wrapt up in the spirit of prophesie what strange things will befal him for reading the declaration which he calls a betraying the church by undue complyances but the prophet mistakes the points that renders the ministerial office he means ridiculous for while they keep to the business of sound doctrine and meerly true divinity there is not a more profound or learned clergy in the world than are they of the church of england but when they will be studying the points of royal declarations which are acts of state will be making their pulpits the stages of farce and satyr will be interloping and intruding into state affairs which nothing at all concern them when they will be teaching the king the judges deputy lieutenants and all other magistrates their duties this is that which renders the ministry before mentioned or any ministry in the world ridiculous
and it is to be feared the has not altogether freed himself from that contempt in calling the reading of the declaration a betraying of the church by undue complyances and then complementing the nobility and gentry of the nation to justifie his ridiculous language and all this to gain popularity or to preserve the possession of his living under

the name of the protestant religion for he must not take it amiss that others dive with the same severity into his meaning as he dives into the king's intentions

letter
there is nothing will so effectually tend to the final ruin of the church of england because our reading the declaration will discourage or provoke or misguide all the friends the church of england has can we blame any man for not preserving the laws and the religion of our church and nation when we our selves will venture nothing for it can we blame any man for consenting to repeal the test and penal laws when we recommend it to them by reading the declaration have we not reason to expect that the nobility and gentry who have already suffered in this cause when they hear themselves condemned for it in all the churches of england will think it time to mend such a fault and reconcile themselves to their prince and if our church fall this way is there any reason to expect that it should ever rise again these consequences are almost as evident as demonstrations and let it be what it will in it self which foresee will destroy the church of england and the protestant region and interest think ought to make as much conscience of doing it as of doing the most immoral action in nature

answer

here we find him talking as if the final ruine of the church of england lay upon the church of england reading or not reading the declaration and that by not reading it they had saved the palladium and ancilia of their religion
and all these rodomontado's upon bare suppositions and imaginations no ways compatible to reason for it is not rational to believe that the nobility and gentlemen of england when they delivered their sentiments contrary to what was proposed to them concerning the test for as to the penal laws tis well known their judgments are much more remiss did what they did for fear of being condemned by the levites whom they feed
tis therefore a presumption in the to arrogate in the plural number such a power over the nobility and gentry as if they were bound to justifie his and his friend's particular acts of disobedience

and could not be safe in their resolutions unless they were obstinate
what was proposed to the nobility and gentry was one thing what was commanded them was another and there is a great difference between not consenting to a proposal and not submitting to a sovereign command

letter
to say that these mischievous consequences are not absolutely necessary and therefore do not affect the conscience because we are not certain they will follow is a very mean objection
moral actions indeed have not such necessary consequences as natural causes have necessary effects because no moral causes act necessarily
reading the declaration will not as necessarily destroy the church of england as fire burns wood but if the consequence be plain and evident the most likely thing that can happen if it be unreasonable to expect any other if it be what is plainly intended and designed either must never have any regard to moral consequences of my actions or if ever they are to be consider'd they are in this case

why are the nobility and gentry so extremely averse to the repeal of the test and penal laws why do they forfeit the king's favour and their honourable stations rather than comply with it if you say that this tends to destroy the church of england and the protestant religion ask whether this be the necessary consequence of it whether the king cannot keep his promise to the church of england if the test and penal laws be repealed we cannot say but this may be and yet the nation does not think fit to try it and we commend those great men who deny it and if the same questions were put to us we think we ought in conscience to deny them our selves and are there not as high probabilities that our reading the declaration will promote the repeal of the test and penal laws as that such a repeal will ruine our constitution and bring in popery upon us is it not as probable that such a complyance in us will disoblige all the nobility and gentry who have hitherto been firm to us as that when the power of the nation is put into popish hands by the repeal of such tests and laws the priests and iesuites may find some salvo for the kings conscience and persuade him to forget his promise to the church of england and if the probable ill consequences of repealing the test and penal laws be a good reason not to comply with it cannot see but that the as

probable ill consequences of reading the declaration is as good a reason not to read it

answer
these are all meer comments and descants of the upon the honour and conscience of his majesty and the evil design of the declaration upon the church of england drawn from probabilities of the evil consequences of repealing the penal laws and test which the church of england must no more part with then the iews with their ark without exposing themselves to utter ruine and destruction
for the charitable clergyman takes no care of any other part of the protestant religion so the church of england be secure
to all which if he would have but vouchsaf'd to have read the declaration he might have found an answer shining fully out and dispelling all the fogs and mists of his probable consequences in his majesty's own words where he declares a second time that ever since his granting the indulgence he has made it his principal care to see it preserved without distinction and farther adds his resolutions to use his utmost endeavours to establish liberty of conscience on such just and equal foundations as will render it unalterable and seoure to all people the free exercise of their religion for ever
but this will not serve the turn he must have the rains of temporal as well as ecclesiastical jurisdiction in his own hand and drive on for ever or else there is nothing to be done
they are like caesar contemning all superiors and like rompey disdaining all equals
a passionate conceit of their own perfection above all other which no man of common sense can be reconcil'd to and a convincing argument that those persons must have but little or no conscience themselves who with so much vigor and obstinacy labour to uphold a civil persecution of penal laws and tests so directly opposite to all the dictates of conscience and reason

the most material objection is that the dissenters whom we ought not to provoke will expound our not reading it to be the effect of a persecuting spirit now wonder men should lay any weight on this who will not allow the most probable consequences of our actions

to have any influence upon conscience for if we must compare consequences to disoblige all the nobility and gentry by reading it is likely to be much more fatal than to anger the dissenters and it is more likely and there is much more reason for it that one should be offended than the other for the dissenters who are wise and considering are sensible of the snare themselves and though they desire ease and liberty they are not willing to have it with such apparent hazard of church and state am sure that though we were never so desirous that they might have their liberty and when there is opportunity of shewing our inclinations without danger they may find that we are not such persecutors as we are represented yet we cannot consent that they should have it this way which they will find the dearest liberty that ever was granted

answer
after his complements put upon the nobility and gentry of the nation the author of the letter descends to scrape a new acquaintance with the dissenters and fain would draw them into his belief upon a very odd surmise that they are now in some kind of manner reconcil'd
but the complement is at such a remote distance that he betray'd his politicks to court them at such an indifferent rate
and indeed his expressions are so obscure that if this church of england man is so nice that he dare not trust the king upon such clear and solemn promises the dissenters who have had such severe experience of their favours have much less reason to credit the forc'd complement of the
this is only to be wonder'd at that the should make the king so dear a seller of liberty of conscience when there was no price could purchase it from the persecution of the penal his undoubted brethren

letter
this sir is our case in short the difficulties are great on both sides and therefore now if ever we ought to besiege heaven with our prayers for wisdom and counsel and courage that god would protect his church and reformed christianity against all the devices of their enemies which is the daily and hearty prayer of

sir your friend and brother

may


answer
being thus come from his politicks to his prayers tis time to leave him not doubting but if his prayers be just they will be heard if not neither his letter nor his prayers will signifie any thing

postscript
have just now seen care paper called the publick occurrences which came out to day and cannot but set you right as to his news about the reading of the declaration on sunday he tells you that several divines of the church of england in and about the city eminent for their piety and moderation did yesterday read his majesty's late declaration in their churches according to the order in that behalf but some to the great surprize of their parishioners were pleased to decline it
you in the country are from this account to believe that it was read here by the generality of the clergy and by the eminent men among them but can and do assure you that this is one of the most impudent lyes that ever was printed for as to this city which hath above a hundred parishes in it it was read only in four or five churches all the rest and best of the clergy refusing it every where
will spare their names who read it but should mention them it would make you who know this city a little heartily to deride account of them
and for the surprize he talks of the contrary of it is so true that in where it was read by one dr the people generally went out of the church
this tell you that you may be provided for the future against such an impudent lyar who for bread can vouch and put about the nation the falsest of things

am yours

answer
the has given the lye to the author of the publick occurrences it were to be wish'd that the author had nam'd all the rest besides those we already know that were so loyal as to read the declaration
if they were not so numerous as they are said to be in the occurrences we wish they had been as many in number as their loyalty required
but we leave this for the author himself to do himself justice by a more particular answer

BRIEFE DISCOVERIE OF DOCTOR ALlens seditious drifts, contriued in a Pamphlet written by him, Concerning the yeelding vp of the towne of Deuenter, (in Ouerrissel) vnto the king of Spain, by Sir William Stanley.
The contentes whereof are particularly set downe in the page following.
And sawe a woman sit vpon a beast, full of names of blasphemy, which had seiren heades, and ten hornes. and ver.
The seuen heads are seuen mountaines, whereon the woman sitteth.
Thus haue ye made the commandement of God of no authoritie by your traditions.
Woe therefore be vnto you Scribes and Pharisees, Hypocrites, because ye shutvp the kingdome of heauen before men, for ye your selues goe not in, neither suffer ye them that would enter, to come in.
Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheepes cloathing, but inwardly they are rauening woolues.
FIrst, all the arguments brought by D. Allen in his said pa~phlet, for the iustification of the deliuering vp of Deuenter, are particularly discussed, and fully answered: her Maiesties actions in the reliefe and defense of the lowe Countreys, against the king of Spain, by D. Allens owne arguments and assertions, by the authorities of his own autours, proued most iust and lawfull.
Secondly, his malicious mynde and purposes against her Maiestie and the state, are openly displayed together with his cu~ning order, methode, meanes which he vseth to accomplish the same: his sclandrous defamations also of her Maiesties most honorable and princely actions, and of her Ministers countrey, in like sort answered, and retorted: and the Popes autoritie to depose princes vtterly confuted and ouerthrowen by D. Allens owne arguments, and examples of Scripture, which hee him+selfe produceth.
Thirdly, his seditious persuasio~s to her Maiesties liege people, are by the defeating of his arguments and examples (cited to that effect) most forcibly encou~tred: and some grosse errours ouersights in pollicie, escaped him in his pa~flet, manifestly detected.
Lastly, the Subiectes are by example of the Romanists double and irreligious dealing, disswaded from the credit of their doctrine and persuasions, and by the due consideration of their owne dutie, weale, and tranquillitie, exhorted to the due obedience of her Maiestie, maintenance of their own safetie, and defense of their deer Countrey.
THis pamphlet of Doctor Allens, which hath ministred the occasion of this discouerie, is pretended to be written by him in manner of a letter, dated at Rome the
of Aprill, to satisfie the consciences of those English souldiers, which had in Ianuarie before deliuered vp the Cittie of Deuenter vnto the King of Spaine, and reuolted fro~ her Maiestie (their liege Soueraigne) vnto his seruice, that their action therein was both lawfull, honorable, and necessarie, and that all others, especially those of the English nation, that deteine any Townes or other places in the lowe Countreies from the King of Spain, are bound vpon paine of damnation to doe the like: for occasion wherof, there is also prefixed before it, another very short letter, only of three pages, pretended in like sort to bee vvritten to Doctor Allen from Bruxels, the
day of March next fore past, by an English Gentleman, (whom Doctor Allen termeth honorable, vnder the name of R.
A) demaunding his opinion and resolution touching the aforesaid action.
This question and ansvvere being thus compiled in one pamflet, is supposed to be imprinted at Deuenter in the So~mer follovving, of likelihood by the appointment or procureme~t of Sir VVilliam Stanley, as should seeme.
Which comming by hap vnto my hands, and vpon diligent perusing therof, finding nothing in it but meer malice mischiefe, no one iott of sound doctrine or substance, ansvverable to the grauitie and learning of such a [undefined span alphabet] as the autor thereof is esteemed to be: did at the first vtterly contemne and reiect it, as a thing of no account, thinking it neither vvholsom to stirre so foule and stinking a puddle, nor glorious to ouerthrovve so sclender and superficiall a defense.
Yet considering better of the most seditious driftes and deuilish persuasions cunningly conueyed in the argument of this pamflet, vnder the cloak and shadovve of Religion, by meanes of vvhich title it might happly obtaine the more credit, if the fraud vvere not detected, thought it a thing verie necessarie, to discouer and lay open to the vvorld, the slye subtile dealings of D. Allen in this pamflet, together vvith the most absurd, prophane, and impious shifts vsed by him therein, to th'end that no man might either by simplicitie and ignorance, or for affection to him his faction, or through ouermuch credulitie of his doctrine, be seduced by his deceitful abuses impostures, to their ovvn vtter ruine destructio~.
As for the more apposite and perticular ansvvering of this pamflet from point to point throughout, the chiefe questions therein being matters of Diuinitie, not of pollicie, leaue therefore to the further disquisition of the learned Diuines, of vvhom some perhaps vvhe~ this pamflet shall happen to be more publik, and come to their hands, vvill for the quarrels sake, being good iust (though not for the woorth or weight of the thing it selfe) vouchsafe to bestow a litle paines in that argument.
For mine owne parte, being neither of that profession, and hauing also another purpose, it sufficeth me to confute only those arguments, which lye in my waye, to hinder the scope of mine intent, which is only in the behalfe of our countrey, to discouer his pollicies, and encounter his persuasio~s, which tend wholy to the hurt and ouerthrow of our countrey.
The safetie, peace, and prosperitie whereof, whosoeuer respecteth, loueth, and wisheth to continue, as (no doubt) all good, honest, and well affected subiectes doe; let him with iudgement reade this small treatise ensuing, and with reason, and conscience vveighe the abuses therein discouered, and then doubt not but he shalbe thereby stirred vp, to a better Religion tovvards God, a more faithfull obedience tovvardes hir Maiestie, and a more naturall loue of his countrey.
briefe discouerie of Doctor Allens seditious drifts, contriued in a Pamphlet written by him, Concerning the yeelding vp of the Towne of Deuenter (in Ouerissel) vnto the King of Spaine, by Sir W. Stanley.
SInon the subtil Greek, (in whose person the learned Poet pourtraieth out the liuely patterne of a craftie companion) beeing caught by the Troian shepheards, albeit hee came of his owne accord, and put himselfe voluntarily in their way to be taken, vpon purpose to deceiue them with a counterfeit tale, and thereby to betraie them into their enemies handes: yet (the better to colour his intent, and to mooue the Troians to giue the more credit to his talke) neither would he vtter any thing vnto them, but what they by their demands first vrged him vnto: hauing both occasion and encouragement giuen him to speake, yet (the more cunningly to disguise his principall drift) not without a preamble of manie solemne Protestations, he still deferred that to the verie last end of his discourse, which was indeed the first and only purposed ende of his comming.
Whose president Doctor Allen seeming verie rightly to haue imitated, as well in the matter, as in the methode of this his politike Pamphlet, first because he will haue it seeme to proceede of an occasion offered, and not of his owne voluntarie motion, least his intent therin might be suspected, and his worke thereby discredited, frameth a letter to himselfe, in the name of two letters of the Alphabet (his supposed honourable friend) whom hee faineth thereby verie instantly to demand his opinion, touching the lawfulnes of S. W. Stanleys and Captaine Yorkes action, in rendring vp the Towne of Deuenter and Fortes of Zutphen vnto the Duke of Parma: and thereupon taketh occasion in his answere thereunto, to fall (as it were by the way) into a further matter, whereto in truth the whole purpose of his treatie was from the beginning intended.
sorie shift of so cunning a Clerke, in an Apes skin to couer a Foxe, whom euen his verie taile may bewraie.
As though men were so simple, or of so slender iudgement, as that they could not discerne by the stile, the letter and answere to bee both of one stampe.
And, for the chiefe purpose of this Pamphlet, that it tendeth to a farre further end, then to the satisfying of the consciences of S. William Stanley and Capt. Yorke, and other like Romain Catholikes, touching the lawfulnes of the yeelding vp of Deuenter and Zutphen Fortes, if this were not a sufficient argument thereof, that the parties themselues neuer made conscience or question of the matter, either before the yeelding of them, or since, and therefore needed no such resolution as D. Allen will needs intreat himselfe to offer them, which were and are still as resolute as himselfe in disobedience: the verie plaine dealing of D. Allen himselfe generally throughout the whole Pamphlet, but particularly in the latter and greater halfe of it, maketh the thing more then manifest, as shalbe laide open vnto you more at large, when wee come to the particular handeling of that point.
am sorie that should haue such occasion giuen mee, euen in the verie first entrance to vse a comparison so odious and vnbeseeming the name, profession, and calling of such a man as D. Allen is, or should be, as to liken him to one, in whom the verie Prince of Poets emploied his best witte and skill, in liueliest colours, to expresse the true shape and substance of a most subtil and malicious dissembler: for in truth doe naturally and inwardly hate all immodestie, bitternes, and violence of speech, generally in all actions of life and conuersation, and especially in these of controuersie and confutation, where the trueth is to bee defended, not our owne passions displaied, the aduersarie with reason conuinced, not with railing defaced, his sinister and lewde dealings orderly reprooued, not his person in any wise vndece~tly outraged.
But if D. Allen haue in this Pamphlet both in manner and matter so rightlie resembled Sinon, as that hee hath not left mee the choice of anie man to whom may so rightly resemble him, as to Sinon, it is hee himselfe (and not I) that hath made himselfe comparable to Sinon.
Nay, if it appeare further by this Pamphlet, that he hath the verie minde, meaning, intent, and counsell of Sinon, by like solemne protestations and subtill persuasions, vnder colour of Religion to intice you (I meane such as are wholie deuoted to his Religion, or haue been affected to his doctrine, or can be allured by his enchantments) to prostrate and laie open your Countrey, by your armes and assistance, to bring in the Spanish and other forreine forces, to the certaine ruine, destruction, and ouerthrow both of your selues and your Countrey: thinke may lawfully without iust touch of malice or immodestie, bee bold to shew you his shadow in a glasse, that hideth his bodie from you vnder a glosse, and by the example of his doings whom this man so liuely resembleth, laie before your eies the verie marke, which hee so cunninglie aimeth at: to the ende that beeing once warned, you may bee euer armed against his pernicious practises.
But know it will bee a matter of great labour and difficultie for mee to persuade you that are of D. Allens religion, to see or acknowledge anie errour, falshood, or malicious intent in him, because you are alreadie setled in persuasion of his learning, sinceritie, and goodnes of his cause, and carrie the contrarie opinion of mee, because you esteeme mee to bee of a contrarie Religion both to him and your selues.
Albeit my purpose is not particularly either to drawe him into discredit with you, or to withdraw you from the Religion you professe (though could bee content (nay most willing and desirous) to hazarde mine owne life in trauelling to winne you to the true waie of eternall life:) but onelie to laie open his errours and abuses to the worlde indifferentlie, that such as haue eares to heart, maie heare, and such as are not wilfullie blinde maie see, and satisfie themselues accordinglie: yet if either by example or persuasions, maie stirre you vp to the straighter examination of your consciences, and better consideration of the groundes of your religion, togither with more aduised deliberation, how you giue credit to mens counsailes, or enter into their confederacies, and consequentlie into your owne destructions, shall thinke my selfe, of all thinges that euer happened or can happen to mee, most happie in this, that it hath pleased God to make me the meanes of so happie an effect to you.
Of whom will therefore thinke it no skorne to craue euen vpon the knees of my heart, onely that which you ought your selues to yeelde mee of your owne accord, beeing a thing no waie possiblie hurtfull, but likelie manie waies beneficiall vnto you, that is, that you will onelie bee content for a time to laie aside all affection, partialitie, and preiudicate opinion, and to reade with indifferencie, weigh with aduisement, and with vprightnes to iudge of that litle which shall be most faithfullie deliuered vnto you.
will not in truth (neither can if would) denie my selfe to bee of that religion, wherein haue been bred and brought vp euen from mine infancie, that is, the true ancient, Catholike, and Apostolike religion professed in the Church of England, which the Romanists do so much impugne, and so earnestlie endeuour to supplant.
But as doe confesse my selfe most stedfastlie to holde that Religion, and therein to stand fullie resolued: so do vnfainedlie protest, that since came to the yeares of reason and discretion to conceiue what Religion was, neuer held anie opinion obstinatelie, as one that beeing in an errour should hate to bee reformed, but came first to the reading and consideration of those thinges which it behooued a Christian to know, euen with a bare and naked minde, voide of all foredeeming, and apt to receiue anie impression, onelie humble and desirous to bee instructed in the trueth: and whatsoeuer read or heard expounded out of the holie Scriptures, neither did esteeme it by the credit of the person that taught it, but by the authoritie of the doctrine it selfe, neither was led vnto anie opinion by the voice or opinion of multitude, but by the testimonie of mine owne conscience consenting thereunto, neither did attribute the more credit to it, for that it was first taught mee, but for that dailie instruction and reason confirmed it vnto mee: neuer variable, yet euer willing to yeeld vnto reason and the trueth.
For am not of their minde that make Religion as a matter of inheritance, to bee taken of their ancestors or their parentes, or that thinke it sufficient to saie, beleeue as the Queene beleeues: But thinke it the duetie of a Christian still to endeuour to informe himselfe how hee ought to serue God, and not to pinne his soule on another mans sleeue.
Such a reuerend regard haue alwaies had, and euer will haue of Religion, as a matter of saluation, not as euerie common action of mans life, as a thing to bee measured not by opinion, but by trueth, to bee chosen not by example, but by iudgement, to bee holden not for companie, but for conscience.
If you also haue the same measure, choice, and grounde of your Religion, as in reason you ought to haue: it maie happlie fall out, that the discouerie of the weakenes of D. Allens arguments, and of his deceitfull and malicious dealing in this his Pamphlet, as it hath confirmed in mee the Religion hold, so it maie alter in you the opinion you haue hitherto persisted in: and not without great cause, knowing that the naked trueth seeketh neither cloake nor corner, nor a simple and good cause, anie subtill, or bad conueyance.
Let not then anie preiudicate opinion of my Religion differing from yours, withdraw you from the patient reading and considering of my simple discourse, no more then the like opinion of D. Allens Religion hath withdrawen me from the diligent perusing and perpending of his subtill pamphlet, a greater learned and farre more cunning allurer then myselfe: especially seeing, that it is no part of my meaning herein, either to impugne your Religion, which is nothing at all fortified by this pamphlet: or to strengthen mine owne, which is as little weakened thereby: for those pointes leaue to Diuines, if there be any that thinke it worth the reading, or answering.
For mine own part find nothing in it, for which would haue cast away so much paper and inck, sauing onely a cunning conueiance of pernicious driftes, tending to the practise of sedition mischiefe, which thought fit to be displayed and laied open to the world, that the simple and such as giue too much credit to his doctrine, might not be therewith deceiued, and thereby drawne to their owne vtter destruction: and on the other side, that such as are of more capacity, and iudgement, either better affected in religio~, or men indifferent, seeing the monstrous shiftes vsed by such a principall Romaine Catholike, as D. Allen is, might thereby take a Caueat, to be the more wary, how they yeeld themselues to be seduced by such Catholiks perswasions.
But let vs now come to the examination of this pamphlet, and see what it is that maister Doctor vndertaketh therein, and how well he perfourmeth his taske.
He pretendeth vpon occasion of the former counterfeit letter (which mentioned to you before) to resolue the consciences of those English men which were the yeelders vp of Deuenter and Zutphen fortes to the Duke of Parma, touching the lawfulnes of their actio~: Wherof though he had alreadie by his letters to Sir William Stanley, giuen his opinion, as he saith, yet he will, for better clearing of the cause, set here downe his mind more largely and distinctly.
BEfore runne into the particulars, must note vnto you a thing in generall, which is not to be omitted.
assure you though be farre from the profession of Diuinity, yet can not but blush to see a thing written by way of a Resolution for the satisfying of mens consciences (being a matter of Diuinity) a treatise of
textes of Scripture cited for confirmation of the matter proposed, either directly or indirectly: especially being done by an ancient D. of Diuinity, by estimation singularly well read and learned, and the onely man of name among all the English Catholikes.
What is there to bee presumed of it, that so learned a man, so great a Diuine, now a Cardinall and chiefe piller of the Church of Rome, should vndertake to resolue mens consciences in a matter of Christian duty (yea whereon he pretendeth saluation or damnation to depend only with a Chaos of wordes, a confusion of arguments, drawne from morall philosophie, the law of Nature, and heathen constitutions, and with definitions, distinctions, and authorities fet from Plato, Aristotle, Cicero, &c: leauing vtterly all proofes, arguments, and authorities of holy Scripture, yea skarce so much as alleadging one text by way of exhortation? In mine opinion men are in common sense to iudge, that either the matter is very bad, and not iustifiable by Gods word, which yeeldeth not sufficient argument or authority (nay none at all) for the defense of it: or that such Diuines shew themselues to haue very litle zeale or religion in them, when they measure matters of conscience, saluation, or damnation, by the line of prophane Doctrine, and not of the holy Scriptures.
Whereupon must necessarily be inferred, that they are either impostors and deceiuers, in seeking to perswade men by a shew of naturall reason (vernished ouer with a glosse of gay wordes, and superficiall colours of philosophie) that which they are not able to proue by Diuinity; or els plaine Atheists Hypocrits, in carying onely the bare name of Religion on their backes, for a cloake to their disguised practises, and neglecting wholly the ground and substance thereof, in their cogitations, doctrine, and perswasions.
But the lesse M. D. hath vsed the proofes of Scripture and Diuinity in this argument, though it be nothing the more for his owne commendation, or for the credit of his Doctrine, yet haue the lesse cause to be displeased with it, considering that he hath thereby made it the fitter for so meane a scholler as my selfe (no Diuine at all) to deale with, and the easier for any man to ouerthrow.
Albeit my purpose is not (in truth) so much to enter into the particular confutation of his arguments (which are indeede none at all, or not worth the standing vpon) as to decipher vnto you his driftes and pollicies, which are founded euen vpon as weake groundes: yet to th'end you may perceiue how loose, imperfect, and quite voide of force his reasons are, will not grudge to cast away a litle time and labour in repeating, and reducing them to a kind of forme, which are so disorderly, confusedly, and dissolutely shufled out by him.
The maine proposition and ground of his first argument is this, That euery thing wrongfully obteined, and vniustly deteined from the true owners, whether they be by fraud or violence come by, according to all Diuine, and humane lawes, by the very rule of nature, ought to be restored to them to who~ they duely perteine.
M. Doctor would seeme by speech to drawe his argument from Diuinity, and yet not so entirely from Diuinity, but that he can be content with Diuine lawes, to mingle both humane lawes, and the rule of Nature: how be it his maner of prosecuting it, togither with his authorities which he alleageth, do argue it rather to bee deriued principally from the rule of Morall iustice, which giueth vnto euery man his owne: But let him take his choice from which he will drawe it, for all is to one effect, that is, to none effect at all for his purpose, for (to cut off this proposition short) see, pray you, how sophistically he dealeth.
He setteth first his proposition indefinite: That euery thing wrongfully obteined, and vniustly deteined, ought to be restored to the true owners, without adding by whom it ought be restored, and concludeth (as he must needes, if he conclude to his purpose) definitely, that is, That it ought to be restored by Sir William Stanley &c. Whereby he maketh his argument consist of foure termini (as the Logicians terme it) which is a foule fault in logike, as euery wrangling sophister of halfe a yeares standing in the Vniuersity can tell you.
Therefore good M. D. set downe your proposition certaine, and reason ad idem, and then we will yeelde it to be true: that is, That euery thing wro~gfully obteined, and vniustly deteined, from the true owners ought to be restored to them againe, that is, by them that wrongfully obteined, and vniustly deteined it: (for there is no man bound to satisfaction, neither by Diuine nor humane lawes, nor by the rule of Nature, but he onely that hath done the wrong:) and so will agree with you, that, whatsoeuer Sir William Stanley and the rest had wrongfully obteined, and did vniustly deteine from the king of Spayne, ought to be by them restored vnto him againe.
But you know well inough, and all men know that Deuenter, Zutphen fortes were neither obteined, nor deteined wrongfully by Sir William Stanley and his complices, but quietly, peaceably, iustly and by lawfull authority deliuered vnto them in charge and custodie, vnder her Maiestie, by my L. of Leicester her Lieutenant there: and therfore were not they any way bound to the restitution of them (sauing only vnto those of whom they had receiued them) being neither obteiners, nor deteiners of them, but onely ministers of their Princes commandement.
For howsoeuer the towne and fortes were obteined, yet the subiect being tyed to his Prince by allegeance and oth, and hauing vpon that othe receiued from his Prince, or her lawfull deputy, any place of charge to keepe and hold to her vse, is not to enquire into her right, how iustly or vniustly she hath gotten or keepeth it, but to looke into his owne charge and othe, whereof he is bound to giue account.
Yea suppose the Queenes Maiestie had by violence, fraude, or iniustice entred vpon those places, and so deteined them from the k. of Spaine: yet the same iustice, which giueth vnto euery man his owne, and in such case tyeth her to restitution of whatsoeuer she wrongfully witholdeth, yet the same iustice (I say) giueth her subiectes no such authoritie ouer her, as to bee iudges of her iust or vniust dealing, much lesse to make themselues correctors, or executors of iustice against her vpon their owne iudgement, and at their owne pleasure.
Nay, the same Iustice, whose foundation, (as your owne Author Cicero affirmeth) is Faith, tieth them to the performance of their faith and oath giuen vnto their Prince: which oath how litle authoritie your Popes Bull hath to dispense withall, as learned men as yourselfe M. Doctor (without offence of comparison) haue alreadie discussed.
And therefore let them, whose consciences you vndertake to satisfie, examine their consciences better touching the lawfulnes of this their action.
Thus you see M. Doctors subtil Sophistication, and how litle his principall Basis, whereon he buildeth his whole argument, serueth his purpose.
But, that you may see the weakenes of the rest of his consequences, as well as of this foundation, let vs for good fellowship grant him this proposition euen in such sort as hee putteth it (that wee maie haue more of his custome) and suffer him to proceed, that wee maie see how he will conclude.
Euerie thing (saith hee) wrongfully obteined, and vniustly deteined from the true owners, whether it be by fraude or violence come by, ought to be restored to them, to whom it duely perteineth.
What inferreth he hereupon? But the Towne of Deue~ter the Forts of Zutphe~ were both wrongfully obteined, and vniustly deteined from the true owner (viz. the King of Spaine) beeing by fraude or violence come by, by the Queene of England.
Ergo, The Towne of Deuenter and the Forts of Zutphen ought to bee restored (and therefore were lawfully and iustly restored) to the King of Spaine, by S. W. Stanley and Capt. Yorke, who had the charge and keeping of them for and vnder the Q. of England.
Here may you now (by the way) more plainely discerne the fault of his argument, whereof told you before, which he himselfe hath not so laied togither nor reduced into streight forme, in his pamphlet, least the fault should too easily be espied, but to colour his fallacie, hath gone about the bush with a circumstance of words, creeping slilie by degrees to the top of his intent, thinking by that meanes to steale it away vndescried, as in truth he might easily from plaine simple men, and such as are no schollers, which might well haue suffised his turne, for he seeketh no more: But let a man of anie meane iudgement marke it, and lay it together, and it is presently discouered.
For the argument is euident inough, and cannot be otherwise framed to his purpose, as any man of reason maie plainely perceiue, and he himselfe (I am sure) will not denie.
Now to examine his Minor, marke, pray you, of how manie partes it consisteth.
First: that the towne of Deuenter, and Zutphen fortes were both wrongfully obteined and vniustly deteined from the k. of Spaine by the Q. of England.
That the k. of Spaine is the true owner of them.
That they were by fraude, or violence come by, by the Queene of England.
All these three seuerall pointes ought D. Allen to proue, or els he proueth not his argument: yet of the two latter hath he not spoken a word, more then a bare affirmation: of the first he hath spoken much, and proued iust nothing.
But because his manner of reasoning is not close and well knit togither, but in a declamatorie kind, which is fitter for his purpose to perswade, though not so forcible in reason to proue, will endeuour to seuer his Logike from his Rhetorike, and gather his arguments aparte, that we may see what, and how directly he proueth.
Whatsoeuer (saith he) is obteined by vnlawfull warres, and so deteined, is both wrongfully obteined, and vniustly deteined.
But the Queene of Englands warres in the low countries, whereby she obteined Deuenter and Zutphen fortes, and so deteined them, are altogither vnlawfull.
Ergo, The towne of Deuenter Zutphen fortes were both wrongfully obteined, and vniustly deteined by the Q. of England (from the true owner, the k. of Spaine.)
For this must also be added to his conclusion, otherwise doth he not fully proue the Minor, of his former argument, which he is to proue: Wherein if a man would stand with him vpon euery strict point, he might iustly say this argument is euen as good as the former, for there is more in the Conclusion, then is conteined in both the Praemisses.
But let that go, and let vs graunt him also his Maior, and come directly to his Minor, viz.
That the Queene of Englands warres in the low countries, whereby she obteined Deuenter and Zutphen fortes, and so deteined them, are altogither vnlawfull.
What if we should deny, first that the Queenes Maiestie helde any warres at all in the low countries? Secondly, and if she did, yet that she obteined not Deuenter by warres? D. Allen is able to proue neither of them, and we might iustly deny both: For no man can saye (and say truely) that euer her Maiestie tooke the warre vpon her selfe, but onely sent some forces for gods cause to relieue the poore distressed cou~tries, crauing her assistance.
And for Deuenter, neither did her Maiestie obteine it by warres (for the towne did voluntarily of itselfe receiue, nay, they earnestly desired our garrison:) neither did her Maiestie obteine it at al, for it was neuer hers, neither did she euer claime it, or accept it as her owne, but onely was content at the request of the better sort of the towne, for their safety, to put her soldiours into it, to defend it.
But know he will say these are but cauils, for tryall whereof, referre them to the iudgement of any man of reason and indifferencie, which hath bene rightly informed therein: howbeit, because, if will stand vpon them, he is able to go no further, am therefore content to ouerpasse them and suffer him to proceede.
pray you let vs see how hee proueth The English warres in the low countries (seeing so it pleaseth him to terme them warres) to be altogither vnlawfull.
His rule whereby he measureth the lawfulnes of warres, is fet from Cicero, who saith in his books De Republica, as Isidorus citeth it: The warre is iust, which is denounced for recompence or reuenge of iniuries, and annoyance, or for defence against enimies.
This position being laied, because the Queens Marshall not iustifie her doings vpon anye title she hath to the low countries (which is without the compasse of his diuisio~) he presupposeth that all the world knoweth that shee can make no iust claime to Holland, Zela~d, or any other of those parts which she hath (as he saith) by armes seised on: all those prouinces being confessed to his Catholike Maiesties ancient and vndoubtfull inheritance.
These matters co~cerning Princes titles are fitter for other me~ then M. D. me to decide: therfore wil not take vpon me to say any thing touching her Maiesties right to the low countries, or any part of them, howsoeuer D. Allen dares affirme them all to be the king of Spaines ancient and vndoubtfull inheritance, by what authority know not: but how ancient and vndoubted soeuer hee maketh it, am sure men better acquainted with those causes then he, do not onely doubt of the kings title to sundry of the prouinces, but are flatly resolued the contrary.
But it is beside my purpose, and therefore leaue it.
Now let vs see how he proueth the English warres (as he termeth them) in the low countries to be neither for recompence or reuenge of iniuries and annoyance, nor for defence against enimies, therefore not iust, according to this former position out of Cicero.
The defence (saith he) of the kings rebels against their most iust Lord Souereigne is no lawful nor honorable quarrell of war; neither haue the said Traytors and rebels any authority to yeelde vp their Souereignes townes, and portes into his enimies handes, or themselues to the English protection or subiection.
All this is but a bare affirmation, which being denyed, his argument is at an end, for he prooueth no one parte of it.
Besides it is a plaine petitio principij, which is a grosse error in Logike, whee groundeth his argume~t vpon that which is itselfe in question.
For he presumeth the people of all the low countries to be the k. of Spaines rebels, him their most iust Lord and Souereigne: which is the whole matter in co~trouersie.
So you see this argument is cleane cut off by the roote.
And since he hath nothing disproued her Maiesties dealings in this point by the reason hee hath brought, giue me leaue now to iustifie the~ by an argument or two drawne from himselfe.
In the latter part of this pamphlet, where he goeth about to perswade her Maiesties subiects to reuolt from her, he doubteth not to affirme, that it is lawfull for the subiects for religions sake not only to reuolt from their souereigne, and to deliuer vp his cities countries into other mens hands, but also to beare armes against him, being in such case clerely discharged from all bond of othe and fidelitie to him.
Whereupon inferre, first, that those of the low countries, though they were (as he supposeth) the lawfull subiects of the k. of Spaine, yet might they for Religion (if there were no other cause) lawfully reuolte from the k. and yeeld vp his cities, and countries to the Queenes Maiesty, or any other.
Secondly, that if it be lawfull for the subiect, for religio~ to beare armes against his souereigne: then is it much more lawfull for an absolute Prince, for Religio~ also to yeeld succours to her distressed neighbors, against a Stranger.
am content M. Doctor to vse your owne arguments against yourselfe, albeit doe neither allow of them, nor thinke them in truth to be sound; yet since you thought it no iniurie to vs, to make vnlawfull weapons for your owne aduantage against vs, you must thinke it no iniurie to your+selfe to be beaten with your owne rodde.
Yet must be so bold as to borrow another argument from you, for the iustifying of her Maiesties dealings in the low Countreys to bee lawfull by your owne rule, as being for defence against enemies.
In your Inuectiue against our vniust dealings, you saie, that wee thinke it cause of warre good inough to hinder our neighbours greatnes, and to disturbe other mens quietnes, to procure our owne peace and safetie.
Let vs see what English is to be picked out of this.
Why should we seeke to hinder our neighbours greatnes? are we anie thing the lesse, by his being greater? no: vnlesse he make himself greater, by making vs lesse: what need we then to feare his greatnes? Belike it is to bee feared, that, if he be greater, he will make vs lesse.
What neede I, nodum in in scirpo quaerere? what neede so to hunt out the cause why wee should seeke to hinder his greatnes, when D. Allen himselfe hath set it downe in plaine termes, to procure our owne peace, and safety? Whereby he giueth vs a good caueat to prouide for both, giuing vs to vnderstand, that if the King of Spaine should once grow great, as D. Allen thinketh he should in deede, if he were once quietly possessed of the Low Countries, then should not we long enioy either peace, or safety.
Which in trueth hath bene vpon good cause long suspected by vs, but may now better be beleeued, when D. Allen (though thinke in trueth vnaduisedly, and against his will) doth so plainely assure vs of it.
Now where he saith, that We thinke it cause of warre good inough to hinder our neighbours greatnes, and to disturbe other mens quietnes, to procure our owne peace safety, Let vs see whether no man els thinketh so, besides our selues.
VVhat saie you if his owne Author Cicero thinke so as well as we? Suscipienda quidem bella sunt (saith hee) ob eam causam, vt sine iniuria in pace viuatur· Warres are to be taken in hand, that is, may must be taken in ha~d for that cause, to that intent, that men may liue in peace without iniurie, that is all one as if hee should say, in peace and safetie.
VVhereupon frame my argument thus: Those warres which are taken in hand, to the end that the vndertakers thereof may liue in peace and safetie, are taken in hand vpon iust cause, consequently lawfull.
But our warres against the K. of Spaine (if wee hold any warres against him) are taken in hand, to the end that we may liue in peace and safetie.
Ergo, Our warres against the King of Spaine are taken in hand vpon iust cause, co~sequently lawfull.
The Maior take out of Cicero: the Minor out of D. Allens own words: the Argument cannot be denied, for it is a good and true Syllogisme, and the consequence necessarie.
VVherby you may euide~tly perceiue, that not only our wars in the low countries, but those also by Sea, which D. Allen so defameth (if we did mainteine any such warres) or anie other warres which wee should vndertake against the K. of Spaine, are both iust and lawfull, euen by his owne allowance, beeing for our owne defense, and the procurement of our own peace and safetie.
Further, because D. Allen shall haue no shew of reason left him, whereby hee may cauill vpon the word, saying that we cannot iustifie our wars to be for defense against enemies, the K. of Spaine beeing (as he termeth him) our neighbour, allie, and confederate: albeit it is a thing not needfull to bee prooued, nor doeth anie way concerne my argument, (which is most strong infallible without it) neither will take vpon me of my selfe to affirme the K. of Spaine to be our enemie, or touch him in anie wise with breach of his league confederacie with vs; yet to stoppe M. Allens mouth with his owne words, that he may (I saie) haue nothing to cauill vpon, will onlie set himselfe to answere himselfe in this behalfe.
The defe~se (saith he) of the kings rebels against their most iust Lord, Souereigne, is no lawfull, nor honorable quarrel of warres: neither haue the said traitors and rebels any authority to yeeld vp their Souereigns Townes and Ports into his enemies hands, or themselues to the English protection, or subiection.
Here D. Allen termeth vs the K. of Spaines enemies, and if wee bee his enemies (as D. Allen affirmeth) then must he necessarily bee our enemie in like sort, for it is a word of Relation, which beeing rightly pronounced of the one, must also necessarily bee pronounced of the other.
For a Prince can not bee said to bee the confederate of him that is his enemie: but they must bee both as the one is, either both Socij, or both hostes, both Confederates, or both enemies.
This a very meane scholler, nay euerie man of anie reason or common sense may perceiue to be true.
And doe not doubt but D. Allen himselfe, when he termed vs the K. of Spaines enemies, knew him well inough to bee our enemie.
Thus you see not only that D. Allen hath failed in the proofe of the one part of his diuision, that is: That our warres are not for defence against enemies, and therfore vnlawfull: but also that we haue prooued the contrarie against him, both according to his owne diuision, that is: That our warres are for defence against enemies, therefore lawfull: also by other reasons of our owne, that is: That our warres are for the procurement of our owne peace and safetie, and therefore most iust, and lawfull.
Wherein our proofes arguments (though they be strong inough of themselues against anie man) yet are they strongest against him of all men, beeing drawen euen from his owne Allegations, reasons, and assertions: and therefore the more to be credited.
Now come we to the other part, and let vs see how hee prooueth The English warres in the low Countreys not to be mooued for reuenge of iniuries or annoyance.
The Kings Maiestie (saith he) hath done to the Queene or her Realme no such iniuries, for redresse or reuenge whereof shee should by hostilitie enter into his Dominions, and surprise his Townes and Castles, and bring his people into her subiection.
This is a point wherein am loth to meddle in vttering what thinke, or haue heard, yea scarcely would touch that which is commonly bruted abroad in the mouthes of all men, considering that the matter concerneth Princes, is not fit for priuate men to deale in: therfore would rather refer the iudgement therof to euery mans own particular knowledge, opinion, conscience.
Yet bicause it is a part of D. Allens argument, which hee must not so clearly carry away, least it should seeme to be yeelded vnto him, as true: will craue pardon and leaue, only to remember some particulars either knowen, or commonly beleeued and reported.
And first know men of iudgement think it no great kindnes in a Prince to harbour (much lesse to enterteine mainteine) within his Dominions the fugitiue Rebels or Traitors of another Prince, his confederate, vnderstanding how vnduetifully (nay how lewdly and impiously) they haue dealt with their naturall Souereign.
But these (you wil saie) are but actions of vnkindnes, not such hainous iniuries.
VVell: would they were lesse, offences am sure they are at the least, such as fall within one of the kinds of Iniustice and Iniurie.
For greater, it is not fit for me to speake of.
Yet doubt not but D. Allen himselfe (whatsoeuer he saith here) and a great number of Romish Catholikes more besides him, know somewhat touching the Inuasio~ made by the K. of Spains subiects in Ireland, in the year
of the practises of his Embassador Mendoza since that time, and of others her Maiesties most vnnatural, subiects shal saie? nay most bloodie, abhominable, butcherly minded traitors, both before since.
The verie bowels and secrets whereof although they haue been happely kept from our knowledge, (I meane from the knowledge of the meaner sort:) yet their owne confessions haue discouered more then is meet for me to rehearse: and so much as hath bred a general opinion rumor yea euen in the verie co~mon people of England, that the K. of Spaine hath been not onlie priuy to the~, but a principall Author Actor in them all.
will not speake of the secret practises conspired for the deposing of her Maiestie, and aduancing of the Q. of Scots to the crown of Engla~d: which whether, or how iustly they may touch the K. of Spain, it is no part of my duetie to deale with.
am sory to haue had occasion to saie so much, in a thing so litle apperteining to me: but am the more to be pardoned, in that the argument hath inforced me thereunto, in that haue mentioned nothing more then is knowen common to the multitude, and could not haue said lesse, vnlesse should haue said nothing at al.
But hope this that hath ben said, may be sufficient to S. W. Stanley, Capt. Yorke, to all the English Romanists, to whom D. Allen doeth especially direct his Pamphlet.
For know there is not any of that sort of any account, but is so wel acquainted with the priuities of these actions, as that he can picke out of these inough to assure him, that D. Allen hath but dissembled with the~ in this point.
VVhich being so, they must also know confesse, and all men els may plainly perceiue, that this other part of his diuision serueth not his turne, no more then the former, to prooue her Maiesties dealings in the low Countries vnlawfull, being grounded vpon a false supposition, that is, That the K. of Spain hath done vnto her Maiestie no such iniurie, wherof shee should seeke reuenge.
Thus haue you heard his argument brought to an end, for here he resteth euen in simple affirmations, which hope haue been sufficientlie conuicted both by substantiall reasons and instances: so that there remaineth not now anie thing to be further answered, his whole argument and euerie part thereof, being confuted in order from the first proposition to the last.
And, besides this vvhich you haue heard, hath he not anie argume~t in his vvhole Pamphlet, either to iustifie the rendering of Deuenter and Zutphen Forts, or to disprooue her Maiesties doings against the K. of Spaine anie way; which haue heere both by the authorities of his owne Authours, and by reasons deriued euen from himselfe, most euidently declared to bee iustifiable euerie waie, if they were greater then they are: which could with further more infallible reasons also confirme, if it vvere requisite, or apperteining to my purpose.
But must novv bestovv a vvord or tvvo in noting vnto you some errours or ouersightes (at the least) escaped from D. Allen, euen in the verie entrie almost of his argume~t: vvhere in the circumstance he vseth, to induce a probabilitie and credit of his first proposition, he setteth dovvne a generall Thesis flat contrarie to that vvhich he goeth about to prooue.
For after manie speeches touching the necessitie of Restitution, hovv thinges vvrongfullie gotten and deteined, ought to bee restored, in the ende hee concludeth vvith these verie vvordes: Yet whatsoeuer is done against military discipline and Iustice, is sinne and punishable by Gods lawes.
What can there bee saide more directly against the action of S. W. Stanley, and the rest? For there is none of them, nor anie soldier els of any knowledge or experience, but knoweth, that to yeeld a Towne, Fort, or holde, wherewith a man is put in trust, to the enemy (yea besieging it) so long as there is within it sufficient strength and meanes to defend it, yea though it were not defensible, yet to yeeld it before due summons, is death by the law of Armes: much more to render a Towne freely, without either force or demand; or rather corruptly and traitorously to sel it for money: but the law of Arms doth not punish anie fact with death, which is not done against the same law and discipline: therefore it must needs follow that the rendring vp of Deuenter and Zutphen Forts is against military discipline, and consequently (by D. Allens own position sin, and punishable by Gods lawes.
VVhat a resolution call you this for the satisfying of mens consciences touching the lawfulnes of their action, to lead them about with a circumstance of other meaning, and in conclusion to tell them in plaine termes, that that which they haue done is sin, punishable by Gods lawes? Yet are there two other errors, though not so euident, yet as worthy the noting, euen in the next sentence immediatly going before: where, after, he hath taught, that restitutio~ is to be made of al things vniustly take~ withholde~, vpo~ pain of damnatio~, he addeth these wordes: And this say euen in lawfull warres, or such as to the common people may be vpo~ their Princes credit so deemed.
Where though they may offend th'enimy in life, goods, liberty, otherwise: &c. Wherein first he maketh no difference betweene lawfull warres, vnlawfull warres, which may vpon their Princes credit be by the common people deemed lawfull: as though thinges were iust or vniust either vpon the Princes credit, or according to the peoples opinion of them, not of their own nature, and according to the groundes and causes of them.
By this reason there should no warres be vnlawfull: for there is no warre vndertaken, but that both the Prince which mooueth it, is able, and doth pretend some reason (or colour of reason) to make it seeme iust, and the common people also, by the Princes declaration and perswasions, may easily be induced to esteeme it to be lawfull.
Wherein by the way must note some simplicitie, or great dissimulation in D. Allen, which would admit the lawfulnes, or vnlawfulnes of warres, to be measured by the opinion of the common people, who (God wot) are furthest from the knowledge of State matters, and the secret dealings which passe betweene Princes, and from the consideration of the iniuries and occasions of warre, and therefore the vnmeetest of all men to be iudges of the lawfulnes thereof.
But howsoeuer it be deemed lawfull, whether by the common people, or by the better and wiser sort, and such as are most priuie to the secrets of the State, vpon the Princes credit, or otherwise, if it be in trueth vniust; neither can the warre it selfe bee in anye sort equalled with that warre, which is indeede lawfull, neither can th'executions thereof be allowed and iustified as th'executions of a lawfull warre.
For the one is simply iust, and th'other simply vniust.
And howsoeuer the subiect presuming a thing to be iust vpon the Princes credit, perswadeth himselfe that he doth no iniustice, because hee knoweth not that which he doth, to be vniust: yet is his action in it selfe neuer the lesse vniust: for, ignorantia non excusat peccatum.
You see what a foule error in Diuinity this is; yet is there as bad euen in the next wordes following: viz. where though they may offend th'enimy in life, goods, liberty, &c. Hauing shewed before that restitution ought to be made of all things vniustly gotten and deteined, vpon paine of damnation, and that euen in lawfull warres, or such as to the common people may vpon the Princes credit be so deemed, he now maketh it lawfull notwithstanding, euen in the same warres, to offend th'enimy in life, goods, and libertie.
As though it were not as great an offence, vniustlye to take awaye a mans goods, as to withholde them: or not a greater offence to take awaye life or liberty, then to take awaye goods: Nay, as though to take away both goods, liberty, and life, were no offence at all (for he maketh them all lawfull) where, in the same case, to withholde the same goods, is an offence damnable.
What grosse absurdities are these, and how contrary to all Diuinity, humane reason, and lawes politike, yea euen vnto themselues? For what can bee more contrarye to it selfe, then first to say that restitution of thinges wrongfully obteined and vniustly deteined, is to be made, vnder paine of mortall sinne and damnation (wherein is plainely implyed by himselfe that both wrongfull obteining, and vniust deteining, is mortall damnable sinne,) now after to say that the obteining is lawfull, and the deteining da~nable? thing being iustly lawfully gotte~, how ca~ the possessio~ of it be vniust vnlawfull? For better distinction of the actions, let vs suppose them to be in distinct and seueral persons.
Is not he that robbeth a man, and taketh away his goods, in as great fault, both by Diuine and humane lawes, as he that receiueth and possesseth them? Nay rather in greater: for we account him principall, the other but accessarie: and by great reason.
For if the goods had not beene first wrongfully taken, they could neuer haue bene wrongfully deteined.
So the vniust taking was the thing that made the deteining vniust: (euen by the rules of Philosophie) Quicquid efficit tale, id ipsum est magis tale.
Now if the taking away of goods be a greater offense, or but as great, as the deteining of them, what is then the taking away of libertie, yea of life? Vndoubtedly, vnlesse we will hold with Illyricus the opinion of the Stoiks, omnia peccata esse aequalia, which opinion the holy church hath condemned, and Illyricus himselfe for an heretike in holding it, we must needes confesse the offence to be farre greater, as the thinges themselues which are taken away, are of greater ac+count, and deerer vnto men.
Being then a greater offence in reason, lawes politike, and especially in Diuinitie, to take away life, goods, and liberty, then to deteine onely goods so taken, it must needes appeare to be a great error for a man to affirme, that the wrongfull deteining of goods (which is the lesse sinne) is a mortall and damnable sinne, and the wrongfull taking away both of goods, liberty, and life (which is proued to be the farre greater sinne) euen in the same case, is no sinne at all, but a thing lawfull.
What man then, that is of any iudgment, reason, or sense, will giue credit to his doctrine, or thinke him to be an honestman, which hauing expressely taught, that the greater sinne is no sin at all, goeth about to perswade him that the lesse sinne is a sinne mortall and damnable, and thereupon groundeth his whole argument? It is an olde rule for such as will practise the trade of lying, that Mendacem oportet esse memorem, lyer must haue a good memorie, least he be entrapped in his owne tale: but it seemeth D. Allen presumed so much vpon his continuall exercise in the art, and thought himselfe so much his crasies maister, as that he neuer minded the precept made for Schollers.
But so it fareth euer with a badde cause, which haue it neuer so stout a patrone and defender, yet will it by one meanes or other betray it selfe: such is the force of the naked, simple, and vndisguised truth, which confoundeth falshood, euen in her owne colours.
For, Magna est veritas, praeualet: Great is the truth, and preuaileth: yea it breaketh out vnwares, euen out of the mouthes of those that labour most to obscure and suppresse it, that God (the authour of Truth, yea the very truth itselfe) may be glorified euen by his enimies.
Diuers other thinges could note vnto you out of this pamphlet, euen as grosse, and absurd, and as directly against D. Allens purpose, as any thing may be: But it were vaine to spend time in the further confuting of that, which is skarce worth the looking on: and besides, it is not my speciall purpose, as told you before, neither would haue said so much concerning this parte of his pamphlet, but only to th'intent to make my way plainer to the rest, by laying first eue~ with the ground this dead rotten hedgerow of his disordered, dissolute, and scattered argume~t: wherin you see not onely euery part therof, in order (as wel as it might be gathered put togither) clean dissolued, answered, confuted, with substantial reasons authorities produced therupo~ at large, so far forth as the matter required; but also sundry ouersights errors (co~mitted in the handling therof) so manifestly discouered, and retorted vpon him, as most effectuall against himselfe: In somuch as do not a litle maruell how he durst adue~ture to write so slender superficiall a thing vnto them, so patched togither stuffed vp with so many so apparant contrarieties, falshoods, vnlesse he either presumed of their ignorance (which is the vertue that he, the cu~ning clarkes, learned sort of his sect, do somuch co~mend vnto their schollers, as the mother of Deuotion or els assured himself of as much credit authority with them, as Pythagoras had with his followers, that would beleue whatsoeuer he said, without any reaso~ or further enquiry of the matter, thought it a sufficient cause to alleage also vnto others, [undefined span alphabet] that he said so.
If D. Allen haue brought his Catholikes so much to the be~t of his bow, he may be bold to tell them that the soule which was in the Coblers cocke, after many [undefined span alphabet] is crept at the le~gth into his body.
But in matters of conscience, saluation, or da~nation (as he saith these are) let such as haue a conscience, looke to their consciences, not hazarde their saluation, or da~nation vpon his word, but leane vnto reason seek to informe themselues rightly of the truth.
For if it be true (as it is most true) that Christ saith, If the blind lead the blind, they fall both into the pit, which he meaneth of those that are blind indeede of ignorance; much more shall it be true, being meant of them that are wilfully blinde, of obstinacie, and desire not to see, that both the leader, the follower shall fall into the bottomlesse pit of euerlasting destruction.
BBut let vs now come to the very point and purpose, whereunto this cunning pamphlet of D. Allens appeareth wholy to tend: for he were very simple of a shallow reach, that woulde thinke that D. Allen had not a further meaning herein, then to satisfie the consciences of Sir William Stanley and his complices, touching the lawfulnes of their giuing vp of Deuenter, especially when he had before (as he saith himselfe) deliuered his opinion by his letters to Sir W. Stanley therevpon, (and therefore needed the lesse to go about to resolue them againe, which were neuer vnresolued in that point:) besides, euen in this pamphlet which he pretendeth to write onely for their resolution, spe~deth least part of his time, labour, or cunning in that argument, neither iustifieth their action in any sort, but onely with bare wordes voide of weight or substance (as hath bene sufficiently shewed) but rather by his owne reasons disalloweth reproueth it, leaueth it in the midst more doubtful indefe~sible then before: leaping into an other argument inuectiue against her Maiestie; her doings, of her exco~munication, deposition by the Pope, from thence to a perswasion of her liege people to reuolte from their obedience and allegeance vnto her.
Whereby he plainely bewrayeth (euen more cleere and manifest then the light of the Sunne to all men of any meane vnderstanding, yea to him that hath but halfe an eie, that his verie direct ende and purpose was wholy to prepare the mindes of the Romish Recusants (such as are apt hearers, readie followers of his doctrine) for the furtherance and assistance of all seditious practises, that maie bee mooued and attempted against her Maiestie by the malicious Associates of that wicked confederacie, and especially of the most iniurious inuasion, long since conspired, and complotted, and now presently prouided to bee put in execution against her Maiestie and her Realme, by the K. of Spaine, the Pope, and their Adherents.
And to this purpose wholy was this Pamphlet of D. Allens intended, and the other Theme (touching the rendring of Deuenter enterteined onlie for an introduction therunto.
Wherin whether he haue had anie wrong offred him in resembling him to Sinon, whom he hath so truely represented herein, referre to the iudgement of the Romish Catholikes themselues, that hold him in greatest reuerence.
Who, how soeuer they are affected towardes him for Religions sake, yet if there be anie sparke of true honor, English valour, or loue of their Countrie in them (as trust and assure my selfe there is) doubt not but looking into, and well foreseeing the end of his purposes, they will vtterly abhorre his vnnaturall practises.
But marke praie you the order hee obserueth to attaine vnto his intent.
First to drawe her Maiestie into discredit and disliking with all men, and consequently with her subiects, whereby they maie bee the more easilie incited against her: hee defameth all her most noble, princelie, and Religious actions, vndertaken for the reliefe of her poore oppressed neighbours, by the name of publike robberies, and sacrilegious warres against God and his Church.
Secondly, to giue them some encouragement and warrant (as it were) whereby they maie be the bolder to disobey, and to renounce their due allegeance and seruice vnto her Maiestie: hee teacheth them that since her Excommunication and Deposition by the Pope, shee hath no iust title or interest vnto her Crowne and Kingdome, nor anie power or authoritie ouer them, to command them, but that they are euer since that time, freelie discharged from all duetie and allegeance vnto her Maiestie: nay further, that no act done by her authoritie, since the publication of that Excommunication Deposition, hath beene, or can be lawfull by the law of God, or man: and therefore that no man may lawfully serue her in any action, be it otherwise neuer so iust.
Whereupon he runneth into an earnest persuasion of reuolt, to withdraw her Subiects from her seruice, and exhort them to the seruice of the Romish Catholike partie, and her enemies.
What blasphemous slanders, prodigious affirmations, impudent lies, and deuilish persuasions are these? and how farre vnbeseeming the name, profession and calling of a Diuine? But what is there so honest and godlie, that D. Allen will not defame? what so false and incredible, that hee will not affirme? what so wicked and abhominable, that hee will not perswade? It had been far fitter for D. Allen to haue dealt with his Portis, and let alone the names and doings of Princes.
If hee had been as busie in his booke, and as carefull of those thinges which belong to his vocation, he might haue sought out more Diuinitie to satisfie the Consciences of his Catholike Soldiers, and with more credit (or probabilitie at the least) defended their action, then he hath done.
And as vnfit as it was for him, to call in question the names and dooings of Princes, so vnmeet were it for mee, and repugnant to all good discretion, to presume to enter into their defense, of whose actions am neither able, nor worthie to speake, sufficiently for their worthines: whose sacred Maiestie and authoritie deriued from the high Gouernor of the world, is as the brightnes of the Sunne shining in his greatest perfection, not to bee gazed on by our dazled eies, ought to be a shield of protection to all their dooings, against the curious scanning, and venimous detraction of malicious monsters.
Wherefore wil not dare to meddle, so much as with the mention of their names or actions, whom God hath ordeined to represent his owne power, and authoritie ouer vs here on earth, without former crauing of pardon with all humilitie, that maie bee licenced onlie to examine the truth, (nay the detestable falshood) of these most iniurious calumniations.
Whereof also, that maie not seeme to make a question of that which is past al question, not to be brought into question by such companions, will bee as spare of speech, and vse as much breuitie, as the cause and case will permit.
Now then praie you M. Allen (for to you will now addresse my speech, to you, which are the defamer of vertue it selfe, and the detracter of all godlines) what publike robberies are those you obiect vnto vs (for her Maiesties name is not fit to be defiled by your impure lippes)? what sacrilegious warres against God and his Church? If you meane the defense or reliefe of the low Countries, which is the onelie thing that galleth you, in respect of the K. of Spaine your chiefe Patrone, and the onlie matter that ministred you the argument of this your pamphlet, her Maiesties dealings in that cause (which it pleaseth you to terme wars) haue ben sufficiently iustified alreadie against your obiections, in this former discourse, as well by the ouerthrow of your arguments, as also by better and more forcible arguments brought against you, drawen euen from your owne Authors, nay from your owne manifest affirmations.
Therefore haue you small cause, and lesse reason to runne on, vpon a headlong conclusion of your owne false assumptions, to defame those actions, which you could not disprooue, nay which your owne assertions haue prooued most lawfull.
This only should bee sufficient to stoppe your mouth, though there were nothing more to be said in that behalfe.
But because thinke it more expedient to satisfie other men (such as wil with reason be satisfied) then necessarie to answere your slanders, will not stand wholy vpon those aduantages.
VVherefore if anie man doubt either of the reason, intent, or Iustice of that action; first, for the former pointes referre him to the declaration published by authoritie, at the time when her Maiestie first sent her forces ouer into the low Countries, Anno.
wherein are declared the causes that mooued her Maiestie to giue aide and succourse vnto those afflicted Countries, so fully and plainely, as doubt not but may satisfie anie reasonable man, touching her reason, and intent therein.
As for the iustice and lavvfulnes of the action, albeit the reason and intent thereof being before declared, and allovved, must needes make the action also iustifiable, vnto such as shall allovv of the causes, yet because D. Allen shall not runne cleare away vvith an opinion of his conceit, vvil thinke it no great labor to iustifie also the action, by argume~ts dravven from his ovvn authors.
Iniustitiae duo sunt genera, (saith Cicero): vnum eorum qui inferunt: alterum eorum, qui ab ijs, quibus infertur, si possint, non propulsant iniuriam.
There are two kinds of iniustice: the one, in them that doe wrong, themselues: the other in them that doe not reskue and defend other men, from the iniuries offered them, if they be able.
Now of these two kinds of Iniustice, the one was exercised by the K. of Spaine vpon the people of the low Countries (as they saie themselues, for I, for my part, will not imitate the example of D. Allen in charging Princes with Iniustice ): whereupon the said people crauing her Maiesties aide and assistance, the other kinde (saith Cicero should haue been offered them by her, if shee should haue denied them her helpe and succours, to defend them from iniurie.
Qui autem non defendit (saith hee) nec obsistit, si potest, iniuriae, tàm est in vitio, quàm si parentes, aut patriam, aut socios deserat.
But hee that doeth not defend, nor withstand, if hee can, the wrong done to others, is as much in fault, as if hee should forsake his parentes, Countrie, or friendes: which is the most vnnaturall iniustice.
Now if it be a principall point of Iniustice for a man not to defend and succour them that are iniuried, if he be able, and so farre foorth as hee is able to doe it: then it followeth a contrarijs, that it is a principall part of Iustice, to assist and defend them that are wronged.
By which argument her Maiesties most gracious and Princely action, in yeelding aide and defense vnto the poore oppressed people of the low Countries, is effectually prooued to bee most iust, lawfull, and honourable, and hee a lyer, a slanderer, and an abuser of men, that hath wickedly sought to dishonour it.
will not (though well and iustly might) iustifie the action vpon Religion, (as beeing for the defense of the true Catholike and Apostolike Religion, which we professe) because will not runne into the same fault, which reprehend in him, that is, Petere principium, to ground mine argument vpon that which is in question between him and me: no more then wil allow him to impeach it vpon the authoritie of his former assumption, That all the Prouinces (of the low Countries) are confessed to bee his Catholike Maiesties ancient and vndoubtfull inheritance: which is in question of armes euen at this day, and therefore not necessarie to bee disprooued by mee: neither might doe it, vnles would offende in the same fault, which also reprooue in D. Allen, that is, in dealing with Princes titles, which is no part of his duetie and mine.
Now how vniustly and falsly he chargeth her Maiestie with entring by hostilitie into the King of Spaines Dominions, surprising his Townes and Castles, and bringing his people into her subiection: let all men iudge, that haue in them either reason, discretion, or indifferencie.
First, it is (as hath been alreadie said) a thing in question co~trouersie, whether those parts of the low cou~tries, where her Maiesties forces haue bin, be the K. of Spaines Dominions, or no: and if they bee not, then is this a most euident and manifest slander, euen before the face of the whole world.
But suppose them to be the K. of Spaines Dominions, as he presumeth; yet is it not vnknowen to anie priuate mean man in this Realme, that knoweth anie thing of the affaires of those Countries, that her Maiestie hath beene offered, yea, with humble and earnest sute of the people of those partes, intreated, to take both them and their Countries into her absolute protection, rule and gouernment, which, though there were no great doubt, but that shee might lawfully haue done, yet hath her Maiestie euer hitherto vtterlie refused them: which shee needed not, neither by all likelihood would haue done, if shee had had anie such great thirst after those Townes, Castles, Countries or peoples Dominion.
No, her Maiestie is content with her owne kingdome, and gouerneth her subiects by lawfull authoritie, with Iustice and Clemency, not by tyranny, with rigor, and oppression: neither seeketh shee, either by the Popes pretended authoritie and assistance to depose, or by viole~t armes to depriue, other Princes of their kingdomes.
Shee cleaueth not to the Pope, to make his supreme power a warrant for her will, though she might haue many aduantages and priuiledges therby, to take leaue what, where, when, how she liketh, to confound all lawes, both of God and man, and to make all lawfull that she lusteth: but she hath care of her ownesoule, and conscience, and of the charge committed vnto her by him, to whom onely she is to giue account thereof: she respecteth not her own profit or pleasure, but the puritie and syncerity of religion, and the true worship of God: therefore she reiecteth all frendship, fauour, and countenance of the Pope.
She thinketh not kingdomes to be rightly theirs that can catch them, nor practiseth by Machiauelian shiftes (as you terme them) to dispossesse Princes of their liues, to the intent to possesse her selfe of their kingdomes.
She thrusteth not her neighbours out of their rightfull inheritance, to enlarge her owne dominions, but diminisheth her owne forces, to succour and relieue her distressed neighbours.
And shall these her most vertuous, godly, and religious actions be defamed by a most vitious, vngodly, and malicious detractor? But the Palme tree, which resembleth vertue, the more it is burthened, the more it riseth againe, and the pure gold the more it is rubbed, the more it glistereth; and her vertuous, pure, and golden deedes, the more they are blasphemed by such an one, whose tongue (as they say) is no slaunder, but his reproch rather a credit, the brighter shall they shine in glorie to the euerlasting memorie of her vnspotted renowne.
And since am in hand with D. Allens malicious and slanderous inueighing against her Maiestie, and her ministers, may not by the way omit this proper quippe giuen my of Leicester (wherein he seemeth wonderfully to haue pleased his owne queint conceit) by offering a comparison betweene the D. of Parmaes glorious exploits, and his Lordships famous factes (as it pleaseth him skornefully to terme them) with a scilicet.
le pidum caput, lusty Cardinall: so well it becometh a man of your coate and calling, to play Dauus, to take vpon you the part and person of a scoffer? And pray you what great dishonor haue you done the noble Earle therin? As though his vertues were so farre inferiour, to the others.
speake not any way to the derogatio~ of the Dukes honor, for know him to be a worthy a Prince, and a famous soldiour: neither by way of comparison, for am not so il nurtured, as to make co~parisons betwene Princes.
But hope your Catholike soldiours Sir W. Stanley, and Rowland Yorke, the rest will confesse, that for the small time he was in those countries, the little meanes he had there, considering also the great crosses he had both there and elsewhere, he was neither idle, nor spent his time trauell in vaine: he shewed sufficiencie inough both in his temperate, prudent, and politike gouernment of the State, and managing of the militarie affaires: neither was he backward for his owne person (if he were not too forward) at any seruice in the field, where either his counsell, presence, or help of hand was required.
And, howsoeuer Graue was cowardly (and by euident proofe also trayterously) deliuered by Hemert the Gouernor, Venlo sold by the Burghers, before th'enimie euer prepared to march towards it, Nuys (after the wounding of the Gouernor) with little force obteined, but not without some trechery, lastly Berke two monethes besieged, in the end aba~doned for fee of the Earle of Leicester with his army, being at Elte~ onward in his march thither, to leauy the siege: yet my L. of Leicester (with a very smal power, not aboue
men, of al sorts) enca~ped before Duisburgh on tuesday, entre~ched it on wednesday, pla~ted his ordinance on Thursday, battered it on Friday, and had it yeelded to his mercy the same day by noone: and within a fortnight after, remoued with the same power to Zutphen, abode the Duke of Parmaes coming (who was reported to come with almost foure times so many) encountred his vantgard one to sixe at the least, besieged the fort, and within three weekes wan it, euen in the Duke of Parmaes sight, which had before that time endured ten monethes siege of more the~ twice so great an army, yet held good Neither did the Earle of Leicester raise his siege from either of these pieces, till he had gotte~ the~: neither bought he either of them, but with the price of his owne labour industrie (being present in person and giuing both direction assistance in all these seruices) and with the bloud of his soldiours, and those very few.
All this your Catholike soldiours also know to bee most true.
And are these exploits, none at all, or to be contemned and derided? But in truth M. Doctor you know not what they be, and therefore you make light of them.
would you had bene present your selfe either in the towne of Duisburgh, or in one of the fortes of Zutphen, to haue seene them: then might you better haue iudged of them, at the least am perswaded you would not so haue skorned them.
And if you thinke the infortunate successe of Sluys the yeare following, an impeachment to the credit gotten by these exploits: you do greatly abuse your selfe.
For it is very· well knowne to all men (especially of those countries) where and in whom the fault of that default lay.
For if those preparations which my L. of Leicester commanded, and made sure account of, had bin duely accomplished, as they were certainely promised and assured by them that had the charge thereof: the towne had (with Gods helpe) vndoubtedly bene relieued.
But howsoeuer the matter fel out either by the negligent or treacherous dealings of other men, that were put in trust therein: say with Ouid: careat successibus opto, Quisquis ab euentu facta notanda put at: Ill may he chieue, that measureth the fact by the euent: and little reason hath he, that will impute another mans fault, as a dishonour to my L. of Leicester.
But herein may you plainely see the intemperancie of D. Allen, and how he dealeth by affection, that when he hath nothing that he can iustly obiect in particular to so honorable and worthy a noble man, yet he will in a general sort glaunce at him, only to bring his name in question with the multitude.
But all the worlde may easily know the cause why the Earle of Leicester is aboue al me~ the most odious to D. Alle~, that is, onely because he is one of the greatest, principall patrons of true religion, which D. Allen so much hateth.
And for this cause also haue there bene sundry other infamous libels heretofore secretly cast out and spred abroad, against this most noble gentlema~, likely inough by Allen himselfe, or by Persons, or atleast some one of that viperous backbiting generation.
Wherein, the authors (as if Belzebub himselfe, the maister of that malicious sect, had sat by, giuen them instructions) haue not only raked their owne braines to the bare scull, but (I am sure) haue not left any one corner within the whole compasse of Hell it selfe vnransacked, to seeke and find out some new strange kinds of rancor and venim (more then all the Poets from the beginning of the worlde could euer inuent for the description of Enuie, the Furies themselues) wherewith to exasperate and empoison their most outragious slaunders, breathed out against him.
Which euen vpon the very first view haue appeared vnto all men so manifestly false, monstrous, and farre from all colour of truth, credit, or likelyhood, as his very enimies themselues, and such as hate him in their hartes, haue not onely bene ashamed of the slaunders, but openlye condemned the authours of that most barbarous villany, and shamelesse immanity.
In which respect being with all men generally so much discredited, detested and abhorred for their abhominable vntruth, they haue not hitherto bene thought worthy, fit, or seemely to be answered by any man, and therefore shall not presently be further stirred by me, but returned to the filthy sinke, from whence they proceeded.
And for the authours thereof, as, thinking by this meanes to make his Lordship odious amo~gst men, they haue not onely failed of their purpose, but haue thereby also made themselues hatefull vnto God, and infamous to the worlde, and fallen themselues into the pit which they digged for him: So haue they contrarie to their own minds, and against their willes) heaped on his head the heauenly blessings which Christ himselfe with his owne mouth pronounceth vpon those which are reuiled, persecuted, falsely slandered for his sake.
Which may be, and (no doubt) is a singular comfort to the most honourable, zealous, and godly minded Earle, not onely to despise and contemne their despitefull slanders, but so much the more hartily to reioyce and triumph ouer their malice, as he seeth him selfe the more impudently, and furiously assailed with their iniurious reproches.
It were too much labour, and too ill bestowed, either to reply vpon, or to repeate all the railing and slanderous speeches, which D. Allen belcheth out against his Soueraigne, her ministers, and countrey: for therein onely (in mine opinion) he seemeth to himselfe to haue best grace.
But he that will defile his owne nest (as they say) the countrey wherein he was borne and bred, calling it the Buckler of all rebellion and iniustice, and an enimie of lawfull Dominion and Superioritie, yea, he that will not sticke to rippe vp the wombe, and to teare and take out the bowels of his owne mother, he that will endeuour to bring in an inuasion, to the vtter spoyle, ruine, and depopulation of his deare countrye: what iniurie, what wickednesse, what impietye, will hee leaue vnattempted? But now will come to the second step of his ladder, wherein (hauing already sought, by defaming her Maiesties most iust honorable actio~s, to withdraw the hartes loue of her subiectes from her) he now goeth about to embolden them to disobey her, by giuing them a warrant for their disobedience, teaching that since her Maiestie was excommunicate and deposed by the Popes authoritye, there is no subiect that neede or ought, or may lawfully serue her in any case, be it otherwise neuer so lawfull.
very good doctrine (no doubt) and well agreeing with the word of God.
The holy Ghost saith, Let euery soule be subiect to the higher power: and whosoeuer resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God, and they that resist shall receiue to themselues iudgement.
And further: Submit your selues, whether it be to the king, as vnto the superiour, or vnto Gouernours, as sent by him: for so is the will of God. &c.
But these are matters out of my profession, and meeter to be argued by Diuines, and so is all this whole question touching the excommunication and deposition of Princes.
Yet because see litle Diuinitie vsed by D. Allen for the proofe of his part, but such as may easily be answered by a man of small reading, may be the bolder in briefe manner to examine his handling of this point, that you may see what he hath to say for manteinance of this seditious doctrine.
Wherein if proceede vltra crepidam (as D. Allen hath doone in dealing with Princes titles and State matters) or steppe a little out of square, humbly craue pardon of the learned Diuines, for entring into their professio~, which D. Allen doeth not of Princes, for entring into their possession.
But the lesse maruell is it that hee is so bold with Princes in that point, when he toucheth their freeholds so much neerer, in making both them, their persons, and kingdomes subiect to the Commandement, and disposing of a man of as meane qualitie (in a maner) as himselfe.
But we see God hath giuen vnto Princes authoritie and commandement ouer their Subiects, and hath willed all sorts of people, as well Ecclesiasticall, as Temporall (and consequently both D. Allen and the Pope himselfe) to submit themselues vnto Princes, to be subiect vnto them, to obey, and not to resist them, vnder paine of iudgement: let vs see then by what authoritie D. Allen can release and discharge the Subiect from his obedience, duetie, and allegeance vnto his Prince.
His first authoritie is taken from Hildebrand (whom hee calleth Gregory the seuenth) who taking vpon him more like a king of kinges, or lord of the whole world, then like a true scholler and follower of Christ, pronounceth his decree with a great Maiestie in the plurall number, We (saith he) according to our predecessours Decrees, doe assoile discharge all them that by obligation of oath, or fidelitie, are bound to persons excommunicate: and that they doe not obey such, we do expresly forbid.
His seco~d authoritie (which is euen the like) he fetcheth from Vrbanus the second, who vseth this inhibition: forbid (saith hee) the sworne soldiers of Conte Hugh, that they serue him not so long as hee standeth Excommunicate: And if they pretende their former oath made vnto him: admonish them that God is to be serued before men, and that the oth which they made to him when hee was a Christian Prince, is not now to be kept towards him, being an enemy to God and his Saints, and a breaker and contemner of their commandements.
faire paire of authorities, drawen from a couple of Popes, who had euen as good authoritie to giue these discharges and inhibitions, as D. Allen himselfe.
Is this the best warrant you haue to release the subiect of his oath and obedience to his Prince, because two Popes of your owne pack (whose whole practise hath been for these foure or fiue hundreth yeeres, to bring the heads of Princes vnder their girdles) haue, to that inte~t, pronounced it to be lawful for the subiect, to renounce his allegeance to his Prince, whensoeuer it should please his holines (forsooth) vpon any displeasure or priuate occasion (vnder pretence of some hainous crime) to Excommunicate him? What if we should deny that these Popes, or any other Pope euer had, or hath any authoritie to Excommunicate a forrein Prince, no way subiect to his charge? D. Allen hath not prooued it in his Pamphlet, nor anie where els, neither is hee able to prooue it with the helpe of all the Cardinals in Rome (yea and of the Pope himselfe too) while he liueth.
But such as are Romanists, are of another minde, and will happely beleeue D. Allens bare affirmation in this behalfe, and so may be persuaded, not onely that the Pope hath authoritie to Excommunicate and depose Princes at his pleasure, but also that the subiects of Princes so Excommunicate and deposed by the Pope, may lawfully, and ought in duetie to disobey and reuolt from their seruice.
How they may bee seduced by erroneous doctrine, know not: but for other men, that are either of sounder Religion, or men indifferent, or not so throughly, and obstinately (as vpon a meere selfewill) addicted to that faction, doubt not but they will be better aduised, then to giue credit vnto the affirmation of anie man, or the authoritie of anie Pope (though hee make himselfe more then a man) beeing directly contradictorie to the expresse word, and will of God, as hath been shewed by the places of Scripture aboue rehearsed, and by manie more may be.
But because they also shall not haue anie colour of defense left them, whereby to excuse themselues so much as vpon ignorance in this behalfe, will (since am entred into it) laie before them, in as few words as can, the abuses of D. Allen whereby hee goeth about to deceiue them in this point, and prooue directly and manifestly vnto them, that neither the Pope hath any authoritie to depose Princes from their thrones, which is the ground whereon he buildeth his warrant of reuolt: and further that it is vtterly vnlawfull for the Subiect, for any such occasion to deny the Prince the obedience, subiection, and seruice due vnto him, much more in traitorous manner to rebell against him; which D. Allen so alloweth and commendeth.
First therefore, as concerning the Popes authoritie to depose Princes, demand from whom hee hath that authoritie, whether of himselfe, or from God? Of himselfe know he will not say, for that were as great arrogancie, as absurditie in him to saie.
And if he would (as perhaps he could be content to take it vpon himselfe, if hee thought it might go for currant) yet can hee not yeeld any colour or shew of reason to mainteine it, being contrarie to the expresse word of God.
For There is no power (saith the Apostle) but of God, and the powers that be, are ordeined of God.
Then can the Pope haue no power or authoritie of himselfe, vnlesse he will affirme himselfe to be God.
And the Prince being a power, and consequently ordeined of God, it were great presumption in him to affirm, and greater blindnes in men to beleeue, that the authoritie of man can frustrate or take away the ordinance of God.
It resteth therefore, that the Pope, if he haue anie authoritie to depose Princes, he must haue it from God.
And if he haue it from God, the~ is there some warrant in his word to authorise the Pope thereunto: But there is not anie place of Scripture that giueth the Pope any expresse power to depose Princes: and therfore hath he no such authoritie from God.
For the proofe of my Minor: First it is likely, that if there were any such place of Scripture, as giueth the Pope expresse power to depose Princes, D. Allen would vndoubtedly haue alledged it, for the more credit of the cause, and not haue passed it ouer with a bare affirmation, beeing a matter heretofore by many and manifest arguments and proofes of Scripture, cleerly disprooued, and conuinced against him.
Secondly, for further confirmation thereof, reason thus: Besides the obedience and subiection which God hath commanded in the Scripture to be done vnto Princes, hee hath further forbidden all men to speake euill of the ruler of the people, or to curse the King, yea so much as in thought.
God forbiddeth all men to curse the King, yea so much as in thought, Ergo: he forbiddeth the Pope to curse the King, so much as in thought; And he that forbiddeth to doe the lesse, much more forbiddeth to doe the greater: But it is far greater to curse the K. indeed, openly, and to depriue him of his kingdome, then to curse him in thought only, or to speake euill of him: Ergo, God forbidding the Pope to speake euill of the King, or to curse him in his thought, much more forbiddeth him to curse the King openly, or to depriue him of his kingdome: wherupon it followeth by good consequence, that God doth not in any place of Scripture authorise the Pope to depose Princes: for so should he allow and warrant that in one place, which he hath forbidden in another: whereof you see what inconuenience should follow, that God should command contraries, and the Scriptures should bee repugnant to themselues, which were plaine Atheisme to affirm.
Whereby it maie be cleare and manifest vnto euerie man, that hath any sense of Christianitie in him, that God hauing in these former places of Scripture expresly forbidden all men to curse in thought, or to speake euill of the King, much more to curse him openly or to bereaue him of his kingdome, doeth not therefore in anie place of Scripture admit or authorise anie man (contrarie to this inhibition) to curse, excommunicate, and depose Princes out of their kingdomes.
For that were to countermand his owne commandements, and to shew himselfe variable, inconstant, repugnant to himselfe, which were high impietie for anie man to imagine.
Thus you see (beside the presumption, which is to be gathered out of D. Allens own dealing, in that hee alledgeth no place of Scripture to warrant the Popes depriuing of Princes, that it is therfore likely that no place of Scripture doth authorise him thervnto) you see it (I say) directly proued by sound and substantiall argume~t, (as by many more also might be verie aboundantly, if either the cause required proofe, or if it were my purpose to stand vpon the confirmation of that, which is of itselfe so manifest) that the Pope neither hath, nor can haue anie expresse authoritie, giuen him directly by the word of God to depose Princes: which is the thing that God reserueth wholy to himselfe: for it is he (not the Pope) that deposeth the mighty from their seat, exalteth them that are low: it is he (not the Pope) that putteth downe kings, setteth vp kings, and giueth kingdomes to whomsoeuer he will.
For God hath ordeined Princes to rule his people, and to represent his own Maiestie amongst them, which cannot be subiect to any earthly creature: as he hath put all men in subiection vnder them (as his own Vicegerents on Earth) so hath he subiected the~ vnto none, but onely and immediatly to himselfe.
Which supreme authoritie of Princes next vnder God, howsoeuer D. Allen doth maliciously and wickedly impugne, yet the Church of Christ hath euer confessed confirmed it, as appeareth by the sentences of the holie Fathers and Doctors of the Church touching that point.
Colimus imperatorem saith Tertullian) vt homine~ a Deo secundum, solo Deo minorem: we worship the Emperour, as a man next vnto God, inferiour to God only.
And againe, Deum esse solum, in cuius solius potestate sunt, quo sunt secundi, post quem primi, ante omnes super omnes Deos homines: That it is God onely, in whose power alone Princes are, to whom they are second, and after whom they are first, before all, and ouer all both Gods and men.
Optatus in like sort saith: Super Imperatorem non est nisi solus Deus qui fecit Imperatorem: There is none aboue the Emperour but onely God, who made the Emperour.
And Chrysostome saith: Parem vllum super terram non habet: The Emperour hath no equall on earth.
And Gregory affirmeth further, That power is giuen to Princes from heauen ouer all men, not only soldiers, but Priests.
If Princes then (by the iudgement of the old learned Fathers and Doctors of the Church, whose names D. Allen doeth more boast of, then alledge their testimonies) bee in authoritie next vnto God, inferior to him only, superiors to all men; and if there be none aboue the Prince, but onely God who made the Prince: the Pope must of necessitie either presume himselfe to be God, els can he not be aboue the Prince, or at the least make himselfe no man, but a monster, otherwise must he needes be inferiour to the Prince.
And if the Prince haue no equall on earth: the Pope must either acknowledge himselfe to bee vnder the Prince, or els not to bee at all.
And if power be giuen vnto Princes from heauen ouer all men, not only soldiers, but Priestes also: then cannot the Pope (whether hee bee soldier, or Priest, or whatsoeuer hee be, so hee be a man) exempt himselfe fro~ that power, which God hath giuen vnto the Prince ouer him: much les can he take away from Princes that power, which God hath giuen vnto them.
For the power of setting vp and putting downe Princes (being in Maiestie the greatest on earth, and proper to God himselfe alone) hath he not imparted vnto anye earthly creature, either absolutely from himhimselfe, or iointly with himselfe, but hath reserued it wholy to himselfe.
But because D. Allen is so much more deuoted vnto the Pope then to God, as that he can bee content to pull out of Gods hand his peculiar authority and prerogatiue, to draw the same wholy vnto the Pope, by what meanes he careth not, right, or wrong, and (the more to augment the iniurie) will needes make Gods own word a warrant to robbe himselfe of his honour, and right: hauing already shewed that he cannot by anye meanes directly drawe from God vnto the Pope, the authoritie of deposing Princes, will lay before you also the indirect meanes he vseth in this pamphlet, to accomplish his intent, and how litle they also serue his turne.
What he cannot proue by sentence of Scripture, he laboureth (by the way) to induce by example: as namely by the mention of the vsurping Queene Athalia, the wicked King Ahab, and cursed Iesabell, who were all (as he seemeth to intend) deposed from their kingdomes and slaine: because the Priestes and Prophets of God did therein giue assistance, counsell, or direction, he woulde hereupon faine inferre, that the Pope may by these examples take away both the crownes and liues of princes.
An argument farre fet, in truth, and sauouring more of malice then of substance.
For, the comparison of her Maiestie vnto an vsurper, or to wicked Idolaters, is as odious and vnproper, as the resemblance of the Pope to the holy Prophets, is vnfitte and vnequall.
Wherin must note vnto you by the way an euill spirite in D. Allen, that seeketh (or rather snatcheth) all opportunities to spit forth his venim against so gratious a princesse.
But let vs leaue his vice vpon himselfe, and looke in to the vertue of his argument.
Athalia, was lawfully deposed from the kingdom, and slaine, by the authoritie of Ioiada the high priest: Ergo the Pope hath authority both to depose, and procure the death of the Queenes Maiestie: (For that is it, that D. Allen doth as earnestly labour to iustify, as the Pope doth diligently endeuour to atchieue:) but trust the Pope shall faile asmuch of his wicked intent, as the Doctor faileth in his weake argument.
Whereof, to speake first of the whole, doe vtterly deny his consequent.
For neither is it to be graunted him, that the Popes authority is as great against the Queenes Maiestie, as Ioiadaes was against Athalia: neither is her Maiesties case like to Athaliaes: of both which will make plaine demonstration.
First concerning Ioiada, as he was high priest, so was he also the Priace of his tribe, and thereby had more authoritie to deale in the state of that kingdome, then the Pope can haue to deale in a forreine kingdome.
And for Athalia, she was an vsurper, who came to the crowne by killing the kinges children, all sauing one, whom Ioiada kept secret and saued from her furie, vntill he had the meanes to restore him to his kingdome, by suppressing the vsurper.
But it is very well knowne, that the Queenes Maiestie is no vsurper, but a lawfull Prince, neither came to the crowne by any such wicked meanes, but by due right of inheritaunce: So is there as great oddes betwixt her case and Athaliaes, as betweene the authority of Ioiada, and of the Pope: And the cases being vnlike, the consequent cannot be good.
For though an vsurper may lawfully be deposed, and slaine, yet it followeth not therefore that a rightfull Prince may: and though the chiefe Princes and States of a countrey vnited together, may aide and assist the lawfull King to place him in his throne, and to put downe the vsurper: yet doth it not follow, that a priest, which is a meere straunger to the countrie, may therefore thrust a lawfull Prince out of his kingdome.
And as little reason as there is in his consequent, so litle truth is there in the antecedent.
For neither was Athalia deposed and slaine by Ioiada himselfe, neither by his authority (much lesse by the authority of his priesthood:) For he did not in any sort take the matter, or the authority vpon himselfe, but what he did, he did by the common consent of the Nobles and Capteines, whom (as the text saith) before he would attempt any thing, he caused to come vnto him into the house of the Lord, and made a couenant with the~, and tooke an oth of them in the house of the Lord, shewed them the kinges sonne, After which consent and couenant accorded amongst them, hauing disposed an order for the proclaiming and establishing of Ioash (the young rightfull king) whom he had so saued from the massacre, hee brought him forth (as the text saith) and put the Crowne vpon him, and gaue him the testimonie, and têhy made him king: And when Athalia hearing the noise of the running of the people, came in, and cryed treason, treason: the text saith, thêy layd handes on her and she went by the way, by which the horses go to the house of the king, and there was shee slaine.
So it appeareth by the very text itselfe, that Athalia was neither deposed nor slaine by Ioiada, nor by his authority, but by the Nobles whole state of the countrey, and by the authoritye of the rightfull king, whom they firstcrowned, annointed, and proclaimed: neither did Ioiada any thing in the matter, more then duety, nature, and conscience moued him vnto, to present vnto the nobles and fathers of Israell, the kinges sonne whom he had saued, and to further the restoring of him to his right, being the king his maisters sonne, and neerest allyed vnto him, and (especially) right heire to the kingdome: None authoritie did hee take vpon himselfe therein, especially in respect of his priesthood.
Thus you see how little this example of of the vsurping Queene Athalia serueth D. Allens turne to proue the Popes authority to depose Princes.
And for the other of Ahab, Iesabell, they proue euen as much.
For if D. Allen meane Ahab himselfe, touching his owne person: he was neither depriued of his kingdome nor slaine by any priest or prophet, but died king of Israell, and was slaine in the field fighting against the king of Aram, about Ramoth Gilead.
But if he meane the sonnes and whole house of Ahab, which were destroyed by Iehu, D. Allen abuseth both himselfe and you very much, to tell you that they were deposed and destroyed either by Priest or Prophet: for it was Iehu (the king of Israell that slue Iehoram, and smote the house of Ahab, and caused Iesabell to be cast out of the window.
But (saith D. Allen) Iehu receiued authority and commission so to do, from Eliseus the prophet: therefore the Pope may giue (and consequently hath himselfe) authoritie to depose and kill Princes.
deny your antecedent (M. Doctor:) For it is most false that Iehu receiued authority from Eliseus (as you seeme to intend he did from Elias, mistaking either the man, or the matter, in your defense of the English Catholike to put downe the sonne and whole house of Ahab: for the Prophet which was sent by Eliseus vnto Iehu to annoynt him, neuer spake word of Eliseus to him, much lesse deliuered him any authority from Eliseus, but deliuered his message expressely from God, beginning with, Thus saith the Lord God of Israell, &c: not, Thus saith Eliseus.
So was it the authority of God (and not of a Prophet) wherby the house of Ahab, and Iesabel were put downe slaine; neither was priest or prophet the doer, but Iehu the king of Israell, whom God had by speciall commandement appointed to depose and smite them, being himself before annoynted king in their place by the same commandement.
Now if D. Allen will hereupon gather any argument to mainteine the same authority in the Pope, to depose destroy princes, he nust needs make him equall in authority with God: which neither Christian, Iew, nor Pagan, will in reason allow vnto any mortall creature.
Now for his other example of k. Saul, wherby he goeth about to inferre, that as Samuel deposed Saul, so the Pope may depose Princes: it doth not onely make nothing at all for his purpose, but is also most forcible against himselfe, as shall bee most plainely declared vnto you.
For whereas first he assumeth it as a thing most true and certeine, that Samuel deposed Saul, he vtterlye mistaketh, or rather most wickedly belyeth the holy historie in this, as he hath done in the others: For the Scripture saith, that God rebuked Samuel for mourning for Saul, that God had reiected him from reigning ouer Israel.
Whereby it appeareth manifestly, that although Samuel in this place (as the rest of the prophets in other places) did by Gods expresse commaundement denounce the sentence of deposition; yet was it not Samuel but God himselfe, that deposed Saule from his kingdome, to the great griefe of Samuel.
So is D. Allens argument cleane ouerthrowne in this example aswell as in the former, vnlesse he will conclude, that the Pope hath in himselfe as much authority, as God himselfe; which thinke he would not greatly sticke to affirme, if he thought he might be belieued: for he maketh it not dainty to dubbe that which is as false, in saying that the prophets deposed Princes.
So little regard hath he either of God, or man, so that he may bring his purpose to effect.
But let vs look further into this example, and we shall see how farre it setteth him beside the saddle.
Albeit Saule was thus deposed by God himselfe, and Dauid annointed king in his place by Gods owne precise commandement, yet did Samuell thereupon euer go about to depriue him of his kingdome, or encourage the people to reuolt from him, and disobey him? Or did the people themselues stir against him so long as he liued? Or did Dauid which was the annointed king in his place, euer offer to thrust him out of the kingdome, or seeke his life? No: Saul reigned many yeares after that, and the people both obeyed and serued him.
Yea and Dauid himselfe when he might haue slaine him in the Caue, and so haue gotten also the present possession of the kingdom to himselfe, yet he would not, nay he thought it a sinne for him to haue done it: For who (said he) can laye his hand on the Lordes annointed, and be guiltlesse? Yea, percusso corde trepidauit (saith S. Augustine.
he was stroken, and trembled at the heart, because hee had cut but the lappe of Saules coate.
And in th'end when word was brought him of Saules death, how rewarded he the messenger, pray you, for his tydings, and for the Crowne and Bracelet of Saule, which hee brought him? Forsooth he caused him to bee slaine forthwith in his presence, saying: How wast thou not afraid to put forth thine hand to destroye the Lords annointed? Thy bloud be vpo~ thine own head, for thine own mouth hath witnessed against thee, saying, haue slaine the Lords annointed.
Thus you see Saul a wicked King deposed, not by a Pope, nor by a Priest, nor by a Prophet, but by God himselfe, and Dauid chosen and appointed by God, and anointed in his place: and yet neither the Prophet euer counselled or mooued the people to disobey Saul, being so deposed, nor the people euer offered to reuolt or to deny him their obedience seruice, nor Dauid (the true and rightfull king appointed by God in his place) euer sought or co~se~ted to depriue him of the kingdome, though due vnto himselfe, but (notwithstanding he knew him to be his deadly enemy and to hunt after his life) yet hauing him twice in his hands, where he might safely haue slaine him, and therby inuested himselfe of the kingdom, neuerthelesse wold he neither touch him himselfe, nor suffer any other to touch him, calling him the Lords annointed, and esteeming it a high sin to laie his hand on him, though hee were deposed by God himselfe: and (which is yet most notable) caused the messenger, that brought him the first newes of his death, to be forthwith slaine for his labour.
And all this notwithstanding, yet is not D. Allen ashamed to wrest this example quite contrarie to the trueth, for a president to prooue that the Pope hath authoritie to depose and depriue Princes both of their kingdomes and liues, and to release discharge the subiects of their allegeance: and further, that it is lawfull for subiects to reuolt from their Souereignes, to yeeld vp their holdes trecherously vnto their enemies, and to beare armes against them.
To which doctrine hee could not haue found in all the whole Scriptures (though all bee flat against it) anie one example more directlie contrarie then this: the iudgement whereof referre to the reason, consideration, and conscience of all men that haue anie sparke of Christianitie, morall vertue, or naturall reason in them.
Now then, if none of all these examples of Scripture, which D. Allen hath cited to prooue the Popes authoritie to depose Princes, doe shew that anie of those Princes, whom he mencioneth, was deposed either by Priest or Prophet (as hee falslie assumeth) but by God himselfe: how can hee then inferre vpon these examples, that the Pope hath anie such authoritie, vnlesse hee attribute (as said before) as much authoritie vnto him, as to God himselfe? And if Saul being deposed by God himselfe) yet neither the Prophet did thereupon disswade the people from obeying him, nor the people once offered to reuolt from him, but continued in all duetie and obedience towardes him as long as he liued, which was manie yeeres after his deposition: and if Dauid, beeing the lawfull annointed King in his place, yet neither sought to put him out of the kingdome, but yeelded him obedience and seruice (calling him Lord maister) during his life, thought it sin to laie his hand on him, notwithstanding he was deposed: lastly, in token of the misliking and displeasure he tooke at the death of Saul, caused the messenger that brought him the tidings thereof, to be slaine: how can D. Allen by this example induce men of anie reason or sense to beleeue, that either the Pope maie lawfully authorise, encourage, or exhort subiects to disobey, or to laie hands on the Lords annointed, or that anie subiect may lawfully renounce his allegeance, reuolt, from, and beare armes against his Souereigne, beeing a lawfull Prince, onelie vpon a colourable warrant of deposition, by a man, a Priest, a stranger, who hath no authoritie in the worlde to depose anie Prince from his kingdome (no, though hee were an Infidel) but is himselfe euen by Gods ordinance a subiect to Princes? With what face can hee vtter such manifest vntruthes? with what confidence can hee persuade himselfe to bee beleeued, when his lies are so monstrous, and his impostures so euident? But most of all, with what conscience can hee presume to force the word of God to his purpose, which is so directly against him? But hereby may all men plainely perceiue how small regard that sect hath vnto religion, but onlie to serue their turnes, which are not ashamed to make such impudent and vngodly shiftes, to maintein their vsurped authoritie.
Call you this holines, M. D. to abuse the people with false doctrine, to belie the scriptures, to peruert the most sacred word of God, to rob him of his own peculiar authoritie and prerogatiue, for the defence and furtherance of your owne rebellious practises? In trueth it resembleth much the holines of your holie thiefe, whom it pleaseth you somewhat merrily in your Pamphlet to compare vnto vs, but in truth a righter patterne of your own profession: which (to speake truely what thinke in my conscience) is much discredited by your owne double dealing.
You your selfe, to further your owne purpose (as you supposed) could prefixe before your Pamphlet euen in the first page, as a sentence vnder the title thereof, the resolution giuen by Christ, vpon the tempting demand of the Pharisees, Reddite quae sunt Caesaris, Caesari: wherein Christ himselfe commandeth all men to giue vnto Caesar (that is to the King and Ciuill Magistrate) whatsoeuer is due vnto him, that is feare, honor, subiection, and tribute: And how dare you then, euen in the same Pamphlet countermaund this commandement of our Sauiour, bending all your forces, craft, and cunning to persuade the subiect to resist his Souereigne, and thereby to break this high and peremptorie commandement? But you saie the Pope hath authoritie to discharge the subiect of this duetie and obedience, which is here commanded.
Shew me then, praie you, some Text of Scripture, that giueth the Pope so large Commission as you speake of: nay, shew me anie dispensation out of Gods word, that may exempt you, or the Pope himselfe out of the compasse of this commandement.
For the precept is generall, and therefore extendeth to all men, and besides, was expresly giuen by Christ vnto his Disciples, to whom hee spake in presence.
And if the Pope and you bee the Disciples of Christ, as you would seeme to bee, then must you also (as well, or rather then others) yeeld obedience and subiection to your Ciuill gouernours, or els fall into the breach of Christs commandement.
And if you bee subiect to the ciuill Magistrate, as you are by this rule of Christ: how can you take that authoritie from them, which Christ hath giuen them ouer you? If you saie there is no subiection due vnto them, longer then they continue in the truth of Religion: pray you tell mee first, how prooue you them to be heretikes, vnlesse you your selues may be Iudges? Will you then both condemne and punish them, before they bee conuicted of crime? and will you that are parties, bee both iudges, and executors of your owne will and pleasure? Secondly, suppose they were (as you vniustly condemne them to be) heretikes, yea suppose they were Iewes, Turkes, Heathens: yet is there neuertheles obedience and subiection due vnto them.
For what was Caesar himselfe, but a Heathen? what were the Princes in the Aposties times (of whom it is said, Let euerie soule be subiect vnto them: and whosoeuer resisteth them, resisteth the ordinance of God what were they all, but Heathens? If Christ himselfe then hath confirmed the authoritie and power euen of Heathen Princes: how can the Pope dissolue and take away the authoritie, power, kingdom, yea life too, of Christian Princes? And yet he claimeth his authoritie from Christ, as his Disciple, and Vicar here on earth: by which title he maketh all Princes subiect vnto his authoritie.
In truth so is the greatest Prince liuing, subiect vnto the meanest Preacher and Minister of God, to obey the doctrine and word, which hee deliuereth out of the Scriptures, and to receiue his instruction, exhortation, admonition, and reproofe: yet is hee not (though he should reiect his instructions) to be therefore deposed from his kingdome, or resisted and disobeyed by him.
And greater authoritie hath not the Pope himselfe ouer anie Prince, then the meanest Minister and messenger of God.
finde not in all the Scripture that euer Christ gaue vnto his Disciples anie Commission to depose Princes, although they should disobey his word: but finde that he gaue them Commission to Preach: And whosoeuer shuld not receiue them, nor heare their words, he bad them, that when they should depart out of that house or Citie, they should shake the dust of their feete, reseruing the punishment of them vnto God.
As for the superioritie which the Pope challengeth ouer Princes, as the Successor of Peter, disciple of Christ: finde no such Commission giuen vnto Peter himselfe, to authorise him in such sort ouer Princes: but finde that Christ said vnto him three times, Feede my sheepe.
As for the swoord (wherby is signified the Ciuil Authoritie) Christ expresly forbad Peter to vse it, commanding him to put it vp into the sheath.
To the same effect also spake he not only to Peter, but to all the rest of his fellowes the Apostles, when there was some contention risen amongst them about superioritie: Ye know (saith hee) that the Lords of the Gentiles haue domination ouer them, and they that are great, exercise authoritie ouer them: But it shall not be so among you: But whosoeuer will be great among you, let him be your seruant.
And if the Pope bee Christs Disciple, hee must learne this lesson of his Maister, to be a seruant to his fellows, not a Commander of Kings.
Christ himselfe, from whom the Pope deriueth his supreme authoritie, as his Vicar on Earth, neuer tooke vpon him the authoritie to depriue Princes of their kingdoms, nor to discharge the subiects of their dutie obedience: but contrariwise confirmed the power of Princes both by his doctrine (teaching that Feare, Honor, Obedience, Subiection is due euen to Heathen Princes and also by his owne example, yeelding tribute, with all duetie and obedience vnto them, and submitting himselfe, his bodie, and life to their authoritie, iudgement correctio~: And for himself professed that his king do~ was not of this world, that he came not to be serued, but to serue.
And if Christ acknowledged himselfe not to haue any kingly authoritie in this world, but to be a subiect vnto kings to their inferior officers and a seruant: how can the Pope deriue vnto himself from Christ not onlie a kingly authoritie, but a predominant authoritie ouer all kings? Can the scholler bee greater then his Maister? will the Vicar take vpon him more authoritie, then hee, from whom he taketh all his authoritie? Nay, will he of himselfe presume to giue warrant directly co~trarie to the commandement of Christ? Let euerie man then iudge, both what he is, that so opposeth him self against Christ, what D. Allen is, that iustifieth his so doing, (for iustification thereof, pretendeth warrant of Scriptures against God himselfe: which how shamefully he hath therin wrested, peruerted, and belied, hath been (I hope) alreadie sufficiently declared vnto you, so far forth as his pamphlet gaue occasion, and farther should haue been, but that this question is handled at large, and all that D. Allen can say therein, abundantly confuted by a learned Diuine, a man of as great sufficiencie, and of more sinceritie then himselfe, in the answere to his Defense of English Catholikes.
Now to come to the matter, and to the prosecuting of D. Allens purpose, you see that hee hath not onlie failed in the proofe of the Popes authoritie to depose Princes, and consequently of his warrant for the subiects reuolt: but also his own examples and arguments retorted against himselfe, and the contrarie part prooued both by them, and by diuers other reasons, and authorities of Scriptures: out of which Doctor Allen bringeth not so much as one Text (in trueth, must confesse, because he cannot, vnlesse hee should coyne it himselfe) to proue directly his prophane assertions.
So that no man can be so blind, but he must needes perceiue and acknowledge, that the Pope hath neither power of himselfe, nor authority from God, to depose Princes from their kingdomes: neither can giue to the subiect any commissio~, or licence (sauing only that licence which he hath himselfe, that is, that licence qua sumus omnes deteriores so much as to disobey their Souereignes, much lesse to reuolte from them to their enimies, to lay handes on them, to beare armes against them.
Whereby it cannot but bee most apparant that D. Allen respected wholye herein the subtilty of his drifte, not the soundnes of his doctrine, and for the obteinment of credit, and attainment of his purpose thereby, affied him selfe altogither vpon the smoothnes of his perswasions, and the affectionate mindes and inclinations of his adherents.
ANd sithens we haue alreadie discouered the foundation of his perswasions to bee weake, false, and rotten: it shall not be amisse to bestowe a little labour, to trie if a small wind will not ouerthrow the building it selfe, which doubt not but we shall find to be patched togither of as rotten stuffe, and of as slender substance as the foundation is, and to haue nothing in it to withstand the weather, but onely the bare outside and colour of religion.
The ende whereunto this perswasion of disobedience, and reuolte from her Maiestie, tendeth, hath bene alreadie declared; namely the furtherance of all trayterous and rebellious designementes that may be by any person, or in any wise attempted against her Maiestie, and particularly the assistance of the k. of Spaine, and the other forreine forces inuasion, nowe presently intended, and prepared against our countrey.
Let vs then next see to what persons D. Allen principally purposeth and addresseth his persuasions.
First for Protestants, and such as are of sound Religion (as trust the greatest parte of England, by great ods, is) D. Allen cannot be so madde as to hope, that his perswasions can haue any authoritie, or worke any effect with them, but to confirme them rather in her Maiesties seruice and obedience, for the better mayntenaunce of their Religion, and defence of themselues and their goods: which they know, if the contrarie faction should preuaile (which God trust will neuer suffer) not onely th'estate of Religion were cleane ouerthrowne, but themselues also, and all theirs prostrate to the sword, rapine and spoile, which it sitteth them neerest, with all their force, might, maine, to defend.
As for such as are neither Protestants, nor Papists, but men indifferent, or of no religion at all, and (as D. Allen termeth them) plaine Atheists, into which estate he most slanderouslye in his pamphlet reporteth our countrey to bee falne, but trust, and do fully assure my selfe, that hee shall find fewer of that sort in England than in Rome, though the scope be far larger: his perswasion (in mine opinion) shoulde doe but litle good (or harme) with them: First, by his owne reason, being drawne from Religion, how can it worke with them that are of no religion, and therefore regard not Religion? And if they be men indifferent, and such as maye by reading, instruction, and exhortation bee drawne alike to the embracing of either religion: what reason hath D. Allen to thinke, that his perswasions should rather draw them to his religion, then the continuall preaching teaching of a great number of our godly ministers (men as learned and more zealous then D. Allen should winne them to ours? Or why should hee imagine, that they shoulde more easily bend vnto a blind and superstitious religion grounded vpon ignorance, then to a cleere and perspicuous religion, grounded vpon knowledge of the truth, vnlesse he presume vpon the corruption of mens nature, which is more inclined to euil, the~ to good? But neither of these sorts of men are the persons, vnto whom D. Allen purposely inte~ded his perswasions: for the matter requireth hearers more affected and assured to his faction: howsoeuer he might happely put it in aduenture to seduce others, such as were apt to be defiled with his pitch, being all but one labour to him.
But hope this shall not bee the last labour that such brokers of mischiefe shall spend in vaine.
They must needes bee therefore of your owne fraternity M. Doctor men sworne to the Popes pantofle, with whom your wholsome perswasions must preuaile: who (I trust) when they come to the tale, will not bee so many by two partes of the three, as you presume.
But such and so many as they are, do you thinke them so simple or sottish, as to bee bewitched by your enchauntments, to respect more your tromperie, then their own oth, alleageance and duety? But the Pope hath discharged them of all duety, you say: But they see the contrarie proued against you.
But whatsoeuer they see, you do happely assure your selfe, they will see nothing against you: But good M. Doctor charme them not so blinde, but that you giue them leaue to see, what counsell you giue them against themselues.
Your wordes are weightie and forcible with them in other cases, but their owne weale and safety is much deerer vnto them in this case.
They see the dealings of the Duke of G. and the rest of the holy league in France: who, though they pretend the quarrell and patronage of the pretended Catholike Religion, yet spare they neither Catholike person, nor place, but vse all violence, spoile, and sackage of such townes as are meere Catholike, and of Catholikes goods, without fauour or difference: Wherein as they haue shewed the~selues (co~formably to your doctrine) very obseruant of ciuill Iustice, in vsing little partialitie, or respect of persons: so haue they bewrayed their intent (answerable to your pollicy) to be the wreake of priuate malice, the disturbance of the publike peace, and the ambition of a kingdome, shadowed onely with the colour of their Catholike Religion.
In so much as some of the greatest and best Catholikes of that sort, which of zeale were entred into that confederacy: besides many others most earnestly and sincerely affected to that religion, finding at length their disguised purposes, haue already cleane abandoned that partie, and reuolted to the contrarie.
And do you imagine, our English Romanists so besotted with your Siren songs, as that they will take no heede to themselues by th'examples of others their neighbours? Yes, doubt you not, they will forecast all euents that may happen, consider what is most likely to happen, and seeke their owne safety whatsoeuer happen.
They know, if they should but offer to stir towards a forreine enimies partie, against their owne countrey, if we get the vpper hand (as we faithfully assure our selues, God being on our side) they loose all they haue, both goods, landes, and liues too, like traytors, as they well deserue.
On the otherside, if th'enimie shold preuaile (which we little doubt, and God, trust, will neuer permit) what protection shall they haue by their Catholike Religion? They see the pretended Catholike armies in France, spare not the like Catholikes being their owne countreymen; what fauour can English Catholikes then expect of a forreine army? especially of the Spanish souldiour, who in the opinion and report of those nations which haue felt his furie, and endured his yoake, is very hardly thought of, and almost infamous for his pride, insolence, crueltie, rauishments, and such like kindes of violence, without regard of estate, religion, decree, or calling, wheresoeuer he getteth the maistry? And if these be his natural properties generally to all men, how much more will malice augment his furie towards our nation, to whom the very name of an English man is no lesse odious for the enuie of our vertue, and valour, then the the name of a Spaniard is vnto vs, for the report of his vice, and insolencie? Small fauour or curtesie (God wot) is an Englishman to hope for at a Spaniards hand, be he neuer so Catholike.
The Spanish souldiour, where he is lord, neuer vseth to aske (or to heare) whose wife is this? whose daughter, whose sister, whose house or goods these are: Catholikes wife, daughter, house, goods, are as sweete to him, as another mans.
And what pleasure would this be to an English man, whatsoeuer his religion be, to see his wife forced, his sisters rauished, his daughters deflowred, his house sacked, his goods pilled and spoyled by a stranger before his face? yea, and his own throat cut, if he but offer to make defense? Such is the fury and violence of the soldiour, especially of the Spaniard.
What auaileth him then the name of a Catholike, if it please the lyon in his rauening mood, to take the hare for an asse, because hee hath long eares? To whom shal his headlesse body complaine for redresse? And is this the goodwill you beare to your brethren and Catholike countreymen M. Doctor that you would allure them to the bringing in of their own assured calamity, vtter ouerthrow? They loue yôu better, am perswaded, yet not so well, as to cast away themselues, and all theirs, at your request counsell.
They are professors of your religion, but wil be no partakers of your rebellion.
They like to be of your fraternity, but not of your conspiracie.
They can be content to heare your doctrine: but you must be content to let the~ prefer their own safety.
They see Religion is not the quarrell, that can stir vp forrein forces to an inuasion, with such terrible threatnings of vtter rasing and depopulation of themselues and their countrey, but meere malice and reuenge of priuate grudges, with a greedy thirst after the spoile and sacking of a rich and plentifull countrey.
They could wish with all their hartes that the Catholike Religion might preuayle and florish in their countrey: but they will striue with hart and hand both to defend their owne liues, and liberties, and the weale freedome of their countrey, which they see are al assaulted, all in perill, all likely to be lost, if forreine powers should get the conquest of their countrey.
Is this then so easie a matter thinke you, M. Doctor, to perswade your Catholike countreymen vnto? For mine own part, am of another mind, so shal you find the~ also, doubt not, if euer the matter come to triall.
For, admit they bare so malicious minds towards her Maiestie, as you giue good cause to suspect, yet they are English men, and if they beare English hearts in their bodies, they wil neuer endure a stranger, much lesse an enimy, especially so insolent, cruell, and intollerable an enimy, to tyra~nise ouer their cou~trey.
And if they were so void of al duety, piety, humanity, good nature, manhood, as to betray their liege Souereigne, abandon the defense of their deere countrey, to abiect their minds, honor, reputation, subiect their names to euerlasting infamie: yet that inward working of naturall loue, affection, care of themselues, their wiues, their children, their parents, and kinred, yea of their own liues, liberties, (which lye al vpo~ the stake) wil be continually knocking at their bosomes, at their heads, at their harts, to stir them vp to the withstanding of their own calamities.
But as we haue considered somewhat of the persons, whom D. Allen chiefely goeth about to perswade by this pamphlet: so let vs now examin a litle the force and weight of his persuasions.
After a long dehortation of the Q. Maiesties liege subiectes from her seruice in these warres, (which it pleaseth him to terme vniust) and persuasion to them to reuolt vnto the other side, for Religio~s sake, with diuers circumstances tending wholy to that purpose, wherein he vseth onlie his owne authoritie for reason: amongst the rest, to mooue them thereunto the rather by examples, he citeth out of Eusebius, How for refusing to commit Idolatry by sacrificing vnto Idols, and in particular for disobeying the Emperour Maximinus his commandement therein, the famous Colonell S. Maurice with the whole legion of Thebes, susteined most glorious martyrdome.
As diuers others did vnder Iulian the Apostata, and the like: And many noble soldiers, for that they could not exercise their Christian vsages, partly were driuen to abandon their profession in displeasure of their Princes, and partly were licenced to depart: &c. Marke, praie you, the force of these examples, and how well they serue the purpose, for which D. Allen citeth them.
We see not by them, that anie of all these valiant Christian Soldiers, whom he mencioneth, did euer reuolt from the Princes whom they serued, or take armes against them; which is the purpose whereunto they are cited: but rather, that to auoide superstition, and the abhominable seruice of Idols, they forsooke their profession, their Countries, yea and their liues also, before they woulde offer to reuolt to their Princes enemies.
They were Soldiers, and were vrged to forsake the true God to commit Idolatry, yet rather endured death then they would offer to reuolt from a Heathen Prince, notwithstanding hee would haue enforced them to renounce Christ: And yet M. Allen goeth about by these examples, to persuade subiects, to Rebell against their naturall Prince, beeing a Christian, neither compelling, nor commanding them to forsake God, but endeuouring by all good godly means to draw them to the true knowledge and worship of God, from the blindnes of superstition and Idolatrie.
Is not this a straunge thing, to see a man so learned, as hee is esteemed to be, so much to ouershoote himselfe, in offering such euident abuses, to seduce those with whom his credit may preuaile? Yet hath he another argument as fit for his purpose as this, whererein hee encourageth the English Catholikes, and such as are pliable to his persuasions, to reuolt from her Maiesties seruice vnto the pretended Catholike partie, by mention of the great victories and happie successe, which God giueth vnto those, that with their armes vphold and mainteine the true Religion, declaring also that God fighteth himselfe for the defense of his owne cause and of the right, which (in mine opinion) can bee no encouragement, but ought rather to be a great terror to the English Romanists, for enterprising to take armes against their gracious Souereigne.
For first looking into home examples of the like sort, within their owne memorie, they know what befell vnto the two late Earles of Northumberland, and Westmerland, and the rest of that rebellious faction: who hauing entred into the like conspiracie, and for the like cause that D. Allen now so much recommendeth vnto his Catholike Countreymen, and hauing made a verie strong partie, in seuerall partes of the Realme, and sodeinly raised a great power of the greatest strength of the North of England, were notwithstanding by the prouidence and assistance of God (for it is hee onelie that giueth victorie, not the strength of man, or of Horse) within verie short time ouerthrowen, dispersed, and scattered, the most and principallest of the Ringleaders taken, and executed according to their desert, and the rest driuen to abandon their Countrey, and to liue abroad like outcasts and vagabonds.
They remember likewise since that time what became of the Romish Catholike Forces (whom before mencioned) which landed in Ireland in the yeere who as they came in defense of the same cause, and of the same Religion, so found they euen the same encounter, in so much as few of them (I thinke) returned home, to boast or make report of their victorie.
If then this position of D. Allens persuasion bee true (as it is most true) that God fighteth for the defense of true Religion, and of the right: the English Catholikes, and all men els, may see by these examples, that the cause was naught and vniust, and the Religion corrupt and false, in the defense whereof these armies were so discomfited: may likewise bee warned by their successe, to take heed how for the like cause they enter into the like action.
Secondly, the examples which D. Allen reciteth of the ouerthrows, which haue happened vnto the K. of Spaines Rebels (as hee termeth them) in the low Countries: what doe they els but admonish all English men to beware, how they rebell or stirre in armes against their lawfull Souereigne; seeing ouerthrow and confusion threatened as a iust recompence of rebellion? And if our English Romanists, or anie other whosoeuer, her Maiesties naturall subiects, will but duely and vprightly consider of these arguments, though brought by D. Allen to a contrarie purpose: doubt not but they may bee thereby sufficiently dissuaded and discouraged, from all such wicked and vnnaturall attempts.
But, because this Pamphlet of D. Allens (is as we haue shewed you) altogither politike, tending not so much to the defense of the action which he pretendeth, as to a further purpose, which haue also discouered herein: it shall bee no great labour to me, but some reproofe to him, to note in a word or two, before make an ende, some ouersights euen in pollicie, escaped this great politicien, euen in this small Pamphlet, which is nothing els but a packet of politike driftes, composed for a preparatiue vnto mischiefe.
And first to beginne with the whole argument of his persuasion, affirming it to be lawfull for the subiect in cause of Religion to reuolt from his Souereigne: what doeth it els but giue warrant and defense to the people of the low Countries in resisting the King of Spaine, (though he were, as D. Allen supposeth him to bee) their lawfull and vndoubted Souereigne, and consequently to the actions of all such, as hitherto haue, or hereafter shall yeeld them anie succours or assistance against him? For it is well knowen, that the first and principall matter, wherewith they founde themselues agreeued, was the restraint of Religion, for that they might not freely vse and enioy the libertie of their consciences vnder him.
Which beeing the true ancient Catholike, and Apostolike Religion, clensed from the dregges and superstition of the Romish Church, it was and is lawfull for the people of those Countries (by Doctor Allens position) for defense of that Religion to take armes against the King of Spaine, though hee were their rightfull king, and consequently for vs, or anie other, in that lawfull quarrell to assist them.
Thus the policie which D. Allen contriueth to impeach vs one way, is not only a defense vnto vs in the principall cause, which he impugneth, but as great an impeachment to his owne Patrone.
Another ouersight in policie, which note in Doctor Allens Pamphlet, is, that in the whole discourse throughout, wheresoeuer he speaketh of the people of the low Countreys, hee termeth them Rebels and Heretikes: which termes, as they cannot but bee verie scandalous to the people, so may they bee verie preiudiciall to the K. of Spaine, whose partie he so much fauoureth.
For where the Duke of Parma hath long endeuoured, and still doth, by such factors and secret practisers, as he hath among the States of the countries, to win them by faire meanes and inticements to the obedience subiection of the K. of Spaine: what a hindrance may this be to that practise, whe~ the people shall see themselues reputed published Rebels Heretikes by so great a man as D. Allen, a Cardinall, professed Aduocate to the K. of Spaine, whom they may imagine, for his credit, calling, and adherencie with the King, to know better then themselues, what opinion is held of them, what minde towards them, by the King, and not to cast out such words at randon, of his owne meere intemperancy? What may they gather of it? or what construction may any man in reason make of it? This onelie may they well thinke with themselues.
All is not gold that glistereth, and within a faire bait, may bee hidden a foule hooke.
And howsoeuer the Duke of Parma in the behalfe of the King (his Maister) allureth vs with curtesie and faire promises (as it standeth with good policie for him to doe) if hee may by that meanes draw vs home to his obedience, yet hauing once gotten vs vnder his hand, it is doubtfull how hee will intreat vs.
For the wound which wee haue made him by these long warres and infinite troubles, charges, and expenses, is so great, as it can neuer bee so cleane healed, but there will still remaine a foule skarre, which will put him alwaies in remembrance of the hurt hee hath receiued by vs: so that though it bee for the present in shew forgiuen, yet wee may well assure our selues, it can not in heart bee for euer forgotten: neither is it wisedome to trust a reconciled friend, much lesse a scarce reconciled Lorde, that hath our liues and all at commandement.
Besides, this may also be a caueat vnto vs to be the more circumspect how we trust him, that we see euen whilest he is yet seeking to win vs, his deuote fauourers, such as for their credit vvith him, are priuy to the estate of his dealings, opinion of vs, doe not sticke openly to call vs Rebels Heretikes: hovv much more then may vve assure our selues, that we are in inward account so esteemed by him? And if hee hold vs for Heretikes, what faith or promise wil he keep with vs, vvhe~ vve are once fast in hand? If Rebels, vvhat other thing are vvee to expect at his ha~ds, then the flat reward of Rebels? Thus may D. Allens termes (and not without great reason) kindle, or at the least encrease such a suspition, in a subtill, ielous, and wauering people, alreadie doubtfull of their securitie, as may frustrate all the Duke of Parmaes earnest endeuours, and secrete practises for the reclayming of those Countreys, and greatly endomage the King of Spaine, his owne Patrone.
For in truth, that people is verie apt, and hath good cause vpon former experience to bee suspicious in this case, by how much the more likely it is, these verie termes may drawe them into a further ielousie of the Kinges meaning towardes them: which occasion Doctor Allen should not in policie haue ministred, to the preiudice of this Catholike Protector.
Now for the whole latter part of his Pamphlet conteining the persuasion of reuolt, iudge, pray you, what policie it was for him to enter into that argument, in such open sort, and in so dangerous a season.
For where his purpose and whole intent therein is, to stir vp his Catholike countreymen against her Maiestie, to the aide and assistance of those forrein forces, which are prepared for the inuasion of her her Realme: see if the very meanes which he vseth to atteine vnto his purpose, do not giue sufficient occasion to preuent and cleane cut off the accomplishment and ende of his purpose, for which he vseth the~.
For when her Maiestie shal see an ope~ persuasion vsed publikely vnto her subiects (especially those that are of the Romish Religion inciting them to reuolte from her obedience, to ioyne with her enimies against her, and to employ their vttermost forces to the bereauing of her both of kingdome, and of life, with a iustification of the action, drawne from the authority of their holy Father the Pope (which their ignorant and superstitious deuotion hath by all likelyhood perswaded them, that it were damnable for them to disobey:) and published by a principal piller of their Church, the credit of whose Cardinalship, is likely inough to preuaile with the~, euen against their owne knowledge, nature, and spirite: when her Maiestie (I say) shall in so perillous a time and expectation of inuasion, see so great a danger imminent ouer her, by her Romish Catholike subiects, and (as it were) a plaine denuntiation and threatening of the vtter ruine ouerthrow, both of her selfe and her whole state, to be doubted (or rather certainly expected) at their hands, will it not make her looke better to her selfe, and streighter to those Catholikes? Nay, being thus warned, as she may well be, by this perswasion of D. Allens, what can she do lesse (if she wil do but that, which in reason in all good policie she may, and is by this pamphlet admonished and whetted on to do, for the preseruation of her selfe and her kingdome) then prouide speedily to cut such Catholiks cleane of, and to roote them out of her countrey, and not to nourish any longer so manye and so venimous serpents, yea such pestilent hydraes in her bosome, by whom such assured daunger and mischiefe is portended and threatened towards her? At the least, if her princely nature and clemencie, which hath euer hitherto but too much preuailed with her in the like cases, will not suffer her to vse that meanes, which in reason were most fitte and necessarie for her best assuraunce: yet the naturall and due care of her owne safety, and the weale publike, must of necessity inforce her, at the least to disarme, and vtterly disable them from doing harme.
By which meanes D. Allen (I trust) shall at the least be disappointed of his purpose (for any assistance his Catholike brethren here, shall be able to yeelde vnto his Catholike king, against their liege Souereigne) euen by occasion of his Religious perswasions: which, if her Maiesties mercie were not greater then his wisedome and foresight in this point, might bee a meane of more displeasure and harme vnto the English Romanists, then either D. Allens counsell, or the king of Spaines forces, or the Popes blessing, will euer be able to repaire.
And for this might they thanke D. Allen, whose prophane policies turne to the confusion of his own frends and folowers.
Now, to growe towardes an end, and to giue you a briefe remembrance of that which hath bene alreadie spoken: you haue herein seene, First, all D. Allens arguments, brought in his pamphlet for the iustification of the deliuering vp of Deuenter, particularly answered and confuted, the fact of Sir William Stanley and Yorke (by his owne position proued plaine treason, and all her Maiesties actions in the low Countreys (or otherwise) towards the k. of Spaine (by D. Allens owne arguments, assertions, and authors) proued most lawfull, iust, and honorable: Secondly, his most wicked and malicious mind and practise, against her most Excellent Maiestie, and the whole State and Countrey, most plainely and euidently discouered; togither with his cunning order, methode, and meanes he vseth to atteine vnto his trecherous purpose: his slanderous defamations of her Maiesties most princely and godly actions, and of her ministers and countrey, most truely and iustlye refuted, and rebanded vpon himselfe and his partie: and his holy fathers authoritie to depose Princes, togither with his warrant for the subiectes disobedience, vtterly disproued ouerthrowne, not onely by sundry authorities, both of the holy Scriptures, and of the ancient fathers and Doctors of the Church, but also by those very examples, which D. Allen himselfe produceth, for his best confirmation thereof: Thirdly, his seditious and vngodly perswasions vnto her Maiesties naturall borne subiectes, shewed to be most deceitfull, corrupt, malicious, and such as ought to haue no force, being grounded vpon such examples and arguments, as doe rather inforce the contrarie: and his policies so prophane, absurd, and vnaduised, as (being measured by the line of right consideration) they turne wholy to the aduantage of them, against whom they are intended, and to the great preiudice of himselfe, and his associats.
Wherin, that you may the better perceiue by the whole course of his dealings, and euery particular point thereof, the honest and religious mind and disposition of this Cardinall, you are in the first to consider the lawdable and high renowmed fact, which he taketh vpon him in this pamphlet to defend and extoll, and the worthy and famous persons, for whom he offereth himselfe an Aduocate· and broacheth his best vessels of Rhetorike, with his ruinous and decayed eloquence to solemnise, proclaime their veluetheaded vertue and deuotion.
Touching the fact, neede not by bitternes of wordes to augment the infamie thereof, being not onely most apparant of it selfe, but by D. Allens owne assertions also proued, most traiterous, dishonorable, and infamous.
For the persons, rather remember them with pitie, then pursue them with malice: that the one of them being of an ancient noble house, a man well frended and greatly fauored, and then euen in the ready way of aduauncement, should (of a meere discontented mind) deceiue the expectation and good opinion of his gratious Souereigne and honorable frendes, and preuent his owne good happes: the other hauing in former times lead a loose and dissolute life, and played some slippery partes, to the touch of the best ioynt in his bodie, and yet hauing afterwardes found extraordinary frendship for the sauing of his life, and saluing of his former trespasses, and being now receiued into some fauour, and credit aboue his demerits, should (of a vagrant humour, and vitious disposition) returne with the dogge to his vomit, and with the swine to his former filth and wickednes: and lastly, and especially, that both of them should vnto the foule attaint of Treason, adde the most odious and shamefull guilt of Ingratitude, the one of them in betraying his L. and Maister, by whom, and through whom he had receiued all his honour and preferment, and greater was to receiue, if his disloyalty had not preuented it: the other in betraying his most honorable benefactor, of whom he had receiued sundry fauours and great benefits, and by whose speciall meanes he had receiued his life: both of them in betraying their Generall, which had trusted them both, aboue their desert: both of them in preferring the present gaine of some few crownes, before the respect of their own consciences and reputation, their duety allegeance vnto their most gracious Souereigne, and the honor of their countrey.
But it were but a small glorie, to insult vpon the miserable, and lesse pleasure it is to me, to oppresse them with reproches, whom their own doings haue already cast downe to the lowest dungeon of discredit.
will therefore onely bewayle their want of grace, not afflict their persons, by rubbing ouer the rawe skarres of their freshe woundes, not yet fullye skynned.
And these (forsooth) are the famous facts, which D. Allen so highly commendeth: these the honorable persons, whose Orator he maketh himselfe, to declaime of their praises.
And no maruell if an Archtraytor defend Treason: for if Treason should haue no defense, his owne fact were the more infamous: and if the inferiour Traytors be so highly extolled, how much the greater is his own glory? In the second, you are to obserue the actions, which he setteth himselfe to impugne and discommend, and the persons against whom he opposeth himselfe, and shooteth out the most venimous sting of his slaunderous and blasphemous tongue.
The actions, such as by the aduersaries owne arguments, affirmations, and authorities, haue bene already sufficiently iustified against his false calumniations, and are in themselues most apparent godly, vertuous, and honorable: The persons so sacred, so religious, so vnspotted, so far aboue all blemish of detraction, as Malice it selfe cannot name without reuerence, nor thinke on without trembling; and such, as D. Allen is by Gods owne worde expressely forbidden, not onelye to speake, but so much as to imagine euill of, in thought.
Yet such is the corruption of his mind, the disobedience of his heart, the neglect and contempt he hath of Gods commandement, as no regard of vertue, no respect of ciuility, no feare of God or man, can restraine his outragious intemperancie.
But herein hath he obserued Decorum, and shewed himselfe in all pointes like himselfe: for he that hath professed himselfe an open patrone of vice and trecherie, and a cannoniser of disloyall traytors, it fitteth best his person and quality, to obiect himselfe as a sworne aduersarie to all honorable, godly and religious actions, and a malicious and slanderous defamer of all true noble, vertuous, and renowmed personages.
In the third, you are to note the nature of the thing, whereunto he goeth about to perswade you, that is, to reuolte from the due obedience and seruice of your Souereigne, to rebell and to take armes against her, your countrey: a thing first, in it selfe, vnlawfull, displeasing to God, and repugnant vnto his word, as hath bene by sundry argume~ts, and expresse authorities of Scripture, manifestly declared vnto you: secondly, for the effects, vnnaturall, odious, and infamous throughout the whole world, as being the most pestilent disease of the bodie politike, the greatest enimie to ciuill gouernment, and the dissoluer of all humane society: thirdly, for the intent, most dommageable, and vtterly pernicious to yourselues, as tending directly to the very ruine and ouerthrow of your peace, liberty, welth, prosperitie, and finally in a word, to the extreme miserie, calamity, and destruction of yourselues and your countrey.
fit perswasion for such an author, wherein he hath shewed himselfe hitherto no changeling, that he might at the least purchase vnto himselfe the commendation of constancie, though it be but in meere lewdnes, and shamelesse impietie.
Lastly, for a full consummation and accomplishment of his prayses, you are in all and euery particular of this his pamphlet throughout, to co~sider (that which hath bene heretofore in sundry places noted vnto you) his fraudulent and indirect dealing, not onely in the fallacies and Sophistications of his arguments, but also in the ope~ falshood of his affirmations, and especially in his peruerting and wresting of the holie histories, and examples of Scripture, to his seditious and wicked purposes.
Which if any (vpon the good opinion they haue conceiued of D. Allens integrity zeale in religion) do thinke not to be intended by him to the deceiuing of them, they do therein vtterly deceiue themselues.
For it standeth not with reason or common sense, for anie man to beleeue, that he will make it nice or deintie, to abuse the ignorance or credulitie of men, which maketh it no conscience to abuse the most sacred and holie word of the eternall God.
But herein hath he (I saie) duely and orderly accomplished his course, with such equalitie, proportion, and vniformitie in all points, as the middle appeareth in each respect answerable to the beginning, and the ende vnto both: insomuch as the Authour hath effectually shewed himselfe not to haue degenerated in anie point, from his first humour disposition: but that you may rightly say of him (forsomuch as he hath declared in this pamphlet,) that if there be one good zeale, motion, or affection in him, there is neuer a bad.
If anie man thinke mee to haue been more earnest and bitter in speeches against the man, then heretofore promised and professed, let him impute it to the bitternes of the argument and occasion, for protest haue not in any thing inueighed against the person, but against his wicked, malicious, and pestilent practises: which know no subiect well affected could with patience endure to think vpon, and my selfe haue beene enforced to command my selfe temperancie, in repeating and answering them, labouring in no wise to discredit him, but endeuouring wholy to discouer his double and deceitfull dealings, his irreligious and prophane policies, and his euident abuses and impostures: which hath been euer hitherto the onlie meanes, that not hee alone, but all the rest of the same sect haue vsed, to seduce men from the Truth to the following of their faction, for the setting vp of their Antichristian Monarchy.
For that is the verie marke they shoote at, to make themselues Lordes, and Rulers of the world, and to draw as well the authoritie of the swoord, as the custodie of the keyes, into their owne handes, and to bring all Kinges, Princes, Emperours, and all Ciuil powers, vnder their subiection and obedience.
Which knowing at the first that they could not by anie meanes bring to passe, if the word of God, (which is directly against their purposes, and beateth downe their intolerable pride, and ambitious desire of Souereigntie should once bee made publike and common to the people, whereby they might be able to discerne their doctrine, and finde out their errors and abuses: to keepe and restraine men from that knowledge, they endeuoured first to suppresse the holie Scriptures, by prohibiting them to be published in those languages, wherin the people might read and vnderstand them: teaching the people, that it was not conuenient for them to meddle with the Scriptures, but that it was sufficient for them to relie wholy vpon their doctrine, and necessarie for their saluation to beleeue what they taught, and to fulfill what they commanded.
So by this meanes might they teach whatsoeuer they would, for who could controll them? and whatsoeuer they taught, the people were bounde to beleeue, vpon paine of damnation; for who durst offende his Ghostly Father? If anie true member of the Church of Christ, stirred vp by the spirite of God, and an earnest zeale of his word, to encounter their wicked proceedings, and to hinder the kingdome of Antichrist, did put himselfe forwarde to reprooue their errors, rebuke their abuses, and sincerely to teach the word of God, and due administration of the Sacraments, according to the true institution of Christ, and the doctrine of the Apostles and the Primitiue Church, endeuouring to communicate vnto all men the knowledge of the trueth: they forthwith condemned him for an Authour of new doctrine, a sower of sedition, and (to make him the more odious vnto the world) proclaimed him for an Heretike, thundring out their Bulles, excommunications, and curses against him, and all to the ende that men might not incline to him, nor giue anie credit or regard to his teaching, whereby they might come to the knowledge of the Scriptures, and to the discouering of their Popish abuses, and impostures.
Now, whe~ they see these policies no lo~ger auaile the~, but that mighty Princes whole Natio~s, mooued by the invvard vvorking of the holie Spirite, haue caught hold of, and embraced the light of the Gospel, and thereby haue begun to descry their iugling and tromperie, and to fall away from their obedience; they flie now from policie to plaine force, and ioyne the one with the other, and fall to inciting not only of naturall borne subiects, but of forreine Princes and nations, to ioyne in armes against the defenders of the true, ancient, Catholike, and Apostolike Faith, only to the intent to reduce them to their former subiection and obedience, and to establish their owne Antichristian Monarchie.
And what other meanes vse they to drawe them to the accomplishment of their vngodly, and woorse then barbarous designements, but euen their ancient and accustomed policie and practise of deceit, seducing them with false doctrine, and persuading them, those thinges to bee most lawfull, honourable and necessarie to bee done, vpon paine of damnation, which are expresly forbidden by the word of God? And can anie man then bee so senseles as to bee mooued by their persuasions, seeing how first they haue noozled them in ignorance, and barred them the meanes, whereby they might haue come to the knowledge, to bee able to discerne of trueth, and falshood, only to the intent to binde them wholy to the beleeuing of their traditions: and now (hauing so Captiued their vnderstandings and iudgements with blindnes, as either they haue not the knowledge to descry their abuses, or at the least haue it wholy restrained to the credit of their doctrine,) forbeare not to impose vpon them anie falshood, that may further their ambitious purposes? There is no man but knoweth that the plaine and simple Truth, which is euer able to iustifie it selfe, craueth no credit, nor feareth to be sifted to the vttermost: but it is falshood, that seeketh corners, and vseth policie to creepe into credit, and refuseth to come to open triall.
And why should then the Romish Church recommend ignorance vnto the people, and leade them on in blindnesse with their own traditions, restraining from them the reading and knowledge of the Scriptures, which is the true touchstone of Religion, if their doctrine were pure and sounde, and able to abide the touch? Christ biddeth all men search the Scriptures; why should they then forbid or hinder anie man to reade the Scriptures, but that they know the Scriptures condemne both their doctrine and dooings, and therefore feare to haue their falshood and wickednes discouered? Wherein they doe most of all, and most euidently condemne themselues (to the iudgement of all men, in whom there is anie iote of iudgement or common sense) bewraying themselues to bee the children of darkenes, not of the light, The blinde, leaders of the blinde, Wolues in Sheepes cloathing: And what better marke seeke ye to know them by, then the same verie marke, whereby Christ himselfe hath notified them vnto you, that is, by their fruites? their pride, their ambition, their malice, their deceit, their imposture, their falshood, their prophanesse, to conclude, their plaine Atheisme? And can you (notwithstanding all these notes of them (giuen you by Christ beleeue them, or suffer your selues to be seduced by them? But mee thinkes doe euen see D. Allen himselfe proceeding on with the rest of Dauus his part, and saying to the Pope (his Maister) Deceptus sum, at non defatigatus: Hac non successit, alia aggrediamur via: am disappointed of my purpose, but not weary of my worke: Since this trick hath not serued our turne, let vs trie another.
In trueth doubt nothing of his good will, nor of his endeuour, neither yet of the readines of the rest of that crue, to pursue this argument: for neither is this the first assault, that D. Allen hath giuen to the subiects fidelitie and obedience, neither is D. Allen the first and onely Champion, that hath striken the first blow in so bad a quarrell, though none of them euer yet answered the encounter.
But the best hope is, let him, or anie other giue the assaie againe, when, and as often as they lust, trust they shall bee still disappointed, and in the ende weery, or cleane worne out: and when they haue attempted all the waies they can, they shall bee as wise, as they were in the beginning, and in the beginning, midst, and ending, neerer to their owne ende, then to the ende of their purpose.
For God will neuer giue successe to so godles an enterprise.
As for this slender push of D. Allens Pamphlet, hope there is not the holowest hart of all her Maiesties subiects, in whom there is either feare of God, sense of reason, or regard of his owne safetie, but that hauing seene his weake forces, his brittle weapons, his false fiers, and counterfeit engines, is sufficiently armed in himselfe with his owne honestie, faith, and loyaltie, to abide and withstand and this feeble and forcelesse batterie.
But what shall now saie to M. Allen, and the rest of our fugitiue Countreymen, that haue left their Souereigne, their Countrie, and their duetie altogither, especially such as haue not onelie left them, but doe maliciously stirre vp all the meanes they can to ouerthrow, destroy, and vtterly deface them? Shall whet my selfe wholy to inueigh against them? know their deedes haue not only deserued it, but doe iustly prouoke me and euerie good subiect vnto it.
But will vse Charitie, euen where it is not to bee shewed.
Shall then in Charitie reprooue them? would they were as willing to heare reproofe, and as readie to bee reformed, as they haue been charitably, friendly, and brotherly admonished.
Shall labour to exhort and perswade them to the consideration of their duetie, the repentaunce of their grieuous offences committed againste their Souereigne and Countrey, and restauration of their due obedience and fidelitie? feare shall but loose my labour, to cry to them Resipiscite conuertimini, Be wise and turne, their eares are so close stopped, their hearts so ouerhardened, their mindes so maliciously bent against her Maiestie, their Countrey, and vs all.
What shall then say further to them? Alas, in so desperate a case, can say no more, then Doctor Allen in his Pamphlet saieth to his Countrey (but with a better minde and meaning towards them, then he doth towards vs,) Alas for them, and thrice Alas for them: for doe euen from the bottome of my hart pitie their errour, enuie not their Religion: doe euen from the bottome of my heart bewaile their obstinacie, hate not their persons· doe euen from the bottome of my heart lament their their miserable estate, malice not the men: wish better to them, then they doe vnto vs: desire neither the spilling of their blood, nor the spoiling of their substance, but pray, pray hartily for them, God amend them, God lighten their eies, if they be blinde and doe not see, open their eares, if they bee deafe and cannot heare, turne their hearts, if they bee obstinate and will neither see, nor heare.
God (if it bee his will) giue them grace to know his will, to acknowledge his will, and to conforme themselues to his will, that they may be heires of his euerlasting Will.
And to you (my brethren, countreymen, what shall say more then hath bene said? Shall endeuour to exhorte you to obedience, and to the loue of your prince, and defense of your countrey? Why should seeme so much to suspect your obedience, your loue to your Prince, or your zeale and care of your countrey? Because D. Allen hath attempted by his perswasio~s to corrupt you, withdraw you fro~ the~? Why, you see his perswasions are of litle force, grounded vpon falshood, and contrarye to the word of God.
But were they neuer so forcible, why should you be corrupted by them? An honest faithfull mind may well be assaulted, but will reuer be ouercome with the corruption of wicked perswasions: Nay, thêre is vertue most shewed, where against the hottest assault is made the strongest resistance.
But why should you disobey, and reuolte from your princes seruice, and take armes against her and your countrey, as D. Allen exhorteth you to do? Whether vpon iust cause, or vpon discontentment? If vpon discontentment, you shewe yourselues rebels· not to your Souereigne onely, but to God himselfe, in that you are not contented with his ordinaunce, but will striue to put it downe, and set vp a new ordinance of your own.
This motion cannot proceede but of the deuill himselfe, the rebellious spirite, and mouer of all sedition.
If you saie vpon iust cause, you deceiue your selues: for there can be no iust cause, to committe an vniust fact.
If there might anie cause bee iust, who shall be iudge of the iustice thereof? Your selues? that were not fit: you are parties, and therefore partiall, and no competent iudges.
Againe you are priuate men, and subiects, and therefore can haue no lawfull authoritie (in this case) to iudge? Who then shal be iudge to determine this cause? There is no lawfull power in this Realme, but your Souereigne, and her ministers: then if there be anie cause, you must open it vnto her, and submit both your selues and the cause to her iudgement, and reformation, and in the meane time continue in your due obedience, till the cause be decided.
But (you will say) your Souereigne is a partie also, aswell as you, in the cause.
But to whose iudgement then will you appeale? there is none to be iudge ouer her, but God.
Will you then be iudged by him? Indeed he is the highest iudge, and by him the whole world is to be iudged.
And will ye be content to stand to his iudgement? know you will not call him out of heauen, in person to iudge betwixt you: for you neede not: because he hath left his lawes and iudgements amongst you, here on earth, recorded in his owne bookes of the old new testament, which may be sufficient to determine this cause, without any further assistance, seeing that by them the whole world is to be iuged.
Looke then into his booke for his iudgeme~t in this case, and you shal finde that he forbiddeth you absolutely (without exception of any cause) to laye your handes vpon the Lordes annointed: and commaundeth you as absolutely (without all manner exception) to submit your selues aswell to your Prince, as to her ministers and inferiour gouernours, to obey her, and not to resist her, for if yee resist her, he telleth you that yee resist his ordinaunce, and shall thereby receiue to your selues iudgement.
You heare now, how God in his holy Scriptures determineth this case directly against you, that you may not (for any cause) offer to lay your hands vpon your Souereigne, but that you must submit your selues vnto her, obey, and not resist her, vpon paine of iudgement.
How then will you dare to lift vp your hands, and to take armes against her? But, if it were lawfull for you (as it is not) for any cause, to rise in armes against the Queens Maiestie, your liege drad Souereigne, what cause (I pray you) would you pretend for your so doing? will you say Religion? Indeed Religion is the cause, for which D. Allen teacheth you, that it is lawful honorable for you to take armes against your prince, laboureth earnestly to perswade you therunto, such as are of his religion.
But what kind of Religion call you that, that stirreth you vp to Rebellion? You haue receiued no such religion from Christ, nor from his Apostles: for they teach you the contrary, both by their doctrine, and examples.
They tell you that you must submit your selues to your Souereigne, obey, and not resist her.
They, when they were imprisoned, tossed, and turmoyled from place to place, reuiled, striken, yet neuer offered resistance against the Magistrates, neither moued, or attempted any sedition, nor entred into any conspiracy against the~, but endured all with patience, as constant witnesses of the Truth: which is cleane contrarie to this Religion, which you professe.
From whom then receiue you your Religion? from your holy father the Bishop of Rome? It may very well be; for it sheweth it selfe from whence it cometh.
And is this the Religion, for which you will take armes against your Prince? Why, you see it is a Religion taken from man, and not from God, and therefore cannot stand.
You see it is a Religion contrarie to the doctrine and Religion of Christ, and the Apostles, and therefore not the true Religion.
Will you then take armes against your Prince in the quarrell and defense of a false Religion? you know not what you do, and that is also the fault of your Religion.
For if you had giuen your selues to the reading of the Scriptures, and studie of knowledge, whereby you might haue bene able to giue an account of your faith, and knowne the ground of your Religion, and not leaned so much, nor giuen so great trust vnto mens traditions: you might (with Gods grace and assistance) haue found out a sounder Religion.
But then should you haue fallen from the precepts of your Popish teachers· But yet should you haue followed the commaundement of Christ, who biddeth you Search the Scriptures.
What fault find you with our Religion? Wee teach nothing, but what we learne out of the Scriptures: we hold constantly the doctrine of our Sauiour Christ, and of the holie Apostles in all pointes vnchanged, and by them we offer our selues to bee tried, and our Religion.
And do you condemne the Scriptures, the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles? If you do, the whole world will condemne you: if you do not, how can you then condemne our Religion? Compare it with your owne, and, if you bee not ouer partiall, senselesse, or shamelesse, be iudges your selues, whether of the two is the sounder.
We ground our Religion wholy on the word of God, you, more vpon the traditions of men: we recommend vnto all men the knowledge of the Scriptures, for the direction of their life, and assurance of their saluation; your teachers restrayne from you the knowledge of the Scriptures, deliuering you their owne traditions, both for your instruction of life, and assurance of your saluation: we commend vnto subiects obedience, and fidelitie, to their Princes, they commaund subiects disobedience, and rebellion against their Princes.
Denie anie part hereof, if you can: examine your owne consciences, if this be not all true, and then iudge your selues by the true cognisance of Religion, whether of the two is the true Religion.
We flie not to armes to mainteine our Religion, for the truth is able to vphold it selfe, and hath God for her protector: Your Religion had neede to be aduaunced by armes, els must it soone decaie, hauing neither God, nor the Truth, nor reason to mainteine it And will you then take armes against your Prince for defense of this Religion? No, no, if you doe, you deceiue your selues, you take armes against both your Prince and Religion, and (in defense of mens traditions and tromperies, vnder pretense of Religion you seeke to ouerthrow the true Religion: wherein you rebell not onelie against your Prince, but against God himselfe, who is the authour and defender of this Religion.
Christ teacheth you not to take armes, though ye were persecuted for Religion, but to flie: and if ye will abide and stand in the Truth, he willeth you to suffer, like Martyrs, not to resist, like Rebelles.
But you haue no such cause giuen you, either to resist, or to flie; for ye are not persecuted, but instructed: and if yee refuse to come to heare, ye are punished for your disorder and disobedience, not for Religion: for what Religion teacheth you to refuse, to heare the word of God preached? Christ saith, My sheepe heare my voyce: whose sheep are you then? for you are none of Christes.
If ye wil be of Christes flock, you must renounce that Religion, which withdraweth you from the hearing of his voice: for till then you cannot be his sheepe.
Do you call th'execution of Iustice against your Iesuits and Seminaries, persecution for Religion? You do either ignorantlie mistake it, or slaunderouslie misreport it.
For none was euer executed for Religion, but for expresse Treason against her Maiesties person, as hath bene sufficientlie declared and published to all men.
But (you will say) they did nothing but what Religion moued and bound them in conscience to do.
beleeue it, and affirme asmuch as you saie: this is the fault, warned you of before, in your Religion.
good Religion (ywis) that moueth and bindeth men to the committing of Treason against their Christian Rulers.
Can you confesse so much your selues, and yet are ye so blinde, that you will not see the impietie of your Religion? Yet see your owne daunger, how in professing that Religion, you condemne your selues of treason.
If your Religion tie the~ necessarily to treason, that hold it, as in truth it doth, (for they must either disobey her Maiesty, or not obey the Pope: how can you acknowledge your selues professors of that Religion, and not conde~ne your selues for traitors to your souereigne? Leaue, leaue therefore that erroneous and vngodly profession, and terme it not by the holie name of Catholike Religion, but meere blindnes and Superstition, being grounded vpon the vaine inuentions and traditions of men, so directly opposite vnto the word of God, so contrarie to the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, and so inseparably combined and linked with Treason, as you cannot be either true Catholiks, Christians, or loyall subiects, so long as you persist in it.
Pretend not the quarrell of Religion, against your Prince and Religion: for (assure your selues) if you will admit (as you ought) that onely to be the true Religion which is founded vpon Christ, the head Corner stone, there is no Religion, that alloweth so rebellious an action.
If you giue any heed vnto outward and Ciuill respects, consider with your selues the long, peacible and prosperous reigne of your Souereigne, the like wherof your forefathers haue not seene, nor any age doth record.
If long peace, wealth, and prosperity, be the outward blessings of God (as vndoubtedly they bee) whereby hee declareth his speciall fauour vnto that Prince kingdome, which feare him· worship him syncerely, and with whom he is well pleased, according to his word and promises in the Scriptures, al these maie be to you an assured argument, both of the singular fauour of God, vnto your Prince and Countrie, and of the true sincere Religion professed by them, wherewith hee is well pleased.
But looke yet further into the exceeding fauour of God shewed particularlie vnto her Maiestie (I speake not of her rare and singular giftes of wisedome, learning, vertue, and other her excellent, and Princely qualities and perfections, both of bodie and minde, with all other Complements of nature, so abundantlie bestowed vpon her, as few ages haue euer knowen her equall, all which wee must yet acknowledge to bee the speciall graces of God looke, saie, into his gracious goodnes towardes her, in protecting her from the manifold dangers and mischiefes attempted against her own person.
know there is none of you ignorant, how often sundrie times her deare life hath bin sought, and how neare the bloodie tortors haue been to the verie execution of their deuilish designement, some of them (more then once or twice) in neerest and priuate place, with their murderous weapons in their hands, euen readie to strike the deadlie and cursed stroake of our calamitie, and their owne vtter confusion and damnation; had not God preuented it, by striking them with a sodeine trembling of heart, and astonishment of minde, for the preseruation of his annointed seruant and handmaid.
This you know to haue been attempted not once, nor twice, nor thrice, but oftener then either memorie serueth mee to repeat, or horrour of the villanie will suffer mee to remember: and will you not acknowledge the Diuine prouidence, and the fatherlie and louing kindnes of God vnto her Maiestie, in so miraculouslie deliuering her, euen out of the bloodie hands of the cruell Butchers, for the aduancement of his glorious Gospell, and propagation of true Religion, by her faithfull and zealous Ministerie: on the other side, his iust iudgment and vengeance vpon the traitorous Parricides, in not onlie defeating, but discouering most wonderfullie (euen by some of their owne mouthes) their accursed and damnable purposes, and bringing them to a shamefull end, for an example to all others of that sort, to take heede how they enter into such wicked conspiracies? And who haue bin the actors in all these tragical attemptes, but onlie such as you terme Catholikes, professors of the Romish Religion, and such as the Pope and his adherents haue inueigled, and set on to execute their most impious and detestable deuises, and (to conclude) such as Doctor Allen inticeth, and exhorteth you now to bee? But what Atheist is hee so irreligious, what monster of nature so barbarous, what Tyger so fierce and cruell, as can finde in his heart to laie his hand vpon the Lords annointed, to imbrue his murderous blade in the blood of a Prince, of a Mayden Prince, in whom is nothing but mildenes, clemencie, vertue, modestie, Religion, all kinde of Princely nature and exellencie? Whose royall Maiestie ought to be a terror to all traitorous thoughts, whose tender sexe ought to bee a safegard against all violent assaults, whose sacred vertue, a protection against all villanous attempts.
Let Gods especiall fauours therefore miraculously shewed vnto her Maiestie, and his exceeding blessings abundantly powred out by him vpon her Countrey, bee vnto you (as it is indeed) an assured argument, that her Religion is the true Religion acceptable vnto God, and conformable to his word: and let the vngodly and irreligious practises of the Church of Rome, to murther Princes, and mainteine Rebellion (contrarie to the word and will of God be vnto you (as they ought to bee) infallible tokens of a false and counterfeit Religion: and let the greeuous iudgement, and iust vengeance of God, inflicted vpon those abhominable Traitors, bee vnto you (as to your best behoofe it may bee) a terror from assenting vnto anie such traitorous, or rebellious enterprise.
Looke into the Histories of ages past, either of forreine Nations, or your owne Chronicles, and tell mee where you euer reade, or heard, or founde written, that Rebelles did euer preuaile against their lawfull Souereignes.
Looke neerer into the examples of your owne Countrey and within your owne memorie, and namely the Insurrections in the time of the late most vertuous Prince of famous memorie, Edward the sixt, against whom a rabble of rebellious subiects in sundrie partes assembled themselues, some pretending the quarrell of Religion, some of a Common wealth, and gathered mightie forces of manie thousands, to the great amazement of the whole Countrey, and the Prince a Child, yet what (I pray you) was the ende of their Rebellion, but speedie discomfiture, and confusion? The histories are ful of the like exa~ples of all ages for what age hath not brought forth of both sorts, as well disobedient Rebels and miscreants, as honest and duetiful subiects? but how different soeuer the causes and quarrels haue been (as there was neuer anie such action so bad, but had the pretence and colour of some good intent) for which the Rebels haue entred into Armes against their lawfull Princes, yet the ende hath euer (for the most part) been alike.
For they that resist their Rulers, resist God, Whose ordinance they are, and those that resist God, God will confound them, (which is most wretched and miserable) their infamie shall remaine vpon perpetuall record, for a spectacle to all posteritie.
What hope haue you then left, to encourage you to so godlesse an action, to take armes against your gratious Souereigne? Doe you expect redemption (as you pretend Religion through the meanes and assistance of forreine Forces? Nay rather assure your selues of certeine Captiuitie or destruction.
For, if forreine powers should preuaile ouer your countrie, do you hope for adua~ceme~t at their hands in your countrie? No, no, your forrein Lordes will stand too much in doubt of your fidelitie towardes them, which haue not been faithfull to your owne naturall Prince, Countrie, and therfore will keep you low inough for their own security: for though they loue your treason, yet they will not trust your traitorous mindes.
So shall you be faine with your Countrie to endure the losse of your libertie, and in your Countrie become vassals bondmend vnto Strangers: iust reward for your vniust rebellion: And this is the best issue you are to expect of so bad an action.
For, if your forreine auxiliarie forces goe to the ground, as trust they shall, if euer they giue the attempt against her Maiestie and this Realme, looke you to goe with them also for companie (as you are well worthie) if you goe not before them; euen when soeuer you shal first offer to stir.
For (I know) English men, how soeuer some few of the skumme and dregges of them (as of other Nations may either of a discontented minde, or desire of alteration for hauock and spoiles sake, or through the lewde inticements of others, be stirred vp to sedition, yet they are all generally by nature most faithfull vnto their Prince and Countrie, and especiallie against forreine enemies, in a case of Inuasion, whereupon they shall see, lieth the hazard of the vniuersal ouerthrow of themselues and their Countrey.
And therefore whatsoeuer you bee, that beare a Rebellious minde against your Prince and Countrey, and an vnnaturall affection to the partaking and furtherance of a forreine enemie, make sure account of this, that there shall not so soone be fiue Rebels gathered in a cluster to runne to their confederates, but there will bee fiftie true harted Subiects rounde about them readie to cut their throates.
And doubt you not but the Magistrates are circumspect, prouident, and carefull inough, to set a good order and caution, for the timely preuenting of all such your pernicious purposes.
Seeing then the assured issue of your rebellious attemptes (if anie of you should be so wickedly inclined) and the present danger and destruction hanging ouer your heads, mee thinks you should haue but litle courage, or comfort to stir in such a cause against your Prince Countrie.
But let not terror in these outward respects either onlie, or principally, driue you from disobeying or resisting of your Souereign, whom you are expresly commanded by God to obey, not for feare, but for conscience: but if there be in you Religion (as you pretend) shew your religion in obeying his word, and feare his euerlasting iudgements, if you disobey him.
So shal your obedience to your Prince bee a willing, a hartie, a cheerfull, a louing, a faithfull obedience, acceptable to God, comfortable to your Prince, and healthfull to your owne soules.
NOw to such as are faithfull true harted subiects to her Maiestie (as trust all are) shal not neede to vse anie exhortation at all, because know you are already so wel affected in hart towards your gracious Souereigne, and so throughlie confirmed in your obedience and duetie, as there cannot bee more added thereunto by anie mans persuasions.
Therfore will onelie giue you in a word such comfort encouragement, as haue receiued my selfe from mine owne conscience, to perseuer constantlie in that obedience, in the defense of Gods truth, our Princes safetie, the weale libertie of our Countrie.
You haue plainly vnderstood by this discourse, the malicious minde purpose of D. Allen and his partie, against our Queene countrey, the seditious practises, and persuasions vsed by him in his Pamphlet, to the furtherance therof: which though (I know) they can take no hold of any of you, yet let vs take this benefit of our enemies, to make their doings our warnings, to arme our selues against their malice.
That they wish ill to vs, we need not doubt: their owne writinges bewray it.
That they intend il towardes vs, wee must needes suppose: their practises haue declared it.
That they meane to attempt ill against vs, wee may well assure our selues: their preparations doe certeinlie confirme it.
How then? shall wee bee dismaied at it? that were not manlike.
Shall Romish and Spanish forces appall vs? That were dishonourable for English men.
Shall we be daunted with the feare of a forrein enemy? Then should we degenerate from the courage of our forefathers.
They fight for reuenge, wee for defense: they for the spoile, we for our liues, and liberties: they for the Pope, we for God, and our Prince.
And what is hee, nay, what is shee, that will not take armes, that wil not fight, that will not die in this quarrel? Our fathers haue vanquished forreine Princes: and shall not wee fight for our owne Prince? Our fathers haue conquered other Realmes: and shall not wee defend our owne Realme? Our fathers haue been Lords of other Countries: and shall we be slaues in our owne Countrie? What an alteration (or rather degeneration) would this bee in vs? how dishonourable to the English name and Nation? How iustlie might all other Nations reproach vs, and all succeeding ages record vs, for vnworthie Subiects of so worthie a Prince, degenerate Children of so generous Parentes, and infamous Inhabitantes of so famous a Countrey? Let vs therefore all of vs (seeing the quarrell is generall and common to vs all, for the defense of true Religion, our Prince, and our Countrey,) let vs all prepare our selues cheerefullie to th'encounter, let vs not respect the crie of wife, or childe, let vs respect their defense: let vs plucke vp our hartes, take vp our armes, and march hardilie to meete with our enimie; let vs fight with him, let vs die vpon him, yea let vs seeke him, if he seeke not vs.
We do all owe God a death: how shall we better pay it, then in hîs quarrell? Our liues are all at our Princes commandement: how can they be better spent, then in hêr seruice? We are all borne for our countrey: why should we then refuse to die for our countrey? If we die in Gods quarrell, we shall liue in his kingdome: If we die in our Princes seruice, we shall liue in the memorie of all posteritie: If we die in defense of our countrey, our renowme shall liue for euer.
Heathen Poet could saie to his heathen countreymen in his age, Dulce decorum est pro patria mori: It is a sweete and honorable death, In countreys cause to spend our vitall breath: And shall not we Christians thinke it most dishonorable for vs, to feare to die in the common cause of our God, our Prince, and our countrey? Why, D. Allen himself, in his pamphlet, where he goeth about to discourage vs, by admonishing vs not to be emboldened by the Memory of our old English notorious battailes and victories, which in olde time were comparable to what prouinces or peoples were most famous, nor by th'esteeme or opinion (either true, or partiall) of our present strength and courage in England: what doth he but adde comfort and courage vnto vs, in stirring vs vp aswell by the examples of our forefathers victories, to imitate their vertues, as by the knowledge of our own strength and courage, to take hart and courage vnto vs? Let vs then not cast away that encourageme~t which he giueth vs, rather let vs augment it by our own constancie of mind, and resolution.
If the strength of our Realme were great in our forefathers times, it is now far greater: Nay, it was neuer so great in any Princes age, as it is now, God be thanked.
And when our realme was not so strong, yet hath it conquered other Nations, and was neuer conquered by any, so long as it was true within it selfe.
And nowe, when our forces are greatest, shall our faith bee least? when our state is most prosperous, shall wee bee most miserable? when our quarrell is most glorious, shall we bee most infamous? No, no, let vs link togither in one mind, in one faith, in one force, let vs sticke togither, fight togither, die togither, like men, like Englishmen, like Englishmen.
Let vs all and euery one of vs shew ourselues forward in aduauncing this seruice of the common cause, with our substance, with our forces, and with our bodies also to the vttermost, as a great number of our faithfull countreymen in diuers partes of the realme, yea, whole countyes, cities, and townes, and namely the honorable citie of London, haue done most duetifully, louingly, and honorably.
Which do the more willingly remember, not onely for the comfort of my selfe, and them· and euery good subiect, and to their great honor and commendation, but also for an incitement vnto others by their example to be stirred vp vnto the like duetie and forwardnes.
Wherein if we ioyne all, our hartes, armes, and forces togither, like true and faithfull subiects, am fully perswaded our, forrein inuadors, whensoeuer they come, shall find England the hotest countrey that euer they set foote in: We are likely inough to measure their Spanish Cassocks with our English bowes, and their shoulders with our browne billes, before they measure our broad cloth with their long pikes.
And before it come to that, doubt not but some thousands of them God being our guide) shall cary their last message vnto their great grandfathers, the next way by water.
But what do vse encouragement to the~, that are of themselues most couragious, valiant, and euen eaguer to fight? Yet let me adde this to your greatest comfort, If God bee with vs, who can bee against vs: And that God is with vs in this quarrell, let vs stedfastly assure our+selues, howsoeuer D. Allen perswade the contrarye: and let him and his partakers knowe that God is against them, and will bee, so long as they oppose themselues against the obedience of his word, the knowlddge of his Truth, the light of his glorious Gospell.
And that God may be with vs still, and continue with vs for euer· let vs humble ourselues vnto him dayly and duely, with earnest· and hartie prayer and repentance, let vs serue him continually with a zealous feare and obedience, let vs glorifie him incessantly with a liuely faith and constancie: lastly, let vs giue ourselues wholy to him, that we may winne him wholy vnto vs. So we being his, and he ours, let vs all, and euery one of vs, comfort ourselues vpon his assurance, let vs fortifie our mynds vpon his assistance, and adde our endeuour to his encouragement: assuring ourselues, that fighting in so godlie, so iust, so honorable a quarrell, the successe cannot be but most happie, most prosperous, most glorious: that, if we defend our countrey, we shall remaine free and safe; if wee ouerthrow our Enimies, we shall abide victorious: if we die in this quarrell, we shall liue eternally.
To which assurance of freedome, safety, victorie, life, what comfort can be comparable? FINIS.

reformation of in scotland cleered from some mistakes and prejudices

while we the meanest of many our brethren

for a time separated from our particular callings and stations and sent forth into this kingdome for a more publike imployment are in all humility and patience waiting what the lord who is about some great work in his church for which are raised so great commotions in these and other kingdoms of the earth will be pleased to do for reformation of religion the great work of the honourable houses of parliament and the reverend assembly of divines and for uniformity in religion so much desired by all the godly in the three kingdomes unto whch an entrance is made by a solemne league and covenant
we finde our selves bound against the prejudices and mistakings of some who in the dark are afraid of that which they know not and suffer their affections of love and hatred to run before their understanding and against the and indirect aspersions of others who do so commend their own way that the reformed churches thereby suffer disparagement to give that testimony unto the order and government of the reformed churches and particularly of the church of scotland which they do well deserve and to honour them whom the lord hath so highly honoured in advancing the kingdom of his son in the converting

and saving of so many souls and in opposing and suppressing a world of corruptions heresies and schismes by his wonderfull blessing upon their order and government

in this our humble testimony and true relation

unto which we are at this time thus necessitate we shall endeavour nothing but a simple and innocent manifestation and defence without desire or intention to give the smallest offence to any who fear god love the truth desire to walk in truth and in love with their brethren
this our profession we are confident will finde credit with all that know us and have observed our wayes since our coming into this kingdom which have been and so farre as the the truth will suffer us ever shall be to unite and not to divide to compose rather then to create differences which we conceive also to be one principall end of the calling of the assembly of divines and which all the members of the assembly against all particular interests are after a speciall manner ingaged to aime at and endeavour

the order and government of the reformed churches in the beauty and strength thereof

as it is not hid in a corner wrapped up in a mystery or covered under a cloud of darknesse but is known to the nations and kingdomes of the earth openly professed and practised in the eyes of the world and cleerly seen as a city that is set on a hill in the light of the sunne at noone day so is it commended and already confirmed by a long tract of time and the experience of many yeers and hath been countenanced from heaven and blessed from above with the preservation of the truth and unity of religion against heresies and errours in doctrine idolatry and corruptions in worship and all sorts of sects and schismes wherewith it

hath been continually assaulted how goodly are thy tents jacob and thy tabernacles israel
it hath made the church of christ terrible as an army with banners and like a strong and fenced city against which the adversaries have despaired to prevaile but by making a breach in this wall and where they have gained ground or gotten any advantage either the wall hath not been built or being built hath been broken down or not vigilantly keeped by the

the instruments which the lord used in the blessed work of reformation of the church of scotland wee speak not of the reformers of other churches were not onely learned and holy men

but had somewhat in their calling gifts and zeal to the glory of god more then ordinary their adversaries were not able to resist the wisdome and spirit by which they spake some of them had a propheticall spirit manifested in divers particular and wonderfull predictions and some of them were honoured to be martyrs and sealed the truth with their blood so that in them in the people of god converted by them and and in the reformation brought about by the blessing of god upon their labours against all the learning pride policie and abused power of the time there was to bee seen a representation of the primitive and apostolicke times and a new resurrection from the dead
after them also did the lord raise up in the church of scotland many burning and shining lights men of the same spirit mighty in converting of souls walking in the same way and who communicated their counsels and keeped correspondence with divines of other nations and with the greatest and purest lights in the church of england in the point of reformation and setling of which at that time was the common study and endeavour

of both and wherein they and their successors continued till the times of defection which made an unhappy interruption of the work
what men are like to do in after times we cannot foresee but we have not seen or heard of any to this day farrer from partiality and prejudice in the matters of god then their wayes witnesse them to have been and were they now living we beleeve there would be none in the reformed churches so far swayed with partiality or prejudice that would deny them this testimony

they had no other rule and paterne of reformation but the word of god

and the practice of the apostolicke churches in the word
all the books of god are perfect the book of life the book of nature the book of providence and especially the book of scripture which was dyed by the holy ghost to be a perfect directory to all the churches unto the second coming of jesus christ but so that it presupposeth the light and law of nature or the rules of common prudence to be our guide in circumstances or things locall temporall and personall which being ecolesiastico politica are common to the church with civill societies and concerning which the word giveth generall rules to be universally and constantly observed by all persons in all times and places of things of this kind a godly and wise divine giveth two rules one is that the physician cannot by sending his letter to the patient appoint the dyet and bath the pulse must bee toucht and as it is in the proverbiall speech gladiatorem oportet in arena capere consilium
the other is that in things of this kind when the change is not to the better it is both without and against reason to make a change without reason because when the change is made unto that which is but as good the one and the other in reason are equall

against reason because the change it self in such a case is an hinderance to edification savoureth of the love of innovation and derogateth to the authority which maketh the constitution

what they had once received

not upon probable grounds in way of conjecture but upon the warrant of the word and by the teaching of the spirit with certaintie of faith that they resolved to hold fast did hate every false way contrary unto it
they did not in the matters of religion rest upon a sceptical or pyrrhonian uncertainty the charge of the orthodox divines against the tenets of arminians and socinians which keepeth the mind uncertain unstable is a fountain of perpetuall alterations in the church of god an open door to all heresies and schismes to enter by and a ground of despairing to bring questions and controversies to a finall issue and determination
and for us as upon the one part we not only conceive that no man attaineth so full assurance of faith in any matter of religion but he may receive encrease of his faith and therefore should alwayes have his minde open and ready to receive more light from the word and spirit of god but also do ingenuously acknowledge as wee have formerly professed that wee are most willing to hear and learn from the word of god what needeth further to be reformed in the church of scotland yet god forbid that we should never come to any certainty of perswasion or that we should ever be learning and never come to the knowledge of the truth wee ought to be resolute and unmoveable in so far as we have attained and this we take to be the ground as of other practices so also of covenants and oaths both assertory and promissory in matters of religion

as they held it not sufficient

to receive or retain some

such practices as other reformed churches judged warrantable for thus they should have rested upon some few principles and beginnings of reformation and might have differed as much in other things from the reformed churches as they agreed in some things with them so can it not be satisfactory that any church should only practise some things universally received in the reformed churches
all christian churches although very different in ordinances and practices yet do agree in some things if our desire of uniformity with other reformed churches and the reverend esteem we have of them draw us to conform to them in some things upon the same reason we ought to joyne in all things wherein they do all agree amongst themselves
differences about negatives and the denying of profession and practice in other matters wherein they are all unanimous and uniform may prove no lesse dangerous and destructive then differences about affirmatives
the arrians socinians and many others do erre dangerously in denying some positive points and received principles of the doctrine of the reformed churches concerning the person of christ and his offices
the antinomians also if we should mention them do also agree with us in the principles of grace but in their superstructures and conclusions runne in a way destructive to the doctrine and deductions of the apostolick and reformed churches and to the principles received by themselves
such churches as make profession of differences only in negatives or in denying some practices received in the reformed churches have received and do hold some positive practices of their own which the reformed churches do not allow and which to them are negative
of this would we suffer our selves to descend into particulars we might give divers known

instances now if they do not allow of the reformed churches in so far as they do not admit of these their positive practices how shall they think that the reformed churches can allow them in the like for the rule is wherein thou judgest another thou condemnest thy self for thou that judgest dost the same things

they did honour luther calvin and many others

whether their predecessors or contemporaries who had heart or hand especially in an eminent degree in the blessed work of reformation for their direction they made use of the light which such notable servants of jesus christ did hold forth in doctrine and discipline and in all thankfulnesse they did desire and wish that their names might be had in eternall remembrance nor was it possible that so great an alteration as the corrupt state of the church required could be effected and not carry some remembrance of the instruments but for this to call us calvinians and the reformed churches calvinian reformed churches is to disgrace the true churches of christ and to simbolize with the papists who call themselves the catholicke church and hold the rule delivered by hierome against the luciferians if any where we finde men professing christianity called by the particular names of men know them to be the synagogue of antichrist and not the church of christ
the separation may be well allowed to be called brownists and others from the matter wherein they erre and part from all not onely the reformed but christian churches as the monothelites of old and the anabapists now may bear their own names
they who apprehend any danger in names as there is a great deale of danger in them ought not to appropriate unto their own opinion that which is common to all the reformed churches nor to joyne with papists in giving names of sects unto the

reformed churches and they who conceive no evill in so doing ought not to offend that names are given unto them especially since their differences from the reformed churches must be designed under some name and notion and in this case charity commands the mildest names such as hint most clearly at the difference and are farrest from reproach to be attributed unto them as most discriminative and tolerable

nothing was farrer from their thoughts and intentions

then to frame in their own forge a lesbian rule answerable to any particular forme of civill policy or complyable with state ends
that they looked with singlenesse of minde to the rule of scripture we give these three evidences the great pains they took in searching the will of god and after they had found it their grievous sufferings from the civill authority in defence thereof of both which afterward in the own place the restlesse objection and continuall opposition of politick men and court sycophants against presbyteriall government as incompatible with monarchy and their manners and the necessary assertion of the true policy of the church by divines in both kingdoms between whom there was no notable difference demonstrating that it was in it self unalterable because divine and yet complyable with every lawfull kinde of humane policy and civill government and able to keep a whole kingdom or state in a right and sure way of religion

our chiefest reformers had indeed their education in other churches which was the goodnesse of god to them and us there did they see examples of reformation and conversed with other reformers by whom they were taught from the word in the wayes of god and thence did they bring as the romans their laws of old from greece and other nations models

of that comparing one with another they might fix upon that which was builded upon the foundation of the apostles
like as we accompt it no small happines that we have bin educated in the church of scotland and are acquainted with the practice of there which giveth us much light and confidence against such scruples and doubtings as are powerfull enough to suspend the assent of others who by reason of their education in other churches are strangers unto it
nor do we know a reason why education in sound doctrine and true worship should be accompted a matter of thanksgiving to god and yet should glory in this that we are not by education ingaged in any one form of of discipline and but left to our selves to be moulded by our own private thoughts

they intended and designed from the beginning

the government of the church by assemblies and presbyteries although they could not attain that perfection at first in the infancie of reformation but gave place to necessity which in such cases is universall and in this they followed the example and practice of the churches planted by the apostles which if not at first yet afterward were of greater number in one city then did or could ordinarily assemble in one place for the worship of god and therefore had a plurality of pastors and officers which made up a common presbytery for governing the whole they set up such officers in the church as were both necessary and sufficient for the church pastors teachers ruling elders and deacons they did not permit such as are called laymen and intended to continue such to preach or prophesie in the congregation nor did they admit of any other ruling elders but such as are solemnly elected and ordained although they do maintain themselves

upon their own means and attend their own particular callings which is not incompatible with their office especially they being appointed in a number competent and proportionable to the number of the people and quantity of the congregation and their ecclesiasticall charge not being pastorall nor requiring any great meditation or study apart but such as they may easily attend without neglect of their owne particular affaires

what shall be rendred unto the magistrate by others

whose particular tenets are not yet known either to the church or magistrate unlesse it be in a hid and secret way unto which we are not privy we cannot determine but the doctrine of the reformed churches concerning the honour and obedience due to the magistrate is openly known by their confessions of faith and long continued practices and this much we know that the principles both of civill and are laid out in scripture and therefore the one cannot be contrary to the other or they inconsistent between themselves
nor do wee measure the power of the magistrate by the principles of presbyteriall government but both of them by the word and therefore deny not unto the magistrate what god giveth them and more then this dare we not professe for any respect to our selves or to the form of ecclesiasticall government professed by us how much and for what ends the pagans and infidels of old the papists prelates and arminians of late have laboured to make the way of christ hatefull to princes and magistrates is too well known and hath been bitterly felt yet god hath cursed this policy in the end
there may bee good reason to expresse our judgement of this or other points of duty from scripture but to avouch when we

are not challenged and that only in the generall by way of comparison that we ascribe more to the magistrate then the reformed churches doe they being faithfull to their own principles of ecclesiasticall government may suffer a harder construction then we our selves would willingly or put upon the intentions of men who seek not their own things but the things of jesus christ

as the blessed instruments of reformation proceeded by no other rule but the word of god

so did they with great judgement and learning which they had in a measure above others examine and frame all things diligently and exactly according to the rule and although the reformers in england were either altogether or for the greater part taken up with the doctrine yet in the church of scotland it was otherwise
after the doctrine was established which was speedily done they were exercised in conferences and assemblies with debating the matters of discipline and government above the space of years which endured much opposition from authority from worldly men and from the adversaries of the truth both prelaticall on the one hand and upon the other hand separatists of which sort some came into scotland from england which was unto them a whetstone to quicken them and to make them the more circumspect exact in their way which lay in the middle betwixt episcopacy upon the one hand and popular confusion on the other
it pleased the lord whose presence and blessing they sought after in these dayes with frequent prayer and humiliation both in private and in the publike nationall assemblies so to assist and lead them in all truth that the church of scotland was honoured from abroad both from england and other nations with the testimony of such a reformation as other churches

accounted to be the greatest happinesse upon earth and when they were wishing after a reformation they made it the measure of their wishes
we would willingly shun comparisons were we not brought upon this straine we do upon very good reason judge the church of england in the midst of her ceremonies to have beene a true church and the ministery thereof notwithstanding the many blemishes and corruptions cleaving unto it to have been a true ministery and shall never deny unto them that praise whether in debating controversies with papists or in practicall divinity for private christians which they do most justly deserve
upon the other part we are neither so ignorant nor so arrogant as to ascribe to the church of scotland such absolute purity and perfection as hath not need or cannot admit of further reformation
yet that there is a wide difference betwixt the one and the other acknowledged also in the common covenant wee bring two famous witnesses from the church of england to prove the one is brightman loath would be saith he speaking of the church of scotland to provoke any man to envy or to grieve him with my words yet this must say there is no place where the doctrine soundeth more purely the worship of god is exercised more uncorruptly where more faithfull diligence of the pastor doth flourish or more free or willing obedience is given by the people nor yet where there is greater reverencing of the whole religion amongst all orders
and afterwards· neither doth it onely keep the doctrine of salvation free from corruption but it doth also both deliver in writing and exercise in practice that sincere manner of government whereby men are made partakers of salvation revel of the apocal cap

the other is cartwright yea the scottish nation which were some yeers behind us in the profession of the gospell the first day almost that they received

the truth did by many degrees in the way of purity outstrip us
these two witnesses unto which we might adde many other from the reformed churches in other nations bear testimony that there is no such thing in the church of scotland as might prove her to be no church or bar communion in worship with her as the liturgy ceremonies and prelacy in the church of england or that the corruptions of the one and the other are of the same kinde equally destructive of the essence of a church and equally impedetive of communion and worship
all visible churches which have been or shall be at any time on earth consist of persons good and bad sheep and goats wheat and tares such as walk christianly and such as walk inordinatly which therefore must also be the condition of the church of scotland yet the order of the church admitteth not either ignorant or openly prophane and scandalous persons to the participation of the lords supper if any pastor and particular eldership bee negligent in their duty it is their fault who are to beare their own guiltinesse and ought not to be imputed to the order of the church which standeth in force against it
we may be very confident that the godly people who did transplant themselves out of this island the fame of whose piety and zeal shall never suffer detraction or the smallest diminution from our thoughts or words might have lived in the church of scotland injoying the pure ordinances of god with peace in their consciences and comfort to their souls and would have willingly come into scotland when they went into could they have been free of the usurpation and tyranny of prelats and the prelatical party which at that time did reigne and rage in that kingdome vexing the godly ministery and people there with many and bitter sufferings

the two extreams of the true forme of

which standeth in the middle way betwixt popish and prelaticall tyranny and brownisticall and popular anarchie were contrary one to another and have their own degrees of tyranny or anarchie in themselves which is the cause of their fractions and differences amongst themselves but both sides agree and strongly joyne in opposing the true government which standing constantly and without variation between the one and the other is contrary to both
this is the true cause nor could it be otherwise that on what hand the invasion was hotest there the defence was strongest
against prelacie which had many friends and therefore made many enemies to presbyteries the presbyteriall power and pens were long pleading no sooner is the prelaticall party by the power and blessing of god begun to be subdued in this island but ariseth unexpectedly the opposition on the other hand waiting the opportunity stronger then it was before which moved some of our divines of late to write on this hand in defence of the government of the reformed churches as others had done before them in other churches
in france beza against morellius sadeel
two nationall synods also of the reformed churches in france the one at orleans in the year
another at rothel
and in all the reformed churches governed by presbyteries and assemblies the positive grounds of the government are laid open which work equally against adversaries on both sides and have been applyed against them prove nata as they did arise or shew themselves
if so much have not been written upon one hand as the other in a polemicall and anaskeuastick way let it be attributed unto the adversarie which was but obscure and weak and from

whom small danger was apprehended· it being laid for a common ground by them all that where a whole nation is converted to the christian faith every particular church is not to bee left to it selfe as if it were alone in a nation but that christ had provided a way and there is a necessitie of a common nationall governement to preserve all the churches in unitie and peace

it is the will of god

and hath been alwayes the constant course of divine providence that when his servants have been diligent in searching the truth and zealous by professing and preaching to hold it forth unto others that they confirme and seal the truth which they have beleeved and professed with their confession and suffering
the church of scotland had many confessours divers pastours brought before the lords of councell the high commission diocesan synods were removed from their places deprived of all the means of their livelyhood some confined others imprisoned a third sort brought into england whence some of them were never suffered to returne all of them for the government of the church
others for the same cause were proceeded against by the criminall judge condemned of treason sentenced to death and after long imprisonment before and after the sentence could finde no other mercy but perpetuall banishment wherein the greater part of them ended their dayes without any congregation or company of their owne nation rich or poore to comfort them
so many of these witnesses as were suffered to live in their owne land did not undergoe any voluntary exile but in much poverty and affliction went up and down teaching and confirming the good people and waiting for a spring time wherein the face of god might

again shine upon his church and to use their owne expression some buds might arise out of the stumpe of church government left in the earth
had they at that time abandoned the poore oppressed church when they were put from their places and deprived of their liberty and had carried away with them such of the people as were of their minde they had if wee would judge according to ordinary providence and the course of second causes opposed the poore desolated church for a prey to episcopall oppression and made the case of religion in that kingdome desperate or if they should have returned upon a revolution of extraordinary providence they would have preferred the sufferings of their brethren left behinde them in the midst of the fiery triall unto their owne exile and would have been loath to have impeded or retarded the late reformation with any thing they had brought with them from abroad so many as returned from constrained banishment having in all unitie of minde and heart joyned in the worke of reformation

the church of scotland

as all other reformed churches hath used the power of the keyes churchcensures of all sorts especially the gravest of excommunication with such sharpnesse and severity and yet with such caution and moderation as it hath been very powerfull and effectuall to preserve the name of god from being blasphemed the church and people of god from contagion and the delinquents brought under censure from destruction which are the ends proposed by them in executing the censures or the church and where such scandalls arise whether in matter of opinion or practise as are apt to make the name of god to be blasphemed are dangerous for the church and waste the consciences

of the sinners themselves being accompanied with obstinacie and contempt of ecclesiasticall authority they doe apply this last remedy according to the order prescribed by christ against scandalous transgressours to limit the censure of excommunication in matter of opinion to the common and uncontroverted principles and in the matter of manners to the common and universall practises of christianitie and in both to the parties knowne light is the dangerous doctrine of the arminians and socinians openeth a wide doore and proclaimeth liberty to all other practices and errors which are not fundamentall and universally abhorred by all christians and tendeth to the overthrow of the reformed religion which we wish all sound and sober spirits to abstain from lest it render them and their profession suspected of some such opinions and practises as in charity wee judge to be farre from their minds and wayes

two main objections are made against the principles and practise of the order and government of the reformed churches

for which the church and kingdome of scotland have done and suffered so much of old and of late
one is that there is no need of the authoritative power of presbiteries and synods and that the exhortation of particular churches one to another the protestation of one against another and the withdrawing of communion one from another may bee a sufficient remedy and no lesse effectuall against all offences then excommunication it selfe especially if the magistrate shall vouchsafe his assistance and interpose his authoritie for strengthening the sentence of noncommunion

to this we answer


that this objection supposeth a case which hath

not been found in the church of scotland for the space of above fourescore yeares and which wee beleeve was never heard of in any of the reformed churches except those of the separation the pronouncing of or excommunication against a whole church
our excommunication hath beene executed and but seldome against particular members never against a whole church and wee thinke never shall bee and therefore this imaginary feare of that which never falleth forth is not considerable rules are made for ordinary and usuall cases


what shall bee the remedy where the censure is mutuall and two or more churches mutually protest and pronounce the sentence of one against other unlesse there be a common presbyterie or synod made up of the whole which may decide the controversie and give order unto the severall churches
this may prove a mean of division rather then union

in this exhortation protestation and there is no more to be found then one particular member may doe against another which yet is acknowledged to bee unsufficient for removing of offences unlesse the authority of the church of which both of them bee members shall interveine were it in the power of particular members to submit or not submit as they please there would bee as great difference and division amongst members as now there is amongst churches


what shall be done if the magistrate be negligent or care for none of those things or if his authoritie cannot be obtained or if hee bee of another religion and foment the difference for his owne politicke ends

hath not the wisedome of the sonne of god provided remedies in the church for all the internall necessities of the church and constitute it a perfect body within it selfe


by what probabilitie can it be made to appeare to any rationall man and indifferent minde that no authoritie shall be as valide as authority against the obstinate that via admonitionis requisitionis is equall with via citationis publicae authoritatis there cannot be so much as triall and examination of the offence without authoritie unlesse the partie be willing to appeare that perswasion and jurisdiction that the delivering over to satan and thereby striking the conscience with the terrour of god by the authority of jesus christ which hath the promise of a speciall and strong ratification in heaven and any other ecclesiasticall way whatsoever which must be inferiour to this and depend onely upon perswasion on the one part and free will on the other can be supposed to bee a like efficacious
no man will say but in civill matters it is one thing to have adoe with our neighbour who hath no more authority over us then we have over him and another thing to have to doe with civill power which hath authority over both

the other objection is

that by this authoritie and order of government one church hath power over another which is contrary to that liberty and equalitie christ hath endued his churches with and is no other but a new prelaticall dominion set over the churches of christ

to this we answer


that we are very farre from imposing or acknowledging any such collaterall power of one particular

church over another nay not of the greatest in all respects whatsoever over the smallest for god hath made them equall one to another
the power which we maintain is aggregative of the officers of many congregations over the particular members of their corporation even as a member of the naturall body is not subject to another but each one of them to the whole man consisting of them all and as one member of parliament one counseller or to goe lower one member of a company is not subject to another but every one to the whole colledge the same may bee said of townes and cities so is it with particular congregations combined in one presbyterie
all the reformed churches acknowledge the independencie of one particular church upon another


it is as miserable a mistake to compare presbyteries and prelates together for the courts of prelates are altogether forraign and extrinsecall to the congregations over which they rule and then indeed the metropolitan church usurpeth and tyrannizeth over other churches but the power of presbeteries in intrinsecall and naturall they being constitute of the pastors and elders of the particular congregations over which they are set so that another without themselves doth not beare rule over them but all of them together by common consent doe rule over every one which is a most milde and free forme of it being no more contrary to the liberty of a particular church to bee ruled by a common collegiate presbytery or ecclesiastick senate then it is for a member of a particular congregation to bee ruled by his owne particular eldership


were this way of government as well known by

experience unto others as it is unto us it would bee accounted rather subsidium then dominium and would be looked at rather as auxiliary to particular ministers and elderships then authoratative over them especially since they neither ordain nor depose ministers they discern no censure nor sentence of excommunication of any member without the knowledge and consent of the congregation which is particularly concerned therein whatsoever their authority be the minister and particular eldership are advised assisted and strengthned rather then commanded enjoyned or forced which the particular churches should much rather chuse then through want of counsell and assistance suffer themselves to run rashly upon deposition or excommunication and afterward either be brought to the neighbouring churches to the publike confession of their errour which lesseneth their authority afterward or to have the sentence of pronounced against them which must bee the cause of schisme or scandall

so much for the present have we said

not for confutation but meerely for justifying our owne and other reformed churches against such misrepresentings and mistakings as in matters of religion are too frequent in this place at this time to the perverting and abusing of simple and unstable minds which will never be brought to a consistence and unitie without this true order and governement of the church and the blessing of god from heaven upon his owne ordinance
were magistrates and civill powers acquainted with the power thereof they would finde their authority increased their worke more easie and their places more comfortable thereby
such as are most adverse to this order and government if they allow no materiall difference in doctrine

worship or practise might enjoy their peace and all the comforts of their ministery and profession under it without controlment from that authoritative power which they so much apprehend
the church of england which god hath blessed with so much learning and pietie by this reformation and uniformitie with other reformed churches which all of us have solemnely sworn and subscribed sincerely really and constantly through the grace of god to endeavour in our severall places and callings should be a praise in the earth

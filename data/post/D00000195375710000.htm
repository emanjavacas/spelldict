the epistle dedicatory to mrs elizabeth briggs widow of the deceased capt john briggs

madam

the meanness of the following discourse would have been an effectual bar to its publication had not your desire usher'd it into the world
the first thing of mine that came forth from the press was a sermon occasioned by the decease of your beloved daughter and concluded you would not take it well if denied you the liberty of reading that discourse which was preached at your husband's funeral in a fairer character than mine own
besides that divine blessing which hope attended the publication of the former gave me the greater encouragement to expose the latter to publick view


am not so vain as to think printing this sermon will advance my reputation among learned and judicious readers it is more likely to produce a contrary effect but if god should bless it to the conversion of one sinner or the building up of one saint hope shall rejoice more than if gained the greatest applause thereby
tho it be not meat for strong men yet hope it may be milk for babes
to conclude that he who hath promised to be an husband to the widow and a father to the fatherless would put his everlasting arms under you and sanctify all the dispensations of his providence to you that he would shower down the choicest of his blessings upon you and the fruit of your womb that your children may tread in the steps of their deceased father and their living mother is the sincere desire of your friend and servant

for we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens

man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward
various are the miseries and calamities which attend the human race during their continuance in and pilgrimage through the waste and howling wilderness of this world
and sincere christians are so far from obtaining an immunity and freedom from temporal evils while in a mortal state that they generally have the greatest share of them but they have those cordials to support and revive their spirits under the pressure of afflictive providences whereof others are wholly destitute
we need look no further for an instance of this than the chapter preceding that which my text begins wherein the apostle having mentioned those sufferings

which himself and his brethren underwent for their stedfast adherence to and endeavours to propagate the gospel he gives an account of those things which afforded them comfort and support under such deplorable circumstances whereof the hope of future glory was not the least which he proposes in the close of that chapter and farther prosecutes in the words of my text for we know that if our

the method that shall take in speaking to these words shall be


to explain them
ii
to apply them


shall explain them and in order to a regular and distinct explication of them shall take notice of these four following things contain'd in them
first a description of the state and condition of the human body in this life our earthly house of this tabernacle
secondly an implicit assertion of its dissolution if it were dissolved
thirdly a description of the blessed state and habitation of the saints after the dissolution of their bodies we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens
fourthly the comfortable knowledg and assurance which the apostle and other christians had concerning their present right to and future fruition of this blessedness we know

first a description of the state and condition of the human body in this life our earthly house of this tabernacle

that this is a description of the body in its mortal state is evident both from the text and context
tho the apostle here speaks particularly of believers yet what is said concerning the present frame and condition of their bodies is applicable to the corporeal part of all mankind
the earthly house of this tabernacle or this earthly house or tabernacle for when two synonymous words are made use of in the description of the same thing the latter is sometimes put in the genitive case instead of their being joined together by the conjunction or thus numb
this is the ordinance of the law this is the ordinance or law and in several other places
more particularly there are two things observable in this part of the text
the things to which he compares man's body viz an house and a tabernacle

the epithet which he gives it earthly

the things to which he compares man's body viz an house or a tabernacle for these words must not be taken in a proper and literal but in a figurative and metaphorical sense
first he compares it to an house
this denomination is given to human bodies job
they are called houses of clay
the body may be compared to an house for two reasons


because of the curiosity of its structure
some art and skill must be exercised in building an house that

all its parts may be commodious and bear a due and comely proportion to each other
the divine architect hath displayed his wisdom as well as his power in the formation of the human body we are fearfully and wonderfully made and our substance was curiously wrought psal
tho it is made of a vile material yet it hath a noble and excellent form yea the matter it self is sublimated and refined there is nothing wanting that is necessary for use and there is nothing superfluous or
but shall not now anatomize the human body lead you into all the rooms of this stately and compact fabrick or shew you the curiosity of every part


because it is an habitation for the soul
man is said to dwell in this house of clay job
conceive man is here by a synecdoche put for the soul which is the superiour part of man
the soul dwells in the body as an inhabitant in an house only with this difference there is a formal union between the soul and body which there is not between a man and the house wherein he dwells
and the body in this respect bears a resemblance to an house in three things


in its inferiority to the soul in worth and excellence
as a man is of more worth than the most stately and costly palace that can be inhabited by him so is the soul of more value than the body wherein it resides and which is inform'd by it
in the body there are visible footsteps of god but the divine image is stampt and pourtray'd upon the soul
the image of god in man consists not in what is seen but in what is not seen god expresly saith that none saw a similitude of him deut
which had not been true if man in regard of his body had been the image and similitude of god for then a figure of god had been seen every day as often as we saw a

man or beheld our selves
tho many of the children of men are destitute of god's moral image consisting in knowledg righteousness and true holiness yet every human soul bears his natural image in its spiritual nature and properties
surely the more remote from matter and the more like to the supream spirit any being is the greater is its excellency


in its usefulness and subserviency to the soul
as the house is erected for the use of the inhabitant and the several rooms thereof are prepared for his service and all the affairs therein are managed and conducted by him so the body was framed for the service of the soul tho sin often renders it injurious to its noble inhabitant
the motions of the bodily members are all directed and guided by that intelligent spirit which is seated in it

in the independence of the soul upon the body as to its operations and existence
an inhabitant can act without and may exist separate from his habitation
there are many operations of the soul while it lodges in the body which it puts forth independently from the body and whereto the corporeal part doth not at all concur
and when the soul shall be dislodged from this it will still have an existence
this noble inhabitant shall not be buried in the ruines of that earthly tabernacle
tho the life of the man is destroy'd by the separation of the soul from the body because it consists in their union yet the life of the soul which hath no dependence on such an union is not destroy'd thereby
the soul animates the body but the body conveys no life to the soul
secondly the body is compared to a tabernacle

the apostle peter gives the same denomination to his body pet
yea think it meet as long as

am in this tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance knowing that shortly must put off this my tabernacle

and the body may be compared to a tabernacle for two reasons


because of the short continuance of the soul in it
a tabernacle is opposed to a fix'd habitation heb
they who only sojourned in a place and were speedily to remove from it did in former times erect tabernacles for themselves
indeed our bodies are rather tabernacles wherein we sojourn for a little time than houses wherein we have a fix'd habitation we are pilgrims and strangers in the earth our immortal souls will soon take their flight from our bodies
we often read of the brevity of man's life in the holy scriptures
man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble
he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not job
man's life is compared to a vapour which soon vanisheth james to smoke which quickly disappears psal to the grass which is withered by the summer sun or cut down by the sharp scythe isa
it is said to be swifter than a weaver's shuttle which quickly runneth from one side of the web to the other its motion is represented by the telling of a tale the sailing of a ship in the mighty ocean and the flight of an eagle towards its prey it is compared to an hand's breadth yea to nothing psal
how short is the life of man in this world if compared with the eternal duration of god or with the life which we shall live in the other world yea the life of man in our days is exceeding short if compared with the lives of the antediluvian fathers
there are but a few steps between our cradles and our graves they who live longest in the

body live but a little time but how short is the continuance of some in this world who are cut off in their flourishing age in the morning of their days we are all hastily marching to eternity and shall shortly come to our journey's end


because of its weakness and frailty
tabernacles were but slightly built very weak and infirm structures they were not made of durable matter nor fix'd upon strong foundations
our bodies those houses of clay wherein our souls reside are said to have their foundation in the dust job
the strength of a building lies very much in its foundation and that edifice which hath but weak walls being strongly founded may last long but when the building is weak and the foundation weak also in how tottering a condition is such a fabrick the foundation of man's body is sand or dust and the word signifies unstable moveable dust such as lies upon the surface of the earth and is carried away with every puff of wind
man in his best estate is altogether vanity on the account of his corporal frailty and weakness his strength is not as the strength of brass or of stones but he is like a reed shaken with the wind
how small a matter will make a change and alteration in the body how soon will the gust of a violent distemper like a furious wind blow it down to the ground so weak is the body that we have more cause to wonder at its standing so long than at its falling so soon

we may observe the epithet which the apostle gives to the body earthly it is an earthly house or tabernacle
this epithet may be given it upon a fourfold account


upon the account of the matter whereof it is formed
it is made of earth clay or dust
the sacred historian tells us that the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground gen
and that the woman was formed of a rib taken out of the man's body ver
when the great jehovah came to pass sentence upon man for the breach of his law he put him in mind of his original and frame as to his corporeal part dust thou art out of it wast thou taken gen
and if our first parents were formed of the dust we who are their were formed of their substance and proceeded from their loins must be also formed of the same matter
elihu acknowledges that he was formed out of the clay job
the psalmist tells us that god knoweth our frame he remembreth that we are dust psal
our bodies are breathing clay animated earth


upon the account of its situation or the place wherein it is pitched it dwells in it is erected upon the earth
tho angelick spirits were originally placed in the superiour world heaven was their first habitation yet the human body was lodged in the earth at its first formation this is the place of its residence and must be while in its present state and condition
flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god cor
heaven is too pure an air for our animal bodies to breath in till they shall be purified and refined and endued with those excellent qualities which will fit them for such a noble region
therefore so long as our souls continue in our bodies they have but an earthly lodging tho their motions and operations may reach to heaven yet their essential residence is in the earth on this account while we are present in the body we are absent from the lord cor
while we dwell in this tabernacle we sojourn in a polluted and

troublesome world a place to which sin hath introduced the greatest disorder and confusion where iniquity abounds and where many occasions of grief are continually ministred to us a vale of tears a field of war a stage of contention and a waste and howling wilderness


upon the account of those means whereby it is supported and refreshed
our bodies in their present state would immediately fall if they were not propp'd up and repair'd by earthly comforts viz
meat drink physick and raiment
all the conveniences of life which we value and prize which we industriously labour for and after which our affections do often run in an immoderate degree are nothing better than earth
an earthly body is only capable of earthly enjoyments

upon the account of its disposure and resolution
when death rends the soul from the embraces of the body then the dust returns to the earth as it was eccles

it is turned into common earth and laid in a bed of dust
thus much for the description of the state and condition of the human body in this life
proceed secondly to the second thing contain'd in the words viz
an implicite assertion of its dissolution if it were dissolved

tho the conditional conjunction undefined span alphabet if is here made use of yet it doth not import any hesitation or doubt in the apostle's mind concerning the dissolution of his body as if it were uncertain whether it should be dissolved or not but that conjunction hath the same signification here with the adverb undefined span alphabet when and so the words may be render'd thus when our earthly house of this tabernacle shall be dissolved
we find that this particle hath the same signification

joh
joh
so that these words do amount to an assertion of the body's dissolution for what comfort could arise to the apostle and his from the thoughts of their entrance into an heavenly habitation after the dissolution of their bodies if they were not assured that some time or other they should be dissolved we read of a twofold dissolution made by death in sacred writ viz a dissolution of the person or the man phil

desire to depart or as the original word may properly be render'd to be dissolved this consists in the separation of the soul from the body and a dissolution of the body in my text
this is a metaphor taken from the destruction of buildings the overthrow of earthly fabricks when a structure is demolished it is said to be dissolved for so the original word whereby the ruine of the temple is exprest mat
mark
most properly signifies
in allusion hereunto the death of the body is called its dissolution
now pursuant to the metaphor several things are imply'd in the body's dissolution


the continuance of its matter after death
when an house is demolished tho it loseth its form yet the matter still remains it is not annihilated
the matter of the human body passeth through various changes after death yet it is not reduced to nothing for if it were at the great day there could not be a resurrection but a new creation of human bodies whereas the scripture assures us that the same body which dies shall live and rise again tho it may be accidentally and with respect to its qualities another body yet it will be essentially and with respect to its substance the same


the destruction of its form
when a building falls its form is lost tho its matter remains the same

effect doth death produce in the body
herein these two things may be comprehended


the loss of its beauty and comeliness
what beauty is there in the rubbish of the most splendid and stately palace surely there is nothing in it that can attract the admiration and esteem of those who behold it
they who delighted to view and walk in a house while standing will turn their eyes from its ruines
the beauty of the most amiable body becomes a prey to death when it is seized by this mighty conqueror
death draws a dismal vail over all its glory and makes very unlovely and deforming impressions on it
the bodies of our deceased relatives which we formerly beheld with great delight would be now very unpleasant spectacles to us we cannot without regret turn our eyes towards the corps of our dearest friend but are willing soon to bury it out of our sight

the loss of its excellency and usefulness
what value is there in the rubbish of a fallen sructure which while standing was worth many thousands or what use can it serve for tho a living body is exceeding valuable yet a dead body is of no more worth than common earth and it is as useless and unprofitable
the eyes tongue hands and feet which were all active members and perform'd many operations when seized by death become wholly unactive they lose their motion and activity when bound with its adamantine chains and fetters
those bodies of our relations which were very serviceable to us while in the land of the living can do us no good when numbred among the dead


in the dissolution of the body may be imply'd its entrance into the grave and corrupting there
a standing house is raised above the ground but a fallen house

lies level with it and the materials thereof are separated and divided
when mens bodies die they are laid in the grave which is the house appointed for all living they enter into the place of silence and of darkness and there they moulder away and crumble to dust


herein may be implied the various ways whereby the structure of the human body decays and is destroyed
some buildings fall down of themselves time the consumer of all material things upon the earth destroys them other fabricks are blown down by violent winds others fall by the force of devouring flames and others are demolish'd by men
in like manner some mens bodies may be said even to fall of themselves because no internal distemper nor external violence is the cause of their dissolution old age hath dried up their natural moisture exhausted their strength and brought them down to the dust their life was like a lamp that goes out when there is no more oil to feed it
the bodies of others are destroyed by the immediate stroke of god's hand some bodies are burnt up by the heat or blown down by the blast of violent distempers others fall by human force and violence

that our bodies must be dissolved we have a sacred assurance from the god that made them he hath told us that the body must return to the earth from whence it came that he will bring us to death and to the grave which is appointed for all living
it is appointed for all men once to die heb
this appointment is accomplished upon our every day man goes to his long home and the mourners continually walk about the streets yea many of our dear relatives have been rent from our embraces and hurried into the gloomy territories of the king of terrors some whose bodies were stronger than

ours and seem'd more able to hold out against a besieging enemy
do not the continual totterings and shakings of our earthly tabernacles and the frequent repairs which they stand in need of portend their downfal so that the living may many ways know that they must die

thirdly proceed to that description which the apostle gives of the blessed state and habitation of the saints after death
we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens

the apostle carries on the same metaphor in the latter part which he made use of in the former part of the verse
as he compares the soul's residence in the body to that of an inhabitant in an house so he represents the glory and felicity of the soul after the dissolution of the body by its entrance into and abode in a more glorious habitation
but what this house is whereof the apostle speaks is not yet agreed among expositors some do thereby understand the same body which the soul now dwells in and must be dislodged from when raised again at the last day
others think the apostle intends that glory and blessedness into which the souls of believers enter immediately after their separation from their bodies
it is certainly true that the earthly tabernacles of the saints shall not always lie in the dust that the divorce between their souls and them will not be perpetual but they shall be raised from their graves and reassumed by their antient possessors and then the soul will have a more noble habitation than now it hath the body will be much more excellent and glorious than it is in its mortal state and it is as certain that the soul will not be without an habitation when it is by its great landlord turned out of its earthly house but will enter into the blissful regions above
conceive the latter

to be principally intended for the apostle comforts himself with the hopes of that glory to which death would introduce him when our earthly house of this tabernacle is dissolved we have a building of god an house we shall enter into it and become possessors of it and in the following verses he expresseth a vehement desire to be discharged from his body that he might enter into this house now he would partake of the glory of the resurrection never the sooner for his speedy dissolution the bodies of all the saints will be raised and glorified at the same time
however shall not exclude but include the former sense in my farther discourse of these words wherein we have a twofold account of this building or house viz
negative and affirmative


negative it is a building an house not made with hands
this character agrees to the glorious habitation of the saints above in opposition to all terrene structures
the splendid palaces wherein earthly monarchs dwell were contrived by human skill and fram'd by the hands of men and consequently all their excellency and glory is of a carnal and sensible nature
the tabernacle in the wilderness was contriv'd by god himself and yet because man had an hand in the erection thereof it is said to be made with hands heb
but that glorious house in which the saints shall dwell when they leave their bodies was neither contriv'd by human art nor fram'd by human strength no creatute was instrumental to the erection of that stately fabrick and the glory thereof is not of a carnal and sensible nature and the saints bodies at the resurrection may in some sense be said to be made without hands in opposition to those bodies which they now carry about with them because tho these structures

will be materially the same that now they are yet there will be an accidental alteration in them and whereas man was instrumental to their first production tho god only was their principal efficient yet they shall be raised again by the immediate operation of god
it is observable that the human body of our blessed lord is called a tabernacle not made with hands heb
not only in from the jewish tabernacle but also from all other human bodies because no active principle but divine power produced it


this building or house is described affirmatively and that from three things its efficient its situation and its duration

it is described from its efficient god it is a building of god the preposition undefined span alphabet to which god is subjoined denotes the efficient cause
the excellency of any building is sutable to its contriver and builder
seeing divine wisdom and power infinitely surpass human surely the works of god's hands must transcend the works of mens hands
the glorious place above is called a city whose builder and maker is god heb
now this world which is the saints present habitation being made by god surely something more must be intended by his erection of this house than the immediate creation thereof by him
it can import nothing less than that the divine being hath exerted more of his power wisdom and goodness in this than in any other fabrick which he hath erected and that the blessedness of the triumphant saints is more immediately derived from god than any thing that is enjoyed in a mortal state
and there will be a more admirable display of the divine glory in the resurrection of the saints bodies than there was in their creation they will become as glorious and perfect as human bodies can be


from its situation in the heavens
it is observable that some words are in the new testament put in the plural instead of the singular number particularly undefined span alphabet heavens for undefined span alphabet heaven mat
in my text and several other places with a design as conceive emphatically to denote the excellency and glory of that lofty region
not the aerial or aetherial but the imperial heaven is here intended
this is a place far superior to the earth and therefore an entrance into and abode in it is sometimes mentioned as comprehensive of all that felicity which is possest by those that inhabit it
when the soul of a believer quits its earthly tabernacle it mounts up as on eagle's wings to the heavenly temple
this is the habitation of god's holiness there the great jehovah in a special manner dwells there are the brightest discoveries of the divine splendor and the highest adorations given to his most excellent majesty there the glorified courtiers do not behold him through a glass darkly but see him face to face
in that building dwells and reigns the lord jesus the mediator of the new covenant when we shall be absent from the body we shall be present with the lord cor
the heaven must receive him until the times of restitution of all things
there dwell an innumerable company of glorious angels far more glorious than any of the princes of this world and all the spirits of just men that are made perfect
this is not an habitation of violence and oppression for no unclean thing can enter there
the inhabitants of this house are out of the reach of satan and his malicious they are not expos'd to the hostile attempts of the roaring lion of hell or his whelps upon earth they are liable to no troublesome changes exercises perplexing disappointments corroding cares or sinful infirmities
this

is a delectable and secure habitation here is fulness of joy here are rivers of pleasures which constantly refresh the glorified soul
in this house is light without darkness day without night joy without sorrow and singing without weeping
the soul that enters into this house hath the most intimate fellowship with god the master of it and a refreshing communion with the blessed angels and saints who cohabit with it therein all things in this house are sutable to the grandure and magnificence of the structure
and when the saints bodies shall come forth from their houses of silence and darkness and be reunited to their souls they shall be received together with them into the heavenly jerusalem and shall share with them in the felicity of that blessed seat


it is described from its duration eternal
this conceive is predicated of this heavenly habitation in opposition to the frailty of our earthly tabernacles which must be dissolved and then all our temporal comforts and delights will vanish we shall no longer enjoy them

the celestial city hath immoveable foundations it is subject to no decay or dissolution its duration will run parallel with the ages of eternity and the glory of that place will last as long as the place it self it is called a crown an incorruptible inheritance and an everlasting kingdom
the divine being in the vision and fruition of whom the happiness of glorified saints principally consists is to everlasting
moreover their abode in this house will be as lasting as the building they shall never be dispossest of or expell'd from it
tho the first adam was driven out of an earthly paradise yet the spiritual seed and of the second adam shall never be expell'd the heavenly one and when their bodies

shall rise from their beds of dust they will live to die no more death will have no power to demolish these curious fabricks for it shall be swallowed up in victory cor
this mortal shall then put on immortality
tho a little time wastes and consumes our bodies in their present state yet there shall be no diminution of their excellency and beauty in an endless eternity when we become the children of the resurrection these buildings will be always kept in their vigor and glory by the immediate power of the supream architect
proceed

fourthly to the comfortable knowledg and assurance which the apostle and other christians had concerning their present right to and future fruition of this blessedness we know
herein we may consider the subject we and the predicate know


the subject we
the apostle here speaks only of those that were real christians who had sincerely closed with and were united to the blessed jesus they only have a right and title to and therefore they only have ground to expect and hope for this glorious habitation
they who come not under such a character have reason to fear that when their earthly tabernacles shall be dissolved their souls will enter into a different habitation
an house indeed contrived by infinite wisdom and framed by almighty power and an eternal house but not in heaven but in hell an house where there is blackness of darkness inconceiveable grief and intolerable torment an house prepared for the devil and his angels wherein the wicked must cohabit with and be tormented by those apostate spirits who left their primitive habitation for evermore an house wherein they shall be exiles from god's

comfortable presence and every thing that is either really good or esteemed so by them
but conceive the apostle speaks not here of all saints for tho they may know and have ground to hope that when their souls are dislodged from their bodies they shall enter into this blissful habitation yet all believers have not attained to this knowledg and assurance thereof clouds and darkness do overspread some gracious souls and they are filled with many doubts and fears concerning their spiritual and eternal state
but he speaks concerning himself and some other christians who had attained to and were in the exercise of this knowledg
this leads me to the second thing viz


the predicate know
this knowledg here spoken of is a certain knowledg a firm and full perswasion that when their bodies should be dissolved their souls should be received into heaven
there are several things included in this knowledg viz a firm belief of a future state of blessedness provided for the saints and into which they shall enter after death
this might be known from the holy scriptures wherein we have a sufficient confirmation of this sacred truth
moreover a firm perswasion that they were interested in christ and made meet for the inheritance of the saints in light
this they might know by comparing themselves with those marks and characters of the heirs of salvation which were laid down in sacred writ by the lively exercise of their faith upon christ and by the testimony of the holy spirit bearing witness with their spirits that they were the children of god
lastly an assurance of their preservation in a state of grace to a state of glory
this they might fairly collect from the word of god wherein there is a full account of the everlastingness of the covenant of grace the immutability of divine love

the efficacy of christ's death together with the constancy and prevalence of his intercession and the perpetual residence of the holy spirit the earnest of the heavenly inheritance in his royal palaces and holy temples
our apostle expresseth the like assurance tim

henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judg shall give me at that day
holy job also exprest his assurance of future glory in his adverse state job
know that my redeemer liveth and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth
and tho after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall see god tho all who have a faith of affiance do not attain to a faith of assurance yet it is attainable in a mortal state
thus much by way of explication

ii
shall present you with some inferences from the words

first infer the prodigious folly of those who give their bodies the preference to their souls
it is the part of a wise man to value things in proportion to their worth and excellency
but the generality of mankind show that their corporeal part hath a greater share of their esteem than their spiritual part they carefully provide food and raiment for the former but never seek after the bread of life to feed and the robe of christ's righteousness to array the latter
they will labour hard to erect or purchase a comfortable habitation for their bodies but do not at all endeavour to secure an happy for their souls when they enter into an invisible world they will hazard the loss of their souls to secure their bodies from temporal evils or to procure those things

which will gratify the sensitive appetite
what madness is it to prefer a clod of earth to a spirit is not that a foolish soul that values its more than it self and will expose it self to eternal ruine for the preservation of its earthly tabernacle what stupid fools are they who esteem their bodies which are continually advancing towards and must speedily return to the dust more than their souls which shall survive them and live for evermore surely such persons are as the horse or as the mule which have no understanding

secondly infer the folly of those who are proud of or glory in their corporeal strength or beauty
as men are apt to boast of the exact form and strength of those houses wherein their bodies dwell so likewise of the excellency of those bodies wherein their souls tabernacle
but this will appear very foolish to us if we consider our frame and remember that we are dust
our bodies were formed of the same matter for kind that we trample under our feet and disdain to touch with our fingers
tho our bodies are very robust yet they are but earthen vessels and will soon be broken to pieces
in a very short time our bodies must be dissolved and then all their beauty and strength will vanish and become a prey to the king of terrors
thirdly infer the vanity of placing our happiness in our living comforts our near and dear relations

we are exceeding prone to let out our affections immoderately towards them to give them too high a place too large a room in our hearts to think our selves happy in an husband wife or children not considering they are frail mortal creatures
they can be no longer enjoy'd by us than while their souls continue in their bodies and

those curious fabricks which we behold with pleasure and delight keep their station
did we seriously consider what frail brittle houses their souls inhabit how soon they may be demolished and in how short a time they shall be dislodged from them we should see it highly reasonable to moderate our affections towards them let the everliving everlasting god be the darling of our souls and the soveraign of our affections

fourthly infer how necessary it is for us all speedily to endeavour after a right and title to an heavenly habitation
to confirm this assertion and to press you to this duty shall offer these things that follow to your consideration

your souls are designed to a perpetual residence in some habitation
the father of spirits hath resolved to preserve the being and life of your souls for evermore no period shall ever be put to their existence and therefore when they leave their present habitation they must enter into another
there are but two receptacles of departed souls viz an heavenly paradise and an infernal lake when your immortal spirits are divorced from your bodies they must either ascend to the former or descend to the latter
and how can you bear to think of dwelling with consuming fire and abiding with everlasting burnings


your bodies shall enter into the same habitation when by your souls into which your souls enter when divested of your bodies
your souls go after death there will your bodies be disposed after the resurrection
if the noble inhabitant dwells in heaven the house that it dwelt in upon earth when rebuilt shall be fixt in that glorious region this earthly

tabernacle shall become a celestial structure but if it be cast into hell the raised body must stand in that direful prison as an everlasting monument of divine wrath
by making provision for your souls you will also secure the felicity of your bodies their true interest is inseparable


how terrible will the agonies of death be to us if we see our selves destitute of a title to eternal life they who have disregarded their future state when the evil day of death seem'd to be at a distance from them have had very aweful and terrible thoughts about it when it hath made sensible approaches to them
with what horror will your souls be seised when death sits upon your quivering lips if you apprehend that they shall be speedily expelled your bodies and eternally excluded the heavenly building
this life is the only time for securing an interest in this glorious habitation
as the tree falls so it must eternally lie death will fix us in an unalterable and unchangeable state
those spirits that are now in prison will find no place for repentance tho they should seek it with tears


the time of our souls residence in our bodies is very uncertain
persons are very apt to defer this weighty and important business some put it off to old age others to a some think it will be time enough to seek after another habitation when the strength of their earthly tabernacles decays and they feel them shake and totter our lives will be but short at longest and how short they will be we know not
some are cut off in the morning of their days others in their full strength we are not sure that age will snow upon our heads before they are laid in the dust or that the structure of our bodies will by any loud crack give us notice of its downfal
some bodies

are demolished by a speedy and sudden stroke their souls are turn'd out of them without any warning
let us therefore speedily seek that city which is above

would you sinners get a title to this habitation then come to christ and sincerely close with him it is not to be purchased with your money nor procured by your labour if you accept of jesus you shall freely receive it if you persist in your stubborn rejection of him you shall never obtain it
heaven is a purchased possession christ hath bought it with the invaluable price of his precious blood and if he become yours that shall be yours also you will have a sure title to it which can never be lost but will issue in an actual possession of it
if you lay hold of christ with the hand of faith while you live you may securely commit your souls into his hands when you come to die and say with expiring stephen acts
lord jesus receive my spirit

fifthly infer that saints should diligently endeavour to get an assurance of the happy disposure of their souls after their separation from their bodies
this is not unattainable by them this will not be unprofitable to them
it is their duty to labour after it and an attainment to it will be very beneficial and advantagious to them
this will comfort them under all the frailties and infirmities the perishings and decays of their outward man and mightily sweeten all the troubles and afflictions wherewith they are exercised during their continuance in it
this will familiarize death and render its approach welcome to them
death is terrible to nature the soul is naturally unwilling to leave its old nature cannot but abhor a dissolution besides violent pains do ordinarily attend the taking down of this earthly structure
but

they can embrace the king of terrors with joy and holy triumph who are able to say with the apostle tim

know whom have believed and am perswaded that he is able to keep that which have committed unto him against that day
we ought to give diligence to make our calling and election sure for so an entrance shall be ministred unto us abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and saviour jesus christ pet
but if we want this assurance we cannot comfortably walk through the valley of the shadow of death

but what trouble will possess our spirits if when our souls are going to be unclothed of their earthly house we know not whether ever they shall be clothed upon with an house which is from heaven if when they are launching into eternity we know not whether they are entring into a bright or a black eternity in order to our obtaining this assurance let us seriously and diligently search our hearts and try our ways put forth direct acts of faith upon christ and beg of god to shed abroad his love in our hearts by the holy ghost

sixthly infer what vast obligations believers are under to their blessed lord how highly are they obliged to him who descended from his imperial throne tabernacled among us dwelt in an house of clay and submitted to a dissolution that he might procure for them an eternal habitation with himself in the highest heavens by dying he conquered death so as to render it a blessed gain and advantage to them and to give them cause to triumph over it in their sharpest encounter with it
how should we love and live to that blessed jesus through whom we are more than conquerors over our last enemy who is gone to heaven to prepare a place

for us and will receive us into it that where he is there we may be also

seventhly infer that a believer's conversation ought to be in heaven
shall we not be frequently conversant in that glorious place where we hope eternally to dwell seeing we are strangers in the earth we should live like those who know they have no continuing city here
let us endeavour frequently to mount up on the wings of our thoughts and affections to the excellent glory
lastly infer that the saints have a solid ground of comfort under the death of their godly relatives
we cannot but mourn to see those structures wherein we took pleasure laid in the dust and going to be a feast for worms to think that we shall see the desire of our eyes no more in this world
but shall we not be comforted when we consider that their souls are gone into a far better habitation than they dwelt in while they cohabited with us that they have exchanged our embraces for christ's that they are now triumphing and rejoicing in the heavenly mansions that the loss is only ours they are gainers by their departure and e're long we shall go to them and dwell with them for evermore shall conclude with an address to the near relations of our deceased friend

must acknowledg your loss to be very great it is no small affliction to be depriv'd of such a loving husband and indulgent father yet you ought not to mourn as those who have no hope
they who observ'd his conversation might from thence take knowledg that he had been with jesus he adorn'd the doctrin of god his saviour he was a burning and shining light in the place where divine

providence fixt him therefore you have no ground to question his exchange of an earthly for an heavenly habitation and the church militant for the triumphant assembly of the
were it put to his choice whether he would stay where he is or return to you he would prefer the former to the latter
you ought humbly and silently to acquiesce in god's sovereign will who is righteous in all his ways and holy in all his works and to depend upon him who hath promised to be an husband to the widow and a father to the fatherless
let me exhort his children to an imitation of that excellent example which he hath set them and to a remembrance of and compliance with those wholsome instructions which he hath given them
these advantages you are now deprived of but a serious reflection upon them may be beneficial to you if not they will aggravate your guilt
it had been better for you to have descended from a turk or pagan than from such an eminent christian as your deceased father was if you prove degenerate children
how sad will it be if he who put up so many prayers for your salvation before the throne of grace should testify against you to the aggravation of your condemnation before the tribunal of justice he is gone before you must follow after how soon you know not death hath made three breaches in your family within the compass of a few years and shall not these frequent warnings put you in mind of your own change get an interest in christ that will be more valuable than the estate which your deceased father hath bequeathed to you so you may be able to say when you come to die we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of god an house not made with hands eternal in the heavens

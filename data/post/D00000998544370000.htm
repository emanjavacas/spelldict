An answere to a seditious pamphlet lately cast abroade by a Iesuite, with a discouerie of that blasphemous sect.
Let not him that girdeth on his armour, boast, as he that putteth it of.
Â¶Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queenes most excellent Maiestie.
THe Lord hath many wayes to bring the enemies of the Gospel to the loue thereof.
Especially he requireth of vs the defence of his trueth, and earnest prayer that such defense may reforme the iudgement and conscience of the aduersarie.
For though there were will and labour for the trueth on both sides (which is to be wished) yet it is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth; but in God that sheweth mercie.
This mercie we must pray at Gods hand, that our planting and watering may receiue of him daily and great increases.
Therefore, good reader, when this smal, or any great defense of the trueth cometh to thy hand, reioyce that the trueth is defended, that error and vanitie is discouered: but ioyne with that ioye a care to haue him brought into the waye of saluation, which either ignorantly or wilfully wandreth from the same.
Hate his errors, but in compassion pray for his reformation.
Who knoweth whom and when the Lord will call? Moreouer when thou seest the diligence and boldnes of the enemies so great in repayring the ruines of Babylon: pray also that we marking what wisedome they haue in their generation, may the rather be prouoked to greater diligence might infinishing the walles of Ierusale~.
Last of al let vs as manie as professe the Gospel, bring forth fruites worthie of the Gospel, least the Papists on the one side, and the godlesse familie of selfeloue on the otherside preuaile more and more against the trueth, for a iust punishment of our sinnes in contemning the Gospel, which by doctrine with discipline, and by mercie with iustice must be maintained, and bring forth fruite to the glory of God, and the peace of his Church for euer.
An answere to a seditious Pamphlet lately cast abroade by a Iesuite.
ALbeit the questions of religion, which the Papistes hold, haue bene by them alreadie from time to time maintained with all their iudgement and learning in their publique wrytings, and are also in writing sufficiently answered, to make all men see the trueth, that do not wilfully shut their eyes against it: yet notwithstanding, as Affrica is saide still to bring foorth some new monsters, so the schooles of the Romish church are continually occupied in forging some new misshapen arguments and instrume~ts against the Gospel, esteeming it great seruice to their general Prouost, to be still in the chalenge, though they receiue no honour in the fielde: still to cast out their dartes, though they be beaten back to the wounding of that head, they would most defend.
Hereupon it commeth that one Edmond ampion, a principal champion belike of ye opish religion, flying farre from the fielde some yeres past for want of armour, is now returned with furniture out of Germanie and Boeme, from Rome and other places, maketh, he one alone, like another Golias, ye chalenge, wherein whole armies heretofore haue had as great ouerthrowes, as euer had the Philistines by the arme of God fighting with Israel.
This Coronell doeth by a pamphlet most vnsittingly writte~ as to her Maiesties most honorable priuie Cou~sel, more vnsittingly scattered abroade, require disputation before all, and with all: and hauing in deede small hope to preuaile, and in trueth litle will to come to the triall (for he can not but see the heauie hand of God against him his cause) yet he hath a purpose to disturbe all by the very proclayming of this spiritual fight, and by giuing aime to them, that in the same league attempt otherwyse more dangerous matters against the state.
These letters comming to my hand, after had read them, and considered his insolent vaunts against ye trueth, ioyned with woordes pretending great humilitie, his protestation of zeale to saue soules, deliuered with matter that draweth them into damnable heresies, expected a present yssue by his personall answere, before them to whom such causes apperteine.
But not vnderstanding of any such yssue, and finding the letters to be more and more spred as Libels, abusing the name and holy authoritie of the Counsell, and that they prepare inconstant mindes to the mislike of religion, and desire of Poperie (which plainely appeareth to be the practise of the Champion in scattering them) thought it my dutie to answere the same, in respect of the publique iniurie offred to religion, with all humilitie offering this answere, or further proceeding with the saide Libell, to their honours most wise consideration.
But before come to ye particular points of his letters, am shortly to touch ye chiefe and onely matter therein pretended: which is a desire to haue a disputation graunted, or solemne audience for some sermons to bee made in the mayntenance of the most worthily abandoned Popish religion.
This petition seemeth to all Papists needfull, can not blame the~, for it would do them good to obteine, if it were but a question for somewhat, who haue right to nothing.
But would wo~der, if any which professe the Gospell should now looke for a disputation, to answere euery vaine chalenge, that after so many blessed yeeres, wherein error hath euery way bene confuted, the trueth established.
For our partes, we are so assured of the manifest trueth, that we make no doubt thereof.
For their parts, if they sought conference in a good conscience, with a desire to learne, it were necessary to regard their desires, to relieue their conscience.
But returning into the lande, with vngodly vowes and obstinate mindes to persist in their errors, and hauing hope with their maskes to deceiue many, it is meete to keepe them as farre from doing harme by their lies, as they withholde themselues farre from receiuing good by our trueth.
For to our profession they minde not to be brought, they are votaries to the contrarie.
What then shall we gaine by disputing with them, when they will not bee gained to the trueth? To our selues alreadie through the great mercie and power of God and his word, we haue by disputations made great gaine within the realme and abroade, and the same gaine increaseth to the saintes of God, with increase of sorowe and lamentation to all that yet haue traffique with the whore of Babylon.
Moreouer in this disputation to ouerthrowe the chalengers by the worde (as often their masters haue bene, and they easily may bee) what great victory can it bee ouer two or three of the last least in ye quarrel? They make accompt to gayne nothing indeede, yet by false report of some that stand readie prest, to post away ye newes of victorie, before there be a stroke striken, they may winne some piece of their desire.
Also they think it some profit, onely to barke against ye trueth.
But whe~ Rabshakeh came from Babylon, and blasphemed at the gates of Ierusalem, good Ezechias following the rule of Salomon commanded, saying, Answere ye him not.
And pray you, who of vs woulde in the things of this life yeelde to an euill minded man, that he should enter an action for the things, whereof we haue the right and quiet possession? But here the pretensed Catholiques are wise in their generation.
For when did they graunt to a free disputation, or to haue any sermons made by them of the religion, but beeing enforced thereunto? Yea, at this very time, howsoeuer this Champion and some others challenge and call for disputation, yet their forerunners, and fathers in Poperie refuse the same.
With what forehead then can these Iesuites demaund of vs, that themselues will not graunt? Or seeing it hath bene graunted at Auspurge, and at Poissy and els where, and they gained nothing by the graunt, why should they call the Ministers to an vnorderly disputation, from their ordinarie charge: wherein beside other dueties of their ministerie, they soundly confute by the plaine word of God, as occasion is offred, euen the chiefest arguments that the enemie can alledge? As for the trial these Iesuits wil make, it shalbe wt false weights, and measures, which are an abomination to the Lord: while, after their custome, they dispute with vnlearned and peeuish distinctions, false arguments, absurd interpretatio~s, plausible notwithstanding to them that haue a forestalled iudgement against the trueth.
But S. Paul warneth vs to auoide the~ that trouble the Church with such disputations and contentions.
For it is euident that the purpose of these Iesuites is but to cast in matter of griefe to the godly, when they see so bolde enterprises of the enemie, not at the walles of the citie, but euen in the market place: and, as by a blasing starre, to prognosticate some further matter to the Papist and time seruer: but most of all to disturbe the peace of the Church, and to make the people stagger in religion, as many of them, as by diligent hearing of the worde haue not attained to the certeine loue of the trueth.
Neuerthelesse, although thinke it inconuenient in a settled estate, to haue the trueth of God, and her Maiesties most godly proceedings called into disputation by these men, who are her alienated subiectes, and in this maner against a singular peace: yet vpon other circumstances, as disputations haue bene heretofore graunted, so they may agayne.
For not wee, but the Papistes refuse lawfull disputation: not we, but they feele and confesse that they get nothing thereby.
The inconueniencie is that, which note in the seditious practise of this man, and his confederates.
Otherwise the common wealth hath more cause then ye Church to dreade their forces.
Wee seeke not to esche we any snare they can laye: we feare not their euidence, or doubt of our owne title.
They haue had and may haue the libertie of their pen: if these Iesuites haue any thing that their masters had not, or which our fathers in the Gospell haue not answered, let the~ lay it downe in writing wt true forme of argument, (which is the most certeine tryall, of greatest iudgeme~t) in writing, by the grace of God, they shalbe answered.
For howe litle we feare them, howe much they feare vs, it appeareth by that they suffer not a scroule of religion, or tending neuer so litle that way, in any ma~s hand, but it is presently a matter for the inquisition.
Wheras we find yt the very view of their outward Rome with her abominations, and the inward seeing into yt heart of popish religion, with her absurdities, haue made many, as well grosse Papists, as others indifferent betwene both religions, to stand resolued in the trueth, and to acquaint themselues with the cleare and comfortable doctrine of Iesus Christ, after the execrable superstitions of the Pope once throughly knowen.
But nowe to come to his letters, finde (to speake generally) that they haue a preface to nine articles: the preface and articles being to the same purpose.
For all is in effect thus much: that he hath taken a farre dangerous iourney, boldly plainely to offer himself a procter to mainteine against al commers in disputation, at the commandement of the Pope, the Popish religion, to confute the doctrine of Christ Iesus.
The promise is to persuade euen Prince people professing the trueth, that they are in error: as if both Prince and people had not sufficient assurance of their faith: or the chiefest Papistes did not from day to day receiue great ouerthrowes both in disputatio~ and writing.
For (to the glory of God in the ministerie of the Gospell be it remembred, and to the heart griefe of al Romish Catholiques) the Lord addeth to the true Catholique Church of his elect, great numbers continually: to those that openly professe the religion, many notable cities, which lately were first in the zeale of Poperie, and are nowe not the last of them that embrace the trueth: notwithstanding so many artes and insolencies vsed to stoppe the course and increase of the Gospell.
Therefore, if the Lord do not punish our contempt of the word we professe, what hope may our Chalenger haue, that the Pope shall recouer others, when he can not keepe his own, no not them that lately carried the canopie ouer his head? In the preface, ye Iesuite reporteth his pilgrimage out of Germany and Boeme into Engla~d his deare cou~try, at the co~ma~deme~t of his superiours yt sent him, where he giueth a note of his danger of his obedience.
But touching his obedience, it commeth to be noted afterward.
As for his da~gers, see them not so great as he prete~deth.
For dout not but he was wel contented that this place fell to his lot: that he wayted a time to aduenture himselfe, when there was, in his opinion, lesse danger then heretofore, more hope of some golden daye.
But the man is come into this noble realme for the glorie of God and the benefite of soules.
What glory of God ca~ come by a man sworne to Antichrist against Gods glory: sworne to the Councill of Trent against the peace of this kingdom? What care of soules can hee haue, which would withdraw their foode, in enraged, therfore would enrage others with ye cup of poison wherwith the whore of Babylo~ hath heretofore poysoned the princes of ye earth? What benefite of soules can poore soules looke for at his hand, that in place of the most cleare light of the Gospel, would bring in a greater plague of darkenes, then that of Egypt? This is the effect of the Iesuites loue which he would shew to his deare cou~try after so many yeeres absence out of her sight.
Being now arriued, he keepeth his person secret, that he may vnderhand safely sowe matter of heresie sedition: but by letters he maketh his purpose knowen with cunning speaches.
Why he keepeth himselfe secret so long as he may, one reason is to auoide, that hee would seeme to make none accompt of: namely a iust punishment of his contempts against ye law.
Another reason is (as sayd) to make way for the Pope priuately, because he dareth not effect his message ope~ly.
That he deliuereth his minde in writing, not as a priuate letter in one copie, but as a publique matter in many copies all abroade, it is to entertaine sliding mindes with vaine hope: to cast some disgrace vpon the causes of religion, all by a promise of that which all the Iesuites in the worlde can not performe, though this Cha~pion alone doth vndertake it.
Such vndertakers are like ynough to ouertake some simple ones, not yet cleansed from the dregges of Properie: otherwise it will be hard to preuayle with men of vnderstanding, who euer suspect them of bankrupting, that aske so much credit of their owne word wtout any sureties.
Thus it appeareth that this Iesuites promises, crauing credite to be beleeued in so great things, is but to withdrawe many of her Maiesties subiectes from the loue of the Gospel, whereby they are taught to their owne saluation: and consequently from regard of them selues, from obedience to her Maiesties most noble and godly proceedings.
Yet as if he did not minde this matter, he doth insinuate his own danger for weldoing: as if it were like, that, notwithstanding his close dealing, as much to keepe himselfe as he may, this busie world might finde him out sooner or later, and interrupt a busie felow, this watchful world would finde him out for all his watchfulnes.
But would this suspicious worlde would more suspect them that come to vs in sheeps clothing, being inwardly rauening wolues.
It is to small purpose that he layeth downe the confession of the matter without presentment of the man.
For if the ma~ were founde, there is matter ynough against him without his confession.
Yet he would be accounted a good dealer, and to saue his examiners from some labour when he shall haply be founde and brought to examination.
Neuerthelesse if in these letters al be not plainely confessed, that may iustly be implyed, then he hath not eased his examiners from the practise of their wit in finding out more daungerous practises concealed, then are those, which are here expressed to cloke the rest.
It followeth to speake of his articles layd downe directly, truly, resolutely to ope~ his purpose.
In the first hee confesseth his calling, That, albeit vnworthy, hee is a priest of the Romish church, which he doth falsly honour with the name of the Catholique Church.
Such as ye Church is, such is his priesthood also: the Church Antichristian, the priests thereof ministers of Antichrist, taking vpon them against the manifest worde of God to offer vp a sacrifice for the quicke dead.
An intolerable blasphemie against the all sufficient sacrifice of the Lord Iesus, offring him selfe once for all for euer.
But, to iudge an euill seruant by his owne mouth, hee that is vnworthy of so foule a priesthood, what shal he be worthy of? Not by the great mercie, but by the iust iudgement of God worthy of that that is worse: worthy of a place among the newe and detestable Iesuites.
In this place, because these scorpio~s, ye Iesuites are vnknowe~ amo~g vs in England, haue occasio~ to speake of the~, yt ye godly may take heed of their leauen, that their louers may iustly be ashamed of such loue.
The Iesuites are a kinde of Regulars professing obedie~ce to ye Pope their General, at whose se~ding they must forsooth of free cost preach, wheresoeuer they be sent.
They had an obscure co~ceptio~ about fiue forty yeres past, not long after ye restoring of the Gospel, one Layolas a Spaniard being the father of the~.
But they had not their ful creation co~mission, till within these thirtie yeres by Pope Paulus quartus.
Before that time al Friers professed the rule of some one Frier, as the Fra~ciscans the rule of Francis, the Dominicans, ye rule of Dominic, or some one such like Patro~.
Afterward when euill colors bewrayed the~ selues at a good light, the preaching of ye Gospel brought popish orders into open iudgement, then many papists were ashamed, yt there was not an order after an honest name, whereupo~ some boldly adue~tured to borow ye holy name of Iesus, called the~selues the societie of Iesus, or Iesuites.
Nowe it was not so vile a thing before, to name the~selues by some base beggerly frier, but it was afterwarde more hautie pride, whe~ they presumed to abuse ye name proper to Iesus, at which name all the knees of all things in heaue~ earth must bow down the~selues.
This mighty glorious name, these Iesuites bring in, to giue credite to their weake shamefull order, reckening ye Lord Iesus himself amo~g Friers, withal making him but a Patrone of the yongest co~pany of Friers, so to stand behind Francis Dominick.
These new Iesuites must be called ye societie of Iesus, as if they alone were in the societie of Iesus, all other vtterly excluded: whereas rather these Iesuites are excluded for their heresies, they onely included in the felowship and body of Iesus Christ, which folow his doctrine, and haue ye anointing of his Spirite, contenting them selues with the name of Christians, made to them expresly lawfull and honorable by the word of God.
Wherefore these that corruptly haue called themselues Iesuites, may be called Iebusites, without offence to the Lord Iesus, most aptly in respect of their dealings.
As their name, so chalenged to themselues, is absurd, seruing them only to make a shew of holinesse, and to deceiue the poore people: so their practises are yet more detestable.
For they gather learning onely, as the spider gathereth poyson, that they may infect the heart stomake of their disciples.
And as good Physicians prepare a countrepoyson to saue life, so these in a contrarie course prouide not a countre venim, but venim it selfe against the wholsome meate, euen against the worde of God, the foode of our soules, whereby they are nourished preserued into life euerlasting.
These Monkish Friers, or Frierly Monkes (O heauy iudgement of God) these Iebusites say, from whose contagio~ we haue bene free euer hitherto, they haue lately adue~tured into England, as skoutes to the Irish rebels, and prepare to establish againe popish superstitions.
But let vs yet further examine these Iesuites, that plague all nations where they come, as the Frogges and Caterpillers of Egypt did.
Our bastard Papists in Engla~d, that are neither true to vs, nor faithfull to their owne side, woulde seeme ashamed of many grosse points in Poperie, saying, they verely hold Images, Pardons, Praying to Saints, seruice in an vnknowen tongue, as wicked things.
But let the~ all true professors also know, that ye Papists hold Steuen Gardiners rule: Yelde but in haly water (said he to Cardinall Poole that blusshed at some enormities in popery) and yeeld in all.
Thereupon Papistes yeeld in nothing, howsoeuer our home Papists thinke or dissemble the matter.
This is proued by the open dealing of the Iesuites: for there is nothing, be it neuer so impious, neuer so absurde, yea though in their owne conscience neuer so contrary to trueth commo~ sense, but they defend it in a booke written wt publike consent, called, ye Censure of Colen.
Hitherto it hath bin truely declared, yt ye Iesuites are wicked Monkish Friers, yt they labour for learning to abolish learning, that they ouerlay the nations where they come, that they defend all absurdities of the popish Church.
But for proofe of their absurd and blasphemous doctrines, out of a treatise co~cerning this matter, haue enterlaced their owne words, as they are to be fou~d in ye same book, in other of their writings, adioining to euery article of their doctrine, ye cleane co~trary doctrine out of ye word of God, as foloweth.
It is not sinne whatsoeuer is against the Lawe of God.
Co~cupiscence remaining in the regenerate, although it be against the lawe of God, yet it is not sinne properly in it self, or of it owne nature.
say vnto you, yt whosoeuer shal see a woma~ to lust after her, he hath already committed adulterie with her in his heart.
The first motions of lust are without hurt of sinne.
The holy Scripture is a doctrine vnperfect, maymed, lame, not conteining all things necessarie to faith saluation.
Al ye Scripture is giuen by inspiration of God, is profitable to teache, to confute, to correct to instruct in iustice, that the man of God may bee perfect, and throughly instructed to euery good worke.
The want of the holy Scriptures must be supplied by peecing it out with traditions.
Thou shalt not adde to the wordes which speake to thee, neither shalt thou take from them.
Contrary to the wordes of Dauid, The law of the Lord is perfect, conuerting the soule.
The reading of the holy Scripture is not onely not profitable, but many wayes very hurtfull to the Church.
Ye erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor parte of Christendome, or heathenesse, vpon lyke assignation, doubt not (as sayde before) but that hee was more readie and ioyous to bee sent into his owne countrey.
But what authoritie hath the Pope to send out swarmes of Iesuites into all the worlde? Are they not content falsely to make him Peters successor and head of the Church, but that they will also allowe him to apoynt these newe Apostles, to goe out into al ye worlde, namely these Iesuites, enemies to the doctrine of the true Apostles: yea, and that in nu~ber not so fewe (I thinke) as xii. hundred for xii. because he would haue more to pull downe, then Christ sent abroad to build vp withall? His assigned charge is laide downe in the third article, which is, of free cost to preach the Gospell, and minister the sacraments.
For he speaketh in words fit for the Gospel, to auoyd the vsuall and proper speaches of his Popish priesthod and order, that are full of derogation agaynst the trueth.
For they preach not the Gospell, but against the Gospell, in the traditions and ordinances of the Pope.
Their ministerie of the Sacramentes is the saying or singing Masse, and corrupt baptisme, with other actions which they call Sacraments, but are none by any warrant out of the word of God.
For in their definitions of these other fiue falsly named Sacraments, they surcharge their margents with great shewe of proofes, but almost all are authorities of men: there are very fewe places of scripture quoted, and those manifestly peruerted.
The wordes that folowe in his charge, To instruct the simple, reforme sinners, confute errors, and in briefe to crye an alarme spirituall against foule, vice and proude ignorance, howe great shewe doe they make in the monster.
Tullie noteth those byers and sellers that gayne but litle, except they lie much.
Euen so these marchants that bye and sell with the woman that sitteth vpon many waters, in whose forehead this name is branded, mysterie: Great Babylon, the mother of whoredomes and abominations of the earth: they gayne nothing but by their shamelesse lyes.
For that which they set out to sale for instruction, is destruction touching the fayth: their reformation is a deformation: and in their kingdome it may seeme waste labour, seeing they haue a shorter way to woorke, in blotting that out spel.
He hath taken vpon him a speciall kinde of warfare vnder the banner of obedience.
If it be of obedience to God vnder Christes banner, it is common to all Christians: if it be of obedience to some new false Apostleship of the Popes creation, it is as much disobedience to God, as it is obedience to those monkish ordinances.
What plaine dealing then can this be? Vnder the title of the glorious banner of obedience, the Iesuite recommendeth to the Lordes of the Counsell his disobedience to God, his disobedience to the trueth, and obedience onely to his Fathers, chiefely ye Pope, the most blasphemous enemie of God, most open enemie to her Maiestie both in his consistorie, in the field.
Obedience acceptable to God is according to his word, not according to ye traditions ordina~ces of ma~.
As for ye Pope, he holdeth vp a ba~ner of rebellio~ alwaies against ye kingdo~ of Iesus Christ: many times also against ye kingdome of Princes.
Vnder this banner he hath lately placed these Iesuites wt some armour, finding all other vnlettered and idle Monkes Friers, not so fit for ye campe, as for the cloister.
If this votarie hath resigned great interest, or manye possibilities of welth, honor felicity, (as he prete~deth) the~ the iudgeme~t of God was ye heauier against him, yt he should sell all he had, not to bye the precious pearle reco~me~ded by Christ, but to purchase the marke of the beast deliuered by Antichrist.
For yt was not the way to make a friend of vnrighteous Mammon, but so to forsake ye blessings of this life, that thereby he forsooke also ye blessings of the life to come: except the serpent obteine mercie, cast his skin.
Neuerthelesse this vngodly losse is alledged as a great gaine to his euill cause.
The second third article are one in effect: for the seco~d in substa~ce doth only out of order make mentio~ of the place where he is to exercise his charge, before the charge be expressed.
To folow him his order, in this article he mentioneth his returne into England, as for great good: but passeth by his departure thence with silence, as carying a plaine note of much euil.
He taketh his voyage from Prage to Rome, and thence into England being commanded by a warrant from heauen and an oracle of Christ.
But least any should take it, that hee receiued his warrant in a dreame, or hearde a voyce in deede out of heauen, he expoundeth him self, yet with wordes doubtfull, as oracles among the Gentiles were wont to speake.
For whether hee vnderstande the generall Prouost of the Iesuites onely, or whether hee vnderstande the Pope him selfe, it is somewhat doubtfull.
If he meant not the generall Prouost of the Iesuites, (which rather thinke) then hee auoyded the name of Pope, as iustly odious euery where for his abominable superstitions, pride, and tyrannie ouer mens liues and consciences: but in England most of all, for that he hath againe and againe throwen out his thunderbolts of curse both against the Prince, and agaynst the people.
Wherin, by the way, let vs looke to the effect of those curses.
Did not ye Lord turne them into blessings? Did it not appeare euen to the Papists howe vnderserued the curses were, and howe litle the blasphemously supposed omnipotencie of the Pope can doe? Was not Salomons Prouerbe iustified in those Bulles? As a byrde wandreth, and a swallowe flyeth away, so doeth a curse that is vnderserued.
But to returne to ye doubtful speach, whether he meant the Pope, or the Iesuites master, what blasphemie is it to attribute ye authoritie of a warrant from heauen, and the voyce of Christ, to a man whose breath is in his nostrelles, and whose sinnes reach vp to heauen, calling for vengeance? Doe we now perswade and preach men? or rather, as the Apostle saith, Ought not euen the Apostles themselues to preach Christ Iesus ye Lorde, and them selues seruantes? Saint Paul woulde not preach otherwise then the Gospel, no not at the voyce of an Angell from heauen: and these come to preach Antichristianitie at the voyce of the man of sinne.
Therefore, how are all men, especially they whom the Lorde hath exalted to his place of iustice, howe are they to take diligent heede of these men, and of the matter they bring, much more dangerous the~ the former buls? If the Popes worde be to them a warrant from heauen, and an oracle of Christ, then at his word they must inuade kingdomes, throwe downe estates, change gouernementes, roote out the Gospell, and plant ignorance, with all other their beggerly and wicked superstitions that acco~panie the Popish doctrine.
It foloweth that the Pope is alwayes resiant at Rome: but ye Iesuite must remember that hee may remooue his chaire to Sibyllas denne, or any other place by the doctrine of the Iesuites.
As for his readie mynde to haue gone ioyously into anie the power of God.
That the righteous ma~ liueth by saith, he hath it not in Christ, but by his owne workes.
If righteousnesse bee of workes, it is no more grace.
Men doe surely hope that euerlasting life shalbe giuen them, but they do not beleeue it: now hope often faileth, otherwise it were no hope.
The Scripture in deede neuer teacheth the inuocation of Saints, yet we must beleeue, receiue hold it Fol.
Thou art our Father, and Abraham knewe vs not: and Israel was ignorant of vs. Christ neuer said to the lay men, Do this, in the reme~brance of mee.
Traditio~s are of equal authoritie with the worde of God: we must beleeue them, thogh they be manifestly against the scripture.
Co~trary to this saith Christ, In vaine do me~ worship me, teaching doctrines that are but the traditions of men.
We must worship the image of Christ with like honour that wee doe the holy bookes of the Gospel.
What agreement is there betweene the Church of God and Idoles? These and many other blasphemies doe the Iesuites maintaine.
There is not a spider, nor a spiders web in any corner of the Popes brest, but these Doctors will hold it no lesse holy, then that which commeth out of Christes brest.
But doe not euen the Papists that know these things, easely see, how the Iesuites in these doctrines bewray the spirit of Antichrist, that went out into all the world to deceiue and destroy? Surely none can see, except the holye Ghost open their heart: none can depart out of Sodom, except the Lorde doe drawe them.
Although haue bene long in this matter, yet for a further discouery, and for plaine warrant that the sect of Iesuites is most wretched, at the ende of my answere haue added a tra~slation of a booke, wherein ye sect is notably discouered by a testimonie out of their own heart.
Nowe to returne to Campions wordes: He hath bene a Iesuite these viii. yeeres.
long time to see so many enormities, in al ye space not to returne from them to the with a short pardon, which cannot be rooted out but by much preaching.
Their confutation of errors is in deede a confutation of the trueth, and a confirmation of lies, as appeareth nowe more then the lyght of the Sunne at noone.
For as the Apostle speaketh of them, They shall preuayle no longer: their madnesse is made euident to all men, as the inchantment of Iannes and Iambres.
As these withstoode Moses: so the Iesuites resist Iesus Christ, the lyght of the Gospel, men full of ambition in their corrupt mindes, and enemies to the Crosse of Christ.
That he thinketh his poore countreymen abused with proude ignorance, maruell what hee meaneth to blame ignorance in any.
For we that professe the Gospell, lament and crye out against ignorance: our aduersaries they alwayes haue made much of it, as the mother of deuotion: yea euen the most famous order of the Franciscan Fryers, that extol Francis their Father, and their order aboue the heauen of heauens, they haue a rule that the vnlettered among them shoulde not care to learne letters.
It is the very same knowledge which ye serpent performed: who promised the knowledge of euill, to take away the knowledge of good: who promised life, and brought in death.
Therein also the cause appeareth: for this master promiseth to roote out proude ignorance, minding in deede to roote out the fyncere knowledge of the Gospell, which is the power of God to saluation.
Here the Iesuite most wickedly calleth the knowledge of the Gospel, ignorance: and the stedfast confession of our faith hope that wauereth not, he termeth pride.
But Poperie, which this rooter out of the Gospell woulde plant in place thereof, is in deede proude ignorance, and a treading vnder foote of ye blood of Christ.
For it proudly refuseth to heare, and reioyceth to bee without vnderstanding.
Therefore Poperie is that proud ignorance that must not reenter, and the disease therof remaining in many, is that which must be more more rooted out.
For, though it promise all good things, what one good thing can that religio~ bring, which ioyneth the merittes of man with the merittes of Christ, which matcheth, or ouermatcheth the worde of God with traditions, the commandement of God with the countermaund of the Pope, the Temple of God with Idoles? Which doctrines and many other are the doctrines of men, as contrary to ye holy worde of God, as is darknes to light, infidelitie to faith in Christ Iesus.
What, say, can the Iesuites religion bring, but some vnblessed blessings of a ma~, which draw after them the euerlasting curses of God? The sunne of righteousnes, that shineth into our hearts, being thus taken awaye, this Iesuite would bring vs to some knowledge of the woman that is arayed with purple scarlet, ouerlaid wt gold, precious stones, and pearle.
Which woman is set out vnto the carnall eye, sense, by such allurements to recouer ye kings of ye earth her old louers, that she may make the~ drunken againe with her cup of fornications.
Therefore in the bowels of Iesus beseech all my deare countrey men not to be deceiued by this Iesuite, who bringeth into Engla~d a worship cleane contrary to the worship of God.
For Gods worship is in Spirit and trueth: and poperie is in gold and siluer pearle, and crucifixes, and Agnus deis, all for the eye, and to snare the heart of a carnall man, bewitching it with so great glistering of the painted harlot.
It is also in all kynde of musike to fyll the eare with delight, and in all excellent perfumes to please the smell.
These and all the rest are carnall intisements, to quenche the Spirite, bewraying that Poperie worketh in vs, not a feeling or iudgement of Gods seruice in Spirite, but of fleshly pleasures, to cary vs away to the fornications of that strumpet of all the worlde.
Nowe as Popery is not a worship of God in Spirit, so is it not ioyned with any worship of God in trueth, but in ye canons decrees of men, who, to rayse vp their owne kingdome, goe about to throw down both the kingdome of men, and (which is their chiefest practise) the kingdome of Iesus Christ.
Therefore it was too broade to charge the Gospel nowe preached, as an abusing of his poore countreymen: whereas he himselfe seeth wherewith they are many of them abused from Rome, and by these close messengers from thence: namely with most foolish and beggerly trashe, as Bulles, pardons, holie graines, copper pieces of Agnus dei, with such other childish inuentions, wherein (if a strong spirit of error did not reigne in some) maruell that the beggerlinesse and follie of their religion is not more espied and had in a perpetuall detestation.
The fourth article doeth shew as much trueth in his words, as is in his religio~.
For in wordes hee doeth openly deny that which is most apparant in his doinges, and most necessary for his cause.
He neuer had mind, and was streightly forbidden by his father that sent him, to deale in any respect with any matters of state, &c. Here he doeth earnestly affirme that which must not be beleeued: here he doeth perswadingly craue that which must not at al be giue~ him.
He would be thought no enemie of the state, no dealer with the common wealth or policie: rendreth a reason, (if you wil beleue him,) It apperteineth not to his vocation: and from it he doeth gladly estrange, and sequester his thoughtes.
But all these wordes are as if a man woulde manifestly wounde his neighbour to the heart, and yet in the deede doing cry out, saying, doe not so much as thinke him any harme.
For he that smiteth our religion, woundeth our common wealth: because our blessed estate of policie standeth in defence of religion, and our most blessed religion laboureth in the mayntenance of the common wealth.
Religion and policie in Englande are, through Gods singular blessings, preserued together in life, as with one spirite: hee that doeth take awaye the life of the one, doeth procure the death of the other.
Neyther can any Iesuite from Prage or Rome, come ouer to confute and alter religion, but hee must attempt the change of the state, to the lamentable destruction of the lande.
Hee can not agayne bring in the Pope, but he must take awaye from her royall Maiestie, her iust supreme soueraintie, and depriue her at one clappe of the authoritie shee hath ouer all persons and ordinances.
She must haue nothing to doe with the bodie or goods of the Clergie (as they speake:) shee must seeke a reconciliation from the Popes curse: her chiefe lawes must bee no lawes: the present gouernement, that may not saye the present gouerner, must bee changed, a newe established, and made subiect to the checke of the Priest of Rome.
Notwithstanding this man that woulde ouerthrowe all, woulde make vs beleeue his purpose is to touche nothing.
Because he caryeth no sworde, he woulde hee thought to cary no weapon.
But is not one trumpet worse then many swordes? What manifest dissimulation is then in the champions wordes? what playne contrarietie? But it is no new thing: for his whole pamphlet is full of such monsterous contrarietie, while hee deliuereth humilitie in shewe, but pryde in deede: agayne, while he vttereth the words of swelling pryde, hauing no matter but vile and base.
But Antichrist and his ministers must needes learne of their father his chiefest lesson, which is to lye, that the saying of Christ may appeare, Satan is a lyer, and the father of lyes.
As for his reason, that thinges of policie appertayne not to his vocation: although it bee true in deede, yet it is so sayde onely to couer his purpose, which is to the contrary.
For appertayneth it to Saunders in Irelande by the same oracle, and doeth it not appertayne to Campion in England? Surely it doeth apperteyne asmuch but the open attempt is not so safe.
Therefore it commeth here to bee considered, that the oracle hath a double heart and a double tongue, set at large to denye or breake euen an othe made to one, not of his sect, and euermore to say and vnsaye, to promise, and breake promise, as may make most for his deuilish practises.
Now foloweth ye execution of his message, wherein he asketh with shewe of great humilitie, the thing that bewrayeth his singular page duplicate] page duplicate] pride.
For he aloue professeth with a chalenge in all knowledge, touching his causes, to encounter with all sortes of learning, and learned men: and against them, notwithstanding their strength, and the strength of their cause, to prooue the most weake and languishing title of Popish religion.
And before whom? Not before some fewe in a corner, but in the light presence of this renowmed estate, so enriched with singular giftes of learning, experience and iudgement: namely in the presence of her honorable Counsell, before the Doctours, Masters, and choyse men of both the Vniuersities: and thirdly before the lawyers spirituall (as he speaketh) and temporall.
In this place the Iesuite a man professing so great knowledge knoweth not himselfe, he remembreth not in this article, what he solemnly protested in the former.
For there he affirmed that he minded not, that he might not in any respect deale with matters of state: but now as hauing his will altered and a secrete dispensatio~ against the charge of his fathers, he wil discourse of religio~ so far as it toucheth the co~mo~ wealth their nobilities.
But out of the abunda~ce of the heart, doth the mouth speaketh, the pen writeth.
It foloweth, wherof he maketh most account, to try the matter out with the doctors, masters of ech vniuersity.
What he bringeth from a newe forge, may more easely gesse, then determine.
But if it be no more, then his masters of these all other vniuersities haue brought already into their bookes disputations, it is nothing yt long agoe hath not bene confuted.
It may be, not hauing better reasons, he presumeth of him selfe that he hath fayrer colours then they had, and a stronger spirite of illusion to deceiue and cary away ye preiudicate inconstant hearer against reason.
The manifolde waies he promiseth to co~uince by, are profes inuincible, scriptures, &c.
If he can prooue his cause by inuincible scriptures, it is sufficient: there neede no further proofes.
But if he alledge ye scriptures for his cause, as satan did, as heretikes doe, vsing some of the words, leauing the fulnes of the sentence, or peruerting ye words to another sense then the holy Ghost deliuereth, then shall he preuaile as Satan did, and his reward shalbe among the false prophetes.
As for Councils, Fathers, and stories, they are rather witnesse one to another of some contrarietie, and all witnesses of ye time, howe corruptions crept into the Church, then authentical iudges in causes of religion.
Neuerthelesse we haue (if we woulde vse the~) in their true allegation, matter sufficient to confute yt which the Iesuite hopeth to confirme by false allegation.
Touching places in the fathers to the contrary, some of the~ are alredy condemned of bastardie, being places manifestly forged: other not gyltie of forgery, howe great so euer the authors of the~ were, yet it is euident they were but men: that the word of God alone hath credit of for it selfe: that ye word of God alone is ye touchstone, fining pot yt sheweth ye least corruption, the least co~mixture of corruption: much more the palpable errors of ye new Iesuites.
Moreouer for the latter Councils, because ye Pope reigned ouer the~, he, being now arraigned, is no lawfull witnesse in his owne case.
And because these Councils make warre against the authoritie of Gods word, ye Spirit of ye Lordes mouth, which is his word, shal proceed more and more to consume them.
Afterwarde the Iesuite, not so carefull to performe, as to moue great expectation by promise, draweth me~ to looke for profes of his religio~, where profes are no more to be founde, then a sure foundatio~ vpon the sande, or a place of light in the kingdome of darkenes.
For among other proofes, he vndertaketh to auow ye faith of the Catholike Church, by naturall and morall reason, which are two great enemies of true religion, two great nourses of Atheisme and heresie.
The Apostle teacheth this, that the naturall man can not discerne the thinges of God, they seeme foolishnes to him.
Dauid finding the rebellion and ignorance of a naturall heart, craued a cleane heart to bee created within him, and a newe spirit: newe, not onely in affections, but in vnderstanding, that hee myght learne the iudgementes of God.
For want of this heart, Salomon was a stranger from God a long time, notwithstanding he had a natural and morall wisdome aboue any that euer reigned in Ierusalem.
Peter coulde not receiue the reuelation of fayth from flesh and blood: but this Iesuite can deliuer it from thence.
Therefore the religion which Iesuites woulde plant againe in England, is not according to ye holy Scriptures giue~ by inspiration of God, but according to the carnall sense of vntaught men, which must haue gods to goe before them that is, they must haue a religion allowing gods, images, worshippings in ye feeling and wisdome of a naturall man, that can not looke with the eyes of fayth vp into heauen: nor with spirituall iudgement into ye great mysterie of godlinesse conteined in the holy scriptures.
Last of all this chalenger, as one brought vp in ye Innes of court, at Padua in the middest of spiritual lawyers, vndertaketh to iustifie his said faith by commo~ wisdome of law, standing yet in force practised.
Wherein againe he promiseth to paye out that, which he neuer receiued in.
But if he hath borowed somewhat out of the lawes to saue his credit, let vs examine howe farre it may go for paiment.
Among other lawes he relieth most vpon the Canon lawe, and some such fragments thereof as yet he thinketh to stand in some force.
To speake therfore of the Canon law, many matters therein are so grosse, that euen many Papistes, which otherwise haue a harlots forehead, ca~ not read them without blushing.
Neuerthelesse, out of a sea of such absurdities, there is a booke extant, yt hath gathered many notable places to proue aboue thirtie poyntes of our religion.
This was the iust iudgement of God against the Popes, that they setting downe wicked canons, shoulde not remember to take away ye good.
Nowe for so much of that law as is in practise, if it be not pure, let not the worlde maruaile, if in purging the Church from so many abominations wherewith the aduersaries had in all places and so long time together defiled it, some small matter remained not swept away and caried out with the rest.
As for the positiue lawes of the lande, wherein also the Iesuite woulde seeme to haue knowledge and matter for maintenance of his popish superstitions, they make wonderfully against him.
speake not this onely in respect of the most godly lawes made of late vnder King Henrie the eyght, her Maiesties father of noble fame, or since vnder the Josias of these ages King Edward the sixt, and in the most blessed and prosperous raigne of her Maiestie: but lawes made in the time of Edwarde the first, Richard the thirde, and some others before and after.
For euen these haue made auncient lawes (as appeareth by a booke written onely of this argument aboue fourtie yeeres since) to abandon the Popes authoritie: which head of the Popish Church being taken away, the body can not remaine but as a dead carkeis, that must haue present buriall: or remaine as one of ye antique images of Rome, that hauing lost the head, yet is highly esteemed onely for antiquitie.
In the sixt article first he sheweth how litle power he hath ouer his tongue, or ouer his pen.
For being loth to speake any thing that might but sounde of an insolent brag or chalenge, yet hee doeth most insolently bragge more then any, and chalenge more then all.
For what one man hath made such a bragge, or such a chalenge, as out of al sciences against al men to mainteyne that that for want of maintenance is fallen, as ye Angel prophecied of ye fall, saying, Great Babylon is fallen, the inhabitants friendes thereof see her dayly fall, and there is neyther violence nor subtiltie that can lift her vp againe.
But the Iesuite moueth pitie, rendereth a reason why he may not boast.
In deede as yet he can neither be founde aliue, nor dead, nor the place of his buriall.
Whatsoeuer other may thinke, hee thinketh not himselfe spiritually dead: but dead by resignation of a worldly life, or danger of death that may come by iustice of lawe.
Whatsoeuer it is, he woulde be pitied, before he commeth neere any danger.
As he moueth pitie, so he beggeth loue for the wonderfull loue ready minde he would seeme to beare towarde euery man.
He offreth hayle master, as Judas did, a kisse downe to the ground.
But we must not beleeue words of loue from an enemie yt sheweth malice in deede.
For to treade afterward proudly vpon our heads, to make vs kisse ye Popes feete, he wil in the Popes seruice first laye his head vnder our feete, kisse the ground we tread vpon.
false shew of gracious lowlines! seruile wordes of flatterie, ioyned with intolerable pride of a deceitfull heart! For to whome is not ye notorious pride, hideous crueltie of Antichrist knowen? It foloweth to see how soone suddenly a double minded man sheweth him selfe inconstant in all his wayes.
He that in one line abaseth him selfe to the dust, in the next exalteth him selfe against heauen.
He nowe pretending the defence of the maiestie of Christ, and yet intending to defend ye tyranny of Antichrist, doeth display his courage, his affiance, his assurance, his euidence, so impregnable, that no ma~ may encountre with him.
As before he promised to crye a false Alarme againe sinne, so nowe in presumption of himselfe he soundeth the victory, and proclaimeth a triumph, and that before he hath shewed his face in the field.
If those wordes did no more tickle the Papists that beleeue all and receiue al from Rome, then they doe vs, who examine spirites by the worde, he might haue reserued them for a fitter time, and a better place.
In a good cause, it is good alwaies to be bolde, to haue singular affiance in the gratious fauour of Iesus Christ.
On the other side in an euil cause to trust to a broken reede of Egypt, is a double folly, bringeth a double mischiefe: first an ouerthrow in the attempt, and afterward the shame of an euill matter.
Moreouer, for an enemie of the kingdome of Christ to call Christ his King, and to borowe his name to iustifie a foule enterprise, it is nothing else, but to sinne the sinne of them that sweare, The Lord liueth, and yet deceyue.
For therein the offender maketh the Lord of hostes a witnesse, a reuenger of his impietie.
In the wordes folowing (if his heart varyed not fro~ his pen) he maketh account to haue very fauorable readers, that will beleeue so great matters in so slender a man.
For, as one sayde of another matter, It is easier to commit murther then to defende it, so is it easier to fal into the error of Poperie, then to mainteyne it.
Neuerthelesse this chalenger doeth so vndertake the maintena~ce, as if nothing could be replyed against him.
And not contenting himselfe to say, The Protestants cannot answere, he doeth in spitefull wordes of disgrace ease his stomacke of much gall against the preachers and against their pulpits: against the hearers, and their vnlearned eares.
His impressions of malice are so strong, and the opinion conceiued of his owne sufficiencie so great, that he vaunteth, saying, know perfectly that no one Protestant, nor all the Protestants liuing can mainteine their doctrine.
They haue mainteined it by the word of might and trueth against all the aduersaries in writing and solemne disputation, as hath bin noted.
And can they not now mainteine it against one man, but of eight or nine yeeres standing in his profession, as litle in deede, as he is great in his owne conceipt? Yes, ye meanest of many by ye grace of God can mainteyne it, and shall preuayle.
And if our aduersaries wyll looke into our defences already published, they shall see the defence of our religion so great, and the cause so manifest, that may truely vse these wordes against the chalenger on the otherside, No one Iesuite, nor all the Iesuites liuing shall be able to answere that that is written, or to roote out that which is planted.
We face not men downe in our pulpits (which is his foule reproch against our holy exercise of preaching) but wee labour by the powerfull worde of God to bring all men to the knowledge and obedience of the trueth.
As for our kingdome of Grammarians, againe vnderstande not his taunt.
Wee prayse God for the knowledge of many tongues by many Grammers: and for the knowledge of Grammer, that leadeth into further vnderstanding: and these gifts wee vse to the glory of God, and the confutation of your religion.
If his taunt was to note, that we want other good artes, haue onely some swaye in Grammer, herein also he is gyltie of a false and spitefull accusation.
For we can make proofe that the Lorde hath giuen vs of the spoiles of Egypt, of Arabia, of Iewry, and of Rome.
But it may be he noteth it, that many nowe rule in the Church, that in times past haue ruled onely in Grammer schooles.
graunt that some fewe such are amongst vs: but such profitable and sufficient teachers of men, that it were pitie, they shoulde any more teache children.
Nowe let vs passe from his scoffes, and come againe to his vaunts.
The Campmaster hauing with Rabshaketh denied the arme of our God to be able to deliuer vs, and condemning our cause before it bee indited, doeth notwithstanding craue the combat with all and euery one of vs, offering the best welcome to him that commeth best furnished.
The prouerbe maketh it a vayne fight to fight with a shadowe: but wee haue not so much as his shadowe for a measure of the Champion, or for an argument that hee is at hande.
But as already he hath vaunted of the vniuersalitie of his knowledge, so nowe he setteth out the vniuersalitie of his powers, making him selfe a monster that hath infinite persons to stand it out, infinite eares to heare, and infinite tongues to answere all and euery Protestant.
Can hee speake wisely in a sudde~ disputatio~, that vttereth folly in a premeditate and weightie letter? will he looke to win, that knoweth not how to make his match? The last point of ye article is his protestatio~ of ioy to meete with no vnarmed enemie: but the better we come furnished, the better welcome.
We haue nowe heard more then ynough of his selfe liking: more the~ needed of his chale~ge, wherin hitherto we finde nothing hard, but yt which he doeth not brag of: namely where to finde him.
For some will beare me witnesse, it is harder to finde him, then to answere him when hee is founde.
But these wordes are deliuered to draw credit to himselfe and his cause: also to cast discredit vpo~ vs, and our religion: Wherein he doeth still affirme the conclusion that shoulde be prooued.
It is not ynough for a Iesuite, or for the oracle of the Iesuites to affirme, except proofes appeare.
But we must tarry till the Champion come to the listes.
In the seuenth article he speaketh good words true, touching the singular graces of God, wherewith he hath enriched her Maiestie in noble giftes of nature, learning princely education.
It is very wel if you thinke thus duetifully in your heartes, and speake so reuerently of her Maiesty abroad, and in your secret prayers.
But why do you passe ouer the grace of graces in her, which deserue perpetuall honor: namely her godly zeale and knowledge, in professing publishing ye glorious Gospel of Iesus Christ, in abandoning your popish superstitions? Why moreouer did you not yeelde to her highnes al tha~ks fro~ the heart, for her exceeding clemencie, by the which many of you liue, yet shew your selues vnworthy of so great mercie? If the giftes of enemies be giftlesse gifts (as the prouerbe noteth) what are the bare words of them that are more disloyall in deede, then they can shewe themselues loyall in wordes? But be it knowen to you, that her Maiestie by her rare giftes which you acknowledge, woulde easily see your flattering hypocrisie, and your grosse presumption of her readinesse to incline, or rather to decline to you: and moreouer readily iudge of your sandy foundatio~, and vntempered morter, if either your letters were worthy the least reading, or your selfe meete for any place in her most honorable prese~ce: Your faire light woulde be dimme in the brightnesse of her wisedome, your good methode would appeare to haue a great maime at her learned consideration, your playne dealing would shew it selfe plaine dallying with Gods causes, if in the singular dexteritie of her iudgement, shee were present at your disputatio~ or sermo~s to giue sentence.
Therefore let mee heere once chalenge and charge ye chalenger, that he did so far breake out into seditious and disloyall speach, as to offer that wrong to her Maiestie wisdom, in suggesting to her subiects, that she can be remoued with a shaken reede, who was not moued in the cause, at the earnest sutes, and threates of mightie Princes.
Wherein as her Maiestie hath receyued a notable prerogatiue of Gods fauour, and hath singular cause to reioyce before him in the peace of conscience, that passeth al vnderstanding: so she hath made proofe to the worlde, that shee is resolued for the happy co~tinuance of that, which hath had so happie and manifold blessings, and promiseth more and more, till we come to the fulnesse thereof for euer.
As for her Maiesties loue to her people, and their most dutifull loue and ioye to her againe, it requireth no Popish Doctor or doctrine to alter it: being already established in the knowledge of the Gospel, which worketh the effectuall bonde of peace and perfection in Prince and people.
Therefore the second poynt of this article is as presu~ptuous as the first.
The first in drawing her Maiesties excellent iudgement and zeale of Gods house into doubt of alteration vpon a disputation or a few sermons: the second in calling her best proceedings into accusation as hurtfull to the Realme.
But it is not the Gospell that hurteth the realme: it is you, ye Papistes, and your religion that hurt it, and would bring it to miserable desolation, to set vp agayne your abomination.
Yea many yeeres since you had done it, but that the Lord, of mercy and iudgement, striueth whether he may shew greater tokens of his gracious fauour to her Maiestie the land, or indignation to you, and your most wicked attemptes, in discouering from time to time so many of your secrete conspiracies and deepe practises: and in meeting so happily with your open rebellions and inuasions.
In the wordes following, the chalenger doeth trippe himselfe, for hauing presently before praysed her Maiestie, nowe correcting himselfe, he doth vtter his griefe agaynst her, that hee and his confederates are oppressed, and finde not equitie at her hande.
Her mighty arme and sword hath not bene so heauie, as the little finger of those that persecute the Church.
Therefore, if mine aduise may be taken in good parte, woulde wish you that are so great oppressers, except ye were oppressed, and namely you Iesuites (who notwithstanding the saluation signified by the name of Iesus, which you take, yet you are the bellowes to kindle and increase the fire of persecution more then any, in all places where you can preuayle) not to complayne of oppression, least it be redoubled vpon you, and yet without breach of equitie.
From presuming of her Maiesties pliablenesse to their side, he returneth to her honorable Counsel in the same maner meaning.
For attributing to them the prayse of nobilitie much wisdome, and drift in cases most important, he notwithsta~ding promiseth himselfe without doubt (as hauing ye disposition of their hearts in his hande) that they also will at last for their own soules, for many thousand soules that depend vpo~ their gouernme~t, discou~tena~ce the religio~, hearken vnto Papistry.
He would not beforehand make this promise, (which is his chiefe purpose) drawe the multitude to expect backsliding in their honors, if he did not highly esteeme his owne basenesse, basely iudge of their excelle~cie.
But how doth this inconstant Iesuite still giue in one line, and take away in another? Haue her Maiesties most honorable Counsell wisdome in cases most importa~t? are they without wisdome in the most importa~t cause of religio~, which more the~ al other causes, importeth them for their owne soules many thousande soules beside? Without this wisdom of God in the Gospell, there is no wisedome in the wisest men of the worlde.
Then the Iesuite withdrawing from their honors this wisdome, he attributeth to them a wisedome which is no wisedome, and so his praises are no praises.
But he findeth, in their wise gouernment feeleth their wisedome to bee according to knowledge, their knowledge ioyned with zeale, according to ye reuealed trueth, which they vnder her Maiestie mainteine to Gods glory, ye cutting off of Popish enterprises to the contrary.
Wherefore ye ages that shal come after, shall witnes for her Maiestie for them, that in singular wisdom, they haue restored mainteined the glorious Gospell of Iesus Christ, blessedly withstoode the flatteries of Iesuites, and the violence of the vnholy fathers army, that would in Engla~d set vp the beast, that must be throwen downe into the nethermost hel, neuer rise againe: whose feareful fall will draw with it the fall of as many as depend vpo~ her, yeeld their seruice to her, notwithstanding her intolerable pride bloody fornications.
Moreouer this Iesuite writeth to their honor without regard of their honors.
For as if they had no eyes to see, nor hearts to consider what may be, and what hath bene said for Popish religion, he wil now open the questions of religion so faithfully, that their honors shall see the substantiall groundes whereon the Popish faith is builded.
Haue all other Iesuites wanted learning? Haue euen this Champions masters wanted strength in the field, and dexteritie in their enterprises? To heale the woundes of the beast, are all other Phisitions, Phisitions of no valew? Thus we see how this Iesuite chargeth the Lordes, as not hauing their eyes yet open to see what religion is, and also noteth the wantes of his masters, that haue not done, that himselfe will vndertake.
But to performe all these promises, he must not alledge the authoritie of his oracle: for the oracle himself may sooner with Atlas beare the weight of the worlde vpon his shoulders, then mainteine so great a quarell, as is the defense of the Romish Church against the Gospel of God: as is the maynteining of the worldly kingdome of the Pope, against the spirituall and mightie kingdome of Iesus Christ.
After these things he returneth to his slaunders against the preachers of the worde, charging them, that they huddle vp, and confounde questions of religion.
But whatsoeuer the Iesuite thus casteth out in malicious false termes, God bath blessed the preachers of the Gospell with worthie gifts, and a pure forme of preaching, agreeable to the puritie of the Gospel which they professe.
So that if our aduersaries, their giftes come to a right examination, it shall appeare to al men, that if Papists haue learning, so we also: if they haue order and methode, so wee also: if they haue giftes to perswade, we much more, vpon more excellent groundes.
And (which is more then all) whereas they preach men, we preache God, whereas they preache error, we preache the trueth, not according to men, but according to the foundation of the holy Prophets and Apostles, Christ Iesus being the head corner stone.
As for Antiquitie, Fathers, Cou~cils, we allowe them as farre as the worde of God doeth not disalowe them.
But if any oracle from heauen, or consent of all the worlde, teache, or perswade any thing, otherwise then we haue receiued in the word, we subscribe to the sentence alreadie pronounced by Saint Paul, and registred in his holy Epistle to the Galathians.
What kinde of new preaching these new Iesuites bring, know not: but if they followe the veine of their forefathers the auncient Friers, then know that they wil draw byase, whether they huddle or no.
The worlde is yet full of volumes, wherein their sermons are penned downe, but with matter so ridiculous, and Latine so barbarous, that all bookes written to make sport, must giue place to them.
From charging the preachers, he proceedeth to charge ye sway of the time, for preuayling against him and his.
The time is neither shorter, nor longer, better, nor worse in it selfe: therefore in this figuratiue speach, he couertly chargeth the gouerners of the time.
Wherein he againe vttereth his murmuring, repineth that his golden times so often calculated, can yet take no place.
But blessed be the Lord, that hath stretched out his arme, the swaye and stroke whereof preuayleth against all enemies of the kingdome of Iesus Christ: and let not their praises die for euer, whome the Lord hath raysed vp to be his instruments in so glorious a worke.
As for the best blood in your bodies which you woulde spe~d for their honors, which of them require any such sacrifice at your hande? who stand in neede of it? In so euil a cause, as the perswading of error, what can it auaile? If may againe aduise you, keepe it to preserue life: it may be the Lord hath appointed a day for your true repentance, that renouncing your former workes of merite and supererogation, you may receiue ye loue of the trueth, and builde your faith vpon the merites of Christ alone, which shalbe your owne saluation.
And leaue to professe loue, where you practise treason: cease to promise the sheading of your blood willingly, as in a good cause, whereas experience hath lately shewed that you your confederates lost blood in a notorious euill cause.
But that was the mercy of God that watcheth ouer vs still, to take the wicked in their wickednes, which mercie shall watch ouer vs continually, if we auoide the contempt of yt Gospel we professe, and shewe our selues thankefull to his maiestie for so great mercies.
Againe the Iesuite flaunteth in words, vaunteth of his innocent handes lifted vp to heauen euery day euery houre, as for the good of their honours.
To make your hands no fowler then they are, yet those innocent handes haue written no innocent bookes: they haue cast abroade no innocent libels: they helde out no innocent banner of Popish obedience in their actual rebellions heretofore in England, presently in Ireland.
But if those handes may be innocent that haue done these things, and moreouer crucifie the sonne of God againe euerie day in their most blasphemous sacrifice of the Masse: yet when you holde vp those handes in prayer, doubt not, but it is with desire to haue Popish religion restored, to haue the Lords of the Counsell remoued: to haue way made for you to returne fro~ your beggerly estate to the dignities and regencie of the lande.
And why then doe you, that are knowen to make this prayer, and to followe your prayers with practises, notwithstanding make mention of them as a dutiful and holy seruice towarde the Counsell.
If the things ye seeke by prayer otherwise, were good, then the prayer enterprise also may be good: but if ye aske the thinges that are euil, the praier is turned into sinne: and you finde, how true the wordes of Iames are, concerning such praiers and such purposes, you aske, and receiue not.
But howsoeuer you pray or purpose, we in all trueth loue, holde vp both our handes and heartes vnto God for you, that are in darkenes and in the shadowe of death, praying him in his deare sonne Iesus Christ, to cast vpon you the light of his countenance, that you may see finde that righteousnes which S. Paul desired, with the losse of al the other helpes preeminences: namely, not the righteousnes, which was his owne, which is of the lawe, but the righteousnes which is of God through faith.
This is vnfeinedly our publique and priuate praier for you, with continuall supplication, that God woulde make vs all sheepe of the same folde, whereof Iesus Christ alone is the great Pastor.
To come againe to that which followeth in the letter: he addeth the praise of English students beyonde Sea, saying, Their posteritie shal not die.
No more shall the posteritie of Antichrist, til they and their abominations be brought into iudgement.
As for the vertue sufficient knowledge which they gather, would know whether it be vertue or knowledge that cause them in some places to carie letters, to enter into sedicious matters priuilie: in other places to carrie armes against her Maiestie openly.
Other fruite of their abandoning the lande, great studies beyond sea heare of none, a fewe motiues excepted.
In the next wordes you professe better vertue, and more knowledge, if the euil cause were not stil the same.
For in deede it is ye heauenly gift of God in our calling to despise the death of the bodie, for the life of their soules, whom otherwise we cannot in our ministerie bring to saluation.
But your cause tendeth not to the saluation, but to the condemnation of those whom you carie away with your carnall worshippings and false doctrine.
Moreouer it may be, these are but wordes of a vaine bragge, as hitherto appeareth.
For albeit you woulde seeme determined, vpon your league neuer to giue ouer the Lords of the Counsel, but either to winne them to heauen (as if now they were lost to hell) or to die vpon their pikes: yet you that haue taried so long, from so great a worke, tarie yet longer, making no haste to come to so good a match.
These valiant resolute souldiers vnder ye Popes banner of obedience appeare not: euen this Campmaster appeareth not.
But it may be, he hath withdrawen himselfe, to write his letters consolatorie into Ireland, and backe againe to Rome: and among other his large offers, he mindeth to afforde vs this, that we shall haue some time to prepare for so dangerous a combat.
To let this passe, that which followeth, doeth shew his spirit.
For out it must with ful mouth and great sound, he can no longer keepe his own counsel.
It woulde be marked, and taken heede of, not for feare of the matter, but to see the rebellion of the men.
The societie of Iesuites proclaime by their trumpet Master Campio~, make it knowen, that they haue all made a league not to leaue a ma~ of the~selues aliue, free from the honor of Stories Tiburne, or consumption in prison, til they haue ouerreached all the practises of Engla~d.
But the weakenes of their force, taketh nothing fro~ the greatnesse of their malicious and trayterous purpose.
For if their power were as their purpose, see, pray you, what an alteration they would soone worke in this land! Neuerthelesse these Iesuites that minde to leaue no way, that they thinke may establish the beast, whom they worship, yet they vtter this traiterous branch of the vnholy league, as if it were no other thing, the~ by preaching to winne men to saluation.
But haue largely shewed, that it is destruction that they call saluation.
Therefore to conclude these matters, his purpose is with his confederates by al meanes to subdue men to the Popes bondage: and in this piece of seruice to preuayle, or to die vpon any daungers.
great offer for so small gayne: a great danger for so wretched a purpose.
But if the Iesuite report the conclusion of ye league truely, when it is put in execution (which notwithstanding they wil flee more then we ca~ feare) it wil not go so ill with the Church of God in England, as it will go wel with all other Churches.
For if all the Iesuites in the worlde bend their forces towarde England, and come to carie the crosse, that here shalbe layd vpon them, we shalbe ouerlayed with those swarmes of grashoppers, except the Lord prouide a mighty west wind to cast them violently into the Sea: but all other Churches shalbe free from that plague.
But if answereably to our professio~ we remaine ye Israel of God, though Egypt be plagued, yet there shalbe no complaining in the tents of Iacob.
After these bragges in words only, howe readie they are in the planting of Popish religion to die at Tiburne or in any other torments, he sheweth vs that the expence is reckoned, the enterprise is begun.
To gather these matters, First he publisheth a general co~spiracie of al the Iesuites in the world (and they were not alone in the decree) to die vpon our pikes, or to draw vs fro~ religio~.
Seco~darily he forewarneth definitiuely, that this their league, succession multitude, must ouerreach al the practises of England: Thirdly that the acco~pt is made, the enterprise begun.
In respect of any thing these Iesuites, or their adhere~ts can doe, we haue no cause to feare at all, for their rage shal turne to ye praise of God, who wil co~found the~ for his trueth, to get glory to his name.
But in respect of our sinnes, in not bringing forth fruites worthie of the Gospell, we may feare least some of these noysome beasts in their swarmes cast some shadow vpo~ the tree of life.
Touching those last wordes so playnely laying downe their multitude, confederacie, threats and beginnings, leaue any further to examine them: they are for an other examination, as drawing neere the heart of the common wealth, for the purpose and execution thereof.
The last wordes of this article are in sound very plausible (as the rest of his speeches) pretending nothing but trueth in his false cause, nothing but loue in his seditious pamphlet.
Speaking of Popish religion, he sayth it is of God.
So in all his letter he onely affirmeth, referring vs to his credite: whereas men would rather be caried wt reason.
But his reaso~s are to be looked for, whe~ he commeth to answere his chalenge.
Yet to answere him with a reason, Poperie is not of God, for then it could not haue receiued so great ouerthrowes, only by the word of God.
Neither was ye Popish religion planted in blood, neyther is it like (whatsoeuer is layd downe in bragges) that in blood these Iesuites or any other wil restore it.
Otherwise the wordes may haue this true construction: Popish religion was planted in strength, by sheading the blood, abolishing the doctrine of the Martyrs: in like sort they hope to restore it agayne.
By persecutions it preuayled at the first, and by persecutions they looke to preuayle at the last.
But blessed be God that hath shewed ye vanitie of this hope, by shewing in our daies that the blood of his Martyrs, whose godly cause iustifie their godly death, is the seede of the Church.
France, Flanders, and our owne countrey are wonderfull arguments of this, if any man will descend into ye deepe co~sideration of the particulars.
If the Lord hath heretofore made Nebuchadnezzar his seruant to punish Israel, it was not the power of Babel that did it, but the sinnes of Ierusalem.
All such chastisements of the Church redound to the good of the Church, and leaue wrath against those that rise vp against his people, and the blood of his saints that is so precious in his eyes.
In the last place he aggreueth the fault of her Maiesties most honorable priuy Cou~sell, if they will not receyue that which he doeth not offer.
For, although his letters be full of promises and verball offers, yet in trueth and deede, he offreth nothing, no not so much as these letters.
They were scattered abroade before any copie came to their handes: so it appeareth, that as he meant not to stand to the answere of his chalenge, so he meant not so much as to sende the letters of chalenge, whyther he woulde haue them thought to be directed.
Now after all stormes, and other outrageous actes in this tragedie and imaginarie chalenge, the Iesuite hauing charged ye Lords for their part, if they reiect his offer, reward his endeuours and pilgrimage of many thousande miles with rigour: he for his part falleth to a calme conclusion.
Therein he promiseth hauing no more to say) to reco~mende our case and his owne to Almightie God the searcher of hearts, and prayeth that in heauen we may be made friends.
This prayer if he will make from the heart, we also will pray that through their co~uersion God may graunt it in Christ Iesus.
If he wil pray it in loue and trueth, to that praier he shal haue our Amen.
But let euery man that speaketh well, meane accordingly, least the searcher of hearts finde out punish their hypocrisie.
His last wordes somewhat touch the former sore, therefore must not be passed ouer with silence.
In being our remembrancer, that in heaue~ all iniuries shalbe forgotten, he couertly complaineth againe of iniuries.
For what greater iniurie can be done to another, the~ he hath done vnto himself? He hath departed fro~ the faith, left his cou~trey, refused ye protection of a gracious Prince, with many other honours felicities, as he declared in ye first article.
In him therfore, ye co~plaint of iniuries is vniust: but against him, ye complaint, not of iniuries alone, but of seditions, of heresie, of impietie is very iust: so yt he is to take heed hereafter vnto his steps, least, though al iniuries be forgotte~ in heaue~, yet for want of repenta~ce, such iniquities receiue punishment in an other place.
Therefore, briefly to see into al this matter to co~clude, these letters of Ed. Campion ye Iesuite, which were cast abroad wtout a directio~, to comfort the Papists, sweetely to feed them wt hope of a great co~quest against the religion, are fou~d vpon examination to sound a false Alarme, hauing nothing for ye Papists to feede vpon, but vaine hope, or venim to satisfie a hart nourished wt reproches: nothing to trust vnto, but a broken reede, that not yet in hand.
Touching the Protestants the same libel hath nothing, that can either strike the least feare into them, or cast the least discredite vpon them, or their religion.
Notwithstanding against ye Papists, and for the Protestants, especially those in place further to consider it, the pamphlet hath (beside the vanitie) many points discouering as well great mischiefe intended against her Maiesties peaceable and godly gouernement, as against the heauenly and most fruitful preaching of ye Gospel.
Which mischiefe notwithsta~ding the Lord our God hath from time to time, and lately wonderfully disappoynted, that the Papists which will not heare what is taught out of the worde, may see and consider what the Lord preacheth to them in those his notable iudgements: and that we, both Prince people so blessed of God, woulde with new songs praise the Lord, who is euermore good to Israel: the Lord, say, whose mercie and trueth endureth and preuaileth for euer.

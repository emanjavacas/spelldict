Pithy and Pleasante discription of the Abbusions, and Uanities, of the Worlde.
[Figure: IF man through wisedome would himselfe weigh his state: speruse And ponder wisely the abuse that ouerthrowes his fate: And vnnerstande the lothsome cares conteyned in this life, And know the cause of all his woes and motion of such strife.
And marke the tickle tract of time and learne the rewfull rase Of mortall nature which abhorres the skill of mortall case: His perfect sense considring thus perusing these with payne, Should well perceiue and so confesse that euery thing were vayne.
For euery mortall man and thing is like the withering grasse, And all things frustrately by kinde do passe and do repasse.
The heauens by course vpo~ their poles reulue in circle rounde: And charme their dewties to distill the same vpon the grounde: And all things labor in like wise the which it doth contayne, And yet their labor frustrate is and trauels be in vayne.
So like wise Titans ramping race perseuers through the skyes, And through the burning Zones doth course through the Zodiake hies And daily trafficks to the West and turnes to East agayne, And trauels thus for mortals sake yet is it all in vayne.
And siluer Phebus partes the darke and lendeth wholesome light, (And Titan couered) then displayes hirselfe, in pitchy might, And so by kinde and natures craft hir walking doth maintayne: To each mans sight for each mans welth yet is this same as bayne.
The windes disperse their blustring breathes and scatter them about, Erending ayre and elements and euery place throughout, And course from north to south and so from euery part with payne: And yet the same and all things els is frustrate and in vayne.
And hoary Bortas fiercely blowes his colde congeling blast, And ephirus with gentle breath dissolues the sate as fast, And with a bridell holdeth frost and burning doth refrayne: Yet is the same a frustrate toyle and labor spent in vayne.
And in the like recourse by kinde the elements beare sway, The which on fire, on ayre, and earth, and moysture take their stay.
And rule the natures of the man and do dispose his helth By sondry meanes and secreate wayes in working of his welth.
And when as Titan hath drawne vp of euery filthy lake: These purge the same, and euery filth and humor clenly make.
And then in season sendes it downe in pleasant wholsome hewe: And lay the sappe vpon the earth that each thing may renewe.
And so these siluer drops distill the earth for to sustayne: And yet it is but frust rate fonde and most exceeding vayne.
For all such things for mortall vse their trauels do pretende: And therfore all is meare abuse and serues to fruitles ende.
The earth it selfe with all his fruites his profites and his gayne: Is also fonde and mere abuse and most exceading vayne.
The oyles fieldes with plesant hews and greenish coates yclade: Their fertile flowers and sappy plants displayde through natures trade.
And with odiferous vertues yelde their sents to euery brayne: For to reioyce each panting heart and yet the same is vayne.
The holesome blossomes once through spred the fruits do follow faste: And euery tree with plenteous store deliuers vp his taste.
And euery seede doth yelde his proofe and so doth euery grayne: And yet these labors are but fonde and trauels spent in vayne.
The secreat hidden golden gubbes which le in deepe of grounde: By mans deuice are delued vp and wisedome well are founde.
The which he reapeth for his vse and taketh for a gayne And yet the same is meare abuse and most exceeding vayne.
For all things florish for a time and vade agayne in hast, And euery mortall thing by kinde is subiect vnto wast, And as they come they vade away, and as they vade they come: One standes, another doth decay, another filles the roome.
Each thing that hath bene is agayne, and this is also trew, That whatsoeuer is shalbe for nothing can be new, And euery case is throughly stuft with hazarde, losse, and payne: And therfore all is great abuse and euery thing is vayne.
The world is full of drowly dreames, of feares and tickle ioyes, Of bitter baytes, of short delights periixed with annoyes, Of much mishaps or fickle falles of foolish hasty fame, Of endlesse trauell, of despite, of neede, rebuke, and shame, Of sinne, of mischiefe, and of vice, and nought it doth contayne: But mortall is and hath an ende and therfore all is vayne.
And man doth liue and vse his toyle and moyleth sore with care, And still deuiseth with his witte to worke his owne good fare, And seekes with trouble how to get the goodes of worldly gayne: And yet by death forgoeth all which thing is very vayne.
And so the state of euery man is bound for to sustayne, And therfore all is mere abuse ane most exceading vayne.
For each thing mortall stands in neede or els in fickle ioy, Or els in hazard or in feare or els in great annoy, And each thing hath vncertayne state wheron it doth depende: And therfore all is mere abuse and serues to no good ende.
Both high, and low, and rich, and poore, as also great and small, To hazardes, troubles, losse, and woes, they be addicted all, And euery state and each degree is subiect vnto payne: And therfore all is mere abuse and most exceding vayne.
The prince whom most men do repute to liue in happy staye, Is most subdewd to troubles yoke and subiect to decay.
Whose wittes not onely frounses are in drowsy dumpish cares: By waighty charge the which himselfe vppon his shoulders beares.
But also is dismayd by feare of open foes despight, And also of the priuy foe which worketh out of sight.
And is suppressed by the force of fortunes tickle whele Which cannot stande but stackring stil vnstedily doth reele.
And as his case is most aduaunst so most suboewd to call, (Of fortune) which when fortune failes attaynes to greatest fall.
For as his members many be wheron his state doth stay, The greater likewise be the harmes that worke his owne decay.
And thus he lyues in trauell, peyne, in feare and fickle ioy, In doubt and hazarde of his welth but certayne of anoy.
And if it chaunce that fauour do befrende his happy fate, That neuer mischefe do suppresse the glory of his state, Yet notwithstanding such his ioyes his welth and his renowne By death are finished in fine and cleane suppressed downe.
And then of all his glory, nought therof he doth retayne: And therfore such his state is fonde and most exceding vayne.
For though he were of greater welth then Midas miser he, Or power then Alexander great by any meanes could be, And though he could deuise to liue with such an ydle hart That both from tedious workes and thoughts his fancy could depart: And neither trouble nor annoy his diet could disease, But that his humour should receaue the thinges his stomake please.
And weare of purest golde with stones of passing precious kinde, Such costl robes as nere the like no mortall man can finde, And treade as subiect vnderfoote the scepter and the crowne, Of euery nation vnder heauen suppressing all thinges downe, And did an epicurish lyfe with all delightes sustayne: Yet were his state vncertayne stil and most exceading vayne.
Each ruler likewise vnder him which beareth rule and sway, For all his rule is rulde himselfe by ruine and decay, And though with noblenes of birth his state be set alofte, And though his bones is rested wel vpon his pillow softe.
And though with dainty fare his mouth is satisfied with taste, And mirth delites his senses well yet all these things do wast, By sinking sorow which apares his great considering hart, By painfull toyling how to deale and execute his parte, The which as well doth weaken witte as also troubleth brayne: And therfore all his rule is fonde and also very vayne.
For he doth liue in no such state so certayne or so sure, That he in maintenance of ease or welth shall still endure, But all his pleasure still is mixt with pensiuenes and payne: And care and perill of his case which thing is very vayne.
Since therfore thus the lofty states of earthly tedious race, Be so subdued to casualties and yrksome painfull case How much the more is simple sort opprest with further woes, When thraldomes pester and his yoke is bent so much to those Agree therfore with open throte with me for to complayne: And say that all things is abuse and euery thing is vayne.
And marke from hyest to the least and note with busy cure: If thou canst vewe one thing in earth is stable firme and sure: But all things be addict to waste and each thing to decay, And there is nothing in the world but it doth weare away: And yet in life and being be the subiects all to payne: And therfore all is mere abuse and euery thing is vayne.
And in our life no life doth liue so much at certayne ease That it can satisfy the hart or stomake throughly please.
Because that euery life to cares is bounde, and euery state To trauels, hazardes, losse and feares, and yokte to wauering fate.
The noble captayne whose renowne is hautily displayde, Through martial feates which wel deserue no prayse to be delayde: Though y^ in glorious plight he spendes his daxes in happy time, When forsing cause of manly proofe espruddeth not in prime.
Yet after pleasant easy tyde and weather cleane end fayre: When tempestes rage and stormes he rude and misty is the ayre.
His easy state from great delight is turnde to greatest payne, Respect therfore and see of right if each thing be not vayne.
Can pleasure more thy stomake please or gayne thy fancy feede Of earthly store, then get renowne through manly martiall deede? Or is there any thing or things so pleasant to the lyfe Of man as fame? or any case more greuous then in strife? If not beholde and ponder well the captaynes tickle trade, The which to both these fickle things is most a subiect made.
Now lifted vp and much aduaunst through worthy hie renowne, Now by reprofe or great reproch as much suppressed downe, Now at his ease when as his hart is pleased through repast, Now at his pester when with smart he feeles his force to wast, Now in a certayne sure estate deuoyde of euery care: And now in hazarde and in flight abounding all in feare.
Now in suffisance of his store and maintenance of welth, Now thorow drownde in depe dispaire diminishing his health, Now preaching pleasantly to those which gratify his payne: Now dealing rudely with his foes which yelde the like agayne.
Now florishing with semely hew and comely braue and trimme Now mangled, torne, and all disperst in euery part and limme.
Now bearing life when healthful sappe his lusty senses shielde, Now like a beast berest of breath remayning in the fielde.
And now of all his race and course what profite doth remayne, Or of his toyles and labors all what thing doth he retayne? Himselfe is dead, and saith no more and strikes no more his foe, And cannot shew the reason why or cause that he doth so.
And all the substance that his care hath reaped in his dayes, He leaues behinde him to his heire the which as fast decayes.
And all the pleasure that himselfe hath gayned of his fame, Is also dead, and no man knowes where he may seeke the same.
And if perchance through actual deedes he vsed in time past, He after death receaues renowne what is it but a blast.
And yet to him no pleasure is nor profite, nor a gayne: And therfore see how his astate is most exceading vayne.
The veutrous marchant whose degre is maintaynde by his toyle, And doth deuise and labors harde and trafficks euery soyle.
And learneth this, and knoweth that, and yet is still to seeke: What is his trauall but a payne which still doth come to wreke.
Is labor sweetenes, or the toyle that makes the sweaty brayne, May it by right accombted be a profite or a gayne? If not, peruse and ponder well the marchants tickle state: Whose wealth is guided by the frauds of fortunes fickle fate.
With great aboundance of his woes and anguish of his minde: He seekes, and at the last doth get the thinges which he would finde, He doth prouide by good forecast and seekes with earnest payne To purchase credite which wel got he cares for to maintayne.
And learnes to know of euery ware the certayne easyest price: And then doth warily pursue to follow his deuice.
He byeth wisely with his witte and maketh neere accompt Of each expence which followes, then what profite wyll amount.
And then with diligent aduice according to the same: With expedition to the effect his matters he doth frame.
He wayes the thing, the time and place wherto he meanes to sende: And these considred followes more and further doth extende.
He bargaynes with the sayler then in seeking his resorte, How that with diligence his goodes the sayler will transport.
And after some accustomde talke he shortly doth agree, And then agayne peruseth all how euery thing wyll be.
This done he packeth vp his wares and euery thing in haste: But so that still he viewes that nought be framed vnto waste.
And shippeth it with busie cure and looketh to the sayle And taklyngs, seeinge all thinges sure that nought in neede maye fayle, And for his owne and proper vse such thinges hee doth prouide, That nothing needfull is should want, or lacking bee espide.
And then when all thinges finisht bee and eche thinge well assinde, Hee tarrtes for a prosperous tyde, and for a luckye wynde.
The whiche by chaunce, or els in tyme allot vnto his praye, And then with speede and warie witts they hoyse and packe a waye: And then by course the waues aryse and boysterous blastes do blowe, And stormes do rage the shipp aboue and eke the shipp belowe, And beates the hatches, and by force do breake the steaddye maste, And teares the sayles, ouer whelmes the vessell at the laste.
And then the raging rampyng seas, so fearslie do abounde That shipp, and man, and goods, all, are turned to the grounde.
This is the ende of all his toyle, this is his onelie gayne: Consider therfore of the same, And saye that all is vayne.
And if that fortune fauour so this same his rufull case, That it do graunte the selye wretche suche casualties to passe: And after heauie shipp wrackes, brings by chaunges of the ayre His fearfull hart to good reliefe, abandoninge dispayre.
And after longe exspected tyme doth harbour him at laste, Deuoyde of feare in hauen sure which yeldes him more repaste: Yet not withstandinge vewe the ende, of all his toyle and payne, And thou shalt see, and saye that hee and euerie thing is vayne.
By former trauell hee hath paste the pykes and scapte great cares, And vanquished the force of waues, and now deuoyde of feares, He is ariued at the port which well doth please his minde, Where as he doth deuise agayue his profite how to finde.
And there with diligence prouides and wittely prepares By crafty meanes for strangers sight to lay his subtill snares.
And with his care he purgeth cleane the wracke his goodes sustaynde Upon the seas by great mischaunce when he himselfe was paynde.
This done vnlading such his wares by credite he doth get roume or warehouse wher he works the tryall of his feate.
And wisely ordring all such things according to the skill Of marchants secreat knowledge, then he moues his witte and will, By wary vsage and aduise of cunning to allure His marchants, so that at the last he therby doth procure The happy sale of all his goodes according to desire: And then this done he thinks againe how homewarde to retire.
Now know thus far the wretch hath wrought moyld with careful pain And now to rage of cruell seas he yeldes himselfe agayne: And marke the misery of this wherto it doth extende: And thou shalt see the great abuse which serues to fruitles ende.
He did begin his voyage first with trauell feare and doubt: And as he feared euery thing is painfully faulne out: He endeth likewise with the same and yet for all his toyle, He hath least parte of that wherin he vsed thus to moyle.
Suppose of this, iudge of this griefe, and ponder of this payne: How man shall toyle moyle with car and feare, and reape no gayne.
And well perusing thou mayst see that all the world is bent To such vnhappy toyling stat which is as vainly spent: But passe not thus the tickle state of marchants frustrate race.
But thorowly peruse the same considring of his case, That thou mayst fully see and thinke and deeme of all his payne: And therby know and vnderstande his state to be most vayne.
As first with care he did prouide and then did scape annoy: And then agayne did vse his care so now he leaues his ioy: And to the raging seas returnes which troubles stomake sore Because he enters perils where his heart was vext before.
And yet occasion moueth so and cause doth so constrayne, That needes of force vnto the same he must returne agayne: Now note that he as likely is with all his store and goodes For to remayne in deepe of seas inuironde of the floods.
As by good chaunce the wished porte with safety to ariue: Wheras his hart with more of ease may purpose for to thriue.
Yet not with standing though hee haue the full of his desire, So much that fansie may not craue nor stomake more require, And though hee bringe of happie store sufficient to extend: For maintenance of him and his, yet vewe the frustrate end.
He longe hath bin at easles state and at vnquiet staye, For filthy luker, which as draffe or durte doth weare awaye, And hath escaped daungers greate and perrills with much feare And nowe at laste with ioyfull harte he is approched where He hopes to liue at better ease and to receiue reliefe, And yet it turnes to his disease and most vnto his griefe.
For shortly after life departes from this vnhappy man, And he in wrapped in the grounde of gayne or pleasure than: What doth he reape though he with care haue traueled for the same, Which often times when he is deade doth worke his vtter shame: Learne therfore, see, peruse, thinke, iudge then thou shalt wel know, The full effect of marchants case and matter which showe: To day possessing welth and store to morow worne away.
His goodes and riches all are lost he brought vnto decay.
To day estimation great to morow very small: The next day lesser then before the next day leesing all, Sometime abounding in his ioyes and somtyme drownde in care: Somtime in happi luckye state sometime in mornefull fare.
Sometime at ease sometime at payn sometime in quiet place: Sometime at losse sometime at gayn sometime at perilous case.
And thus his state vncertayne is and neuer hath a stay: But as it is adict to ioyes so likewyse to decay.
And he therfore in such his state can nought at all preuayle, But with his state doth rise aloft and fall when it doth fayle.
Agree therfore with open throte with me for to complayne: And say that all things is abuse and euery thing is vayne.
As well the man indewde with welth as vaunsed by renowne: As also he that both by fat is raysde and pressed downe.
And likewise he who by his toyle or trauell doth pursewe, To purchase store or to his lyfe a profite to renewe.
And nowe consider of degree which beares a lower sayle If that the same be not addict as sodainly to fayle.
That by perusing of the same though lowest and the least, Thou mayst discere it for a state though vayne, yet most at rest.
And thinke vpon the man who liues by labor of his handes, With whome no profite nor encrease nor gayne nor comfort standes: Except he get it by the sweate of browes, or earnist payne Of bodyes force which still applyes his liuing to sustayne.
He beats, he breaks, he batters, bowes, he writheth, and he bendes: He digges, he delues, and to his toyle his labor still extendes.
And neuer ceaseth all his life to moyle with all his strength, Till foule deformed tedious age or death aproch at length: And yet a common thing it is for man in youth to plye His payne and labor, and in age in wretchednes do die: Uiewe therfore from the top to to of euery such degree, And wisely ponder of the same and thou shalt plainly see: That in conclusion each and all is bent to care and payne: And yet doth tende to no good ende but frustrate and in vayne.
Of painfull liuers who doth liue (permirt with tickle ioy, And yet in trauell and in losse and diuers much annoy,) More better then the simple man whose race and vitall scope: Doth both depende on wealth woes and feare and fickle hope.
And yet receaues the naturall vse and kindly happy welth, Which doth procede from fertile earth maintayning manly health In winter he adornes the grounde and sowes in meetest time, And after seedes espruddeth forth he purgeth them in pryme.
And all these thinges he gladly doth and with a ioyfull hart, Because that hope his fancy telles he shall receaue his parte.
And then in Somer doth procede from earth his hoped gayne: The which enioyes his doutfull sense and doth relent the payne.
The which his stomake did forbeare with doubtfulnes before: And so by fate and fortune good he heapeth vp his store, And in a season doth procure to him such great encrease: By former labor that at length he doth agree to cease From moyling and determines now to liue in happy rest, But marke how fonde is his estate when he doth iudge it best.
The myser is compelde to leaue by death his pleasures all, And other florish in the same when he hath got the fall.
And this is most a vexing griefe whych worldlings do retayne: And therfore all is meere abuse and euery thing is vayne.
For euery man that liues in earth doth lyue in carpe and care, To reape the wealth of earthly store and hardly to prepare: Such benefites as may suffise the stay of his estate, And doth sustayne misfortunes great by frowning frowarde fate: And yet it is not for himselfe to vse or to enioy: But for another which receaues the same without annoy.
And thus the profite is not his but his is still the payne: And other men do reape the welth which thing is very vayne.
If therfore this thou do peruse and weigh the ample tract Of each estates effect, and thinke how each thing is compact.
And from the highest to the least thou ponder in thy hart, And from the simplest to the best considring euery part: Thou shalt perceaue and vnderstande that each thing earth contaues: Which is to greatest porte is subiect most to paynes.
And euery thing that is the least and beareth least of swa: Is charged least ad least subdewde to ruine and decay.
For still the higher that a thing doth stande, the greater fall It doth attayne, but lower lesse for lowest least of all.
And note that nothing in the world remaynes at better ease: Then the degree which kept alowe no fortune can displease.
For what doth liue in lesse misdout or hath lesse cause of feares Or most occasion of a stay or motion least to teares.
Then that which euer troden downe could neuer ryse a hye, To know what fal should meane, or els of pleasure to discry: The poorest therfore and the lowst estate, and least degree That is, and may be so maintaynde is most from troubles free.
For it by losses is not vext nor cares distempered sore, Because it is refraynde of that which it possest before: Nor trembles not through quaking feares nor is no more opprest But still doth liue at certayne stay and one especiall rest: Nor is not threatned to decay by fortunes frowning cheere Nor death, nor doubt, nor once dispayre for ought then can appere.
Nor seekes not for to scratch with care the heapes of earthly store, But is contented with his owne and doth desire no more: Nor feareth not to be depriued of that he doth possesse, Nor neede not care least any man his substance would oppresse.
Nor doth not craue the wanton sectes of pleasure or delight: But is by abstinence inforst to liue and deale aright.
And therfore such estate doth both himselfe to right subdew: And matters most which duty craues it rightly to infew: And also least is bent to feele though naturally the payne And trauell of the world the which in euery thing is vayne.
And therfore thus amongst the of mortall things abuse: finde the poorest state to tend to best and wisest vse.
And yet the wisest and the best is but a frustrate payne: And therfore all is great abuse and euery thing is vayne.
For what assured ease doth grow vnto the wise man more Then any other? not a whit, but as to them before.
For though his wisedome by forecast may diuers harmes eschew: Yet notwithstanding do his lets as plenteously renew.
What tedious trauell doth he bear his wisedome to attayne: What lothsome dayes doth it import to spende in endles payne.
And yet when amply he hath got the full of his request, What wretch doth liue at his disease and more at his vnrest: For both his wisedome and his skil especially pretende: To vexe himselfe, and thus his toyles is spent to frustrate ende.
It bringeth cause of great complaynts and motion vnto teares: And sobbes sighes, pensiue thoughts and thus the time it weares.
And doth allure vnrestfull tract and lothsomnes of life: And thus doth nosell in the hart such diuers vexing strife.
Can there be more vnease to man when he vneased most Remaynes, then thus in hartes vncase for to be vext and lost? Or is there more a misery that worldlings do retayne Then in the hart or inward partes to ouerflow in payne? If not: suppose of wise mens woes the which ingendred be By wisedome who co~playnes of world the vanities to see.
Be wayling greatly to beholde the fondnes of the same: And workes therof which only tends to foolishnes and shame.
And the presumption of the life and nature of the minde, And disposition of the corps by nature so assignde: And endles trauell it forbeares vnto a fruitles ende: And what dispite and iniury it chiefly doth extende: And the annoyous harmes and hurte the liuing do assayle, And the dispituous cruell foes which in our life preuayle: And the incombrances and stoppes that hinder earthly health, As also the vnhappy lettes that hinder heauenly wealth: And last the mortall ende of man his ruine and decay: How euery mortall thing by right is bounde to weare away.
And the rewardes which after death approch with ioy or payne: Which thing especially doth moue the wise man to complayne.
Thus see how wisedome doth prouoke the minde it doth enioy: To such vnceasing pensiue thoughts which bredes his owne annoy.
And can not stay but thinke vpon his owne vnhappy case, Who happy should esteme himselfe if ended were his rase: And marke note if thou mayst view the wise mans state so free: From payne or death in any poent or so deuoyde to be Of naturall decay but that his state doth fall at last, When all his wisedome wyth himselfe is brought to vtter waste: And then of all his wisedome nought he reapeth for a gayne: And yet in life it doth intende his trauell and his payne.
Thus therfore pondring of the case perusing the effecte: How that the wise mans wisedome seemes his pleasure to detect.
And can not get no rest of all the trauell he doth vse: Me thinkes his wisedome onely tendes himselfe for to abuse.
And therfore feele that the foole doth liue at better ease: And more at rest with quiet state which doth his stomake pease.
And better is with all that nature hath assignde Then is the wise man who complaines of each thing in his minde.
For fooles be voyde of each suspect and nother minde decay Of thynges, nor matters weyght nor thinke of euerie matters staye: And neither ponder of them selues, nor vse their payne to learne Of other matters to discrye or rightlie to discearne, But thinks vppon the present thinge and lets the other passe, And so supposeth of the same, as doth as Oxe, or Asse, Whose in warde partes is neuer vext but when at presente time It hath occasion whereunto, capassitie muste clime.
For so a foole, determines that the whiche doth appertaine, Unto his common uslenance or present ready gayne.
But little weeth the cause or case or seeketh to define: The proofe or of any thing wherto it should encline.
And therfore since that nether care nor anguish do oppresse His heart nor toyle his stomake tear in any such distresse.
And that he liues and doth not moyle in body nor in minde But is at rest: his foolish state is most a ease finde.
What profite more doth there redound vnto the sparers payne: Then to the spender who deuode of cars doth wast his gayne.
Euen as the one by wast full wyll doth begge when all is spent: And so doth purchase to himselfe the wracke of uch intent.
So doth the other passe his life in sparing of the same: The which vnto himselfe for most exceading shame.
Can there be more a greater griefe or terror to the hart, Then for a man to breake his brayn to reape his proper smart? Or is there more a painfull thing for any to forbeare, Then for to labor for the same the which ingenders feare? Or is there more a witnes sharpe against the dreade of minde: Then when a man against himselfe a witnes seekes to finde? No: neither worldly care ne payne ne trauell, ne misdoubtt Ne losse, ne hazarde, which by chaunce may diuersly fall out: Doth so distemper worldly hars in seeking of their gayne: As he witholding of the same which they would fayne retayne.
For after labor long bestowed and trauell much pursewde: And care much vsed yet in ende they be agayne renewde.
And though a man haue liued longe and spent his trauell much: For his reuenewes yet his heart is vexed more by such.
Not onely by the wretched care that seekes it to encrease: And by desire insaciate which therin can not cease.
But also by his owne abuse and by the further shame: Which doth by such abuse amount to his deserued blame.
What misery is this for man to moyle with all his care: To get the ease which may suffise to worke his owne good fare.
And yet when he hath got at large the thing he did desire: It should be cause that more and more his stomake should require.
And yet not onely that, but eke his state for to abase: As also through his owne abuse the same for to deface.
And marke what great vngratefulnes is rendred for the store: Which he doth leaue to the successe of other, though before He vsed his care and payne so much and thou shalt plainly see: How frustrate, fonde, and very vayne his sparing all should be.
For what more better is it sayde of him when he deceast: But since the chorle could not be filde now shall it be my rest.
For he though still vncessantly did seeke for such a stay: Yet when as he possessed it it was his owne decay.
And therfore now the miser gone hath left against his will: The fruites of all his payne to me and it shalbe my fill.
Since therfore thus in this same world the man which doth retayne The full of worldly wealth his state, is so exceading vayne.
What may be sayde of those which liue in needefulnes and want: With whom ne welth ne ease abounds but euery thing is scant? What may it now be thought of him which all hath spent away: And by deserued wilfulnes is falne vnto decay.
No more but briefly to conclude he reapes deserued payne: And therfore all is meere abuse and euery thing is vayne.
For so the world is diuersly tormented with his owne: And all the trauels of the life are sundry wayes yknowne.
Some by their high estate are vext and some for want of wealth: Some by presumption which they vse and some through lacke of health.
Some by their greedy appetite which neuer hath his fill: Some by the worme in mind some by their wanton will.
Some by the losse of their delite some by frequented vse: Some by superfluous pleasures fonde some by their owne abuse.
Some by their fancy, some by feare, some by compelled payne: Some by the tickle ioyes of fate some by their wilfull brayne.
And thus the world is full of griefes which euery man doth beare: Though some in this and some in that their tedious times do weare.
One trauels farre with doubt payne in dangers and annoy: And griefe, and anguish of his minde a profite to enioy· Another in his natiue soyle tormented is as much: And liues in trembling feare and toyle though not in cases such.
For euery thing and each estate though that a little space It may attayne to little ioyes surmounted in his place.
Yet if thou marke, it nere assende so lofty or so ye: But at the last it doth discende and fall as lowe therby.
What man can compasse so to reach the full of worldes delite, But that his case is diuers wayes inclyned to dispite.
Or who can deuise to gayne himselfe to hi renowne: But that occasion may suppresse and ouer whelme it downe.
Or who can comprehende so much experience of his time? But that as long as life doth last he is a slaue to cryme, No man can bridell so the world nor worldlines refrayne: But still the world infecteth all and each thing puts to payne.
And therfore with a lothsome hart forced am to say: That euery thing is vayne, because it comes to vayne decay.
What pleasure more doth he attayne that hath the chiefe of all The pleasurs which the world co~tayns and hath at last a fall? Then he which neuer could discerne what such delites should meane, But is from such abusions kinde by force excluded cleane.
Doth golde adorne the sprite of man or bewtify the minde: Or is there grace by worldly wealth into the soule· assignde? Or is the raging lust restraynde by heapes of earthly store? No, no, but wickednes and crime is therby moued more.
For earthly treasure is the bagge which vices doth maintaine: And vice is that same very thing which maketh all things vayne.
Who therfore gladly would receaue the happy life and time: Must in his mortall race auoyde the motions vnto crime.
Regarding each thing in this vale as haue sayde before: To be but frustrate, vayne, and fonde, no better nor no more.
For mortall trace a passage is vnto another life: Which is not mortall but deuoyde of foolish mortall strife.
And therfore he that willingly would other life attayne: Must seeke for to reforme this life because it is but vayne.

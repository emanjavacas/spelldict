CHARLES by the grace of God King of Fraunce, to all presente or to come greeting.
Oure intente hath alwayes bene and is, after the example of our predecessors, to rule and gouerne our Realme, and to receiue of our subiectes the obeysance to vs due, rather by gentle and louing maner, than by force.
Wherefore our most deare and welbeloued brother the King of Polonia, hauing full vnderstanding of our wil and pleasure, hath (following the commaundement and speciall power that wee haue sente him for that purpose) appointed and deputed certaine of the chiefe personages of our priuie cou~sel being with him, to heare and vnderstande the complaintes, griefes, and supplications of the Maior, shiriffes, Councellers, dwellers and inhabitantes of our Towne of Rochell, Gentlemen and others that are there abyding.
And for as much as it is so, that nowe in the ende our most deare brother the sayd King of Polonia, according to our pleasure good will, hath (by the aduise of our most deare and welbeloued brethren the duke of Alencon and king of Nauarre, and our moste deare and welbeloued Cousins the Prince of Conde, and Prince Dauphin: the Dukes of Longueville, of Guise, Neuers, and of Vzes: the Lords of Montluc, Cou~t of Rhetz, of Biron, of Villequier, of the Chappell Aux Vrsins, of Losses, of Vauguyon, of S.

We let you vnderstande that, considering we can not doe better than to follow the counsell which is giue~ vs by our sayde brethren, Princes and Lordes afore saide, who for the zeale they haue to the honor of God, with the experience they haue in many things, and the affection they beare towardes the well ordering of our affayres, haue more knowledge than any other in those matters, what is meete and necessarie for the profit and commoditie of our Realme.
We by the aduice counsell of the Queene our most honorable Ladie and mother, of our moste deare and welbeloued Cousins the Cardinals of Lorain, and of Guise: of our most deare faithful Chauncellour: of the Lordes of Moruillier of Lanssac, of Limoges: of the presidents, first of Thou, and Seguier, the Lorde of Foix, the president Hannequin, the Lords of Cheuerny, of Ma~de and of Roessi, all Counsellers of our said priuie Councel for the matters and causes beforesaide, and for other good and great co~siderations therunto specially mouing vs) haue saide, declared, decreed and ordeyned, and do say, declare, decree, and ordeine, by this our present Edict, our wyll and pleasure is as followeth.

We ordeine, that the Catholike and Romishe Religion bee set vp againe, and established in all places quarters of this our Realme and countrey vnder our obedience, wher the exercise of the same hath bene left off, and that it may be freely and peasibly exercised without any trouble or let, vpon the paines aforesaid: and that all those whiche during these present warres, haue entred vpon houses, goodes and reuenues belonging to the Churchmen and other catholiques, and such as hold and occupie the same, shall leaue vnto them the full possession and peasible enioying therof, in al freedome and safetie.

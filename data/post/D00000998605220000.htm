london printed for joseph hunscott


fora&smuch as we have been long besieged in this town of drogheda to the disheartning of the english shipping to come into the harbor or to traffick or trade hither which siege we under god have now raised insomuch that we have possessed our selves of the towns and castles of bewley and stameene on both sides of the mouth of the harbour and have burnt mornanton in all which the enemy formerly lay and endeavoured to block up the river and have likewise so beaten the enemy that they have no force within
miles of this town only dundalk is not yet cleered
now for the encouragement

of the english shipping and marchants we have thought fit to signifie thus much and have sent this small ship which we took as a prize and named fraighted by master james penteny and mr george peppard with hides and tallow to inform the marchants and marriners of chester and that they may freely traffick and trade hither and may cast ankor between this harbour and dublin free and without interruption dated at drogheda the

certain overthrowes given to the rebels

at severall times before the of january our people about ntrim had killed of the rebels at least the of february there came
rebels and beleagured the town of antrim three daies the third day they made their assault upon the town the enemies assaulted it in
severall places and were beaten back with the losse of many common souldiers and in the repulse two captains of the rebels were killed and one hurt and many arms taken and none of our side slain only one hurt in the thigh
this last week there came certain news to and from men of good credit that
of sir john clotworthies regiment issued or sallied out

upon
of the rebels slew
common men and some commanders
my lord conaway is safely arrived and sir john clotworthy daily expected who by reason of the scots not arrivall in ireland when he came into scotland was necessitated to go to edenborough to see what might be the impediment and cause of their long stay that so by removing it and taking them along with him he might better advance the service which in their absence and want could not but languish or go on with lesse successe unlesse there had been greater forces of our own nation there

from carrickfergus april


sir

wrote to you from dublin two letters wherein shewed you the estate of this kingdom at large and the misery these rebellious people have run themselves into but now at this place here is no aid come over yet for the scots have lien this month within leagues of this place and in all this time have not had a winde to bring them over and when arrived here some dayes since here was not above men and not arms for a third part of those neither nor yet money to pay them and for my part had as little as the least for brought but one groat hither but since here is ships arrived laden with ammunition and ships laden with corn from london and my lord conway and his troop so now it is somewhat amended but hope very suddenly it will be a great deal better if once our ships come with the scotish forces and some better governours that will curb these scots for here hath been great want of good commanders all this time
but doubt not that if the lord blesse us but that you shall see this a free conquest in a short time therefore could wish that you would sell the house at a venture for if this kingdom be subdued as doubt not but that it will then will here be brave living and a man with one hundred pounds in his purse shall purchase that

here whereupon he may live better than he that hath per annum in england
corn is very reasonable now over it hath been but the next yeer it will be dear hear in regard that there hath been none sown since thee wars and that that was afore sown now will be destroyed
and thus desiring you to remember my duty to my mother shall ever remain

your obedient son postscript starts here

march

dublin

it is credibly reported that sir charles coot will march out of dublin with an army on monday next to cleare the country on the other side of dublin
if we had but men enough to leave in dublin to secure it and were able to march forth with men
think we might go all over ireland for god hath put such terrour and dread in the hearts of our enemies that they are afraid to stand against us for of them will not stand to fight with
our souldiers are all very resolute and couragious and they want nothing but their pay which they have not received these seven weeks last past

sermon of the excedynge great mercy of god made by ye moste famous doctour maister Eras.
Transla+ted out of Latine in to Englisshe at the request of the moste honorable and vertuous lady the lady Margaret Countese of Salisbury.
¶To the most honorable lady the lady Cou~tese of Salisbury Gentian Heruet her humble seruant gretyng.
SEynge and vnderstandynge mooste honourable lady your great mynde and depe affection bothe towarde al maner of lernyng and specially towarde that whiche either exciteth or tea+cheth vertue goodnes and concerneth the way of our saluacion haue translated out of Latin in to englishe a sermon of Erasmus of the mercy of god: the whiche tra~slated for you and dedicate vnto your ladyshyp, thought it shuld be a good dede if for your ladisshyps pleasure it were printed spred abrode: And where as afore lerned me~ only dyd get out both pleasure and great frute in redyng of this boke nowe euery ma~ as wel rude as lerned may haue this sermon of the mercy of god as co~mon vnto him as ye mercy of god it selfe is.
And as touchyng ye co~me~dacion either of the autor or of ye warke, knowe the te~dernes of my wyt moche more sle~der tha~ that can be able to beare the weyght of suche an enterprise, reke~ to be moche better to holde my to~ge vtterly fro~ preysyng tha~ of them to speke to littel, for faute of wyt to minishe their excelle~ce.
Yet nethelesse it semeth expedie~t vnto me, yt by your ladishyp brefly other folke may knowe how noble is the autor of this warke how moche we be bou~de to hym for it.
The autor of the boke is Erasmus Roterodamus whom my preyses can no more ennoble tha~ the son with a candel may be made clerer.
He is the man to whom in lernynge no lyuyng man may hym selfe co~pare: and nat only passeth them that be alyue but also from the most part of olde autors hath beraft ye price and nat onely payne~s and gentyls but also Chrsten doctors.
He is ye ma~ that whan in his fyrst dayes trouth was far hyd in the depe veines of the grounde and more ouer it was prohibited as a thyng being worthy deth yt no man shulde for her enquere, he dyd nat suffre the worlde to be co~founded with suche a marueylous darknes, and either he hath dygged vp many of trouth or at the lest he hath restored vs free libertie to serche her.
He is the ma~ that to Isaac may be compared the whiche dygged vp the goodly spryngyng welles that the Philiste~s distroied and with dyrte donge ouerfylled.
The clere springes of the holy scripture that ye Philistie~s had so troubled so marred and so defiled yt no man coude drynke or haue the true taste of the water they be nowe by his labour and diligence to their olde purenes and clerenes so restored yt no spotte nor erthly fylthe in them remayneth.
And though ye Philistie~s dyd al that they coude to disturbe hym from his holy purpose and yt amo~ge the people by the reason of them he was greatly hated and enuied yet at the last as it chanceth alway vnto them that with a bold stomake in their good dedes do contynue excellent vertue hath ouercome enuy whan fro~ this ma~ there can come out nothing but both it is excedyng {pro}fitable and on euery side all perfect me thynketh yt this litell treatise being in euery poynt as perfect as any other be in profit nat only giueth no place but also greatly passeth: for where afore the warkes that he made were {pro}fitable but specially to one kynde of men his Prouerbes his Newe Testament and many other treatyses onely to lerned men of the boke of ye Instruction of princis ye moste profit redu~deth to princes.
This boke only with the boke called ye knife or wepo~ of a Christe~ hath so far spredde abrode his fruteful branches, that ther is no ma~ but great frute gether he may out of it except he that thynketh that it maketh no matter whether he be dampned or saued.
And as for the knyfe of a Christe~ sowdiour whiche he nameth Enchiridion, it bryngeth a man out of the way of vicis and leadeth hym in the way of vertue and the path of saluation.
This littel treatise of the mercy of god teacheth a man to ascribe nothyng to hym selfe but all to gether to the mercy of god seing that the fre wyl it selfe that we be in+dewed with all is the fre gyfte of almighty god and except it were by him made clerer it shuld be so darke with the rust of the original synne, that ye image of vertue in it shulde neuer be fast printed.
And who so euer beyng entred in to ye kyngdome of god by doth ascribe any thyng to his owne wysedome to his merites, and to his deseruynges and nat aknowlegeth euery where his owne feblenes trusting vpon ye fre grace mercy of almyghty god it is to be drade leest for mercy that is euery where redy for hym that calleth he proue the sore and rigorous iustice of god.
Nowe let vs se whither it be more expedie~t for a mannis saluacio~, either by iustice to be feared from synne, or by mercy to be enticed bothe to loue and to vertue.
Iustyce with her sore thretnynges co~pelleth a ma~ to flee vice and enge~dreth in hym a certayn bo~dly feare that it is an odious thyng vnto hym to co~mit synne nat for ye hate it selfe of sinne, but for feare of punisheme~t.
Mercy co~trary to it putteth before a mannes face the vnspekable loue of god towarde hym, ye whiche so loued him, that he dyd nat spare his onely sonne for his sake the incredible benefites the infinite desire of his saluacion the continuall callyng vpon hym to brynge hym to the euerlastyng blysse.
Of ye other side she sheweth hym as if it were in a glasse the weakenes and feblenes of a man the perilles that he is compassed about with, the calamites, the miseri, ye wretchednes that on euery side do vtterly hym wrappe, and that in so many mischeues, there cometh no succour but fro the mercy of god do nat all these enge~dre in hym a certaine childyshe loue towarde his father that he wyl performe his co~maundeme~tes nat for feare of punishement nor for loue of rewarde, but for bicause it pleaseth his most louyng father? And that he accompted this a very great rewarde to do the thyng that dothe lyke suche a good father.
And where as it is sayd that ye feare of our lorde is the beginnyng of wise+dome though the same feare somwhat co~cerneth the drede of iustice yet reken that it is nat to be taken for that bondly feare yt maketh vs to drede the sore punysheme~tes, but for that that maketh vs to loke about that we do nothyng that shulde displease our most louyng father, orels feare with out loue longeth to a cruel tyrant that careth nat for the peoples hatred, so they feare him and nat to ye most mercifull lorde father of vs all whose loue towarde mankynde neither with minde can be comprehended nor with wordes any thyng expressed.
The whiche seynge that he loueth vs so moche, and that all our helpe and soccour cometh from hym let vs set al our trust and confidence in hym, withdrawyng al our trust and our hope fro~ al mortal thynges from al mortal me~.
Yf we be in nede let vs cal vpo~ him, he is benigne he is liberal he gyueth gladlier than other do take if so we make hym nat a nygarde in askyng of smal thy~ges vnworthy of hym to be gyue~.
If we be in synne let vs cal vpo~ his mercy being sory repenta~t.
Whan so euer a synner is truely repe~tant he forgyueth al maner of synne.
Here amo~ge me~ they yt do forgyue syn haue nat al an egall power: som cases be reserued to ye pope of ye popes him selle power som do put a great dout: but god him selfe is he yt hath rule both in heue~ in erth, there is no dout yt of his autorite power can be made.
If we desyre to come to the euerlastyng felicite eschewe the feareful peynes of hell let vs beseche his mercy to kepe vs fro~ sinne gyue vs stre~gth to his wyll and his and so done let vs put vs al holle to his pleasure mercy let vs nat trust vpo~ certayn vayne prayers the whiche with moche error be spred amo~ge me~, as though they had this vertue power yt who so euer mu~bleth them vp shal eschewe euerlasty~g punysheme~tes.
subtile serpent disceitfull diuel, howe various, howe crafty be thyn imaginacio~s? bicause he seeth yt fro~ our simple stedfaste beleue he can nat bryng vs away he goth about to bring vs in to an odious supersticiousnes and bicause he seeth that that ma~ can nat do amisse yt vpo~ the mercy of god setteth his holle trust he {per}suadeth rude and ignorant foles to set their trust vpon vaine thy~ges, that they shulde set only vpo~ god.
Surely suche he is and he wyll neuer ceasse to let vs fro~ our iourney heue~ward out of whiche place he was ouerthrowe~.
But the mo wiles and subtilties yt he worketh the more grace stre~gth god giueth vs to withstand hym.
But it is tyme most honorable lady to lay by my rude and la~gage, yt ye may here Erasm{us} speke eloque~t+ly and in your owne mothers to~ge very playnly, the whiche so co~mendeth to the herers ye vnmeasurable and infinite mercy of god yt who so euer in his hart fast printeth it, he shal finde out of it a maruelo{us} great frute both to know his owne misery and of god the infinite bou~te yt whiche two thynges be most effectuous to directe vs to the that is Christe Iesus the whiche preserue your and all yours.
¶A sermo~ of the excedyng great mercy of god made by Erasmus Roterodamus.
FOr as moche as pourpose this daye to speake of the greatnes of the mercies of our lorde Bretherne and systerne most welbeloued in Christ without whose helpe ma~s frailte and weakenes can naught do: let vs all to gether with a common prayer beseche the mercy of the co~mon lorde of vs all so to moue the instrument of my tonge and so to stere and kendell your hartes that as we shall departe he~ce through the mercy of our lorde more plentiouslye endewed with heuenly grace: so euery ma~ to his neighbourwarde maye more abundantly vse the warkes of mercy.
Some vse here to grete the virgin denye nat euery where moche honour ought to be gyuen her but verily to our purpose nowe me semeth more if ye folowe me thus goynge before you: Iesus Christe the almyghtye worde of the euerlastynge father that {pro}mysest to be where so euer two or thre were assembled in thy name thou seest howe many in thy name be here gethered.
Uouchesafe therfore accordyng to the {pro}mise to be amonge this companye: that theyr hartes lyghted through grace of the holy goste may vnderstande more fully the greatnesse of thy mercy: wherby we al to gether may with a lustier mynde both yelde to the tha~kes for thy mercy that so ofte hath ben to vs shewed that more desyrouslye in all our necessites we maye calle theron for helpe: and lastely that we humble seruauntes maye the mercy of our lorde that vn vs we haue largely {pro}ued to our power louyngly prosecute on our felowes lyke wyse seruantes.
If that euery ma~ (as the rhetoriciens teache) is right dilige~t and attentiue to here those thynges that he vndersta~deth shuld sharpely touche hym: than there oughte none of you to nodde or slepe in this sermo~ tyme seyng that the saluacio~ of vs all+egally dependeth on the mercy of our lorde: Nor there is none so yonge nor so olde of so lowe or so high byrth so poore nor so riche so bo~de nor so fre, so counnyng nor so rude, so wicked nor so iuste but that he hath often tymes bothe proued the mercy of our lorde and nedeth the mercy of our lorde to all thynges that he rightously goth about.
What matter more fauorable may be treated than that by the mercy of god euerlastynge helth is prepared for al folkes? Of very right therfore i~ this sermon tyme as many as be here present ye shulde nat onely take hede, but also be lusty and gladde to here hit: for who so euer doth loue and fauer hym selfe woll loue and fauer this sermon.
¶Amonge the manyfolde yuels whiche drawe mankynde to euerlastyng da~nacion there be two chiefe and pryncipall myscheues: of whiche they oughte specially to be ware that loue vertue and goodnes and desyre to come to the feloweshyp of euerlasty~g felicite.
They be these, To moche trust on ones owne selfe and Dispeire.
The one cometh of a presumptuous mynde agaynst god that the loue of ones selfe hath blynded: the other is enge~dred one way by pondrynge the great offences an other way by consydrynge the ryghtous iugeme~t of god without of his mercy.
Both these are so pestilent and cursed that many doubt whiche of them is more to be aborred.
For what is greatter madnes or more lamentable than ma~ that is erth ashes whiche what so he is or may do is for hit all bounde to the goodnes of god: to rebelle agaynst hym of whom he was created of whom he was redemed and of whom by so many meanes he is called to the company of euerlastynge lyfe? Is it nat a point of great vnkyndnes to set nought by hym of whom thou haste so many benefites? Is it nat a poynt of great madnes to wyll to rebelle agaynst hym that may distroye with a becke? Is it nat a great poynt of wickednes nat to knowlege thy maker nat to honour thy father nat to loue thy sauiour? Unhappy Lucifer was bold to do this fyrst whiche ascriuyng to hym selfe yt he frely resceiued of lamighty god sayd in his harte: wyl get vp aboue in heue~ wyll exalte my seate aboue ye sterres of god wyll syt vpon the hyll of testimony in the sydes of the Northe wynde wyll clyme vp aboue the height of the cloudes wyll be lyke to almighty god.
But wolde to god yt his vnhappy fall myght at the leest fray mortal creatures from folowynge of his vngracious example if the wycked dede it selfe can nat feare them.
Truely if god spared nat proude presumptuous a~gels but cast them heedlyng downe in to hell and ordeyned them straytly bou~de in cheynes to be kept tyll the daye of dome what deserueth ma~ a sely worme whiche as now were crept out of the erth must shortly returne to erthe agayne is proude presumptuous testy agaynst god? The more lowe and vyle the co~dicion of ma~ is ye more abominable is his presumpcion desiryng to be egal with god.
The ancient poetes feyned There rose a stryfe on a tyme amonge the goddis that constrained Iupiter hym selfe to forsake heuen and in to Egypt and there in an other shap to hyde hym: but a farre more myscheuous dede was yt the gyantes went about which confederated to gether agaynst Iupiter dyd caste hyls vpon hyls yt they myght so co~quere heuen expelle Iupiter thence.
Ye may wel laughe these tales that ye here be nat gospel: but yet erudite olde tyme wolde signifie some what vnder the coueryng of these fables yt lo~geth to the of mortall folks maners.
Salmoneus was heedlyng throwen downe in to helle bicause he cou~trefetted thou~der and lyghtnyng of Iupiter.
Admit it be but a fable: but howe many sely mortal men haue ther ben yt in dede seriously wold haue heuenly honours done to them? Dyd nat god turne Nabugodonosor that wold haue made hym selfe a god in to a brute beast that fro~ a beast he shulde retourne to a humayne shappe.
Great Alexander wolde be take for Iupiters so~ne and suffred hym selfe to be worshypped at his table.
Domitius Ce+sar in all his letters patentes pistils and in his co~munication wolde be called both god and lorde.
Adrian ordeined yt Antinous shuld be worshipped as a god.
Why reherse all this whan it was a solemne thyng amonge the Romayns after their Emperours were de{per}ted this lyfe to make them goddis.
Some of them a lyue had godly honors whiche offred to accept is wicked madnes to vsurpe is desperate blyndnes.
If auctorite of stories be of no great weyght, let vs here what ye apostel Paule to ye Thessalonice~s wrote of Nero truly some interpretate thus: And ye creature of synne sayth he were vncouered ye childe of {per}dicio~ whiche is agay~st is enha~sed aboue al yt is called god that is worshipped so that he sitteth in the te~ple of god shewy~ge him selfe as though he were god.
But {per}auenture it shal seme no maruayle if some yt worshypped for goddes oxen apes dogges and thynges more vile do~me stones wodde wolde haue them selfe taken for goddes as farre more excellent than these thinges to whiche the people dydde godly honors.
In the actis of the apostles Herode knowyng ther was but one god of whose honour no ma~ coude be partener suffred ye people to crye to hym in his sermo~: This is the voyce of god nat of a man: Shortly after he was stryke~ by the angel of god that reuenged that iniury he the myserable god dyed of the lowsye yuell: than whiche no disease is more foule stynkyng peynfull.
wolde to god there were none amo~ge that folowed the wickednes of Lucifer may nat say passe it.
What? Loke ye that shuld open somwhat of secrete co~fessions? What nede it, whan in some countres in the market place in the churches at dyner souper in playenge and sportyng we here al about they forswere them selfe by the most honorable name of god this yt say is a lyght thynge: we here the name of god denyed ye holy name of Christe with many vile wordes blamed: the fore fynger bytte~ god thretned ye tho~me put betwene the formest and myddell fynger, that is done agaynst god fou~tayne of all glory that is wont to be done agaynst an infamous {per}son for riproche and shame.
Be there none amonge Christi+ens if they may be called Christie~s whiche for reches yt they must shortly forgo or foule bodily plesure or for transitory honours forsake their and make a wicked co~posicion with foo Satanas? the fourme of the othe take~, atones they forswere what so euer co~federacio~ was made with Christe and offre to helle part of theyr body as the fyrste frute to ye prince wherof they vowed holly theyr soule? These thynges spyed out we se punyshed dayly by open execution.
What thynge lyke dyd Lucifer? for hym the son of god dyed nat, and yet he was nat so hardy to blaspheme god: he alonly desyred egal honour.
That vnhappy cuntre wherin somtyme were .v. mighty cites nowe is a pestylent and abominable lake for the swete waters of Iordane bearyng yll fauored claye the horrible example wherof shall remaine euer in reme~brance to them that come after had the inhabita~ces vtterly gyuen to ryot and lechery but yet we rede nat that any of them was so wicked that he wolde blaspheme god curse and threten hym: and yet they were all distroyed by rayne myngled with brimstone.
thyng horrible there be~ fou~de amo~ge Christe~ people that dare do that Lucifer durst nat that Gomorra durst nat: whiche also to so many abominable dedes ioyne blasphemynge.
se you most dere bretherne tre~ble at rehersynge of these thynges and no meruayle: my selfe also rehersyng them quyuer shake bothe body and soule.
Neuerthelesse we purpose nat onely in this sermo~ to declare howe great a synne dispeire of for+gyuenes is but also to shewe howe excedy~g great ye mercy of god is whiche to preyse we haue this day entreprised: the whiche also spareth suche folkes and gyueth them space to repent amende.
And {per}auenture we stande in our owne conceyt by cause amonge vs the examples of crimes yt rehersed nowe be seldome seen: but what matter maketh it if the tonge sou~deth no blasphemynge whan of many ye holle lyfe speketh no other thyng but blasphemyng agaynst god? The gloutto~s for god worshyp theyr bealy, who co~tinually by right wro~ge gape to hepe riches to gether whiche by murther, treaso~, poisonyng, encha~ting stalke vp to honors whiche by tyra~ny opresse poore people whiche to haue al thing to their my~de ke~del al the worlde to warre: nor perseueryng in these great iuels haue no shame nor repe~tance but wt a shameles cou~tinance lyke a co~mon woma~ reioyse yea in thynges most mischieffull skornynge mockyng the good lyuers: do nat caytiues by those dedes saye: There is no god goddis behestis ben false ye thretnynges of god be vayne the worde of god is a lye yeldynge the ioyes of heuen to them that mourne here that thyrst and hu~ger Iustice that be meke that suffre {per}secution that for iustice ben with vyle wordes rebuked? What can be more abominable than this blasphemyng? And yet if any thynge can be worse than that whiche is most worse dispeyre is worse than the holle stynkynge multitude of other synnes.
The wicked ma~ seyng me might do what thyng he wold vnpunished he was proude of his prosperite sayd in his harte: There is no god, and there is no knowlege aboue, god careth nat for mortal folkes busynes.
And as he is lesse iniurious agaynst a ma~ yt beleueth nat he is tha~ he that beleueth hym to be cruel or false: So lyke wyse they bene lesse wycked that vtterly say there is no god than they that beleue he is vn+mercifull takyng away that vertue fro~ hym without whiche kynges be nat kynges but tyra~tes.
But who so euer casteth hope of forgyuenes aside rolleth hym selfe downe in to the hurlepyt of dispeyre he doth nat onely beleue yt god is nat almyghty supposyng some syn so horrible yt he can nat forgyue: but also maketh hym a lyer.
He promyseth by the prophet that he wyll incontinent clene forgette all maner synnes assone as the synner be+waylethe Contrary wyse they that folowe Cain say: My synne is greatter than that may deserue forgyuenesse.
What sayste thou wycked wretche? If god ouer come with the greatnesse of thy synne maye nat forgyue the thou pluckest fro~ hym his power almyghtye: if he wyll nat do that he may he is a lyer and false yt wyll nat {per}fourme that he so many tymes promysed by ye prophetes mouthes.
But .iij. speciall thynges be in hym most high power most high wysedome most high goodnes.
And al be it yt power is wont to be ascribed to ye father as his {pro}pre wysedome to the sonne, goodnes to ye holy gost: yet there is none of these thynges but it is egally co~mon to all thre {per}sons.
His highe power he shewed whan he created these marueylous warkes of the worlde only with a becke of whiche there is no part but it is ful of miracle ye the very pysmers and spyders crye out shewynge the great power of theyr maker.
Agayne wha~ he deuyded the wawes of ye red see: Whan he restray+ned the streame of Iordane made the ryuer pas+sable for a fote man: Whan whyle Iosue foughte he made the sonne and moone stynte theyr course: Wha~ with touchyng he healed lepers: wt a word reysed deed men to lyfe he shewed hym selfe lorde of nature.
And whan he with egall wysedome co~serueth and gouerneth those thynges whiche he by his power yt can nat be declared hath made he sheweth hym selfe to be no lesse wise tha~ almighty.
Al be it that his goodnes euery where shineth as that same creatio~ of angels and this worlde was a poynt of high goodnes wha~ he to highe felicite that he hath of him selfe lacketh nothy~g yt might be added yet he made ma~kynde proprely to thentent that there in specially he myghte expresse the greatnes of his goodnes and mercy for in that be halfe god wolde nat alonly be more louynge to vs but also more marueylous.
They marueyle some tyme at a kynges power and myght that hate or haue enuy at hym.
But gentylnes and lyberalite is loued yea of them that haue no nede that is to say throughe consyderation of humayne chance: wher by it may hap any what euer he be to haue nede.
But there is no ma~ nor hath ben nor shalbe but yt he nedeth the mercy of god.
Whan as wytnesseth the olde testament neyther the sterres be clere in ye syght of god and in his angels he fou~de wickednes.
And Paule cryethe to the Romayns: There is no distinction all haue synned and nede the glorie of god that euery mouthe may be stopped and all the worlde be made subiecte to god.
Nowe let is here howe well with hym agreeth ye mystical synger whiche with a lusty spirite exhorteth all good folkes yt they with a spirituall harpe with a sautry of .x. strynges with a newe songe with great shouttynge shulde celebrate the glorye of god sayenge: Our lorde loueth mercy and iuge+ment all the erthe is full of our lordes mercy.
Ones only is made mencion of iugeme~t but mercy is twyse rehersed with this co~mendacion that therof ye erthe is full.
myght boldly adde this stayeng me by the auctorite of Iob and ye apostle: That nat only erthe is full of our lordes mercy but also heuen and helle.
What syngeth the xxxv. psalme: lorde thy mercy is in heuen and thy trouth recheth to the cloudes.
They in helle {per}ceiued the mercy of our lorde whan he brake the gates of darknes broughte out the prisoners in to the heuenly kyngdome.
If one wold consydre the warkes of god whiche after the misticall discussyng of Moyses he made {per}fet in ye fyrst .vi. days he shulde greatly maruayle at his power and ineffable wysedome yea and crye out in the voyce of all the churche: Pleni sunt celi et terra. &c.
Nor he ne coude absteine hym selfe but brast out in the hy~ne of the thre children: Benedicite omnia opera dn~i. &c. Blesse ye al the warkes of our lorde preyse and leape vp for ioy in hym euermore.
What so euer is created in ye heuens what so euer aboue the heue~s what so euer in erthe what so euer vnder the erth what so euer in the water what so euer i~ the ayre sheweth ope~ly with voyce continuall the glory of our lorde.
Cxliiii? Our lorde is piteous and mercifull pacient moche mercifull.
Our lorde is swete to all and his mercifull pitees passen all his warkes.
Ergo some thinge there is more marueylous than to haue made the heue~s with so many bryghte sterres to haue created the erthe with so many kyndes of beastis of trees variablenes of all thynges to haue created so ma+ny co~panyes of angelycall myndes.
Who durst be so bolde to affyrme hit excepte the prophet shewed playnely that the mercyes of our lorde passe the glory of all his other warkes? And yet he shal nat dout it to be true who so euer with a religious curiosite will co~sider howe moche more maruelously he redemed than created man.
Is it nat more wo~derfull god to be made man than the angels to be created of god? Is it nat more marueile that god wrapped in a babis clothes shuld wayle and cry in the cratche or racke tha~ to reigne in ye heue~s yt he made? Here ye a~gels as thyng of greattest wo~der synge glory to god in the mooste high heuenly ma~sions.
They se the lowlyest humilite knowe the most excellent highnes.
All the cou~sayle of redemynge mankynde Christis lyfe Christis teachynge Christis miracles afflictio~, crucifieng, resurrection aperyng ascention the sendyng of the holy goste by a fewe sely poore idiote me~ ennewed the worlde: this cou~sayle say is it nat on euery syde full of miracles yea that the very a~gels cun nat serche out? Wycked spirites se and vndersta~de the reason of the worldis creacion but the counsayle of the worldes restoryng was hyd fro~ them: and in this poynt crafte disceyued crafte the craft of mercy begyled the crafte of malice.
The creatio~ of ye worlde was the warke of puissance ye worlde so restored was ye warke of mercy.
Thendis of the crosse saythe Abacuc in his handes there is his strength hyd.
What is more vyle than the crosse? What is weaker tha~ the crucified? Yet vnder that weakenes excedyng power of diuyne mercy laye hyd that brake ouer came and clene distroyed all the tyra~ny of the dyuell.
The same prophet whan he had eares erudite whan he had eies very clere by faythe he herde the holle frame of ye worlde on euery parte shewe the great myght of god and he was afrayde: he considered his warkes and was amased.
And yet as though in all these thyngis ye great might of god was nat playn inough he added that shulde ouercome all these warkes: In ye myddes of two beastis thou shalt be knowen.
In the meare of the olde newe testame~t he become man opened playnely that most bashefull miracle of his mercy.
Undouted hit is yt the prophet soone after addeth: Whan thou woldest be angry thou shalte reme~bre thy mercy.
Of them that do thynges wonderfull we be wont to say: In those he ouercame al i~ this he ouercame hym selfe.
Of god some thyng lyke may well be sayd: God is incomparable in all his dedes can nat be folowed In mercy he excedeth hym selfe.
Holy scripture extolleth no vertue in god so moche as mercy whiche some tyme calleth it great some tyme ouermoche, and somtyme augmenteth the plentifull abu~da~ce therof by nombre of multitude.
Kyng Dauid the prophet in the same place co~plecteth ye largenesse and multitude of diuyne mercy: Miserere mei de secu~du~. &c. god haue mercy on me after thy great mercy and after ye multitude of thy mercyes do away my wickednes.
Where is great misery there is nede of great mercy.
If ye co~sidre how horrible the synne of Dauid was ye knowe the largenesse of mercy: If ye caste howe many maner wyse he offended in one trespas ye maye se the multitude of his mercies.
An excedyng great offe~ce is neuer commytted alone a faute draweth a faute as one lynke doth an other in a cheyne.
Fyrst he ioyned to+gether two most deedly synnes ma~slaughter and aduoutry: eche of them was more greuous in the kynge: whose office is to punyshe other that so offende.
For the more princis do amys vnpunysshed amonge men the more they offende god.
He bare a to punysshe manslaughter and he hym selfe co~mytted manslaughter.
By hym women ta+ke~ in aduoutri were deliuered to be stoned to deth and he hym selfe compelled to do aduoutry.
He also peculierly augmented the same aduoutry that whan he had flockes of wyues and concubyns at home yet nat for nede but for wa~to~nes he coueted an other ma~s wyfe yt he wolde seme delite rather i~ rauysshyng tha~ in simple fornication.
For he offe~dethe nat so moche that nede co~strayneth to steale somewhat from the riche ma~ as he that hath his house plentifully stouffed taketh his gowne fro~ hym that hath no mo to his backe.
This cruel offe~ce Nathan ye {pro}phet dyd obiect agaynst hym vnder ye parabol of the ryche thefe and poore ma~ robbed.
Nowe no kynde of ma~slaughter is more cruell than that yt is nat by chance or sodayne mouy~g of ye mynde but by a dryft before driuen wayting co~uenient tyme is co~mitted.
Urias had nothyng deserued the kynge knewe hym ryght trusty and he abused the same trustynes of the man to his distructio~.
He wolde in no wise e~tre within his owne house to lye with his wyfe bycause ye arke of god was lyenge in the tentes and Ioab capytayne of the warre with the people slept vpon the grou~de and al that great worthines of the man coude nat turne the kynges mynde from the iuell dede.
The morowe after he had hym to supper made hym dro~ke seky~g occasion to distroy him if he through dronke~nes shuld hap to speke ought vndiscretely. yet Urias bey~g dro~ke wold nat come i~ his house to take his pleasure with his wyfe.
An other gyle was added wherby the stro~ge trusty warriour muste perisshe.
lettre of murther to hym suspectyng no suche thyng was delyuered: for ye kynge knewe his faythfulnes so perfecte that he had no dout he wolde open and rede it.
In the offence of manslaughter he made Ioab the capitayne partner lyke as he had Bersabee of aduoutrye.
And Urias perished nat alone but to couer ye gyle many were broughte in to the same daunger: a great nombre of people was set in the open shot of theyr ennemyes to thende one innoce~t myght be kylde to gyue place to the kynges foule bodily pleasure.
Therfore in one sinne how many are the offences? If hit were one only synne and excedynge great hit nedeth great mercy.
Nowe Dauid seynge his so many folde dyuers he calleth on the multitude of mercies.
But howe largely the mercy of god is opened ye .xxxv. psalme declareth sayenge: good lorde thou shalt saue men and beastis like As thou haste multiplyed thy mercy.
God saueth nat only man but also he vouchesafeth for ma~nes to saue bestis.
Againe i~ an other place how reioyseth the prophettes spirite whan he saythe: wyll syng the mercies of god perpetually.
And therfore in the heuens ye mercy of god is worshipt honoured like as sayth an other psalme: Knowlege your selfe to god bycause he is good bycause his mercy is in al worldes.
The preising of ye mercy of god semed to haue ende after the ende of all wretchednes came except the same felicite yt good folkes haue in heuen were the gyft of mercy and the punishement of the wicked tempered with the great mercy of god.
But what shall we say whan all the lyfe with a thousande syns and all the stynkyng see of vices is corrupted? Truly we must cry with Asaph: lorde reme~bre nat our olde iniquitees but let thy mercy preuent vs quickely for we be made ouer poore.
Againe in an other place: Ma+ny be thy mercyes lorde after thy pleasant speche quicken me.
Agayne in an other place Dauid as he co~playned wt god crieth out: Where be thy olde mercyes good lorde? Agayne in the psalme .Cvj.
Let the mercies of our lorde be co~fessed his maruayles of the sons of men: Whiche verse as enterlyned is oft repeted i~ ye same psalme.
In ye psalme also that goeth nexte before: And he gaue vs vnto his mercies in the syght of all that toke them.
He sayd mercies bicause he had rehersed many wycked dedes with whiche he prouoked the anger of god.
And Dauid on all partis oppressed with yls sayth: It is better that fall in the ha~des of our lorde: for manifold are his merices than in to the handes of men.
As in one offence often times are many sinnes, so lyke wise in one many mer+cies are conteyned.
Ones he redemed mankynd but here in howe manifolde are the mercies? Whi+che Esaias beholdynge with the eie of fayth speketh thus in the persone of god promysynge our sauiour Iesus: And wyll make with you a couenant euerlastyng the faythfull mercies of Dauid.
In a lyke figure god being appeased speketh in the prophet Hieromie: And wyll gyue you mercies and shall haue pite vpon you.
Lyke wyse after many afflictions god hauynge pyte of his people speketh thus in the prophet zacarie: wyll retourne to Hierusalem in mercies and my house shall be buylded.
But why reherse we those thynges out of bokes of the olde testame~t in whiche so ofte tymes the name of mercies is encou~tred? And yet some heretykes beleue that ye same lawe procedeth of a and nat of a good god whan it souneth welnere nothyng elles than the mercies of our lorde.
Howe moche lesse is it to be maruailed if Paule thapostle in the .ii. pistle to the Thessal. accordyng to the prophettis wordes writeth in this wyse: Blessed be god and father of our lorde Iesu Christe father of mercyes lorde of al co~solacio~ whiche co~forteth vs in al our tribu+lacion.
The apostle somwhat addeth to mercy, for it is a poynt of mercy to {per}done offence done: here whiche is moche more god of a reue~ger is made a co~forter.
These thynges we haue repeted of the holy scripture to thentent that we by that fygure of spekyng myght vnderstande the signified excedyng and vnspekeable mercy of god towarde euery body and in all yls.
The same is shewed by an other figure whiche is eyther Anadiplosis, that in latin one may calle Co~duplicatio, orels nerest to Anadiplosis.
For as the Hebrewes call that good good that they reken to be excedyng good and yll yll yt is excedyng yll: so likewise in holy scripture god is ofte called pitefull and mercifull for the excedyng greatnes of his mercy.
Our lorde is pitefull and merciful and as though that also were a small thynge he addeth: Pacient and moche merciful.
Agayne in an other psalme: Our pitefull mercifull lorde hath made reme~bra~ce of his marueiles.
Lykewyse in Iohel, Rente your hartes and nat your clothes for our lorde god is pitefull and mercifull, and sorowynge for malices.
And in the prophet Ieremie: Therfore my bowelles haue ben troubled vpon hym piteynge shall haue mercy on them saythe our lord.
What is piteyng to haue mercy but to haue mercy out of To this poynt {per}teyneth that sythe it is infinite what so euer is in god: yet it that amo~ge men sowneth vnto vice holy writte semeth to ascribe vnto hym certeyne ouer moche and vnmoderate mercy.
wolde your goodnesse shulde so take this sayeng as {per}swaded nothynge to be in god that sowueth to any vice shuld vnderstande that vnder figure the holy scripture it selfe to ma~nes {per}ceyuyng signyfyeth a marueilous an i~credible excesse of diuine mercy.
Whiche thynge yt may more plainly speake ye more {per}fectly {per}ceyue co~sydre this in your mynde.
¶If a kyng shulde stablyshe rigorous lawes on a mankyller after he had ma~slaughter ones wolde {per}done hym may hap it shuld be ascriued to his
But he {per}doned hym yt had done yt mischeuous dede .x. tymes or more wolde nat euery body crie out: The kinges cleme~cy is moche, ouerthroweth ye strength of ye lawes, {pro}uoketh ye lewde {per}sones to do wickedly for lacke of punisheme~t? Also a father that ones or twise for gyueth his son for spendyng his money lewdly away, may hap shalbe called and mylde.
If ye same father often tymes gyue his so~ne money so lewdly wastyng hit wyll nat euery body saye: He is to easy and by his hyndnes marreth his so~ne? And moche more southly hit myght be sayd if he dyd so to his seruant.
More ouer if an husbande shuld take in worth if his wyfe were take~ ones in auoutry, vndouted euery body wolde marueyle to fynde so meke an husbande.
But ye woma~ soone after breke her wedlocke, is take~ i~ auoutry nowe with one nowe with an other if he tha~ toke her to hym agayne wolde nat all the people say he were a starke fole, orels his wiues baude? But god yt is our kynge our father our lorde, our spouse, no kynde of syn, he no no~bre of syn+nyng, as ofte as we ame~de he releaseth our peine: whiche his euerlastynge lawe thretneth he receyueth vs in to his household he leadeth vs i~ to the cha~bre of his charite he nat onely receyueth vs but also forgyueth all our offe~ces.
The shepe that was lost he carieth home on his shulders to ye cote agayne: he stereth the congregation of holy folke to reioyce to gether he mereth the riottous childe returnyng home fro~ far cuntrey he offereth hym a fayre gowne and a rynge he co~mandeth to kylle a goodly calfe.
What thyng els signifieth all this but vnmoderate may so saye) ouermoche mercy of god.
But nowe it semeth lesse marueile if a forgyue a man offe~dyng that also other while doth offe~ce hym selfe likewise or may offe~d, if a kynge {per}done hym yt somtyme dyd hym good profitable seruice: or if the father forgyue his son whose co~uersacio~ he feleth doth ease his olde age: if a mayster forgyue is seruant by whose labour he partly lyueth: if the husba~de forgyue his wyfe taken in auoutrie with whom other while he leadeth his life pleasantly.
Amo~ge men he that some time {per}doneth dredeth hym that he forgiueth and other while can nat aue~ge hym selfe if he wolde.
But god that hath nede of no ma~ that may with a becke distroy vs if he wold so often tymes of vs despised forsake~ denied: suffreth calleth receyueth and enbraseth vs.
As no loue is more ferue~t nor strayter conioynynge than betwene man and wyfe: so lyke wyse no anger is harder to appease than it yt ryseth by breakyng of wedlocke.
And yet here what our mylde lorde saythe by the prophet Esaias to his spouse an defyled with so many auoutries: It is co~monly sayd if a ma~ forsake his wyfe and she departed fro~ hym weddeth an other man shall he retourne to her any more? Shall nat ye woma~ be poluted and defiled? Truly thou co~mittest fornication with many louers and returne to me (saith our lorde) wyl receiue the.
maried ma~ wyl nat take his wyfe agayne whom parauenture he forsoke for a small faute or cause if she after ye deuorce be wedded to an other ma~.
For wedlockis loue can nat ye co~pany of an other man.
But yet god doth nat disdayne his spouse for whom he suffred dethe whiche for him selfe he purified with his bloud so ofte wylfully runneth away and abandoneth her selfe to so many vncleane wyghtis if she wyll returne agayne.
And it is no marueile if he haue ouermoche mercy yt hath ouermoche charite towarde vs. Paule bassheth nat to wryte thus to the Ephesiens: We were by nature the children of anger lyke as the other were but god that is riche in mercy for his ouermoche charite that he loued vs with wha~ we were deed i~ syns, he quickened vs all to gether in Christe.
Iohan in his gospell expresseth more playnly ye ouermoche charite of ye father towarde vs. God sayth he loued so the worlde yt he wolde gyue his onely begotten son, that who so euer bele+ueth in hym shal nat perishe but haue euerlasty~g lyfe with whom Paule agreeth tunably writy~g to Romayns: whiche also spared nat his owne son but delyuered hym for vs all: howe gaue he nat vs all thynges with hym? If this this so great mercy shulde be conferred to all humayn charite mercy to our merites wolde hit nat well seme vnmoderate? But it shall appere moche more veritable if we co~syder what he is that so loueth vs so sheweth his mercy on vs what we be that god vouchesafeth so great honour.
Let eche loke on him selfe after the name in baptisme gyuen after Satanas forsaken with his pompis howe oft he forsaketh the sacrament and yeldeth hym to thennemy of his spouse, howe oft after absolucio~ of his synnis receiued of ye prest he slydeth into more greuous offences ye how oft ye same day he falleth in to them that he aborred? Lette no body most dere bretherne dissemble with hym selfe who so euer stealeth or co~mitteth auoutry who so euer e~uieth or sklandreth his brother who so euer coueteth wordly honors leaueth his spouse Christe turneth away from his father, forsaketh his king, and fleeth away far fro~ his lorde.
But {per}auenture we shall haue a littell after a more conuenient place to speke of these thynges.
Nowe to thende ye may more fully vnderstand howe largely the exceding mercy of god spredeth, ye must vndersta~de yt in holy writte the cleapyng of mercy signifieth somtyme liberalyte somtyme grace preue~tyng somtyme aua~synge other while co~fortyng agayne other where healyng, but very ofte~ forgyuyng orels also punyshynge.
For surely after my mynde that ye our lorde in Luke.
Be mercifull like as your father is mercifull perteyneth specially to liberalite.
For {per}fecte liberalite is if one do good to his e~nemes.
Mattheus saith hit more playnly in a lyke sayeng of our lorde: Be ye (sayth he) {per}fect lyke as your father celestiall is perfect that maketh his son to shyne on good and yll and sendeth rayne to iuste and vniuste.
But bi+cause we haue nothyng that we ne receyued frely of god what euer we maye or be what so euer we possesse it is the mercy of god.
Yea that he created angels and this worlde is the mercy of god.
If he had created hit for hym selfe the power or wisedome myghte be preysed.
Nowe seynge he hath wroughte all these thynges for vs knowe nat we the excedyng great mercy of god? For whom mouen ye celestiall bodies aboue? For whom shyneth the sonne by daye The moone and the sterres by nyght but for ma~? For whose profit were all these thynges wrought wha~ they were nothyng? For whom make the hangyng cloudes shadowe and moyst the feldes? For whom bloweth the wynde? For whom runne the ryuers the welles sprynge the see ebbe and flowe the pondis sta~de stylle? For whom engendreth the ple~tifull erthe so many beastis and bryngeth forthe so moche ryches but for man? For he subdued euery thynge vnto man he wold man shulde onely be subiect to hym: lyke as wytnesseth Paule writyng to the Corinthies.
All thynges be yours but ye be of Christe Christe is of god.
And it that Moises sheweth in Genesis the .viij. psalme repeteth marueylyng at ye goodnes of god that of his mercy hath gyuen to man so many
What is man saythe he that thou remembrest hym or the sonne of man that thou visetest hym? Thou haste made hym lyttell tha~ angels thou hast crowned hym with glo+ry and honour and hast set hym aboue ye warkes of thy handes.
Thou haste subdued all vnder his feet shepe and oxen euerichone yea and more bea+stes of the felde byrdes of the ayre and fyshes of the see.
wyll say yet that is higher: We be bou~d to the mercy of god for the heue~ly angels.
Beleue nat my worde without Paule teache it playnly writyng to the Hebrewes and speking of angels.
Be nat saythe he all spirites seruantes in seruice sent for theyr sake that receyue the inheritance of saluacion? And bothe in ye olde and newe testame~t we ofte~ rede yt by ministracion of angels ye hu~gry were refreshed prisoners cou~tres ouerro~ne ye good folke co~forted with ioyfull tydynges.
More ouer our lorde hym selfe in the gospel sayth: Theyr angels beholde alway the face of ye father, that is in heuen.
What is more marueilous than this worthynes angels gyuen to sely men as gouernours to children? Therfore what so euer thou hast man truely thou hast all thinges while thou remaynest in Christe thou shuldest reken to haue it al of his mercy.
Otherwise Paule wyll stampe crie out vpon the: What hast ma~ that thou hast nat receyued? And if thou haste receyued it why magnifiest thy selfe as yu dyddest nat receyue hit? Farther what yuell so euer thou seest in other aknowlege the mercy of god preue~tyng Wherof Dauid nat in one place sayth: And his mercy shal preue~t me.

He hath diuined truly all this had ben if phylosophie had nat taught me te~pera~ce.
But moche more southly right holy man Francis vnto diuine mercy that Socrates yeldeth to philosophie.
For on a tyme wha~ his felowe of him co~+manded so to do had reuiled hym with what so euer wordes a mischeuous caytiue is wont to be re+buked callynge hym churche robber mankyller backebiter poller poysoner, he toke it most paciently and bewayled him selfe yt he was suche one.
An other tyme whan his felowe asked him why he hym to make so many lies vpon an for none of al these thy~ges were i~ him he an+swered: Thou dost nat lye, for al these had ben yea moche more nere yt ye mercy of god kept his seruant fro~ those synnes.
And ye mercy of god doth nat only preuent prouoke vs to goodnes but also helpeth vs entprisynge acco~panieth vs goyng forth, and in conclusion gyueth vs puissance, yt we may {per}fourme that mannes strengthes coude nat do.
Me semeth the apostle Paule signifieth suche a maner of mercy in many places but specially in gretynges besechyng grace and peace.
And cer+tes without preiudice of a better sentence if any haue it to shewe thynke grace {per}teyneth to callynge of vs for we be called by fayth yt is beleue.
This fayth is the free gyfte of god and therfore they to whom it happeth, are for it bonde to the di+uine mercy.
Mercy {per}teyneth to dyuers gyftes distributed to eche after the measure of his faythe.
Peace longeth to the innoce~cy of all the lyfe with out whiche fre~dship with god can nat he had nor true co~corde with our bretherne.
Ueryly as oft as we be deliuered fro~ iuels that we be greued with we shulde nat repute it to the sterres to Fortune nor to our prude~ce but we ought to ascriue it al to ye mercy of god.
No man tangled in the syn can be deliuered excepte he be holpe by diuine mercy.
For our lorde hath great mercy and in hym is plentyfull redempcion and he wyll redeme Israel fro~ all iniquities
Farther that the mercy of god delyuereth vs also fro~ bodily harmes Paule declareth writyng to the Philippe~ses: Epaphroditus was sicke yea nere deed: but god saythe he pitied hy~ nat only hym but also me lest shuld haue had sorowe vpon sorowe.
Nor there is no differe~ce bitwene mercy helpyneg and co~fortyng saue that we be holpe wha~ ye yuels be take~ away yt greued vs but mercy co~forting is at hande as oft as in ye myddes of afflictions tempereth the grefe of ad+uersite with mynglyng of thy~ges causing frute with te~ptation as Paule sayth wherby we may susteyne hit.
And the same yuels ofte tymes are sente of god wherby we may purge our yl dedes co~mytted orels withdrawe vs that we commytte no mo or to mynistre vs matter to exercise vertue.
In suche wyse Abraha~ was te~pted so Iob was exercised in dyuers troubles so who so euer lyued well in Iesu Christe werein this worlde proued by dyuers as golde is by the fyer.
Where be they that murmure agaynst god, as oft as to them happeth bodily sicke+nes or deth of theyr children or wyfe or as ofte as they haue losse of stouffe or as ofte as theyr felde frutes fayle nat vnderstandynge these to be the most certeyne tokens of god piteyng vs? Let vs rather here what Solomo~ monisheth vs: My sonne caste nat awaye the teachynge of our lorde nor leaue hym nat whan he correcteth the: For hym yt our lorde loueth he correcteth: and deliteth in him as a father in his childe.
Paule to the Hebrewes repeteth this sentence changyng somwhat the wordes.
For whom our lorde loueth he chastiseth: he scourgeth forsothe euery childe that he admytteth.
Therfore mooste welbeloued brethern~ as oft as ye storme of aduersite assaileth you co~tinue in discipline as Paule cou~saileth knoweyng yt god offreth hym vnto you as vnto childre~ here the voyce of the father mercifully correctyng his children in ye psalme. lxxxviij.

And lyke wyse Paule thretneth the chyldren that he loueth sayeng: What wolde ye shal come to you by the rodde or in the spirite of hyndnes and mekenes? But the same Paule saythe: What nedeth me to iuge of them yt be without? No voyce is more bytter and sharpe vnto chyldren than to here theyr father saye: Do what ye wyll care nat.
The iuste man saythe: He shal correct me in his mercy and shal rebuke me but the oyle of the synner shall nat grece my heed.

Howe moche more ought we drede lyuyng wickedly lest the iuste vengeance of god hange ouer vs whan the prosperite of temporall goodes flater vs longe.
For whan god in the prophecies wyll expresse his vnpeasable anger he thretneth to take away his rodde from them and that by af+flictio~s he wyl nat redresse their sinnes.

Paule thapostle thangel of the deuyl to assayle hym and gyue hym blowes for so it was expedie~t to reteyne the gyftes that he had receyued.
And he glorifieth gladly in his infirmi+tes that he myghte possesse the vertue of Christe dwellynge in hym.
What be we that refuse this mercy of god by dyuerse afflictions as hit were with bytter playsters procurynge our helthe? The co~mon people wha~ they se one yt is desce~ded of high linage hauing abu~da~ce of riches, helth of body heaped in honors are wont to say: Howe moche is he bou~de to god? Thus iuge they that esteme felicite in those thing is, yt seen outward.

Many seme rightous amo~ge men before god no man is iuste: but al our iusticis are as it were the clothe of a woma~ defiled with ye menstruous flixe.
Paule {per}ceyueth howe the carnall lawe in his me~bres stryueth agaynst the lawe of the mynde and crieth out: vnhappy creature who shall deliuer me from the body of this dethe: Iob with a iuste mans title honoured is nat fou~de clene fautles by the talkynge of god.

¶Nowe let eche of vs entre in to the chambre of his conscience and consider howe many wayes howe ofte howe greuously he hath offended god yea with what sondry vices al our benefittes are defiled: and so than he shal vndersta~d howe moche he is bounde to the excedynge great mercy of god: that so paciently suffereth our that by so many occasions stereth vs to re+pentance that so swetely forgyueth all our offences whan we leaue our wickednes.

Paule deliuered a fewe to Satanas in affliction of the fleshe that ye soule myght be saued at ye day of dome: and they corrected with shame, shulde turne to better frute.
There is no example more rigorous than of Ananias and Saphiras that by Peters correctio~ fell downe deed sodeynly and yet it is vncerteyn whether theyr soules by dethe of the body are saued.
Finally the punishement that the damned soules of yll lyuers suffre in helle is lesse tha~ theyr meritis.
And there be some yt esteme the mercy of god so great yt they beleue that ye wicked spirites also and da~ned soulis ones after many seasons gone a+bout, shall be receiued to grace.

Nowe if it be shewed sufficiently what euer we be or haue touchy~g that we be defe~ded fro~ iuels depe~dyng that we be delyuered fro~ hurtes oppressyng, that in the myddes of tribulacions refreshed with heuenly comfort, we abyde stronge lusty, that by temporal afflictions we be eyther instructed to repentance or exercised to {per}fect vertue that our syns done be nat to vs imputed whereinto so oft we slide cometh al of the mercy of god: that ye may more clerely perceyue the excedyng heyght breade and depenes therof pray you that with me ye wyl a lytell beholde your selfe inwardly fyrst in yt party through whiche ye be most lothsome after in that wherby ye excelle lastely ye muste regarde the yls that outwarde hange ouer and co~passe you about and agayne to y~e bounties, of whom the hope is to you shewed.
The contemplacion of all these thynges wyll teche vs the largenes of diuine mercy wher of verily is neyther measure nor nombre.
¶If we beholde this small body the pype or litel house of our soule vneth one may fynde any beast more weaker lothsom, ye or more wretched.
If ye enquere ye begynnyng the fyrst of our kynde was of claye.
Nowe let euery ma~ co~sider this howe litell or nothyng is the great po~posenes what euer is of the humor of whose co~ielacio~ the principles of mankynde take begynnyng whan as yet it is hyd in the womans wombe.
Than howe far that humor dista~teth from hipocras and deyntie meates wherwith the childe nat borne is norished.
wyl nat reherse here ye filthines of ma~ky~dis byrth only that ye haue ofte seen, call to mynde.
What is more wretched tha~ ma~kyndis byrth? Howe longe howe perillous be ye panges of women trauaylyng? What miserable wailynges? At last ye child hit selfe crepyng forth soone from wepyng waylyng begynneth the life.
And where as Nature to all other beastis as soone as they come forthe gyueth diuers as coueringis or defenses shels barkes thicke skyns prickes heares bristils quils fethers, scales, flissis, also other while defendeth the stu~pes trees from colde hete with a double barke: only mankinde naked, on ye bare grou~de the day of his byrth she casteth out forth with to wepe and wayle, who wold nat iuge in this point ye a chekyn crept out of the broken shell more hap+py tha~ ma~kinde? Farther se howe he is swadled his mouth totheles, his touge specheles, his eies can nat suffre ye newe lyght and fareth as it wold entre the darknes of the mothers wo~be agayne that he lefte, ye moulde quauereth longe a toke~ amo~ge al beastis of greattest weakenes, brefely all the litel body is weake in whiche is no membre yt doth his dewty.
Most part of all other beastis as soone as they be brought forth, emplie ye gyftes of their nature.
As soone as ye buterflie cometh out of the skyn it fleeth: It is no sure wrastling with a leons whelpe.
As soone as fyshes be spaumed they swymme: Tadpolles rollen them selfe with great swyftnes before they may be called or haue any shap of frogges: onely what other thynge can mankynde do by course of nature but wepe? Howe longe lerneth he to go? Whan he hath lerned to go on
feet howe longe must he lerne to speke? ye he can nat fede outcept he be taught.
Adde nowe many kyndes of sickenessis that vneth can be rehersed and specially ye newe that it is harde to heale them howe be it amo~ge the olde many be vncurable.
Som take ma~+kinde soone after the byrth som also in the byrth as lepre fally~g yuel wherby many dye or they be+gyn to lyue.
And this whyle speke nothynge of them that be borne with many defautis of nature mysshapen.
Nowe let eche co~syder this by hym selfe what do~mages he hath suffred i~ youth how fugitiue youth is howe carefull mans state how wretched olde age: and so forth howe short ye holle lyfe though one hap to be olde whiche yet chanceth to very fewe.
Who so euer of you is at ma~nes state let hym reke~ the course of the life past cou~t fro what sickenessis fro~ what great perils he is escaped let him thanke ye mercy of god.
Uerily wolde reken amo~ge bodily yuels as principal the sedes of all maner vicis faste routed in vs howe greatly to a~ger to bodily pleasure to riot to e~uy to a~bicion to couetousnes to robbery fro~ our mothers wombe we be enclined: where all other beastis lyuen lowably in the desyres of What a labour is it to vs all to with these leauynges of olde Ada~? to howe fewe lucky? The soule is ouer loded with the weyght of yt erthy body: and whether it wyll or wyl nat is drowned in these thynges that it aloweth nat.
Farther more co~sydre what rout of yuels vs without and ye shal fynde yt many mo perishe by cha~ce tha~ sickenes.
Howe many be distroyed by lyghtnyng erth quakes grou~de openynges lakes floddes of ye see and ryuers infectous aer venom wyld beastis fallyng of huge thinges, yll phisicio~s: but no way greatter distruction than through warres? But all these myscheues thretten to distroye but the body.
Howe many da~gers hange ouer ye soule? fro ye fleshe a houshold e~nemy fro the worlde nowe flattryng that it may strangle nowe ragyng that it may oppresse fro wicked spirites yt whyle transfigure them selfe lyke angels of lyght.
Who dredeth nat of these ye multitude powers disceit malyce and vnsaciable desyre to distroye? Nowe who amo~ge these yuels wold it nat nere slee deth certayne to eche the day vncertayne the rigorousnes of thextreme dome the peynes of hell euerlastynge? se you tremble at thonly reme~brynge of these so great myscheues and no wronge: but the more ye here of yuels and da~gers the more ye be bou~de to the mercy of god whiche amo~ge al these yls nat onely defe~deth those that trust theron but also turneth all these thynges to vs in occasion of more felicite.
What so euer calamite we haue here we may wyte it the syn of olde Adam: but for the felicite in stede of calamite to vs yelden more ple~tifully we ought to tha~ke the newe Adam that is Christ Iesu of all creatures preysed ye world without ende.
Satanas expelled vs out of Paradyse Christe for therthly paradise opened vs the heue~ly kyngdome.
The serpent droue vs to dyuers sorowes of this life Christ restored vs to ioyes euer+lasting of lyfe i~mortall.
Satanas by his gyle got vs bodily deth Christ by his mercy rewarded vs lyfe etnal to whom who so euer with a pure harte yeldeth hym nedeth to drede no kinde of e~nemies.
He ouercame the worlde he vanquished all Satanas tyra~ny he turned ye fleshe in to spirite.
That he ouercame is of his power: yt he ouer came for vs is of his mercy.
Let vs honour his mercifull myght and take fruicion of his myghtyfull mercy.
All thynges we may do by hym that maketh vs mighty if we abide with hym: al thinges we possesse by hy~ i~ whom is al goodnes euery where vs defendyng aydyng co~fortyng encresyng by his mercy lyke as the prophet sayth in ye psalme: Mercy wyll enuiron them that truste in our lorde.
To what great ils are they subiect that put their trust in bodily gyftes in riches in chares in horses in worldly prude~ce in theyr merites dedes? But by what succours is ye iuste man out of care? Truly sayth he trust in ye multitude of thy mer+cy.
And a lytell after: Lorde as with the bucler of thy good wyll hast crowned vs. Whan ye here Of thy good wyll ye vndersta~de ye hope of your owne merites to be excluded.
Where the stre~thes of nature fayle vs where our merites forsake vs: there mercy succoureth vs.
The warriours shyldes but one part of the body the buccler of diuine mercy dothe fensiuely couer vs all aboute aboue agaynst the fyrie dartes of wycked spirites that hange ouer vs fro~ the celestiens: beneth agaynst the of the serpent yt wayteth to attrap vs: afore lest thinges present greue vs: behynde lest thinges past e~uade vs agayne: on the right ha~de lest prosperite make vs insolent: on the lyft hande lest aduersite ouer throwe vs. Trusty~g in this bucler Dauid crieth out: Our lorde is my helper wyll not drede what a man can do to me.
And in a+nother place: wyll nat feare a thousande people co~passyng me about.
But Paule thapostle cryeth out yet more boldly writyng to the Romayns: If god be with vs sayth he shal be agaynst vs? That noble warriour armed hym with al ye harneis of the faith whiche fortifieth vs nat by hope of our warkes but of diuine mercy.
He bey~g bold on this armour, dyd nat only dispise grefe hu~ger, pouerte peril {per}secutio~: but also the tyra~s sword thretning to sle hym by and by.
The humayn cru+elnes may do nothing where the mercy of god is redy at hande to defende: yea this is stronger he dispised beside deth and lyfe a~gels principalites vertues thinges present to come, fortitude, altitude depthe so forth if any other creature were in the heue~s or in erth or in
And this is he, whiche knowing his weakenes calleth hy~ selfe an erthe~ pot.
Fro whens tha~ hath this britell erthe~ pot so moche strength? By the grace of god sayth he, am it that am.
What is the grace of god but ye mercy of god? Let vs gladly glorify with Paule in our infirmites that the vertue of Christe may dwelle in vs: for so it is more expedie~t for vs that by conte~placion of our miseries we maye glorifie the mercies of god.
And yet the meane while if it lyke the beholde thy selfe thou man in that parte that thou excellest the other beastis.
For if thou esteme thy selfe after the goodnes of the body, thou seest thou art lower than many brute beastis the camels in greatnes excede the, in swyftnes the tygers in strength the buls in colour the swannes, in apparayle pecockes in helthines the fyshes ye if we beleue the prouerbe welnere all beastes in quicke syght ye beast lynx egles in smellyng gripis, in lo~ge lyfe hartis and crowes.
And yet if one co~sydre ye gyftes of the humayn body he shal here fy~de wherin he may preyse ye mercy of god.
What sagasite of the .v. wittis what great co~formite of me~bres howe feet instrumentes to dyuers vses? But of those thinges also Lactantius a ma~ of singuler eloque~ce co~piled a boke whiche he nameth De opificio dei.
To rede that boke wyl profit vs moche, if we minde what goodnes is in the body, and as hit all cometh from the mercy of god to be seruant lyke bonde to diuine obeysance.
Other wyse he that wyll glorifie in bodily gyftes shall by by here: All flesshe is hey and all glorie therof is as the flower of hey.
Why arte proude thou dost and asshes? Neyther in gyftes of the soule in whiche parte man is more marueylous he hath oughte that he may chalenge as his owne.
He that made the body formed ye soule ye body he made of slyme and put in the soule with inspiryng of his mouth.
And therfore of the other beastes the soule body perishe to gether ours is alyue after the body she receyue it agayne in the resurrection {pro}mysed.
Nowe howe effectual a thyng the soule is ye very deth declareth, which assone as she de{per}teth, there lyeth the carkes vnprofitable: where is the hete where is the colour where is the mouyng where is the myght of all the wyttes? And yet while the soule is holden fast tied to this so vnhappy sely body doyng nothyng but through the bodily instrume~tes whiche very oft let yt she can nat put forthe her natiue power howe maruelous is ye swiftnes and profounde vnderstandynge of mans mynde.
What is so hyd in ye secretes of nature or i~ ye heue~s or in erthe that mans wyt can nat marke {per}ceiue and discusse? It is a great thyng that many by situacion and mouynge of the sterres shewe what shall fall many yeres to co~me: but it is more that by ye thinges wrought the euerlasty~g power and godheed of the same worker is founde out wytnes is Paule: Howe moche is the swiftnes of ma~s wyt i~ howe short space howe many thinges doth ma~s wyt beholde at ones? But howe might of memory, that truly obserueth ye shaps of so many thinges so many names of thynges co~mytted to her by ye ministracion of the wyttes? wyll speke nothyng here of them yt haue lerned so many sciences so harde to knowe so many la~gages that that they lerned they reteyne styl.
Let him that wyll of you thynke howe many folkes faces names he reme~breth howe many shaps of beastis trees herbes places and of other i~numerable thy~ges he knoweth and memorially cleapeth them by name.
The comon people calle these gyftes of nature wha~ i~ dede they be gyftes of diuine mercye whiche are departed to eche nat after our merites but after his benignite.
Al these thinges bicause ye prodigal child abused to ye pleasure of hu+mayn wyl nat only it is nat withdrawe~ that was gyuen but by grace more abundantly beralite of gyftes is added.
By lawe he instructed vs by his son~e whom holle he gaue to vs he taught vs the secretes of god by his spirite he enriched our soules with dyuers gyftes passyng mannes power.
He gyueth vnderstanding of misticall scriptures that gyue lyght and comfort to vs in all yls, he gy+ueth forknowlege of thynges to come he gyueth tonges to speke sondry langages to co~tempne venom to heale sycknesses to reyse the deed to noyful spirites he gyueth power to ouerco~e hel gates he grau~teth vs to be me~bres of Christ childre~ of god, {per}teners of the kyngdome celestial that neuer shall haue ende.
Here to me wherof thou were made without dout on the one part claye, tha~ howe moche vnder ye co~diction of beastis syn threwe the.
Agayne to what dignite to what felicite thou art called tha~ thou shalt clerely se ye mercies of our lorde haue neyther nu~bre nor measure.
What is more despised tha~ scarbetes? Yet is a scarbet pure i~ co~parison to ye filthines of a sy~ner.
What is hygher than angels? Were hit nat out of al measure to make an angell of a scarbet? Nowe ma~ more abiect than a scarbet he made greatter tha~ angel may boldly say he made hym a god.
For why shulde nat dare boldly say it yt the scrip+ture doth: sayd ye be goddis and excellent chil+dren? What so euer cometh of god is made in a ma+ner god.
What so euer is ioyned to the body spirite of Christe cometh in to the felowshyp and {per}ttakyng of his name.
Here if nothing be that thou to thy merites mayst ascribe glorifie the mercy of god worship the mercy of god enbrace kysse the mercy of god.
If that any go about to claime any part of this to hym selfe Paule thapostle wyll by by crie out agaynst hym yelding all these thynges to the grace of god.
All his pistils sou~de out ye worde of grace: whiche as oft as thou hereste vndersta~de ye mercy of god to ye co~mended.
Of grace it is that we be purged fro~ synne through grace we beleue of grace it is that by his spirite charite is spredde in our hartes wherby we do good warkes.
For we be nat sufficient by our selfe as of our selfe: but al our ablenes cometh fro~ god.
If Paule sayd trouthe where be those shameles felowes yt selle to euery body theyr good warkes as though they had so moche at home that they myghte enryche other? They be miserable that so selle their good dedes cursed they be that trust in me~s warkes.
Who that is greued with the fyrst disease let hym here what the churche Laodice~s hereth in ye Apocalyps.
Thou sayst: am riche and ple~tifull and nede nothyng and knowest nat that thou art a wretche miserable poure blinde naked.
But they also syn more greuously that of thabunda~ce of theyr good warkes promyse other ryches.
But what cou~saileth the holy gost suche folke? counsayle the sayth he to bye firy golde of me proued that thou mayste be ryche in dede.
And thou that knowest thyn owne pouerte why beggest of beggers? S. Iames sayth: If any want wysdome lette him aske it of god, that gyueth to eche abundantly and abraydeth none therof.
Euery good gyft euery {per}fect gyft descendeth fro~ aboue fro~ ye father of lyghtes.
And askest thou of a ma~ ye garment of good warkes whiche is ye more piteously naked the more gayely he rekeneth hym selfe clothed? Aknowlege thy misery and ye mercy of god is redy.
Amo~ge me~ whiche abrayd one a other of a good turne whiche for one pleasure loke to haue many is nohtynge derer bought than it that is bought with prayers: with god nothyng is so as that yt is bought with .ij. litel peces of money prayer hope, for he that wyll sell his mercy, hath gyue~ vs ye same price to pay for it.
¶we haue spoke~ many thinges welbeloued bretherne of ye mercy of god but there is moche more to saye if we shuld repete all thynges of holy scripture whiche preyse co~me~de to vs ye greatnes of diuine merci.
The remena~t is yt wyl exhort you in fewe wordes yt none through presumpcion make hym selfe vnworthy of the mercy of god that is so redy: or through yll corage of my~de despeyre of ye mercy of god.
And after we wyl shortly declare what thyn+ges {pro}uoke the mercy of god.
And so make an ende of our sermo~ if the mercy of our lord vouchesafe to be present and fauorable vnto me spekyng to you.
God aborreth nothynge so as pryde obstaclenes: for he resisteth the proude and gyueth grace to the hu~ble.
To this blynd madnes mad blyndnes many are brought throughe {pro}sperite of te~poral goodes whiche as forgetfull of theyr maker they lyuen after theyr pleasure so moche vnthoughtfull to amende theyr lyfe that they boost vngratiousnes stronge myghty in wickednes.
And as we rede i~ an other place: They their yll doynge and reioyce in most vngratious thynges: Wherof Solomon writeth: The wicked ma~ whan he cometh to the bottu~ of yls he is careles.
And of suche folke Paule wrytethe: God gyueth them a peruersed iugement to do those thynges that be nat comely.
Some of them promise them selfe that they shall skape vnpunyshed for euer despise holsome monyshyon and wyll nat here of suche thynges as shulde prouoke them to repentance sayeng: Let god haue heuen hym selfe let hym leaue vs the erth.
Of these speketh Moyses in his canticle whan many great benefites of god to the people of Israell remembred he addeth: My welbeloued is waxed grosse kycketh: he is waxed fat and broode: he hath forsaken god his maker, and is departed from god his sauiour.
peynteth this maner of me~: They be nat in the labour of me~ they shall nat be scorged with me~.
Bycause pride reteineth them they be couered with iniquite theyr wickednes they be gone in to affectio~ of hert.
They haue thought and spoken leudnes, and they haue talked wickedly agaynst almyghty god.
They haue sette theyr mouth agaynst the heuen and theyr to~ge is gone ouer in erthe.
But yet for all theyr wyles thou hast begyled them thou dyddest cast them downe wha~ they wold vp.
Howe were they disco~ted? they fayled sodaynly perished for their wickednes.
Good lorde i~ thy cite shalt reduce ye image of them to naught as ye dreame of them that ryse fro~ slepe.
On them that folowing Lucifers example ryse vp agaynst god shall fall yt our lorde thret+neth in ye gospell: sawe Satanas as lightnyng fal from heuen.
And Corozaim through abu~dance of transitory thynges wickedly swellyng, hereth: Wo to the Corozaim for thou that nowe lyfte vp to heuen by thy pryde shalt be plucte downe to helle by the ve~geance of god.
Paule also somtyme on trust of his cou~trey lawes was fierce proude thretned to slee the disciples of our lorde and for by the ryght hande of god ouerthrowen to the erth he hereth: It is harde for ye to kycke agay~st ye pricke.
But bycause in his dede was errour and nat wayward malice he optayned mercy.
Assone as he aknowleged his syn god forgaue hym and nat only forgaue hym but also of a wolfe he made hym a shepe of a tyran a postle.
But the curse of god hangeth ouer them that continue in synne at laste beynge indurated and obstinate therin wyll nat vndersta~de to do well: whiche say to god: Go thy way fro~ vs we wyl nat haue knowlege of thy wayes.
Agayne they yt Esaie speaketh of whiche our lorde calling to wepyng waylyng, cuttyng of theyr heare and to weare shertes of heare they make myrth and reuell kylling calues and sacrifieng shepe yt they may eate the fleshe and drinke wyne sayeng: Let vs eate and drynke for to morowe we shal dye.
And they as the same prophet sayth that scorne the thretninges of god steryng them to repe~t: Byd byd agayne byd byd agayne, abyde abyde agayne abyde abyde agayne a litel there a lytell there.
And the whiche say agayne in an other place: We wyll nat here our lorde but we wyll dye in our synnes: to these as ye olde {pro}uerbe sayth Pacience oft greued turneth in to madnes: and the mercy of our lorde despised is turned in to greuouser dampnacion.
For our lorde mocked in Esaie answereth after: The sayeng of our lorde to them shal be: Byd byd agayne byd byd agayne abyde abyde agayne abyde abyde agayne a litel there a lytell there that they may go fall backewarde and be all to rent and attrapped taken.
These vnhappy folke go left in theyr yll desires alway waxyng worse they fall in to the pyt of wickednes they be tangled in the cordes of syn they be take~ in the net of euerlasting da~nacion leading theyr dayes amo~ge theyr goodes in a moment they go to hell.
very wretched creatures holly gyue~ to distructio~ whiche like as beastis be fatted to be kylde whom neither the enormite of syn maketh to forgette pryde nor so great hyndnes of god te~dreth them to repe~t.
The mercy of god suffreth the so ofte to synne yt thou shuldest amende he gyueth the space to repent, in the mean while he taketh nat fro~ the his benignite he gyueth the good helth he gyueth the riches, he gyueth the other co~modites of ye lyfe, as in maner settyng vp castyng coles of fire ouer thy heed yt if thou canst nat hate thy syn, for that it is most shamfull of selfe yet at lest shuldest begyn to hate it sith it displeaseth so louyng a father.
Eschinus a yong ma~ {per}ceiuing i~ a play ye maruelous hyndnes of his father toward hym offe~dy~g was moued yt fro~ the~s forth he wolde haue him i~ greatter reuere~ce these be his wordes: What thyng is this? is this to be a fader or this to be a son? If he were my brother or felowe how myght he folowe more my mynde? Is he nat to be loued? ought he nat to be borne in mynde? Ah he maketh me right careful with his leest shulde vnware do ought contrary to his mynde for wittingly wyl beware therof.
If fatherly hyndnes teche wytty childre~ to hate syn thou vnhappy synner dost thou waxe more more obstinate for so great goodnes of thy father, herest nat Paule calling agayne fro~ madnes? Dost thou despise saith he, the riches of thy goodnes pacience and mekenes? Knowest nat that ye ge~tylnes of god leadeth the to repe~tance? But after thy hardnes vnrepe~tant harte thou getherest vnto the a treasure of anger in the day of anger and the reuelacio~ of the iuste iugeme~t of god.
No beast is so wylde, yt by me~s dilige~ce labour is nat tamed, yu {pro}uoked by so excedy~g benefit of god art also more fierce agaynst hym? Nothynge is so harde that is nat made softe by crafte of me~.
Brasse melteth in the furnes yro~ by fyre is made softe horne with waxe poured in soupleth the inui~cible hardnes of ye diamond is ouerco~e wt gottis blud: And hart harder than horne harder than yron harder tha~ the diamond that neither ye fyre of hell nor the hyndnes of thy moste ge~tyl father nor ye blud of the vndefiled lambe shed for the can mollifie: yea is made more harder than all these.
Nowe be ioyfull make triumphe of wickednes yu hast ouercome wretche thou haste ouerco~e diuine craft whiche is most vnhappy victori.
Unhappy is the grou~de as Paule sayth nerest the curse of god whiche whan it ofte receiueth heuenly moyst+nes it bri~geth forth none other thing but thornes wydes: howe moche more vnhappy is he that is so ofte moisted with rayne of diuine mercy and waxeth harde as any rough sturdy stone that he wyl receyue no print of the holy gost? The fynger of god wrote the lawe to Moyses in stony tables so that thy hart is sturdier tha~ these stones, wher in ye holy goost can write nothing of Christis lawe.
Who shall cut vs these stony hartes but he whose dethe cloue ye stones yt they myght go out of theyr tu~bes yt were deed? Who shal giue vs a fleshy hart but ye worde of god that for vs was made fleshe? But yet they be more desperate tha~ these whiche reioysyng in theyr syns spred abrode blasphemo{us} wicked opinio~s denyeng god to be aboue, or if he be that mortal folkes busynes {per}teyne nothyng to hym: to be no life after deth of the body: no i~mortalite to be prepared for them that here lyued dedeuoutly in Christ Iesu: nor helle ppared for them that here serued the deuyll: the thretnynges of holy scripture to be vayne: the {pro}myses of the gospel to be lyes: or they that by wronge expoundyng of scripture defe~de their mischeuous dedes for good actis: and the worde of god wherby the yll desyres of the mynde ought to be corrected they compell to supporte theyr fylthynes to other crymes they laye the wickednes of heresy as most worste rebuke.

They be they whiche folowyng Cain Iudas the traitour despeyre of forgyuenes swaloweth in to euerlastyng distructio~.
There is but one distruction though ye reason of perishyng be diuers.
Pharao indurated sayth: knowe no lorde nor wyll nat let the peple go.
What sayth Cain? My syn is greatter tha~ may diserue {per}don.
And what sayth Iudas? haue synned betraieng ye innoce~t blud.
Both they aknowlege the greatnes of theyr synne both they co~fesse it both repe~t theyr mysdede but both they go away fro~ the face of our lorde in whom onely is mercy ple~tifull rede~tion fro~ synnes.
For thus ye rede of Cain: And Cain goynge away fro~ the face of our lorde dwelled a ru~ne a gate in a cou~trey towarde the Est. &c.
And Iudas departyng fro~ the banket of saynctes returneth nat agayne: He is vnhappy, that so goeth fro~ the face of the mercy of god that he returneth nat agayne.
This is he thynke that Ieremias meaneth whan he saith: Wepe nat for ye deed ne mourne nat for hym: with wepyng bewayle hym that goeth out bicause he returneth no more agayne.
He wil nat ye deed to be wept for bicause somtyme he must aryse agayne.
He with al maner wepyng shuld be wayled yt turneth hym selfe away from the well of euerlastyng lyfe and neuer by penance returneth agayne fro~ thens he went.
That prodigall riottous chylde went away in to fer cou~trey he left ye house of his moost louyng father but he is returned agayne.
Peter swarued far fro~ our lorde whan he forsoke hym thrise: but shortly aft he came agayne wha~ he reme~bred the worde that Iesus spake he bega~ to wepe bytterly.
He had forgotten hym selfe but whan he came to him selfe agayne he returned to Iesus.
Lyke wise Esaie crieth: Reme~bre ye this be ye co~fu~ded and you sy~ners come to your harte agayne.
Peter reme~bred hym selfe and returned to his hart: the stony hart was take~ fro~ hym the pomisehart, out of whiche no drop of teares coude be got: a flesshe hart was gyue~ hy~ out of whiche anon spra~ge a welle of teares bytter for ye sorowe of pena~ce but holsome for the innoce~cy to hym restored.

Iudas yt was so oft {pro}uoked by our lordes to be sory ame~de, stacke styll in his wicked purpose.
But Peter at the lokyng of Iesus hym reme~bred our lordes sayeng by by knew hym selfe and as vnworthy of our lordes psence he drewe abacke nat to hange hym selfe but to wepe that is nat to despeyre but to remedy.
Iudas folowyng Cain the auctour of this mischiefe aknowleged truly the greatnes of his syn but he reme~bred nat the wordes of our lorde that euery where in holy scripture {pro}uoke vs to returne that stere vs to do penance and promise vs mercy.
For what padge is in holy scripture that sou~deth the mercy of god? speke nat only of the newe testament that is the lawe of grace but also of the olde testament that is thought more rigorous.
Let vs here howe ge~tilly our lorde in ye {pro}phet Ieremy that vnder the {per}sone of the spouse leauyng her husba~de, aba~doneth her euery where to euery body he reclaymeth his people to pena~ce: Turne to me sayth he ye childre~ returny~g agayne sayth our lorde, for am your husba~de.
And in Iob our lorde openeth the eare of the sinners, that he may correct them: and speketh that they shuld returne fro~
But they be yt agaynst this our lordes voyce stoppe theyr eares lyke the dee edder that stoppeth her eares for the lest a shulde here the voyce of the enchanter wysely: To day sayth the psalme if ye here his voyce be nat harde harted.
To day is ours as longe as we be in this lyfe whiche all the while hit lasteth our lorde cesseth nat to speke to vs stery~g vs to do penance offryng forgyuenes, ppared
What sayd forgyuenes? The mercy of god is more whiche promiseth to them that returne a precious gyfte.
For thus we rede in Iob: If thou wylt returne to almyghty god thou shalte be edifyed and shalte voyde wickednes far fro~ thy tent: for erth he shall gyue the a flynt stone, for a flint stone golden ryuers.
Let vs here the mercy of our lorde in Esaie steryng vs to repenta~ce: If ye seke saith he seke returne and come: if ye seke thende of yuels seke hit nat in children of men in whom is no saluacion nor of e~chantours nor by hangyng your selfe but aske it of me that alone both may and am redy to forgyue.
Only returne from those thynges that ye fylthily haue loued turned come to me.
Agayne in the same {pro}phet e~tysyng al mankynde to hym he sayth: Am nat a lorde? and there is no more god but I: God iuste and holy is none be+syde me: returne to me and ye shal be al the costis of the erth for am god and there is none other.
These wordes our lorde speketh to gentils, idolworshippers to ma~kyllers, churche robbers blasphemers: thou wretche by dispeyre woldest turne away from our lorde? In olde tyme whan synne vnpunished rayned amo~ge folke the merry of god semed to be drawen within ye narow bou~des of Iudee.
But by the gospell mercy spred ouer all costes of the worlde: In Ieremye also he thretneth the obstinate but he offereth them forgyuenes prepared that repent ame~de: If that folke sayth he, wyll do pena~ce for theyr synne that haue spoke~ agaynst them wil also do pena~ce vpon ye harme that thought haue done them.
And he yt a lyttel before thretned distruction pluckyng vp by the rotes sparklyng about promyseth thynges co~trary, and sodaynly sayth: speke of the people realme that may edifie it and that may plant it.
Like wyse in Ezechiel he nat only {pro}miseth hym {per}do~ yt turneth agayne but also that he wold forget all the synnes that he had done before: For whan he had afore reme~bred euery kynde of myschefes and da~nable dedes he addeth: If the wicked man wyl do pena~ce for al the synnes that he hath wrought and wil kepe al my co~mandementes and wyl do iugeme~t and he shal lyue and shall nat dye: wyll nat reme~bre al the iniquitees that he hath wrought.
Is it my wyll sayth our lorde that a synner shulde dye and nat rather yt he shulde be co~uerted fro~ his sinnes lyue? And a lytell lower: Be ye co~uerted and do pe+na~ce for all your synnes and your wickednes shal nat distroye you: throwe away all your offences wherby ye haue tra~sgressed: and make you a new hart and a newe spirite.
And why die ye the house of Israel? Bicause will nat the deth of ye dyeng treature sayth our lorde turne agayne and come.
Why despeyrest thou wretche sith god for this se~t downe his son in to this worlde shuldest haue good hope? He hym selfe vndouted is the mercy of god, of whom Dauid syngeth: god we haue re+ceyued thy mercy in ye myddis of thy churche.
He rysyng crieth: wyl nat the deth of a synner, but rather that he shulde be co~uerted lyue.
Here this voyce thou vnhappy synner shake of deedly slepe rise a+gayne with Christ that thou mayst lyue in hym.
For he reuiued to thende ye deth of syn shulde nat alway possesse the.
And if any body suspect yt this mercy of god is nat ppared nor redy but for these that co~myt fewe lyght syns let hym here what our lorde with a clere voyce promiseth: Whan so euer a synner bewayleth his synnes wyll forget al his iniquitees.
He excepteth no kynde of synne, he po~dreth nat the greatnes or multitude of offen+ces.
Be sory only and forgetfulnes of all thy syns past is redy.
For small offences without whiche ma~s frailte lyueth nat, we call dayly vpo~ the mercy of god sayeng: Dimitte nobis debita nostra. &c.
For gyue vs as we forgyue them that offe~de vs: And we be herde if we here our neyghbour prayenge that we shuld forgyue him.
And also amo~ge deedly synnes is a certeyne order as amonge me~ some slepe nat very sou~dly so that with a litel whistry~g they awake: there be that slepe more depely that one must speke loude to wake them: there be that slepe most depely that vneth with great tuggy~ge they wyl awake: so with god som be lighter deed some more greuously and some moste greuously.
But no kynde of dethe is so desperate and deedly, yt he with his voyce dryueth nat awaye at whose voyce also they rise agayne that were deed i~ theyr graues: and no man is take~ with so depe slou~bre of deth that is nat by hym reysed.
This threfold difference of synners ye deuout interpreters of holy scriptures suppose signified to vs by thre corses that we rede were reysed from dethe to lyfe by our lorde Iesu.
The maister of the sinagogis daughter a mayde .xij. yere of age he reysed in ye house a fewe admytted to se it he forbade to tell abrode that was done.
These be they yt fyrste nat of purposed malice but eyther by sleprenes of age or by mans frailnes be so slyden in to som synne yt they be nat yet obstinate in yll nor yet no foule rumour ru~neth of that mysdede.
Our lorde Iesus lightly reyseth those with his hande put for the hydynge theyr fylthynes and prouidynge for theyr shamefastnes.
But he reysed vppe the wyddowes sonne with more busynes.
Nowe the carkeys was caried to the in goyng our lorde met them, he moued with ye sely woma~s weping bade them stande styl that bare the biere, he reysed the yonge ma~. Fyrst he sittech vp soone aft he speketh shortly after he skyppeth out of the coffyn is deliue+red to his mother agayne.
These be they vndouted that be so fer iro~ne in synne that they be infamy can nat be reclaymed fro~ synnyng: they by open penance lytell lytell be reised agayne to life.
He sitteth vp whiche forsakyng syn, lyfteth vp hy~ selfe to ye purpose of a better lyfe.
He speketh, that co~fessyng his foule synnes aknowlegeth ye mercy of god.
He is yelded to his mother a lyue that aft al remedies accomplished is restored to the co~munion of the churche agayne.
He is bewayled onely of his systers and fre~des here Iesus byddeth to shewe hym the graue he wepeth he make the soune with his mouthe and is troubled in spirite he co~mandeth to take away the stone and with a loude voyce he byddeth hym to come forth: he cometh forth but he is bou~de he is losed and so at last he is yelded to his systers agayne.
It was no great thyng for our lorde to reyse a carkeys .iiij. dayes deed it is a greatter maystrie to reyse a synner that .xl. yeres lyued nat but lay stynkyng defiled with al maner fylthy synne.
childe saith Esaie of an hu~dred yeres shal dye and a sinner of an hu~dred yeres shalbe cursed.
And ye same our lorde Iesus wyll vouchesafe to reyse so yt he at last wyll here hym callyng.
He cryeth dayly aryse mayde~ aryse yonge man come forthe Lazare.
But hel as many more than deed here nat his voyce callyng vs agayne to lyfe.
But what thyng is to here but to beleue? Incredulite or hard belefe stoppeth the eares of wicked folkes that ye voyce of holy scripture can nat entre i~ to theyr myndes.
Let vs pray the mercy of god that he wyll vouchesafe to sou~de out aloude his almyghty voyce and to synge it to those wretched desperate folke: Thou deffe and du~me spirite co~mand the get ye out of this ma~ and entre no more in to hym.
Nowe to the ende ye may se more playnly howe redy the mercy of god is to hym that repe~teth ame~deth here haue sayd wyll aknowlege agaynst me myn vnrightousnes to our lorde: and thou hast forgyuen me the wickednes of my syn. Nat yet but to one only myndyng co~fession ye mercy of god ru~neth.
Be sory co~fesse the but let it be afore god.
Many wayle afore me~ they wepe in ye sight of peple they confesse them to men they rent theyr clothes but it is afore ye people, they weare ye heare they spryncle ashes on theyr heed but it is afore people.
Whiche thynges if they were done before god yt is to say with all the hart with pure affection ye mercy of god cesseth nat.
Cut rent sayth he your hartes and nat your garme~tes.
For god wyll nat despise a contrite and an hu~ble hart.
Let vs wepe sayth the psalme writer before god that made vs. Many faste but nat the faste that our lorde wylleth: many change theyr rayment but they change nat theyr affection.
And yet it is so that these thinges also must be done amo~ge men that they whom our malyce prouoked to synne may be called agayne by penance to ame~de.
But these thynges are vnprofitably done amonge the peple except they be fyrst done in the of god Iudas confessed his syn but it was to the pharises: if he had co~fessed him to our lorde, by by the most mild mercy of our lord had e~braced him.
And to thende our co~fession may be more acceptable to god Osee ye {pro}phet sheweth to vs also ye fourme of confession: Take saythe he with you wordes, returne to our lorde and say to hym Take away al iniquite fro~ vs and receyue good we shall gyue the againe the calues of our lyppes.
Let vs also that haue wandred many wayes, returne to hym agayne that alone taketh away the sinnes of the worlde ye whiche for our sinnes shed his precious blud let vs say to hym: Take away fro~ vs al the yll that we wickedly wrought.
What frely? And receyue good what good? The calues of our lyppes.
We shall gyue thankes to thy mercy wherto we be bou~de for euery good dede we dyd after our fal, thou shalt take fro~ vs yt is ours, shalt receiue of vs yt is thyne.
Ye but se howe wel with him accordeth the prophet Iohel expressyng the same sentence with other wordes, for whan god by him had sharply thretned those that regarded nat his mercy to them offered this he bryngeth in after: Returne to your god for he is myld merciful, pa+cient and of moche mercy and repe~tyng vpo~ malice.
The greatnes of sinnes ouerthroweth but ye greatnes of goddis mercy can lyft vp agayne. se by howe many wayes the {pro}phet ampfieth it.
He is gentyll, orels as hit is in Greke mercifull.
Though this was inough that we shuld nat despeyre yet he addeth: And hauing pite, yt we may vndersta~d, yt he nat only helpeth vs, but also is sory for our iuels.
And herwith nat co~te~t he addeth pacient that is to say easy and nothyng hasty to take vengeance lyke as humayn mercy is lightly turned to dysdayne.
If thy sinnes by many, mistrust nat, mercy is moche.
What remayneth nowe but that yu must be co~uerted and go to him entisyng ye? But if ye punysheme~tes of mercy feare yt, herke take corage: And taking repentance of his malice.
He calleth the peynes and afflictions that are due for our synnes malice.
What resteth tha~? nothyng, but that thou shuldest aknowlege the mercy of god.
And he shall leaue after hym blessyng sacrifice to our lorde god.
Truly this is it yt Osee sayd: The calues of the lyppes that is to say sacrifice of preyse and thanke gyuyng.
If any greuously and ofte shuld offende a mortal man howe harde is the making at one, howe mindeth he the wro~ges howe slowly asswageth the anger howe lightly for a trifyl falleth he in ye old grudge, howe frowardly asketh he amendis for the offence: and yet if they so receiue them in fauour agayne they be called gentyl.
God so oft offe~ded willingly prouoketh vs to repenta~ce he entiseth vs to forgyuenes, he perdoneth thretninges, he forgyueth helle peyne he offreth for punyshement benignite yea and he nat only his face towarde the synner mendyng and repentyng but voluntarily he meteth hym turnyng agayne with his armes spred abrode he wol enbrace hym conuerted.
Undouted the same is it that he {pro}miseth in zacarie: Turne ye to me sayth the lorde of ostis, and wyl turne to you saith the lorde of ostis.
What is that to Turne ye to me? aknowlege your wretched+nes and desyre my mercy.
What is: and wyll turne to you? By and by of a reuenger and punysher made an helper wyll helpe forwarde your purposes that ye can nat brynge to passe by your owne stre~gthes ye may opteyne it by my fauour.
No man coude holsomely hate his syn but if god granted hit except he take away the stony harte and put in a sleshie harte: but if for a defiled hart he worke in vs a clene hart except for an yll spirite he renewe in our bowels a good iuste spirite.
But why take this labour to reherce some olde places of scripture whiche declaren the marueylous mercy of god? All the scripture of olde testame~t alabout preacheth syngeth and layeth before vs the mercy of god.
And where be those fra~ticke foles rather than heretickes that of one make two goddis one of the olde testament that was onely iuste nat good: the other of the newe that shuld be onely good and nat iuste coude they nat at leest wise here this songe that is so often tymes rehersed in the psalme .Cxvij.
Aknowlege to god that he is good and that his mercy is in all worldes.
Where is mad Manicheus that taught in his bo+kes that he that speketh to vs so louyngly by his prophettes and that dyd ordeyne Moyses lawe was no veray god but one of the wycked dyuels.
The selfe same is god of both the lawes the same trouth the same mercy by Iesu Christ our lorde saue that in Moyses lawe be shadowes in the gos+pell trouth: in the other was promyse in this is {per}fourmance: in that was moche and great mercy towarde the Iewes here is the holle well of mercy or rather the see that hath flowen ouer all nacions of the holle worlde by whiche flode the syns of al mortal creatures are washed and skoured away.
Surely this was the happy flode of mercy: the olde flode (a fewe saued) distroyed ye synners: this holsome flode washeth away ye syns saueth al yt beleue in the sonne of god.
He that in bokes of the olde testament promyseth the Hebrewes repe~tyng ame~dyng forgyuenes the same present in the gospel crieth to euery ma~: Come to me al that labour be loden and wyll refreshe you.
Take my yocke vpon you and ye shal fynde rest for your soules.
Rede the lyfe of Christe ouer ouer what thynge els se ye therin but co~tinuall mercy toward euery body? He healed sicke folke frely he fed the hu~gry he succoured them that were in perill he made lepers holle clene he gaue the blynde their sight, restored ye lame theyr lymmes he droue away dyuels he reysed deed me~ to lyfe he assoyled them yt were repe~ta~t.
Agayne serche out al his techyng what other thing doth it sauer tha~ excedy~g great mercy of god? By howe many parables printeth he ye same in our my~des, yt we shulde slyde no For what other thyng sheweth the parable of the shepe brought agayne on ye sheperdis shulders of ye pece of money lost fou~de of the holle folke that nede a phisicio~ of ye seruant to whom all his duyte is gyuen agayne of the vserer that forgaue both the dettours, of the publican pharisee of ye pylgrym hurt, whom the samaritan healeth, of ye stewarde to his dettours of ye disceiuer of his maister of the ryottous childe receyued agayne? And the very cleapynge of the gospell doth it nat by by promyse mercy? What promiseth hit? To blinde sight, to prisoners {per}don, to ye broke~ holnes shortly to speke a yere acceptable to our lorde that desireth none other thynge but mans saluacion.
Nowe the same name of Iesu that is of a sauiour what other thynge {pro}myseth it but saluacion mercy? If he had proclaymed hym selfe a iuge it had be~ somwhat why one shuld haue be~ afrayd, nowe thou herest sauiour and despeyrest of salua+cion? And so forthe to thende ye truste of saluacion shuld seme more certaine, bicause it wold seme vnlykely that so great a lake of synnes that all ma~kynde was defiled with shulde be purged cle~sed with the blud of gottis calues he the son of god got vp on the auter of ye crosse and for our synnes he offred hym selfe most effectuall sacrifice to cle~se all our synnes.
And hangynge on the same crosse he prayed for them that crucified hym for them reuile rayle vpon hym: thynkest thou aknowlegyng thy syn sorowfully besechyng his mercy he wyll deny ye forgyuenes? Trust to hym merciful yu shalt fynde mercy, what thyng is it ye faith opteyneth nat of Christe? He that mistrusteth the phisicio~ is his owne let that he can nat haue his helth agayne.
Truely so moche god inclyneth to the prayers of wretches cryenge to hym yt he gyueth mercy at one other mans prayer, if he haue a good hope with hym.
The Canane crieth to him, and her daughter is made holle: ye Centurion tru+steth and his seruant is restored to his helth: the maister of the Synagoge prayeth his daught is reliued: the father desireth, his son is deliuered of a wicked dyuel.
The apostles crie: lorde saue vs we perishe and they be al saued.
In many folkes he nat the prayers of the he seeth ye fayth of the cariers sayth to the man sicke of ye palsey.
The mother only they that went with her wept ye yonge ma~ yt was deed ariseth Martha and Mary do nothyng but wepe and Lazer relyueth.
Mary the synner wepeth she annoynteth kysseth hym she hereth: Thy synnes be forgyuen the.
He prayeth inough that knowlegeth his sickenes; he prayeth veheme~tly that wepeth and hopeth.
The woma~ diseased with the blody flixe priuely toucheth the garment of Iesu and forth with she felt ye power of mercy co~ming forth.
Like wise we rede yt many other were cured by touchy~g ye garme~tes of Iesu.
So redy his mercy is euery where at euery occasio~ he succoureth wretches.
If yu darste nat call vpon Iesus if thou canst nat touche Iesus at lest touche priuely ye skyrt of his garme~t go to som holy ma~ in whom this vertue shyneth that with his prayers he may co~mende the to our merciful lorde.
For by them ofte~ tymes he putteth forth his power beyng redy on euery syde to gyue saluacion to euery ma~.
For yt ente~t he came this was the food, wherwith he was fedde, yt he might drawe synners to repe~ta~ce.
And in the boke of Genesis also whan wicked folke by theyr mischeuous dedes {pro}uoked the wrath of our lorde yet at the prayer of Abraha~ our lorde had forgyue~ many cities appoynted to be distroied if he coude haue founde .x. good men amonge the people.
The peple of Israel had deserued to be distroied our lorde at the prayers of Moyses restrayneth the sworde of vengea~ce.
blinde vnkynd folke that regarde nat the mercy of our lorde that is so metyng so redy euery where: but more vnhappy be they that wyllingly despeyre of that ye frely is offered them.
For what other thy~g souneth this voyce: And why dye ye the house of Israel? Agayne in an other place he bewayleth that he al the day had spred abrode his handes to the people without beleue striuyng agaynst him.
Agayne in Micheas: My people what haue done to ye or wherin haue greued the answere me? Lyke wyse in Esaie: What is hit that ought to haue done more to my vyne and haue nat done it? Our lorde doth euery thynge that he myght saue vs and shal we wylfully cast away hope of saluacion? In the gospell also he wepeth for Hierusalem the whiche through obstinacy of syn caused distructio~ of it selfe.
Howe oft sayth he wold haue gethered the to gether as the henne gethereth her chekyns vnder her wynges and ye wolde nat? Our most merciful lorde wepeth that he can nat lefully saue wretches mystruste we hym as though he wolde nat saue vs? In the gospell all the house ru~bleth for ioye that the childe that was deed relyued agayn, yt ye perished, was recouered agayn.
He the good father exhorteth the holle company of a~gels and sainctes to reioyce al to gether, that one synner is brought agayne to penaunce, and thou wretche despeirest and enuiest thyn owne saluacio~ and to our lorde fo passyng great ioye? Beleue we that he whom the dethe of synners greueth whom the conuertyng of wicked folke gladdeth wyll deny forgyuenes to them, yt be sory ame~de? He calleth euery body to the brydale he wyl haue his house full yea he compelleth the blynd lame to entre in to his house.
Why tariest thou behinde wretche? Why canst nat thou be drawen from the draffe of swyne? Why striuest thou agay~st ye mercy of our our lorde? Christ is the wisedome of god.
This wisedome as sayth Solomon departed out of her fathers house came in to this worlde, preacheth ope~ly and her voyce is herde in the stretes.
She crieth in the fro~te of multitudes in ye wicket+tes of ye cite gates, she {pro}nou~seth out her wordes sayeng: Howe lo~ge wyl ye loue childhed babes and foles, couet thynges noyfull to them and vndiscrete hate counnyng? Turne you to my correctio~.
Beholde wyl put forth my to you and shall shewe you my wordes.
What thynge is more folishe than for vayne transitory thinges to be depriued of euerlasty~g goodes? What is greatter wysedome than by short sufferance to get immortalite? Therfore they be all mad that co~tinue in synne: they be wyse that chaunge theyr lyfe in to better.
With what great labours serche we out the most vile thyng amonge and so great treasure offered and frely offered we despisen or yt is more folyshe we despeyre~? God is riche in mercy.
The treasure of humayn riches is co~sumed in gyuynge away: the treasure of mercy can nat be consumed.
And this wyll adde, that may the more put euery body from despeyre of pardone.
God hath bou~de his fayth to man and as Paule he can nat deny hym
He nat to be rebuked if he {per}forme that he {pro}myseth.
For so he speketh in Esaie to the people defyled on euery syde: Be ye washed be clene take away fro~ my syght your yl thoughtes cesse to do wickedly lerne to do well seke iugeme~t succour the oppressed deale truly with ye orphlin defende ye wydow and come ye rebuke me saythe our lorde.
Thou herest what thyng els requyreth our merciful lorde but onely cha~gyng of thy lyfe? And lest thenormite of synnes ouerpresse thy mynde here the forgyuenes of them all redy.
If your synnes sayth he were as skarlette they shall be made as white as snowe: and if they were as red as oker they shalbe as white as wolle.
If ye wil ye may here me ye shall eate the goodes of ye erthe? Who is so mad that wyll nat be saued? What is more easy tha~ to here our most louyng father nothing co~mandyng but that {per}teyneth to our felicite? If wyll sayth he and ye may here.
No man may saue hym wyl nat. Saluacio~ is by fayth fayth is vy hering.
The worde is helthfull in thy harte and in thy mouth.
Nowe if a king shuld say thus to his e~mies or to suche as be co~uicted of high treason: What so euer is done or was entended hitherto, forgyue it you al, mercy is redy for al, so they fro~ the~s forth wolde absteyne fro~ lyke yl dedes: wolde nat euery body speke of ye kinges wo~derfull mercy, yt neither cruelly punisheth their bodies, nor co~fisketh their goodes? But god yea with reward entiseth vs to ame~de our life.
Ye shal eate sayth he, the goodes of the erthe.
But they be vtterly vnworthy to haue ye fruicion of goodes of this worlde that by theyr vngratious dedes offende the gyuer of all.
But howe moche more precyous is it that ye gospell {pro}miseth: wyl gyue you a newe hart wyl gyue you a newe spirite wherby of the dyuels thrals ye shall be made the chyldren of god wherby shalbe made me~bres of myn only begotten sonne wherby ye shal entre into the heretage of the heuenly kyngdome.
thou Iewe why thyn eares fro~ trouth turnest to the tales of the Talmudicens Deuterotis? Thou vnwyse philosopher why shuttest thyn eares against this techer, herkenest to Plato and Aristotel? Why herest thou vnhappy progeny of Eue ye serpent with vayne promises entisynge the to distruction herest nat the sonne of god callyng the to the company of euerlastynge felicite? Do penance sayth he the kyngdome of heuen is at hande.
The son promiseth the father pledgeth it the holy gost in the mean while is gyuen as an ernest peny: and doutest thou to take e~brace so great felicite offred ye? And there is none other voice of thapostles tha~ of our lorde, Do penance, let eche of you be baptised in the name of Iesu Christ in remissio~ of your synnes ye shal receyue the gyft of the holy gost.
And a litel aft: Kepe you fro~ this vngratious nacion yt ye may be saued: leaue the spotted, fylthy, wretched lyfe and take euerlastyng lyfe.
Souldiours, publicans, harlottes, idolworshippers, ma~kyllers, nigroma~cers, baudes, aduoutrers, ru~ne hither.
None is shut without the passage to mercy lyeth egally open to all.
The lyfe past is nat regarded so one be repe~tant.
Nor thou shuldest nat suppose this mercy of our lorde to stretche no farther tha~ batisme, thoughe Mo~tanus shut ye churche dores against them that slyde after baptisme our lorde neuer shutteth the dore of ye heue~ly kingdome.
The entra~ce in to the churche by baptisme is ones gyuen the figure wherof the arke of beareth but by the mercy of god ye seconde bourde is left to eche after the shyp wracke yea to come agayne in to ye arke by pena~ce.
For baptyme is nat twise take~ as the deth of Christe is nat renewed but the water of teares doth remayne wherwith now the fylthy sinnes ben washed away, ye sope of holsome contricion remaineth the herbe of
Truly they ought to whom ones all synnes were frely forgyuen, and that buried with Christe by baptisme rose with hym agayne in a newe life, to co~tynue with hym in that great gyft that they receiued.
But our pitefull mercifull lorde knowyng the weakenes of mans nature he wylled remedy of penance to be redy for eche euen to the lyues ende.
But bicause the day of deth is certayne to none all ought to watche that they despise nat ye goodnes of god: but if they hap to slide agayne by and by they shulde hast to remedy before ye disease by co~tinuance waxe vncurable.
Some i~ olde tyme with right great peril forbare baptisme eue~ to the last day of theyr lyfe whom some called bad christiens and some yll watered as christie~s nat very true: but with more ie{per}dy ye synner {pro}lo~geth the remedy of penance that is euery where redy.
The christener is nat alway present but lyeng in thy bed thou mayst co~fesse thyn vnrightousnes to our lorde and purpose to amende thy lyfe.
One is nat alway present to washe thy body: teares be alway present, with whiche thou mayst washe ye fyl+thes of thy soule.
And nat without a cause a dout is whether ye baptisme be effectual wherby wha~ ther is no hope of life and were in pa~ges of deth were rather spryncled with water than baptised.
For they shewed yt they wolde a synned co~tinually if they myght haue lyued styll.
But moche more southly great lerned men doute whether pena~ce be fruteful yt is {pro}lo~ged a purpose nowe de{per}tyng he~ce they take it and wold nat take it except deth co~pelled them.
For lyke as grou~de ofte moysted wt heue~ly raine, bry~geth forth naught els to his tyller than thornes wydes is cursed caste in to ye fyre: so god other while for his goodnes obstacly despised, endueth them with a peruersed mynde.
Wherfore ye surest way most dere brethern~ is nat to {pro}longe the mendyng of the lyfe but by by at the voyce of our lorde, callyng vs to do of ye old ma~ with his dedes and desyres lest our lord so oft nat herde wyll nat here vs agayne callynge to hym.
Dredeful is ye voice, wherwith he thretneth them that wyll nat here him mercifully cally~g.
Bicause sayth he called you ye turned away: reched forth my ha~de ther was none that wold se it: ye despised al my cou~sayle and set naught by my rebukes: also wyl laugh and scorne i~ your distruction, wha~ it shal fall on you that ye drad.
Whan sodayne calamite ouerthroweth ruine as a te~pest dassheth downe whan trouble greffe assayleth: than they wyll call on me wyl nat here them.
They shal arise yerly and they shal nat fynde me, bicause they hated my lernyng and wolde nat co~ceyue the drede of their lorde wolde nat rest vpo~ my cou~saile, and wold withdrawe fro~ al my correctio~.
At last wha~ our obstaclenes hath ouerco~e al remedies he forsaketh vs as desperate and leaueth vs wt our owne fre wyl.
Like as a phisicio~ assaynge al yt his crafte can to put away the disease whan he seeth the pacient forsake all medicins at last he leaueth hym with his sickenes as he that wyll nat lyue.
The day of iugeme~t abydeth al after they shal be departed this lyfe.
As longe as this lyfe lasteth, there is hope of mercy.
But they that lie dyeng or they that extreme olde age opresseth nowe in a maner lyue no more.
Here ye cou~sayle of the wyse Hebrewe what euer thou be that from day to day drawest the lynde of wickednes and makest no ende of synnynge: Turne the to our lorde saith he and forsake thy sinnes.
Pray the face of our lorde and mynishe thyn offences.
Returne to our lorde, and turne away fro~ thyn vngratiousnes and hate cursynge: and knowe the iustices and iugementes of god and stande in the lot of proposicion and speche of almyghty god go in to the partes of the iuste worlde with ye lyuyng gyuyng confession to god.
Thou shuldest nat abyde in the errour of wicked folke co~fesse before dethe.
Alyue and in helth thou shalt confesse preyse god and glorifie in his mercies howe great is the mercy of our lorde and his fauour to them that returne to hym.
Thou herest ye great mercy of god is redy but that is if thou aliue in heale wylt be co~fessed to our lorde.
But what shal we say of them whose bodyes be vnable to synne yet ye mynde putteth nat away the synfull appetite: and whan by reason of age the body is nere deed that they can nat do wycked and fylthy actes yet they leaue nat to speke leudly? Howe shulde they be confessed to our lorde alyue that leaue sooner to lyue tha~ to synne? But thou yonge ma~ in thy flowryng age why {pro}lo~gest the me~dyng of thy lyfe dayes monethes yeres? If thy body were diseased with the dropsy and thou haddest before ye redy a certayne sure remedy for yt disease woldest yu say The next yere wyl heale my sickenes? knowe wel yu woldest nat be so mad but yu woldest haste most gredily to be healed.
And i~ ye diseases of ye soule moche more perillous tariest driuest forthe fro~ day to day fro~ that day to that yea thou defferrest thy saluacion to ye day of thy dethe? And who is thy surete, that thou shalt lyue tyl to morowe? But these thinges be nat spoke~ to thende that any shulde despeyre of forgyuenes but to thente~t we wold wrest fro~ the careles continuance in synne.
There is synne yt neither in this worlde nor in the worlde to come, is forgyue~.
God forbyd yt any of vs shulde swarue so far wyde.
And therfore ye most sure thyng is to eschewe synne.
The next is, that by by we put it away by penance that is wrought vnskylfully.
good man falleth .vij. tymes on a day, but he riseth agayne: al though this be spoken by veniall syns.
And therfore our lorde ofte tymes thretneth vs sharply in holy scripture lest on trust of forgyuenes redy we shuld walowe in to the myer of vn+gratious dedes.
And therfore ye plaister of pena~ce is nat gyuen, that we wylfully shulde continue in our disease but lest he whiche perchaunce falleth shuld be lost for euer.
In Amos our lorde oft thondreth agaynst thre or foure wyckednessis: Shall nat abhorre them? It is wyckednes to thynke yll.
Here by by we shulde take repentance but is greatter wickednes to wyl to {per}fourme it yt thou dyddest mynde: at lest fro~ ye grice fote shuld step to better.
But the greuoust offence is fylthyly to {per}fourme it yt thou dyddest wickedly purpose.
And here we be neither sory nor amende but we put to it ye fourth wickednes accustomyng vs in heapyng syns vpo~ syns.
Nowe at this poy~t may nat our lord wel abhorre vs? Yes truly nere yt his mercy passed his iustice.
Beholde what foloweth after so sharpe thretny~ges in ye same {pro}phet: This sayth our lorde to the house of Israel: Seke ye shal fynd me seke your lorde come.
Let vs here our lorde thretnyng lest we shuld syn: let vs here our lorde reclaymyng vs yt we despeyre nat. Orels wo to vs if he shuld do to vs that he thretneth by the {pro}phete: and after the thyrde or fourth wickednes he shulde turne away fro~ vs his mercy leaue vs alone to our wyl. Yea with many of vs it shulde go yuel if our lorde shulde turne his face away after the thousande wickednes.
But by by as his rightousnes beginneth to waxe rigorous.
Mercy steppeth forth sayth: lord god be merciful: pray the who shal lyft vp Iacob for he is a babe? And agayne: lorde god pray the cesse who shall reyse vp Iacob for he is a babe? Thus Mercy our best defender pledeth the cause of our frailnes.
Nowe here howe redy forgyuenes is to one repentyng amendyng.
Ye se howe soone he thretnynge vengeance repenteth, if we truly wolde repent our misdedes.
praye you, what mother is so lightly pleased with her child? Therfore syth we haue a lorde so easy to please an aduocatrice so effectual what thing is there why any despeyryng of hym selfe shulde eyther co~tinue in sinnes or with Iudas flee to hange hym selfe? Euen for the same purpose our lorde by al meanes myndyng our saluacion suffered most excellent most approued me~ to fall in greuous synnes that by theyr example he myght corage co~forte vs to hope of perdone.
What thinge in holy scripture is more laudable tha~ kynge Dauid? He was a kyng he was a {pro}phet, he was a ma~ to goddes mynde of his linage Christe was {pro}mised.
But into howe foule in to howe many folde a synne dyd so great a ma~ fall? He hereth of Nathan ye rebuke and cruell thretnynges of our lorde.
But Dauid with two wordes turneth all this anger of god in to mercy.
He sayd: haue offended agaynst my lorde: And forthe with Nathan sayde: Our lorde also hathe transported thy syn thou shalt nat dye.
The thretninges be of a length yt he may correct but howe swyft is the voyce of mercy: Thou shalt nat dye? Like wise by Esaie Ezechias Thou shalt dye, shalt nat lyue.
The {pro}phet the messanger of dethe was nat yet gone halfe the kynges court but the mercy of our lorde called him agayne, sayeng: Re+turne backe and say to Ezechias capitayne of my people: This sayth our lorde ye god of Dauid thy father haue herde thy prayers haue seen thy wepyng and haue healed the.
The thyrde day after this thou shalt go in to the te~ple of our The thyrde boke of kynges wytnesseth ye same of Achab.
There was nat suche an other as Achab whiche was solde to thente~t he might do mischife in ye sight of our lorde.
And he hereth: Thou kylde more ouer hast possessed: As wha~ he had slayne Na both he occupied his vineyarde: but last he was so afrayde with ye cruel thretnynges yt he re~te his clothes ware a sherte of heare, he slept in wollen, wandred ha~gynge downe his heed.
was froward, he had oft our lorde rebukyng hym, he had heaped syns vpo~ syns: and at last he was rather feared with drede of mischefes hangyng ouer hym than myndyng to repe~t amende: and yet our lorde of excedynge mercy speketh to Hely: Hast nat seen how Achab hath hu~bled hym before me: bycause he hath hu~bled him for my sake, wyl bringe in no mischiefe in his days.
If yt might of false repe~ta~ce so great that it can wrest the reue~gyng sword out of the ha~de of god what shal the mynde do, truly changed in to a co~trary affection and nowe nat for drede of punisheme~t, but for the loue of god abhorreth yt he miswrought: For that entent he suffred Peter whiche he had apointed chiefe of his churche ope~ly to fall.
Whan he delyuered his shepe to hym to fede for whiche he suffred deth dyd he cast in his tethe offence of thrise forsakyng our lorde? No forsothe for nowe al that was so washed away with teares that there remayned nat a steppe in our mercifull lordes reme~brance.
Paule ye {per}secuter of our lordis churche was ouerthrowen, was made ye teacher of nacio~s.
We haue great examples of them that synned and eke of them that repented we ought nat by example of any to be {pro}uoked to synne lest we shulde te~pte our lorde but if any shulde hap to be attrapped by synne he hath examples of repe~ta~ce lest he shuld despeire.
But they do waywardly that wyll nat folowe hym in repe~tyng whiche they folowed in synnynge.
Howe many princes be ther that smyle at theyr auoutres and ma~slaughters for the example of Dauid? Al though in Dauid were so many excellent vertues yt this offence myght haue ben forgyue~ in reco~pe~ce of them: but wolde to god lyke as they folowe hym offendyng they wold so folowe hym eke repentyng.
He spred abrode his synne through al nacio~s of the worlde: and despised ye delectacions of the court for purpul he weareth a sherte of heare and as bread he ashes mingleth his drinke with wepy~g: euery night he wassheth his bed with teares and moysteth his couerled with weping.
And he was nat ashamed to say and synge this verse of pena~ce to al synners: Haue mercy vpo~ me lorde after thy great mercy.
And after the multitude of thy mercies put awaye my wickednes.
He was iuge and gaue sente~ce of deth agaynst hym selfe.
For great+ly disdaynyng he saythe: Our lorde lyueth for he is the childe of dethe that hath done this thynge.
He coude nat more euidently be condemned: than by his owne worde.
God was iuge and yet as the {per}sone were changed he co~mitted the iugement to hym that was gylty.
The iuge was taken with a trip and he ouercame that co~mitted to hym ye iugeme~t: Dauid was happily ouercome god ouercame mercifully wha~ he shewed ye synner to hym selfe that had forgot hym selfe.
Before as a co~que+rour and dro~ken with vnhappy prosperite he accomplished his pleasure with ye woma~ yt he loued, he delited in his moste swete childe but whan he was conuerted to our lorde than at laste he sawe where he was: and what difference was bitwene a rightous ma~ an vnrightous, like as an other prophecy teacheth.
Wha~ a sinner with al his hart aknowlegeth his fylthynes co~fesseth hym selfe worthy of punysheme~t tha~ our lorde is iustified and ouercometh whan he is iuged that is whan he offreth the iugeme~t to man as to be iuged him selfe.
But they that ordeyne theyr owne rightousnes make god in a maner vniuste a lier whiche wyl that his mercy shuld be knowen in euery ma~, and reioyceth to turne our vnrightousnes i~ to his glory: seyng where synne was plentiful there his fre liberalite abu~deth.
The olde Adam dyd nat so, but whan he was called to confession he laide the blame on his wife.
If they coude haue song the songe of Dauid, God haue mercy on me, they had nat ben banished paradise.
Cain nat goyng out of kynde what sayth he prouoked of our lorde to repent.
Am my brothers keper? If he had sayd, haue synned haue mercy: and if he had sayde hit with al his harte, the mercy of god was redy.
There is a carnall sorowe that engendreth deth suche as Iudas had: but agayne there is a godly sorowe that bryngeth forth saluacion and sure ioye.
Paule tenderly louedde all his yet he reioyseth that he had caste the Corinthies in suche a sorowe he damned that had a do with his fathers wyfe as out of suche sorow as after a bytter play+ster foloweth continual ioye.
And in ye mean while sure hope of saluacion with repentance te~pereth the bitternes of the sorowe.
So Dauid whan he had simply confessed his synne, and ye deserued wreache of god, herke howe moche hope he conceyued of the mercy of god: lorde sayde he spryncle me with isope and shalbe clensed thou shalt washe me and shalbe made whiter than ye snowe.
Nat of his owne good dedes, but by of ye i~maculate la~bes blud he promiseth hym selfe purenes, and whan he aknowleged hym selfe fro~ his mothers wombe with spottes yet out of yt washing he hopeth to haue fairenes of in+nocency that shulde passe the snowe in whitenes.
And he dothe nat only hope to opteyne innoce~cy agayne but also that ye wo of pena~ce shuld turne in spiritual ioye.
He sayth: Thou shalt gyue ioy gladnes to my hery~g my hu~ble bones shal lepe for ioye.
Yelde to me the gladnes of thy saluacion, and co~fyrme me with thy principal spirite.
wo~derfull trust of a synner, yet more largely he promyseth hym selfe somwhat: And my tonge sayth he shal shewe outwarde with great mirth thy iustice.
lorde thou shalt open my lyppes and my mouth shal shewe thy preyse.
Whan he hath proued the mercy of our lorde so great he wyl eke exhort other yt they shuld repent amende.
So our lorde sayd to Peter: And thou co~uerted somtyme confirme thy bretherne.
Dauid shulde haue perished if he had co~mytted hym selfe to Iustice but he in that part to weake called vpo~ mercy, therfore the mercies of our lorde he syngeth for euer.
They that plede matters amo~ge men as ofte as theyr cause is in ieo{per}dy, if they may, they remoue it in to an other courte all though they be in dout whether they shall fynde there a more egall iuge.
And truly may hap other while he that appeleth may appele to his da~mage.
But to vs moost dere bretherne hit is a thynge fer fer more sure nat to stryue with the iustice of god that is nat to caste vp our heles agaynst the pricke but by and by to calle vpon his mercy.
And truly in mennes iugementes they say there is nothynge surer than we may by some colour clene deny the cryme yt is layde agaynst vs: and the rhetoriciens teache the most miserable state of a cause to be: whiche they cleape deprecacion whan the defendant sayth haue offe~ded forgyue me.
Here co~trary wise there is nothynge surer for vs than wylfully to aknowlege what so euer we haue myswrought and to beseche ye iuge of mercy.
Hither syth the goodnes of god in all holy scripture so louyngly prouoketh vs sith the exa~ples of so many noble men exhorte vs hither why shuld any be fou~de whiche of hym selfe had leauer waxe olde in synnes? There is nothyng i~ god that is of simple nature that shulde striue with other, and yet if we behold those thynges that chance vs a stryfe shulde seme to be betwene goddes iustice and his mercy.
Iustice calleth to punyshement but mercy as saynth Iames sayth, leapeth vp agaynst iugement as a conquerour.
Who dyd euer crye: Iesu haue mercy: but by and by he opteined mercy? The Cananee crieth: Good lorde haue mercy her daughter is made holle: Euery synner eke shulde crye: Good lorde haue mercy and his soule shalbe healed.
He the blinde begger crieth: son of Dauid haue mercy and his cloke cast away he receyued his sight.
Let vs eke crye: Iesu the sonne of god haue mercy on vs let vs crye strongely co~sta~tly euen amydmo~ge the hourlynge multitudes of yl imaginacions he of this worldly beggers shall make vs enheritours of the heuenly kyngdome.
Who so euer seketh co~modites of this life, is bly~d, is a begger, i~ a patched cloke beggeth a halfe pe+ny of the people.
They yt seke to get a kyngdome yea though they seme to go about a great thyng they do els but wretchedly begge a of a multitude.
They yt hunte for honours and dignites be they neuer so great they crie to ye people Take pite, gyue an halfepeny.
But if any wylerie: Iesu lorde haue mercy he is redy to gyue vs hym selfe.
Our lorde tarieth he calleth to hym art nat vnhappy but if yu ru~ne? why tariest in thyne vnhappy clothes? The alter of mercy is open and thou tournest thy selfe to the bondes madnes.
The sainctuary of goddis mercy is opened and thou fliest in to the hurlepyt of vnhappy despeyre.
Thy sauiour recheth the his ha~de and thou turnest away thy face.
Heuen is open vnto the and thou ru~nest downe heedlynge in to helle.
The lappe of goddis goodnes is hold open to the and thou fliest to the vnhappy halter.
The thefe on the crosse hereth This day thou shalte be with me in paradise and thou gyueste and byndest thy selfe to hell.
But now it is tyme to fulfyl that lastely promised by what meanes the mercy of god may be soonest got.
For of prayers wepynge fastyng wearing of heare ashes yt is of a contrite hart is nowe spoke~ here and there through al the sermo~.
And truly these thynges opteyne mercy of god: But well doyng to our neyghbour wresteth it out if may so say.
Suche as euery man wyll haue god be to him let him shewe him selfe suche to his neyghbour.
Luce .vj. Gyue, and to you shalbe gyuen: Forgyue ye shalbe forgyue~: And by what measure ye haue met to your neyghboure by the same god shall met to you.
And call mercy or pite nat only whan vengeance is forgyuen or nede of our neighbur eased, but what so euer good dede is done to our brother with a good my~de.
He that teacheth him that erreth that correcteth the misdoer and other while he that with strokes chastifeth one synnyng, if he do it with a christe~ affectio~, he doth the warke of mercy vpon his neyghbour, he that exhorteth them shrynke from their good purpose that co~fort the wofull that bring the despeyred in to good hope he is merciful toward his neyghbour and eyther he reco~pe~ceth or {pro}uoketh the mercy of god.
And truely it is vnsyttynge the mercy of Christiens to be of lytell price co~mon.
paynym wyl gyue almes to a begger any man wil helpe his fre~de in ieo{per}dy, ye gentiles eke {per}done some offe~ces.
But what our mercy ought to be ye gospel teacheth: Be merciful yt ye may be ye children of your father that is in heuen.
If ye mercy of god toward vs be of ye co~mo~ sort mercy of ye co~mon sort suffiseth vs toward our neighbour.
But if he co~mande his sonne to shyne on good and yll: suffereth so riche hauiour of this worlde to be co~+mune to the wel disposed and wicked if we wyl ap+pere his true childre~ let vs be weldoers nat only towarde our frendes, kyns folke, and that wel deserued it, but also towarde stra~gers, ye to our foes and yt yuell deserued it.
If god for vs idol worship+pers and children of helle gaue his only sonne, semeth it a great thyng if we agayn do good to our ennemy, whiche is our brother, in that he is a rea+sonable creature? And if our rightous lord for our synnes offred vp hym selfe in ye auter of ye trosse semeth it a great thyng if we forgyue our the wro~ge he dyd to vs? Howe dare a synner crye Lorde haue mercy vpon me yt denyeth mercy to his brother? Shal nat he worthily here this of ye gospell: naughty seruant haue forgyue~ the al thy duty oughtest nat thou to haue pite on thy felowe with the? What good turne we do to our neyghbour our lorde suffreth to be ascribed vnto hym whan he hath nede of no ma~: al be it yt god hath fyrst bestowed it al on vs most heapyngly what good so euer to our power we haue bestowed or done to our bretherne yet as though he were bou~de for our good dedes toward our neighbur, he {pro}miseth to yeld vs agayne good mesure with moche e~crease full wel heaped Is it nat good mesure wha~ for herboring a poore man our lorde receiueth the in to the kyngdome of heue~? The best way to waxe riche is to waxe pore by suche liberalite.
The wyse men of this worlde wyl nat suffre their money to rust in their chestis but they leaue it with the bankers that by vsury they may get more to it.
They that wil be riche heuenly goodes they must haue ado with ye most liberal
We call them happy that be ryche and in the gospel the merciful be called happy by+cause they shall opteyne mercy.
He playeth ye vsurer with our lorde sayth he the wyse Hebrew that pitieth ye poure folke he shal quite hym agayne.
And the prophet sayth: Redeme thy synnes with almes dedes: bicause as the prince of thapostles sayth: Charite couereth the multitude of
Like wise he the misticall synger: Happy is that man that piteeth le~deth.
Therfore with god he playeth a poynt of vsury who so euer for the loue of god doth his neyghbour a good turne.
Ye here the exchange ye here the encreasyng ye here the redemyng.
Who so euer hurteth his is in danger of hym that he harmed: Who so euer to his power helpeth his neighour byndeth hym that he doth the good turne to.
Do nat aske ve~geance on hym that offended the, but make excha~ge with god: forgyue thy neyghbour a fewe lyght offences and god of couenant wyll forgyue the al thy~.
Desire no reward agayne of thy neighbour to whom thou dyddest a good turne but aske it of god what so euer thou disposest well he for goodes transitory wyll rewarde the euerlastynge.
There be dyuers sacrifices whiche god is pleased spirituall hy~mes songes prayers watchinges fastinges homely rayment: but no maner sacrifice is more effectuall than mercy toward our brother.
Go saith our lorde and lerne what it is: wyl haue mercy nat sacrifice.
He da~pneth nat sacrifices but he pferreth mercy aboue them al.
The same yt our lorde Iesus wit safeth to teche vs wt his owne mouth in ye gospel he taught lo~ge before by the mouth of Michee ye {pro}phet.
For wha~ our lorde had rebuked the i~uincible obstaclenes of ye people i~ yls ye people being thoughtful by what mean they myght apease god rightously {pro}uoked with so many cursed dedes sayth: What thynge worthy may offre to god? Shal bow my knees to almighty god? What shuld offre to him sa+crifices, and yerelyng calues? May he be pleased with a thousande wethers or many thousandes of fat gottes? Shal gyue my fyrst begotte~ so~ne for myn offe~ce the frute of my wombe for ye synne of my soule? Hitherto speketh ye people that no sacrifice coude of man be offered to purge away synnes yea if aboue many thousa~de wethers he wolde offre vp his fyrst bogotte~ so~ne to him most dere, but the prophet sheweth a more effectuall sacrifice wher with by and by the a~ger of god is apeased.
man wyll shewe what is good and what our lorde wold haue of thou muste do iugement loue mercy thoughtfully walke with thy lord god.
What is to do iugeme~t? to hurt no man, what is to loue mercy to do them good yt deserue it nat. Paule thapostle more ouer addeth somwhat to ye preise of mercy.
If shuld sayth he gyue my body to be burned and haue no charite it auayleth me nothynge.
Abraha~ a great thyng that was redy to offre his only son in sacrafice, that he loued specially but he profreth more if any for ye loue of god deliuereth his owne body to be burned.
And what thynge els is charite towarde our neighbour but mercy? Ther+fore sythe all we continually in all thynges nede ye mercy of god our study ought styl to be howe one of vs may mercifully helpe an other one with an other beary~g ye burthe~s to gether, we may fulfyl ye lawe of Christe that rather requireth mercy than sacrifice and wylleth vs to redeme his mercy with mercy shewed on our neyghbour.
But as my mynde excedyngly reioyseth wha~ cast with my selfe, how great ye mercy of our lord is toward vs and howe redy for vs he wold it shuld be, so an huge great sorowe {per}ceth myn harte as ofte as behold inwardly how scant the mindy~g of mercy is amo~ge Christiens.
If we were truly mercifull our liberalite wold reche euen to the Turkes we shuld cast coles of fyre vpo~ theyr heedes, that they ouercome by our goodnes at last shulde come to ye felowship of our religion.
Nowe we Christie~s by warres, roberies, theftes, oppressions, more cruelly greue vexe Christiens than any wyld beast greueth the ennemy therof.
If thou beholde the luker what other thynge do we but one lyue by deuourynge an other after the maner of fyshes? Who is nat redy for smal auaile to begyle his brother whose nede he oughte to succoure.
Nowe by our brothers pouerte we go about to get our aua~tage our brother for faute of meate dyeth, ye more ieo{per}dy se hym in the derer sel to hym in that he nedeth.
Howe vnlowly is our stately fiersenes agaynst our inferiours? how great is the rebellio~ of thinferiours agaynst the superiours how feld or in no place is pure charite? All places be full of braulinges, detractio~s, backebitinges.
And we nat only quite a lytel wrong with great ve~geance but wilfully harme them yt dyd vs no hurte.
And the mean while we mynde nat howe great mercy our lorde hath poured on vs: whiche he wyll calle agayne except we poure it agayne on our neyghbour that we receyued.
If we seke the mercy of god we must seke it truly with al our hert.
She turneth her to vs, if we wil turne to her.
The mer+cy of god came to vs whan the sonne of god descended downe in to erthe: let vs go to her agayne.
Our most mercifull lorde inclineth hym that he may assoyle an aduoutrer let vs agayne lyfte vp our affectio~ to him bowyng to vs.
So phisicions fyrst purge the body that after they may put in better iuces.
So thou synner fyrst cast out of the mynde yll affections that stryue agaynst god: lechery couettousnes riot pride anger.
Whan the co~tynuer in synne besecheth the mercy of god doth he nat as though an e~nemy armed holding his sworde and bucler in his hande wolde desyre peace? He that asketh receyueth he that seketh fyndeth: to hym that knocketh the dore is opened.
If ye aske mercy aske it truly: if ye seke, seke aryght: and if ye knocke at the dore of mercy knocke truly.
Wyll ye haue example of one truely askyng mercy? He the prodigal childe asketh it aright but yt was whan he had lefte ye hogges wha~ he was returned to his father.

Now here ye publica~ yt for the co~science of his syns dare nat lyft vp his eies heue~ward dare nat come nere ye auter but sta~dy~g a far, he knocketh on his brest sayth: Lorde haue mercy on me a synner.

He knocketh with deuoute importunatnes i~ a maner co~pelleth ye mercy of god neuer cessynge to exercise warkes of mercy on his neighbour.
Crie to our lord: haue mercy: but thou wylt be herd se that thou here hym agayne.
Here it thou stoppe thyn eare he wyll nat herethe agayne calling to hym.
He is refreshed in his poure folkes in them he thrysteth hungreth sickeneth in them he is dispised But more vnshamefastly saith he to our lord: Haue mercy vpo~ me, whiche only will nat refreshe his brother but also vexeth hym vndeserued oppresseth ye weake betrayeth the innocent, spoyleth the poure begyleth the harmeles.
Continuynge in dedes he calleth on the mercy of our lorde in veyne.
If they that do nat Christ i~ his me~bres shal here: Go ye cursed folkes in to ye fyre euerlastyng: What shall they here that reuile at mocke beate punyshe sklander slee Christe in his me~bres? If be nat disceyued ther is a se~tence amonge the mymes puplians worthy for a christen ma~: In gyuyng he receyued a benefit yt gaue hym yt was worthy to haue it.
Why styckest at it thou froward ponderer of an others dignite? He gyueth to one worthy of it yt gyueth to the me~bre of Christe: he gyueth to one worthy yt gyueth to his brother.
And so forth he gyueth to one worthy who so euer for Iesus loue gyueth to a poure creature.
If thou seke wynnyng play the vsur with him: if thou drede peyne thou hast wherby thou mayst redeme it.
After sharpe rebuke what sayth our lorde in ye gospel? Yet gyue almes sayth he and se all thinges be clene vnto you.
Whan pest of the see is redy to drenche the thou styckest nat to cast thy marchandise in to the see (be hit neuer so precious) to saue thy life: Whan the vengeance of god hangeth ouer the doth it greue the to dispose a lyttell money on thy neyghbour? What woldest yu leaue vndone if thy house were a But what burnyng is so dredefull as the anger of god? Whan his anger sodaynly flameth vp wylt nat vse the remedy that is shewed to quenche What, wylt thou say? Who sheweth hit? That very good man Sirach: Water sayth he quencheth flamyng fyre and almes dede withstandeth synnes.
Almes dede knoweth nat bosting other wise she loseth her name.
They that gyue almes with a trumpe blowynge before they gyue nat almes but bye glory.
For conclusion almes before god is whan thy lyfte ha~de knoweth nat what thy right hande doth.
Put sayth he thy treasure in the co~mandementes of god and it shall profit the more tha~ gold: close thy almes in ye poure mans hart and it shall delyuer the fro~ all yuell.
Thy treasure is neuer so sure buryed or hydde as in the poure mans hart.
It is far better locked ther in than in thy yron chestis.
Forget that thou hast gyuen: let nat ye poure man knowe if it may be who is ye au+tor of the good dede.
Whan thy nede requireth an intercessor the almes shall nat be du~me but shall opteyne of our lorde that thou yt dyddest succour thy neyghbour in any trouble shalt be delyuered from all yll. Wyll ye here almes dede speakynge? Come ye blessed children of my father, for whan hu~gred ye gaue me meate: Whan thyrsted ye gaue me drynke: whan was naked ye clothed me: whan wa~ted lodgyng ye lodged me: wha~ was sycke ye viseted me: whan was in ye came to me.
They remembre nat theyr benefittes and say: lorde whan dyd we se the wa~+tynge those thynges and succoured the? The other part reherseth theyr vertues and they here: Go ye into euerlastyng fire.
Shal nat almes dede tha~ be here a good spokes woma~, that shal delyuer vs from helle that is from all mischief: and shall ioyne vs to our lord of al goodnes? What resteth now most dere brethern~ but that we must beseche the mercy of our lorde to graunte vs that we may be mercifull to our neyghbour lest if we here let naught by his mercy shall aftward reqre it in vayne but the more we be prouoked by mercy here the more sharpe we shall fynde his iudgeme~t Let mercy towarde our bretherne ouercome in vs wordly affectio~s that in god mercy toward vs maye ouercome iugement.
So hit shall come to passe that we with greable myndes to gether shall synge the mercyes of oure lorde for euer aknowlegynge his mercies aboue all his warkes.
To whom be preise and glory through all costis of the erthe for euer more.

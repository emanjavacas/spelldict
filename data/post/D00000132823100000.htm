a seasonable paper presented to the consideration of all that profess christianity
the bent of my mind being to promote piety and goodness love and unity amongst men tho of different perswasions rather than notions and opinions puts me upon collecting and publishing this following which if duly considered by all sorts of people might much conduce thereto
it is taken out of a book lately printed intituled an address to protestants
the whole is large so have only collected these passages which apprehend will be serviceable to many
where there is this stroke there is something omitted for but the sense not alter'd
my desire is the reader may receive that benefit by it as is intended by his friend



an address to a protestant penn
but before begin says the author desire to premise and can with much sincerity declare that intend not the reproach of any person or party am weary with seeing so much of it in the world for it gains nothing that's worth the keeping but hardens to a desperateness what is our duty to endeavour to soften
page
conscientiously refuse to name parties because am tender of giving the least offence
let all asperities be avoided forbidden

christians ought to be distinguished by their likeness to christ and not their notions of christ by his holy qualifications rather than their own lofty professions and invented formalities
he that keeps the law of god and abstains from the impurity of the world that is the good man the just liver he is the apostle's true jew and circumcision
men that are angry for god passionate for christ that call names for religion and fling stones and persecute for faith may tell us they are christians if they will but no body would know them to be such by their fruits to be sure they are no christians of christ's making

holy living is become no test among us unless against the liver
the tree was once known by its fruits tis not so now the better liver the more dangerous if not a conformist
alas tis for want of considering that men don't see that to disorder the mind in controversy is a greater mischief than to carry the point can be a benefit in that it is not to be religious to apprehend rightly but to do well
the tree was not accounted good or bad by the leaves but the fruits not by the opinions but the holy living

ye shall know them by their fruits saith christ of the pharisees so shall men know them that sincerely believe and confess christ by their sanctified manners and blameless conversations and wo to them that make other distinctions for god hath made no other there will be but goats and sheep at the last day holy and unholy just and unjust
therefore let that be our distinction which ever was and will be god's distinction for all other measures are the effects of the passions and presumptions of men
a man may falsly believe as the true church believes for if believe what she believes only because she believes it and not because am convinced in my own understanding and conscience of the truth of what she believes my faith is false tho hers be true say it is not true to me have no evidence of it
so that believing as the church believes is no more nor less than rooking men of their understandings
beseech rome at home look to the enemies of your own house have a care of this presumption carry it not too high lay not stress where god has laid none neither use his royal stamp to authorize your apprehensions instead of his institutions

but if must abandon my own sense and judgment and yield my self up to the faith and authority of security can have that the man or men whom trust may not err and deceive me and that deceit is irreparable

to be therefore of the church of which christ is head the redeemed regenerated church of christ is quite another thing than to be of any visible society whatever for in all such communions there are but too many that have no true title to christianity

thou hast no dominion over thy brother's faith nor hast thou commission to be lord over his conscience tis christ's right his purchase he might rescue them from the jaws of oppression from those that usurpt their consciences and made a prey of their souls
but why dost thou judg thy brother come let us look at home and view our actions and see if we are not the men
christ teacheth us the duty of prayer where and what not in the corners of the streets nor in the synagogues to be seen of men but in the closet in the secret of the heart betwixt god and the soul epigraph king



he took away the high places and brake the images and cut down the groves and broke in pieces the brasen serpent that moses had made for unto those days the children of israel did burn incense to it and he called it

And then of ones Iudgment that heard of the same.
Heare saie, that some saye, ther chaunsed of late Betwene one madmisrule, goddes word great hate The cause of there out fall (as some saye) is this By here saye, harde it, now marke what it is This misrule, was moued, and madde in his mynde That goddes worde with great men, such grace shuld still finde Wherby as an out caste he myght be reiecte Thys some say, and here saye, to be the effecte.
But douting where all things, whyche some saye were ryght Sith some saye, by here saye, a lye spred be myght sought, and harde some saye, they did it beholde By whose wordes of credit, my doutes were resolued But now to my purpose, agayne for to come This misrule, through madnes, at last frynds had some Of whome he gat comforte, as it maye well seme His boldnes well wayed, who would not so deme.
And beyng in fauor, at laste well was he That could vnto mysrule, from good order flee Who lost not ther labor, as some saye for that But were well estemed, and had, harde what.
That gods worde muche lothing, could it not abyde But stepped fourth boldly, and misrule defied Wyshing from misrule, all men to refrayne As from a thing noysome, to vile, and to vayne.
But misrule that hearyng, beganne for to starte Lyke one that were vexed, and that to the harte As it well aperethe, by his subtil shyft Who so well can ponder, the truth of his dryft.
He knew well, he could not, goddes worde well withstond To mete hym as men do, that fyght hand to hand But sought his fetch farder, by couler to craue And so vnder couler, goddes worde to depraue.
But now if in conscience, speake frely maye In mynde digresse not, from that whyche some saye If mysrule mayntayned be, and seke to ascend In this casse doute muche, but mark well the ende.
â†’What regions to Ruyn, hath there not bene brought Where misrule was chosen, and good rule vnsought Weales publick full welthy, to nought brought it hath For mysrule to myschiefe, must nedes be the path.
What caused gods wrath, all fleshe to distroye Saue onely. viii. parsons, with olde father Noye But for that this misrule, gods worde did deface And moued that all men, misrule shuld imbrace.
In Sodom and Gomor, suche lyke stryffe began Betwene this madde mysrule, and gods worde: but than Could god longe abide it? when he in his fume With sulphire and brimston, mysrule dyd consume.
His owne Iewish people, as ofte as they ranne maddyng with mysrule, wyth plages God beganne To lerne vs that mysrule, he alwayes did hate And yet (alas) se you? how he plaith chek mate.
By misrule the subiectes, be so far past grace Theyr heddes and their rulers, they know not in place But lyke to beastes brutall, with vngodly strife As rebelles resyst wyll, wyth losse of their lyfe What law is so strayt made, they feare not to breake What threat can suche tounges stoppe, they feare not to speake What doctrine can dryue them, to know what they be What myschief may moue them, that onely they se.
What nede mo examples, then this our owne realme To teach vs that mysrule, hath bene to extreame In preasinge so proudly, to noble welfare As some saye, so boldly, as it were Iack hare And so, vnder couler, of space, and beware To taunt at gods prechers, as muche as they dare Sayeng, such passe not, by here saye to go And preach in ther pulpittes, that thus some saye so.
Of some saye, and here say, this well tell canne That here say, and some say, the truth now and than Of such, as both some saye, and here saye, dysdayne Bycause that both here saye, and some saye, so playne.
But be it, that some saye, by here say a misse And saye not (through here say) the truth as it is Doth it therfore folow, for that thinge fourth brought That al thinges whyche some say, therfore shuld be nought.
If it be vnlawfull, by here say to wade meruell what Paull ment, to vse the same trade Who speaking by here say, belyue did the same Which purgeth (as some saye) the rest from all blame.
But gods worde of one thing, hath cause to reioyse For that this sharpe taunting, is but mysrules voyce Who beinge accepted, to muche thus feare Of ryght shuld leaue courtinge, and not remayne there.
But who shall stand douting, when our noble kynge Wyth his faythfull counsaill, perceaue shall the thinge But that they wyll shortly, mysrule so represse That glad shal the good be, to se suche redresse Finis.

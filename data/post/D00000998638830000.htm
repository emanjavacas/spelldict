the answer of judge jenkins to the imputation put upon his plea in chancerie
have no disposition nor ever had to be knowne by any publique writing these miserable times which fill many mens mouths and most mens eares with notorious untruths thereby to blast and destroy the kings sacred majestie his lawes and government and to bring in a confusion enforceth me at this time who formerly have written nothing but for the publique to let the world know how unjustly the pamphleter of this weeke licensed by our reformers hath traduced me touching a suit commenced in their court of chancerie against me by one erneley a wiltshire gentleman touching the estate of one thomas of glamorganshire the truth whereof is as followeth thomas whose father and my grandfather were two brothers about yeares past made his will and declared by the same his son being then of very tender yeares a ward to his majestie and made him his executor and my selfe during his minoritie referring to his wardship to administer his estate personall and testamentary and to be accomptable to his sonne when he came to age and yeares sithence the father dyed

this estate consists in a stock of sheepe so disposed by me as the number are yet continued and for

the number and condition they were at their deliverie back to be made as good by those persons who had the charge of them as they were when they were reced
the rest of the estate for any considerable part was in mortgages of land forseited in the life of my young cousin thomas for many of them and many absolutely purchased by me in his name in his life time for the which am not yet payd
the land discended and ought upon sir edward thomas my cousins heire at common law so that erneley the plaintiffe in chancerie hath no colour for the land for my young cousin dyed without issue about yeares old and could not dispose of the inheritance of any land by any pretended will the stock of sheepe remaines if the plantiffe and the reformers have not plundered them for the money it came all to the court it was to satisfie the king for the marriage
the colour the plaintiffe hath is this after the death of my old kinsman thomas by undue means the young gentleman was married to erneleys daughter in a way of ravishment being both children without one penny paid or consent of friends or kindred for the which a suit of ravishment depended against erneley and others in the court of wards

the young gentleman dyed about yeares of age sithence these confusions without issue and some houre before my young cousins death who dyed of a pestilent feaver erneley pretends a will made by him and that he made his wife erneleys daughter his executrix his said wife dyes

soone after and is pretended to make a nuncupative will and to make her father erneley her executor and so pretends as executor of an executor of an executor which pretended wills he saith he hath proved in the courts of his friends the reformers
whether such wills were made or no must receive an equall examination and of what validitie they are being pretended to be made by children in extremis if made at all and whether an executor of an executor of an executor can maintain an accompt by the law of the land and whether being executor during the minoritie viz the wardship my young cousin could make such a will as is pretended he being no executor till his full age

the age touching wills the law of this land determines to be yeares

and before that age at common law an use could not be devised
for wills touching goods and chattells our law for many ages have left the same to the decision of the civill and canon lawes in the bishops courts that law as iustinian hath it in the second booke of his institutions the twelfth chap is impuberi non licet testari this pubertas begins at it is plena pubertas at yeares of age the question is whether this jus testandi is in pubertate plena or pubertate inceptâ pigots case
part of cookes reports the doctors affirmed that yeares of age was a full age as to an infant executor to dispose of goods this opinion hath bin by others sithence denyed
sir edward cooke part instit sect

saith he must be which is the time of plena pubertas
hen
an infant of yeares of age may be a deisseisour
sir io dodderidge

in his booke called the office and dutie of executors which they say is his and it is a learned and laborious treatise fol
delivers that this opinion of yeares for that abilitie in an infant hath been reported otherwise this latter opinion comes neerer the common law and the statute law of the land which common law and statute law gives infants no power by deed or will to make any disposition of any thing they have before yeares of age
it seems also more reasonable because infants at yeares have by the intendment of law as they grow in yeares more use of reason to discerne what is fit for them to doe and act
and for a meere stranger to sue in a court of conscience who pretends by such wills of infants the infant husband being ravished against the will of the kindred of the deceased who died six yeares sithence without issue being yeares of age and that any part of his estate should goe that way by a course of equitie unlesse the law be for erneley who payd not a penny with his daughter and who would have the husband of his daughter bring him a portion by his pretended title of an executor of an executor of an executor viz of an infant the executor of another infant the executor of a third person seemes very strange
the said licensed historiographer of theirs hath published the of this present moneth of february that out of a desire to keepe the estate have in a suit in the court of wards in my cousins life time pleaded to the jurisdiction of that court
it is true did so for conceived that the estate would be unsafe in erneley's hands and was willing to preserve it till my young cousin came to be of age to dispose of it himselfe according as was trusted

the law being

that the court of wards had no jurisdiction over the personall estate for then the marriage was payd for to the king and all due to the king ascertained
it is true that that was insisted upon as was just for to preserve the estate from erneley who would have made what accompt he pleased to my cousin at his full age and this is the truth of that businesse
that declined not the jurisdiction of the chancerie to keepe an estate in my hand appeares by my declining long sithence the power of the house of commons to examine me and the reformers have all my estate what would erneley have when they the reformers have all alreadie or can have from me if he had any colour desire the good people of this citie to observe what notorious untruths their licensed historiographers publish to delude the people in this particular case they publish first that the suit against me is in the behalfe of an orphan erneley who is plaintiffe in their court is a wiltshire gentleman at least of yeares of age there is their orphan
secondly that made a speech to the people at the hall doore that the questioning of me for what had done for the king was illegall and that the iudges had no power to trie me the king being absent another notorious untruth for protest to god all that said was only this god preserve the king and the lawes
thirdly it is said that comming to the barre stirred not my hat all the lawyers then at the barre were uncovered wherefore held it a civilitie to be also uncovered and so was as they all know

fourthly that the earle of manchester should say received a great estate in money of the orphans estate as there is no truth in it so it is most untrue that the said lord said so as all men present can testifie
the truth is they care not what they doe what they say what they sweare nor what they write witnesse their declaration of a prevailing partie of the house of commons of the of this instant february who contrarie to the oath of allegiance the oath of supremacie the protestation their solemne league and covenant their declarations to make his majestie a glorious king fearefull to his enemies and beloved of his subjects and yet now after yeares they would insinuate to the people that this king whom they have so much magnified hath poysoned his owne father

fifthly it is a publike notorious untruth· that the parliament hath published a declaration against the king of the of this instant february whereas it is well knowne to be the declaration of the prevailing partie of the house of commons onely without the lords and so they would make that prevailing partie onely to be the

parliament
let the people of england believe their five sences how it was with them seven yeares agoe and before during his majesties reigne how this kingdome abounded then with peace plentie and glory to the admiration and envie of other nations and now let them consider and judge by their sences sithence those men whom nothing would satisfie but all power both by sea and land which in truth is the regalitie and kingship and which they call the militia have usurped the said power regall whether they have not by impostures and delusions diffused among the people by themselves and their agents brought a flourishing kingdome to the most deplorable condition it now is in
to the end that this kingdome may not utterly be ruined god incline their hearts to restore his majestie and for their owne and their posterities sake to receive from his majestie an act of oblivion a generall pardon assurance for the arreres of the souldierie and meet satisfaction for tender consciences

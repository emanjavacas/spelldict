seder olam or the order series or succession of all the ages periods and times of the whole world is theologically philosophically and chronologically explicated and stated
also the hypothesis of the and revolution of humane souls
together with the thousand years reign of christ on the earth probably evinced and de+liver'd in an historical enarration thereof according to the holy scriptures
to which is also annexed some explanatory questions of the book of the revelations of the like import
and an appendix containing some emendations and explanations of divers passages in the two treatises out of the author's original manuscripts and papers
translated out of latin by clark upon the leave of baron of helmont
london printed for sarah howkins in georgeyard street

to the english reader

serious and inquisitive reader

for thy sake was this small tract translated into the english tongue by the consent of the baron of helmont now resident at london wherein have rather affected a plain english stile than any artificial embellishment left should make it less intelligible by to render it more and so rob the author to divert the reader which is to betray vnderstanding to gratifie the
and now reader as to the sure am of opinion if be any such thing as reveal'd in the world as none will deny the only sure to prove it is by reconciling

faith with reason for tho the subtilties of faith may soar above the perfect comprehension of reason yet no true faith can be so absolute as to appear wholly inconsistent with it as is manifest in the example of christ's incarnation where faith perswades me of this miraculous vnion and reason me the necessity of it
here is the conformity of faith with reason and no hypothesis more effectually proves the veracity of scripture against objections of atheists than that which perfectly demonstrates harmonious congruity and of those truths but all the vulgar positors have hitherto been so far om reconciling the scriptures that they have made appear a mass of contradictions and mightily strengthened the principles atheists



seder olam or the order of ages

as much as god is but one the terms three persons are very improperly apply'd to the mystery of the father word and holy ghost
it were better to stick to the words of holy writ in the explication of so great a mystery
herein may be safe and this would remove a scandal from such who are offended at the names of three persons

because god doth all things according to his infinite wisdom therefore there is no indifference of will in him and therefore in all things he doth he is a necessary agent and yet also the most agent


therefore he did create worlds and that not by constraint

from any foreign agent but from the determination of his internal goodness and wisdom


the attribute of creator is essential to god because in god there are no
therefore god is a om and so by consequence did make ages and also doth and will new to all
the worlds therefore in respect of us are infinite and innumerable

but among other differences there is this special difference between god and creatures that god is altogether but all creatures are in some sense or other changeable

but there is a distinction in the mutability of creatures for creatures are either changeable to good or evil which indeed for some time is the and condition of all creatures or el at length after a certain space of time only changeable unto good

which mutability of creatures remains unto all eternity for there is no creature so perfectly good but that it is ill capable of a greater degree and of goodness to all eternity


moreover there is necessarily intercedent between god and creatures a certain middle being which indeed is less than the supream deity but greater and more perfect than all creatures


and this ens medium or middle being between god and creatures is christ the heavenly adam

god by this medium to wit christ and produced all creatures
again among other differences there is this between christ and that all creatures are for some time unto good and evil but christ is only changeable unto good but never unto evil

and more justly merits the name of son of god than that of a creature and his production is rather to be accounted a generation than creation

christ the heavenly adam is both god and man containing in him both natures viz the nature of god and man

for whereas the most divine humanity of christ is and most perfectly united with the word of god which is god therefore this heavenly man and divine jesus christ is truly god


but the divine and humane natures in christ must not be confounded but plainly distinguished so that the humanity is never changed into the deity nor the deity into the humanity


so great is the excellence of christ beyond all creatures that there are certain divine attributes allowed him which are communicable to no creatures to wit and omniscience

which attributes of and omniscience of the man christ are nevertheless inferiour to those which appertain unto god

for god is so present in all things that he is every where centraly existent but the divine humanity of christ hath not its center every where present but is universally extended by the essential radiations from the center of his most divine soul into all creatures and worlds


lastly the omniscience of christ's humanity is inferiour to that which appertains to the deity for as the most glorious godhead most perfectly knows all things without the concurrence of objects as instrumental causes to up knowlege in the divine soul of the man christ jesus knows all things either by the perception of objects as they do

some way or other influence him or in respect of things to come are signified to him by divine revelation from god the father


because christ jesus the heavenly man is the first begotten son of the most excellent and supream god himself and by reason of his miraculous union with the supream deity is very god equal with god the father and also because he is most loving to all mankind every where present and all knowing and so can and will help all men in any necessity or distress whatsoever therefore is deservedly to be call'd upon worshipped and adored and we cannot any other way duly and acceptably call upon worship or adore the supream god himself but in and through christ the mediator


that there is such a medium or middle being between god and creatures the very order of things clearly demonstrates
for as it agrees with the highest and supream god to be a being altogether unchangeable so is it congruous to the nature of every creature or created being to be changeable to good or evil but between that which is wholly unchangeable and that which is wholly changeable there is a certain medium partaking of both

extreams which in the nature of it is unchangeable to evil and changeable to good which medium is christ the heavenly adam


and in the order of nature is before all creatures whatsoever and the whole of creatures yea is the lord and head of every


moreover the fulness of the godhead dwells bodily in this most divine jesus christ according to the testimony of the apostle paul which is thus to be that the divine of is the house and immediate of the most high and glorious god himself and is as it were a certain body for the divinity in the which god himself be seen and apprehended by his creatures and by the mediation of this beloved and blessed consort of god when duly and thereunto they may enjoy him
it is that according to the words of christ himself his saints and true believers feed upon his flesh and blood to eternal life
vvhich flesh and blood of christ are of a divine and spiritual nature and yet not very essence of god but of a certain middle nature between god and creatures

for god doth as it were corporally manifest himself to his creatures by christ who nevertheless in his own nature is purely a spirit absolutely void of all

now because the divine of christ is as it were the body and house of the divinity for the greek word undefined span alphabet as it were undefined span alphabet as much therefore christ doth in some measure the nature of a body otherwise he could not be the true and proper medium between god and creatures

for all creatures even the most noble and excellent are in some or other corporeal

therefore spirit and body are not contrary essences as many do vainly and affirm for every created spirit is having in it the true and nature of a body viz it is an extended being bounded circumscrib'd with place moveable
and therefore a humane soul which is also a spirit is corporeal and comprehends in it the true nature and essence of a body
the most pure and spiritual angels also are corporeal and it were spiritual bodies


for as every spirit or soul in the whole creatural system is a body having in it the true essence and attributes of a body so every body is in some degree or animal and spiritual hath life sense and knowledge or at leastwise capable of those


nor is it to be feared that the souls of men could ever become mortal or be turned into dust vapour or soft air or dissolved into earth and stones if they were admitted to be corporeal for not every thing that is corporeal or body is dissolvable because it is a body for there are immortal bodies and such as are absolutely and indissolvable such are the glorified bodies of saints and believers in the resurrection of the dead when this shall put on immortality and this corruptible incorruption according to the apostle


seeing therefore every spiritual thing is corporeal and every corporeal thing is spiritual in some degree or measure therefore all creatures from the highest to the lowest have some relation and natural one to another the highest to lowest and the lowest to the highest certainly as to their original essence and condition they are of one and the self same nature nor is there any even the basest creature but may be

changed either into the noblest or at least into some part of the noblest creature


therefore that false and vain imagination of sundry philosophers so called concerning matter and body is to be rejected as tho it were a thing not only wholly inanimate and void of life but also utterly incapable thereof to all eternity
vvhich most absurd opinion borders too much on atheism and most grievously strikes at the divine goodness wisdom and power and other attributes of the most excellent and supream god

for from god who is life himself and the fountain of it nothing that hath not life or is uncapable thereof can proceed for god created all his creatures in his most excelling goodness wisdom and power that in him they might at length blessed rejoyce in him and him and that in him as their end they might most sweetly rest and so praise honour and glorifie him as god their creator to all eternity which they could never do if they void of life and uncapable of it


in the primitive state of created things the most excellent and most wise creator made or produced a kind of intermediate or middle creatures with a possibility in this their mediate and of its own nature changeable state and condition

of being changed into the better by the assisting grace of god or into the worse by the byass of their own proper wills and inclinations


therefore god's first work about creatures is to create them then being created to fashion them after this or that manner either into the better if they follow faithfully in all thin the conduct of divine grace or into the worse by the most just judgment of god if refusing the guidance of divine grace they wilfully and voluntarily renounce the law of god

hence proceeds that diverse and contrary state and condition of most creatures one from another for whereas sundry creatures kept their primitive integrity and innocence nor did ever transgress the divine law therefore are they blessed and still enjoy the beatifick vision and communion with god they are also pure holy and immaculate full of light and divine life and shine in that glory and beauty which to us mortals is certainly incomprehensible
but because many others fell from their primitive purity by transgression and disobedience of the divine law therefore are they miserable polluted with sin sullied and darkened


and hence it is that from this world of creation other worlds also burst out to wit the world of formation as well the superiour as inferiour that of souls who never fell whose seat and region is the caelestial paradise this of fallen souls and after a certain manner polluted with sin whose seat region is without that blessed place of paradise in places and parts of the world invisible to our outward view


lastly from the inferiour world of formation proceeded this world of fabrication wherein we live comprehending within it all visible things from the stars even to the earths profundity which is therefore called the of fabrication because death and stupidity so in the most parts of it that all things in this world seem rather to move in a manner mechanically than from a vital principle which nevertheless is to be understood in comparison to the superiour worlds where indeed the vital principle is far more predominant than in this inferiour world nor is this inferiour world in any even the most stupid part of it wholly and in every degree deprived of life


nothing which belongs to this world is immediately created this world is not properly a created

world but made and composed of principles which principles belong to the world of formation and the world of formation owes its original to the principles of the world of creation the world of creation only is properly and strictly created and its production is properly called creation for this doth not exist from any principles or from a subject or parts making a whole but has only god the father and his only begotten son for its author and original


therefore men born into this world to speak properly are not immediately created neither in respect of soul nor body the external or oward body with the life thereof is that which belongs to this world of fabricaon but the soul which is called neshama pertains to the world of creation
lastly the spirit pertains to the world of formation which possesseth the middle place between the soul and outward body and this spirit by the hebrews is called but the life and spirits of the external body are termed by the same are therefore three vital principles in every man ruach and neshama of the world of creation ruach of the world of formation and of

the world of fabrication moreover nephesh is the cloathing or vehicle of the undefined span alphabet ruach and ruach is the vehicle and garment of the undefined span alphabet neshama


first of all therefore men are created in the world of creation secondly formed in the world of formation where they assume their cloathing or vehicle which is called ruach and this ruach is a certain subtile and spiritual body of which sort are the bodies of angels and just made perfect thirdly they are made or fabricated in the world of fabrication and all this is expresly confirmed by testimony of the scripture it self isai
every one that is called in my name have created formed and made and consequently according to these words of scripture the hebrews call the world of creation briah the world of formation iezirah and the world of fabrication asiah which three hebrew words are expresly to be met with in the place of scripture above cited


moreover besides this world briah higher than which our original doth not reach if we have respect to the parts composing humane nature there is understood another world more noble and in the order of nature more antient than the rest immediately from the

author god himself called in hebrew aziluth which signifies the nearest to the most high and supreme god himself and this cannot agree to any other than christ the saviour and mediator god and men


therefore those hebrew doctors do rightly and truly teach and that altogether according to scripture testimony that those four worlds do exist to wit the aziluthick which is of christ the briatick which is of souls the ieziratick which is of angels not yet consummated and the asiatick which is of men cloathed with an external body
but as the as it is the noblest of all so it is the greatest and but only one altho the hebrews distinguish it into ten emanations the distinction of which emanation nevertheless is only modal and not essential
but the briatick ieziriatick and asiatick worlds to their number and multitude in respect of us are infinite and innumerable because as have said before god is continually a creator for the attribute of a creator is essential to him and therefore he doth will continually create new worlds to all eternity
and lastly from these new created worlds other new ieziratick and asiatick worlds arise and therefore twas

truly said of solomon we cannot search out the beginning nor the end of god's works as true also was that saying in another passage
the mighty works of god are past finding out


now the ieziratick world from whence as from its root the asiatick world proceeded penetrates and pervades the whole asiatick world in every part with its vital and essential rays also the briatick world by the difusion of its vital and essential rays penetrates the whole ieziratick and asiatick world and lastly the azilutick world not only penetrates and pervades the three inferiour worlds by the transfusion of its essential and vital rays but also most intrinsecally comprehends and embraces it in its bosom as a mother doth her and so indeed all these four worlds are intrinsically present one with another yet so that the is more subtile and spiritual than the the second than the third and the than the second and consequently more penetrative and


from what has been said it evidently appears that humane souls did before they came into these gross and earthly bodies for nothing which is properly created is of this visible but the soul

is properly therefore the soul had not its original or first in this visible world but it first existed in the world of creation then descended from the world of creation into the world of formation and lastly from the world of formation into this world of fabrication


but as for this asiatick world this hath its rise and original from the ieziratick world by reason of some great falls of the souls contained therein for transgressing the law of god and if these souls had fell this asiatick vvorld which is the vvorld of fabrication had never existed

nevertheless the souls of the ieziratick vvorld are not changed into the parts of the asiatick vvorld that is to say into the dust of the earth stones plants and trees for such a change of souls is plainly impossible but the bodies of those souls distinct the souls themselves and by the sins of those souls separated from them as by a certain kind of death were subjected to such a change or conversion into the parts of the asiatick vvorld


this asiatick vvorld is truly call'd golgotha or the place of sculls and to wit because it is nothing else

in a manner but a certain mass and heap of carcasses and dead bodies which those souls have put off by reason of their sins in the ieziratick world and being thus devested they at length grew into this grosness death and stupidity which they now suffer


and therefore our saviour and redeemer jesus christ after he came into the flesh in the likeness of sinful flesh was to be in golgotha which is the place of scu or sepulchres by which is typically signif this asiatick vvorld or vvorld of that so in this place of death he death it self who is our saviour and prince of life yea life it self which that he might do by the ordination of divine vvisdom he was to die in a body of flesh and then to rise again in the same body in which he died that he might become the first fruits of the resurrtion of the dead and his being glorified and immortalized might at length and immortalize the bodies of saints in which bodies they shall live and reign with for ever in the heavens


therefore this asiatick vvorld is to be again converted and reduced into the superiour and excellent ieziratick vvorld that all its parts may be to these

antient souls whereunto in times past they belonged that so at length the souls and bodies may be purified in this vvorld from all dreggs of sin and death as in a refining furnace of affliction and suffering and lastly eternally glorified in a indissolvable incorruptible union of both body and soul


and then indeed the natural and animal body will be changed into a spiritual body which is far nobler yea all this gross and material vvorld where death and stupidity so wonderfully reigns will be rendred full of life and spirit

and yet this great and truly wonderful change and conversion of all even the vilest things of this asiatick vvorld may not be suddenly and altogether but by parts and in various successions of ages according to the predestination of divine
therefore the ages of vvorlds respect of human intellect are truly infinite and innumerable and that not only in regard of things to come but in regard of things past

moreover this asiatick vvorld hath had its existence many more ages than we mortals are able to number


therefore this asiatick vvorld wherein we live must be distinguished into many

and various vvorlds as a whole is distinguished into its parts beyond the reach of mortals understanding


but those particular asiatick vvorlds are most commodiously distinguished in respect of the years whereof they consist

now every particular asiatick world consists of seven thousand years which make up as it were one week consisting of seven days

for a thousand years with the lord are as one day and one day as a thousand years as it is in the
psalm and confirmed by the apostle peter in hls second epistle ver

and the seventh millenium or seventh thousandth year of each vveek of the world is the sabbath of this vvorld

therefore this world of ours consists of seven thousand years whose seventh millenium is the sabbath or sabbatism of this our present world as it is in heb

and indeed that sabbath of days which god commanded the iews to observe was a type or figure of this mystery the same also was that of the sabbath of years months and vveeks which in times past god likewise command the iews to observe


now whereas every fiftieth year comprehending seven weeks of years was a year of iubilee wherein every captive was to be set at liberty and every one to return to his own family house and posseson this certainly signifies fifty thousand years which contain seven weeks of worlds therefore in the fifty thousand year or end of every seventh world many souls are to be saved and reconciled to god by christ which as yet could not obtain salvation in the preceding weeks or vvorlds but suffered for their impieties by the most just judgmnet of god the execrable torments of hell fire


others there are sins god doth pardon in this world for the sake of christ such as are sins of ignorance and all others of which men sincerely repent but there are some whose sins are forgiven in this world nor in that which is to come and yet are forgiven in some third world and lastly there are others which are not till the and so on even to a seventh according to the most just judgment god nay far beyond a seventh even to the seventy seventh thousand year the remission of very notorious and wicked sins seems to be deferred that not less than eleven

weeks and such a kind of a sinner that wicked lamech seemed to be who predicted of himself his to wives that vengeance should be taken on him seventy seven fold that is as it seems years
but on cain who was not so wicked vengeance was to be taken but seventy fold which is years to wit the whole time of this world


then if one day with the lord be as a thousand years by the same reason one year i.e days will be as years which period of years to be some vast age comprehending about worlds within which space of time whatsoever is of humane kind on earth will doubtless be converted unto god
nevertheless the asiatick vvorld doth not cease to be upon this account because the parts of the asiatick world are continually multiplied by reason of the continual multiplication of other vvorlds to wit the ieziratick and briatick whereof we have already made mention


therefore they err extreamly and conceive too unworthily of god yea do not know nor consider the of him who think the punishments the damned are to be perpetrated to all eternity without any end or termination
for the

very nature of god is love it self according to the express words of the apostle iohn and finally because the nature of god is unchangeable therefore he did necessarily love all his creatures and that constantly and unchangeably too nor could he absolutely hate any thing that ever he created and because love is of the nature of god himself and whatever he operates or doth in relation to his creatures even when he most severely punishes them for their sins proceeds all from love therefore god loves his creatures in the most miserable and wretched state and condition they can exist in and therefore cannot but benefit them and so at length bring them out of misery therefore all the punishments which the most just and truly tremenduous justice of god inflicts on sinners are effects and real tokens of his divine love towards them the most certain end and design of all which is the redemption and deliverance of those sinners all their sins and punishments inflicted on them for sin and their final glorification and restoration to justice and which is apparently confirmed by st iohn in the revelations ch

who saith that he saw in his prophetical vision every creature in and earth and under the

earth praising god saying blessing honour and glory and power to that sits on the throne and to the lamb for ever and ever the same also the apostle paul openly enough declares eph
phil

colos



now forasmuch as any human judge punishes a delinquent he ought to love him and direct his punishments to this end that the punished may be benefitted and bettered thereby how much rather will god love those he punishes and such on every offender by which at length in their due and appointed according to the transcendant vvisdom of god every sinner may return from a state of sin and misery unto a of righteousness and everlasting happiness


nor doth that hinder which is objected that every sin deserves an exceeding great and everlasting punishment because it is against god who is infinite goodness for because god is infinite therefore god's vvill to forgive sins is as necessary as his vvill to punish it
again this clearly appears well from scripture as from experience and that god does not punish the smallest and greatest sins in the same

degree but is wont to punish the lesser sins lighter and the greater with the more grievous and heavy judgments therefore that consequence drawn from the infiniteness and greatness of the object is invali'd for otherwise a would be punished for the lightest and smallest transgression with the highest and infinite punishment


because therefore there are degrees of punishments according to the degrees of sins and no sin is in its own nature infinite therefore all the punishments of the damned as well of fallen angels as of will have an end after long tracts of time according to god's appointment

the longer any one hath been a sinner the longer will god punish him for his sins


the of punishments is manifestly apparent from the words of christ some sinners says he are worthy to punished by the council some are worthy of judgment others of hell fire
and then again some sins are remitted in this vvorld others neither in this vvorld nor that which is to come which neverthels may be forgiven in some third or
these words of

also ought to be conered that those that were cast into prison should not depart thence till they had paid the last lastly where he says it shall be more tollerable for sodom and gomorrha in the day of judgment than for that unbelieving generation of the iews
moreover such as are to be saved in the end of this world and such as are not to be saved till the end of the next that is till expiration of fourteen thousand years seem to be tho aenigmatically describ'd exod
for the woman that brought forth a male child was unclean seven days and on the eighth day the male was circumcised this eighth day plainly the of the mortal bodies at the expiration of years that is in the beginning of the eighth millenium
but if she brought forth a female child she was unclean days by the male our spiritual generation by christ seems to be signified by but female man's own
for those who are only righteous by own righteousness cannot be saved in this world but are committed to the next that denying their righteousness be in christ and thus having put on the te righteousness christ in a finally obtained salvation


but the words for ever and for ever and ever when they have a relation to the punishments of the damned are not to be understood at than of certain ages


but when they have relation to god and the blessed life of saints then indeed to signifie never ceasing and ages for to punish for ages is against the nature of god who is infinite love and to do good for infinite ages is most agreeable to the divine nature


the plurality of worlds succeeding one another ems to be by the of the children of israel in the till they came at last to gilgal where by the command of ioshua they were now seems a wheel or and because all things happen'd to them in the type and figure as st paul had airmed those peregrinations seem to signifie six worlds that is years expired all of them will obtain the glorification of their souls and bodies in the what can their coming to the twelve fountains of water and seventy branches of palm trees in pilgrimage signifie unless it be this that in the fifth millenium of this world the most benign and gracious god would send them the

apostles and seventy disciples for them to hear and this place of pilgrimage was called elim


moreover this succession of worlds is clearly proved from what we read in scripture of a thousand yea of thousands of generations and yet from the beginning of this vvorld to the end thereof consisting of years there cannot be rekoned

therefore after the end of this vvorld another vvorld will be prepared wherein the multiplication and propagation of mankind will and be carried on as in this present vvorld and therefore also before this vvorld there did another vvorld heretofore exist in which the propagation of mankind was made by successive generations
but the number of all the preceeding and succeeding vvorlds is not only undeterminable by any mortal but by any creature


as out of the conagration of this vvorld another vvorld will arise which will be produced as it were out of the ashes of this present vvorld out of the ashes of the past vvorld the burning and conflagration of it is this vvorld framed and brought forth it were de novo or a new and so indeed the generation and fabrication

of one follows the destruction and dissolution of another in a continual order


but as to what pertains to the creation of this vvorld described by moses in this certainly is not creation in a strict sense but construction fabrication or faction which is made of matter therefore they err extreamly who think this vvorld was made of nothing and that too in the of six days for god the great contriver and artificer did not make or frame it out of nothing but out of the matter of the preceding vvorld which fabrication or structure of this world in the space of six days may be well enough understood in a litteral sense

they who have attained to the glorification of their bodies in the end of this vvorld do not descend vvorlds to be born any more in a body of flesh but remain to all eternity with god and christ in the heavens ascending continually unto greater glory and dignity but those who are not in vvorld nor have attained the of their bodies do descend into cceeding to be bo in their and turn in a body of flesh until they at pfected and have obtained the of their bodies in the hea


and it is worth our consideration diligent enquiry whether or no from proportion of the holy city compared into the whole earth may not be and as it were abstrusely represented us how great a part of mankind of this world shall be saved in this world first let us see what is the measure of holy city in its solid content
iohn in the revelations saith this city was equal in length breadth and depth that it was stadia or furlongs in length that of our miles for eight furlongs make a mile therefore the content of the city is miles as in the math but as for the of the earth we will suppose miles for every degree which is one mile above the vulgar computation and then the will contain miles but the diametre will contain miles whereof is
to find the superficial content multiply the circumference by the diametre that is by the whole sum is miles lastly

multiply the aforesaid number by of the diametre and the product will be as in the margin miles the content of the earth which if you divide by the solid content of the holy city the quotient will be with the remaining fraction as in the margin
therefore math

after this rate the holy city will be in proportion to the whole earth as to and thence will arise that great year of years wherein all the souls on this earth are to be saved for if the part of mankind be saved in one world then in worlds or weeks of worlds that is years all mankind will be saved


tis likewise to be considered whether or no that slow motion of the eighth sphere as tis commonly call'd doth not answer to the great year of iubilee of years that is seven worlds or weeks
ex gr
let us suppose this sphere to finish its revolution in years one degree of the said sphere will make years which doth not much differ from the vulgar computation of mathematicians

therefore for the clear understanding of many mysteries of true philosophy we must have a true and exact chronology or computation of times from the beginning of this world to the end thereof


the true chronology from the beginning of the world to the end of it is to be in and deduced from the scriptures for to what purpose are parts

of chronology exhibited to men in scripture with such care industry and diligence of writers unless all the parts of it were exhibited also for if the scripture fails in any part of chronology it fails in all and if it fails in all tis vain and unprofitable to exhibite any part which is absurd and therefore all parts of chronology are to be had in the scripture otherwise the scripture were certainly very imperfect but the scripture is perfect giving a perfect testimony not only of the doctrines of true religion but of all the parts of true chronology without which the doctrine of true religion is maimed and imperfect


now the true chronology of the world as it is in scripture contains from the worlds creation to the of our saviour christ years
from the crucifixion of christ to the of the world years which in intire years from the of the world to the end thereof is


and that our saviour christ was to be crucified and raised from death to life in the end of the fourth millenium from the world's creation may be clearly evinced for divers reasons

the analogy of the six days of the worlds fabrication

or construction of the years of this world for the first day by a wonderful analogy agrees with the first millenium the second with the second the third the third the fourth with the fourth the with the fifth the sixth with the sixth and the seventh with the seventh millenium which also is the of this world that the sun moon and stars were placed in the firmament on the fourth day
this most excellently and clearly points out that christ the son of justice should come in the fourth millenium and into the heavens to enlighten all men
lastly by the moon and stars the church with the apostles and evangelists clearly demonstrated

the entrance of the high priest in the sanctum sanctorum or holiest of all once a year to expiate the sins of all the people in the end of the month apparently signifies that christ by vertue of his blood should enr into heaven it self in the end of the millenium of the world which agrees to the end of the seventh month to wit the
day of the seventh month which was the last day of the feast of the tabernacles for by the rule of three as years is to so is days to days and in days

are contained the days of six months from the vernal aequinox to the
day of the seventh month that is and which together make up
this is confirmed by the division of time from the beginning of the world to the resurrection of christ delivered in the second book of esdras ch
and this division is made into twelve parts where of ten and an half were elapsed when the angel delivered those things to the prophet esdras which division also christ made into twelve hours and called the time of his incarnation the twelfth hour saying to the iews are there not twelve hours in the day work whilst you have the day clearly hinting that that very time was the twelfth hour from the worlds creation
now how many years one hour of the day or night doth consist of may be positively concluded from that mysterious psalm the ver the
a thousand years are in thy sight but as yesterday and as a watch in the night but a watch of the night contains three hours therefore if a thousand years be as a watch of the night or three hours one hour will be the third part of a thousand years that is years and christ arose from the dead in the end of the twelfth hour which answers to years

from the beginning of the for multiplied by gives the number
and certainly no other division can agree with the time of esdras but this division doth very well agree with it when the angel revealed those things unto him for ten parts and an half make the time of the angels discovery viz years before the death of christ and years after the
and that place in the second book of esdras ch

concerning years from that time to the death of christ ought to be read
for without all peradventure by the mistake and inadvertency of writers was put for

and lastly the thing is very elegantly demonstrated from the age of abraham and the age of the world for abraham whom st paul in his epistle to the romans calls the father of all men mystically represents the whole world and therefore by abraham son isaac whom he had born to him in his old age our saviour christ is signified who took upon him the seed of abraham who should come into the world be crucified and arise from the dead in the old age of the world and for the clear demonstration of the said analogy let the numbers be disposed in

their due order this manner as abraham whole age is when isaac was born so is to which numbers stand in a true and accurate analogy as will appear to any one that will but examine it by the rule of three
but the nativity of christ mystically under isaac rather to his resurrection from the dead than to the time that he was born of the virgin mary in the flesh for ul applys the resurrection of christ to the words of the second psalm
thou art my son this day begotten thee and christ is called by the apostle paul the first begotten in respect of his from the dead acts


also the analogy evidently demonstrates to us the number of from the beginning of the captivity the resurrection of christ the of ishmael answers to the beginning for when isaac was born ishmael was compleatly four years old born in the
year of abraham age therefore we may say by the rule of three as is to so is to a fourth proportional and then indeed was ishmael mystically born to wit from the beginning of the captivity
and this ishmael mystically the themselves who mocked

and christ as ishmael in times past isaac
now ismael persecuted isaac when he was years old and therefore was with his mother cast out of abraham house under the old law which exactly answers the time wherein the iews persecuted christ hung him on a cross and mocked him wherefore they were together with their mother to wit the law or old testament cast out of the house of god that is years being elapsed which is years from the beginning of the captivity for as years do analogically signifie years so do years also signifie years which are years of captivity and the weeks of to wit years
and here indeed make up those generations from the babylonian captivity to the resurrection of christ for these generations agree with the years of when he derided and scoffed at the true and yet in
matthew genealogy of christ there are but generations from the captivity to the birth of christ therefore the fourteenth generation is to be computed from the birth of christ to his resurrection
and agreeable to this analogy the whole time of the giving the law to the time of the captivity is described by

the age of hagar the mother of ishmael and whereas the law was deliver'd to the israelites about before the babylonian captivity all that time of signifies the age of hagar when ishmael was born which according to the aforesaid analogy is for as years answers to so answers to
therefore the damsel hagar brought forth ishmael when she was old that is the law being ye old brought forth ishmaelitish iews which because of their ishmaelitish natures were delivered into captivity who about ye afterwards persecuted christ unto death even the death of the cross but because christ suffered death in the middle of the last week therefore years are to be deducted out of the number and therefore there remains years to wit the true time from the beginning of the captivity to the death and resurrection of christ and from the beginning of the world years


now it that we deliver a particular chronology of every period from the scriptures

and we shall find six periods from the creation of adam to the resurrection of christ namely

years
from adam to the flood from to the birth of abraham

from thence to the israelites departure out of egypt

from thence to the building of the temple from thence to the babylonian captivity from thence to the death and resurrection of christ




the truth of these periods is demonstrable by parts
the first period consists from gen the
which computation is not disputed by chronologers math the second period of is proved from genesis the

sem begat arphaxad after the flood years
arphaxad begat cainan years
cainan begat sala years
sala begat heber years
heber begat peleg years
peleg begat reu years
reu begat sarug years
sarug begat nahor years
nahor begat terah years
terah begat abraham years



note that by negle cainan is omitted in the xt who notwithstanding is mention'd in luke ch
and also by the interpreters and in right we conclude his number to be to wit that the whole period from the creation of adam to the death of christ is years and an half as is already prov'd
consider lastly that we rationally affirm that abraham was born in the
year of age as appears from gen
for when abraham was years old terah departed this life aged years
and that the third period consists of years is proved for when abraham receid the promise he was aged years years years
after this the law was given

gen
in the same year the israelites departed out of egypt

the fourth period expresly contains years king



the period stands thus in years

king

solomon reigned after the foundation of the temple was laid years
king

rehoboam reigned years
king

abijam years
king
asa reigned years
king

iosaphat reigned years
king

iehoram reigned years
king

achazia reigned years
king

athalia reigned years
king

ioas reigned years
king

amazias reigned years
king
azarias reigned years
king

ioathan reigned years
king

achaz reigned years
king

ezechias reigned years
king

manasses reigned years
king

amon reigned years
king

iosias reigned years
king

ioathas reigned years
king

years
kin
reigned mon
years



note also that the captivity must be reckoned years from zehojathin but not from zedekia as appears from the epistle of ch
but if according to others the captivity of years be computed from the third year of the reign of ioachim according to that of dan

the fifth period from the foundation of the temple unto the babylonian captivity will contain only and therefore that the number of years from the creation of the world to the captivity may be there must be years added to cainan in the second period so that tis all one whether the captivity be reckon'd from the third year of ioachims reign or after the eleventh

lastly tis to be observ'd that the truth of this period is proved from the fourth chapter of ezekiel for those days signifie years from the time ieroboam erected the golden calf to the destruction ierusalem therefore years of solomon reign are deducted and two of rehoboam reign math

to which years of zedekia reign unto the destruction of ierusalem being added the whole amounts to the number of years

lastly the sixth period of years and an half is proved for the captivity lasted years and from the end of years viz of daniel weeks years and an half being deducted there are to be accounted

years when cyrus publish'd an edict for the rebuilding of the temple

observe how exceedingly they wander from the truth who contend that the weeks of daniel are not to be reckon'd from the edict of cyrus and suppose the beginning of the said weeks to be long since cyrus time forsaking the truth of scripture and giving credit to heathenish historians and so indeed they abandon the holy scripture as tho it were a maim'd and imperfect thing which true christians and such as are studious of the scripture should not do
admit it be according to them who follow the historical falshood of the heathens that daniel weeks were long cyrus that is as they will have it years after the end

of the captivity to wit by their computation in the second year of darius longimanus after this rate there will be years from the end of the babylonian captivity to the death of christ but this doth in a wonderful manner contradict esdras in that he saith ten parts and of the world are elapsed from the creation to the death and resurrection of christ
for suppose that there were years and of from adam to the death of christ all the twelve parts taken together would make up years which far exceeds the years feigned by the followers of the heathenish history


now from the foremention'd chronology the years from the beginning of the world to the babylonian captivity are as it is inserted in the margin to which if be added those years which the angel spoke of to daniel
dan

signified by days make up the number of years which being the sanctuary shall be purged that is that happy millenium of the sabbath shall begin and then adding to it the aforesaid millenium and years more thereof comes the sum of years

which makes up the intire age of the whole world from the creation of adam to the end

now the said years is that little time mentioned by iohn in the revelations chap
which commences after the expiration of the millenium and therefore that sabbatick millenium begins years before the end of the sixth millenium of the world


and indeed the whole age or time of the sabbatick happiness comprehends years even as much as the kingdom of babylon and antichrist contained that the day of christ`s glorious reign upon earth may be equal to the reign of antichrist in his base and filthy kingdom of darkness
and either period contains three years and an half that is seven years taken together which answers to the seven last years that iacob served laban


and indeed that whole time that iacob served laban making about twenty years elegantly divides the whole age of the world into its distinct by a marvellous analogy for as makes up one mystical and prophetical year so makes up months and

days that is in a manner years but such is the analogy
the first seven years of iacob service extend from the beginning of the world to israel departure out of aegypt now the time of iacob marriage with leah signifies that time wherein the lord engaged the of israel to himself by the outward law and the sons of his wife leah ruben simeon levi iuda extend from the law to christ's incarnation who was to spring out of iuda
lastly the children of the concubines signifie the gentiles who were to believe in christ in the days of the apostles even almost until the end of the babylonian apostacy
and rachel barrenness signifies the iewish church which during all that long space was as it were in the christian faith which rachel was to bring forth ioseph whose time certainly reaches to the sabbatick millenium but the birth being last of all apparently signifies the apostle paul who was of the tribe of with other saints who were last all to come into the world to wit about the year of the world and shou`d remain in the world even till the coming of christ from heaven
and the death of rachel and the departure of and

his sons out of padan aram into his own signifies the end of the world and the ascension of the saints from earth into the heavenly country in glorified bodies all this is confirmed from gen
from vers to the


but that little time aforesaid of years in which begins the sabbatick millenium within the sixth millenium of the world to wit at the year
was prefigur'd under the law by the sabbath which began in the evening of the sixth day wherefore those years are as it were in the evening of the sixth day that is the sixth millenium of the world


moreover it is clearly demonstrated the words of osea when that most blessed and truly golden age of the sabbatick millenium shall begin
os ch

after two days he shall quicken us and in the third day he shall raise us up and we shall live in his sight
what can be here signified by two days but two thousand as in psal the
as in
pet
and therefore by the third day he plainly means that sabbatick millenium of the world wherein he and all the saints were to be raised up to live intirely a thousand years neither to dye any more but to ascend into the celestial country when the millenium thousand is
now

osea lived in the fourth millenium and therefore when said after two days he had respect to the seventh millenium
but compare this prophesy with that of daniel concerning years and thou shalt plainly perceive that both extend unto the sabbatick millenium


but because those days dan

contain years to wit the whole time of the apostacy after the apostles to the beginning of the millenium therefore from years years are deducted and the remainder contains the time from the beginning of the babylonian captivity to the beginning of the apostasie after the apostles and therefore subtracting from there remains years the time from the resurrection of christ to the beginning of the apostasie to which add from the nativity of christ to his resurrection the sum is years and an half the nativity of christ to the of the apostasie


add to this number years mentioned in the revelation the sum is years from the nativity of christ to the end of the first period of the reign of antichrist


the second period of years in daniel extends years further that is from the birth of christ to the year

the third period of the reign of antichrist extends years further which is years viz to the year of christ's nativity

therefore the year from the nativity of christ ends the reign of antichrist and the four monarchies and all the kingdoms of the world and from that very year begins the reign of christ and of the saints over the whole earth

but tis uncertain whether this present epocha or date from the time of christ's nativity in the flesh commonly received among christians be true or no for usher thinks the vulgar epocha to fail of the true epocha about four years


also the great coversion of the gentiles by the preaching of the gospel in its purity and efficacy must preceed this happy millenium of the world and then will follow the conversion of the iews to the christian faith to wit from the year unto the year but

years from the ye unto the ye have respect to the conversion of the gentiles then years from the year unto do in a special manner respect the restoration conversion and return of the iews into their own country


but from the year of christ's nativity to the year of christ are prepar'd and gather`d unto god and the saints which are the first fruits for as the feast of the first fruits under the law was kept days before the feast of autumn so also now the feast of the first fruits preceeds the feast of autumn years


but the time of the millenium seems to have been prefigured to abraham in the which god commanded him to offer
now god commanded abraham to take a of three years old a goat of three years old a ram of three years old with a turtle dove and a young pigeon
now suppose the turtle dove to be one year old and the pigeon twenty days old the days of all those years according to the prophetick style signifie years and all being added together make up
admit also that abraham saw this vision when he was years old which was the year of the according to the aforesaid

the number being added to the number makes up the year of the world when the millenium will begin


in the future millenium all the saints that ever lived since the beginning of the will be rais'd up to live a holy and blessed life upon earth for the space of a thousand years
dan

hos
revel


this resurrection of all the saints to life is the first resurrection expresly so call'd by the apostle iohn revel


in this first resurrection the saints are raised to life in a carnal and terrestial body not such as we now have but such as adam had in paradise before he had eaten the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil and such a body likewise had christ wherein he suffer'd death for all mankind


therefore there is a twofold resurrection of the saints the first is in a carnal and terrestrial body in which they shall all live for the space of a thousand years
the second is that in which that carnal and terrestrial body after the expiration of a thousand years shall not dye but be changed in a moment or in the twinkling of an eye into a spiritual and coelestial body and ascend into

heaven even as christ ascended into heaven after his resurrection from the dead


of which twofold resurrection of the saints the apostle paul speaks clearly in epist to the corinth
chap
that is not first which is spiritual but that which is natural and then that which is spiritual as we have born the image of the earthly and we shall also bear the image of the heavenly
but we shall not bear the image of the earthly in the body in which we now live viz of the adam as he was after the fall but in the first resurrection we shall bear the image of the earthly in the future millenium living such a blessed and holy life as adam have lived if he had not sinned at the end of the millenium we shall not dye but be changed and this mortal shall put on and this corruptible incorruption


yet the body of the first resurrection may be said in some sence to be mortal and corruptible not that it shall ever dye or be corrupted but because in respect of a spiritual it is as it were mortal and corruptible that is at least not beyond a possibility of dying or being slain by external violence if god were so pleased even as the body christ suffered death which notwithstanding

in it's own nature cou'd not dye


and that the saints shall be raised to life in a carnal or natural body appears from that which paul said speaking of himself and others we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and this mortal shall put on immortality paul therefore expected to be raised up to life in a body of flesh in the future millenium that shou'd not dye but be changed

it appears also that when the millenium is finished gog and magog shall gather themselves together against the saints to slay them which certainly they cou'd never attempt to do if they did not live in a body of flesh

this is more largely con'd that the saints even until years after the beginning of the millenium shall marry and propagate children for the state of matrimony and procreation of children is not beneath the dignity of the future millenium for adm in his paradisical state before the fall had a wife and tho he had not sinned wou'd have known his wife and have begotten children


but that the saints do for some time in the aforesaid millenium contract matrimony and beget sons and daughters appears from isaiah
chap
where the inhabitants of this of this new heaven

and new earth are that they shall build houses and inite them plant vineyards and ear the ft of them they shall not labour in vain bring forth in fear for they are seed of the blessed of the lord and their with them yea in the same chapter tis affirm'd of the sinners who shall live in the millenium that they shall live to an hundred years nor shall any die in infancy and the days of the saints shall as the days of the tree of life for so that place was read by the fathers that is they shall live a thousand years and then shall not die but ascend into heaven in a body changed which adam would have done if he had not sinned


now that new heaven which will be in the future millenium will be only new in respect of their excellent natures


ioseph by his iacob which belongs to the said millenium clearly they should marry and beget and bring up children gen
for among her blessings which he had he also blessed with the blessings of the the womb which have a respect to wives and mothers whose blessings also to reach to the bounds of the everlasting hills viz to

the second resurrection when this body of flesh shall be changed into a spiritual body and being thus changed shall ascend into the everlasting hills that is into the highest heavens


therefore those words of christ that in the resurrection of the dead they do not marry nor are given in marriage but are equal to the angels are to be understood of the second resurrection but not of the first because certainly in first resurrection they shall not be equal to to the angels but as adam was in paradise before the fall

and hitherto may be referred those of the book of wisdom
blessed is the and who hath not known the sinful bed for she shall have fruit in the visitation of souls


now all the sons of the saints in the future millenium are the souls of all the saints that ever have liv'd in a carnal body since the beginning of the world and finally raised up to life in a of flesh and of fathers and mothers into the for none shall enjoy the reward and blessedness of the millenium but such who have lived an holy life on from the of the world
moreover christ called this resurrection

of the saints unto life regeneration


and therefore all saints that enjoy the millenium shall then be born into the world in a carnal body and shall have fathers and mothers according to the flesh

nor will this seem strange or incredible to any one after it is clearly demonstrated from scripture that we have all lived several times in a body of flesh yea for many years and ages of years

this truth being once demonstrated and granted in a manner all the mysteries and things to be apprehended of the future millenium will be most easily understood for the ignorance of the souls being born again and returning to life in a body of flesh hath mightily obscur'd the mystery of the future millenium and in a manner all other mysteries of the whole christian religion which indeed when the said new birth or carnal regeneration is demonstrated will display themselves and appear with a wonderful sweetness facility and of truth


first therefore it shall be demonstrated by certain arguments drawn from scripture that the same souls after the death of the carnal body were again

raised to life and born of parents in a body of flesh


first this is proved from the express words of christ himself who called iohn baptist elias yea affirmed him to be elias himself matth

mark
and declared him also to be the same that was to come
but that where iohn denied that he was elias is to be understood of the mystery of years couch't under the name of eliah which also signifies the strong and mighty god for that dispensation or ministration of iohn answers not to to the name of elias but the name of iohn which signifies grace but when he shall be born again into the world that dispensation will most excellently suit with the name of eliah


secondly tis proved from that passage of st paul to the romans where discoursing of the unbelieving iews he affirms that they shall after many ages believe in christ and finally be reunited to their natural root but the force of the argument concludes in behalf of those souls who were unbelieving in the days which after certain ages were to believe in christ after the fullness of the was converted to the christian faith which conversion of the iews we yet expect earth even of those who were unbelieving

in the apostles days for all the iews which are natural branches shall be saved and their hearts shall be opened and that too before the beginning of the millenium


thirdly tis proved from matth

compared with the chron

where christ airms that those very iews who were contemporary with him in the flesh had kill'd zacharias the son of baruch
but this wickedness was committed in the days of king ioas more than eighty years before christ's incarnation

but if any should affirm that this was not their own but their crime and imputed to them because they were led by the same spirit of iniquity and impiety answer this cannot destroy the force of the argument because according to the ordinance of god the sins of the fathers are not imputed to the children beyond the third or fourth generation even when the children are led by the same spirit and follow the same steps of their fathers
but many generations have interven'd between that wickedness and the time of christ's incarnation and many more the murther of abel and that time

therefore those very iews had divers times lived in the world before that time yea cain who killed abel lived at that time
now that the fathers of those iews did kill the prophets is true for all the prophets which were killed were either killed by the fathers of those iews but in the space of four generations or by those very iews themselves


fourthly tis proved in that christ affirms that those very iews to whom he spoke whilst in the flesh had killed the prophets
ierusalem ierusalem said he that killest the prophets and stonest them that were sent unto thee how often would have gathered thee but thou would'st not
fifthly it is proved in that st paul thess

affirms that the same iews killed christ and the prophets

sixthly in that christ in his parable those to have ill the servants of the lord and at last killed the son himself


seventhly from christ's parable of hired and sent into the field some in the morning others at the third hour others at the sixth hour others at the ninth hour others were called at the eleventh hour but they who were called at the eleventh stood all the hours of the day idle in the
by

those labourers who were called in the eleventh hour the gentiles are to be understood who were called into the church of christ by the minstery of the apostles after christ's resurrection
by those who were called in the morning and at other hours of the day the iews are understood the morning is the beginning of the therefore certain iews who lived in the apostles days liv'd from the beginning of the world and laboured twelve in the field some laboured nine others six three
and when the evening came all received a peny the gentiles were made equal with the iews the iews but without reason for the believed in christ and laboured in the field had done as much and some of them more in the last hour than the iews had done in the whole day for they had done but little before christ's incarnation and passion and many of them did not labour without grudging therefore christ said of them many are but few are


tis proved from the words of
epist
chap

for the same souls or the same men who lived before and perished in the flood liv'd also in bodies of flesh upon the earth when death in the flesh

who being mortified in the flesh was quicken'd in the spirit and poured out upon men a more abundant life of grace after he arose from the dead and then indeed by the ministery of his life and grace he preached to those souls who from the beginning of the world were detain'd in prison and in chains of darkness under the power of satan which souls notwithstanding restor'd to life in a body of flesh to hear the gospel
for the gospel is not preach'd to souls that live out of the flesh but to such as live on earth in bodies of flesh iohn
iohn
luke


ly tis proved from the words of peter where he affirms in his epistle chap
vers
that the gospel was preached to the dead that they might be judged as men in the flesh and therefore they who in time past were dead lived again in the flesh that they might live to god in the spirit


ly tis prov'd in that christ preached that the hour should come and was already come in which the dead should hear the voice of the son of god and they that hear shall live
whereby the dead he means not only the spiritually dead but such as are naturally dead

also who were to live again in the days of christ that they might hear the gospel and in hearing might believe and in believing might have eternal life


proof
st paul in his epistle to romans
affirms that redemption is made in christ jesus to the remission of sins past in the patience and long suffering of god
now the sins are all the sins committed by all men from the beginning of the world

proof
christ is said to have reconciled us to god by his death even when we were enemies to him and to have born our sins in his body on the cross which he could not have done if we had not lived some time before the death of christ

prof
christ dyed for all men as well for those that had been dead from the beginning of the world as for those who were then alive and therefore the efficacy of his sacrifice extends unto all that have ever lived from the beginning of the world that they might repent and obtain forgiveness of their sins

if they would but believe in christ and obey his commandments for the time to come
and how absurd is that opinion that christ should suffer death for all that dyed since the beginning of the world and

yet that the greatest part of them should be wholly ignorant of so great grace and favour neither should ever taste of the fruits of the said grace after the death of christ


proof

christ hath affirmed that all sins should be forgiven the sin against the holy ghost but there were no sins committed against the holy ghost before the death of christ

proof
paul said god winked at men in the times of ignorance but then he called all to repentance
therefore he called those also to repent whom he hath formerly winked at ever since the beginning of the world

because otherwise the patience and long suffering of god cou'd not be explained for god forbore with much long suffering the vessels of wrath
and the great long suffering of god allowed much time for repentance because in the sight of the lord a thousand years are but as one day


proof
peter in his second epistle chap said god did not come on purpose to execute his tremenduous judgments in the conflagration of the world because he is long suffering and wills all to come to repentance and therefore the long suffering of god bears with men almost

two thousand years after the death of christ before the beginning of the millenium three thousand years before the last judgment and conflagration of the which three thousand years are with the lord but as three days
now to what purpose did god grant men so long a time but that such as had not lived a years from the beginning of the world might have the same time to live in a body of flesh before the end of the world that they might at last repent and in case they did not repent should be justly punished for the neglect of so great grace and long sufferance


proof
the lord will grant all a day of visitation in the flesh that they may repent and lead a better life and that day of visitation is a thousand years according to the testimony of peter pet

compare herewith hebrews


proof
christ affirmed the gospel should be preached to the world that is to all men therefore all men either have heard the gospel preached which christ suffer'd death or else hear it before the end of the world therefore all men that ever have lived since the beginning of the world if they have not believed on

christ to come by the ministery of the prophets must live again to hear of christ and to believe in him by the of the apostles and other ministers of christ

proof
for the promise of eternal salvation has respect to the faith of men whereby they believe on christ that god raised him from the dead and therefore all either have had or shall have before the end of the world opportunity to hear of christs resurrection from the dead which they cannot have unless they are born again into the world

proof
the lord promised by moses those iews and israelites who liv'd in moses time that he would raise them a like unto moses whom they should hear in all things and therefore those very iews and israelites were to live in a body of flesh in the days of the messias
and so the was to be raised to all the iews and people of israel both to the fathers and the children that all the fathers and all the children especially those who dyed in unbelief might have opportunity to believe in christ and obtain remission of their sins past for they were not to be punished with in the end of the world for transgressing the law but for transgressing the gospel
see heb



proof
for those promises of the abundant grace of god and the plentiful efusion of the spirit which god promised by the prophets had respect to those iews and israelites who lived in the days of the prophets which nevertheless were not to be fulfilled till the latter days under the preaching of the gospel after the coming of the messias in the flesh for the promises were made to the iews and all their children afar off even to those who lived from the beginning of the world acts
for how cou'd the iews rejoyce in hope of those promises unless they were to live again in the days when they were to be fulfilled under christ


tis prov'd
from psal

thou turnest man to destruction and sayst again return ye sons of adam for a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday when it is past and as a watch in the night
from hence is clearly hinted the revolution of souls from life unto death and from death unto life and that in the space of years which are but as night consisting of four watches which this mystery seem'd to signifie when it was said that iesus went uppn the sea to disciples in the fourth watch of the night for that time in which christ came in

the flesh was in the fourth watch that is almost at the end of four thousand years from the beginning of the world


proof
from the words of solomon in
chap
to
for by a similitude of the sun wind and a river is shown the various and manifold revolutions of souls from life unto a corporeal death and from death again unto life for as the same sun riseth that sets the same wind blows from tho south into the north and from the north into the south the same river that comes out of the sea returns into the sea so the same generation that goes out of the world returns into the world neither is there any remembrance of former things
in which words he tacitely answers the objection why therefore cannot men remember that they have lived before for that stands in the counsel and goodness of god but in the end of the world the books shall opened and they shall remember all things
and it was properly said of solomon whatsoever was at that time had been before and should be again because all souls had already been in the world before solomon time and perform'd their revolutions whereof none was to be finished before the death of christ on the

cross which will appear more plainly from the table of the revolution of souls annexed


proof
is drawn from chap
and
vers
will open graves and cause you to ascend out of your sepulchres that is from the state of the dead into your own land


tis prov'd
from those four wheels of chap
and chap
and four beasts which yet are but one beast and every beast had faces to wit the face of a bull the face of a man the face of a lyon and the face of an eagle
which wheels and faces signifie nothing else than four great revolutions of souls every great revolution comprehends a thousand years and under every great revolution are contained three other lesser revolutions whereof each one third part of a thousand years that is years
and altho there are said to be four beasts and every is said to have four faces yet there are not faces but because the fourth of the first wheel is the of the second and so of the rest as may be seen by the following table more at large
those four wheels are called gilgal or a wheel because they make but one great wheel to wit the vast revolution of years

figure

which make up a mystical year and all those wheels belong unto men but not unto angels because the said wheels were circumvolv'd or rowl'd under the firmament viz upon earth which are nothing else the revolutions of souls in terrestrial bodies


it is proved
because they who kill'd the since the apostle's days to wit within after the death of christ were after many ages to be slain by turks and other bloody and barbarous men and this happened in the opening of fifth seal rev

tis proved
in that they are killed in the pouring out of the third vial who in times past killed the saints and prophets of god
see rev

proof
it is the rule and general ordinance of god's justice that he that kills with the sword shall be killed with the sword and he that leads into captivity shall be led into but these things rarely happen in one age and therefore are to be referr'd to divers ages and lives


proof
for in babylon was found the blood all the and saints which lived since the days of christ and the apostles yea also before those times even from the time babylon rst began to be builded for the

number of years makes an intire period of twelve revolutions


proof
for this reason the brethren of the deceased were to raise up seed to their brethren that they might as far as was possible be born again into the in a proper and direct line and that because of the genealogy of christ

proof
and for this reason the lord in the parable commended that unfaithful servant who was so liberal to the poor that they might receive him into their houses when he should fail and therefore said he the children of this world are wiser in their generation to wit in their revolution of generation than the children of light

proof
the apostle iude writeth concerning certain wicked persons who turned the grace of god into wantonness that they were afore ordained to condemnation but afore or of old doth not from eternity or before all ages neither doth god ordain or sentence men to condemnation before they have committed sin but for sins committed and therefore those who were afore ordain'd to condemnation have wilfully committed sin in their former life when they liv'd heretofore in former ages wherefore the most just god hath sentenced them to such a condemnation


proof
for the apostle peter

epist
chap
writeth of certain false teachers among the christians whose judgment then of a long time lingred not what then can be hereby intended but that they committed such a long time or in ages whilst they lived for which god condemned them to that punishment besides also he does not darkly hint that the same teachers among the christians were false prophets among the see verse
which judgments of god against them they had believed in christ would nevertheless have been cancell'd and blotted for christ dyed for them also and redeem'd them with his blood that they might believe and be and because they did not believe in christ under the former sentence brought against them therefore it is confirmed de novo or a new


proof
god speaking to abraham of the amorites said their iniquity was not as yet to be fulfilled till after years but because those amorites were not to live so many years in the flesh no not one half of those years it evidently that they were to be raised up again to life in a body of flesh before the years were compleated that they might

their iniquity and this wonderfully agrees with the number of years within which compass for that man's life is so abbreviated the same souls shall be newly raised up to le as the following table to which if be added they make up the number of or if be added it makes us which number of or was to be allotted to that people that in the succeeding life they might their moreover the same amorites cou'd have liv'd twice before this since the flood and therefore the third time of life seem'd to have been necessary according to the order of divine justice before that they cou'd have fulfilled their iniquity for which they should to be erradicated out of the earth


tis prov'd
because salvation and life is the fruit of good works which men sow in the earth or in an body and therefore those that dye in infancy especially if they have not lived before in a body of flesh to ripeness of years must be raised up to life again that they may grow to maturity and have opportity to sow the seeds of good works in the life of a carnal body that they may at last rejoyce in the fruits of their labour for except our happiness

were the fruits of our own work and labour it were not real and true happiness nor shou'd we have true joy therein for it would be like the son of a strange mother whom no mother loves as she doth her own son


tis proved
because otherwise the doctrine of god's universal grace and love cou'd not be establish'd or defended for certainly we find not a few who from their infancy are so harden'd and buried in sin that all the time of this present life they seem wholly uncapable of repentance

tis proved
because the apostle rom writeth that many of the iews were blinded according to the prophesies of scripture for many ages that they cou'd not believe till the fulness of the gentiles were gather`d unto and then they who were formerly blinded were to be again illuminated when they should return again into the world


tis proved
because in christ's parable of the that bore no fruit for three years this very thing is clearly hinted luke
for what is to be understood by those three but three thousand years for every millenium is mystically signified by one year under the law and therefore

the seventh millenium of the world which is the sabbath was signified by the seventh year and by the that bore no fruit for those three thousand years many of the iews are to be who had lived on earth from the beginning the world and yet bore no fruit but in the fourth millenium the for the barren and applies dung to the roots thereof that is dieth for the sins of the iews and applies the abundant grace of his holy spirit to them that they might bring forth good fruit and therefore the patience and of god suffers all men years that is years whereof they live years by parts in an earthly body that they might at length repent


tis proved
because iohn the baptist provokes the iews to repentance by this argument and now is the ax laid to the root of the trees matth

therefore every tree that brings not forth good fruit shall be hewen down and cast into the fire
now why did he say and now the ax is laid to the root of the trees certainly because that time of life was the last revolution and the last hour with a great many of the iews signifying by these words if the iews did not then repent whilst they lived in a body of flesh that there was

no hope for them to be raised up to life in the days of the messias and to be call'd to repentance for that was the last time wi great many that they should have and none could know whether he should have any time to live in the of the and therefore he truly the is laid to the root of the to wit of a
but such whose twelve hours of revolutions were not yet elapsed might indeed in regard they were to live again in the flesh six or seven generations as from a root le in the earth not as yet cut off sprout and put as it were new branches in the


this is proved
in that the rich man who was tormented in hell knew that he should at length depart out of the place and born again into the world which is plainly hinted in for he had five brethren whom he would not have come into that place and he desired some body to be sent from the to call them to repentance
to what then should he take so great care of his brethren did he not look at his own interest therein yes doubtless for he that he himself after six or seven should be born of one of the sons of his brethren whom therefore he to be good that he himself might then

have an opportunity to become so after he was born of good parents into the world


tis prov'd
because after christ's resurrection from the dead and ascension into heaven all that were detain'd under the chains of satan from the beginning of the world were to be again from death unto that they might hear the gospel and have that benefit offered to them which christ purchased for them as is manifest psal
and isaiah chap

tis proved
because those who were sealed even before the trumpets sounded were raised up in the interval of the sixth trumpet that they might become the first fruits to god and the lamb which thing begins already to be fulfilled and will be compleatly fulfilled in the year

tis prov'd
because those altho they are accounted gentiles yet they are really iews and israelites to wit from each tribe of the children of say truly and properly and not only mystically that is have the souls of true iews who were in time past iews and of parents

prov'd
because god promised that is to the ish church

that her sons should be brought to her in the gentiles arms and upon their shoulders which plainly intimates that they should be born of gentile parents
see isaiah
rom
rom


tis prov'd
because from the beginning of the world a people was prepared christ both among the iews and luk
ioh

tis prov'd
from rom
where the apostle paul speaks of the gentiles that believ'd on christ who in times past
did not believe in god and now they obtain mercy by times past we are to understand former ages when they liv'd heretofore in the world without either the true knowledge of god or hope in god
compare herewith those sayings of ephes

gal



tis proved
from thess

where paul affirms of such whom satan shou'd deceive in the days of who were to be deliver'd up to strong delusions by the just judgment of god that they might come into condemnation because they did not receive the love of the truth which clearly unveils the reason wherefore god suffered so thick a mist and cimmerian darkness to invade the world about years after christ's


also why he suffer`d that so long to blind the minds and of men that men were in a more blinded for some ages past in the of antichrist than they were whilst they liv'd under ethnicism the incarnation of christ say the of this is because they who were us blinded under antichrist when they v'd under the clear light of the gospel not love that light nor believe on that true light enlightning every that comes into the world and by god's most just judgment are blinded and darkened when they return into life in a body of flesh with this and obscure darkness and therefore light of the gospel shone in the world so much lustre for so small a time to the space of years and not longer that the greatest part of mankind might have a sufficient opportunity to embrace the said light but seeing they depised it it was not convenient that this shou'd shine any longer to them in for the coming of christ in his day is the morning which suddenly east to the west and they who love not that light it are worthy to be left in the negle of so great

but they who have not had the clear light of the propos'd unto them in the aforesaid space of years from christ's death and resurrection shall live again years before the beginning of the millenium and shall have the truth of the gospel clearly shining before the eyes of their minds that so all that perish may be left without excuse for there shall not be a man on earth to whom the clear light of the gospel shall not shine before the end of the world and that too immediately as well as by means of the preaching of the true servants of god even such who are truly sent and commission'd by god and for the gospel must be preach'd to every creature before the end of the world


tis
because god the iniquities of the fathers upon the third and fourth generation that the children of the third and fourth generation which underwent that punishment might be meliorated and reduc'd to a better state and condition of life that so at length from these so meliorated after the third and fourth generation from their children thus meliorated they may be again born into the world and become better as being born of better parents for it is a singular gift god to be born of good parents


it is proved

because for this reason a bastard was not admitted into the congregation of the lord until the tenth generation so that when he shall be born the second time into the world in the or generation the punishment which god inflicts on him and his children shall reduce him to a better state and condition and that defilement of lust and depravity shall be in some measure purged away
but since by christ every sinfull pollution is more effectually and perfectly purged away from those who believe on him therefore that severe law concerning bastards and a spurious issue together with all others of the like nature is repeal'd and abolish'd and hence also the words of paul may be understood where he speaks concerning fornication that he that commits fornication sins against his own body infects and depraves his own root and original from whence he is to spring again and be raised unto life with the odious stain of his own filthy lust


lastly tis proved because when certain of the jews thought christ was elias or ieremias or one of the prophets which pesuppos'd the truth of such a doctrine in general christ did not generally condemn the same but rather confirmed it

saying that iohn was elias
moreover also he did the same in his answer to his disciples concerning him that was born blind and so also when he conversed with nicodemus concerning regeneration or being born again tho he chiefly intended spiritual regeneration

there are other arguments not a few which might be brought to confirm the truth of this doctrine which for brevity are


moreover this doctrine of the return of souls to live again and be born in a body of flesh very easily answers to many of the most weighty objections to the opping of the mouths of atheists who dispute against the justice of god concerning the state of infants dying in their infancy and the state of fools and such as are possess`d with unclean spirits from their infancy to the last moment of their lives
also it wonderfully demonstrates the justice wisdom and goodness of god towards mankind in all his ways and administrations it also evidently shews the equality of the ways god and his marvelous yea clearly evinces what and how great did accrue to all mankind by the death of christ in the latter days by the abundant favour and benignity of god
moreover also it doth

mightily illustrate confirm and perfect in a the whole doctrine of christianity the salvation of heathens and yet nevertheless makes the christ's coming in the flesh and fh in him of absolute necessity to the salvation of all and finally greatly furthers the conviction and conversion of the iew


from what has been said the truth of the said doctrine of the various returns of into a body of flesh is but how often they shall return shall somewhat more distinctly explained

all souls which are not perfect in faith righteousness and holiness do return twelve times until they are perfected and that soul which was made perfect in faith and holiness in some former tho before the death of christ needed not to return into a mortal life unless it were such that were to come again in the flesh for some publick benefit to all mankind as in the case of elias and some extraordinary men


therefore we affirm that there is no necessity for many of the prophets and saints to live again after they have slept in the lord before christ's incarnation much less is such a revolution to be affirmed

after the coming of christ because the faithful that dye in the lord rest from their labours


but tis proved that some imperfect souls must necessarily make revolutions or returns as well from those hours the labourers wrought in the field as that the day of every souls visitation contains hours according to the words of christ are there not hours in the day work whilest you have the day then because four watches of the night contains years from psal

and watch three hours again this is proved from those faces and wheels in chap


but because the revolutions of the souls are not compleated in less than years which are all to be finisht at the end of the future millenium therefore all souls began their revolutions in the year of the world

all which and much more this following table will clearly exhibit to the eye
the explanation of the table

the first column contains years of the world as it were devided into hours wheof each contains years


the eight column at the right hand contains the revolutions of souls from the first the twelfth


the tenth column contains the intervals of the from the resurrection of christ to the year about

the eleventh column contains years of the world as aforesaid but something disposed in a different order

the twelfth column contains the names of faces in each revolution

the second column contains revolutions of souls from the beginning of the world to the year of the world

the third column contains the of souls from the year of the world to the year of the world and so thence forward to the year of the world

now because all the souls that come into the world have or years to fulfill their twelve revolutions in if they are not perfect in goodness therefore all souls came into the world and begun their first revolution between the beginning of the world and the year of the world for if be added to the number the sum will be beyond which the revolution of souls doth not extend


those souls which came into the world from the beginning thereof made their twelfth and last revolution about the year of the world


therefore after the year some souls were not to come into the world any more till the beginning of the millenium if they were holy and not till in the exact millenium if they were evil and not yet purged

and christ ought to offer to god the father a sacrifice for the sins of all mankind about the year of the world otherwise they who had finished their revolutions would have had no benefit of his sacrifice if he had come later

and because a great many souls have accomplish'd their between the year and therefore since christ's resurrection from the dead no man without some particular divine revelation cou'd be certain whether he should come again into the world to have an opportunity of and therefore none by the aforesaid doctrine can or ought to indulge themselves into a wicked life in to come again into the world becse he cannot certainly know wher he or


but no man that dy'd in utter impenitence after the year of the world is expir'd can redeem his former mispent time tho he shou'd come into the word within the interval of the blessed millenium so as to enjoy the happiness of the millenium or obtain the resurrection of the just in this world for truly the millenial happiness and resurrection of the just is ordained and appointed as a reward for such who have heretofore a holy life before the beginning of the millenium which was signified by this type that it was not lawful for the israelites to gather manna on the sabbath day therefore none may or ought to the amendment of his life to another time because this present time is the last is granted to any in this world to obtain salvation


but because before the death of christ men might abuse this doctrine of the souls revolution as they may now in some measure therefore according the ordination of divine wisdom it came to pass that the said doctrine the lay conceal'd as an hidden and was not to be unlock'd to any but good men which nevertheless may now without danger and indeed ought to be revealed for it is of great use to convince the

iews and to demonstrate more clearly other heads of the christian religion


for from the aforesaid doctrine the justice of god in punishing the wicked and rebellious is plainly demonstrated seeing all the wicked and rebellious have sinned against god a thousand years whilst they lived in a body of flesh therefore it is just that they shou'd be punished in hell fire years after the end of this world for so god who made all things in number weight and measure hath also limited a number and measure to the torments of the damned that every rebellious and incorrigible sinner may be punished seven fold which space of seven thousand years being finished the same souls are again sent into the world for a fresh tryal of their obedience
but those whom the space of seven thousand years wherein they shall be punish'd in hell fire with the most grievous and tremendous torments will not deter from sin these certainly are so stupid and obdurate that not any even the longest torments that words can express can deter from it nor hath that infiniteness of ages wherein wicked men are to be punish'd tho preached up by many men but rather led many into despair and hardened their

hearts against the goodness and mercy of god


now every one making his revolulution from the first to the twelfth comes three times into the world in a carnal body in the space of one millenium which is like one year consider then whether this be not that which was figured under the law when all were to appear thrice every year before the lord at the temple of ierusalem which typified the temple of the body neither doth this seem to want a mystery that the temple of ierusalem stood about a thousand years before it was utterly and totally overturn'd and demolish'd
moreover also this is worthy our animadversion viz that all souls whatsoever that had lived in a body of flesh ought to have lived once in some hour between the hours ten eleven and twelve including part of the ninth and thirteenth in case they had finished their twelve revolutions from the beginning of the world

therefore all souls not yet perfect lived in the compass of one hour to wit in the interval of years viz from the year of the world to the year of the world


and therefore all that have perform'd their twelfth revolution within the said hour or leastwise their eleventh tenth ninth or eighth ought to hear the gospel because all souls who were in their twelfth revolution were not to return as yet but that were to return had not suicient opportunity of hearing the gospel sincerely preached by reason of antichristian darkness


others also who were making but sixth and fifth revolution death and resurrection of christ if so be within the said hour they have not heard the gospel preach'd they must hear in their succeeding revolutions before the beginning of the millenium to wit within the year and the birth of christ


in revel

it is said the rest of the dead lived not again till the thousand yrs were finish'd this certainly is to be of those dead who had compleated their twelve revolutions but those who had not as yet their twelve were to live again in the none who belonged to to live again in the because they fit revolution at the year and at the year the

what's worth our serious consideration that these very men which shall be at st destroyed in spiritual babylon were same men who in a litteral sence ilt the outward babylon


the foregoing scheme exhibits to our view one great wheel being the greaest of all then four other great wheels stly twelve little wheels
the great containing the little wheels and the greatest of all years

the explanation of the
in this figure the great outward represents the greatest revolution humane souls

the other four great circles signifie same years so as that one of them years

and lastly the lesser circles signifie ch one only revolution or face of ars
the chief use of the figure is to ew that there are but faces altho ch great one contains four less ones


the greatest revolution of souls years is fairly shadowed

out to us under the type of the six days creation
for as the first days was finished in the fourth the work of the second day in the fifth the work of the third day in the sixth finally all in the seventh so the souls that begin their revolutious in the first millenium finish it in the fourth and so fulfill their mystical year and are either made perfect in goodness or have filled up their measure of evil those which are perfect in goodness shall be rais'd up to life in the body and after the millenium is expir'd their bodies shall be chang'd and spiritualiz'd and they shall ascend into heaven but such who have fill'd up their measure wickedness shall be rais'd up to live in a body of flesh that they may suffer judgment in the conflagration of the world whose resurrection is to death and condemnation
souls that begin their revolutions in the second millenium compleat them in the fifth and finally those that begin their revolutions in the third compleat them in the sixth millenium
and forasmuch as in the sixth day of the worlds
man was created perfect in the image of god therefore in the sixth millenium all the saints shall be raised up to live in the body and be born the world to

wit for the space of years the year the world to the year of the world and they shall live such an holy and blessed life on earth as adam would have lived if he had not sinned yea and far as sin abounded the grace of god shall much more abound
and the light of this day as the light of seven days because whatsoever was made in the first six days was finish'd in the seventh

and lastly the trees that bare fruit under the law were accounted uncircumcised until the
year but in the
year they were as it were circumcised and to the lord and in the year their was
this plainly signifies the whole revolution of souls which were consummated and till the millenium after christ's incarnation for he purg'd our sins on the cross he hung that so they might not be imputed to us that we believe on him whereby we shall from him the evangelical grace of the holy spirit
but the year signifies the sabbatick in which we shall enjoy the fruits of our and toil of our hands under they had manna it was not to gar manna on the so

also in the sabbatick millenium they who gather'd nothing in their preceeding lives cannot enjoy the millenial felicity
lastly as the manna which served for the sabbath was gather'd on the sixth day so in the end of the sixth millenium all the saints are restored to life and attain the blessedness of the sabbatick millenium


by the aforesaid numbers and years the mysteries of the seven seals and seven trumpets are clearly unlocked

and that the interval of the first seal contains years appears from the words of the first beast come and see and so of the rest plainly intimating that the space or interval of every seal from the first to the sixth comprehends years which is the interval of one revolution or face as may be seen in the tenth column of the table



therefore the interval of the first seal contains from the death resurrection of christ years
the interval of the second seal reaches to the interval of the third seal extends it self to the interval of the fourth seal reaches to the inter
of the seal reaches to the inter
of the sixth seal reaches to


now the predictions or prophesies of what should come to pass when each seal was open'd wonderfully answers to those intervals when the first seal was open'd viz from the death of christ to the year
the gospel was in a manner prehed to the whole world which was by the white horse and him that sat with a crown on his and a bow in his hand to wit christ
after that time the light of the gospel shone not so much by reason of men's sins
when the second seal was open'd the roman empire was exceedingly infested with war and almost totally ruin'd this happen'd between and
when the third seal was open'd that is from to famine and scarcity of provision follow'd the war as it commonly happens that war is succeeded by famine by the red horse war is signified by the black horse famine
in the opening of the fourth seal from the year to the year not only bloody wars but also superstition and ind the world and were signifi'd by the horse and that sat was ath whom
when the seal was open'd the and martyrs cry'd the lord to revenge

their blood which certainly came to pass for from the year of christ turkish empire miraculously prevailed whose sword god revenged the blood the saints
this interval reaches no fther than the year from death and resurrection that is to year since christ's nativity
within this or interval were saints to be killed which would fill up determinate number together with the saints which were slain before them this indeed is clearly fulfilled and yet is farther to be fulfilled to the year sin the birth of christ
in the opening of sixth seal that is in the interval of from the year from christ's death and to the year the kingdoms of men and worldly empires shall be overturn'd and the empire and dominion of the whole world shall christ's and his
and this is by the great the darkening of the sun and moon the the stars the removing of heaven out its place
but it is more clearly pointed out in the following words the kings of the earth and and that they should themselves which prophesie certainly in reason be wholly applyed to

ys of constantine which yet many do
the seventh seal in regard it has not any particular interval like the first but comprehends the whole hio is to consider'd apart


the seal was open'd eaven for the space after this silence seven ael prepare to with ir seven pets revel

wherefore eal the intervals of the seven trumpets

but the these trumpets reckon'd fm the seventh trumpet at the of the seventh trumpet the and the kingdoms this world become the kingdoms of god and his christ revel

and sound of this trumpet lasts years wit from the year of the world the year of the world and in interval the mystery of god shall be viz the mysterious name of shall be unlock`d and no than the reward of an immortal life on all the servants of god and indeed the promise which god made in the bush shall be fulfilled
am god of abraham isaac and jacob it shall be known that god is not the god of the dead but of the living


but the interval of the seventh trumpet being known the intervals of all rest are known also and are thus computed

the interval of the seventh trumpet from the year of the world to the interval of the sixth trumpet from the year of the world to the interval of the fifth trumpet from the year of the world to the interval of the fourth trumpet from the year of the world to the interval of the third trumpet from the year of the world to the interval of the second trumpet from the year of the world to the interval of the first trumpet from the year of the world
to


and from the nativity of christ

the interval of the first trumpet begins at the year of christ's which the year from christ's resurrection which number to half an hour which time the saints many prayers to god by christ
revel



now the said events plainly answer those intervals
at the sound of the rst trumpet there and mixt with blood
the interval of his trumpet is from the year of christ`s nativity to the year within space of time the roman empire gan to be vexed with grievous wars
at und of the second trumpet a great ning mountain was cast into the sea part of the sea it rn'd into blood the interval of this is from the year to the which interval or space of time re was most cruel and hideous wars in roman empire
at the sound of the trumpet a great star fell from upon those that were living and the fountains of waters and burned

like a lamp by reason whereof the waters were made bitter and killed many
the interval of this trumpet is from the year to the year by this without all peradventure the pope rome is to be understood who within interval advanced himself above all bishops whom he corrupted with at the sound of the fourth trumpet the year to the year the part of the sun moon and stars smitten and
this signifies that the emperour and together with the nobility and princes the empire should be very much and darkned within this interval and too by the power of the pope who same interval set himself above the perour


when the fifth angel sounded trumpet a star fell heaven a to him was given the key of the pit
and when the bottomless was open'd and a smoak ascended thence and from that locusts the earth which ved and tormented mankind all these is meant the school men and dctors who have so miserably a disquieted men with their opinions and controversies and infested

with their sharp and venemous stings that many choose rather to die than to live and this happened the year to but their chief time was months viz years to wit from the year to


lastly at the sound of sixth trumpet the four angels bound at the river euphrates are loosed which doubtless signifies the vast and mighty of the turks which they had prepared ago that is from the year and poured in upon like an inundation to slay the third of mankind as it were the third part of the world and this began from the year whosoever doubts the truth hereof let him consult the hio and he will find how great success the turk has had in and what progress he hath made that time to this very day

the of the seals and trumpets being known the of the seven phials with the intervals every one of them unsolds and displays it self

for the interval of the last trumpet comprehends of all seven phials and the interval each contains years

therefore the intervals of the phis are thus computed

the interval of the first phial from the year to the year

and so of all the rest to the seventh














now the event of these things wonderfully answers those intervals for in the year that is according to the vulgar computation in the year which if we believe uscherus fails of the true computation three or four years luther was rais'd up who was as it were the first phial poured out on the earth of the antichristian world for he did as it were sensibly touch the kingdom of antichrist from the top to the bottom again
from the year to the year the second phial was poured out for then the whole sea of the antichristian became as the blood of the slain and thence began fierce and bloody wars almost in all parts of the antichristian kingdom so that the very sea seem'd to be dyed with blood
from the year to the year the third phial was poured out upon the rivers and fountains of water and

they were turn'd into blood
and this also answers to the said interval for certain dukes and were kill'd with the sword under that interval
again from the to the year the fourth phial was pour'd out upon the son of antichrist because in that interval jesus the son of shone clearly in the hearts of many which scorcht and burnt up those men who had the mark of the beast
and from the year to the year the fifth phial is poured out upon the throne of the beast which very thing is already begun wherefore we joyfully expect his ruin and downfal till the aforesaid year
the effusion of the sixth phial hath to the slaughter and destruction the turks to make way for the kings of the east that is the iews and israelites to return into their own country
lastly the effusion of the seventh phials bring utter destruction to the kingdom of antichrist and all the enemies of the gospel
babylon is utterly overthrown and appears as a bride adorn'd for her husband


but it remains that we explain what the four beasts and
elders are
by four beasts tis meant the whole assembly of the saints and term'd four from their four great revolutions

and likened to four beasts
and by the elders are the twelve proph and apostles of christ who are in the law in the second book of esdras chap
where god expresly promised and nominated them together with abraham isaac and iacob for captains and leaders to the iewish and people when the kingdom of god shall be restored to them


first of all therefore the prophets shall be born into the world in the beginning of the millenium who are the captains and ring leaders to all that shall be born afterwards and the apostles shall be the last of all who shall remain on earth to the coming of christ

but as touching abraham isaac and iacob they are of an higher rank than the rest whether prophets or apostles

moreover it is worth our diligent enquiry whether isaac be not that seed of abraham which christ assumed when he came into the flesh for the promise which god made to abraham was concerning isaac that in him all nations should be blessed


and then if isaac was that seed it is farther to enquired whether soul of isaac had perform`d his twelve revolutions from the beginning of the world

as others had done if this be granted in st luke genealogy of christ whether the twelve revolutions of the same soul be not describ'd in order putting abel in the room of adam a new revolution of the souls always begins after every seventh generation


and these are the names of this soul in his revolutions

abel
methusela
heber
isaac

mattatha
simeon
elmodam
rhesa

melchi
christ
for seven generations do intervene in all these revolutions except in the last only where there are not reckoned but which may be understood after this manner viz the resurrection of christ from the dead was the seventh and his ascension into heaven as it were the eighth generation

therefore there are accounted seven generations between every revolution because certainly in the revolutions of other souls the same souls do return after every sixth and seventh generation
but the interval of six generations cannot agree to that soul which christ assum'd for two reasons first because then he would not have had only but above revolutions secondly because no would have fallen on isaac is


which hypothesis being admitted

sundry portions of sacred writ very mysterious and hard to be understood are with a wonderful harmony unlocked
and the mystery of christ's nativity will agree with divers other mysteries herein delivered which will be farther insisted upon hereafter


most difficult passages of scripture hereby explain'd are gen that the seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head which seed of the woman according to the aforesaid hypothesis is to be understood of abel even as the seed of the serpent is to be understood of cain for in these two seeds as in two roots the children of god
and the children of this world are comprehended
when cain was born eve said have received a man undefined span alphabet iehovah or as others read it with undefined span alphabet
if the former be allow`d that is badly and falsly apply'd unto cain which was due unto abel if the latter it intimates that together with that worldly man she had received him likewise who in the fulness of time should bear the name of undefined span alphabet
isaiah
a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son and she shall call his name immanuel which matthew applys to christ who was born of the mary which prophesie nevertheless ought

to have been fulfilled in the days of king ahaz
admit then that this prophesie was fulfilled in the days of king ahaz and afterwards when christ was born to wit that the same soul was twice born in the flesh of a virgin and peradventure of the same mother then this prophesie will be easily understood
and such a virginian birth answers to the eight revolution having the name of elmodam who was contemporary with king ahaz
notwithstanding ez was said to have been his father for christ was called the son of ioseph also

hos
out of aegypt have called my son this prophesie was fulfilled long before yet the evangelist applys it to the time when mary returned with the child out of aegypt which if understood of the same soul both accomplishments will agree together for naasson the prince of the children of iuda who departed out of aegypt with the rest of the israelites answers to the fifth revolution of the same soul
gen
the scepter shall not depart from iuda nor a from between his feet till shilo come that is he who was promised to be the king and of all the people shall not depart the tribe of iuda but shall perform his entire revolutions in a direct line of that tribe and that notwithstanding all

manner of affliction and persecution which should press the iewish nation there shall still remain the root of iesse which will at length bring forth the promised branch of salvation into the world and this prophesie cannot be understood of the outward scepter or kingdom of iuda for that was departed from iuda above years before christ's incarnation to wit during the whole reign of the maccabees who were levites mich
out of thee viz bethelem shall come the captain or of my people israel whose goings forth have been of old even from everlasting or as in the original from the days of ages for according to the aforesaid hypothesis he had or revolutions from the beginning of the world to that time wherein he was born of the

isaiah
the spirit of the lord god is upon me to show the acceptable year the lord and therefore that time wherein christ came in the flesh was call'd the acceptable year of the lord to wit because agreeable to the said even as the sun runs through the parts of the zodiack and finishes his course in one year so christ the sun of righteousness in the space of years which is as it were a mystical year accomplishes his

through the parts of time
and therefore st paul call'd that time when he was born of the virgin mary the fulness of time compare that of the nineteenth psal from verse to verse

that that psalm is to be understood of christ the prophets and apostles and the church of god is evident roman

see also heb
psal
sacrifice and burnt offering would'st not but a body hast thou me but this body is not a meer body but an animated body that is a soul with a body to wit the very seed of which christ assumed which seed was fitted and qualified by revolutions even as by so many preparations the of the world to that time to at last a throne and a tabernacle for king of glory jesus christ all which but according to the said hypothesis not possitively affirmed wherefore the assistance of divine grace we shall with sobriety inquire farther into the truth of the aforemention'd hypothesis we absolutely and positively assert it

moreover the aforesaid hypothesis wonderfully to illustrate that where christ is called our doubtless because according to it he the course of his revolutions from

the beginning of the world and was the first that had finished the course and period of them

and finally that he was made like unto us in all things sin excepted which is more illustrated by this hypothesis there are sundry other places of scripture which seem to be very much illustrated by the said hypothesis that where christ is said to have once appeared in the end of the world to purge away sin by the sacrifice of himself because indeed that soul bore the name of christ and lord only in his twelfth revolution
for neither abel nor isaac or any other of those revolutions was called christ nor ought any of them to bear the dignity or character of christ till they had performed their revolutions whereby that soul ought to be fitted and prepared to assume this excellent title and dignity
wherefore it is true that christ was but once born in the flesh and but once suffered for the sins of all mankind even according to the aforesaid hypothesis because christ did not assume that soul in a personal unity as the seed of abraham till the revolution

lastly because moses foretold that god would raise up a prophet to the israelitish people from amongst their brethren like unto him
the word raise up seems to intimate that

the soul of the same prophet had lived before in the flesh yea was at time living in the flesh

moreover the aforsaid hypothesis if it gain admittance would arm us with the most effectual argument to convince the iews that that was the very messiah who was born of the virgin mary and suffered under pontius pilate
for he ought not to have come sooner nor later into the world than he did because if he had come sooner he could not have perform'd his revolution years
ought not to come later because some souls would have all their revolutions before the messias was come and so would have been frustrated and disappointed of the fruit of his coming which could not be

but laying aside the aforesaid hypothesis still the argument remains as strong as before to convince the iews that the messias ought not to have come later into the world then he actually did
the iews themselves deny his coming sooner because indeed if he had come later then certain souls would have compleated their revolutions before he came and so would have reaped no benefit by the messias coming into the world

this argment will be more forcible to convince the iews because the iews themselves do acknowledge the revolution of souls to live divers times in the flesh altho they are ignorant of the number of those revolutions yet they expect that all shall at last be rais'd up and restor'd to in the days of the messias that they may enjoy the benefits of his coming when he shall come
now if it can be made appear to them from the old testament which they acknowledge and believe that there are revolutions of humane souls living in a body of flesh and neither more nor less even till they are at length perfected in a good or evil think we need not doubt but may positively conclude that the iews at leastwise all who are ingenious and covet in any measure or degree the knowledge of the truth will be convinced that the messias is come and in the next place believe his coming in the flesh that he suffered death and rose again from the dead and in believing be converted and become true christians which god of his mercy and accomplish amen


paul in cor
saith we shall not all but we shall be all changed in which words he plainly hints that some of the saints shall sleep after they shall be

in the flesh and be again rais'd from ead this indeed is affirm'd of are to come into the before the millenium and in the flesh who shall proph three years and an half in the and chiefly to the iews and people israel which three years and an half being expir'd they are to be kill'd by the beast and in three days and an half rais'd up to life again in the same bodies wherein they were slain and being thus rais'd up to life they shall not remain on earth but ascend into the heavens and there remain with christ till the end of the world and then indeed they shall come with him in the clouds of heaven


and that those two witnesses rev
are those two prophets who in a proper and litteral sense were to be kill'd seems to me most evident which will be between the sixth and seventh trumpet viz in the end of the interval of the sixth trumpet as it is to be seen from the words of the revelations
also the days of their prophesie are days not signifying so many years but only so many common days because there are not years between the sixth and seventh trumpet but only and yet this admirable event will between those trumpets

yea in the end of the sixth trumpet for they shall be born and slain in the space of years before the beginning of the millenium


that elias shall come before the beginning of the millenium appears from the words of christ elias truly shall come and restore all things

and lastly that moses and elias were to come and be slain and raised again from the dead and then ascend into heaven and remain with christ the whole millenium appears from christ's transfiguration in the mount where were seen with him moses and elias and these are they whom god the father hath ordain'd to sit the one at the right hand and the other at the left hand of christ in the kingdom of heaven

wherefore they are of an higher order and rank than all the prophets and apostles


therefore diligently weigh and consider whether abraham isaac and iacob that sit in the kingdom of heaven be not moses christ and elias of whom christ has for the greatest dignity consider also whether the same moses was not enoch and whether or no what is written enoch and elias that they should be translated into heaven doth not answer truly to this translation of and elias for

in the first translation they did not obtain the resurrection of a glorified body but it happen'd to them in a figure for ch only was the first of all that attai the of a glorified body is in scripture the first among the and the first the resurrection from the dead

and saviour jesus arose of all from the dead to suffer death then the first who sll arise after him is moses and elias and then the other prophets and apostles with all the saints every one in his


and that those two prophets and wnses in the revelation were indeed moses and elias is tacitely signify'd in these wo they shall have power to withhold the rain that it shall not rain upon the the earth and to turn the waters into blood both which were in old time imputed to the said prophets
moses turn'd the waters into blood and elias had power over the rain therefore when those prophets shall come into the world they shall likewise produce these signs and miracles litterally understood


and indeed that moses was not to live on earth in the future millenium seems to be clearly figur'd from hence

that he should not the land of promise but die in the land of moab of whom nevertheless it was said when he died that his eye was not darkned nor his strength nature impaired
and altho god seem'd to exclude moses from entring into the land of promise because he spake unadvisedly at the waters of meribah and so was thus chastised for it yet god out of his infinite goodness and mercy did transfer that chastisement into a greater favour and blessing to him


then as touching abraham isaac and iacob they indeed did that land of promise but only conversed therein a little time as strangers and pilgrims for that land was rather promised to their seed than to the fathers themselves
see deut
which also was a figure of this that neither abraham isaac iacob dwell on earth in the millenium but during the millenium should remain together in heaven


it remains now that we produce certain promises and prophesies and other testimonies of the holy ghost out of the whereby may be prov'd that all the saints shall be yet placed upon the earth viz in the millenium to live together a most holy and life

except those three extraordinary men who instead of that reward on earth obtain a more worthy and excellent reward in heaven
the places of scripture both of the old and new testament are these following exod
honour thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long in the land which the lord thy god giveth thee
which promise paul applies to the gospel

those seven churches of to whom st iohn wrote his revelations do most certainly signifiy the seven intervals of the universal church from the death and resurrection of christ to the end of the world
now the interval of philadelphia whose seeds is not only now in the world but her first fruits also begins from the year and continues to the year of christ's nativity
at what time the millenium shall begin for the promise of new ierusalem on earth was chiefly exhibited to the church of philadelphia lastly the millenium being almost follows the interval of the church of laodicea but this church belongs not to the saints of but is of another order and of a different kind who

will have the profession of the christian religion but without sincerity and because god hath invited them to repentance tis possible they may repent and yet for all that not enjoy the millenial happiness nor the resurrection of the just in this world
but their salvation and happiness will be deferred to the next succeding world
but those that do not repent will be cast into hell fire with other wicked and ungodly men where they shall suffer most tremenduous and torments at least for the space of years
and they are such whose sins christ said should neither be forgiven in this world nor that which is to come

certain to be added

because the number of the beast revel

is said to be and is called the number of a man this very well agrees with what has been said before for every face contains years and because the second face is of a man therefore the number is the number of a man to wit containing years from the year christ's nativity to the year for about the said year the second beast whose number is here

computed ascended out of the earth vix in the time when gregory the seventh flourish't who exalted himself above the emperor

seeing the intrerval of every seal except the seventh contains years hence it appears that from the death and resurrection of christ to the first part of the millenium there are about years and therefore from christ's death and resurrection to the end of the world there are about years which confirms the aforesaid chronology the same is also confirmed by the intervals of the trumpets

now whereas the interval of each trumpet is years this doth not seem to want a mystery for so many days as it were doth the infant remain in his mothers womb and in esdras the lodging rooms or chambers of the soul are likened to the womb of a because then exactly in years the soul is recall'd to live again in a body of flesh as it were at the sound of the trumpet of god himself therefore the interval of every trumpet is years to which if years be added for the age of in a body of flesh the sum will be years aforesaid


god out of his great and wisdom has so decreed that men should not live altogether and at one time

a thousand years compleat in the corrupt of a carnal body and it stands with the justice of god that they shall live the said thousand years by parts for by the frequent death of men mankind is better provided for and their benefit and advantage consulted for thus god often cuts off men to plant and ingraft them anew
whereas if men should at once live a thousand years compleatly in the state of corruption they would so degenerate that their repentance and salvation be far more difficult


but if any demand to what purpose god should call his saints to live in a terrestrial and carnal body a thousand years and whether it were not better for them and more desirable to them to remain with god in the heavens answer god knows better than we what is most conducive to our profit and advantage
and therefore the saints ought to live a thousand years on earth partly that they may receive a visible reward from god in the sight of the wicked and ungodly to their greater shame confusion and condemnation and partly and indeed chiefly that they may be prepared and in that millenium or thousand years of life to obtain so much and so great glory as they shall be invested with when they shall ascend bodily into heaven

a few questions by way of exposition on each chapter of the revelations of st iohn

wherein little or in a manner nothing except what pertains to the history is positively concluded but all are left to the free and impartial and ezamination of the lovers of truth

what may we understand by the seven churches of asia

to whom iohn wrote whether seven churches then in being or rather whether they were not seven states of the universal church from the time of

our saviour christ's resurrection to that so famous and noted time of the restoration of all things called in sundry places of scripture a sabbath
and in the old testament prefigured under the common sabbath of days and years which if iohn had intended of particular churches then in being why did he confine himself to a septenary were there not in asia more than seven churches again seeing he termed that which he wrote unto them a prophesie which hath respect to the time to come this doth not seem to agree so well with particular churches then in being as with the universal church understood by seven states or conditions this church was in for the space of years and seeing a septenary number is a mystical number whether or no this doth not seem to be adapted to the mystery of the seven spirits stars or angels

quest

who are we to understand by the seven angels of the seven churches whether are they presidents or pastors or angels properly so called having distinct administrations over those churches for it appears from and other places of scripture that they were set over kingdoms and nations as god`s vicegerents
why not then over churches

seeing they are call'd mitng sent out to minister all those who shall be heirs of salvation

and heb
it is unto the angels he hath not as put in subjection the world to come
whether or no this doth not intimate that this present world is subject to angels but the world to come only subject to god and christ and lastly seeing the kingdoms of this world have their ages and periods of time the church will likewise have her ages and periods
and why may not peculiar angels be understood to preside and govern in particular ages of the church appointed and ordained by the most high to execute that function

chap

quest

whether or no the interval of the church

of ephesus according to the will not contain years from the resurrection of christ and in like manner the church of smyrna the same and so understand the rest except the church of concerning which it may be

whether it doth belong to the interval of the church of philadelphia for in respect of its state and condition iohn gave an excellent description it extends to the sabbath of the world
then whether the church of laodicea will have the same interval of time with it it be not the same with the said church but widely different from it who are to be understood by the church of laodicea but certain professours of the christian religion having a great notion and profession of the truth but possessing in a manner nothing of the life and power of it and doth not this clearly appear from the signification of the words and for philadelphia signifies the love of the brethren including certain christian virtues but laodicea imports as much as popular justice which for the most part is in a manner none at furthermore by the same reason whole interval of two thousand years may be distributed into six equal whereof each will contain years and of a year
whether is it not more consentaneous to reason that those intervals of the churches be equally divided if the historical events of them do better agree with these equal intervals or distances than with others that are unequal

quest

do not the names of the seven churches symbolically some certain marks and properties of the said churches and whether or no that term or title of asia signifies only that part of the world so called or rather the whole globe of the earth or visible world which by some learned men is call'd asia from the hebrew root gnasa that is he made as from those superiour worlds iezirah briah and aziluth so call'd all which names of to be found in scripture

quest

whether or no the name title or character of the church

of ephesus doth not properly agree to the state of the church from the time of christ's to the year of his ascension which is the three hundred and sixth year

from his nativity for some render the word in latin desiderabilis desirable or amabilis lovely and certainly such was the primitive church from days of the apostles or as others read it remittens relaxatus importing to and as the holy ghost complains in iohn their first love for quickly the days the love of many waxed cold yet in many that church

was to be commended as in their works labour and patience not giving toleration to evil men nor such who boasted that they were apostles but were not when they came to the tryal

quest

was not that threat of the lord against them clearly fulfilled in the following the interval of years and that unless they did timely repent the lord himself would shortly come and remove their candlestick from them for in many places where christianity flourished heretofore in the next and succeeding intervals there was scarce any visible profession of it to be seen
for the same places where anciently the christian religion flourished were afterwards under the power and dominion of foul and abominable heathenism and mahometism

quest

and doth not the name title or character of the church

of smyrna aptly agree to the state of the church from the year since christs resurrection unto the year

now smyrna in latin signifies myrrh and truly the small number of the faithful and sincere were as may so say in comparison of the vast multitude of false and unsound christians that swarmed in the following interval

like unto a handful of myrrh as well retaining their own purity as serving to purifie others and keeping themselves from the height of corruption and uncleanness
and altho the state of this church happened in an exceeding bad and most corrupt age in of the former yet was the said blamed in nothing but commded for her works and is said to be ri notwithstanding her poverty and tribulation
for god mightily comforted and her under her afflictions that she was to undergo and foretells her the ten days of tribulations which he would bring upon her and that satan should cast some of them into prison
and here also the lord hath plainly painted out this false church that arose in this second interval saying know their blasphemy who said they were jews and are not but of the synagogue of satan

quest

what was meant by those ten days of tribulation which this church was to undergo are they ten natural or common days or rather ten certain times or days of persecution for the time of persecution is commonly called a day wherein that scorching sun of the persecutors arises
and lastly what are those

undefined span duplicate

undefined span duplicate

ten days of persecution for indeed it is commonly affirmed that there were ten persecutions which disquieted the church within years after christ`s resurrection and seeing they for the most part followed one another hence it is they rather merit the name of one continued persecution than ten but in the second interval to wit from the year to after christ's resurrection the church enjoyed some bright and glorious intervals and had a time of respit peace and tranquility and that too under the shelter and protection of certain pious kings and emperours such as were theodosius the first and the and others yet this church suffered many sharp persecutions in this second interval by heathen kings and partly by infected with the arrian and heresies
and what added most to the weight of her was that she was to feel a far more grievous persecution under the christians so called than she had suffered in the former interval under the heathens
moreover if any hath or will take the pains to read the of this ecclesiastical interval and especially lucas oandrus alstedius or any other ancient writer he will find that ten very considerable persecutions the

church truly happen'd in this interval
and if any more were found to have happen'd in certain particular places or to private persons may be referred to the ten whereby the number will be the compleat

quest
doth not the name and of the church of

pergamus seem to agree well enough the third interval of the from the year after resurrection

to the year for as pergamus was metropolis or chief city of asia abounding with lofty towers and magnificent buildings so in the third interval the outward and visible face of the church seemed exceeding high and stately in of peace and the popes of rome became very proud and insomuch that it was at that time made no less than a capital crime to their authority yea and some put to death for it
also in the same interval there were divers popes who were magicians and necromancers and it might be well that satan fixed his at rome or in the roman ch signified by the church of pergamus where antipas was slain and is not the whole number of the faithful witnesses of god under the figure of antipas

who either in this or the succeeding intervals were put to death for opposing the antichristian tyranny and ambition of the popes as the word antipas seems plainly to intimate

quest

and was not the idolatry and spiritual of this third interval wherein the adoration of images and worshipping of saints was by the popes of rome but especially by the second nicaean council predicted in these words which were to the church of pergamus ch

thou hast there such as hold the doctrin of balaam who taught balak to an offence before the people of israel that they should things offered to idol and commit fornication also thou hast such as the doctrin of the which have abhorred and indeed within this interval there did not only mightily abound the spiritual fornication of idolatry and superstition but carnal and corporal also for then the popes and priests of the church matrimony

quest

was that hidden promised to those that overcame in this interval unless it was designed for the state of the church then fled into the wilderness or a solitary place for as god in times past the in

the outward wilderness with manna from heaven when the means of obtaining outward bread was wanting so doth god promise to feed his people in this third interval with his hidden manna which is the word of life in their hearts which be largely communicated to them when they shall not have the liberty hearing the faithful of christ
moreover why in the first interval was it promised to those that overcame to partake fruit of the tree of life in the of paradise but because in this first interval the kingdom of god was manifestly and clearly laid open like the coelestial paradise the church of god also flourished in this interval like the said in the middle whereof christ the tree of brought forth in the hearts of the faithful his most amiable and fruits of divine life
in the second interval by reason of the great apostasie of the of the christn this paradise of god was absconded and hidden and nevertheless it was promised to such as overcame that they should not be hurt by the second death which by inverting the words is all one as to say they should eat of the fruit of the tree life therefore was a promise made unto them that they should not be hurt by the

second death because in this interval the greatest part of christians so called by reason of their apostacy from the primitive purity were to suffer the punishment of the second death

quest

doth not the name or character of the church of

of thyatira with the church within the fourth interval to wit from the year of resurrection to the year

now thyatira signifies a sacrifice of labour and indeed this church is commended for her works her charity faith and and the latter exceeded the former which praise or commendation certainly was only applicable to a small number of the in the said interval which lay hid as a little wheat in a great heap of chaff or as a little gold is hid in much dross
and was not the and superstition of this age which more abounded in this than in the ages plainly foretold in the viz that the church of thyatira permitted this woman call'd iezabel who call'd her self a prophetess to teach which indeed did seduce the servants of god to commit and to eat things oered to idols

now what may we understand by the woman iezabel except it be the universal body of false teachers and preachers who taught the people their foul and abominable superstition and idolatry to wit the adoration of images worshipping of saints angels and men departed and tho divers in many places did protest and contend against such impieties nevertheless many winked too much at it and tolerated those things yea imitated others therein for and they that bare witness against such things remained nevertheless in society with those that committed them for the most part neither did they distinguish and separate themselves them as they ought and therefore are polluted by them and so made partakers with them in their sins

quest

wherefore in this fourth is the morning star promised to such as shall overcome and power over the nations to rule them with a rod of iron and to break them in pieces like a potters vessel unless it were to signifie that the obscure and long expected ruin and destruction of antichristian darkness which had the earth for almost ye draws towards a for three quarters of the night as it were three watches were then elapsed and there remained but one fourth

part to come
and even as the morning star appears in the east before the rising of the sun bringing the good tidings of the approaching day so there was a divine morning star given according to the promise of the blessed god made to the faithful within this interval touching mundane affairs many of whom of this day and of the approaching glory of the lord which was to be revealed
and and ruptures nations happened in the following interval occasioned by horrible and bloody wars the history of our present times do partly and partly what we have seen with our eyes do clearly enough demonstrate and more will follow in a short time which clashings and ruptures of nations are not to be imputed to any carnal sword which the faithful servants of god shall use for the faithful will in no wise use a sword or carnal power for the power and might of god in his faithful saints together with their light and life which they shall in a full degree exert will it and confound the world and worldly men and raise them up one against another and hence it is that great and terrible wars shall the larger of divine light and knowledge

signifies as much as a precious stone of a flesh colour now was not the churches reformation which began about the year of christ's nativity hereby describ'd and doth not the flesh colour of this stone evidently declare unto us that church call'd the reformed church had in her too much flesh or too much of a fleshly nature and would be for the most part more of a carnal than of a spiritual nature and more in the profession of the truth than in the real possession of it
and therefore it is argued she hath a name that she lives and yet is dead and that her works were not perfect before god however there are some few who are said not to have defiled their garments and to them the lord has promised they shall walk with him in white because they are worthy but the publick and visible reformation of the church began about the year of christ's resurrection which was from the year of his nativity

for then was iohn wickliffe an of oxford raised up who preached against the corruptions of the romish church and about

the year followed him iohn huss amd ierom of prague
now the said iohn wickliffe translated the holy bible into the english tongue and wrote many books against the pope to the number of two hundred as it is reported whose books after they came into germany became instrumental thro god's blessing to the enlightning of many so that their hearts and minds were more opened to enquire after and search out the truth and especially ierome and huss
about

the year
charles the called the wise king of france caused the holy scriptures to be translated into the vulgar tongue and he also wrote against the pope
moreover tis affirmed that wickliff ierom and huss restored the doctrin of the waldenses
these waldenses were so called from one waldo of lyons in france who began to teach the people and open the scriptures unto them who notwithstanding was no priest neither had received any outward authority but was only a and as to his manner of life a merchant

and these waldenses appear'd about the year who were succeeded by the albigenses a people inhabiting near the alpes about the

year professing the same doctrin with the waldenses and therefore these waldenses and albigenses belong to the chiefest to wit the fourth interval
and those among them who were of the most sincerity were describ'd under the name of those of the church of thyatira to whom the morning star was promised
again the said ierom and huss were succeeded by luther

about the year who began to teach and preach against the indulgences of pope leo which were exposed to sale and a little after that he disputed against many other principles of the roman church and religion and many others followed and accompanied him every one in his order with a greater evidence and authority of light and truth whose true testimonies except some certain errors which they were guilty of as men are to be held in great esteem and principally theirs who for the love of the truth in england scotland france germany and other were slain and martyrdom within the said interval

will not that happy millennium or age of a thousand years begin within this church's interval for it seems to be clearly enough hinted in the promise made to those that overcome in this interval viz god will write upon them name of god and the name of the city of god viz new ierusalem which shall descend from heaven and therefore is not the state of the as before was said contemporary with this church and happening at the same of time the one describing as well the true as of christianity the other only the naked and titular


are

they not extremely mistaken who ink it out the degenerating state of the after the expiration of

a thousand years when it plainly appears from scripture that after the church shall be once restored and freed from apostacy that it shall never fall from the truth into delinquency or apostasy any more and then also the same promise is given to such as are truly penitent and whose hearts are kindled with the zeal of divine love in the church of laodicea as was given to those of the church of philadelphia to wit that such as are conquerors also in the laodicean church shall sit down with christ upon his throne which is equivalent in all respects to that felicity promised to all the faithful in the millennium

what are those faces of beas whereof every one is to have viz the face of a bull on the and the face a man and a lyon on the right side a last of all the face an do not these faces signifie the souls or lives of men deriv'd from the four as the om asia tó ruach from tó nischmah from briah tó chaja from aziluth now nephesh or seems to be that of ruh

by a lyon nischmah by a man and lastly chaja by an eagle
and are they said to be four but by reason of those faces moreover what is to be understood by the wheels

of those four beasts doth not each wheel signifie the revolution of some age
for the hebrew word gilgal which is rendered rota in latin in english a wheel is translated by the hebrews revolutio or revolution therefore will not the aforesaid revolution of an age contain a thousand years which is one day taken according to psal
and pet

for what is a day more than the revolution of the sun in the space of hours and because according to the psal before cited a thousand years are as a watch of the night and every night contained watches and every watch hours therefore doth not the whole night contain years and each hour one third part of a thousand that is

therefore will not the wheels contain thousand years as also why are they call'd watches is it every one of those in their proper hours is excited and as it were in every respective watch

wherefore are there said to be the number of elders doth not this number respect the patriarchs who were to remain as junctures or seams of the ancient church together with the apostles who are likewise the junctures or uniting bands of the evangelical church to signify the highest and strictest union of both churches under one head the lord jesus christ for as tis said there are great junctures connexions in the body of man and small ones with which perhaps the disciples under the gospel do correspond and souls of the house of iacob under the law who came into egypt from whom afterwards so vast a multitude of people arose

what may we understand by the book

sealed with seven seals which was in his hand who sat on the throne whether the knowledge of great events to come to pass in world from the time of christ's ascension to the end of the world even as other parts of sacred writ do either historically or prophetically declare unto us all the great events and transactions past from adam unto christ

quest
why doth iohn distinguish the seals in that order

that immediately follow one another the sixth seems to reach to the sabbath of the world but the seventh proceeds in an other order as comprehending the half hours silence and the intervals the trumpets

hath he not designedly and purposely done it to show us that the seventh seal doth not entirely follow the other six signifies a new order from christs to the end of the world or

years therefore do not the intervals of the six seals divide the said space of years into six equal parts whereof each will contain and thus indeed the six seals will denote the same intervals of time with the seven churches aforementioned and so make a synchronism for most confess that there were divers visions in this book which were synchronical or happen'd at one and the same time represented by distinct visions even as those seven years of famine in egypt was proposed to the king in two visions altho the said visions happen'd in the same intervals of time yet many of them were attended with different consequences others with very events as will appear from the ensuing

quest

wherefore did iohn say at the opening of every of the first seals that he heard one of the beasts say

come and see except it were to shew us that the interval of every seal the seventh only excepted comprehends the space of a mystical hour viz years for is not the face of some animal stirr'd up or awaken'd in every mystical hour which may be therefore said to be on the watch vide come and

quest

if the events which were to come to pass and are in great measure elapsed from the time of our lord's ascension

to this present day do better answer to the intervals of years assigned to each of the first six seals than to any other whatsoever doth not this elegantly prove the truth of the said intervals

quest

what may we understand by iohn vision of a white horse and him that sat thereon who held a bow in his hand and went out at the opening of the fst seal conquering and to conquer is not he

that sat thereon our lord jesus christ and doth not the

white horse mean ministers arayed in the white robes of righteousness and inward holiness bringing the gospel unto men viz the glad tidings

and doth not the bow in his hand signify the power and energy of his gospel and doctrine which gospel indeed in those primitive times conquer`d many thousands of men and subjected them to the obedience and faith of christ

and moreover did not this and exceeding prevalent dispensation of the gospel remain on earth at least the space of years and after lords's ascension or from his carnation which interval indeed reacht and his

sons nay beyond iulian the apostate iordan valens valentinian and indeed the power and purity of the evangelical doctrin did still prevail in the world notwithstanding the sottish superstitions foolish traditions and wrangling debates of some concerning arrius and his disciples

quest

what may we understand by iohn vision of a red horse

at the opening of the second

seal is it not soldiers and captains of armies and such as stir up terrible wars in the world to the shedding much blood and who is he that rides upon this red horse

but some great angel or daemon who by god's permission inspires and prompts men to bloody wars which wars doubtless came chiefly in those parts of the world where the gospel had been preached and were sent by the most god as a just punishment on men for dispising the gospel
and indeed they who delivered the faithful servants of god to various kinds of death in the first interval because they believed in god and christ are slain themselves together with their children by others in the second interval god punishing the iniquity of the fathers the children even to the third and

fourth generation
besides do not the events or historical effects plainly answer to this second interval to wit from the year of our saviour christ's resurrection to the or from the year of his birth to the year for within that interval of time was not the whole empire miserably torn and at last almost totally erased and in the said interval moreover also rome her self as it were empress of the world was often taken and after some revolutions she was burnt within the same interval the chief authors of these terrible wars the vandals hunnes and persians with kings and leaders
then about the latter end of this interval viz about and odd years after the birth of christ comes with his who were at that time call'd saracens and these indeed were the authors of dreadful in many places

what to be understood by iohn vision of a black

and him that sat thereon holding a balance in his hand when the third seal was to be opened is not famine hereby signified and indeed that which is natural as well as that which is internal and indeed both

these compleatly happened within the third interval of time to wit from the year of christ's resurrection to the year as the history of those times do clearly evince for in this interval there was a great spiritual or want of the celestial bread of life and the time of this interval was the same with that of the church of pergamus above recited within which interval god promised to feed the with hidden manna rev
for all that whole interval was full of ignorance in the extremity of darkness and very few famous men flourished in it
lastly as to what pertains to natural or outward famine that indeed in a manner continually attends horrid and bloody wars

quest

what is meant by the

horse and him that sate thereon whose name was death whom hell followed having power to kill with the sword with famine and with death and with the of the earth which was to come to pass when the seal

was opened doth it not seem to be the whole and entire body of all the wick that have gone before with addition of many others for what doth the killing with the sword signifie but and famine and was death which was the

name of him that sat thereon the himself whom hell followed lastly what is signified by the beasts of the but foul and unclean spirits or terrestrial demons which miserably beguile and deceive the ignorant and unthinking mobile with their cheats and delusions for in holy writ the devil and unclean spirits are called beasts of the field or beasts of the earth as it is said of the serpent in genesis that he was more subtile than any beast of the field which doubtless could not be understood of common beasts
moreover doth not the event or historical effect apparently answer this viz from the year

christ's resurrection to the year within which time the foulest superstitions and most detestable idolatry abounded among christians falsly so called also the pride covetousness and luxury of the antichristian clergy within this interval exceeded all bounds besides many damnable opinions and were preached and published by the emissaries to wit the several orders of scholars and students called by the name of monks and friars which were received and believed on by the ignorant multitude as so many divine oracles moreover also the locus

that ascended out of the bottomless pit seem to belong to this interval of time of which hereafter in its proper place

now these two last intervals to wit the third and the fourth seem to have a very near relation and affinity one to another in respect of ignorance blindness idolatry superstition and many other abominable evils
yet the fourth interval was not so destitute of good men nor so full of ignorance and darkness as the third for in the fourth interval god raised up some eminent and famous men as were bernardus clarevallensis and malachias also the waldenses and albigenses with whom do agree those of the church of thyatira
moreover also in this very interval began the turkish empire when their captains or calaphi were constituted emperors over them who were miraculously strong in many parts of the world and the first of these was ottoman

quest

what are those effects or events that happen when the fifth seal is opened and what may be principally understood by them are they not the souls of such as were slain for the word of god and the testimony which they bore whom iohn saw under the altar meaning the souls of all that were slain for their

firm and constant profession of the true faith from the beginning of the world to the time of the fifth interval viz unto the year of resurrection and why did they desire of god so earnestly that he would revenge their blood upon the dwellers on earth was it because the justice of god is as well glorified in revenging as his mercy is in pitying and forgiving and was it not also because they knew that the time when the blood of the righteous that were slain should be revenged upon the ungodly was to be joyned with that time in which all the righteous were to receive an hundred fold reward which christ promised them in the first resurrection when they should be restored and raised to life again now why it should stand with god's justice to revenge the blood of those that were slain for many ages past not only three or four generations as in deut but more than an hundred generations ago upon the inhabitants of the earth who are not as yet born or in being upon the earth is a question that demands a clear explanation

quest

wherefore was it said to those souls that they should rest viz under the altar and was not that altar christ until the number of their brethren yet to be slain should be fulfilled and doth not this fifth interval that there shall come a time of much and

to the servants and people of god and that many shall be put to death within this interval in a manner during the whole space from the year of christ's resurrection to the year or from the year of his nativity to the year
and hath not this happen'd so in reference to the time past of this interval and is it probable that near the same number of good christians were slain by the papists turks from the year to this present day viz from the days of iohn wickliff as were heretofore slain from christ's resurrection to the aforesaid term of years and whereas there yet remain some odd years of the said interval to be fulfilled some think others and again other some viz from the year to the true year of christ's nativity whether or no we are not yet to expect more tribulations and persecutions will come upon the servants of god till the said year


but the fifth interval being expired whose end draws nigh may we not expect the true church will enjoy some serene interval and time of rest and tranquility until the and greatest but shortest under the seventh head of the beast not as yet fully to be accomplish'd till about the year

quest

what are those effects or events which must be fulfilled in the world the sixth seal is opened that great the sun darkned the moon like blood the stars falling from the heavens rolled up like a scroll mountains and islands passing away not all these things clearly signifie the and downfall of every unjust ungodly and tyrannical government and whatsoever that so at last the of holiness and righteousness may be up and established and god and his chri rule and govern by the holy ghost in hearts of men in every nation of world and is not this thing plainly signied by iohn him self in his following words and will not the time of this interval the opening of the sixth seal contain common space of the year of christ's resurction to

the year wherein god will fully rvenge the blood of his servants that we slain and are now in heaven above the dwellers on earth and so the and petitions of the souls that cried the altar in the former interval will be aswered but some the of sixth seal to time and this do without any authority for it appe

quest

do not those other events and effects which will be produc'd at the opening of the sixth seal plainly demonstrate that the sixth seal will reach even to the years sabbath of the world what are the which were sealed in their foreheads from every tribe of the children of israel are they not the first fruits of the saints who attain the first resurrection from the dead in the future millennium and finally are not the the same with those mentioned in the
chapter moreover are they not really israelites as to their race or stock being taken from every tribe of israel altho many other of the israelitish race together with many other of the servants of god shall hereafter receive the same reward and felicity of the resurrection and again what is that great multitude of all nations tongues and people which no man could number standing before the throne and the which were cloath'd

in white garments and bore palms in their hands are they not all the saints raised to life again within the sixth interval not only those who lived in the preceding intervals since christ's resurrection but even all that have ever lived since the beginning of the world who came out of great tribulation which they suffered in their preceding lives but then they shall never hunger nor thirst any more neither shall the sun or the heat thereof touch them for the lamb who is in the midst of the throne shall feed them and lead them to fountains of living water and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and doth not this state belong to that place in the revelations ch and and are not both states the same both that which is here and that which is there described which will be the state of such as have attained to the resurrection before described

quest

wherefore is that number which is the of every tribe of israel distinguished from that great as well of iews as of other nations who shall hereafter obtain the same kind of reward is it because those rev
are the rst fruits who will have the chiefest place in the first resurrection of the dead and after the first fruits will follow a great multitude of god's elect

of all nations every one in his order as it shall please god to ordain it according to the determination of his infinite wisdom for doth not paul say positively that every one shall be raised in his own order and therefore all are not to be raised up or recall'd unto life at once even as men now do not come into the world all at once but in a successive order one after another according to their proper generations best of all known to god

quest

will not all the saints of god or first fruits prophesyed of and all others that follow aferwards attain this first resurrection from the dead within the sixth interval viz from the year after christ's resurrection to the year and so all live compleatly years after their first resurrection before the end of the world the whole age of the world containing years
whereas if any of them should be raised before the sixth interval the end of the world would come before that age a years which they were to live which is contrary to the scriptures
and was not this mystery prefigured by the sabbath under the law which began in the evening or in the latter part of the sixth day and which was also shadowed out by the manna which was to be gathered on the

sixth day but on the seventh day it was unlawful to gather any manna

quest
who are those four angels whom iohn saw standing on the four corners of the earth to whom power was given to hurt the earth and the sea which yet they could not do till that number was sealed are they not angels in a proper sence to whom power is given from god to execute his most holy and righteous judgments on the earth

and may not those corners of the earth peradventure signifie four parts of the world ex gr asia europe africa and america whereof each may have his angel and what are those four winds or spirits which the four angels aforesaid withheld

by which restriction the earth was to be hurt whether or no by these four winds or spirits good angels may not be meant and by the first evil angels and thus doth it not appear that different parts of the world have their proper as well good as evil attending them one contending against another the good to benefit men the evil to injure them even as men have lived either well or ill and are not these good or bad angels sent and appointed as guardians and governours over them

quest

what is to be understood by that half hours

silence and by those seven trumpets which the seven angels sounded successively at the opening of the seventh seal moreover whether or no the seventh seal might not begin at christ's resurrection for otherwise would not the seven woes and of the trumpets happen in that most blessed age the sabbath of the world which is very absurd and contrary to the words of scripture in the revelations when as

the seventh trumpet will bring us unto the years reign of the saints as is very evident from revel chap

and will not every trumpet have an equal and distinct interval of time which seven intervals of the trumpets and half hours silence added together do they not make up years from the resurrection of christ

now if it appears from the best computed chronology that the seventh trumpet commences at the year of christ's resurrection and reaches to the year after his resurrection so as to contain the space of years and will not every

one of the seven trumpets contain the same space fo years viz and so the whole time of the trumpets will contain years which substracted from the remainder will be the number of years that ought to make up the half hours silence

and it was upon a good reason that iohn said that space of silence was as it were half an hour for he did not term it a precise or just half hour for a precise or mystical half hour is because an intire mystical hour is but this term of year exceeds that precise half hour by common years which are of small moment viz about two minutes and a little more

quest

do not the effects or historical events compleatly concur with the aforesaid intervals of the semihorary silence and the trumpet for if to that time of silence which lasted as it were half an hour we add years from chri's resurrection

which from his nativity makes may not all that time be call'd a time silence as to the inward state of the church tho she did suffer some persecution outwardly for within that time did not the angel offer much incense with the prayers of

saints as iohn declared notwithstanding the hard debates that arose about the year between certain bishops about the time of celebrating the passeover for that was in a manner little or nothing in comparison of those great calamities which afterwards invaded the very heart of the church
and within the space of years after the birth of christ there was a time of great inward peace and tranquility among true christians even when they were outwardly pressed with grievous persecution and in those days there was a signal zeal of piety and devotion and their prayers flowed from the assisted by the holy ghost witness who lived at that time therefore those dead and empty forms of drawn from books and appointed to be was not as yet known to the church

quest

what may we underand by the hail

and fire mixt with blood and sent the earth at the sound of the first trumpet doth not the fire and hail signifie great strife and contention that arose among the members of the church within this interval which indeed did very much injure and prejudice the tender branches of celestial and divine life among christians as iohn said the third part of the

trees were consumed with fire and all the green

grass was burnt up now by the

trees are not the stronger and as it were christians to be understood and by the grass such as are more feeble and unsound and how exactly do these predictions agree with the first interval of the seven trumpets viz from the year of christ's nativity to the year

for how miserably during all this time was the church afflicted with the debates and controversies of divers bishops and presbyters that erred from the true faith of christ such as were novatus sabellius samosatenus

manes arrius donatus macedonius apollinaris pelagius nestorius eutyches all these were so many principal authors of sects and heresies within this interval whose heresies and false opinions wherewith they broke the peace of the church would be too tedious here to recite

and was it not fire mixt with blood when many of those sects and heresies killed others call'd christians and their brethren with the sword

quest

what ought we to understand by the great

mountain cast into the sea by which the third part of the sea turn'd

into blood within the interval of the second

trumpet from the year to the year doth not this apparently signifie the defection and apostasie of many the christian faith which seemed like some great mountain as the roman church was at that time and behold how this great mountain burns with the fire of envy and malice and tumbles into the sea and turns the third part thereof into blood involving a great part of the roman empire in destruction war and as indeed it out for in the greatest part of this interval much blood was spilt insomuch that rome was burnt and pillag'd about the year by totila and all italy about that time was miserably wasted and destroyed by the goths and lombards are not all these most just punishments by god on the roman church for their apostasie and that she lifted her self above all other churches and set up her bishops above all other bishops of the world and this proud usurpation of the roman bishops over others quickly began after the days of zosimus boniface the first and the first who assumed to themselves this and authority over their brethren a little than years after the birth

of christ yet could not absolutely obtain it untill the year when boniface the third was constituted the first universal bishop over all churches by the authority of phocas who killed his master the emperor mauritius and by villainy assumed his place

quest

what may we understand by the great star

falling from heaven on the rivers of water and turning the waters into wormwood within the interval of the third trumpet viz
from the year to the year was it not a greater degree of apostasie the great star that fell from heaven on the signifying some evil angel inspiring the doctors and preachers of the roman church with the worst and most pernicious doctrines which doctrines certainly were like to wormwood for and did not this evidently come to pass at what time the bishops and doctors of the roman church eagerly preach'd up the pope's supremacy and jurisdiction above all other bishops likewise they set up and established a multitude of humane traditions as masses to be said for the dead that men should be confin'd by an oath or a vow to a monastical life that priests ought not to marry with many more of the like nature

besides also within this interval the popes and bishops of rome did mightily promote the adoration and worship of images and thus not without great reason was the third part of the waters said to be turn'd into wormwood and it is affirmed that many dyed by drinking those bitter waters

but some there were preserv'd alive who did not drink of those bitter waters but of the pure water of the word of eternal life and sound doctrine and indeed these were the witnesses of god in those corrupt times such as were adelbertus a clement and samson with sundry others in divers kindoms and provinces of the world

quest

how must we understand that the third part of the sun moon and stars were smitten within the interval of the fourth trumpet viz
from the year to the year doth not this signifie that the grandure and majesty of emperors and christian kings should be very much eclipsed within this interval and did not this certainly come to pass when the pope challeng'd to himself and proudly usurp'd power and authority over divers emperors kings and princes in the whole christian vvorld and indeed obtained it gregory the seventh

fourth trumpet

quest

what may we understand by the star that

fell from heaven to the earth within the interval of the fifth trumpet to which was given the key of the bottomless pit and the bottomless was opened there arose a smoake from thence
and what may be thought the meaning of the locusts proceeding from the smoak upon the earth is not this some evil angel or genius to whom permission was given to open the infernal pit it self whereby he set at liberty a great multitude of lying and seducing spirits and sent em into the world to deceive all such as had not the seal of god in their foreheads and doth not this interval or state of affairs very aptly agree with that vast multitude of scholars and orders of monks that mightily swarm'd within this interval to wit from the year of christ to the year and most intolerably vex'd and tormented the conscience of many with the pungent stings and thorns of their and of rank were thomas aquinas bonaventure henricus gandavensis
iohn of paris iohn dun a durandus occamus with many others who lived within this interval

for tho some notable sayings may be found among them yet were they miserably deceived in many other things by unclean spirits and daemons and wherefore are those locusts said to have faces as it were the faces of men but to signifie the subtilty of wit which seemed to be in them and finally what do their hairs like the hairs of women denote is it not that perswasive way of reasoning by which they draw to themselves and whereas they had teeth as it were the teeth of lyons this intimates that they were like lyons in fierceness to destroy and tear in pieces all that dissented from them

quest

wherefore is it said that there was power given to these locusts not to kill men but only to torment them with their stings is it not hereby meant that these locusts were not soldiers that fought themselves with a carnal weapon but only certain orders of scholars monks and friars who with their ambiguous and disputations miserably divided and the souls and consciences of men insomuch that it is said that it should come to pass in those days men should seek death and not find it and should to die and should from them

quest

why is it said these locusts have power to hurt men five months

doth it to the usual time of their or rather unto certain mystery for we are to that those locusts were to parts of the whole me wherein the mystery of iquity was to prevail viz even as it were to the end of trumpet which contains interval of two trumpets


what are those which were loosed at river euphrates

the interval of the sixth trumpet viz from the year of christ's to the year are they certain powerful angels or guardians over the provinces of earth bordering on the and what are those number whereof was twenty thousand mes ten thousand are they not turks these inhabit the provinces situated the river euphrates who within the xth interval under which we now are viz om the year powerfully invaded the third part of the eastern hemihere and slew many thousands of christians

so called for indeed they were not all true christians which be said to be the third part of men
and are not the guns which the turks used in their wars against the christia described which being but of a invention were found out before the of the sixth trumpet which kill men with fire brimstone and smoak seeming to flow out of the horses tho it proceeds from the mouths of the guns again do not these horses allegorically signifie empire and dominion and whereas the best part of the interval of this sixth trumpet is not as yet begun neither will end till the year if therefore those christians tho falsly so call'd do not repent must they not expect a stroak and a more fatal blow from those armies of and such as guilty of abominable idolatry and worship devils and idols of gold silver brass stone and wood as chap

belong unto the sixth trumpet or some part thereof and whereas iohn manded to conceal what the seven had uttered will it not be presumption for any one to reveal it before its due time for can any one unfold them before they are vealed

what is that court without the temple which iohn at his coming shall leave out and measure it not but is to be given to the gentiles are not the lukewarm of the church of laodicea signified by it lastly what are those gentiles or nations

to whom this outward court is to be given are they not turks or other heathenish people to whom permission shall be given miserably to afflict those carnal and meerly titular christians and that too in a manner over the whole world after which god shall gather together his elect and faithful servants from that mass of hypocrites

quest

what is that holy city to be trodden under foot by the gentiles for

the of forty two months and how are those months to be understood whether properly or mystically as some think is not this holy city the true church of god purely reformed and purged from all antichristian pollutions which is signified by philadelphia moreover will not the iews and israelites after their conversion to the christian faith make up a good part of this church of philadelphia and who peradventure will have a great or it may be the chiefest share in these sufferings and the months belong unto the interval of the sixth trump as is evident from the revelations is it not impossible for those months to signifie so many years as there are days contain'd in all the months viz
whereas the whole interval of the sixth trumpet contains but years again if those months should contain years they would certainly make this great persecution to be inflicted on the church within the seventh of the world which is very absurd therefore are not those months to be understood of common months making up three years and an half which indeed is a short but a sharp time in which will happen the last persecution the church shall ever undergo and doth not daniel at the

end of the eleventh chapter and beginning of the eighteenth plainly touch upon the manner of this prsecution and will not the chief author of this persecution be that king describ'd daniel

to the end of the chapter whom iohn in his revelations calleth the seventh king yet to come and it is said of him when he comth that he shall remain but a short time

quest

what are those two witnesses cloath'd in sackcloth who shall prophesie during the whole time of the last persecution days shl they not be moses and elias raised up to live again in a body upon earth and is not this clearly enough hinted in these words of iohn ch
viz that they shall have power to shut up heaven

that it shall not rain in the days of their pophecy as they did in times past and to turn the waters into blood and to smite the earth with plagues as often as they even as moses did heretofore

quest

and why should it be thought incredible that moses and elias should come again into the world when as it sufficiently appears from scripture as well from the book of revelations as from other places of scripture that all the saints shall come again into the world within the millennium

and whereas iohn says isralites were to be the fir
fruits of this kingdom and glorious state will not moses and elias belong unto those first fruits as touchi
elias did not christ elias should come or that he came and restored after the iohn the baptist whom he called and finally why were moses and elias with chri in the at his transfiguration before he had suffer'd death was it not to signifie that they should be nearest to christ and the very next after him who should obtain the resurrection from the dead and in like manner ascend into heaven unto him

quest

shall not those two prophets be really slain and suffer a corporal death as christ really did and after three days and an half shall they not rise again from the dead even as christ arose on the third day and why should men betake themselves to a allegoral sense of the words touching the death resurrection of these two witnesses when as the proper and literal sence of the words is sound and contains no absurdity but tends greatly to demonstrate divine glory and omnipotence

quest

what is that great city spiritually call'd sodom and

where also our

lord was crucified wherein the bodies of the witnesses which were slain lay unburied days and an half may not be the place where christ was externally crucified and may not great city be built and stand in the place at that time and may not some great mystery be coucht under it viz
that moses and elias should be slain in the same place where was slain and afterwards to be up again tho they were killed about years apart and it appears from history that elias adrian built there a city upon the mountain to wit golgotha where christ was crucified and call'd it elias but the call'd it ierusalem and so it is call'd to this day now under the power of the turks

that time wherein michael shall stand up for the salvation of the iewish people is joyned with the first resurrection of the dead

quest

vvill not the sound of the seventh trumpet introduce that famous and renouned millennium

and the first resurrection from the dead in its due order viz
from the year of christ's resurrection

to about the year the interval of the seventh and last containing the same number of years as the rest to wit and all the intervals of the seven trumpets together with the half hours silence do comprehend years for multiplyed by produces

to which if the said number as it were of the half hours silence be added the sum is
and do not the words of iohn in chap

manifestly declare that the beginning of the millennium and the first resurrection is to be taken from the beginning of the seventh trumpet for

he saith in the place here cited the seventh angel sounded and there were great in heaven saying the kingdoms of the world are become the kingdoms of our lord and his christ who shall reign for ever and ever read to the end of the and especially verse
and the were angry and thy wrath is and the time of the dead they should be judged and that give reward unto thy the and to thy saints and to them that fear thy name small and great and destroy them that the earth

quest

was not that vision by iohn ch

synchronical or happening at the same interval of time with the aforesaid vision of the half hours silence and the seven trumpets and is not the woman here describ'd the church and her the life of christ or the true spirit christianity brought forth in the or spiritual regeneration and was not this spirit or life of christ most clearly revealed and brought forth in those primitive times for the space of years and more after christ's resurrection and into heaven and is not that great red dragon the devil and are not his seven

heads seven monarchies or kingdoms orderly succeeding each whereof five were elapsed before time and finally doth not the tail of this dragon signifie the false prophets even as that true prophet had said the that teaches lyes is the tail moreover this tail drew the third part of the stars of and cast them on the earth doth not this signifie some great number of professors of the christian religion but of little stability who did not persist or remain in the truth or life of what they professed

quest

what is signified by the woman into the wilderness is it not a solitary and obscure state the church of god shall come into wherein the true champions and defenders of christianity were very much dispersed and as it were in the wilderness or hid in a wood and making but little outward show or appearance and but little obvious to the external observation as it was in the days of elias who thought himself to be left alone but god told him he had who had not bowed the knee to baal

quest

how much is that time of days wherein the woman fled into the wilderness doth it not contain common years for in scripture a day is

sometimes taken for a year in a prophetical or a mystical and doth not experience it and ecclesiastical histories conspicuously demonstrate for some ages back that this and obscure state of the has been continued for above years already past and that by reason of antichristian darkness and tyranny and doth not that time of years expire at the beginning of the interval of the philadelphian church which falls in the year of christ's in the year of his nativity

therefore will not the time of years begin the year of christ's nativity indeed about the same time viz years after christ's nativity the empire almo totally fell together and in the fall of it was into ten empires or kingdoms which are called by iohn the ten horns of the beast and these horns miserably smote the servants of god here and there dispersed



about what time shall michael his angels overcome the dragon and his angels when will that dragon and his angels be cast down to the earth and the saints overcome them in the blood of the lamb and the word of his testimony will not that time be about the end of the

years and that the dragon shall be cast down from heaven unto the earth doth not this signifie that the church is here for heaven and shall enjoy both outward and inward peace and tranquility and be from calamities a considerable time the of years is expir'd and doth not the casting of the dragon down unto the earth signifie his power which he will have over carnal men and such only as are earthly wise whereby he will cause horrid and detestable wars to arise among them and finally will not the church about this time appear going out of the wilderness and satan the accuser of the brethren be cast down that he may not accuse them of heresie sedition and other crimes of the like nature as he hath formerly done moreover shall not this time during which the church shall enjoy outward peace remain for some time as it were about years whilest the remaining part of mortals shall be exceedingly pressed with wars and many and great calamities

quest

and shall not the church after she is return'd of the wilderness and hath for a good season enjoy'd outward peace and tranquility fly the second time into the and is not this second of the church

enough describ'd and wherefore is it said that in her second flight had two wings of an eagle given her unless it be to denote the or swiftness of her flight and return and therefore will the time of this second flight be of a short continuance viz days even as the of her first flight had been long and tedious to wit years whereas both times had consisted of years it would certainly have made the last flight of the church to have happen'd within that most happy age of the world the future millennium which is very absurd moreover is not the time of this second flight viz days the very same with that wherein the two should prophesie cloath'd in sack cloth and the holy city be trodden under foot

quest

what is signified by that where the earth helped the woman and opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth is it not thus to be understood to wit that the flood of the dragon's wrath fell on some other people and those as well heathens and professed as christians falsly so call'd that were only nominal and titular who made war one upon another that so the church might with more ease and facility slip out of the jaws of the dragon

quest

what is that beast which iohn saw arise out of the sea having seven heads and ten doth not this signifie the body of great monarchies whereof heads even then expired iohn time revel

and two remained to come moreover are not those which were already past before iohn time these that is to say the first the egyptian under which the iewish church or israelitish people suffer'd much in times past and therefore the subversion and overthrow of pharaoh and his army in the red sea is call'd in the wounding of the dragon the second the assyrian monarchy under which the ten were put exile the third the babylonish whereof nebuchadnezzar was head who led the other two tribes captive into babylon and destroyed the temple and city of ierusalem the the monarchy of the medes and persians the fifth was the graecian monarchy whose head was alexander call'd the great which five heads or monarchies fell before iohn time therefore is not the sixth head the roman monarchy which in iohn time only remained

quest

now what is the seventh head whose coming iohn foretold is it yet come or is it rather to come how is the eighth head distinguished from the seventh and why doth daniel number no more than four kings and iohn seven doth not the seventh head seem to be some new monarchy which is not as yet come but is now very near under which will fall the last persecution of the church which will be the greatest of all and shall last but three years and an half and therefore it is said it shall continue but a short time lastly is not the eighth head one of the seven and only in certain circumstances and one of the ten of the beast which will at length prevail over other horns according to daniel
and whereas daniel numbers four kings and iohn reckons two was it not because daniel looked no than nebuchadnezzar but iohn to the first king of all that the of god and this was pharaoh king of egypt and why should these seven monarchies be called one beast but because tho these men were personally distinct in such and such ages of the world yet were they acted by one and the same spirit to the church

quest

doth not iohannes in his treatise of the four monarchies truly distinguish and the number of the ten kingdoms which iohn call'd the horns of the beast into the which the roman monarchy was at last divided in the following order syria egypt asia greece affrica spain france italy germany brittaine and why is it said that those ten horns or kings in iohn time had received no kingdom chap
but had power given them as kings with the beast for the space one hour was it not because for the space of a mystical hour or years aer time those kings were not to have a distinct but a power to reign with the beast but after the expiration of that hour the ten kings aforesaid arose up having their kingdoms divided and as it were pluckt by from the roman monarchy and these indeed did more vehemently persecute the church of god

quest

what is to be by that passage where one of the heads of the seven beasts is said to be smitten with a mortal wound and was made whole again may not this that the emperors received this wound after the empire was transferr'd from the heathens to then that

spirit of persecution that dwelt in the preceding emperors was afflicted as it were with a mortal wound some considerable time as appears in the case of constantine the great the first christian emperor who granted to all liberty of conscience and suddenly after constantine his successor under the name and of christianity as severely persecuted the true servants of god as the heathen emperors had done before in this respect may it not be truly said that the deadly wound of the beast was healed again when the of persecution had recovered fresh strength in new christian emperors so called

quest

what a those months in which wer is given the beast that he should during all that time and make war and overcome them is not the number of yrs to be understood by those months doth not the too certain and ntable experience of the aforesaid ges as appears from history sufficiently prove that this spirit of antichrist flourishing in the christian kings and so called did persecute the true servants of god and faithful followers of christ almost years and is not that space of years almost come to an

end and shall not he that lives to the year of christ or see the total end and period

quest

how are those to be understood chap

he that leads into captivity shall go into and he that kills with the shall be with sword and why are those following words added which run thus here is the faith and of saints for did not a great many persecutors die a natural in their and in their own houses and we have not yet any thing their did he not say this is the patience and of the saints because that judgment was to be fulfilled upon the some long tract of time which how it shall come to pass deserves an explanation which in another place

quest

what is the beast which iohn saw arising out of the for the first beast rose out of the sea having two horns like a lamb but like dragon and exercising all the power of the first beast and why is his id to be and he that is endued with was bid to compute the number is not this the papal power arising out the earth for the popes are very on of a low extraction

and of an inferior race and descent even as the earth is inferior to the sea and other elements and do not his two horns like a lamb plainly denote the twofold authority which the popes pretend is to them to wit both spiritual and temporal and whereas he spoke as a dragon doth not this eminently express the pope's bulls and sentences of excommunications which he thundred out against men of all ranks and degrees that were not obedient to his decrees and from the year of christs nativity

which is from his did not the popes excercise all the power of the first beast advancing and themselves above emperors and all kings and making them instruments and ministers of his wrath and malice against the elect servants of god and whereas tis said he had power to give life to the image of the beast what else can be hereby but that the popes have snatched all their power and authority from the emperors and settled it upon themselves leaving in a manner nothing but a kind of an image or shadow of an empire for it is manifest that from the time the beast arose the christian kings and emperors derived all the life and power they had to rule or command from the beast to the

pope
for whereas anciently the popes where dependent on the emperors after the popes were arrived to that greatness the emperors became dependent on the popes
moreover doth not this papal number point out so many years

which signifie two mystical hours or revolutions beginning at the year of christs resurrection and ending at the year or at the year of his nativity

and indeed within this time the popes of rome thus advanced themselves above kings and emperors and the first papal usurpation was observed in benedict the ninth who attempted to depose the emperor from his imperial seat and dispose of the crown to whom he pleased about the year of christ's nativity as histories confirm and especially lucas osiander in epitom
hist
eccles
which was afterwards more vigorously followed by gregory the seventh alias hildebrand about the year

and in succeeding ages continued to this day

quest

doth not that number of whom iohn saw upon sion standing with the lamb and singing a new song signifie the same described in the like number chap
who shall be the first fruits of

the first resurrection above cited when they shall be plainly distinguished from the four beast and and twenty because they shall sing a new song before the beasts and elders and none was able to learn that song except the and yet god will most certainly have other faithful servants on at that time tho they cannot as yet learn the aforesaid song which sms to be some peculiar property in those only that obtain the resurrection

quest

will not the time the will appear be after the expiration of months or years which are the years of the and latter years to the beast will have the end and ending about year of christ's nativity

respect being to true chronology which many think differs some years the vulgar computation so as that the true is by some to preceed the vulgar by space of two years others think four years

quest

about the time when number of those that are sealed shall appear will not an angel fly the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel to preach to the inhabitants

earth to every nation people tongue and kindred and who is this angel is it not jesus christ or some angel having his conmission and how shall this angel preach the gospel to all every where shall he not do it by inspiring good and holy men and stirring them up to go into other nations whereby they shall declare and publish the gospel of christ over the whole earth and so indeed there shall not be a nation or people upon the whole globe of the earth to whom the gospel shall not be both externally and internally preached and declared as christ had foretold all the elect children of god wheresoever dispersed shall be gather'd together and the rest shall be left without excuse
and doth not this time belong to the church of to whom the lord had promised that he would open a door before her which no man should shut and therefore shall not the ears and hearts of sundry in all nations be effectually opened by divine power operating in the ministers sent from god to believe and obey the holy gospel whereby there shall be a great conversion of many people of every kindred stock and family unto christ after this universal publication of the gospel and shall not also the gift of tongues and miracles with divers other

noble and excellent gifts of the divine spirit once communicated to the apostles be again restored to the church which being restored shall be again produced when that time shall come

quest

shall not babylon that great city fall suddenly after the of the gospel in all nations in the order and manner described by the iohn ch
where he first speaks of the with the lamb upon mount sion secondly of the general publication of the gospel to all nation and thirdly and lastly of the fall of babylon quest

is not the first resurrection of all the saints and that happy and glorious sabbath which they shall enjoy upon earth after the first resurrection pointed out chapter
verse
blessed are the dead that die in the lord from henceforth saith the spirit that they rest from their and their works follow them
and why doth he say from henceforth but to intimate to us that excellent sabbath of the saints for altho the saints are perpetually blessed and do rest in christ after death yet is not some peculiar degree of felicity intended in these words viz
that most noble and excellent sabbath which the saints shall enjoy in the millennium

quest

what signifies the reaping of the earth and the gathering together of the grapes of the vineyards of the earth are not the fearful and terrible judgments of god upon the unbelieving and disobedient to be understood by it after god shall have bountifully his servants

quest

how are those words to be understood chap
and the was trodden without the and blood came of the even unto the by the space of a and six hundred furlongs doth not this belong to the time of the bale of armageddon under the seventh when gog and magog or the ungodly shall joyn themselves in against god's people who follow the but at this time more against the iews and israelites now inhabiting their own land of which see ch

to what interval or space of time belongs the vision of the seven

angels pouring out their seven phials of divine wrath do they not seem manifestly

to belong to the time of the seventh trumpet to wit from the year of christ's resurrection to the year

for those phials are said to contain the seven last plagues and in them is the divine wrath fulfilled
and therefore will they not belong to the seventh trumpet which contains horrible and tremendous plagues and finally before any of these phials shall be poured fourth the temple of god will be opened in heaven and all such as have obtained victory over the beast and his image and over the mark and number of his name viz after the expiration of years since the death of christ shall stand upon the glassy sea which is mixt with fire singing the song of moses and the lamb and prophesying of almost a general conversion of the nations
and doth not this opening of the temple belong to the beginning of the interval of the philadelphian church and certainly if we well consider how great power the antichristian kingdom has had in the world to this very day it seems an argument strong enough to conclude that no phials have been as yet poured out

quest

who are those whom iohn saw standing upon the sea of glass mingled

with fire having obtained victory over the beast and over his image mark and number having the harps of god and singing the song of moses and the lamb are not they the and with them all the rest of the saints who have attained to the first before all others and is not this sea of glass this visible world full of perplexing cares and upon which notwithstanding shall stand the saints as it were upon a sea glass in solidity who have gotten victory over the beast not only singing song for a testimony of deliverance the song of the lamb also

are ose words to be undtood revel

and was the glory of god and no was a into the temple the plagues of the seven angels were doth not this of god all open the whole of the seven phials shining with splendour and divine glory which so her that none of them shall be able enter there into or do her the injury during all that time and peradventure about the end of the seventh phial those enemies of the church will attempt something upon her and hitherto the battle

of armageddon seems to be referr'd where at last they shall all perish by fire and hail sent from heaven

quest

do not the seven thunders belonging to the sixth trumpet

and the seven phials belonging to the seventh trumpet

contain something analogous

quest

doth not the or pouring out of the seven phials denote the fall of babylon as it were by so many degrees succeeding one another every phial's interval including years and which is of the the interval of each trumpet therefore are they not mightily deceived who think that either babylon is already fallen or else that her fall is exceeding near are not they also mistaken who think the four phials are already pour'd forth when tis more that not one of them is as yet pour'd out for the first phial will begin from the year of resurrection the opening of the temple and the vision of the sealed must precede the effusion or pouring forth of all the phials as evidently appears from the very series or order of prophecies in this book

quest

what is signified by the earth upon which the first phial was to be pour'd out is it not the lowest order of antichristian hierarchy of which sort are priests and clerks of inferior rank with all their train and what is signified by the a is it not some degree of the same hierarchy as the sea is superiour to the earth of which sort are chief priests or bishops with their seats which they call seas and whereas these seas are to be turned into doth not this signifie some mighty slaughter and destruction to fall upon these men by war and then what may be understood by fountains and rivers whether not others again of an higher order and rank such as are or commonly cardinals and metropolitans of the antichristian hierarchy who spilt the blood of saints and and therefore they shall then have their own blood spilt not indeed by any saints but by other instruments raised up them by god's most just judgment but how when those that are to be slain under the third phial did spill the blood of the saints is a question well worth explanation seeing none of the saints were killed by any after the interval of the sixth trumpet moreover doth not the pouring out the other four denote the fall and

utter ruin of babylon or the false and antichristian church by various degrees together with the final period and destruction of the kingdoms and corrupt dominions of men and finally doth not this great river euphrates to the sixth phial signifie the or other people inhabiting some other countries bordering upon euphrates to make a way for the kings of the east and who are those kings of east are they not the saints raised to life again in the future millennium

chap
xvii

quest

beast upon whom this great sat the roman monarchy which is the sixth head but this sixth head falling will not a seventh and after that an eighth which nevertheless belongs to the seventh and is it were an appendix of it doth not daniel expresly describe

those two kings the one of the south and the other of the north and lastly will not these kings or one of these kings rise up against the saints together with the false prophet who is to be raised up with him with a purpose to kill them under the interval of the seventh phial but will not god miraculously guard and protect his saints and destroy their adversaries with fire and hail from heaven

and is not the battle of armageddon which seems to belong to the last phial clearly enough described by ezekiel and also the aforesaid kings called by the names of gog and magog chap and

xviii
quest

doth not that fall and destruction of by fire or so fully describ'd chap
that the false and antichristian church shall be totally destroyed and abolished and what are those daughters of babylon but hypocrites in every sect and profession of christianity altho they may gild it over with the specious name whilst they continue strangers to the spirit and life the christian religion

quest

how are we to understand that in babylon was found not only the blood of the prophets and saints but of all that were slain upon the earth not the of so much blood respect all that space of years past from flood from which time babylon began to be externally comprehending the intire revolution of one great day or night consisting of twelve hours therefore will not all those murderers and shedders of humane blood even from noahs flood to the year of the world's creation or of christ's resurrection from the dead together make up one and the same city of babylon and receive their punishment therein in case they do not and sincerely how this shall come to pass is well worth an explana+tion will not that hour wherein babylon shall be with those and tremendous judgments of god consist of years or of years after of years to one watch of the as it is

each watch consisting of hours and hours making one intire night or day

what the marriage of the lamb which in to come at me afaid and again what is that pper of the to wch whosor

were called were blessed do not both the marriage and supper of the lamb denote the first resurrection of the saints unto life among whom all matrimony with the carnal use of it shall cease among men and women agreeable to christ`s saying that in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage
but the souls of the saints are married to the lamb remaining in the mean time pure and chast virgins

quest

doth it not clearly appear from chap

that the army of the lamb was to use no carnal weapons for their captain whom they followed arrayed in white garments and on white horses will smite their enemies with a sword proceeding out of his mouth and what are those white horses which the saints shall have are they not pure bodies bodies of the first resurrection

do not the years six times mention'd in this chapter signifie years properly so call'd and did not that sabbath of days and made under the law prigure this sabbath of the world to be in the seven thousandth year of it even as the six preceding thousand years of the world were figur'd out or typified the six and do not places of scripture psal

unto the mystery of years put for a day and have not the prophets prophesied of many great and glorious things this time or day of the lord also doth not that of psal
tis treated of the sabbath relate also unto that renowned moreover is not that day the same whereof prophesied saying the light of day shall be as the light of seven days and the lord alone shall be exalted and magnified in that also not only the more learned among the but many also of the fathers among the in the primitive of the church have declared and asserted their faith and hope concerning this glorious sabbath and millennium to come wherein all saints being recalled from unto shall lead a most bleed and also a most holy upon earth in the firm belief and perswasion rejoyced and triumphed in the greatest and of this mortal quest

quest shall not the saints when they shall be to life have bodies of not indeed

as men now have but far more excellent such as was adam body whilest he lived in the earthly paradise before the fall and such also as was the body of our lord jesus christ before his death which bodies of the saints shall at length in the end of the seventh millennium be changed into spiritual bodies in which they shall ascend into to meet the lord and did not paul touch upon that mystery cor
saying as we have born the of the earthly adam viz as he was before the we shall also bear the image of the heavenly now glorified in the heavens and did not the prophets prophesie of such a resurrection and especially hosea and daniel dan


hos

and finally doth not paul cor
plainly describe the of a body the first indeed natural and then after the expiration of the millennium and the end of the worlds ages is come a spiritual body but that is not first which is spiritual that which is natural and then that which is spiritual and is not that reward one of the promises of christ in that age when he shall come in the glory his father

quest

and as the iews sabbath began in the end or evening of sixth day will not also this most blessed sabbath the world begin in the end of the sixth millennium to wit the sixth milennium of the world is expired and seeing the whole time of this worlds duration seems to be a week of be no of years the end of the millennium if this age of years did not commence bore the years were expired and that is some of years after the millennium plainly appears the revelations which iohn calls a little season rev
now or no that little season may not contain years making that most happy age of the world to begin about year of the world and of christ's resurrection leave to be determined by to

god shall vouchsafe to open these things by a purer chronology

quest

how shall the saints be raised up again to live a corporeal life on earth seeing matrimony and carnal conjunction of male and female shall cease whether all the saints shall be born of virgins or whether as god formed adam out of the clay of the earth or any other way suitable to the majesty of the thing is a matter highly worthy to be explained if there be any to whom god shall reveal it quest

do not the two last chapters of the revelations contain a description of that most splendid and glorious state of the saints or church of god during the whole interval or space of the millennium even unto the end of the world quest

shall not new heavens and a new earth be made and prepared at the beginning of the millennium chap
isaiah
and pet

and how shall this first heaven and first earth pass away shall they be reduced to nothing or rather shall not the first or old heaven and earth alter their nature and quality and so be changed into new and whereas peter said that justice shall dwell in this new earth doth not this sufficiently intimate that righteous shall inhabit the same both he and all the saints expected this new earth quest

shall not there remain some seed of sinners in the time of the millennium as from isaiah ch

and out of that remaining seed of sinners will not the armies of gog magog be multiplied after the end of the millennium and shall not these sinners during the whole millennium be totally subject to the saints

quest

shall the conflagration of the world be made at once or by parts of which see pet


isa

and finally will it destroy all or for the most part only sinners and will not certain sinners escape the flames whilst babylon

shall be totally destroyed and exterminated even as in noah ark ham and his wife were preserved from the flood as well as the righteous from whom afterwards sprang the worst sort of sinners

quest

will there not be found two sorts of saints living upon earth within the interval of the sixth seal viz from the year of christ's resurrection to the year
one whereof hath attained to the first resurrection the other hath not as yet obtained it but hath an infallible hope and assurance after death to obtain the same also within the time aforesaid and are not the words of isaiah to be understood of the latter isa

he that dies at an hundred years of age dies in youth or childhood but such shall die as moses dy'd whose eye was not darkened nor his natural strength diminished when he died deut
for moses did not die by reason of any sickness or decay of strength but only to fulfil divine pleasure and will not also all the mortal saints die after the same manner who have not as yet attained the first resurrection that so by this way of dying they may obtain it quest

and will not the children of the first resurrection be in all respects the children of god to wit both externally and internally as it were begotten of him their only father and is not this clearly enough hinted to us in those words of isa

shall be barren who give generation to others saith the lord as it is in the vulgar translation

quest

do not those words of revel

and there shall be no more death nor mourning nor tears plainly intimate that the saints who have obtained the first resurrection shall never die any more neither internally nor externally but shall live during the whole millennium a most holy and a most blessed life on earth but at the end of the millennium to wit after all the saints have lived compleatly a thousand years on earth shall they not be changed and ascend together to meet christ in the heavens even

as christ ascended into heaven after his resurrection and is not the saints life for a thousand years apparently signified in these words isa

which iustin martyr reads thus as are the days of the tree of life so shall be the days of my people thereby signifying man's return to that state of holiness and felicity wherein adam stood before the fall whilest he was permitted to feed on the tree of life when as yet he knew not death neither had yet tasted of the forbidden fruit

quest

how are those words to be understood revel

and there was no more sea is sea here allegorically for worldly afflictions and tribulations or may it not also be understood of some outward mediterranean sea dividing as well the islands one from another as other continents of the earth so as that all the dry land may remain together in one place as it is probable it did before the flood
quest

why is that holy city of god said to come down from heaven revel

doth not this plainly that all the saints whatsoever now in heaven shall descend from heaven in the time of the millennium to live a most divine and heavenly life on earth during the space of a thousand years as before was said that at last they may be fitted and prepared for greater glory which they shall enjoy in heaven after the years are finished to all for god shall be with them and in them whilst they live here so that they shall suffer no injury or damage in this their but be greater gainers by it

quest

do not those words revel

will give to him that thirsteth of fountain of living water freely
he that shall inherit all and will be to him a god and he shall be to me a son relate unto those which have not yet obtained the first resurrection who yet and wrestle with and spiritual temptations and all shall have an opportunity to attain this first

of the saints at the year of christs resurrection

quest

do not the twelve doors or gates of the holy city whereon are inscribed the names of the twelve tribes of israel clearly intimate that all the gentiles who are true believers shall be gathered together into one body with the faithful israelites and all the gentiles who are to be saved will belong some to one and some to another of the twelve tribes of israel quest

and lastly do not the names of the twelve apostles inscribed upon the twelve of this city signifie that this very city was gathered together and built by the doctrine and ministry of saints and and that the apostles themselves were the chief members and as it were the foundations of it christ remaining above all and in all the principal foundation and chief quest

why is city said to be square in the form of a cube and not of a doth not this signifie the stable condition and of this city as the roundness and orbicular form of the earth its voluble and unconstant state and condition together with mortals that dwell therein quest

will not certain other holy souls descend into bodies in the millennium who lived not before on earth in the preceding ages of the world quest

not the rate or proportion of the holy city compared to the whole earth be as is to assigning to each of the terrestrial globe above miles and under which is the proportion that one week bears to a year moreover doth not the age of this world from the beginning to the end seem like a week and doth it not seem worth a sober and modest inquiry what mystery may be couched the similitude of these two proportions

quest

shall those who inhabit this city need the use of meats and drinks or what shall be their food shall it not be such food as adam eat in the earthly paradise before the fall

quest

are not those words of revel

and the city shall not stand in need of the light of the sun nor of the moon to be understood according to the letter for although the sun moon and stars shall then shine and impart their vertues and influences to other animals or living creatures yet the saints of the first resurrection shall not seem to stand in need of their light or vertue

an appendix
containing some emendations and explanations of divers passages in the two treatises out of the original manuscripts and papers

friendly reader

it was thought fit to let thee know that the following emendations corrections and explanations are according to the mind of the author as appeareth out of another copy of his manuscript

and his other papers that have been faithfully preserved it is therefore probable that the author himself upon his second thoughts which are commonly the more solid hath himself corrected divers things in these treatises which ought not to be charged upon him as any blame but rather in so doing to deserve praise
but it is most certain that divers considerable mistakes have crept into the printed copies latin and english by the unskilfulness and in advertency of the transcribers through whose hands the original copy hath come the which original can thee reader have seen in a latin manuscript many years ago but who the author is is not easie to judge
for divers reasons best known to himself he thought it not convenient to make his name known to the world as many worthy authors of have their names
the reader is to be advertised that some words in this printed english copy here corrected are the errors of the press incident to all books
it must needs be confessed that many things in these treatises especially in the former will seem strange and surprizing to many because of their cressing the common notions and sentiments generally received both in philosophy and so called
but truth or untruth may be in these things that may seem to many most incredible it is the readers wisdom not to be hasty to judge so as to conclude or against without mature judgment and a good understanding as plato called by some the divine philosopher well said non est sapientis de obscuris
it is not a wise man's part to determine of things obscure or unclear to his understanding
the authors modesty and discretion is to be commended for the most part but to handle these things historically or hypothetically not nor positively his design being as it manifestly appeareth to give some hints of the mystick learning of the and of other christian

mystick writers to ordinary and vulgar scholars that had not heard of such things so much perhaps as by fame and also to such sincere christians as have a real divine hunger and thirst begot in them after a greater degree of the living knowledge of god and of christ and the mysteries of the kingdom of god so far as they are traceable in the holy scriptures as god shall be pleas'd to work by his holy spirit to give the understanding of them for tho the iews in great part are blinded especially as concerning the true messiah yet in many things it is acknowledged by pious christian writers that their ancient mystick learning containeth many things not only very agreeable to christian doctrine but very conducing to help us to understand many places of scripture in the new testament as well as in the old
and if sincere christian professors did but well understand the great advantage and help that the iewish learning with which this author seemeth to have been in good measure acquainted doth afford to convince the iews of the truth of christianity so as to enable and furnish them to right them with their own they wou'd be more willing to read with an impartial mind such books as would help them in such of learning few of which sort as yet if any are extant in the english language

the second treatise added unto the first was done by the same author
it is hoped that it will be favourably received and entertain'd by the reader the rather that it is proposed only by way of yet so far explanatory as in many things at lest it may by the blessing of god be made serviceable to the better understanding many things in the book of the further than what they have formerly known by the help of other commentaries

the author is not so to be understood as if because he hath an allegorical sence of christ's flesh and blood allegorically

and figuratively so understood as the scripture aboundeth with such allegories and figurative speeches as water wine milk honey oyl marrow and fatness that therefore he did not sincerely believe that christ's outward
flesh was real flesh and his blood real blood which he gave for the life of the world the which body and blood of christ tho it is not to be received by the mouth as papists say yet spiritually by faith it is fed upon by all sincere christians
and in this sence to eat christ's flesh and to drink his blood is sincerely to believe that christ gave his body of flesh to be broken for and his blood to be shed for us for the remission of sin by which sincere faith whereof christ is the we partake the life and spirit of that is the soul's immediate

that the saints shall be raised up to life in a carnal and terrestrial body must not be understood such as we now have as is well said lin
but such as adam had in paradise which being compared with such bodies as we now have may be said to be spiritual and yet may well he allowed to be capable of a far greater degree of after the years are expir'd when they shall ascend together with christ into the heavens

the saints the gog and magog army shall

attempt to slay shall not be the raised saints but the other saints that shall live in the years and have not as yet attain'd the resurrection and such saints shall marry and have children
but it is improper to think that the raised saints shall marry to wit as men now do and have children by women but the manner how adam would have propagated his kind is best to leave to a further opening for many think it is apparent scripture that adam before the fall was male and female in one body and so would have encreased without distinction of sex

page
correct
that marrying building planting shall belong to the saints not raised within the thousand years ought to be granted but is no wise proper to grant it to the raised saints whether their resurrection be called first or second for it seemeth to contradict the words of christ and the divine order of things
but all the time of the thousand years new and saints will be added to the church daily by the preaching of the gospel who without dying or sleeping will be changed and the mortal and corruptible body shall put on immortality and incorruption
moreover that the deceased saints shall obtain the resurrection of the body by being born of women as men are now born into the world must not be granted for not earthly and mortal women whether married or virgins but our heavenly and immortal mother ierusalem from above shall bring us all forth and the deceased saints generally as her children with respect to the resurrection or regeneration of our bodies at the time appointed as she hath now brought us forth and all the saints with respect to the inward resurrection and inward regeneration of our souls
and only christ shall be our heavenly father and ierusalem from above our heavenly mother with respect to the resurrection of the dead and therefore the children of the resurrection in scripture are called the children of god but shall not be the children of men born

and tho it may be granted that the hypothesis of the revolutions may some way illustrate the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead as minutius felix improved it to that purpose to convince the heathen philosophers of the verity of the resurrection yet the resurrection of the dead tho it be call'd a revolution is not like those other revolutions wherein men's souls are supposed after death to revolve into other bodies by humane generation

that none had finished their revolutions according to that hypothesis before the death of christ must be granted but that all souls had begun their revolutions before solomon time unless it be restrained to the souls of the iews is not so apparent but rather according to the mystick writers of the iews many souls do still begin their revolutions until years be from the beginning of this world

but such souls do amend the mystick writers say do quickly revolve in order to their perfect restitution so that the soul of the deceased may revolve in his which is only but historically related but not dogmatically yet not so that the father is the for that would be great confusion but that as they say the soul of the deceased doth revolve to cohabit and live together the soul of the in the same body even as the soul of the did live together and cohabit with the soul of the in the body out of whose loins he did at last proceed according to which hypothesis it may be understood how the souls er and onan who died in the land of canaan yet went with their brethren into egypt making in all together with er and onan but souls as from gen

isaac was to be saved justified and pardoned by faith in the man christ but isaac was not to believe or have faith in himself

that promised seed of the woman that descended out of the loins of all the fathers in a straight line of succession from adam to christ and from eve to mary was no part of the defiled nature of man tho it was conveyed or transmitted thro them that had been defiled with sin as david and solomon were great sinners and yet their seed was conveyed and through them
and this is easie to understand how an holy and undefiled seed or principle can pass through them that have been defiled and be no more defiled therewith than how the can shine on an unclean place and not be defiled
now that the seed of the woman so conveyed and transmitted from adam to christ was never defiled with sin and so was no part of the fallen nature of man is clear because to signifie his primitive purity and holiness he was conceived of the holy ghost and born of a virgin and not after the manner of humane generation
and it is written of him thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity psal

that of our nature which christ assumed if it had been defiled at any time with sin how could it have been cleansed how could it other parts of man's nature that had been defiled by sin for it is the clean that cleanseth the unclean and the cleansing must begin in that which is clean that is the root and original to and cleanse that which is unclean and by in the promised seed of the woman all they who were saved from the beginning of the world were cleansed and sanctified
but if it be was this seed of the woman from adam to the man christ the seed of christ or only a bodily seed or principle
to this it is that the degree of the soul of christ was not that seed that was conveyed through the loins

abraham and david to wit that degree of his soul called the spirt and mind in hebrew ruach and neshamah for that was in heaven and came down from heaven when the child jesus was conceived in the womb of the virgin as christ himself said ioh
for came down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him that sent me this was not the godhead of christ but that superiour or higher degree of his soul called and neshamah but the inferiour degree or animal part called in heb may be well allowed to have been in that seed of the woman which christ assumed together with the bodily seed and principle of christ's body and tho it was conveyed and transmitted through all these generations from adam to christ mentioned in luke ch
yet that is not in the common sense of the word because rolution in the common sense of the word used by mtick is used to signifie the returning of the souls of men to live again in other bodies of their posterity or kindred but when a man begets a son and the soul of his son comes out of loins as it is said the souls of iacob children came of his loins that is not called in the common sense of the writers
beside that souls revolved are to bodily pains and that the body suffers into which it revolveth and death also and therefore the sl of christ did not after this manner revolve for then he would have often died whereas christ died but once and having once died he dieth no more hath no more dominion over him rom
nor is there any cause to suppose that isaac soul needed any revolution more than the soul of any the men for these holy men being perfected in faith love and holiness according to the of the revolutions after death need no revolution but rest in perfect peace and joy until the resurrection of the dead

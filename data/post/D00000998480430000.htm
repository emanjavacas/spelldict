To the right worshipfull Maister Edwarde Dier Esquier, Iohn Frampton wisheth much health, with prosperous and perfite felicitie.
REturning right worshipful, home into Englande out of Spaine, and now not pressed with the former toiles of my olde trade, to passe the tyme to some benefite of my country, and to auoyde idlenes; tooke in hande to translate out of Spanish into English, the three bookes of Doctor Monardes of Seuil, the learned Phisition, treating of the singular and rare vertues of certaine Hearbes, Trees, Oyles, Plants, Stoner, Drugges of the West Indias, for that the same booke is of high commendation in Spaine, and other countries, in such sorte, that in deede it might bring in tyme rare profite, to my Country folkes of Englande, by wonderful cures of sund great diseases, that otherwise then by these redies, were incurable.
And hauing finished same translation, determined to dedicate my trauaile therein, to some rare louer of knowledge, for the worthinesse of the woorke: and not finding any Gentleman of myne acquaintance, that was more studious, and more delighted with learned works, or that more cherished trauellers, and louers of all good knowledge, determined to dedicate the same to your woorshippe before al others, requesting your woorshippe to accept the worke, and to be a patron of the same, and to take it into your protection, since the matter is of good substance, and of much value, and of me, truly translated into English.
And since the aforesaid Medicines mentioned in the same worke of are now by Marchants others, brought out of the West Indias into and from Spaine hither into England, by such as doe thither, and that the excellencie of these Hearbes, Trees, Oyles, Plants, stones, &c. haue bin knowen to be so precious a remedie for all manner of diseases, and hurtes, that may happe vnto Man, Woman, or Childe, they haue of and forsaken very much the olde order and of Phisicke, which was vsed before that this was knowen, as thinges not of so present remedie for all manner of diseases, as these nowe late founde owt, are; which by greate experience made in Spayne, and other Countries, were throughly and effectuously prooued and experimented, to woorke the effectes which are contayned in this Booke.
And thus leaue your woorshippe to the Almightie, beseeching him to gyue you long lyfe, and for the sake that aduauncement, that your good nature, and rare vertues doe wel deserue.
THE FIRST PART OF THIS BOKE TREATETH OF THE thinges that are brought from the Occidentall Indias, which serue for the vse of Medicine, and of the order that must be kept in taking the roote called Mechoacan, wherein are discouered great secretes of Nature, and great experiences: made and compiled by Doctor Monardus, Phisition of Seuill.
IN the yere of our Lord God, a thousa~d, foure hundreth ninetie two, our Spaniards were gouerned by sir Christopher Colo~, being naturally born in the cou~trie of Genoua to discouer the Occide~tal Indias that are called at this day, the newe world, and they discouered the first land thereof, the xi. day of October, of the said yere: from that time vnto this, they haue discouered many sundry Islandes, and muche firme land, as wel in that cou~trie, which they cal the new Spaine, as in that which is called the Peru where there are manie Prouinces, many Kingdomes, and many Cities, that haue contrary and diuers customes in them, in which there haue beene founde out, thinges that neuer in these partes, nor in any other partes of the worlde haue beene seene, nor vnto this day knowen: and other thinges which nowe are brought vnto vs in greate abundance, that is to say, Gold, Siluer, Pearles, Emeraldes, Turkeies, other fine stones of great value.
Yet great is the excesse and quantitie that hath come, and euery daie doeth come, and inespecially of Golde and Siluer, that it is a thing woorthy of admiration the great number of Melons, which haue come from thence, besides the great quantity of pearles which haue stored the whole world: also they doe bring those partes, Popingaies, Griffons, Apes, Lions, Gerfaucons, other kinds of Haukes, Tigers wool, Cotton wool, Graine to die with al, Hides, Sugars, Coppar, Brasill, the wood Ebano Anill: and of all these, there is so great quantity, that there commeth euery yeere, one hundred ships laden therewith, that it is a great thing, and an incredible riches.
And besides these great riches, our Occidentall Indias doe send vnto vs many Trees, Plants, Hearbes, Rootes, Iuices, Gummes, Fruites, Licoures Stones that are of great vertues, in the which there be founde, and haue been found in them, very great effectes that doe exceede much in value and price all the aforesayde thinges, by so muche as the corporall health is more excellent, and necessary then the temporall goodes: the which thinges all the world doth lacke, the want whereof is not a little hurtefull, according to the greate profite which wee doe see, by the vse of them to follow, not onely in our Spayne, but also in all the world.
And this is not too bee meruelled at, that it is so, for the doeth say, that all Countries doe not yeelde Plantes and Fruites alike: for one Region yeeldeth such Fruites, Trees, and Plantes as an other doeth not: wee doe see that in Creta onely groweth the Diptamo and the Incence onely in the region of Saba and the Almaciga onely in the Islande of Chio and the Sinamom, Cloues, and Peper, and other spices onely in the Islands of the Maluca and many other thinges you haue in diuers partes of the worlde, which were not knowne vntill our time, and the people of olde time did lacke them, but Time which is the discouerer of all thinges, hath discouered them vnto vs greatly to our profite, considering the greate neede that wee of And as there are discouered new regions, newe kingdomes, and newe Prouinces, by our Spaniardes, so they haue brought vnto vs newe Medicines, and newe Remedies, wherewith they doe cure many infirmities, which, if we did lacke them, woulde bee incurable, and without anye remedy: of which thinges although that some haue knowledge, yet they be not common too all people, for which cause did pretend to treate, and to write, of all things that they bring from our Indias, apperteyning to the arte and vse of Medicine, and the remedie of the hurtes and diseases that wee doe suffer and endure, whereof no small profite doeth followe to those of our time, and also vntoo them that shall come after vs: in the bewraying whereof shall be the first, that the rather the followers may adde herevnto, with this beginning, that which they shal more knowe, and by experience hereafter finde out.
And as in this Citie of Seuill which is the Porte and skale of all the Occidentall Indias, we doe knowe of them more, then in any other partes of all Spayne, for bicause that al things come first hither, where by better intelligence and greater experience it is learned: so doe I, with practice and vse of them this fourtie yeeres, that which doe cure in this Citie, where haue informed my selfe of them, that haue brought these thinges out of those partes with muche care, and haue made experience thereof, with many and diuers persons, with all diligence and foresight possible, and with much happy successe.
kinds of Rosine, that be both much alike one to the other, the one is called Copall and the other Anime
The Copall is a Rosine verie white, and of muche brightnesse, it is brought in certaine great peeces, which are like too peeces of Diacitron very cleare, it hath an indifferent smell, but not so good as the Anime with this Copall the Indians did make perfumes in their sacrifices, so the vse thereof was frequented in the Temples, by their Priestes.
And when the first Spaniardes went too those partes, the Priestes went out to receiue them, with little firepots, burning in them this Copall and geuing to them the smoke of it at their noses: wee doe vse heere to perfume with it in diseases rising vpon coldenesse of the head, in the place of Incence, or Anime it is hotte in the seconde degree, and moyst in the first, it is resoluatiue, and softneth by some watrish partes, that it hath.
The Anime is a gumme or Rosine of a greate Tree, it is white, it draweth neere to the coulour of Incence, it is more oyly then the Copall is, it commeth in graines, as the Incence doeth, although somewhat greater, and beyng broken, it hath a yellowe collour, as Rosine hath: it is of a very acceptable and pleasaunt smell, and put vppon burning coales, it doth consume very quickely.
It differeth from our Anime that is brought from Leuante which is not so white, nor so bright, insomuche that some doe say, that it is spice of Charabe or Succino which is called Amber congeled, wherwith they doe make Beades, but it is not so, for that the Charabe is a kinde of Pitche, that is founde in the Germayne Sea, and it is taken out of the Sea in great peeces, with a dragge of Iron, so that it seemeth to come foorth of some Fountaines, into the Sea, after the maner of pitch, and beeing come foorthe vnto the colde ayre, it congeleth, for because there is in the same, peeces of stickes, other superfluities of the Sea, cleaning vnto it, and in this they shall see the errour of them, that say that it is Gumme of Alamo and of others, that it is of the Pinetree.
Of our Anime Hermolaus Barbarus a man most excel+lently learned doeth saie, that it is about the place where Incence is founde, and that lande or soile, is called Amintin and therefore the thing is called Anime
That which is brought from the newe Spaine, is gathered from certaine Trees, of a reasonable greatnesse, by way of incision, as the Incence, and Almasiga are we do vse thereof for many infirmities, and principally for the griefe of the head, and paines therof, caused of humours, or of colde causes, and for sluffyng in the head, that thereof doeth proceede, after euacuation, perfuming therewith the chambers in the Winter season: and where as are generall infirmities, it doeth purifie and correct the Aire, and they doe perfume therewith their head kerchers, when that they doe goe to sleepe: for them that doe suffer paines in the head, and occasions thereof, it doeth profite to perfume the head of him that is so diseased, it doeth comforte the head vnto such as haue it debilited, or weakened, and doe suffer paines by occasion thereof: they doe put it also in plaisters, and in seere clothes, where as is neede of comfort, and to dissolue, especially cold humours, or windinesse: they doe vse it also in place of Incence, as well in the perfumes, as in the aforesaide.
It doeth comfort the braine, applied in the forme of a plaister, and euen so likewise the stomacke, and all partes being full of Sinewes, made after the fashion of a Sere cloth with the third parte of Waxe: it taketh out the cold of any member, whatsoeuer, being applied therevntoo for a long time, with refreshing it.
It is hotte in the second degree, and moist in the first.
AND also they doe bring out of the newe Spaine an other kinde of Gumme or Rosine, which the Indians doe call Tacamahaca and the same name did our Spaniardes giue it, it is Rosine taken out by incision of a tree, being as great, as a Willow tree, and is of a verie sweete smell, it bringeth foorth a red fruite, as the seede of Pionia.
This Rosine or Gumme, the Indians doe much vse in their infirmities, chiefly in swellinges in any part of the bodie, wheresoeuer they bee ingendred, for that it dissolueth, ripeneth, and maruellously desolueth them.
And euen so, it taketh awaie any manner of greefe, that is come of a colde cause: as humours, and windinesse: this the Indians doe vse very commonly, and familiarly.
The colour is as the colour of Galuano and some doe say that it is the same, it hath white partes like to Amoniaco it is of a good smel, and the tast is like, insomuch that being cast vpon hotte burning coles, and giuing the smoke thereof at the nose of a woman that doth swoone, or els hath lost her feeling by suffocation of the Mother, it doeth cause her to come quickely, and easily to her selfe.
And the Rosine putte to her after the manner of a plaister, causeth the Mother to keepe in her place: and the vse thereof is so much amongest women, that the most parte which is spent thereof, is for this effect, for that they doe finde themselues very much eased by it, taking awaie from them all manner of chokinges of the Mother, and comforting the stomacke.
Some that bee curious doe adde thereuntoo Amber and Muske, and so it is better then alone.
It is alwaies fixed, without melting of it selfe, vntill that it bee al wholie wasted.
And where it doeth most profite, is for to take awaie any manner of griefe, caused of colde humours and windie, and beeing applied vnto them in manner of a plaister, it taketh them away, and dissolueth them with greate admiration: it doeth cleane in such sorte, that vntill it hath done, and wrought his effect, it can not bee taken away, and the selfe same it doeth, being laide vppon swellinges, for that it consumeth and desolueth them, and if there bee any desire to ripen them, it doeth it, and that very quickly.
It is also a remedie verified, and experimented, that it doeth profite much in Reumes, and Runnings, wheresoeuer they goe, for it taketh them awaie, putting a small peece of linnen cloth with this Rosine, behinde both the eares, or the eare on the parte which runneth, for that it doeth restraine the running of them: and applied vnto the temples of the head, in manner of a plaister, it doeth withholde the runnings and the fluxe, that runneth to the eyes, and to the partes of the face: it takethaway the tothe ache, although that the tothe bee hollowe, by putting a little of this Rosine into the hollowe, and if therewith the rotten tothe be burned, it maketh that the corruption goeth no further: and being laide after the maner of a plaister in the hollownesse of the necke, or griefe of the shoulders, it taketh away the paynes: mingled with the thirde parte of storax, and a little Amber made in a plaister, for the stomacke, it doeth comfort it, and causeth appetite to meate, it helpeth digestion, and dissolueth windines: after the same sort put vpon the moulde of the head, it comforteth, and taketh away the paines thereof.
In the Sciatica, or paynes of the hippes put therevnto, the effect thereof is greate: and likewise it is so in all paynes of the ioyntes: and in any payne of the body whersoeuer it be, chiefly if it come of cold humours, or mixt: For because with his resolution, it hath partes of binding, which doe giue a maruellous comforting in ioyntes, or in hurtes of Sinewes, putting that alone, it doeth heale and cure them, for greate is the experience, that wee haue of it, foorth with matter: it taketh away an extreeme colde: ordinarily it is applyed to all griefes: doe mingle therewith the thirde parte of yellowe Waxe, for that will be applied the better, and the vse thereof is so celebrated, that the people knowe no other remedy for any grief, but only the vse of this Rosine, so that it bee not inflamations very hotte, and also in them after the first furie is past, and the fearcenesse thereof, it doth profite much for to dissolue the rest: it is hotte in the beginning of the third degree, and drie in the second.
THey doe bring from the firme Lande, by the waie of Cartagena and number de Dios Rosin of the coulour of Tacamahaca somewhat cleare, and thinne, called in the Indians language, Caranna and this woorde and name our Spaniardes haue geuen it, and it hath in maner the smel of the Tacamahaca although it bee somewhat more strong of smell, it is very oylie, and it cleaueth fast without melting, for the clamminesse that it hath.
It is a newe Medicine, and brought hither about a tenne yeeres past, and the Indians doe vse it in their infirmities against swellinges, and in all manner of griefes, and now in our partes it is much esteemed, for the great effects that it doth worke.
It doth profit and heale the same infirmities, that the Tacamahaca doth, but it woorketh more speedily, so that many infirmities, wherein the Tacamahaca doth not so much effect, the Caranna doth easily heale.
There was one that did suffer paines in his shoulders, the wc paines hee had suffered a long time, in such sort, that he could not stirre his Armes, hauing vsed a great time the Tacamahaca yet hee was not healed, vntil hee had put thereunto the Caranna and thereby in three daies he was made whole.
In the griefes of the Iointes, and the Arthetica it hath a maruellous effect, being applied vnto the grief, so that it be not an inflammation, of very hotte humour, for it taketh it awaie, with much easinesse.
In old swellinges, as well in humours as in windes, it dissolueth, in griefes caused by defluxe or running of cold humours or mixed, it worketh a meruellous in all paines of the Sinowes, and griefes of the head, and griefes that thereof do proceede, it profiteth much.
Surely, it is a medicine to dissolue and to take away griefs of great efficacie, and doth make his worke with great certaintie in new greene wounds, especially of the Sinewes: it doeth much profit, and greatly in ioyntes, in the which haue seene done only therewith very great workes: it is an intercepting to state the fluxe and running of the eyes, and other partes applied behinde the eares, and in the temples of the head.
It is very fattie and oylie, and hot more then in the second degree.
And it is to be noted, that all these Rosines the Indians doe gather by way of Incision, by geuing cuttes in the Trees, of which forthwith the licour doth droppe out, and from thence they gather it.
FRom Gelisco a Prouince in the newe Spaine, they bring an Oyle or Licour, that the Spaniards haue called, oyle of the Fig tree of Hell, for that it is taken from a tree that is no more nor lesse the~ our Fig tree of Hel, aswel in the Leafe, as in the Fruite: it is the same that wee doe commonlie call Chatapucia or Cherua it is also milkish as ours is, for that it is more burning in the Indias for the grosnes of the earth.
The Indians doe make this oyle, as Dioscorides doeth shewe, in the first booke, the xxx.
Chapter, that is, do pounde the seede, seeth it in water, and after it is sodden, then they gather the Oyle that swimmeth vppon it, with a Spoone, and this is the maner to make Oyle of fruite and Seedes, and Bowes of trees: It is verie much frequented and vsed of the Indians.
As for expression or wringing out the iuice, they doe not knowe how to doe it, for lacke of knowledge, this kind of oyle principally is better drawen out this way, than by expression.
This Oyle hath greate vertues, as by the vse thereof hath beene seene, as well in the Indias, as in our partes, and all that will say, is of very greate experience, and much vse thereof in many persons: it doeth heale and cure all infirmities caused of cold humours, and windines, it doth dissolue al hardnes with mollification, and all inflammations being windie: it taketh away all manner of paine in what parte soeuer it bee, chiefly if it come of any colde cause, or windines, for that in this, it maketh a meruellous woorke, dissoluing greate windinesse, wheresoeuer it bee, and especially in the belly: and with this they do heale a windy Dropsie, lykewyse al kinds therof, annoyuting there withal the Belly, and Stomacke, taking some droppes therof with wine, or other licour appropriated, that it may auoyde the citrine water, and make the winde to be expelled: and if they doe put it in any maner Glister, or Medicine, geuen so it doeth auoyde out the citrine water, and doth expell Windes with more assuraunce than any other Medicine.
In the griefes of the Stomacke of cold humors, and windes, and Colicke, it worketh great effect, anointing therewith, and taking some droppes thereof, and principally they do this in that mortall disease called the Ileon which is a cetrayne filthines that purgeth at the mouth.
It doeth auoyde fleame principally, in griefes of the Iointes certain droppes of this oyle taken with the broth of some fat foule, it doeth empt away the humour that causeth the paine, it doeth heale the olde sores of the head, that doth yelde much matter.
Gentleman that did vomit his meate the space of many yeeres, did anoynt his stomack with this oyle, and therewith did recouer neuer again: It doth vndoe Opilations of the inner parts of the body, of the stomacke, of the Mother, anoynting it therewith.
And vnto yong children and Boyes, that cannot goe to the Stoole, anoynting the lower parte of the Nauill with this oyle, it doeth prouoke them to the stoole: and if they haue wormes, it doeth expell and kille them, chiefly if they giue them a droppe or twoo with milke, or with some fat grosse thing.
And for those that haue lost their hearing, it causeth it to be restored to them, with a maruellous worke, as it hath beene seene by many experiences.
In griefes of Iointes, and in griefes of swellinges, so that they come not of a very hotte cause, it taketh them away and doeth dissolue them: any of the me~bers beeing drawen together, and annoynted with this Oyle, they doe extende and the Sinowes are mollified with it, taking away the griefe if that there bee any: it taketh away any markes or signes, wheresoeuer they bee in the face, principally, and the Morphewe which women many tymes bee troubled withall, the anoynting with this Oyle, doeth take it away, and consumeth it, not with litle conte~t to them that vse it.
It is hotte in the first parte of the thirde degree, and moyst in the second.
THere is in the Islande of Cuba certaine Fountaines at the Sea side, that do cast from them a kinde of blacke Pitch of a strong smell, which the Indians doe vse in their cold infirmities.
Our people doe vse it there to pitche theyr Shippes withall, for it is well neere lyke vnto Tarre, and they doe mingle therewith Tallowe, to make it Pitch the better.
doe beleeue that this is Napta which the auncient wryters doe speake of.
Possidonio sayeth, that there are twoo Fountaynes thereof in Babylon, one whyte and the other blacke.
That which is brought fro~ the Indias, we do vse against griefes of the Mother, for that it doeth reduce the Mother to her place.
And if it rise on high, then put it to the Nosethrilles, and if it come downe to the lower partes, putting thereto a wet tent with this Pitche, it causeth it to go vpwarde, to her place: and likewise it doeth profite, being applied to cold Infirmities, as the other Medicines do which we haue spoken of.
It is hotte in the second degree, moist in the first.
FRom the newe Spaine they doe bring a Rosine that we call Liquid Amber and one like Oyle that wee call Oyle of Liquid Amber that is to say, a thing that wee doe most set by, and as precious as Amber or Oyle thereof, both of them being of sweete smell of good sauour, and especially the Oyle of Liquid Amber which is of sauour more delicate and sweete than Amber
Rosine taken out by incision from certaine trees very great and faire, and full of leaues, which are like to Iuie, and the Indians doe call them Ococol
They carrie a thicke rinde, of the colour of Ashes, this rinde being cut, doth cast out the Liquid Amber thicke, and so they doe gather it, and because the rinde hath a smell very sweete, they do breake and mingle it with the Rosine, and when it is burned, it hath a better smell, in so much, wheresoeuer the trees are, there is a most sweete smell through all the fields.
When the Spaniardes came the first time, to that place where it groweth, and did feele such a sweete smell, they thought that there had beene spices, and trees thereof.
There is brought much quantitie of Liquid Amber in+to Spaine, insomuch that they do bring many Pipes, and Barelles full thereof to sell for Merchaundise, for heere they raise profite thereof, to perfume in thinges of sweete smelles, wasting it in place of Storax for that the smoke and smell doeth seeme to be the same: and also they doe put it into other confections of sweete smelles to burne, and suche like thinges.
It casteth from it so muche smell without burning of it, that wheresoeuer it be, it cannot be hidden, but doth penetrate many houses and streetes with the sweete smell, when there quantity of it.
It serueth much in medicine, doth therein greate effect, for that it healeth, comforteth, dissolueth, and mittigateth payne applied vnto the Moulde of the heades by it selfe, or mingled with other thinges Aromaticall it doth comfort the braines, and taketh away the paines of any manner of griefe, proceeding of a coulde cause layed after the manner of a Playster therevnto, it doeth also mitigate, and take away the paynes, griefes of the stomake, wherein it doth a marueilous applied after the maner of a Stomacher.
For that it doth comfort the Stomake, and doeth dissolue windes, and helpe digestion, and take away rawnesse it causeth the meate to be well digested, it geueth lust to eate: it is made of Liquide Amber spreade abroade vpon a sheeps skinne, in the forme of a breastplate, mingled with a little Storax, Amber and Muske it is a Playster which doeth profite muche in all that haue sayed.
There is knowne of this playster very great experience, in this Citie, for the good effect that it worketh: it is hot in the ende of the second degree, and moyst in the first.
Out of this Liquid Amber is taken the Oyle that is called the oyle of Liquide Amber the which in his smel is more sweet, it is taken out of the Liquide Amber when it is newly gathered, putting it in parte where it may distill of it selfe, (the more subtill) is the perfectest and best of all.
Others there be that do presse it, because the more quantitie thereof may be taken out, they bring it for merchaundise, for that they vse to dresse Gloues therwith for the common people, and in this trade there is much spent.
It is vsed in Medicine for many diseases, and it is of greate vertue to heale colde diseases, for it healeth excellently well al partes wheresoeuer it be applied, it dissolueth and mollifieth any maner of hardnes, taking away the paynes: it dissolueth the hardnesse of the Mother, and openeth the opilations thereof.
It prouoketh the Monethly course in women, and it maketh soft any maner of hard thing.
And it is to be noted, that many doe bring this Storax very thin from the Indias, which is not so good, for because that they make it of the bowes of the trees, cut in peeces, and sodden, and they gather the fatnes that swimmeth vpon: and the Indians doe sell the buddes of the trees whereout the Liquid Amber is taken, made in handfulles, doe sell it in their market places, for to put amongst their clothes, which causeth them to smell, as of the water of Angels, for this purpose the Spaniards doe vse it.
THey doe bring from the newe Spayne that licour most excellent, which for his excellencie and meruellous effectes, is called Balsamo an imitation of the true Balsamo that was in the land of Egypt, and for that it doeth such great workes, and remedie so many infirmities, there was geuen to it such a name.
It is made of a tree greater than a Powngarnet Tree, it carrieth leaues like to Nettles: the Indians doe call it Xilo and we doe call the same Balsamo
It is made two maner of waies, the one is by the way of incision, cutting the rynd of the Tree, which is thinne, geuing many small cuttinges, out of the which there commeth a clammish licour, of colour white, but it is little and moste excellent, and very perfect.
The other fashion is, whereby the Indians doe vse too take out licour of the trees, which is a common vse amongst them is this: take the bowes and the great peeces of the trees, and make them as small, as they can, and then cast them into a greate kettle, with a good quantity of water, so boyle them vntill they see it sufficiently done, and afterwarde they let it coole, and gather vp the oyle that doeth swimme therevppon with certayne shelles, and that is the Balsamo that commeth too these partes, and that commonly is vsed: the colour therof is Alborne, which is likened to blacke, it is of most sweet smel, and very excellent.
It is not conuenient, nor it ought to bee kept in any other vessel then in siluer, (Glasse or Tinne, or any other thing glassed, it doeth penitrate and doeth passe through:) the vse thereof is onely in thinges apperteining to Medicine, and it hath been vsed of long time, well neere since the new Spaine ws discouered, for that incontinent the Spaniardes had knowledge of it, because they did heale therewith the woundes that they did receiue of the Indians, being aduised of the vertue thereof by the same Indians, and they did see the saide Indians heale and cure themselues therewith.
When it first came into Spayne, it was esteemed as much as it was reason it shoulde be, for that they did see it make meruellous woorkes, one ownce was woorth tenne Duccates and vpwardes, and now it is better cheape: the first time that they carried it to Rome, it came to be woorth one ounce, one hundreth Duccats: after that they brought so much and such great quantity, that it is nowe of small value: this commeth of the abundance of thinges.
And when it was very deere all men tooke profite of the profite of it, and since it came to bee of so lowe a Price, it is not so muche esteemed beeyng the same Balsamo that it was then when it was woorth one hundreth Duccates the ounce.
Surely if the Indias had not beene discouered, but onely for the effecte, to send vs this meruellous licour, the labour had been wel employed which our Spaniardes pages missing] vntill the woundes be whole, and for this cause the vse therof is a common medicine in all surgery for poore folkes, seeing that as with one medicine all effectes are wrought therewith, that are necessary: it is a common thing to say, that when one is hurt, let Balsamo be put therevnto, and so they doe, it doth heale them.
In the woundes of Sinewes it woorketh a meruellous effect, for that it doeth both cure heale.
It healeth better then any other medicine doeth, it resisteth colde, the wounds of the head it healeth very well, not hauing the Skull broken, nor perished.
Any manner of woundes beyng freshe it doeth heale in any parte of the bodie wheresoeuer they bee, so that there be no more in it but a simple wounde.
In ioyntes what manner of wounde soeuer it bee, it doeth make a maruellous woorke: The vse thereof is very common in this Citie, in woundes.
For that you haue fewe houses, but you haue Balsamo in them for this effect, so that in wounding of any person foorthwith they goe to the Balsamo for with little quantitie thereof they doe cure and heale, and many times with putting of it once euery thirde day, they finde the wounde whole.
In olde sores applied by it selfe, or with any other oyntment, it doeth mundifie, and fill them vppe with fleshe.
In large feuers Paroxismales beyng layde halfe an houre before the colde doeth come, vppon the moulde of the very hot, the patient being very well couered with clothes, and taking forthwith or sixe droppes thereof in wine, it taketh away the colde, in three or foure times doing it.
It is of a sharpe sauour and somewhat bitter, wherby are seen the partes and that it hath: it is hot and dry in the second degree.
will not let to write of a certayne Hearbe, which the of the newe Spaine doe vse for the remedy of their wounds, and shottes of arrowes, which vnto them was a great remedie in troubles, and it was by an Indian, which was Seruaunt too a Spaniarde called Iohn Infant.
He was the first that vsed it, they did call it, and doe call it at this present day, the of Iohn Infant this hearbe is little, they gather it greene, and beate it, and so they lay it simply vpon the wound: it doth restraine and stoppe the blood, and if it be a wounde in the it doth cause it to growe together, and it by glewing the partes.
The woundes of the Sinewes, and other partes it doth comfort, mundifie, and ingendreth flesh in them vntill they be whole, and because they doe not find this hearb in all places, they bring it made into pouder, for that it woorketh the same effect as well as being greene, and the pouder, as some say, doth it better than the hearbe.
As this hearbe, so likewise haue you many other in all the other partes of the Indias, that haue the same and other properties doe woorke meruellous effects: and to write of euery one of them particularly, it were needefull to make a greater volume, then wee doe pretende of this that we shall entreate of.
Three thinges they bring from our Occidentall Indias, which at this day bee celebrated in all the worlde, and with them they haue made doe make the greatest workes that euer were made in medicine, there were neuer the like made, by any other medicine that vnto this day hath beene knowen, for that the nature of al three is to cure infirmities which without this remedy be incurable, and to woorke the effectes that doe seeme to bee thinges of woonder, and these are notorious, not onely in these parts, but in all the worlde: the which thinges are the wood that is called Guaiacan the China and the Sarcaparillia
And for that it seemeth that the China doth come from Portingall and that the Portingales doe bring it from their Orientall Indias, and not fro~ ours, wil say what is to be said herafter when we do speak thereof.
And therefore let vs beginne with Guaiacan as of remedie that first came from the Indias, and as first of the best of all, as experience hath shewed, and the vse thereof in so many yeares.
THe Guaiacan that is called the wood of the Indias was discouered forthwith, whe~ the first Indias were fou~d, which was the Island of Sancto Domingo where is great quantity thereof.
There was an Indian that gaue knowledge thereof to his Maister, in this maner.
Ther was a Spaniard that did suffer great paines of the Poxe, which he had taken by the company of an Indian woman, his seruant being out of the Phisitions of that countrie vnto him the water of Guaiaca~ wherewith not onely his grieuous paynes were taken away that he did suffer, but he was verie well of the euill: with the which many other Spaniardes, that were infected with the same euill were healed also, the which was communicated immediatly, with them that came from thence, hither to Seuill and from thence it was diuulged throughout all Spaine, and from thence through all the world, for that the infection was sowen abroade throughout all partes thereof: and surely for this euill it is the best, the most chiefe remedy of as many as hitherto haue been found, and with most assuraunce, and most certeintie, it healeth and cureth the sayde disease, if they be wel handled: and this water as it ought to be, it is certaine that it healeth it most perfectly, without turning to fall againe, except the sicke man doe returne to tumble in the same bosome, where he tooke the first infection.
Our Lord God would from whence the euill of the Poxe came, from thence shoulde come the remedy for them.
Since it is knowne that they came into these parts from the Indias, and first of all from Sancto Domingo
The Poxe bee as common amongest the Indians, and as familiare, as the Measelles bee vnto vs, and well neere the most part of the Indians, both men and women haue them, without making thereof any scruple, and they came first in this sorte.
in the warres that the Catholike King made in Naples, with King Charles of France, that was called Greathead, in this time sir Christofer Colon, returned from the discouerie that hee had made of the Indias, which was Sancto Domingo and other Ilands, he brought with him from Sancto Domingo a great number of Indians, both men and women, which he carried with him to Naples, where the Catholike king was at that tyme, who had then concluded the warres, for that there was peace betweene the twoo Kinges, and the hostes did communicate together, the one with the other.
And Colon being come thither with his Indians, the most part of them brought with them the fruite of their countrie, which was the Poxe.
And the Spaniardes began to haue conuersation with the Indian women, in such sorte, that the men and women of the Indias, did infect the Campe of the Spaniardes, Italians, and Almaines, for the Catholike king had then of all these Nations, and there were many that were infected with the euill.
And after the hostes commoned together, the fire did kindle in the campe of the king of Fraunce, of which it folowed, that in short tyme the one and the other were infected with this euill seede: and from thence it hath spred abrode into all the worlde.
At the beginning it had diuerse names: the Spaniards did thinke that it had beene giuen them by the Frenchmen, and they called it the Frenche euil.
The Frenchemen thought that in Naples, and by them of the Countrie, the euill had beene giuen them, and they called it the euil of Naples.
And they of Almaine seing that by conuersation with the Spaniardes, they came by it, they called it the Spanishe Skabbe, and other called it the Measelles of the Indias, and that very truely, seing that from thence came the euill in the beginning.
Amongest the great Phisitions of that tyme, there were sundry great opinions of the cause, and originall of the infirmitie.
The one sorte sayde that it came of the euil melancholie meates, that the hostes of necessitie had eaten, as wilde hearbes, and many gardeine hearbes, and rootes of hearbes, Asses, and Horses, and other lyke things, that ingender such lyke infirmities, corrupting and burnyng the blood.
Others there were, that did attribute it to the coniunctions of Saturne and Mars, and they did apply it to the heauenly influence, and gaue thereuntoo diuers and sundry names.
Some called it the Leprosie, others Swine Poxe, other Mentegra, others the Deathly euill, others Elephansia, without certaine assurance what disease it was.
For they were ignoraunt that it was a newe disease, and they would reduce it to some already knowen and written of.
And nowe we come to our Guaiacan whose name was giuen by the Indians, and of them very well knowen, and so they haue called it and do call it, in all the world, calling it also the woodde of the Indias.
Of this woodde many haue written and much, one sort sayeng that it was Ebano others that it was a kinde of Boxe, with many other names wherby they haue named it.
It is a new tree and neuer seene in our partes, nor in any other of the discoueries, as the country is newe, so is the tree a newe thing also.
Whatsoeuer it be, it is a great tree, of the greatnesse of an Oke: it casteth out many vowes, the rinde it doth cast from it being dry, greate, and full of Gumme, the hart thereof is very great, it is well neere lyke to blacke, all is very hard as much and more then Ebano is.
It casteth forth a little leafe and hard· and euery yeere it bringeth foorth yellow flowers, out of the which is ingendered a round fruite, with litle kernelles within it, of the greatnesse of a Medler: of these Trees there is greate aboundance in Sancto Domingo
And after this they haue founde an other Tree, of the kind of this Guaiacan in Saint Iohn de Puerto Rico which is an other Ilande neere to that of Sancto Domingo such an other tree as that is, sauing that it is lesse, the body of the tree and the bowes are smaller, it hath scarsely any harte, or if it haue any, it is very little, and that is in the body of the tree, for that the bowes haue none at all: It is of more sweete smel and more bitter then the Guaiacan that is nowe vsed in our tyme, meane that of Sancto Domingo and for his maruellous effectes, they call it the holy Woode, surely with reason: for that it is of a better working then that of Sancto Domingo which is seene by experience, but euen aswell the one the other is a maruellous remedy, to cure the disease of the Poxe: of the which and of euery one of them a water is made, and is taken for this infirmitie, and for many others in this forme.
They take twelue ounces of the wood made small, and twoo ounces of the Rinde of the same woodde broken, and they cast it to steepe in three Pottels of Water, in a newe pot, that will holde somwhat more, for the space of xxiiii. houres: and the pot being well stept, they seeth it ouer a soft fire of kindled Coales, vntill the twoo Pottels bee sodde away, and one remayning.
And this is to be noted at the time the water is put to it, putting therein one Pottle, they dip in a little Rodde, and doe marke howe high the water of one Pottle reacheth, and by that measure and marke they shall see when the twoo are sodde away, and the one Pottell remayneth.
After the water is sodden, they set it to coole, straine it, and keepe it in a glassed vessell, and forthwith vppon the said sodden woodde, they poure foure Pottels of water, and seeth it till one bee sodden away, and this water must bee strayned and kept apart, and it must bee taken in this forme.
After that the sicke man is purged by the counsell of a Phisition, let him be put into a warme Chamber, and kept from the colde and from ayre, and beeing laied in his bedde, let him take early in the morning tenne ounces of Water, of that which was first made wel warmed, and let him bee couered so that he may sweate wel, let him kepe his sweat at the least two houres, after he hath swet, let him be made cleane from his sweat, take a warme Shirt, and the rest of his Linen clothes, foure houres after he hath swette, let him eate Reasings, Almonds and Bisket, and that in reasonable quantitie.
Then let him drinke of the water that was made at the second tyme, the quantity that he hath need of, and of the selfe same let him drinke in the day time, eight houres after hee hath eaten, let him returne to take the first water, and let him take other tenne ounces well warmed, and then sweate other houres, and after his sweate let him bee made cleane, and then bee couered againe with warme cloathes, and one houre after hee hath swet, let him make his supper of the same Reasings, Almonds, and Bisket, and drinke of the second Water.
This order he must obserue the first fiftiene daies, except hee haue some notable weaknesse, and in such case her must bee succoured with geuing him to eate of a young Chicken, iointly, with the rest of the Diet: and in them that be leane, that cannot beare so precise Diet, it is sufficient that they take it for nine dayes, and at the end of them they may eate a little Chicken rosted, if in case the sicke person be debilited, and that he cannot suffer the Diet, let him haue from the beginning a very small Chicken, going forwarde increasing in the proces of tyme, and beeing past the
dayes, let him returne to purge himselfe at the sixtiene dayes end, let him take the waight of fiue shillinges of the substaunce of Canafistola taken out by Strayner or other thing respondent thereunto, and that day let him drinke no strong Water, but of the simple, and the next day after the Purgation, let him returne to the aforesayde order, taking in the morning and euening the strong water with his sweatinges, and eating and drinking the same.
Sauing that in place of a Chicken hee may eate halfe a rosted Pullet, or somwhat more, and this seconde tyme let him take it for other xx. daies, in the which tyme hee may ryse, and walke about his chamber, being apparelled and kept warme.
And at the end of them, hee shall returne to purge him selfe an other tyme, and must haue a speciall care to keepe good order, and after hee hath take~ the water for other fortie dayes, must keepe himselfe from women and from wyne especially: and in place of wyne, hee must drinke the simple water of the woodde, which if he wil not doe, then let him drinke of water sodden with Anise seede or Fenell seede, supping little at night and eating no flesh.
This is the best way that the water of the wood ought to be taken, which doeth heale many infirmities incurable, where other Medicines could not worke the same effect, this water is the best remedy that is in the worlde, to heale the disease of the Poxe, whatsoeuer or of what kinde soeuer it bee, for that it rooteth it out for euer without any more comming againe, and in this it hath his principal prerogatiue and excellencie.
This water is also good for the Dropsy, for the shortnes of breath, for the Falling sicknes, for the diseases of the Bladder, and of the Raynes, for the paynes of the Ioynts, for all euils caused of cold humors, for ventositie, and other dangerous and importunate diseases, where the ordinary benefites of Phisicions haue not profited.
Chiefly it excelleth where the euil dispositions be, that haue proceeded at any tyme from the disease of the Poxe.
There be many that with this wood haue made sundry mixtures, making Syropes therof, and surely with good effect.
But my iudgement and opinion is, that he which shall take the water of the wood, ought to take it in the maner as is aboue saide, without any mingling thereof, for that by expeperience it hath beene seene so to make the better woorke.
This water is good for the teeth, making them white, and fastning them, by continual washing of them therewith: it is hot and dry in the second degree.
THe Second Medicine that commeth from our Indias, is a roote called the China
It seemeth that should slaunder it, to say that the China groweth in our Occidental Indias, since commonly the Portingales doe bring it from the Orientall Indias.
By this you shall vnderstande, that Syr Frauncis de Mendosa a Knight, when hee came from the newe Spayne and Peru, shewed to mee a greate Roote, and other little rootes, who asked mee, what rootes they were? aunswer that they were rootes of the China but that they seemed to mee to bee very freshe.
Hee sayde to mee, that so they were, and that it was not longe since that they had beene gathered and brought from the new Spaine.
maruelled that they had it there, for did beleeue that in the China only it had growen: he said vnto mee, that not only there was in the newe Spaine the China but that also wee shoulde see brought greate quantitie of Spicerie from the place which that China came from.
And beleued it when saw the contract that he made with his maiestie, to bring into Spaine great quantitie of spicerie, that hee had begon to set and to plante, and saw greene Ginger brought from thence, as also the China
This China is a roote lyke to the roote of a cane with certaine knottes within it, whyte and some with the whytenesse hath an alborne colour: it is red without, the best is the freshest, that which hath no holes, if it bee weightie, and not worme eaten, and that it haue a fatnes as if it were congeled, and it hath an vnsauery cast.
This Roote doeth growe in the China which is the Orientall Indias neere to Siria and Sirciana
It groweth neere to the Sea, onely with the roote they helpe themselues, with the which the Indians bee healed of grieuous diseases.
And therfore they haue it in great estimation: they do heale al maner of large diseases therewith: and also the sharpe diseases: especially Agues, with the Water of it, prouoking Sweats, and by this way they heale many.
It is wel neere xxx. yeeres since that the Portingales brought it to these parts with great estimatio~, for to heale al manner of diseases, and especially the disease of the Poxe, in the which it hath wrought greate effectes, and the Water is giuen in this forme.
The sicke person beeing purged as is most conuenient, must take one of the Rootes and cut them small vnto the thicknesse and greatnes of a three penny peece, and so being cut, shall way one ounce, and cast it into a newe Pot, and thereupon shall poure three Pottels of Water, and so shall lye a sleeping there xxiiii. houres, and the Pot beeing stopt, let it seeth at a soft fire of kindled Coales, vntill half be sodden away, one Pottel half remaine, and this is to be knowen by the order of the Measure as aforesaid, in the water of the Wood.
And after that it is colde, let it bee strained and kept in a glassed vessel.
There must be care taken, that it stande in some hotte or warme place neere to the fire, for that therwith it doeth preserue the vertue the better, and dureth longer tyme, before it be corrupted.
The sicke man being lodged in a close conuenient Chamber, must take in the morning fasting tenne ounces of the sayde water, as hotte as he can suffer it, and he shall procure sweat, keepe it two houres at the least.
After the sweat hee shal bee made cleane, and shall take a Shirte, and cleane clothes, warme them, and shall lye downe againe twoo or three houres in the bed quietly, after hee hath swet.
And afterwarde let him apparell himselfe, and beeing well warmed remayne in his Chamber, in the which he shal be kept from cold the open with all the pleasure of good company and conuersation: he shal eate at xi. of the clocke, halfe a Chicken sodden, or a quarter of a Henne, with a little Salt.
At the beginning of dinner he shal drinke a dishfull of Broth, and foorthwith eate of the Pullet, eating at the beginning a little, and hee shal ende with Marmelade.
His drinke shal bee of the water hee tooke in the morning, for that heere is no more then one water, hee may at the beginning after the Broth is taken, begin too eate Reasinges, without theyr little Graynes, or Prunes without theyr stones: theyr bread must bee Crustie, well baked, or Bisket.
If hee will drinke in the day tyme, hee may doe so with taking of a little Conserua, and drinke of the same water, and beeing houres past his Dinner, let him lye downe in his Bedde, and take other tenne ounces of the same water, the which being hotte hee may drinke, and procure sweate: two houres after he hath sweat, let him be made cleane, and take a cleane shirte, and cleane clothes warme, and after one houre let him sup with Co~serua, Reasinges and Almondes, with some Bisket, and drinke of the selfe same water, and last of all eate Marmelade, vpon the which he may not drinke.
Thus he may continue xxx. dayes continually, without neede of any more Purgation then the first, and hee may sit vp, so that he go wel cloathed, vsing in this tyme all content and mirth, and keeping him selfe from al that may offend him.
After that he hath taken this water in this sort, hee must keepe good order, and good gouernement for fortie dayes continually.
And hee must drinke no Wine, but water made of the China that was before sodden, the which hee shall keepe after it is sodden, setting it to dry in a shadowie place, and that China being dry, must be kept to make water for other
dayes, to drinke after the taking of the first water: seething one ounce thereof in three Pottels of water one halfe be sodden away, and this water let him drinke continually.
And aboue all thinges let him keepe himselfe from women: and he must alwayes haue care, that as well in the water of xxx. dayes, as in the water of the fourty daies, that the China be steeped in the water xxiiii. houres before it be sodden.
There be many diseases healed with this water, al kinds of euill of the Poxe, all olde Sores, it resolueth all swellinges and knobbes, it taketh away the paynes of the ioyntes which they call the Arthetica Goute, and any other kinde of Goute that is in any particular member or place, and especially the Sciatica, it taketh away olde paynes of the head and of the stomake.
It healeth all manner of runninges of Rewmes, it dissolueth Opilations and healeth the Dropsie.
It maketh a good colour in the face, it taketh awaie the Iaundies, and all euill complexion of the Liuer rectifieth it, and in this it hath a greate prerogatiue.
It healeth the Palsey all infirmities of the Sinewes, it healeth all diseases of Urine, it taketh away Melancholy, and all infirmities comming of colde diseases.
It doth comfort the stomake, it doth dissolue windes meruellously, and also Agues long and sharp, as quotidians: the taking of this water as it is conuenient, so doth it roote them out, and take them away.
The which thing it doeth by prouoking of sweat, in this it doth exceede all other Medicines, and some will say that in Pestilent Agues, by prouoking sweat it healeth them.
It is dry in the second degree with very litle heate, the which is seene by the other waters of the wood.
And as Sarcaparillia which doth heate and drie, so this doth not, nor leaueth any impression of heate.
Surely it is a notable Medicine, in the which haue founde greate effectes for the Diseases which haue of.
THE Sarcaparillia is a thing brought into our partes since the China
It is xx. yeeres since yt the vse thereof came to this city.
It first came fro~ the new Spaine, the Indians did vse it for great medicine, with the which they did heale many and diuers diseases.
It is a plant which doth cast many rootes vnder the ground, being of a yeard long, of the colour of a cleere Tawny, sometimes the rootes shoote so deepe, that to take them out all, it is needfull to dig a Mans length.
It casteth foorth certaine bowes full of knottes, that quickly do drie, and we know not that they haue carried flowers or fruite at all.
After that the Sarcaparillia of the newe Spayne was founde, there was also found in the Hunduras an other sort that was better, and of better effectes: it is knowne to be of the Hunduras because that it is of colour Tawnie, and grosser than that of the newe Spayne, the which is white, and somewhat like to yellowe, and more small, and so the Sarcaparillia that is most like to blacke is best.
It ought to be freshe, and in this is all the goodnes therof, it is knowne to be fresh by not beyng Worme eaten.
For that at the freshe breaking of it long wise, in the middest it maketh a running out to the end, and casteth out no dust, and the heauier it is, the better it is.
The Spaniardes did call it Sarcaparillia when they saw it, for the great likenes that it hath with the Sarcaparillia of these partes.
haue it for certayne, that the Sarcaparillia of these partes, and of the Indias, is all one, and the verie same that ours is.
The which haue experimented manie times, ours worketh the effect that the Sarcaparillia of the new Spaine doth, it is like vnto that of the Hunduras but it is of a bitter tast, and not very sharpe, and the water that it yeeldeth hath no more sauour then barley water hath.
The vse of this hearbe at the first did differ muche from that which is now in experiment, for that they gaue it as the Indians did, in the healing of their sicke folkes, and surely it did worke very great effects.
But the delicatenesse of our time doth require that it should be vsed and geuen as the water of the wood is.
At the beginning they took of the Sarcaparilla much quantitie, more then halfe a pounde, did cut it small and breake it, and cast it into a quantitie of water, and being well wet they beate it in a Morter a good while, in suche sorte that it was made like a Iellie, and then did straine it, pressing it very well, for there came out of it the likenesse of a thicke drinke.
And of that they tooke in the morning hot, one good Cup full, and then the Pacient clothed him selfe well.
And sweete two houres, and if in the day time they woulde drinke any thing, it should bee of the selfe same thicke drinke, so made by expression hot, and then they swete as much in the morning.
This order they obserued for three dayes continually, without eating or drinking of other meate, sauing onely that thicke drinke, taken out by pressing or straining of the Sarcaparillia after this sort gaue it at the beginning many times, and surely it wrought great effects, and many sicke people did better recouer, then they doe nowe with this other fashion.
After there was inuented an other forme and manner to geue it, and is that which is now vsed, in this sort.
They take two ounces of Sarcaparillia and wash it and cut it small and then they put it into a newe earthen pot, and there vppon they poure three of water, and sette it in the water to steepe twentie and foure houres, and the Pot being well stopte, it must seeth on a soft fire of kindled coales, vntill the two Pottels bee sodden away, and the one remaine, the which may be knowne by the order of the measure, that we spake of, and when it is colde, let it be strained into a glassed vessel, and vpon the selfesame Sarcaparillia that is sodde~, let there be so much water powred in agayne that the pot be filled, let it boyle a reasonable time, and kept in a vessel glassed.
Nowe the sicke Man beeyng purged, as it seemeth most conuenient, and placed in a warme Chamber, he must take in the morning ten ounces, of the first water of the Sarcaparillia and must sweate at the least twoo houres, and after sweate he must be made cleane from his sweate, and take a warme shirt, and warme clothes, and the like hee must doe at night, eight houres after he hath eaten his Dinner, changing his shirt and hot apparrell.
He must dine at eleuen of the clocke, and suppe one houre after he hath sweat, at night eating nothing but Reasinges, Almondes, and Bisket, and drinking of the second water.
Let him keepe this order fifteene daies, and if he be weake, geue him a little rosted chicken, increasing it in processe of time, at the least hee must keepe his bed niene dayes at the first beginning, and the rest of the time in his chamber, kept from colde, and from ayre, and on the fifteene day he must be purged, with a soft and an easie medicine, and likewise on the thirty day, in such sorte, that all the order that we haue prescribed, be kept, as in the manner of the taking of the water of the wood is already declared.
he must haue good gouernment, for other fourty dayes, not drinking any wine, but simple water made of the said Sarcaparillia and keeping himselfe from women.
This is the ordinarie manner in taking of the water of Sarcaparillia which at this day is vsed.
And because haue experience of other wayes that bee of great secret, and of great effectes, will write them heere, to the end that all the vertues which are in the Sarcaparillia may be set downe and declared, seeyng it is the Medicine that is moste vsed, and that wee doe see in it so greate and rare effectes.
doe make a Sirupe, that many yeeres hath been celebrated, and had in estimation in this citie, and in all Spaine for that it is xxvi. yeres since vsed it first for the disease of the Poxe, for other infirmities: which Syrupe doth not heate nor inflame, but with great temperature, according to the graduation, woorketh his good effects.
The first, for whom this thing was ordayned and deuised, was for Pantelion de Negro Ienoues who was had in cure by many Phisitions, and hauing taken the water of the Wood, and other Medicines, was well neere consumed: and with a grieuous swelling sore vppon his shinne bone, and great paynes in it, hee tooke it, and was healed very well.
This sirupe haue vsed in many people for the infirmitie that the Sarcaparilla doth profite for, and the wood and for many other, and it hath a good effect in woorking by degrees: for that the drinesse of the wood is taken away, and the heate of the Sarcaparilla and it is made in this forme.
There must bee taken two ounces of Sarcaparilla and foure ounces of Paulo Sancto which is the holie Wood, prepared as it is saide, and three Doozen of Acoseifas a fruite of Spayne, without their stones, and two Doozen of Prunes, without their stones, and halfe an ounce of the flowres of Borage, and an other halfe ounce of Uiolettes and some graynes of Barley made cleane, that is too say, the huskes taken away.
All these thinges let them bee cast into three Pottles of water and lette them bee sodden on a soft fire, vntill it come to one Pottell, and then let it be strayned, and vnto tenne ounces of this decoction let there be put one ounce of the Sirupe of Uiolettes.
Let it be taken hotte in the morning, and at night in the order aboue sayde.
In the rest of the water, keeping sweet if ther bee any, and although there come little, yet they bee healed.
They may eate a little Chicken from the first day, with the rest of the diet, drinke the simple water of the Sarcaparilla which is to be made with halfe an ounce of Sarcaparillia sodden in foure of water, vntill one or somewhat more, be sodden away.
This order doeth heale all kinde of euill of the Poxe, and all the infirmities that we haue spoken of, that the water of the Wood doeth heale, and the China and the Sarcaparillia
Which to repeate, it shall be too long and too prolixious, because it it is sufficie~tly declared before.
For surely in this simple water, and in the foresaide decoction, haue found great effectes, well in the infirmities wherein is suspected the euill of the Poxe, as in large and importunate diseases, in the which the common remedies of haue not profited, which although they proceeded not of the French Poxe, yet doeth it cure and heale them, as it is seene by the woorke of him that vseth it.
There is an other Sirupe to bee made of the Sarcaparillia which is: taking eight ounces of Sarcaparillia being broken or cutte, and seething it in foure pottelles of water, vntill three be sodden away and the one remaine, and into the water that shall remayne, to put to foure pounde of Sugar, and make a perfect Sirupe.
And of this Sirupe too take three ounces in the morning and three at night, eating good meates, and to suppe litle, and drinke onely the simple water of the Sarcaparillia and goyng out of the house, and doyng his buisinesse.
There are healed therwith many diseases without geuing any molestation in the healing of them.
And this must be taken till the Sirupe bee all consumed.
Also this Sarcaparillia is taken in pouder, in this maner.
They take the Sarcaparillia and plucke awaie from it the heare within it, and dry it and grynde it, and then sifte it through a syue of silke, and make it in Pouder.
Of this Pouder is taken in the infirmity of the Poxe, or spice of them, the weight of sixe pence, drinking it with the simple Water of the Sarcaparillia taking it in the Morning, and as night, as much when he goeth to bedde.
Hee must eate good meates, and drinke no Wine, but the simple water thereof.
It shall doe well he be purged that shall begin to vse it.
And although that this pouder doth heale many diseases large and temporall, one cure it doth meruellously, which is the salte Fleume of the handes and feete, in this forme.
The sicke man being purged, and also without purging, if he cannot otherwise doe, hee shall take the Pouder as it is sayde, and vpon the salt Fleume, he shall lay with a Feather, a little of the water of Sublimatum delayed with Rosewater, that it be very simple, and after it is layed on all partes where the salt Fleume is, then let there be put vpon it a plaister, that is called of William or Dia Palma spread abroade thin vpon Sattin or Taffeta, too bee applied in all parts where the simple water of Sublimatum was put.
This must be done euery day, for that in fifteene daies he shall be perfectly whole.
This doth mundifie and incarnate, and skin without hauing need of any other medicine, ioyntly with the Pouder and the simple water of Sarcaparillia which wee haue spoken of.
This is of so great effect, and experimented, as they shall see by the worke that shall vse it, for surely they shall be whole thereby.
The vse of the water of the Sarcaparillia is so greate at this day in this forme, as is sayd, that it is applied in anie disease, it is come into so much credit, that in anie maner of Reumes or runnings, or windinesse, the euill of Women, of the Mother, or any other cause or occasion whatsoeuer, so that it bee not in Feuers or other sharpe diseases, men take the vse of the simple Water of the Sarcaparillia and this is at this day so put in vse, that in like sort you shall finde the simple sodden Water of Sarcaparillia in manie houses, as ordinary water in yearthen vessels, and surely it woorketh greate effectes, and doeth remedie large and importunate diseases.
Trueth it is, that the persons that bee hotte of complexion, it doeth beate them more then is conuenient, and so they cannot drinke it, and moste of all if that their Liuer be very hotte, for that it heateth too much.
In womens diseases as well of the Mother, as of colde humours, it woorketh good effectes, and doeth dissolue windes.
And in persons that bee subiect to manie euilles, and especially of Reumes, and olde greeffes and diseases caused of the euill humours, if they runne this course, with the continuance thereof, they shall receiue manifest profite and benefite, and it doeth heale all deseases whiche they neuer thought to be healed of.
The complexion thereof hotte and drie, well neere in the seconde degree.
All these waters must be giuen in Sommer, or in the ende thereof: it is better that the season exceede in heate then in colde.
Of the blood Stone, and of the Stone for the diseases of the Stone of the Kidneies and Reines.
THEY doe bring from the new Spaine twoo stones of greate vertue, the one is called the Stone of the Bloode, and the other is a Stone for the desease of the Stone in the Kidneis and Raines, The Blood Stone is a kinde of Iasper of diuers colours somewhat darke, full of sprincles, like to blood, being of colour redde, of the which stones the Indians doe make certaine Hartes both greate and small.
The vse thereof, bothe here and there, is for all fluxes of blood in what partes soeuer it bee, of the Nose, or of the Menstrues, or of the Piles, and of Woundes, or of that which is cast out at the mouth.
The stone must bee wette in colde water, and the sicke Man must take it in his right hande, and from time to time wette it in colde water.
And as touching the Indians, they haue it for certayne, that touching the same stone, in some parte where the blood runneth, it doeth restrayne, it and in this they haue greate trust, for that the effect hath beene seene.
It doeth profite also hauing it holden, hanged, or tyed in the same parte where the blood runneth, so that it touch the fleshe.
Of this stone wee haue seene great effectes, in staunching of blood.
And some that doe suffer the Hemeroidall fluxe, haue remedied themselues with making Ringes of this stone, and wearing them continually vpon theyr fingers.
The other Stone, which is for the disease of the stone in the Kidneies or Reines, the finest of them are like vntoo Plasma of Esmeraldes which are lykened to greene with a Milkishe colour, the greatest are the best: they bring them made in diuers formes and fashions, for so the Indians had them in old tyme, some lyke to fishes, other like to the heads of byrds, other like to billes of Popingaies, other lyke to round Beadstones, but all pearsed through, for that the Indians did vse to weare them hanging for the effect to take away the grief of the stone or for in those twoo sicknesses it sheweth maruellous effects.
The chief vertue that it hath, is in the paine of the stone in the Kidneis and Reines, and in expelling of Sande and stone.
In so much that a Gentleman which had one of them heere, the best of them that haue seene, hauing laid it to his arme, it made him to expell and cast out much sande, insomuch that many tymes hee doeth take it away, for that hee thinketh that it doeth hurte him for to voide so much, and in taking it away, hee ceaseth to voyde any from him: and when hee feeleth the paine of the stone, laying it too againe, it doeth take it away incontinent, with expelling of much Sande and small stones.
haue seene it carried to persons that haue beene afflicted with greate griefe, and paines of the saide disease, who putting it to them, doe forthwith expell the sande and the little stones, remain cleare thereof.
This stone hath a property hidden, by the which meanes it woorketh great effectes, to preserue men that they fall not into the paine of the sayd disease, and after it is come to take it away, or diminish it.
It doeth make the sande to bee expelled in great abundance, and likewyse stones.
It taketh away the heate from the reines of the backe, it profiteth in griefs of the stomake, layde vnto it: and aboue all it preserueth from the sayde grief.
My Ladie the Duchesse for that shee had in short space three tymes, exceeding paynes of the stone, shee made a bracelet of them, and vsed to weare it on her arme, and sithence she put them to her arme, she neuer had more paynes of the Stone: and so it hath happened to many other that founde the lyke benefite, for the which these stones are much esteemed: and now they be not so soone had, as at the beginning, for that the gentlemen, and rich men haue them onely, and with reason, because they do worke such maruellous effects.
An other stone there is that doth heale the salt fleume, the which knowe by hearesay only, but haue seene none of them.
Of the VVoodde for the euils of the Reines, and of the Vrine.
ALso they bring from the newe Spaine, a certayne woodde that is lyke vnto the woodde of a Peare tree, grosse and without knottes, the which they haue vsed many yeeres in these partes, for the paynes of the Reynes and of the Stone, and for the infirmities of the Urine.
The first tyme that sawe it vsed, may bee about xxxv. yeeres past.
There was a Pilot that was sicke of the Urine and of the Reines, and after that hee had vsed it, hee was whole and very well.
And sithence that tyme haue seene that many haue brought it from the new Spaine, and they doe vse it for these diseases following.
For them that cannot pisse liberally, and for the paines of the Reines, and of the stone, and for them that do pisse paine, and for them that doe pisse little.
And nowe the thing hath extended vnto opilations, for that the water therof doth cure and heale them, both of the Lunges and the Liuer, and this hath beene founde within these fewe yeres, and they doe finde in it notable profite.
They take the wood, and make it into smal peeces very shinne: and small as it is possible, and then put the~ into faire water of the Fou~taine, leaue it so vntil the water be sokened into it: and by putting the wood into the water, within halfe an houre the water doeth beginne to change it selfe into a blewe colour very cleare, and the longer that it lyeth in the water, so much the blewer it turneth, although that the wood bee of a white colour.
Of this water they doe drinke continually, and therewith they vse to water their wyne, and it worketh maruellous and manifest effectes, without any alteration, so that it needeth but onely good gouernement and regiment.
The water hath no more sauour then if there were nothing cast into it, for that the wood doeth chaunge nothing.
The complexion thereof is hotte and drye in the first degree.
Will not let to speake of the Peper that they bring from the Indias, which serueth not onely for Medicine, but it is otherwise most excellent, the which is knowen in all Spayne, for there is no Gardeyne, nor Orcharde, but that it hath plentie thereof in it, for the fairenesse of the fruite that it bringeth foorth.
It is a greate Plante, insomuch that haue seene in this Citie some that was equall with many Trees.
It doeth cast foorth the leaues greene, after the fashion of Basill of the biggest sort.
And it casteth foorth certain white flowers, out of the which commeth the fruite, the which is of diuerse formes: some Peper is long, other rounde, others of the making of Mellons, others of Cherries, but all is at the beginning when it is not type very greene, and beeing rype very redde, and with a gracious and good collour.
All the sortes are vsed in al manner of meates and pottages, for that it hath a better tast then the common Peper hath.
Beaten in peeces, and cast into broth it is an excellent sauce, they doe vse it in al thinges that the aromatike spices are vsed in, which are brought from Maluco and
It doeth differ from that of the East Indias, for that costeth many ducates, this other doth cost no more but to sowe it, for that in one plant you haue spice for one whole yere, with lesse hurte and more profite.
It doeth comforte much, it doeth dissolue windes, it is good for the breast, and for them that be colde of complexion: it doth heale and comforte, strengthening the principall members.
It is hotte and dry, well neere in the fourth degree.
They doe bring from diuers partes of our Indias many purgatiue Medicines, that haue beene found and discouered by continuance, whose workes and effectes are great: of the which wil giue here a short relation, that it may be an entrance for to entreate of the roote of Mechoacan which was our principal intent now to wryte of.
THere doeth come from the Ilandes of Sancto Domingo and from Sancte Iohn de Puerto Rico greate quantitie of Canafistola and it is so much, that not only all Spayne is prouided of it, but all Europe, and well neere all the worlde: for that vnto Leuant, from whence it was accustomably brought, now there goeth moe Shippes loden with it, then come with Iron from Biskeye.
That which commeth from our Indias, is much better in comparison then that which is brought from the East Indias to Uenis, and that which the Galleons do carry from thence to Genoua, and from Genoua to Spayne, for when the Merchantes brought it hither, it could not bee good, for that it was very small, and also it was not type, and with so long tyme continuance it became so corrupted, that it did profite little.
This of ours that they bring from Sancto Domingo and Saincte Iohn is rype, great, full, weightie, honilyke, and fresh.
In so much that many tymes it commeth in sixtie dayes after it is gathered, and beeing freshe, it is of a gratious and good tast, and not of so horrible smell, as that of Leuant is, and so it doeth his woorke farre better, with more facilitie.
This Canafistola and the woorke thereof is of greate securitie, it purgeth gently, without any alteration.
And doeth auoyde principally Choller, and after Fleume, and that which is in the wayes and the Guttes.
It doeth temper them much that take it, also it purifieth the blood, it doeth many good woorkes in all kinde of diseases, in especially in the paines of the Reines, and of vryne, being taken twoo houres before supper.
And in reumes it doeth much profite, being taken twoo houres after Supper, and easily it doeth cure the euilles of the breast, which haue of long continuance, griefes of the side, being taken with Syropes for the breast: and being applied outwardly with the Oyle of sweete Almondes, it taketh away the grieuous diseases of the Lunges, and griefes of the Reynes.
It is good in hotte Feuers, and vsing it continually before supper or dinner, it stayeth the ingendring of the stone, it taketh away the drieth.
it is moist in the first degree, it declyneth to heate, although it be little, it is dissoluatiue, it clarifieth the blood, and delayeth the sharpnesse therof, and of the red collour.
There haue beene in the Indias since it was discouered some thereof so weightie, that one codde waieth fiue shillinges, being taken out by the Seene, and foure ounces in weight the whole cane.
AT the beginning when they discouered the Indias, they brought from Sancto Domingo certaine Nuttes being three cornered, with the which the Indians did purge themselues, and were vnto them a familiar purgation.
And afterwardes the Spaniardes, for necessitie did purge themselues with them, with hazarde ynough of some of their liues, for with the vse therof, many thought to lose their liues, for that it is a strong purge.
And although that it doeth make a great excesse of stooles, yet doeth it also prouoke vomitte very strongly, and with much violence, with greate faintnesse and heauinesse.
Afterwarde some did rectifie them by costing of them, and then they be not so violent, nor so strong, neyther woorke with so much cause of fayntnesse.
It is an excellent Medicine for the Colike, it doeth dissolue windes, and putte in a glister it doeth euacuate reasonably.
The maner colour of them is as of our Nuttes, with a thinne rinde, of the colour of a cleare Baye, they are three cornerd, the carnell within is whyte, and sweete, insomuch that for their sweetnesse, many haue beene therwith.
The Phisitions doe call them commonly Ben of which there are twoo sortes, one they call greate, and the other little.
The great Ben bee these purgatiue Nuttes, the little Beu bee as great as our Peason, of the which in Italy they make that oyle of sweete smel, which they call Oyle of Ben with the which they do annoynt their heare, and beards for dilicatenesse.
Their complexion is hotte in the beginning of the third degree, and dry in the second.
Their weight is of halfe a dragme vnto one, but they must bee tosted.
THey doe bring from the newe Spayne certain Pinions or Carnels wherewith the Indians did purge themselues: they be like to our Pinions, which do growe out of our trees, being great after the fashio~ of the wheate of the Indias, the shale is not so hard as ours is, they are somewhat more blacke, they be round, and within very white, fattie, and sweete in tast.
They do purge valiantly Fleame and Colour, and any maner of waterishnes, they are more easie Medicine, then the Nuts be, they do purge by stoole, and by vomit, and if they be tosted they doe not purge so much, nor with so much faintnes.
They doe purge of their own nature grosse Humors: it is a Purgation much vsed amongest the Indians, being grounde and dissolued with Wyne, hauing first taken preparatiues that do attennuate the humor, that a man doeth pretende to euacuate, and vsing a conuenient Diet.
They take of them fiue or sixe more or conformably to the obedience of the stomacke, of him that shall take them.
Ordinarily they do tost them: for so they be more gentle and lesse furious.
It is needefull that hee which doeth take them, be kept as one being purged.
They be geuen in large infirmities, and where there bee grosse humors: they be hot in the thirde degree, and dry in the seconde with some fatnes, which doeth take away somewhat of the drynes.
FRom Cartagena and numbre de Dios they bring certaine Beanes lyke to the fashion of ours, sauing that they be somewhat lesse, and of the colour and making of ours, they haue in the middest of the Beane that doth deuide the two halues, one little thinne skinne, lyke to the skinne of an oynion.
They doe take them from theyr shale, and from the inner thinne skinne, and toste them and make them into pouder, and take them Wyne: and beeing made into pouder and mingled with Sugar, one sponeful of the pouder is taken, and vppon that a little draught of wyne.
They doe purge without molestation Choler and Fleame, and grosse mixt humors.
And amongst the Indians they are of great estimation, for the easinesse that they haue in the taking of them.
Many Spaniardes doe purge with them with much securitie, and it is a Medicine more easie and gentle than that aforesaide.
haue seene many that haue come from those partes, purge them therewith, and it succeedeth with them very well, and purgeth without griefe.
But they must be aduysed that there be taken from them that little skinne that is in the middest of the twoo halfes of the Beanes.
For if they take that, the strength of it is so much greater and vehement of Uomites and stooles, that they put in great hasarde him that shall take them And also they must haue care to coste them, for that it doeth prepare and delayeth much of the sharpenes, and fearsenes, which is generall in this Medicine, and in all the rest, for that to tost them is the true preparation of them.
After the taking of any of the foresaide Medicines the patient must not sleepe at al: it is needful that he keep great watch being purged, and in all thinges which in a man purged may be conuenient.
The Beanes be geuen prepared, in Feuers being large and importunate, and in diseases of mixt humours, beeyng grosse and in the paynes of the ioynts, they are an vniuersall Purgation: they be hotte in the second degree, dry in the first, there bee geuen of them from foure too sixe, more or lesse, as the obedience and sufferance of the bellie is of him that shall take them.
IN all the coast of the firme land they take out a certaine kind of milke, fro~ little trees.
like to Apple trees, which the Indians cal of the which cutting one bough, ther commeth forth whereas it is cut, a certayne kind of milke somewhat thicke clammy, and taking three or foure drops therof, it doth purge valiantly by the stoole principally Cholerike Humors, and Citrine water, and it doth work with much vehemencie and force.
It must be taken in Wyne, or dried into pouder in little quantitie, for that the worke thereof is of most strength.
It hath one property, that in eating or drinking of broth or wine or other thing foorthwith it woorketh no longer, and he that doth take it, hath need to keepe good watch, and good order, It is hot and dry in the third degree.
All these Medicines which we haue spoken of, be violent and of great force, they haue not beene muche vsed sithence the Mechoacan hath come, for that in it there is founde a woorke more sure, and vnto this not onely we, but all the Indians haue runne, as vnto a purge most excellent, of the which we will treate now.
THe Mechoacan is a root, that it may bee about xxx. yeeres that it was discouered, in the prouince of the new Spain, in the Indias, of the Occean Seas, it is brought from a Country that is beyonde the greate city of Mexico more then
leagues, is called Mechoacan the which Sir Fernando Curtes did conquere, in the yeere of our Lorde,
This is a countrie of much riches, of Gold and chiefly of siluer, and it is vnderstoode that in all that Countrie is, much siluer.
leagues, here those Mynes be so celebrated, and of so great riches, that they bee called the Cacatecas euery day they discouer in the lande verie riche mines of siluer, and some of Golde.
It is a countrie of good and holesome ayre, and doeth bring foorth healthfull hearbes for to heale many diseases, insomuch that at the time the Indians had the gouernment therof, the inhabiters there rounde about that Prouince, came thither too heale their diseases and infirmities.
For the said causes, it is a cou~trie very fruitfull, and of great abundance of bread, wilde foule, and fruites.
It hath many fountaines, and some of sweet waters, which haue much abundance of fish, the Indians of that countrie are of a tauller grouth, of better faces than the Borderers are, and much more healthfull.
The Principall place of that Prouince the Indians doe cal in their language Chincicila and the Spaniardes do cal it as they cal that Realme Mechoacan it is a great towne of Indians, situated neere to a lake, which is of sweete water, abounding with very much Fish.
The same Lake is in fashion of the making of an horseshoe, and in the midst therof standeth the Towne, the which at this hath greate trade of buying and selling, for the great Mynes of Plate that are in all that countrie.
As soone as that Prouince was gotten from the Indians, there went thither certain Friers of Sainct Frances order, as in a Countrie so far distaunt from theyr naturall soyle, some of them fell sicke, amongest whom the Warden, who was the chief Fryer of the house was one, with whome Caconcin Casique an Indian Lorde, a man of great power in that Countrie, had very great friendship, who was Lorde of al that Countrie.
The father Warden had a long sicknes and was brought in great danger of life: the Casique as hee sawe his disease proceede forwarde, saide that hee woulde bring him an Indian of his, which was a Phisition, with whome he did cure himself, it might be, that he would giue him remedy of his disease.
The which being hearde of the Frier, and seing the little helpe that hee had there, and the want of a Phisition, with other thinges of benefite, he thanked him, and desired him, that hee woulde bring him vnto him: who beeing come, and seeing his disease, to the Casique that if hee tooke a pouder, that he would giue him of a roote, that it woulde heale him.
The which beeing knowen to the Fryer, with the desire that he had of health, he accepted his offer, and tooke the pouder that the Indian Phisition gaue him, the nexte day, in a little wyne: with the which hee did purge so much, and paynes, that the same day hee was much lightned, and much more from that tyme forward, in such sort that he was healed of his infirmitie.
The rest of the Fryers which were sicke, and some Spaniardes that were sicke also, did follow the father Wardens cure, tooke of the selfesame pouder once or twise, as oft as they had neede of it, for to heale them.
The vse of the which went so well with them, that all they being healed, the Friers did send relation of this, to the father prouincial to Mexico wher he was, who did co~municate it with those of the countrie, geuing to the~ of the roote and comforting them that they shoulde take it, because of the good relation, that hee had from those Friers of Mechoacan
The which beyng vsed of many, and seeyng the meruellous woorkes that it did, the fame of it was extended all abroad, so that in short time, all the Country was full of the good workes and effectes thereof, vanishing the vse of Ruibarbe of Barberie, and taking the name thereof calling it of the Indias, as all men doe now commonly call it.
And also it is called Mechoacan for that it is brought from thence, gathered in the Prouince called
And not onely in Mexico and in that Countrie it doth take it as the most excellent purgation, and best of all other, but also in Peru and in all other partes of the Indias, they vse no other thing, neyther purge they with any other purge, and they take it with so much trust and easinesse, that when they take it, they thinke to haue certaynly theyr health, so they carrie it from the newe Spayne, as Merchaundise of very great price.
is about thirty and foure yeeres past, when sawe it heere the first tyme, when one Pasquall Catano a Genoues, came from the newe Spayne, who fell sicke at his comming, and as did cure him, at the time that woulde purge him, he sayde to me that he brought a Ruibarbe from the newe Spayne, that was a very excellent Medicine, with the which all they of Mexico did purge themselues, saying, that it was called Ruibarbe of Mechoacan and hee had beene purged many times therewith, and it had succeeded very well with hym, and if he shoulde take any purge, he woulde take that, of the which he had experience.
But caused him vtterly to forsake the vse of suche like Medicines, of the which there was nothing written nor knowne.
And did perswade with him to purge with the Medicines that we had heere, of the which there was so greate experience and knowledge, in written Authors.
And he did graunt to my woordes, and purged himselfe with a that gaue him, eue~ as it was for his disease.
By the which although that there did followe vnto him notable lightnesse, and profite: yet hee was not cleare of the disease in such sort, but that it was necessary to purge him an other time.
And when we came to the second purgation, hee woulde take none other but his owne Ruibarbe of Mechoacan with the which he did purge so well, that he remayned whole, and without any disease.
And although that this did like me well, neuerthelesse did not remaine satisfied, vntill many other that came at the same time, and fel sicke, did purge with the sayde Mechoacan and it went verie well with them, because they were accustomed to purge therewith in the newe Spayne: and seeyng the good works and so many thereof.
began to consider of it, and to purge many therewith, geuing credite to the good effectes that it wrought.
And so with these that did make experience of here, as also with the relation, and great credite of them, that came out of the newe Spayne (insomuch that the vse thereof hath spread abroade, that it is a common thing in all the worlde, and they doe purge therewith not onely in the newe Spaine, and the Prouinces of the Peru, but also in our Spayne, all Italie, Almaine, and Flaunders) haue sent relation therof, well neere to all Europe, as well in Latine, as in our natiue tongue.
The vse thereof is so muche, that they bring it for chiefe Merchaundise, in great quantitie, and it is solde for greate summes of monie: Insomuch that a seller of Drugges tolde me, besides that which he had sold for the Citie, he had solde foorth of the citie the last yeere, more than ten kintalles of it, which is a thousand pound weight, so that nowe they aske for Ruibarb of the Indias, for that it is so familiar, that ther is no husband man that doeth not vse it, as a most sure medicine, and of great effects, because for that kinde of purgation, there is no neede of a Phisition, as being that, vnto which all men geue most credite, as a thing determined and approoued for good.
haue talked with many of them that haue come from the newe Spayne, and in especially with them that haue beene in Mechoacan concerning the fashion of the plant that this roote is of, and what forme and figure it hath, the which they doe bring from the Countrie, within
leages of beyonde Mechoacan from a countrie which is called Colima and they haue so little care therein, seeyng that their principall intent is vnto theyr interest and gaine, that they know no more thereof, but that the Indians in Mechoacan doe sell it them, the rootes beyng drie and cleane, as hither they doe bring them, and the Spaniardes doe buy them, as a kind of Merchandise, and so send them to Spaine.
And surely in this we are woorthy of great reprehension· that seeyng that there are in the newe Spayne, so Hearbes, and Plantes, and other thinges Medicinable, of so much importaunce, there is not any that writeth of them, nor is it vnderstood, what vertues and formes they haue, for to accord them with ours: so that if men had a desire to search out, and experiment so many kinde of medicines, as the Indians doe sell in their Market places and Fayres, it would be a thing of great profite, and vtilitie to see and to knowe their and to experiment the variable and greate effectes, which the Indians doe publishe, and manifest with great proofe amongest themselues, which they haue of them: wee of our parte without any consideration doe refuse it, and suche as doe knowe their effectes, will not giue vs relation, nor knowledge what they are, nor write the efficacie and manner of them.
And goyng too searche after the Place of the Roote Mechoacan a Passenger that was come from that Prouince, did aduertise me that a Fraunces Frier, that was come from that Countrie, had brought in the shippe where he came, the proper Hearbe of Mechoacan greene, in a great barrell, and with muche care, which hee brought from beyonde Mechoacan and that hee had it in the Frierie of S. Frances of the City.
And hearing thereof did receyue greate contentment, and so went foorthwith to the Frierie, and at the doore of Infirmerie, or house for the sicke people of this Frierie, there was a thing like too halfe a Pipe, in the which there was an hearbe very greene, which they saide was the Mechoacan that the Frier had brought from the new Spayne, not with little labour.
It is an heath that groweth creeping vp by certaine little Canes, it hath a sadde greene colour, it carrieth certayne leaues, that the greatnesse of them may be of the greatnesse of a good Porenge dish, which are in compasse round, with a little point, the leafe hath his little Sienewes, it is small, well neere, without moysture, the stalke is of the colour of a cleere Tawnie.
They say that it casteth foorth certayne Clusters with little Grapes, of the greatnesse of a Coriander seede which are the fruite, and doe waxe rype by the Moneth of September: it casteth out many Bowes, which doth stretche a long vppon the Earth, and if you put any thing neere to it, it goeth creeping vpon it.
The Roote of the Mechoacan is vnsauerie, and without byting, or anie sharpenesse of tast.
That which wee doe see at this present of our Mechoacan is a roote which they bring from the new Spayne, from the Prouince of Mechoacan made in greate and little peeces, of them cutte in peeces, of them broken with their handes.
It is a white Roote, somewhat strong, and mighty, it appeareth that the peeces be of a great roote, without any heart.
The conditions, or elections that it must haue, for to be good and perfect is: that it be freshe, which may be knowne if that it be not worme eaten, nor blacke, and that it be somewhat white: but the very white is not so good, and if it bee somewhat russet, so that it be the vttermost parte of the root, for that the inner parte is somewhat white.
In the tasting or chewing of it, it is without sauour, or any manner of byting tast.
It importeth to make his worke the better if so be that it be freshe, for that the fresher it is, the better it is, and the greater the peeces are, the better they are conserued.
And it is true, that that which is brought in pouder, is not so good, for that it doeth putrifie, and lose much of the vertue, and operation.
As also we doe see, if we make pouder, and keepe it, it doeth not make so good woorke, as when the roote is ground, and then forthwith taken.
The roote beyng old doth turne blacke, and it will be worme eaten with holes, and become very light.
It is gathered in the moneth of October, and it neuer loseth his leafe.
The Complection thereof is hot in the first degree, and drie in the seconde, for that it hath subtill partes, with some bynding, whereby it seemeth that his woorke beyng done, it leaueth the interiour Members strengthened, without debilitation and weakenesse, which the other Purgatiue Medicines doe leaue them in: but rather those that doe purge themselues therewith, doe remayne after they be purged, more strong and harde, then before they were purged.
It hath no neede of rectification, for that wee doe not see in this roote any notable hurt, onely the Wine is vnto it a corroboration for the woorke, for being taken with Wine, it maketh a better worke, then with any other Licour, for that it doth not cause vomite, and it woorketh the better.
It is giuen at all tymes and in all Ages, it doeth his woorke without molestation, and without the accidentes that the other Medicines soluatiue are woont to procure.
It is a Medicine easie to bee taken, for that it hath no euil cast.
Onely it hath the sauour of that with the which it is taken, for that it is of it selfe without sauour, and so it is easie for Children, for that they may take it without feeling what it is, it is so lykewyse for persons that ca~not take Medicines, for it hath neyther smell nor taste.
haue purged therewith many Children, and many very olde persons, haue giuen it to men of more then
yeeres of age, and it maketh in them very sure and good woorke with no maner of alteration nor chaunge of body, and without being debilited or weakened.
This Roote doeth auoyde cholerike humors, grosse mixt, and also flegmatike Humors, of what kind soeuer they be, and humors putrified and rotten, and of both it doeth euacuate the Citrine water, of them that haue the Dropsie, with much easines.
The principall respect thereof is to the Liuer, making it cleane, and comforting it, and the Members neere adioyning to it, as the stomacke and the inner partes.
It doeth cure all Opilations of the same partes, and all diseases caused of them: As the Dropsie, the Iaundies, and ioyntly with his good woorke it rectifieth the euill complexion of the Liuer, it windinesse, and with it expelleth it, and doeth open all the hardnesse of the Liuer, and of the Lunges, and of the stomacke.
It taketh away olde griefes of head, and mundifieth the brayne and Sinewes, and out the humors that bee in the head, or thereof.
In the disease called the which is the Ringes Euill, it maketh a good woorke: in olde of the head called the Megrim, and the Falling sicknesse, and in all Distillations, or olde runninges, in paynes of Ioyntes, both particular and vniuersal, as in the Arthetica, in paynes of the stomacke, emptying the cause, and consuming windines.
Also in paynes of the Uryne Bladder, in paynes of the stone and Colicke, of what kynde soeuer it bee, it maketh a meruellous woorke.
It cureth the paynes of women, and especially the Mother, by emptying and taking away the cause, as namely those causes which come of cold humors windinesse, and in the griefes of the brest, as of an olde cough, shortnes of breath, for vsing this roote oftentymes it taketh it away, and healeth it.
Also in griefes of the Reynes caused of grosse Humors, for it doeth emptie and expell them.
In griefes of the Poxe it maketh a greate worke.
And it seemeth that for these griefes our Lord did ordaine it, emptying the humors of them, which for the moste parte are colde, and especially when they be waxen olde of long tyme, it purgeth them, and doeth expel them without any paynes, by multiplying the taking thereof as many tymes as is necessarie, for that in these infirmities that bee olde, and of long continuance, one euacuation is not sufficient, but it is necessary to haue many euacuations, which may be done without daunger with this Roote: and it is not to bee maruelled at, if that with one therewith doeth not follow the health that is wished for, but that many tymes it is needful to make often repetition, to the intent to roote vp and expel the euil, and naughtie humors, that are the cause of the saide disease.
This roote doeth maruellously empty foorth the cause of the Feuers, and importunate, and all Feuers compounded, and chiefly in olde Feuers, as Tertians, Quotidians, flegmatike, and in diseases as commonly come of opilacions, vsing thereof at the tyme that is needefull, for that in the lyke large and importunate diseases, the Phisition must not bee content with one but with many, digesting by little and little, and auoyding out by little and little, seeing that the auoyding out is done with such assuraunce by this Medicine so blessed.
He that hath neede of it must haue a good hart, and with trust that it will profite him much, which hetherunto wee haue experimented, in so many, that with iust title all credit may be giuen to the good workes therof.
We see with how much easines without any accide~ts, it worketh the effects that we haue spoken of.
it is looked for, that euery day will bee discouered greater matters, that may bee added vnto these.
The Rule and order that must be kept in the administration, and geuing of the Pouders, made of the roote of Mechoacan was learned of the Indian Phisition that wee haue spoken of, and since it hath beene vsed in diuers and sundrie fashions.
The first thing that is requyred of him that shal take this Pouder is, that he do prepare himself with good diet, good order, keeping himselfe from all thinges that may offende health, and to vse these meates which are most conuenie~t for him, to dispose the humor that principally hee pretendeth to auoyde out, with some Syrope, that may haue the same respect that the humor is disposed vnto the way to be prepared where he may go out.
And for this it is good that he take the counsel of a Phisitio~: he must vse Glisters, if the Belly be not obedient at the least the day before he shal take it, and if by chaunce he shal neede letting blood he shall doe it with the iudgement and opinion of a Phisition.
The body so prepared and ready to be purged, he shal take this roote chosen as we haue said, and it must be grounde, making Pouder of it, of an indifferent sinenesse, and way of it the quantitie that must bee taken, as wee shall speake of, and put it into whyte Wyne, which is Sacke, as much in quantitie as is needful for to drinke, and it must be in the morning.
Wyne is the best licour that it can bee taken withall, and so it is vsed generally in the Indias, for the Wyne as wee haue sayde, doeth corroborate and geue strength to these Pouders, and because there be some that can drink no wine, in such case they may geue it in sodden water, wherein Synamon hath beene boyled, or Anis or Fenell seede, and if the pure wine doe offend them, it may be delayed with any manner of Water, but the quantitie of the Wine that shall be taken, is so little, that it offende, nor molest anie person.
It may be delaied with Endife, or Langdebeefe water, and because this medicine is not geuen in sharpe Agues, but in large and temperate diseases, it doth heare the Wine better then any other licour.
Also they geue these Pouders with Conserua of Uiolets, and with Syrope of Uiolets, and it is a good practise: for with his colde and moysture, it doeth correct the litle heate, and drought that the Patient hath, and let them drinke vpon it Wine watered, or some water as aforesaide.
There is made of this Pouder Pilles formed with electuary of Roses, and surely they make a very good worke and purge well.
Also they doe put it in paste of Wafer bread, or in Marchpaines, and as it hath no euill sauour, so they doe not feele it.
It serueth much for children and for them that cannot take the like thinges.
The Pilles that must be made of this pouder must be very little· somewhat greater then Coriander seede, that they may dissolue the rather, and not heat, and so they work more quickly and better.
They may be geuen in the morning and at night, these pouders be receiued with most prosperous successe, beeing made vp with Syrope of Roses of nine infusions, mingling the quantity that thereof shal be taken in two ounces of Syrope, and surely this mixture doeth make a meruellous woorke, for that it doth strengthen, and inforce much the worke of the pouders.
It auoydeth Cholerike, grosse and fleugmatike humors and permixt, and the fearcenes of the blood, and so it is a greate Medicine, and of maruellous woorke: It auoydeth also most strongly the Citrine water of them that haue the Dropsie, frequenting it many tymes, giuing betweene one purge and another, that which may corroborate and make strong the Liuer: in Broth it is taken many tymes, and maketh good woorke.
This Medicine or purge must bee taken in the morning early, and after it is taken, they may sleepe halfe an houre vppon it, before it doe purge, for that the sleepe doeth slaye the Uomit, and the natural heate shal make a better worke in the Medicine.
Hee that shall take these Pouders, if he do feare them, or any other Medicine purgatiue, and if he feare Uomit, may vse this one remedy, of the which haue large experience, and is, when hee hath taken this purge or any other, let him take the Yolke of an Egge rosted hot, broken betweene his Fingers, and put into a course Linen Cloth, and so rounde let him put it into the Throate Pit, and let him holde it there, vntill that hee doe beginne to purge, for that surely, it will slaye the Uomiting and also the Fumes, that doe ryse of the purge, and this is no small content.
After that hee hath somwhat slept, if hee can, at the tyme that it beginneth to woorke, let him not sleepe nor eate, nor drinke any thing, but bee in place where the ayre doe not offende him, nor with much company, for that all the intent shall bee for to purge, staying all thinges that may let the auoyding out.
And he shall be aduertised, that one of the greatest excellencies that this purge hath, is, that it is in the handes of the sicke person to auoyde out what quantitie of humour hee will, the which is a thing that they of olde tyme did consider much of.
And waying which was surest of purging or the letting of blood, they doe not aleage any other cause more principall, than that the letting of blood is more sure.
Forasmuch as in the letting of blood wee may take out what quantity of blood we lust, not in the purge, which once being taken, it is not in the handes of the Phisitio~, nor the sicke person to let it to doe his woorke, which quality is not in this our purge of the roote of Mechoacan seeing that with taking of a little Broth, or eating any maner of thing, the working of it seaseth, and it worketh no more, and so it cannot exceede nor hurt the patient.
Surely it is to be holden of much price, that there is fou~de a kinde of purge with so much assurance, and that so mightily doeth his woorke, and is at the will of him that doth take it.
After it hath done what to the patient seemeth good, and sufficient, then with a little Broth which hee eateth, it shall worke and purge no more.
After that the sicke person or Phisition perceyueth that it hath made an ende of his working, and hath purged that which is conuenient, then they must giue him somewhat to eate, taking at the beginning of his Dinner a Disheful of Broth, and after a little whyle let him eate of a Hen, and in the rest let him gouerne himself as one that is purged, as wel in his drinke as in his meate, as also in the keeping that hee shall haue of his person.
For that day that he doeth take it, let him take heede that hee sleepe not in the day tyme nor drinke till Supper, the which Supper shall bee light and of some good meates.
The next daye let him take a washing Medicine, and some Conserua, and from that tyme forwarde let him keepe good order and good gouernement, in al that is conuenient for him.
And if that with once taking of these pouders, the sicke man doe not heale, nor auoyde from him that which is needful for to bee voyded, hee may take it again, as many tymes as the Phisition shall see conuenient, wherein he shall haue care after that the sicke man is purged, to comfort and to alter the principal members.
And in this can holde no precise opinion, for that there be diuers and variable diseases, and it is needful for them to haue diuers remedies, my intent is no more then to wryte the vse of the Roote of Mechoacan as a thing of so greate importaunce, and of a purge and remedy so excellent, as nature hath giuen vnto vs.
And if processe of tyme haue taken fro~ vs the true Myrre, and the true Balsamo, and other Medicines that they of old tyme had, of the which in our tyme there is no memorie, and with the tyme are lost: yet tyme it selfe in place of them hath discouered and giuen so many and so sundry thinges as wee haue spoken of, as our Occidental Indias do sende vs.
In especially the Mechoacan a purge most excellent and gentle, which doth his work with such assurance, being white in colour, pleasant in sauour, and in smel easie to take, without any lothsomnes in working, and without that horriblenes, that other purges haue, and without those accidents fayntnes that come at the tyme, that they be taken, without that disquietnesse which it maketh when it woorketh.
This Roote hath ouer and aboue that, which is sayde, other properties, and hidden workes, that wee doe not reach vnto, which with the tyme and vse of them shalbee knowen and discouered euery day.
The waight or quantitie that is giuen of the Pouder, made of the Roote of Mechoacan is conformable to the obedience of the belly, of him that shall take it.
knowe a Gentleman of this Realme, that with the waight of halfe a Ryall, which is iii. d. doth purge very wel, and there are other that haue neede of the waight of xii. d. and others of the waight of xviii. d.
And in this euery one ought to measure the qua~titie, as he hath his belly in obedience, more or lesse.
Euen so they ought to limit the quantity conformably to the age of the Patient.
For that the Childe hath neede of little, the Boye of more, and the strong man of much more, and the Leane of lesse, and for this cause the Phisition must measure the quantitie as hee seeth it conuenient.
Because to the Childe he shal giue the waight of iii. d. and to the Boy the waight of vi. d. and to the Man the waight of xii. d. which is commonly so taken, but to the Woman it is not conuenient to giue lesse then the waight of twelue pence, in this there may be had a consideration, seeing that it is in the hande of the Phisition to take away his worke when hee doth see that it excedeth, it is better to giue a litle too much, considering that with taking of a fewe suppings of broth, if it doe exceede, the excesse may be remedied.
This is the summe which haue vnderstoode vnto this day of the Roote, which they bring from the Prouince of Mechoacan and when shall know more of it, will wryte as the tyme and the vse therof shall giue occasion.
WHen made an end of wryting of these last lynes, Barnadine of Burgus the Poticarie, a man learned and expert in his arte, did shewe mee in his shop a peece of quicke Sulphur brought from our Indias, a thing most excellent as euer sawe, and in our tyme the lyke hath not beene seene.
It was bright lyke Glasse, of the colour of fine gold, taking a little of it, and casting it into the Fyre, it doeth cast from it a very greate smell of Brimstone lyke to greene smoke, and the peece it selfe (smelling therunto) hath no smell.
They brought it from Quito wt is a place in the prouince of Peru from a Mine that there was founde in certayne nere vnto the Mines of gold.
And it is not in vayne that the Alcumistes doe say, that the matter of Gold, is the Quickesiluer, and the Sulphur, that is to say, the Quickesiluer the matter, and the Sulphur the former and maker.
And so this which saw, was like to a peece of golde most fine.
They bring from Nicaraga other Sulphur, but it is russet, like to Ashes, congeled without colour or which is found nigh vnto the Uolcan of Nicaraga the which being cast into the fire doth cast from it the smell of Brimstone, but it is a peece of earth, and in nothing is like to that, of the Prouince of Quito more then in the smell, neyther hath it that colour of Golde, nor that brightnesse that the other hath, which is of Quito
The same beyng applyed in things, that are conuenient for medicine, worketh meruellous effectes: chiefly beeyng grounde, and dissolued with wine, and applied in the night to them, that haue their face redde inflamed that bee like to Lepers, vsing it certayne nightes, after they haue beene at the stoole, it taketh the rednesse away, and healeth it maruellously, of the which haue greate experience.
Taking the weight of sixe pence in an Egge, it healeth the Colike. and the Palsey.
It is good for the payne of the Stone, and beyng taken, it healeth the Iaunders.
It is hotte and drie excessiuely, which appeareth by the friendship, that it hath with the fire, for being touched with it, it inflameth, and maketh a flame.
It is the principal matter, of that Diuelishe inuention of Gunpouder, which hath beene the cause of so many euils, and hurtes.
ALso the sayde Barnardino de Burgus shewed mee a Wood, which to my seeming, thought too haue beene the holy wood, that meane of Saint Iohn Puerto Rico the which was of this manner, and forme.
Beeyng in the house of a principal Merchant of this city, making a Medicine in a Chimney, where they did burne of that wood, the smoke that came out of the wood did smell much, and gaue a very sweet sauour, of the which he maruelled much, and asked from whence they had cast thither that good smell.
They of the house tolde him, that the good smel was of the wood that they did there burne, and it was that which did cast that good smell.
He tooke a sticke of the Wood, and from it plucked a slip of the same, which had no smell nor sauour, more than other common wood had, then he tooke away a little of the rinde, and smelled vnto it, and tasted it, and he founde a sweete smell most excellent in it, and a Sauour no more nor lesse then of Maces, or Nutmegges, and much more sharpe, and more sweete, and of a more pleasant smell and tast, then any Cinamom that is in the world, and with more liuelinesse, and sharpnesse of tast then the Peper.
tasted it at the taking away of the rinde from the said wood, of the which he had a great peece of timber, and surely there is not any thing of so sweet smell and tast, of any thing which we haue that with so much pleasantnesse of smell, and with such liuelinesse seadeth forth a flauour as this did penitrate me, insomuche that tasting a little of it, carried all that day the sweete smell and sauour in my mouth, beeyng meruellous, as though had carried there a peece of Nutmegge.
Of this wood they saide, that a Maister of a Shippe of his, did cut a great quantitie, comming by the Hauana and in a mountayne, they cut much of it, for the shippes prouision, and that which did remayne they carried to the Owners howse, there wast it, as haue said.
Wherby do co~sider howe many trees and plantes there be in our Indias, that haue great vertues for medicines, that in the fuell of the Chimney they spend wood, of sweet odoriferous sauour, the rynde of the which being made into pouder, there might bee done very great effects with it, for comforting the heart and the stomake, and principall members, without seeking after the spicerie of Maluca and the medicines of Arabia and them of Persia
Seeing that in the fieldes vntilled, and in the Mountaines and Desertes, our Indias do yeeld them vnto vs, the fault is ours that we doe not follow after them, nor seeke to doe the diligence that is conuenient, for to profite our selues in these meruellous effectes, the which trust that Time beeing the discouerer of all thinges, and good diligence and experience withall will discouer vnto vs to our greate profite.
The Seconde Part of this Booke is of the things that are brought from our Occidentall INDIAS, which serue for the vse of Medicine, wherein is treated of the Tabaco and of the Sassafras and of the Carlo Sancto and of many other hearbes and plantes, seedes and licoures, that newly are brought from those partes, of great vertues and meruellous effectes.
THese daies past wrote a booke of all thinges which come fro~ your Occidentall Indias, seruing for the vse of medicine, and surely it hath been taken in that estimation, that the things which in it are intreated of doe deserue.
And seeing the profite that it hath done, and howe many haue been remedied and healed with those remedies, did determine to proceede forwardes, to write of the thinges, which after that the first part was written, haue come from those countries, of the which haue vnderstood, that no lesse vtilitie and profite shal come, then of those which are past, for there shalbe discouered newe thinges secrets, which will bring admiration, neuer to this day seene nor knowne before.
And seeing that these medicinall things which we do treate of, the Realmes and Countries from whence they come, belong vnto your maiestie, and he also that writeth of them, is your Maiesties subiect: doe desire your Maiestie, to receiue this trauell into your protection, and that the reward may be such, as for the like workes dedicated to your Maiestie is accustomed to be geuen.
Your Maiesties Subiect Doctor Monardes· Of the Tabaco, and of his great vertues.
THIS Hearbe which commonly is called Tabaco is an Hearbe of muche antiquitie, and knowen amongst the Indians, and in especially among them of the new Spayne, and after that those Countries were gotten by our Spaniardes, beyng taught of the Indians, they did profite themselues with those things, in the wounds which they receiued in their Warres, healing themselues therewith to their great benefite.
Within these few yeeres there hath beene brought into Spayne of it, more to adornate Gardens with the fairenesse thereof, and too geue a pleasaunt sight, than that it was thought to haue the meruellous medicinable vertues, which it hath, but nowe wee doe vse it more for his vertues, than for his fairenesse.
It is growing in many partes of the Indias, but ordinarily in moyst and shadowie places, and it is needefull that the grounde it is sowen, bee well tilled, and that it be a fruitefull grounde, and at all times it is sowen, in the hot Countries.
But in the colde Countries it must bee sowen in the Moneth of Marche, for that it may defende it selfe from the frost.
[Figure: The proper name of it amongest the Indians is Picielt for the name of Tabaco is geuen to it by our Spaniardes, by reason of an Island that is named Tabaco
It is an hearbe that doth growe and come too bee verie greate: many times to bee greater then a Lemmon tree.
It casteth foorth one steame from the roote which groweth vpright, without declining to any parte, it sendeth foorth many Bowes, straight, that wel neere they bee equall with pages missing] and at the tyme as the hearbe is in the Morter a stamping, let there be put to it a fewe droppes of Uineger, that his worke may be made the better, and after the place is rubbed where the paine is, then lay vpon it one leafe or twoo leaues of the Tabaco being hotte, and so let it alone til the next day, and then doe the like againe, or in place of the leaues vse a Linen cloth wette in the hotte Ioyce.
Some there bee, that after they haue rubbed it with the sta~ped leaues, do annoynt it with oyntments, made for the like euils, and vpon it they lay the leaues or the ioyce of the Tabaco
And surely with this cure they haue dissolued great and harde opilations, and very old swellings.
In the griefe of the stone, of the Kidneis and Reines, this hearbe worketh great effectes, by putting the leaues into Ashes, or Embres, hotte, that they may warme wel, and then being layde vpon the griefe, multiplying the vse of it as often as it is needefull.
It is necessary in the seethinges that are vsed to bee made for Glisters to put into them with the other things, the Leaues of this hearbe, for that they shal profit much: and likewise for Fomentations and Plaisters, that they shall make.
In griefes of windes they worke the like effect, taking away the paines that come of the windinesse, applying the leaues after the same sorte as is aboue saide.
In the griefe of women, which is called the euill of the Mother, laying too one leafe of this hearbe Tabaco very hotte, in the manner as it is sayde, it doth manifestly profite and it must bee layde vppon the Nauell.
And vnder it some doe vse to put first of al, thinges of good smell vpon the Nauel, and then vpon that they lay the leafe.
In that which they finde most profit, is to lay the Tacamahaca or the oyle of liquid Amber, and Balsamo, and Caranna or any of these vnto the Nauel, and to kepe it too it continually, that it may cleaue vnto it, and this worketh manifest profit in griefes of the Mother.
In one thing, the women that dwel in the Indias doe celebrate this hearbe, that is, in the euill breathing at ye mouth of children, when they are ouer filled with meate, and also of olde people, anoynting their bellies with lampe oyle, and laying some of those leaues, in ashes hotte to their bellies, also to theyr shoulders, for it doeth take away ther naughty breathing, and maketh them goe to the stoole, applying it vnto the fundement at what tyme it is needfull, and if the leaues bee ashed it is the better.
Wormes, of all kindes of them, it killeth, and expelleth them maruellously, the seething of the hearbe made into a Syrope delicately, beeing taken in very little quantitie, the ioyce thereof put on the nauel.
It is needful after this be done to giue a Glister, that may auoyde them, and expell them out of the guttes.
In griefes of the Iointes comming of a colde cause it maketh a maruellous worke, the Leaues of this Tabaco being laid hotte vpon the griefe: the lyke doth the Ioyce layde vpon a little cloth hotte, for that it doeth dissolue the humor, taketh away the paines therof.
If it come of a hot cause it doth hurt, sauing when the humor hath bene hot, and the subtil part is dissolued, and the grosse remayneth, then it doeth profite as if the cause were colde, and it is to be vnderstood, that the leaues being layde, where as is griefe of the sayde cause, in any part of the body, it profiteth much.
In swellings or in cold Impostumes, it doth dissolue and vndoe them, washing them with the hotte Iuyce, and laying the beaten leaues, after they be stampt, or the leaues beeing whole of the sayde Tabaco vpon it.
In the Toothache when the griefe commeth of a colde cause, or of colde Rumes, putting to it a little ball made of the leafe of the Tabaco washing first the tooth with a small cloth wet in the Iuyce, it taketh away the payne, and stayeth it, that the putrifaction goe not forwarde: in hot causes it doth not profite, and this remedy is so common that it healeth euery one.
This hearbe doth maruellously heale Chilblaines, rubbing them with the stamped leaues, and after putting the handes and Feete in hot water, with Salt, and keping them warme: this is done with great experience in many.
In Uenom and venomous wounds our Tabaco hath great commendation, which hath beene knowne but a shorte tyme since, for when the wilde people of the Indias, which eate mans fleshe doe shoote their Arrowes, they annointe them with an hearbe or Composition made of many poysons, with the which they shoote at all thinges that they would kill, and this Uenom is so strong, and pernicious, that it killeth without remedie, and they that bee hurte dye with great paynes and accidents, and with madnes, vnlesse that their be found remedie for so great an euill.
fewe yeeres past they laid to their wounds Sublimatum and so were remedied, and surely in those partes they haue suffered much with this vexation of poyson.
little whiles past, certaine wild people going in their Bootes to S. Iohn De puerto Rico to shoote at India~s, or Spaniards, if that they might find the~, came to a place and killed certain Indians, Spaniards, did hurt many, as by chaunce there was no Sublimatum at that place to heale them, they remembred to lay vpon the wounds the Ioyce of the Tabaco the leaues stamped.
And God would, that laying it vpon the hurtes, the griefs, madnes, accidents wherwith they dyed, were mittigated, and in such sort they were deliuered of that euill, that the strength of the Uenom was taken away, and the wounds were healed, of the which there was greate admiration.
Which thing being knowen to the~ of the Ilande, they vse it also in other hurtes and woundes, which they take when they fight with the wilde people, nowe they stande in no feare of them, by reason they haue founde so great a remedy, in a case so desperate.
This Hearbe hath also vertue against the hearbe called of the Crosseboweshooter, which our hunters doe vse to kil the wilde beastes withall, which heathe is Uenom most strong, and doeth kill without remedie, which the Kinges pleasure was to prooue, and commaunded to make experience thereof, and they wounded a little dogge in the throate, and put foorthwith into the wound the hearbe of the Crosseboweshooter, and after a little while, they powred into the selfe same wounde that they had annoynted with the Crossebowe shooters hearbe, a good quantitie of the Iuyce of Tabaco and layde the stamped leaues vpon it, and they tied vp the dogge, and hee escaped, not without great admiration of al men that sawe him.
Of the which, the excellent Phisition of the Chamber of his maiestie, Doctor Barnarde in the margent of this booke, that sawe it, by the commaundement of his Maiestie, wryteth these wordes: made this experience by the commaundement of the kinges Maiesty.
wounded the dogge with a knife, after put the Crossebowe shooters hearbe into the wounde, and the hearbe was chosen, and the dogge was taken of the hearbe, and the Tabaco and his Iuyce being put into the wounde, the dogge escaped and remained whole.
In the venomous Carbuncles, the Tabaco being applied in maner as is aforesaid doth extinguish the malice of the venom, doth that which al the woorkes of Surgery can doe, vntil it be whole.
The same effect it worketh in bytinges of venomous beastes, for it killeth and extinguisheth the malice of the venom and healeth them.
In woundes newely hurt, and cuttes, strokes, prickes, or any other manner of wounde, our Tabaco worketh maruellous effectes, for that it doeth heale them and maketh them
The wound must be washed with wine, procure to annoynt the sides of it, taking away that which is superfluous, then powre into it the Iuyce of this hearbe, lay vpon it the stamped leaues, and being well bound it shal co~tinue on vntil the next day that thou shalt returne to dresse it.
After the same fashion the patientes shall keepe good order in their meate, vsing the diet necessary, and if it be needful of any euacuation by stoole, the cause being greate, let it be done what shal be conuenient.
And with this order they shalbe healed, without any neede of any more Surgerie the~ this hearbe only.
Here in this Country, in this City they know not what other to doe, hauing cut or hurt themselues, but to runne to the Tabaco as to a most readie remedie.
It doth maruellous workes, without any need of other Surgery, but this only hearbe.
In restrayning the fluxe of blood of the wounds it procureth most maruellous workes, for that ye Iuyce and the Leaues being stamped, are sufficient to restraine any fluxe of blood.
In olde Sores it is maruellous the woorkes and the effects that this hearbe doeth, for it healeth them wonderfully, making cleane and mundifying them of all humors that are superfluous, and of the rottennes, that they haue, bringeth vp the flesh, reducing them to perfite health, the which is so common in this Citie, that euery man doeth knowe it· and hauing ministred it to many people as well men as women, in great number, and being grieued of tenne, and of twentie yeeres, haue healed olde rotten sores in legges, and other partes of the body, with this remedy only to the great admiration of all men.
The order of the Cure that is to bee wrought with this hearbe, is this following.
For the olde rotten sores although they bee cankered, let the sicke man bee purged with the counsell of a Phisition, and let him blood if it be needfull, and then take this hearbe and pounde it in a Morter, and wring out the Iuyce, and put it into the Sore, and then after the maner of a Plaister laie the stamped leaues vpon it, which are the Leaues that the Iuyce is taken out of, and this doe once euery day eating good Meates, and not exceeding in any disorder, for otherwyse it will not profite.
And doing this, it wil make cleane the euil flesh that is rotten, and superfluous, vntil it come to the whole flesh, and it is not to be maruelled at, if the wounde bee made very greate.
For the euil must bee eaten vp, vntil it come to the good, and in the same cure putting in lesse quantitie of iuyce it wil incarnate, and reduce it to parfit health, in such sort that it accomplisheth al the workes of Surgery, that all the Medicines of the worlde are able to doe, without hauing neede of any other maner of medicine.
This woorke doeth cure olde Sores, with very great admiration: and not onely in men, but in brute beastes also.
As at this day in all partes of the Indias, where there are any cattel hauing woundes or gaules, and the countrie beeing hotte and moyst ouer much, doeth soone rotte them, and very quickly they come to bee cankered, and for this cause, much great cattel doe dye: To remedy this and the wormes that doe increase in the sores, they had for remedy to put into the sores, Sublimatum for that in this remedy they did de more benefite than in any other, that they had vsed.
And for that the Sublimatum beares there so high a price, my tymes it was more woorth then the cattel that it heal.
For this cause and for hauing founde in the Tabaco so much vertue too heale newe woundes and rotten, they did accorde and agree together to vse the Tabaco in the healing of beastes, as they had done in the cure and remedy of men, powring the Iuyce of the Tabaco into the woundes, washing them therwith, laying vpon them the stamped leaues of the Tabaco after that the Iuyce is taken from them.
And it is of so greate efficacie and vertue, that it killeth the wormes, and maketh cleane the sore, eating away the euill fleshe, and ingendering newe vntill it be whole, as in the other thinges which wee haue spoken of.
The like it doth in the gaules of the beasts of Cariege the iuyce being powred in, the beate~ leaues wherout the iuyce commeth of the Tabaco as it is sayde: although they be cankered, it doeth make them cleane, and incarnate them, and cureth and helpeth them.
And so the Indians doe carry it, when they iourney, for this purpose and effect, and it procureth the like profite, that the iuyce doeth.
sawe a man that had certayne olde sores in his nose, wherby he did cast out from him much matter, which dayly did rotte and canker inwarde, and caused him to take at his nose the iuyce of this Tabaco and so he did: and at the seconde tyme, hee cast out from him, more then twenty little wormes, and afterwarde a fewe more, vntill that he remayned cleane of them, and vsing it so certayne dayes, hee was healed of the sores, that hee had in the inner part of his nose: and if he had taried any longer, thinke that there had remayned nothing of his nose, but al had bene eaten away, as it happeneth to many, which we see without them, And beeing wryting of this, a daughter of a Gentleman of this Citie, had many yeres a certaine kinde of drieskabbes, or wel neere skuruie in her head.
had her in cure and did vnto her many benefits, vniuersal, and particular: and also Maisters of Surgerie had done their diligence, and al did not profite.
And a Gentlewoman, which had the charge of her, as heard me speake one day much good of the Tabaco that did good, and profitable, for so many infirmities, sent for it, and did rubbe hard the disease that the wench had, that day shee was very euill, and as though she had bene and the gentlewoman did not let, in seing her after that to rubbe her harder, and then the wench did not feele so much griefe, but the dry skabbes to fall, and the whyte scurffe of her head in such sorte, that it made cleane and healed her head, with dooing so certaine dayes, so that shee was healed of her scuruie disease very well, without knowing what she did.
One of the of this hearbe, and that which bringeth most admiration, is, the maner howe the of the Indias did vse it, which was in this manner: when there was emongest the any manner of of greate importaunce, in the which the chiefe called Casiques or any of the principall people of the countrie, had necessitie to consult with their Priestes, in any businesse of importance: then they went and propounded their matter to their chiefe Priest, foorthwith in their presence, he tooke certayne leaues of the Tabaco and cast them into the fire, and did receiue the smoke of them at his mouth, and at his nose with a Cane, and in taking of it, hee fell downe vppon the ground, as a Dead man, and remayning so, according to the quantitie of the smoke that he had taken, when the hearbe had done his woorke, he did reuiue and awake, and gaue them their answeares, according to the visions, and illusions which hee sawe, whiles hee was rapte in same manner, and he did interprete to them, as to him seemed best, or as the Diuell had counselled him, geuing them continually doubtfull answeares, in such sorte, that howsoeuer it fell out, they might say that it was the same, which was declared, and the answeare that he made.
In like sort the rest of the Indians for their pastime, doe take the smoke of the Tabaco too make themselues drunke withall, and to see the visions, and thinges that +to them that wherein they doe delight: and other times they take it to knowe their businesse, and successe, because conformable to that, which they haue seene beyng drunke therewith, euen so they iudge of their businesse.
And as the Deuil is a deceauer, hath the knowledge of the vertue of hearbes, so he did shew the vertue of this Hearb, that by the meanes thereof, they might see their imaginations, and visions, that he hath represented to them, and by that meanes deceiue them.
Too haue Hearbes that haue the like vertue, is a common pages missing] Iias but is also a common thing in the Orientall Indias.
And also in the Indias, for this effect, they doe sell the in their Shoppes, euen as they sell Conser, with the which the Indians vse to ease themselues, of their labour that they take, and to bee merie, and not to feele paynes of any greate labour of the bodie, or minde that may come vnto them, and they call it there amongst themselues Aphi
The and Captaynes that goe to Warres, when they labour much, after the time that they be lodged, that they may take their rest, they receiue Aphion and sleepe with it, and remayne lightened of their labour: The most principall people take Bague and it hath a better cast, and a better smell, for there is put to it muche Amber, and Muske Cloues, and other spices.
And surely it is a thing of admiration, see howe these Barbarous people doe take such Medicines, and how many of them doe take them, and that they doe not ki them, but rather they take them for health and for their necessities.
sawe an Indian of those partes, that in my presence did aske an Apothecarie for a quart of and demanded of him wherefore he woulde haue it, and he tolde me that he took it to put away wearinesse, when he felt himselfe ouer much greeued, and afflicted with labour, and hee tooke the halfe of that which he carried, for the Apothecary gaue him more then a for twelue pence, and therewith he slepte so soundly, that when he awoke from sleepe, hee founde himselfe very muche eased of his wearinesse, in suche sorte, that hee might continue his labour.
meruelled at it, and it seemed to me a thing of Mockerie, seeyng that fiue or sixe graynes, bee the most that wee can giue sicke Person, howe strong soeuer hee bee, which beeyng verie well prepared, doeth cause many times Accidentes of Death.
And many yeeres after standing in the Shoppe of an other Apothecary of this Citie, there came an other Indian, of the same Orientall Indias, and he asked of the Apothecarie, for some Opio called Aphion the which Apothecarie vnderstoode him not.
And remembring my selfe of the other Indian, caused him to shewe vnto the Indian Opio and in shewing it to him, he sayd that it was that which he asked for, and he bought a quarter of a Pinte of it, and asked of the Indian, wherefore hee woulde haue it, and he tolde me the same that the other Indian did, that it was because he might labour, and ease himselfe of his wearinesse for that hee did beare burdens, and shoulde helpe to discharge a shippe: wherefore he sayde he woulde take the one halfe that he might therewith labour, and the other halfe after he had laboured, that therwith he might take ease, and rest.
Then gaue credite to the first Indian, of that he sayd vnto me, and since haue beleeued that which haue seene and read, in those partes to be a thing in common vse, for the like effectes.
And truely it is a thing worthy of greate consideration, that fiue graines of Opio doe kill vs, and threescore doe geue them health and rest.
The Indians doe vse the Tabaco for to suffer drieth, and also to suffer hunger, and to passe dayes without hauing neede to eate or drinke, when they shall trauell by any desert, or dispeopled countrie, where they shall finde neither water, nor meate.
They receiue thereof little balles, which they make of the Tabaco
For they take the leaues of it, and chew them and as they goe chewing of them, they goe mingling with them certayne pouder, made of the shelles of Cockels burned, they mingle it in the mouth altogether, vntil they make it like dowe, of the which they frame certayne little Balles, little greater then Peason, and lay them to drie in the shadow, and after they keepe them, and vse them in this forme following.
When they vse to trauell by the waies, where they finde no water nor meate, they take a little hall of these, and put it betweene the lower lippe and the teeth, and goe chewing it all the time that they trauell, and that which they chewe, they swallowe downe, and in this sore they iourney, three or foure dayes, without hauing neede of meate, or drinke, for they feele no hunger drieth, nor weakenesse, nor their trauell doth trouble them.
thinke that to iourney after this sort, is cause they goe chewing continually the little balles: for they bring Fleume into the mouth, and swallowe it into the stomake, the which doeth retayne the naturall heate, which it doth confirme, and so they mainteyn themselues therby, the like whereof wee see to happen in many beastes, for that a great part of the Winter, they be shut vp in their Caues, hollowe places of the earth, and passe their time there without any meate, for that they haue to the naturall heate, of the which they had gotten in the Summer.
The Beare being a great and fierce beast, much time in the Winter remayneth in his Caue, and liueth without meate or drinke, with onely chewing his pawes, which perhaps he doeth for the said cause.
This is the substance which haue gathered of this hearbe, so celebrated called Tabaco for that surely it is an hearb of great estimation, for the excellent vertues that it hath, as we haue sayde.
Hereafter followeth a further addition of the Hearbe called Tabaco, otherwise called by the Frenchmen Nicotiane.
Which hearbe hath done great cures in the Realme of Fraunce and Portugall, as heereafter at large may appeare in thistreatise following.
NICOTIANE although it bee not long since it hath beene knowne in France, notwithsta~ding deserueth palme and price, and among al other medicinable hearbs, it deserueth to stand in the first rank, by reason of his singular vertues, and as it were almost to bee had in admiration, as hereafter you shall vnderstand.
And for that none suche as of auncient time, or of late dayes, haue written the nature of plantes, did neuer make mention thereof, haue therefore learned the whole historie touching the same, which learned of a gentleman my very friend, the first authour, inuenter, and bringer of this hearb into France: wherfore thought good to publish it in writing for their sakes, that haue so often hearde speaking of this saide hearbe, and yet neyther knew the hearbe nor the effectes thereof.
This Hearbe is called Nicotiane of the name of him that gaue the firste intelligence thereof vnto this Realme, as many other plantes haue taken their names of certayne Greekes and Romaynes, who hauing beene in straunge Countries, for seruice of their common Weales, haue brought into their countries many plants, which were before vnknowne.
Some haue called this Hearbe the Queenes Hearbe, because it was firste sent vnto her, as heereafter shalbe declared by the Gentleman, that was the first inuenter of it, and since was by her geuen to diuers for to sowe, whereby it might bee planted in this lande.
Others haue named it the great Priors hearbe, for that he caused it to multiply in Fraunce, more then any other, for the greate reuerence that he bare to his hearbe, for the Diuine effectes therin contayned.
Many haue geuen it the Petum which is indeede the proper name of the Hearbe, as they which haue that Countrie can tell.
Notwithstanding, it is better to name it by the name of him that sent it into Fraunce first, to the ende that hee may haue the honour thereof, according to his desert, for that hee hath enriched our Countrie, with so singular an Hearbe.
Thus much for the name, and nowe hearken further for the whole Historie.
Maister Iohn Nicot to the King, being Embassadour for his Maiestie in Portugall, in the yeere of our Lorde.
went one day to see the Prysons of the King of Portugall: and a Gentleman beeyng the keeper of the Prisons presented him with this hearb, as a strange Plant brought from Florida
The same Maister Nicot hauing caused the said hearb to be set in his Garden, where it grewe and multiplied maruellously, was vppon a time aduertised, by one of his that a young man, of kinne to that Page made a of that hearbe brused both the hearbe and the Iuice together vppon an vlcer, which he had vpon his cheeke neere vnto his nose, comming of a Noli me tangere which began to take roote already at the griffles of the Nose, wherewith hee founde himselfe meruellously eased.
Therefore the sayde Maister Nicot caused the sicke young man to bee brought before him, and causing the saide hearb to be continued to the sore eight or ten daies, this saide Noli me tangere was vtterly extinguished and healed: and he had sent it, while this cure was a woorking to a certeine Phisition of the king of Portugall one of the greatest fame to examine the further working and effect of the said Nicotiane and sending for the same young man at the end of ten dayes, the sayde Phisition seeing the visage of the said sicke yong man, certified, that the sayde Noli me tangere was vtterly extinguished, as in deede he neuer felt it since.
Within a while after, one of the of the sayde Embassadour hauing almost cutte off his thombe, with a greate chopping knyfe, the of the house of the sayde Gentleman ran to the sayde Nicotiane and dressed him therewith fiue or sixe tymes, and so in the ende thereof hee was healed: from that tyme forward this hearbe began to bee famous throughout Lishebron where the court of the kyng of Portugall was at that presone, and the vertue of this sayde hearbe was extolled, and the people began to name it the Ambassadours hearbe.
Wherefore there came certaine dayes after a Gentleman of the Countrie, Father one of the of the Ambassadour, who was troubled with an vlcer in his Legge, hauing had the same twoo yeeres, and demaunded of the sayde Ambassadour for his hearbe, and vsing the same in such order as is before written, at the end of tenne or twelue daies hee was healed.
From that tyme forth the fame of that same hearbe increased in such sort, that many came from al places to haue some of it.
Among al others there was a woman that had her face couered with a Ringworme rooted, as though she had a Uisour on her face, to whome the saide L. Embassadour caused the hearbe to be giuen, and told how she should vse it, and at the ende of eight or tenne daies, this woman was throughly healed, who came and presented her selfe to the Ambassadour, shewing him of her healing.
After there came a Captaine to present his Sonne sick of the kinges euill to the sayde L. Ambassadour, for to send him into France, vnto whome there was a saye made of the sayde hearbe, which in fewe dayes did begin to shewe great signes of healing, and finally he was altogether healed therby of the kings euill.
The L. Ambassadour seeing so great effects proceeding of this hearbe, and hauing heard say that the Lady Montigue that was, dyed at Saint Germans of an vlcer bread in her brest, that did rne to a Noli me tangere for the which there could neuer remedy hee lykewyse that the Countesse of Ruffe had sought for al the famous Phisitions of that Realme, for to heale her face, vnto whom they could giue no remedy, he thought it good to communicate the same into France, and did sende it to king Frauncis the seconde, and to the and to many other Lords of the Cou the of ministring same, and howe to apply it vnto the said diseases, as he had found it by experience, and chiefly to the Lorde of Iarnac gouernour of Rogel, with whom saide Lord Ambassadour had greate amitie for the seruice of the king.
The which Lord of Iarnac told one day at the table, yt he had caused the to be distilled, and the water to bee with water, of Euphrasio otherwise called eyebright, to one that was short who was therewith healed.
This hearbe hath the stalke greate, bearded and slymie, the leafe large and long bearded slymie, it groweth in branches halfe foote to halfe foote, and is very ful of leaues, and groweth in height foure or fiue foote.
In hot countries it is nyne or tenne monethes in the yeere laden, in one selfe tyme, with leaues flowers, Coddes full of rype graynes, which is when they are waxed blacke, and to be ripe, which is when they are yet greene.
It sproutes foorth neere the roote much, and reuyueth by a greate quantitie of buddes, notwithstanding the grain is the least seede in the worlde, the rootes be like small threeds.
Nicotiane doth require a fat grounde finely digged, and in colde Countreys very well dounged, that is to say, a grounde, in the which the doung must be so wil mingled and incorporated, that it be altogether turned into earth, that there appeare no more doung.
It requireth the south Sunne, and to be planted by a wal, which may defende it against the North winde recouering the heate of the Sunne against it, being a warrant vnto the said hearbe against the tossing vp of the winde, because of the weaknes and highnes thereof.
It groweth the better being often watered, and reuiueth it selfe by reason of the water in tyme of droughts.
It hateth the cold, therefore to preserue it from dying in the Winter tyme, it must either be kept in Caues made of purpose within the said gardens, or els couered with a double Matte, and a Penthouse of Reede made on the Wall ouer the hearbe, and when the South Sunne shyneth, the dore of the place must bee opened where the hearbe is on the Southside.
For to sowe it, there must bee made a hole in the ground with your finger, as deepe as your finger can teache, then cast into that hole
graines of the sayde Seede together stopping againe your hole, for it is so small a Seede, that if there bee put in the hole but three or foure graynes thereof, the earth would choke them, and if the weather bee dry, the place must be watered lightly during the tyme of fiftiene dayes after the sowing thereof: it may also be sowen like vnto Lettis and other such hearbes.
And when the hearbe is out of the grounde, for so much as euery Grayne thereof will bring foorth his twigge, and that the little threeds of the Roote are the one within the other, you must make with a great knife a greate compasse within the earth rounde about the saide place, and lift vp the earth together with the Seede, and cast it into a payle of water, so that the earth bee separated, that the little twigges may swimme aboue the water, then shal you take them without breaking, the one after the other, pages missing] [Figure: The Sassafras.
Of the tree which is brought from the Florida, called Sassafras.
FRom the Florida which is the firme Land of our Occidental Indias, lying in xxv. degrees, they bring a wood and roote of a tree that groweth in those partes, of great vertues, and greate excellencies, healing therewith grieuous and variable diseases.
It may be three yeres past, that had knowledge of this Tree, a French man which had bene in those partes, shewed me a peece of it, and tolde me meruels of the vertues therof, how many and variable diseases were healed with the water, which was made of it.
gaue at that tyme no credit to him, for that in these things of Plantes, and hearbes, which are brought from other places, they say much, and knowe little, vnlesse it bee by a man that hath experience of them, with care and diligence.
The tree and the partes thereof lyked mee well, and iudged that, which nowe do finde to be true, and haue seene by experience.
He tolde me that the Frenchmen, which had beene in the Florida at that tyme, whe~ they came into those parts, had beene sicke the most of them, of grieuous and variable diseases, and that the Indians did shewe them this tree, and the manner how they should vse it, and so they did, and were healed of many euilles, which bringeth admiration, that one only remedy should worke so variable, and so meruellous effectes.
After that the Frenchmen were destroyed, our Spaniardes beganne to waxe sicke, as the Frenchemen had doone, and some which remayned of them, did shewe it to our Spaniardes, and howe they had cured themselues with the water of this meruellous Tree, and the manner which they obserued in the vsing of it, shewed to them by the Indians, who vsed to cure themselues therewith, when they were sicke of any griefe.
Our Spaniards began to cure themselues with the water of this Tree, and it wrought in them great effectes, that are almost incredible: for with the naughtie meates drinking of the rawe waters, sleeping in the dewes, the most parte of them fell into continuall Agues, of the which many of them came into opilations, and from the opilations they began to swell, and when the euil came first, immediatly it began to take away the lust that they had to their meate, and then happened to them other accidents, and diseases, as such like Feuers are accustomed to bring: and hauing there no remedie to bee healed, they did what the Frenchemen had counsailed them, doing that which they had done, which was in this forme.
They digged vp the roote of this tree, and tooke a peece thereof, such as it seemed to them best, they cutte it small into very thinne and little peeces, and cast them into water, at discretion, as much as they sawe was needfull, little more or lesse, and they sodde it the tyme that seemed sufficient for to remaine of a good collour, and so they dranke it in the morning fasting, and in the day tyme, and at dinner, and supper, without keeping any more waight, or measure, then haue sayde, nor more keeping, nor order then this, and by this they were healed of so many griefes, and euil diseases, that to heare of them what they suffred, and how they were healed, it bringeth admiration, they which were whole, dranke it in place of wine, for it doeth preserue them in health: as it appeared very well by them that haue come from thence this yeere, for they came all whole and strong, and with good colours· which doeth not happen to them that come from those partes, and from other conquestes, for they sicke and without collour, and in short space the most of them
And these Souldiers doe trust so much in this Wood, that beeyng one day amongest many of them, informing any selfe of thinges of this Tree, the most parte of them tooke out of their Pockets, a good peece of this Wood, and sayde: Maister, doe you see here the Wood, that euery one of vs doeth bring to heale vs withall, if we fall sicke, as we beene there? and they began to prayse it so much, and to confirme the maruellous workes of it, with so many examples of them that were there, that surely gaue great credite vnto it, and they caused me to beleeue all that thereof hearde, and gaue mee courage to experiment it, as haue done, and as wee shall see in the maruelles, which wee shall write of it.
And nowe we come to shewe the description, and forme of this Tree.
The Tree from whence they cut this Wood, which they newly brought from the Florida, called Sassafras is a Tree that groweth to bee very greate: there be of a middle sort, and lesser sorte.
The greater sorte is of the bignesse of a Pine Tree, of a meane height, and well neere to the making of it, for it is straight, casteth out no more but one branche of Bowes, after the manner of a Palme Tree, onely in the highest part, or sendeth out bowes after the maner of a Pine Tree, made cleane, making of the Bowes which it casteth forth, a forme of roundnes.
It hath a grosse rinde of a Tawny colour, vpon that an other thin rinde, of the colour of ashes, and vpon the inner parte thereof, the Trees and bowes white, and neere like to Tawny.
The tree and bowes are light, the rinde beeing tasted, hath an excellent sweete smell, and it is somewhat like to the smell of Fenell, with much sweetenesse of taste, and of pleasaunt smell, insomuche that a little quantity of this Wood being in a chamber, filleth the ayre conteined in it, and the rinde hath some of the inner part hath little smell, the higher part that the bowes hath leaues, the which be green, after the of a Figge tree, with three poyntes, when they are little, they be like to the leaues of a Peare tree, in onely shewing theyr poyntes.
They be of collour a Greene, and of a sweete smell, and muche more when they be drie.
The Indians vse to lay them beaten or vpon or when any man is beaten with drie blowes, and being dried they are vsed in Medicinable thinges.
They their leanes, they are alwayes greene, if any doe dry and fall, there springeth other, it is not knowen that it hath any flowre or fruite.
The rootes of this Tree be grosse, or slender, conformably to the greatenesse of the Tree, they bee light, but not so much as the body of the Tree, and the bowes, but for the greatnesse it is notable light.
The roote of this Tree is very superficiall, spreading in the vpper face of the soyle or grounde, so they dygge them vp easily: and this is a common thing in the of the Indias, moste of them haue their rootes of small depth, and if they carry any from Spayne to plante elsewhere, if they do not set them of smal depth in the ground, they beare no fruite.
The best of all the Tree is the roote, and that woorketh the best effect, the which hath the rinde cleauing very fast to the inner part, and it is of colour Tawnie, and muche more of sweete smell then all the tree, and his Braunches: the rinde tasteth of a more sweete smell, then the tree, and the water being sodden with the roote, is of greater and better effects, then of any other parte of the tree, and it is of a more sweete smell, and therefore the Spaniardes vse it, for that it woorketh better and greater effectes.
It is a tree that groweth neere vnto the Sea, and in temperate places, that haue not much drouth, nor moysture.
There be Mountaynes growing full of them, and they caste foorth a most sweet smel, so that at the beginning when they saw first, they thought that they had beene trees of Cinamon, and in parte they were not deceiued, for that the rinde of tree as sweete a smell, as the Cinamon hath, and doth imitate it in colour and sharpnesse of tast, and pleasantnesse of smell, and so the water that is made of it, is of most sweete smell and taste, as the Cinamon is, and procureth the same workes and effects as Cinamon doeth.
The tree groweth in some partes of the Florida, and not in others, for that it is in the porte of Saint Elen, and in the Port of Saint Mathew, and not in any other partes: but when the Souldiers did waxe sicke, in places where this tree grew not, either they carried them to bee healed to the sayde places, or they sent them the trees, or their Rootes chiefly, and therewith did heale them.
The best of the is the roote, them the bowes, and nexte the tree, and the best of all is the rindes.
The complection and temperature of the tree and of his bowes, is hot drie in the seconde degree, the rinde is somewhat more hot then the rest, for that it entreth into the thirde degree, of heate, and drieth, and this is manifestly seene in the water· and so they shall neede of it, must procure to haue the rootes or bowes, which haue the rinde, for that which is without it, doth woorke so good effectes.
The name of this Tree, as the Indians terme it, called and the Frenche Men call it Sassafras
knowe not wherefore our Spaniardes call it after the same manner, beeyng taughte by the Frenche Men, although that some doe corrupte it, and call it Sassafragia by the name that we haue from thence, they of these partes doe call it Sassafras
The vse of the Roote, or of the Wood of this Tree the which haue treated of heere, is by the way of seething, in this forme the Indians did shew it to the French men, and they vnto vs: and as the Indians haue neither weight nor measure, they haue not kept in those partes any order in the making of the water of this wood, for that they doe no more there than put a peece of the wood, or of the root at their discretion made in peeces, into the water as they doe thinke best.
And they seeth it after their maner, without consuming more quantitie, then when they see that the seething is sufficient: so that all they which haue come from those partes, are very variable in their manner of seething, which is no small confusion to them that shall vse it, and likewise to the Phisition that shall minister it.
looke vpon the complection, and temperature of the sicke person, that shall take and vse this water, as also the manner and qualitie of the disease, and conformably make the water, and geue it to the sicke person, geuing to the Cholerike lesse seething, and lesse quantity of Wood, and to the Flegmatike more seething, and more quantitie of Wood, and to the Sanguine meanably: and so after this sorte too their infirmities, according too the qualities of them, for that if it bee not done according to this order, they cannot choose but make many errours in the vse of this water, and also it is conuenient that for the moe parte they keepe the vse of the diet gouernment which is necessary for the disease which they pretend to cure.
Let none thinke, that to take this water without order good consideration, as many doeth, there shall followe health: but vnto them rather taking it without measure without order, shall do vnto them much hurt: wherby it seemeth to me that when this water shalbe ministred, as well in the diseases that it cureth, as in any other whatsoeuer they be, it is necessary that they goe to some learned Phisition, that may dispose the manner and making of the Water, and the order which they shall obserue in taking of it, for that in the Winter it shoulde bee taken otherwise than in the Sommer.
And otherwise it must be geuen to the leane person, than to the strong, and in an other manner it must bee taken of the Cholerike, than of the fleugmatike, one order is required in the cold region, an other order in the hot.
Wherby it appeareth, that it is conuenient to keep order, measure, forme in the taking of it, for that there goeth no lesse with it then health life, co~sidering that we see it haue no price in the world, not to let it alone to the iudgement of him that knoweth it not.
It happened to a gentle woman, vnto whom for certaine of the Mother, proceeding of greate colde that she had taken, cou~selled her that she should take this water of the wood of Sassafras
And gaue her the order that shee should vse, in making and taking of it, which was asmuch as was conuenient for her disease, and seeming for her.
But she tooke muche of the wood, more then willed her, seething the water more then commaunded her, she thought that she should heale the sooner.
And as shee tooke it certayne dayes with this strength, she was burdened in such sort with a very great Ague, that not onely it stood her vpon to leaue the water, but it was needefull to let her blood fiue times, and put her life in aduenture, so procured infamy to the remedie.
After she was whole, and had preuayled, she returned tooke the water with the order that had first tolde her, and she healed very well of her disease.
It is time nowe that wee come to the vertues of this wood so excellent, whereof let vs speak particularly of euery one of them, as we haue knowne, and experimented them.
In generall our Spaniardes in those partes of the Florida where they haue beene and now are, doe vse this aforesaide water sodden at their discretion, for all manner of disseases, without making exception of any.
beeyng sicke of any manner of euill which commeth vnto sharpe, or long, hot, or colde, greeuous or otherwise, they them all by one maner of fashion, they heale all with maner of water, without making any difference, and the best is that al be healed therewith, in this they repose so much trust, that they feare not the euils which are present, nor haue any care of them that be to come, so they vse it for an vniuersal remedie, in all manner of diseases.
In one of the thinges that they haue founde moste profite in this water, was in Opilations, in the interiour partes, of the which they came to bee swolne, and to bee full of the Dropsie the most parte of them.
For of the long and large heates which they had taken, they came well neere generally to haue these diseases.
And with this water both the swelling and the opilation went away, and therewith they came to be made whole of the Quotidian Agues, which the most parte of them had.
For in goyng thither the most parte of them fell sicke, of these long and importunate Feuers, in the which haue experience by this Water, beyng taken as it ought too bee, for it woorketh maruellous effectes, and haue healed many therewith.
For the principall effect that it hath, is to comfort the Liuer, and to dissolue Opilations, and to comfort the stomake, which are the two principall thinges, that are most conuenient for the Phisition to doe, that the sick may be healed of the like diseases.
For in these euils it is not to be feared that the humors be corrupted.
And if the principal members be hurt, one of the things that these medicines which are brought from our Indias do principally, when the water of any of them is taken, is to comfort the Liuer, and to amende it, that it may ingender good humors, for if this be not done, the cure is in vaine.
And so our hath a maruellous propertie, to comfort the Liuer, and to dissolue the Opilations, in such sort that it doth ingender alowable blood.
And thereof he was all swolne, in such sort that he was well neere full of Dropsie And with purging him many times with Pilles of Ruibarbe and by taking of Dialaca amongest the said Purgations, and drinking the water of this Sassafras co~tinually without drinking of any other thing, he came to be healed very well, and was cleere of his swellings, and opilations.
And he did not let to drinke it vntill he remayned perfectly whole.
The manner of curing with this water made of the Sassafras for the Tertian Agewes long Feuers, will shewe you, and what hath passed in this yeere, that wrote this.
There haue beene many people diseased with the tertiane Agewes, so importunately, that no manner of medicine was sufficient to take them away, and to roote them out, insomuch that we let many alone, with onely good order, and good gouernment, without helping them any more.
They were opilated, and had euill colour of the face, and some of them were swolne.
And at that time it was, when the Captayne generall Peter Mellendis came from the Florida and brought him in common, this wood of the Sassafras and when euery man did so much prayse it, many of them that had Tertians, tooke water of the Sassafras keeping the order that the Souldiers gaue them, and surely saw in that greate maruelles, for that they healed many with the vse thereof.
Not onely of the tertians that so much did molest them, but also of the Opilations and euill colour that they had.
And seeing this, caused other to take it, that without counsel durst not doe it.
And it did very wel with them, but it must be wel seene vnto how it shoulde bee geuen, and to whom, that the cause may carrie with it both order and measure.
That which ordinarily was done, was to geue one cuppe full of the Water well sodden, in the morning with Sugar or without it, and after to drinke the water continually, that which was more simple, then the firste, and as the Phisition shall iudge to be most conuenient for him that is sicke, keeping the conditions in the takyng of this water that we shall speake of.
And surely it is a thing that geueth great contentment to heale onely with the drinking of a water, it beyng of a sweete smel, and good of sauour which is taken, and drunk without any maner of griefe, and so to doe that woorke which sharpe medicines and sirupes of euill sauour and tast cannot doe.
And such as did drinke wine, did water their wine with it, found themselues well with it.
In one thing it was seene greately to profite, which is in the vse of this water, in them that haue lost the lust of their meate, insomuch that it is restored to them, the lothsomnesse taken from them, by the vse of it, so that many did amende come to their health quickely.
And the vse of this water doth cause lust to meate.
The Souldiers doe co~mend it with suche admiration, that some came to leaue it, and not to drinke it, for because that it caused them to haue so great hunger, that they coulde not withstand it.
And because there was no suche abundance of meates wherwith they might satisfie their hunger, which the water was cause of, they would not drinke it, as not hauing sufficient for their maintenaunce, for they did all vse it for a drinke in steede of wine, and it was a great remedie for them, that by it they became whole, as appeareth by them which came from those partes whereas they doe vse it.
In the Hauana there is a Phisition, whom they take for a Man of good vnderstanding in these causes, who did cure many of them which came in the Fleete from the newe Spayne sicke, with onely the vse of this water, without geuing or making for them any other Medicine.
And it did very well with them, for that many were healed therewith, and he gaue them to drinke as much as they would, all the day, and at Dinner and Supper, and in the morning he gaue a Cuppe full warmed, to them that coulde not goe to stoole with a little Sugar not very white, and it wrought very well with them, for their going to stoole.
And to other he gaue Medicines of this water only and Hony, it made a good worke.
cured heere some that were in cure in the Hauana
And being ordered in this maner, they which came not wel healed thence, were heere fully healed.
In griefes of the head, and in paines thereof being very olde, which proceed of any cold cause, the taking of this water hot in the morning wel sodden, and at dinner and supper, and in the day tyme simple with good gouernement as well in the meate that is eaten, as in the rest of all other thinges, and doing this for many dayes, it cureth and healeth them maruellously.
It is conuenient for him that shal do this, that he purge himself first, and in the tyme that hee must take it, that he receiue certaine Pilles of Hiera simplex he hath no need to keepe himselfe close neither in his chamber, nor in his bedde.
He that shal take this, it is ynough that he go wel clothed, and that he keepe himselfe from the colde and ayre, and that he vse to eate good meates.
In griefes of the brest caused of colde humors, this water doth profite much, and openeth the waies of the brest.
It consumeth moysture and fleames, it stayeth the fluxe, the running which cometh from the head to the brest.
It must be taken in the morning hot, and drinke continually simple, for besides the ordinary drinking in the morning, it must bee drunke simplie for a long tyme.
For these simple waters as they doe their worke by little and little, so it is needful that they be continued for a long season.
It is good that there be put some suggar too it, that it may make the better woorke.
In griefes of the Stomacke when the cause is colde or windie, after that the vniuersal euacuations bee made, taking this water in the morning strong, as it is simple, at other tymes, it taketh them away and healeth them, chiefly if there bee any olde griefe, for that haue giuen it for this effect, to men that many yeeres did suffer most grieuous paynes in the stomacke, and with taking the water in the morning hot for certaine dayes, and continuing with the simple water for a long tyme, and taking once euery weeke pilles of Hiera simplex many people were healed therof very wel.
And thus we haue declared howe that the vse of this water restoreth the appetite lost, and giueth lust to meate.
In the weakenes of the stomacke, and in the lacke of natural heate, where that which is eaten is not consumed, it worketh great effectes, and helpeth digestion.
It consumeth windes, which are the cause of indigestion, it taketh away a stinking breath, and from them that do vomit their meate, it taketh away that euil custome, so that they eate little, and vse continually to drinke this water without wyne.
And aboue al other thinges, it maketh a good breath, and a good smel at the mouth.
In the disease of the stone of the Ridneis and reines, the vse of this water hot when they haue this griefe, doth greatly profit, and much more vsing it continually simple by it self, or with wine, for that it doeth preserue that the paine come not so continually nor so grieuously.
And also it maketh him that doeth vse it, to cast out much Sande, where the stones bee ingendred.
And also it causeth the stones that are in the reynes to be cast out, and staieth the ingendering of them, for that it consumeth the fleames, of the which they be principally ingendered, and the windes that be many tymes the causes of the paines.
To them which haue the burning of the Urine, to such as haue great burning at the tyme that they make their water, doe feele great heat, vnto such is not conuenient the vse of this water, for bicause it is hot.
Al such should vse of that wood, which haue written of in the first part of this Historie, which is excellent, for such as suffer the lyke burninges and paines.
For the stones and sandes, for al such euils comming of heate, the work is meruellous that it doeth, sauing that if there bee any stone in the Bladder, from which place proceedeth the lyke burning, for in such a case none of these waters doe take effect: but only the Surgions Raser when the Stone is greate, is that which doeth profite, as haue seene in many.
And whyle it is sayd it is a stone, it is no stone, death hath come vnto them that had it, whome if they had beene opened in time, might haue liued many yeres, as we haue seene in diuers of sixtie yeres and more who haue bin opened, and liued vntill they came to eighty yeres and more.
And aduertise you, that this wood, which call of the Uryne, and the stone, doeth make the water blewe, for if it doe not make the water blewe, it is not the right wood.
And now they bring a wood, which maketh the water yellowe, and this is not it which doeth profite, but that which maketh the water blewe, and this hath the couetousnesse of them caused, that bring it, because they haue seene that it is wel solde in this citie, for the manifest profites that it doeth, in these griefes of the Urine, by tempering the Reines, and the Liuer, and procuring many other benefits, they bring of all the wood that they finde, and sell it for wood of the stone.
The same hath happened in the Mechoacan which when it came to be worth twentie Ducates the pounde, they laded so much from thence of it, some not being rype, other not being right, that when it is come hither, it woorketh not the effect, that good and wel seasoned wont to doe. Wherefore it is needfull to see to that which is taken, that it bee the same, and that it bee well seasoned.
That which is very whyte, is not such as the yellowe is, in myne opinion, for that which is yellowe, wee see that it the better woorke: it may bee that the very whyte is not of it, or hath not the perfection that the good hath.
And comming to our water of Sassafras it prouoketh Urine, it maketh them to Uryne well, which haue the impediment of it, chiefly if it come by humors of causes.
did knowe a Priest, which came in this from the Florida, who being in those parts, did make water very euil, and cast from him stones, some tymes with very much griefe, and some of them did put him in hazard of his life, when hee was in the Florida, as hee dranke of the water of Sassafras ordinarily, as many other did in the place of wyne: hee auoided many great smal stones, without any paines, and after that hither vnto hee hath founde himselfe whole, and very well of this euill, by drinking the simple of this wood ordinarily, and watering his therewith.
Many doe drinke of this water for the same purpose, and they cast out much Sande, and doe finde themselues cured
In them that bee lame or creeples, and in them that are not able to goe, nor to moue themselues, as for the most part that infirmitie commeth of colde humours: by taking this water hot in the morning, and procuring sweate all that hee can, eating things of diet, and drinking the simple water continually, and vsing it many dayes: wee haue seene many healed.
And it is to bee noted, that in taking of this water, there is nothing to bee obserued, as in other waters: but when they shal take it hotte, if any sweate come, to keepe it, and after this they may ryse and goe well clothed: it is not needefull of any thing els, but of this and good order, and to eate good meates, and if they sweate not, it maketh no greate matter, but if they sweate not, they shalbe healed: knowe a Captaine, one of them which came from the Florida: and hee certified mee that hee was so weake in all his body, that his Soldiours carried him vppon their shoulders, for that in any other manner he coulde not stirre, and hee was in a place where the tree of Sassafras was not, and he sent for it and toke the water, and therewith sweate for certaine dayes, and afterward he tooke it simply, and hee was restored to his perfect health, and did see him whole, and well.
In the toothache, this wood beeing broken and chewed with the tooth that is grieued, and leauing that which is chewed in the hole of the tooth, which is grieued, if it haue any hollownesse, and although that it haue none, yet it taketh away the paines meruellously, with experience done vpon many.
In the euil of the Poxe, it worketh the same effectes that the rest of the waters, of the holy wood, the China and the Sarcaparillia doeth: taking it as these waters bee taken with sweates, putting vp more or lesse, the decoction of the water, and the quantitie of the wood, as the complexion is, and the disease of him that shall take it.
For that in colde humours Flegmatike, it maketh a better woorke, then in them that bee Cholerike: and so in the Poxe that bee of a long tyme, it maketh a better and greater woorke, than in them that be of smal continuance: and more where there bee knobbes, and moisture of matter, old griefes of the head, with the order as is aforesayd.
And in these euils the simple water is continually taken for a great tyme, and it worketh greate effectes, chiefly in them that bee leane, which be altogether weakened debilited, with the vse of many Medicines.
Many which haue the Gout, haue vsed, and doe vse to drinke of the Water of this tree, some of them taking it hotte, as wee haue sayde, and others simple continually by it self, and watering their wyne therewith.
That which haue seene, is that which in the olde kinde of Goutes, doeth neither good nor euil, and if it doe any good, it is to comfort the stomacke, and to dissolue to giue them some lust to their meate, the rest of the benefite that it bringeth, is to them that bin sicke but short time, if the cause proceede of cold, vnto whome it procureth notable profite, but if the humour and cause be hot, it doth them no good, but them, and them to haue greater paynes.
In one thing haue seene it in many people to bring notable profit, with the continual vse of this water, and it is in them which haue foule diseased handes, which cannot exercise them, as they were wont to doe.
healed a Gentleman which could not write, that when he went to write, his hande fell downe by little and little, and the penne also, after hee had begon to write not past fiue or sixe letters.
And hee toke a Cuppe full of that, which was last sodden in the morning, and after he dranke it, hee continued twoo houres in his bedde, and after he rose and went about his businesse.
And he did eate at his dinner good meates, and at his Supper vsed diet, and dranke the simple water of the self same Sassafras and he was healed very wel: hauing spent a great somme of money on Phisitions and Medicines, which did not profite him any thing, vntil he came to be remedied in the order as is aforesaide.
Many did certifie mee that, which nowe finde by experience, and learned of them that were sicke in the Hauana and could not goe to the stoole, that the Phisition which is there, did cause them to take in the morning fasting a good Cuppe full hotte of the water of the Sassafras and it did soften the belly, and they went to the stoole very well, which we haue seene heere to bee true by experience.
And there was a Soldiour which mee, and prooued it, with others of his companie, that hauing stooles by indisgestion and rawnesse of stomacke, for want of heate, it tooke them away, with taking of one good cupfull of this water euery morning fasting, and so with drinking it continually, but that which he dranke euery morning, he dranke it cold, and neuerthelesse hee was healed very well of the flixe, which he had many yeeres.
griefes of women the water of Sassafras doeth greatly profite, and in especially in that which is called the euil of the Mother: and where there is windinesse, it consumeth disseth it, and also any maner of colde of the and it dissolueth the swelling of it, curing any manner of disease which proceedeth of the Mother.
And this is so experimented, and so put in vse, that many haue beene healed with this water, that neuer thought to haue recouered health.
And in the withhelding the Monethly course that commeth, not to women, this water maketh a meruellous woorke, by prouoking and making it come in them that wholie doe lacke it, taking one Cuppe ful of this water in the morning: drinking it ordinarily at dinner, and at supper, and in the day tyme being more simple, then that in the morning, vsing good regiment, and dooing other thinges which may helpe the water, that it may bee prouoked.
And vnto them also to whome it doeth not come wel, it bringeth manifest profite, taking the water in forme as is aforesaide, keeping them the tyme that they take it, from such thinges as may offende them: and beeing vsed it doeth disopilate, and make a good colour in the face, as it is seene by the experience of them that doe vse it, hauing need of it.
Let them beware if they haue much heate, or bee of a hotte complexion, in such case let them moderate the quantitie of the wood, and the seething of the water, as is conuenient, and this is easie to be done, by seing howe it goeth with them at the beginning, with the vse of it, and according thereunto they may ryse or fal, as it seemeth to be necessarie.
Some women doe vse of this water, for to make them with childe, and in some it hath wrought the effect as it is wel knowen.
That which can say, is that a gentlewoman, beeing many yeeres married, without hauing children, tooke this water, for that her husbande vsed it for certayne euilles of Opilations, and of an agewe that helde with certayne sittes of a double tercian which he had, and hee continued with the taking of it in the Morning hotte, and at Dinner simple, and at Supper, and in the day tyme, keeping a good gouernement, whereby it came to passe, that she was with childe, and brought foorth a sonne.
And vnderstande, that one of the principall vertues that this water hath, is to dryue away the Mother for this effect, for the most parte of women that haue no children, is for the greate colde that is ingendered within the Mother, which doeth hinder the cause of generation, and as the water ryseth it consumeth it, comforting the place and dissoluing the windes, that are the let of it: am sure that it will manifestly profite, as we haue seene in them which doe not bring forth childre~, for hauing too much heate and drieth, to whome permit not the vse of this water, for because it will not profite them, and if they do take it and feele hurt thereof, let them not put the fault in the water, but in their complexions, seing that it is not conuenient for them.
The vse of this water doeth make fatte, and this is certainly knowen, for we haue seene many leane and sicke, that haue taken it, and haue healed of their euils, and haue recouered much more flesh, better colour, as those people that come from the Florida, do praise it very much: they they al say, that the vse of this water doeth make fat, and it happeneth so to many, and not onely it healeth them of their diseases, but also maketh the~ remaine with a good colour.
And so it seemeth by the~ that come from that country, for that they come al fatte, and of a good colour, who beleeue as they very sick, so that they were very leane yellow, when as they were healed of their infirmities which they had, they gathered fleshe, and became of a good colour, ingendering in the Liuer good blood, by the which the members were maintayned, than when they were sicke.
And surely it a greate thing that this water shoulde woorke this effect, that it is hot and if it were not for the causes that are aboue sayd.
And haue seene many that entered to the water of the wood, leane, and with an euil colour, to come foorth strong and fatte, and of a good colour, eating no thing then Almondes, and Bisket.
In pestilent and contagious diseases, which we haue seen· in the time of the Pestilence past, there were many that desired to drinke it, to preserue them from that euill.
And we did see that none of them which vsed it, were wounded of the disease, that then reigned.
Many did vse to carry a peece of ye Roote of the Wood with them to smell to it continually, as to a Pomander.
For with the smell so acceptable it did rectifie the infected ayre: carried with mee a peece a great time, and to my seeming found great profite in it.
For with it with the chewing of the rind of the Cidron nor of the Lemmon in the morning, and in the day time, to preserue health it a great strength and property.
And it seemeth to me, that was deliuered by the helpe of God from the fire, in the which wee that were Phisitions went in, blessed be our Lord GOD that deliuered vs from so great euill, and gaue vs this most excellent tree called Sassafras which hath so great vertues, and worketh such maruellous effectes as we haue spoken of, and more which Time wil shewe vs, which is the discouerer of all thinges.
It shall doe well to shewe the quantitie of the wood, and also the quantitie of water, wherein it shall be sodden, to prescribe a rule in waight and measure, in effectes, and temperatures, for them that are hot, and others that are colde.
will tell you the order that ought to bee kept in the water of this excellent wood, which must bee made conformably to the disease of him that shall take it, and to the quantitie and of the sicke bodie.
For the Cholerike Person the water ought to bee geuen lesse sodden, and with lesse of wood, and to the flegmatike more sodden and with more quantitie, of woode.
them that are very cold the water ought to be geuen more sodden and with more quantitie of Wood.
And vnto them be not so but doe participate of some heate: the water ought to be geuen lesse sodden, with lesse quantity of wood.
The like shall be done in the hot or cold times, in the age of the person, or the most causes making to this respect and proportion.
And for the more light, will here set downe the maner how this water ought to be vsed, the which shall serue to shew how that they may rise or fal therein, co~formably to the opinion which shall seeme good to euery one.
For in these infirmities that be very cold, they must set vp the water in quillates, both in seething and also in quantity of the wood.
And in the diseases that are not so colde, or that doe participate of any heate, they must set the water lower, in Quillats, seething it lesse, putting in lesse wood, the maner and order of the preparing it is this.
You shall choose the freshest wood that may be had, and that which hath a rynde.
For that wood which hath not the rinde, is not good, nor taketh effect, you must procure that it be of the roote, for that is the best of the tree for these effects and cures, and for the diseases which we haue spoken of.
And if in case there be no roote, then the bowes are the best that growe in the higher part of the Trees, and in case the lacke, then is the tree good, if so be that the one and the other haue the rinde of the roote, let there be taken lesse in quantity therof, more of the bowes, much more of the tree, which must be double to the quantitie of the roote.
Nowe let vs speake of the bowes as of a thing in the middest, betweene the roote and the tree, beeyng that which continually they doe bring, of the which you shall take halfe an Ounce, and cut it as small as may be.
And it must be put into three Pottelles of water in a newe Earthen pot, and there lie a steeping two howres: and after it must bee sodden at a fire of Coales, vntill the two partes bee consumed, and one
And after it is colde, let it be strayned and kepte in a glassed vessell, and vpon those small cuttinges of wood that haue beene already sodden, let there be poured other three Pottels of water, and let it seeth vntil halfe a Pottell bee consumed, and no more, after that it is colde, let it be strayned and kept in a glassed vessell.
Let the first water be taken in the morning fasting, halfe a Pint hot, and then keepe your selfe warme, and procure sweate, then change your selfe into hot clothing, and wipe your selfe from the sweate.
And eate of a Hen rosted, dry fruite, and Conserua, and drinke of the second water at Dinner and Supper, and in the day time.
And then rise and goe well clothed, and flie from all things which may offend you.
And at night make a light Supper, and eate drie fruite and Conserua, but eate no flesh at night, and drinke of the second water.
And this you may doe for as many dayes as you finde your selfe greeued: and if you finde your selfe well with the vse of this water taken in this maner, proceed forward vntill you be whole, if not, then co~tinue in taking of the strong water euery third day, drink of the simple water co~tinually.
After this order it may be geuen in all diseases, that we haue treated of, and it will profite.
But many will not submit themselues to this labour, which truely is the best of all others, that which is most conuenient.
Let there be taken halfe an ounce of the wood, little more or lesse, with the conditions aforesaide, and let it be made into small peeces, and seeth it in three Pottels of water, vntill halfe be sodden away, rather more then lesse.
And of this water you may drinke continually, at Dinner and at Supper, and in the day time, and surely taken in this order it doeth and hath done mauellous woorkes, and moste Cures, in long diseases, and importunate, taking it and a good in Meate and other thinges prohibited.
And howsoeuer it bee, beyng drunke so simple, it procureth great profite.
They that cannot forbeare drinking of wine, may water their wine for it will rather make it of a better tast and sweetnesse, for this water hath a most sweete smell, and tast, and aboue all, it worketh maruellous effectes, as we haue seene and do see in diuers and sundrie diseases, in the which ordinary remedies of Phisicke doe not profit, with the greate examples which we haue hereof.
And it is to be considered, that principally it doeth profite in longe and colde diseases, and where there is wyndines, other euils, that run this course, which shalbe knowne foorthwith by him that shall haue need of it, vse it.
And one thing is to be vnderstoode, that vsing it in the order as is aforesaid, although that he which taketh it haue no neede thereof, it can doe him no hurte, but rather if it be well considered, it wil manifestly profite him in the time that he shall take it, yea, although he leaue the taking of it when he seeth that he findeth not the profite which hee desireth, nor that it hath done him any hurt or harme during the time that hee hath taken it.
CARLO SANCTO [Figure: Of the Carlo Sancto, a roote brought from the new Spaine.
THey bring from the newe Spayne within this three yeeres a mauellous roote of great vertues, which is called Carlo Sancto the which a father of S. Francis order and published in the prouince of Mechoacan beyng taught by an Indian of that countrie that was verie wise in such thinges, and a man of greate in the vertues of them.
In the parte wee haue that there bee many Medicinadle which haue greate secretes, and vertues.
This Carlo Sancto groweth in that Prouince, in places which are which not drie nor moyst.
The forme and figure is like to our wilde of Spaine, for it a Lease as they doe, and it vp by any that is neere vnto it, and if it haue nothing to then it all along vppon the grounde: the is a sadde it neither nor the smell that it hath is little, and acceptable to some.
Out of the Roote a grosse tree, and it casteth foorth other Rootes of the greatnesse of a finger: it is white in colour, and hath a Rinde which falleth from the inner parte, the hearte of it is meruellously wrought: for it is compounded of certayne small boordes very thinne, and they may be deuided by one and one, the roote hath a pleasant smell, and beeyng chewed, it hath a notable bitternesse, some sharpnesse of tast: this roote hath his vertue in the Rinde.
In the ships that he now come, there the satin: of it, and now there is more knowledge of the vertues then before there was.
Many of them that came in this from the newe Spayne, doe speake much good of this roote.
But he that speaketh most of it, is a Gentleman that came from Mechoacan brought a good quantity of it with him.
That as he reporteth, also what we haue experimented of it, we wil speake of, and also of the complection and thereof, which is hot, drie, in the first part of the second degree.
The principall effect that this Roote doth profite in, is in mes and runninges of the head, for it causeth them to out of the mouth, and them from the head, a little of the Rind of the Roote, a good time, but it be in fasting, it boydeth out much from ye head, that would go to the partes, but before this be done, it is conuenient, that be purged.
chew it, can vomite, doe vomite with chewing of it, it causeth them to cast out much Choler and fleume, and much more it maketh them vomite, if they take the decoction of it, for it maketh the humour to come vp, which is in the stomake with much easinesse.
The comforteth the stomake, and also the gummes by chewing of it, and it fortifieth the teeth, and doeth preserue them from woormes, and that they rotte not, nor corrupt.
It maketh a good smell in the mouth, and because it is bitter, it is conuenient after that you haue chewed it, that you wash your mouth with wine, that the bitternesse may be taken away.
In the infirmities of women chiefly, where opilations are, and lacke of purgation, the pouder of the rynde of the Roote doeth dissolue them, and taketh them away, and maketh their purgation to come downe well with the vse thereof.
It must be taken with wine, or with water, sodden with Coriander, and Cinamon, which they must drinke, whiles they doe take it: it dissolueth windes, and comforteth the stomake, whiles they vse it, they must annoynt their Bellie with the oyle of Liquide Amber, and Dialtea of equall partes, and first they must bee purged, and take heede that they keepe all good order, and good gouernment.
In the euils of the hearte, chiefly beeyng ioyned with the Mother, the saide pouders and the water sodden with the rynde of the Roote, doe woorke very greate effectes.
They must take the pouder in the order as is aforesaide: and the weight of twelue pence of the roote, cut small and sodden in one Pottell and a halfe of water, vntill halfe bee sodden away: and then they must cast into it the waight of two shillinges of the ryndes of Cidrous beeyng and the weight of twelue pence of Cinamom made in pouder, and geue it certayne seethinges with them, and then strayne it: and they must take euery morning a small of sixe Ounces of this seething with Sugar, because it is somewhat what bitter, or without it as you please: and it is to be noted, that before you begin to vse it, you must make the vniuersall euacuations, which shall be conuenient.
This Gentleman sayeth which brought this Roote, it profiteth muche, in the disease of the Poxe, taking it in Pouder, or the seething of it: which haue not experimented, for that wee haue so many remedies for this euill, that wee haue made no experience thereof: he saith that it is to be taken without keeping, more, then when they be taking the water, or pouder, and that then they keepe good order and good gouernment in their meates, and in all other thinges.
In the falling sicknesse, a strong disease, and well neere incurable, they say that it hath a great propertie, and worketh greate effectes: taking the pouder of the rinde of the roote, with wine or with water, as is most conuenient for him that shall take it.
counselled one heere, who was more then fourtie yeeres of age, and had had it of long time, to take it, and hitherto he hath not felte more then to vomite with the pouder, when he taketh it, and he casteth vp much Choler, and his faintnesse is not so great as it was wont to be.
It seemeth to me, that it cannot take it away.
For it shoulde worke that effect in them, that doe not passe twenty and fiue yeeres, who vnto that time haue remedy.
will proue it vppon such: it woulde be no little good, that it might worke the effect that is spoken of it.
In griefes of the Head, they vse this roote in those partes, as a great and sure remedy.
The first time that sawe this roote, was in the power of one which was sicke, who came from Mexico and he brought it for a greate thing, saying: that he healed there with and tooke away the paynes of the head, which he had certayne dayes, and he asked me if that he shoulde vse it.
tasted of the roote, and it seemed to me as haue sayde, and counselled him that he vse it, as they had willed him to doe in Mexico and so he did chewe it in the morning, and it tooke away the paines of the head, which a long tyme had molested him.
After this, a passenger tolde mee, which came in the Shippe, where the Gentleman was that brought a quantitie of this roote, and he chewed it wel, did disfleume therewith, and immediatly it tooke away the payne, he shewed me a little that remained therof, which was the same that sawe, and since that, some haue vsed it, and it hath done very wel with them.
In the toothache, they that haue brought it into Spaine do much esteeme of it.
And being in the lodging where this man was which brought the roote, the host of the house certified me, that hauing the toothache very grieuous, it tooke it away from him with chewing the rinde of the roote, on the same side where the tooth was which grieued him, disfleming therewith as much as he could.
And being one day in the Custome house curing a Genoues which was there, an other of the same Nation complained vnto mee of the toothache, and wee caused to be brought some of the said Roote, and in the presence of as many as were there, hee chewed the rinde of this roote, hauing very greate paynes, and he auoyded much Fleume, and in disfleming it began to take away the paynes, and before he went from thence hee was throughly cured.
Certaine dayes past had a grief in one tooth, so that it pained me all one Night, and parte of one day, and gathered in a garden which haue in my house, leaues of Tabaco and also the aforesaid roote, and chewed both together, and disfleumed, and the paines went from me, and returned no more to me, being more then sixe monethes after was payned therewith.
This is the effect, that haue obtayned of this Carlo Sancto which being so little tyme knowen, is sufficient.
The tyme will discouer the rest, and as wee shal vnderstande more of it, so so wee wil giue notice thereof.
Of Beades, which bee called the Beades of Sainct Elen.
[Figure: FRom the Florida they bring certayne rounde Rootes which are called the Beades of Sainct Elen.
And they take this name by reason that they grow in a place of that Country that is so called: they are greate large Rootes, deuided into seueral peeces, and cuttinges, euery peece by it selfe, they remaine rounde as Beades, which being bored in the midst, they make of them Beads for to pray vpon, which the Souldiers do hang about their necks, for a thing of great estimation.
They dry them, and they are as as a bone, on the outwarde part they are blacke, and within white, and the Rinde is ioyned in such sorte, that the harte and it is made alone, they are wrought after they bee dry, and this Roote beeing tasted, hath a sweete smel, with a good taste.
And it seemeth by the taste that it is a kinde of Spyce, for it lyke to Galanga they are of the thickenesse of a mans thombe, somwhat lesse, the Plant hath a great stalke: the Bowes doe spread by the grounde, and cast out the leaues broade and greate, and very greene.
It groweth commonly in moyst places, the complexion thereof is hot in the ende of the second degree, and more drie in thereof are these.
The Indians vse hearbe beaten betweene to they pretend to wash themselues, their body with it: for they say that their flh and comforteth them with his good smell.
And this they doe for the most part euery day, for the great profit that they in it.
In griefes of the Stomacke, the Indians doe vse it, by taking the Pouder of it, and our also take it, for the same purpose, receiuing it in wine, being grounde smal, of the which haue seene notable experience in some.
In the griefe of the Stone of the Ridneis or Reines, the Pouder of this Roote woorketh a knowen effect.
For that some haue taken this roote made into Pouder in wyne, hauing the grief, and it hath taken it away.
And maruell not at al that his manifest qua~titie is sufficient, to worke the like effectes.
In griefes of the Uryne of them that cannot pisse wel, by taking the Pouder, it doth profite, and expel it.
thing vsed of many that haue come from those partes, for that they haue proued it in the lyke euilles, and here hath bin seene the same experience.
And one that had a stone which coulde not auoyde from him, vsed certaine dayes the pouder of this roote, and did easily auoyde the same.
uldier brought Beades at his Necke, made of these rootes, and with one day, and asked mee if knew Beades, and of what they were made, he saide it was told him that they of Gentiana
But declared him, that the des made of certayne rootes, that of Elen, that they were not made of Gentiana then he tolde me great vertues of them, rare that the vse of the~ had did beleeue: for it well, in the roote that they greate Medicinal vertues, according to their fashion, and sweete smell, and by that which had experimented of them.
[Figure: THey haue brought in these Shippes hearbe from the newe Spayne that the Indians cal Guacatane and it is lyke to our wilde tyme, sauing that it hath no smel, it is a litle hearbe, whitish, know not whether it carry Flower or fruyte, the hearbe haue without the roote: the name that it hath amongst the Indians, is as aforesaid, and the same name the Spaniardes also haue geuen it.
The Indians doe vse it for their infirmities whereof we wil speake, and for the same the Spaniards doe vse it likewise there in the Indias, and they also which haue brought it hither, with notable profite.
In griefe of the Pyles they vse it in this manner: they grinde or stampe the hearbe very small, and wash the Piles with wine, in the which there is sodden this hearbe, and if there bee heate in them, they seeth it in water, with that hot seething they wash them, and then they dry them softly, and cast the Pouder of this hearbe vpon them, surely the effect that it worketh is maruellous.
Thus after saw the good efects therof, much esteemed the hearbe.
Whensoeuer you haue any griefe of colde or of windines in any parte of the body wheresoeuer it bee, apply Turpentine vnto all partes, wheresoeuer the griefe is, and cast the pouder of this hearbe being smal ground vppon it, and lay a Linnen cloth vpon that, that it may cleaue fast as a Plaister, in such sorte, that it be not taken away, vntil the griefe bee gone.
And of this there is manifest experience, by them of the Indias, and also by vs of Spayne.
The pouder of this hearbe cast vpon little sores, and especially in the secret places doeth mundifie, and heale them.
[Figure: THey bring lykewyse from the newe Spaine, a kinde of Barley, which they cal smal Barley: they giue it this name, for the likenesse which it hath vnto our Barley: for it casteth out an eare like vnto it, and in the vaynes, the seede is shut, but it is different from it in qualities vertues: for that this smal Barley, is the strongest poyson, which at this day in hearbe, or plant hath beene seene, insomuch that it woorketh the same effect, which Sublimatum doeth.
And wheresoeuer it is needful to burne, or eate away dead or rotten flesh, putting the pouder of this seed thertoo, it wil doe the like worke that any burning Iron shal doe.
It extinguisheth and killeth any canker, howe strong soeuer it bee, it killeth and expelleth Wormes, wheresoeuer they bee, it eateth fleshe which is naught and rotten, taking it from the sores, and making them cleane from such euill fleshe.
The Indians for that they had no Sublimatum nor other remedies which wee haue, when they shoulde vse the lyke, they had and haue this seede most strong, and surely so it is, and they doe vse it, as a remedy most strong, and of great efficacie.
This pouder must bee layde too, by little and little, more or lesse, conformably to the greatnesse of the euil, applying things defensiue, which is vsed to be laid too, when as the lyke remedies are vsed.
In olde sores and filthy, where it is needfull, that naughty rotten fleshe bee eaten away, with taking of this Seede, and grinding it, and dissoluing it well with water of Planten, or of Roses, weating in the cleare water that shall remayne vppon it, some small clothes, or in place of the smal clothes, lint of fine Linen cloth, weate in the water, it cleanseth the sore, eating the euil fleshe in such sorte: for howe euill, olde, and filthy soeuer that the sore bee, it leaueth it cleane, and being laide to the flesh, it doeth soder and heale them, and after this is done, you must vse the Medicines which haue vertue to ingender flesh.
And the effect of this seede is no more then to mundifie, make cleane, and to take away the superfluitie of the wounde.
The self same effect that this seede worketh in vs, it worketh in beastes also, which for the most part haue very euill sores, that bee cankered, and full of Wormes, the seede being laide vnto them, if the cause bee so great, that it doth requyre it: or the water of it, as it is sayde, maketh the lyke woorke, as wee haue spoken of, and better, vsing alwayes the defensiues as is conuenient, where such Medicines bee applyed, for that it is a Medicine most strong, and it hath neede of them all.
An Indian brought me this seede with many other hearbes, and going about to discouer them and being come to this seede, tooke a graine and put it into my mouth, to proue it.
He that brought it, as one which knew it wel, kept back my hand, would not suffer me to proue it: for all that parted with my teeth one graine, which is no greater then one grayne of hempe seede, but some deale lesser, and beareth some likenes of it: at the tyme that it came to the point of the tongue, the seede being parted, made me a blister vpon it, which dured with me certaine dayes: commended it to the Deuil, and then beleeued what they had certified me of it.
began to make experience of it, and it wrought more effectually then was spoken of it.
It is hot in the fourth degree, and more if there be any more degrees.
Also haue an Hearbe which being sodde, and the water of it taken hot, healeth the euils of the brest: know not the name of it, but in the remembrance of them which came, it was written.
And an other which enforceth to cast out the dead childe of the belly: of the Indians haue great experience for this effect, and once in these countries, it hath profited.
They brought me two drie hearbes, which would haue been glad to haue seene greene: the one of these being in the field in all his force, if a man or woman doe put their handes vpon him, forthwith he falleth downe dead vpon the ground.
And the other lying abroade vpon the ground, in touching it to gather it, it shutteth it self together as a Cabadge of the Countrie of Murcia Thinges meruellous, and of much consideration.
haue blacke Eleboro, brought from the Prouince of Mechoacan like to that of Spayne, and woorking the like effect.
Certaine dayes past, a young man which tooke counsell of me, that came from the Prouice of Quito and beeyng with me, there came vnto me a neighbour of mine, saying, that his daughter was verie sicke of the Flixe, and had her in cure, and her disease increased with blood, requesting me that shoulde goe to visite her.
The Indian which was with me, asked me if they were stooles of blood, said yea: and he sayd vnto me that he woulde geue her a thing, that beyng made into pouder and taken, woulde take them away forthwith, that in the Prouince of Quito it had been experimented many times.
The Father of the sicke maiden, went with him to his house, and he gaue him certayne peeces of a fruite, which seemed to be of a greate tree: of the one parte they were very smooth, and of colour yeallowe, and of the other they were very sharpe and very redde, insomuch that they seemed of a purple colour.
They were ground smal, and he gaue the pouder to the sicke woma~, with the water of the hed of Roses, once that Euening, an other time in the Morning, and immediatly the Flixe did cease, from time waxed better, whereby she came to be whole.
And as for the man neuer saw him, after he gaue it to her· pages missing] ¶To the right Worshipfull, Maister Doctor Monardus, Phisition in Seuill.
RIght worshipfull famous Doctor, it will seeme a newe thing to your worship, that being not learned, not of your profession, doe write to you in things of your faculty, being a Souldier that haue followed the warres in these Countries al my life: haue done this, because am affectioned to your worship, by reason of a book which you haue co~piled of the medicines which are in these partes, of the vertues benefits, that by the~ haue byn receyued, which are so great that cannot declare the~, as they deserue.
And by means of your book we haue order how we should vse the remedies which we haue here, for before we did vse the~ without rule or measure, so that neyther they did work effect, nor with them the people were wel remedied, which now is to the co~trary, by meanes of your books, there hath been people remedied, that neuer thought to haue had remedy nor health.
yeeres vnto this day, that haue gone wa~dring by al these Indias, where are many things of those, which your worship doth write of in your book, other things also which haue not byn brought thither, for bicause the Phisitions that come to these parts, are nothing curious.
They apply not their eye to the vniuersal wealth, but to their owne particular, for they come onely to enrich the~selues, for the most part they be ignora~t people which passe to those Indias, they doe not esteeme of the good which they might doe.
And though that haue no learning, am affectioned to men of learning, so am to your worship, for that vnderstood of your bookes, and for the same that you haue in these partes, which is great, although knowe you not, yet was willing to take these paines, which is a contentment to You write in your book, geuing knowledge of the Bezaar stone, set down the signes of the beasts which haue the~: which being co~sidered, we haue happened vpon a kind of beasts that liue in the mou~taines of this country, which are much like to sheep or kiddes which your woorship speaketh of, which are in the Indias of Portugal, which breede haue these stones, of the which there are many in this country, in the mountaines, colde countries.
They are for the moste of a darke red colour, they are fed with healthful herbes, wherof is greate plentie in the mountaines, where these beasts do feed they be very swift, insomuch that they cannot bee hunted, but with the hande Gun: they haue no hornes, and in that onely they doe differ from them of the East India, for in all the rest they are the same.
certain ge~tlemen my freends went to the mountaines, to hu~t, we were a hunting fiue dayes, and we killed some of those beasts, which haue spoken of.
And as we went for this purpose, thinking that they were of the kind, of the~ of the East India: we carried your booke with vs, we opened one of them, the greatest that we hunted, and oldest we colde finde, we found no stones in his belly, nor in any other part of him, nor any other thing, wherby we that they were not the same kind of beasts with those of the East India.
And we asked of certaine Indians that went to serue vs, where these beasts had their stones, as they are our enimies, would not that we should knowe their secrets, they answered vs that they knew nothing of these stones, vntil one boy which was amongst them being an Indian of the age of
yeres, seeing, that we were so desirous to know the same, shewed vs the secrete of the pages missing] haue byn vsed since that hunting, that haue spoken of, which were the first that haue bin discouered in the world for the vse to heale diseases: we do trust that with them wil be done maruellous woorkes, according as they haue begun to do the~.
all this is owing to your worship, seing that by your book we had knowledge to seek them, to discouer them, to take them out of these beastes, which had them so hidden within them, that surely ther is much owing to your worship, for discouering vnto vs so great a treasure, as this is, which is the greatest that hath bin fou~d in these parts, wherby our nation is much bound to you, likewise al the world, because al men shal profit by the~, the rest of the secrets which you haue set down in your book, which bringeth vnto vs great profit.
And in recompence of the benefit which haue receiued, send here to your woorship a dosen of stones, by the returne of Iohn Anthony Corso, the rich Merchant, which if they come thither, your worship may make experience of them, in many infirmities, for you shal find great effectes in them.
By the same returne also your worship may aduise me of them, any thing that shal please you to commaund me, wil do it, as one that is most affectioned to you, because you are curious and learned, for doing so much good to the world, in those thinges which you haue written published.
Heerewithall send you a small Chest, in the which come certaine Frisoles, which you may command to be sowen in the beginning of Marche, that the colde doe not hurte them, which send foorth a plant like vnto beanes, but somewhat lesse, which haue certaine vaines where the seed is.
Halfe a dozen of them eaten with salt, being of the tast of green beanes, they purge valiantly, euacuate the water of him which hath the dropsie, without paynes.
The selfe same effect it worketh if that they be dry, making the~ into pouder, taking the~ with wine it is needful that meat be made in a redines: for if they work to much, by taking more then they should be, with eating any thing incontinent, the worke wil cease.
Also sende you an hearbe, which groweth in these plaine countries, clounge to the ground like vnto grasse, which is of great vertues for many infirmities, chiefly for them which are grieued with Reumes and Fleumes in the throate, taking them away easily with great benefite, and in this, griefes of the head Reumes chewing it, they do dissleume very much: they call this hearbe after my name, because vse it for the like euils, for that an Indian did teach it me, which knew much of the vertue of hearbes.
Also send your worship a fruite of a tree which is of great profit, these trees be not founde in any countrie but in this they are of the greatnesse of an Oke, of those in Spain: it hath many vertues, for the rinde, being made in pouder, and cast into any sore which is needful to bee made cleane, it maketh it cleane, afterward causeth the flesh to grow, healeth it.
And rubbing the teeth with this pouder, it maketh the~ cleane very wel, being laid vpon the gummes, if the flesh be taken away, it doeth incarnate them, if the teeth be loose, it maketh the~ fast.
Seething the leaues of this tree well in water, washing with the water thereof any manner of swelling, which hath any sore, or that is therof cankered, it taketh away the swelling, and impostume.
And making some small linen clothes weate in this seething, laying them warme vpon the medicine, which is laide vpon the sore, or vpon the pouder that is made of the rinde: it maketh the sores to heale more quickly, causing that there come no humour to them.
Out of the saide tree commeth a Rosine, which is of sweete smel, and serueth to perfume in many diseases of the head, to make plaisters for many and heere send it to your worship.
Of the fruite the Indians make a certaine drinke, which is for them very
Your worshippe may commande them to sowen, for would be glad that they should grow, for it will bee a thing of much delight, for the profite that it bringeth in Phisicke, and for the noueltie of the tree, for at al tymes it hath a very good smel.
brought into this country a blacke woman, which bought in Xerez de la Frontera and there did appeare vpon her when we came hither certain olde sores in her legs, which were of long continuance, and comming to the Ilande of the Margareta and beeing very sorowefull for the sores which my blacke woman had, an Indian tolde me that hee woulde heale her, and seeing that she had no other remedy, deliuered her to the custodie of the Indian, that he might heale her for me, and immediatly he toke a fruite, which is common in that country, and al people ingeneral doe eate it, which is of the greatnes of an Orenge, it hath a stone like vnto a Peach.
This stone the India~ did burne, and made it into pouder, for the stone is hard, can not be grounde, without burning of it: and he cast the pouder of it into the sores, which she had ful of much rotten flesh, and very filthy, which with the pouder were made cleane and very well, and it tooke out al the rotten flesh to the bone, and after it was cleane, with lint and a litle pouder laid too it, they began to be filled with newe flesh, vntil they were ful of flesh, and she was healed very wel.
And it is to be considered, that the little kernel of the stone hath so much venom, malice in it, that if any person or beast doe eate it, hee dieth forthwith without remedie, as though he had eaten any manner of venom corsiue, as Sublimatum, or any other Poyson.
In the Towne of Posco where dwelt certaine yeeres, there was an Indian, which did cure the Indians and the Spaniards of any maner of grief or disease that they had, with anointing their Iointes and the partes which did grieue them, with the iuyce of a certain hearbe, forthwith he wrapped the~ in many clothes, they did at the ioynts pure blood.
And also in the sick part where he did lay the iuyce, and as they went sweating he made cleane the blood with a Linen cloth, vntil hee perceyued that they had sweat sufficie~tly, with this he healed many diseases that were incurable.
And am able to say, that many did thinke that they had waxed yong againe, and were more strong and yong than they were before.
Hee fel sicke, for al that wee could do with giftes and faire words, and fierce words, and threatnings, he woulde neuer tel vs what hearbe it was, nor shewe it to any man in this country.
There is found a kind of tree, that is of soft the Indians wil make no fire of it, although you kil them.
For that they say, if any of them come neere to the fire that is made of this tree, or receiue the smooke of it, he remaineth impotent, for women.
And they haue this so certain in persuasion, and it is so verified, that you shal not make them to come neere the fire, that is made of that tree, for any thing in the worlde, for they are so carnal that they wil none of this.
They heale in these countries any swellings which are in thee feete or legges, caused of colde humors, with an hearbe called Centella which being stamped and laid to the swelling, there arise certaine Blisters, by the which there commeth forth great qua~titie of water humors, vntil it leaue Foote, or the legge dry.
haue seene great experience by these euacuations, amonge~st the Indians, for they vse them much, haue seene some Spaniards vse it, and were healed of lyke diseases.
in the Prouince of Chile they did cut of fro~ certain Indians being prisoners, the calues of their legs, to eate them, they rosted them for that purpose, that which is of more admiration, they applied vnto the place where they were cut, leaues of certain hearbes, there came not out a drop of blood, and many did see it.
And this was done in the Citie of S. Iames, in the presence of the Lord Don Garcia de Mendosa which was a thing that made al men maruell at it.
There are to be found here very few hearbes and trees like vnto those of Spaine, for that the earth doeth not beare them: but in the newe Spaine there are more of them than in any other parte of the Indias.
For when it was conquered, they found many trees and hearbes and Plantes like vnto those of Castile, and birdes and beastes likewise.
We heere snakes which bring admiration to such as see the~, for they be as greate as men, which are for the most parte tame, do no hurt.
It raineth Todes as greate as those of Spaine, which the Indians doe eate rosted, for they are a people which eate al kinde of venomous beastes.
There bee so many buytres, which breede in many Ilandes, that are in the sea, neere to the lande, that they eate vp the Cattel, and such numbers of them that it is wonderful, and as the keepers of them be black so they care litle for them.
One thing doeth make mee maruel, that the kine which are bread in the mou~taines, being brought to the plaine ground, doe al dye.
Kine to be weayed, they staid a tyme before they were wayed, and by litle litle, in one moneth there remained not one, but al died.
And that which is more to bee maruelled at, is, that they died al trembling, and consumed.
Some there be that do attribute it to the mountaines which is a countrie most cold, and it raineth euery day, and in the plaine countrie where there is no raine, but it is hotte, and as they moue from one extremitie to an other they dye, that trulie is a thing worthy of consideration, to see howe that in the space of eight Leages, little more or lesse, which are of plaine grounde from the coast to the mountaine, by a long vale of more then one thousande Leages, it neuer raineth in them, and in the mountaines it rayneth euery day.
Your worship shall vnderstande, that the eight day of October in this yere, there came hither a Cosin of mine, called Alonso Garcia a good Souldiour, who vs that he hath found an hearbe which is good against the venomous hearbe, which the wild people do
Which hearbe doeth kil without remedy, and these valiant people of the Indias doe vse it in their warres.
And likewyse those that from the Charcas towardes Chile, and liue like vnto wilde people, mainteining themselues only by hunting, and fleshe of mankinde, who haue killed with their arrowes which are poysoned with these venemous hearbes, an infinite number of Spaniardes· which they say bee not good to eate, for that their fleshe is hard, so that when they kil them, they kepe them to wax tender, three daies or foure daies.
But with this hearbe that is now found, the hurt shal be much remedied, that they doe make.
Howbeit our people doe not much feare them, but only the hearbe which they shoote withal, for that it maketh them to dye by madnesse, without any remedy.
And now with the recou~tering hearbe which they haue founde, they are al gladned.
They say it is an hearbe that carrieth very broade leaues, which are like to the leaues of Planten of Spaine: which being beaten layd to the wound that is poysoned, kill the venome, and immediatly take away the accidents, which the venome of the hearbe procureth.
They take it for a greate matter in that country, that they haue found such a remedy.
And you shal vnderstand that the cou~ter hearbe was found in the same country, where the hearbe of poyson was: thinke it be also in other parts, but there where the hurt is done, our Lords wil was to discouer the

It is thought that the blood of Drago is temperate, with little heate.
There was a gumme geuen vnto me which they bring from the firme lande of the Peru wherewith they purge them, which haue the Goute in those partes, they put of it as much as a Nut into water, and let it stande all the night in steepe, and in the morning they strayne and wring it, and take that water, which must be the quantity of two Ounces: and the patient must remayne without meate, till the middest of the day, and therewith they purge the humour, which causeth the Goute.

This is a thing amongst the Indians very common, and well knowne: and likewise amongest the Spaniardes, which dwell in those partes and they which come hither auerre it plainly, and affirme it to be so.

They bring also from the newe Kingdome and from the prouince of Cartagena a certayne Turpe~tine, very cleare, of sweet smel, much better then that they call de Vetae which they bring from Venice it hath all the vertues that the good Turpentine hath, it worketh the selfesame effectes, better, and with greater efficacie and readinesse.

And it doth mundifie being mingled with other thinges, all kind of olde soares, it is an excellent thing, washed, prepared, for the faces of Ladies which haue neede of it.
Moreouer they bring from the selfesame parts Caranna of Cartagena purified so cleare that it is like to Cristal, and surely it is better, it is applied vnto much better effect then that which hithervnto hath come, and maketh better works, and is of a more sweet smel, and more excellent in operation.
[Figure: MAny persons of them which came now in this last Fleate from the firme land, brought very good Mechoacan better then that of the new Spaine, gathered in the Coast of Nicaraga and in Quito: yea, since the Mechoacan was discouered, in the new Spaine, they haue founde the selfsame hearbe and roote in those partes which doe speake of.
And they vse it to purge, and it doth maruellous works, and they vse it in those countries and in al the firme land, as they did vse that which was brought from the newe Spaine, with maruellous successe.
From the Cape of Saint Elen, which is in the same coast, they bring another kind of Mechoacan but it is very strong, and beeing taken it causeth great accidentes of vomites and faintnesse, with many stooles, and for this cause they cal it Escamonea no man vseth it, bicause it bringeth pages missing] by incision, which commeth foorth like to a whyte teare or drop, most cleare, with a maruellous sweete smel, declaring wel the maruellous effectes, and Medicinal vertues that it hath, of the which wee haue treated in the first parte.
And that Balsamo which is made by seething, as wee doe there showe, we see the maruellous effectes that it worketh, with so great and maruellous vertues, that it bringeth admiration to the whole worlde, with many other maruels which hetherunto we haue seene, that be there spoken of.
And greater wil these woorkes bee, that shal bee done with the Balsamo which they nowe bring, made by incision: seeing that one drop of this is more woorth then twoo Gallons of the other, as it is manifestly seene by vsing of it.
And surely that which was in Egypt, and failed so many members of yeeres past, beleeue that it had not more vertues then this.
And am sure that this is of greater vertue and effectes then euer that was of.

It carieth no more but one graine in the ende, which is the fruite that the Indians doe vse, to perfume them withal, in griefes of the head, and in Reumes.
Surely the Balsamo is a maruellous thing, and it sheweth well in it selfe what it is, according to the workes therof.
They bring moreouer from the firme land a Turpe~tine, or Licor, which is called Deabeto and it is gathered from certaine trees of mixture, they be not Pine trees, nor Cipres for they bee higher then our Pine trees, they are as straight as Cipresses trees.
In the highest part of the tree, it bringeth forth certaine bladders of two sortes, the which are great and smal, and being broken, there cometh foorth of them a maruellous licour, which falleth drop after droppe, and the Indians gather them with great deliberation, and they receiue the same droppes which bee in the bladder into a shel, and alwayes haue shelles lying vnder the bladders, they distill, and it is a thing done with such leasure, that many Indians doe gather very little al the whole day.
The Licor serueth for all things that the Balsamo doeth, it healeth very well woundes, it taketh away colde griefes, and windie.
Some do take it for the griefs of the stomacke, caused of colde humors, or for windines, with a little white wyne.
And it is to be vnderstood, that the Balsamo which is made by seething, or that which is made by incision, and this or any other manner of Licour of these of the Indias, which is to bee taken by the mouth, ought to bee taken but in little quantitie, which must not bee more then foure or fiue droppes, and it must not be taken in the Palme of the hand as it is sayde, but putting a litle wine or Rose water into a spoone, and pouring vpon that the droppes of Balsamo putting the spoone wel into your mouth, and letting the Licor fal in, so that it touch not the tongue.
For taken with it, or touching it, the sauour and tast is not remoued away in a long time: it procureth an euell tast, in such sort, that for this onely cause many doe abhorre it, and wil not take it, and from others it hath taken away the lust of their meate, by receiuing it and touching it with the tongue.
[Figure: ALso they bring from Cartagena and from the coast of the firme lande, from Nata neere to Veraga a certain kinde of Peper, which they cal long Peper, which hath a sharper taste, then the Peper which is brought from the Oriental Indias, and biteth more then it, and is of more sweete taste, and of better smell, then that of Asia or the Peper of the East India: it is a gentle spyce, to dresse meates withall, and for this purpose al the people in that country doe vse it.
Gentleman gaue me a platter full of it, for he brought a great quantitie of it for the seruice of his Ritchin, because they vse it in place of blacke Peper, and they take it to be of a better tast, and more healthfull.
haue tasted it, and it byteth more then the blacke Peper doeth, and it hath a more sweete taste then it hath.
haue caused it to be put into drest meates, in place of the Oriental Peper, it giueth a more gentle taste vnto the meates that are drest therewith.
It is a fruite that casteth out a high plante, of the greatnesse of a grosse Packethreed, and the lower parte neere to the roote, is as great as a litle sticke, that is very small: and vpon it are ioyned the little graines, very neere together, as though they were wrested one within the other, which causeth the greatnesse whereof wee spake: and beeing taken away from the litle sticke, the stick remaineth bare and whole: and it is greene being fresh, but the Sunne ripeneth it, and doeth turne it blacke, and so they bring it into these partes.
It groweth in the coast of the firme lande in Nata and in Cartagena and in the newe kingdome: in all these partes they vse it, as haue saide.
It hath the Medicinall vertues, which the Orientall Peper hath that we vse.
And going to visite a childe, the sonne of this Gentleman, which gaue mee this Peper, being diseased of the fire in the face, commanded him to bee let blood, and that to his face they should apply some litle cloth with Rose water, and the hearbe Mora: hee saide to me that hee liked the letting of blood well, because the boye was of Sanguine complexion, but as for that which should be laid to his face, hee had wherewith to heale it in short tyme: and he commanded to bee brought foorth, a thing lyke vnto a cake, as great as a meane platter, the outside was blacke, and within yeallowe, and beeing brought wel neere twoo thousand Leages, it was moyst, and hee dissolued a little of it with Rose Water, and layde it to the boyes face.
was desirous to know what it was, he said, that when the worke was seene what it would do, he would tel me whereof it was compounded.
The next day returned to the sicke, and his face was so amended, that maruelled at it, and immediatly he was washed with Rose water, a little warme, and hee remayned as though he had not had any euil therein at all.
The cake was made of certaine Wormes, which the Indians take out of the grounde, and they make them fatte, giuing them to eate leaues of a certaine kinde of corne, that they haue there called Maiz and after they are fatte, they put them into a frying panne of earth, and seeth them therein, and as they take of the skumme, they strayne it, and seeth it stil, vntil it be thicker then an oyntment, after the fashion and manner as he had it there.
They bring also from the Charcas certaine Rootes, that bee like to the Rootes of flower de Luce sauing that they are smaller and they smell much lyke the leaues of Figge tree: they call these Rootes in the Indias, a remedy against the venemous hearbe, for beeing made into pouder, and taken with whyte wyne, it is a thing of great strength, and of the greatest vertue, that is there against venome, of what manner or qualitie soeuer it be, so that it be not corsiue as Sublimatum or the lyke: and as for that kinde of poyson, with only drinking of much Milke they bee remedied.
This Roote beeing taken, causeth the venome to bee cast out, which is eaten or drunken, or any manner venemous humour, comming of any euill degree, or cause whatsoeuer, which is as wel done by vomit, as by sweate.
If bee any small Wormes, or long Wormes in the body, it killeth, and expelleth them: and if you haue any suspicion, that there haue beene giuen you any venomous morsel, whether it bee venome or witchecraft, it expelleth it: in which there is so much trust in those partes, that they take it for a meruellous remedy, for the thinges aforesayde.
The roote being tasted, it hath a sweete relishe, with some sharpnes.
From the coast of Nicaraga and of Nata they which come in these last ships, from the firme land, bring a certaine kind of purge with them, that surely by the tast is easie to be taken, and it worketh well, and without any payne, principally it purgeth Choler.
It is the fruite of a tree very great, after the maner of Thornish Chestnuts, which haue within them Chestnuts, sauing that they pricke not, but be playne· within those prickles there be some like to Chestnuts, made cleane without shale, well neere square, which deuide asunder, by meanes of a little skin, euery one into two partes, and so they are couered with it, and when they be taken occupied, that little skin is plucked away, they are made cleane fro~ it, for that beyng taken with it, it procureth most dangerous accidentes, and vomites, much faintnesse and infinite stooles: and without it the Chestnut is a purgation very gentle, and they purge easily, and without paines: if they be tosted, then they will purge lesse: if they be greene they eate them: or being beaten in a Morter, they take them with wine, or with the broth of a henne: if bee drie, they make pouder of them, any manner of fashion.
They doe their worke well, and with much assurance, keeping the order that ought to be kept, by them which be purged, and the humors beyng prepared, as is conuenient.
IN the first part wee declared, howe that they brought Sarcaparillia from Peru: which wee vse in some persons, and it worketh greate effectes.
And because there was but little of it and soone done, we returned to that of the which is that we haue
And ning as much as they can drinke at once, or at diuers times, and after they cast themselues into a sweate, and they sweate so much, that it runneth by the Bedde in great quantitie.
After that, they take cleane cloathes, and eate of a Henne, but they drinke of no other thing but of that iuyce which they tooke out of the rynde of the Sarcaparillia as well at Dinner, as at Supper, and they must eate very little at Supper, likewise at Dinner.
And they must procure to keepe themselues from the Ayre and from the colde all that they can, although in that Uillage of Guaiaquill wherein bee about fiftie houses, or few more, the most of them are Cotages, of little safegarde, and the Walles be made of Canes, and there be no Chambers on high, but onely belowe: they dwel all in places of little defence.
Being in this order and small comforte for lacke of Conserua and drie fruite, which were necessary, yet in eight or nine dayes they are made whole of all the diseases, that are healed with the Sarcaparillia and of many others which shoulde be very large to speake of.
It is sufficient that there goe no Man from thence which returneth not whole, although he had neuer so greeuous a disease, so that they bee not sharpe Agewes: For in that case the cure hath no place, or in any other sharpe disease.
All other diseases it healeth with maruellous successe, as it is seene by the great number of people which come thither, and goe away whole of the diseases, which they bring thither.
But it is needfull that he which doth enter into this cure, bee strong and not weake, for if he be weake, he cannot suffer so great sweate, without great perill of his person.
For these euilles they haue another manner of Water, that is, taking foure ounces of Sarcaparillia rather more then lesse, for that there they vse neyther wayghte nor measure, but doe put all at discretion, and they take away the rynde from the Sarcaparillia and breake it, without putting it in Water, if it bee greene, and if if it be drie, then they breake it put it in water, vntill it bee made soft: this rynd beyng without the heart, they seeth in
Pottels of water, little more or lesse, and they seeth it vntill halfe the water be diminished, rather more then lesse: and of that Water they drinke as muche as they can in many times, or at one time, and forthwith they betake themselues to sweat, and although they sweat not so much, as they sweat with the first water, yet they will heale, they moue their clothes, they eate of a Pullet, they keep themselues from the colde and ayre, and at Dinner and Supper, they vse the self same water, for that in one day they consume one seething: this people take it in this manner fifteene or twentie dayes, in this sort also they are healed of all their euils diseases, to the great admiration of the people.
And for the vse of this Sarcaparillia they do not except any disease, vnles it be feuers or sharpe diseases: these people purge not at the beginning, as we doe heere, nor in the middest, nor in the ende of the cure, for there is no other Phisition nor medicine, but certayne women which be there, that giue the water: they are women Phisitions, and therefore they take away, and put to as it seemeth good vnto them.
That which doe note in this businesse, is that they seeth the Sarcaparillia without the heart: that they vse not but of the rynde, which seemeth to be very well done, verie conformable to good Phisicke, for the parts of the roots which bee harde, should be taken away, as things superfluous, and without vertue profite, which rather do let and disturbe, that it cannot worke that effect which is desired in it, the vertue is in the rynde: and this is that which we doe commonly vse when we will profite our selues by it.
And so from henceforward, when shall ordaine this water for any that haue need of it, will vse the rynde onely.
Which is to take foure ounces of Sarcaparillia and too take away the hearte, pages missing] BEing in company with Iohn Gotierres Telo a gentlema~ very excelle~t, Treasurer of ye Contratatio~ house, a passenger which came fro~ the Florida, gaue him a peece of Ambar Grese very excellent, saying that he brought it from the Florida.
took it, brake it, it was perfect grese, of a very good colour, and in the vttermost part it was blacke, and asked him that brought it, where he had it: he sayd, that he gathered it in the coast of Florida, and that they haue it commonly of the Indians, that gather it in that Coast, and they take much pleasure in it with great delight, and contentment annoynting their faces with it, and other partes, for the good smell which it hath.
And surely it maketh mee maruell to see, that in our Occidentall Indias, there is so excellent Ambar and that the time hath discouered it vnto vs, and that there hath come from those partes not onely so greate riches, of Siluer and Golde, Pearles, and other precious stones, but that also nowe they bring vs suche excellent Ambar Grise a thing so esteemed in the world, so muche vsed for the health of the body, and so necessary to cure and to heale withall, so many and diuers infirmities, as we will speake of beeing a thing which for the delicacy of mankind, is an ornament, co~tentment wt very much serueth for vse.
do vnderstand also that other Passengers brought of the like Ambar and some in much quantitie, of which was very glad, and the first peece that saw was very suspicious vnto me, and after that had seen more, then beleeued that there was of it, in those parts, which is found cast vp vnto the coast.
Some there bee which thinke that it is the seede of a Whale, as it hath beene an auncient opinion, which is false, as Simeon Archiatros a Greeke author doeth shew, saying that the Ambar in diuers places doeth spring, they bee his fountaynes from whence it doeth spring, as those of Pitch Licor: the worst is that which these fishes doe taste, and swallowe downe, &c.
The same it seemeth Serapio doth vnderstande, and besides this Simeon a Greeke, and Actio finde no other Greekes that make mention thereof, but it is treated of by the Arabies with as great ignorance and confusion as may bee seene.
Whosoeuer by them will verifie what Ambar is, it is to bee determined vppon, that it is a kinde of Pitch, that cometh forth of springs Fountaines, that are made in the deapth of the Sea, and comming forth to the ayre, the Licor being grosse doth congele, and waxe hard, and is made the Ambar which we see, as many things else which are in the lower part of the Sea, are soft tender, but being brought out into the aire are made harde.
As we see in the Coral, which in the lower partes of the Sea is soft and tender, and by bringing it into the ayre is turned into a stone: and the Ambar whereof the Beades are made, in the lowe parts of the Sea is whyte, and being come foorth into the aire, turneth hard and stony, and is Pitch, which cometh foorth of a fountaine, which is in the Germaine Sea, wherby the barbarous opinions are confounded, that say the Ambar is the seede of the Whale.
And the cause whereof this ignorance came, was this, for that Ambar was founde in the Whales, and other fishes, and therefore men said that it grewe of it own nature in their mawes, and as this Pitch riseth vp to the highest partes of the Sea by reason of the lightnes therof, the Whales do deuoure it, thinking that it is a thing to bee eaten, and so men finde it in their Mawes.
For if it were seed, it would be found in other parts of their bodies, where it is natural to al beasts.
In my tyme was taken a Whale, in the coast of the Canaria that had more the~ one hundred pound waight of Ambar within him, and after that they killed many, and found none.
They that come from the Florida say, that there bee Whales by those coastes, and that they haue killed some of them, and founde neither Ambar nor other thing in theyr Mawes, more then fishes: also in the yong Whales which are very greate, although they haue killed them, that they found nothing in them, for that the Indians doe fishe for the~.
and take them with the greatest cunning that may bee imagined, which is after this maner.
One Indian taketh a long cord, and strong, made with certaine ginnes, and shippeth himself in a litle Boate, and maketh towarde the Whale where he seeth him comming with his yong Whales, and goeth to one of them and leapeth vppon him, and casteth his snare vpon his
The strong young Whale when hee feeleth this, he goeth downe to the deapth of the Sea the Indian hampered fast with him, for they are greate swimmers, and can abide long in the water: and the yong Whale as hee hath neede to breath, returneth vp to the height of the Sea.
And in the tyme that hee cometh vp warde, the Indian carrying with him a sharpe wedge, and putting it through his nose where he breatheth, he striketh the wedge into him with his fist, in such sorte, that the yong Whale cannot cast it from him, and when hee commeth vpp on heigh, the Indian giueth him corde, and taketh his boate, and goeth after the yong Whale, and as he cannot breath, he him easily, and he commeth to the lande.
It is surely a delicate and maruellous hunting, wherein they haue so much cunning, that a great Lizard or Crocodil of xxiiii. foote, the most horrible and cruel beast that is in the Sea, one Indian doeth kil.
Some say, that the Ambar is made of certaine fruite growing by the Sea side, where Whales bee, and in the Moneth of April and May, when it is in season, of sweete smell, the Whales doe eate it, and of that the Ambar is made, as if the fruite so eaten, would be conuerted into an other thing then into blood and flesh.
There bee many other opinions, concerning this matter what Ambar shoulde bee made of, which are confuted all: and it is to bee vnderstoode, that it is a kinde of Pitche which springeth from Fountaines that there are in the deapth of the Sea, in particular partes of it, as wee see there bee of Petrolio of Napta of Sulphur and of many other things, as in our Occidental Indias, of diuers other Licors: the best Ambar is that which is most like to a red colour, the whyte is not so good, and the worst of al is the blacke.
Ambar hath great vertues, and serueth in the world for many thinges, and so it is a substance of great price: for that which is good is worth at this day, twyce more the~ the most fine Gold.
For the contentment of man, and for the delicatenesse of the worlde, it serueth for many thinges: with it they make Beades, and fine perfumes, and odorous smelles, and water of Angels of most sweete smell, in diuers formes and fashions: with it they dresse gloues of diuers sortes, make Oyles and licors of most sweete and delectable smelles: it serueth for meates drinkes, in diuers and sundry formes, which to reporte, would be a large processe.
In medicinal thinges the vertue thereof is greate, and it profiteth very much in our Medicines, for it entereth into the most principall matters of Phisicke, which are compounded in the Poticaries Shoppes, as well Electuaries, as Confectio~s, pouders, pilles, Preparatiues, Ointme~ts, plaisters, many other thinges, that receiue great vertues therby: of the name of it, there is made a confection called
The vertues which it hath in particular are great, and of great effects, for that with it are healed diuers and sundry diseases.
And this the Arabiens did teach vs: for of the Greekes onely Simeon, and Actio wrote a fewe woordes of it, and also Actuario made the lyke mention of it: These three authours beeing Greekes, liued after the tyme that the Arabiens did wryte, and they made some recorde of the Medicines, and thinges which they wrote of, wherof the ancient wryters made no mention one of them is Ambar which the olde Phisitions knewe not before the Arabiens, for they made no mention of it.
The vertue therof is to heale, dissolue, co~fort any maner of way, wherin it is applyed: For that the co~plexion thereof is hot and dry, with some fatnes, and it hath vertue to mollifie, make soft, with other vertues that it hath besides.
And beeing applied to the Braines, in the manner of an oyntment, and melting it with the Pestel of a Morter being hot, and mingled with the oyle of the flowers of Orenges, in this sorte it taketh away the griefe of the head, it comforteth the Sinewes, it dissolueth any maner of colde which is in them, with a great prerogatiue and helpe, aswel in it own forme as in making a plaister of which is made of certaine compoundes, that it bee applied continually to that part.
Smelling vnto it in the peece, or making a Pomander of it, mingled with Muske, and Lign'aloe, it comforteth the braynes, and openeth the vnderstanding: in the one sorte, or the other, beeing applyed vnto it, it maketh a good memorie, and helpeth the vnderstanding that it may bee better and more perfite.
And it is conuenient that wee vse it more then women, for the hurte which the good smell doeth vnto them, which bee grieued with the Mother, for they ought not to vse it, if there be not a descending of the Mother to the lower partes: for in such case it were conuenient to smell much to it, for it causeth the Mother to ryse vp to his place, with the good smell, taking some euil sauour by the inferior partes.
And lykewyse by smelling vnto it, it comforteth the harte, and maketh the Spirites valiant and strong: and for this purpose it profiteth, being carried about one, and smelling to it, in the tyme of the Pestilence, and in corrupt ayres, to resist the corruption, and malice of them, with the vertue and sweete smel thereof.
It is a maruellous thing to vnderstande howe muche the Ambar doeth profite and succour them, which be olde, in what maner or sort soeuer they vse it: although with it excellent smel it comforteth the spirites, and the braynes of the head, yet it maketh thinne also Flegmatike humours, which doe continually abounde.
And some say, that the vse of it holdeth back age, and conserueth that it goe not forward, and it is good that such doe vse it in their meates, and in sweete smelles for their apparel and Chambers, and applied to the braine and harte, and that they holde it to smell in their handes continually: and that it bee put into the wyne, wherewith they shall wash their handes and face: for it is a maruellous thing howe much it comforteth, and giueth strength, wherein haue seene maruellous effectes, they which are old and crooked, and doe vse it, shal perceiue what great good it wil doe them.
In paines of women, it is a maruellous remedie, mingled with the Lode stone, and Galuano made in little plaisters layd vpon the nauil, to keepe the Mother in his place, and for the rest of the paines of it.
Chiefly by smelling to it continually, it profiteth women that the moother may come downe.
And if it ryse vp, putting into it a Tente of Cotten woll, dissolued with oyle of Liquid Ambar it maketh it come downe.
And being put into the mouth of the mother in women which doe not bring forth children, for the coldnesse that is in them, it is most excellent.
vse to take this confection: which is compounded with Ambar twoo partes, and the scraping of Iuory, one part grounde small, halfe a parte of Lignaloe made into pouder, and a little Muske: of the which make Pilles, and they must take three, that may way three pence, from three to three daies: applying moreouer the little plaister, which is spoken of, to the nauill, and the tent into the mouth of the mother: surely it doeth profite much, the vniuersal euacuations, beeing made, and it must be vsed many dayes.
The Ambar profiteth much in the diseases of the stomacke, and for the coldnes of it, if there bee a plaister made thereof, and of Alipta Muscata and of Storacke, after the maner of a brest plate, and laid to the stomacke: and likewise of the self same thing Pilles being made and mingled with wine, of sweete smell, and taken in the morning fasting.
For it dissolueth windes, it taketh away any maner of colde which is in the stomacke, it helpeth disgestion, it giueth appetite, and lust to meate, and this is conuenient for him that is colde of complexion, or for that which causeth the hurte of the stomacke, that commeth of colde: and therefore it shoulde bee conuenient for them that be old, and cold of stomacke.
It comforteth the harte, and healeth the diseases thereof, principally if they come of windinesse, or of cold humors, being taken by it self, or mingled with Lignaloe Muske, in maner of pouders, or pilles.
For that the Muske, as Anerois sayeth, comforteth more then al other sweete smelles that are in the worlde, for that the sweete fauour, and comforting smell thereof preuayleth more, then al other smelles.
In what maner of way soeuer the Ambar is applyed, by it self, or with other things, in infirmities of the harte, it profiteth, much applyed thereunto outwardly, and in any maner of sorte taken, it doeth comfort and strengthen, and dissolue any humour that is in the body.
doe cause Ambar to bee ground, which being wel mingled with yeallowe wax molted, and made into a thynne cake, and layde to the harte, doeth profite much in the euilles of the harte, chiefly if they come first of windinesse, Melancholie, or of any other cause whatsoeuer, so that it be not hotte.
The Ambar is very profitable for them that be Melancholike, for it maketh them very merie, taking awaye the causes of the euill, and dissoluing the windinesse thereof which there are very many grieued with al: and vnto such it is good to bee ministered, and to vse it after the manner of Medicine, mingled as we haue saide, in the morninges: and also to vse it laide vpon the harte, and vpon the braines, and in meates, for surely haue seene great effectes wrought in them that haue frequented it.
Where there is corruption of ayre, the Ambar doeth rectifie it by it self, or mingled with things of sweete smel, the place beeing perfumed with it, where men shoulde remaine, principally in the tyme of winter, and vnto such as doe suffer colde Rewmes, in cold tymes: chiefly perfuming their kercheifes, wherein they sleepe, with it, or with some mixture thereof, perfuming the Chamber likewise, for it is a maruellous thing to see the good woorke it doeth make.
And likewise it doeth good to them, which haue the palsey, or weakenesse of Sinewes, perfuming themselues with it, or with the mixture therof.
Those that haue the Falling sicknesse, by giuing to them at their noses, when they bee in their traunce or paroxismos the smoke thereof, it maketh to awake: and wearing it about them, smelling to it continually, the traunce doth not come so quickly, nor so strong.
And vnto those which suffer the disease of the Palseye, by anoynting their head with it, and all the vpper part of the skull, it bringeth manifest profite: for that the Ambar is a thing that comforteth the Sinewes and brayne, more then any thing that wee knowe.
One propertie the Ambar hath, that bringeth admiratio~, and Simeon Secto a Greeke authour doeth reporte, that if any smell to it before hee drinke wyne, it maketh him stand as if he were dronken· and if it bee put into the wine, it maketh him dronke indeede, in such sorte that a little wyne mingled with causeth dronkennesse, which haue seene by experience, in the house of a great Lorde of this Realme, where for delicatenesse, and daintinesse, they had a seller of Ambar as also Salte to cast into meates: and to a Iester there was Ambar cast into his wyne, and hee was made very with it.
Many other things were to treate of Ambar but because would not passe the limites of my purpose, leaue wryte of them, and the for that in the thirde parte wee wil declare that which we meane farther to say of them.
THE THIRD PARTE OF THE MEdicinall Historie, which treateth of the thinges that are brought from our Occidentall Indias, seruing for the vse of Medicine.
Wherein there is mention made of many things Medicinall, that haue great secrets and vertues: Nowe newely set foorth by the sayde Doctor Monardes, after that he had made the first and second partes.
Francis Pissarro prouided to make towarde his brother Gonsalo Pissarro gouernour of the prouince of Quito the Spaniards we~t thither with a good will, they went also vnto the cou~trie that was called the country of the Cinamo~, wt is an other prouince beyond Quito and the Cinamon was much spoken of amongst the Spaniardes, for it was vnderstood of the Indians that it was a thing of great riches, Gonsalo Pissarro departed with
Spaniards, and it happened to him euil in his iorney, for it was a sharpe countrie, without vittaile, with great trauel they came to that prouince called of the Indians Somaca where the Cinamon groweth, which is right vnder the Equinoctiall line.
The trees which beare it, are of reasonable greatenesse, they carrie a Leafe like to Laurel, they be al the greene, and they neuer loose the leafe, which is a thing common to all the trees of the Indias.
They beare their fruite vnto the likenesse of a little Hatte, that hath his Cup and sides as greate as a peece of eight Rialles of Siluer, which is foure Shillinges, and some greater, it is of the colour of a darke tawnie, as well without as within, it is smooth in the inner parte, and sharpe in the vtter, in the highest part of the Cuppe it hath a stalke, whereby it hangeth in the tree, it is as thicke in the side, as a peece of eight Rialles of Siluer, and the vppermost parte is fuller of bodie, and being tasted, it hath the same pleasauntnesse of tast that the same Cinamon hath, which they bring from the India of Portugall, and in like sorte there in the mouth the same sweete smell, and tast, that the same Cinamon of the East India hath, there remayneth in the mouth the same sweete smell and tast, with some drinesse: the it doeth being ground, respiring out from it the same smell, which the most fine Cinamon hath.
And in the meates wherin it is put· it geueth the same tast sauour that the Cinamon of the East India hath.
The trees haue a grosse rynd, but without tast, sauour or smell of the Cinamon.
cannnot tell if the little inner rynd haue any, onely the rynde haue seen with the fruite, as it is described: they say that the leaues beyng beaten, geue out smel of Cinamon, onely the vertue, sweet smel and tast, is in the fruite, which is contrary to Cinamon, that is brought from the Orientall Indias, for onely the Rynde of the tree is that which hath the sweete sauour and pleasant smell, as we doe all see.
And true it is, that some is better and of more sweete smell and tast, than othersome is.
For although that they are all one sorte of trees, which bring forth the Cinamon, yet some haue the rinde thinne, and that is the best Cinamon, and others haue it grosse, and this is not so good: and thereof it hath come, that there bee some which doe distinguish the Cinamon into diuers kindes.
For one sort they call Cassia and an other Cinamon, and an other Cassia liga and it is all one kinde of tree, that bringeth them foorth: but that the diuersity of the place bringeth forth one more fine than another, and so Cassia and Cinamon are al one, for that they differ not, but onely in the names, for all is Cinamon, thinne, and fine, and whereas you find written Cassia may be put Cinamon; and where you doe find Cinamon, Cassia
This our fruite that is called Cinamon, profiteth in Medicine for many thinges: beeyng taken and made into pouder, it comforteth the stomake, and it dissolueth winds, it taketh away the euill smell of the mouth, it is an important remedy for the griefe of the stomake, it is cordiall, it maketh a good colour in the face, and Cassia in drest meates is vsed euen as Cinamon is, because it woorketh the like effect, that it doeth: by taking the Pouder of this fruite with wine, or water made for the nonce, it prouoketh the purgatio~ of women.
It is hot in the thirde degree, and drie in the first, but with notable comforting, by reason of the drie parts that it hath.
DOn Francis de Mendosa Sonne vnto the vice Roy Don Anthony de Mendosa did sow in the new Spayne Cloaues, Peper, Ginger, and other spices, of those which are brought from the Oriental Indias, and that which by him was begun, was lost, by reason of his death, onely the Ginger did remayne, for it grew very well in those partes, and so they bring it greene from the new Spayne, and other partes of our Indias, and some they bring drie, after the maner of that of the East India.
The Ginger is a Plant which carrieth his Leafe like to somewhat more narrowe, with the same greenesse: the Roote is as it seemeth, some greater than other, and when it is greene, it burneth not in the mouth, wherefore beeyng made small into peeces, it is put into Sallettes, for because it geueth them both tast and smell.
They sow it, of the seede that it bringeth foorth or of the same little Roote, and of the one sorte and of the other it waxeth greate: and after the Roote is growen greate, they take it foorth, and drie it in the shadowe, where no moysture doeth come, for that is it which doeth corrupt him, and for this cause they bring it in drie earth and made in Conserua, although that here it may bee verie well made of that which is drie, burying the Roote at the foote of a place where many pages missing] led Emperiall, beyng abroade below and narrow aboue, and by the mouth of them there groweth out certayne Buddes, which are his Leaues, which cause him to shewe verie faire, and these Buddes are sowen, and of them growe the Plantes, which carrie the Pinnas and one Plant carrieth not more than one Pinna in the highest part therof: it groweth greene, and as it ripeneth, it turneth yeallowe.
They take from it the Rynde, which is verie thinne, for to eate, that which it hath within it is white, and softe, and melteth in the mouth, with a very good tast, and sweete sauour: sauing that it hath many small karnels rounde about it, which it is needefull that you cast from you when you eate them, which are of a Purple colour.
The smell thereof is like to a kinde of Quince, and where there is a Pinna rype, he smelleth like to a Quince ouer all the House where he is.
They take them to bee good for the stomake, and likewise for the hearte, and to restore the appetite lost: it is a generall fruite in all partes of the Indias, and much esteemed.
They are to be eaten at the beginning of meate, they vse to eate them in the hot after Noones: for they say that they do refresh: they are cold in my iudgement: they brought two sorts of them, the one drie, the other in Conserua.
The dry did serue for no other purpose, but to see the figure and the forme of them: in Conserua, they haue a good tast, although somewhat sharpe: they ought to be made in Conserua when they are greene.
THey brought mee from the firme Lande the seede of the Fruite which is so muche esteemed by the Indians, as also by the Spaniardes, which they call Guaiauas
The trees which carrie this fruite are of a reasonable greatnesse, they cast out their bowes dispersed.
They carie a leafe like to the manner of Laurell, the flower of it is whyte, according to the fashion of the flower of Orenges, sauing that it is somewhat greater, it is of a sweete smell.
This tree yeldeth much fruite, wheresoeuer it be sowen, and doeth multiply and spred so much abroade, that they take it to bee euil for the grounde where it groweth, for that in many pastures the people doe loose the feeding of their cattle by reason of them.
And they weue themselues one togither with an other like Bryers: the fruite which they carie is like to our Apples, of the greatnesse of a Pippin, it is greene when it beginneth first to appeare, and as it ripeneth, it turneth yeallowe.
In the inner parte it is whyte, and in colour russet, and being cut, hath foure places deuided, where it hath the seede, which is lyke to the seede of Medlers, being very harde, and of colour tawnie, al the stones within haue no karnel, they are without any sauour.
And to eate these Apples, they pare them from the Rind, the fruite is holsome, and of good digestion: when they be greene they are giuen to them that haue the Laske, for they restraine and binde much, and when they bee very rype, they make the belly very laxaatiue when they bee of a good seasonable age.
They are good rosted for them that be whole, and for the sicke, for beeing so rosted they are more healthful: and better, and of pleasanter taste.
And the best of them growe in trees which are tilled.
The Indians vse the leaues in seething, with the which washing their feete that are swollen, they cause them to abate, and the inner parts of the body being stopt or opilated, being washt with this seating, doe disopilate.
It seemeth to bee a colde fruite, and therefore they giue them rosted to them which haue hot Agewes.
It is a very common frute in all the Indias.
ALso they did sende mee the Seede of a plante or hearbe, which the Indians doe much esteeme, which they cal Cachos
The Cachos is an hearbe very reddish in colour, it carieth a rounde leafe thinne, it casteth out a fruite like to a Berengena of Spayne, where the seede doth growe: it is very small, and of a Russet colour, it hath a taste without any sharpnesse, onely in the mountaines of Peru this hearbe is found, The Indians doe much esteeme it, for the medicinal vertues that it hath, it maketh one to pisse wel where the lack of Uryne is, it doeth expell the Sande and Stones, which growe in the reines.
And moreouer they say, that the vse of it doeth breake the stone from the bladder, if the Stones bee soft, that they may bee dissolued, with taking very little quantitie of it, and of this they haue so many examples, that they cause mee to maruell at it, because thinke that the stone in the bladder cannot bee expelled, but onely to cut it out is the remedie, for that no Phisicke can dissolue him.
They say that taking the seede grounde with some water, made for the purpose, causeth it to bee cast out in Clay, and being come foorth it returneth to be congeled, and turneth it self into a stone.
Only to a yong man sawe this happen who had a stone in the bladder, and beeing certified of it by the Maister Surgions that had felt him, and of the accidents which hee had, caused him to bee caried at the beginning of the Sommer, vnto the Fountaine of the stone, and in twoo monethes after that hee was there, hee came whole from thence, and brought in a paper all the clay which hee had voyded from him at tymes, being of stone dissolued into peeces.
We wil sowe the seedes, although very little, onely to see the effect wrought by them, which as they say is in a cause so greate, and if it doe growe, we wil vse of it.
Sowed a seede which they brought mee from the Peru more to see the fairenesse thereof, then for any Medicinall vertues that it hath.
The hearbe commeth to bee of the height of twoo spannes, litle more or lesse, bowes it casteth out straight with certaine rounde leaues, very greene and thinne, in the hiest of the bowes there groweth a flower being yeallow, very high in colour, and onely it beareth fiue leaues, and in the middest of euery leafe there is figured a droppe of blood, so red and so firmely kindled in colour, that it can not be more.
This flower hath at the foote of it a stalke very long, which commeth out a good space from the flower.
It is a flower very beautifull, which doeth adornate gardens, it groweth very wel of the seede, or of the plante, and beeing tasted, it hath the same sauour and taste that the Mastuesso hath: it is notable hotte.
AMongst the thinges wt they sent mee fro~ the Peru there is a thicke rinde, which seemeth to bee of a great tree, and being tasted, hath a sharpnes of tast with some drynesse: the trees growe at the side of a riuer, where this rinde is taken of, which is twentie and sixe Leagues from Lima and they are not founde in other partes of the Indias, but onely there.
The tree is after the fashion of an as wel in the greatnes, as in the leafe.
The Indians when they feele themselues laden with Reumes, or haue the Cough, or any paynes of the head, they make pouder very small of the rinde of the tree, and take it in at their noses, and it causeth them to purge much at them, and with this they cleare themselues of the euil: which we haue experimented, by taking the pouder in at the nose, and it maketh them to purge notably.
It seemeth to be more then hot in the second degree.
IN the same Riuer there groweth an other tree, which the Indians call Pacal which tree is lesser then that wee haue spoken of before: the Indians doe vse it made in Ashes mingled with Soye, it taketh away any maner of sore or skabbe in the head, howe grieuous soeuer it bee, as wel those which growe in the head, as in the bodie: as also it taketh away the markes of the sayde skabbes or sores being neuer so olde.
Hether they sent mee a little of the wood, wherewith the Ashes are made, that we might make experience of it.
THey sent mee an hearbe which in the Peru they call Payco they bee certaine leaues after the manner of the leaues of Planten, of that making and greatnesse, and as they come dry they are very thinne: and being tasted, they haue a notable bityng, so that thereby they seeme to bee very hotte.
And being made into pouder and taken in wyne, they take away the griefe of the stone in the kidneis, which commeth of windinesse or cold causes: and being sodden and made into a plaister, and laide vpon the griefe, they take it away also.
LIkewise they sent mee another hearbe, which profiteth much in the euill of the reines, when it commeth of a hotte cause.
The Iuyce mingled with the oyntment of Roses amongst it, and one of the leaues or more, if it bee needful, laide vpon it, is good for an infla~mation, the iuyce thereof being put, and it profiteth much, for it doth resist the inflammation, and mittigate the payne.
The leaues which they sent me, bee lyke to small Lettice, with the same greatnesse, and being tasted they are of an euill savour: it seemeth to be some hearbe notable cold.
THey sent me from the Peru a fruite very good, that groweth vnder the earth, and very faire to beholde, and of a very good taste in eating.
This fruite hath no roote, nor doeth produce any plante, nor plante doth produce it, but that it groweth vnder the ground as the Turmas doe grow vnder the earth, which are called the Turmas of the earth.
It is of the greatnesse of halfe a finger rounde, and rounde about it is wrought with a very fayre worke, it is of a bay colour: It hath within it a little kernel, which when it is dry, maketh a sounde within, lyke to an Almonde: the rinde of it is tawny, and somwhat white, parted into twoo partes lyke vnto an Almonde.
It is a fruite of goood sauour and taste, and eating of it, it seemeth that you eate Nuttes.
This fruite groweth vnder the earth, in the coast of the Riuer of Maronnon and it is not in any other part of al the Indias.
It is to be eaten greene and dry, and the beste way is to toste it.
It is eaten alwaies after meates, as fruite eaten last of all, because it dryeth much the stomacke and leaueth it satisfied, but if you eate much of it, then it bringeth heauinesse to the head.
It is a fruite in great reputation, as wel amongst the Indians, as the Spaniardes, and with greate reason, for haue eaten of them, which they haue brought mee, and they haue a good taste.
THey brought mee likewyse a fruite of a tree which the Indians call Leucoma which is like vnto a Chestnutte of these of ours, as wel in colour as in the greatnesse, as also in the whytenesse that the Chestnutte hath.
did not breake it to see what it was, because they brought me but twoo of them, the one haue sowen, and the other haue for to sowe at an other tyme.
This fruite doeth beare a tree of much greatnesse, for it is of timber strong and harde, it casteth foorth the leaues lyke to Madronno which is a redde berie, growing in the Mountaines of Spaine.
This frute serueth to be eaten, for that they say it is of a good taste, good for the laske, because it is very dry: they say it is a temperate fruite.
THey sent mee a little Cheste made of Corke full of rounde beades stones and blacke, of greate beautie, so that they seeme to be made of the wood Ebano and they bee a fruite which a small treee beareth, beeing more crooked then straight, after the manner of bryers: and it carieth a round fruite as great as a Nut, couered with a certaine fleshinesse clong therevnto, which being taken away, there remaineth a round Bead stone, and so rounde that it cannot be rounder, of blacke colour, most harde, that it can not be broken.
This fruite serueth in place of Sope, in such sorte, that twoo or three of these with hotte water are of more effect to wash withal, and to make cleane cloathes, then one pounde of Sope: and so it rayseth the fome, and woorketh al the effectes that Sope doth, and so they proceed washing by litle and little, vntil onely the Beadstone doe remaine, which is that which this fruite is fou~ded on, al are pearced through: and there are made of them Beades to pray vpo~, which seemeth to be made of Ebano
They dure a long tyme, for as they are Beades so hard, that they breake not: this fruite is so bitter, that neither beast nor byrd commeth too it, for the bitternesse thereof.
haue sowen some of the Beades, and they haue growne, and they cast out from them faire leaues very great.
trust that they wil bring forth fruite, for nowe the plants are very litle, but in tyme hope they wil yeld it.
Gentleman which came from the firme lande certified mee, that hauing had certaine continuall Agues in that countrie, he came to be in a consumption, and was counsailed to goe to certaine Ilandes, which are betweene Puerto Rico and the Margareta for that there is in them greate quantitie of Crabbes, and they are the best of the worlde, because they are maintained by Pigeons Egges, which goe thither to lay, and of the yong Pigeons that are there, that he should eate no other thing but these crabbes sodden, and he was healed very wel: and although he had eaten much fleshe of Popingeies for that purpose, they did not him so much good, as the Crabbes did: and in them that are consumed, they haue a great property, as Auenzoar saith, and not only they profit such by manifest qualitie or degree, but also by their particular propertie which they haue, for the same purpose.
BIcause shoulde see the straungenesse of this Hearbe which is the Cardones of the greatnes of a torche of eight square, and wreathed like vnto it, they brought them vnto me.
It hath a Medicinal vertue, that being newly beaten in a Morter and put into Sores, it healeth and sodereth them forthwith.
And well neere my selfe had neede of it, for this purpose, for that one of the thornes that it hath, did pricke me.
THey sent me a little of an hearbe, and by reason it was so drie it came smal broken in peeces, so that the figure of it could not be seene, which they wrote was maruellous for them that are broken, whether they bee children or men that haue that kinde of griefe, and in those partes they haue it for a sure thing, and it is vsed by one Indian, by applying this hearbe greene, vpon that which is broken, being men or children.
And it maketh thervpon a certayne binding very strange, without neede of any maner of Brich, made for the purpose, for they may goe so fast and so swift being bound therwith, as though they had a paire of Briches, as one told me that had byn healed of the like disease, with the hearbe, and with the maner of bynding.
haue vnderstood that if the maner of binding be as good as this man speaketh of, it is sufficient to heale without the hearbe, or any thing els, by reason that saw a man of which healed all persons that were broken with onely the bynding that bee made of them, without vsing vnto them any maner of brich.
And this is certayne, that there be some here that were healed and cured by him.
ALso the same Gentleman wrote vnto me from the Peru that in the Riuers of the Mountaynes of that Countrie neere vnto them, there groweth a greate quantitie of Veruaine like vnto that of Spaine, with the which the Indians doe profite themselues in their cures, for many infirmities, and in especially agaynst all kinde of poyson, and for such as say that there hath beene geuen them a morsell, or the like thing.
spake heere with a Ladie which came from the Peru and she certified me that hauing beene many yeeres sicke, and being in cure with many Phisitions, she went to an Indian, that was knowen to bee a man that knewe muche of herbes, vnto whom the Indians did put themselues in cure, hee gaue her to drinke the iuyce clarified of Veruaine which shee her selfe made, and within a fewe dayes after that shee had taken it, she cast out from her a worme, shee sayd it was a vearie Snake, of more then two spannes long, and verie greate, and his tayle was parted, and after she had cast him out from her, she was well and whole.
And shee counselled a Gentleman which was in the Peru that was continually sicke to take it, and he tooke it in the morning with Sugar, for so she had taken it, because of the bitternesse that it hath, and he cast out a great number of long and small woormes. and one like to a white long girdell, and since that time hee hath very well his health.
And this shee counselled other Persons which were sicke, to doe, that had suspicion, too haue woormes, and with the vse of the sayde iuyce they cast from them many, and they were healed.
And it was so certainly, and shee shewed mee a Seruaunt of hers, and it was sayd that according to the greeuousnes of a disease, which hee had, there was geuen vnto him certayne thinges of witchcraft, and with the iuyce of the Veruaine that he tooke, he cast by vomite many thinges out of his stomake, of diuers colours, and it was said that it was that wherewith he was bewitched, which being cast foorth, he remayned whole, and of that which toucheth witchcraft will speake what haue seene.
sawe a seruant of Iohn de Quinatna Duenas beeyng Aburgales who did cast out at his mouth in my presence a greate bundell of of a browne colour, very small, and hee had in a Paper more then twice as much, which hee had cast vp two houres before, and he remained as though he had cast vp nothing at all, more then the alteration that hee had, to see, that he had cast vp such stuffe.
Iohn Langins an Almayne Phisition, and verie well learned, saith that he sawe a woman that complayned much of payne in her stomake, did cast out many peeces of glasse, and peeces of Earthen Platters, and of fish bones wherwith she remayned whole.
An other case like vnto this Beneuenius speaketh of in his book de morbis mirandis but that which do most maruel at, was, that a labouring man suffering great paines in his bellie, so that no medicine coulde profite him, did cut his owne throate with a knife, and after that he was dead, they opened him fou~d in his belly great quantity of heare, the like wherof he that haue spoke~ of did vomit, with many other peeces of yron.
These things do attribute to ye works of the Diuel, for that they ca~not be reduced vnto natural causes.
The Ueruaine is like that of Spaine, all the yeere it is greene.
haue an hearbe brought from the Peru which they call Mastuerco it is a little hearbe, doth carry certain small leaues that are round, which beeing beaten in a morter, and the iuyce of them put into any maner of wound, doth refresh, comfort and heale, curing it foorthwith, and the vse of it is not more nor lesse then the vse of the Tabaco in woundes which he freshly made washing them with the iuyce, and laying the beaten leaues to them, and being tasted it semeth that it is notable hot.
LIkewise they brought mee from the same partes an other hearbe, which they call wilde Lettice: the leaues bee like to Lettice, the colour is a sadde greene, it hath vertue too take away the Toothache, receyuing the seething which is made of the leaues, and holding it in the parte where the griefe is, and putting a little of the iuyce in the tooth, which is greeued, for so it taketh away the paines, leaues which are sta~ped, after the iuyce is taken out, must be laid vpon it, being tasted it is most bitter.
It seemeth to be hot in more then the first degree.
IN a great Cane they sent me a Licour which springeth out of a fountaine that is neere to the Sea side, it is of the colour of honie, as thin, the smel is like the Tacamabaca they say and also they write, that it hath great medicinall vertues, chiefly in the healing of olde diseases, and those which come of colde causes.
It taketh away the paines in any parte of the bodie, proceeding of colde or of windinesse.
It taketh away the colde in what part soeuer it be, it doth comfort and dissolue any maner of swelling, and it worketh all the effectes that the Tacamabaca and the Caranna doe, and so they vse it in those parts, in steede of them: you may not touch nor handle it with your hands, vnlesse you haue them wet, and wheresoeuer it be put, it sticketh fast, that it cannot be taken away, vnlesse it be wasted with long time.
They sent me this little for a shew, bicause they doe esteem it greatly, therfore they sent it as a thing very precious.
It seemeth to me hot in the third degree, with notable clammines.
Of the tree that sheweth whether one shall liue or die IN the yere of our Lord,
Whe~ the Earle of Nieba was in the Peru he had there a gentlewoma~ wc was married that serued him, her husband waxed sicke of a grieuous disease, an Indian of great reputatio~ seeing her to be in much sorow, saide to her, if she would know whether her husbande shoulde liue or die of that disease, he woulde sende her a Bowe of an hearbe, that shee should take in her left hand, and hold it fast, for a good while: and if he should line, then she shoulde shewe much gladnesse, with holding the Bowe in her hande: and if he should die, then she should shew much sadnesse.
And the Indian sent her the Bow, and she did as he had willed her to do: and the bowe being put into her hand, she tooke so much sadnesse and sorrowe, that she threw it away from her, thinking that she should haue died thereof, and so he died within a fewe daies.
was desirous to know if that it were so, and a Gentleman of the Peru that had beene there many yeeres, did certifie me and sayd that it was of truth, that the Indians did this with their sicke people.
It hath put me in admiration, and in much consideration.
FRom the firme Lande they brought mee certayne Fruites which are herbes which they call in the hils of the Peru where they grow, and this name the Spaniards did giue them, for the likenes fashion that they haue to our which wee call pages missing] they sent me, is of a red colour, somewhat darke, and it hath a good smell.
ALthough in the second parte treated of the Bezaar stones, that haue been founde in the mountaines of the Peru for that they haue beene sent me by the first discouerer of them, the best of as many as from those partes haue come, yet would say in this thirde parte some thing of them, which he sent me for knowledge, saying: that because wrote of them they had of them: and the booke which wrote of them, was the guide to finde and discouer them, as we haue sayd, as he sheweth by his letter, which we haue set in the second parte, Those which hee sent mee too prooue bee verie excellent in their coullour, making, and greatenesse, whereof haue broken some, and finde them as excellent as those of the East India: and so they prooue in pouder, or in one little graine as the other doe, and in coullour well neere they are the same.
Truth it is, that those which haue this qualitie and goodnesse, and haue all the qualities that the Bezaar stones ought to haue which are fine, shoulde bee those that are taken out of the beastes, that are fedde in the Mountaynes, for those which are taken out of them that are bredde in the playne groundes, are not so good, nor haue any Medicinall vertues, because the Beastes not mayntayned by those healthfull Hearbes, whereby these stones are ingendered, for as they bee Beastes and chewe which they eate of the iuyce, that proceedeth from the herbs, the stones are ingendered.
Which thing that Gentleman gaue well to vnderstande, who was the first discouerer of them, who did see where they lay, and were bred within the beast, and with his owne handes made the Anatomy of him, and wrot vnto mee that the Bezaar stones are growing in those beastes, after the manner of a garde made of flesh, of the length of twoo spannes, little more or lesse, and of three fingers breadth, which is ioyned neere vnto the Mawe of the inner parte, and in the garde the stones are set in order one after an other, like vnto button holes, in a coate, in this forme.
[Figure: And they open that garde of flesh being closed, and take out the stones, that surely it is a maruellous thing to see, what Nature hath created there, for our health remedie of our euils And as haue vnderstoode, that these which are brought from the East India, be founde after the same maner, so speake the truthe, for they bring very many which are false, that amongest one hundred there are not to bee founde tenne that are true, and their wryters of the East India doe confesse, that there be made many indeed which are false.
The people of the East India take them cut also of a certaine kinde of Goates, that bee for the most parte redde as ours be: they are the best stones which are take~ out of cattel, which goe in the Mountaines of Persia: and likewise they take them out of other Goates, that goe in the playne Countries of Malaca and these are not had in such estimation, nor haue the goodnesse nor the vertues that they of Persia haue, because those Goates of Malaca doe serue for cattell to bee eaten, and they be not maintained by healthful hearbes of the mountaines, as they that pages missing] yet it taketh away the accidentes of it, the faintnesse sadnesse, and the griefe of the harte, which in these Feuers are common.
Surely they feele with the vse of it notable profite, in al long and importunate diseases do geue it, they finde profite in it, chiefly those which stand in feare, of any malice of disease, or windinesse, whatsoeuer it bee.
For haue seene, that in this it hath a greate propertie, and of this it commeth, that it is good to cast into pourges, some graines of it, that if the Pourge doe carry venomous qualities, it may rectifie them, and amende them, and if not, it giueth force, and strength to the harte, and they woorke the better.
In the oriental Indias they haue a custome to purge themselues twyce euery yere, and especially the noble people of estimation, and after they haue purged themselues, they take euery morning fasting foure graines of the Bezaar stone, with Rose water, or with water made for the purpose, and they say that this doeth conserue their youth, and strengthen the members, and preserue them from diseases: and it is a good vse, for it cannot choose, but doe them much good.
For Wormes they geue this Stone with most happy successe, and surely haue giuen it to many people, and especially to Children, and Boyes, that are tormented with this euill, and haue seene such workes as are not to be beleeued, if they were not seene.
geue it by it selfe, and also mingled with this pouder, in this forme.
doe take hearbe Lumbrigera the wayght of twelue pence, the seede of Santonico the wayght of sixe pence, the Horne of a Harte burned, and the seede of Verdolagas and Carlina of euery one the waight of three pence, and the Bezaar Stone of the Peru the waight of three pence: of these thinges let there be small Pouder made, and let them bee wel mingled.
These Pouders are maruellous and of greate effect, to expell Wormes, and very much experimented in many people, and they haue wrought in this case greate effectes, and they must be giuen in the morning fasting, as to the Phisition shal seeme good, according to the age of him that shall take them, vsing some Medicine of Milke, and Sugar twoo houres after they bee taken.
And vnto children being sicke of it, wee geue this stone mingled with milke; and without it, if they doe sucke, and it doeth a maruellous worke: and to them that be in yeeres, by it selfe, or mingled with other thinges appropriated for the disease.
In conclusion, we geue this stone in al long diseases, and importunate, where the ordinary medicines haue not profited, in which it doeth manifest profite, and if it doe no profit, yet it can doe no hurte.
FIgge trees beeing caried from Spaine to the Peru haue increased so wel in that Countrie, that there is great plentie of them, where they cary many and very good Figges, of all sortes.
And you shal vnderstande, that in that countrie there are certaine kindes of Uermyn, which are called Spyders, and wheresoeuer they bee, they doe spinne, and make Nettes as they of Spaine doe.
These kinde of Uermyn bee greate, and come to bee as great as Orenges, and they are so ful of poyson that wich one stinging they kill, vnlesse there bee vsed great remedie.
And if it bee long tyme without remedie, and that the Poyson goe vp to the hart, there is nothing that can bee done that will benefite, but he must die without remedie: and for this there is founde a remedy in the Figge trees, which is a maruellous thing, that as soone as the Indians or the Spaniardes doe feele themselues bitten by this euill Spyder, they goe to the Figge trees, and put vnto it the Milke which commeth foorth of the Leaues of them, two or three times to the place, that is bitten, and this worketh so great effect, that it remedieth it which is so poysoned, with the venom that the Uermine did cast into the sore, and the accidentes be remitted which they suffer, to wit, great griefs and soundings, remaining only to heale the place bitten, and as it is little, so it healeth forthwith, although they procure to keepe it open a long tyme.
And Gods wil is, that at all tymes this remedie shoulde not lacke, for the Figge trees neuer loose their leaues, throughout all the yeere they are alwayes greene.
Was desirous to see that hearbe so celebrated of the India~s, so many yeres past, which they call the Coca wc they sow and till with much care, and diligence, because they vse it for their pleasures, which wee wil speake of.
The Coca is an hearbe of the height of a yerd, little more or lesse, it carieth leaues lyke to Arraihan somewhat greater, and in that Leafe there is marked an other leafe of the lyke forme, with a line very thinne: they are softe, and of colour a light greene, they carry the seede in clusters, and it commeth to be red when it is rype, as the seed of Arraihan when it is type.
And it is of the same greatnesse, when the hearbe is seasoned, that it is to be gathered, it is knowen in the seede, that it is rype when it is of some rednes lyke to a blackish colour, and the hearbe beeing gathered, is put into Canes and other things, that they may dry, that they may be kepte and caried to other partes.
For that they cary them from the high Mountaines, to other places, as marcha~dise to be solde, they barter and change them for Mantelles, and Cattel, and Salt, and other things which runne like money amongst vs they plant the seede in Almaciga and from that they take them vp and set them in other places, into Earth that is wel laboured or tilled, and made conuenient to set them in by their lines and order, as we do set here a Garden of Beanes, or of Peason.
The vse of it amongst the Indians is a thing generall, for many things, for when they trauell by the way, for need and for their content when they are in their houses, they vse it in this forme.
They take Cokles or Oysters, in their shelles, and burne them and grinde them, and after they are burned they remaine like Lyme, very small grounde: then they take the Leues of the Coca and chewe them in their Mouthes, and as they chawe it, they mingle with it some of that pouder made of the shelles in such sorte, that they make it lyke to a Paste, taking lesse of the Pouder then of the hearbe, and of this Paste they make certaine small rounde, and lay them to dry, and whe~ they wil vse them, they take a little Ball in their mouth, and chawe it, rowling it from one place to an other, procuring to conserue it all that they can, and that being done, they take another, and so they goe, vsing it al the time that they haue need, which is when they trauell by the way, and especially if it bee by wayes where is no meate, nor plentie of water.
For the vse of these litle Balles taketh the hunger and thirst from them: they say that they receiue substance thereby, as though they did eate meate.
At other times they vse them for their pleasure, although they labour not by the way, and they vse the same Coca alone, chewing it tossing it in their mouths, from one side to another, vntil there be no vertue remaining in it, and then they take another.
When they will make themselues dronke, and bee out of iudgement, they mingle with the Coca the leaues of the Tabaco and chewe them all together, and goe as they were out of their wittes, or as if they were dronke, which is a thing that doeth giue them great contentment, to bee in that sort.
Surely it is a thing of great consideration, to see howe desirous the Indians are to be depryued of their wittes, and to bee without vnderstanding, seeing that they vse thus the Coca with the Tabaco and al to this end, that they would be without vnderstanding, and haue their wittes taken from them, as wee sayde in the second parte, when wee treated of the Tabaco
Maruellous thing it is, and well to be considered, the diuers colours of the groundes which are in the fieldes, in the countries of the Peru: for that looking a farre of you shall see many partes of groundes of diuers colours, which seeme to bee clothes of diuers colours layde to dry in the Sunne: for you shall see one parte of the grounde Greene, and an other Blewe, and foorthwith an other yeallow, and whyte, and blacke, and red, and so of other colours, all which are Mineries of diuers Earths.
Of the blacke can say that they sent mee a little that there with might make Inke, which beeing cast into water or wyne there is made there of very good Inke, wherewith one may wryte very wel, but it is somewhat blewe, which maketh it of a better shewe.
The red grounde hath beene a thing of great riches, for that which hath beene taken out of it, for it is a Minery most excellent, of which is made quicke Siluer, and there out is taken such quantitie of it, that there are carried to the newe Spayne, Shippes laden with it, which is a riches so greate, that it is not knowen vnto the Indians.
It serueth them for no other vse then to mingle it with certain gummes, to paint themselues withall, which they vse to doe when they goe to their warres to shewe themselues gallant, and fierce.
Euery day they discouer in those countries great Mineries of metals, such like things, for they haue found out a mountaine of Oker, a myne of Allom, an other of Brimstone many other things which they doe daily discouer.
Haue caused them to bring me from San+cto Domingo a leafe of that plant wherof they make the Casani and they brought it me.
The Casani is the bread, which the Indians so many multitudes of yeeres haue maintained themselues withall, and doe yet maintaine themselues, likewise many Spaniardes.
It is made of an herbe that the Indians doe call Yuca which is of fiue or sixe spannes of height, it carrieth certaine Leaues open, spreade abroade like to the fingers of an hand, and euery one carrieth seuen or eight points, they are alwayes greene, they are set in a ground well tilled, of peeces cut of from the same plant, the fruit is after the maner of grosse Turnepes, they are of colour Tawnie without, onely in the body, for within they are white, they them to vse them: and of this fruite they make Breade in this forme.
They make it cleane from the Rynde, and grate it in certayne Graters, which are made of Nedles, and being so grated they put it into a sliue of palme, vpon it they hang thinges of waight, which are great stones, which make the iuyce run out of it, and being well pressed it remaineth as Almondes beaten: cast this into a playne frying panne of Earth, that they haue put to the fire, and there they knede it, and make it like to a little cake of Egges, turning it from one side to an other, and after it is well kneded, it remayneth like a Cake, of the thicknesse of a peece of siluer of foure shillinges, or little more, which they lay in the Sunne, that it may drie, and these Cakes they vse for Bread, which are of muche substaunce.
These Cakes continue long time without corrupting, and they bring them in the shippes which come from those partes, into Spayne without beyng corrupted, and serue for Bisket too all the people.
It eateth as a thing sharpe, and so it serueth, and they lay it to soake in water, or in broth, or in Pottage, for after this manner they serue themselues better with it, then to eate it drie.
It is needefull to haue a vessel with water, for to soake it in.
It is a mauellous thing of the iuyce which commeth out of this fruite, which is spoken of, that if any Man or beast doe drinke it, or any part of it, incontinently he dieth, as with the most strong venome that is in the worlde: but if this iuyce doe seeth, and bee consumed the one halfe, and so set out too coole, it serueth for very good Uineger, and it is vsed as if it were made of Wine: and if you seeth it vntill it be throughly purged and thicke, it serueth for Honie, and becommeth sweete: you may see how much the seething auayleth in these thinges, seeyng that of mortal venome, it maketh meate, and healthfull drinke.
And will say an other thing which bringeth admiration: that all this kynde of Corne, which groweth in the firme Lande which is like to that of Sancto Domingo which they call Cacani is healthfull, and the Fruite thereof is eaten and the Water that commeth of it is drunke, without hauing any venomous qualitie, and that of Sancto Domingo howsoeuer it be eaten and the iuyce therof vnles it be sodden, it killeth.
And that the disposition of the place is so greate a cause, that that which is healthfull and allowable sustenance in the firme lande, the same is mortal venome in al the Islandes: as Columela writeth of the Peache, that it was venome most mischeeuous, which in Persia did kil men and being brought into Italy it lost that malice and propertie that it had to kill, and geueth vnto vs health, and a sweete iuyce.
Howsoeuer it be, hauing in the Indias so much Mayes, and so common in all partes thereof, woulde not eate Casani seeyng that the Mayes are of as good substaunce as our Wheate, and in no parte hath eyther venome, or poyson, but rather is healthful, and maketh a good stomake.
There is bread made of it, as of the Casani for they grinde it, and with water they knede it, and in a Frying panne of Earth they bake certayne Cakes, which they make of it, and it must be eaten freshe, assoone as it is made: for beyng dry, it is sharpe and trouble some to swallowe downe, and doeth offende the teeth.
The Batatas which is a common fruite in those Countries, take for a vittayle of muche Substaunce, and that they are in the middest betweene fleshe and Fruite.
Trueth it is, that they be wyndie, but that is taken from them by rosting, chiefly if they bee put into fine Wyne: there is made of them Conferna very excellent, as Marmolade, and small Morselles, and they make Potages and Brothes, and Cakes of them very excellent: they are subiect that there be made of them any maner of Conserua, and any maner of meat: ther be so many in Spaine, that they bring from Velez Melaga euery yeere to Seuill, tenne or twelue Caruelles laden with them.
They be sowen of the same Plantes that are sette, the smallest of them, or peeces of the greatest in the Earth that is well tilled, and they growe very well, and in eyght Monethes the rootes waxe very grosse, so that you may eate of them: They be temperate, and beeyng rosted, or otherwise drest, they soften the Bellie, and beyng raw, they are not good to bee eaten, because they are wyndie, and hard of disgestion.
Of the Canes which are good for the shortnesse of breath.
THey bring from the newe Spayne great Canes, of a Cane that are couered within without with a certain gu~mme, to me it seemeth that it is mingled with the iuyce of Tabaco it is heauy.
It seemeth that the Cane is annoynted, as a thing that the clingeth fast, it is clunged wel to the said Cane, and it is of a blacke colour, and being hard it clingeth not, they kindle the Cane at that part where the gumme is, and the other parte of it they put in the mouth, and they receiue that smoke, and with it they cast out from them all fleume and rottennesse, that is in the breast: and this they do when they finde themselues greeued with the shortnesse of winde, so that they be all ready to choke.
haue seene it done by a Gentleman, who is much payned with it many times, and receiueth by it great profite: and did it first with the taking the smoke of it, and it brought to him the like benefit.
And for this cause, say, that it seemeth, to carry with it the iuyce of the Tabaco mingled with the one and with the other.
It is done with al assurance, for that we do see it experimented with manifest assurance in many.
Some beeing sicke of the shortnesse of breath, that come fro~ the Indias, with it haue seene expel, cast out this rottennes, by taking a little Tabaco green, chewing the iuyce of it, wt although it be lothsome, it doth them much good to expell the rottennesse fleumes, which are retained within the brestes, so that they be lightened with it notably.
It is a maruellous thing, the greate vertues, and sundrie and diuers effectes that they doe discouer of the Tabaco: for besides that which haue written of it in the second parte, of the maruellous vertues therof, determined to make further triall of it, as haue vnderstood, and seene since that time.
IN the second parte wee entreated of the vertues of a Roote, that then they had brought from the newe Spayne, which they cal Carlo Sancto now in these ships they haue brought it, with great veneration and estimation: and the roote is called Indica and they bring written many vertues of it more then they are woonte too reporte of the Rosemarie.
Nowe that which hath beene and seene since that wrote of it, will speake, of this Roote, which being made into Pouder, geuen to women that newly brought Children, who for euill keeping haue taken greate colde and be numbe, it profiteth muche to prouoke them to sweate, and maketh them remayne cleere: it profiteth muche geuen with Wine, or water of the floures of Orenges, vnto them that haue a harde labour.
There was a Frier which had paynes of the Stomake, and no tast of his Meate, but had an euill breath, and much windynesse, and all did proceede of colde that hee had taken, and little natural heate.
He sodde of these Rootes in water at his discretion, as the water of the Sarcaparillia is sodden, and so he dranke it continually, at dinner supper for a long time, and it did so well with him, that he amended his stomake, and increased the heate of it, whereby hee did digest, and consume his meate very well, and tooke from him his euill breath, and consumed the windes, and in taken pages missing] from twoo to three Ounces of it, it purgeth well and easily, and euen as it is good to take, so it is good to worke, for that haue purged many people with it, and it maketh a very good woorke, and purgeth without paynes.
One thing they doe euill in those partes, which is, that they neuer bring them hither made with good Sugar, if they come so, they woulde be the better, and of better tast.
They bee purges for delicate people, they euacuate the same humor that the Canafistola doth.
Of the Canes of the small Canafistola there is made an other Conserua verie good, which is an excellent purge, and delicate: for they take the small Canes, which are growing of a small time, and seeth them in Sugar, and with the seething and Sugar, is taken from them the sharpenesse and the drinesse which they haue, and they are made tender and softe, and of a very good sauour.
These beyng taken, make a very good woorke, and purge without griefe or molestation, and without all accidentes and faintnesse that purges are vsed to procure, for that they are full of good tast, at the taking of them, and light of woorking.
They are geuen from two Ounces to three, haue geuen them many times with very good successe, and haue taken them beyng sicke, and they haue wrought verie well with mee.
Of these Conseruas they bring hither euery yeere from Sancto Domingo and Puerto Rico many Barrelles full.
The Canafistola that is perfect and rype, is the moste excellent Medicine for to purge withall, of as many as haue been knowne to this day, and that doeth his woorke best in that which it serueth for, and with most assuraunce, as it is wel knowne not onely to Phisitions, but also to all the world, and doeth his worke without the hurtes and accidents which other Purgatiue Medicines are vsed too doe, and it is a generall Medicine, and amongst them that are called blessed, is the most blessed of all, whose vertues and properties wee doe treate of particularly, in the first part, and that which we haue spoken heere, hath beene to geue relation of the leaues, and flowers of it, which they haue now brought mee.
One thing would they should be aduertised of, that when we are commanded to geue Canafistola to lighten and soften the bellie, and that the common matters may bee voyded downe, is ment that they shoulde take it a smal tyme before meate be eaten, at the most halfe an houre before, for the meate being mingled ioyntly with it, worketh with it, and in this order it maketh a very good woorke, and purgeth very wel, without paines: which is not done with that which is taken any long time before meate, as two or three houres before, as now many doe vse it, for that the meate beeing dilated, it maketh an ende of woorking.
And as it is a thing without strength and weake, it goeth al into vapours, and so sheadeth it selfe abroade throughout al the body: if it tarry long, it is conuerted into meate, and substaunce, which haue seene by experience many yeeres wherein haue practised, that alwayes as gaue it halfe an houre before meate at the most, it maketh a good worke, and if it be giuen many houres before meate, it purgeth, and euacuateth little.
Concerning mingling of medicines, which doe purge, with the meate, Hipocrates treateth of it in many partes, and Galene in his Commentaries.
And trueth it is, that when we wil that the Canafistola should not euacuate, but that the vapours shoulde bee spred abroade by the reines, and all the body, wee geue it many houres before meate, and then not working, it performeth the effect that wee haue spoken of.
THey newly bring now from the Firme lande, from a Prouince which is betweene Cartagena Numbre de Dios which the Indians call Tolu a or licour, that is the best thing, and of greatest vertues, of as many thinges as come from these partes.
They gather it from certaine trees, which are after the manner of litle Pines which cast out many bowes to al partes.
It carrieth the leafe lyke to Algarrona al the yeere it is greene, they are the best which growe in a softe grounde well tilled.
This the Indians doe gather by way of incision, certaine cuttes in the rinde of the tree, for it is and soft, and they set vnderneath it, neere vnto the tree, thinges like to dishes made of waxe, which is in that country blacke, which they take out of Hiues, that certaine blacke Bees doe make in the chappinges of the grounde, haue seene brought much of this Waxe into and it was spent in Torches, but it was forbidden that none of it should be spent, for the smoke which it cast from it, had so euil a smel, that it coulde not bee suffered.
They did vse this waxe in matters of Medicine, for therof were made which wrought very good effects, in mittigating griefe of any colde cause, it dissolueth any maner of swellinges, and woorketh many other good effectes.
Of this waxe the Indians doe make vessels lyke to a spoone, and set them close to the tree, that they may receiue the licour that commeth out of it, by the places where the are made, and from thence they receyue it into those vesselles: and it is needfull that it be done in tyme of great heate, that the cuttinges may cast out the licour, and in this tyme lykewyse, there soketh out of the ioyntes of the sayde tree some licour, and it is lost because it is so little, and falleth into the grounde: in the night time there commeth forth none.
This licour, or Balsamo is very much esteemed amongst the Indians, and is of greate value, and with the notable woorkes which therewith are done, and the Spaniardes haue learned, and by seeing the great woorkes which it maketh, they haue brought it hether, as a thing of great estimation, and such a thing as they buy there for a great price: and they haue reason so to doe: for one of the best thinges that haue come from those partes, which haue beene brought for Medicine, is this Balsamo, which seemeth to be better then that of the newe Spaine, and in it selfe appeareth to haue more vertues.
It is of an Alborne colour, very neere lyke to a thing that is gilt, it is not very thinne, nor very thicke, it clyngeth faste wheresoeuer it bee layde, and it hath the taste and sauour sweete, and although it bee taken, it maketh not any horriblenesse, as the other Balsamo doeth: it hath a most excellent smell, lyke to Limons, insomuch that where+soeuer it bee, the good smell thereof giueth greate contentment, and it can not bee hidden, for a little of it smelleth much: and if you rubbe your hande therewith, there remayneth a maruellous smel.
The woorkes thereof are excellent and very greate, for that it is licour which is taken out by incision, as they tooke out in olde tyme the Balsamo in Egypt: and for al those diseases for which that was good, this of ours is as good.
It healeth al fresh woundes, comforting the partes, and ioyning them without making any matter, and without leauing any signe of them.
The superfluitie that is in the wou~d must be taken away of what sort soeuer it be, washed with wine, ioyned wel in the lippes parts therof, and then the Balsamo laid to it, when the coldnesse is out of it, and forthwith a double linnen cloth vpon it, wette in the same Balsamo, and so bounde that the lippes goe not a sunder, and keeping diet, and vsing letting of blood if it be needful, and not vnbinding it vntill the fourth day, and they shall finde the wounde comforted, except that there bee any accident, which causeth it to bee vndone before.
And when the cause is such, that it requireth to bee dressed euery day, by reiterating the wette Linnen cloth in the Balsamo, it wil bee healed: for the vertue of this Balsamo is to cause that there bee no matter engendered in the woundes, and especially this Balsamo doeth profite in woundes, where there hath beene cuttinges of bones, taking them out that haue beene diuided one from another, and not touching the rest, for that the vertue of the Balsamo will caste them out, and hauing so done, wil heale the wounde.
One of the thinges wherein this Balsamo worketh greate effectes, is in woundes, and ioyntes, and in cuttinges of Sinewes, in al prickes: for in all these kindes of woundes it maketh a maruellous woorke, curing and preseruing them from extreame colde, and from running together of Sinewes, that they remayne not lame.
The woundes which doe penetrate, are healed with this Balsamo, being mingled with whyte wyne, and spouting it into them, and after three houres taking it out again.
This must be done in wounds or prickes, once euery that it may goe with a moderate heat.
Likewyse this Balsamo serueth to be applied, where haue beene giuen dry blowes, or brusinges, and for al workes of Surgerie, where is no notable inflammation, which beeing taken away with the Medicines, that are conuenient for it, the Balsamo may then bee vsed.
In euilles which belong not to Surgerie this Balsamo doth profit much, as in him that hath the shortnes of breath, by taking a fewe droppes in whyte wyne it profiteth him much: it taketh away the grief of the head co~ming of a colde cause, and a litle Plaister being laide vpon the griefe, and wette therewith to the Temples of the head, taketh away all runnings by those partes, and in especially the euilles of the eyes, and Reumes that runne into them, beeing layde to the foreparte of the head, and it must be good and hot.
It taketh away the paynes of it, and comforteth it, and remedieth the Palsie.
Some that haue beene in a Consumption haue vsed it, taking some droppes in the morning, licking them out of the Palme of the hande, and they haue felt notable profit.
And it maketh cleane the brest very wel, it is good to take some droppes with Aqua vitae hot, before any maner of colde in a Quarterne Ague, or of a long importunate tertian Ague, annoynting with the same Balsamo, mingled with Oyle of Ruda the Temples of the head, good and hot before the colde doeth come.
If with the Balsamo they annoint themselues from the mouth of the stomacke to the it comforteth the stomacke, it giueth a lust to meate, it helpeth digestion, it dissolueth Windes, it taketh away the paines of the stomacke, and it worketh farre better these effects, if the halfe of the Balsamo be mingled with another halfe of Oyle of Spike compounded or simple, and so it is better applyed.
There is great experience of it in the Indias, for Swellinges that are in the maner of Dropsies: and mingling it with oyntment, disopilatiue of equal parts, and annointing the belly therewith, chiefly the parte neere ye Lunges, there are seene wrought therewith great effects: it dissolueth any maner of swelling or hardnes that is in any parte of the body, and being laide vpon any paine that commeth of a colde cause, although it be of long continuance, it taketh it away, bringing it to be so smal vntil it fal of it self, the same it doeth wheresoeuer is any winde.
And if it bee in the belly, or in any parte of the body, wetting a Linen cloth hot in Aqua vitae of the best, and applying it to the place, where the griefe of the Stone is, and mingled with Oyle made for the purpose, it maketh a great woorke, it taketh away the paynes of the Sinewes, and when they bee shronke together, in a very hot weather, rubbing them with it, it dissolueth them.
The euil called the Lamparones that are open or shutte, it healeth.

Against al these venomes as well in general as in particular, the Phisitions as wel Greekes as Arabiens Latinistes wrote effectual remedies as wel generall as particular.
Amongest the which they put one in practise, that in tymes past was had in greate estimation, and taken for a present remedie, for the greate vertues and meruellous effectes, which it wrought against all venoms and accidentes thereof, which they called the Bezaar stone.
But as tyme is the discouerer of all thinges: so is it the destroyer and consumer of euery thing: for in hauing bene hid so long from vs, wee knewe no more what the Bezaar stone was, then as if it had neuer beene: and the name thereof was so strange and vnknowen vnto vs, euen as the Townes in Scitia
Time it selfe willing to restore againe vnto vs this precious stone hidden from vs so many yeeres; not onely discouered the same vnto vs, but iointly therwith hath descried vnto vs an hearbe, which hath the lyke vertues and effectes against all manner of venom, which hearbe is called Escuerconera hauing bene discouered but a fewe yeres past to our exceeding great profit and commoditie.
And because these twoo thinges, to wit, the Bezaar stone, and the Hearbe Escuerconera bee so lyke in operation, and haue so many and the selfe same vertues against venom, that determined to wryte of them both together, and to shewe the proper vertues of these twoo thinges so excellent in medicine: it is needfull first to knowe, and therefore treate of the venomes as a beginning of the woorke; and to declare what Uenom is, and the cause of such as haue taken Uenom, and then the remedies thereof, and howe they may bee preserued from them: and therefore we wil treate first of Uenom, for that it will serue not a little for the intent of that which we minde to write of the Bezaar stone, and the Hearbe Escuerconera
Uenom is a thing, which beyng taken at the mouth, or applied outwardly, doeth ouercome our bodies, by making them sicke, or by corrupting of them, or by killing them: and this is founde in one of these foure thinges; in plants, in minerals, in beasts, or in mixtures, the which worketh their effectes, eyther by manifest qualitie, or by hidden propertie, or both.
These venoms partly doe kill vs; partly we vse them for our profite, and bodily health; and partly the people of auncient tune did vse them for a remedie against their great labours.
That which doeth offend vs as well in generall, as in particular, Dioscorides in his sixth booke of his history of Plantes doeth treate of very exactly, putting in generall these remedies, and in particular, that which is conuenient for euery one of them: and the same did other Greekes, Latinistes, and Arabians, which are to be seene, who will more particularly know of them.
These did write of many Medicines, with the which euery one may preserue themselues from poyson: for the malice of mankinde is very greate, and many haue procured for their interest, and reuenge, not onely with venome to offende and kill the common sorte of people; but also Emperoures, Kinges, great Princes and Lords; the which in how much more high estate they are appoynted and placed, so much the more daunger they are in.
And many notable men of the olde Writers fearing this, did compounde many and diuers Medicines, that by meanes of them they might not bee hurte by venom or venemous thinges that might be geuen them.
As for example, the Emperour Marco Antonio did vse suche thinges, who fearing to be poysoned, tooke euery morning a little Triacle and Methridate.
Sometimes his confection Methridatica, other times certayne Leaues of Rue, with Nuttes and Figges: and so they did vse the like medicines because they pages missing] and inward and outward burning, that it seemeth to them they are fired.
It is also necessary (to know what venome they tooke) for too see the vomite, and what they doe cast vp withall, to iudge by the colour what Uenome it was: and beeyng knowen by this way, or by Relation, or otherwayes beeyng apparaunt, it must bee remedied by his contrary, for to estinguish and kill the malice thereof, as all the auncient Phisitions haue sufficiently written of, as well in generall agaynst all, as in particular against euery one of them, for that euery one hath his contrary effectes for to remedie the malice thereof.
The tokens that hee most euill in them that haue taken Uenome, be often soundinges, and to cast vp the white of their eyes, they doe waxe very red, and put out their tongue very great, and blacke, and the pulse fa, colde sweete vniuersally throughout all their body, chiefly in the extreeme partes, and in their brestes, and they are desirous to vomit, but cannot, and they haue their vnderstanding troubled: and this is in al kinde of venom being taken, or by bytings of venomous beastes, in so much that they talke ydlely as though they had the frensie which is a mortal signe.
It is needfull, for the better knowledge what Uenom it was, that it bee seene if there did remayne any thing of that which they had eaten or dronken, and to see what was that which was mingled therewith, iudging it by the colour, the smel and the taste, or geuing it to a Dogge, a Hen, or a Catt, and marke howe it woorketh with them: For if any of them waxe sadde or heauie, it is a token that there is venom; and if they dye, it is a token that the venom was strong.
And being knowen to bee venomed the first thing that is to bee procured, is, that hee which is sicke doe vomit, which is the thing that doeth most profit, bycause there should be no tyme for the venom to enter, by the vaynes, and arteires, for to come to the hart, for if it come thither, it is past all mans helpe: and therefore it is conuenient that this remedie of Uomite be done with all speede, that it may bee expelled, before it passe from the Stomake.
And for to cause Uomite, there must bee procured thinges that in very shorte time will prouoke it, as to put the fingers in hotte water, and the moste common thing is sweete Oyle, drinking muche quantitie thereof in suche sorte, that they fill theyr Bellies therewith, that it may the better bee expelled: the which hauing receyued, they shall with theyr Fingers, or feather prouoke them to vomite, which must be done vntill that you perceyue that all that be expelled, and cast out, which was eaten or drunken, which did hurt.
And if the Oyle bee not sufficient too doe this; there may bee thinges for to cause Uomite, beginning by the moste Weake, as the seething of Dill the Seede of Radishe of Camamell and other like thinges that doe prouoke Uomite, adding to the if it bee needefull, a Dramme of Agarico the which although it doe prouoke vomite strongly, it hath also the Propertie to breake the strength of the venome.
Some for a greate secrete doe geue a Pint of Water of the Flowers of Orenges warme, which although it doeth prouoke Uomite, it hath also a particular vertue too extinguishe, and kill the strength of the Uenome, it muste bee geuen hotte the quantitie of a Pynte.
And it commeth that the Water taken out of the Flowers of Orenges which is a kynde of Cydron hath greate vertue agaynst Uenome, as wee haue written in a little Booke which is printed with others of myne in Latine, that doeth treate of Orenges.
It is verie good that with the thing which prouoketh Uomite, there bee mingled thinges that haue vertue agaynst venome, as Triacle, Methridato, and other like thinges, the which heereafter wee will treate of.

If hee that hath taken venome doe not perceyue nor knowe what manner of venome it was that he tooke, nor the Accidentes thereof doe shewe; It is to be thought that it was of the venomes which doe theyr woorke of theyr owne propertie which is the woorst of all kynde of venomes: then it is conuenient that there bee had more care procuring vomite, and that it bee effectually done, as it is aforesayde.
And if any bee discended the Guttes, let him haue a gentle Glister that in all properties hath a knowne vertue agaynst venome, which remedies are called Bezaarticas the which must bee vsed at all times with his meate, and drinke, procuring the inwarde and outwarde comforting of the principall members, and vsing meates of substaunce that may geue great strength, taken out by a small presse and in any other sorte that is needefull, in the which there muste bee put thinges that haue agaynst all kynde of venome, of the which wee will of heereafter.
And this muste bee done, not onely in them that bee venomed with vnknowne Uenome which woorketh the malice of it owne propertie, but in suche as haue taken knowne Uenome which woorketh by qualitie: for that the Uenome is a thing that doeth moste of all pull downe and weaken nature, making leane verie quickly, and ouerthrowing the vertue and strength thereof.
These medicines which haue this vertue and speciall propertie against these venomes, are many: some bee simples and other compoundes: and bycause there are many of the one and of the other, will speake of them that are most vsed, and where is seene greater experie~ce of the~ which are compounded.
The principal is the triacle that Andromacho wrote of, the which if it bee well made, is the most principal medicine of as many as euer haue beene compounded agaynst al kinde of venom.
And although it bee of a true composition, yet there lacketh some medicines alwaies to doe that which is possible; wee doe see that in this case it doeth maruellous effectes, and not onely being taken with some water made for the purpose, but also beeing put into prickes or bytings of venomous beastes, and lykewise in Apostomes ful of poyson which are made in the tyme of the Plague.
The Methridate is of very great effect, in this case, and doeth serue sometymes for triacle.
That of Cidrons and Emeraldes doe make a meruellous woorke, in al venome.
The earth hath a prerogatiue aboue them, especially in feuers which haue an euil qualitie.
The triacle Diathesaron is for the purpose in colde venoms and in bytinges of venomous beastes, and in especially in the byting of a beast that is made.
And so you haue many other compounded medicines that haue vertue and propertie against venom: but these which haue spoken of, are the most principal, and found most true by experience.
The simple medicines bee many, the most principall is the earth Lemnia so celebrated of the olde wryters, in especially of Galen who only to see it, and to see how the priests did make it, to the Ilande of Lemnos that at this day is called Estalimene which is the most principal simple medicine that the Greekes knewe.

Lykewyse it is to be giuen to them that are bitten venomous beastes, or pricked of them, bycause it may extinguish and kil the malice of the venome: And although that these pouders are of so much vertue as aforesayde, the Bezaar stone is of greater vertue and excellencie, for that in it alone is founde all the vertues and properties that are in all medicines which we haue already spoken of, by his own propertie hidden and by grace from heauen infused into it against venomes: which you shall find to bee the best and most present remedy of all others, as wee wil shewe in that which followeth.
THis Bezaar stone hath many for the Arabiens do cal it Hagar the Persians Bezaar the Indians Bezar the Hebrewes Belzaar ye Greekes the Latinistes Against venom, the Spaniardes the stone against venom sounding.
Conrado Gesnero in his booke that he made of beastes, speaking of the Goate of the mountayne, sayth that this name Belzaar is an Hebrew name, for that ben in Hebrewe is as much to say as Lord, and venom, as if ye would say, Lord of the venomes and by good reason it is so named, seeing that this stone is Lady of the venomes, and doeth extinguish and destroy the~ as being Lady, and mistresse ouer them.
And of this it commeth that al thinges that are against poyson, or venomous thinges are called Bezaarticas for theyr excellencie.
This stone is ingendered in the inner part of a beast, that is commonly called a Goate of the mountaine.
The ingendering of stones in beastes is a common thing; and also in man chiefly, there is no in his body, wherein they bee not ingendred: and lykewyse in byrdes, and fishes, rattes of the field.
chapter, sayeth that the wilde hartes goe to the hollow places where snakes and serpents are; and with their breath doe bring them foorth and eate them.
And this is gathered heereby, that they doe it eyther to heale them of some disease; or to wax yong againe, that they may liue many yeeres.
The Arabiens doe amplifie this cause and say, that the wild hartes by eating of these serpents, come to ingender the Bezaar stone; and they declare it in this manner.
In these East parts are bred certaine beastes, which are called hartes, which for the great heate of the goe into the and hollowe places, where the adders and snakes and other vermin being of poyson are, which in that country be many, and very venomous, bycause the countrie is so hot; and with their breath they driue them out, and tread vpon them, and kill them, and eate them; and after they are filled with them, they goe as speedily as they can where water is, and they plundge themselues therin, in such sorte that they leaue no part of their bodies out, but their snowt, for to fetch their breath: and this they doe, that with the coldnes of the water they may delay the greate heate of the venome, which they haue eaten: and there they remayne without drinking a droppe of water, vntil they haue alayed and cooled, that feruent heate, wherein they were by feeding vppon the venomous vermine.
And being in the water there doeth ingender in the places the droppes of water co~meth foorth of their eyes, a stone, which being come foorth of the water, falleth from them, and it is gathered vp for the vse of medicine.
This is in which the Arabiens doe wryte of the manner howe the Bezaar stone is ingendered.
haue procured and with great diligence sought to find out by such as haue come India of Portingal and such as haue past beyond the China to knowe the trueth of this matter: and it is thus.
In the greatest India, (where Ptolomeo doth write to bee founde so much goods and so greate riches before the Riuer Ganges in certayne mountaynes which doe with the Countrie of China there doe breede certaine beastes lyke to Hartes as well in greatnesse as in swiftnesse, and are very much lyke vnto hartes, sauing in some respect they doe participate with goates, as well in their hornes which they haue lyke a goate, beeing turned backewarde, as in the making of the body: whereby they giue them the name of goates of the mountayne: wherein in my opinion they are deceiued, for they rather ought to bee called harte goates, in that they haue the partes and likenesses of both, which is of a harte and of a goate.
These harte Goates in those partes doe vse themselues lyke to the hartes, that Plinie speaketh of, in these places as is aforesaid, that goe to the dennes of wilde venomous beastes, and with their breathing cause them to come foorth and eate them: and afterwarde doe goe whereas water is, and doe plundge themselues therein, vntill they perceiue that the furie of the venom which they haue eaten bee past, and vntill then they dare not drinke a droppe.
And beeing come foorth from they goe into the fieldes, and there they eate many healthfull herbes, of greate vertue, which are against venom, which they by their naturall instinct doe know: that there doe aryse as wel of the venom which they haue eate~, as of the herbes which they haue fed on, being ingendred by meanes of the naturall heate, and by that vertue which is declared, being infused at the tyme of the generation in the inner parts of the bowelles, in other parts of their bodies, certaine stones, of the greatest and of the smallest sort, which is a thing of greate admiration, of the greatest vertue that to this day is knowen against venom.
It is vnderstoode of that venom which is so pernicious and that they did eate; of those herbes being so healthful that they fed vpon, by a meruellous woorke, the Bezaar stone is ingendered.
And as they say which come from those partes, and haue seene this beast from whom they take out these stones, hee is of the greatnesse of a harte and well neere of this making, hee hath onely twoo broade hornes, with the pointes sharpe, turned and falling much backewarde, his hayre is thicke and grosse of a mingled colour, for the most parte, and reddishe, and of other colours: you haue many of them in those mountaines.
The Indians doe hurte them and kill them with weapons and with snares and ginnes: and they bee so fearce, that sometymes they kill some of them: they are very swift on foote, and leppe much, they liue in hollowe places of the grounde, they goe in companies, there bee males and females, their voices are roarings: they take out the stones from the inner parte of their bowelles, and of other hollowe partes of the body, and they vse much diligence in the taking out of them, by reason the Portingales that doe trade thither, giue much for these stones, that they doe so take out, and they carrie them to the China to sell; and from thence to Maluco and from Maluco to Calicut for there is the greatest vtterance of them, and they doe esteeme so much of them, that one is woorth there, beeing fine, fiftie crownes, as they are heere.
And as was wryting this treatise went to see a beast, that shoulde seeme to bee the same, by reason hee hath all those markes which those of that partes haue, which sawe in the house of the Archedeacon of Mebla beeing a woorthie Gentleman, which was sent him from very farre Countries, by the way of Affrica and is in this forme and fashion: Hee is a Beast of the greatnesse of a wilde harte, hee hath the same hayre, coulour, and horne, that a harte hath, he hath the face, the head, and the tayle lyke a harte; hee is swift in running, like to a harte, his snowt is lyke to the hartes, and lykewise his countenance, his body is lyke to a Goate, for hee is lyke to a greate hee Goate; and hath twoo hornes turned backwarde, somwhat falling, with the pointes wrested, that hee seemeth to bee lyke a hee goate, and all the rest lyke to a harte.
There is one thing in this beast which is greatly to bee maruelled, for if hee fall from a Towre downe to the grounde, hee lyteth vppon his hornes, and receiueth no hurte thereby, but rather doeth rebounde as a ball of winde in the ayre: hee eateth grasse, bread, and all that you geue him, he is of great strength, and is alwayes tyed with a Cheyne, bycause hee breketh and byteth asunder the cordes.

The making and fashion of the stones bee of diuers maners for that some bee long as the stones of Dates, others bee lyke to Chestnuttes, others lyke to rounde pellottes, of earth, such as are shot in Crossebowes, others lyke to the egges of Pigeons, haue one lyke to the kidney of a kidd, there are none that bee sharpe pointed.
And as these stones bee diuers in their makings so they doe varie in their coulers, some haue the collour of a darke baye, others bee of an ashe colour, commonly they bee of a greene colour, and with blacke spottes, such spottes as the Cattes of Algallia haue, of a sad gray colour, all which are finely compounded of certaine thinne skales, or rindes, one vppon an other, lyke to the skales of on Onion, very artificially set, and those rindes are so excellent and so glistering, that it seemeth as though euery one of them were burnished by arte, and so taking away that which is vppermost of all, that which remayneth is much more glistering, and shyning, then that which was taken away: and heereby they are knowen to bee fine, and true, and onely for this tooke away from that which haue, the vttermost shale, that was vpon him, and that remayned was as glistering and more then the rst, these shales are greater or smaller according to the greatnesse of the stone, it is a light stone and easie to bee scraped or cut, lyke to Alabaster, because it is soft: if it bee long in the water, it dissolueth.
It hath no harte nor foundation in the inner parte, wherevppon hee is formed, but rather is somewhat hollowe, and the hollownesse is full of pouder of the same substaunce that the stone is of, which is the best.
And this is the best way to knowe whether the stone bee fine and true when it hath that pouder, for they which are false, haue it not, and by these twoo thinges they which are fine and true, may well bee knowne from those which are false and counterfayt.
In them that are most bee these thinne skales and rindes, glistering and shyning one vpon another; and the inner parte hath that pouder which haue spoken of: and those which are not true haue neither the one nor the other.
For sawe one that was broken, to see if it were fine and it had shales, and in the inner parte it had a grayne or seede wherby the Indian deceiued many.
Guido de Lanazaris a man naturally borne in this Citie, which trauelled all the rounde worlde ouer, and was in those partes of the China sayde vnto mee, that there were Indians that counterfeyted them with a composition that they vse and knowe, but the twoo thinges which is aforesayde they coulde neuer bring to passe: to wit, the glistering skales, and the pouder, that is in the inner parte.
And hee sayde to mee, that they were there much more esteemed then amongest vs, bycause they bee healed with them of many diseases.
Andrew Belunensis alledge of Tipthas Arabien in a booke that hee wrote of stones, and sayeth that the Bezaar stone is a mineral, and that it is taken out after the same manner as the other particular stones are, of his as the Diamondes, Rubies, Esraldes and Agatas: and it seemeth that Serapio doeth so vnderstande it, when he spake of this stone.
He sayde that the Minerall of this stone is in the lande of Syria, and of the India, and East Countries, in the which they were deceiued: for that it is cleerely seene that they are taken out of the sayde Beastes, which the Indians doe take out with greate diligence as wee haue sayde: and there is seene in them the woorke and manifest effect which we will speake of.
Serapio doeth shewe, that in his time there were likewise of these counterfayte stones which he sayeth haue not the vertue agaynst Uenome as the true Bezaar hath.
Of this stone finde no Greeke Authour which hath written of it, nor Latinist: onely amongest the Arabiens this matter is treated of, and in some late Writers which wee will speake of heereafter, and for this cause onely the Auncient Writers, beeyng Arabiens that wrote of it, and the late Writers Latinistes and those of our time, amongst the Arabiens hee that did most largely write of it, was Serapio a learned man, in his medicinall Hystorie in the
Chapter where he writeth many thinges of this Bezaar stone woorthie too bee knowen, the which of his owne authoritie he sheweth how great excellencie this stone hath against all kind of Uenome, of what and qualitie soeuer it bee, and agaynst the bytinges of Uenomous beastes, extinguishing and taking away the grounde, and euill qualitie, that the venomes doe infuse into the bodies, deliuering them from death that shall vse it.
It is geuen in Pouder, and they say that it doth the same effect by chewing of it, or holding of it in the Mouth: for after it is taken, it doeth prouoke sweate and doeth expell the venome, and maketh the woorke sure, saying that beeyng carried about any person, that it touch the flesh, and bringing it ouer the left parte, it doeth preserue him that shall so carrie it about him that no venome or venomous thing shall offende him: for beyng applyed to the bodie, it resisteth venom that it may not offende him: and them that bee infected therewith it healeth.
And this it doeth not onely to them that haue taken venome, but vnto suche that haue had it put into their Syrope, apparrell, or letter, or other parte that may offende them.
The same Serapio sayeth, that this Stone doeth profite muche agaynst bytinges of beastes that are venemous, and in their Prickes takyng the Pouder thereof at the mouth, and prouoking sweate, it expelleth it from the inner partes: it profiteth muche, too cast the pouder of this stone in Prickes, or in woundes made by these venomous beastes, for it destroyeth and taketh away the mallice of the venome, and although that the soares beeyng so made by these beastes doe beginne to corrupt, it cureth and healeth them, and the pouder of this stone beeyng put vppon the venemous beasts doth take away their strength, and if it be put in place where they doe wound any, although they make a sore, yet the malice of the venom doth not take
And this is seene by experience in the venomous beastes called Adders and Snakes, for the pouder beeyng put in place where they doe byte, all theyr venemous strength is taken away and nothing doeth remayne but the signe thereof.
Three graynes of this pouder wee with some licour, beyng cast vpon snakes and adders they dye foorthwith.
Rasis Simia of Gallen a man amongest the Arabiens moste learned in the booke which hee wrote called Continent saieth thus: the Bezaar stone is that which seemeth some what yellowe and soft, without any manner of taste, the which hee sayeth that he hath experimented two times, and hath found in it vertue of great efficacie agaynst Napelo the strongest of all venomes.
He sayth also that he hath seene in this stone the most maruellous effectes agaynst all venome that euer he saw in any Medicine, that was against eyther simple or compounde, or any composition made against venome, as Triacles, or other compositions, for that the Bezaar stone is of more efficacie and vertue then any of them.
The same doeth agree with the bookes he made to the King Almasor saying, The euill Uenoms that doe offende the heart and woorke theyr effect, how little profite doeth any cure proue in them, if the Bezaar be not taken, for that doeth resist it: and he sayeth, Moreouer my selfe saw that it did resist the venome called Napelo which is the Uenome that doeth penetrate more then all venoms: thus much of Rasis
An other Moore very learned and a great Astronomer that wrote of stones figured vnder Signes and Planets and the vertues they haue, was called Hamech Benreripho he in his booke that hee wrote of the vertue of Plantes and of stones and of beastes, that serue for the vse of Medicine, sayeth the Bezaar stone is agaynst all venome, and it hath besides this particular propertie taken in pouder agaynst the bytinges of Scorpions, and beyng carried about one, and grauen vppon, he is safe against all the bytinges of venemous beastes.
An other Moore called Abdala Narache a learned man in medicine, sayeth, that the Bezaar stone is agaynst all Uenome, he saw it as a precious thing in the hands of the King of Cordoua called Miramamolim vnto whom was geuen strong venome: and hauing geuen vnto him the stone, by meanes wherof he was deliuered wholly of the venome; foorthwith the King gaue his royall Pallace to him that gaue him the stone, which deliuered him from this imminent death: and surely it was a greate gift of a king, the chiefe Pallace of Cordoua at this day day beyng a thing so notable and of suche great value: and the stone was much estemed, for that so great a price was geuen for it.
Auensoar a Phisition of the Moores, but a naturall Spaniarde of Penaflore a place lying betweene Cordoua and Seuill gaue vnto one, who was very much lamented, by reason he had taken very euill Uenom, of the Bezaar stone the waight of
graines with the water of Goords, for that it was hot venom, because it did seeme to be so.
For assoone as he had taken it, there did appeare vppon him the Iaundice very yeallow, and he was very well deliuered and saued from it.
Aueroiz a Phisition and a Philosopher very excellent, being a Spaniarde, and borne in Cordoua saieth that the Bezaar stone is in great estimation and very profitable agaynst all venomous bytinges, and especially against the bitinges of Scorpions.
Haliabas doeth make mention of the Bezaar stone in three places where he treateth of Uenomes, but he passeth it ouer lightly, onely shewing that it is soft, and saith that it must be scoured in water and that the water of it must be geuen to them that are poysoned.
Rabbi Moises of Egypt, but borne in Spayne, a most cunning Phisition, who followed Gallen in all his woorkes, in the booke he made of venomes in the first thing that hee treated of in the thirde Chapter speaking of simple Medicines and the vse of them which are conuenient for the bytinges of Uenomous beastes, sayeth the simple Medicines that wee haue amongst vs of most profite and greatest experience which are of many approoued are the seede of the Cidron &c.
And the other is the Emeralde a maruellous medicine all venome &c. Gallen made mention of the third which is the Bezaar stone that is taken out of a beast, the which stone is like to an akorn, the colour therof is green and doth ingender by little and little making it selfe grosse: for that they finde in it skale vpon another, some doe say that they are ingendred in the corners of the eyes of certaine sheepe that are in the East partes: othere doe say that they are ingendred in the purse of the gall of the sayd sheep which pages missing] poysoned, caused him to take thereof diuers Morninges the waight of three graynes of the same Bezaar stone with the water of Oxetongue, and hee was therewith very wel healed.
Many Phisitions of late time and in our dayes haue made mention of this Bezaar stone and doe very much extoll the same in theyr bookes with great Prerogatiues, against all kinde of venome and agaynst many other diseases, which we minde to treate of, to see what we finde written by euery one of them.
Amongest whom Andrewe Mathiolus of Siena a man very well learned, in the Commentaries which hee wrote most learnedly vppon Dioscorides in the sixth booke, declaring the Medicines that are agaynst venome, by speciall propertie, doeth write of the Bezaar stone very geeat vertues, and doeth approoue it to be a medicine and remedie most principall that at this day is knowen in the Worlde agaynst venome, and he doeth referre that, as is sayd, vnto the Authours which wee haue alleaged.
Andrewe de Laguna borne in Segouia who amongest the learned was named Galen the Spaniarde for the Commentaries which he made vpon the sixth book of Dioscorides in the Spanish tongue, where he treateth of venomes, he sheweth how present a remedie the Bezaar stone is agaynst all kinde of venome and agaynst the bytinges of venomous beastes, and agaynst pestilent Agewes of euill qualitie, and also that it is a greate remedie agaynst the falling sickenesse, that it doeth expell the stone of the Raynes, and beeyng geuen with Wyne, it breaketh the stone in the Bladder.
There hee noteth howe this Stone is engendred in certayne Goates of the Mountaynes of Persia and howe the stones that are the best bee bright, and skaley and softe, of the colour of a Fruite of Spaine called Beringena which is a remedie muche commended amongest Princes and great lords for the effects afore+saide.
Valescus de Taranto a Phisition and borne in Milan the scholler of Tornamira in the
booke of his experiments, praiseth very much this Bezaar stone, to be of great force against venom and other diseases for his effectes, and for the great fame that was of his woorkes, in this tyme against al venom.
Saint Ardonius of Pesauris Phisition, in a booke which hee made of venomes, exceedingly prayseth the Bezaar stone preferreth it before all other medicines, as wel simples as compoundes, which haue vertue against venom or of venomous beastes: and sayeth, that hee sawe it and prooued it by great experience.
Amato Lucitano a learned man of our tyme, being now resident in Ragosa in his commentaries which hee wrote vppon Dioscorides in the seconde booke of Ceruigenitale did treate of this Bezaar stone very learnedly, as a man of Portingal who did much enforme himselfe of those of his nation that came from the East India, and he sayeth that the Bezaar stone is of the making of an acorne, full of spottes, declining to the colour of a sad blewe, compounded with many shales, the which they call Bezaar as a present remedie against al maner of venom, and they take them out of certaine beastes which are lyke to wilde hartes, that are in the East India, and are called goates of the mountaines: they are founde in their bowelles and inner partes, of the which being giue~
graynes with the waters of the flowers of Orenges, it is the present remedy against all Uenom, killing and extinguishing, the venomes, and force thereof, it killeth the wormes giue~ with water of Verdolagas where the feuer is, and where there is no feuer with whyte wine: he saieth that he hath experience, and hath cured therewith the being very sore rooted, it is conuenient that it be giuen to them, that haue taken venom, in vomittes, and it wil expel the venom, and being giuen to them that haue vomitted of beastes speaking of the goate, doeth much commend this Bezaar stone to be against al veno~.
Other authors there be that make mention of this stone, but they passe it lightly ouer, only praysing it to be good against venom, in generall and in particular, the which at this present lightly passe ouer, for it is sufficiently spoken of by those before rehearsed, wherby it may haue authoritie with al those that therof wil profite themselues.
That which haue seene by experience wil now speake of for the more confirmation of the sayde cause, and of the meruellous vertues which it hath, wherby it may bee vnderstoode what is written by these authors aforesayd, with manifest examples.
yeres past that my Lady the Duches of was aduertised by the Lorde don Iohn Mauriques that in the Court was vsed for such as did sound, a stone that was called the Bezaar for that my Lady the Duches had a sonne very sicke of the sayde disease, wel neere since the tyme of his byrth, and shee beeing desirous of his health did procure to know what remedy might be had, and seeing the ordinary remedies of Phisicke which they had ministred vnto him beeing many and diuers by the wysest Phisitions of Spayne, and yet not preuailed any thing; and hearing of the greate vertue of this Bezaar stone, they had communication with mee thereof: yet was it to mee somewhat straunge, for that had no other knowledge thereof then by bookes, and thought that it had not beene in these partes: then requested that the stone might be sent for being desirous to ease this Lorde, for his vertues deserued the same, and his great knowledge in al kinde of learning, and in al things that a noble man might haue knowledge in, as also to see the stone which was a thing of mee much desired.
The stone was sent for to Lishebron by meanes of a Genoues, and there was brought twoo of them very fayre wrought in gold, and eche of them as great as a Date stone and somewhat greater, of colour greene and blackishe, lyke to a Beringena which is a fruit of Spayne, and the stone being brought, not a little to our contentment, euery one gaue their iudgement, it was agreed yt at such time as he should sownde, it shoulde presently be giuen him: and the sownding being come in the euening hee toke foorth with the appointed order, which was brought from the court, that hee should take foorthwith the waight of three graines of the pouder of the stone, and it should bee cast in water of Oxetongue so much as might be sufficient for him, and so it was done.
Opening his mouth hee swallowed it downe, the which he did with much difficultie; within the space of halfe a quarter of an houre, after hee had taken it, hee recouered as easilie, as though hee had not had it.
And seeing the vertue that was in the stone, wee did esteeme it much, and the more for that wee sawe that euery tyme it toke him, he came to himselfe so easily, and when he toke not the stone, the sounding did continue long, and hee returned from it with greate paynes, and in long tyme it seased not: but when the stone was giuen him he came quickly to himselfe and with greate easinesse, as though he had not had any sownding at all.
My Lady the Duches caried the stone in her purse, and had the quantitie that he shoulde take alwayes in a readinesse, bycause when the sownding came to him, it might bee giuen him with more speede, bycause hee shoulde not bee long in payne: so that from the tyme that hee receyued it, his soundings came not to him so continually as they did before.
This being perceiued, saide one day to my Lady, that it was the doctrine of Phisitions, that the medicines which doe not heale diseases, cannot preserue that wee fall not into them, but that it seemed good to mee that wee shoulde giue vnto him euery morning the pouder of the Bezaar stone, that with the continuall vse thereof, the vapour might bee consumed which did ryse vp to the braynes, so that what seemeth to be venomous and hurtfull, the stone woulde extinguish and kil, and would consume the vapour that riseth vp fro~ all the body, and from pages missing] Childe did eate a certaine venomous thing, whereby hee was in danger of death, and seing that the common remedies did not profit, caused to bee giuen to the childe the Bezaar stone, and immediatly it was well.
And for children that haue wormes, it is lykewyse very good, for that it causeth them to be expelled by dissolution, meruellously taking away the accidents, that are wont to happen to childre~.
And this it worketh wheresoeuer you feare any griefe or venomous humour.
In the thinges that it hath done most good, hath bene in the pestilence, for that there was in Germany a greate Plague, and vnto all such as had the Bezaar stone giuen them, immediatly was seene the greate effect that it did in them that toke it.
And in an Hospital were foure persons infected with this euill, and it was giuen to twoo of them and not to the other, and they that tooke it escaped, and the other twoo dyed.
And then it was giuen to many that were infected with this euill, and some of them had twoo sores, and some had three, and yet they escaped and of this were witnesses many people of greate credit that sawe it and other meaner persons, as it is very well knowne to all the Court.
This stone doeth profit much to them that be sad and melancholike, the Emperour toke it many tymes for this effect, and it is taken of many persons that are melancholike: for it taketh it away, and maketh him glad and mery that vseth it and to bee of a good disposition.
Many haue seene that haue beene much diseased with fayntnesse, soundinges and melancholie, and taking the waight of three graynes of this stone with the water of Oxtongue they haue bin healed presently.
In feuers of an euill qualitie and most pestilent, it is meruellous the good woorke that it doeth: for that it taketh away the malice thereof, extinguishing and killing the euil qualitie of the venom, which is the first and principall thing that the Phisition should doe, for if that this bee not taken away first, the cure is in vaine.
Many do vse this stone holding a peece thereof in theyr mouth in the suspected time of a Pestilence, and whereas venom is feared, or any thing that is venomous, and also it dooth profite much taking it in water to them that are sicke of pestilent Feuers.
Gentleman had all his seruantes sicke of Agewes, that are commonly called Modorras and he put into a pot of water a Bezaar stone that hee had, of the which he caused the sicke people to drinke, and they all escaped and were deliuered from death.
And many people for this cause, haue this stone layde in water continually, that they may drinke thereof being sicke, for it profiteth much to take away the Agewe, and geueth strength to the hart, and not onely this stone doth profite in venomous thinges and venomes, but in other diseases, as it hath byn proued: being geuen to them that haue the gidines in the head, it doth much profit, and also against opilations.
And it happened that a Nunne that had sowndinges and greate opilations, by taking the Bezaar stone was healed, and likewise of the opilations: and being long time without her customed termes, they came very well too her and aboundantly.
This stone profiteth much to them that haue taken Arsenike or other corsiue venome, for that it dooth kill and consume the force of the venome, and taketh away the accidentes thereof.
Milke hath in this a great prerogatiue, and doth woorke effectually, by taking much quantitie, and continually vsing the same, for although that it be a meruellous remedie, it must be vsed in corsiue venomes, for that it maketh the venomes to be expelled by vomit, and doth extinguish the mallice.
It is the true Antidote against corsiue venome, and after the vse thereof, the stone may be giuen or the pouder, or any of the sayde medicines, that haue vertue against venome.
Also this stone doth profit muche against feuers that bringe certaine red spots in the bodie like to that commonly doe appeare in their shoulders, and in their archter parts of the bodie: these doe come in sore Agewes, that doe expell the humours out of the bodie, and so it is conuenient that it bee so vsed that it may come out well, and this muste bee done by putting and other like helpes, that may expell the humour, whereby nature is holpen, forbidding oyntmentes and other things that may disturbe the comming out of these thinges.
An other thing which is conuenient, is to geue to the sicke, when these small spottes doe beginne to appeare, those thinges which doe extinguish and kill the venome: of the which we haue treated very largely hauing respect not to let blood, after that they haue appeared, if it come not of too muche replection and fulnesse of blood.
One thing haue founde for these redde Spottes and for Feuers of muche profite and notable experience in many, which is our Bolearmenike prepared in a dishe of earth with Rose water geuen in all medicines that are too bee taken, and in the meates that are too bee eaten, and surely in it haue founde great effect, chiefly in one yeere, wherein reygned many Pestilent Agues, called and many were deliuered from them, with the vse of it, for that this our Bolearmenike doth differ little from that of the East partes, and this shall bee where the Bezaar stone is not to bee had, for that it doth exceed all as saw in a principall Gentleman of this citie which had a sore Feuer, with soundinges, Uomites and other Accidentes of an Ague vpon whom did appeare spottes, which before haue spoken of on his shoulders, and in geuing him the Bezaar stone with a little of the Ucornes horne, foorthwith the Accidentes did cease and began to be better, for that it did extinguishe and kill the force of the Agewe, which caused all the hurte.
And after this sorte coulde speake of many heere in Spayne, that for the space of this fourteene yeeres haue vsed it, and many haue beene deliuered therewith from many diseases with the vse thereof, that surely it seemeth a thing of woonderfull effectes, that a stone taken out of the bellie of a beaste like to a wilde Harte or Goate in so little quantitie geuen, shoulde woorke so greate effectes as wee haue written of.
And for that it is already time to treate of the Herbe Escuerçonera because wee haue beene long and treating of the Bezaar stone, will speake what is knowen of it.
THe Herbe Escuerçonera the which wee haue promised to treate of, is an herbe knowen, and found within these thirtie yeeres.
For time hath discouered it too vs as it hath done many other thinges, as wee see which they bring from the West Indias, and they are so many thinges, as wee see euery day, as were neuer seen by those that were before vs, nor yet by vs, as we haue written in a Treatise that we made of these things which doe treate of all the things that they bring from our Indias that doeth serue for the vse of medicine.
So it is that in the Countrie of Cataluina in the Countie of Vrgell in a towne called was the place where herb Escuerçonera was first discouered found out, as al that countrie molested toubled of certaine venomous beastes which are called Escuerços and likewise of many other and although that they are very Uenomous and full of poyson, there are also many in number, as well in the tilled fieldes as amongest trees, and grasse, and especially in the Corne fieldes, in such sort that they are to them in steede of a Plague, and an vncurable mischiefe, by reason that the people cannot labour in their Uines, nor reape their Corne, nor doe their businesse in the fieldes, by meanes that they are so cruelly hurt by them, whose venome and poyson is such, that wheresoeuer they byte, it swelleth foorthwith, with greate paynes, and the swelling riseth vp to the hearte immediatly, and if they be not remedied and suckered foorthwith, they die presently: their Triacle and other benefites which they had, did serue them to little purpose.
And seeyng that in this time this Plague was so without remedie, it fortuned that they brought to that place from Africa a young man Captiue, which did heale them that were bitten with these so venemous beastes, with geuing them to eate of a roote, and the iuyce of an herbe that hee knewe which did them so much good, that it healed the bytinges and poyson very easily.
For the which there came so many people to the Moore, that they did not onely make him free, but also rich, and the young man in all this tyme with all the promises and giftes that they coulde geue and make vnto him, woulde neuer tell them what roote and herbe it was, wherewith he healed so great a Plague.
Two Persons of the Towne beeyng very desirous to knowe the same, by reason it stoode them so muche vppon too knowe what Herbe it was, went after him and dogged him so politikely, that at length they sawe where hee gathered the hearbe and tooke out of the grounde, the rootes thereof.
The Moore beeyng gone, they wente too the place where hee gathered it, and they founde the lacke of the grasse that the Moore had gathered, of the which they tooke out a good quantitie, because there was muche there in that place, and they went therewith too the Towne, and so to the house of the Moore, where they found him taking out the herbe of a Bagge that hee brought it in: and the one herbe and the other beeyng seene, they sawe that it was all one: whereby the Moore coulde not denie but the thing which had beene by himselfe long time hidden, was now discouered, and the herbe that he had gathered and geuen, and that which the other brought were all one.
And from that time forwarde all the people began to know it, and such as had neede of it went to geather it, and vsed it for the bytinges of these venemous beastes, as haue sayde.
They call this herbe Escuerçonera because it doeth heale and remedy the bytinges of this beast, called Estorçu in the Catalan tongue, and the same roote is like too the sayde beast, and the beast like too the roote in figure.
This beast or vermin commonly is a Spanne and a halfe long, hee is small in the tayle, and is greater and greater towardes the heade: his head is greate and square with a great mouth, his tongue blacke and sharpe, his teeth small like to a shee Adder, with the which hee doeth byte, and with his tongue hee doeth pricke like to a Scorpion, his colour is full of blacke spottes, with diuers colours hee goeth euill fauouredly, and is continually among Plantes, and Uines, and byteth other beastes, as hee doeth men, hee goeth continually by the grounde, and therefore all men looke warily too theyr feete, where they are.
Hee is a fierce beast and vglie too beholde, and full of mischiefe, his byting is woorser and more dangerous than the byting of a shee Adder of that Countrie.
Onely this Herbe is contrary too him which is called of his name Escuerçonera: for if they cast the iuyce vppon him, it maketh him fowle, and if they put it into his mouth and that hee swallowe it downe, he dyeth.
If any man pages missing] seede, and the seede beeyng gone, then the Leaues of the Plantes doe fall.
The Roote is like too the roote of a Sanahoria fleshie, and waightie, and leaueth with a poynt, and waxeth greater towardes the leaues, it hath a thinne rynde ioyned too the roote, and is of a russet colour, somewhat blackishe, and somewhat sharpe, and beyng cut or broken, it doeth cast from it a certayne clammie waterishnesse, like to milke: it is all white within, sweete, and fattie, it groweth for the moste parte in hitlie places, where some moisture is: the complection therof is whot and moyst in the first degree.
The Uertues that it hath bee suche as wee haue spoken of, the principall vertue is agaynst the Escorçu a beast so venemous, and doeth so much hurt, that in this surelie it seemeth to bee a thing of great vertue.
It is good when the iuyce is taken out of the leaues and clarified, and that the roote also bee taken, which is a thing of greater vertue.
And it is to be considered that although you take the iuyce and the roote of this Herbe agaynst the Poyson that proceedeth of this beast which is so pernicious, it is conuenient that great diligence be vsed, as we haue aforesayde, for the remedie of them that are venomed: whereby it woulde doe very well that in the meane time that the iuyce bee a prouiding or the Roote of the sayde Herbe, that foure or fiue fingers breadth aboue the sore it bee bounde fast, that the force of the Uenome doe not passe too the reste of the partes of the body, and this is too bee done in the Legge or arme.
And if the byting bee in any suche place where it cannot bee bounde, then there must bee laide too it, plaisters of dry and strong thinges that may dissolue the furie of the venom: and this must be done with speed, before the hurt doe enter the inner partes, for if it once doe come to the harte, the cure will goe harde: and this must bee vniuersally in al prickinges or bytings of venomous beastes.
And if the wound bee smal it is needful to open it, with a smal cut or some other way: and if it be newe, let the cuttinges bee smal, and if it bee of a long tyme, then let the incision bee deepe, for that with the much blood that geeth out thereof, there goe out a greate parte of the venom also.
And after the cutting let there bee applyed such things as may drawe out strongly the venom, still adding thereunto that as shal be needful.
Some there bee that doe sucke out the venom of the prickes or woundes with their mouth, but it is dangerous to them that so doe, for some haue dyed therof: it is better to it with ventosities, or to put too it the hinder parte of a Cocke, or a Chicken, or a Pigeon beeing aliue, vppon the pricke, or the fethers being plucked the part and vse it so often as shal bee needful, vntill perceiue that they haue taken out the venom that is in the wounde, and euery one of them must be applyed thereto so long tyme vntil that you may perceiue that hee doeth waxe faynt, or vntill he bee readie to dye.
Also it is a good remedie to put them that bee a liue opened at the back, and let be there as long time as they haue any heate: and beginning to waxe colde, then take them away put others to, and the venom being taken out by these meanes, let there bee put vpon the a medicine that hath vertue to keepe the wounde open.
Some do vse in the cuttinges or incisions an actuall thing to burne, called a cauterie, which doth very much good, extinguishing the venom, and comforting the hurte.
The same the cawterie potentiall in killing the but it is not so good as the actuall, but thereby it doeth cause that the wounde doe not close, which is very necessary for the cure.
The iuyce of the herbe Escuerçonera doeth profit very much, being put on venomous or prickings, by it selfe or mingled with other medicines, that haue vertue to take away the stre~gth of the venom, as treacle, methridato other medicines like to these: and if the Bezaar stone might be had casting the pouder therof vpo~ the wound, it wil worke a maruellous effect.
While they are in this case they must be kept with good order, good gouernement, in al thinges that are contrary to them, and vsing euacuations, such as is conuenient with wholesome medicines, and there must bee mingled with them medicines that are against venom, and when time serueth vse letting of blood, and in the rest, to goe to the cure of the disease, and vnto euery one of them, as it is conuenient vniuersally, and particularly, hauing alwayes care to giue to them that are sicke, in the morning fasting, the conserua of the roote of the Escuerçonera and his water, or the Bezaar stone, or ye pouder as it is said, or Bolearmenike prepared, hee must haue care to annoynt the harte with things which are temperate, that may comforte with pouders and cordiall waters, amongest the which let there bee put the herbe Escuerçonera
And besides the vertues that the herbe Escuerçonera hath against the bytinges of these beastes in particular, and for the remedie of all in vniuersal, it hath also other particular vertues, the vse whereof hath beene shewed vnto vs, it is very good against sowndinges, of the harte, and for them that haue the falling sicknes, and for women whose matrix are suffocated or stopped, by taking the conserua made of the roote, and drinking the iuyce of the hearbe clarified, or the water of it distilled.
It doeth profit much when the soundinges are come, but much more before they doe come: when they feele that they begin to sownde, let them take the roote therof with the water, and it doeth hinder the comming therof: and if it do come it is much lesse, and it doeth not woorke so vehemently as when it is taken after.
Unto them that haue the gidinesse in the head it doeth good, and being continually taken, it maketh the hart merrie: it doeth take away the sadnes which is the cause therof: the iuyce taken out of the leaues and clarified, and set in Sunne for certaine dayes, taking the cleerest thereof, and put into the eyes doeth clarifie the sight, and taketh away the dimnesse therof, if it be mingled with a litle good hony, it is good for them that feare themselues to bee poysoned.
The conserua of the roote beeing taken, and the water in the morning, that day by Gods grace they shal bee safe.
The vse and experience of this hearbe hath bin taught without any auctor: for to this day we knowe not with what name the authors doe terme it.
Iohn Odoricus Mechiorius an Almayne Phisitio~, doth wryte in an Epistle to Andrew Mathiolo saying that Peter Carniser a Catalan Phisition, sent to him the herbe Escuerçonera dry, into Germany: this Phisition did aske of Mathiolo what herbe it was: Mathiolo did not know what hearbe it was, neither did any other, vntil now that it hath bin spoken or written of.
Some that are curious wil say that it is the Co~drillia a spice of Succory which Dioscorides doth make mention of in the second booke in the
chapter: although that it hath some likenesse therof, it differeth much in the roote: for the Condrillia hath it very wooddie and vnprofitable and very smal, and in the flowers: but they differ not in their vertues, for both of them are good for the bytings of adders.
And whatsoeuer that our Escuerçonera is, wee see that his effectes are greate, as well against the bytinges of the Escuerços which is so euill a beast and venomous, as for other diseases which we haue spoken of: which seeing that in so fewe yeres there hath bene so much thereof discouered, do trust yt much more wil be hereafter by wise men, that there may be added to this which haue discouered and written of it.
And seeing that we haue treated briefly and the best that we can of these twoo medicines so precious, to wit, the Bezaar stone and the hearbe Escuerçonera which are twoo things so precious and of so greate effectes against venom, now haue we to treate of the last parte which wee promised to doe; how we ought to keepe and preserue our selues, not to fal into so greate a danger, as of them is declared, for that it is better to keepe our selues from daunger, the~ to fal therein.
Amongest the rest it hath beene an ancient custome in Princes Courts other greate estates, to haue their tasters as wel of their meate as of their drinke for the eschewing of poyson, and so by the meanes thereof they assure themselues to be out of peril for that matter, the which surely is allowable and a good custome, and necessary for the safegard and health of any Prince or Lorde, for if there be any hurte in the meate or in the drinke, it shal light first the~ that doe eate or drinke thereof, and not vpon the Prince or other high estate, in whose life and health greate matters doe depende.
Trueth it is that in these dayes it is done more for a ceremony and estate, then for health safety of life, this order is vsed amongst great estates, more for custome then for any thing else, for this purpose the common people haue it in estimation, so that at this present it is vsed contrary to that end and purpose it was ment, for they vse nowe taking of a little bred and bringing it with the meate and so taste it: that done, they cast it away, and lykewyse they drinke a drop of wyne or water: if it should be vsed as it ought to bee, they should eate and drinke thereof throughly, for otherwyse the poyson, if there be any, ca~not be discerned before it come in to the Princes mouth.
Also the lord ought to command that there be prepared for him diuers meates, for that if hee mislyke of one, he may tast of another: for being of diuers sorts he may tast of eache a little, and eating little at once of any that were infected, it would doe lesse hurte then if he shoulde eate of one dish being infected filling himself therwithal, for being either of them infected and eating much therof, it shal doe the more hurte.
And note this wel, that many times a ma~ is not giuen alwaies to eate of one meate, nor to see it alwayes tasted before he eate it, and afterwarde there appeareth in it notable hurte, therefore it is good to take your meate with a forke or a spoone, and that they be made as Ierome Montuo a learned man in Phisike had appoynted for king Henry of Fraunce, which was made to knowe if that he had eate~ any venom, there must be made a little forke and a spoone of one mixture of gold and siluer, that the olde wryters called Eletrum and it must bee
partes golde and one of siluer, they must bee smooth, cleane well burnished, with the forke or holder let him eate his meate, and with the spoone his broth: for putting them in the meate or in the broth, if that there bee any venom therein, foorthwith the golde will haue an euil colour, appearing tawnie, blewe, or blacke, and loosing the beautie that before it had, the which wil cause them to looke better to the meate, and this is done for trial therof, and to make further experie~ce by some beast that may eate thereof, and so to see the effect thereof, for that is the greatest experience: the lyke may bee done with the drinke to make a cuppe therof, or a broade vessel well burnished.
For if the wine or water that is put into it, haue any venom, the vessel wil take some colour therof as aforesaide: and if it haue no poyson therein, it will remaine in his owne colour.
And surely it is a gallant and a delicate secrete, when you begin to eate any manner of meate, the first morsell that you take let it be wel chewed, and marke wel if it do byte, or haue any euil taste, or if it burne your mouth, or your to~gue, or that your stomacke abhorre it, for in perceiuing or feeling any thing of these signes, cast it forth, and wash your mouth with wyne or water, and leaue that meate, and fal to other: it woulde doe very wel to giue it to some beast to see the therof, it is good to haue in the house some beast to whome it might giuen, for to make experience thereof.
And the effect so appearing they haue to iudge therof.
And this is to be vnderstoode when the venomes come of corsiue thinges, you shal feele a notable sharpenes, and they byte and burne forthwith: the best is for them that haue suspicion, to eate meate that is rosted or sod, that they eate neither brothes nor pottages, for in them there may be greater hurte: and if any bee made, let them not bee made with things of smell, as Amber, muske, and sweete spyces, and let them not haue ouermuch sharpenes, for in broth or pottage, the poyson wil sooner lurke then in rosted or sodden, and vse no meates, which haue much sweetnesse, therein all poyson will lurke the more.
Hee that hath any suspition when hee goeth to his meate, let him not bee to greedie to eate foorthwith very hastily, but let him refraine himselfe, and let him eate with leasure, by litle and litle.
The lyke he must do, in his drinking, being very thirsty, hee feeleth not what he drinketh: and so many people beeing very dry, haue dronke in lie, lye, and also water of arsenike, not feeling the same vntil they haue hurt their body, and therefore it is conuenient to drinke leysurely by litle, and litle, tasting his drinke as he drinketh: surely if men woulde be ruled by this order, they should easily finde if there were any euil thing in that they eate, and drinke.
You haue to consider the colour of your meate, for thereby will somewhat appeare.
For it wil looke otherwyse, then it ought to see that your vessels wherein you eate or drinke bee cleane, newe, and glistering: and if your abilitie be such, let them bee of siluer, being cleane burnished, for if you haue venom in the drinke, it is easily espied, and the siluer doth turne blacke or tawney.
Not many dayes past a Gentleman of great riches, by drinking in a plaine cuppe of siluer, perceiued the cup stayned of a sad tawney colour, and did maruel thereat, hee only tasted the wyne, and it made his tongue rough, his mouth also: hee looked wel on the wyne that was put into the cup, it had not that quicknes in drinking that it ought to haue had, and hee looked on the water, and in the bottome of the ewre there were many graines of arsenyke, wt as yet were not dissolued.
was called gathered out of the ewre more then xx. smal graines of arsenike. within certain dayes after the Gentleman fell sicke, wherby did that it was not the first tyme that they pretended to poyson him: since that, he hath bin sicke a long time.
And thus much affirme that if the cup had not bin altered of his colour bin infected, it had not bin perceiued.
Therefore it is necessary that the vessels and tinages where wyne water are kept, be stopt, for feare least any venomous thing fall therein, as spyders, Sallamanquesas and other lyke venomous and therefore it is nought to drinke with vessels or cuppes that haue narrow mouths: for it is best to see what one drinketh in a cleere vessel and broade, for it is good for them that do regard their health.
It is good to haue a peece of a right Unicornes horne in a smal cheyne of golde, that it may bee swilled continually in the water that shalbee dronke.
It would doe well, for not onely it taketh away the suspition of the venom, but doeth put to the drinke a meruellous cordiall vertue.
Also you must not stand by the fire that is made with venomous wood, for the smoke doeth poyson, as if you should take poyson, and to set in the chamber coales when they doe begin to kindle, many haue dyed therwith: let your apparell be kept by such as you haue trust in, for in them may bee put things that may do notable hurte, and for al that, as is said, it doeth much profit to haue trustie seruants, and that they bee such whome you may trust, and that they be of a good parentage, and sticke not to reward them wel.
And aboue al other let the Phisition that hath the charge of your health, bee learned and experimented, discrete and of a good iudgeme~t, and that he be riche and of a good kinred, and beeing such a one, he wil not doe any thing that he ought not to doe, seing that in his handes is the life and health of the Mayster and Lorde.
THE DIALOGVE OF YRON, WHICH TREATETH OF THE greatnesse thereof, and howe it is the most excellent metall of all others, and the thing most necessary for the seruice of man; and of the greate Medicinall vertues which it hath.
To the most Excellent Lorde, the Duke of Alcala, &c. my Lorde, the Doctor Monardes your Phisition wisheth health, &c. FOrasmuch as the metall called yron, is of so great importance in the worlde, and so necessary for the seruice of man, it moued me to make this Dialogue, which doeth treate of the greatnesse and maruellous workes thereof.
Which if they be well considered· they will bring admiration vnto all that shall reade them, by reason it is so for all states, and manners of liuing.
It hath also greate and vertues, and likewise with worthinesse, and greatnesse, it is an Instrument and meane, whereby the most worthy haue gotten great Titles, and fame; as we see many of those which in times past haue attayned vnto, among whom the of your excellencie with theyr noble mindes, and strong armes, the in the fist, and the sworde in the hande, by ouercomming battels, by getting townes and places, the name and fame of them haue byn immortall to this day.
And for to augment and increase this the more, and to geue to your excellencie, and to your and successours, glory, you tooke to wise the excellent Duches the Ladie Curtes that at this day the whole worlde, with woorthinesse, qualitie, and daughter to that valiaunt and Prince, Don Curtes who with his and infinite Labours pages missing] is a shorter way, and fewe people will be there.
It seemeth to mee, that the greate hall of the treasurie house is may bee that whiles go vp to see the sicke person, they will open it.
Your worship may go in Gods name, will tarrye here for you, and seeing the great hall is not opened, will sitt downe vppon the benche, and will see what doeth passe vntill you come.
Master Burgus praye you pardon mee, if haue tarryed long: for the qualitie of the cause hath caused mee to tarry.
Rather woulde haue beene glad that you had tarryed longer, because would haue seene more.
The great hall being shutt, and the parde full of people, and looking vppon them earnestly, it seemeth to mee that they are people of estimation, but to my iudgement full of cares: for in them haue seene so variable and diuerse likenesses of countenance, that maruel at it.
Some of them talking to them selues: others being alone with their heads hanging downe, and with great imagination: Others talking by two and two together: Others in clusters treating of the sales of their merchaundize: Maryners and souldiours carrying for their paymentes: Others carrying away their porcions of siluer, which they had taken out, running with it, as though they had stolen it: Others there were with the Notaries about their suites: Others in the office of the treasourer amongest the Registers.
There was also a greate noyse of much people, deliuering and receiuing parcels of siluer, but they were in a great strife therevppon.
The Iudges were in counsell, and many people tarrying for them in such sort, that was in greate admiration: being there onely to beholde, and all the rest to do their businesse.
And it was to mee as one that did beholde them without greefe, as a comedye, with many Pageants.
And that which did make mee maruell more, was to see that none were merrye, nor content: rather they seemed to haue great care and troubles.
Master Burgus am glad you haue seene what doeth passe in that house, with so much attention: for all that which you haue seene, that Gold and siluer is cause thereof, which with so great good will you came to see, and this is it which is the cause of their troubles, and cares, and not onely it bringeth such as you sawe there amazed and astonied, but many others, for they are at this daye the instrument of all these things.
Some they put downe, others they rayse vp, whereby they haue rule, and dominion in the worlde.
These mortall men haue put so much felicitie in them, that they haue and do procure them, by the losse of their lyues, and shedding of their bloud, and after they haue them, they conserue them with much labour, and with greater care keepe them, and with much misery they spend them, and with great euill fortune they lose them.
They take awaye sleape, and many passe the day to keepe them, and to increase their afflictions and cares.
In the night also they rest with feare, and care: there are in them so many snares and hazardes, as wee see euery day.
For all this woulde see the Golde, the siluer, and the Emeraldes.
What? master Burgus haue you neuer seene Golde, siluer, and Emeraldes? Burgus.
What do you thinke is there in seeing of little, or much, but to see much earth, or little earth, and moste of all without the profite of man, of as many as nature hath created? And if you haue so great desire to see precious metals: will carrye you to a place where you shall see one metall much more of price, of greater estimation, then the golde siluer you were so desirous to see, better, of more profit pages missing] beginning, and original.
Trimegisto sayde, that the earth was the mother of the metals, and the heauen the Father.
The inner parte of the earth is a thing most precious, for into it, and through it doe goe, and pearce all the influences of heauen, ingendring therein thinges of greate pryce, as stones and metals: and this is done, as Calcidonio Platonico doeth say, by reason of the greate heate that is in the inner parte of it.
Calisthenes vnderstood that the forme of metals were all one.
Anaxagoras and Hermes sayde, that the metalls had one forme in the inner parte, and an other in the outwarde parte, one secret, and an other manifest, after the manner as the lead hath within it gold, and the gold lead, and so of al the rest of the metals.
See you my maisters howe many and howe variable opinions there are among wise men.
There is another opinion, which is that which is common, and which for the most certayne we doe followe, which Auicen wrote in his bookes of Metheurous and in the bookes hee made of Alcumisto which were confirmed by Geber and Raymond Lullio and Arnolde de Villa noua and all the rest that haue treated of these matters, euen vnto our tyme, doe say, that the true matter of all metals is ingendred of brimstone, and quicksiluer, the brimstone as the father, and the quicksiluer as the mother: and the heat of the brimstone, doeth incorporate, and congele with the quicksiluer, in such sorte that of these twoo thinges are made the metals which are in the bowelles of earth: and of the variation of these twoo beginninges, they come to differ the one from the other, and of the purenesse of these twoo beginnings, some doe come to be more excellent then other: and for this the golde is more profitable more fayre then all other metalles, for bycause it is formed of his beginning, cleane, and pure, which was the cause and originall of his perfection.
And there were Philosophers which said that al metals should haue bin gold, if it had not bin for the imperfection of the sulphur, and the quicksiluer.
And al other metals besides the golde, they call imperfect mineralles, bycause they had not their purenesse, and concoction, that the gold had, with that maruellous friendshippe, which nature gaue vnto it.
And of this it commeth, that the Alcumistes for to make golde, doe pretende to make cleane and purifie these twoo beginninges of the which all the metalles are made, and beeing put into their perfection the golde is made by of them, which is the metall most pure and cleane, of all other.
Thus they woorke with their distillations and limbecks: and howe harde it is to doe, let them report and speake that haue spent their goods, and also their patrimonies therevppon, and yet in the end haue performed nothing at all.
Such as doe wryte against them, making impossible their woorkes and effectes, doe say, that in the bowels of the earth, the metals are not ingendred, nor made of brimstone, and quicksiluer, as they thinke and holde it for certayne, so they cannot make of them by arte, for if it were so, that of brimstone and quicksiluer they were ingendred, there would be some of them, in the mynes of golde, and siluer, and of the other metals: for it is seene that there is no signe or vayne of them in any of those mynes, howe deepe so euer they bee: but rather they are mynes of themselues, as wee see, that neyther in them are founde metalles, nor in the mynes of the metals are sulphur, nor quickesiluer.
And if it were so as they say that the metalles doe breede, and are newly ingendred of these twoo beginnings, it must bee of force, that one metall were alreadie made, and the other shoulde goe a making, for that all coulde not bee made alyke: but rather they take out all metalles ready made, and perfectioned, and in the meltinges pages missing] the Iron doeth fall downe into the lowest parte, and so is made a great cake, the which being deuided into peeces, they carry them to the forge, where are certeine great hammers or sledges of Iron which the water dryueth, and they beate them, and there they are forged, and doe make these planches that you see there leaning.
Trueth it is, that there are mynes where some Iron is more strong then other some, and likewise harder and stronger to labour.
The Iron of Almayne is softer and gentler to worke: That of Flaunders is harde and naught: and therefore it is that manye things are soone broken that are made of it.
In Italy you haue all sortes, that of Biskey is the best, by reason it is good to worke, and it is more mightie and strong then all other, and for the goodnesse it hath, it is carryed to all partes.
Do they bring Steele from Biskey as they do from Italy? Ortun~o
They do bring a certeine kinde of Iron so harde and strong, that being wrought, it serueth for Steele, cheefely with a temperature that is giuen to it, that doeth make it very strong, although that it be wrought with great labour.
There is great difference betweene this, and Steele which they bring from Italy and cheefely from Milan for this is verye pleasant to worke and softe, and is farre better, and the craftes men that doe worke it, for this cause are desirous of it, and do vse it more then any other.
Some will say, that the Steele is a myne of it selfe distant fro~ the
It is not so, all are mynes of Iron, but that some is more strong then other some, and the stronger and harder it is, for the strength and thereof wee call it Steele, and there are countries which haue no other Iron but this which is harde and strong, as all the countrey of Mondragon where all the that are in it, are of this Iron, strong, harde, whereby it is called Steele, all that is taken out of them, the disposition of the place doeth cause it, but that which they bring from Italy is of another sorte.
In that countrie are diuers mynes of yron, some of soft yron easie to woorke, and other of hard strong yron, not easie to worke.
And for to make the steele which they sende vs, they vse it in this sorte: they take of the soft yron, the quantitie they seeme good, and they make it in aine small thinne planches, then they take marble ground small, and also the rust of the yron grounde smal, and mingling it al togither, they put it into a furnace to prepared for this purpose, with much quantitie of kindled coale, they cast al together into it, geueth it a strong fire, and after they cast to it some of that hard Iron that is so hard, that it cannot bee wrought, and with a strong fire it is al melt, and they make it one peece, of the which they make these barres of steele, that bring to these partes, in so great quantitie the which they call by reason it is hard to woorke, and strong, in Latin it is called Chalibs by reason of certain smal townes yt were so called, whereas was yron most strong: harde.
The steele serueth for many things, bicause it is of greater might, and stronger then the yron, and of more actiuitie, and they make strong fortifie the tooles of yron with it, to endure the longer, and may doe their work more quickly, with more strength readines, for that it is an yron more pure and cleane, and for this cause it is more dry, and white, and better to be wrought: this is to conclude that which haue vnderstoode of the originall of yron, and of steele.
D. Maister Ortun~o hath sayde very well, and not in short speeche, but wisely, and discretly.
metalles. for haue vnderstood that they serue for many things.
Ortu~no they which doe buy yron of mee, are many; but they which doe worke it, are many more, for doe not know any office or science in all this citie whereto yron and steele are not needful, necessary.
would be glad yt you would tel vs in what occupations, principally yron is vsed spent.
They are so many, that in many dayes they wil not bee declared, much lesse in the little tyme that wee haue here.
Let vs be informed as long as time wil permit.
One of the thinges in the which yron is most spent, as also a greate parte of the steele, is in armour, as wel defensiue, as offensiue, so that there is no at this day in the world where they are not vsed, and exercised, and in many Countries they are made.
Chiefly there is spent much yron in making of handgunnes, the vse whereof is so much in the warres, and warlyke exercises, that the people of greatest fame and actiuitie, are they which shoote in them: as a thing very principal, and most necessary: but surely it was an inuention of the Deuill, for to carrie many to hell.
And to speake of all kinde of weapons which are made of yron and steele, it wil aske a longer tyme, then we haue.
The yron doeth profite for the tilling of the earth, and labouring of the fieldes, and for the benefites of all the woorkes in the Countrie, to sowe, and doe other woorkes, a thing so necessarie and profitable for all people, seeing that the woorkes of the fieldes doeth susteine all manner of estates, in the worlde.
The yron serueth to make buildinges, so many sortes, and diuers, that therewith they builde Cities, Townes, Uillages, Forts, Churches, and publike places, the which without yron and steele coulde not be made, as also in the sciences of any manner of handycrafts man, in the which there are so many necessary instruments, for to vse, and exercise, that therby you may see howe necessary the yron and steele is, seeing that without the~ they cannot be made, nor any thing can bee wrought.
And to expresse euery office, and science by it selfe, that by meanes of these twoo metalles are made and exercised, it will neuer bee made an ende of.
One thing wil speake with trueth, that there is nothing in the worlde, bee it by it selfe alone or with the helpe of another thing, that hath not need of yron and steele.
By meanes of these two metals, kinges princes do get kingdomes, and cities, by meanes of them they do make subiect their enimies, and do defende their goods and persons.
And as Liuio sayth, that with Iron the countrie is defended, and not with golde, and with it kings are made strong and mightie, and are esteemed and had in great reuerence.
By Iron iustice is kept and maintayned, and by the meanes of it, euill doers are chastened, and the good conserned.
This mettall hath so much authoritie in the world, that it conserueth peace and quietnesse in common wealthes, in cities, in feeldes, and in the desertes, in such sort that by in all places they haue all their assurance, and defence: and so much may be sayde of that which it can doe, and the great aucthority that it hath, and the meane that it is for al things, that my tongue is not able to speake them, nor my memory to expresse them.
One thing will say, that the Romaines had by it such estimation, that onely the noble people onely might weare a ring, the same to be of Iron.
Of two needles which are made of steele wil speake, as of the greatest thinges that may be thought: the one is the Needle with the which they do sowe: howe necessary it is in the world, in cities, in townes, in common wealthes, in particular houses, in the feeld, in the Sea, in al places, yea and to anye one particular man alone? And let so manye Artes speake thereof, that by meanes of the Needle are vsed, and don, and without it, they should not be vsed nor don: and being so many, it will be a thing incomprehensible to speake of them.
Let euery man consider thereof, seeing that from the king vnto the sheepeheard, and from the bishop to the sexton, they cannot passe without the vse of it.
And if we looke what seruice it doeth to women in their vses and in their sowings and workes wrought vpon linen cloth and silke, things so politike, and delicate, that with the Needle they do worke: Imitating also, in things which they worke, like vnto the worke of nature, making birds, plants, leaues, and flowers, which do seeme with the branches, that they giue of silke in coulours, as if it were the self same that is growing in the feelde.
sawe the picture of the kings maiestie made with a needle so naturally, as if an excellent painter had paynted it.
Of all this the needle is the instrument: a thing so small that it is hid among the fingers.
The Indians were in great admiration thereof at the beginning, when they were first discouered, when they sawe Spanyards sowe with a Needle, for it seemed to them a thing of wonder, and they gaue for a Needle much golde, and they were wherefore they would haue them, seeing that they were naked: they aunswered, for the workes that the Spanyardes did with them, they would haue them in their power for a thing of admiration.
And with them they tooke out the thornes that can into their feete, better then with any other thing.
The other Needle is that which serueth for Nauigation to sayle withall in the Sea, and is one of the greatest things that hath beene discouered in the whole worlde, within this little tyme: and by meanes thereof, there haue beene found newe worldes, great kingdomes, and prouinces, neuer seene nor knowen vnto vs.
And if the Needle had not bene found, they had neuer bin discouered.
When they wanted it, the nauigation was very little, and short: they fayled onely casting about by the bankes of the Sea coastes: and nowe by the meanes of it, they do ingulfe them selues, and do sayle in such sort, that the shippe called the Uictorie sayled all the rounde worlde ouer, as the Sunne goeth euerye day, that it is sayde, shee sayled at one time twelue thousande leagues.
And that which is more to be maruelled at, that the shippe being in a gulffe of
leagues, by meanes of the Needle they came to the porte which they prete~ded to go vnto, without any other knowledge, more the~ by the meanes of the Needle, or as we cal it the compasse, the which is of steele: and they do ouer one parte of it with the lode stone, and forthwith by particular vertue which God hath giuen vnto it by that parte which they did rubbe ouer with the lode stone, it looketh towardes the Pole, which is neare to the North, and perpetually it doeth this being in the Sea, or on the land, eyther by the day, or by the night, with the Sunne or without it, alwayes it looketh towardes the North.
With the which Needle, and with the carde of Nauigation, wherein is placed a for the knowledge of the wyndes, and the description of the portes, they sayle so many milleons of leagues, as at this day wee see: and it is done so easily, that it is very wonderfull.
The inue~tion of this maruelous Needle was founde by a Marriner, who was borne in the citie of Italy
Also the Iron Steele do serue to make clockes, which is a thing of greate art, very necessary to liue wt rule order: for by them shall be knowe~ the works that are to be made, the time that shal be spent in them, they serue for all states of people, whereby they may liue wisely where is no clocke they liue like beasts.
they are made at day with so much art curiousnesse, that they make great admiration, they purifie and make cleane these two metals, that they make them as bright as any other: they gyld them, they siluer them, there is giuen to them other are made very fayre, as we see that there are made cheynes Steele very delicate and fyne: and there are giuen to dyuse coulours, and are more esemed then those which are made of Golde or metals we of Alcumiste: and is of them Quinta as of Golde and too saye, the metall moe and efctes, is the Iron.
The Iron doeth suffer a disease, consume and make an ende of it, is rust, and because it may not come to it, there are many remedies, that the things which are made of Iron, and of Steele may be continually cleane: principally, that they bee put into no moyst place, and that they be occupyed and vsed, gilding them or siluering them: in so doing they be kepte cleane from the aforesayde rust, or annoynting them with common oyle, or with the marrowe of a Deare, or with the fatt of birdes, or with white lead and vineger, when they are taken with the rust, for to take it away, they must be filed of, and put into vineger, and after into the fire, for with this it is taken away, vnlesse when they be so much eaten, that they are not to be remedyed with these benefites.
doe not speake of the finesse and delicatenesse that there is in sodering of it, and closing of it together, and of the vsing of it in the forge, because am wery let it passe, with many other things that should say thereof, and do conclude, that these two things, Iron and Steele are the moste necessarye things for the seruice of ma~, of as many as are in the world.
am very glad with that which master Ortun~o hath spoken: for all is to confirme the excellencies, greatnesse which haue vnderstoode of these two mettales, wherby do take them to be more necessarye then the golde and siluer, if we do consider well of it.
The golde doth not serue vs principally for any other thing, but for money, which is to buy any thing therewith, and for the trade of things, the which any other metall might serue, or any other thing.
For in the olde tyme as there was no money, they did barter and change one thing for another: and by reason in this bartering and changing there could not be vsed any equalitie and iustification betweene parties; the wise and discreete men of common wealthes did agree together to make a thing, which might serue the lacke that might be of the one partye to the other, that with it the thinges might be made equall, and there might be a iustification of both partes.
And for this reason and effect, there was inuented and made the first mony, which was neither of golde nor siluer, but of yron, and of metall, as wee see in the mony of old tyme.
And after that, the Romaynes made it of golde and siluer, for the fayrnesse thereof, but it is sufficient that the firste which was made, was of yron and of metall, seeing that the Indians haue it to this day, of fruites of trees, and especially of the Cacao which is the fruite of a tree, lyke to an Almond, this hath serued, and doeth serue them for money, to buy, and to sell, and to vse all playnesse, in their buzinesse.
And in all Ginea the blacke people called Negros doe vse for money, for the same effect, certayne little snayles, which they finde in the Sea, as also other nations doe vse of thinges lyke to this.
haue helde my peace, harkening to your woorshippes, with greate attention, and surely you haue treated in thinges of greate importance, and of greate learning: and seeing you goe treating so effectually the matter of yron, and so delicately, and with so greate learning, woulde that Maister Doctor might satisfie vs one thing, that haue seene decyded of learned men, vppon the complection of yron: for some doe say it is colde, and vppon this haue had so many alterations, that they haue amased me, and seeing that Mayster Doctor can certifie vs concerning this matter, wee shall take greate pleasure, if that hee will declare it vnto vs. D.
thought to haue made an ende with this saying, and that had accomplished my promise with Maister Burgus but nowe hee will dryue mee to a question, the most harde and difficulte that is in al Phisicke, and surely it were neede of more tyme, then that wee haue to determine it.
Your woorship may not escape by that meanes, for to morrowe you may make an ende of that, which you cannot doe this day.
shal receiue great pleasure in it, although it bee not my profession: for beeing a thing touching yron, shal reioyce therein.
And that wee may more apparantly see the same, will speake of such that holde the one opinion, and also of those that are of the other, and the parties being heard, wee will iudge that which shall seeme best vnto vs.
Let vs speak first of those that affirme Iron to be colde, and let Galen be the first, who doeth saye that all those metals of their nature are drye, and so they haue great vertue, and strength, to drye vp, and that that hath moste vertue strength to doe this all of them, is the Iron, as also with this vertue to drye vp: it hath also vertue to make colde.
He doeth compare it to the stone, saying that the substance of the stone is constant, and stedfast, for the colde, and dryeth that it hath: Euen so is the Iron, in such sorte that it hath the nature of the stone, the which is colde and drye.
And this which hee sayeth in the nynth of his Methodo hee doeth confirme in that of the naturall faculties.
The harde bodies do shewe to more earthly partes, and as the Iron is most harde, it hath more then all other thinges, whereby it commeth to be colde and drye.
Aueroyes doeth confirme the same in the fifth of his and sayeth: things which are made harde of heate, with the dominion of earthly partes ought to be colde, and drye, as the Iron is.
Alberto Magno in the booke of the Metheuros sayeth: the Iron when it is kindled maketh it selfe very reade, for because in his principall qualitie it hath earthly partes, the same hee doth confirme in the which he made of metals.
sayeth: in the Iron is not founde that vertue which is expressely actiue, but in the ende it is colde and drye.
Gentill in the same question which he made de Actuatione medicinarum sayeth, that the Iron is colde and drye.
Iacobus de partibus vpon the second of the first, sayth that the yron is colde and dry.
Wee do see that the waters which haue quenched hot yron or steele, are colde and dry.
Auicen in the seconde of the first, sayeth that they doe restrayne the colour, and take away dryeth, and the heat, chiefly in time of very hot weather.
And following after this, Menardo saith, that the water which hath cooled hot steele is colde, seing that it taketh away the drieth, and doth mittigate the heate, in tyme of hot weather: and the drieth being taken away, causeth that the putrefaction of the feuers do cease, and where they are with stooles, it maketh an excellent woorke.
Albucasis in the booke which hee made of cering instrumentes sayeth, that those instrumentes wherewith the head shoulde be cered, ought to be of golde, bicause it is most temperate: that in no manner of wyse they be of yron, bycause the yron is colde of nature.
Brasauola in his booke of the Frenche disease sayeth, that the yron is colde and dry, which as he sayeth doth shewe wel in his colour and manner of substance, and in the darkenes and waight it hath, for these thinges doe alwaies appeare, and come into earthly substance, as that which is light in to hot, and ayery substance, which is knowen to bee colde and dry for his effectes, seeing that it taketh away, and doeth represse the cholerike stooles, it withholdeth the fluxe, and hot runnings.
Sanauarola putteth the degrees of the coldnes, which the yron hath, and sayeth; that it is colde in the seconde degree, and dry in the third.
B. Maister Doctor pray you to passe forwarde: for vnto mee, that which is spoken, is sufficient, for haue no doubt therof, but that the yron is colde and dry, and alwayes haue vnderstood it to be so, and now with the confirmation of such authors, holde it for more certaine and firme.
D. Maister Burgus hath very quickly pages missing] and determination of this controuersie.
We haue sayde with the opinion of Auicen and the rest of the authors, that al metals are made of sulfur and quicksiluer, the sulfur as the father, and the quicksiluer as the mother, the one as the maker, and the other as the matter, and being so, the matter whereof the yron is made, is of these twoo things, and of these twoo beginninges, of the most hot sulfur, and of the most colde quicksiluer.
The which nature hath placed in the inner partes of the earth, and made them metals, and where there was these twoo beginninges, most pure, it was made golde, and lykewyse of that which was grosse and vnpure, according to the degree and qualitie of euery one, there was ingendred and made the metal, conformably to the purenesse, or grosnesse that it had: and where these metals are more vnpure, more grosse, and more darke, the yron did ingender.
The which being of beginnings not pure nor cleane, but grosse and filthy, became to be a metall, more harde then al other metals, so that by meanes of it strength, there might bee some who might make it easie and subiect to bee wrought, as also it might bee a necessary instrument that thereof men might profite themselues.
And whereas the yron is made and ingendred of these twoo beginnings, which are, sulfur and quicksiluer, the one hot, and the other colde: so it hath the complection, and temperature, and doeth participate of both qualities: therfore it is so dry, and for this cause hard and strong.
By meanes of the sulfur it heateth, it consumeth, it dryeth, it openeth, it comforteth, it prouoketh appetite, and maketh the meruellous woorkes that we will speake of heereafter, and al is done by meanes of the heate which it hath.
And by meanes of the quicksiluer, being grosse and vnpure, and being formed with earthly vertue, wherewith it is mingled, it cooleth, it retayneth, it thickeneth, it congeleth, it withdraweth, and detayneth any maner of fluxe, or runninges by binding, it taketh away stooles, it cooleth and tempereth the heate, and it doeth many other effects, which are all done by meanes of the coldnes that it hath, in such sorte yt as by the aforesaide is seene, the effects are contrarie which the yron doth: the cause wherof is by reason it is compounded of things that haue contrary qualities, which are rooted in it, and do worke conformably to the subiect where they doe worke.
For where it is need to open, it openeth; and where it is neede to shut, it shutteth.
Trueth it is, that besides these qualities, the yron hath an other most principal, which is, that it is most dry, more then all other metals, by meanes whereof it doeth many of these effectes and workes, which wee haue spoken of, and also it hath vertue to heate, to coole, and to dry vp.
And of this it commeth, that some doe say it is hot, bycause they see that it maketh workes of heate, and others saie that it is colde, bycause they see that it doeth workes to make colde, the reason whereof is, that it is compounded of twoo contrarie beginninges, the one hot, and the other colde, and thereby it seemeth that they may very wel defend themselues, who sayde that yron is colde, and worketh cold effectes: And lykewyse they that sayde, it was hot, and doth hot effects.
Whereby it doth appeare that which the one and the other haue spoke~ and treated therof, to be true.
B. Maister Doctor hath very wel ended the controuersie, and contrariety that is in this matter discretly and wisely, wherby wee are satisfied: but there remayneth a doubt, if the quicksiluer bee colde, as he sayeth that some doe say that it is, and to prooue it, they say that it sheweth by his strength, colour, and taste, and the effectes which it doeth, to make colde, seeing that such as doe vse of it, it maketh impotent, they suffer weakenesse, and trembling of sinewes, and are vtterly voyde of the vse of their members, and many dye all togither of a disease called Apoplexie, and all this doeth come of cold causes.
They which say that the quicksiluer is hot, doe prooue it with his effectes, for anoynting the iointes, and other partes, of the body therwith, it maketh great workes, and effects of heat, it inflameth their mouth, and throte, their gummes, rooffe of their mouth, with great heat, and burning: it prouoketh sweat most vehement: we see that therof is made that most strong thing like to fire, that is called Sublimatum which is most strong fire, and burneth wheresoeuer it bee put, and all that it taketh, it consumeth, and fiereth.
Of it is made that corsiue poyson, called pouder Precipitatos in such sorte that the cause is doubtful, seeing it hath and doeth the workes so contrary to make colde, and to make hot.
The same doubt we haue of it, as of the yron, and what is that which Maister Burgus wil now haue? B.
Now that you brought vs out of the first doubte, we pray you that you wil bring vs out of the second.
It semeth vnto me that Maister Burgus doth take the matter so earnestly that must needs do it, bicause meane to content him, in al things, it shal bee done very quickly: the euening commeth vpon vs.
The quicksiluer is a metal co~pounded of diuers parts, the watery parts that it hath, are mingled with earthy things, which is that giueth it substance and strength.
It hath also mingled with it fulfery parts, which seemeth to be very bright: for in chafing the quicksiluer betweene the hands, there remaineth in them the perfit smel of brimstone, so the quicksiluer of diuers things.
The watery earthy parts giueth it vertue to make colde: by meanes whereof is done the vertue which we haue spoken of, and by meanes of the sulfure which hath ayery parts, it heateth, penetrateth, openeth and maketh thin, and by them it prouoketh sweat, it causeth to expel by the mouth, and by stooles the humour that doeth abounde, by hearing and doing other effectes of heate.
And therfore it is not to be maruelled that the quicksiluer doth contrary effects, seing it hath diuers operations, which is the selfesame that we haue spoken of the yron, and so the doubt remaineth discouered which was propou~ded by M. Burgus.
remaine sufficiently satisfied of that which is saide, but not so satisfied that there doeth not remaine for me to aske of M. Doctor another thing, which is of more weight then all that is saide: which is, to knowe the vertues that the yron and steele haue in the vse of medicine: for their works, and effects, as haue hard it reported, are many.
It wilbe a trouble for me to recken, and tel of so many ancient authors as also of late written authors, which doe treate of the vertues of yron, and of the steele, by reason they are many, and doe treat of great things.
And seing that it shalbe declared, let vs loose no tyme, wherby we may the rather make an ende.
By that which is sayde, you haue vnderstood howe the yron, and steele, are one kinde of metall, sauing that the steele is more cleane yron, and more fine, for this cause it is hard and strong.
They of old tyme knewe not the steele, but onely treated of the yron, and to it they attributed the medicinal vertues that wee will speake of, and vnder our talke of yron, we wil comprise the steele, seeing that it differeth not from it, in more then in being purer, cleaner from superfluities: and for this cause the steele doth make cold, and dryeth more then the yron.
For where it is needful to heate and to open, the yron hath more force, bycause it is not cleane of the sulpherie partes, for there is lost much thereof, when the steele is made in the forme as it is aboue sayde.
It is needful before we proceed forwarde, whereby wee may the better treate of the vertue of yron, that wee vnderstand how it ought to be prepared.
For if it be not prepared, neither can it be administred, nor yet wil it worke it bycause is a hard metal and strong.
And seeing that wee haue M. Burgus here, who in his arte is one of the excellentest men of al Spain, he may declare vnto vs how it may bee vsed, and prepared, bicause wee may goe forwarde in this matter.
haue receiued great pleasure with as haue hearde treated of yron, and of steele, and thought that wee shoulde haue made an ende, and not treated any longer of them: but seeing that it seemeth good to Maier Doctor, that shoulde speake of the preparing of these will doe it, bycause woulde say some thing as well for my parte.
But if Maister Doctor woulde take paynes, hee might speake thereof, as wel as most men that are in the world, seeing he knoweth it, and that there is nothing in medicine hidden vnto him, but seeing that wee haue of him a good Censor if any thing doe lacke, he may speake and supply it.
The metalles if they bee not corrected and prepared euery one, as it is conuenient for them, cannot serue in medicine, nor worke the effects and vertues, which they haue in them, bycause they are grosse of substance, and strong.
The Alcumistes haue knowen and do knowe much in correcting and preparing of them, seeing that wee see they vse the golde and the siluer, in broths, that they may be and doe reduce them into pouders, as also they do the like with the lead and copper, and of other minerals and which they doe correct and prepare, for to make them into pouders, that they may serue in medicyne.
They doe correct and prepare particularly the yron for this effect, but with greate difference, from all other metalles, as Bulcasis sheweth very learnedly, being a and a Moore, who in particular doth shew the manner which ought to bee had, for to prepare the yron, and hee sayeth in this manner, the fyling of the yron which is most pure, must bee taken without other mixture, for if it bee mingled with Copper, or Lead, or Glasse, and if it bee giuen so mingled to any person for to drinke, it wil kill them, you may take the quantity you list, of that which is fyled, being most pure, and let it be and after it is wel washed, let it be put into a cleane vessell.
And let there bee put to it vineger, and put it vnder some thing, so that it bee well couered, let it so remayne thirty dayes, or at the and after that tyme take it foorth, and you shall finde that which is filed of the coullour of Uerdegrece, the which must be and after it is drye, it must be grounde, and being well ground you may vse thereof.
Some there bee that do washe it with fresh water, or with vineger, and do strayne it through a linnen cloth, and then put it vnder a vessell vntil it waxe rotten, and after they it, and keepe it.
That which this Moore doeth say, to be of Aueroyes in the fifth of his gathering, where he setteth downe the preparation thereof in this forme: After the Iron is ground very small, let it be put many tymes in to vineger, or into Gotes milke, when it is cruddye.
And Christopher de honestis following this in the commentaries which he made vpon Mesue sayeth, Let the fyling of the Steele be put into vinegre many dayes, for in any other wise the vse of it will not profite, although that some do put it into milke of Gotes, and some into oyle of sweete Almondes, and in this sort they take it.
It seemeth a harde thing to beleeue, that the Iron or Steele is penetrate, and doth waxe soft with any of these things: onely the strong vinegre is that which doth penetrate and soften it, whereby it may be well grounde, for to vse of it.
And for the more certeintie will shewe howe do prepare it.
do take of Steele the purest and whitest can get, as also Iron, and do cause it to be fyled as small as may be, and when it is so fyled cause it to be washed in water many times, vntill the water do come foorth cleare, and then put it into a cleane glassed vessell, and do cast to it as much strong white vinegre as may be sufficient to wet thorough the sayde fyling, and the being stopped put a close place, do let it stande xx. dayes, stirryng it well twice euery weeke, and putting to it some vineger if it needefull: and after the twentie dayes, when it is well take it out of that, and put it into some other vessell, or vppon a table, that it may dry in the shadowe, and after it is drie, doe grynde it in a morter of metall, sifting it twise through a thicke siue of silke, and so beeing made into Pouder, put it into a fine earthen paynted pot, then with a Pestle beate it small agayne, in suche sort that being taken betweene the fingers, it seemeth not too haue anie maner of substance, neither is it felt between the~.
And if it be not done in this sort they are neuer well for it is a thing that they take most care of, so that therby it may worke the effect the better.
And beyng made into pouder in this sort, it ought to be kept in a glassed vessel.
Some doe wet it with Gumme Dragagaunt and make it in rowles: and it liketh mee very well, because they be the better conserued, and the gumme Dragagant taketh away some parte of their drithe.
And seeing that haue made an ende of the preparing of the steele and Iron, that it doeth the effect when it is as though it were the steele it selfe, let Maister Doctor shewe vnto vs the woorkes and vertues that it doeth.
doe reioyce very much to heare the good order of the preparation, that Maister Burgus hath geuen and set downe to be vsed with these metals.
And seeyng that am bound to declare the vertues and medicinal works which they haue, wil speake of it the best that know, as well that which haue knowen and read, as that which experience hath taught me, and the vse of so many yeeres, These two metalles doe serue in medicine two manner of wayes; the one is, that of them may be made instrumentes to worke with, in causes of Surgery, without the which the Surgions cannot worke their works and effectes, nor the Barbours without them cannot do their occupations.
To declare what instrumentes those are which serue for the one and for the other occupations, it wil be to tedious.
The yron and steele doe serue in medicine with great effectes and maruellous workes, by curing and healing diuers diseases, and so Plinie in his booke of the naturall historie, treting of this matter of yron, after he wrote great things of it, as well in that which doeth profite in the seruice of man, as other curious thinges, hee treateth of and woorkes which it doeth in medicine, shewing first the qualities of it, saying: The yron hath vertue too drie vp, too retayne, and too holde fast, it is good for suche as doe lacke theyr heare, that it may growe, beeyng prepared and mingled with some licour prepared and made for the same purpose, it taketh away the roughnesse of the cheekes, mingled with Uineger: and beyng made in an oyntment with oyle of of Myrtiles, and waxe, it taketh away the blisters of all the vodie: the pouder of it mingled with Uineger, doeth heale the disease called Saint Anthonies fire, as also all maner of skabbes, it healeth the little sores between the nayle and the finger, the pouders therof being applyed thervnto with a linnen cloath.
It healeth also the fluxe of women of what sorte soeuer it be, beyng put therevnto with wooll or with wool, and also if they be applied therevnto after the of a Tent in the lower partes, the pouder beeyng mingled with mirrhe and put to the sores or wounds newe hurte, doeth soder them and healeth them: and beeyng mingled with Uineger and put vpon the it dissolueth them.
It is a great remedy for such as are gowtie, beeyng applyed with thinges made for the purpose vpo~ the griefe: It the blood of such as are wounded, which is for the most part made of Iron.
It is geuen to be drunke to suche as are diseased of the lungs, for it consumeth the disease, and healeth him that is sicke, it stayeth any manner of fluxe the Piles, doeth remedie the soares of them.
It healeth sort cheekes, casting the pouders vpon them it is a great remedy worthy of estimation.
He that doeth cause it to be made doth put it vpon a Playster called Higre the which doeth profite to take away and make cleane the soares, and to take away the Fistula and too eate away the Braunches and too cause that the sores bee filled with fleshe: all this is of Plinie in the Chapter of yron.
Galen in the Booke of Triacle to Piso declareth much the necessitie of yron, for the life of mankinde and for the seruice of man, and doeth account it for a most excellent remedy, for to dry vp the moystures teares of the eyes.
In that of continuall dissolution, he sayeth, that peeces of burning Iro~ cast into milke, by taking away yt waterishnes which the milke hath, is good for ouer much stoles, and especially for the bloody flix.
in the tenth of the simple medicines, he commaundeth that milke be giuen, where in peeces of Iron haue beene quenched, and sayth that such kinde of milke doth good vnto them which haue the bloodye flix.
And in the like case it is better to vse of Iron, then of stones or pebble stones, by reason the Iron doeth leaue more drithe in the milke.
Alexander Traliano adding to this, how milke shoulde be vsed in stooles.
He commau~deth to seeth milke with a quarter part of water, vntill the one halfe be consumed, and in this sort it may be giuen to them which haue the ague with stooles, and it is better in the place of small pebble stones, wherewith they do commaund it to be that there be cast into it small peeces of burning Iron.
Paulo well neare sayeth that which Galen hath sayed, and that the powder of Iron mingled with vinegre profiteth to such as haue matter comming forth of their eares, although that it hath beene of a long continuance.
And also it is a great remedy for such as haue taken that is called Aconito
And forthwith he treateth of the vertues of the water that haue cooled hot Iron, and sayth, that it doeth good to such as do suffer the payne of the belly, and such as haue any cholerike disease, and such as haue hot stomakes, and such as haue the stopping of the lunges.
Dioscorides in the chapter where hee treateth of the rust of yron, saieth, that the water or the wyne, that hath quenched a peece of burning yron, is good for them that haue the fluxe of the stomake, and the bloody fluxe, it desolueth the hardenesse of the lungs, and serueth in cholerike stooles, and in the loosenesse of the stomake.
Accio treating of certaine rowles which are very excellent for the opilations of the inner partes, saieth, that it is a moste conuenient remedie for the Lunges, and inner partes of the Bodie, that the water that hath quenched whotte yron bee taken for a long time: but suche as haue a whotte disease, must vse of the water, and such as are colde if they be weake, of wine that hath quenched yron.
Oribacio sayeth, that the water which hath quenched whot stile, is an excellent remedie for suche as are sicke of the lunges.
Scribonio an auncient Phisition sayth, that the water which hath quenched whot steele, is a greate remedy for such as are swollen, and for suche as haue sores and griefes of the bladder, chiefly if they vse it continually.
Rasis in his Continent treating of yron saieth, the same as Galen doth.
And Paule adding this, the yron doth take away the fluxe beyng ouermuche of the menstruous, and conceauing with child, it healeth the little soares that are betweene the finger and the nayle, it taketh away the Pearle in the eye and the hardnesse of the eye lid, it healeth the piles outwardly, it remedieth rotten gummes, it taketh away the Goute from the feete, and from the handes, it maketh heare growe where it lacketh, although there haue none growne a long time.
The water that hath quenched yron, is good for the fluxe of the bellie, although that it hath beene of a long continuance, and for stooles of blood which doth auoyd from the bodie, and the meate which is eaten and not consumed, and for stooles of blood: it also dissolueth the hardnesse of the lunges, it remedieth the runninges, and weakenesse of the stomake.
And Macerico an auncient Phisition saith, if the pouder of yron be taken with sodden Wine called Cute, it comforteth the weakenesse of the stomake: he taketh for his Authour Mese a Phisition.
And Rasis concludeth the same, saying, say and certifie by great experience, that the yron, doeth profite in the disease of the Piles, and for the fluxe of Urine, and for ouermuche fluxe of the menstrues: this sayeth Rasis
Scrapio reciteth all that Rasis saith, word for worde: and because woulde not say it twice together, let it alone.
Auicen followeth Rasis in all that he hath sayd, adding this followeth to it: The water wherin yron is quenched, maketh strong the inner members by his owne propertie and manifest qualitie: it comforteth the stomake, for the water which doeth quench whot yron, strengtheneth the vertue, and consumeth the superfluities of the stomake, and the superfluous moysture thereof, for those are the things that take away appetite by the loosenesse of the mouth of the stomake, and they are those which extinguish and kill the natural heat: and the yron by reason of the coldnesse and drithe, helpeth the knitting which is made in the mouth of the stomake, wher the appetite is ingendred, it comforteth the Liuer and the rest of the interiour members, it strengtheneth naturall heat, the sinewes and powers of the bodie, and in such sorte it doth geue them strength, and they take such vertue thereby, that they caste from them the opilations: by reason of which causes the Lunges are consumed.
It comforteth the vertue of generation, and this it doeth by consuming the moysture which is that which letteth troubleth naturall heate which is necessary therefore, and if it be not done by his qualitie yet it is done by his accidents.
All this is spoken by Auicen in the second of his first, as also he sayeth in the seconde Canon where hee prayseth the yron greately for Ring wormes, and for swellings, and for the Goute, and mingled with Uineger and put into the eares that of long time haue cast out matter, it healeth them, for the sharpnes of the eye liddes, and to take away a webbe or the whitenesse of the eyes: and hee saieth moreouer that the Wyne which doeth quenche Iron dooth profite for the Apostumations in the Lunges, and for the loosenesse of the stomake, and for the weakenesse thereof, it taketh away the superfluous Flute of the Mother; it drieth the piles it taketh away olde stooles and the blooddie Flixe, it doeth good to such as theyr fundament commeth forth, and to such as theyr water doth auoyd from them, not feeling it, it taketh away the ouermuch Fluxe of the menstrues of women, and comforteth lustinesse in man or woman: all this is taken out of Auicen.
Aliabas in the fifth of his Theorica sayeth, the water that cooleth the yron, doeth detayne the bellie; it hardeneth and comforteth the Members, if you bathe your selfe with it, it doth good too the Paynes and Apostumations of the Lunges.
Albucasis sayeth, that the vse of yron prepared, taketh away the naughtie colour of the yellow face, that is of the colour of Saffron, and the vse thereof doeth make fat, and it shoulde be vsed as the sicke man doeth heale, who being well and whole, doeth waxe fat.
Well neere all that which haue sayde, Alzananio and Isack do say: which doe leaue to relate, because it is shewed already.
B. Haue there been any late writers that haue sayd any thing touching this matter? thinke there be none that considereth howe that the Auncient Writers haue written muche therevppon.
B. it woulde doe well that you woulde so muche pleasure vs, as to shewe who they are, and what they say, seeyng you haue begunne, and that they remayne not vnknowen.
will shewe you, for some of them with care, and particularly, haue written of yron, and the vse thereof, and of the great vertues which it hath, and the like they say of the steele.
Phisition which was a Cardinall called Vitalis de Furno treating of yron in a particular Chapter, saith: the filinges of yron haue vertue to drie vp and to make thin, and therefore it openeth and healeth opilations of the lungs: it healeth the bloodie Fluxe, and anie manner of Fluxe of the Bellie taken in meate or drinke.
The Iron that is quenched manie tymes in Wyne, is good for the stoppinges of the Lunges, and Inner partes, and the milke is good wherein the Steele hath beene quenched.
The yron obeyeth nothing but the Diamont, for it cannot doe more then yron: for it doeth consume it altogeather.
There is no mettall, which doeth receiue so much hurt with the rust as the Iron dooth, and much more if it be cankered with the bloode of mankinde, and also after you haue made it cleane againe if you annoint it with the marrow of the deere called the hart, or with Oyle oliue, or with Uineger mingled with Alom.
Monten~ana in his Counsell a hundreth sixtie one doeth put for a great secrete to kill or quenche fiftie times a peece of steele in strong Uineger and in that Uineger beyng made whot, to wet a course Linnen cloth, and put it vpon the lungs and inner partes that are stopped, many dayes together, Michael Sauanarola in the booke he made of Bathes, doth say, the yron maketh colde and drieth vp, whereby it is bynding, and therefore it doeth deteyne, and the water that killeth or quencheth the yron, hath the sayde vertues, and all the reft that the yron hath, for the water receiueth into it his quatities, and vertues as Galen saith, that the water receiueth the qualities vertues of the thinges that we put into them, or sodde in them, and they doe the same woorkes that the said thinges themselues will doe; the water which killeth or quencheth the yron or steele doeth deteyne, it causeth that the fluxe or runninges doe cease, being put to the ruptures, it doeth sodder them together, and shutteth them, it consumeth the olde matter of the eyes.
The pouder made of yron doeth loose the swollen eye liddes, it taketh away the Rime from the eye, and doeth make fast the gummes that are losse.
When there is a tent made and wet in this pouder prepared and put into the mouth of the Mother, it witholdeth anie maner of fluxe of it: and the loke it doeth by putting it into the fluxe of that commeth from the Piles.
The Wine that quencheth yron or the steele, doeth profit for the hardnesse of the lungs, and the weake stomake and laxatiue, any maner of fluxe, chiefly if it be cholerike, it doeth profit much.
Such as haue the dropsie, and the fluxe of the vryne, and such as haue the menstrues, ouermuch, and such as their water goeth from them without perceiuing thereof, and such as their fundament goeth out: hetherunto Sauanarola hath sayde.
Nicholas Florentine prayseth infinitely steele, for opilations of the inner partes of the body, and lykewise the water of the steele.
Bartholomew Anglicus greatly prayseth the vse of yron, of steele, and saieth, that they are a more excellent medicine, then gold or siluer, for the seruice of a man: for that by them these twoo metalles, that are so greatly esteemed of all men, are kept in safetie, bycause they do defend and sucker them from such as continually doe persecute them.
They defende iustice, they conserue the commonwealthes, by them the euill doers are chastened, and the good are conserued and defended: in all offices of handycraftes they are necessarie: they labour and worke and fieldes with them, whereby wee are maintained, it hath medicinal vertues more then any other metal, for the filing which doeth proceede of it, hath vertue to dry vp, and to make thin.
It vndoeth opilations of the lungs, it taketh away any maner of flux of stooles, although they bee of blood: and it profiteth for many other things.
William of Saliceto in the cure of opilations of the lunges, doeth commande to take the pouder of steele, for to loose opilations, and hee taketh it for a great secrete.
Platerio in the chapter of yron sayeth, the yron and the scales of it, and his rust the steele euery one of them hath the lyke vertue and propertie, taking twoo partes of a of the fyling of yron prepared, as it is conuenient, with hot wyne, it healeth the opilations of the liuer and the lungs, although they be very olde.
Mathew Siluatico saith the same, that the rust and the scales of the yron haue the same vertue that the steele hath, either of them pages missing] were the lade stone it selfe, and al this it doeth by reason of the greate lykenesse and friendshippe which it hath with the yron, together in one with the hidden propertie which it hath therfore.
For this vertue, that it hath to drawe vnto it yron, either it is for the lykenes it hath, or for the propertie, and in this stone ought to bee the one and the other.
The diamond is his enemie, insomuch as it is sayde that in his presence, it draweth not the yron vnto it.
Galen speaketh of greater power that the loade stone hath then the yron, seing that it draweth the yron to him, being of his owne kind, and therfore the ancient wryters do giue it the same vertue, that they giue to the yron, in curing the opilations of the lungs, and other inner partes.
Galen sayth, that the vse therof healeth the dropsie, and doeth euacuate the grosse humors.
Serapio saieth, that being taken with water and hony, it looseth the belly, chiefly grosse humors: many doe prayse it for the dropsie, with water and hony.
vnderstand that the lo stone ought to be prepared in such sorte that may bet vsed, as wee haue saide of the preparing of the yron.
B. Doth your woorship minister any time the rust of yron for haue prepared it by commandement of a Phisition, being a stranger, and geue the pouder thereof vnto such as had opilations: and hee saide to mee, that they did better woorke then the pouders of steele D.
We haue spoken of Plateario and of Mathew Siluatico howe they say that the rust of the yron, and the yron it selfe, and the filing of it, and the steele, haue al one maner of vertue, and therfore the rust of the yron prepared wil profit as much for the said purpose, as the rust doth, and haue vnderstood for to consume and dry vp the moysture of the stomake and the slimy humours therof, it wil make greate effectes, for the rust of the yron and of the steele is the most hot partes, the dryest parts of them.
And so Galen doeth command it to be prepared with vineger, and that there bee made of it, pouder most small, the which dryeth extreemely, as hee saieth in the nienth of simples, and in the fifth of his Methodo.
Mesue in that of the vlcers of the eares, hee doeth put a confection for them wherein in is conteined the preparing of the rust, and before that hee putteth the same rust prepared in vineger, and made in small pouders, hee maketh of them a liniment for the eares that are troubled with vlcers.
Rasis in the nienth chapter of those thinges that doe comforte the stomake, after hee hath shewed of many compound medicines, saieth, if they doe not profit, let there bee giuen the skales of yron, with wyne, and hee saieth the same in the bookes of the Deuisions in the chapter of the diseases of the moyst stomake: hee commandeth to giue a composition called Trifera Minor and after that, the rust of yron.
And in the same chapter before for the weakenes of the stomake, and the debilitation of the natural heate, hee commandeth that there bee giuen Trifera and after that the rust of yron: and at the end of the sayde chapter, for such as do eate earth, clay, and coales, hee commandeth them to bee purged with Acibar and after that they eate Trifera made with the rust of Iron.
B. You haue spoken very wel, Maister Doctor, but pray you shew vs how wee shoulde minister the pouders of these things.
D. seeing that there with wee shal make an end, wil shew it in short tyme, considering that the time doeth no longer giue place.
The cause and original of the disease being knowen, the sicke person ought to bee let blood, and purged, if it seeme good to the Phisition to bee so, and if the sicke person hath strength therefore: for there are some so leane, that it is not conuenient to vse of any euacuations in them.
This beeing done, they shal take of the pouders that shal seeme most conuenient for them, of the three thinges which are spoken of the yron, the steele, or the rust of them, the quantity that shal seeme good to the Phisition, according to the age vertue, strength.
do giue to them of a meane age a dramme, and from thence ryse or fal, as the age and strength or the continuance of the disease requyreth, and that it may not be lesse then twoo graynes of waight, nor more then a dram halfe, giue it many kinde of wayes, either mingled with suggar of Roses, or with conserua of violettes, or with a syrope of Coriander, or of the roote, or made in pilles, with a syrope made for the purpose, casting them into the mouth, or any maner of these wayes, that they bee taken: there must bee dronke after them a little sacke, that it be not cold, nor very strong.
And if the person that taketh it, drinke no wine, then he may drinke water sodden with Cinamon, although the wine be the better, it must be taken, fasting in the morning, and immediatly after it be taken, they must goe and exercise their bodies, twoo houres after, if they haue strength therefore, and if there bee not strength to doe it, one is sufficient, or the tyme yt they may possibly.
The going must bee in such sort that the partie bee not ouerwearied: and if he be, let him sit downe, now and then, and by reason such as do take them haue stoppings or opilations, of any maner of exercise, although it bee little, they are foorthwith wearie, and all the payne is for the first dayes, for afterward they shal goe very wel, and shal not be so much wearied.
This exercise is better to bee vsed out of the house, and by the streetes, and in the fieldes, it doeth importe very much by the going whereby these pouders do make their woorke, and doe good, that if they bee not well gone with all, they doe not the effect that is desired, and the exercise being made, let him take rest in his house, or in the place where hee commeth vnto, not vnclothing himselfe, but euen so apparelled, let him lye downe vpon his warme bed, and rest himselfe one houre, and let him eate foure houres at the least, after hee hath taken these pouders, or when hee perceyueth his stomake to bee cleere, of them, hee shall eate of a Hen, or of another Byrde without any sauce, with some dry fruite, or some conseruas, and not to eate any greene thing.
Let the drinke be according to the disposition that hee hath, wine watered, if it bee conuenient for him to drinke it, or water sodden with Cinamom: let him refraine to that day from al thinges that may offend him, let him not drinke betweene meales, let him make a light supper, with that as may dry vp moysture.
will not counsell that they take these pouders euery day, but euery third day, and chiefly these first dayes, and especially such which are leane and delicate, for in taking of them euery day, they wil bee much wearied, and one day that they rest betweene, they will be restored, and take strength for the next day.
The day that it is not taken, if there doe appeare any feuer, it would doe well that there were taken a good vessel or great cup full of whey, made of goates milke hot, whot with suggar, if it be not to be had, then take a smal table of rosade of a sweete smel: this day their liuer shall bee anoynted with some oyntment made for the purpose, and their lungs with some thing that may vnstoppe them, and the stomake with some thing that may comfort.
This shal bee done in the morning when he is on his bed, and after the oyntmentes are ended a little tyme, one houre or twoo after that they are anoynted, receiue a common medicine with thinges that haue vertue to euacuate, and this medicine shal not lacke, euery day when the pouders are not taken, for it doeth much import, except: if there bee not many stooles: in such sorte it will bee better that it bee a washing medicine.
The day which they take not the pouders, they may eate sodde meate with some sauce and greene thinges, and in the one day and the other drinke little.
These pouders are giuen many or fewe dayes according to the necessitie of the partie that is sick, and as it doth him good for to some
some there be which do vomit them vp the first twoo or three dayes, and they cast vp much choler with them, whereby they are notably lightened, and doeth pages missing] this sort they giue contentme~t gladnes, know no other medicinall benefite it can do to them.
There are many Phisitions which doo co~mande to carrie to the mony house, (which is the house where the money is made) a pot of water corporall, and spirituall, and after he hath done this, he doeth moderate it in this manner, saying, But such which haue not these eates, and drinketh without them when they are idle, and in pleasure and doe not exercise themselues: these people as they haue not heate to constrayne them to drinke colde, let them not doe it, neither is it conuenient for them to drinke, it, let them content themselues with colde water, as nature hath brought it foorth, without putting it too coole in any other thing, seeyng that they haue not neede of that which is most colde.
And foorthwith he sayeth: Although they liue idlely, and doe no exercise, and also without cares if the time were warme, or very whot, they may drinke the water colde, doe meane that in Countries where it is not colde, they may put it too bee made colde, so that it bee not colde.
The selfesame is confirmed by Galen himselfe in his thirde booke of meates and in the booke of the disease of the raynes, where hee saith, That the vse of colde water cooled with Snowe, vnto suche as are very whot, and such as are and suche as doe excercise themselues and labour muche, that suche may drinke very colde, chiefly if they be vsed therevnto, for such as are accustomed to drinke it· doe suffer and carrie yt better and more without hurte then suche as doe not vse it, for such ought to drinke it with more respect and consideration.
And albeit the water hath so greate benefite in it, as wee haue sayde, for the conseruation of health, it hath greater too heale Feuers and other diseases: and therevppon Hipocrates and Galen treated very particularly, inespecially Galen in the nienth of his doeth reprehende there and suche as doe followe him, which did forbid the vse of colde water, vnto such as were sicke of the Feuers.
And in his first booke of his Methodo by the like reason doeth reprehende Tesalo. and in the seuenth booke he doeth shewe that hee himselfe hath healed many sicke persons that had the griefe of the stomake, with most cold water, and also made cold with Snow.
And in the eight, nienth, tenth, and eleuenth of the same Methodo he healeth the Feuers and other diseases with water that is most colde.
And it is an excellent remedy taken with the conditions that is conuenient.
In the xl. he saith, that the sharpe Feuers are cured with letting blood and colde water, especially the of blood or that haue much mixture thereof.
By that which is said, is seene how conuenient it is, that water be made cold with snowe, where there is not to be founde any so colde as is conuenient for our conseruation contentment, for to heale vs of many infirmities.
Al the which wee haue treated of in briefe, whereby it may be a beginning of our pretence that shall follow, which is to shew the manner how to make tolde with snow, and because that which shall be made colde is the water, and vnder is also to be vnderstood the wine, al the rest that shalbe made cold, we will speake of that which shall be treated, vnder the water.
The water is cold two maner of waies, one naturally as it commeth forth of the springes, and this is as cold as it is conuenient, and hath no neede to coole it, if it hath as muche coldnesse as will satisfie our necessitie, without hauing neede too any thing that may make it colder.
There is an other water which is not so colde as is conuenient for vs, as wel for our conseruation health, as for our satisfaction: and by reason it is not so colde as it ought to be, it is the cause of the hurts it doth, that before we haue spoken of.
Some waters are not so colde as they ought to bee by nature, by reason they are in whot countries: Now our intent is to treate of them how they ought to be made colde, because with their heate they hurte vs, and beyng made cold as much as neede requireth, they doe satisfy vs so that wee may drinke them and vse them without any hurt that they can doe vs: so we wil shew of al the meanes that we may haue to make cold, which are vsed at this day in all the worlde, and of them wee will choose the best, and most sure, setting downe the inconuenience that is in euery one.
There are foure maner of waies to make colde, which at this day are vsed in all the worlde: that is to say, with the aire, in the well, with salt Peter, and with snow: euery one of these is vsed at this day.
The first is, to make colde with the ayre, although it bee a common thing, and vsed in all places, yet it hath beene and is most vsed of the Egyptians, by reason they haue neither wels, nor snowe, and that of the salt Peter they neuer knewe.
Galen maketh a large relation of the manner howe to make cold with the aire, and saith thus: they of Alexandria and Egypt for to make their water colde, that they may drinke it in time of whot wether, doe warme it first, or doe seeth it, then they put it into earthen vessels, and set it in the colde aire, or deaw in the night in windowes, or in the gutters of houses, and there they set it all the night, and before the Sunne riseth, they take it away, and washe the saide earthen vesselles in the outside with colde water, and then they roule them with the leaues of a Uine tree, and of lettice, and other fresh herbes and they put them in the grounde in the most colde part of the house, that there the cold may conserue it.
This maner of making colde is vsed at this day in all the worlde, although not with so much curiositie, by reason they seeth not the water and they content themselues with putting it in the cold ayre, and in the as commonly it is doone.
Likewise they doe make colde the water with hanging it in the ayre, hauing certaine skinnes full of water in the aire and moouing them continually: the which is vsed in all the Countrey called Estremadura
Others doe make colde by putting the vesselles with water in the drawe, and before the Sunne come forth, they drappe them in cloth or in and this the Sheepheardes and other people of the fielde doe.
This manner to make colde with the ayre hath many inconueniences, because the ayre is a subtil element subiect to any maner of alteration and corruption: and therefore it may be infected with some euill qualitie, easily: being infected, it may infect the water that so is made colde, infusing therinto his malice.
The which Auicen sheweth very wel in the second of the first saying, The ayre is an euill thing, by reason it is mingled with euill thinges, as Uapors, and smelles, and euill smoakes, chiefly that which is put in betweene two walles, and especially that which passeth by places where are rotten Plantes, and naughty Trees, and where dead bodies are, for it altereth at euery one of these thinges, and of them receiueth an euill quality.
And for this cause the auncient Phisitions did forbid that in time of the plague the water shoulde not be put into the ayre to bee made colde, because the corrupt ayres should not infect it.
There is likewise an other inconuenience, that you cannot euery night set the water too bee made colde in the Ayre, for some nights and the moste parte of them, in the Summer time are so whot, that not onely the ayre doeth not make colde, but the water that is set in the ayre, is whotter then it was before, and if it bee made any whit colde, it dureth no longer then the Morning, when it is not needefull, and likewise in the time betweene Winter and Sommer, or in the Winter when the ayre woulde make colde, then the rayne, the tempestes and cloudes and other alterations will not suffer the ayre to doe it.
There is an other manner of way how to make cold with the ayre, which is the most wholesome, and more without hurt than any of all the other: wherein there is no occasion of any euill qualitie.
And there are many people of estimation which doe vse this way to make colde that, which they should drinke, the which they put into vessels of earth, or metall, and do alwayes make winde and ayre to the vessels with a wet lynnen cloth.
And it must be so, that it be in the ayre continually without ceasing, as long as you are at meate.
And in this sorte it will be made colde to purpose, and the hote ayre that is ioyned to the vessell is taken awaye, and in place of it commeth freshe and colde ayre, euen as it doeth when there is gathered winde to the face, and taking away the hote ayre that is ioyned to it, and with freshe ayre it maketh it colde and refresheth.
The other waye to make colde, is in a well, wherein they do put the vessels with water or wine, and there they remayne the moste parte of the daye.
This kynde of making colde hath also many inconueniences, as well of the parte of the water, wherewith it is made colde, as of the parte of the place where it is put, cheefely in the welles of the cities and townes, that for the moste parte are fowle and full of filthinesse.
The water of these welles is an earthly water, grosse and harde, because it is continually standing in one place, and shut within the bowels of the earth.
And as it is a standing water, it must of force he putrified, for that the beames of the Sunne do not pearce it, nor yet the ayre doeth visite it, and therefore continually it is full of euill vapours, whereof they do easily rott, and they are foule waters full of durte and claye, and of other mischiefes of an euill qualitie.
And seeing the water or wine is so put a long tyme into this foule standing water, what can come of it, but that it participateth of the euill qualitie that it hath? And so Galen sayeth, that the vessell which must be put into the well, ought to bee full: for if it lacke of his fulnesse, then the water of the well doeth penetrate it, or the vapour of it goeth into that which is emptie: and therefore it is conuenient that the vessell bee filled full, and that it bee well stopt, for that which is sayde.
And hee sayeth the contrarye, when wee shall make colde in the ayre: for then the vessell shall not bee put full, but some parte thereof remayne emptie: for the colde ayre in the night season entering into that which is emptie, doeth make the water more colde.
Ordinarily they are vessels of Copper, or of the lease of Milan which are put in welles for to make colde.
The Copper, if it bee not well tinned within, doeth suffer too enter into that which is to be made colde an, euil qualitie: for with the moysture of the well, there is growen in it immediately, a certeine greenesse that is seene vppon it, after it hath stoode a fewe dayes, which is a thing verye euill and hurtfull.
The leafe of Milan is made of Iron, the which with the moysture of the well is taken forthwith with rust, which is a blacke thing that is seene vppon it after a fewe dayes, which is an euill thing, which doeth infuse an euill qualitie into that which is drunke.
And therefore am of the opinion that that which should be made colde in the water of a well, should bee in a glassed vessell or of siluer, although the best waye is to take out water of a well, and put it into a vessel, in the which shoulde bee put that which should bee made colde, mouing the water manye tymes: for by takyng the water out of the well, it looseth much of his euill vapours, by reason it is visited of the ayre, which as is sayde, doeth shewe the incouenience that there is by making colde in a well.
And besides that, wee see that the water hath euer a taste of earth, or of some euill taste, that is perceyued notably, after it is dronke, besides the euill smell which wee see it taketh.
The third manner and fashion to make cold, is with saltpeter, the which is an inuention of marchantes, and in especially of such as goe in the Gallie, by reason that there the ayre doeth not make colde, and especially in the tyme of calmes, and there is neither welles nor snow.
Necessity did teach the~ this remedie, although it is not good, for the great inconueniences which it hath.
It doth coole, as some say, the colde running vnto the inner partes of that which it doeth make colde, for the excessiue heate which the saltpeter hath, the which is done with the strong force of the saltpeter with the water, which the saltpeter beeing entered into the inner partes maketh to bee colde, comming from the heate of the saltpeter working vpon the strong force thereof.
Other say, that the water doeth make it selfe grosse with the saltpeter, and being made more thicke and grosse, it hath more colde vertue, the which beeing holpen with the heate of the saltpeter, the cold maketh a greater through the water, for al thinges that are cold, the more thicke partes that they haue, the more they coole.
And so Galen saith in the bookes of the simple medicines, that nothing ca~ be very cold, which hath subtil thin partes, by the which howe more thicke the things are the more force they are of.
Other there be which say that the saltpeter hath an actual vertue, very colde, and woorking with the water, is made more cold: as is seene by the bryne, that after the salt is very much stirred in the water, it is most cold.
The selfsame is seene in the water of Allom, and of saltpeter.
This maner of making cold doth cause many diseases, it doeth heate the liuer, it causeth continuall heate, and a hot burning, it inflameth the lungs, it taketh away the lust of meate and other euilles, which woulde be tedious to treate of.
There are other wayes to make cold, which are in riuers, and most colde fountaines, whereof Galen speaketh, of the which it is not needefull to treate of, for whereas are most cold waters, it is not needful to put them to bee made colde, but to vse of them as they are.
Wee haue shewed howe the water that shoulde be made rayne with the coldnesse of the middle region of the ayre, did freese, and was made snowe, and therfore is little difference from the rayne water, and that which commeth foorth of the snowe, for both of them are ingendred of one manner of matter, sauing that the water which proceedeth of the snowe, is somewhat more grosse, for the compultion it hath, of the coldnes of the ayre, in such sort that it is not so euil, as they say it is.
And we see the Scithians doe drinke it continually, as Hypocrates sayth.
We see that of the snowe which doeth melt, are made great and mighty riuers, of the which the people that inhabit neere to them, drinke continually without doing to them any maner of hurt, or benumming of them.
And of these are many in Spaine, Almanie and many more in the west Indias where most of the riuers are of snowe, which doeth melte from the hilles and mountaynes, and al people in general drinke of them, for there is no other water in al the Countrie.
The Romaynes for delight and curiositie, dranke the water that came foorth of the snowe, the which they strayned through stones to make it more thin.
Atheneo doeth certaine verses of Sopita an ancient Poet, in the which he saith, that in his tyme they dranke snowe, and the water wc came foorth of the snowe.
Pericrates Historiographer being a Greeke most famous, saith yt in his tyme, they dranke snow, not only in the Cities but in the campes.
Euticles a man very learned, in one of his epistels doeth reprehende those that were in his tyme, that they did not content themselues to drinke that which was made cold with snow, but that they dranke the snow it selfe.
Sciates maketh mention of the snowe, vsed at tymes conuenient, with much care and delite.
Xenophon in the thinges of memory which hee wrote, maketh mention of many people that did not onely drinke snowe, but the water therof continually.
The Romanes did vse it much, and so Plinie in the
booke of his history saith, that Nero was the first that sodde to coole it in Snowe.
The which Galen in the seuenth of his Methodo doth recite of him, saying, Nero was the first that sodde the waters, and afterwarde cooled them with Snowe: for the water being made colde in this sorte, receiueth more quickly the colde, and more effectually.
And it is a water more healthfull, for by the seething of it, is auoyded the earthly partes from the water, and it remayneth more subtile, and more thin, and so it descendeth more speedily from the stomacke.
Plinie in his naturall historie, in the nineteenth booke, complayneth of the care that those of his time had, in keeping the Snowe of the Winter, for the hote weather in Summer, saying, that they did ouerthrow the mountaines by keeping the snowe from warme weather, making it to peruert the order of nature, that in the monthes which are most whot, in the which there is nothing but heate drithe, that the curiositie of the people is so much that at that time, there is such aboundance of snowe, as in the monthes in the which there doeth naturally fal vpon the grounde great qua~tity thereof.
This Plinie saieth, for in his tyme and after, it was a common thing to keepe the snow of the winter, for the summer.
Heliogabalo Emperour had made a great caue in a litle mountayne, from a garden of his owne, where hee gathered in the winter very greate quantitie of snowe, bringing it from the mountaynes that were neerest to Rome whereof they vsed in tyme of heate, in their bankettes.
Chares Militineus in the history that hee wryteth of King Alexander sayeth, that in the Citie of Petra a most populous Citie in Asia there was, ordinarily thirty caues, that in the winter tyme were filled with Snowe, for the whot weather, for the seruice of Alexander such as were retayners to him.
At this day it is done, not onely in Asia but also in many partes of Africa and in all Europe chiefly in all the Countries which are vnder the dominions of the greate Turke, and especially in Constantinople where the snowe is so much vsed, that all the yeere it is solde in publike market, and they vse of it al the yeere.
The selfe same is done at this day in all the states of Almanie and of Flaunders, Hungary and Bohemia and other places, where they keepe the Snowe, in houses, and in the Winter, for to make their drinke colde therewith in the summer.
They carry from Flaunders to Paris the water that is frosen, which is more then three score leages distance.
Lykewyse in our country of Castile it is kept in houses, and they gather it in the winter: and when winter is past, they conserue it for the whote weather.
And there are many Lordes and great men, which haue in the mountaynes particular houses, where they commande that it bee put in the winter, for this effect: and many of them doe vse it, and doe make colde therewith as well in the winter, as in the summer, as there are chiefly in Castile in the tyme of winter, waters that are most colde.
They which drinke that which is made colde with snowe, saye that it doeth not offende them, as that which is made cold with the weather, for it is seene that a cuppe of colde water beeing dronke, that commeth foorth of a well, or of a colde fountayne, hurteth such as doe drinke it, and drinking that which is made colde with snow, they feele no such hurte.
doe much maruell at one thing, that this Citie of Siuill beeing one of the most famous of the Worlde, wherein alwayes haue liued many greate personages of very high estate, and many people of greate estimation as well of the naturall people of the Country, as strangers, that ther hath byn none which haue brought thither snowe in the time of whot weather for to make colde that which they drinke, seeyng that the heate of this countrie from the beginning of Sommer, vntil it be well neere towardes Winter, is so great, that it is not to be suffered, and all the waters are most whot, that they cannot scarcely be drunke.
And besides that the moste parte of the people of this Citie are people of much businesse and cares.
And seeyng that in a Countrie so whot where businesse and cares doe abounde where the water is whot, and nothing wherewithall to coole it; with iust Title it may be admitted and vsed that it may be cooled with snowe, seeyng that the coldnesse is so sure, as we haue sayd, and it doth make the benefites which Galen and Auicen haue shewed vnto vs.
Let euery one looke vppon his disposition that beeing whole, although hee bee not altogether in health, in time of whot wether he may drinke colde more or lesse as it is conuenient for him.
For the drinking colde doeth temper the Liuer, it mitigateth the heate, it geueth appetite to meate, it comforteth the stomake, it geueth strength too all the foure vertues, that may doe theyr woorkes the better, the meate is eaten with appetite, and with gladnesse it taketh away the drithe in the day time, it causeth that the stone doth not ingender in the raynes, by keeping temperate the heate of them, it taketh away lothsomnesse, and likewise it doeth many other good effectes, that the vse and thereof experience ode shewe vs.
And because it is the best manner too make colde with Snowe as we haue sayde, let vs awe thereof with graue Authours: and let Auicen bee the first, in the thirde of the first, where he saith, The water that is made cold with snow, vnto such as are of a temperate complection, whereas coldenesse hath beene made with Snowe, yea although the snow be fowle and not cleane then it serueth to make colde the water without: and that as is good and cleane, is to be put in, to that which shalbe dronke, as Auicen himselfe sheweth in the second parte of the first booke, the
chapter, where hee sayth, the snowe and the frosen water, when it is cleane, and that the Snowe hath not fallen vppon euill plantes, or that it be not mingled with earth, or other and the frost not made of euill infected waters, but that the water which come foorth of the snow, bee cleere and cleane, and the water that commeth foorth of the frost, be also good and cleane, if any parte of the water of the snowe or of the frost bee put into the water that must bee dronke, or with them the water be made cold without dout it is good: for the waters which come foorth of them, bee not straunge from other waters.
This doth Auicen say, giuing to vnderstande that these waters which doe proceed of snow and of frost being cleane, doe not differ from the goodnesse of other waters: onely the difference is, that the water of the snowe and of the frost are grosser then other waters, by reason that the vapour is congeled in the middle region of the ayre, as wee haue declared.
Rasis amongest the Arabiens the best learned, in the thirde booke of those which hee wrote to the King Almasor sayeth thus, The water of snowe cooleth the Liuer that is whot, beeing taken after meate, it strengtheneth the stomake, it giueth appetite and lust to meate, but that which is dronke may not be much.
And immediatly after he sayth, the water which hath not so much coldnesse, that it giueth not contentment to him that drinketh it, filleth the belly, taketh not away the drithe, it destroyeth the appetite, it taketh away the lust of the meate, it consumeth the body, and concludeth, in saying, that it is not a thing conuenient to bee dronke.
do vnderstand it for the preseruation of the health of man, of the which Rasis treating in that booke himselfe in the
of Almasor speaking of the preseruation from the pages missing] and there commeth to him hurt and poyson, which destroyeth and corrupteth him: beleeue you mee, and suffer not such which are sicke, to spende their mony to cast golde in medicines which they take, nor let them quenche golde that is whot in wyne, nor in water, for of the one and of the other, there remayneth no medicinal vertue, that wil remedy their euilles.
Only the golde being made mony, hath greate vertues and properties, for that is it that maketh the hart glad, and taketh away sadnesse and melancholy, and repaireth al the vertues and strength of man, it giueth strength whereas is none, it is an vniuersal remedy of al thinges, vnles it bee of death: for against that, nothing can preuayle.
And seeing that night is come, and tyme giueth not vnto vs any longer liberty, and although that it gaue vs; yet age doeth his office, for feele my selfe weary.
God bee with you Maister Ortun~o and likewyse to you Maister Burgus and goe to take rest.
THE BOKE WHICH TREATETH OF THE SNOW, AND OF the properties vertues therof: And of the maner that should be vsed to make the drink cold therwith: of the other wayes wherewith drinke is to be made colde: Wherof is shewed partly, in the latter parte of the seconde Dialogue of yron.
With other curiosities which will geue contentment by other auncient thinges woorthy too bee knowen, which in this treatise shalbee declared.
To the excellent Lord the Earle of Barajas assistent of the citie of Seuill &c. the Doctor Monardes your Phisition wisheth health.
MOst excellent Lorde, the faire white snow doeth complaine vnto mee, saying: that she being so auncient, and of so many ages, celebrated of so many Princes, Kinges, wise and valiant and beyng had in so greate estimation and price, that with greate care they seeke after her, with greater care they doe conserue her, for to geue health contentment to all persons: yet for all this, many people with little consideration, not knowing what they say, doe persecute her, putting vndecent names to her: and that which doeth most greeue her is, that some Phisitions, either for ignora~ce, or for malice, do speak euil of her, not perceiuing what so many lerned me~ haue treated said of the great vtility profit which she doth to many, as experience doth shew, all people doe vnderstand, chiefly when they doe drinke their drink most cold with the benefit which doth remaine to them thereof, they do praise extol her.
Moreouer she saith, that she forceth no perso~ to vse her: but if any wil vse her, shee can geue such order maner to make cold the drinke, as is co~+uenient for al persons, geuing the degrees of coldenesse which euery one would haue, which doeth best appertayn to them, this with all assurance with onely leauing or placing the vessel the drinke is ioyned nere to her, the which none of the olde writers nor of the late did speake against, or forbid.
And especially let this maner of making cold not be done with stinking water of a well, nor with the most burning Saltpeter, but with pure water beyng cleane and cleare.
These co~plaintes many other the faire lillie white Snow hath vttered vnto me, in the end she lastly saide to me, that since that had praysed her so much, and taken in hande to fauour that should pages missing] ly the fire hath no mixture of other Elementes, and amongest these Elements the ayre is very principall, which is deuided into three parts, one is the supreame, and neere to the of the efire, which is whotte and drie for the felowshippe that it hath therewith, taking muche of his qualitie, which is cleere and pure, from whence doe not proceede anye wyndes, nor cloudes: and this they call the celestiall Region and the partes more lowe which are neere too the water and earth be and troubled full of Uapours, pearced and visited with the beames of the Sunne, whereby it commeth too bee whotte and the supreame and middle Region of the ayre doeth come too bee very colde, because it standeth in the middest of the twoo extremities, beeyng so whotte.
And in it, is increased the colde as in the middle parte fleing from the extreme partes of heate, as we haue spoken of before.
This middle parte hath partes more or lesse colde, for the parte that is ioyning neere vnto vs is not so cold, as that which is neere to the superiour partes of the fire.
And how much more the vapours do rise vp on height, the more they doe congele, and hold fast.
In the middle region of the ayre doe ingender the clowdes, the small raynes, the droppes, the frost, the rayne, the Snowe, the Hayle, and other impressions as the Thunder, lightnings and sharpe showers, and comets.
The Clowdes be the principal matter which doe ingender the Rayne, the Snowe, and the Hayle, and the other impressions which wee haue spoken of, that are made of many Uapours which doe rise vp from the lower partes vnto the middle Region of the ayre: and so being ioyned, they make one body, and they waxe thicke with the colde of the saide place: and for this the clowd is like to a mother, and is the common matter of all the impressions that are made in the ayre.
And so it is of the snowe as a thing ingendred of it, in the middle Region of the ayre.
And the Snowe is no other thing but a Uapour, colde, and moyst, which came into the middle Region of the ayre, beeing ingendred, in the bodie of the Clowde with a meane coldenesse which is not so strong as that which doeth cause the Hayle, nor so soft as that which doeth cause the water, and in the like Uapour before it be made water, it both, congeale and freese, and doeth fall broken in peeces and are white, because there doe rayne in them more colde then in the water.
The which Galen doeth shewe vnto vs in the booke of the Philosophicall hystory of Anaximenes the Philosopher.
Of the congealed ayre, he saieth that the cloudes are made; and of the same, beeyng more thicke, the rayne is ingendred, and the same is congealed and frosen, and by the coldenesse of the Ayre it is made Snowe: and beeyng more congealed it is made Hayle.
And the same Galen doeth say in his booke de Vtilitate respirationis the Clowdes congealed are made Snowe: which is the matter that the rayne is made of, the Snowe doeth fall in the highe places, which of their owne nature are colde places, and thereby it is muche conserued, and very seldome it falleth in the Ualleyes, and if it doe fall there, it is very smal, foorthwith it dissolueth.
It falleth in the Sea but seldom times by reason of the heat which it hath, for the winds that are continually in it, for heat moisture are co~traries much more the wind acco~panied with the sunne.
Galen in the nienth of his simples, saieth, that there were Philosophers that saide the snow had hot parts for being take~ in the hand, it heateth burneth like to fire.
of the sayd Bookes, sayeth as he went vpon snow, his feet did burne: the cause of this is not that the snow is whot, nor that it hath whot parts, but with his cold it doth shut the pores of the handes or feete and causeth that the heate which is in the inner partes haue not wher to come forth: so being shut in, do cause so great a kindlying, that seemeth to burne: the which we see contrary if the handes doe burne be put into whot water, as ye pores pages missing] drinking of the coldest water they were healed, as Galen sayth in the
of his that he sawe in one day, in one houre, with a draught of colde water many diseases were healed, and some of these were weake of stomake, not only, with colde water of a fountaine, but with water cooled in snowe, and in Roe it is vsed.
And so Cornelio Celso in his first booke, vnto such as were weake of stomake, commanded them to drinke, after they had eaten, the coldest water they could get, and in cholerike stooles, should be dronke water, that was most cold, and in runnings of whot humors, it shoulde bee vsed, for to stay the fluxe.
Auicen in the sayde chapter saith, that the cold water doth co~fort all the in his workes that is to say the vertue disgestiue, attractiue, rete~tiue, and expulsiue.
And so he goeth declaring euery one of them, giuing vs to vnderstand how much the colde water doth corroborate and make strong al these vertues, whereby they doe their workes the better.
And the said Auicen in the second of his first treatie of water, saieth, the colde water is the best of all waters, and it is conuenient for them which are whole, for it giueth lust to meate, maketh the stomake strong.
And a little before hee saieth, that which is not colde doeth corrupt disgestion, and causeth the meate to swim in the stomake, it taketh not away the drithe, it causeth the dropsie, by reason it corrupteth the first consumeth the body with his heate.
Auicen himselfe confirmeth this in the thirde of the first part, saying, the colde water is conuenient for them that haue a temperate complection, for being whot, it causeth the stomake to be sicke.
Isaac Aliabas and Rasis say the same, that Auicen saith, the which he did let to wryte of, bycause hee woulde not bee long in his sayings.
One thing Auicen would haue in the thirde of the first parte, that hee which shoulde drinke very cold, must first make a good foundation, eating first a good portio~ of meate, before he drinke.
Also he saith that the cold drinke may not be dronke much at one draught, but by litle and litle, by reason it doth bring two benefits, which is, that there is taken more taste in that which is and it not kill the natural heat, as it is seene by the pot that boyleth, if you cast into it much water at one tyme, it doeth cease boyling, but if it be cast by litle and litle, it ceaseth not his working.
And therfore Auicen himselfe sayeth, when that you will drinke colde, that you drinke with a vessell which hath a straight mouth, that the drinke run not in hastily, the said vessel beeing a limet, or a yewre, with a poynt, surely it is a greate benefit, for them which are affectioned to drinke with the lyke if they ought first to take out the winde or not, do remit me to the Doctor Villalabos who treateth largely of this matter.
And by that it is seene howe Auicen woulde that those which woulde drinke very colde, they shoulde not drinke foorthwith at the beginning of their meate.
For there bee, that as soone as they begin to eate, foorthwith they will drinke, that as is very colde, the stomacke beeing empty without meate, which cannot choose but hurte: and so the hurt which doth come to them by this, they doe attribute it, foorthwith to the colde of the drinke, and not to their euil order: the which Auicen sayth, speaking of cold water, that to drinke it without order, is the cause of many diseases, if it be dronke in order, as wel in time, as in quantity, it profiteth as he hath said.
Therfore let euery one loke to that which is conuenient for him, and let him make experience in himself, and if that it be conuenient for him to drinke colde, that hee may beare, it without that it doe offende him that doe it, for therof wil follow the benefites which we haue spoken of, but if he bee sicke, and fall into any disease, whereby hee saith, that the drinking of colde drinke doeth offende him, in such case let him not vse it, for my intent is to and perswade them that doe drinke colde, that if it doe them no hurt, nor offende them that they drinke it so, such as doe vse it of custome and haue experience that it doe not offende the~, vnto such they drinke not, that which they drinke cold, the lust of their meate is taken away from the~, for they take no taste in that which they eate, and they eate it with grief, and with an euil wil, for that which they drinke doth not satisfie them, the whot drinke doth fil the stomake full of windinesse, and cannot make therewith a good disgestion.
But what is hee that hath a reasonable health, being in the tyme of great heate, or in the whot summer, that comming to eate, being weary of exercyse, or of greate labour hauing the tongue dry, the breath shorte, that doeth let to drinke colde, seeing that to doe it, there doe followe the benefites that haue sayde, and doeth succor his necessity, and remayne content and glad without hauing offended his disposition, and health.
Unto the which Galen doeth animate and exhorte in the booke which hee made of good and euil meates, saying.
In the tyme of hot weather, when our bodies are whot and somtymes inflamed, then we must vse of thinges that may refreshe vs: although that they bee euill meates, as Plummes, Apples, Cheries, Melons, Goords, of other colde fruytes, in these lyke tymes.
Galen saith, that wee may vse colde meates, as the feete of a pigge or hogge sodden in vinegre, and crudded milke: and the same meates must be made colde, and likewyse the drinke must bee made colde, as the water, and the wyne watered with colde water, or made cold in snowe, the one and the other must be made colde in the most cold water of a fountaine, and if it be not to be had, let it bee made colde in snow, chiefly the drinke.
And after that Galen hath made a large digression, as it is conuenient so much in the tyme of greate heate to eate and to drinke colde things, hee doeth describe who they are that should drinke colde, and saith in this sorte, those that should drinke cold are such, as haue much buzines, and haue care of many things, as those which are gouerners of cities, and common wealthes, and the ministers which doe helpe them, and doe participate of such cares and troubles, and those that are much exercised in bodily buzines, in especially the sowldierlyke exercises, or other great exercises, and they which doe iorney, and inespecially long iorneyes, giuing to vnderstand all corporal exercises.
Here doe see many being sicke, and hauing great occasions of sicknes, after that they drinke cold, they are whole: and when they vse it not, they become sicke agayne.
And although experience doe shewe it, yet Galen doeth teach it vs, in many places, being the Prince of Phisicke.
For in the thirde degree of the substance of meates, he saith, that vnto them which are whot of stomake, it is conuenient that their drinke be made colde with snowe: the same he doth confirme in the booke of good and euil meates.
of his Methodo it hath beene seene, as he saith, that diseases haue beene healed, and the griefes of the stomake with colde water, made colde with snowe, and in the
of the Epidimias hee doeth vse much of water, first sodden and after cooled with snow, and in many partes hee doeth put to coole in snowe the medicines, which he doeth vse of: and the same doe the Arabiens for that, as it is sayde, it doeth seeme that the snowe was had in reuerence, by the ancient wryters, and that they did vse of it in the preseruation of their health, and in the healing of their diseases, for that it was the best maner how to nake it cold, more cleane, and more without scruple.
For the cold that proceedeth of snow, is healthful without receyuing hurt, by that which is cooled with it, nor causeth any alteration bycause it is a very good congeled water, and doeth make cold.
Truthe it is, that it is not conuenient to vse of the sayde snowe continually, if it be not in tyme of need, by the way of medicine: for the vse of the sayde snowe dronke in water or in wyne, or putting the snowe into them, doth ingender many kind of diseases, which if presently they bee not felt, they come to be felt in age: Of the which Galen doeth make a large relation, in the booke of diseases of the raynes, and in the booke of good and euil meates.
And bycause that Auicen did expound them, wil shew what he wryteth, in the third part of the first booke, in the
chapter: He which doth drinke snow, and the water that doth proceed out of the same snowe, if hee doe vse it continually there will followe much hurt thereby: it doth offend the sinewes, and it is naught for the brest, and for the inner members, and especially for the breathing: and there is none that doe vse to drinke it, but it wil do them hurte, vnlesse hee be of a sanguine complection which if hee doe not feele hurt presently, hee shall feele it afterwarde.
Whereby it appeareth howe euill the vse of the sayde snowe is, and the water which doeth come out of it, if it bee not by the way of medicine, onely so it may bee vsed to coole therewith, for in such sorte it doeth not offende, as is sayde.
For in this neither the auncient wryters did put any doubt of hurt, nor any scruple, and nowe wee see that it hurteth not, but bringeth health, and benefit, as wee haue sayde.
And as Plinie also sayth, of the delight and dayntinesse of the colde, without offence of any malice of the Snowe.
booke, where hee sayth, the snowe must not be dronke, but that licor which is made very colde with it.
And this was shewed and taught vnto vs, by the most ingenious drithe.
And vnto such as are very colde, it commeth not well to pas, for them to drinke that, which is made cold with snow, or that which is very colde, if hee bee not accustomed theretoo: for by custome, they may vse and drinke it without any offence to them, but it is good that they moderate themselues in drinking that which is very colde, and that they themselues that it bee made colde, after a meane sorte, although it bee with snowe.
Also it is not conuenient for children, nor boyes, that their drinke be made cold, with snowe, for the weakenes of the sinewes, and interiour parts, and for the tendernesse of their age, and chiefly they may drinke no wyne, but water, for that their age doeth not suffer, that they may drinke it: and drinking water very colde, it doeth them very much hurte.
The wyne which is made colde with snowe, doeth not offende so much as the water which is made colde: one of the things which taketh away the fury and strength of the Wyne, is the making of it colde.
And so there are three thinges which doe abate the fury of the wyne, that is, to water it a good tyme before you drinke it.
Also to cast a peece of bread into it, that it may sucke the vapours, and subtiltie of the wyne.
The third is, to put it to coole some reasonable time in water, that is most colde, or in snowe, for the more it is cooled, the more the strength and vapours are repressed, and so it will lesse offend the head, and it will lesse penetrate the ioyntes, which is seene in the sayde wyne, and beeing made colde there is abated much of his strength, in so much that if it bee very colde, it seemeth as though that it were water.
Some people there are which doe say and publish much euil of the cooling with snowe, without knowing if it be good or euill: and as it is a newe thing, and especially in this Countrie, they feare that there will come hurt to them by the vse of it.
And beeing at the table of a Lorde, there was brought a platter full of Cheries with snowe vppon them, and there was a Gentleman that durst not take any one of them, saying that they would hurt him, bycause that they were made colde with Snowe.
And as it was a thing vsed a long time, to cast snowe vppon fruite, as Galen doeth say that it was cast vpon the Mulbery, the cause of this is for lacke of the vse thereof, by reason it hath not bene vsed nor seene in these partes, and alwayes they take it for suspicious.
And heere are none that doe vse it, but the noble men, and not al, but such as haue beene Courtiers and such as haue proued the benefit and commodity that doth followe of it: for the rest say, that without know they haue loued, and without it, they wil pas on their tyme.
And they do not consider that to liue they may passe with Beefe, and Garlyke, and Leekes, but these kinde of meates doe ingender euil humours: for it is one thing to eate the partridge, the veale at his time, and mutton byrds at another tyme.
And there is differi~ce to eate the flesh with sauce, the partridge with a Lemon, for the one is to eate without taste rustically, and the other is to eate as men doe, choycely and delicately.
And so it is in the drinking of cold, or whot, for of the drinke that is made colde with snow, there foloweth health, taste contentment: and of the drinke that is whot, commeth euill diseases, discontentment.
Let vs consider vow the old wryters tooke great felicitie to drinke colde, and chiefly that which was made cold with snow, and they were people both wyse and discrete, and with much care that preserued their health.
For in this and in their estimations, in their maner of subtile liuing, they did put their whole felicitie· seeing that they with so much care as we haue before declared, did drinke that which they made colde with snowe, in countries that was of lesser heate then this, wherfore shoulde we not inioy this benefit, and seing that therof cannot followe vnto vs, but greate benefit of health, vsing therof as haue said? Let euery one looke to that it is conuenie~t for his health, age, vse, and custome, and let him haue respect to that which doth agree with him: for the vse wil shew him what hee shall do, seeing that of the hurt or benefit, he may soone perceiue if it ought to be vsed, or no, he must be aduised that at the when he doth vse to drinke cold, that which is made cold with snow, the first daies hee shal feele in the day tyme drithe, but being past
dayes, it is taken away, rather they goe betweene dinner and supper without drith, without hauing any need to drinke.
They do bring the snow to this countrie, from the mou~tains wheras is much snow
The snow hath many things to preserue it, because the way is long and it commeth by a whot country, by reason whereof it doeth muche diminishe, very little commeth hither of that which they take out there: and therefore it is so deere.
It is a maruellous thing that these mountaines of Granado are alwaies full of snow, that in them it is durable and perpetual, and for great heates, and sunne, that shineth vpon them: yet the snow continueth in one state, and we see that it doth not change.
In the mou~taines Pirineos which are filled with snow euery winter, but the su~mer being come, al is melted, in such sort that there remayneth in them no snowe.
The kinges of Granado being in all theyr royall authoritie did vse in the moneths of great heat and time of summer, to drink these waters which they dranke made cold with snow, as our hystory writer Alonso de Palensio doth referre himselfe too he wrote of the warres of Granado
Let the snowe be kept in cold and dry places, for the moysture and heate are his contrary, the wind which commeth of the much more, because it is whot moyst.
They doe tread or presse the snowe, when they put it in sellers to keepe, that it may the lo~ger endure melt lesse.
Charles Militineus doth say that the snow must be kept trode~ couered wt leaues and bowes of an Oke, because in this sort it is most conserued.
That which is brought to this citie, they bring it in strawe, for it doeth conserue it more then any other thing, it doeth melt the lesse: which the glorious S. Augustine doeth shew vs in the first booke of the citie of God, where he saith, who gaue vnto the straw a cold vertue so strong, that it kepeth the snow which is most cold and conserueth it? and who gaue it likewise so whot feruent a vertue, that the green fruit not being rype, as apples and other like, it doth rype and season them that they may be eaten? in the which it is seene what diuers vertues the straw hath, seeing that it contrary effectes which doth conserue the snow, doeth make ripe the greene fruite, and doth more then the water, which is made colde in the deawe, or in other thing: by putting any vessell with it amongest strawe, it doeth conserue his coldenesse all the day.
There were vsed two principal wayes in these times too make colde with snow: the one is, to put the bottelles or the vessels of that as you will make cold, buried in the snow, this is done where there is much snow, this doth make very cold and quickly: the same is likewise done with the water frosen.
There is another way to make cold which is more easie and it is done with little snow, which is to fill a vessell of that which is to be made colde, and put vpon it a little platter of or glasse, or of Plate called the leafe of Milan that it may be made so deepe, whereby it may penetrate through that which shalbe made cold, and vppon that deepe vessell let the snow bee put, and from time to time, the water which doeth melt from the snow must be taken away, for if it bee not taken away, it heateth the snow, and it melteth the more.
After this sort it doeth coole much, and maketh it as exceeding cold as you woulde drinke it: and it is a way that euery one may vse more or lesse, as colde as he will, or as hee hath neede of it.
The selfesame is done with a long caue made of the leafe of Milan putting it full of snow, into the thing that you mynde to make colde continuing in it still, and this is to make anie thing colde in an earthen pot or any other great vessell.
This manner of way is long or it be colde, and it is needfull that it be put long tyme before you goe too meate, and for all this it will not make it very colde.
Others there bee that doe put the snowe in a little basket, layde vpon a little strawe, for this doeth conserue the snowe muche, putting in one goblet with that as you wil drinke, leaning harde too the snow: after this sorte there followeth muche benefite, for it is not needefull to goe taking away the water from the snowe, by reason that it goeth away through the basket.
And the other is, that the snowe doeth not melt so muche, let euery man doe as hee hath the quantitie of Snowe to doe it withall, and likewise in the cooling of it, more or lesse as his necessitie and health doeth require, and can beare well the vse thereof: of the which wee haue made a large relation, although that my intente and purpose was for no more than too defende that the best way too make the drinke colde, and more healthfull is to make cold with snowe, and as for the other manner of wayes and vses too make colde, they haue many inconueniences which haue spoken of, and onely too make colde with Snow, is that which is conuenient, seeyng that the snowe doeth not touche the thing, onely the little platter that is made cold with it, is onely that which doeth make colde.
All other wayes which doeth make colde, doeth not come neere to the cooling with snow by a great way, for that is most colde which is cooled with it, and all other wayes doe seeme whotte, beeyng made colde in the deawe, in welles, or with saltpeter, in comparison of that which is made colde with snow.
And so it is a greate thing, and too bee muche esteemed that in the tyme of whot weather, when are made a burning cole, of the extreeme heate of the tyme, when the drithe is so great, that it maketh vs to sounde and our bodies are so burning and sweating, that we haue so easie a remedie with a little Snowe, wee may drinke so colde as is conuenient for vs, and as colde as wee will, with all assuraunce of health geuing vs so muche delighte and contentment, that there is no price to bee esteemed too it, nor vnderstanding that can expounde it, of the which euery one that doth drinke colde with snowe may bee iudge of my Apologie when they do make an end to drinke by meanes of the most colde snowe.
By that which is said, it is seene what a thing snowe is, how the vse of it was esteemed amongst the people of old time for to make colde therwith, as the best maner of these which are to make colde withall, and more agreeable to our health and necessitie, is that which is done therewith; also as the drinking cold doth bring so many benefits and commodities, the drinking hot so many hurts disco~modities, seeing that to vse it is to make leane, and debilitate the stomake, it doeth make the meate to swim in it, it doth corrupt the disgestion, whereby it doth consume and weaken the bodie, it ingendreth winds, it is the cause that the Liuer is debilitated, weakened, it causeth continuall drithe, it doth not satisfie our necessity, it geueth paine and griefe and other hurts, that he which doeth vse it, shall quickely feele them in himselfe.
The which is contrary to them that do drinke colde being cold of his owne nature, or made colde with snow, for that it doth co~fort the stomak if it be weake, stre~gtheneth it doth stay the flixe, runninges of whot humors to it, therefore it taketh a way stooles and vomits being cholerike, it doth comfort all the
vertues, it taketh away the driche, it geueth lust to eate, it maketh the disgestion better, you drinke lesse that with more contentment gladnes, satisfiing vs more to a little cold drink, then much which is whot.
It doth let the ingendring of the stone vnto the~ which are whot of co~plection, it maketh te~perate the heat of the liner, it taketh away the kindling of the fire of them that are too hot, or inflamed of what cause soeuer it be, it tempereth the excessiue heate of the summer, it preserueth from the plague in the time of it, and being taken vppon meate it strengtheneth natural heat, that it may make better his disgestion worke, it taketh away the sharp paines which commeth of any hot cause, it taketh away the trembling of the hearte, it maketh glad them that are melancholie, it taketh from wine his furie vapours, the fruits put in snowe, cause, that they doe not corrupt, hee that drinketh cold doth enioy the daintinesse of the colde that it doth make, which is a thing that cannot be expressed and the vnderstanding of man cannot comprehend it.
They which may liberally drinke cold being made cold with snow, are such as be temperate of co~plection full of flesh, those which are of a cholerike complection, hot inffamed, the which are whot of the liuer, and of the stomake, they which are sanguine and doe exercise the~selues and labour as men of great buzinesse, they which haue many cares, the gouernours of cities common the ministers of them, which do participate of the like cares and troubles, they which doe exercise themselues in warlike affayres, and other great busines, they which goe much and haue laboured much, they which doe suffer burning Agues, and euils of great heate and inflammations, aboue al, those which are accustomed to drink it herein, let euery man drink cold, or most colde as he hath necessity, and as it is most conuenient for him: to such as it is not conuenient to drink cold, nor most colde, are they that are very old, and such as doe liue idlely, without exercise, and without care, they which haue rawnesse in their stomakes, they which suffer griefes of cold humors, they which are sicke in the breast, they which haue diseases of the sinewes, they which cannot tast that they eate for humors or colde causes, they which doe suffer ventosity, children, and such as are of young age, and others to whom time and vse haue shewed what is conuenient for them.

to the right honourable and truly noble charles lord viscount townshend

much honoured and noble lord

his majesty's proclamation against immoralities and the honourable houses of parliament piously concurring by some good laws to assist and strengthen the ministry

in the suppressing of vice as it gave me a secret pleasure so it did encourage me to frame and preach this following discourse and for exposing this sermon in print to a more publick view
am not without hopes it may do some good upon such as shall cast their eye upon it the discourse being on an argument wherein all good men do agree but more especially it may let some that are in great authority see that there are great lets and hinderances amongst us as to an universal reformation of manners and some of them are such lets and hinderances as only the wisdom of the nation in parliament can remove

and am the more emboldned to make use of your lordship's name and

to crave your patronage not only upon the account of your great honour eminent parts and most agreeable virtue whereby you shine amongst our nobility and do attract the affections of all good men but because great examples are powerful and have a mighty influence to bear down vice and to encourage goodness and am fully persuaded your lordship will in your high place endeavour to promote that great design which this discourse points at which is to promote the true and lasting happiness of our church and state and which can be effected by no other means than by making the almighty god our patron and friend which can only be by depressing wickedness and encouraging piety and universal goodness

and upon these accounts it is that pray for your lordship's health and happiness in this life and your endless glory hereafter and shall always approve my self

your lordship's most honouring most faithful and most obedient kinsman and humble servant clement heigham

let your light so shine before men that they may see your good vvorks and glorify your father which is in heaven

these words have a reference to the three foregoing verses in which our saviour applies himself to his disciples and all sorts of true christians and requires them to set forth the purity of their doctrine and the purity and exactness of their lives to that advantage that by the authority and soundness of their doctrine and goodness of their conversation the nation or the world might be kept from putrefying or stinking
and he compares the christian church to a city set upon a high illustrious place which is easily seen by all that travel near it which city if it be kept clean and beautiful will attract and draw travellers to it but if otherwise it will make them shun and abhor it
wherefore our saviour requires them all to set forth such an eminent light to the world both by their doctrine and sutable life that by their bright shining lustre the thick mists of ignorance and the grosser darkness of sin and wickedness might be dispelled and that others

seeing and beholding this glorious state of the christian church might be invited thereby to glorify their father which is in heaven

these words then of our saviour with respect to their connexion with the former verses do contain first a precept or command to all sorts of christians to preserve pure and sound doctrine and to lead exemplary lives sutable to their holy faith and doctrine
secondly the words contain a powerful argument to enforce good christian practice that others seeing your good lives may glorify your heavenly father or that the ignorant sinful part of the world may receive saving influences by virtue derived from the purity of your doctrine and goodness of your lives and so glory may redound to god

first for the precept or command in general to all sorts of christians to preserve pure and sound doctrine to see that their copy be pure and fair and good and this is of great import for if our faith or any allowed doctrines of our christian society be stained or corrupted especially if ill practice in any kind be the natural consequence of such allowed doctrines or matters of faith this tends to destroy the great end of all religion but god be thanked our articles of faith and the allowed doctrines of our church are sound and good neither

is our publick worship of god corrupted so that the publick assemblies are become schools of idolatry and wickedness as perhaps may be with great truth said concerning some other church that exalts it self and looks big in the eye of the world

here now if time would permit me might take a very fair occasion to represent the faith and doctrine and government of our church which we all own our selves members of and to set forth the purity and soundness of it and shew the agreement of it to all that was owned by the primitive church in its best estate to convince how full it is to all the purposes of a good christian life and to manifest plainly that neither our holy worship and services are corrupted nor doth the church of england give any one license to sin
but this is a large field to enter into and our faith and doctrine and way of worship and government hath been sufficiently set forth and justified by many learned men of our own communion and sealed and confirmed by the blood of holy martyrs

and therefore shall say no more of the copy but shall insist upon that which our faith and doctrine and discipline points at which is to influence all christians so to live as our faith and doctrine and government enjoins them to do and thereby to manifest to the eye of the world the excellency and

goodness of their faith and doctrine by their regular and holy practices for what will a good copy signify to them whose lives do not write after it and so adorn it what doth it signify to talk of a good way of worship if we do not frequent it and join in it as devout worshippers too what doth it signify to commend our holy religion which requires strict sobriety chastity and modesty of life and a due fear and veneration of god and yet at the same time to lie wallowing in the sins that are contrary to all this what doth it signify to commend the government of the church and yet at the same time to despise and disobey it

at the rate that most christians live they do but blot and disgrace their copy tho otherwise never so very beautiful and comely
wherefore then to excite you all to manifest the goodness of your faith and doctrine by your exemplary lives this shall do in the following method
shall urge those motives to good life which our common christianity affords us

and that with respect to this solemn occasion shall point out those several complaints that are made of some special lets and hinderances to an universal good practice amongst us and shall shew

what those lets and hinderances are and what must be the cure and remedy

shall shew that to lead good lives our selves and to remove all those lets and hinderances to others is the only way to bring glory to god honour and reputation to our holy church with safety and prosperity to this nation
then for the motives to good life which our common christianity affords us and to comprize them as short as can

you all know when you were baptized what strict obligations that laid upon you to live well and some of you know what farther additions you have voluntarily made by receiving confirmation at the bishop's hands and after that often receiving the holy communion
and who could now think that any person having passed under all these means of grace should yet be only a christian in title and name let me persuade all such christians if there be any such here present that they live according to their christian profession for it is only so doing that can assure the sincerity of their faith it is only so doing that must inspirit and enliven their hopes of another and better life it is only so doing that can manifest their growth in grace it is only so doing that can assure their victory compleat and that the seed of god abideth prevailingly in their hearts it is only a holy and regular practice that can discover the efficacy of all our means of grace and that the end

of christ's death is answered by us and this alone will convince beholders that we are truly the sons of god and shall be members of the church triumphant in the next life as we are living members of christ here it is this alone that must dispel all our fears and doubts when we come to die and a good christian practice will do it beyond the best confessor in the world
and besides all this a sincere good christian life will help you to find truth and to keep close to it when you have it for indeed it is a love to sin that makes men uncertain in a good religion and tis a godly life that will prove the excellency of your doctrine to others beyond all the best penn'd discourses in the world for a good life is an argument to sense and convinceth the eye of the beholder
man cannot see the heart but we may read men in their lives we know the tree is alive by the fruit
indeed there are many external acts of worship and duty which a mere hypocrite may perform with great applause but when there is a thorow change wrought in our manners from all that is bad to all that is good this is a visible demonstration that the almighty spirit of god hath been working in us and that we are become the children of god when from an intemperate life we are become strictly sober when from malicious haughty and fierce and uncharitable we are come meek and humble and merciful when from the love of the world we are become when from impatience under crosses and troubles we are become resigned and submissive to the will of god in all things and so from all vices to the contrary graces and virtues this

is a visible demonstration of a mighty change wrought in us by the power of god this is a plain discovery that the very body of sin grows weak and is destroyed by a divine omnipotent power and that the grace of god is strong and lively and prevails over all our corruptions

these are the motives that might be enlarged upon to a volume but can only point at those heads which doubt not but you can usefully improve in your own private thoughts and meditations which god grant you all may
now proceed to the second thing proposed which is to point out some special great lets and hinderances to an universal reformation of manners amongst us and these shall set forth by way of complaints and they are such as do require redress and the first complaint that shall mention is


against the guides of our church as if some of these lights did not burn so clear in their conversations as they ought to do
so far as this may be true there ought to be speedy remedies applied nam quo magis quisque eminet eo gravius nocet malo exemplo si se perverse gerit
vult ergo christus apostolos eo majore studio intentos esse ad piè sancté{que vivendum quam quoslibet vulgo obscuros homines quia omnium oculi in eos quasi in lucernas conjecti sunt nec ullo modo ferendos esse nisi vitae integritas doctrinae cujus sunt ministri respondeat
no doubt ministers ought rather to the more strict than other men because the consequence

thereof is greater for it the shepherd wanders no doubt but the sheep will go astray
and besides all this cum pastorum vita merito despicitur eorum doctrina verba consequenter contemnentur
he that leads and idle life may preach with truth and reason as did the pharisees but not as christ or as one having authority

thus speaks the excellent bishop taylor in his rules and advices to the clergy
but come not here as an informer against men of the same sacred character with my self and such as generally speaking are the greatest supporters of religion in this kingdom say the greatest supporters of religion in this nation for with reverence be it spoken to a higher order it is not a triennial light tho shining never so clear that will dispel our darkness but it is these lesser lamps always burning and shining in our villages by holy instructions and godly charitable lives that must dispel our fogs of ignorance and practical wickedness
second complaint is of the want of constant catechizing of children and servants or rather think there is a great want of a useful and profitable way of instructing young people

it is certainly a great mistake to think that merely the asking the questions of the church catechism and receiving the answers will ever make any great improvement

no nor reading an exposition upon some article of faith or other matters this will not do but it is applying our selves particularly to every particular catechized person by practical questions and receiving their answers confirmed by them by proofs of scripture that must settle firm grounds of religion in the hearts of the instructed
and what if ministers would bestow one hour upon a upon this great work and at the same time cast some charity upon the poorer sort to encourage them to come constantly can assure from long experience that they that do this should themselves feel the comfort of it and see the great benefit of their care and labours to the glory of god and the good of many poor christians committed to their charge and do boldly say there is no way like this to plant substantial goodness and to undermine schisms and separations and to preserve the church both pure and in unity and peace
and besides this good effect have seen it encourages the common people to bring up their children to reading and by a sort of emulation amongst themselves it makes young persons to thirst after and improve in divine practical knowledg it prepares them for confirmation and makes them fit to come early to the holy communion yea it cultivates their manners betimes and keeps them from the common vices of the world

third complaint

and that is concerning the of some officers in our spiritual courts as that which

greatly hinders a reformation of manners amongst us
do conceive it is of great moment to the true interests of religion and the service of the church that the chief governours of those courts should watchfully attend the management of business there especially in what concerns the exercise of discipline against offenders
have made it my observation for many years that wherever have lived some tolerable care hath been taken for the cleansing and repairing of our churches but little or no care hath been taken about the living and walking temples to scour off their defilements
betwixt the churchwardens gross negligence in discharging their oaths by making due presentments and the remissness or much worse practice of some inferiour officers of those courts there has been done little service so far as could see either to the reclaiming of any offenders or to the deterring any persons from the too customary sins of the world nor do see how any great good can be expected where churchwardens seldom or never consult their ministers about their presentments
nor do the spiritual courts consult with the ministers about the most proper way of dealing with lapsed christians but matters relating to offenders are either secretly hudled up and it is to be feared sometimes corruptly too or if there be a publick penance there is such a trifling management in the execution of it as that it carries no weight nor produceth any effect but turns all into a ridicule but in special as to commutations of penance there hath been great swerving from the rule
am not so vain as to censure and condemn in the general all private penances

or commutations of penance when they are done as the canon directs and thereby are made serviceable to the interests of true piety and charity but when they are made use of only to scrue the purse of the offenders and to satisfy the private greedy humor of some inferior officers who suck no small advantage to themselves by such secret as hath been done you must give me leave to tell you such practices become not christian courts but so far as this charge amounts to they are scandals and grievances and ought to be reformed

these spiritual courts ought to strengthen and assist the ministry in their great work that such as are too hard and rocky for our spiritual weapons may be broken and subdued by them to repentance or cut off and cast out wholly as rotten members by the sacred and dreadful censures of the church
fourth complaint

the fourth great complaint is against the main body of christians as if there were almost a total eclipse a general failure in the morals of persons in our christian communion
the king and the houses of parliament do observe that wickedness hath advanced amongst us and they do wisely discern what calamities and mischiefs a great dissolution of manners will bring upon this church and nation and therefore they are labouring by good laws to stem the tide and to stop the great inundations of wickedness that threaten to everflow and drown us

and god knows our danger is very great for such whose eyes can reach but to a small compass cannot but see the drunkenness the uncleanness the swearing the lying the killing the stealing and what not in some places or other of the nation and therefore needs must the land mourn hosea
yea so deeply radicated are some sins so strengthen'd by custom so emboldned by the numbers offending and so confirmed by impunity that could the pulpit breath fire upon such as those it could not melt them into better manners
and besides all this that which take to be the completion of this nation's misery is this that parish officers constables and churchwardens especially whose oaths oblige them to bring delinquents to just punishhment they are content to complement away their oaths and their souls too for good neighbourhood sake they can wipe their mouths and cry all is well tho they cannot but see and know if they were not wilfully blind how by the wicked lives of many under their inspection god is provoked christianity is wounded and scandalized and by the ill examples of most the good dispositions of others are corrupted and wickedness is propagated to the great dishonour of god and reproach of our holy religion
wherefore as this occasion invites me will give my friendly advice to and shall speak my mind almost in the very words of that noble divine mr george herbert
in his book of advices to the countrey ministers amongst many other good instructions he counsels all ministers in their respective cures to let their churchwardens know that the

great care and charge of the parish lies upon them and indeed the whole order and discipline of the parish is put into their hands
if the minister reforms any thing it is out of the overflowing of his conscience whereas the churchwardens are to do it by command and by oath
by the laws of the kingdom the churchwardens are to levy penalties for negligence in resorting to church or for disorderly carriage in time of divine service
and may add that by your present articles of enquiry you are to present the gross immoralities of offenders

but as the same excellent mr herbert goes on it is the greatest honour of this world says he to do god and his chosen service or as david says to be a in the house of god
now the canons being the rule you are to read or hear them read often as also the visitation articles which are grounded upon the canons that so you may know your duties and keep your oaths the better in which regard considering the great consequence of your places and more of your oaths you are by no means to spare any tho never so great but if after gentle and neighbourly admonitions they still persist in ill you are to present them for your obligations to god and your own souls are above any temporal tie any worldly respects
do well and right and let the world sink

and indeed unless will be watchful to discover offenders and then perform their oaths

all hopes of a general reformation of manners must be at an end and the land must still groan under the burden of wickedness

fifth complaint is concerning the great want of among the generality of christians and the not imploying the profitably in our houses as well as in the church

next to the sacred ministry there is nothing would conduce more to the reforming a corrupt world and to the keeping up a due sense of god and serious religion than the due care of masters and mistresses and parents to discharge all that duty which both nature and grace teacheth them that is to pray in and with their families and to instruct them and to restrain and govern those children and servants that are under their care and charge
and if those housholders whose daily necessities will not allow them much time for these imployments upon the other days of the week would imploy the carefully both in the publick assemblies and in their private houses to benefit themselves and those that belong to their care we might then hope to see sin restrained and goodness universally planted but until families shall become nurseries of religion and and shall become like little churches and sacred places both for good instruction and holy worship no great reformation is to be expected
some may perhaps call this puritanism but call it

what they will take it to be an infallible truth that it is exemplary godliness that can only restore and preserve the church

sixth complaint is of the sacrilegious inclinations of persons in our communion and that which unavoidably follows the making the church poor is the contempt of the sacred function
but this may seem to some a very remote hinderance as to the reforming the world but it is not so for what great things can be expected where the ministers maintenance is either wholly precarious or if it be settled by law it is very strait poor and necessitous and a mean or precarious livelihood too often cramps the tongue of the preacher and makes it afraid to speak plain and what is worse it hinders study and begets servile and base compliances and in plain english scandalous livings too often make scandalous priests and where it is so what reformation can there be hoped for our greatest and best men saw this mishief long ago and that not only churchmen but some others of great name

and here cannot but mention one a great light and prelate of our church the famous bishop jewel
in a sermon of his before the then queen we have these words

what may be guessed at their intent who decay the provisions of the house of god and so basely esteem the ministers of the gospel altho in other things they do well altho they seem

to rejoice at the prosperity of sion and to seek the safety of the lord's anointed yet needs must it be that by these means foreign power shall again be brought in upon us such things shall be done unto us as we before suffered in the times of popery
and saith the same bishop jewel the parsonages and vicarages are the very castles and towers of defence for the lord's temple and if they be not better furnished with a due maintenance and made more secure against contempt we must expect god's judgment upon us and this noble realm shall be subject to foreign nations

these words to me are very remarkable as falling from so great a man wish they were not prophetical but yet when all is said tis not to be expected that the contempt of the ministry should wholly cease
for the sacred order by their office being bound to cry down the ways of sin which corrupt nature cries up the work of the ministry being to promote sobriety righteousness and holiness and to plant those graces in the hearts and lives of men which corrupt nature and the devil strive against this is so unthankful a work to irritate and disturb mens consciences as close and sound preaching must needs do to press against the bent of mens strong inclinations and to commend to them what they most hate this is a work which will not procure to him much honour and esteem that is imployed in it in this irreligious age
and our saviour hath told us long ago what we must expect from a wicked world if we will be faithful in our places the world cannot

hate you but me it hateth because testify of it that the works thereof are evil

confess it may seem very strange to a thinking man that in a civilized nation a man of god should be despised a man of god by his sacred character and message and whose office it is to guide and conduct souls to heaven
little do christians consider how much they owe to the main body of the despised clergy
by them you are baptized by them you are instructed in all saving knowledg by their prayers your souls do receive aid and assistance from heaven by their prayers judgments are kept off from a people at their hands you often receive the bread of life and by them your departing souls are commended to god and if there were any magistrates here would tell them and justify it too that the peace and prosperity of the kingdom is more owing to the pulpit and an orthodox regular clergy than to all the courts of judicature
tis not the magistrates sword alone that would preserve you if the daily and weekly labours of the ministry did not instil good principles and keep the consciences of men awake and make men more afraid of sin than all your axes and rods can do it is the ministers labours that dispel that ignorance so far as it is dispelled amongst us it is the ministers faithful labours that break the force of mens corruptions and make them more dutiful to god and submissive to their governours

and therefore if the parsonages and vicarages be the very castles and towers of defence for the lord's temple and the greatest security for the state too sure then it highly concerns all orders of men to assist and protect them and to contribute all they can to secure them from contempt and to strengthen them in their great work of promoting religion and depressing vice and all manner of wickedness

have now done with the great lets and hinderances of an universal reformation of manners and it is no difficult thing to point out what must be the cure


a devout faithful and laborious ministry supported with a due maintenance and made more secure against contempt

the officers of parishes must be such as fear god and that understand the weight of an oath and the great consequences of discharging it

family religion must be kept up

children and servants must be well instructed

the spiritual courts must give their utmost assistance to the ministry

a religious magistracy must give their helping hand to punish vice and encourage goodness

and when all these shall mutually conspire to promote the great ends of religion we may then hope for a new face of things we may then hope for a new earth wherein dwelleth righteousness we shall then behold the kingdom of our lord and saviour exalted amongst us which is the hearty desire of all good men

proceed now to my third an last point which is to shew that to lead good lives our selves and to remove all those lets and hinderances which keep others from doing the same is the only way to bring glory to god honour and reputation to our holy church and true happiness and safety to our church and nation


then to promote universal goodness by our living well and discouraging vice brings glory to god as it doth sensibly and experimentally commend the ways of god to a poor ignorant brutish world it lets the world see that the ways of religion are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace
a good christian life as it gives inward joy to the practiser so it sweetly insinuates a good liking into the beholders it strangely attracts the affections of others and by a secret invisible force it charms the passions and delights the beholders
the glorious attire of christian graces such as meekness humility and modesty of mind fervent piety to god and as fervent charity to man undisguised friendship sincerity in all our dealings evenness and equality of mind in all conditions and estates of our

life conquest over passions contempt of the world and sollicitousness for nothing but to keep up and maintain a joyful entercourse betwixt god and our souls such a divine temper as this doth strangely affect and attract and must insinuate a good relish into all beholders and it is my firm belief that were persons that are of a good communion but more exact in their lives to the reformed copy that is before them it would mightily supercede the necessity of much writing to justify and recommend our way of worship for were mens inward corruptions more subdued by the force of that religion which they profess we should find little to do but to love god and love one another and the sweet relish which ever attends a conscientious life would so confirm and settle good christians in their way that they would never doubt or stagger and many other beholders that are unsteddy and unresolved would be more easily drawn to join with that communion of christians where they see a divine presence and force and so much comfort as a good life produceth than by all other arguments in the world

and this leads to a second consideration to enforce good christian practice in our selves and to discourage vice in others


for it shews our principles to be sound and good and that we firmly assent to them as such it convinceth the world that our doctrine and way of worship is from god this men will be apt to believe

when they see the powerful and visible influences of it in the change of mens manners from bad to good this satisfies men beyond all other arguments that there is a divine presence amongst us and that there is a special assistance and blessing concurring with the means of grace that we make use of and it doth most plainly evince that god's grace is not bestowed upon us in vain
would to god that this most excellent argument for so the primitive christians accounted it were not so much lost as it is as to its due force upon beholders by the bad examples of too many christian professors
those first and best christians could boast of the truth the goodness and excellency of their religion and soundness of their doctrine from the admirable efficacy and power it had upon the hearts and lives of those that recieved it
all this is plain from some memorable passages in lactantius book de falsa sapientia and also in several places of origen too long here to be recited

but it brings glory to god and great good to others as it demonstrates our religion to be a practicable thing and that the hardest duties may be performed
arguments alone will hardly invite the generality of people to serious and strict religion where good examples are wanting yea examples will persuade more effectually than all the best framed arguments in the world for men love to see whether the ways be passable or no before they adventure themselves especially where flesh and blood tells them there are some difficulties to encounter some rocks and uneasinesses to climb over and that they may

happen to meet with much ill usage too in their journy to heaven even from such as pretend to be friends and
but when men shall see by the courage and victory and good examples of others that commend these ways of religion that the worst of difficulties may be overcome and are so by the same flesh and blood with themselves this animates and enlivens their spirits and takes off all objections arising in their minds from the difficulty of the attempt


a good life and discouraging of vice brings glory to god as it declares to the world that we stedfastly believe that without a regular piety and strict obedience to the laws of christ none shall be saved
this will visibly discover to the world what our belief is and what our opinions are this will manifest that we entertain no corrupt and dangerous principles and we our selves might appeal to this as a test if our lives were but regularly pious and uniformly good for a heresy or dangerous error in the judgment will for the most part appear in the practice of him that owns it
and let me tell you it will not be easy to convince any one that our judgments in matters of religion are sound if our morals are bad and of this am sure that few will be convinced that we believe a good life to be absolutely necessary to salvation if we do not lead good lives our selves and shew also by our zeal our dislike of wickedness in others


and lastly a thorow reformation of manners

brings glory to god as it gives the almighty a free occasion to manifest himself in that great attribute he most delights in which is in shewing mercy to a sinful nation and disposing all things for the happiness and safety of it
god will never look favourably upon us until our crying sins be removed and therefore if we do believe that there is a divine governing providence which blesseth or chastiseth a nation according as they either fear or dishonour him we must then believe that all our private and publick happiness and safety will depend upon our holy living and discountenancing vice
your very safety and prosperity in any kind rests move upon this basis than upon all our wisest counsels or the force of arms and the very safety and reputation of our church both at home and abroad depends upon a thorow reformation of manners yea the peace and honour and prosperity of your families depends upon it and what is much more valuable am sure your inward peace and comfortable hopes of another life rests upon your regular good christian practice
in a word your baptism requires it and the care of your childrens souls and others of your family exacts this duty of you to live well your selves and to discourage sin in others
and for many of you that hear me must plainly tell you that your very offices and solemn oaths do bind you to prosecute the wicked doers and to all of you say your allegiance to god and the king exacts all this at your hands

wherefore let the sum of our thoughts bend this way let this be the chief end of all our study learning

and reading let this be the end of all our preaching and praying and counselling and reproving and correcting to save our own souls and the souls of others
then will the almighty shine upon us and give us his blessing and all europe shall behold and see that we are not only mighty in battel but mighty in prayer too and shall be forced to confess that god is with us and on our side because by due fearing and serving him we are become a wise and understanding people

but to conclude

since so august and puissant a prince leads the way since a prince mighty in battel to defend and protect us is neither afraid nor ashamed to engage himself resolutely under the despised banner of the cross and to fight christ's battels against the corruptions of a wicked world and commands us all not only to live well but to attend and assist him in our several offices and places to discourage and suppress the corruptions of the age we live in do take it to be a special and signal call from heaven to you all to join unanimously in this great work of endeavouring to amend a corrupt world
and if any magistrates or inferior officers shall neglect to prosecute his majesty's pious intentions they will have a great deal to answer for not only to the king but to the great god the king of kings and they will bring the guilt of others sins upon themselves and the whole nation for the connivance of governours makes the sins of private persons the sins of the community and altho the punishment of private persons

or particular men may be deferred to a future state yet communities as such as one well expresseth it having no resurrection in the world to come they may justly expect the fruits of their delinquencies in this present life

but because it cannot be hoped or expected that so great a work as the reforming a polluted age can be brought to any great effect unless all that have the least stamp of authority upon them shall put their helping hand to this great work unless parents and masters of families shall begin at home unless ministers and magistrates and all inferior shall conspire and conjoin in this glorious work let us therefore pray to almighty god that he would inspire the hearts of all orders and estates of men in this our holy church that every member of the same in his place and office spiritual or civil may gird themselves with a true christian zeal and courage to countenance goodness and to bring all wickedness into a just shame and contempt that so god may be glorified and many souls saved and that god may delight to dwell amongst us and that we may all rejoice and be glad in the peace and prosperity of our church and state
deo gloria

now the god of peace that brought again from the dead our lord jesus christ that great shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will working

in you that which is well pleasing in his sight through jesus christ to whom be glory for ever and ever
amen

grant we beseech thee almighty god that the words we have heard this day with our outward ears may through thy grace be so grafted inwardly in our hearts that they may bring forth in us the fruit of good living to the honour and praise of thy name through jesus christ our lord
amen
the peace of god which passeth all understanding keep your hearts and minds in the knowledg and love of god and of his son jesus christ our lord and the blessing of god almighty the father the son and the holy ghost be amongst you and remain with you always
amen

And euery one of them bostid the~ of the lordes word, wold be Christians, althought yt the most parte of these fore rehersed sectes, hath not reaceauyd nether word nor sprit nor no christian lerninge, therfore ar they so ready to persecute them that hath the word sprite life, but what helpes it, it hath bene thus from the begynnyng, yt the spiritual chyldryn of God muste suffer of the fleshelye, as Abell of Caine, Isaac of Ismaell, Iacob of Esau and the spiritual chyldren of Israell of the fleshely.
For before it pleased God to restore in to thys Realme (by youre

Â¶To the (right) Congregation of God of whiche your grace is supreame heade next immediatlye vnder God.
MY dearlye beloued in christ Iesu, lerne wyth Chryste Iesus, and that out cho+sen vessell saynt Paull yt all they that are Baptysed thorowe the holy goost, and is become one body that is one congregatyon of God,
or holye churche withoute spot or wrincle or anye such thynge, buylded vpon the fundacio~ of the Apostles Pro+phetes, Iesus Christ himselfe being the hed corner stone in whom whatsoeuer
buyldynge is coupled togyther it groweth vnto an holy Temple in the Lorde in whom ye also ar buylded togyther to be an habytacyon of God throwe the holy goost,
gathered out of Iewes and Grekes men and women fre and bonde.
Yea say gathered out of al the chyldre~ of God, whiche is strowed in all the hole worlde and is become a true bride of Iesu chryste.
These saye that are thus borne from aboue out of God ye father whiche new byrthe must be alonly throw ye frutful sede that is Goddes worde.
For our fyrst byrth whiche is out of our fyrst father Ada~ is hole blind defe wythout vndersta~dinge in god+lye knowledge,
Therfore yf we wyll be partakers of the Lordes table, we muste be borne anewe oute of the frutful
sede of gods worde they ar co~uerted and changed out of infyde+lite to fidelite out of earthly into hea+uenly out of flesh into spirit out of vnryghteousnes into ryghteousnes out of euel into good, yea out of the earthly Adam into the heauenly Adam which is Iesus.
These are like fasshioned vnto the shape of Iesus Chryst,
whiche is the fyrst be gotten amonge many brethren and walkes as he hath walked, these are the ryght brethren of Iesus Chryst borne with him from aboue oute of god the father and is like mindid as he, these are the newe Eua, the clean chast bryde of Iesus Christ flesh of his flesh and bones of hys bones.
These crucifie the fleshe with lust desier these haue rightly buryed ther synnes wyth hym in Baptime and ar risen with him in a new lyfe these are vpryghtly Baptised throwe the holy gost with all the true members
of Christ in that vndefiled bodye of Iesu Chryste that is his congregacio,
these ar thei yt haue put one christ and prynte him out in ther lyuing.
These seekes nothynge in all there thoughtes wordes and workes, but the prayse of god and the saluation of ther brethren,
they loue them that hates them, they do good for euell, they pray for them that persecute the~ they are troden out of al fleshly lust and desires as couetuousnes pryde, vncleanlynes whordom backbiting sclaunderyng, enuye, murther, theft, glottony, false holynes, and al Idolatry.
There meditacion is day and nyght in the lawe of ye Lord they reioyse in good and ar sadde in euill.
They render not euell for euell, but much more good for euell, they seke not there owne profyte, but that is, there neyghbours profect bothe in soule and body.
They giue meate to the hungry, drinke to the thursty, clo+thes
the naked, herber the herberles delyuer prisoners, they viset the sicke comforte the comfortles, they in+struct them that go astraye, yea they set there liues for there brethren like as our Sauiour Iesu Chryste the Prophetes and Apostles haue done there thoughtes are chast, ther wordes are truth and with salt be sprin+kle, ye that is ye, and nay is nay, al ther workes are donne in the feare of god.
To suche a congregacyon, is lice~sed to haue the Communio~ of our Sauiour Iesus Christes body and blood as here after shalbe declared.
The Lord Iesus the same night in whych he was betrayed toke brea+de and whan he had gyuen thankes he brake it and said take ye and eate this is my body which is broken for you,
this do ye in the remembrau~ce of me, after ye same maner also toke he the cuppe when supper was done
saying this cuppe is the new Testa+ment in my blud, this do ye as often as ye drinke it in remembraunce of me, and they haue dronke al here of.
These are the worde wt which christ hath instituted his holi supper, with which wordes, ye learned of ye world haue wonderfullye foughte~, and wt in few yeres haue shede much innocent blood for it, when they counted the~ selues wyse, they became fooles, for ye pryncipallest in this they haue not towched,
We haue not one title that commau~des vs yt we shuld dispute of it, but that we shuld be di+ligent, that we myght be found wor+thy, to be partakers of the declaracio~ and benefite, that is receaued in it, as S. Paul teacheth let euery man examin himselfe and so let him eate of the breade and drynke of the cuppe. &c.
hye disputacio~, where throw diuisio~ commeth desyring the lord alwayes that we myght be found worthy receauers of it according to the lordes commaundement.
Â¶This holy supper, hath our saui+our Iesus christ left behind him vn+der,
bread and wine saying take and eate, this is my body whych is geue~ for you, this do in the remembrau~ce of me.
In whiche holye Supper is declared, vnto vs. Fyrst ye vnsearchable fauoure and loue of our lorde Iesus Christ, which is come in this world, not to co~dempne ye world, but that the worlde throwe hym myght be saued.
wonderful loue of god he hath sent no Angel no Patriarke nor pro+phet,
he is come him selfe in ye simulitude of synfull fleshe.
Ye he which knew no synne made himselfe to be sinne for vs, that we by hys meanes shuld be that righteousnes whyche
before god is alowed, not that christ is any suche synne (that be farre) He was that Lambe without spot whiche did do synne,
but he was that frewilling offring for synne as Esay as sayeth he was wonded for our offences and smitte~ for our wic+kednes, he is offred, for so it hath pleased him, therfore is he called sin that is an offering for synne.
almyghtiful god, who can kepe in secrete, the vnmeasurable grace mercy declared vpon vs,
miserable synners but must breake out and co~+fesse the afore the whole worlde, wt mouthe and worke, lyfe and soule, Saynt Paul teacheth that god spa+red not hys owne sonne,
but gaue him for vs all, yea whylle we were yet synners and vngodlye.
Christe dyed for vs the righteous for the vn+righteouse, ye ye vndefiled offer lame is brente throwe the glowynge fyer
of loue vpon the Iebett of the crosse yea the creatoure of all creatures, is broken frome aboue to beneth, yea he that is farer then the chyldren of men hath neyther bewty nor fauour he is dispised and abhored of al men yea he is suche a man as full of sorowe,
and as one that hath good experyence of infyrmytes, yea he is rekened amonge the transgressors, the innocent must beare the hole falte of Adam, as ye Prophet sayeth.
All this hath our sauyour declared vnto vs not throw our deseruynge but as Saynte Paule learneth the kyndnes and loue of our sauyoure god to man warde apered not by ye dedes of ryghteousnes whiche we wrought, but accordyng to his mercy he saued vs,
nor mercy, nor no remyssion of synnes by the father, vnto the tyme that our sauiour Iesu Chryst hade
For as by one mans dysobedyence many became synners, so by the obedyente of one shal manye be made ryghteous.
Nowe for asmuche as when he was in the shape of God,
made him selft of no reputacyon goen out of hym selfe, and wher he was immortall, is be come mortall takinge vpon hym the shape of a seruaunte, to the intent that he myght serue vs al and was founde in hys apperell as a man very fleshe and bloud and in all thynges lyke vnto his brethren,
sauynge synne, he humbled hym selfe and became obedyent vnto his father vnto death, euen the deathe of the Crosse, throwe whiche death it pleased the father, that in hym shulde all fulnes dwell and by hym to reconcile all thinges to him selfe and to set at peace by him throw the bloude of his Crosse, both thinges
in heauen and thynges in earth and is become an offerynge and sacryfyce of swete sauour to god his dear+ly beloued father.
This is frutefully declared vnto vs in this holy Supper namely throw that breade that fleshe that he hathe geuen for vs,
and throwe ye Cuppe that bloud whiche he shede for manye, for ye remyssyon of synnes, and shall be vnto vs a remembraunce tyll he come.
Nowe bycause that it is a come~ vse that a token of remembraunce hath the name of the thing that is reme~bred by it.
Therfore hathe Chryste called the breade hys bodye, and the wyne his bloude, not that he is in substance in breade and wyne,
Lykewyse as the Easter Lambe was called the passynge by, and yet was it not in it selfe the very passi~g by, but a token of remembraunce of the passinge by.
the Earster lambe hath the name of the thyng that the Israelites remem+bred by it, and wherby they myght euerlastingly kepe in remembraunce the benefytes of god therfore it is conuenyent that Chryst called the breade hys bodye and the vyne hys bloude, because that we shulde remember therby his death and passio~ yea the onely sacrifyce of his bodye whiche he hathe suffered to be broken, and his bloude to be shede for vs, not the materyall bodye of Chryst is in the bread nor his bloud in the vyne.
Yet neuertheles is the supper of our Lorde a partakynge spiritually of the bodye and bloude of Chryste,
as Sainte Paule saieth is not the cuppe of thankes gyuing wherwyth we gyue thankes a pertakinge of the bloud of Chryst; and the breade that we breake; is it not the partaking of the bodye of christ and to the intente that this may the
more playnely appere vnto your vn+derstandinge, ye shall se the comparyson betwex the Paschall Lambe and our sacramente.
The Pascall Lambe was instytuted and eaten the nyght before the chyldren of Israell were delyuered frome Egypte.
Lykewyse was the sacramente instituted and eaten the nyght before we were delyuered fro~ oure synnes.
The Pascall Lambe was a very lambe in dede, and so ye sacramente is very bread in dede.
The Pascal Lambe was called the passynge by of the Lorde, which destroyed the power of Pharao, and delyuered them.
The Sacramente is called the bodye of ye Lord which destroyed the power of the deuell delyuered vs.
The chyldre~ of Israell were but ones delyuered frome Egypte notwythstandyng they dyd eate euery yere ye Lambe to kepe ye dede in perpetual remembrau~ce, eue~ so Chryst bought redemed vs but
once for al, although ye sacramente therof be dayly broke~ among vs to kepe the benefyt in continuall memorye.
As many as dyd eate ye pascall lambe in fayth beleued goddes worde as touchyng ther delyueraunce frome Egypte ware as sure thorowe fayth as they were sure of ye lambe by eatyng it.
So as many as do eate this sacrament in fayth beleue godes worde as touchinge ther delyueraunce frome sinne are as sure of ther delyueraunce throw fayth as they are sure of the breade by eati~g it.
Nowe se ye what ye pascal lambe was to ye Israelytes, what ye sacrament is vnto vs. So ye saint Paule witnesseth clerly, yt the faithful eate the body of Chryst spyrituallye vnder the breade and wine, As a bryde receaueth her housba~d with a ryng euen so receaueth ye faythful chryst to be his owne euerlastyng saluacio~, where as diuers writers
wyl haue that the bodylye presence shuld be in ye breade is a great misunderstandyng of Gods word, yea it is agreable to ye Papistes or Anti+christes doctrine, whych is contrary both to our fayth and al hole scripture.
For we beleue and holye Scripture beareth witnes, that Chryste, after his resurrection is ascendid vp into heauen,
and sitteth vpo~ ye right hand of his almyghty father, and a+bydeth there as concernyng his bodyly presence.
But speritually hath he promysed to abide with vs in his worde to the ende of the worlde.
And seyng now that our Sauiour Christ as concernynge hys bodylye presence abydeth at the right hand of his father, so can nor maye not the bodye of Chryste be in the breade, and agayne it is agaynst al truth ye Christ at one time hath bene
Furthermore we dayly see what dredful Idolatry is spronge out of ye carnall vnderstan+dynge of thys words of christ.
This is my body yet dayly springeth to the great abomynable sclaunder of ye honour of god, so ye men worshyp a pece of brede, for ther god whych is growen in the ground, broken in the myl, and baked in an yrong, yea and hold that to be there maker.
And ye do yet as the Papistes locke hym in gold and syluer, not remembrynge what Paul Stephen wytnesseth sayng.
The most hiest wyl not dwel in Temples yt are made wyth mens hande take hede we haue mocked long ynough wyth God and his ho+ly worde,
Secondarly we are exhorted in this holy supper to ye vnitye loue concorde yt is in ye congregacio~ of god, because yt we (though we be many)
yt is one body in Christ Iesu like as S. Paul sayeth we many are one body and one breade in as much as we al are partakers of one bread.
For like as the members of one body are not in stryfe one agaynst another but in charitable vnite sarueth one another So may ther be no strife nor debate in the congregacion of God.
They must al speake one thyng ther must be no dissension among the~ hauyng one hart, one soule, one mynd, one meanyng.
There may be no strife in the fayth, but yt in mekenes of mind euery man esteme other better than himselfe to the prayse of God and to the alouyng and faythful seruice of all the chyldren of god.
For likewise as the outward members of one bodye wyl gladly co~forte helpe serue another, so doth ye congregacyon of god, yf one suffer, al suffers wt him If one be had in honour al is glad.
Also euery man shall serue his brother both bodyly and gostli likewise as our sauiour Iesus Christe hathe serued vs both wt his life and death not onely to deal wt them, gold,
syluer land and house Kowe, calfe or any such thing,
but ye bludy laboure yt we get wt our owne ha~des so ye no ma~ shuld only care take thought for him selfe and not care nor looke vpon his brothers lake, but the one must helpe the other in al things necessarie where he can or may,
and no ma~ must seke that, yt is his, but euery one the others welth.
And likewise as of ye graynes of corne, can not be baken breade,
but throw fyer, euen so can not the congregacion be a ryght spirituall lyfe (wherof paul speaketh) but through bunrnynge loue and charytye and so the Chrystyan congregatyon to be one lofe for lykewyse as many graynes are Sowen,
that breade shuld be baken of them so soweth the great father of ye housholde hys precious wheate into the aker or ground of this world to the inte~t that they shuld become one lofe and also vse the supper of the Lorde ryghtlye after the wordes of Paule we many are one breade and one bo+dye in as moch as we are partakers of one breade,
for as the body is one and hath many members, and all ye members of the body though they be many yet are but one bodye euen so is chryst.
Ye at the body of christ and members one of another.
For god hath ordeyned in ye congregacion some Prophets, some Apostles and some to beleeuers and hirdes.
Let no man bost himselfe of hys byrth, lernyng Ryches, for as we are manye members in one body and al me~bers haue not one office.
in Chryste and euery man amonge our selues one anothers members.
Seinge that we haue dyuerse gyftes accordynge to the grace that is gyuen vnto vs.
If anye man haue the gyfte of Prophesye, let hym haue it that it be agreynge to the faith Let hym that hath an offyce wayte on hys offyce,
If any man gyue let hym do it with synglenes let hym that rewleth do it with dilige~ce.
If anye man shewe mercye let hym do it wyth cherfulnes, and let loue be amonge you wythoute dyssimulation,
and euerye man abyde in the same state wherin he is called, no nother wyse than to the edifyenge of the bodye of Chryste, whyche is hys congregation.
a remembraunce of the death of our Sauiour Iesus Christe whiche he suffred for vs,
Secondarlye it is an instruction of the pure cleane vndefyled loue, whych is amonge the congregation of god lyke as haue declared afore as ye breade is made of manye Cornes, and is one bread and as the Wyne is made of manye Grapes, and yet is one wine so are we many me~bers and but one bodye, whiche is christ.
My dearly beloued in Christ Iesu, let euery man se earnestly to, and proue himselfe accordynge to saynt Paules learnynge, that he come not to the table of the Lorde, bicause yt it hathe bene so accustomed eyther throwe fayned holynes or desyre of worldly honour or disceat, but oute of a pure cleane and vndefyled hart and so eate of the bread and drinke of the cuppe for he that eateth or
For al they that wyl come sit at ye lords Table,
they must be founde faythful mercyful, louynge, kynde, pytyfull and obedyente, wythout diuision wythout hatred, wythout pride wythout couetousnes, that wicked eye muste be plucked out, that flesh muste be mortyfyed, that euell hearynge eare stopped, that clattering tounge tamed, that fleshelye harte cyrcumsiced youre blouddy handes clensed, your belyes measured, and your fete compelled wyth the Lords word, ye must haue afrewilling batayll agaynste the Deuel,

He must be well veaponed wyth the shylde of fayth wherwith he maye quence all the fyery dartes of Sathan,
he must haue on ye helmet of saluacyon, and be gyrded with the swerd of ye sprete, which is ye worde of god, he must be a me~ber serueable and prophetable accordi~g to his power, he must be mynded lyke vnto oure sauyoure Iesus Chryst, as he was what time he kepe this holye supper or communyo~ wt his derely beloued brethren.
He toke breade and wyne and gaue thankes gaue it to his disciples sayde, this is my bodye and my bloude whiche is broken for youe herewyth declarynge his godly loue,
fauoure and mercy vpon his derely beloued brethren, euen as though he would say my derely beloued chyldren, so farre hath youre loue led me, and your fa+uoure drawen me, that haue forsaken
the dominyon of my heauenly father and hathe taken vpon me to be come youre seruaunte to serue you in all thynges,
bycause saye that ye were all as scattered shepe goynge astraye,
and that there was no man that sought youe, but that ye were all meate to the grypinge, and ryuenge wolues, and that there was no man to delyuer youe.
But that ye were wonded vnto death that there was no man to playster you.
Therfore am come out of ye bosome of my father become lyke vnto my brether a straunger a seruaunt, a worme and no man, a very scorne of men and the outcast of peo+ple, wandrynge in this wylde wyldernes of this world haue sought you in cytes countres, vpo~ mountaynes vayelles, myserable haue founde you.
Dume, Deafe blind Cryple, Pore and naked, my seruice haue declared vpon you, youre
synnes, haue repreued your febelnes, haue borne, yea haue caryed you vpo~ my shulders into my fathers house,
haue deliuered you out of ye mouthes of hellyshe lyons, and beares your foull stynkynge wondes, haue so softly healed the peace of my father, haue declared vnto you, your nakednes haue clothed, and youre pouertye haue healped.
haue gyue~ vnto you fete hartes, eyes, eares, and mouthes, to walke to vnderstande, to knowe, to heare, and to speake the wordes of euerlastynge lyfe.
haue brought you into the knowledge of al ryghteousnes, haue learned you the wyll of my heauenly father.
And to the intente that ye maye know that am the true messenger of my father, so haue declared it vnto you by my great wonders and myraeles Se nowe my derely beloued childre~ nowe is my houre come, the is ful ended, now yt can serue
serue you no longer, wyth my lyfe learninge, nowe wyll laste of all serue you with my fleshe and bloud and bytter death, For this cause am come amonge you, and leaue you this breade and this cuppe, yt whensoeuer ye shal come togither, ye shal vse it in ye remembrau~ce of me, say dearly beloued brethre~ in christ Iesu we yt are here congregated together in ye lordes name,
this bread this cuppe hath our sauiour Iesu christ lefte behind him, yt we shuld remember him therby.
how fre~dely hath our sauiour Iesu chryste serued vs both wt his lyfe death, declaring here in eating this bread drinking this cuppe,
yt we shulde folowe his blissed example seruyng one another lyke as one me~ber another wt prayer, wt learning wt instructo~, wt com+pelling, wt reproufe, wt mercy, wt loue all nedefull necessares as we haue fou~d i~ our sauiour Iesu christ towerd vs.
so haue we godes worde, and promyse a spirytuall ioye myrth coumfort of the house of Israell,
so reioses the congregacion of God in that beutyfull bryde knowenge well that ye broken bread is a pertakynge of ye bodye of christ and the cuppe of blyssing, a partakynge of the bloude of Chryst whiche is shede for manye for the remycyon of synnes.
what gloryous banket is this where in the hungrye soule, the inwarde man recayueth that inuysible breade heaue~ly foode which is christ Iesus.
glorious co~gregacio~ wherin ar no sha~ful songes nor vnprofytable wordes, saue al onely brotherlye instruction and geuynge thankes to our sauyour Iesu christ gloryous congregacion wher no wanton eyes is casting here there but all bente to the helpe and comfort
glorious congregacio~ wherin men vse not to drynke, dans, nor play, but wher me~ are dronke in the wysdome of god, there shall the soule be ioeful in the holy ghoste playeng, and daunsing afore the Lorde.
My derely beloued in Chryst Iesu, ye that are so dearly bought with the precyous bloud of our sauyour Iesus chryst, wake vp leaue of it is more the~ tyme, feare the lordes worde, and fle from the deuilles table, for this is no supper of the Lorde, whiche the blinde vnlearned Papystes haue learned and vsed to this tyme, no saye it is no supper of our lorde,
whiche is ministred and soulde of an Antychrystes teacher a Sodomitical begger a ba+bylonysh marchande, the whiche yf he do not repente and amend, is euerlastyngly cursed and banysshed from the prestes of god.
be ministred of hym that is called of a Chrystian congregacion compelled throw the holy ghost to come in to the Lordes vyneyarde, or heuenly haruest which is founde without faute, accordynge to the declaracion of godes worde, both in his lyfe and learning.
It is no supper, that is receaued of dronkerdes, fornycatours worshyppers of Images,
aduouteres, weakelyng abusers of them selues with the mankind theues couetous, cursed speakers, murtherers, traytours, and shedders of innocent bloude.
But it is a supper to them ye walkes afore God, and the worlde in loue, ioye, peace, long sufferynge, gentylnes, goodnes, faythfulnes, meakenes, and temporaunce, which desyers to spende there fleshe and bloude, for the glory of God.
It is no supper where men haue no other thinge but shryueng, fasting knocking, knelyng, becking bouing, wessyng
with fayre clothes, holding vp of handes and knocking vpon the breast, but to them that is founde with a faithfull, thankefull hearte and a cleane conscience and vnfayned loue.
All they that haue not this faith, loue and is not bound hollie wt the bond of loue, to his neyboure, seruing him in his nede, with al diligence wyl, and likewise set downe at the table of the Lorde.
feare me that he shal receaue with that Hipocrite Iudas not lyfe, but euerlasting death, and eateth and drynketh the communio~ of Balial and not of Christ, though he speake with the tonges of men, Angels and though he coulde prophesy and vnderstand al secretes, and all knowledge,
yf he had faith yt he coulde moue mountaynes, and though he bestowed al his goods to fede ye pore, and though he gaue his
body to be burned, and yet had no loue, it profyteth nothinge, so that he doth not loue out of the verye grounde of his harte, wyth worke truth whiche loue is the verye band of perfectnes,
Therefore exorte euery man that wyll be partakers of the lordes supper,
that he ryghtly proue hymselfe accordyng to Paules learning For all they ye trust vnto ther owne ryghteousnes,
or vpo~ the learnings and commaundeme~tes of men, and not vpon ryghteousnes and deseruynge, and bloude of our sauyour Iesu Chryste, blessed myght he be, and goeth lykewyse to the table of the lord the eateth his owne damnacyon.
Lykewyse all they yt are baptysed and haue gyue~ themselfe wyllingly vnder the false prophetes in heryse vngodlines, and wyll not be reformed, lykewise go to the table
Lykewyse all they that loue better transitori thynges than the glory of God, hys holy worde as golde, syluer, wyfe, children, lyfe and lyuing, and goeth to the table of the lord, he eateth his owne damnacyon.
Lykewyse all they that wyl not gyue them selues frewyllyng to the seruyce of theyr neyghbours wt al that they haue receaued at ye hand of god, viseble and vnuyseble,
and goeth to the table of the Lorde, they eate theyr owne damnacyon.
Lyke wyse he that bosteth himselfe ogai~st his chrysten brother of his Byrth, ryches, wysdome bewty,
or any such thinge and wyl not know that he is a stinkyng Caryon, and foule flesh euel folyshe before the eyes of the lorde, and goeth to the table of the lorde, he eateth his damnacyon, lyke wyse al they that boaste them selues of the name of Chryst and notwyth+standinge
lyues accordinge to the fleshe, as pryde, couetousnes, aduotrye fornication vncleanes wanto~nes, Idolatrye witchecrafte hatred variaunce, zele, wrath, stryfe, sedicio~ sectes, iniurye, murther dronkenes, gluttony and suche lyke, and doth dayly with there cursed vngodly lyfe,
crusifye the sonne of God, and and go lykewyse to the table of the lorde, he eateth his damnation.
For all they that commyte suche thinges shall not meryte the kingdo~ of god.
And therfore are they vnworthye to come to the Supper of the Lorde, because they haue no communio~ of the body and bloude of our sauiour Iesu christ.
No noman may be suffered to come to the holy supper of ye lord, let him be of what state or degre soeuer they be so farre forth as hys iniquite and sinne is manifest and knowen to the congregacion,
which is a communion or congregacion of the body and bloude of chryst.
he must be excomunicated and cutte of with goddes worde, vnto ye tyme that he do penaunce decleare him selfe to be obedient to the gospell of our sauiour Iesu Christ whiche excomunicacion is manyfest in these Chapters folowinge as in Mat, xvi.x.xvi. i. Cor. v.vi..
Iahn. i. which excom+municacion, yf lyue by the helpe of God wyll set out at large.
But as for them that are inwardly well and couereth themselfe outwardly wt the shininge mantell of holines like as Iudas did wt suche shall the congregaco~ haue nothing to do,
but let ye lorde iudge the~ which is a prouer knower of yt all hartes, for by him nothi~g is hid nor forgotte~, he is ye iudg yt knowes ye hartes mindes shal iudge,
not onli ye euel workes but also Idel wordes, yea yt though and mocion of the harte.
flesh wel and so let hym eate of the bread.
For he that eateth, and drynketh vnworthylye eateth and drynketh his owne damnatyon.
Thus hathe our sauiour Iesus Chryst instituted and ordeyned hys holye supper both in breade and wyne to be a remembrau~ce of his death and passio~ as haue declared afore.
Throwe whyche death and passyon, he hath declared his greate loue towardes vs, and secondlye to a renewinge of loue and cleane holding the congregacio~ of god.
And this is ye only institucion and vse of the supper of our Lorde Iesus christ how he and his Apostles haue vsed it.
mercyfull God haue these vngodly shameles shauelinges altred and chaunged this holy and blessed Supper of our lord into abominable blasphemus Idolatrye, as shall declare here after vnto you.
It is so greuous that shal declare vnto you whyche shalbe nothynge, but the trueth, that euery Chrystian hatte maye tremble and quake at it.
Therfore seke wyth all dyligence ye truth to the intent that ye maye kno+we how pytyfull that we and all the worlde haue synned, agaynste oure Lorde God in this matter.
Fyrste they haue conuerted and chaunued, thys holye and Blessed supper, of our Lord wyth ther false learnynge and auctoritye out of his ryght vse and haue lerned it to be a dayly sacrifice for our sinnes.
This is abominable blasphemy and pitifull blyndnes that men can not ima+gyn such another.
Wyth thys same learnyng haue they driuen Chryste Iesus out of his fathers stoole, out of heauen, and haue set in his place an vngodlye preist wyth a peace of breade, wyth ye same learnyng haue they robed chryst Iesus of his euerlastyng
and perpetual offyce that is the office of an aduocate, and haue put it vpon a pece of breade and a deuylles seruaunt whiche knowes not one title ryght of ye word of god Wyth the same learning haue they made of no value al ye fygures and shyne of Moyses, al the prophicies of the prophittes, al the promyses of Angelles al the hole new Testament whych alonly speaketh of that only sacrifyce for sin,
which is christ Iesus with ye same learnynge haue they take~ vpo~ them al power in hea+uen earth hel. Therfore is ye brede of ye Idolles table broken in thre pe+ces, wt the fyrst pece pacifie the god wyth ye seco~de they pray for ye world with ye thirde they delyuer the soul yt they offer it for, wt this same learni~g ar they risen aloft in gold syluer in pompe lordlines honour by ye hole world herewith ar they climed vp a+boue al princes, haue gotte~ vnto
the~selues gold, syluer, churches cloy+sters land, sand, the highes places name power in al la~des, to ye inte~t yt euery ma~ shuld giue rume to their holynes, feare there name &, highlye prayse ther gloriouse office desiring alwayes, ye throwe this good worke whych is this dayly offringe, yt they myght be co~forted in there soule.
Throw this meanes is yt abominable Anthichryst gotten into his seat so hie yt the Empriours maiestie,
the hiest pote~t vpo~ earth who~ god him self co~maunded to obey must knele downe kysse his stynkyng fote, ye this is more fredericus Barborossa yt excelle~t emperour, bicause he wold haue letted his knaueri culd get no misericordia vntill the tyme that Alexa~der Tertius ye prynce of ye Babi+lonical coniures had troden vpon this excelle~t Emperour in ye churche dore at Venega, thus hath that deuillysh offri~g brought in bo~dage ye
But the Lorde be blessed, whiche hath delyuered vs from this fayned sacryfyce, and golden Calfe,
and hath declared vnto vs ye onely hye prest ouer ye house of god, whiche remaneth a prest for euer after the order of Melchisideche, whiche in the dayes of his fleshe dyd offer vp prayers and supplycacions wyth strong cryeng and teares vnto hym,
that was able to saue hym fro~ deathe, and was harde bycause of his godlynes, he hath offered one offerynge a sacryfyce of swete sauoure to God,
he hath saieth Saint Paule offered one sacryfyce for sinnes, sat hym done for euer on the ryght hande of God,
and from hence forth taryeth tyl his foes be made hys footstole, for wyth one offering hath he made perfect for euer them that are sanctifyed.
This is the onely sacryfice wyth which the fathers wrayth is pacyfied, the generacyon
For it pleased the father that in him shuld alfulnes dwel and by hym to reconcile al thynges to hym selfe and to set at peace by hym throw the blood of hys crosse, both thynges in heauen and thynges in earth.
Now come forth al power and myght and al ye that ar papistes with al ye that reken your selfe to be learned, that is in Engla~d and is of the papistes opinion thys worde can neyther Angell nor Deuell breke,
namely that with one offring he hath made perfecte for euer them that are santcyfyed.
My dearly beloued in Chryst Iesu, loue your soule and loke earnest lye vpon the lordes wordes.
Know ones vnder what learnynge sacramentes and congregacion ye are? what shepards fede you, what brede yt ye breake, in what bodiye ar bou~d
you loue chyldyshnes? howe longe wyl ye scorners delyte in scornynge and the vnwyse be ennemyes vnto knowledge?
How longe wil you remayne in your synnes? howe longe wil ye be bounde wyth the chayn of Infidelite in ye botomles pyt.
Come out from amonge the~ auoid al false learnynge exchew all false holynes and let the deade bury the dede, and folow ye after our mayster Christ, enter into hys house and take vp vpon you his easye yocke and light burthen ye shal fynde rest in your soules as then maye ye bost youre selues of the grace of God the forgyuenes of synnes, the deseruing of our Sauiour Iesus christ, euerlastyng lyfe god giue you his grace Amen.
Secoundarly, they haue taught yt the bread is veri flesh, and ye wine very blood that haue they gathered out of ye wordes of christ literali
spoken wherin he sayeth take eate this is my bodye .&c. not markynge what Chryst sayth in ye .vi.
of Iohn That is to saye it is the spirite that quickeneth, the fleshe profyteth nothyng, ye wordes which spake vnto you ar spirit lif, for in this place he meaneth of his owne fleshe one spirit and he deuideth the spirite fro~ the flesh, yt they myght know throw fayth not onlye the vysyble parte, but also the inuisible part that was in him and that the wordes whyche he spake ware not carnal, but spirytual, for what body shuld haue suffised to be the meat of al the worlde and eue~ therfore did he make mencion of the assension of the sonne of man into heauen, that he myght wt drawe them from the bodyly ymagi+natio~ yt they myght here after learne yt the flesh was called heaue~ly meat which cometh fro~ aboue spiritual meat which he wold giue,
the wordes that haue spoke vnto you are spirite lyfe,
Here you may se that Chryst spake it of hys owne fleshe, and ment playnly that it did nothyng profect as the Papistes or infydelles do vnderstand hym.
Now all they that wyl not haue ye glory of ther redemption chaunged into a pece of bread, but desyreth to haue the ryght ministracion of the Chrystiane tabell they must be cou~+ted and condempned as swarmers, heritykes and Sacramentates and not only that but must be Burned, Drawen,
my dearly beloued in Chryste Iesu is not this amiserable and abonina+ble herisie, to learne and to make the poore people beleue,
that the euerlastynge sone of God is chaunged or transubstanciated into a peace of breade and suppe of wyne, whiche hath gyuen hys body to be broken and hys bloud to be shede for vs in
The scripture sayeth that, that whiche entreth by the mouthe doth not defile a man, for as Christe sayeth it is cast forth into the drawght and by the same reason it foloweth, that it dothe not sanctyfye or make a man holye.
But the Sacrement entreth in by the mouth, therfore it doth folowe that of it selfe, it doth not santifie or make holy anye man.
And of this text shuld folow two inconueniences yf the sacrame~t were the naturall bodye of Chryst, fyrst it shuld folow that the body of Chryst shuld not santifye the faythful bicause it entreth in by ye mouth and agayne it shuld folowe that the body of Chryst shuld be cast out in to the draught which is abominable Wherfore it must nedes folow that the Sacrament can not be hys natural bodye.
the spirit that quicknethe, the fleshe profiteth nothing meanyng to eate it with his tethe, the wordes that speake vnto you are spirit and lyfe, and if it be so that ye do not beleue this,
yet beleue that the euerlastyng soone of god which is with ye father can not be eaten with mens teth nor consumed in no bellye, muche les be deuored with fire, wormes, myse, rat+tes and Apes, which is openly knowe~ in this visible bread vsed in many places, But where the congrega+tion of god is gathered together in his name, wt true fayth true loue obedience and with right ministration according to the declaracion of gods worde, there is delyuered vnto the outward man breade and wyne but ye inuisible ma~ receaueth throw ye promyse of christ, yt inuisible bread and Drinke which is the flesh and
blood of our sauiour Iesus chryste which men can neither eate bitte nor
co~sume for like wil with like be fede the visible man is fede wyth vysible meate namelye bread and wyne the inuisible spirit, is fede with in+uisible meate which is chryst Iesus Therfore remaneth bread bread, wyne wyne, for if it ware otherwyse so ware that spirituall man fede wt palpable and visible breade wine, so ware that visible creature nam+ly breade and wyne chaunged in ye spiritual and inuisible soone of god the which is not nor can not be as it is manifest afore our eyes and shal remayne euerlastinge.
Lorde haue mercye vpon vs for we are more folish and haue lese vnderstandyng tha~ the gentles haue had from the begynnynge.
For they haue worshipped for god the sonne, Mone, and Sterres, whiche do declare power and myght in all waxynge creatures.
Dragons with other creatures whi+che had power myght and a lyuing sprite in them, but we whiche boste oure selues of the name of Chryste prayes to and worshippes a pece of breade, and a suppe of wyne, for the sonne of God whiche hath shed his bloud vpo~ the crosse for the redemption of all mankinde.
abomynable blasphemye yt the body bloude of the sonne of God, that Lorde Iesu Chryst shuld be conuerted cha~ged into suche a wayke feble Idol yea into suche an Idoll whiche can neyther speke nor fele, heare, see, go nor vnderstande, yea whiche must vanyshe awaye for age, with all the creatures vpon earth, whiche saye must be kepped, caryed loked, of men lyke vnto the goddes of Babilon.
No my dearly beloued, no the sone of God wyl not be lyke vnto yt Fabulose prothens he wyll not nor he maye not be shute vp in a house
Rede praye the .vii. and the .xvii. of ye Actes.
the heauen is his seat, and earth is his fotstole.
And Dauid sayeth, wyll god in very ded dwell wyth men on the earth beholde heauen, and heauen aboue all heauens do not conteyne ye, how muche lesse the house whiche haue buylded, all power is geuen vnto hym in heaue~ and earth, yea he hath set hym on his ryght hand in heaue~ly thinges aboue all rewle and power and myght,
and dominion in heauen and earth, he hath cast all thinges vnder his blessed fete, he hath exalted hym one hye, and gyue~ hym a name whiche is aboue at names that in the name of Iesus,
euery kne shulde bone both thinges in heauen, and thinges in earth and al tonges shulde confesse that Iesus Chryste is the Lorde, he is ascended
vp into heauen and shall not come agayne fleshy vnto the tyme that he shall deuyde the shepe from the gotes.
Therefore saye vnto you agayne he can not be eaten with teth nor conciued in no belly.
It is impossible that this inwarde man whiche is prophetable afore the lorde yt he can eate or drynke any outwarde meate or drynke,
But in the ryght supper of oure Lorde where we are congregated to+gether in the Lordes name wyth a fayth that is full of good workes, a loue vnfayned desyringe to leue and dye accordinge to the Lordes pleasure, there is delte out to my hu~gre soule and thurstye concience the inuisyble fleshe and bloude of oure sauiour Iesu Chryst, and my inuiseble man that is my soule receaueth it and eateth it.
My dearly beloued this is the ryght table and cuppe of our lorde Iesu Chryste.
But the other whiche ye most parte of the world vseth is ye table and cuppe of the deuel.
wold not sayeth saynte Paule that you shulde be partakers of the table of deuilles.
For lyke as these aboue rehersed haue the communion of the body and bloude of Chryst, so hath lykewyse the other the communion of the Antichryst Idoll and the deuels table.
And if it be so that we vse and eate with them theyr sacryfice and breade, so declare we our selues to be wyth them one body and congregacion, for thorowe the eatynge of the breade and drinking of the cuppe declare we how we are wt them one breade and one bodye.
myserable bodye that hathe neyther God, nor Chryst, nor Spryte, nor Lyfe, nor Lyght, nor Worde, nor Truthe, nor Prayer, nor no maner
But the symple that feares God seketh the truth and hath it not, the~ shall the Lorde iudge accordinge to his godly wyl and mercye.
miserable body whych is euerlastyngly deade afore the eyes of the lorde, for in the is founde all the innocente blod that is shede vpon earth, from Abelles tyme vnto this daye,
who dare apere before the stoole of God wyth such an vngodly darke wrath full disfigured Lecherous, bloodye bodye.
Â¶O lord kepe and defende all thy poore seruauntes and true hartes from suche a bodye.
But this lyes hide from the eyes of the world they are Dronken so ful with the wyne of ye whore of Babilon.
Thei know wel that the scripture wil haue vsed and holden a supper, but what supper, that is not knowen vnto them,
It is to the fleshe to painfull strayt and narow, that supper that oure sauiour Christ haue lefte learned Therfore haue they chosen made themselues a Supper whiche they receaue, with a beutyfull bodye and an vncleane soul of one which hath confessed them, which is more beast+ly and deuillysh in all hys lyfe then they them selues are.
Yea they haue auansed this Diner so hye bicause of greate perell that the congregacion must receaued but in one kynd namely breade and no wyne.
But yf it were the Supper of our Lord, it must be ministred and vsed vnder both the kyndes.
Therfore declare they it not to be the ryghte Supper of our Lord Iesus Christ but it is and shal remayn the ryght Supper of Antichryst, yea saye they haue auansed it so hie, that the selfe breade must be verye flesh and the wyne very blood, yea that is the
vnfaythfull peoples nature bicause they do not knowe the inuiseble god of heauen, nor the poure of the scrip+tures.
Therfore must they haue a visible god, with whiche they commytte fornication and vse all abomination agaynst our sauiour Iesus Chryst.
Out of this vncleane stynking fountayne that is this learning, is flowed out all infidelyte and Idolatrye, which is vsed with this bread as lockynge it vp, caryeng it aboute leftyng it vp, prayeng to it, seaking it indyuers places, sensyng it, doing godly honour and reuerence to it, of the whiche ther is no tytle nor letter that can be founde in all the holye scryptures.
thou arte he whiche hathe delyuered vs vpo~ the Iebet of ye crosse Lyke as the chyldren of Israel sayd to the golden Calfe, this is he that hath delyuered vs out of ye lande of
Awake vp and se the well afore you, ye that boost and beare ye name of Chryst, ye haue sytt longe ynough in muche darknes, become wyse, and gyue prayes glorye vnto the Lorde God of heauen, to the intente that it come not vpon you, as it came vpon the chyldren of Israel in ye wyldernes bicause of there infidelyte, Idolatrye, and disobedience.
All though that the Lorde delyuered them out of the power of Pharo by his stronge hande and straytched out arme,
what helped it them, verely nothing, lykewyse it hel+pes vs nothing that we are redemed wyth the rede bloude of our sauiour Iesus Chryste out of the deuels power and myght so farre forth as we make our selues boundmen againe thorowe our Infidelyte,
Therdly they learne yt this selfe bread or sa+crame~t lyke as they name it, is geue~ and receaued for ye remissyon of synsines,
my derely beloued wher christ Iesus, and his holy worde is not, there is nothing,
but blyndnes, infidilytye vayne hope dystrust and an vnquyet consiens,
We knowe wel there must be a mediatour for our si~nes, but the ryght mediatoure Chryst Iesus we wyll not knowe.
Therefore haue we elected and chosen out so many satisfactions for our synnes, so many that no man can thinke nor wryte, as Pardons holye water holy fyre, holy salte, holy breade, holy palme holy waxe, holy bones, holye cottes, fastinge, shryuinge Massinge,, pylgramage with other abomynable baggage more, whiche is to long to reherse, ye the dyner of Antychriste and yt onely mediatour Iesus christ wyll we not.
Truly we are lyke vnto a seyke febyll, fante wou~ded man yt goeth and gyueth his mony to one yt is not expert in his science whiche
can not gyue neyther holsome drink nor laye no good playster, whiche destroyes more than he edifyes.
And notwythstandinge, there is declared vnto vs one expeart doctour which wyll neyther take gyftes nor rewardes, for he is of himselfe rich inough and that he doth, he doth it of frendly fauoure and loue, seketh them at ther houses, byndes vp there wondes, healeth them and that frely, but we wyl not haue him, we haue more delyte in destruction, then in saluacion.
Who shal haue compassion or lamente ouer suche a seke man.
It is in lyke case with this vnfaythfull generacion of man, they feyle many tymes greate paynes and smarte, runeth here and there to them, whiche destroyeth more and more, wyth there false venemous medicines.
It coste them moche mony, they suffer moch smarte, and yet are they neuer made hole of ther diseaces.
only euerlastynge riche perfect doctour and medecyne our sauiour Iesus Christ which is so abundantlye declared vnto vs of all Patriarkes Prophetes, Angelles, Apostels, ye and of the father selfe, him wyll we not haue, which is come out of pure loue and fauour, to al them that are wou~ded and euel healed, and offers his seruice and hath brought wyth him a costlye precious salue that is good for al sores, yt is his precious rede blood that he for vs and for al the synnes of the worlde hath shede vpon the crosse for our redemption, we wil not haue hym, we put him awaye from vs with foote and hand, Touth and Nayl, ye we haue shote him awai from vs with our hornes and wyll not that Iesus Chryste shuld reygne ouer vs. Who shall haue compassion in the day of vengeaunce vpon our disobedynt hard necked miserable dampned soules
say vnto you in Christe Iesu beleue it, and you wyl rone where ye wyl, seake what meane, yt ye wyl, ye shall fynde no nother in all the hole scryptures, whyther ye be sycke or hole strong or wayke that shal profect you afore the Lorde, saue onlye that that haue declared vnto you that is Chryste Iesus or els ware al the holy scriptures false and starke lyes.
euen am the onli god and Lorde and besydes me there is no Sauyour, am he onlye that for my owne selues sake do awaye thy offences and forget, thy sinnes,
he onlye hathe taken on hym out in+firmytyes and borne our paynes ye ye lord hath heped togither vpo~ hym ye iniquiti of vs all,
The Angell sayd to Ioseph call his name Iesus, for
This is my bloud the which is of the new Testament,
that is shed for manye, for the remyssion of si~nes.
Behold the la~be of god which taketh away the sinnes of the world for he made him to be synne for,
vs whyche knew no synne, that we by hys meanes shulde be that ryghteousnes whych before god is alowed he hath borne our synnes in his body on ye tre,
ye blood of Iesus Christ his sonne clenseth vs from al synne He hath sayth saint Iohn loued vs and wasshed vs from our sinnes in his owne blood which blood of the mediatour of the new Testament speketh better then the blod of Abel If any man synne we haue an ad+uocate with the father Iesus Christ the ryghteous, and he it is that obteyneth grace for our synnes.
Not for our synnes only, but also for the synnes of the hole worlde.
My dearly belowed brethren, yf there were any other aduocate or me+diatour, the~ this Chryst,
how shame+full had all the holye scryptures lyed, and howe pitefully had Sainte Paule deceaued vs wher he sayeth, ther is one god one mediatoure betwne good and man, euen the man Chryst Iesus which gaue hym selfe a raunsom for all men.
Yf it be so yt throwe sekenes any other meanes wherin thou dost trust to haue remyssio~ of sinnes by let it be so lordly, so holy so bewtiful as it wylÂ· saue onely that mediatour whiche is geuen vs of god that is Christ Iesu, so forsakes thou ye death of our lord whiche he hath suffered for the, and thou denyest the most holyest and precious bloude that he hathe shede fore the.
For all they that are not contente with this onely mediatour, but seketh after other, he curseth godes
worde, he rentes in peces the gospell of Iesus chryst, and vtterly denyeth that Chryst is ye ryght Messias lord and Mayster, and sauyour of the worlde, and that he is come from the father.
My derely beloued in Christ Iesu al thei yt seke ani other strau~ge meanes wythout goddes worde ouer suche lamenteth the Lord,
by the mouth of the prophet Ieremye, my people haue done two euilles, they haue forsake~ me, the well of the vater of syfe, and digged them pittes yt can holde no water.
This hathe alwayes bene the the ende of all false learnyng to forsake Chryst Iesus whose ryghteousnes profeteth alonly before the Lord, to the entent that we wold lyfte vp our owne ymaginacion, and ryghteousnes to pray do reuerence vnto it as vnto a newe Chryst.
My dearly beloued here haue breffly set you forth ye right learning of the supper of our Lorde Iesus Chryst how it shulde be mynistred
in the congregacyo~ of God, accordinge to the Lordes word, here haue ye a confutacion of suttel persuasyons argumentes of the me~bers of Antichryst wherwyth they mayntayne ther meletyde otherwise called theyr dyner, for whiche cause muche ryghteous innocent bloude is shede wythout pitye or mercy in many places of the worlde, and all by the meanes of these spirytuall couniurers of Egypte.
The Prestes of the mountaines seruauntes of Ball and the prophetes Iezebell, the destroyers of the vyneyearde of the Lorde,
Sodome blind watchers dome dogges, the treaders downe of the ryght pasture and the troublers of the clere water,
The destrouers of wedowes fatherles, theues and murtherers, enemyes of the crosse of Chryste whose ende
is danmacion whose god is there belly and glorye to there shame whi+che are worldly mynded.
They are false maysters and fathers of sectes hauing cursed children, welles with out watter,
dry cloudes wandrynge Starres, Trees without frut, at ga+theringe tyme wythered, twyse dede and plucked vp by the totes, They are the raginge waues of the Sea, fomynge out there owne shame to whome is reserued the myst of Dar+kenes for euer,
these are the abomina+ble locustes whiche are come out of the botomeles pitte, to hurt al them, that haue not the marke of God in therefore hedes.
Somma those are they that are cursed and damned euerlastingly from ye presence of god
excepte they repent and amende not that Iudge theym that be farre from me for know there standes wrytten iudge not les thou be iudged,
condeme not les thou be conde~ned, but they are iudged by the euer+lasting worde of the Lord, the whyche can neyther lye nor be disseaued like as our Sauiour Iesus Christ sayeth,
iudge you not but it is ye worde that haue spoken that iudgeth you.
Yf thou do the workes yt Paule speaketh of, thou shall not inheret the kyngdome of God.
If thou do the~ not so thou art not iudged of anye man, but of Goddes worde.
Nowe my deare beloued lay these .ii. one agaynst another, Gods learnynge and mannes learnynge, the truth and the lye, Chryst and Antichriste, wey it, mesure it tell it, wyth the Lordes word, and trust in the Lorde that ye shall fynd nothynge, that haue here declared, but the ryght true worde and wyll of oure sauiour Iesus christ.
vnto the almyghty maiestie of god throw our Lorde Iesus christ that it hath pleased him to let shyne vnto vs the lyght of the holy Gospell which hath be keped from vs so ma+ny hundreth yere in the darke night of infidelitie.
Â¶Therfore take it now vp as Ierymye sayeth while it shyneth and tarye not lest it be conuerted and chaunged into a dedlye darkenes, rede it right, it is godes word, amend your lyuing, serue your neyghbour wt al diligence, feare God and be obedient vnto his holy word so shal yu remayne in euerlasting lyfe.
For another foundacion can no man laye than it that is laye, whiche is Iesus Chryst.
Mark. Whosoeuer is ashamed of me and of my wordes in this aduouterous and synfull generacio~ of him also shal ye sonne of ma~ be a shamed whe~ he cometh in the glory of his father wyth the holy Aungelles.
Ma. He that endureth to the ende the same shalbe saued.

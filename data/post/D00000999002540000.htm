THere was neuer any thing by the wie of man so well deuised, or so surely established, which (in continua~ce of time) hath not been corrupted: as (emong other thinges) it may plainly appere by the common prayers in the Churche, commonly called diuine seruice: the firste originall and grounde whereof, if a manne woulde searche out by the auncient fathers, he shall finde that thesame was not ordeyned, but of a good purpose, and for a great aduauncement of godlines: For they so ordred the matter, that all the whole Bible (or the greatest parte thereof) should be read ouer once in the yeare, intendyng thereby, that the Cleargie, and specially suche as were Ministers of the congregacion, should (by often readyng and meditacion of Gods worde) be stirred vp to godlines themselfes, and be more able also to exhorte other by wholsome doctrine, and to confute them that were aduersaries to the trueth.
And further, that the people (by daily hearyng of holy scripture read in the Churche) should continuallye profite more and more in the knowlege of God, and bee the more inflamed with the loue of his true religion.
But these many yeares passed, this Godly and decent ordre of the auncient fathers, hath bee so altered, broken, and neglected, by planting in vncertein stories, Lege~des, Respondes, Verses, vaine repeticions, Commemoracions and Synodalles, that commonly when any boke of the Bible was begon: before three or foure Chapiters were read out, all the rest were vnread.
And in this sorte, the boke of Esaie was begon in Aduent, and the booke of Genesis in Septuagesima: but they were onely begon, and neuer read thorow.
After a like sorte wer other bokes of holy scripture vsed.
And moreouer, whereas s. Paule would haue suche language spoken to the people in the churche, as they mighte vnderstande and haue profite by hearyng thesame: the seruice in this Church of England (these many yeares) hath been read in Latin to the people, whiche they vnderstoode not, so that they haue heard with theyr cares onely: their hartes, spirite and minde, haue not been edified thereby.
And furthermore, notwithstandyng that the auncient fathers had deuided the psalmes into seuen porcions: wherof euery one was called a nocturne: now of late tyme a fewe of them haue been dailye sayed (and ofte repeated) and the rest vtterly omitted.
Moreouer, the no~bre hardnes of the rules called the pie, and the manifolde chaunginges of the seruice, was the cause, yt to turne the boke onlye, was so hard and intricate a matter, that many times, there was more busines to fynd out what should be read, then to read it when it was founde out.
These inconueniences therfore considered: here is set furth suche an ordre, whereby thesame shalbe redressed.
And for a readines in this matter, here is drawen out a kalendar for that purpose, whiche is plaine and easy to be vnderstanded, wherin (so muche as maie be) the readyng of holy scripture is so set furthe, that all thynges shall bee doen in ordre, without breakyng one piece therof from another.
For this cause be cut of Anthemes, Respondes, Inuitatories, and suche like thynges, as did breake the continuall course of the readyng of the scripture.
Yet because there is no remedy, but that of necessitie there must be some rules: therfore certein rules are here set furth, whiche as they be fewe in no~bre: so they be plain and easy to be vnderstanded.
So yt here you haue an ordre for praier (as touchyng the readyng of holy scripture) muche agreable to the mynde purpose of the olde fathers, and a greate deale more profitable and commodious, then that whiche of late was vsed.
It is more profitable, because here are left out many thynges, whereof some be vntrue, some vncertein, some vain and supersticious: and is ordeyned nothyng to be read, but the very pure worde of God, the holy scriptures, or that whiche is euidently grounded vpon the same: and that in suche a language ordre, as is moste easy plain for the vnderstandyng, bothe of the readers and hearers.
It is also more co~modious, bothe for the shortnes thereof, for the plaines of the ordre, for that the rules be fewe easy.
Furthermore, by this ordre, the curates shal nede none other bookes for their publique seruice, but this boke the Bible: by the meanes wherof, the people shall not be at so great charge for bookes, as in tyme past they haue been.
And where heretofore, there hath been great diuersitie in saying and synging in churches within this realme: some folowyng Salsbury vse, some Herford vse, some the vse of Bangor, some of Yorke, some of Lincolne: Now from he~cefurth, all the whole realme shall haue but one vse.
And if any would iudge this waye more painfull, because that all thynges must be read vpo~ the boke, where as before, by the reason of so often repeticion, they could saye many thinges by heart: if those men will waye their labor, with the profite in knowlege, whiche dayely they shal obtein by readyng vpon the boke, they will not refuse the payn, in consideracion of the greate profite that shall ensue therof.
And forsomuche as nothyng can, almoste, be so plainly set furth, but doubtes maie rise in the vse practisyng of the same: to appease all suche diuersitie (if any arise) and for the resolucion of all doubtes, concernyng the maner how to vnderstande, do, and execute the thynges conteygned in this booke: the parties that so doubt, or diuersly take any thyng, shall alwaye resorte to the Bishop of the Diocese, who by his discrecion shall take ordre for the quietyng and appeasyng of the same: so that the same ordre be not contrary to any thyng conteigned in this boke. [leaf motif]Though it be appointed in the afore written preface, that al thinges shalbe read and songe in the churche, in the Englishe tongue, to thende that the congregacion maie be therby edified: yet it is not meante, but when men saye Matins and Euensong priuately, they maye saie the same in any language that they the~selues do vnderstande.
Neither that any man shalbe bounde to the saying of them, but suche as from tyme to tyme, in Cathedrall and Collegiate Churches, Parishe Churches, and Chapelles to the same annexed, shall serue the congregacion. [leaf motif]THE TABLE AND[leaf motif] Kalender, expressing the ordre of the Psalmes and Lessons, to be sayed at Matyns and Euensong, throughout the yeare, excepte certayne proper feastes, as the Rules folowing more plainlye declare.
[leaf motif]THE ORDRE[leaf motif] how the Psalter is appoynted to bee redde.
THe Psalter shalbe red through, once euery Moneth, because that some Monethes be longer then some other be: it is thought good, to make the~ euen by this meanes.
To euery Moneth, as concernyng this purpose, shalbe appointed iust .xxx. dayes.
And because Ianuary and Marche hath one daye, aboue the sayed nombre, and February whiche is placed betwene them bothe, hath onely .xxviii. daies, February shall borowe of either of the Monethes of Ianuary and Marche one daye, and so the Psalter whiche shalbe red in Februarye, muste bee begon the laste daye of Ianuary, and ended the first daye of Marche.
And whereas Maie, Iuly, August, October, and December, haue .xxxi. dayes a piece, it is ordred that thesame Psalmes shall bee redde the last daye of the saied Monethes, whiche were red the daye before: so that the Psalter maye bee begon agayne the first daye of the next Monethes ensuing.
Now to know what Psalmes shalbe red euery daye, looke in the Kalendar the nombre that is appointed for the Psalmes, and then finde thesame noumbre in this Table, and vpon that noumbre shall you se, what Psalmes shalbee sayd at Matyns, and Euensong.
Psalme is deuided into .xxii. porcions, and is ouer long to bee red at one tyme: it is so ordred that at one tyme shall not bee red aboue .iiii. or .v. of the saied porcions, as you shall perceiue to bee noted in this Table.
And here is also to be noted, that in this Table, and in al other partes of the seruice, where any Psalmes are appoincted, the nombre is expressed after the greate Englishe Bible, whiche from the .ix. Psalme vnto the .C.xlviii.
Psalme (folowyng the diuision of the Ebrues) doeth vary in nombres from the como~ Latyn translacion. [leaf motif]A TABLE FOR[leaf motif] the ordre of the Psalmes, to be sayed at Matins and Euensong.

THE ORDRE howe the rest of holy Scripture (beside the Psalter) is appoynted to bee redde.
THe old Testament is appoynted for the first Lessons, at Matins and Euensong, and shal bee redde through euery yere once, except certain bokes and Chapiters, whiche bee least edifying, and might best be spared, and therfore are left vnred.
The newe Testament is appoynted for the second Lessons, at Matins and Euensong, and shalbe red ouer ordrely euery yere thrise, beside the Epistles and Gospelles: except the Apocalips, out of the whiche there be onely certain Lessons appoynted vpon diuerse proper feastes.
And to knowe what Lessons shall bee red euery daye: finde the daye of the Moneth in the Kalendar folowyng: and there ye shal perceiue the bookes and Chapiters, that shalbe red for the Lessons, bothe at Matins and Euensong.
And here is to be noted, that whensoeuer there be any proper Psalmes or Lessons, appoynted for any feast, moueable or vnmoueable: the~ the Psalmes and Lessons appoynted in the Kalendar, shall bee omitted for that tyme.
Ye muste note also that the Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, appoynted for the Sundaye, shall serue all the weeke after, except there falsome feast that hath his propre.
This is also to bee noted, concernyng the leape yeares, that the .xxv. day of February, whiche in leape yeares is coumpted for twoo dayes, shall in those twoo dayes, alter neither Psalme nor Lesson: but the same Psalmes and Lessons, whiche be sayed the first daye, shall serue also for the seconde daye.
Also, wheresoeuer the beginning of any Lesson, Epistle, or Gospel is not expressed, there ye must begin at the beginnyng of the Chapter.

The priest beyng in the quier, shall begynne with a loude voyce the Lordes prayer, called the pater noster.
OVRE father whiche arte in heauen; hallowed be thy name.
Thy will be done in earth as it is in heauen.
And forgeue vs our trespasses, as we forgeue them that trespasse agaynst vs.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne, to the holy gost.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer shall bee worlde without ende.
Then shalbe sayed or song without any Inuitatory this Psalme.
Come, let vs syng vnto the Lorde: let vs hartely reioyce in the strength of our saluacion.
Let vs come before his presence with thankes geuing: and shewe our selfe glad in hym with Psalmes.
For the Lorde is a great God: and a great kyng about all goddes.
In his hande are all the corners of the earth: and the strength of the hilles is his also.
The sea is his, and he made it: and his handes prepared the drye lande.
come, let vs worship and fall downe: and knele before the Lorde our maker.
For he is (the Lorde) oure God: and we are the people of his pasture, and the shepe of his handes.
To day, yf ye wyll heare his voyce, harden not youre heartes: as in the prouocacion, and as in the daye of temptacion in the wildernes When your fathers tempted me: proued me, and sawe my workes.
Fortye yeares longe was greued with this generacion, and sayed: it is a people that do erre in their heartes: for they haue not knowne my wayes.
Vnto whome sware in my wrath: that they shoulde not enter into my rest.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.

Thou sittest on the ryghthande of God in the glory of the father.
We beleue that thou shalt come to be our iudge.
We therfore pray thee, helpe thy seruauntes whom thou haste redemed with thy precious bloud.
Make them to be noumbred with thy sainctes, in glory euerlastyng.

In holynesse and righteousnes before him: all the dayes of our lyfe.
And thou child, shalt be called the Prophete of the highest: for thou shalt goe before the face of the Lord, to prepare his wayes.
To geue knowledge of saluacion vnto his people: for the remission of their sinnes.
Through the tendre mercy of our God: whereby the daye spring from an high hath visited vs.
To geue light to them that sit in darkenes, in the shadowe of death: and to guide our fete into the way of peace.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.

God, which art author of peace, louer of concorde, in knowledge of whom standeth our eternall lyfe, whose seruice is perfecte fredome: defende vs thy humble seruau~tes, in all assaultes of our enemies, that we surely trustyng in thy defence, may not feare the power of any aduersaries: through the might of Iesu Christ our Lorde.
Lord our heauenly father, almighty and euerlyuyng God, whiche haste safely brought vs to the beginning of this day: Defend vs in the same with thy mighty power, graunt that this day we fall into no sinne, neither runne into any kinde of daunger, but that all our doinges may be ordred by thy gouernaunce, to doe alwayes that is ryghteous in thy sight: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
Amen. [leaf motif] AN ORDRE [leaf motif] For Euensong throughout the yere.
The priest shall saye. [leaf motif] OVRE FATHER, &c, Then lykewyse he shall saye.
Glory be to the father, to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
Then Psalmes in ordre as they be appoynted in the Table for Psalmes, except there be propre Psalmes appointed for that daye.
Then a lesson of the olde testamente, as it is appoynted lykewise in the kalender, excepte there be proper lessons appointed for that daye.
After that (Magnificat anima mea dominum) in Englishe, as foloweth.
For beholde, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.
For he that is myghtie hath magnifyed me: and holy is his name.
And his mercy is on them that feare him: throughout all generations.
He hath shewed strength with his arme: he hath scatered the proude in the imaginacion of their heartes.
He hath put downe the mightie from their seate: and hath exalted the humble and meke.
He hath filled the hungry, with good thynges: and the ryche he hath sent emptie awaye.
He remembring his mercye, hath holpen his seruaunte Israel: as he promysed to oure fathers, Abraham and his sede for euer.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
And after that (Nune dimittis seruum tuum) in Englishe as foloweth.
LOrde, nowe lettest thou thy seruaunte departe in peace: accordyng to thy worde.
Whiche thou haste prepared: before the face of all people.
To be a light to lighten the Gentiles: and to be the glorye of thy people Israel.
Glory be to the father, to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
Then the suffrages before assigned at Mattyns, the clerkes knelyng lykewyse, with three Collectes.
Fyrste of the day: Second of peace: Thirde for ayde against all perilles, as here foloweth.
Whiche .ii. laste Collectes shall be dayly sayed at Euensong without alteracion.
God, from whome all holy desyres, all good counsayles, and all iust workes doe procede: Geue vnto thy seruauntes that peace, whiche the worlde cannot geue, that both our heartes maye be sette to obey thy commaundementes, and also that by thee, we beyng defended from the feare of our enemyes, may passe oure tyme in rest and quietnesse: through the merites of Iesu Christe our sauiour.
LYghten our darkenesse we beseche thee, Lord and by thy great mercy, defend vs from all perils and daungers of this night, for the loue of thy onely sonne our sauiour Iesu Christe.
In the feastes of Christmas, Thepiphanie, Easter, Thascencion, Penticost, and vpon Trinitie Sonday, shall be song or sayed immediately after Benedictus this confession of our christian fayth.
WHo&soeuer will be saued: before all thynges it is necessary that he holde the Catholyke fayth.
Whiche fayth, excepte euery one doe kepe holy and vndefiled: without doubte he shall peryshe euerlastyngly.
And the Catholike fayth is this: that we wurshippe one God in Trinitie, and Trinitie in vnitie.
For there is one person of the father, another of the sonne: and an other of the holy gost.
But the Godhead of the father, of the sonne, and of the holy gost, is all one: the glory equall, the maiestie coeternal.
Suche as the father is, suche is the sonne: and suche is the holy gost.
The father vncreate, the sonne vncreate: and the holy gost vncreate.
The father incomprehensible, the sonne incomprehensible: and the holy gost incomprehensible.
The father eternall, the sonne eternall: and the holy gost eternall.
And yet they are not three eternalles: but one eternall.
As also there be not three incomprehensibles, nor three vncreated: but one vncreated, and one incomprehensible.
So lykewyse, the father is almightie: the sonne almightie, and the holy gost almightie.
And yet are they not three almighties: but one almighty.
So the father is God, the sonne God: and the holy gost God.
And yet are they not three Gods: but one God.
So lykewyse the father is Lorde, the sonne Lorde: and the holy gost Lord.
For like as we be compelled by the christian veritie: to acknowledge euery person by himselfe to be God and Lorde: So are we forbidden by the Catholike religion: to saye there be three Gods, or thee Lordes.
The father is made of none: neither created nor begotte~.
The sonne is of the father alone: not made nor created, but begotten.
The holy gost is of the father and of the sonne: neyther made nor created, nor begotten, but proceding.
So there is one father, not three fathers: one sonne, not three sonnes: one holy gost, not three holy gostes.
And in this trinitie, none is afore nor after other: none is greater nor lesse then other.
But the whole three persons: be coeternall together and coequall.
So that in all thinges, as it is afore sayed: the vnitie in trinitie, and the trinitie in vnitie, is to be wurshipped.
He therfore that will be saued: must thus thinke of the trinitie.
Furthermore, it is necessarye to euerlastyng saluacion: that he also beleue rightly in the incarnacion of our Lorde Iesu Christe.
For the right fayth is that we beleue confesse: that our Lorde Iesus Christe, the sonne of God, is God and manne.
God of the substaunce of the father, begotten before the worldes: and manne of the substaunce of his mother, borne in the worlde.
Perfecte God and perfecte manne: of a reasonable soule, and humayne fleshe subsisting.
Equall to the father as touchyng his Godhead: and inferior to the father touchyng his manhode.
Who although he be God and manne: yet he is not two, but one Christe.
One, not by conuersion of the Godhead into fleshe: but by takyng of the manhode into God.
One altogether, not by confusion of substaunce: but by vnitie of person.
For as the resonable soule and fleshe is one manne: So God and man is one Christe.
Who suffered for our saluacion: descended into hell, rose agayne the thirde daye from the dead.
He ascended into heauen, he sitteth on the righthande of the father, God almightie: from whence he shall come to iudge the quicke and dead.
At whose comming all men shall ryse againe with theyr bodyes: and shall geue accompte of theyr owne workes.
And they that haue done good, shall goe into lyfe euerlasting: and they that haue done euill, into euerlasting fyre.
This is the Catholyke fayth: whiche excepte a manne beleue faythfully, he cannot be saued: Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the beginnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
Amen. [leaf motif] [leaf motif] THVS ENdeth the ordre of Mattyns and Euensong through the whole yere. (.Â·.) [leaf motif][leaf motif] [leaf motif] [leaf motif]THE INTROITES[leaf motif] Collectes, Epistles, and Gospels, to be vsed at the celebracion of the Lordes supper and holye Communion, throughe the yeare: with proper Psalmes, and lessons for diuers feastes and dayes.
BLe&s&sed is that manne that hath not walked in the counsayle of the vngodly: nor stand in the waye of synners, and hath not sit in the seate of the skornefull.
But his delight is in the law of the lorde: and in his lawe wil he exercise himself day and night.
And he shalbe lyke a tree planted by the water syde: that wyll bryng foorth his fruite in due season.
His leafe also shall not wither: and looke whatsoeuer he doth, it shall prospere.
As for the vngodly, it is not so with them: but they are lyke the chaffe, whiche the wynde skattreth awaye (from the face of the yearth.)
Therfore the vngodly shall not be hable to stand in the iudgement: neyther the synners in the congregacion of the righteous.
But the Lorde knoweth the waye of the righteous: and the waye of the vngodlye shall perishe.
Glory be to the father, to the sonne, to the holy ghoste.
As it was in the begynning, is nowe, and euer shalbee: worlde without ende.
ALmightie God, geue vs grace, that we maye caste away the workes of darkenes, put vpon vs the armour of light, now in the time of this mortal life, (in the which thy sonne Iesus Christe came to visite vs in great humilitie:) that in the last daye, when he shal come again in his glorious maiestie, to iudge bothe the quicke and the dead: we maye ryse to the lyfe immortall, through him, who liueth and reigneth with thee and the holy ghost, now and euer.
OWe nothing to any man but this, that ye loue one another.
For these commaundementes: Thou shalt not commit adultrie: Thou shalt not kyll: Thou shalt not steale: Thou shalt beare no false witnes: Thou shalt not luste: and so forthe (if there be any other commaundement) it is al co~prehended in this saying: namely, loue thy neighbor as thy self.
Loue hurteth not his neighbor: therfore is loue the fulfillyng of the lawe.
This also, we knowe the season, howe that it is tyme that we shoulde now awake out of slepe, for nowe is our saluacion nerer, then when we beleued.
The night is passed, the daye is come nye: let vs therefore cast awaye the dedes of darkenes, let vs put on the armoure of light.
Let vs walke honestly, as it were in the day light: not in eating and drinkyng, neyther in chambouryng wantonnes, neither in stryfe and enuying: but put ye on the Lord Iesus Christ.
And make not prouision for the fleshe, to fulfill the lustes of it.
ANd when they drew nigh to Ierusalem, were come to Bethphage vnto Mount Oliuete, the~ sente Iesus two disciples, saying vnto the~: Go into the towne that lyeth ouer agaynste you, and anone ye shall fynde an Asse bounde, and a Colte with her: looce them and bryng them vnto me.
And if any man saye ought vnto you, saye ye, the lord hath neede of them: and straight waye he will let them goe.
All thys was doen that it myghte bee fulfilled, whiche was spoken by the Prophete, saying: Tell ye the daughter of Sion, beholde, thy kyng cummeth vnto thee meeke, sitting vpon an Asse and a colte, the fole of the Asse vsed to the yoke.
The disciples went and dyd as Iesus commaunded them, and brought the Asse and the colte, and put on them their clothes, and set him theron.
And many of the people spred their garmentes in the way.
Other cut downe brau~ches from the trees, and strawed them in the waye.
Moreouer the people that wente before, and they that came after cryed, saying: Hosanna to the sonne of Dauid: Blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lorde: Hosanna in the highest.
And when he was come to Ierusalem, all the citie was moued, saying: who is this? And the people sayed: this is Iesus the Prophete of Nazareth a citie of Galile.
And Iesus went into the temple of God, and cast out al them that solde and bought in the temple, and ouerthrewe the tables of the money chaungers, and the seates of them that solde doues, and sayed vnto them: It is written: My house shalbe called the house of prayer, but ye haue made it a denne of theues.
WHen was in trouble, called vpon the Lorde and he hearde me.
Deliuer my soule, Lorde, from lying lyppes: and from a deceyptfull tongue.
What rewarde shalbe geuen vnto thee, thou false tongue? euen mightie and sharpe arowes, with hote burning coales.
Woe is me that am constrained to dwel with Mesech: and to haue myne habitacion among the tentes of Cedar.
My soule hath long dwelt among them: that bee enemies vnto peace.
labour for peace, but when speake vnto them therof: they make them to battayle.
BLe&s&sed Lorde, whiche haste caused all holy scriptures to be writte~ for our learning: graunt vs that we maye in suche wyse heare them, reade, marke, learne, and inwardly digeste them, that by pacience and coumforte of thy holy woorde, we maye embrace and euer holde fast the blessed hope of euerlasting lyfe, whiche thou haste geuen vs in our sauiour Iesus Christe.
WHat&soeuer thinges are written afore tyme, they are written for our learning, that we throughe pacience and coumforte of the scriptures, myght haue hope.
The God of pacience and consolacion, graunt you to be lyke minded one towardes an other, after the ensaumple of Christe Iesu: that ye all agreeyng together, maye with one mouth prayse God the father of our Lorde Iesus Christe: wherfore receyue ye one an other as Christe receyued vs, to the prayse of God.
And thys saye, that Iesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the trueth of God, to confirme the promisses made vnto the fathers: and that the Gentiles might praise God for his mercie, as it is wrytten.
For this cause wyll prayse thee among the Gentiles, and syng vnto thy name.
And agayne he sayth: reioyce ye Gentiles with his people.
And agayne: prayse the Lord all ye Gentiles, and laude him all ye nacions together.
And agayne Esai sayth: there shalbe the roote of Iesse, and he that shall rise to reygne ouer the Gentiles: in him shal the Gentiles trust.
The God of hope fyll you with all ioy, and peace in beleuyng, that ye maye be riche in hope, through the power of the holy gost.
THere shall be signes in the Sunne and in the Mone, and in the starres: and in the earth the people shalbe at their wittes ende, through despayre.
The sea and the water shall roare, and mennes hartes shall faile them for feare, and for looking after those thinges whiche shall come on the earth.
And then shal they see the sonne of man come in a cloud, with power and greate glory.
When these thinges beginne to come to passe, then looke vp, and lyft vp youre heades, for your redempcion draweth nye.
And he shewed them a similitude: behold the figtree, all other trees, when they shoote furth theyr buddes, ye see and knowe of your owne selues that summer is then nye at hand.
So likewise ye also (whe~ ye se these thinges come to passe) be sure, that the kingdom of God is nye. Verely say vnto you: this generacion shall not passe, till all be fulfilled.
Heauen and earth shall passe: but my wordes shall not passe.
HEare me when call, God of my righteousnes: thou hast set me at libertie when was in trouble, haue mercie vpon me, and hearken vnto my prayer.
ye sonnes of men, how long will ye blaspheme myne honour: and haue suche pleasure in vanitie, and seke after leasyng? Knowe this also, that the Lorde hath chosen to himselfe the manne that is godly: when call vpon the Lorde, he will heare me.
Stande in awe and sinne not: common with your owne heart, and in your chamber, and be still.
Offer the sacrifice of righteousnes: and put your trust in the Lorde.
There bee many that will saye: who will shewe vs any good? Lorde lift thou vp the lyght of thy countenaunce vpon vs. Thou hast put gladnes in myne hearte: sence the tyme that theyr corne and wyne (and oyle) increased.
will lay me downe in peace and take my reste: for it is thou Lorde onelye, that makest me to dwell in safetie.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe and euer. &c.
LOrde, we beseche thee, geue eare to our prayers, and by thy gracious visitacion lyghten the darkenesse of oure hearte, by our Lorde Iesus Christ.
LEt a man this wise esteme vs, eue~ as the ministers of Christe, and stewardes of the secretes of God.
Furthermore, it is required of the stewardes, that a man be found faithful: with me it is but a very smal thyng that shoulde bee iudged of you, eyther of mannes iudgement: no iudge not myne owne selfe, for knowe nought by my selfe, yet am not thereby iustified.
Therfore iudge nothing before the tyme, vntil the lorde come, whiche will lighten thinges that are hidde in darkenes, and open the counsayls of the heartes, and then shall euery man haue prayse of god.
WHen Iohn beyng in prieson hearde the woorkes of Christe, he sent two of his disciples, and sayed vnto hym: Art thou he that shall come? or doe we looke for an other? Iesus aunswered and sayed vnto them: Goe, and shewe Iohn agayne, what ye haue hearde and seene.
The blynd receyue theyr sight, the lame walke, the Lepers are clensed, and the deafe heare, the dead are raised vp, the poore receiue the glad tydinges of the gospell: and happye is he that is not offended by me.
And as they departed, Iesus began to say vnto the people concernyng Iohn: what went ye out into the wildernes to see? reede that is shaken with the winde? or what went ye out for to see? man clothed in softe raymet? beholde, they that weare softe clothyng, are in kynges houses.
But what wente ye out for to see? a Prophete? verely saye vnto you, and more then a Prophete.
For this is he of whome it is written: behold, send my messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before thee.
harken thou vnto the voyce of my callyng, my kyng and my God: for vnto thee will make my prayer.
My voice shalt thou heare betymes, Lorde: early in the mornyng wyll direct my prayer vnto thee, and wyll looke vp.
For thou art the God that hath no pleasure in wyckednes: neyther shall any euill dwell with thee.
Suche as be foolyshe shall not stande in thy syght: for thou hatest all them that worke vanitie.
Thou shalt destroy them that speake leasyng: the Lord wyll abhorre both the bloud thirsty, and deceyptfull man.
But as for me, wyll come into thy house, euen vpon the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy feare wyll wurship towarde thy holy temple.
Leade me, Lorde, in thy ryghteousnes, because of myne enemyes: make thy waye playne before my face.
For there is no faithfulnes in his mouth: their inwarde partes are very wickednes.
Their throte is an open sepulchre: they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, God, let them peryshe through theyr owne imaginacions: cast them out in the multitude of theyr vngodlines, for they haue rebelled against thee.
And let all them that put theyr trust in thee reioyce: they shal euer be geuing of tha~kes because thou defendest them, they that loue thy name shalbe ioyfull in thee.
For thou Lorde wylt geue thy blessyng vnto the ryghteous: and with thy fauorable kyndnes wylt thou defende him, as with a shielde.
Glorye be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
LOrde rayse vp (we praye thee) thy power, and come among vs, and with great might succor vs, that where as through our synnes and wickednes we be fore lette and hyndred, thy bountiful grace and mercy, through the satisfaccion of thy sonne oure Lorde, maye spedely delyuer vs: to whome with thee, and the holy gost be honor and glory worlde without ende.
Let your softnes bee knowen vnto all men: the Lord is euen at hande.
Be carefull for nothing: but in all prayer and supplicacion let youre peticions be manifest vnto God, with geuing of thankes.
And the peace of God (which passeth al vnderstandyng) kepe your heartes and myndes, through Christ Iesu.
THys is the recorde of Iohn: when the Iewes sent priestes and Leuites from Ierusalem, to aske him: what art thou? And he confessed and denied not, and sayed plainly: am not Christ.
And they asked hym: what then? art thou Helyas? and he sayeth: am not.
Then sayed they vnto him: what art thou, that we may geue an aunswere vnto them that sent vs? what sayest thou of thy selfe? he sayd: am the voyce of a cryer in the wyldernes: make straight the way of the Lorde, as sayd the Prophete Esay.
And they which were sent were of the Phariseis: and they asked hym and sayde vnto hym: why baptisest thou then, if thou be not Christe, nor Helias, neyther that Prophete? Iohn aunswered them, saying: baptise with water, but there standeth one among you, whome ye knowe not: he it is which though he came after me, was before me, whose shooe latchet am not worthy to vnlooce.
These thynges were doen at Bethabara beyond Iordan, where Iohn did baptise.
Syng vnto the Lorde a newe song: for he hath done meruaylous thynges.
With his owne right hand with his holy arme: hath he gotten hymselfe the victorie.
The lord declared his saluacion: his righteousnes hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
He hath remembred his mercie and trueth towarde the house of Israell: and all the endes of the worlde haue seene the saluacion of our God.
Shewe your selues ioyfull vnto the Lorde, all ye landes: syng, reioyce, and geue thankes.
Prayse the lorde vpon the Harpe: sing to the Harpe with a Psalme of thankesgeuing.
With trumpettes also and shawmes: shewe your selues ioyfull before the Lorde the kyng.
Lette the sea make a noyse, and all that therein is: the rounde worlde and they that dwell therein.
Let the fluddes clap theyr handes, and let the hilles bee ioyfull together before the Lorde: for he is come to iudge the earth.
With righteousnes shal he iudge the world: and the people with equitie.
Glorye be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
GOd, which makeste vs gladde with the yerely remembraunce of the birth of thy onelye sonne Iesus Christe: graunt that as we ioyfully receiue him for our redemer, so we may with sure confidence beholde hym, when he shall come to be our iudge, who liueth and reigneth. &c.
THe grace of God that bringeth saluacion vnto all menne, hath appeared, and teacheth vs that we should denie vngodlines, and worldly lustes, and that we should liue soberly, and righteousely, and godly in this present world, looking for that blessed hope, and appearing of the glory of the great God, and of our sauiour Iesu Christ, whiche gaue himselfe for vs, to redeme vs from all vnrighteousnes, and to pourge vs a peculiare people vnto hymselfe, feruently geuen vnto good woorkes.
These thynges speake and exhorte, and rebuke with all feruentnes of commaundyng.
ANd it chaunsed in those dayes, that there went out a commaundeme~t from Augustus the Emperour, that all the worlde shoulde be taxed.
And this taxing was the firste, and executed when Sirenius was lieutenaunt in Siria.
And euery man went vnto his owne citie to be taxed.
And Ioseph also ascended from Galile, out of a citie called Nazareth, into Iewry, vnto the citie of Dauid, which is called Bethleem, because he was of the house and linage of Dauid, to bee taxed, with Mary his spoused wife, whiche was with chylde.
And it fortuned that while they were there, her tyme was come that she shoulde be deliuered.
And she brought furth her first begotten sonne, and wrapped him in swadling clothes, layed him in a Maunger, because there was no roume for them in the Inne.
And there were in the same region shepeheardes watching and keping theyr flocke by night.
And loe, the Angel of the lord stoode harde by them, and the brightnesse of the lorde shone rounde about them, and they were sore afrayed.
And the Angel saied vnto them: Be not afrayde: for behold, bring you tydinges of great ioy that shall come to all people: for vnto you is borne this daye, in the citie of Dauid, a sauiour whiche is Christ the lord.
And take this for a sygne: ye shal fynde the childe wrapped in swadlyng clothes, and layde in a mau~ger.
And straight way there was with the Angel, a multitude of heauenly souldiers, praysyng god, and saying: Glory to god on hye, and peace on the earth, and vnto men a good will.
Lord our gouernour, how excellent is thy name in all the worlde: thou that haste set thy glory aboue the heauens? Out of the mouth of very babes and suckelynges, hast thou ordayned strength, because of thyne enemies: that thou mightest still the enemye and the auenger.
For will considre thy heauens, euen the woorkes of thy fyngers: the Moone and the starres whiche thou hast ordayned.
What is man that thou art so myndefull of hym: and the sonne of man, that thou visitest him? Thou madest him lower then the Angels: to croune him with glorye and worship.
Thou makest hym to haue dominion of the workes of thy handes: and thou haste put all thynges in subieccion vnder his feete.
All shepe and oxen: yea, and the beastes of the fielde.
The foules of the ayre, and the fishes of the sea: and whatsoeuer walketh thorowe the pathes of the seas.
Lorde our gouernoure: howe excellent is thy name in all the worlde.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe and euer. &c.
ALmyghtie God, which haste geuen vs thy only begotten sonne to take our nature vpon hym, and this daye to be borne of a pure virgin: Graunt that we being regenerate and made thy children by adoption and grace, maye dayly be renued by thy holy spirite, throughe the same our Lorde Iesus Christe, who lyueth and reigneth. &c.
GOD in tymes paste, dyuerslye and manye wayes spake vnto the fathers by Prophetes: but in these last dayes, he hath spoken to vs by his owne so~ne, whom he hath made heyre of all thinges, by whom also he made the worlde.
Whiche (sonne) being the brightnesse of his glory, and the very image of his substaunce, rulyng all thynges with the worde of his power, hath by hys owne person pourged our synnes, and sytteth on the ryght hand of the maiestie on hygh: being so muche more excellent then the Angels, as he hath by inheritaunce obtayned a more excellente name then they.
For vnto whiche of the Angels sayed he at any time? Thou art my sonne, thys daye haue begotten thee.
And agayne, wyll be his father, and he shall bee my sonne.
And agayne, when he bryngeth in the firste begotten sonne into the worlde, he sayeth: and let all the Angels of God wurship hym.
And vnto the Angels he sayethe: He maketh his Angels spirites, and hys ministers a flame of fyre.
But vnto the sonne he sayethe: thy seate (O God) shalbe for euer and euer.
Thou hast loued righteousnes and hated iniquitie: wherfore God, euen thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyle of gladnes aboue thy felowes.
And thou Lorde in the beginning haste layed the foundacion of the earthe: the heauens are the workes of thy handes.
They shal perish, but thou endurest: But they all shall waxe olde as doeth a garmente, and as a vesture shalte thou chaunge them, and they shalbe chaunged.
But thou art euen the same, and thy yeares shall not fayle.
IN the beginning was the worde, and the worde was with God: and God was the worde.
All thinges were made by it, without it was made nothing that was made.
In it was lyfe, and the lyfe was the light of men, and the light shineth in darkenes, and the darkenes co~prehended it not.
There was sente from God a man whose name was Iohn.
Thesame came as a witnes, to beare witnes of the light, that al men through hym mighte beleue.
He was not that light, but was se~t to beare witnes of the light.
That light was the true light, whiche lighteth euery man that cometh into the worlde.
He was in the worlde, the worlde was made by him: the worlde knewe him not.
He came among his owne, and his owne receyued him not: But as many as receyued him, to them gaue he power to be the sonnes of God: eue~ them that beleued on his name, whiche were borne, not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleshe, nor yet of the wil of man, but of God: And thesame worde became fleshe and dwelt amonge vs: and we sawe the glorye of it, as the glorye of the onely begotten sonne of the father, full of grace and trueth.

WHy boastest thou thy selfe, thou tyraunt: that thou canst doe mischiefe? Where as the goodnes of God: endureth yet dayly.
Thy tong imagineth wickednesse: with lyes thou cuttest lyke a sharpe rasor.
Thou hast loued vngraciousnes more then goodnes: and to talke of lyes more then righteousnes.
Thou hast loued to speake all woordes that maye dooe hurt: thou false tongue.
Therefore shall God destroy thee for euer, he shall take thee and plucke thee out of thy dwelling: and roote thee out of the lande of the lyuing.
The ryghteous also shall see thys, and feare: and shall laugh him to skorne.
Loe, this is the man that toke not God for his strength: but trusted vnto the multitude of his riches, and strengthed himselfe in his wickednes.
As for me am lyke a greene Oliue tree in the house of God: my trust is in the tender mercie of God for euer and euer.
will alway geue thankes vnto thee, for that thou hast doone: and will hope in thy name, for thy sainctes lyke it well.
Glorye be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c. GRaunt vs, lorde, to learne to loue our enemies by the exaumple of thy martir Saincte Stephin, who prayed to thee for his persecutours: whiche liuest and reignest. &c.
ANd Stephin beyng full of the holy gost, looked vp stedfastly with his iyes into heauen, and saw the glory of god, and Iesus standing on the right hand of god, and saied: behold, se the heauens open, and the sonne of manne standyng on the right hande of God.
Then they gaue a shoute with a loude voyce, and stopped theyr eares, and ran vpon hym all at once, and cast him out of the citie, and stoned him.
And the witnesses laied downe theyr clothes at a young mans feete, whose name was Saul.
And they stoned Stephin, calling on and saying: Lorde Iesu, receiue my spirite.
And he kneeled down and cryed with a loude voyce: Lorde, lay not this sinne to theyr charge.
And when he had thus spoken, he fell a slepe.
BEholde, sende vnto you prophetes wise men, and Scribes, and some of them ye shall kill crucifye: and some of the~ shall ye scourge in your Sinagogues, and persecute them from citie to citie: that vpon you may come all the righteous bloud whiche hath ben shed vpon the earth, from the bloud of righteous Abel, vnto the bloud of Zacharias the so~ne of Barachias, whome ye slew betwene the te~ple and the altare.
Verely say vnto you: al these thinges shal come vpon this generacion.
Ierusale~, Ierusalem, thou that killeste the Prophetes and stonest them whiche are sente vnto thee: howe often woulde haue gathered thy children together, euen as the henne gathereth her chickens vnder her winges, and ye would not? Behold, your house is left vnto you desolate.
For say vnto you, ye shall not see me hencefoorth, till that ye say: Blessed is he that cummeth in the name of the Lorde.
Â¶And when .xl. yeres were expired, there appeared vnto Moses.
Stephin full of the holy gost. &c. Sainct Iohn Euangelistes daye.
IN the Lord put my trust: how say ye then to my soule, that she shoulde flye as a bird to the hyl? For loe, the vngodly bend their bowe: and make readie their arowes within the bowe, that they may prieuely shoote at them which are trew of hearte.
For the foundacions will be cast downe: and what hath the righteous doone? The Lorde is in his holy temple: the Lordes seate is in heauen.
His eyes considre the poore: and his eye liddes tryeth the children of men.
The Lorde alloweth the righteous: but the vngodly, him that delyteth in wickednes, doeth his soule abhorre.
Vpon the vngodlye he shall rayne snares, fyre and brimstone, storme and tempeste: thys shall bee theyr porcion to drinke.
For the righteous Lorde, loueth righteousnes: his countenaunce will beholde the thing that is iust.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe and euer. &c.
MErcifull Lorde, wee beseche thee to caste thy bryghte beames of lyghte vpon thy Churche: that it beeyng lyghtened by the doctrine of thy blessed Apostle and Euangelist Iohn, may attain to thy euerlasting giftes: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
THat whiche was from the beginning, which we haue hearde, whiche we haue seene with oure eyes, which we haue looked vpon, and our handes haue handled, of the woorde of lyfe.
And the lyfe appeared, and we haue seene and beare witnes, and shewe vnto you that eternall lyfe whiche was with the father, and appeared vnto vs. That whiche we haue sene and hearde, declare we vnto you, that ye also may haue felowship with vs, and that our felowship may bee with the father and his sonne Iesus Christe.
And this write we vnto you, that ye may reioyce, and that your ioy may be ful.
And this is the tydinges which we haue heard of him, and declare vnto you, that God is lyght, and in him is no darkenes at all.
If we say that we haue felowship with him, and walke in darkenesse, we lye, and dooe not the trueth.
But and if we walke in light, eue~ as he is in light, then haue we felowship with him, and the bloud of Iesus Christ his sonne, clenseth vs from all sinne.
If we say we haue no synne, we deceyue our selues, and the trueth is not in vs.
If we knowledge our sinnes, he is faithfull and iust, to forgeue vs our sinnes, and to clense vs from al vnrighteousnes.
If we say we haue not sinned, we make hym a lyer, and his woorde is not in vs.
Peter turned about, and sawe the disciple whome Iesus loued, folowing (whiche also leaned on his breaste at Supper, and sayed: Lorde whiche is he that betrayeth thee?) when Peter therefore sawe him, he sayed to Iesus: Lorde what shall he here dooe? Iesus sayed vnto hym: If wyll haue hym to tarye tyll come, what is that to thee? Folowe thou me.
Then wente this saying abroade among the brethren, that that disciple should not dye.
Yet Iesus sayed not to him, he shal not die: but if wil that he tary til come, what is that to thee? The same disciple is he which testifieth of these thinges, and wrote these thinges: we know that his testimony is true.
There are also many other thynges whiche Iesus dyd, the whiche if they should bee written euery one, suppose the world coulde not co~teine the bookes that should be written.
God, the heathen are come into thyne inheritaunce: thy holy temple haue they defyled, and made Ierusalem an heape of stones.
The dead bodies of thy seruauntes haue they geuen to bee meate vnto the fowles of the ayre: and the fleshe of thy sainctes vnto the beastes of the lande.
Theyr bloud haue they shed like water on euery syde of Ierusalem: and there was no man to bury them.
We are become an open shame to oure enemies: a very skorne and derision vnto them that are rounde aboute vs. Lorde, how long wilt thou be angrie: shall thy gelousye burne lyke fyer for euer? Powre out thyne indignacion vpon the Heathen that haue not knowen thee: and vpon the kingdomes that haue not called vpon thy name.
For they haue deuoured Iacob: and layed waste his dwellyng place.
remember not our olde sinnes, but haue mercye vpon vs and that soone: for we are come to great misery.
Helpe vs, GOD of our saluacion, for the glory of thy name: deliuer vs, and bee mercifull vnto our synnes for thy names sake.
Wherefore dooe the Heathen saye: where is nowe theyr God? lette the vengeaunce of thy seruauntes bloude that is shed: be openly shewed vpon the Heathen in our syght.
let the sorowfull sighing of the prisoners come before thee: accordyng vnto the greatnesse of thy power, preserue thou those that are appointed to dye.
And as for the blasphemye (wherwith our neyghbours haue blasphemed thee:) rewarde thou them, Lord, seuen folde into theyr bosome.
So we that be thy people and shepe of thy pasture, shal geue thee tha~kes for euer: and will alway be shewing furth thy prayse, from generacion to generacion.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe and euer. &c.
ALmightie God whose prayse this day, the young innocentes thy witnesses hath confessed, and shewed foorth, not in speakyng, but in dying: mortifye and kyll all vyces in vs: that in our conuersacion, our lyfe may expresse thy fayth, whiche with our tongues we dooe confesse: through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
Loked, and loe, a lambe stode on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred .xliiij. thousande hauing his name and his fathers name written in theyr foreheades.
And heard a voice from heauen, as the sounde of many waters, and as the voice of a great thundre.
And heard the voice of harpers harping with their harpes.
And they so~g as it were a new song before the seate, and before the .iiij. beastes and the elders, and no man coulde learne the song but the .C. xliiij. thousand, which were redemed from the earth.
These are they which were not defyled with weomen, for they are virgins.
These were redemed from men being the fyrste fruites vnto God, and to the lambe, and in their mouthes was fou~d no guile: for they are without spot before the throne of God.
THe Angel of the Lorde appeared to Ioseph in a slepe, saying: aryse and take the chylde and his mother, and flye into Egypt, and bee thou there till bring thee worde.
For it will come to passe that Herode shall seeke the childe to destroy him.
So when he awoke, he toke the childe and his mother, by nyght, and departed into Egipt, and was there vnto the death of Herode: that it myghte bee fulfilled whiche was spoken of the lord by the prophete, saying: out of Egypt haue called my sonne.
Then Herode when he sawe that he was mocked of the wise men, he was exceadyng wroth, and sent furth men of warre, and slewe al the children that were in Bethleem, and in all the coastes as (many as were .ii. yere olde or vnder) according to the tyme which he had diligently knowen out of the wisemen.
Then was fulfilled that whiche was spoken by the prophete Ieremie, where as he sayde: in Rama was there a voyce hearde, lamentacion, wepyng, and great mourning: Rachel wepyng for her children, woulde not be coumforted, because they were not.
Will lyfte vp myne eyes vnto the hilles: from whence cummeth my helpe? My helpe cummeth euen from the Lorde: whiche hath made heauen and earth.
He will not suffer thy foote to be moued: and he that kepeth thee, will not slepe.
Beholde, he that kepeth Israel: shal neyther slumber nor slepe.
The Lorde himselfe is thy keper: the lorde is thy defence vpon thy right hande.
So that the Sunne shall not burne thee by day: neyther the Moone by night.
The lord shall preserue thee from all euill: yea, it is euen he that shall kepe thy soule.
The lorde shal preserue thy going out, and thy comming in: from this time foorth for euermore.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe and euer. &c.
ANd say, that the heire (as long as he is a child) differeth not from a seruaunt, though he be lorde of all, but is vnder tutours and gouernours, vntill the time that the father hath appointed.
Euen so wee also, when we were children, were in bondage vnder the ordinaunces of the worlde: But when the tyme was full come, God sente his sonne made of a woman, and made bonde vnto the lawe, to redeme them whiche were bonde vnto the lawe: that we through eleccion mighte receyue the inheritaunce that belongeth vnto the naturall sonnes.
Because ye are sonnes, God hath sent the spirite of hys sonne into oure heartes, whiche cryeth Abba father.
Wherfore now, thou arte not a seruaunte, but a sonne: If thou bee a sonne, thou art also an heyre of GOD through Christ.
THis is the boke of the generacio~ of Iesus Christ the sonne of Dauid, the sonne of Abraha~: Abraham begat Isaac: Isaac begat Iacob: Iacob begat Iudas his brethren: Iudas begat Phares Zaram of Thamar: Phares begat Esro~: Esrom begat Aram: Ara~ begat Aminadab: Aminadab begat Naasson: Naasson begat Salmo~: Salmo~ begat Boos of Rahab: Boos begat Obed of Ruth: Obed begat Iesse: Iesse begat Dauid ye king: Dauid the king begat Salomo~, of her that was the wife of Vrie: Salamo~ begat Roboam: Roboam begat Abia: Abia begat Asa: Asa begat Iosaphat: Iosaphat begat Ioram: Ioram begat Osias: Osias begat Ioatham: Ioatham begat Achas: Achas begat Ezechias: Ezechias begat Manasses: Manasses begat Amon: Amon begat Iosias: Iosias begat Ieconias and his brethren, about the tyme that they were caryed awaye to Babilon.
And after they were brought to Babilon, Ieconias begat Salathiell: Salathiell begate Zorobabel: Zorobabel begat Abiud: Abiud begate Eliachim: Eliachim begat Azor: Azor begat Sadoc: Sadoc begat Achin: Achin begat Eliud: Eliud begat Eleasar: Eleasar begat Matthan: Matthan begat Iacob: Iacob begat Ioseph the husbande of Marie: of whome was borne Iesus, euen he that is called Christe.
And so all the generacyons from Abraha~ to Dauid, are .xiiii. generacions.
And from Dauid vnto the captiuitie of Babilon, axe .xiiii. generacions.
And from the captiuitie of Babilon vnto Christe, are .xiiii. generacions.
The birth of Iesus Christe was on thys wyse: When hys mother Mary was maryed to Ioseph (beefore they came to dwell together) she was founde with childe by the holy goste.
Then Ioseph her husbande (because he was a righteous manne, and woulde not put her to shame) was minded prieuely to departe from her.
But whyle he thus thought, behold, the Angel of the lord appeared vnto hym in slepe, saying: Ioseph, thou sonne of Dauid, feare not to take vnto thee Mary thy wyfe: for that which is conceiued in her, cummeth of the holye goste.
She shall bring furth a sonne, and thou shalt call hys name Iesus: for he shall saue his people from theyr sinnes.
All thys was doone, that it mighte be fulfilled whiche was spoken of the lorde by the Prophete, saying: Beholde, a mayde shall bee with chylde, and shall brynge foorthe a sonne, and they shall call hys name Emanuell, whiche if a manne interprete, is asmuche to say as God with vs.
And Ioseph assone as he awoke out of slepe, did as the Angel of the lorde had bidden him: and he toke hys wyfe vnto hym, and knew her not, til she had brought furth her first begotten sonne, and called his name Iesus.
Was glad, when they sayde vnto me: we wil goe into the house of the Lorde.
Ierusalem is buylded as a citie: that is at vnytye in it selfe.
For thither the Tribes goe vp, euen the Tribes of the Lorde: to testifye vnto Israell, to geue thankes vnto the name of the Lorde.
For there is the seate of iudgemente: euen the seate of the house of Dauid.
pray for the peace of Ierusalem: they shall prosper that loue thee.
Peace be within thy walles: and plenteousnes within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions sakes: will wishe thee prosperitie.
Yea because of the house of the Lorde our God: wil seke to doe thee good.
ALmightie God, which madest thy blessed sonne to be circumcised and obedyente to the lawe for manne: graunte vs the true circumcision of thy spirite, that our heartes and all our members being mortifyed from all worldly and carnall lustes, may in all thinges obey thy blessed wil, through the same thy sonne Iesus Christ our Lorde.
BLe&s&sed is that man to whome the Lord wil not impute sinne.
Came this blessednes then vpo~ the vncircu~cisio~, or vpo~ the circu~cisio~ also? for we say, that fayth was rekoned to Abraha~ for righteousnes.
How was it then rekoned? when he was in the circumcision, or when he was in the vncircumcisyon? not in the tyme of circumcision: but when he was yet vncircumcised.
And he receyued the sygne of circumcision, as a seale of the righteousnesse of faith, which he had yet being vncircumcised: that he should bee the father of all them that beleue, though they bee not circumcised, that righteousnes myght be imputed to them also: and that he myghte bee the father of circumcision, not vnto them onely whiche came of the circumcised, but vnto them also that walke in the steppes of the fayth that was in our father Abraham before the time of circumcision.
For the promyse (that he shoulde bee the heyre of the worlde) happened not to Abraham, or to his seede, through the law, but through the righteousnes of faythe.
For if they, whiche are of the lawe, be heyres, then is fayth but vayne, and the promise of none effect.
ANd it fortuned, assoone as the Angels were gone awaye from the shepeheardes into heauen, they sayde one to another: let vs goe nowe euen vnto Bethleem, and see thys thyng that wee heare say is happened, which the lord hath shewed vnto vs.
And they came with haste, and founde Marye and Ioseph, and the Babe laide in a maunger.
And when they had sene it, they published abroade the saying whiche was tolde them of that childe.
And all they that heard it wondered at those thinges whiche were tolde them of the shepeheardes.
But Mary kepte all those sayinges, and pondered them in her heart.
And the shepheardes returned, praising and lauding God, for all the thynges that they had hearde and seene, euen as it was tolde vnto them.
And when the eyght daye was come that the childe shoulde be circumcised, hys name was called Iesus, whiche was named of the Angell before he was conceiued in the woumbe.
At the Communion Syng vnto the Lorde a newe song: syng vnto the Lorde all the whole yearth.
Syng vnto the Lorde, and prayse hys name: be telling of his saluacion from daye to daye.
Declare hys honour vnto the Heathen: and hys woonders vnto all people.
For the lorde is great, and cannot woorthely be praysed: he is more to be feared then all Goddes.
As for all the Goddes of the Heathen, they bee but ydolles: but it is the Lorde that made the heauens.
Glory and wurship are before hym: power and honour are in his sanctuary.
Ascribe vnto the Lorde (O ye kynreds of the people:) ascribe vnto the Lorde, worship and power.
Ascribe vnto the Lorde, the honour due vnto his name: bryng presentes and come into his courtes.
woorshyp the Lorde in the beautie of holynes: let the whole earth stande in awe of hym.
Tell it out among the Heathen, that the lorde is kyng, and that it is he whiche hathe made the rounde worlde so fast, that it cannot be moued: and howe that he shall iudge the people righteously.
Let the heauens reioyce, and let the yearth be glad: let the sea make a noyse and all that therein is.
Let the fielde bee ioyfull and all that is in it: then shall all the trees of the wood reioyce before the Lorde.
For he cummeth, for he cummeth to iudge the yearth: and with righteousnes to iudge the worlde, and the people with his trueth.
God whiche by the leadyng of a starre diddest manyfeste thy onelye begotten sonne to the Gentiles: Mercifully graunt that we which know thee now by faythe, maye after thys lyfe haue the fruicion of thy glorious Godhead, through Christ our Lorde.
FOr thys cause Paule am a pryesoner of Iesus Christe for you heathen: if ye haue hearde of the ministracion of the grace of god, which is geuen me to you warde.
For by reuelacyon shewed he the misterye vnto me, as wrote afore in few wordes, wherby, whe~ ye reade, ye maye vnderstande my knoweledge in the mysterye of Christe: whiche mysterye in tymes passed was not opened vnto the sonnes of menne, as it is nowe declared vnto hys holy Apostles and Prophetes by the spirite: that the Gentiles should be inheritours also, and of the same bodye, and partakers of hys promyse in Christe, by the meanes of the Gospell, whereof am made a minister, accordyng to the gifte of the grace of God, which is geuen vnto me after the woorkyng of hys power.
Vnto me the leaste of all sainctes is thys grace geuen, that shoulde preache amonge the Gentiles, the vnsearcheable ryches of Christe, and to make all men see what the felowshyppe of the misterie is, whiche from the beginning of the worlde, hath bene hydde in God, whiche made all thinges through Iesus Christe: to the entente, that nowe vnto the rulers and powers in heauenly thinges, might be knowen, by the congregacyon, the manifolde wisedome of God, according to the eternal purpose whiche he wrought in Christ Iesu our lorde, by whome we haue boldenes and entraunce, with the confidence whiche is by the fayth of him.
WHen Iesus was borne in Bethlee~ a citie of Iury, in the tyme of Herode the kyng: Beholde, there came wise men from the East to Ierusale~, saying: where is he that is borne kyng of Iewes? For we haue seene hys starre in the East, and are come to wurship hym.
When Herode the kyng had hearde these thynges, he was troubled and all the citie of Ierusalem with hym.
And when he had gathered al the chiefe priestes and scribes of the people together, he demaunded of them where Christe shoulde bee borne.
For thus it is written by the Prophete: And thou Bethleem in the land of Iury, art not the leaste among the prynces of Iuda, for out of thee there shall come vnto me the capitaine that shal gouerne my people Israell.
Then Herode (when he had prieuelye called the wise men) he inquired of them diligentlye what tyme the starre appeared, and he bad them goe to Bethleem, and said: goe your way thither and searche dilygentlye for the chylde.
And when ye haue found him, bryng me woorde agayne, that may come and woorship him also. whe~ they had hearde the kyng, they departed: and loe, the starre whiche they sawe in the Easte, wente beefore them tyll it came and stoode ouer the place wherein the chylde was.
When they sawe the starre, they were exceading glad and wente into the house, and founde the childe with Mary hys mother, and fell downe flat and wurshypped hym, and opened theyr treasures and offered vnto hym giftes: Golde, Frankincense, and Mirre.
And after they were warned of God in slepe (that they should not goe agayne to Herode) they returned into theyr owne countrey another way.
After this he went downe to Capernaum. vnto the ende.
HOwe long wilt thou forget me, Lorde, for euer? howe long wilt thou hyde thy face from me? Howe long shall seke counsell in my soule, and be so vexed in my heart? howe long shall myne enemye triumphe ouer me? Consider and heare me, lorde my God: lyghten myne eyes that slepe not in death.
Leste myne enemye saye, haue prenayled agaynste him: for if be cast downe, they that trouble me will reioyce at it.
But my trust is in thy mercye: and my hearte is ioyfull in thy saluacion.
wil sing of the lorde, because he hath dealt so louyngly with me: (yea will prayse the name of the Lorde the moste highest.)
LOrde we beseche thee, mercifullye to receyue the praiers of thy people whiche call vpon thee: and graunt that they maye both perceyue and knowe what thynges they ought to do, and also haue grace and power faithully to fullfyll the same.
Besech you therefore brethren, by the mercifulnes of God, that ye make youre bodies a quicke sacrifice, holy and acceptable vnto God, whiche is your resonable seruyng of god, and fashion not your selfes like vnto this world: but be ye chaunged in your shape by the renuing of youre minde, that ye maie proue what thing that good and acceptable and perfect will of god is.
For saye (throughe the grace that vnto me geuen is) to euery man amonge you, that no man stand hygh in his owne conceite, more then it becommeth hym to esteme of hymselfe: but so iudge of himselfe, that he be gentle and sobre, according as God hath dealt to euery man the measure of faith: for as we haue many membres in one body and all membres haue not one office: so we being many, are one body in Christ, and euery man amo~g our selues, one anothers members.
THe father and mother of Iesus wente to Hierusalem after the custome of the feast day.
And when they had fulfilled the dayes: as they returned home, the child Iesus abode stil in Ierusalem, and his father and mother knewe not of it: but they supposing hym to haue beene in the cumpanye, came a dayes iourney and sought hym amo~g their kinsfolke and acquaintaunce.
And when they found hym not, they went backe again to Ierusalem, and soughte hym.
And it fortuned that after three dayes they founde him in the temple, sytting in the middest of the doctours, hearyng them and posing them.
And all that heard hym, were astonied at his vnderstanding and answers.
And when they saw hym, they meruailed, and his mother sayd vnto him: Sonne, why haste thou thus dealte with vs? Beholde, thy father haue sought thee sorowing.
And he sayd vnto them: how happened it that ye sought me? wiste ye not that muste go about my fathers busines? And they vnderstode not that saying, which he spake vnto them.
And he went downe with the~, and came to Nazareth, and was obedient vnto them: but his mother kept all these sayinges together in her heart.
And Iesus prospered in wisdome and age, and in fauour with god and men.
THe foole hath sayd in his heart: there is no god.
They are corrupte and become abhominable in theyr doinges: there is not one that doeth good (no not one.)
The lorde loked downe from heauen vpon the children of men: to see if there were any that woulde vnderstand and seeke after God.
But they are all gone out of the waye, they are altogether become abominable: there is none that doeth good (no not one.)
Their throte is an open sepulchre: with their tongues thei haue deceyued, the poyson of Aspes is vnder theyr lippes.
Theyr mouth is full of curssyng and bitternes: theyr feete are swift to shed bloud.
Destruccion and vnhappines is in theyr wayes: and the way of peace haue they not knowen, there is no feare of God before theyr eyes.
Haue they no knowlege, that they are all suche woorkers of mischiefe, eating vp my people as it were bread, and call not vpon the Lorde? There were they brought in great feare (euen where no feare was) for god is in the generacion of the righteous.
As for you, ye haue made a mocke at the counsayl of the poore: because he putteth his trust in the lorde.
Who shall geue saluacion vnto Israell out of Sion? when the lorde turneth the captiuitie of his people: then shall Iacob reioyce and Israell be glad.
ALmightie and euerlasting God, which dooest gouerne all thinges in heauen and earthe: mercifully heare the supplicacions of thy people, and graunt vs thy peace all the dayes of our lyfe.
SEing that we haue dyuerse gyftes, according to the grace that is geuen vnto vs: if any man haue the gift of prophecy, let hym haue it, that it be agreeing to the faith.
Let hym that hath an office waite on his office.
If any man geue, let hym do it with singlenes.
If any man shew mercy, let him do it with cherefulnes.
Hate that whiche is euill, and cleaue vnto that whiche is good.
Be not slothefull in the busines which ye haue in ha~d.
Blesse them whiche persecute you: blesse, say, and curse not.
Be mery with them that are mery: wepe also with them that wepe: bee of like affeccion one towardes another.
Bee not hie minded, but make youre selues equall to them of the lower sorte.
ANd the third daye was there a mariage in Cana a citie of Galile, and the mother of Iesus was there.
And Iesus was called (and his disciples) vnto the mariage.
And when the wine fayled, the mother of Iesus saide vnto him: thei haue no wine.
Iesus said vnto her: woman, what haue to doe with thee? mine houre is not yet come.
His mother said vnto the ministers: whatsoeuer he sayeth vnto you, do it.
And there were standyng there vi. waterpottes of stone, after the maner of the purifying of the Iewes, conteyning .ii. or .iii. fyrkyns a peece.
Iesus sayde vnto them: fill the watter pottes with water.
And he saide vnto them: draw out now, and beare vnto the Gouernour of the feast.
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was turned into wine, and knewe not whence it was (but the ministers, whiche drewe the water, knewe) he called the bridegrome, and sayd vnto him: Euerie man at the beginning doth set forth good wine, and when men be dronke, then that which is woorse, but thou haste kepte the good wine vntill now.
This beginning of miracles did Iesus in Cana of Galile, and shewed his glorye, and his disciples beleued on him.
LOrde, who shal dwelle in thy tabernacle? who shal reste vpon thy holye hill? Euen he that leadeth an vncorrupte lyfe, and dothe the thing whiche is right: and speaketh the truthe from his hearte.
He that hath vsed no deceyt in his tongue: nor done euil to his neighbour, and hath not slaundered his neighbours.
He that setteth not by hymselfe, but is lowelye in his owne iyes: and maketh much of them that feare the lorde.
He that sweareth vnto his neyghbour and disapointeth hym not: though it were to his owne hinderaunce.
He that hath not geuen his money vnto vsury: nor taken rewarde against the innocente.
ALmightie and euerlasting God, mercyfullye looke vpon oure infirmities, and in all our daungiers and necessities, stretche foorthe thy ryghte hande to helpe and defende vs, through Christe our Lorde.
Prouide aforehande thynges honest, not onely before God, but also in the syghte of all men.
If it be possible (as much as is in you) liue peaceably with all menne.
Dearely beloued, auenge not youre selues, but rather geue place vnto wrath.
For it is written: vengeaunce is myne, will rewarde sayth the lorde.
Therfore, if thyne enemie hunger, feede him: if he thirst, geue him drynke.
For in so dooyng, thou shalte heape coales of fyre on his heade.
Be not ouercome of euill, but ouercome euill with goodnes.
WHen he was come downe from the mountayne, muche people folowed hym.
And beholde there came a Leper and wurshipped him, saying? Maister, if thou wilte, thou canst make me cleane.
And Iesus putte foorth his hande and touched hym, saying: will, be thou cleane: and immediatelye his Leprosye was cleansed.
And Iesus said vnto him: see thou tel no manne, but goe and shew thy selfe to the priest, offer the gift (that Moses co~maunded to be offered) for a witnesse vnto them.
And when Iesus was entred into Capernaum, there came vnto hym a Centurion, and besoughte hym, saying: Maister, my seruaunt lieth at home sicke of the paulsey, and is grieuously payned.
And Iesus sayde: when come vnto him wil heale him.
The Centurion aunswered, and sayd: Sir am not woorthye that thou shouldeste come vnder my roofe: but speake the word onely, my seruaunt shalbe healed.
For also my selfe am a ma~ subiect to the autoritie of another, and haue souldiers vnder me: and say to thys manne, goe, and he goeth: and to another manne, come, and he cummeth: and to my seruaunt, doe this, and he doeth it.
When Iesus heard these woordes, he merueyled, and sayde to them that folowed hym: verely saye vnto you, haue not founde so great fayth in Israell.
saye vnto you, that many shall come from the Easte, and Weste, and shall reste with Abraham, and Isaac and Iacob, in the kingdome of heauen: but the chyldren of the kyngdome shall be caste out into vtter darkenes, there shalbe wepyng and gnashyng of teeth.
And Iesus sayde vnto the Centurion: Goe thy way, and as thou beleueste so bee it vnto thee: and hys seruaunte was healed in the selfe same houre.
WHy doe the Heathen so furiously rage together? and why doe the people imagin a vayne thyng? The kynges of the earthe stande vp, and the rulers take counsel together: agaynst the Lorde and agaynst his anoynted.
Let vs breake theyr bondes a sunder: and caste awaye theyr coardes from vs.
He that dwelleth in heauen, shal laugh them to skorne: the Lorde shall haue them in derision.
Then shall he speake vnto them in his wrath: and vexe them in his sore displeasure.
Yet haue set my king: vpon my holy hill of Sion.
will preache the lawe, wherof the Lorde hath sayd vnto me: thou art my sonne, this day haue begotten thee.
Desire of me, and shal geue thee the heathen for thine inheritaunce: and the vttermoste partes of the earth for thy possession.
Thou shalt bruise them with a rod of yron: and breake them in pieces lyke a potters vessell.
Be wyse nowe therefore, ye kinges: be learned ye that are iudges of the yearth.
Serue the Lorde in feare: and reioyce (vnto hym) with reuerence.
Kisse the sonne lest he be angrie, and so ye peryshe from the righte waye: if hys wrathe be kiendled (yea but a lytle) blessed are all they that put theyr trust in him.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne, and to the. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer shalbe. &c.
GOd, whiche knoweste vs to be set in the myddeste of so many and great daungers, that for mans fraylnesse we cannot alwayes stande vprightly: Graunt to vs the health of body and soule, that all those thynges whiche we suffer for synne, by thy helpe we maye well passe and ouercome, through Christ our Lorde.
LEt euery soule submit hymselfe vnto the auctoritie of the hygher powers: for there is no power but of God.
The powers that bee, are ordeyned of God, whosoeuer therfore resisteth power, resisteth the ordinau~ce of God: But they that resyste, shall receyue to themselues da~nacion.
For rulers are not feareful to them that do good but to them that doe euil.
Wilt thou be without feare of the power? do wel then, so shalt thou be praysed of the same: for he is the minister of God, for thy wealth.
But yf thou doe that whiche is euyll, then feare, for he beareth not the sweorde for noughte: for he is the minister of God to take vengeaunce on him that doth euil.
Wherfore, ye must nedes obey, not onely for feare of vengeaunce, but also because of conscience: and euen for this cause paye ye tribute: For they are goddes ministers seruing for the same purpose.
Geue to euery man therefore hys duetye: tribute, to whome tribute belo~geth: custome, to whom custome is due: feare, to whom feare belongeth: honour, to whome honour pertayneth.
ANd when he entred into a ship, his disciples folowed him.
And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuche that the shyp was couered with waues, but he was aslepe.
And his disciples came to him, awoke hym, saying: Maister saue vs, we perishe.
And he sayth vnto them: why are ye feareful, ye of litle faith? Then he arose, rebuked the windes and the sea and there folowed a greate calme.
But the men meruailed, saying: what maner of man is thys, that both wyndes and sea obey hym? And when he was come to the other side, into the countrey of the Gergesites, there met him .ii. possessed of deuilles, whiche came out of the graues, and were out of measure fierce, so that no man might goe by that way.
And beholde, they cryed out, saying: Iesu, thou sonne of God, what haue we to dooe with thee? Arte thou come hither to torment vs before the tyme? And there was a good way of from them, a heerd of many Swyne feeding.
So the deuils besoughte hym, saying: If thou caste vs oute, suffre vs to goe into the heerde of Swyne.
Then wente they oute and departed into the heerde of Swine.
And beholde, the whole heerd of Swine was caryed hedlong into the sea peryshed in the waters.
Then they that kept them fled, and went theyr wayes into the citie, and tolde euery thyng, what had happened vnto the possessed of the deuils.
And behold, the whole citie came out to mete Iesus: and when they sawe hym, they besought him that he would depart out of theyr coastes.
THe Lord heare thee in the day of trouble: the name of the God of Iacob defende thee.
Sende thee helpe from the Sanctuary: and strength thee out of Sion.
Remember all thy offerynges: and accepte thy brente sacrifice Graunte thee thy heartes desyre: and fulfyll all thy mynde.
We will reioyce in thy saluacion, and tryumphe in the name of the Lorde oure God: the Lorde perfourme all thy peticions.
Now knowe that the Lorde helpeth hys anoynted, and will heare him from hys holye heauen: euen with the wholesome strength of his right hand.
Some put their trust in Chariotes, and some in horses: but we will remembre the name of the Lorde our God.
They are brought downe and fallen: but we are risen and stand vpright.
Saue Lorde, and heare vs, kyng of heauen: when we call vpon thee.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
LOrde we beseche thee to kepe thy Churche housholde continually in thy true religion: that they whiche dooe leane onelye vpon hope of thy heauenlye grace, maye euermore be defended by thy myghtie power: Through Christ our Lorde.
PVt vpon you as the electe of God, tendre mercye, kyndnes, humblenes of mynde, mekenes, long sufferyng, forbearyng one an other, and forgeuyng one an other, if any man haue a querell agaynst another: as Christ forgaue you, euen so do ye.
Aboue al these thinges, put on loue, which is the bond of perfectnes.
And the peace of God rule in your heartes: to the whiche peace ye are called in one bodye: And see that ye bee thankefull.
Let the woorde of Christe dwell in you plenteouslye, with all wysedome.
Teache and exhorte youre owne selues in Psalmes and Himnes and spirituall songes, syngyng with grace in your heartes to the Lord.
And whatsoeuer ye doe in woord or dede, doe all in the name of the Lorde Iesu, geuing thankes to God the father by hym.
THe kyngdome of heauen is lyke vnto a manne whiche sowed good seede in hys fielde: but whyle menne slepte, hys enemy came, and sowed tares amonge the wheat, and wente his waye.
But when the blade was sprong vp, and had broughte furthe fruite, then appeared the tares also.
So the seruauntes of the housholder came, and sayd vnto hym: Sir, dydst not thou sowe good seede in thy fielde? from whence then hathe it tares? he sayde vnto them: the enuyous manne hath doone thys.
The seruauntes said vnto him: wilte thou then that we goe and wede them vp? But he sayde, naye leste whyle ye gather vp the tares, ye plucke vp also the wheate with them: lette bothe growe together vntill the haruest: and in tyme of harueste, will say to the reapers: gather ye firste the tares and bynde them together in sheaues to be brente: but gather the wheate into my barne.
The .vi. sonday (if there bee so many) shall haue the same Psalme, Collect, Epistle, and Gospell, that was vpon the .v.
He shall feede me in a greene pasture: and leade me furth besyde the waters of coumforte.
He shall conuerte my soule: and bryng me foorthe in the pathes of righteousnes, for his names sake.
Yea, though walke through the valley of the shadowe of death: will feare no euil, for thou art with me, thy rodde and thy staffe coumfort me.
Thou shalt prepare a table before me agaynst them that trouble me: thou haste annoynted my head with oyle, and my cup shalbe full.
But thy louyng kyndenes and mercye shall folowe me all the dayes of my life: and will dwell in the house of the Lorde for euer.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: world without ende.
Lord, we beseche thee fauourably to heare the prayers of thy people, that we whiche are iustlye punyshed for our offences: may be mercyfully deliuered by thy goodnes, for the glory of thy name: through Iesu Christ our sauiour, who liueth and reigneth. &c.
PErceyue ye not, howe that they whiche runne in a course, runne all, but one receyueth the rewarde? So runne that ye may obtayne: Euerye man that proueth masteryes, abstayneth from all thynges.
And they doe it to obtayn a crowne that shall perishe, but we to obtaine an euerlasting crowne.
So fight I, not as one that beateth the ayre: but tame my body, and bryng it into subieccion, leste by any meanes it come to passe, that when haue preached to other, my selfe should be a castawaye.
THe kingdome of heauen is lyke vnto a manne that is an housholder, which went out early in the morning to hyre labourers into his vineyard.
And whe~ the agremente was made with the labourers for a peny a daye, he sent them into his vineyarde.
And he wente out about the thirde houre, and sawe other standyng idle in the markette place, and sayed vnto them: Goe ye also into the vineyarde, and whatsoeuer is ryght, wyll geue you.
Againe he went out about the vi. houre, and dyd lykewyse.
And about the .xi. houre he went out, and founde other standing idle, and sayd vnto them: why stand ye here all the daye idle? They sayde vnto hym: because no man hath hyred vs.
He sayeth vnto them: Goe ye also into the vineyarde, and whatsoeuer is ryght, that shall ye receyue.
So, when euen was come, the Lorde of the vineyarde sayde vnto his stewarde: call the laborers and geue them theyr hyre, begynning at the last vntill the first.
And whe~ they did come that came about the xi. houre, they receiued euery man a peny: But when the firste came also, they supposed that they should haue receyued more, they lykewyse receiued euery man a peny.
And when they had receiued it, they murmured againste the goodman of the house, saying: these last haue wrought but one houre, thou haste made them equall with vs, whiche haue borne the burthen and heate of the day.
But he aunswered vnto one of them, and sayd: Frende, do thee no wrong, diddest thou not agree with me for a peny? Take that thyne is, and go thy waye: will geue vnto this last, euen as vnto thee.
Is it not lawful for me to do as me lusteth with mine owne goodes? Is thine eye euil because am good? So the last shalbe first, and the first shalbe last.
THe earth is the Lordes, and all that therin is: the compasse of the worlde, and they that dwell therin.
For he hath founded it vpon the seas: and prepared it vpon the fluddes.
Who shall ascende into the hyll of the Lorde? or who shal ryse vp in his holy place? Euen he that hath cleane handes and a pure heart: and that hath not lifte vp his mynde vnto vanitie, nor sworne to deceiue his neighbour.
He shall receiue the blessyng from the Lorde: and righteousnes from the God of his saluacion.
This is the generacion of them that seke him: euen of them that seke thy face, Iacob.
Lifte vp your heades (O ye gates) and be ye lifte vp ye euerlastyng doores: and the kyng of glory shall come in.
Who is this king of glory? it is the Lorde, strong and mightie: euen the Lorde mightie in battayll.
Lifte vp your heades (O ye gates) and be ye lifte vp ye euerlasting doores: and the king of glory shall come in.
Who is this kyng of glory? euen the Lorde of hostes, he is the kyng of glory.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
LOrde God, whiche seest that we put not our trust in anye thyng that we do: mercifully graunte that by thy power we may be defended against all aduersitie, through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
YE suffre fooles gladly, seeyng ye youre selues are wyse.
For ye suffre if a man bryng you into bondage: if a man deuour: if a man take: if a man exalt himselfe: if a man smite you on the face.
speake as concernyng rebuke, as though we hadde been weake in this behalfe.
Howbeit, wherinsoeuer any man dare be bold (I speake folishly) dare be bold also.
They are the seede of Abraham, euen so am I.
They are the ministers of Christe, (I speake as a foole) am more: In labours more aboundaunte: In stripes aboue measure: In prison more plenteously: In death ofte: Of the Iewes fyue tymes receiued xl. stripes saue one: Thrise was beaten with rods: was once stoned: suffered thrise ship wracke: Night and daye haue been in the depe sea.
In iorneying often: in parels of waters: in parels of robbers: in ieopardyes of myne owne nacion: in ieopardyes among the heathen: in parels in the citie: in parels in wyldernes: in parels in the sea: in parels among false brethren: in labour and trauayle: in watchynges often: in hunger and thyrste: in fastinges often: in cold and nakednes: beside the thinges whiche outwardly happen vnto me, am combred dayly, and do care for al congregacions.
Who is weake, and am not weake? who is offended, and burne not? If muste nedes boast, wil boast of the thinges that concerne myne infirmities.
The God father of our Lorde Iesus Christ, whiche is blessed for euermore, knoweth that lye not.
WHen muche people were gathered together, were come to hym out of all cyties, he spake by a similytude.
The sower went out to sowe his sede: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side, and it was troden doune, and the foules of the ayre deuoured it vp.
And some fell on stones, assone as it was sprong vp, it withered away, because it lacked moistnes.
And some fell among thornes, and the thornes spra~g vp with it choked it.
And some fel on good ground, and sprang vp and bare fruite an hundreth folde.
And as he sayed these thinges, he cryed: he that hath eares to heare, let hym heare.
And his disciples asked hym, saying: what mane of similitude is this? And he sayed: vnto you it is geuen to knowe the secretes of the kingdome of God: but to other by parables, that whe~ they see, they should not see, when they heare, they should not vnderstand.
The parable is this: The sede is the worde of God: those that are beside the way, are they that heare: the~ cometh the deuyll and taketh away the worde out of their heartes, leste they should beleue and be saued.
They on the stones, are they which when they heare, receiue the worde with ioy: these haue no rootes, which for a while beleue, and in time of temptacion go awaye.
And that which fell among thornes, are they which when they haue heard, go furth, and are choked with cares and ryches, and voluptuous lyuyng, and bring furth no fruite.
That whiche fell in the good grounde, are they whiche with a pure and good heart, heare the worde and kepe it, and bryng furth fruite through pacience.
BE thou my iudge, Lorde, for haue walked innocently: my trust hath been also in the Lord therfore shall not fall.
Examine me, Lorde, and proue me: trye out my raynes and my heart.
For thy louing kindnes is before mine iyes: and will walke in thy trueth.
haue not dwelt with vaine persons: neither wil haue felowship with the deceiptfull.
haue hated the congregacion of the wycked: and will not syt among the vngodly.
ill washe my handes in innocencie, Lorde: and so will go to thyne alter.
That may shewe the voyce of thankesgeuyng: and tell of all thy wonderous workes.
Lorde, haue loued the habitacion of thy house: and the place where thyne honour dwelleth.
shutte not vp my soule with the sinners: nor my lyfe with the bloudthursty.
In whose handes is wickednes: and theyr ryght hande is full of gyftes.
But as for me will walke innocently: Lorde deliuer me, and be mercifull vnto me.
My foote standeth ryght: will prayse the Lorde in the congregacions.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
Lord which doest teache vs, that all our doinges without charitie are nothing worthe: sende thy holy goste and powre into oure heartes that moste excellent gyfte of charitie, the very bonde of peace and all vertues, without the whiche, whosoeuer lyueth is counted dead before thee: Graunt this, for thy onely sonne Iesus Christes sake.
THough speake with the tongues of menne and of aungels, and haue no loue, am euen as sounding brasse, or as a tynklyng Cimball.
And though could prophecy, and vnderstode all secretes, and all knowledge: yea, if haue al faith, so that can moue mou~taines out of their places, and yet haue no loue, am nothing.
And though bestowe all my goodes to fede the poore, though gaue my body euen that burned, yet haue no loue, it profiteth me nothyng.
Loue suffreth long, is courteous: loue enuieth not: loue doeth not frowardly, swelleth not, dealeth not dishonestly, seketh not her owne, is not prouoked to anger, thynketh none euil, reioyseth not in iniquitie.
But reioyseth in the truth, suffereth al thinges, beleueth all thynges, hopeth all thynges, endureth all thinges.
Though that prophecying faile, eyther tongues cease, or knowledge vanishe awaye, yet loue falleth neuer awaye.
For our knowledge is vnperfect, and our propheciyng is vnperfect: But when that which is perfect is come, then that whiche is vnperfect shalbe done awaye.
When was a childe, spake as a childe: vnderstode as a childe: imagined as a childe.
Now we see in a glasse, euen in a darke speaking: but then shall we see face to face.
Nowe knowe vnperfectly: but then shal knowe euen as am knowen.
Nowe abydeth fayth, hope, and loue, euen these thre: but the chiefe of these is loue.
IE&sus toke vnto him the .xii. and said vnto them: beholde we go vp to Ierusalem, and al shalbe fulfilled that are wrytten by the Prophetes of the sonne of man.
For he shalbe deliuered vnto the Gentyles, and shalbe mocked, and despitefully intreated, and spitted on.
And when they haue scourged him, they will put him to death, and the third day he shall ryse again.
And this saying was hid from the~, so that they perceyued not the thinges which were spoken.
And it came to passe, that as he was come nigh vnto Hierico, a certayne blynde man sate by the hye waye syde, beggyng.
And when he heard the people passe by, he asked what it ment.
And they sayd vnto him, that Iesus of Nazareth passed by.
And he cryed, saying: Iesu thou sonne of Dauid, haue mercy on me.
And they which went before rebuked him, that he should holde his peace.
But he cryed so muche the more: thou sonne of Dauid haue mercye on me.
And Iesus stode styll, and commaunded hym to bee brought vnto hym.
And when he was come nere, he asked him, saying: what wilt thou that doe vnto thee? and he sayd: Lorde, that may receyue my sight.
And Iesus sayd vnto him: receiue thy sight, thy fayth hath saued thee.
And immediatly he receyued his sight, and folowed hym praysing God.
And al the people, when they sawe it, gaue praise vnto God.
Lord, rebuke me not in thyne indignacion: neyther chasten me in thy displeasure.
Haue mercy vpon me, Lorde, for am weake: Lorde heale me, for my bones are vexed.
My soule also is soore troubled: but Lorde howe long wilt thou punishe me? Turne thee, Lorde, and delyuer my soule: Oh saue me for thy mercies sake.
For in death no man remembreth thee: and who wyll geue thee thankes in the pyt? am wery of my groning, euery night washe my bed: and water my couche with my teares.
My beautie is gone for very trouble: and worne awaye because of all myne enemyes.
Awaye fro me all ye that worke vanitie: for the Lorde hath heard the voyce of my wepyng.
The Lorde hath heard my peticion: the Lorde wyll receyue my prayer.
All myne enemies shalbe confounded and sore vexed: they shalbe turned backe and put to shame sodainly.
ALmightie and euerlasting God, which hatest nothing that thou haste made, and doest forgeue the synnes of al them that be penitent: Create and make in vs newe and contrite heartes, that we worthely lamenting our synnes, and knowlegyng oure wretchednes, may obtayne of thee, the God of all mercy, perfecte remission and forgeuenesse, through Iesus Christe.
TVrne you vnto me with all your heartes, with fasting, weping and mourning: rent your heartes, and not your clothes.
Turne you vnto the Lorde your God, for he is gracious mercifull, long sufferyng, and of great compassion, and ready to pardon wickednes.
Then (no doubt) he also shall turne and forgeue: and after his chastening he shall let your increase remaine for meate and drinke offeringes vnto the Lorde youre God.
Blowe out with the trompet in Sion, proclaime a fastyng, call the congregacion, and gather the people together: warne the congregacion, gather the elders, bring the childre~, and sucklinges together.

Let the priestes serue the Lorde betwene the Porche and the alter, weping and saying: be fauorable, Lorde, be fauorable vnto thy people: let not thyne heritage be brought to suche confusion, leste the heathen be Lordes therof.
Wherfore should they say among the Heathen: where is nowe theyr God? The Gospell.
WHen ye faste, bee not sad as the Hipocrites are, for they disfigure theyr faces that it may appeare vnto men howe that they fast.
But thou, when thou fasteste, annoynte thyne head, and washe thy face, that it appeare not vnto men howe that thou fasteste, but vnto thy father whiche is in secrete: and thy father whiche seeth in secrete, shall reward thee openly.
Lay not vp for your selues treasure vpon earth, where the rust and moth doth corrupt, and where theues breake through and steale.
But laye vp for you treasures in heauen, where neither rust nor moth doth corrupt, where theues doe not breake through nor steale.
For where your treasure is, there wil your heartes be also.
BLe&s&sed is he, whose vnryghteousnesse is forgeuen: and whose synne is couered.
Blessed is the man, vnto whom the Lorde imputeth no sinne: and in whose spirite there is no guile.
For while helde my tongue: my bones consumed awaye thorough my dayly complayning.
For thy hande is heauy vpon me both daye and night: and my moysture is lyke the drought in Somer.
will knowlage my sinne vnto thee: and mine vnrighteousnes haue not hyd.
sayd, will confesse my sinnes vnto the Lorde: and so thou forgauest the wickednesse of my sinne.
For this shall euery one that is Godly, make his prayer vnto thee, in a time when thou maiest be founde: but in the great water floudes, they shall not come nye him.

Lorde, whiche for oure sake, dyddeste faste fortye dayes and fourtye nyghtes: Geue vs grace to vse suche abstinence, that our fleshe beeyng subdued to the spirite, wee maye euer obeye thy Godlye mocyons, in righteousnes and true holynes, to thy honour and glorye: whiche liuest and reignest. &c.
WE as helpers exhort you, that ye receyue not the grace of god in vain.
For he saith: haue heard thee in a tyme accepted: and in the daye of saluacyon haue succoured thee.
Beholde, nowe is that accepted tyme: beholde, nowe is that day of saluacion.
Let vs geue no occasyon of euill, that in oure office be founde no faute, but in all thinges let vs behaue our selues as the ministers of God: In much pacience, in affliccions, in necessities, in anguishes, in stripes, in prieso~me~tes, in strifes: in labours, in watchynges, in fastynges, in purenes, in knowledge, in long suffering, in kyndenes, in the holy goste, in loue vnfayned, in the worde of trueth, in the power of God: by the armour of ryghteousnes of the ryghte hande and on the lefte: by honour and dyshonour: by euyll reporte and good reporte: as deceiuers, and yet true: as vnknowen, and yet knowen: as dying, and beholde we lyue: as chastened and not kylled: as sorowyng and yet alwaye mery: as poore and yet make manye ryche: as hauyng nothyng, and yet possessing all thinges.
THen was Iesus led awaye of the spirite into wyldernesse, to bee tempted of the deuyll.
And when he had fasted fourty daies and fourty nightes, he was at the laste an hungred.
And when the tempter came to hym, he sayde, if thou bee the sonne of God, commaunde that these stones be made breade.
But he aunswered and sayd: it is written, man shal not liue by bread only, but by euery woord that procedeth out of the mouth of god.
Then the deuyll taketh hym vp into the holye citye, and setteth hym on a pynacle of the temple, and sayeth vnto hym: if thou be the sonne of God, cast thy selfe downe headlong.
For it is written: he shall geue hys Aungels charge ouer thee, and with theyr handes they shall holde thee vp, lest at any tyme thou dashe thy foote agaynst a stone.
And Iesus sayd vnto him: it is written agayne: Thou shalt not tempt the Lorde thy God.
Agayne, the deuyll taketh hym vp into an exceding hygh mountayne, and sheweth hym al the kyngdomes of the worlde, and the glorye of them, and sayeth vnto hym: all these will geue thee, if thou wylte fall downe and wurship me.

For this is the will of God, euen your holynes, that ye shoulde abstayne from fornicacion, and that euery one of you shoulde knowe howe to kepe his vessell in holynes and honour, and not in the luste of concupiscence as do the Heathen, which know not God: that no man oppresse and defraude hys brother in bergaynyng: because that the lord is the aue~ger of al such thinges, as we tolde you before, and testifyed.
For God hath not called vs vnto vnclennesse, but vnto holynes.
He therfore that despyseth, despyseth not manne, but God whiche hath sente his holy spirite among you.
IE&sus wente thence, and departed into the coastes of Tyre and Sidon: and beholde, a woman of Canaan (whiche came oute of the same coastes) cryed vnto hym, saying: haue mercye on me, Lord, thou so~ne of Dauid: My daughter is pieteously vexed with a deuyll.
And hys disciples came and besought him, saying: send her awaye, for she cryeth after vs.
But he aunswered, and sayd: am not sent, but to the lost shepe of the house of Israell.
He answered said: it is not mete to take the childrens bread, and cast it to dogges.
She answered and sayd: truth Lorde, for the dogges eate of the crummes which fal from theyr maisters table.
Then Iesus aunswered, and said vnto her: woman, great is thy faythe, be it vnto thee, euen as thou wilt.
And her daughter was made whole euen at the same time.
GEue sentence with me (O God) and defende my cause agaynste the vngodly people: Oh deliuer me from the deceiptfull and wicked man.
For thou arte the God of my strengthe, why haste thou put me from thee? and why goe so heauely, while the enemye oppresseth me? Oh sende out thy light and thy trueth, that they maye leade me: bryng me vnto thy holy hyll, to thy dwellyng.
And that may goe vnto the aultare of God, euen vnto the God of my ioye and gladnesse: and vpon the harpe will geue thankes vnto thee (O God) my God.
Why art thou so heauy (O my soule:) and why art thou so disquieted within me? put thy trust in God: for wil yet geue him thankes whiche is the helpe of my countenaunce and my God.
WE beseche thee almightie God looke vpon the hartye desyres of thy humble seruauntes: and stretche foorth the right hande of thy maiestie, to be our defence agaynste all our enemyes: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
BE you the folowers of god as dere children, and walke in loue, euen as Christ loued vs, and gaue himselfe for vs an offring a sacrifice of a swete sauour to god.
As for fornication al vnclennes or couetousnes, let it not bee once named among you, as it becu~meth sainctes: or filthines, or folish talking, or iestyng, whiche are not comely, but rather geuyng of thankes.
For this ye knowe, that no whoremonger, eyther vncleane persone, or couetous persone (whiche is a wurshypper of ymages) hath any inheritaunce in the kyngdome of Christ and of God.
For because of such thynges, cummeth the wrath of God vpon the childre~ of disobedience.
Ye were sumtyme darkenes, but now are ye lighte in the Lord: walke as children of lighte, for the fruite of the spirite consisteth in all goodnes, and righteousnes, truth.
Accepte that whiche is pleasyng vnto the Lorde, and haue no felowship with the vnfruitfull workes of darkenes, but rather rebuke them.
For it is a shame euen to name those thinges, whiche are done of them in secrete: but all thynges when they are brought furth by the light are manifest.
For whatsoeuer is manifeste, thesame is lyghte: wherefore he sayeth: awake thou that slepest, and stande vp from death, and Christ shall geue thee light.
And when he had cast out the deuill, the dumme spake, and the people woondered.
But some of them sayde: he casteth out deuils through Beelzebub the chiefe of the deuils.
And other tempted hym, and required of hym a sygne from heauen.
But he knowyng theyr thoughtes, sayd vnto them: Euerye kyngdome deuyded agaynste it selfe, is desolate: and one house doeth fall vpon another.
If Sathan also bee deuyded agaynste hymselfe, howe shall hys kyngdome endure? Because ye saye that caste out deuilles throughe Beelzebub.
If by the helpe of Beelzebub cast out deuils, by whose helpe doe your chyldren caste them oute? Therefore shall they bee youre iudges.
But if with the fynger of God cast out deuilles, no doubt the kyngdome of God is come vpon you.
When a strong manne armed watcheth hys house, the thynges that he possesseth are in peace.
But when a stro~ger then he commeth vpon him, ouercummeth him, he taketh from him al hys harnes (wherein he trusted) and deuydeth his goodes.
Whe~ the vncleane spirite is gone out of a man, he walketh through drye places, seeking reste.
And when he fyndeth none, he sayth: wil returne agayne into my house whence came out.
And whe~ he cometh, he findeth it swept and garnished.
Then goeth he and taketh to him .vii. other spirites worse then himself: and they enter in dwel there.
And the end of that man is worse then the beginning.
And it fortuned that as he spake these thinges, a certayne woma~ of the cumpany lift vp her voyce, and said vnto him: happy is the woumbe that bare thee, the pappes which gaue thee sucke.
But he sayd: yea, happie are they that heare the woorde of God, and kepe it.
GOd is our hope and strengthe: a very presente helpe in trouble.
Therfore will not we feare, though the earthe be moued: and thoughe the hylles bee caryed into the middest of the sea.
Though the waters therof rage and swell: and though the mountaynes shake at the tempest of the same.
The riuers of the floude thereof shall make gladde the citie of God: the holye place of the tabernacle of the moste highest.
God is in the middeste of her, therefore shall she not bee remoued: God shall helpe her, and that right early.
The heathen make muche a dooe, and the kyngdomes are moued: but God hath shewed hys voyce, and the earth shall mealte away.
The Lorde of hoostes is with vs: the God of Iacob is our refuge.
come hyther, and beholde the woorkes of the Lorde: what destruccion he hath brought vpon the earth.
He maketh warres to ceasse in all the worlde: he breaketh the bowe, and knappeth the speare in sunder, and burneth the Chariotes in the fyer.
Be still then, and knowe that am God: wilbe exalted among the Heathen, and wilbe exalted in the yearth.
The Lorde of hoostes is with vs, the God of Iacob is our defence.
GRaunt we beseche thee almightie God, that we, which for our euill dedes are worthely punyshed: by the comforte of thy grace may mercifully be relieued, through oure Lorde Iesus Christe.
TEll me (ye that desyre to be vnder the lawe) doe ye not heare of the lawe? for it is written that Abraham had .ii. sonnes, the one by a bondemayde, the other by a freewoman.
Yea, and he which was borne of the bondewoman, was borne after the fleshe: but he whiche was borne of the freewoman, was borne by promes: which thinges are spoken by an allegory.
For these are two testamentes, the one from the mount Sina, which gendreth vnto bondage, whiche is Agar: For mount Sina is Agar in Arabia, and bordreth vpon the citie, whiche is nowe called Ierusalem, and is in bondage with her chyldren.
But Ierusalem, whiche is aboue, is free, whiche is the mother of vs all.
For it is written: Reioyce thou barren that beareste no children: breake furth and crye, thou that trauaylest not.
For the desolate hath many moe children then she whiche hath an housbande.
But as then he that was borne after the fleshe, persecuted him that was borne after the spirite: Eue~ so is it nowe.
Neuerthelesse, what sayeth the scripture? put awaye the bonde woman and her sonne.
For the sonne of the bondewoman shall not be heyre with the sonne of the freewoman: So then brethren, we are not chyldren of the bondewoman, but of the freewoman.
IE&sus departed ouer the sea of Galile, which is the sea of Tiberias, and a greate multytude folowed hym, because they sawe hys myracles whiche he dyd on them that were dyseased.
And Iesus wente vp into a mountayne, and there he sate with hys Disciples.
When Iesus then lift vp hys eyes and sawe a great company come vnto hym, he sayeth vnto Philip: whence shall we bye breade that these may eate? This he sayd to proue him: for he himselfe knewe what he woulde dooe.
Philip aunswered him: two hundreth peniwoorth of breade, are not sufficyente for them, that euery manne may take a litle.
One of hys disciples (Andrewe, Simon Peters brother) sayeth vnto hym: There is a lad here which hath fiue barley loaues and two fyshes: but what are they among so manye? And Iesus sayd: make the people sit downe.
There was muche grasse in the place: so the menne sate downe, in number about fiue thousande.
And Iesus toke the bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he gaue to the Disciples, and the Disciples to them that were set downe: lykewise of the fishes asmuch as they would.
When they had eaten inough, he sayd vnto his Disciples: gather vp the broken meate whiche remayneth, that nothyng be loste.
And they gathered it together and fylled .xii. baskettes with the broken meate of the fyue barley loaues: which broken meate remained vnto the~ that had eaten.
Then those menne (when they had seene the miracle that Iesus did) sayd: thys is of a trueth the same Prophete that shoulde come into the worlde.
SAue me (O God) for thy names sake: and auenge me in thy strength.
Heare my prayer (O God:) and harken vnto the woordes of my mouth.
For straungers are risen vp agaynst me: and Tirauntes (which haue not god before theyr eyes) seke after my soule.
Beholde, God is my helper: the Lord is with them that vpholde my soule.
He shall rewarde euill vnto myne enemies: destroye thou them in thy trueth.
An offeryng of a free hearte will geue thee, and prayse thy name (O Lorde:) because it is so coumfortable.
For he hath deliuered me oute of all my trouble: and myne eye hath seene his desyre vpon myne enemies.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
WE beseche thee almightie God, mercifullye to looke vpon thy people: that by thy great goodnesse, they may be gouerned and preserued euermore bothe in bodye and soule: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
CHri&ste beyng an hye priest of good thynges to come, came by a greater and a more perfecte tabernacle, not made with handes, that is to saye, not of thys buildyng, neither by the bloud of goates and calues, but by hys owne bloude he entred in once into the holy place, and founde eternall redempcion.
For if the bloud of oxen and of goates, and the ashes of a young kowe, when it was sprinkled, purifyeth the vncleane as touchyng the purifying of the fleshe: howe much more shall the bloud of Christ (which through the eternall spirite, offered hymselfe without spot to god) purge your conscience from dead workes, for to serue the liuing god? And for thys cause is he the mediator of the new testament: that through death, which chaunsed for the redempcion of those trangressio~s that were vnder the first testament, they which are called, might receiue the promes of eternall inheritaunce.
WHyche of you can rebuke me of synne? If saye the truethe, why do ye not beleue me? He that is of God heareth Goddes wordes: ye therfore heare them not, because ye are not of God.
Then aunswered the Iewes, and sayde vnto him: saye wee not well that thou art a Samaritan and hast the deuyll? Iesus answered: haue not the deuil, but honoure my father, and ye haue dishonored me.
seeke not myne owne praise: there is one that seeketh and iudgeth.
Verely, verely, saye vnto you: if a manne keepe my saying, he shall neuer see deathe.
Then said the Iewes vnto him: now knowe we that thou haste the deuill.
Abraham is dead, and the Prophetes, and thou sayest: If a man kepe my saying, he shal neuer taste of death.
Art thou greater then our father Abraham, whiche is dead? And the Prophetes are dead: whome makest thou thy selfe? Iesus aunswered: if honor my selfe, myne honor is nothyng: It is my father that honoreth me, which ye say is your God, and yet ye haue not knowen him: but know him: And if say knowe him not, shalbe a lyer, like vn+to you.
Your father Abraham was glad to see my day: and he saw it and reioysed.
Thou art not yet .l. yere olde, and haste thou seen Abraham? Iesus sayde vnto them: Verely, verely, saye vnto you: ere Abraham was borne, am.
Then tooke they vp stones to cast at hym: but Iesus hid hymselfe, and went out of the temple.
From the endes of the earth will call vnto thee: when my heart is in heauines.
Oh set me vp vpon the rocke that is hygher then I: for thou haste bene my hope, and a strong tower for me agaynst the enemie.
wil dwell in thy tabernacle for euer: and my trust shal be vnder the coueryng of thy wynges.
For thou, Lorde, hast heard my desyres: and hast geuen an herytage vnto those that feare thy name.
Thou shalt graunt the kyng a long lyfe: that hys yeares may endure throughout all generacions.
He shal dwell before God for euer: prepare thy louing mercy and faythfulnes, that they maye preserue hym.
So wyl alway sing prayse vnto thy name: that maie dayly performe my vowes.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy ghoste.
As it was in the begynning, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
ALmyghtye and euerlastyng God, whiche of thy tendre loue towarde man, hast sent our sauiour Iesus Christe to take vpon hym oure fleshe, and to suffer death vpon the crosse, that all mankynde shoulde folowe the example of his great humilitie: mercyfully graunt, that we both folowe the example of his pacience, and be made partakers of hys resurreccion: through the same Iesus Christe oure Lorde.
LEtte the same mynde bee in you, that was also in Christe Iesu: whyche when he was in the shape of God, thought it no robbery to be equal with god: neuerthelesse he made himselfe of no reputacio~, taking on hym the shape of a seruaunte, became lyke vnto men, and was founde in his apparell as a man.
He humbled himselfe, and became obedie~t vnto the death, euen the death of the crosse.
Wherfore, God hath also exalted hym on hygh, and geuen hym a name which is aboue all names: that in the name of Iesus, euery knee shoulde bowe, both of thinges in heauen, and thynges in yearth, and thynges vnder the yearth, and that all tonges shoulde confesse, that Iesus Christe is the Lorde, vnto the prayse of God the father.
ANd it came to passe, when Iesus had fynyshed all these sayinges, he said vnto his disciples: ye know that after two dayes shall be Easter, and the sonne of man shalbe deliuered ouer to be crucified.
Then assembled together the chiefe Priestes, the Scrybes, and the Elders of the people, vnto the palace of the hygh priest (which was called Caiphas) and held a counsell that they might take Iesus by subteltie, kil him.
But they said: not on the holy daye, lest there be an vproare among the people.
When Iesus was in Bethanie in the house of Symon the Leper, there came vnto hym a woman hauing an Alabaster boxe of precious ointment, and powred it on hys head, as he sate at the bourde.
But when his disciples sawe it, they had indignacion, saying: wherto serueth this waste? Thys oyntment myght haue been well solde, and geuen to the poore.
When Iesus vnderstode that, he said vnto them: why trouble ye the woman? for she hath wroughte a good worke vpon me.
For ye haue the poore alwayes with you: but me shall ye not haue alwayes.
And in that she hath cast thys oyntment on my body, she did it to bury me.
Verely say vnto you: whersoeuer this gospell shalbe preached in al the worlde, there shall also this that she hath done, be tolde for a memorial of her.
Then one of the .xii. (which was called Iudas Iscarioth) went vnto the chiefe priestes, and said vnto the~: what wil ye geue me, and wyl delyuer him vnto you? And they appoynted vnto hym .xxx. pieces of syluer.
And from that tyme furth, he sought oportunitie to betray hym: The first day of swete bread, the disciples came to Iesus, saying vnto hym: where wylt thou that we prepare for thee, to eate the Passeouer.
And he sayde: Goe into the citie to suche a man, and saye vnto hym, the Maister sayeth: my time is at hand, will kepe my Easter by thee with my disciples.
And the disciples did as Iesus had appointed them, and they made ready the Passeouer.
When the euen was come, he sate doune with the .xii.
And as they did eate he said: Verely say vnto you, that one of you shal betray me.
And they were exceading sorowful, and began euery one of them to say vnto him: Lorde, is it I? He answered and said: he that dippeth hys hande with me in the dyshe, the same shal betray me.
The so~ne of man truely goeth, as it is written of hym: but woe vnto that man, by whome the sonne of man is betrayed.
It had bene good for that man, yf he had not bene borne.
Maister, is it I? He sayd vnto him: thou hast sayd.
When they were eatyng, Iesus tooke bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he brake it and gaue it to the discyples, and sayde: Take, eate, thys is my bodye.
And he toke the cup, and thanked, and gaue it them, saying: drynke ye all of thys: For thys is my bloude (whych is of the newe testame~t) that is shed for many, for the remission of synnes.
But saye vnto you: wyl not drynke hencefoorth of this fruite of the vyne tree, vntyll that day when shall drinke it newe with you, in my fathers kingdome.
And when they had said grace, they went out vnto mount Oliuete.
Then saith Iesus vnto them: al ye shall be offended because of me thys night.
For it is written: will smite the shepehearde, and the shepe of the flocke shalbe scatered abroade: but after am risen againe, wil goe before you into Galile.
Peter aunswered, and sayd vnto him: though all men be offended because of thee, yet wyll not be offended.
Iesus sayde vnto hym: verely saye vnto thee, that in this same nighte before the cocke krowe, thou shalt denye me thryse.
Peter sayde vnto him: yea, though should dye with thee, yet wil not denye thee, lykewise also sayd all the disciples.
Then came Iesus with them vnto a farme place, (whyche is called Gethsemane) and sayde vnto the disciples: Sit ye here, whyle goe and praye yonder.
And he toke with hym Peter and the twoo sonnes of Zebede, and began to waxe sorowful and heauie.
Then sayd Iesus vnto them: My soule is heauie euen vnto the death: Tarye ye here and watche with me.
And he went a litle farther and fel flat on his face and prayed, saying: my father, if it be possible, let this cup passe from me: neuerthelesse, not as wil but as thou wilt: And he came vnto the dyscyples, and founde them aslepe, and sayde vnto Peter: what, coulde ye not watche with me one houre? watche and praye, that ye enter not into temptacion: the spirite is willing but the flesh is weake.
my father, if this cup may not passe away from me except drincke of it, thy wil be fulfilled: and he came and found them aslepe againe: for theyr eyes were heauie.
And he left them, and went agayne and prayed the thirde tyme, saying the same wordes.
Then commeth he to his dyscyples, and sayeth vnto them: Slepe on nowe and take your reste.
Behold, the houre is at hande, and the sonne of man is betrayed into the handes of synners.
Ryse, let vs be going: behold, he is at hand that dothe betray me.
Whyle he yet spake: loe, Iudas one of the number of the .xii. came, and with hym a greate multitude with sweordes staues, sent from the chiefe priestes and elders of the people.
But he that betrayed hym, gaue them atoken, saying: whomsoeuer kysse, thesame is he, holde him fast.
And furthwith he came to Iesus, and sayd: haile Maister, and kyssed him.
And Iesus sayd vnto him: frende, wherfore art thou come? Then came they and layd handes on Iesus, toke hym.
And behold, one of them which were with Iesus, stretched out his hande and drewe his sweorde, and stroke a seruaunte of the hye priest, smote of hys eare.
Then sayde Iesus vnto hym: put vp thy sweorde into the sheath, for al they that take the sweord, shal perish with the sweord.
Thynkest thou that cannot nowe pray to my father, he shall geue me, euen nowe, more then .xii. legions of Angels? But how then shal the scriptures be fulfylled? For thus muste it be.
In that same houre sayd Iesus to the multitude: Ye be come out as it were to a thefe with sweordes and staues, for to take me.
But all this is doone that the scriptures of the prophetes myght be fulfilled.
And they toke Iesus and led hym to Cayphas the hye priest, where the Scribes and the Elders were assembled.
But Peter folowed hym a farre of vnto the hye priestes palace: and went in, and sate with the seruauntes to see the end.
The chiefe priestes the elders al the counsel, sought false witnes against Iesus (for to put him to death) but found none: yea, when many false witnesses came, yet found they none.
At the last came .ii. false witnesses, sayde: This felowe sayde: am able to destroye the temple of God, and to build it agayne in .iii. dayes.
And the chiefe prist arose, said vnto him: answerest thou nothing? Why doe these beare witnes against thee? But Iesus helde his peace.
charge thee by the liuing God, that thou tell vs, whether thou be Christ the sonne of God.
Neuerthelesse saye vnto you: hereafter shall ye see the so~ne of man sitting on the right hande of power, and cummyng in the cloudes of the skie.
Then the hye priest re~t his clothes, saying: he hath spoken blasphemie, what nede we of any moe witnesses? Beholde, now ye haue heard hys blasphemie: what thynke ye? they aunswered and sayde: he is worthy to dye.
Then did they spit in hys face, buffeted him with fistes.
And other smote hym on the face with the palme of their handes, saying: tel vs thou Christ, who is he that smote thee? Peter sate without in the palace, and a damosell came to hym, saying: thou also waste with Iesus of Galilee: but he denied before the~ al, saying: wot not what thou saiest.
When he was gone out into the porche, another we~che saw hym, said vnto them that were there: This felow was also with Iesus of Nazareth.
And again he denied with an othe, saying: doe not knowe the man.
And after a while came vnto him they that stode by, and sayd vnto Peter: suerly thou art euen one of them, for thy speche bewrayeth thee.
Then began he to curse and to sweare, that he knewe not the man.
And Peter remembred the woorde of Iesu, which sayd vnto hym: before the cocke krowe, thou shalt denye me thrise: and he we~t out and wept bitterly.
When the mornyng was come, all the chiefe Priestes, and the Elders of the people held a counsel against Iesus, to put him to death, brought him bound and delyuered hym vnto Poncius Pilate the deputie.
Then Iudas (which had betrayed hym) seeing that he was condemned, repented himselfe, and brought againe the .xxx. plates of siluer to the chiefe priestes and elders, saying: haue sinned, betraying the innocente bloud.
And they sayde: what is that to vs? See thou to that: And he cast downe the siluer plates in the temple, and departed, went and hanged hymselfe.
And the chiefe priestes toke the syluer plates, and sayde: It is not lawfull for to put them into the treasure, because it is the price of bloude.
And they tooke counsel, bought with them a potters fielde to burye strangers in.
Wherfore the fielde is called Haceldama, that is, the fielde of bloud, vntil this daye.
Then was fulfilled that whiche was spoken by Ieremie the Prophete, saying: and they toke .xxx. syluer plates, the pryce of hym that was valued whome they bought of the children of Israel, and gaue them for the potters fielde, as the Lorde appointed me.
Iesus stode before the deputie, and the deputie asked hym, saying: Art thou the kyng of the Iewes? Iesus said vnto him: thou saiest: And when he was accused of the chiefe priestes and elders, he aunswered nothyng.
Then said Pilate vnto him: hearest thou not how many witnesses they lay against thee? And he aunswered hym to neuer a worde: insomuche that the deputie marueiled greatly.
At that feast, the deputie was wont to deliuer vnto the people a prisoner, whome they woulde desyre.
Therfore, when they were gathered together, Pilate said: whether wil ye that geue loce vnto you, Barrabas, or Iesus which is called Christ? For he knewe that for enuy they had deliuered him.
When he was set down to geue iudgeme~t, his wife se~t vnto him, saying: haue thou nothyng to doe with that iust man: For haue suffered many thinges this day in my slepe, because of hym.
But the chiefe priestes and elders perswaded the people that they shoulde aske Barrabas, destroye Iesus.
The deputie answered said vnto them: whether of the twaine wil ye that let loce vnto you? They sayde: Barrabas.
Pylate sayd vnto them: what shall doe then with Iesus, whyche is called Christ? They all sayd vnto him: let hym be crucifyed.
The deputie sayd: what euill hath he done? But they cryed the more, saying: let hym be crucifyed.
When Pylate sawe that he coulde preuayle nothing, but that more busines was made, he toke water washed hys handes before the people, saying: am innocent of the bloude of this iust persone, ye shal see.
Then answered al the people saide: hys bloud be on vs on our children.
Then let he Barrabas loce vnto them, scourged Iesus, deliuered hym to be crucifyed.
Then the souldiers of the deputie toke Iesus into the common hall, gathered vnto him al the company: they stripped him, put on him a purple robe, platted a croune of thornes, and put it vpon his head, a reede in his righte hande, bowed the knee before hym, mocked hym, saying: hayle kyng of the Iewes: whe~ they had spit vpo~ him, they toke the reede smote him on the head.
And after that they had mocked him, they toke the robe of him agayn, put his owne raiment on him, led him away to crucifye him.
And as they came out, they fou~d a manne of Cirene (named Simon) hym they compelled to beare hys crosse.
And they came vnto the place whyche is called Golgotha, (that is to say, a place of dead mens sculs) gaue him vineger to drincke mingled with gal.
And when he had tasted therof he wolde not drynke.
When they had crucified hym, they parted his garmentes, did cast lottes: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet: They parted my garmentes among them, vpon my vesture did thei cast lottes.
And they sate watched him there, set vp ouer his head the cause of his death written: This is Iesus the kyng of the Iewes.
Then were there .ii. theues crucified with him, one on the ryght hande, and an other on the left.
They that passed by, reuyled hym, waggyng theyr heades, saying: thou that destroyedst the temple of God, didst build it in thre daies, saue thy selfe.
If thou be the so~ne of God, come downe from the crosse.
Lykewise also the high Priestes mocking him, with the Scrybes elders, sayde: he saued other, himselfe he cannot saue.
If he be the kyng of Israell let him now come down fro~ the crosse, we will beleue hym.
He trusted in God, let him deliuer him nowe, if he will haue him, for he said: am the sonne of god.
The theues also which were crucified with him, cast the same in his teeth.
From the sixt houre was there darckenes ouer all the land, vntyl the ninth houre.
And about ye ninth houre, Iesus cryed with a loud voice, saying: Ely, Ely, lamasabathany? that is to say: my god, my god, why hast thou forsake~ me? Some of them that stode there, when they heard that, sayd: This man calleth for Helias.
And streight way one of them ran toke a spounge, when he had filled it ful of vineger, he put it on a reede, gaue him to drinke.
Other sayd: let be, let vs see whether Helias wil come deliuer hym.
Iesus, when he had cryed agayne with a loude voyce, yelded vp the ghoste.
And beholde, the vayle of the temple dyd rente into two partes, fro~ the top to the botome, and the yearth did quake, and the stones rent, and graues did open, and many bodies of sainctes, whiche slept, arose and wente out of the graues after hys resurreccion, and came into the holy cytie and appeared vnto manye.
When the Centurion, and they that were with him watching Iesus, sawe the yearthquake, and those thinges which happened, they feared greatly, saying: Truely, this was the sonne of God.
And manye weomen were there (beholding him a farre of) which folowed Iesus from Galilee, minystryng vnto him: Emong whiche was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Iames and Ioses, and the mother of Zebedes children.
WHat is he this that commeth from Edom, with red colored clothes of Bosra: (whyche is so costly cloth) cummeth in so myghtely with all hys strength? am he that teacheth righteousnesse, am of power to helpe.
Wherfore then is thy clothyng red, and thy rayment lyke hys that treadeth in the wyne presse? haue troden the presse my selfe alone, of all people there is not one with me.
Thus wyll treade downe myne enemies in my wrath, and set my feete vpon them in myne indignacion.
And theyr bloud shall bespryng my clothes, and so wil stayne al my rayment.
For the daye of vengeaunce is assigned in my heart, and the yeare when my people shal be delyuered is come.
looked about me, and there was no man to shewe me any helpe.
Then helde me by myne owne arme, and my feruentnesse sustayned me.
And thus wyll treade downe the people in my wrath, and bathe them in my displeasure, and vpon the yearth wil lay theyr strength.
wyl declare the goodnes of the Lord, yea and the praise of the Lorde for al that he hath geuen vs, for the great good that he hath done for Israel: which he hath geuen them of hys owne fauor, according to the multitude of his louing kindnesses.
For he sayde: these no doubt are my people, and no shrynking children, so he was theyr sauiour.
In theyr troubles, he was also troubled with them: and the Aungell that went furth from his presence, deliuered them.
Of very loue and kyndenes that he had vnto them, he redemed them.
He hath borne them and caried them vp, euer sence the worlde began: But after they prouoked him to wrath vexed his holy mynde, he was their enemy fought against them himselfe.
Yet reme~bred Israel the olde time of Moses his people, saying: where is he that broughte them from the water of the sea, with them that fed hys shepe? where is he that hath geuen his holy spirite among them? he led them by the ryghthand of Moses, with hys gloryous arme: deuiding the water before them (wherby he gate hym selfe an euerlastyng name) he led them in the depe, as an horse is led in the playn, that they should not stomble, as a tame beast goeth in the fielde: and the breath geuen of God, geueth hym reste.
Thus (O God) hast thou led thy people, to make thy selfe a gloryous name withall.
Looke down then from heauen, and beholde the dwellyng place of thy sanctuary, thy glory.
How is it that thy gelousy, thy strength, the multitude of thy mercies and thy louing kindnes, wil not be intreated of vs? yet art thou our father.
For Abraham knoweth vs not, neither is Israell acquaynted with vs: But thou Lord, art oure father and redemer, and thy name is euerlastyng.
Lorde, wherfore hast thou led vs out of thy way? wherfore hast thou hardened our heartes, that we feare thee not? Be at one with vs agayne for thy seruauntes sake, and for the generacion of thyne herytage.
Thy people haue had but alitle of thy Sanctuary in possession, for oure enemies haue troden downe the holy place.
And we were thyne from the begynning, when thou wast not theyr Lorde, for they haue not called vpon thy name.
AFter two dayes was Easter, and the dayes of swete bread.
And the hye priestes and the Scribes sought how they myght take hym by crafte, and put him to death.
But they sayd: not in the feast day, lest any busines arise among the people.
And whe~ he was at Bethanie in the house of Simon the leper, euen as he sate at meate, there came a woman hauyng an Alabaster boxe of oyntmente, called Narde, that was pure and costlye: and she brake the boxe and powred it on hys heade.
And there were some that were not contente within themselues, and sayde: what neded this waste of oyntmente? for it myghte haue bene solde for more then .ccc. pence, and haue bene geuen vnto the poore.
And Iesus sayde: let her alone, why trouble ye her? She hath done a good worke on me: for ye haue poore with you alwaies, whensoeuer ye wyll, ye maye do them good: but me haue ye not alwaies.
She hath done that she could, she came afore hande to anointe my bodye to the burying.
Verely saye vnto you: whersoeuer thys Gospell shal be preached throughout the whole worlde, thys also that she hath doone, shalbe rehearsed in remembraunce of her.
And Iudas Iscaryoth, one of the .xii. wente awaye vnto the hye Priestes to betraye hym vnto them.
When they heard that, they were glad, promised that they would geue hym money.
And the first day of swete bread (when they offered Passeouer) hys disciples sayd vnto hym: where wilt thou that we go and prepare that thou mayste eate the passeouer? And he sente foorthe two of hys disciples, and sayde vnto them: goe ye vnto the citie, and there shal mete you a man bearing a pitcher of water, folowe hym.
And whithersoeuer he goeth in, say ye vnto the goodmanne of the house, the maister saith: where is the geast chamber, where shall eate Passeouer with my disciples? And he wil shewe you a great parlor paued prepared: there make ready for vs.
And his dysciples went furth, and came into the citie, found as he had sayde vnto them: and they made ready the Passeouer.
And when it was nowe euentide, he came with the xii.
And as they sate at borde and did eate, Iesus saide: verely say vnto you, one of you (that eateth with me) shall betray me.
And they began to be sory, to saye to hym one by one: is it I? an other sayd: is it I? he aunswered sayd vnto them: it is one of the .xii. eue~ he that dippeth with me in the platter.
The sonne of man truely goeth as it is written of hym, but woe to that man by whome the sonne of man is betrayed: Good were it for that man, if he had neuer bene borne.
And as they did eate, Iesus toke bread, when he had geuen thankes he brake it, and gaue to them, and sayd: Take, eate, thys is my body.
And he toke the cup, and when he had geuen thankes, he toke it to them, and they all dranke of it.
And he said vnto the~: This is my bloud of the newe testamente, whyche is shed for many.
Verely saye vnto you: wil drynke no more of the fruite of the vine, vntyll that day that drynke it newe in the kyngdome of God.
And when they had sayde grace, they wente oute to mounte Olyuete.
And Iesus sayeth vnto them: al ye shalbe offended because of me, thys nighte.
For it is written: will smite the shepeheard the shepe shalbe scatered: but after that am risen again, wil go into Galile before you.
Peter said vnto him: though al men be offe~ded, yet wil not I.
And Iesus saith vnto him: verely, say vnto thee, that this day, euen in this night before ye cocke krow twise, thou shalt deny me thre times.
But he spake more veheme~tly: no, if should die with thee, wyl not denye thee.
And they came into a place which was named Gethsemany, and he sayde to hys discyples: sit ye here whyle goe asyde and praye.
And he taketh with hym Peter, and Iames, Iohn, and began to waxe abashed and to be man agony, and said vnto them.
My soule is heauy, euen vnto the death: tary ye here and watche.
And he went foorth a litle and fell down flat on the grounde, and prayed, that if it were possible, the houre might passe from hym.
And he sayde: Abba father, al thinges are possible vnto thee, take away this cup fro~ me: neuerthelesse, not that wil, but that thou wilte bee doone.
And he came and founde them sleping, and sayth to Peter: Simon, slepest thou? Couldest not thou watche one houre? watche ye and pray, lest ye enter into temptacion: the spirite truely is ready, but the fleshe is weake.
And agayn he went asyde and prayed, and spake thesame wordes.
And he returned and founde them aslepe agayne, for theyr eyes were heauie, neither wiste they what to aunswere hym.
And he came the thirde tyme and sayd vnto them: slepe hencefurth and take your ease, it is inough.
The houre is come: behold, the sonne of manne is betrayed into the handes of synners: Rise vp, let vs go: Loe, he that betrayeth me is at ha~d.
And immediatly whyle he yet spake, commeth Iudas (whyche was one of the .xii.) and with hym a greate nomber of people with sweordes and staues, from the hye Priestes, and Scribes, and Elders.
And he that betrayed hym, had geuen them a generall token, saying: whosoeuer do kysse, the same is he: take hym, and leade him awaye warely.
And assoone as he was come, he goeth strayghte waye to him, and saieth vnto him: Maister, Maister, and kissed him: and they laied theyr handes on him, and toke hym.
And one of them that stode by drewe out a sweorde, and smote a seruaunte of the hye Prieste, and cutte of hys eare.
And Iesus aunswered, and sayd vnto them: ye be come out as vnto a thefe with sweordes and staues, for to take me: was dayelye with you in the temple teachyng, and ye tooke me not: but these thynges come to passe that the Scryptures shoulde bee fulfylled.
And there folowed hym a certayne young manne clothed in linnen vpon the bare, and the young menne caught hym, and he left hys linnen garment and fled from them naked.
And they led Iesus awaye to the hyghest Priest of all, and with him came all the hye priestes, and the Elders, and the Scribes.
And Peter folowed hym a great waye of (euen til he was come into the palace of the hye Priest) and he sate with the seruauntes, and warmed hymselfe at the fyre.
And the hye Priestes and all the counsell soughte for wytnesse agaynst Iesu, to put hym to death, and found none: for many bare false witnes agaynst hym, but theyr witnesses agreed not together.
And there arose certayne and broughte false witnesse against him, saying: we heard him saye: will destroy this temple that is made with handes, and within .iii dayes wyll builde an other made without handes.
And the hye priest stode vp among them, and asked Iesus, saying: answereste thou nothing? Howe is it that these beare witnesse agaynst thee? But he helde hys peace, and aunswered nothyng.
Agayne the hye priest asked hym, and sayde vnto him: arte thou Christ the sonne of the blessed? And Iesus sayd: am.
And ye shall see the sonne of man sitting on the ryght hand of power, and cumming in the cloudes of heauen.
Then the hye prieste rente hys clothes, and sayde: what nede we any further of witnesses? ye haue heard blasphemy, what think ye? And they all condemned hym to be worthye of death.
And some began to spytte at hym, and to couer his face, and to beate hym with fistes, to say vnto hym: Areade, and the seruauntes buffeted hym on the face.
And as Peter was beneth in the palace, there came one of the we~ches of the hiest priest, and when she saw Peter warming himselfe, she loked on him, and sayde: wast not thou also with Iesus of Nazareth? And he denied, saying: knowe him not, neither wote what thou sayeste.
And he went out into the porche, and the cocke krewe.
And a damosell (when she saw him) began again to say to them that stoode by: this is one of the~.
And anone after they that stoode by, sayd agayne vnto Peter: suerlye thou arte one of them, for thou art of Galyle, thy speache agreeth therto.
But he began to curse and to sweare, saying: knowe not thys man of whome ye speake.
And againe the Cocke krewe: and Peter remembred the worde that Iesus had sayde vnto hym: before the cocke crow twise, thou shalt denie me thre times.
THe lorde God hath opened mine eare, therfore can not say nay, neither withdrawe my selfe: but offer my backe vnto the smiters, and my chekes to the nippers.
turne not my face from shame and spittyng, and the lorde god shal helpe me: Therfore shal not be confounded.
haue hardened my face like a flint stone, for am sure that shall not come to confusion.
He is at hand that iustifieth me, who wyl then goe to lawe with me? Let vs stande one agaynst another: if there be any that wyll reason with me, let hym come here foorth vnto me.
Beholde, the Lorde God standeth by me, what is he then that can condemne me? loe, they shall be all lyke as an olde cloth, the moth shall eate them vp. Therfore, whoso feareth the Lorde amonge you, let hym heare the voyce of his seruaunt.
Whoso walketh in darckenes, and no lighte shineth vpon him, let hym put his trust in the name of the Lorde, and holde him by his God: but take hede, ye al kindle a fyre of the wrath of God, and steare vp the coales: walke on in the glystryng of your owne fyer, and in the coales that ye haue kyndled.
Thys commeth vnto you from my hande, namely that ye shall slepe in sorowe.
ANd anone in the dawning, the hye priestes held a counsel with the Elders and the Scribes, and the whole congregacion, and bounde Iesus, and led him away, and deliuered him to Pilate.
And Pylate asked hym: art thou the kyng of the Iewes? and he answered sayd vnto him: thou sayest it.
So Pylate asked hym agayne, saying: aunswereste thou nothyng? Beholde howe manye thynges they laye vnto thy charge.
At that feast Pylate did deliuer vnto them a priesoner, whomsoeuer they would desyre.
And there was one that was named Barrabas, which lay bounde with them that made insurreccion: he had committed murther.
And the people called vnto hym, and began to desyre hym, that he would doe accordyng as he had euer done vnto them.
Pylate aunswered them, saying: will ye that let looce vnto you the kyng of the Iewes? For he knewe that the hye priestes had delyuered hym of enuie.
But the hye priestes moued the people, that he should rather delyuer Barrabas vnto them.
Pilate answered agayne, and sayd vnto them: what wyll ye that then doe vnto him, whome ye call the king of the Iewes? And they cried againe, crucifye him.
Pilate said vnto them: what euil hath he done? And they cried the more feruently, crucifye him.
And so Pylate wylling to content the people, lette looce Barrabas vnto them, and delyuered vp Iesus (whe~ he had scourged him) for to be crucified.
And the souldiours led hym awaie into the common hall, and called together the whole multitude, they clothed him with purple, and they platted a croune of thornes and crouned hym withall, and began to salute him: Hayle king of the Iewes.
And they smote him on the head with a reede, and dyd spit vpon hym, and bowed theyr knees and wurshypped hym.
And when they had mocked hym, they toke the purple of him, and put hys owne clothes on hym, and led hym out to crucifye hym.
And they compelled one that passed by called Symon of Cirene (the father of Alexander and Rufus) whych came out of the fielde, to beare hys crosse.
And they brought hym to a place named Golgotha (which, if a man interprete it, is the place of dead mennes sculles) and they gaue him to drinke, wine mingled with mirrhe, but he receiued it not.
And when they had crucifyed hym, they parted hys garmentes, castyng lottes vpon them what euery man shoulde take.
And it was about the thirde houre, and they crucifyed him.
And the title of his cause was written: The kyng of the Iewes.
And they crucyfyed with hym two theues: the one on hys ryghte hand, and the other on hys left.
And the scripture was fulfilled, whiche saieth: he was counted among the wicked.
And they that wente by, railed on him, wagging their heades, and saying: wretch, thou that destroyest the temple and buildest it agayne in three dayes: saue thy selfe and come downe fro~ the crosse.
Lykewyse also mocked him the hye priestes among them selues with the Scribes, and sayed: he saued other men, himselfe he cannot saue.
Let Christ the king of Israell descend now from the crosse, that we may see and beleue.
And they that were crucified with him, checked him also.
And when the sixt houre was come, darkenes arose ouer all the earth, vntill the ninth houre.
And at the ninth houre Iesus cryed with a loude voyce, saying: Eloy, Eloy, lamasabathany? whiche is (if one interprete it) my God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? And some of them that stoode by, when they heard that, sayed: beholde, he calleth for Helias.
And one ranne fylled a sponge full of vineger, and put it on a reede, gaue hym to drincke, saying: let hym alone, let vs see whether Helias will come and take hym downe.
But Iesus cryed with a loude voice, and gaue vp the gost.
And the vayle of the temple rente in .ii. peces, from the top to the bottom.
And when the Centurion (which stode before him) sawe that he so cryed, and gaue vp the gost, he sayde: truely this man was the sonne of God.
There were also women a good waye of, beholdyng hym: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Iames the litle, and of Ioses, Mary Salome (whiche also when he was in Galile had folowed hym, and ministred vnto hym) and many other women, whiche came vp with hym to Ierusale~.
And nowe when the euen was come (because it was the day of preparyng that goeth before the Sabboth) Ioseph of the citie of Aramathia, a noble counsaylour, whiche also loked for the kingdome of God, came and went in boldely vnto Pilate, and begged of him the body of Iesu.
And Pilate merueiled that he was already dead, and called vnto hym the Centurion, and asked of hym, whether he had been any while dead.
And when he knewe the trueth of the Centurion, he gaue the body to Ioseph.
And he bought a linnen clothe, and toke hym downe, and wrapped him in the linnen clothe, and layed him in a sepulchre that was hewen out of a rocke, and rolled a stone before the doore of the sepulchre.
And Mary Magdalene, and Mary Ioses behelde where he was layde.
WHere as is a testame~t, there must also (of necessitie) be the death of him that maketh the testame~t.
For the testament taketh authoritie when men are dead: for it is yet of no value, as lo~g as he that maketh the testame~t is a liue, for which cause also, neyther the first testament was ordayned without bloud.
For when Moses had declared all the commau~demente to all the people, accordyng to the lawe, he tooke the bloud of calues, and of Goates, with water and purple wolle, and ysope, and sprinckled both the booke all the people, saying: this is the bloud of the testamente, whiche God hath appointed vnto you.
Moreouer he sprinkled the tabernacle with bloud also, and all the ministring vessels.
And almost al thinges are by the lawe, purged with bloud, and without sheding of bloud is no remission.
It is nede then, that the similitudes of heauenly thinges be purified with suche thinges: but that the heauenly thinges themselfes, be purified with better sacrifices then are those.
For Christe is not entred into the holy places that are made with handes (whiche are similitudes of true thinges) but is entred into very heauen, for to appeare nowe in the sight of God for vs: not to offer himselfe often, as the hye priest entreth into the holy place euery yere with strau~ge bloud: for then must he haue often suffred sence the worlde began.
But nowe in the end the of the world hath he appeared once, to put sinne to flight by the offering vp of himself.
And as it is appointed vnto all men that they shall once dye, and then cometh the iudgement: euen so Christ was once offered to take away the sinnes of many, and vnto them that looke for him, shall he appeare agayne without synne, vnto saluacion.
THe feast of swete bread drewe nye, whiche is called Easter, and the hye priestes Scribes sought howe they might kill hym, for they feared the people.
Then entred Satha~ into Iudas whose sirname was Iscarioth (whiche was of the numbre of the .xij.) and he went his waye and commoned with the hye priestes and officers, howe he might betray hym vnto them.
And they were glad, and promised to geue hym money.
And he consented, and sought oportunitie to betraye hym vnto them, whe~ the people were away.
Then came the daye of swete breade, when of necessitie passeouer must be offred.
And he sent Peter and Iohn, saying: goe prepare vs the passeouer, that we may eate.
They sayed vnto him: where wylt thou that we prepare? And he sayed vnto them: beholde, when ye entre into the citie, there shall a manne meete you bearing a pitcher of water, him folowe into thesame house that he entreth in, and ye shall saye vnto the good man of the house: the maister sayeth vnto thee: where is the geast chambre where shall eate the passeouer with my disciples? And he shall shewe you a great parlour paued: there make ready.
And they wente and founde as he had sayed vnto them, and they made ready the passeouer.
And when the houre was come, he sate downe, and the .xij. Apostles with him.
And he sayd vnto them: haue inwardly desyred to eate this passeouer with you, before that suffre.
For saye vnto you: henceforth will not eate of it any more, vntill it be fulfilled in the kingdome of God.
And he tooke the cup, and gaue thankes, and sayd: Take this, and deuide it among you.
For say vnto you: will not drinke of the fruite of the vine, vntill the kingdome of God come.
And he toke bread, when he had geue~ thankes, he brake it, and gaue vnto them, saying: This is my body, which is geuen for you: This do in the remembraunce of me.
Lykewyse also when he had supped, he tooke the cuppe, saying: This cup is the newe testamente in my bloude, whiche is shed for you.
Yet beholde, the hande of him that betrayeth me, is with me on the table.
And truly the sonne of manne goeth as it is appointed: but woe vnto that manne, by whom he is betrayed.
And they began to enquire among themselues, whiche of them it was that should do it.
And there was a striefe among them, whiche of them shoulde seme to be greatest.
And he sayde vnto them: the kinges of nacions reigne ouer them, they that haue authoritie vpon them, are called gracious Lordes: but ye shall not be so.
But he that is greatest among you, shalbe as the yonger, and he that is chiefe, shalbe as he that doth minister.
For whether is greater he that sitteth at meate, or he that serueth? Is not he that sitteth at meate? But am among you, as he that ministreth, Ye are they which haue bydden with me in my temptacions.
And appointed vnto you a kyngdome, as my father hath appointed to me, that ye may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome, and sit on seates, iudgeyng the .xii. tribes of Israel.
And the Lorde sayd: Simon, Simon behold, Sathan hath desired to sift you, as it were wheat: But haue prayed for thee, that thy fayth fayle not.
And he sayd vnto hym: Lorde am ready to go with thee into prieson, and to death.
And he sayd: tell thee Peter, the Cocke shall not krowe this daye, tyll thou haue thrise denied that thou knowest me.
And he sayde vnto them: when se~t you without wallet, and scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And they sayd, no.
Then sayd he vnto them: but now he that hath a wallet, let hym take it vp, and likewise his scrip.
And he that hath no sweord, let hym sell his coate and bye one.
For say vnto you, that yet thesame which is written, must be perfourmed in me: euen among the wicked was he reputed: For those thynges whiche are written of me haue an ende.
And they sayed: Lord, behold, here are .ii. swordes: and he sayd vnto them: it is ynough.
And he came out, and we~t (as he was wont) to Mount Oliuete.
And when he came to the place, he sayde vnto them: pray, leste ye fall into temptacion.
And he gate hymselfe from them about a stones cast, and kneled downe and prayed, saying: Father, yf thou wilt, remoue this cup from me: Neuerthelesse, not my will, but thyne be fulfilled.
And there appeared an Aungel vnto him from heauen, coumfortyng hym.
And he was in an agony and prayed the longer: and hys sweate was lyke droppes of bloud, tricklyng downe to the ground.
And whe~ he arose from prayer, and was come to his disciples, he founde them slepyng for heauinesse, and he sayed vnto them: why slepe ye? Ryse and praye, leste ye fall into temptacion.
Whyle he yet spake, behold, there came a companye, and he that was called Iudas, one of the .xii. went before the~, and preased nye vnto Iesus, to kisse hym.
But Iesus sayd vnto him: Iudas, betrayest thou the so~ne of man with a kisse? When they whiche were about hym sawe what would folow, they sayde vnto him: Lord, shall we smyte with the sweorde? And one of them smote a seruaunt of the hye priest, and stroke of his ryght eare.
Then Iesus sayd vnto the hye priestes, and rulers of the temple, and the elders, whiche were come to him: Ye be come out as vnto a thefe, weth swordes and staues.
When was dayly with you in the temple, ye stretched forth no handes againste me: but this is euen your very houre, and the power of darkenes.
Then toke they hym led hym, brought him to the hye priestes house.
And when they had kindled a fyer in the middes of the palace, and were sette downe together: Peter also sate downe among them.
But when one of the wenches behelde hym, as he sate by the fyer (and loked vpon him) she sayed: this same felow was also with him.
And after a lytle whyle, another saw him, and sayd: thou art also of them.
And about the space of an houre after, an other affirmed, saying: verely, this felowe was with hym also, for he is of Galile.
And Peter remembred the worde of the Lord, howe he had sayed vnto him: before the Cocke krowe, thou shalt deny me thrise: and Peter went out and wept bitterly.
And the men that tooke Iesus mocked hym, and smote hym: and when they had blindfolded him, they stroke hym on the face, and asked hym, saying: Areade, who is it that smote thee? And many other thynges despitefully sayde they agaynst hym.
And assone as it was daye, the Elders of the people, and the hye priestes and Scribes, came together, and led hym into theyr counsell, saying: Art thou very Christe? tell vs.
And he sayed vnto them: yf tell you ye will not beleue me, and yf aske you, you will not aunswere me, nor let me goe: hereafter shall the sonne of man sit on the right hande of the power of God.
Then sayed they all: Art thou then the sonne of God? he sayde: Ye saye that am.
And they sayed: what nede we of any further witnes? for we oure selues haue heard of his owne mouth.
THis warne you of, and commende not, that ye come not together after a better maner, but after a worse.
For first of all, whe~ ye come together in the congregacio~, heare that there is discencion among you, and partly beleue it.
For there must be sectes among you, that they whiche are perfect amo~g you, may be knowen.
When ye come together therfore into one place, the Lordes supper cannot bee eaten, for euery man beginneth afore to eate his owne supper.
Haue ye not houses to eate and drynke in? despise ye the congregacion of God, and shame them that haue not? what shall saye vnto you? shall prayse you? In this prayse you not.
For the Lorde Iesus, thesame night in whiche he was betrayed, tooke bread: and when he had geuen thankes, he brake it, sayd: Take ye eate, this is my body, whiche is broken for you.
After thesame maner also, he toke the cup when supper was done, saying: this cup is the newe testament in my bloud.
This dooe, as oft as ye drinke it, in remembraunce of me.
For as often as ye shall eate this bread, and drinke this cuppe, ye shall shewe the Lordes death tyll he come.
Wherfore, whosoeuer shall eate of this bread, or drinke of the cuppe of the Lorde vnworthely, shalbe giltie of the bodye and bloud of the Lorde.
But let a man examin himselfe, and so let hym eate of the bread, and drinke of the cup.
For he that eateth and drynketh vnworthely, eateth and drinketh his owne damnacion, because he maketh no difference of the Lordes body.
For this cause many are weake sicke among you, and many slepe.
For if we had iudged our selfes: we should not haue been iudged.
But when we are iudged of the Lorde, we are chastened, that we should not be damned with the worlde.
Wherfore my brethren, when ye come together to eate, tary one for an other: If any man hongre, let him eate at home, that ye come not together vnto condemnacion.
THe whole multitude of them arose, and led hym vnto Pylate.
And they began to accuse hym, saying: we found this felowe peruertyng the people, and forbyddyng to paye tribute to Cesar: saying that he is Christ a king.
And Pilate apposed him, saying: art thou the king of the Iewes? he answered hym sayed: thou sayest it.
Then sayed Pilate to the hye priestes and to the people: fynd no faut in this man.
And they were the more fierce, saying: he moueth the people, teaching throughout all Iury, and began at Galile, euen to this place.
Whe~ Pilate heard mencion of Galile, he asked whether the man were of Galile.
And assone as he knewe that he belonged vnto Herodes iurisdiccion, he sente hym to Herode, whiche was also at Ierusale~ at that time.
And when Herode saw Iesus, he was excedyng glad, for he was desyrous to see him of a long season, because he had heard many thynges of him, he trusted to haue seen some miracle done by hym.
The hye priestes and Scribes stode furth accused him straightly.
And when he had mocked hym, he arayed hym in whyte clothing, and sent hym again to Pylate.
And thesame daye Pylate and Herode were made frendes together.
And Pylate called together the hye priestes, and the rulers, and the people, and sayd vnto them: ye haue brought this man vnto me, as one that peruerteth the people: and behold, examine hym before you, and finde no faute in this man of those thynges wherof ye accuse hym, no nor yet Herode: For sent you vnto him, and loe, nothing worthy of death is done vnto him: will therfore chasten hym, and let hym looce.
For of necessitie he must haue let one looce vnto them at that feast.
And all the people cryed atonce, saying: awaye with him, and deliuer vs Barrabas: (whiche for acertayne insurreccion made in the citie, and for a murther, was cast in prison.)
Pilate spake againe vnto the~, willing to let Iesus looce.
He sayed vnto them the thirde time: what euill hat he done? finde no cause of death in hym: wyll therfore chasten him, and let hym go.
And they cryed with loude voyces, requiring that he myght be crucified.
And the voyces of them and of the hye priestes preuayled.
And Pilate gaue sentence that it should be as they required, and he let looce vnto them him that (for insurreccion and murther) was cast into prison, whom they had desired: he deliuered to them Iesus, to do with hym what they would.
And as they led hym awaye, they caught one Symon of Ciren comming out of the field: and on him layde they the crosse, that he myght beare it after Iesus.
And there folowed him a great company of people, and of women, which bewailed and lamented him.
But Iesus turned backe vnto them, and sayed: ye daughters of Ierusalem, wepe not for me: but wepe for your selfes and for your children.
For behold, the dayes will come, in the whiche they shall saye: Happy are the baren, the woumbes that neuer bare, and the pappes whiche neuer gaue sucke.
Then shall they begyn to say to the mountaynes, fall on vs: and to the hylles, couer vs.
For if they do this in a grene tree, what shall be done in the dry? And there were two euill doers led with him to be slaine.
And after that thei were come to the place (whiche is called Caluarie) there they crucified hym and the euill doers, one on the right hand, and the other on the left.
Then sayd Iesus: father forgeue them, for they wote not what they do.
And the rulers mocked hym with them, saying: he saued other men, lette hym saue himselfe yf he be very Christe the chosen of God.
The souldiers also mocked hym, and came and offred hym vinegre, and sayd: if thou be the kyng of the Iewes, saue thy selfe.
And a superscripcion was writte~ ouer hym, with letters of Greke, and Latin, and Hebrue: This is the king of the Iewes.
And one of the euil doers whiche were hanged, railed on him, saying: If thou be Christe saue thy selfe and vs.
But the other answered and rebuked him, saying: fearest thou not God, seyng thou art in thesame damnacion? we are righteously punished, for we receyue accordyng to our dedes: but this man hath done nothing amisse.
And he sayde vnto Iesus: Lorde, remembre me when thou comest into thy kyngdome.
And Iesus sayd vnto him: verely say vnto thee: to day shalt thou be with me in Paradise.
And it was about the .vi. houre: and there was darknesse ouer all the earth, vntill the .ix. houre, and the Sonne was darkened.
And the vayle of the temple did rente, euen through the middes.
And when Iesus had cryed wyth a loude voyce, he sayed: Father, into thy handes commend my spirite.
And when he thus had sayed, he gaue vp the goste.
When the Centurion sawe what had happened, he glorified God, saying: verely, this was a righteous man.
And all the people that came together to that syght, and sawe the thinges which had happened, smote their brestes and returned.
And all his acquaintaunce, and the women that folowed him from Galile, stode a farre of, beholdynge these thynges.
And beholde, there was a man named Ioseph a counsailor, and he was a good man and a iust: thesame had no consented to the counsaile and dede of them, whiche was of Aramathia, a citie of the Iewes, whyche same also waited for the kingdome of God: he wente vnto Pylate and begged the body of Iesus, and tooke it downe, and wrapped it in a lynnen clothe, and layed it in a sepulchre that was hewen in stone, wherein neuer man before had been layde.
And that daye was the preparyng of the Sabboth, and the Sabboth drue on.
The women that folowed after, whiche had come with him from Galile, behelde the sepulchre, and howe his bodye was layde.
And they returned, and prepared swete Odours oyntmentes: But rested on the Sabboth daye, accordyng to the commaundemente.
ALmyghtie God, we beseche thee graciously to beholde this thy famely: for the whiche oure Lorde Iesus Christe was contented to be betrayed, and geuen vp into the handes of wicked men, and to suffer death vpon the crosse: who liueth and reigneth. &c.
MY God, my God (loke vpon me:) why hast thou forsake~ me, and art so farre from my health, and from the wordes of my complainte? my God, cry in the day time, but thou hearest not: and in the night season also take no rest.
Our fathers hoped in thee, they trusted in thee: and thou diddest deliuer them.
They called vpon thee, and were helped: they put theyr trust in thee, and were not confounded.
But as for me, am a worme and no manne: a verye skorne of men, and the out cast of the people.
All they that see me, laugh me to skorne: they shote out their lippes, and shake the head, saying.
He trusted in God that he woulde deliuer hym: let hym deliuer him if he will haue him.
But thou arte he that tooke me out of my mothers wombe: thou waste my hope when hanged yet vpon my mothers brestes.
haue been left vnto thee euer sence was borne: thou art my God, euen from my mothers woumbe.
O, goe not from me, for trouble is here at hande: and there is none to helpe me.
Many Oxen are come about me: fatte Bulles of Basan close me in on euery syde.
They gape vpon me with their mouthes: as it were a rampyng and roaryng Lyon.
am powred out like water, and all my bones are out of ioynte: my hearte also in the middes of my body, is euen lyke melting waxe.
My strength is dried vp like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaueth to my gummes: and thou shalt bring me into the dust of death.
For (many) dogges are come about me: and the cou~saile of the wicked lay siege against me.
Thei pearced my handes and my fete: may tell all my bones, they stande staring and loking vpon me.
They part my garmentes among them: and cast lottes vpon my vesture.
But be not thou farre from me, Lorde: thou arte my succour, haste thee to helpe me.
Deliuer my soule from the sworde: my derling from the power of the dogge.
Saue me from the Lyons mouthe: thou haste hearde me also from among the hornes of the Vnicornes.
wil declare thy name vnto my brethren: in the middes of the congregacion wil prayse thee.
praise the Lorde, ye that feare him: magnifie him all ye of the sede of Iacob, and feare ye hym all ye sede of Israel.
For he hath not despised nor abhorred the lowe estate of the poore: he hath not hid his face from him, but when he called vnto him, he heard him.
My praise is of thee in the great congregacio~: my vowes will performe in the sight of them that feare him.
The poore shall eate be satisfied: they that seke after the Lorde shall praise hym, your hearte shall liue for euer.
All the endes of the worlde shall remembre themselues and be turned vnto the Lorde: and all the kynreds of the nations shall worship before him.
For the kingdome is the Lordes: and he is the gouernour among the people.
All suche as be fatte vpon earth: haue eaten and worshipped.
All they that go downe into the dust, shall kneele before him: and no man hath quickened his owne soule.
My seede shall serue hym: they shalbe counted vnto the Lorde for a generacion.
They shall come, and the heauens shall declare hys righteousnes: vnto a people that shalbe borne, whome the Lorde hath made.
After the .ii. Collectes at the Communion, shalbe sayed these .ii. Collectes folowyng.
ALmyghty and euerlastynge God, by whose spirite the whole body of the Churche is gouerned sanctified: receiue our supplicacions and prayers, whiche we offre before thee for all estates of men in thy holy congregacion, that euery membre of thesame, in his vocacion and ministerye, may truly and godly serue thee: through our Lorde Iesus Christe.
MErcifull God, who haste made al men, and hatest nothyng that thou haste made, nor wouldest the deathe of a synner, but rather that he should be co~uerted and liue: haue mercy vpon all Iewes, Turkes, Infidels, and Heretikes, and take from the~ all ignoraunce, hardnes of hearte, and contempt of thy word: And so fetche them home, blessed Lorde, to thy flocke, that they may be saued among the remnant of the true Israelites, and be made one folde, vnder one shepehearde, Iesus Christ our Lorde: who lyuethe and reigneth. &c.
THe lawe (whiche hath but a shadowe of good thynges to come, and not the very fashion of thinges themselues) can neuer with those sacrifices, whiche they offre yere by yere continually, make the commers therunto perfite.
For would not then those sacrifices haue ceased to haue been offred, because that the offerers once purged, shoulde haue had nomore conscience of synnes? Neuerthelesse, in those sacrifices is there mencion made of synnes euerye yeare.
For the bloud of Oxen and of Goates cannot take awaye sinnes.
Wherfore, whe~ he commeth into the worlde, he sayeth: Sacrifice offeryng thou wouldest not haue, but a body hast thou ordayned me.
In the beginning of the booke it is written of me, that should do thy will, God.
Aboue, when he sayth, Sacrifice and offeryng, burnt sacrifices, and synne offeringes, thou wouldest not haue, neither haste thou allowed them (whiche yet are offered by the lawe) then sayed he: loe, am here to do thy will, God: he taketh away the first to establishe the later, by the whiche will, we are made holy, euen by the offering of the body of Iesu Christ once for all.
And euery priest is ready dayly ministring and offerynge often times one maner of Oblacion, which can neuer take away synnes.
But this man, after he hath offered one sacrifice for sinnes, is set downe for euer on the ryghte hande of God, and from henceforth tarieth tyll his foes be made his foote stoole.
For with one offeryng hath he made perfect for euer, them that are sanctified.
The holy goste hymself also beareth vs record, euen when he told before: This is the testament that will make vnto them: After those daies (sayeth the Lord) will put my lawes in theyr heartes, and in their myndes will write them, their synnes and iniquities will remembre nomore.
And where remission of these thynges is, there is nomore offeryng for sinne.
Seeyng therefore brethren, that by the meanes of the bloud of Iesu, we haue libertie to enter into the holye place, by the newe and liuyng waie, whiche he hath prepared for vs, through the vayle (that is to say, by his fleshe:) And seing also that we haue an hye priest whiche is ruler ouer the house of God, let vs drawe nye with a true hearte in a sure fayth, sprinkeled in our heartes from an euil conscience, and washed in our bodyes with pure water: Let vs kepe the profession of our hope, without waueringe (for he is faythfull that promised) and let vs considre one another, to the intent that we may prouoke vnto loue, and to good workes, not forsakyng the felowshipe that we haue among our selues, as the maner of some is: but let vs exhorte one another, and that so muche the more, because ye see that the daye draweth nye.
WHen Iesus had spoken these wordes, he we~t furthe with his disciples ouer the broke Cedron, where was a garden, into the whiche he entred with his disciples.
Iudas also which betrayed him, knewe the place: for Iesus oft times resorted thither with his disciples.
Iudas then after he had receyued a bende of men (and ministers of the hye priestes Phariseis) came thyther with Lanterns, and fyerbra~des, and weapons.
And Iesus knowinge all thinges that should come on him, we~t furth, and saied vnto them: whom seke ye? They answered him: Iesus of Nazareth.
Assone then as he had saied vnto them, am he, they went backewarde, fell to the grounde.
Then asked he them agayne. whom seke ye? They sayed: Iesus of Nazareth.
If ye seke me therfore, let these goe theyr waye: that the saying might be fulfilled whiche he spake.
Of the~ which thou gauest me, haue not lost one.
Then Simon Peter hauing a sworde, drew it, and smote the hye priestes seruaunt, and cut of his right eare.
Therfore sayeth Iesus vnto Peter, put vp thy sweord into the sheath: shall not drinke of the cuppe which my father hathe geuen me? Then the companye and the captayne, and the ministers of the Iewes, tooke Iesus and bound hym, and led hym awaie to Anna firste: for he was father in lawe to Cayphas, whiche was the hye prieste thesame yere.
Cayphas was he that gaue counsell to the Iewes, that it was expediente that one man shoulde dye for the people.
And Simon Peter folowed Iesus, and so dyd an other disciple: that disciple was knowen to the hye priest, and wente in with Iesus into the palace of the hye prieste.
Then wente out that other disciple (whiche was knowen to the hye prieste) and spake to the damosell that kept the doore, and brought in Peter.
Then sayde the damosell that kept the doore vnto Peter: Art not thou also one of this mannes disciples? he sayd: am not.
The seruauntes and ministers stode there, which had made a fyre of coales: for it was colde, and they warmed themselues.
The hye priest then asked Iesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.
Iesus aunswered him: spake openly in the worlde: euer taught in the Synagoge, and in the te~ple, whither all the Iewes haue resorted, and in secrete haue sayed nothing.
Why askest thou me? Aske the~ which heard me, what sayd vnto them.
When he had thus spoken, one of the ministers, which stode by, smote Iesus on the face, saying: Aunswerest thou the hye priest so? Iesus aunswered hym: If haue euil spoken, beare witnesse of the euill: But if haue well spoken, why smitest thou me? And Annas sente hym bounde vnto Cayphas the hye priest.
Then sayd they vnto him: Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denyed it, sayde: am not.
One of the seruau~tes of the hye priestes (his cosin whose eare Peter smote of) sayed vnto him: did not see thee in the garden with him? Peter therfore denied again: and immediatly the Cocke crewe.
Then ledde they Iesus from Cayphas into the hall of iudgemente.
It was in the morninge, they themselfes wente not into the iudgemente hall, leste they shoulde be defiled, but that they myghte eate the Passeouer.
Pilate then went out to them, sayd: what accusacion bringe you againste this man? They answered and sayd vnto hym: If he were not an euil doer, we would not haue deliuered him vnto thee.
Then sayd Pylate vnto them: take ye him and iudge him after your owne lawe.
The Iewes therfore sayed vnto him: It is not lawfull for vs to put any manne to deathe: that the woordes of Iesus myght be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying what death he shoulde dye.
Then Pylate entred into the iudgemente hall againe, called Iesus, and sayed vnto him: Art thou the king of the Iewes? Iesus answered: sayeste thou that of thy selfe, or did other tel it thee of me? Pylate answered: am a Iewe? Thine owne nacion, hye priestes haue deliuered thee vnto me: what hast thou done? Iesus answered: my kyngdome is not of this worlde: yf my kyngdome were of this worlde, then would my ministers surely fight, that shoulde not be deliuered to the Iewes: but nowe is my kingdome not from hence.
Pylate therefore sayed vnto him: Art thou a kynge then? Iesus answered: thou saiest that am a king.
For this cause was borne, for this cause came into the world, that should beare witnes vnto the trueth.
And all that are of the truethe, heare my voyce.
Pylate sayde vnto hym: what thyng is truethe? And when he had sayd this, he wente out againe vnto the Iewes, sayeth vnto them: finde in him no cause at all.
Ye haue a custome that shoulde deliuer you one loce at Easter: wil ye that loce vnto you the king of the Iewes? The~ cried they al again, saying: Not him, but Barrabas: thesame Barrabas was a murtherer.
And the souldiers wounde a croune of thornes, put it on his head.
And they dyd on him a purple garmente, came vnto him and sayed: hayle king of the Iewes: and they smote him on the face.
Pylate went furth againe, and sayd vnto them: beholde, brynge him furth to you, that ye may know that finde no faulte in him.
The~ came Iesus furth, wearing a crou~e of thorne, and a robe of purple.
When the hye priestes therefore and ministers sawe hym, they cryed, sayinge: crucifie hym, crucifie hym.
Pylate sayth vnto them: take ye hym crucifie him, for finde no cause in him.
The Iewes au~swered him: we haue a lawe, and by our lawe, he ought to die, because he made himselfe the sonne of God.
When Pilate heard that saying, he was the more afrayed, went againe into the iudgeme~t hall, sayeth vnto Iesus: whence art thou? But Iesus gaue him none answere.
The~ sayd Pilate vnto him: Speakeste thou not vnto me? knoweste thou not that haue power to crucifie thee, and haue power to looce thee? Iesus answered: Thou couldest haue power at all agaynste me, excepte it were geue~ thee fro~ aboue: Therfore he that deliuered me vnto thee, hath the more sinne: And from thencefurth sought Pilate meanes to looce him: but the Iewes cryed, sayinge: yf thou let hym goe, thou arte not Cesars frende: for whosoeuer maketh himselfe a kynge, is againste Cesar.
When Pilate heard that saying, he broughte Iesus furth, and sate downe to geue sentence in a place that is called the Pauement, but in the Hebrue tong Gabbatha.
It was the preparinge day of Easter, about the. vi. houre.
They cryed, saying: away with hym, awaye with hym: crucyfy hym.
Pylate sayeth vnto them: shall crucyfy your kyng? The hye priestes aunswered: we haue no king but Cesar.
And he bare his crosse, and wente furthe into a place whiche is called the place of dead mennes sculles: but in Hebrue golgotha: where they crucyfyed hym, and two other with hym: on either side one, and Iesus in the middest.
And Pilate wrot a title and put it on the crosse.
The writing was, Iesus of Nazareth kyng of the Iewes.
This title read many of the Iewes: for the place where Iesus was crucified, was nie to the citie.
Then sayd the hye priestes of the Iewes to Pilate: write not kyng of the Iewes, but that he sayd: am kyng of the Iewes.
The~ the souldiers, when thei had crucified Iesus, toke his garmentes and made .iiii. partes, to euery souldier a parte, and also his coate.
They sayed therfore among themselues: let vs not deuide it, but cast lottes for it, who shall haue it.
That the scripture might be fulfylled saying: They haue parted my rayment among them, and for my coat dyd they caste lottes.
There stode by the crosse of Iesus his mother and his mothers syster, Mary the wyfe of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.
When Iesus therefore sawe his mother, and the disciple standynge, whome he loued, he saieth vnto his mother: woman, behode thy so~ne.
And fro~ that houre the disciple toke her for his owne.
After these thinges, Iesus knowing that all thynges were now performed, that the scripture might be fulfilled, he saieth: thrist.
So there stode a vessel by full of vineger: therfore they filled a sponge with vineger, and wounde it about with Isope, and putte it to his mouth.
Assone as Iesus then receyued of the vineger, he sayed: It is finished, and bowed his head and gaue vp the goste.
The Iewes therefore, because it was the preparing of the Sabbothe that the bodyes shoulde not remayne vpon the Crosse on the Sabboth day (for that Sabboth day, was an hie daye) besought Pilate, that their legges might be broken, and that they might be taken downe.
The~ came the souldiours and brake the legges of the firste, and of the other whiche was crucified wyth hym.
But when they came to Iesus, and sawe that he was deade already, they brake not his legges: but one of the souldiours with a speare thrust him into the side, forth with came there out bloud and water.
And he that sawe it bare recorde, and his recorde is true.
And he knoweth that he sayeth true, that ye myght beleue also.
For these thinges were done that the scripture should be fulfilled: ye shall not breake a bone of him.
And againe an other scripture saieth: they shall loke vpon him, whom they haue pearced.
After this, Ioseph of Aramathia (whiche was a disciple of Iesus, but secretly for feare of the Iewes) besoughte Pylate that he might take downe the bodye of Iesus.
And Pylate gaue him lycence: He came therfore and tooke the bodye of Iesus.
And there came also Nicodemus (whiche at the beginning came to Iesus by nyght) and brought of myrre and Aloes mingled together, about an hundreth pounde weight.
Then tooke they the body of Iesu, and wounde it in linnen clothes with the odours, as the maner of the Iewes is to burye.
And in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a newe Sepulchre, wherin was neuer man layd: There layd they Iesus therefore, because of the preparynge of the Sabbothe of the Iewes, for the Sepulchre was nye at hande.
Lorde God of my saluacion, haue cryed day night before thee: let my prayer enter into thy prese~ce, incline thine eare vnto my calling.
For my soule is full of trouble: my life draweth nye vnto hell.
am counted as one of them that goe downe vnto the pytte: and haue bene euen as a manne that hathe no strengthe.
Free among the dead, lyke vnto them that bee wounded and lye in the graue, whiche be out of remembraunce: and are cut awaye from thy hande.
Thou haste layed me in the loweste pitte, in a place of darcknes: and in the depe.
Thyne indignacion lyeth harde vpon me: and thou hast vexed me with all thy stormes.
Thou hast put awaye myne acquayntaunce far from me: and made me to be abhorred of them.
My sight fayleth for very trouble: lord haue called dayly vpon thee, haue stretched out my handes vnto thee.
Doeste thou shewe wonders among the dead? or shall the dead rise vp agayne and prayse thee? Shall thy louing kindnes be shewed in the graue? or thy faythfulnesse in destruccion.
Shall thy wonderous workes be knowne in the darke? and thy righteousnes in the lande where all thynges are forgotten.
Vnto thee haue cryed, Lorde: and earlye shall my prayer come before thee.
Lord, why abhorrest thou my soule? and hidest thou thy face from me? am in misery, and lyke vnto him that is at the pointe to dye: (euen from my youth vppe) thy terrours haue suffered with a troubled mynde.
Thy wrathfull displeasure goeth ouer me: and the feare of thee, hath vndone me.
They came rounde aboute me dayelye lyke water: and compassed me together on euery syde.
My louers and frendes hast thou put awaye from me: and hid myne acquayntaunce out of my syght.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy ghoste.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
IT is better (if the will of God be so) that ye suffre for well doing then for euil doing.
For asmuche as Christ hath once suffered for sinnes, the iust for the vniust, to bring vs to God: and was kylled as partayning to the flesh, but was quickened in the spirite.
In which spirite he also went and preached to the spirites that were in prison, whiche some tyme had beene disobedient, when the long suffring of God was once looked for in the dayes of Noe, whyle the arke was a preparing: wherin a fewe, that is to saye, eyghte soules were saued by the water, lyke as Baptisme also nowe saueth vs: not the putting awaye of the fylthe of the fleshe, but in that a good conscience confenteth to God by the resurreccion of Iesus Christ, which is on the right hande of God: and is gone into heauen: Angels, powers, and might, subdued vnto hym.
WHen the eue~ was come, there came a riche ma~ of Aramathia named Ioseph, whiche also was Iesus disciple.
And whe~ Ioseph had taken the bodye, he wrapped it in a cleane linnen clothe, layed it in his newe toumbe, which he had hewen out euen in the rocke, rolled a greate stone to the doore of the Sepulchre, departed.
And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary sytting ouer agaynst the Sepulchre.
The nexte daye that folowed the daye of preparing, the high priestes and Phariseis came together vnto Pilate, saying: Sir, we remembre that this deceyuer sayed while he was yet aliue: After iii. dayes will rise againe: Commaunde therfore that the Sepulchre bee made sure vntyll the thirde daye, leste his disciples come and steale him awaye, and say vnto the people, he is risen from the dead: and the last erroure shall be worse then the firste.
Pylate sayed vnto them: ye haue the watche, goe your waye, make it as sure as ye can.
So they wente and made the Sepulchre sure with the watche menne, and sealed the stone.
In the mornyng afore mattyns, the people being assembled in the churche: these Anthems shalbe fyrst solemnely song, or, sayed.
For in that he dyed, he dyed but once to put awaye sinne: but in that he liueth he liueth vnto God.
And so lykewyse, counte youre selues dead vnto synne, but lyuyng vnto God in Christe Iesus our Lorde.
CHriste is risen agayne, the fyrste fruytes of them that slepe: for seyng that by man came deathe, by man also commeth the resurreccion of the dead: For as by Adam al men do dye, so by Christe all menne shalbe restored to lyfe.
God, who for our rede~pcion diddest geue thine onely begotten sonne to the death of the crosse: by his gloryous resurreccion hast delyuered vs from the power of our enemye: Graunte vs so to dye dayly fro~ sinne, that we may euermore liue with him in the ioye of his resurreccion: through thesame Christ our Lorde.
PRe&serue me, God: for in thee haue put my trust.
my soule, thou hast saied vnto the Lorde: thou art my God, my goodes are nothing vnto thee.
All my delyght is vpon the Sainctes that are in the yearth: and vpon suche as excell in vertue.
But they that runne after an other God: shall haue great trouble.
Their dryncke offeringes of bloude wyll not offer: neither make mencion of their names within my lyppes.
The Lord himselfe is the porcion of myne inheritaunce, and of my Cuppe: thou shalt mayntayne my lotte.
The lotte is fallen vnto me in a fayre grounde: yea, haue a goodly heritage.
wyll thanke the Lorde for geuing me warning: my reynes also chasten me in the night season.
haue sette God alwayes before me: for he is on my right hand, therfore shall not fall.
Wherefore my hearte was glad, and my glory reioysed: my fleshe also shall rest in hope.
For why? thou shalt not leaue my soule in helle: neither shalt thou suffre thy holy one to see corrupcion.
Thou shalt shewe me the pathe of life: in thy presence is the fulnes of ioye, and at thy right hand there is pleasure for euermore Glory be to the father and to the sonne: and to. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
ALmightie God, which through thy onely begotten sonne Iesus Christ, hast ouercome death, opened vnto vs the gate of euerlastyng life: we humbly beseche thee, that as by thy speciall grace, preuentyng vs, thou doest put in our mindes good desires: so by thy continuall helpe, we may bryng thesame to good effect, through Iesus Christ our Lorde: who lyueth and reigneth. &c.
IF ye be rise~ againe with Christ, seke those thinges which are aboue, where Christ sitteth on the right ha~d of God.
Set your affeccio~ on heaue~ly thinges and not on yearthy thinges.
For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christe in God.
Whensoeuer Christ (whiche is our lyfe) shall shewe himselfe, then shall ye also appeare with him in glory.
Mortifie therfore your earthy membres, fornicacion, vncleanes, vnnaturall lust, euil concupiscence and couetousnes, whiche is wurshyppynge of ydolles: for whiche thinges sake, the wrathe of God vseth to come on the disobedient children, among whom ye walked somtime when ye lyued in them.
THe firste daye of the Sabbothes came Mary Magdalene earlye (when it was yet darcke) vnto the Sepulchre, and sawe the stone taken away fro~ the graue.
The~ she ranne came to Simon Peter, to the other disciple who~ Iesus loued saith vnto the~: they haue taken away the lorde out of the graue, and we cannot tell where they haue laied hym.
Peter therfore went foorth and that other disciple and came vnto the Sepulchre.
They ranne both together, and the other disciple did out runne Peter, and came firste to the Sepulchre.
And when he had stowped doune, he saw the lynnen clothes lying, yet wente he not in.
Then came Simon Peter folowing hym, and went into the sepulchre and sawe the lynnen clothes lye, and the napkin that was aboute his heade, not lying with the lynnen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by it selfe.
Then wente in also that other disciple whiche came firste to the sepulchre, he sawe and beleued.
For as yet they knewe not the scripture that he shoulde ryse againe from death.
Then the disciples went awaye agayne vnto their owne home.
LOrde, howe are they encreased that trouble me? many are they that ryse agaynst me.
Many one there bee that saye of my soule: there is no helpe for him in his God.
But thou, Lorde, art my defender: thou art my worshyp, and the lifter vp of my head.
dyd call vpon the Lorde with my voyce: and he hearde me out of his holy hill.
layde me downe and slept: and rose vp agayne, for the Lorde sustayned me.
wil not be afrayd for ten thousa~des of the people: that haue set themselues agaynste me rounde aboute.
Vp Lorde and helpe me, my God: for thou smitest all myne enemies vpon the cheke bone, thou haste broken the teeth of the vngodly.
Saluacion belongeth vnto the lorde: and thy blessing is vpon thy people.
Glory bee to the father and to the sonne: and to the holy ghost.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer shalbee: worlde without ende.
ALmightie father, whiche hast geuen thy onely sonne to dye for our sinnes; and to rise agayne for oure iustificacion: Graunte vs so to putte awaye the leauen of malyce and wickednesse, that we maye alwaye serue thee in purenesse of liuing and trueth, through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
KNow ye not that a litle leauen sowreth the whole lompe of dowe? Pourge therefore the olde leauen, that ye maye be newe dowe, as ye are swete bread.
For Christ our passeouer is offered vp for vs. Therfore let vs kepe holye daye, not with olde leauen, neither with the leauen of maliciousnes and wickednes: but with the swete breade of purenes and trueth.
WHen the Sabboth was paste, Mary Magdalene, and Mary Iacoby, and Salome, bought swete odoures, that they myghte come, and anoynt hym.
And early in the morning, the first day of the Sabboth, they came vnto the Sepulchre when the sonne was risen.
And they sayed among themselues: who shall rolle vs away the stone fro~ the dore of the Sepulchre? And when they looked, they sawe howe that the stone was rolled away, for it was a very great one.
And they wente into the Sepulchre, and sawe a younge man sytting on the right syde, clothed in a longe white garmente, and they were afrayed.
And he sayed vnto them: be not afrayed, ye seke Iesus of Nazareth whiche was crucified.
He is risen he is not here: Beholde the place where they had put him.
But goe your waye and tell his disciples, and Peter, that he goeth before you into Galile, there shall you see him, as he sayed vnto you.
And they went out quickly and fledde from the Sepulchre, for they trembled, and were amased, neyther sayed they anye thing to anye man, for they were afrayde.
MY soule truely wayteth styll vpon God: for of him commeth my saluacion.
He verely is my strength and my saluacion: he is my defence, so that shall not greatly fal.
Howe longe wil ye imagine mischefe against euery ma~? ye shalbe slaine al the sort of you, yea, as a tottering wal shall ye be, and lyke a broken hedge.
Their deuice is onely howe to put him out whom God will exalte: their delyte is in lyes, they geue good woordes with their mouth, but curse with their hearte.
Neuerthelesse, my soule, wayte thou still vpon God: for my hope is in him.
He truely is my strength and my saluacion: he is my defence, so that shall not fall.
In God is my health and my glory: the rocke of my myght, and in God is my trust.
put your trust in him alwaye, ye people: powre oute your heartes before him, for God is our hope.
As for the children of men, they are but vayne, the children of men are deceiptful: vpon the weyghtes, they are altogether lyghter then vaynitie it selfe.
trust not in wrong and robbery, geue not your selues vnto vanitie: yf ryches encrease, set not your hearte vpon them.
God spake once and twise: haue also heard the same, that power belongeth vnto God.
And that thou Lorde art mercifull: for thou rewardest euery man according to his worke.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
ALmyghtye God, whiche through thy onely begotten sonne Iesus Christe, haste ouercome deathe, and opened vnto vs the gate of euerlasting life: we humbly beseche thee, that as by thy speciall grace, preuentyng vs, thou doest putte in oure myndes good desyres: so by thy continuall helpe, we may bring thesame to good effect, through Iesus Christe our Lorde: who lyueth and reygneth. &c.
PEter opened his mouth, and sayd: of a trueth perceyue that there is no respecte of persons with God, but in all people, he that feareth hym and worketh righteousnes, is accepted with hym.
Ye knowe the preaching that God sente vnto the children of Israell, preaching peace by Iesu Christe, whiche is Lorde ouer all thinges: which preaching was published throughout all Iewry (and began in Galilee, after the baptisme whiche Iohn preached) howe God annoynted Iesus of Nazareth with the holy ghoste, and with power.
Which went about doing good, and healynge all that were oppressed of the deuil, for god was with him.
And we are witnesses of all thinges whiche he did in the lande of the Iewes, and at Ierusalem: whome they slewe and hanged on tree.
Hym God reised vp the thirde day shewed him openly, not to all the people, but vnto vs witnesses (chosen before of God for thesame intent) which did eate and drinke with him after he arose from death.
And he commaunded vs to preach vnto the people, and to testifie, that it is he whiche was ordained of God to be the iudge of the quicke and deade.
To him geue all the prophetes witnes, that through his name, whosoeuer beleueth in him, shall receyue remission of synnes.
BEholde, two of the disciples wente that same daye to a towne called Emaus, whiche was from Ierusalem about .lx. furlonges: and they talked together of all the thinges that had happened.
And it chau~ced that while they co~moned together reasoned: Iesus himselfe drue nere and went with the~.
But their eyes were holde~ that they should not knowe hym.
And he sayd vnto them: what maner of communicacions are these that ye haue one to another as ye walke, and are sad? And the one of them (whose name was Cleophas) aunswered, and sayd vnto him: art thou onely a straunger in Ierusalen, and haste not knowen the thinges whiche haue chaunced there in these dayes? he sayd vnto them: what thynges? And they sayd vnto him: of Iesus of Nazareth, whiche was a Prophete, mightie in dede and word before God and all the people: and how the hie priestes, and our rulers, deliuered him to be condemned to death, and haue crucified hym.
But we trusted that it had been he whiche shoulde haue redemed Israell.
And as touching all these thinges, to daye is euen the third daye that they were doen.
Yea, and certayne women also of our companye made vs astonied, whiche came earely vnto the Sepulchre and founde not his body, and came saying, that they had sene a vision of Angels, whiche sayed that he was alyue.
And certayne of them whyche were wyth vs, went to the Sepulchre, and found it euen so as the women had sayed: but him they sawe not.
And he sayd vnto them: fooles and slowe of hearte to beleue all that the prophetes haue spoke~.
Ought not Christ to haue suffred these thinges, and to entre into hys glorye? And he began at Moses and al the prophetes, and interpreted vnto them in all Scriptures which were written of him.
And they drue nye vnto the toune, whiche they wente vnto.
And he made as thoughe he woulde haue gone further.
And they constrayned hym, sayinge: abyde with vs, for it draweth towardes nyght, and the day is farre passed.
And it came to passe as he sate at meate with them, he toke breade and blessed it, and brake, and gaue vnto them.
And their eyes were opened, and they knewe him, and he vanished out of their sight.
And they sayd betwene themselues: dyd not our heartes burne within vs, whyle he talked with vs by the waye, and opened to vs the Scriptures? And they rose vp thesame houre and returned to Ierusale~, and found the eleuen gathered together, and them that were with them, saying: the Lorde is rysen in dede, and hath appered to Simon.
And they tolde what thinges were done in the way, and how they knewe hym in breaking of the breade.
PRay&se the Lorde (ye seruauntes: praise the name of the Lorde.
Blessed is the name of the Lorde: from this tyme furth for euermore.
The Lordes name is praysed: fro~ the rising vp of the sonne, vnto the going downe of the same.
The lorde is hye aboue all heathen: and his glory aboue the heauens.
Who is lyke vnto the Lorde our God, that hathe hys dwelling so hie: and yet humbleth himselfe, to beholde the thinges that are in heauen and earth.
He taketh vp the simple oute of the dust: and lifteth the poore out of the mier.
That he may set hym with the princes: euen with the princes of his people.
He maketh the baren woman to kepe house: and to be a ioyfull mother of children.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
ALmighty father, which haste geuen thy onely sonne to dye for our sinnes, to rise agayne for our iustificacion: Grau~t vs so to put away the leuen of malice wickednes, that we maye alway serue thee in purenes of liuing trueth, through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
YE men and brethren, Children of the generacion of Abraham whosoeuer among you feareth God: to you is this worde of saluacion sent.
For the inhabiters of Ierusale~, and their rulers, because they knewe him not, nor yet the voices of the prophetes, which are read euery Sabboth day, thei haue fulfilled the~ i~ co~de~ning him.
And when they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate to kyll hym.
And when they had fulfylled all that were written of hym, they toke hym downe from the tree, and put hym in a Sepulchre.
But God raysed hym agayne from death the thirde daye, and he was sene manye dayes of them whiche wente with him from Galile to Ierusalem: which are his witnesses vnto the people.
And we declare vnto you, how that the promes (which was made vnto the fathers) GOD hath fulfilled vnto their children (euen vnto vs) in that he raysed vp Iesus agayne: Euen as it is written in the second Psalme: Thou art my sonne, this daye haue begotten thee.
As concernyng that he raysed him vp from death, nowe no more to returne to corrupcion, he sayed on this wise: The holy promises made to Dauid, wil geue faythfullye to you.
Wherefore he sayeth also in an other place: Thou shalt not suffre thyne holy to see corrupcion.
For Dauid (after that he had in his tyme fulfilled the wyll of GOD) fell on slepe, and was layed vnto his fathers, and sawe corrupcio~.
Bee it knowne vnto you therefore (ye men and brethren) that throughe thys man, is preached vnto you the forgeuenes of sinnes, and that by hym all that beleue, are iustified from all thynges, from which ye could not be iustified by the lawe of Moses.
Beware therfore, lest that fall on you, whiche is spoken of in the Prophetes: behold ye despisers, and wonder, and perishe ye: for doe a worke in your daies, which ye shall not beleue, though a man declare it you.
IE&sus stode in the middes of his disciples, and sayed vnto them: peace be vnto you: It is feare not.
But they were abashed and afrayd, supposed that they had sene a spirite.
And he saied vnto the~: why are ye troubled, why do thoughtes arise in your heartes? Behold my handes my feete, that it is euen my selfe.
Handle me and see, for a spirite hath not fleshe and bones, as ye see me haue.
And when he had thus spoken, he shewed them his handes, and his fete.
And whyle they yet beleued not for ioye, and wondered, he sayed vnto them: Haue ye here any meate? And they offered him a peace of a broyled fishe, and of an Honye combe.
And he sayed vnto them: these are the wordes whiche spake vnto you, whyle was yet with you: That all must nedes be fulfilled, whiche were written of me in the Lawe of Moses, in the Prophetes, and in the Psalmes.
Then opened he their wittes, that they mighte vnderstande the scriptures, and sayed vnto them: Thus it is written, and thus it behoued Christe to suffer, and to rise agayne from death the thirde daye, and that repentaunce and remission of sinnes, shoulde bee preached in his name among all nacions, and muste begin at Ierusalem.
BLe&s&sed is the man that feareth the Lorde: he hathe greate delyghte in hys commaundementes.
His seede shalbe mightie vpon yearthe: the generacion of the faythefull shalbe blessed.
Riches and plenteousnes shalbe in his house: and hys righteousnes endureth for euer.
Vnto the Godly there ariseth vp lyght in the darkenes: he is mercifull, louing and righteous.
good man is mercifull and lendeth: and wyll guyde his wordes with discrecion.
For he shall neuer be moued: and the righteous shalbe had in euerlasting remembraunce.
He will not bee afrayed for any euyl tydynges: for hys hearte standeth fast, and beleueth in the Lorde.
His hearte is stablyshed and will not shrynke: vntill he see his desire vpon his enemyes.
He hath sparsed abroade and geue~ to the poore: and hys righteousnes remaineth for euer, his horne shalbee exalted with honor.
The vngodlye shall se it, and it shall greue him: he shall gnashe with his teeth and consume awaye, the desyre of the vngodly shall perishe.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is now, and euer. &c.
And this is the victory that ouercommeth the worlde, euen our faith.
Who is it that ouercommeth the worlde, but he whiche beleueth that Iesus is the sonne of God? This Iesus Christe is he that came by water and bloude, not by water onely, but by water and bloud.
And it is the spirite that beareth witnesse, because the spirite is truethe.
For there are three whiche beare recorde in heauen, the father, the woorde, and the holy ghoste, and these three are one.
And there are three whiche beare recorde in yearth, the spirite, and, water, and bloude, and these three are one.
If wee receyue the witnes of menne, the witnes of God is greater.
For this is the witnes of God that is greater, whiche he testified of his sonne.
He that beleueth on the sonne of God, hath the witnes in hymselfe.
He that beleueth not God, hath made hym a lyer, because he beleueth not the recorde that God gaue of his sonne.
And this is the record, how that God hath geuen vnto vs eternall life, and this lyfe is in his sonne.
He that hath the sonne, hath lyfe: and he that hath not the sonne of God, hath not lyfe.
IHe&same daye at nyghte, whiche was the first day of the Sabbothes, whe~ the dores were shut (where the disciples were assembled together, for feare of the Iewes) came Iesus and stode in the middes, and sayd vnto them: Peace be vnto you.
And when he had so sayde, he shewed vnto them his handes and his syde.
Then were the disciples glad, when they sawe the Lorde.
As my father sent me, euen so sende you also.
And when he had saide those wordes, he breathed on them, and saide vnto them: receyue ye the holy gost.
HA&ste thee, God, to deliuer me: Make haste to helpe me, Lorde.
Let them bee ashamed and confounded, that seke after my soule: lette them be turned backeward and put to confusion, that wishe me euill.
Let them (for their reward) be soone brought to shame: that crye ouer me, there, there.
But let all those that seke thee, be ioyfull and gladde in thee: and let al suche as delight in thy saluacion, say alway, the Lorde be praysed.
As for me am poore and in misery: Haste thee vnto me (O God.)
Thou art my helpe and my redemer: Lorde make no long tarying.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
ALmightie God, whiche haste geuen thy holy sonne to be vnto vs, both a sacrifice for synne, and also an example of Godly lyfe: Geue vs the grace that we may alwayes moste thankfully receiue that his inestimable benefite, and also dayly indeuour our selfes, to folowe the blessed steppes of his moste holy lyfe.
THis is thanke worthy, yf a manne for conscience toward God, indure griefe, and suffre wrong vndeserued.
For what prayse is it yf when ye bee buffeted for your fautes, ye take it paciently? But and if when ye doe well, ye suffre wrong and take it paciently, then is there tha~ke with God.
For hereunto verely were ye called: For Christe also suffered for vs, leauyng vs an ensample, that ye shoulde folowe his steppes, whiche dyd no synne, neyther was there guyle found in his mouth: which, when he was reuiled, reuiled not againe: when he suffered, he threatned not: but committed the vengeaunce to hym that iudgeth righteously, which his owne selfe bare our sinnes in his body on the tree, that we being deliuered from sinne, should lyue vnto righteousnes.
But are nowe turned vnto the shepheard, and bishop of your soules.
CHri&ste sayed to his disciples: am the good shepheard, a good shepheard geueth his lyfe for the shepe.
An hired seruaunte, he whiche is not the shepheard (neyther the shepe are his owne) seeth the wolfe commyng, and leaueth the shepe and flieth, and the wolfe catcheth, and skattreth the shepe.
The hired seruaunt flyeth, because he is an hired seruaunte, and careth not for the shepe.
am the good shepheard, and knowe my shepe, and am knowen of myne.
As my Father knoweth me, euen so knowe also my Father.
And geue my lyfe for the shepe: and other shepe haue, whiche are not of this folde.
Them also must bryng, and they shall heare my voyce, and there shalbe one folde, and one shepheard.
VNto thee (O God) doe we geue thankes: yea, vnto thee doe we geue thankes.
Thy name also is so nye: and that doe thy wonderous workes declare.
The earth is weake, and all the inhabitours therof: beare vp the pillers of it.
sayed vnto the fooles, deale not so madly: and to the vngodly, set not vp your horne.
Sette not vp youre horne on hye: and speake not with a stiffe necke.
For promocion commeth neither from the East, nor from the West: nor yet from the Southe.
And why? GOD is the iudge: he putteth downe one and setteth vp an other.
For in the hande of the Lorde there is a cup, and the wine is red: it is full mixte, and he poureth out of thesame.
As for the dregges therof: all the vngodly of the yearth shall drinke them, and sucke them out.
But will talke of the God of Iacob: and prayse hym for euer.
All the hornes of the vngodly also will breake: and the hornes of the righteous shalbe exalted.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
ALmightie God, which shewest to all men that be in errour, the light of thy trueth, to the intent that they may returne into the waye of righteousnes: Graunte vnto all them that be admitted into the felowship of Christes religion, that they may exchewe those thinges that be contrarye to their profession, and folowe all suche thinges as bee agreable to thesame: through our Lorde Iesus Christe.
DErely beloued, beseche you as straungiers and pilgriemes, abstaine fro~ fleshly lustes, which fight against the soule: and see that ye haue honest conuersacion among the Gentiles, that where as they backbite you as euill doers, they may see youre good workes, and prayse God in the day of visitacion.
Submyt your selfes therfore, vnto all maner ordinaunce of man, for the Lordes sake, whether it bee vnto the kyng as vnto the chiefe head: either vnto rulers, as vnto them that are sent of him, for the punishment of euil doers, but for the laude of them that do well.
For so is the wil of God, that with well doing, ye may stop the mouthes of foolishe and ignoraunte men: as free, and not as hauyng the libertie for a cloke of maliciousnes, but euen as the seruauntes of God.
Honour all menne, loue brotherly felowship, feare God, honor the Kyng.
IE&sus sayed to his disciples: After a while ye shal not see me, and againe, after a while ye shall see me: for go to the father.
Then sayed some of his disciples betwene themselfes: what is this that he sayeth vnto vs, after a while ye shall not see me, and againe after a while ye shall see me, and that go to the father? They sayed therfore: what is this that he sayeth, after a while? We ca~not tell what he sayth.
Iesus perceyued that they would aske hym, and sayed vnto them: ye inquire of this betwene your selfes, because sayed, after a whyle ye shall not see me, and againe after a while ye shall see me.
Verely, verely, saye vnto you: ye shall wepe and lament: but contrary wyse, the worlde shall reioyce.
Ye shal sorowe, but your sorowe shalbe turned to ioy.
woman when she trauayleth, hath sorowe, because her houre is come.
But assone as she is deliuered of the childe, she remembreth no more the anguishe, for ioy that a manne is borne into the worlde.
And ye nowe therfore haue sorowe: but wyll see you againe, and your heartes shall reioyce, and youre ioy shall no manne take from you.
GOD standeth in the congregacion of princes: He is iudge emong Gods.
Howe long will ye geue wrong iudgement: and accept the persons of the vngodly? Defende the poore and fatherlesse: see that suche as bee in nede and necessitie haue right.
Deliuer the outcast and poore: Saue them from the hande of the vngodly.
They will not be learned nor vnderstande, but walke on still in darkenesse: all the foundacions of the earth be out of course.
haue sayed, ye are Gods: and ye all are children of the the moste highest.
But ye shall dye lyke men: and fal lyke one of the princes.
Arise, God, and iudge thou the earth: For thou shalt take all the Heathen to thyne inheritaunce.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
ALmightie God, whiche doest make the myndes of all faythfull menne to be of one wyll: graunte vnto thy people, that they maye loue the thyng, whiche thou commaundest, and desyre that whiche thou doest promes, that emong the sundery and manifolde chaunges of the worlde, our heartes may surely there be fixed, where as true ioyes are to be founde: Through Christe our Lorde.
EVery good gifte, and euery perfect gifte, is from aboue, commeth doune from the father of lightes, with whom is no variablenes, neither is he chau~ged vnto darkenes.
Of his owne will begate he vs, with the worde of trueth, that we shoulde be the firste fruites of his creatures.
Wherfore (dere brethren) let euery man be swift to heare, slowe to speake, slowe to wrathe.
For the wrathe of man worketh not that which is righteous before God.
Wherfore laye aparte all filthines, and superfluitie of maliciousnes, receiue with mekenes the word that is graffed in you, whiche is able to saue your soules.
IE&sus sayed vnto his disciples: nowe goe my way to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me whither goe.
But because haue sayed suche thynges vnto you, your heartes are full of sorow.
Neuertheles, tell you the truth: it is expedient for you, that go away.
For if go not away, that comforter will not come vnto you.
And when he is come, he will rebuke the worlde of sinne, and of righteousnes, and of iudgement.
Of synne, because they beleue not on me: Of righteousnes, because go to my father, and ye shall see me nomore: Of Iudgement, because the Prince of this worlde is iudged already.
haue yet many thinges to saye vnto you, but ye cannot beare them awaye nowe, howbeit when he is come (which is the spirite of trueth) he will leade you into all trueth.
He shall not speake of himselfe, but whatsoeuer he shall heare, that shall he speake, and he will shewe you thynges to come.
He shall glorifie me, for he shall receyue of myne, and shall shewe vnto you.
All thinges that the father hath, are mine: therfore sayed vnto you, that he shall take of mine, and shewe vnto you.
Howe amiable are thy dwellynges: Thou Lorde of Hostes? My soule hath a desyre and longing to entre into the courtes of the Lorde: My heart and my flesh reioyce in the lyuing God.
Yea, the Sparowe hath fou~d her an house, and the Swalow a nest where she may lay her young: Euen thy altares, Lorde of Hostes, my king and my God.
Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be alwaye praysing thee.
Blessed is that manne whose strength is in thee: In whose heart are thy wayes.
Whiche goyng through the vale of misery, vse it for a well: and the pooles are filled with water.
They will goe from strength to strength: and vnto the God of Gods appeareth euery one of them in Sion.
Lorde God of Hostes, heare my prayer: Hearken God of Iacob.
Behold, God, our defender: and loke vpon the face of thyne anoynted.
For one day in thy courtes: is better then a thousande.
had rather be a doore keper in the house of my God: then to dwell in the tentes of vngodlynes.
For the Lorde God is a light and defence: the Lorde will geue grace and worship, and no good thyng shall he withholde from them that liue a godly lyfe.
Lorde God of Hostes: blessed is the manne that putteth his trust in thee.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
LOrde, from whom all good thinges do come: graunt vs thy humble seruauntes, that by thy holy inspiracion, we may thinke those thinges that be good, and by thy mercifull guyding may perfourme thesame: thorowe our Lord Iesus Christe.
SE that ye bee doers of the worde, and not hearers only, deceyuing your owne selfes.
For yf any man heare the worde, and declareth not thesame by his workes, he is lyke vnto a man beholdyng his bodely face in a glasse.
For assone as he hath looked on himselfe, he goeth his waye, and forgetteth immediatly what his fashion was.
But whoso looketh in the perfecte lawe of libertie, and continueth therin (if he be not a forgetfull hearer, but a doer of the worke) thesame shalbe happy in his dede.
If any man emong you seme to be deuout, and refraineth not his tonge, but deceiueth his owne hearte, this mannes deuocion is in vaine.
Pure deuocion, and vndefiled before God the father, is this: to viset the fatherles and widowes, in their aduersitie, and to kepe hymselfe vnspotted of the worlde.
VErely, verely, saye vnto you: whatsoeuer ye shall aske the father in my name, he wyll geue it you.
Aske and ye shall receyue, that youre ioy may be full.
The tyme will come, when shall no more speake vnto you by prouerbes: but shall shewe you plainly from my father.
And saye not vnto you that wil speake vnto my father for you: For the father himselfe loueth you, because ye haue loued me, and haue beleued that came out from God.
went out from the father, and came into the world.
His disciples sayed vnto him: Loe, nowe talkest thou plainly, and speakest no Prouerbe.
Nowe are we sure that thou knowest all thinges, and nedest not that any manne should aske thee any questio~: therfore beleue we, that thou camest from God.
Beholde, the houre draweth nye, and is already come, that ye shalbe scattered euery manne to his owne, and shal leaue me alone.
And yet am not alone: for the father is with me.
These woordes haue spoken vnto you, that in me ye might haue peace, for in the worlde shall ye haue tribulacion: but be of good chere, haue ouercome the worlde.
Clap your handes together (all ye people:) sing vnto God with the voice of melody.
For the Lorde is hye and to be feared: He is the great king vpon all the earth.
He shall subdue the people vnder vs: And the nacions vnder our fete.
He shall chose out an heritage for vs: euen the worship of Iacob whom he loued.
God is gone vp with a mery noyse: And the Lorde with the sounde of the trompe.
syng prayses, syng prayses vnto oure God: syng prayses, syng prayses vnto our kyng.
For God is the king of all the earth: syng ye prayses with vnderstanding.
God reigneth ouer the heathen: God sitteth vpon hys holy seate.
The princes of the people are ioyned to the people of the God of Abraham: for God (whiche is very hye exalted) doeth defende the earth, as it were with a shylde.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
GRaunt we beseche thee almightie God, that lyke as we doe beleue thy onely begotten sonne our Lorde to haue ascended into the heauens: so we maye also in hearte and minde thither ascende, and with him continually dwell.
IN the former treatise (deare Theophilus) we haue spoken of all that Iesus began to doe and teache, vntil the day in which he was taken vp, after that he through the holy goste, had geuen commaundementes vnto the Apostles, whome he had chosen: to whome also he shewed himselfe aliue after his passion (and that by many tokens) appearyng vnto them .xl. dayes, and speakyng of the kingdom of God, and gathered them together, and commaunded them that they should not departe from Ierusalem: but to wayte for the promes of the father, wherof (sayeth he) ye haue heard of me.
For Iohn truely baptised with water: but ye shalbe baptised with the holy gost, after these fewe dayes.
When they therfore were come together, they asked of him, saying: lord, wilt thou at this time restore againe the kingdom to Israel? And he sayde vnto the~: it is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the father hath put in his owne power.
But ye shall receiue power after that the holy gost is come vpon you.
And ye shal bee witnesses vnto me, not onely in Ierusalem, but also in al Iewry, and in Samaria, euen vnto the worldes ende.
And when he had spoken these thinges, while they beheld, he was taken vp on hye, and a cloude receyued him vp out of their syght.
And while they looked stedfastly vp toward heauen as he wente, beholde, two men stoode by them in white apparell, whiche also sayed: ye men of Galile, why stande ye gasing vp into heauen? This same Iesus whiche is taken vp from you into heauen, shall so come, euen as ye haue seen him goe into heauen.
IE&sus appered vnto the eleuen as they sate at meate: cast in their teth their vnbelefe, hardnes of heart, because they beleued not them which had sene that he was risen again from the dead: he sayd vnto them: go ye into all the world, preache the gospel to all creatures: he that beleueth is baptised, shall be saued.
In my name they shall cast out deuils, they shall speake with newe tonges, they shall dryue away serpentes.
And if they drinke any deadly thing it shall not hurte them.
They shall laye their handes on the sicke, and they shall recouer.
So then when the Lord had spoken vnto the~: he was receiued into heauen, and is on the right hande of God.
And they wente furth, and preached euery where: The Lord working with them, and confirming the worde with miracles folowing.
THe Lord is king, and hath put on gloryous apparell: the Lord hath put on his apparel, and girded himselfe with strength.
He hath made the rounde worlde so sure: that it cannot be moued.
Euer sence the worlde beganne, hath thy seate been prepared: thou art from euerlasting.
The fluddes are risen, Lorde, the fluddes haue lyfte vp theyr noyse: the fluddes lyft vp theyr waues.
The waues of the sea are mightie, and rage horribly: but yet the Lorde that dwelleth on hygh is mightier.
Thy testimonies, Lorde, are very sure: holynesse becommeth thine house for euer.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
God, the king of glory, whiche haste exalted thine only sonne Iesus Christe, with great triumphe vnto thy kingdom in heauen: we beseche thee leaue vs not comfortles, but sende to vs thine holy gost to comforte vs, and exalte vs vnto thesame place, whither our sauiour Christe is gone before: who lyueth and reigneth. &c.
THe ende of all thinges is at hande: be ye therfore sobre, and watche vnto praier.
But aboue all thinges haue feruent loue among your selues: for loue shall couer the multitude of synnes.
As euery man hath receiued the gift, euen so minister thesame one to another, as good ministers of the manifold grace of God.
If any man speake, let hym talke as the wordes of God.
If any manne minister, let him do it as of the habilitie whiche God ministreth vnto hym: that God in all thinges may be gloryfied through Iesus Christe: to whome be prayse and dominion for euer and euer.
WHen the comforter is come whom will sende vnto you from the father (euen the spirite of trueth, whiche procedeth of the father) he shall testifye of me.
And ye shall beare witnes also, because ye haue been with me from the beginning.
These thinges haue sayd vnto you, because ye should not bee offended.
They shall excommunicate you: yea the time shal come, that whosoeuer killeth you, wil thinke that he doeth God seruice.
And suche thinges will they do vnto you, because they haue not knowen the father, neither yet me.
But these thinges haue told you, that whan the tyme is come, ye maye remembre then that tolde you.
These thinges sayde not vnto you at the beginning, because was present with you.
REioyce in the Lorde, ye righteous: for it becommeth well the iust to be thankfull.
Prayse the Lorde, with harpe: syng psalmes vnto hym with the lute and instrument of tenne stringes.
Syng vnto the Lorde a newe song: sing prayses lustely (vnto hym) with a good courage.
For the worde of the Lorde is true: and all his workes are faythfull.
He loueth righteousnes and iudgement: the earth is full of the goodnes of the Lorde.
By the worde of the Lorde were the heauens made: and all the hostes of them, by the breath of his mouth.
He gathereth the waters of the sea together, as it were vpon a heap: and layeth vp the depe as it were in a treasure house.
Let all the earth feare the Lorde: stande in awe of hym all ye that dwell in the worlde.
For he spake and it was done: he commaunded and it stoode faste.
The Lorde bringeth the counsayll of the heathen to nought: and maketh the deuises of the people to be of none effect (and casteth out the counsayles of princes.)
The counsaill of the Lorde shall endure for euer: and the thoughtes of his heart from generacion to generacion.
Blessed are the people whose God is the Lorde Iehouah: and blessed are the folke that haue chosen hym to bee theyr inheritaunce.
The Lorde loked downe from heauen, and beheld all the children of menne: from the habitacion of his dwellyng, he considereth all them that dwell in the earth.
He fashioneth all the heartes of them: and vnderstandeth all theyr workes.
There is no king that can be saued by the multitude of an hoste: neyther is any myghtie man delyuered by muche strength.
horse is counted but a vayne thing to saue a man: neither shall he deliuer any man by his great strength.
Beholde, the iye of the Lorde is vpon them that feare him: and vpon them that put theyr trust in his mercy.
To deliuer theyr soules from death: and to feade them in the tyme of derth.
Our soule hath paciently taryed for the Lorde: for he is our helpe and our shielde.
For our heart shal reioyce in him: because we haue hoped in his holy name.
Let thy mercifull kyndenes, Lord, be vpon vs: lyke as we haue put our trust in thee.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
GOd, which as vpon this daye haste taught the heartes of thy faithfull people, by the sending to them the light of thy holy spirite: Graunt vs by thesame spirite to haue a ryght iudgement in all thynges, and euermore to reioyce in his holy coumforte, through the merites of Christe Iesus our sauiour: who liueth and reigneth with thee in the vnitie of thesame spirite one God, worlde without ende.
WHen the fiftie dayes were come to an ende, they were all with one accorde together in one place.
And sodenly there came a sounde from heauen, as it had been the comming of a mighty winde, and it filled all the house where they sate.
And there appered vnto the~ clouen tonges, lyke as they had been of fyre, and it sate vpon eche one of them: and they were al filled with the holy gost, and began to speake with other tonges, euen as thesame spirite gaue them vtteraunce.
There were dwellyng at Ierusalem Iewes, deuoute men, out of euery nacion of them that are vnder heauen.
When this was noised about, the multitude came together and were astonied, because that euery man heard the~ speake with his owne language.
They wondred all merueiled, saying among themselfes: beholde, are not all these, whiche speake, of Galile? And howe heare we euery man his owne tong, wherin we were borne? Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the inhabiters of Mesopotamia, and of Iewry, of Capadocia, of Pontus and Asia, Phrigia and Pamphilia, of Egipte and of the parties of Libia, whiche is besyde Siren, and straungers of Rome, Iewes and Proselites, Grekes and Arrabians, we haue heard them speake in our owne tongues the great workes of God.
IE&sus sayde vnto his disciples: If ye loue me, kepe my commaundementes, and wil pray the father, he shall geue you an other comforter, that he maye abyde with you for euer: euen the spirite of trueth, whome the worlde canne not receyue, because the worlde seeth hym not, neyther knoweth hym.
But ye knowe hym: for he dwelleth with you, and shalbe in you.
will not leaue you comfortles: but wyll come to you.
Yet a lytle whyle and the worlde seeth me no more: but ye see me.
That daye shall ye knowe that am in my father, and you in me, and in you.
He that hathe my commaundementes and kepeth them, thesame is he that loueth me.
And he that loueth me, shalbe loued of my father: and will loue him, and will shewe myne owne selfe vnto hym.
It fortuned when Apollo wente to Corinthum. vnto After these thinges.
It fortuned when Apollo wente to Corinthum. vnto After these thinges.
Be ioyfull in the Lorde (all ye landes: serue the Lorde with gladnesse, and come before his presence with a song.
Be ye sure that the Lorde he is God: it is he that hath made vs, and not we oure selfes, we are his people and the sheepe of his pasture.
Goe your waye into his gates with thankesgeuyng, and into his courtes with prayse: be thankefull vnto hym, and speake good of his name.
For the Lorde is gracious, his mercy is euerlastyng: and his trueth endureth from generacion to generacion.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
THen Peter opened his mouth and sayd: of a trueth perceyue that there is no respecte of persones with God, but in all people, he that feareth hym, and worketh righteousnes, is accepted with him.
Ye know the preaching that God sente vnto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Iesu Christe, whiche is Lorde ouer all thynges: whiche preaching was published throughout all Iewry (and beganne in Galile after the baptisme whiche Iohn preached) howe God annointed Iesus of Nazareth with the holy goste, and with power.
Whiche Iesus wente about, doyng good, and healyng all that were oppressed of the deuill.
And we are witnesses of all thinges whiche he did in the lande of the Iewes and at Ierusalem, whome they slewe and hanged on tree: Hym God raysed vp the thirde day, and shewed him openly, not to all the people, but vnto vs witnesses (chosen before of God for thesame entente) which did eate and drinke with hym, after he arose from death.
And he commaunded vs to preache vnto the people, and to testifie that it is he, whiche was ordayned of God to be the iudge of quicke and dead.
To hym geue all the Prophetes witnesse, that through his name whosoeuer beleueth in hym, shal receiue remission of synnes.
Whyle Peter yet spake these wordes, the holy gost fell on all them whiche heard the preaching.
And they of the circumcisio~ which beleued, were astonied, as many as came with Peter, because that on the gentiles also, was shedde out the gifte of the holy gost.
Then aunswered Peter: can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptised whiche haue receyued the holy gost as well as we? And he commaunded them to be baptised in the name of the Lorde.
SO God loued the worlde, that he gaue his only begotten so~ne, that whosoeuer beleueth in him, should not perishe, but haue euerlasting lyfe.
For God sent not his sonne into the worlde, to condemne the worlde, but that the worlde through him myght be saued.
But he that beleueth not, is condemned already, because he hath not beleued in the name of the onely begotten sonne of God.
And this is the condemnacion: that lyght is come into the worlde, and men loued darkenes more then lyght, because theyr dedes were euill.
For euery one that euill doeth, hateth the light, neyther cummeth to the light, leste his dedes should be reproued.
But he that doeth trueth, cummeth to the light, that his dedes may be knowen, howe that they are wrought in God.
MY song shall be of mercye and iudgemente: vnto thee (O Lorde) will syng.
When wilt thou come vnto me? wyll walke in my house with a perfect heart.
will take no wicked thing in hande: hate the sinnes of vnfaythfulnes, there shall no suche cleaue vnto me.
frowarde heart shall departe from me: wyll not knowe a wicked person.
Whoso hath also a proude looke, and an hie stomake: will not suffre him.
Myne iyes looke vnto suche as be faythfull in the lande: that they may dwell with me.
There shall no deceitfull person dwell in my house: he that telleth lyes shall not tarye in my syght.
shal soone destroy al the vngodly that are in the lande: that may roote out all wicked doers from the citie of the Lorde.
WHen the Apostles whiche were at Ierusalem hearde saye, that Samaria had receyued the word of God, they sent vnto them Peter and Iohn.
Which, when they were come downe, praied for the~, that they myght receyue the holy gost.
For as yet he was come on none of them: but they were baptised onely in the name of Christ Iesu.
The~ layde they theyr handes on them, they receyued the holy goste.
VErely, verely, say vnto you: he that entreth not in by the doore into the shepefold, but climeth vp some other waye, thesame is a thefe, and a murtherer.
But he that entreth in by the doore, is the shepheard of the shepe: To him the porter openeth, and the shepe heare his voyce, and he calleth his owne shepe by name, and leadeth them out.
And when he hath sent furthe his owne shepe, he goeth before them, and the shepe folow him: for they knowe his voyce.
straunger will they not folowe, but will flye from him: for they knowe not the voyce of straungers.
This prouerbe spake Iesus vnto them, but they vnderstoode not what thynges they were whiche he spake vnto them.
Then sayed Iesus vnto them agayne: verely, verely, saye vnto you: am the doore of the shepe.
All (eue~ as many as came before me) are theues and murtherers, but the shepe dyd not heare them.
am the doore, by me yf any enter in, he shalbe safe, and shal goe in and out, and fynde pasture.
thefe cummeth not but for to steale, kill, and destroy.
am come that they myght haue lyfe, that they myght haue it more aboundauntly.
GOd be mercifull vnto vs, and blesse vs: and shewe vs the lyght of his countenaunce, and be mercifull vnto vs. That thy way may be knowen vpon earth: thy sauing health among all nacions.
Let the people prayse the, God: yea let all the people prayse thee.
let nacions reioyce be glad: for thou shalt iudge the folke righteously, and gouerne the nacions vpo~ earth.
Let the people prayse thee, God: let all the people prayse thee.
Then shall the earth bryng forth her increase: and God, euen our owne God, shall geue vs his blessyng.
God shall blesse vs: and all the endes of the world shall feare hym.
ALmighty and euerlastyng god, which haste geuen vnto vs thy seruauntes grace by the confession of a true fayth to acknowlege the glory of the eternal trinitie, and in the power of the diuyne maiestie to wurship the vnitie: we beseche thee that through the stedfastnes of this fayth, we may euermore be defended from all aduersitie: whiche liuest and reignest one God, worlde with out ende.
AFter this looked, and behold, a doore was open in heauen, the firste voice which heard, was as it were of a tro~pet, talking with me, which sayd: come vp hither, and wyll shewe thee thinges which must be fulfilled hereafter.
And immediatly was in the spirite: And behold, a seate was sette in heauen, and one sate on the seate.
And he that sate, was to looke vpon, lyke vnto a Iasper stone, and a Sardyne stone.
And there was a rayne bowe about the seate, in sight lyke vnto an Emeraulde.
Elders sitting, clothed in white rayment, and had on their heades crownes of golde.
And out of the seate proceded lyghtnynges, and thunderynges, and voyces, there were vii. lampes of fyre, burnyng before the seate, whiche are the .vii. spirites of God.
And before the seate there was a sea of glasse lyke vnto Christall, and in the myddes of the seate, and rounde about the seate, were .iiii. beastes full of iyes, before and behynde.
And the fyrste beaste was lyke a Lyon: and the second beast lyke a calfe: and the third beast had a face as a man: and the fourth beast was lyke a flying Egle.
And the .iiii. beastes had eche one of them syxe wynges about him, and they were ful of iyes within.
And they had no rest day neyther night, saying: Holy, holy, holy, Lord God almighty, which was, and is, and is to come.
And when those beastes gaue glorye and honour, and thankes to hym that sate on the seate (whiche lyueth for euer and euer) the .xxiiii. elders fell downe before hym that sate on the throne, and worshypped hym that lyueth for euer, and cast their crounes before the throne, saying: thou art worthy, Lord (our God) to receiue glory, and honor, and power, for thou haste created all thinges, and for thy willes sake they are, and were created.
THere was a manne of the Phariseis named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Iewes.
Thesame came to Iesus by nyght, sayd vnto him: Rabby, we know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no ma~ could doe suche miracles as thou doest, excepte God were with him.
Iesus answered, and sayd vnto him: Verely, verely, saye vnto thee: except a man be borne from aboue, he cannot see the kingdome of God.
Nicodemus sayed vnto him: howe can a man be borne when he is olde? can he enter into his mothers wombe and bee borne agayne? Iesus answered: verely, verely, say vnto thee: except a man be borne of water, and of the spirite, he cannot entre into the kyngdome of God.
That whiche is borne of the fleshe, is fleshe, and that whiche is borne of the spirite, is spirite, Maruayle not thou that sayed to thee, ye must bee borne from aboue.
The wynde bloweth where it lusteth, thou hearest the sounde therof, but canst not tell whence it commeth and whither it goeth: So is euery one that is borne of the spirite.
Nicodemus answered, and sayed vnto hym: howe can these thinges be? Iesus answered, and sayd vnto him: art thou a maister in Israel, and knowest not these thinges.
Verely, verely say vnto thee: we speake that we do knowe, and testifie that we haue seen: and ye receyue not our witnes.
If haue told you yearthly thinges, and ye beleue not: howe shall ye beleue yf tell you of heauenly thynges? And no manne ascendeth vp to heauen, but he that came downe from heauen, euen the sonne of manne whiche is in heauen.
And as Moses lift vp the serpent in the wildernes, euen so muste the Sonne of man be lift vp, that whosoeuer beleueth in hym, perishe not, but haue euerlasting lyfe.
BLe&s&sed are those that be vndefiled in the way: and walke in the lawe of the Lorde.
Blessed are they that kepe his testimonies: and seke him with theyr whole heart.
For they which do no wickednes: walke in his wayes.
Thou haste charged, that we shall diligentlye kepe thy commaundementes: that my wayes were made so direct, that myght kepe thy statutes.
So shall not be confounded: while haue respect vnto all thy commaundementes.
will thanke thee with an vnfayned heart: when shall haue learned the iudgementes of thy ryghteousnes.
GOd the strength of all them that truste in thee, mercyfully accepte our prayers: And because the weakenes of our mortall nature can do no good thing without thee, graunte vs the helpe of thy grace, that in kepyng of thy commaundementes, we may please thee bothe in will and dede: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
DEarely beloued, let vs loue one another: for loue commeth of God.
And euery one that loueth is borne of God, and knoweth God.
He that loueth not, knoweth not God: for God is loue.
In this appeared the loue of God to vs ward, because that God sent his onlye begotten sonne into the worlde, that we myght lyue through him.
Herein is loue, not that we loued God, but that he loued vs, sent his sonne to be the agreme~t for our synnes.
Dearely beloued, if God so loued vs, we ought also to loue one another.
If we loue one another, God dwelleth in vs and his loue is perfecte in vs. Hereby knowe we that we dwell in hym and he in vs: because he hathe geuen vs of his spirite.
And we haue seen, and do testifie, that the father sent the sonne to be the sauiour of the worlde: whosoeuer confesseth that Iesus is the sonne of God, in him dwelleth God, and he in God.
And we haue knowen beleued the loue that God hath to vs. God is loue, he that dwelleth in loue, dwelleth in God, and God in him.
Herein is the loue perfect in vs, that we should haue truste in the day of iudgeme~t.
For as he is, euen so are we in this world.
There is no feare in loue, but perfect loue casteth out feare: for feare hath painefulnes.
If a man saye: loue God, yet hate his brother, he is a lyar.
For howe canne he that loueth not hys brother, whom he hath seen, loue God whome he hath not seen? And this commaundement haue we of him: that he whiche loueth God, should loue his brother also.
THere was a certaine riche man, whiche was clothed in purple and fyne white, fared deliciously euery day: And there was a certaine begger, named Lazarus, which lay at his gate full of sores, desiring to bee refreshed with the crummes which fel from the ryche mannes borde, and no man gaue vnto hym.
And it fortuned, that the begger dyed, and was caried by the Angels into Abrahams bosome.
And being in hell in tormentes, he lift vp his iyes sawe Abraham a farre of, and Lazarus in his bosome, and he cryed sayd: father Abraham, haue mercy on me: and send Lazarus, that he may dippe the tippe of his finger in water, and coole my tonge, for am tormented in this flame.
But Abraham sayed: Sonne, remembre that thou in thy lyfe tyme, receiuedst thy pleasure: contraryewise, Lazarus receiued payne: But nowe is he comforted and thou art punnished.
Beyond all this, betwene vs and you there is a great space set, so that they which would go fro~ hence to you cannot: neither may come from thence to vs Then he sayd: pray thee therfore father, sende hym to my fathers house (for haue fyue brethren) for to warne them, leste they also come into this place of torme~t.
Abraha~ sayd vnto him: they haue Moses and the Prophetes, let them heare them.
And he sayd: nay father Abraham, but if one come vnto them from the dead, they will repent.
He sayd vnto him: If thei heare not Moses and the Prophetes, neither will they beleue, though one rose from death agayne.
WHerwithal shal a yong man clense his waye? euen by ruling himselfe after thy worde.
With my whole heart haue sought thee: let me not goe wrong out of thy commaundementes.
Thy wordes haue hyd within my heart: that should not sinne against thee.
With my lippes haue been tellyng: of all the iudgementes of thy mouthe.
haue had as great delite in the way of thy testimonies: as in all maner of ryches.
will talke of thy commaundementes: and haue respect vnto thy wayes.
My delite shalbe in thy statutes: and will not forget thy worde.
LOrde make vs to haue a perpetuall feare and loue of thy holy name: for thou neuer failest to helpe and gouerne them, whome thou doest bring vp in thy stedfast loue: Graunt this. &c.
We knowe that we are translated from death vnto lyfe, because we loue the brethren.
And ye know that no manslear hathe eternall lyfe abydyng in him.
Hereby perceyue we loue, because he gaue his lyfe for vs: and we ought to geue our lyues for the brethren.
But whoso hathe this worldes good, and seeth his brother haue nede, and shutteth vp his compassion from him: howe dwelleth the loue of God in him? My babes let vs not loue in worde, neither in tonge: but in dede and in veritie.
Hereby we knowe that we are of the veritie, and canne quiet oure heartes before hym.
For yf oure heart condemne vs, God is greater then our heart, and knoweth al thinges.
Derely beloued, if our heart condemne vs not, then haue we trust to Godwarde: and whatsoeuer we aske, we receyue of hym, because we kepe his commaundementes, and doe those thinges which are pleasaunte in his sight.
And this is his commaundement, that we beleue on the name of his sonne Iesus Christ, and loue one another as he gaue commaundement.
And he that kepeth hys commaundementes, dwelleth in him, and he in him: and hereby we knowe that he abydeth in vs, euen by the spirite whiche he hath geuen vs.
Certaine man ordayned a great supper, bade many, and sent his seruaunt at supper time, to saye to them that were bidden, come: for all thinges are now ready.
The first sayd vnto him: haue bought a farme, must nedes go and see it, pray thee haue me excused.
And another sayed: haue bought v. yoke of Oxen, and go to proue them, pray thee haue me excused.
And an other sayd: haue maried a wyfe, and therfore cannot come.
And the seruaunte returned and brought his maister woorde agayne therof.
Then was the good manne of the house displeased, and sayed to his seruaunt: goe out quickely into the stretes and quarters of the citie, and bring in hither the poore, and the feble, and the halte, and the blinde.
And the seruaunte sayde: Lorde it is doone as thou hast co~maunded, yet there is roume.
And the Lord sayd to the seruaunt: goe out vnto the hye wayes and hedges, and compell them to come in, that my house may be filled.
For saye vnto you, that none of those men which were bidden, shall taste of my supper.
Doe wel vnto thy seruaunt: that may liue and kepe thy woorde.
Open thou myne eyes: that may se the wunderous thinges of thy lawe.
am a straunger vpon yearthe: hyde not thy commaundementes from me.
My soule breaketh out for the very feruent desyre: that it hath alway vnto thy iudgementes.
Thou hast rebuked the proude: and cursed are they that doe erre from thy commaundementes.
turne from me shame and rebuke: for haue kept thy testimonies.
Princes also did sit and speake againste me: but thy seruaunt is occupyed in thy statutes.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy goste.
As it was in the beginnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
LOrde, we beseche thee mercifully to heare vs, and vnto whome thou hast geuen an heartie desyre to pray: grau~t that by thy mightie ayde we may be defended: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
SVbmit your selues euery man one to an other, knit youre selues together in lowlinesse of mynde.
For God resysteth the proude, and geueth grace to the humble.
Submit your selues therfore vnder the myghtie hand of god, that he may exalt you when the time is come.
Cast al your care vpon him: for he careth for you.
Be sober, and watche: for your aduersary the deuil, as a roaring Lyon, walketh about, seeking whome he may deuour: whome resiste stedfast in the fayth, knowing that the same afflyccions are appoynted vnto youre brethren, that are in the worlde.
But the God of all grace which hath called vs vnto his eternall glory by Christ Iesu, shall his owne selfe (after that ye haue suffered a litle affliccion) make you perfect, settle, strengthe, and stablyshe you.
To hym bee glory and dominion for euer and euer.
THen resorted vnto him, all the Publicanes sinners for to heare him.
But he put furth thys parable vnto them, saying: What man among you hauing an hundreth shepe (if he lose one of them) doth not leaue nintie and nine in the wildernes, and goeth after that whiche is lost, vntill he fynde it? And when he hath found it, he layeth it on his shoulders with ioye.
And assone as he cu~meth home he calleth together hys louers and neighbours, saying vnto the~: Reioyce with me, for haue founde my shepe, which was lost.
say vnto you, that likewise ioy shalbe in heauen ouer one synner that repenteth, more then ouer nintye and nine iust persons, which nede no repentaunce.
Either what woman hauing ten grotes (if she lose one) doeth not light a candle, and swepe the house, and seke diligently till she find it? And when she hath founde it, she calleth her louers and her neighbours together, saying: Reioyce with me, for haue founde the grote which had lost.
Likewise, saye vnto you, shall there be ioye in the presence of the Aungels of god, ouer one sinner that repenteth.
MY soule cleaueth to the dust: quicke~ thou me accordyng to thy woorde.
haue knowledged my wayes, and thou heardest me: teache me thy statutes.
Make me to vnderstande the waye of thy commau~dementes: so shal talke of thy wonderous workes.
My soule melteth away for very heauines: comfort thou me according vnto thy woorde.
Take from me the waye of lying: and cause thou me to make muche of thy lawe.
haue chosen the way of trueth: and thy iudgementes haue layde before me.
will runne the waye of thy commaundementes: when thou hast set my heart at libertie.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
GOd, the Protector of all that truste in thee, withoute whome nothing is strong, nothyng is holye: increase and multiply vpon vs thy mercy, that thou being our ruler and guide, we may so passe through thinges temporal, that we finally loose not the thynges eternall: Graunt this heauenly father, for Iesu Christes sake our Lorde.
Suppose that the affliccio~s of this life, are not worthye of the glory which shalbe shewed vpon vs.
For the feruent desyre of the creature abideth, loking when the sonnes of god shal appeare, because the creature is subdued to vanitie against the will therof, but for his will which hath subdued the same in hope.
For the same creature shalbe deliuered from the bo~dage of corrupcion, into the glorious libertie of the sonnes of GOD.
For we knowe that euery creature groneth with vs also, and trauayleth in payne, euen vnto thys tyme: not onely it, but we also whiche haue the first fruites of the spirite, mourne in our selues also, waite for the adopcion (of the children of GOD) euen the deliueraunce of our bodies.
Iudge not ye shal not be iudged: co~demne not, ye shal not be condemned.
Geue and it shalbee geuen vnto you, good measure and pressed downe, and shake~ together, and running ouer, shall men geue into your bosomes.
For with the same measure that ye mete withal, shal other men mete to you agayne.
Can the blynd leade the blynd? doe they not both fall into the diche? The disciple is not aboue his maister: Euery ma~ shal bee perfect, euen as his Maister is.
Why seest thou a mote in thy brothers eye, but co~siderest not the beame that is in thine owne eye? Either how canst thou say to thy brother? Brother, let me pul out the mote that is in thyne eye, when thou seeste not the beame that is in thyne owne eye.
Thou ypocrite, caste out the beame out of thyne owne eye firste, and then shalt thou see perfectly to pull out the mote that is in thy brothers eye.
TEache me, Lorde, the waye of thy statutes: and shall kepe it vnto the ende.
Geue me vnderstandyng, and shall kepe thy lawe: yea, shal kepe it with my whole hearte.
Make me to goe in the path of thy commaundementes: for therin is my desyre.
Encline my heart vnto thy testimonies: and not to couetousnes.
turne away myne eyes, lest they beholde vanitie: and quicken thou me in thy way.
stablish thy worde in thy seruaunt: that may feare thee.
Take away the rebuke that am afrayd of: for thy iudgementes are good.
Beholde, my delite is in thy commaundementes: quicken me in thy righteousnes.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
GRaunte Lorde, we beseche thee, that the course of thys world may be so peaceably ordred by thy gouernaunce: that thy congregacion may ioyfully serue thee in all godly quietnes: through Iesus Christ our lorde.
BE you all of one mynde, and of one heart, loue as brethren, be pitifull, bee courteous (meke) not rendring euill for euill, or rebuke for rebuke: but contrariewise blesse, knowing that ye are therunto called, euen that ye shoulde bee heyres of the blessyng.
For he that doth long after lyfe, and loueth to see good daies, let him refrayne his tongue from euil, and his lippes that they speake no guile.
Let him eschewe euill and dooe good: let him seeke peace and ensue it.
For the eyes of the Lorde are ouer the righteous, and his eares are open vnto theyr prayers.
Agayne, the face of the lord is ouer them that doe euill.
Moreouer, who is it that will harme you, if ye folowe that whiche is good? yea, happie are ye if any trouble happen vnto you for ryghteousnes sake.
Be not ye afrayde for any terrour of them, neyther bee ye troubled, but sanctifye the Lorde God in your heartes.
IT came to passe that (when the people preased vpon hym, to heare the woorde of God) he stode by the lake of Genazareth, and saw two shippes stande by the lakes syde, but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing theyr nettes.
And he entred into one of the shippes (which perteined to Simon) and prayed him, that he woulde thrust out a litle from the land.
And he sate down taught the people out of the ship.
When he had left speaking, he sayde vnto Simon: launche out into the depe, let slip your nettes to make a draught.
And Simon aunswered, and sayde vnto him: Maister, we haue labored al night, and haue taken nothyng.
And when they had this done, they inclosed a great multitude of fishes.
But theyr nette brake, and they beckened to theyr felowes (whiche were in the other ship) that they shoulde come and helpe them.
And they came and fylled bothe the shippes, that they sonke agayn.
When Simon Peter sawe this, he fell downe at Iesus knees, saying: Lorde, goe from me, for am a sinful man.
For he was astonied and al that were with him, at the draught of fishes which they had taken: so was also Iames and Iohn the sonnes of Zebede, which were parteners with Simon.
And Iesus sayde vnto Simon: feare not, from hencefoorthe thou shalte catche men.
And they brought the shippes to lande, and forsooke all and folowed him.
LEt thy louing mercy come also vnto me, lorde: euen thy saluacion, according vnto thy woorde.
So shall make aunswere vnto my blasphemers: for my trust is in thy woorde.
take not the woord of trueth vtterly out of my mouth: for my hope is in thy iudgementes.
So shall alway kepe thy lawe: yea, for euer and euer.
will speake of thy testimonies also, euen before kinges: and will not be ashamed.
And my delight shalbe in thy commaundementes: which haue loued.
My handes also will lyfte vp, vnto thy commaundementes which haue loued: and my study shall bee in thy statutes.
GOd, whiche hast prepared to them that loue thee, suche good thinges as passe al mans vnderstanding: Powre into our heartes such loue toward thee, that we loui~g thee in all thinges, may obteyne thy promises, whiche excede al that we can desyre: Through Iesus Christe our Lord.
KNowe ye not, that all wee whiche are baptised in Iesu Christe, are baptised to dye with him? We are buried then with hym by baptisme for to dye: that lykewise as Christe was raysed from deathe, by the glory of the father, euen so we also shoulde walke in a newe lyfe.
For if we bee graft in deathe lyke vnto him: euen so shall we bee partakers of the resurreccion: Knowyng thys, that our olde manne is crucifyed with him also, that the body of sinne, might vtterly be destroyed, that he~cefurth we should not be seruau~tes vnto sinne.
Wherfore, yf we be dead with Christe, we beleue that we shal also liue with him, knowing that Christ being raysed from deathe, dyeth no more.
For as touching that he died, he died concerning sinne once.
And as touchyng that he lyueth, he liueth vnto god: Lykewyse consider ye also, that ye are dead, as touchyng synne, but are alyue vnto God, through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
IE&sus sayd vnto hys disciples: excepte your ryghteousnes excede the righteousnes of the Scribes and Phariseis, ye cannot entre into the kingdom of heauen.
Ye haue hearde that it was sayed vnto them of the olde tyme.
Thou shalte not kill: whosoeuer kylleth, shal be in daunger of iudgemente.
But saye vnto you: that whosoeuer is angrye with his brother (vnaduysedlye) shall be in daunger iudgemente.
And whosoeuer saye vnto hys brother, Racha, shall be in dau~ger of a cou~sel.
But whosoeuer saith, thou foole shalbe in dau~ger of hel fier.
Therfore, if thou offerest thy gifte at the altare, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leaue there thyne offryng before the alter, and goe thy waye firste, and be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gifte.
Agree with thyne aduersary quickely, whiles thou art in the way with him, leste at any tyme the aduersary delyuer thee to the iudge, and the iudge delyuer thee to the minister, and then thou be cast into prieson.
Verely say vnto thee: thou shalt not come out thence, til thou haue payed the vttermost farthing.
Thinke vpo~ thy seruaunte, as concerning thy word: wherein thou hast caused me to put my trust.
The same is my coumfort in my trouble: for thy woorde hath quickened me.
The proude haue had me excedingly in derion: yet haue not shrynked from thy lawe.
am horribly afrayde: for the vngodly, that forsake thy lawe.
Thy statutes haue bene my songes: in the house of my pilgrimage.
haue thought vpon thy name, Lorde, in the night season: and haue kept thy lawe.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy goste.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer shalbee: worlde without ende.
LOrde of al power and might, which art the author and geuer of al good thinges: graffe in our heartes the loue of thy name, increase in vs true religion, nouryshe vs with all goodnesse, and of thy great mercy, kepe vs in the same: Through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
As ye haue geuen youre members seruauntes to vnclennesse, and to iniquitye (from one inquitye to an other:) euen so nowe geue ouer your membres seruauntes vnto ryghteousenes, that ye may be sanctifyed.
For when ye were the seruauntes of sinne, ye were void of righteousnes.
What fruite had you the~ in those thinges, wherof ye are now ashamed? for the ende of those thynges is death.
But nowe are ye deliuered from synne, and made the seruauntes of God, and haue your fruite to be sanctifyed, and the ende euerlastyng lyfe.
For the rewarde of synne is death: but eternall lyfe is the gifte of God: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
IN those dayes, when there was a very great companye, and had nothyng to eate: Iesus called hys Disciples vnto hym, and sayde vnto them: haue compassion on the people, because they haue nowe bene with me three dayes, and haue nothyng to eate: And if sende them awaye fastyng to theyr owne howses, they shall faynt by the way: for diuerse of them came from farre.
And his disciples aunswered him: where shoulde a manne haue bread here in the wildernes, to satysfye these? And he asked them, how many loaues haue ye? They sayde, seuen.
And he co~maunded the people to sit downe on the ground.
And he tooke the seuen loaues: And when he had geuen thankes, he brake and gaue to hys disciples, to sette before them.
And when he had blessed, he commaunded them also to be set before them.
And they tooke vp of the broken meate that was left, seuen baskettes full.
THou arte my porcyon, Lorde: haue promised to kepe thy lawe.
made mine humble peticion in thy presence with my whole heart: be mercifull vnto me, accordyng vnto thy woorde.
cal mine owne waies to remembraunce: and turne my feete into thy testimonies.
made haste: and prolonged not the tyme to keepe thy commaundementes.
The congregacions of the vngodly haue robbed me: but haue not forgotten thy lawe.
At midnight will ryse, to geue thankes vnto thee: because of thy righteous iudgementes.
am a companyon of all them that feare thee: and kepe thy commaundementes.
The earth, Lorde, is full of thy mercie: teache me thy statutes.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: world without ende.
GOd, whose prouide~ce is neuer deceiued, we humbly beseche thee, that thou wilt put away from vs all hurtful thinges, and geue those thinges which be profitable for vs: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
BRethren, we are debters, not to the fleshe, to liue after the flesh.
For if ye liue after ye flesh, ye shal dye.
But if ye through the spirite doe mortifye the deedes of the body, ye shall liue For as many as are led by the spirite of god, they are the sonnes of God.
For ye haue not receyued the spirite of bondage to feare any more, but ye haue receyued the spirite of adopcion, wherby we crie: Abba father.
The same spirite certifieth our spirite, that we are the sonnes of God.
If we be sonnes, then are we also heires, the heires meane of god, heyres annexed with Christ: if so be that we suffre with hym, that we may bee also glorifyed together with hym.
BEware of false Prophetes, whiche come to you in shepes clothing, but inwardly they are rauening wolues.
Do men gather Grapes of thornes? Or Figges of Thystles? Euen so euerye good tree bryngeth furth good fruites: But a corrupte tree, bringeth furth euill fruites.
good tree can not bryng furth bad fruites: neyther can a bad tree bryng furth good fruites.
Euerye tree that bryngeth not furth good fruite, is hewen downe and caste into the fyer.
Not euery one that sayeth vnto me, Lorde Lord, shall entre into the kyngdome of heauen: but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heauen, he shall entre into the kingdome of heauen.
Lord, thou hast delt graciously with thy seruaunt, according vnto thy woorde.
learne me true vnderstandyng, and knoweledge: for haue beleued thy commaundementes.
Before was troubled went wrong: but nowe haue kept thy woorde.
The proude haue imagined a lye agaynst me: but wil kepe thy commaundementes with my whole heart.
Theyr hearte is as fatte as braune: but my delyte hath bene in thy lawe.
It is good for me that haue beene in trouble: That may learne thy statutes.
The lawe of thy mouthe is dearer vnto me: then thousandes of golde and siluer.
Glory be to the father, to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: world without ende.
GRaunt to vs lord, we beseche thee, the spirite to thinke, and dooe alwayes suche thynges as bee ryghtfull: that we, whiche cannot be without thee, may by thee be hable to lyue accordyng to thy will: Through Iesus Christe oure Lorde.
BRethren, would not that ye should be ignoraunt, how that our fathers were all vnder the cloude, all passed through the sea, and were al baptised vnder Moses in the cloude, in the sea, and did all eate of one spirituall meate, dyd all drynke of one spirituall drynke.
And they dranke of the spirituall rocke that folowed them, whiche Rocke was Christ.
These are ensaumples to vs, that we should not lust after euil thinges, as they lusted.
And that ye should not be worshippers of ymages, as were some of them, accordyng as it is written: The people sate downe to eate, and drynke, and rose vp to playe.
Neyther let vs bee defyled with fornycacion, as some of them were defyled with fornicacion, and fel in one daye three and twentie thousande.
Neyther lette vs tempt Christ, as some of them tempted, and were destroyed of serpentes.
Neyther murmure ye, as some of them murmured, were destroyed of the destroyer.
All these thynges happened vnto them for ensaumples: But are written to put vs in remembraunce, whome the endes of the worlde are come vpon.
Wherefore lette hym that thynketh he standeth, take hede lest he fall.
There hath none other temptacion taken you, but suche as foloweth the nature of man.
But God is faythfull, whiche shall not suffer you to bee tempted aboue your strength: but shal in the middes of the temptacion make a way, that ye may be hable to beare it.
IE&sus sayde vnto hys disciples: There was a certayne ryche manne, whiche had a Stewarde, and the same was accused vnto hym, that he hadde wasted hys goodes.
And he called hym, and sayde vnto hym: howe is it that heare thys of thee? Geue accomptes of thy Stewardship, for thou mayst be no longer Stewarde.
The Stewarde sayde within hymselfe: what shall doe? For my maister taketh away from me the Stewardship.
wote what to do, that when am put out of the Stewardship, they may receiue me into theyr houses.
So when he had called all his Masters debters together, he sayed vnto the first: how much owest thost vnto my Master? And he sayed: an hundred tunnes of oyle.
And he sayde vnto him: take thy Bill, and sitte downe quickely, and wryte fiftie.
Then sayde he to an other: howe muche owest thou? And he sayde: an hundred quarters of wheate.
He sayde vnto him: take thy bil and write foure skore.
And the Lorde commended the vniuste Stewarde, because he had done wisely.
For the children of this world are in their nacion wiser then the chyldren of lighte.
And saye vnto you: Make you frendes of the vnryghteous Mammon, that when ye shall haue nede, they may receyue you into euerlasting habitacions.
THy handes haue made me and fashioned me: geue me vnderstandyng, that may learne thy commaundementes.
They that feare thee will be glad, when they see me: because that haue put my truste in thy woorde.
know, Lord, that thy iudgementes are righte: and that thou of very faithfulnes, hast caused me to be troubled.
let thy mercifull kindnes be my coumfort: According to thy woorde vnto thy seruaunt.
let thy louing mercies come vnto me, that may liue: for thy lawe is my delighte.
Let the proude be confounded, for they goe wickedly about to destroye me: But will bee occupyed in thy commaundementes.
Let suche as feare thee, and haue knowen thy testimonies: be turned vnto me.
let my hearte be sounde in thy statutes: that bee not ashamed.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
LEt thy merciful eares, Lorde, be open to the prayers of thy humble seruauntes: and that they maye obteyne theyr peticions, make them to aske suche thynges as shall please thee: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
Ye knowe that ye were Gentiles, and wente your wayes vnto dumme ymages, euen as ye were led.
Wherfore declare vnto you, that no man, speaking by the spirite of God, defyeth Iesus.
Also no manne can say that Iesus is the Lorde, but by the holy Goste.
And there are differences of administracyons, and yet but one lorde.
And there are diuerse maners of operacions, and yet but one God, whiche woorketh all in all.
The gifte of the spirite is geuen to euery man, to edifye with all.
For to one is geuen through the spirite, the vtteraunce of wisedome: To an other is geuen the vtterau~ce of knowlege, by the same spirite.
To an other the gifte of healyng, by the same spirite.
To another the interpretacyon of tongues: But these all woorketh euen the selfe same spirite, deuiding to euery man a seuerall gifte, euen as he wil.
ANd when he was come nere to Hierusalem, he behelde the citie, and wepte on it, saying: If thou hadst knowen those thinges, whiche belong vnto thy peace, euen in thys thy day thou wouldest take hede.
For the dayes shall come vpon thee, that thy enemies also shall caste a banke aboute thee, and compasse thee rounde, and keepe thee in on euerye syde, and make thee euen with the ground, and thy children whiche are in thee.
And they shall not leaue in thee one stone vpon an other, because thou knoweste not the tyme of thy visytacion.
And he wente into the Temple, and began to caste oute them that solde therin, and them that bought, saying vnto them: It is written, my house is the house of prayer: but ye haue made it a denne of theues.
MY soule hath longed for thy saluacyon: and haue a good hope, because of thy woorde.
Myne eyes long soore for thy woorde, saying: when wilt thou coumfort me? For am become lyke a botle in the smoke: yet doe not forget thy statutes.
Howe many are the dayes of thy seruaunte? when wilte thou be auenged of them that persecute me? The proude haue dygged pyttes for me: whiche are not after thy lawe.
They had almost made an ende of me vpon earth: but forsoke not thy commaundementes.
quicken me after thy louyng kyndenes: and so shall kepe the testimonies of thy mouth.
Glory be to the father and to the sonne. &c.
GOd which declarest thy almightie power, most chieflye in shewing mercy and pitie: Geue vnto vs abu~dauntly thy grace, that we runnyng to thy promises, may bee made partakers of thy heauenly treasure: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
BRethren, as perteining to the gospel, which preached vnto you, whiche ye haue also accepted, and in the which ye continue, by yt which also ye are saued: doe you to wete after what maner preached vnto you, yf ye kepe it, except ye haue beleued in vaine.
For first of all deliuered vnto you that whiche receyued, howe that Christ dyed for our sinnes, agreeyng to the scriptures: and that he was buried, that he arose agayne the thirde daye, accordyng to the scriptures: And that he was seene of Cephas, then of the .xii.
After that was he sene of mo then fiue hundreth brethren at once, of whiche many remayne vnto this daye, and many are fallen a slepe.
After that appeared he to Iames, then to al the Apostles.
And last of al he was sene of me, as of one that was borne out of due time.
For am the least of the apostles, which am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because haue persecuted the congregacion of God.
And his grace whiche is in me: was not in vayne.
But laboured more aboundauntly then they al: yet not I, but the grace of God whiche is with me.
Therefore, whether it were or they, so we preached and so ye haue beleued.
CHri&st tolde this parable vnto certayne whiche trusted in them selues that they were perfect, despised other.
Two men wente vp into the temple to pray, the one a Pharise and the other a Publican.
God, thanke thee that am not as other men are, extorcioners, vniuste, adulterers, or as this Publican.
fast twise in the weke: geue tythe of all that possesse.
And the Publican sta~ding a farre of, woulde not lift vp his eyes to heauen, but smote vpon his brest, saying: God, bee mercifull to me a synner.
tell you, thys manne departed home to hys house iustifyed more then the other.
For euery man that exalteth himselfe shalbe broughte lowe: And he that humbleth himselfe shal be exalted.
Thy trueth also remayneth from one generacio~ to another: thou haste layde the foundacyon of the earth, and it abydeth.
They continue this day, according to thine ordinaunce: for all thinges serue thee.
If my delyte had not beene in thy lawe: shoulde haue perished in my trouble.
will neuer forget thy commaundementes: for with them thou hast quickened me.
am thyne, Oh saue me: For haue soughte thy commaundementes.
The vngodly laide wayte for me to destroy me: but wil consider thy testimonies.
see that al thinges come to an ende: but thy commaundementes are exceding broade.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: world without ende.
ALmightie and euerlasting God, whiche arte alwayes more ready to heare then we to praye: And art wonte to geue more then either we desire or deserue: Powre down vpon vs the aboundaunce of thy mercy, forgeuing vs those thinges wherof our conscience is afrayde, and geuing vnto vs that that our prayer dare not presume to aske: through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
SVche trust haue we through Christ to God warde, not that we are sufficiente of our selues, to thynke any thyng, as of our selues, but if we be hable vnto any thing, the same cummeth of god, which hath made vs hable to minister the new testament, not of the letter but of the spirite: For the letter killeth, but the spirite geueth lyfe.
If the ministracion of death, through the letters figured in stones, was glorious, so that the childre~ of Israel could not beholde the face of Moses, for the glory of hys countenau~ce (whiche glory is done away:) why shall not the ministracion of the spirite be much more glorious? for if the ministracyon of condemnacyon be gloryous, muche more dooethe the ministracion of righteousnes excede in glorye.
IE&sus departed from the coastes of Tyre and Sydon, and came vnto the sea of Galile throughe the middes of the Coastes of the .x. cityes.
And they broughte vnto hym one that was deaffe, and had an impedimente in hys speche, and they prayed hym to put his hande vpon hym.
And when he had taken hym asyde fro~ the people, he put his fingers into his eares: did spyt, and touched his tongue, and looked vp to heauen sighed, and sayde vnto him: Ephata, that is to say, be opened.
And straight waye his eares were opened, and the string of hys tongue was looced, and he spake playne.
And he co~maunded them that they should tel no man.
But the more he forbad them, so muche the more a great deale they publyshed, saying: He hath doone all thynges well, he hath made both the deaffe to heare, and the dumme to speake.
LOrde, what loue haue vnto thy lawe? all the day long is my study in it.
Thou through thy co~maundementes hast made me wiser then mine enemies: for they are euer with me.
haue more vnderstandyng then my teachers: for thy testimonies are my study.
haue refrayned my feete from euery euill waye: that may kepe thy woorde.
haue not shrinked from thy iudgementes: for thou teachest me.
howe swete are thy woordes vnto my throte? yea sweter then hony vnto my mouth.
Throughe thy commaundementes gette vnderstanding: therfore hate al wicked wayes.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
ALmyghtye and mercifull God, of whose onely gyfte it cummeth, that thy faythfull people dooe vnto thee true and laudable seruice: graunt we beseche thee, that we may so runne to thy heauenly promises, that we fayle not finallye to attayne the same: throughe Iesus Christe oure Lorde.
He sayeth not in the seedes, as manye: but in thy seede, as of one, whiche is Christe.
This say, that the lawe whiche began afterward, beyond iiii. C. and .xxx. yeres, doeth not disanul the testament that was confirmed afore of God vnto Christewarde, to make the promise of none effect.
For if the inheritaunce come of the lawe, it cummeth not now of promise.
Wherefore then serueth the lawe? The lawe was added because of transgression (til the seede came, to whom the promise was made) and it was ordayned by Aungels in the hand of a mediator.
mediator is not a mediator of one: But God is one.
Is the law then agaynst the promise of God? God forbidde.
For if there had beene a lawe geuen whiche coulde haue geuen lyfe: then no doubt righteousnes shoulde haue come by the lawe.
But the scripture concludeth all thinges vnder sinne, that the promise, by the fayth of Iesus Christe, shoulde bee geuen vnto them that beleue.
HAppy are the eyes which se the thinges that ye se.
For tel you, that many prophetes and kinges haue desired to se those thinges which ye se, haue not sene them, and to heare those thinges which ye heare, and haue not heard them.
And beholde, a certayne lawyer stoode vp and tempted hym, saying: Master, what shall doe to inherite eternall lyfe? he sayd vnto him: what is written in the lawe? howe readest thou? and he aunswered, and sayd: Loue the Lorde thy God with all thy hearte, and with all thy soule; and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind: and thy neighbour as thy selfe.
This doe and thou shalt liue: but he willing to iustifye hymselfe, sayde vnto Iesus: And who is my neighbour: Iesus aunswered and sayde.
certayne man descended from Ierusalem to Hierico, and fell among theues, whiche robbed him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leauing him halfe dead.
And it chaunced that there came downe a certayne Prieste that same waye, and when he sawe hym, he passed by.
And likewise a Leuite, when he went nye to the place, came and loked on him, and passed by.
But a certayne Samaritane as he ioueneied, came vnto him: and when he saw him, he had compassion on him, and went to, and bounde vp his woundes, and powred in oyle and wine, and set him on his owne beast and brought him to a commo~ inne, and made prouision for hym.
And on the morowe, when he departed, he toke out two pence, and gaue them to the hoste, and sayde vnto him: Take cure of hym, whatsoeuer thou spendest more, when come agayn, wil recompence thee.
Which now of these three, thinkest thou was neighbour vnto him that fel among the theues? and he sayde: he that shewed mercy on hym.
Then sayde Iesus vnto hym: goe, and doe thou lykewise.
THy worde is a Lanterne vnto my feete: and a light vnto my pathes.
haue sworne, and am stedfastlye purposed: to kepe thy righteous iudgementes.
am troubled aboue measure: quicken me, Lorde, according vnto thy woorde.
Let the free will offerynges of my mouth please thee, Lorde: and teache me thy iudgementes.
My soule is alway in my hande: yet doe not forget thy lawe.
The vngodlye haue layed a snare for me: but yet swarued not from thy commaundementes.
Thy testimonies haue claymed as myne heritage for euer: and why? they are the very ioye of my heart.
haue applyed my heart to fulfill thy statutes alwaye: euen vnto the ende.
ALmightie and euerlastyng God, geue vnto vs the increase of fayth, hope, and charitie, and that we maye obteyne that whiche thou doeste promyse: make vs to loue that whiche thou doest commaunde, through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
Say, walke in the spirite, and fulfill not the luste of the fleshe.
For the fleshe lusteth contrarye to the spirite, and the spirite contrarye to the fleshe: these are contrary one to the other, so that ye cannot doe whatsoeuer ye woulde.
But and yf ye be led of the spirite, then are ye not vnder the lawe.
The dedes of the fleshe are manifest, whiche are these: adultry, fornicacion, vnclennes, wantonnesse, wurshippyng of images, witchcraft, hatred, variau~ce, zele, wrath, strife, sedicyons, sectes, enuying, murder, dronkennes, gluttony, and suche lyke, of the whiche tell you before, as haue tolde you in tymes past, that they whiche commyt suche thynges, shall not bee inheritors of the kingdome of God.
Contrarilye, the fruite of the spirite is loue, ioy, peace, long suffering, gentlenes, goodnes, faithfulnes, mekenes, temperaunce.
They truelye that are Christes, haue crucifyed the fleshe with the affeccions and lustes.
ANd it chaunsed as Iesus wente to Ierusalem, that he passed throughe Samaria and Galile.
And as he entred into a certayne towne, there met hym .x. men that were lepers.
Whiche stode a farre of, and put furth their voyces, and sayde.
When he sawe them, he sayed vnto them: goe shewe your selues vnto the Priestes.
And it came to passe, that as they wente they were clensed.
And one of them, when he sawe that he was clensed, turned backe agayn, with a loude voyce praised God, and fel downe on his face at his feete, gaue him thankes.
And Iesus aunswered, and sayde: Are there not .x. clensed? but where are those ix? There are not found that returned agayne to geue God prayse, saue onely thys straungier.
And he sayd vnto hym: aryse, goe thy way, thy fayth hath made thee whole.
Hate them that imagine euill thynges: but thy lawe doe loue.
Thou arte my defence and shylde: and my trust is in thy woorde.
Away frome ye wicked: will kepe the commaundementes of my God.
stablyshe me accordyng vnto thy woorde, that may liue: and let me not be disapoynted of my hope.
Holde thou me vp, and shalbe safe: yea my delyte shall euer be in thy statutes.
Thou hast troden downe all them that depart from thy statutes: for they imagine but deceipte.
Thou puttest awaye all the vngodly of the earthe lyke drosse: therfore loue thy testimonies.
My fleshe trembleth for feare of thee: and am afrayde of thy iudgementes.
Glory be to the father and to the sonne. &c.
KEpe we beseche thee, Lorde, thy Churche with thy perpetuall mercye, and because the frayltie of man, withoute thee, can not but fall: Kepe vs euer by thy helpe, and leade vs to all thynges profitable to our saluacion: through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
YE see howe large a letter haue written vnto you with myne owne hande.
As many as desyre with outwarde appearaunce to please carnally, the same constraine you to be circu~cised, onely lest they should suffer persecucio~ for the crosse of Christ.
For they the~selues which are circu~cised kepe not the lawe, but desyre to haue you circumcised, that they might reioice in your fleshe.
God forbid that should reioice but in ye crosse of our lord Iesu Christ, wherby the world is crucified vnto me, vnto the world.
For in Christ Iesu neither circumcision auaileth any thing at all, nor vncircumcisyon: but a newe creature.
And as many as walke according vnto this rule, peace be on them, and mercye, and vpon Israell that pertaynethe to God.
From hencefurth, lette no manne put me to busines: for beare in my body the markes of the Lorde Iesu.
Brethren, the grace of our Lorde Iesu Christe, be with your spirite.
NO man can serue two Maisters: for eyther he shall hate the one and loue the other, or elles leane to the one, and despise the other: ye can not serue God and Mammo~.
Therfore say vnto you: be not careful for your life, what ye shal eate or drinke: nor yet for your body, what raime~t ye shal put on.
Is not the life more worth the~ meat? the body more of value then raiment? Behold the foules of the ayre, for they sow not, neyther doe they reape, nor cary into the barnes: and your heauenly father feedeth them.
Are ye not muche better then they? Whiche of you (by taking carefull thoughte) can adde one cubite vnto hys stature? And why care ye for rayment? Consider the Lilies of the fielde, howe they growe.
And yet saye vnto you, that euen Salomon in all his royaltie, was not clothed lyke one of these.
Wherefore, if God so clothe the grasse of the fielde (whiche though it stande to day, is to morow cast into the fornace:) shall he not muche more doe the same for you, ye of lytle fayth? Therefore take no thoughte, saying: what shall we eate, or what shall we drynke, or wherwith shall we be clothed? after al these thinges doe the gentiles seeke.
For your heauenlye father knoweth that ye haue nede of all these thinges.
But rather seeke ye firste the kyngdome of God, and the righteousnes thereof, and all these thynges shalbe ministred vnto you.
Care not then for the morowe: for the morowe day shall care for it selfe: sufficiente vnto the daye is the trauail therof.
Deale with the thing that is lawful and right: geue me not ouer vnto myne oppressours.
Make thou thy seruaunte to delyte in that which is good: that the proud do me no wrong.
Myne iyes are wasted awaye with lookyng for thy health: and for the woorde of thy righteousnes.
deale with thy seruaunte accordyng vnto thy louyng mercy: and teache me thy statutes.
am thy seruaunte: graunte me vnderstandyng, that may knowe thy testimonies.
It is tyme for thee Lorde, to lay to thyne hande: for they haue destroyed thy lawe.
Therfore holde straighte all thy commaundementes: and all false wayes vtterly abhorre.
Glory be to the father and to the sonne. &c.
LOrde we beseche thee, let thy continuall pitie clense and defende thy congregacyon: and because it can not continue in safetie withoute thy succoure, preserue it euermore by thy helpe and goodnes: through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
Desyre that you faynt not because of my tribulacions that suffer for your sakes: whiche is youre prayse.
For thys cause bowe my knees vnto the father of our Lorde Iesus Christe, which is father ouer al that is called father in heaue~ and in yearth, that he woulde graunte you, accordyng to the riches of his glorye, that ye may be strengthed with might by hys spirite in the inner manne: that Christe maye dwell in your heartes by fayth that ye being rooted and grounded in loue, myght be able to comprehend with al saintes, what is the bredth and length, depth and heigth, and to know the excellent loue of the knowledge of Christe, that ye myght be fulfilled with all fulnes, which commeth of God.
Vnto him that is able to do exceadyng aboundantlye aboue all that wee aske or think according to the power that worketh in vs, be praise in the congregacion by Christ Iesus, throughout all generacions from tyme to tyme.
ANd it fortuned that Iesus went into a Citie called Naim, and many of hys disciples went wyth him, and muche people.
When he came nie to the gate of the citie, beholde, there was a dead man caried out, which was the only sonne of hys mother, and she was a wedowe, muche people of the citie was with her.
And when the Lorde sawe her, he had compassion on her, and sayed vnto her: weepe not.
And he came nye, and touched the coffen, and they that bare hym stode still.
And he that was dead, sate vp, and began to speake.
And they gaue the glory vnto God, saying: great Prophet is rysen vp among vs, and God hath visited his people.
And this rumor of him we~t forth throughout al Iewrye, and throughout al the regions which lye round about.
THy testimonies are wonderfull: therfore doeth my soule kepe them.
When thy word goeth forth: it geueth lyghte and vnderstanding euen vnto the symple.
opened my mouth and drue in my breath: for my delyte was in thy commaundementes.
looke thou vpon me, and be mercyfull vnto me: as thou vsest to do vnto those that loue thy name.
Order my steppes in thy worde: and so shall no wyckednes haue dominion ouer me.
delyuer me from the wrongfull dealinges of menne: and so shall kepe thy commaundementes.
Shewe the light of thy countenaunce vpon thy seruaunt: and teache me thy statutes.
Myne iyes gushe out with water: because men kepe not thy lawe.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the. &c.
As it was in the begynning, is nowe and euer. &c.
LOrde, we praye thee that thy grace maie alwayes preuent and folowe vs, and make vs continually to be geuen to all good workes: through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
(whiche am a prisoner of the Lordes) exhorte you, that ye walke worthy of the vocacion wherwyth ye are called, with all lowlines and mekenes, with humblenes of mind, forbearyng one another through loue, and be delygente to kepe the vnytie of the spirite through the bonde of peace, being one body and one spirite, euen as ye are called in one hope of your callyng.
Let there be but one Lorde, one faith, one baptisme, one God and father of all, which is aboue all, and through all, and in you all.
IT chaunced that Iesus went into the house of one of the chiefe Phariseis, to eate bread, on the Sabboth daye: and they watched him.
And beholde, there was a certaine manne before hym, whiche had the dropsye.
And Iesus aunswered, and spake vnto the lawiers and Phariseis, saying.
Is it lawefull to heale on the Sabboth daye? And they helde theyr peace.
And he toke him and healed hym, and let him go: and answered them, saying: which of you shall haue an Asse or an Oxe fallen into a pyt, and will not straygth waye pul hym out on the Sabboth daye? And they coulde not aunswere him againe to these thinges.
He put forth also a similitude to the geastes, when he marked howe they preaced to be in the hiest roumes, said vnto them: when thou art bidde~ of any man to a wedding, sit not doune in the highest roume, lest a more honorable man then thou, be bidden of him, and he (that bad him and thee) come and saye to thee: geue thys man roume: and thou then begyn with shame to take the lowest roume.
But rather when thou art bidden, go and sit in the lowest roume, that whe~ he that bad thee commeth, he may saie vnto thee: frend sit vp hier.
Then shalt thou haue worship in the presence of them that sit at meate with thee.
For whosoeuer exalteth himselfe, shalbe brought lowe, and he that humbleth himselfe, shalbe exalted.
The testymonies that thou hast co~maunded: are exceadyng righteous and true.
My zeale hath euen consumed me: because myne enemyes haue forgotten thy wordes.
Thy worde is tried to the vttermost: and thy seruaunt loueth it.
am small and of no reputacion: yet do not forgette thy commaundementes.
Thy ryghteousnes is an euerlasting righteousnes: and thy lawe is the trueth.
Trouble and heauynes haue taken holde vpon me: yet is my delight in thy commaundementes.
The ryghteousnes of thy testimonies is euerlastyng: graunt me vnderstanding and shall lyue.
LOrde wee beseche thee, graunte thy people grace to auoyde the infeccions of the deuyll, and with pure hearte and mynde, to folowe thee, the onely God: Through Iesus Christe oure Lorde.
Thanke my God alwayes on your behalfe, for the grace of God, which is geuen you by Iesus Christe, that in all thynges ye are made ryche by hym, in all vtteraunce, and in all knowledge, by the whiche thynges the testimonye of Iesus Christe, was confirmed in you, so that ye are behynde in no gyfte, waityng for the apperyng of oure Lorde Iesus Christe, which shall also strength you vnto the ende, that ye maye be blameles, in the daye of the commyng of oure Lord Iesus Christe.
When the Phaciseis had heard, that Iesus did put the Saduce is to silence, they came together, and one of them (which was a Doctor of lawe) asked hym a question, tempting him, and saying: Maister, whiche is the greatest Co~maundeme~t in the lawe: Iesus said vnto him: Thou shalt loue the lorde thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soule, and with al thy minde.
In these two commaundementes, hange all the lawe and the Prophetes.
While the Phariseis were gathered together, Iesus asked them, saying: what thynke ye of Christe? whose sonne is he? They sayd vnto him: the sonne of Dauid.
He sayde vnto them: howe then doth Dauid in spirite, call hym Lorde, saying: The Lorde sayde vnto my Lorde, sit thou on my ryghte hande tyll make thyne enemyes thy footestoole.
If Dauid then call hym Lorde, howe is he then hys sonne? And no man was able to aunswere him any thing, neither durst any man (from that day furth) aske hym any mo questions.
Call with my whole hearte: heare me, Lord, wyll kepe thy statutes.
Yea, euen vpon thee do call: helpe me and shall kepe thy testymonies.
Early in the morning do crie vnto thee: for in thy worde is my truste.
Myne tyes preuente the nyghte watches: that myghte be occupyed in thy wordes.
Heare my voyce (O Lorde) accordying vnto thy louyng kyndnesse: quycken me accordyng as thou art wont.
They drawe nye that of malice persecute me: and are farre from thy lawe.
Be thou nye at hande, Lorde: For al thy commaundementes are true.
As concernyng thy testymonyes, haue knowen long since: that thou hast grounded them for euer.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
GOD, for asmuche as without thee, we are not able to please thee: Graunt that the workyng of thy mercye, maye in all thynges directe and rule oure heartes: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
THys saye and testyfie through the Lorde, that ye hencefurth walke not as other Gentyles walke, in vanytie of their mynde, whyle they are blynded in their vnderstanding, beyng farre from a godly lyfe, by the meanes of the ignorauncie that is in them, and because of the blyndenesse of their heartes, whiche beyng past repentaunce, haue geuen themselues ouer vnto wantonnes, to worke all maner of vncleannes, euen with gredynes.
If so be that ye haue hearde of him, haue been taught in hym, as the trueth is in Iesu (as concernyng the conuersacyon in tyme paste) to laye fro~ you that olde man, whiche is corrupte, accordyng to the deceiueable lustes.
To be renued also in the spirite of your minde, and to putte on that newe man, which after God is shapen in ryghteousnes and true holynes.
Wherfore, put awaye lying, and speake euery man trueth vnto hys neighbour, forasmuche as we are membres one of a nother.
Be angrye and synne not: Let not the Sunne go doune vpon your wrath, neither geue place to the backbiter.
Lette hym that stole, steale nomore, but lette him rather laboure with his handes the thing which is good, that he maye geue vnto hym that nedeth.
Let no fylthy communicacion procede out of your mouth: But that whiche is good to edifie withall, as oft as nede is, that it maye mynyster grace vnto the hearers.
And greue not ye the holy spirite of God, by whom ye are sealed vnto the daye of redempcion.
Let all bytternesse and fearcenesse, and wrath, and roaryng, and cursed speakyng, be put awaye from you, with all malyciousnes.
Be ye curteous one to another, mercyfull, forgeuyng one another, euen as God for Christes sake hath forgeuen you.
IE&sus entred into a shyppe and passed ouer, and came into hys owne Cytie: And beholde, they broughte to him a manne sycke of the Palsey, lying in a bed.
And when Iesus sawe the fayth of them, he said vnto the sicke of the Palsey: So~ne bee of good there, thy synnes be forgeuen thee.
And beholde, certayne of the Scrybes sayd within themselues: this manne blasphemeth.
And when Iesus sawe their thoughtes, he saide: wherfore thynke ye euil in your heartes? whether is it easyer to say, thy sinnes be forgeuen thee, or to saye, arise and walke? But that ye maie knowe that the sonne of manne hathe power to forgeue sinnes in yearth: Then saieth he vnto the sycke of the Palsey: Aryse, take vp thy bed and go vnto thine house.
And he arose and departed to his house: But the people that sawe it, merueiled and glorifyed God, which had geuen suche power vnto men.
Considre myne aduersitie, and deliuer me: For do not forget thy lawe.
Auenge thou my cause and deliuer me: quycken me according vnto thy worde.
Health is farre from the vngodly: For they regarde not thy statutes.
Greate is thy mercy, Lorde: quicken me as thou art wonte.
Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me: yet do not swarue from thy testymonies.
It greueth me when see the trangressors: because they kepe not thy lawe.
Consider, Lord, howe loue thy commaundementes: quicken me, accordyng to thy louyng kyndnesse.
Thy worde is true from euerlastyng: All the iudgementes of thy righteousnes endure for euermore.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the begynning, is nowe. &c The Collect.
ALmighty and mercyful God, of thy bountefull goodnes, kepe vs from all thynges that maye hurte vs: that we beyng ready both in bodye and soule, maye with free heartes accomplyshe those thynges, that thou wouldest haue doen: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
TAke hede therfore, howe ye walke circumspectelye: not as vnwise, but as wisemen, winnyng occasion, because the dayes are euyll.
Wherfore be ye not vnwise, but vnderstand what the wyll of the Lorde is, and be not dronken with wyne, wherin is excesse.
But be fylled with the spirite, speaking vnto your selues in Psalmes and Hymnes, and spirituall songes, synging and makyng melody to the Lorde in your heartes, geuing thankes alwaies for all thynges vnto God the father, in the name of oure Lord Iesus Christ: submittyng your selues one to another, in the feare of God.
IE&sus sayed to hys discyples: The kyngdome of heauen is lyke vnto a manne that was a kyng, which made a Mariage for his sonne, and sente furth his seruauntes, to call them that were bid to the weddyng, and they woulde not come.
Agayne he sent furth other seruauntes, saying: Tell them which are bydden: beholde, haue prepared my diner, mine Oxen and my fatlynges are kylled, and all thynges are ready: come vnto the Mariage.
But they made light of it, and went their waies: One to hys farme place, another to his Marchaundise, and the remnaunte toke his seruauntes, and intreated them shamefullye, and siewe them.
But when the Kyng heard therof, he was wrothe, and sent furth hys menne of warre, and destroyed those murtherers, and brent vp their citie.
Then said he to his seruauntes: the Maryage in dede is prepared, but they which were bidden, were not worthy: Go ye therfore out into the hye wayes: and as many as ye finde, bid them to the Mariage.
And the seruauntes went furth into the hye wayes, and gathered together all, as many as they coulde fynde, both good and bad, and the wedding was furnished with geastes.
Then the kyng came in to se the geastes: and when he spied there a man, which had not on a wedding garment, he said vnto him: frende, howe cammest thou in hither not hauyng a weddyng Garment? And he was euen speacheles.
Then sayd the Kyng to the mynisters: take and bynde hym hand and foote, and caste hym into vtter darckenesse, there shalbe wepyng and gnashyng of teeth.
PRynces haue persecuted me without cause: but my heart standeth in awe of thy wordes.
am as glad of thy worde: as one that fyndeth great spoyles.
As for lies, hate and abhorre them: But thy lawe do loue.
Seuen tymes a daye do prayse thee: Because of thy righteous iudgementes.
Greate is the peace that they haue which loue thy lawe: and they are not offended at it.
Lorde, haue loked for thy sauyng health: and doen after thy commaundementes.
My soule hath kepte thy testymonyes: and loued them exceadyngly haue kepte thy commaundementes and testymonies: for all my wayes are before thee.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy ghoste.
As it was in the begynning, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
GRaunte wee beseche thee, mercyfull Lorde, to thy faythfull people, pardon and peace: that they may be clensed from all their sinnes, and serue thee with a quyete mynde: Through Iesus Christ oure Lorde.
MY brethren, be strong through the Lord, through the power of hys myght.
Put on all the armoure of God, that ye maye stande agaynst the assaultes of the deuyll: for we wrestle not agaynste bloude and fleshe, but agaynst rule, against power, agaynst worldly rulers, euen gouerners of the darckenes of this worlde, agaynst spirituall craftinesse, in heauenly thynges.
Wherfore, take vnto you the whole armoure of God, that ye may be able to resyst in the euyll daye, and stande perfecte in all thynges.
Stande therfore, and your loynes gyrde with the trueth, hauyng on the breste plate of ryghteousnes, and hauing shoes on your feete, that ye maye be prepared for the gospell of peace.
Aboue all, take to you the shilde of fayth, wherwith ye maye quenche all the fiery dartes of the wycked.
And take the helmet of saluacion, and the sworde of the spirite, which is the worde of God.
And praie alwaies with all maner of praier, supplicacion in the spirite, and watch therunto with all instaunce and supplicacion, for al sayntes and for me: that vtteraunce maye be geuen vnto me, that maye open my mouth frely, to vtter the secretes of my gospell (wherof am a messenger in bo~des) that therin may speake freely, as ought to speake.
THere was a certayne Ruler, whose sonne was sycke at Capernaum.
Assene as the same hearde, that Iesus was come out of Iewry into Galile, he went vnto him, besought him that he would come doune and heale hys sonne.
Then sayed Iesus vnto hym: except ye see signes and wonders, ye wyll not beleue.
The Ruler saieth vnto him: Syr, come doune or euer that my so~ne dye. Iesus saieth vnto hym: go thy waye, thy sonne lyueth.
The man beleued the worde that Iesus had spoken vnto hym.
And as he was goyng doune, the seruauntes mette hym, and told hym, saying: thy sonne liueth.
Then enquyred he of them the houre, when he beganne to amende.
And they said vnto him: yesterdaye at the seuenth houre, the feuer left hym.
So the father knewe that it was the same houre, in the whiche Iesus sayd vnto hym.
Thy sonne lyueth, and he beleued, and all hys housholde.
Thys is againe the seconde miracle that Iesus did, when he was come out of Iewry into Galile.
LEt my complaynte come before thee, Lorde: Geue me vnderstandyng accordyng vnto thy worde.
let my supplicacion come before thee: Delyuer me according to thy worde.
My lyppes shall speake of thy praise: when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
Yea, my toungue shall sing of thy worde: For all thy commaundementes are righteous.
Let thyne hande helpe me: For haue chosen thy commaundementes.
haue longed for thy sauing healthe, Lorde: And in thy lawe is my delight.
lette my soule lyue, and it shall prayse thee: And thy iudgementes shall helpe me.
haue gone astraye lyke a shepe that is lost: seke thy seruaunte, for doe not forget thy commaundementes.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy ghoste.
As it was in the begynning, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
LOrde we beseche thee to kepe thy housholde the churche, in contynuall godlynes: that through thy proteccion, it maye be free from all aduersyties, and deuoutly geuen to serue thee in good workes, to the glory of thy name: Through Iesus Christe oure Lorde.
Thanke my God with all remembraunce of you alwayes in all my prayers for you, and praye with gladnes: Because ye are come into the felowshyp of the Gospell, from the fyrst daye vnto nowe.
And am surelye certyfyed of thys, that he whyche hath begon a good worke in you, shall performe it vntyll the day of Iesus Christe: as it becommeth me, so iudge of you all, because haue you in my hearte: forasmuche as ye are all companions of grace with me, euen in my bondes, and in the defendyng and stablishing of the Gospell: for God is my recorde howe greately longe after you all, from the very hearte rote in Iesus Christ.
And thys praye, that your loue may increase yet more and more in knowledge, in all vnderstandyng, that ye maye accepte the thynges that are moste excellente, that ye may be pure, and suche as offend no man, vntyll the daye of Christe, beeyng fylled with the fruite of righteousnes, which commeth by Iesus Christ, vnto the glory and praise of God.
PEter sayde vnto Iesus: Lorde howe oft shall forgeue my brother, if he synne agaynst me, tyll seuen times? Iesus saieth vnto him? saye not vnto thee vntyll seuen tymes: but seuentie tymes seuen times.
Therfore is the kyngdome of heauen lykened vnto a certayne man that was a kyng, which woulde take accoumptes of his seruauntes.
And when he had begon to recken, one was broughte vnto hym, whyche ought him tenne M. talentes, but forasmuche as he was not able to paye, his Lorde commaunded hym to be solde, and hys wyfe and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.
The seruaunt fell doune, and besoughte hym, saying: syr, haue pacience with me, and wyll paye thee all.
Then had the Lorde pytye on that seruaunt, and loced hym, and forgaue him the debt.
So the same seruaunt went out, and founde one of his felowes which ought hym an.
C. pence, and he layed handes on hym, and toke hym by the throte, saying: paye that thou owest.
And hys felowe fell doune, and besoughte him, saying: haue pacience with me, and wyll paye thee all.
And he woulde not, but wente and cast hym into pryson, tyll he shoulde paye the debt.
So, when hys felowes sawe what was doen, they were very sory, and came and tolde vnto their Lorde all that had happened.
thou vngracyous seruaunt, forgaue thee all that debt, when thou desyredst me: shouldest not thou also haue had compassion on thy felowe, euen as had pitye on thee? And his Lorde was wroth, and deliuered him to the Iailers, tyll he should paye all that was due vnto him: So lykewise shall my heauenly father do also to you, if ye from your heartes forgeue not (euery one his brother) their trespaces.
IF the Lorde himselfe had not been on our side (nowe maye Israell saye:) if the Lord hymselfe had not been on our syde, when men rose vp agaynst vs.
They had swalowed vs vp quick: when they were so wrathfully displeased at vs. Yea, the waters had drouned vs: and the streame had gone ouer our soule.
The depe waters of the proude: had gone euen ouer our soule.
But praysed be the Lorde: which hath not geuen vs ouer for a praye vnto theyr teethe.
Our soule is escaped, euen as a birde out of the snare of the fouler: the snare is broken, and we are delyuered.
Oure helpe standeth in the name of the Lorde: whyche hath made heauen and yearth.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
GOd our refuge and strenght, whiche art the author of al godlynes, be ready to heare the deuoute prayers of thy churche: and graunte that those thynges whiche we aske faithfully, we may obtaine effectually: through Iesu Christ oure Lorde.
BRethren be folowers together of me, and looke on them whiche walke euen so as ye haue vs for an example.
For many walke (of whome haue tolde you often, and nowe tell you wepyng) that they are the enemies of the crosse of Christ, whose end is damnacion, whose bely is theyr god, glory to their shame, which are worldly mynded.
But our conuersacion is in heauen, from whence we loke for the sauiour, euen the Lorde Iesus Christ, which shal chaunge our vyle body, that he may make it lyke vnto hys gloryous bodye: according to the workyng, wherby he is able also to subdue all thinges vnto hymselfe.
THen the Pharyseis wente out and toke counsayll, howe they myghte tangle hym in his wordes.
And they sent out vnto him their disciples with Herodes seruauntes, saying: Maister, we knowe that thou arte true, and teacheste the waye of God truely, neither carest thou for any man, for thou regardest not the outward appearaunce of men.
Tel vs therfore, howe thinkest thou? Is it lawful that tribute be geuen vnto Cesar, or not? But Iesus perceyuing theyr wickednes, sayd: why tempte ye me ye ypocrites? Shewe me the tribute money.
And he sayd vnto them: whose is this Image and superscripcion? they sayd vnto him, Cesars: Then said he vnto them: geue therfore vnto Cesar, the thinges whych are Cesars: and vnto God, those thinges that are Goddes.
When they had hearde these wordes, they meruayled, and left him, and went their waye.
THey that put theyr trust in the Lorde, shalbe euen as the mount Syon: which may not be remoued, but standeth fast for euer.
The hylles stande about Ierusalem: euen so standeth the Lorde round about his people, from this time foorth for euer more.
For the rodde of the vngodly commeth not into the lot of the righteous: lest the righteous put theyr hande vnto wickednes.
Do well (O Lorde:) vnto those that be good and true of hearte.
As for such as turne backe vnto their owne wickednes: the Lorde shall leade them foorth with the euell doers, but peace shalbe vpon Israell.
Glory be to the father, to the sonne, to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynning, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.

For thys cause we also, euersence the daye we heard of it, haue not ceased to praye for you, and to desyre that ye myght be fulfilled with the knowledge of his wyll, in all wysdome and spirituall vnderstandyng, that ye myght walke worthy of the Lorde, that in al thynges ye maye please, being fruitefull in all good workes, and encreasing in the knoweledge of God, strengthed with all myght, through hys gloryous power, vnto all pacience and long sufferyng, with ioyfulnesse, geuyng tha~kes vnto the father, which hath made vs meete to be partakers of the inherytaunce of saynctes in lyghte.
WHyle Iesus spake vnto the people, beholde, there came a certayne ruler, and worshipped hym, saying: my doughter is eue~ nowe disceased, but come and laye thy hande vpon her, and she shall liue.
And Iesus arose folowed hym, and so dyd his discyples.
And beholde, a woman which was diseased with an issue of bloude twelue yeres, came behinde him and touched the hemme of his besture.
For she sayd within her selfe: If maye touche but euen his vesture only, shalbe safe.
But Iesus turned hym about, and when he sawe her, he sayde: doughter be of good co~fort, thy fayth hath made thee safe.
And the woman was made whole euen that same tyme.
And whe~ Iesus came into the rulers house, and sawe the minstrelles and the people makyng a noyse, he sayde vnto them: get you hence, for the mayde is not dead but slepeth.
And they laughed hym to scorne: But when the people were put furth, he went in, and toke her by the hande, and sayd: damosell arise.
EXcept the Lorde builde the house: their labour is but lost that buylde it.
Except the Lorde kepe the citye: the watcheman waketh but in vayne.
It is but lost labour that ye haste to ryse vp early, and so late take reste: and eate the bread of carefulnes, for so he geueth hys beloued slepe.
Lo, children and the fruite of the wombe, are an herytage and gifte: that commeth of the Lorde.
Lyke as the arrowes in the hande of the gyaunt: euen so are the yong children.
Happy is the manne, that hath his quyuer full of them: they shall not be ashamed, when they speake with theyr enemies in the gate.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
STiere vp we beseche thee, lord, the willes of thy faithful people, that they plenteously bringing furth the fruit of good workes: maye of thee be plenteously rewarded: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
The Epistle BEholde the tyme cometh, sayeth the Lorde, that wil raise vp the righteous brau~ch of Dauid, which kyng shal beare rule, and he shal prosper with wisdome, and shall set vp equitie and righteousnes agayne in the earth.
In his tyme shal Iuda be saued, and Israel shal dwell without feare.
And this is the name that they shall call hym: euen the Lorde our righteousnesse: and therfore beholde, the tyme cummeth, sayeth the Lorde, that it shall no more be sayed: the Lorde lyueth, which brought the children of Israel out of the lande of Egipt: But the Lorde liueth which brought furth and lead the seede of the house of Israel out of the north lande, and from al countryes where had scatered them: and they shal dwel in their owne land agayne.
WHen Iesus lift vp his iyes, sawe a great company come vnto him, he sayeth vnto Philip: whence shal we bye bread that these may eate? This he sayd to proue him: for he himselfe knewe what he woulde doe.
Philip aunswered hym: two hundreth peniworthe of bread are not sufficient for them, that euery man may take a litle.
One of his disciples (Andrewe, Simon Peters brother) sayd vnto him: There is a lad here, whiche hath fyue barley loues, and two fyshes: but what are they among so many? And Iesus sayd: make the people sit downe.
So the men sate downe, in noumber about fiue thousande.
And Iesus toke the bread, and when he had geuen thankes, he gaue to the disciples, and the disciples to the~ that were set downe.
And likewise of the fishes as much as they would.
When they had eaten inough, he sayeth vnto his disciples: Gather vp the broken meate which remayneth, that nothing be lost.
And they gathered it together, and filled twelue baskettes with the broken meate of the fyue barley loaues, whiche broken meate remayned vnto them that had eaten.
Then those menne (when they had seen the miracle that Iesus dyd) sayd: this is of a trueth the same Prophete that should come into the worlde. [leaf motif][leaf motif] SAINCT ANdrewes daye.
MAny tymes haue they fought against me from my youth vp: may Israel nowe saye.
Yea many a tyme haue they vexed me from my youth vp: but they haue not preuailed against me.
The plowers plowed vpon my backe: and made long forowes.
But the righteous Lorde: hath hewen the snares of the vngodly in pieces.
Let them be counfounded and turned backward: as many as haue euill will at Sion.
Let them be euen as the grasse growyng vpon the house toppes: whiche withereth afore it be pluckt vp. Wherof the mower filleth not his hande: neyther he that bindeth vp the sheues, his bosome.
So that they whiche goe by, saye not so muche: as the Lorde prosper you, we wishe you good lucke in the name of the Lorde.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.

ALmightie God, whiche haste geuen suche grace to thy Apostle saincte Andrewe, that he counted the sharpe and painful death of the crosse to be an high honour, and a great glory: Graunt vs to take esteme al troubles and aduersities whiche shall come vnto vs for thy sake, as thinges profitable for vs toward the obtayning of euerlasting lyfe: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
YF thou knowledge with thy mouthe, that Iesus is the Lorde, and beleue in thy heart, that God raised hym vp from death, thou shalt bee safe.
For, to beleue with the heart iustifieth: and to knowledge with the mouth maketh a manne safe.
For the scripture sayeth: whosoeuer beleueth on him shal not be confounded: There is no dyfference betwene the Iewe and the Gentile.
For one is Lord of al, which is riche vnto al that cal vpo~ him.
For whosoeuer doeth call on the name of the Lorde, shall be safe.
How then shal they cal on him, on whom they haue not beleued? How shall they beleue on hym, of whom they haue not heard? How shall they heare without a preacher? And how shall they preache, excepte they be sent? As it is written: how beautifull are the feete of them which bryng tidinges of peace, and bring tidinges of good thinges? But they haue not al obeyed to the gospel, for Esay saith: Lord, who hath beleued our sayinges? So the~, faith cummeth by hearing, and hearing cummeth by the worde of God.
But aske: haue they not heard? no doubte their sounde wente out into all landes, and their wordes into the endes of the world.
But demaund whether Israel did knowe or not? first Moses sayeth: will prouoke you to enuye, by them that are no people, by a folishe nacion wyll angre you.

But against Israel he sayeth: all daye long haue stretched furth my handes vnto a people that beleueth not, but speaketh against me.
AS Iesus walked by the sea of Galile, he sawe two brethren: Simon, whiche was called Peter, Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fyshers) and he sayeth vnto them: folowe me, and will make you to become fishers of men.
And they streight way left their nettes, and folowed him.
And when he was gone furth from thence, he sawe other two brethre~, Iames the sonne of Zebede, and Ihon his brother, in the ship with Zebede theyr father, mendyng theyr nettes, and he called them.
And they immediately lefte the shippe and theyr father, and folowed hym.
BLe&s&sed are all they that feare the Lorde: and walke in his wayes.
For thou shalt eate the labors of thine handes: well is thee, and happy shalt thou be.
Thy wyfe shall be as the fruitfull vine: vpon the walles of thyne house.
Thy children lyke the Oliue braunches: round about thy table.
Loe, thus shall the man be blessed: that feareth the Lord.
The Lorde from out of Sion, shall so blesse thee: that thou shalt see Ierusalem in prosperitie all thy lyfe long.
Yea that thou shalt see thy childers children: and peace vpon Israel.

ALmightie euerliuing God, whiche for the more confirmacion of the fayth, didst suffer thy holy Apostle Thomas, to be doubtfull in thy sonnes resurreccion: graunt vs so perfectly, and without al doubt to beleue in thy so~ne Iesus Christe, that our fayth in thy sight neuer be reproued: heare vs, Lorde, through the same Iesus Christe: to whom with thee and the holy gost be all honour. &c.
HOw ye are not straungers nor foreiners: but citezens with the sainctes, and of the householde of God, and are builte vpon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophetes, Iesus Christe himselfe beeing the head corner stone: in whom what building soeuer is coupled together, it groweth vnto an holy temple in the Lorde, in whom ye also are built together, to be an habitacion of God through the holy gost.
THomas one of the twelue, whiche is called Didimus, was not with them when Iesus came.
The other disciples therfore sayde vnto hym: we haue seen the Lord.
But he sayd vnto them: except see in his handes the printe of the nayles, and put my finger into the printe of the nayles, and thrust my hande into his syde, will not beleue.
And after eight dayes, againe his disciples were within, and Thomas with them.
Then came Iesus when the doores were shut, and stode in the middes, and saied: peace be vnto you.
And after that, he sayed to Thomas: bryng thy finger hither, and see my handes, and reache hither thy hande, and thrust it into my syde, and be not faythlesse, but beleuyng.
Thomas aunswered and sayed vnto hym: my Lorde and my God.
Iesus sayed vnto hym: Thomas, because thou haste seen me, thou haste beleued: blessed are they that haue not seen, yet haue beleued.
And many other sygnes truely dyd Iesus in the presence of his disciples, whiche are not written in this booke.
These are written that ye myght beleue that Iesus is Christ the sonne of God, and that (in beleuyng) ye myght haue lyfe through his name.
Will geue thankes vnto thee, Lorde, with my whole hearte, euen before the Gods, wyll syng prayse vnto thee.
will wurshippe towarde thy holy temple, and prayse thy name, because of thy louing kindnes and trueth: for thou haste magnified thy name, and thy worde aboue all thynges.
When called vpon thee, thou heardest me: and enduedst my soule with muche strength.
All the kinges of the earth shall prayse thee, Lorde: for they haue heard the wordes of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the wayes of the Lorde: that great is the glory of the Lorde.
For though the Lorde be hye, yet hath he respecte vnto the lowly: as for the proude, he beholdeth them a farre of.
Though walke in the middest of trouble, yet shalt thou refreshe me: thou shalt stretche forth thine hande vpon the furiousnesse of myne enemies, and thy ryght hande shall saue me.
The Lorde shall make good his louing kindnes toward me: yea thy mercy, Lorde, endureth for euer, despyse not then the workes of thyne owne handes.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.

ANd Saul yet breathyng out threatnynges, and slaughter againste the Disciples of the Lorde, wente vnto the hye priest, and desired of hym letters to carye to Damasco, to the Sinagoges: that if he founde any of this way (whether they were menne or women) he might bring them bound vnto Ierusalem.
And whe~ he iourneyed, it fortuned that as he was come nigh to Damasco, sodenly there shyned rounde aboute hym a light from heauen, and he fel to the earth, heard a voice saying to him: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? And he said: what art thou Lorde? And the Lorde sayde: am Iesus whom thou persecutest.
It is hard for thee to kicke against the pricke.
And he both tre~bling and astonied, sayed: Lord, what wilt thou haue me to doe? And the Lord sayed vnto him: arise and goe into the citie, it shalbe tolde thee what thou must doe.
The men whiche iourneied with him, stode amased, hearing a voyce, but seeing no man.
And Saul arose from the earth, and when he opened his iyes, he sawe no man: But they led hym by the hande, and brought hym into Damasco.
And he was three daies without sight, and neither did eate nor drinke.
And there was a certaine disciple at Damasco, named Ananias, to him sayed the Lord in a vision: Ananias? and he sayd: behold, am here Lord.
And the Lord sayde vnto him: arise and goe into the strete (whiche is called streight) and seke in the house of Iudas, after one called Saul of Tharsus.
For beholde, he prayeth, and hath seen in a vision a manne named Ananias, cumming in to him, putting his handes on him, that he might receiue his sight.
Then Ananias aunswered: Lord, haue heard by many of this man, how muche euill he hath done to thy sainctes at Ierusalem: here he hath aucthoritie of the hye priestes, to bind al that call on thy name.
The Lord sayd vnto him: go thy way, for he is a chose~ vessel vnto me, to beare my name before the Gentiles, and kinges, and the childre~ of Israel.
For wil shewe him, how great thinges he must suffer for my names sake.
And Ananias went his way, and entred into the house, and put his ha~des on him, and sayd: brother Saul, the Lord that appeared vnto thee in the way as thou camest, hath se~t me, that thou mightest receiue thy sight, be filled with the holy gost.
And immediately there fel fro~ his iyes as it had been scales, he receiued sight, and arose, and was baptised, and receiued meate, and was coumforted.
Then was Saul a certayne dayes with the disciples whiche were at Damasco.
And straight way he preached Christe in the Sinagogues, howe that he was the sonne of God.
But all that hearde him were amased, and sayde: is not this he that spoyled them whiche called on this name in Ierusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound vnto the hie priestes? But Saul encreased the more in strength, and confounded the Iewes whiche dwelt at Damasco, affirming that this was very Christe.
PEter aunswered and sayd vnto Iesus: behold, we haue forsaken all, and folowed thee: what shal we haue therfore? Iesus sayde vnto them: Verely say vnto you, that when the sonne of man shall sit in the seate of his Maiestie, ye that haue folowed me in the regeneracion, shall syt also vpon twelue seates, and iudge the twelue tribes of Israel.
And euery one that forsaketh house, or brethren, or systers, or father, or mother, or wyfe, or children, or landes, for my names sake, shall receiue an hundred folde, and shall inherite euerlastyng lyfe.
But many that are first shalbe last, and the last shalbe first.
BEhold (nowe) prayse the Lord all ye seruauntes of the Lorde, ye that by night stand in the house of the Lorde: (euen in the courtes of the house of our God.)

ALmightie and euerlasting God, we humbly beseche thy Maiestie, that as thy onely begotten sonne, was this daye presented in the Temple, in the substaunce of our fleshe: so graunt that we maye bee presented vnto thee with pure and cleare mindes: By Iesus Christe our Lorde.
WHen the time of their Purificacion (after the law of Moses) was come, they broughte hym to Ierusalem, to presente hym to the Lorde (as it is written in the lawe of the Lorde: euerye manne childe that firste openeth the matrix, shalbe called holye to the Lord:) and to offer (as it is sayde in the law of the lord) a payre of turtle Dooues, or two young Pigions.
And beholde, there was a man in Hierusalem, whose name was Simeon.
And the same man was iust and godly, and loked for the consolation of Israel, and the holy gost was in him.
And an aunswere had he receiued of the holy goste, that he should not see death, except he first saw the Lordes Christ.
DElyuer me, Lorde, from the euill manne: and preserue me from the wicked manne.
Which imagine mischiefe in theyr heartes: and stirre vp strife all the day long.
They haue sharpened theyr tongues lyke a Serpente: Adders poyson is vnder theyr lippes.
Kepe me, Lord, from the handes of the vngodly: preserue me from the wicked men, whiche are purposed to ouerthrowe my goinges.
The proude haue layed a snare for me, and spred a net abrode with coardes: yea, and set trappes in my way.
sayd vnto the Lord, thou art my God: heare the voice of my prayers, Lorde.
Lorde God, thou strength of my health: thou haste couered my head in the day of battayl.
Let not the vngodly haue his desire, Lord: let not his mischieuous imaginacion prosper, lest they be to proude.
Lette the myschiefe of theyr owne lyppes fall vpon the head of them: that cumpasse me about.
Lette hoate burnyng coales fall vpon them: let them be caste into the fyer, and into the pyt, that they neuer ryse vp agayne.
manne full of woordes shall not prosper vpon the yearth: euill shall hunte the wicked persone, to ouerthrowe hym.
Sure am that the Lorde will auenge the poore: and maynteyne the cause of the helpelesse.
The righteous also shall geue thankes vnto thy name: and the iust shall continue in thy sight.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.

ALmightye God, whiche in the place of the traytor Iudas, didst chose thy faythfull seruaunte Mathie, to bee of the noumber of thy twelue Apostles: Graunte that thy church being alway preserued from false Apostles, may be ordred and guided by faythfull and true pastors: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
IN those dayes, Peter stode vp in the middes of the disciples, and sayd: (the number of names that were together, were about an .c. and xx.) Ye men and brethren, this scripture must nedes haue beene fulfilled, whiche the holye goste, through the mouth of Dauid, spake before of Iudas, which was guide to them that toke Iesus.
For he was nu~bred with vs, and had obteyned felowship in this ministracion.
And the same hath nowe possessed a plat of grounde, with the rewarde of iniquitie: and when he was hanged, he burst a sunder in the middes, and all hys bowels gushed oute: And it is knowen vnto all the inhabiters of Hierusalem: in so muche that the same fielde is called, in theyr mother tongue, Acheldama, that is to say, the bloude field.
For it is written in the booke of Psalmes: hys habitacion be voyde, and no man be dwelling therin, and hys busshoprike let an other take.
Wherfore, of these men whiche haue companied with vs (all the time that the Lorde Iesus had all his conuersacion among vs, beginnyng at the baptisme of Iohn vnto that same day, that he was take~ vp from vs) must one be ordeyned, to be a witnes with vs of hys resurreccion.
And they appoynted two, Ioseph whiche is called Barsabas (whose syrname was Iustus) and Mathias.
And when they prayed, they sayde: Thou Lorde, whiche knowest the heartes of all men, shew whether of these two thou hast chosen, that he may take the roume of this ministracio~ and Apostleship, from which Iudas by transgression fell, that he might goe to his owne place.
And they gaue furth theyr lottes, and the lot fell on Mathias, and he was coumpted with the eleuen Apostles.
IN that tyme Iesus aunswered, and sayde: thanke thee (O father) lord of heaue~ and earth, because thou haste hyd these thynges from the wyse and prudente, and hast shewed them vnto babes: verely father, euen so was it thy good pleasure.
All thinges are geuen ouer vnto me of my father.
And no man knoweth the sonne, but the father: neyther knoweth anye manne the father, saue the sonne, and he to whomesoeuer the sonne will open him.
Come vnto me all ye that labour and are laden, and wil ease you.
Take my yoke vpon you and learne of me, for am meke and lowly in heart, and ye shall fynde rest vnto your soules, for my yoke is easye, and my burden is light.
doe not exercise myself in great maters: whiche are to hye for me.
But refrayne my soule, and kepe it low, like as a childe that is wayned from his mother: yea, my soule is euen as a wayned childe.
Israell trust in the Lorde: from this time furth, for euermore.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
WE beseche thee lord, powre thy grace into our heartes, that as we haue knowen Christ thy sonnes incarnacion, by the message of an Angel: so by his crosse and passion, we may be broughte vnto the glorye of hys resurreccyon: Through the same Christ our Lorde.
GOd spake once agayne vnto Ahaz, saying: require a token of the lord thy god, whether it be toward the depth beneath, or towarde the heighte aboue.
Then sayde Ahaz: will require none, neyther will tempte the lorde.
And he sayde: hearken to, ye of the house of Dauid, is it not ynoughe for you, that ye bee grieuous vnto men, but ye must grieue my god also? And therfore the Lorde shall geue you a token: Beholde, a virgin shall conceiue and beare a sonne, and his mother shall call his name Emanuel.
Butter and Hony shall he eate, that he may know to refuse the euil and choose the good.
ANd in the sixth moneth, the Aungell Gabriell was sent from god vnto a citie of Galile, named Nazareth, to a virgin spoused to a ma~, whose name was Ioseph, of the house of Dauid, and the virgins name was Mary.
And the Angel went in vnto her said: Hayle ful of grace the Lorde is with thee: Blessed art thou among women.
When she sawe hym, she was abashed at hys saying: and cast in her mind, what maner of salutacion that should be.
And the Angel sayd vnto her: feare not Mary, for thou hast found grace with god: Beholde, thou shalt conceiue in thy wombe, and beare a sonne, and shalt call his name Iesus: He shalbe great, shalbe called the sonne of the hygheste.
And the Lorde God shall geue vnto hym, the seate of his father Dauid, and he shall reigne ouer the house of Iacob for euer, and of his kingdome there shall be none ende.
Then sayd Mary vnto the Angel: How shal this be, seeing know not a man? And the Angel answered and said vnto her: the holy gost shall come vpon thee, and the power of the highest shall ouershadow thee.
Therfore also that holy thing whiche shal be borne, shalbe called the sonne of God.
And beholde, thy cosin Elizabeth, she hath also conceiued a sonne in her age.
And this is her sixth moneth, which was called baren: for with god shall nothing be vnpossible.
And Mary sayd: beholde the handmayde of the Lorde: be it vnto me, accordyng to thy woorde.
LOrd call vpon thee, hast thee vnto me: and considre my voyce when crye vnto thee.
Let my prayer be set furth in thy sighte as the incense: and let the liftyng vp of my handes be an euening Sacrifice.
Set a watche, Lorde, beefore my mouth: and kepe the doore of my lippes.
let not myne hearte be enclyned to any euill thyng: let me not be occupyed in vngodly woorkes, with the men that woorke wickednesse, leste eate of suche thynges as please them.
Let the righteous rather smite me frendely: and reproue me.
But let not theyr precyous Balmes breake myne head: yea will pray yet agaynst theyr wickednes.
Let theyr iudges be ouerthrowen in stonye places: that they may heare my woordes, for they are swete.
Our bones lye scattered before the pitte: Lyke as when one breaketh and heweth wood vpon the earth.
But myne eyes looke vnto thee, Lord God: in thee is my trust, cast not out my soule.
Kepe me from the snare, whiche they haue layed for me: and from the trappes of the wicked dooers.
Let the vngodly fall into theyr owne nettes together: and let me euer escape them.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: world without ende.
ALmyghtye GOD, whiche haste instructed thy holye Churche, with the heauenly doctrine of thy Euangelist Sainct Marke: geue vs grace so to bee establyshed by thy holy gospel, that we be not, like chyldren, caried away with euery blast of vayne Doctrine: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
VNto euerye one of vs is geuen grace accordyng to the measure of the gyfte of Christe.
Wherfore he sayth: when he went vp an hie, he led captiuitie captiue, gaue gyftes vnto menne.
That he ascended, what meaneth it, but that he also descended first into the lowest partes of the earth? he that descended, is euen the same also that asce~ded vp aboue all heauens, to fulfil al thinges.
And the very same made some Apostles, some Prophetes, some Euangelistes, some shepeheardes and teachers: to the edifying of the Saintes, to the woorke ministracion, euen to the edifying of the body of Christe, till we all come to the vnitie of faith, knowledge of the some of god, vnto a perfect man, vnto the measure, of the full perfect age of Christ.

Am the true vine, and my father is an husband man.
Euery braunche that beareth not fruite in me, he wil take away.
And euery braunche that beareth fruite, will he pourge, that it may bring furth more fruite.
Now are ye cleane through the woordes whiche haue spoken vnto you.
As the braunche cannot beare fruite of it selfe, except it bide in the vine: no more can ye, except ye abyde in me.
He that abideth in me, and in him, the same bringeth furth muche fruite.
If a man byde not in me, he is cast furth as a braunche, and is withered: And men gather them, and cast them into the fyer, and they burne.
If ye bide in me, and my woordes abyde in you, aske what ye will, and it shall be dooen for you.
Herein is my father glorifyed, that ye beare muche fruite, and become my Disciples.
As the father hath loued me, euen so haue also loued you.

These thynges haue spoken vnto you, that my ioy might remayne in you, and that your ioye might be full.

Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynnyng, is nowe, and euer shall be: worlde without ende.

My brethren, count it for an exceding ioye, when ye fall into dyuerse temptacions: Knowing this: that the trying of your fayth, gendreth pacience: and let pacience haue her perfect worke, that ye may be perfecte, and sound, lacking nothing.
If any of you lacke wisedome, let hym aske of hym that geueth it: euen God, whiche geueth to all men indifferentlye, and casteth no man in the teeth, and it shalbe geuen hym.
But let hym aske in fayth, and wauer not: for he that doubteth, is lyke a waue of the sea, whiche is tost of the windes, and caried with violence.
Neither let that manne thynke, that he shall receiue any thing of the Lorde.
Let the brother whiche is of lowe degree, reioyce when he is exalted.
Agayne, let him that is riche, reioyce when he is made lowe.
For euen as the flower of the grasse, shall he passe awaye.
For as the sunne riseth with heate, and the grasse withereth, and his flower falleth away, and the beautye of the fashyon of it perisheth: euen so shall the riche manne peryshe in hys wayes.
Happy is the man that endureth temptacion: For when he is tried, he shall receyue the croune of lyfe, whiche the Lorde hath promised to them that loue him.

And yf goe to prepare a place for you, will come againe and receiue you, euen vnto my selfe: that where am, there may ye be also.

Thomas sayeth vnto him: Lorde, we knowe not whether thou goest.
And howe is it possible for vs to knowe the waye? Iesus saieth vnto him: am the waye, the trueth, the lyfe: No man cometh vnto the father but by me: if ye had knowen me, ye had knowen my father also: And nowe ye knowe him, and haue seen him.
Philip sayeth vnto him: Lorde shewe vs the father, and it suffiseth vs. Iesus sayeth vnto him: haue bene so long time with you, and yet haste thou not knowen me? Philip, he that hath sene me, hath sene my father, and howe sayest thou then, shewe vs the father? Beleuest thou not that am in the father, the father in me? The woordes that speake vnto you, speake not of my selfe: But the father that dwelleth in me, is he that doeth the workes.
Beleue me that am in the father, and the father in me.
Verely, verely, say vnto you: he that beleueth on me, the workes that doe, the same shall he doe also, and greater workes then these shall he doe, because go vnto my father.
And whatsoeuer ye aske in my name, that will doe, that the father may be gloryfied by the sonne.

TYdynges of these thinges came vnto the eares of the congregacion, which was in Ierusalem.
And they sent furth Barnabas, that he should goe vnto Antioche.

For he was a good man, and full of the holy gost and of fayth, and muche people was added vnto the Lorde.
And when he had found him, he brought him vnto Antioche.
And it chaunsed, that a whole yere they hadde theyr conuersacion with the congregacion there, taught muche people, insomuche that the disciples of Antioche were the first that were called Christen.
In those dayes came Prophetes from the citie of Hierusalem vnto Antioche.

THys is my commaundement, that ye loue together, as haue loued you: Greater loue hath no man, then this: that a man bestowe his lyfe for his frendes.
Ye are my frendes, yf ye doe whatsoeuer commaunde you.

But you haue called frendes: for all thinges that haue heard of my father, haue opened to you: ye haue not chosen me, but haue chosen you, and ordayned you to goe and bryng furth fruite, and that your fruite shoulde remayne: that whatsoeuer ye aske of the father in my name, he maye geue it you.
HEare my prayer, Lorde, and considre my desire: herken vnto me for thy trueth and righteousnes sake.

let me heare thy louynge kindenesse betymes in the morning, for in thee is my trust: shewe thou me the waye that shoulde walke in, for lift vp my soule vnto thee.
Delyuer me, Lorde, from myne enemies: for flye vnto thee to hyde me.
Teache me to doe the thing that pleaseth thee, for thou art my God: let thy louing spirite leade me forth vnto the lande of righteousnes.

And behold a woman in that citie (whyche was a synner) assone as she knewe that Iesus sate at meate in the Phariseis house, she brought an Alabaster boxe of oyntemente, and stode at his feete behind him weping, and began to washe his feete with teares, and dyd wype them with the heares of her head, and kyssed his feete, and anoynted them with the oyntment.
When the Pharisee (which had bidden him) saw that, he spake within himselfe, saying: if this ma~ were a prophete, he would surely knowe who and what maner of woman this is that touched him, for she is a sinner.
Iesus aunswered and sayed vnto him: Simon, haue somewhat to say vnto thee.
There was a certayne lender whiche had two debters, the one ought him fiue hundreth pence, and the other fiftie.
When they had nothing to pay, he forgaue them bothe.
Tell me therfore, whiche of them will loue him most? Simon aunswered, and sayd: suppose that he to whome he forgaue moste.
And he turned to the woman, and sayde vnto Simon: Seeste thou this woman? entred into thy house, thou gauest me no water for my feete: but she hath washed my feete with teares, and wiped them with the heares of her head.
Thou gaueste me no kysse: but she sence the tyme came in, hath not ceassed to kysse my feete.
My head with oyle thou didst not anoint, but she hath anointed my feete with ointment.
Wherfore say vnto thee: many sinnes are forgiue~ her, for she loued much.
To whome lesse is forgeue~, the same doeth lesse loue.
And he said vnto her: thy sinnes are forgeue~ thee.
And they that sate at meate with him, began to say within themselues.
Who is this which forgeueth sinnes also? And he sayd to the woman.
Prayse the Lorde of heauen: prayse him in the height.
Prayse him all ye angels of his: prayse him all his hoste.

And because he sawe that it pleased the Iewes, he proceded farther and toke Peter also.
THen came to hym the mother of zebedes children, with her sonnes, wurshipping him, and desiring a certayne thing of him.
And he saied vnto her: what wilt thou? She said vnto him: Graunt that these my two sonnes may sit, the one on thy right hand, the other on thy left, in thy kyngdome.
But Iesus answered, and sayd: ye wot not what ye aske.
Are ye able to drinke of the cup that shall drinke of, and to be baptised with the baptisme that am baptised with? They sayd vnto him: we are: He sayd vnto them: ye shal drinke in dede of my cup, be baptized with the baptisme that am baptised with: but to sit on my right ha~de, and on my lefte, is not myne to geue: but it shall chaunce vnto the~ that it is prepared for of my father.
And when the ten heard this, they dysdayned at the two brethren.
But Iesus called them vnto him, said: ye knowe that the princes of the nacions haue dominion ouer the~, and they that are greate men, exercise authoritie vpon them.
But whosoeuer wil be great among you, let him be your minister: whosoeuer will be chiefe among you, lette him be your seruaunt.

They that make them are lyke vnto them: and so are all suche as put their trust in them.
But the house of Israell, trust thou in the Lorde: he is their succour and defence.

The noumber of the~ that beleued in the Lord, both of men weome~, grewe more more: in so muche that they brought the sicke into the stretes, and laied them on beddes and couches, that at the least way the shadow of Peter, whe~ he came by, myght shadow some of them (and that they might al be deliuered from their infirmites.)
There came also a multitude out of the cities rounde about, vnto Ierusalem, bringyng sicke folkes, and them which were vexed with vncleane spirites: And they were healed euery one.
ANd there was a stryfe amonge them which of them shoulde seme to be the greateste.
And he sayd vnto them: the kynges of nacions reigne ouer them, and they that haue authoritie vpon them are called gracious Lordes: But ye shal not be so.
But he that is greatest among you, shalbe as the younger: and he that is chiefe, shal be as he that doeth minister.
For whether is greater he that sitteth at meate, or he that serueth? Is not he that sitteth at meate: But am among you, as he that ministreth.
Ye are they, which haue bidden with me in my temptacions.
And appointe vnto you a kingdome, as my father hath appoynted to me, that ye may eate and drinke at my table in my kingdome, sit on seates iudgeing the twelue Tribes of Israell.
Prayse the lorde all ye heathen: prayse him al ye nacions.
For his mercifull kindnes is euer more and more to warde vs: and the trueth of the Lorde endureth for euer.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: and to the holy gost.
As it was in the beginnyng, is nowe, and euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
ALmightie God, whiche by thy blessed sonne diddest call Mathewe from the receipte of custome to be an Apostle and Eua~gelist: Graunt vs grace to forsake all couetous desyres and inordinate loue of riches, and to folowe thy sayed sonne Iesus Christ: who lyueth and reigneth. &c.
SEyng that we haue suche an office, euen as God hath had mercye on vs, we go not out of kynde, but haue cast from vs the clokes of vnhonestye, and walke not in craftines, neyther handle we the worde of God deceiptfully, but open the trueth, reporte our selues to euery mans conscience in the syght of God.
If our gospell be yet hid, it is hid among them that are lost, in whom the God of this worlde hath blinded the mindes of them, whiche beleue not, leste the light of the gospell of the glory of Christe (whiche is the image of God) should shyne vnto them.
For we preache not our selues, but Christe Iesus to be the Lorde, and oure selues, youre seruauntes, for Iesus sake.
For it is God that commaunded the light to shyne out of darkenes, whiche hath shyned in our heartes, for to geue the lyght of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Iesus Christe.
ANd as Iesus passed forth from thence, he sawe a man (named Mathewe) sitting at the receipt of custome, and hesaid vnto him: folow me.
And it came to passe as Iesus sate at meate in his house: beholde, many Publicans also and sinners that came, sate downe with Iesus and his disciples.
And when the Phariseis sawe it, they said vnto his disciples: why eateth your Maister with Publicanes and sinners? But when Iesus heard that, he saied vnto them: They that be strong nede not the phisicion, but they that are sicke.
Goe ye rather and learne what that meaneth: wil haue mercy, and not sacrifice: for am not come to call the righteous, but synners to repentaunce.
PRay&se the Lorde (ye seruauntes) prayse the name of the Lorde.
Blessed be the name of the Lorde: from this tyme furth for euermore.
The Lordes name is praysed: from the rysyng vp of the Sunne, vnto the goyng downe of the same.
The Lorde is hye aboue all heathen: and his glory aboue the heauens.
Who is lyke vnto the Lorde our God, that hath his dwellyng so hye: and yet humbleth hymselfe to beholde the thinges that are in heauen and earth? He taketh vp the symple out of the dust: and lifteth the poore out of the myre.
That he may set hym with the princes: euen with the princes of his people.
He maketh the baren woman to kepe house: and to be a ioyfull mother of children.
Glorye be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
EVerlasting God, whiche haste ordained and constituted the seruices of all Angels and men in a wonderfull ordre: mercifully graunt that they whiche alwaye doe thee seruice in heauen, may by thy appointment succour and defende vs in earth: through Iesus Christe our Lorde. &c.
THere was a great battaile in heauen: Michael and his Angels fought with the Drago~, and the Dragon fought his Angels, and preuayled not, neither was theyr place found any more in heauen.
And the great Dragon, that olde serpent, called the deuill and Sathanas, was cast out, whiche deceiueth all the worlde.
And he was cast into the earth, and his Angels were cast out also with him.
And heard a loude voyce, saying: in heaue~ is nowe made saluacion and strength, and the kyngdom of our God, and the power of his Christ.
For the accuser of our brethren is cast downe, whiche accused them before our God day and night.
And they ouercame hym by the bloud of the lambe, and by the worde of their testimony, and they loued not their liues vnto the death.
Woe vnto the inhabitours of the earth, and of the sea: for the deuill is come downe vnto you, which hath great wrathe, because he knoweth that he hathe but a shorte tyme.
AT thesame time came the disciples vnto Iesus saying: who is the greatest in the kyngdome of heauen? Iesus called a childe vnto hym, and sette hym in the myddest of them, and sayed: Verely saye vnto you, excepte ye turne and become as children, ye shall not entre into the kyngdome of heauen.
Whosoeuer therfore humbleth hymselfe as this childe, thesame is the greatest in the kyngdome of heauen.
And whosoeuer receyueth suche a childe in my name, receiueth me.
But whoso doth offende one of these lytleons whiche beleue in me, it were better for hym that a milstone were hanged aboute his necke, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea.
Woe vnto the worlde, because of offences: necessary it is that offences come: But woe vnto the manne, by whom the offence cometh.
Wherfore, yf thy hande or thy foote hynder thee, cut him of, and cast it from thee.
It is better for thee to entre into lyfe halt or maimed, rather then thou shouldest (hauing two ha~des or two fete) be cast into euerlasting fyre.
And yf thine iye offende thee, plucke it out, and cast it from thee.
It is better for thee to entre into life with one iye, rather then (hauing .ij. iyes) to be cast into hell fyre.
Take hede that ye despise not one of these lytleons.
For saye vnto you: that in heauen theyr Angels doe alwayes beholde the face of my father, whiche is in heauen.
BY the waters of Babylon we sate downe wept: when we remembred (thee O) Sion.
As for our harpes we hanged them vp: vpon the trees that are therin.
For they that led vs away captiue, required of vs then a song and melodye in our heauines: syng vs one of the songes of Sion.
Howe shall we syng the Lordes song: in a straunge lande? If forget thee, Ierusalem: let my ryght hande forget her cunning.
If doe not remembre thee, let my tong cleaue to the rose of my mouth: yea yf preferre not Ierusalem in my myrth.
Remembre the chyldren of Edom, Lorde, in the day of Ierusalem, howe they sayed: downe with it, downe with it euen to the grounde.
daughter of Babylon, wasted with miserie: yea happye shal he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast serued vs. Blessed shall he be, that taketh thy chyldren: and throweth them against the stones.
Glorye be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
ALmightie God whiche calledst Luke the phisicion, whose prayse is in the gospell, to be a phisicion of the soule: it may please thee by the holsome medicines of his doctrine, to heale al the diseases of oure soules: through thy sonne Iesus Christe oure Lorde.
WAtche thou in all thinges, suffre affliccions, doe the worke throughly of an Euangelist, fulfyll thyne office vnto the vtmoste: be sobre.
For am nowe ready to be offred, and the tyme of my departing is at ha~d.
haue fought a good fyght, haue fulfilled my course, haue kept the faith.
Fro~ hencefurth there is layed vp for me a crowne of righteousnes whiche the Lorde (that is a righteous iudge) shal geue me at that day: not to me only, but vnto all them also that loue his comming.
Doe thy diligence, that thou mayst come shortly vnto me.
For Demas hath forsaken me, and loueth this presente worlde, and is departed vnto Thessalonica.
Crescens is gone to Galacia, Titus vnto Dalmacia, only Lucas is with me.
Take Marke and bring him with thee, for he is profitable vnto me for the ministracion.
And Tychicus haue sent to Ephesus: The cloke that left at Troada with Carpus, when thou commest, bring with thee, and the bookes, but specially the parchement.
Alexander the coppersmith did me muche euill: the Lord rewarde hym accordyng to his dedes, of whom be thou ware also: For he hath greatly withstande our wordes.
THe Lorde appointed other seuenty (and two) also, and sente them two and two before hym into euery citie and place, whither he hymselfe woulde come.
Therfore saied he vnto them: the haruest is greate, but the labourers are fewe.
Praye ye therfore the Lorde of the haruest, to sende furthe labourers into his haruest.
Go your wayes: beholde, sende you foorth as lambes among wolues.
Beare no wallet, neyther scrip, nor shoes, and salute no man by the waye: into whatsoeuer house ye entre, fyrst saye, peace be to this house.
And yf the sonne of peace be there, your peace shal rest vpon him: if not, it shal returne to you agayne.
And in thesame house tary styll, eating and drinkyng suche as they geue.
Prayse God in his holynes: prayse hym in the firmament of his power.
Prayse him in his noble actes: prayse hym accordyng to his excellent greatnesse.
Prayse hym in the sounde of the trumpet: prayse hym vpon the lute and harpe.
Prayse hym in the cymbales and daunse: prayse hym vpon the stringes and pipe.
Prayse hym vpon the well tuned cymbales: prayse hym vpon the loud cymbales.
Glorye be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
ALmightie God, whiche hast builded the congregacion vpon the foundacion of the Apostles and prophetes, Iesu Christ hymselfe beyng the head corner stone: graunte vs so to bee ioyned together in vnitie of spirite by theyr doctrine, that we maye be made an holye temple acceptable to thee: through Iesu Christe oure Lorde.
IVdas the seruaunte of Iesu Christe, the brother of Iames: to them whiche are called and sanctified in God the father, preserued in Iesu Christe: Mercy vnto you, and peace, and loue be multiplied.
Beloued, when gaue all diligence to wryte vnto you of the common saluacion, it was nedefull for me to write vnto you, to exhort you that ye shoulde continuallye laboure in the faith, whiche was once geuen vnto the sainctes.
For there are certain vngodly men craftely crept in, of whiche it was written afore tyme vnto suche iudgement.
They turne the grace of our God vnto wantonnes, and denye God (which is the only lorde) and our lorde Iesus Christ.
My minde is therfore to putte you in remembraunce, for as muche as ye once knowe this, howe that the lorde (after that he had deliuered the people out of Egypt) destroyed them whiche afterward beleued not.
The Angels also whiche kept not theyr firste estate, but lefte their owne habitacion, he hath reserued in euerlastyng chaines vnder darknes, vnto the iudgement of the great daye: euen as Sodom and Gomor, and the Cities aboute them, whiche in lyke maner defiled themselues with fornicacion, and folowed straunge fleshe, are set furth for an exaumple, and suffre the paine of eternall fyre: lykewyse these being deceyued by dreames, defile the fleshe, despise rulers, and speake euell of them that are in auctoritie.
If the world hate you, ye know that it hated me before it hated you.
If ye were of the worlde, the world would loue his owne: howbeit, because ye are not of the worlde, but haue chosen you out of the worlde, therfore the worlde hateth you.
Remembre the worde that sayed vnto you: the seruaunt is not greater then the lorde.
If they haue persecuted me, they wil also persecute you.
If they haue kepte my saying, they will kepe yours also.
But all these thinges will they doe vnto you for my names sake, because they haue not knowen him that sente me.
If had not come and spoken vnto them, they shoulde haue had no synne: but nowe haue they nothing to cloke theyr synne with all.
If had not done among them the workes whiche none other man did, they should haue had no synne.
But nowe haue they both seen and hated: not onely me, but also my father.
But this happeneth that the saying might be fulfilled that is written in theyr lawe.
But when the comforter is come, whom will sende vnto you from the father, euen the spirite of trueth (whiche procedeth of the father) he shal testifie of me.
And ye shall beare witnes also, because ye haue been with me from the beginning.
The first lesson Sapi. iii. vnto blessed is rather the Baren.
Syng vnto the Lorde a newe song: let the congregacion of sainctes prayse hym.
Let Israell reioyce in him that made him: and let the children of Sion be ioyfull in theyr kyng.
Let them prayse his name in the daunce: let them syng prayses vnto him with tabret and harpe.
For the Lord hath pleasure in his people: and helpeth the meke hearted.
Let the sainctes be ioyfull with glory: let them reioyce in their beddes.
Let the prayses of God be in theyr mouth: and a two edged sworde in their handes.

To bynde theyr kynges in chaynes: and theyr nobles with lynkes of yron.
That they may be auenged of them, as it is written: suche honour haue all his Sainctes.
Glorye be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c.
ALmightie GOD, whiche haste knitte together thy electe in one Co~munion and felowship in the misticall body of thy sonne Christe our Lorde: graunt vs grace so to folow thy holy Sainctes in all vertues, and godly liuyng, that we maye come to those vnspeakeable ioyes, whiche thou hast prepared for all them that vnfaynedly loue thee: through Iesus Christe.
BEholde, Iohn sawe an other Angel ascend from the rysyng of the Sunne, whiche had the seale of the liuing God, and he cryed with a loude voyce to the foure Aungels (to who~ power was geuen to hurte the earth and the sea) saying: Hurte not the earth neyther the sea, neyther the trees, tyll we haue sealed the seruauntes of our God, in theyr foreheades.
And heard the noumbre of the~ whiche were sealed, there were sealed an .C. and xliiij.M. of all the tribes of the childre~ of Israel.
After this behelde, and loe, a great multitude (which no manne could nombre) of all nacions, and people, and tongues, stode before the seate, and before the lambe, clothed with long white garmentes, and Palmes in theyr handes, and cried with a loude voyce, saying: saluacion be ascribed to hym that sitteth vpon the seate of our god, and vnto the lambe.
And all the Angels stode in the compasse of the seate, and of the elders, of the foure beastes, and fell before the seate on their faces, and worshipped God, saying: Ame~.
Blessing and glory, and wisedome, and thankes, and honour, and power, and might be vnto our God for euermore.
IE&sus seing the people, we~t vp into the mountaine: and when he was set, his disciples came to hym, after that he hadde opened his mouth, he taughte them, saying: Blessed are the poore in spirite, for theirs is the kyngdome of heauen.
Blessed are they that morne: for they shall receyue comfort.
Blessed are the meke: for they shal receyue the enheritaunce of the earth.
Blessed are they whiche hunger and thirst after righteousnes: for they shall be satisfyed.
Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peace makers: for they shalbe called the children of God.
Blessed are they whiche suffre persecucion for righteousnes sake: for theirs is the kyngdome of heaue~.
Blessed are ye when men reuile you, and persecute you, and shall falsly saye all maner of euill sayinges against you for my sake: reioyce and be glad, for great is youre rewarde in heauen.
For so persecuted they the Prophetes whiche were before you.
[leaf motif]THE SVPPER[leaf motif] of the Lorde, and the holy Communion, commonly called the Masse.
SO many as intende to bee partakers of the holy Communion, shall sygnifie their names to the Curate, ouer night: or els in the morning, afore the beginning of Matins, or immediatly after.
And if any of those be an open and notorious euill liuer, so that the congregacion by hym is offended, or haue doen any wrong to his neighbours, by worde, or dede: The Curate shall cal hym, aduertise hym, in any wise not to presume to the lordes table, vntill he haue openly declared hymselfe, to haue truly repented, and amended his former naughtie life: that the congregacion maie thereby be satisfied, whiche afore were offended: and that he haue recompensed the parties, whom he hath dooen wrong vnto, or at the least bee in full purpose so to doe, as sone as he conueniently maie. [leaf motif]The same ordre shal the Curate vse, with those betwixt whom he perceiueth malice, and hatred to reigne, not suffering them to bee partakers of the Lordes table, vntill he knowe them to bee reconciled.
And yf one of the parties so at variaunce, be content to forgeue from the botome of his hearte, all that the other hath trespaced against him, and to make amendes, for that he hymselfe hath offended: and the other partie will not bee perswaded to a godly vnitie, but remayne still in his frowardnes and malice: The Minister in that case, ought to admit the penitent persone to the holy Communion, and not hym that is obstinate. [leaf motif]Vpon the daie, and at the time appointed for the ministracion of the holy Communion, the Priest that shall execute the holy ministery, shall put vpon hym the vesture appoincted for that ministracion, that is to saye: a white Albe plain, with a vestement or Cope.
And where there be many Priestes, or Deacons, there so many shalbe ready to helpe the Priest, in the ministracion, as shalbee requisite: And shall haue vpon them lykewyse, the vestures appointed for their ministery, that is to saye, Albes, with tunacles.
Then shall the Clearkes syng in Englishe for the office, or Introite, (as they call it) a Psalme appointed for that daye.
The priest standyng humbly afore the middes of the Altar, shall saie the Lordes prayer, with this Collect.
ALmightie GOD, vnto whom all heartes bee open, and all desyres knowen, and from whom no secretes are hid: clense the thoughtes of our heartes, by the inspiracion of thy holy spirite: that we may perfectly loue thee, and worthely magnifie thy holy name: Through Christ our Lord.
Then shall he saye a Psalme appointed for the introite: whiche Psalme ended, the Priest shall saye, or els the Clearkes shall syng. iij. Lorde haue mercie vpon vs. iij. Christ haue mercie vpon vs. iij. Lorde haue mercie vpon vs.
We praise thee, we blesse thee, we worship thee, we glorifie thee, we geue thankes to thee for thy greate glory, Lorde GOD heauenly kyng, God the father almightie.
Lorde the only begotten sonne Iesu Christ, Lorde GOD, Lambe of GOD, sonne of the father, that takest awaye the synnes of the worlde, haue mercie vpon vs: thou that takest awaye the synnes of the worlde, receyue our prayer.
Thou that sittest at the righte hande of God the father, haue mercie vpon vs: For thou onely art holy, thou onelye art the Lorde.
Thou onelye (O Christe) with the holye Ghoste, arte moste highe in the glory of God the father.
Then the priest shall turne hym to the people and saye.
Then shall folowe the Collect of the daye, with one of these two Collectes folowing, for the Kyng.
ALmightie God, whose kyngdom is euerlasting, and power infinite, haue mercie vpon the whole congregacio~, and so rule the heart of thy chosen seruau~t Edward the sixt, our kyng and gouernour: that he (knowyng whose minister he is) maye aboue all thinges, seke thy honour glory, and that we his subiectes (duely consydering whose auctoritie he hath) maye faithfully serue, honour, humbly obey him, in thee, and for thee, according to thy blessed word, and ordinaunce: Through Iesus Christe oure Lorde, who with thee, and the holy ghost, liueth, and reigneth, euer one God, worlde without ende.
ALmightie and euerlasting GOD, wee bee taught by thy holy worde, that the heartes of Kynges are in thy rule and gouernaunce, and that thou doest dispose, and turne them as it semeth best to thy godly wisedom: We humbly beseche thee, so to dispose and gouerne the heart of Edward the sixt, thy seruaunt, our Kyng and gouernour, that in all his thoughtes, wordes, and workes, he maye euer seke thy honour and glory, and study to preserue thy people, committed to his charge, in wealth, peace, and Godlynes: Graunt this, merciful father, for thy dere sonnes sake, Iesus Christ our Lorde.
The Collectes ended, the priest, or he that is appointed, shall reade the Epistle, in a place assigned for the purpose, saying.
The Epistle of sainct Paule written in the span blank] Chapiter of span blank] to the span blank].
Immediatly after the Epistle ended, the priest, or one appointed to reade the Gospell, shall saye.
The holy Gospell written in the span blank] Chapiter of span blank].
The Priest or deacon then shall reade the Gospell: After the Gospell ended, the priest shall begin.
The father almightie maker of heauen and yearth, and of all thinges visible, and inuisible: And in one Lorde Iesu Christ, the onely begotten sonne of God, begotten of his father before all worldes, God of GOD, light of light, very God of very God, begotten, not made, beeyng of one substaunce with the father, by whom all thinges were made, who for vs men, and for our saluacion, came downe from heauen, and was incarnate by the holy Ghoste, of the Virgin Mary, and was made manne, and was Crucified also for vs vnder Poncius Pilate, he suffered and was buried, and the thirde daie he arose again according to the scriptures, and ascended into heaue~, and sitteth at the right hande of the father: And he shall come again with glory, to iudge both the quicke and the dead.
And beleue in the holy ghost, the Lorde and geuer of life, who procedeth fro~ the father and the sonne, who with the father and the sonne together, is worshipped and glorified, who spake by the Prophetes.
And loke for the resurreccion of the deade: and the lyfe of the worlde to come.
Â¶After the Crede ended, shall folowe the Sermon or Homely, or some porcion of one of the Homelies, as they shalbe hereafter deuided: wherin if the people bee not exhorted to the worthy receyuing of the holy Sacrament of the bodye and bloude of our sauiour Christ: then shall the Curate geue this exhortacion, to those that be minded to receiue the same.
DErely beloued in the Lord, ye that minde to come to the holy Co~munion of the bodie bloud of our sauiour Christ, must co~sidre what S. Paule writeth to the Corinthians, how he exhorteth all persones diligently to trie and examine themselues, before thei presume to eate of that breade, and drynke of that cup: for as the benefite is great, yf with a truly penitent heart, and lyuely fayth, we receyue that holy Sacrament: (for then we spiritually eate the fleshe of Christe, and drynke his bloude, then we dwel in Christ and Christ in vs, wee bee made one with Christ, Christ with vs) so is the daunger great, yf we receyue the same vnworthely, for then wee become gyltie of the body and bloud of Christ our sauiour, we eate and drynke our owne damnacion, not consideryng the Lordes bodie.
We kindle Gods wrathe ouer vs, we prouoke hym to plague vs with diuerse diseases, and sondery kyndes of death.
Therfore yf any here be a blasphemer, aduouterer, or bee in malice, or enuie, or in any other greuous cryme (excepte he be truely sory therefore, and earnestly mynded to leaue the same vices, and do trust hym selfe to bee reconciled to almightie God, and in Charitie with all the worlde) lette hym bewayle his synnes, and not come to that holy table, lest after the takyng of that most blessed breade: the deuill enter into hym, as he dyd into Iudas, to fyll hym full of all iniquitie, and brynge hym to destruccion, bothe of body and soule.
Iudge therfore your selfes (brethren) that ye bee not iudged of the lorde.
Let your mynde be without desire to synne, repent you truely for your synnes past, haue an earnest and lyuely faith in Christe our sauior, be in perfect charitie with all men, so shall ye bee mete partakers of those holy misteries.
And aboue all thynges: ye must geue moste humble and heartie thankes to God the father, the sonne, and the holy ghoste, for the redempcion of the worlde, by the death and passion of our sauior Christe, both God and man, who did humble hymselfe euen to the death vpon the crosse, for vs miserable synners, whiche laye in darknes and shadowe of death, that he myghte make vs the children of God, and exalte vs to euerlastyng lyfe.
And to thend that wee shoulde alwaye remembre the excedyng loue of oure maister, and onely sauior Iesu Christe, thus dying for vs, and the innumerable benefites, whiche (by his precious bloudshedyng) he hath obteigned to vs, he hath lefte in those holy Misteries, as a pledge of his loue, and a continuall all remembraunce of thesame his owne blessed body, precious bloud, for vs to fed vpon spiritually, to our endles comfort and consolacion.
To him therfore with the father and the holy ghost, let vs geue (as we are most bounden) co~tinual thankes, submitting our selfes wholy to his holy wyll and pleasure, and studying to serue hym in true holines and righteousnes, all the dayes of our lyfe.
Â¶In Cathedral churches or other places, where there is dailie Communion, it shall be sufficient to reade this exhortacion aboue written, once in a moneth.
And in parish churches, vpon the weke daies it may be lefte vnsayed.
Â¶And if vpon~ the Sonday or holy daye, the people be negligent to come to the Communion: Then shall the Priest earnestly exhorte his parishoners, to dispose themselfes to the receiuing of the holy co~munion more dilige~tly, saiyng these or like wordes vnto the~.
DEre frendes, and you especially vpon whose soules haue cure and charge, on [undefined span blank] next, do intende by Gods grace, to offre to all suche as shalbe godlye disposed, the moste comfortable Sacrament of the body and bloud of Christe, to be taken of them, in the remembraunce of his moste fruitfull and glorious Passion: by the whiche passion, we haue obteigned remission of our sinnes, and be made partakers of the kyngdom of heauen, whereof we bee assured and asserteigned, yf wee come to the sayde Sacrament, with heartie repentaunce for our offences, stedfast faithe in Goddes mercye, and earnest minde to obeye Goddes wyll, and to offende nomore.
Wherefore our duetie is to come to these holy misteries, with moste heartie thankes to bee geuen to almightie GOD, for his infinite mercie and benefites geuen and bestowed vpon vs his vnworthie seruauntes, for whom he hath not onely geuen his body to death, and shed his bloude, but also doth vouchsaue in a Sacrament and Mistery, to geue vs his sayed bodye and bloud to feede vpon spiritually.
The whiche Sacrament being so Diuine and holy a thing, and so comfortable to them whiche receiue it worthilye, and so daungerous to them that wyll presume to take thesame vnworthely: My duetie is to exhorte you in the meane season, to consider the greatnes of the thing, and to serche and examine your owne consciences, and that not lyghtly nor after the maner of dissimulers with GOD: But as they whiche shoulde come to a moste Godly and heauenly Banket, not to come but in the mariage garment required of God in scripture: that you may (so muche as lieth in you) be founde worthie to come to suche a table.
First that you be truly repentaunt of your former euill lyfe, and that you confesse with an vnfained hearte to almightie God, youre synnes and vnkyndnes towardes his Maiestie committed, eyther by wyll, worde, or dede, infirmitie or ignoraunce: and that with inward sorowe and teares you bewaile your offences, and require of almightie god, mercie and pardo~, promising to him (from the botome of your heartes) thamendment of your former lyfe.
And emonges all others, am commaunded of God, especially to moue and exhorte you, to reconcile your selfes to your neyghbours, whom you haue offended, or who hath offended you, putting out of your heartes all hatred and malice against them, and to be in loue and charitie with all the worlde, and to forgeue other, as you would that god should forgeue you.
And yf any man haue doen wrong to any other: let hym make satisfaccion, and due restitucion of all landes goodes, wrongfully taken awaye or withholden, before he come to Goddes borde, or at the least be in full mynde and purpose so to do, assone as he is able, or els let hym not come to this holy table, thinking to deceiue God, who seeth all mennes heartes.
For neyther the absolucion of the priest, can any thing auayle them, nor the receyuyng of this holy sacrament doth any thyng but increase their damnacion.
And yf there bee any of you, whose conscience is troubled and greued in any thing, lackyng comforte or counsaill, let hym come to me, or to some other discrete and learned priest, taught in the lawe of God, and confesse and open his sinne and griefe secretly, that he maie receiue suche ghostly counsail, aduise, and comfort, that his conscience maye be releued, and that of vs (as of the Ministers of GOD and of the churche) he may receyue comforte and absolucion, to the satisfaccion of his minde, and auoydyng of all scruple and doubtfulnes: requiryng suche as shalbe satisfied with a generall confession, not to be offended with them that do vse, to their further satisfying, the auriculer and secrete confession to the Priest: nor those also whiche thinke nedefull or conuenient, for the quietnes of their owne consciences, particulerly to open theyr sinnes to the Priest: to be offended with them that are satisfyed, with their humble confession to GOD, and the generall confession to the churche.
But in all thinges to folowe and kepe the rule of charitie, and euery man to be satisfyed with his owne conscience, not iudging other mennes mindes or consciences: where as he hath no warrant of Goddes word to thesame.
Â¶Then shall folowe for the Offertory, one or mo, of these Sentences of holy scripture, to be song whiles the people dooe offer, or els one of theim to bee saied by the minister, immediatly afore the offeryng.
Let your light so shine before me~, that they may see your good woorkes, and glorify your father which is in heauen.
Laye not vp for your selues treasure vpon the yearth, where the ruste and mothe dothe corrupte, and where theues breake through and steale: But laie vp for your selfes treasures in heauen, where neyther ruste nor mothe dothe corrupt, and where theues do not breake through nor steale.
Whatsoeuer you woulde that menne shoulde doe vnto you, euen so do you vnto them, for this is the lawe and the Prophetes.
Not euery one that sayeth vnto me, lorde, lorde, shall entre into the kyngdome of heauen, but he that dothe the will of my father whiche is in heauen.
Zache stode furthe, and sayed vnto the Lorde: beholde Lorde, the halfe of my goodes geue to the poore, and yf haue doen any wronge to any man, restore foure folde.
Who goeth a warfare at any tyme at his owne coste? who planteth a vineiarde, and eateth not of the fruite therof? Or who fedethe a flocke, and eateth not of the milke of the flocke? If we haue sowen vnto you spirituall thinges, is it a great matter yf we shall reape your worldly thinges? Dooe ye not knowe, that they whiche minister aboute holy thinges, lyue of the Sacrifice? They whiche waite of the alter, are partakers with the alter? euen so hath the lorde also ordained: that they whiche preache the Gospell, shoulde liue of the Gospell.
He whiche soweth litle, shall reape litle, and he that soweth ple~teously, shall reape plenteously.
Let euery manne doe accordynge as he is disposed in his hearte, not grudgyngly, or of necessitie, for God loueth a chereful geuer.
Let hym that is taughte in the woorde, minister vnto hym that teacheth, in all good thinges.
While we haue tyme, let vs doe good vnto all men, and specially vnto them, whiche are of the housholde of fayth.
Godlynes is greate riches, yf a man be contented with that he hath: For we broughte nothyng into the worlde, neither maye we cary any thing out.
Charge them whiche are riche in this worlde, that they be ready to geue, and glad to distribute, laying vp in stoare for themselues a good foundacion, against the time to come, that they maie attain eternall lyfe.
GOD is not vnrighteous, that he will forgette youre woorkes and labor, that procedeth of loue, whiche loue ye haue shewed for his names sake, whiche haue ministred vnto the sainctes, and yet do minister.
To do good, and to distribute, forget not, for with suche Sacrifices God is pleased.
Whoso hath this worldes good, and seeth his brother haue nede, and shutteth vp his compassion from hym, how dwelleth the loue of God in him? Geue almose of thy goodes, and turne neuer thy face from any poore man, and then the face of the lord shall not be turned awaye from thee.
Bee mercifull after thy power: if thou haste muche, geue plenteously, yf thou hast litle, do thy diligence gladly to geue of that litle, for so gathereste thou thy selfe a good rewarde in the daie of necessitie.
He that hath pitie vpon the poore, lendeth vnto the Lord: loke what he laieth out, it shalbe paied him again.
Blessed be the man that prouideth for the sicke and nedy, the lorde shall deliuer hym, in the tyme of trouble.
Where there be Clearkes, thei shall syng one, or many of the sentences aboue written, accordyng to the length and shortenesse of the tyme, that the people be offeryng.
In the meane tyme, whyles the Clearkes do syng the Offertory, so many as are disposed, shall offer to the poore mennes boxe euery one accordynge to his habilitie and charitable mynde.
And at the offeryng daies appoynted, euery manne and woman shall paie to the Curate, the due and accustomed offerynges.
Then so many as shalbee partakers of the holy Communion, shall tarye still in the quire, or in some conueniente place nigh the quire, the men on the one side, and the women on the other syde.
All other (that mynde not to receiue the said holy Communion) shall departe out of the quire, except the ministers and Clearkes.
Than shall the minister take so muche Breade and Wine, as shall suffice for the persons appoynted to receiue the holy Communion, laiyng the breade vpon the corporas, or els in the paten, or in some other comely thyng, prepared for that purpose: And putting ye wine into the Chalice, or els in some faire or conueniente cup, prepared for that vse (if the Chalice wil not serue) puttyng therto a litle pure and cleane water: And setting both the bread and wyne vpon the Alter: Then the Prieste shall saye.
IT is very mete, righte, and our bounden dutie, that we shoulde at all tymes, and in all places, geue thankes to thee, Lorde, holy father, almightie euerlasting God.
Â¶Here shall folowe the propre preface, accordyng to the tyme (if there bee any specially appointed) or els immediatly shall folowe.
BEcau&se thou diddeste geue Iesus Christe, thyne onely sonne to be borne as this daie for vs, who by the operacio~ of the holy ghoste, was made very man, of the substaunce of the Virgin Mary his mother, that without spotte of sinne, to make vs cleane from all sinne.
Therfore. &c. Vpon Easter daie BVt chiefly are we bounde to prayse thee, for the glorious resurreccion of thy sonne Iesus Christe, our Lorde, for he is the very Pascall Lambe, whiche was offered for vs, and hath taken awaye the synne of the worlde, who by his death hath destroyed death, and by his risyng to lyfe againe, hath restored to vs euerlastinge lyfe.
THrough thy moste dere beloued sonne, Iesus Christe our Lord, who after his moste glorious resurreccio~, manifestly appered to all his disciples, and in theyr sighte ascended vp into heauen, to prepare a place for vs, that where he is, thither mighte we also ascende, and reigne with him in glory.
THroughe Iesus Christe our Lorde, accordynge to whose moste true promyse, the holy Ghoste came doune this daye from heauen, with a sodaine great sounde, as it had been a mightie wynde, in the lykenes of fiery toungues, lightynge vpon the Apostles, to teache them, and to leade them to all truethe, geuyng them bothe the gifte of diuerse languages, and also boldnes with feruente zeale, constantly to preache the Ghospell vnto all nacions, whereby we are brought out of darkenes and error, into the cleare light and true knowledge of thee, and of thy sonne Iesus Christ.
IT is very meete, righte, and our bounden duetie, that we should at all tymes, and in all places, geue thankes to thee, Lorde almightie, euerlastinge God, which arte one God, one Lorde, not one onely person, but three persones in one substaunce: For that whiche we beleue of the glory of the father, thesame we beleue of the sonne, and of the holy ghoste, without any difference, or inequalitie: whom the Angels.
Therfore with Angels and Archangels, and with al the holy companie of heauen: we lande and magnifye thy glorious name, euermore praysyng thee, and sayinge: Holy, holy, holy, Lorde God of Hostes: heauen and earth are full of thy glory: Osanna in the higheste.
Blessed is he that commeth in the name of the Lorde: Glory to thee, lorde, in the highest.
Â¶When the Clearkes haue doen syngyng, then shall the Priest, or Deacon, turne hym to the people and saye.
Let vs praye for the whole state of Christes churche.
Â¶Then the Priest turning hym to the Altar, shall saye or syng, plainly and distinctly, this prayer folowyng.
ALmightie and euerlyuyng God, whiche by thy holy Apostle haste taught vs to make prayers and supplicacions, and to geue thankes for all menne: We humbly beseche thee moste mercyfully to receyue these our prayers: whiche we offre vnto thy diuine Maiestie, besechyng thee to inspire continually the vniuersall churche, with the spirite of truethe, vnitie and concorde: And graunt that all they that doe confesse thy holye name, maye agre in the trueth of thy holye worde, and liue in vnitie and godly loue.
Speciallye wee beseche thee to saue and defende thy seruaunte, Edwarde our Kynge, that vnder him we maye be Godly and quietely gouerned.
And graunte vnto his whole cou~saile, and to all that bÃ©e put in authoritie vnder hym, that they maye truely and indifferently minister iustice, to the punishment of wickednesse and vice, to the maintenaunce of Goddes true religion and vertue.
Geue grace (O heauenly father) to all Bishoppes, Pastors, and Curates, that they maie bothe by their life and doctrine, set furthe thy true liuely worde, and rightely and duely administer thy holye Sacramentes.
And to all thy people geue thy heauenly grace, that with meke hearte and due reuerence, they maye heare and receiue thy holy worde, truely seruynge thee in holynes and righteousnes, all the dayes of their lyfe.
And wee moste humbly beseche thee of thy goodnes (O Lorde) to coumforte and succoure all the~, whych in this transitory lyfe bee in trouble, sorowe, nede, sycknes, or any other aduersitie.
And especially we commend vnto thy mercifull goodnes, thys congregacion whyche is here assembled in thy name, to celebrate the commemoracion of the moste glorious deathe of thy sonne: And here wee doe geue vnto thee moste high praise, heartie thankes, for the wonderfull grace and vertue, declared in all thy sainctes, from the begynninge of the worlde: And chiefly in the glorious and most blessed virgin Mary, mother of thy sonne Iesu Christ our Lord and God, in the holy Patriarches, Prophetes, Apostles, and Martirs, whose examples (O Lorde) and stedfastnes in thy faythe, and keping thy holye commaundementes, graunte vs to folowe.
We commende vnto thy mercye (O Lord) all other thy seruauntes, whiche are departed hence from vs, with the signe of fayth, and nowe do reste in the slepe of peace: Graunte vnto them, we beseche thee, thy mercy, and euerlastyng peace, and that at the daie of the generall resurreccion, we and all they whyche bee of the misticall body of thy sonne, maye altogether bee set on his right hand, and heare that his most ioyful voice: Come vnto me, ye that be blessed of my father, and possesse the kingdome, whiche is prepared for you, from the begynning of the worlde: Graunte this, father, for Iesus Christes sake, our onely mediatour and aduocate.
God heauenly father, whiche of thy tender mercie, diddeste geue thine only sonne Iesu Christ, to suffer deathe vpon the crosse for our redempcion, who made there (by his one oblacion once offered) a full, perfect, and sufficiente sacrifyce, oblacion, and satisfaccion, for the sinnes of the whole worlde, and did institute, and in his holy Ghospell commaunde vs, to celebrate a perpetuall memorye, of that his precious deathe, vntyll his comming againe: Heare vs (o mercifull father) we beseche thee: and with thy holy spirite and worde vouchsafe to blÂesse and sancÂtifie these thy gyftes, and creatures of breade and wyne, that they maye be vnto vs the bodye and bloud of thy moste derely beloued sonne Iesus Christe.
Who in the same nyghte that he was betrayed: tooke breade, and when he had blessed, and geuen thankes: he brake it, and gaue it to hys disciples, saiynge: Take, eate, this is my bodye whiche is geuen for you: do this in remembraunce of me.
Likewyse after supper he toke the cuppe, and whe~ he had geuen thankes, he gaue it to them, saiyng: drynke ye all of this, for this is my bloude of the newe Testament, whyche is shed for you and for many, for remission of sinnes: do this as oft as you shall drinke it, in remembraunce of me.
These wordes before rehersed are to be saied, turning still to the Altar, without any eleuacion, or shewing the Sacrament to the people.
WHerefore, Lorde and heauenly father, accordyng to the Instytucyon of thy derely beloued sonne, our sauioure Iesu Christe, we thy humble seruauntes doe celebrate, and make here before thy diuine Maiestie, with these thy holy giftes, the memory all whyche thy sonne hath willed vs to make: hauing in remembraunce his blessed passion, mightie resurreccion, and glorious ascencion, renderynge vnto thee moste heartye thankes, for the innumerable benefytes procured vnto vs by thesame, entyerely desyrynge thy fatherly goodnes, mercifully to accepte thys our Sacrifice of praise and thankes geuinge: moste humblye besechinge thee to graunte, that by the merites and deathe of thy sonne Iesus Christ, and through faith in his bloud, wee and all thy whole church, may obteigne remission of our sinnes, and al other benefites of his passion.
And here wee offre and present vnto thee (O Lord) oure selfe, oure soules, and bodies, to be a reasonable, holy, and liuely sacrifice vnto thee: humbly besechyng thee, that whosoeuer shalbee partakers of thys holy Communion, maye worthely receiue the moste precious body and bloude of thy sonne Iesus Christe: and bee fulfilled with thy grace and heauenly benediction, and made one bodye with thy sonne Iesu Christe, that he maye dwell in them, and they in hym.
And although we be vnworthy (through our manyfolde synnes) to offre vnto thee any Sacrifice: Yet we beseche thee to accepte this our bounden duetie and seruice, and commaunde these our prayers and supplicacions, by the Ministery of thy holy Angels, to be brought vp into thy holy Tabernacle before the syght of thy diuine maiestie: not waying our merites, but pardoning our offences, through Christe our Lorde, by whom, and with whom, in the vnitie of the holy Ghost: all honour and glory, be vnto thee, father almightie, world without ende.
AS our sauiour Christe, hath commaunded and taught vs, we are bolde to saye.
Our father whiche art in heauen, halowed be thy name.
Thy wyll be doen in yearth, as it is in heauen.
And forgeue vs our trespaces, as wee forgeue them that trespasse against vs.
CHri&st our Pascal la~be is offred vp for vs, once for al, when he bare our sinnes on his body vpo~ the crosse, for he is the very lambe of God, that taketh away the sinnes of the worlde: wherfore let vs kepe a ioyfull and holy feast with the Lorde.
Here the prieste shall turne hym towarde those that come to the holy Communion, and shall saye.
YOu that do truely and earnestly repent you of your synnes to almightie God, and be in loue and charitie with your neyghbours, and entende to leade a newe life, folowing the co~maundementes of God, and walkyng from hencefurth in his holy wayes: drawe nere and take this holy Sacrament to your comforte, make your humble confession to almightie God, and to his holy churche here gathered together in his name, mekely knelyng vpon your knees.
Then shall this generall Confession bee made, in the name of all those that are minded to receyue the holy Communion, eyther by one of them, or els by one of the ministers, or by the Prieste hymselfe, all kneling humbly vpon their knees.
ALmightie GOD, father of oure Lorde Iesus Christ, maker of all thinges, iudge of all menne, we knowlege and bewayle our manifold sinnes and wyckednes, whiche we from tyme to tyme, most greuously haue committed, by thoughte, woorde and dede, agaynste thy diuine maiestie, prouokyng moost iustely thy wrath and indignacion againste vs: we do earnestly repent, and be hartely sory for these oure misdoinges, the remembraunce of them is greuous vnto vs, the burthen of them is intollerable: haue mercie vpon vs, haue mercie vpon vs, moste mercifull father, for thy sonne our Lorde Iesus Christes sake, forgeue vs all that is past, and graunt that we may euer hereafter, serue and please thee in newnes of life, to the honour and glory of thy name: Through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
Then shall the Prieste stande vp, and turning hymselfe to the people, say thus.
ALmightie GOD our heauenly father, who of his great mercie, hath promysed forgeuenesse of synnes to all them, whiche with heartye repentaunce and true fayth turne vnto hym: haue mercy vpon you, pardon and deliuer you from all your sinnes, confirme and strengthen you in all goodnes, and bring you to euerlasting lyfe: through Iesus Christ our Lord.
Heare what coumfortable woordes our sauiour Christe sayeth, to all that truely turne to him.
Come vnto me all that trauel and bee heauy laden, and shal refreshe you.
So God loued the world that he gaue his onely begotten sonne, to the ende that all that beleue in hym, shoulde not perishe, but haue lyfe euerlastyng.
This is a true saying, and worthie of all men to be receyued, that Iesus Christe came into this worlde to saue sinners.
If any man sinne, we haue an aduocate with the father, Iesus Christe the righteous, and he is the propiciacion for our sinnes.
Then shall the Prieste, turning hym to gods boord, knele down, and saye in the name of all them, that shall receyue the Communion, this prayer folowing.
WE doe not presume to come to this thy table (o mercifull lorde) trustinge in our owne righteousnes, but in thy manifold and great mercies: we be not woorthie so muche as to gather vp the cromes vnder thy table, but thou art the same lorde whose propertie is alwayes to haue mercie: Graunte vs therefore (gracious lorde) so to eate the fleshe of thy dere sonne Iesus Christe, and to drinke his bloud in these holy Misteries, that wee maye continually dwell in hym, and he in vs, that oure synful bodyes may bee made cleane by his body, and our soules washed through his most precious bloud.
Then shall the Prieste firste receiue the Communion in both kindes himselfe, and next deliuer it to other Ministers, yf any be there present (that they may bee ready to helpe the chiefe Minister) and after to the people.
Â¶And when he deliuereth the Sacrament of the body of Christ, he shall saye to euery one these wordes.
The body of our Lorde Iesus Christ which was geuen for thee, preserue thy bodye and soule vnto euerlastyng lyfe.
And the Minister deliuering the Sacrament of the bloud, and geuing euery one to drinke once and no more, shall saye.
The bloud of our Lord Iesus Christe whiche was shed for thee, preserue thy bodye and soule vnto euerlastinge lyfe.
If there be a Deacon or other Priest, then shall he folowe with the Chalice: and as ye prist ministreth the Sacrame~t of the body, so shal he (for more expedicion) minister ye Sacrament of the bloud, in fourme before written.
lambe of god that takeste awaye the synnes of the worlde: haue mercie vpon vs. lambe of god that takeste awaye the synnes of the worlde: graunt vs thy peace.
Beginning so soone as the Priest doeth receiue the holy Communio~: and when the Communio~ is ended, then shal the Clarkes syng the post Communion.
Â¶Sente~ces of holy scripture, to be said or song euery daie one, after the holy Communion, called the post Communion.
If any man will folowe me, let him forsake hymselfe, and take vp his crosse and folowe me.
Praysed be the Lorde god of Israell, for he hath visyted and redemed his people: therefore let vs serue hym all the dayes of our life, in holines and righteousnes accepted before hym.
Happie are those seruauntes, whome the Lorde (when he cummeth) shall fynde wakyng.
Be ye readye, for the sonne of manne wyll come, at an hower when ye thinke not.
The seruaunte that knoweth hys maisters wyll, and hath not prepared hymselfe, neyther hath doen accordynge to his will, shalbe beaten with many stripes.
The howre cummeth and now it is, when true woorshippers shall woorship the father in spirite and truethe.
Beholde, thou art made whole, sinne no more, leste any wurse thing happen vnto thee.
If ye shall continue in my worde, then are ye my very disciples, and ye shall knowe the trueth, and the trueth shall make you free.
While ye haue lighte, beleue on the lyght, that ye may be the children of light.
He that hath my commaundementes, and kepeth them, thesame is he that loueth me.
If any man loue me, he will kepe my woorde, and my father will loue hym, and we will come vnto hym, and dwell with him.
If ye shal byde in me, and my woorde shal abyde in you, ye shall aske what ye will, and it shall bee doen to you.
Herein is my father glorified, that ye beare muche fruite, and become my disciples.
This is my commaundement, that you loue together, as haue loued you.
If God be on our syde, who can be against vs? whiche did not spare his owne sonne, but gaue hym for vs all.
Who shall lay any thing to the charge of Goddes chosen? it is GOD that iustifyeth, who is he that can condemne? The nyghte is passed, and the daye is at hande, let vs therfore caste away the dedes of darkenes, and put on the armour of light.
Christe Iesus is made of GOD, vnto vs, wisedome, and righteousnes, and sanctifying, and redempcion, that (accordyng as it is written) he whiche reioyceth shoulde reioyce in the Lorde.
Knowe ye not that ye are the temple of GOD, and that the spirite of GOD dwelleth in you? yf any manne defile the temple of GOD, him shall God destroy.
Ye are derely bought, therfore glorifie God in your bodies, and in your spirites, for they belong to God.
Be you folowers of God as deare children, and walke in loue, euen as Christe loued vs, and gaue hymselfe for vs an offeryng and a Sacrifice of a swete sauoure to God.
Then the Priest shall geue thankes to God, in the name of all them that haue communicated, turning hym first to the people, and saying.
ALmightie and euerlyuynge GOD, wee moste hartely tha~ke thee, for that thou hast vouch safed to feede vs in these holy Misteries, with the spirituall foode of the moste precious body bloude of thy sonne, our sauiour Iesus Christ, and hast assured vs (duely receyuing the same) of thy fauour and goodnes toward vs, and that we be very membres incorporate in thy Mistical bodie, which is the blessed companye of all faithfull people: and heyres throughe hope, of thy euerlastynge kingdome, by the merites of the moste precious deathe and passion, of thy deare sonne.
We therefore moste humbly beseche thee, heauenly father, so to assiste vs wyth thy grace, that we may co~tinue in that holy felowship, and doe all suche good woorkes, as thou haste prepared for vs to walke in: through Iesus Christe our Lord, to whom with thee, and the holy goste, bee all honour and glorye, worlde without ende.
Then the Prieste turning hym to the people, shall let them depart with this blessing.
The peace of GOD (which passeth all vnderstandyng) kepe your heartes and mindes in the knowledge and loue of GOD, and of his sonne Iesus Christ our lord.
And the blessing of God almightie, the father, the sonne, the holy gost, be emonges you, and remayne with you alway.
Where there are no clearkes, there the Priest shall saye all thynges appointed herefor them to syng.
When the holy Communion is celebrate, on the workedaye, or in priuate howses: Then may be omitted, the Gloria in excelsis, the Crede, the Homely, and the exhortacion, beginning.
Dearely beloued. &c. Â¶Collectes to be sayed after the Offertory, when there is no Communion, euery suche day one.
AS&si&st vs mercifully, Lord, in these our supplicacio~s and prayers, and dispose the way of thy seruauntes, toward the attainement of euerlasting saluacion: that emonge all the chaunges and chaunces of this mortall life, thei may euer be defended by thy moste gracious and readye helpe: throughe Christe our Lorde.
Almightie Lorde and euerlyuyng GOD, vouchesafe, we beseche thee, to direct, sanctifye, and gouerne, bothe our heartes and bodies, in the wayes of thy lawes, and in the woorkes of thy commaundementes: that through thy most mightie proteccion, both here and euer, we may be preserued in body and soule: Through our Lorde and sauiour Iesus Christe.
GRaunt we beseche thee almightie god, that the wordes whiche wee haue hearde this daye with our outwarde eares, may throughe thy grace, bee so grafted inwardly in our heartes, that they may bryng foorth in vs, the fruite of good lyuynge, to the honoure and prayse of thy name: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
PReuente vs, lorde, in all our doinges, with thy moste gracious fauoure, and further vs with thy continuall helpe, that in al our workes begonne, continued, and ended in thee: we may glorifye thy holy name, and finally by thy mercy obteine euerlasting lyfe: Through.
&c. ALmightie God, the fountayne of all wisdome, whyche knowest our necessities before we aske, and our ignoraunce in asking: we beseche thee to haue compassion vpon our infirmities, and those thinges whiche for our vnwoorthines we dare not, and for our blyndnes we cannot aske, vouchsaue to geue vs for the woorthines of thy sonne Iesu Christe our Lorde.
ALmightie god, whiche haste promised to heare the petitions of them that aske in thy sonnes name, we beseche thee mercifully to incline thyne eares to vs that haue made nowe our prayers and supplicacions vnto thee: and graunte that those thinges which we haue faithfullye asked accordyng to thy will, maye effectually be obteyned to the reliefe of oure necessitye, and to the settyng foorth of thy glorie: Throughe Iesus Christe our Lorde.
God heauenly father, whiche by thy sonne Iesu Christ, haste promised to all the~ that seke thy kingdom, the righteousnes therof, al thinges necessary to the bodely sustenaunce: send vs (we beseche thee) in thys our necessitie, suche moderate rayne and showers, that we maie receiue the fruites of the earth, to our comforte and to thy honor: Through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
Lorde God, whiche for the sinne of manne, didst once drowne all the worlde, excepte eight persons, and afterwarde of thy great mercie, didste promise neuer to destroy it so agayn: We humbly beseche thee, that although we for oure iniquities haue woorthelye deserued this plague of rayne and waters, yet vpon our true repentaunce, thou wilt sende vs suche wether wher by we maye receiue the fruites of the earthe in due season, and learne bothe by thy punishment to amende our liues, and by the grauntinge of our peticion, to geue thee prayse and glorye: Through Iesu Christ our Lorde.
Â¶Vpon wednesdaies frydaies, the Englishe Letanie shalbe saied or song in all places, after suche forme as is appoynted by the kynges maiesties Iniunccions: Or as is or shall be otherwise appoynted by his highnes.
And thoughe there be none to co~municate wyth the Prieste, yet these dayes (after the Letany ended) the Prieste shall put vpon him a plain Albe or surplesse, with a cope, and saie all thinges at the Altare (appoynted to bee sayde at the celebracion of the lordes supper) vntill after the offertory.
And then shall adde one or two of the Collectes afore written, as occasion shall serue by hys discrecion.
And then turning him to the people shall let them departe with the accustomed blessing.
And the same order shal be vsed all other daies, whensoeuer the people be customably assembled to praye in the church, and none disposed to communicate with the Prieste.
Lykewyse in Chappelles annexed, and all other places, there shalbe no celebracion of the Lordes supper, excepte there be some to communicate with the priest.
And in suche Chappelles annexed where the people hath not been accustomed to pay any holy bread, there they must either make some charitable prouision for the beryng of the charges of the Communion, or els (for receyuyng of thesame) resorte to their parishe Churche.
For auoydyng of all matters and occasion of discencion, it is mere that the bread prepared for the Co~munion, be made through all this realme, after one sorte and fashion: that is to say, vnleauened, and rounde, as it was afore, but without all maner of printe, and some thing more larger and thicker then it was, so that it may be aptly deuided in diuers pieces: and euery one shalbe deuided in two pieces, at the leaste, or more, by the discrecion of the minister, and so distributed.
And men must not thinke lesse to be receiued in parte, then in the whole, but in eche of them the whole body of our sauioure Iesu Christe.
And forsomuche as the Pastours Curates within this realme, shall continually fynde at their costes and charges in their cures, sufficient bread and wine for the holy Communion (as oft as their Parishioners shalbe disposed for their spirituall comforte to receiue the same) it is therfore ordred, that in recompe~ce of such costes and charges, the Parishioners of euery Parishe shall offre euery Sonday, at the tyme of the Offertory, the iust valour and pryce of the holy lofe (with all suche money, and other thynges as were wont to be offered with the same) to the vse of their Pastours and Curates, and that in suche ordre and course, as they were wonte to fynde and pay the sayed holy lofe.
Also that the receyuing of the Sacramente of the blessed body and bloud of Christ, may be moste agreable to the institucion therof and to the vsage of the primatiue Churche: In all Cathedrall and Collegiate churches, there shall alwayes some Communicate with the priest that ministreth.
And that thesame may be also obserued euery where abrode in the countrey: Some one at the least of that house in euery paryshe, to whom by course after the ordynaunce herein made, it apperteyneth to offer for the charges of the Communion, or some other whom they shall prouyde to offre for them, shal receiue the holy Communion with the priest: the which maye bee the better done, for that they knowe before, when theyr course commeth, and may therfore dispose themselfes to the worthy receyuing of the Sacramente.
And with him or them who doeth so offre the charges of the Communion: all other, who be then Godly disposed therunto, shall lykewise receiue the Communion.
And by this meanes the Minister hauyng alwayes some to communicate with him, may accordingly solempnise so high and holy misteries, with al the suffrages due ordre appointed for the same.
And the priest on the weke day, shal forbeare to celebrate the Comnion, excepte he haue some that will communicate with him.
Furthermore, euery man and woman to be bound to heare and be at the diuine seruice, in the Parishe churche where they be resident, and there with deuout prayer, or Godlye silence and meditacion, to occupy themselues.
There to pay their dueties, to communicate once in the yeare at the least, and there to receyue, and take all other Sacramentes and rites, in this booke appoynted.
And whosoeuer willingly vpon no iust cause, doeth absent themselfes, or doeth vngodly in the Parishe churche occupy the~selues: vpon proffe therof, by the Ecclesiasticall lawes of the Realme, to bee exco~municate, or suffre other punishement, as shal to the Ecclesiastical iudge (accordyng to his discrecion) seme conuenient.
And although it bee read in aunciente writers, that the people many yeares past, receiued at the priestes handes, the Sacrame~t of the body of Christ in theyr owne handes, no commaundement of Christ to the contrary: Yet forasmuche as they many tymes conueyghed thesame secretelye awaye, kept it with them, and diuersly abused it to supersticion and wickednes: lest any suche thing hereafter should be attempted, and that an vniformitie might be vsed, throughout the whole Realment is thought co~uenient the people commonly receiue the Sacrament of Christes body, in their mouthes, at the Priestes hande.

Amen. Â·.Â· [leaf motif]OF THE ADMI[leaf motif]+nistracion of publyke Baptisme to be vsed in the Churche.
IT appeareth by auncient wryters, that the Sacrament of Baptisme in the olde tyme was not commo~lye ministred but at two tymes in the yeare, at Easter and whitsontyde, at whiche tymes it was openlye ministred in the presence of all the congregacion: Whiche custome (nowe beeynge growen out of vse) although it cannot for many consideracions be well restored agayne, yet it is thought good to folowe the same as nere as conueniently maye be: Wherfore the people are to be admonished, that it is moste conueniente that Baptisme shoulde not be ministred but vpon Sondayes and other holye dayes, when the moste numbre of people maye come together.
As well for that the congregacion there present maye testifie the receyuyng of them, that be newely Baptised, into the numbre of Christes Churche, as also because in the Baytisme of Infantes, euery manne present maye be put in remembraunce of his owne profession made to God in hys Baptisme.
For whiche cause also, it is expedient that Baptisme be ministred in the Englishe tounge.
Neuerthelesse (yf necessitie so require) children oughte at all tymes to be Baptised, eyther at the Churche or els at home.
[leaf motif]PVBLIKE BAPTISME[leaf motif] When there are children to be Baptised vpon the Sonday, or holy daye, the parentes shall geue knowlege ouer nyght or in the mornyng, afore the beginnyng of Mattens to the curate.
And then the Godfathers, Godmothers, and people, wyth the children, muste be ready at the churche doore, either immediatly afore the last Canticle at Mattens, or els immediatly afore the last Canticle at Euensong, as the Curate by hys discrecion shal appoynte.
And then standyng there, the pryest shall aske whether the chyldren bee Baptised or no.
DEare beloued, forasmuche as al men be conceyued and borne in sinne, and that no man borne in synne, can entre into the kyngdom of God (except he be regenerate, and borne a newe of water, and the holy ghost) beseche you to cal vpon God the father through our Lord Iesus Christ, that of his bounteouse mercy he wyl grau~t to these childre~ that thing whiche by nature they cannot haue, that is to saye, they maye be Baptized with the holy ghost, and receyued into Christes holy churche, and bee made lyuely membres of the same.
ALmyghtie and euerlasting God, which of thy iustice dyddest destroy by floudes of water the whole worlde for sinne, except .viii. persones, whome of thy mercy (the same tyme) thou diddest saue in the Arke: And when thou dyddest drowne in the reade sea wicked King Pharao with all his armie, yet (at the same time)thou diddest lead thy people the children of Israel safely through the myddes therof: whereby thou diddest figure the washing of thy holy baptisme: by the baptisme of thy welbeloued sonne Iesus Christ, thou diddest sanctifie the flud Iordan, all other waters to this misticall washing away of sinne: we beseche thee (for thy infinite mercies) that thou wilte mercifully looke vpon these children, and sanctifie them with thy holy gost, that by this holsome lauer of regeneration, whatsoeuer synne is in them, maye be washed cleane away, that they beyng deliuered from thy wrath, may be receyued into tharke of Christes Church, and so saued from peryshing: and being feruente in spirite, stedfaste in fayth, ioyfull through hope, rooted in charite, maye euer serue thee: And finally attayne to euerlasting lyfe, with all thy holy and chosen people.
This graunte vs we beseche thee for Iesus Christes sake our Lord.
Here shall the prieste aske what shalbe the name of the childe, and when the Godfathers and Godmothers haue tolde the name, then he shall make a crosse vpon the childes foreheade and breste, saying.
Â¶N. Receyue the signe of the holy Crosse, both in thy forehead, and in thy breste, in token that thou shalt not be ashamed to confesse thy faith in Christ crucified, and manfully to fyght vnder his banner agaynst sinne, the worlde, and the deuill, and to continewe his faythful soldiour and seruaunt vnto thy lyfes ende.
And this he shall doe and saye to as many children as bee present to be Baptised one after another.
ALmightie and immortall God, the ayde of al that nede, the helper of all that flee to thee for succour, the life of them that beleue, and the resurreccion of the deade: we call vpon thee for these infantes, that they cummyng to thy holy Baptisme, may receyue remission of their sinnes, by spirituall regeneracion.
Receyue them (O Lorde) as thou haste promised by thy welbeloued sonne, saying: Aske, and you shall haue: seke, and you shall finde: knocke and it shalbe opened vnto you.
So geue nowe vnto vs that aske: Lette vs that seke finde: open thy gate vnto vs that knocke: that these infantes maye enioy the euerlasting benediccion of thy heauenly washing, and may come to the eternall kyngdome, whiche thou haste promysed, by Christe our Lorde.
Commaunde thee, vnclene spirite, in the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the holy goste, that thou come oute, and departe from these infantes, whom our Lorde Iesus Christe hathe vouchesaued to call to his holye Baptisme, to be made membres of his bodye, and of his holye congregacion.
Therefore thou cursed spirit, remembre thy sentence, remembre thy iudgement, remembre the daye to be at hand, wherin thou shalt burne in fyre euerlasting, prepared for thee and thy Aungels.
And presume not hereafter to exercise anye tirannye towarde these infantes, whom Christe hathe bought with his precious bloud, and by this his holy Baptisme calleth to be of his flocke.
AT a certayne tyme they broughte children to Christe that he shoulde touche them, and hys dysciples rebuked those that broughte them.
But when Iesus sawe it, he was displeased, and sayed vnto them: suffre litle children to come vnto me, and forbyd them not: for to suche belongeth the kyngdome of God.
Verely say vnto you: whosoeuer doeth not receyue the kyngdome of God, as a litle child: he shall not entre therin.
And when he had taken them vp in his armes: he put his handes vpo~ them, and blessed them.
After the gospell is reade, the minister shall make thys briefe exhortacion vpon the wordes of the gospell.
FRendes, you heare in thys gospell the wordes of oure Sauiour Christe, that he commaunded the children to be brought vnto hym: howe he blamed those that woulde haue kept them from hym: howe he exhorteth all menne to folowe their innocencie.
Ye perceyue howe by hys outwarde gesture and dede, he declared hys good wyll towarde them.
For he embraced them in his armes, he laied his handes vpon the~, and blessed the~: doubte ye not therfore, but earnestlye beleue, that he will lykewyse fauourably receiue these presente infantes, that he will embrace them, with the armes of hys mercy, that he will geue vnto them the blessing of eternall lyfe: and make them partakers of his euerlasting kyngdome.
Wherfore we beeing thus perswaded of the good will of our heauenlye father toward these infantes, declared by his sonne Iesus Christ: And nothyng doubting but that he fauourablye alloweth thys charitable woorke of ours, in bringyng these children to his holy baptisme: let vs faythfully and deuoutely geue thankes vnto him: And saye the prayer whiche the Lorde himselfe taught.
And in declaracion of our fayth, let vs also recyte the articles conteyned in our Crede.
Here the minister with the Godfathers, Godmothers, and people present: shall saye.
Â¶Our father whiche arte in heauen, halowed bee thy name.
ALmyghtie and euerlasting God, heauenly father, wee geue thee humble thankes, that thou haste vouchsaued to call vs to knowledge of thy grace, and faith in thee: Increace and co~firme this faith in vs euermore: Geue thy holy spirit to these infantes, that they maye bee borne agayne, and be made heyres of euerlasting saluacion, through our Lorde Iesus Christe: Who liueth and reigneth with thee and the holy spirite, nowe and for euer.
Then let the Priest take one of the children by the right hande, thother being brought after him.
THe Lorde vouchsafe to receyue you into hys holy housholde, and to kepe and gouerne you alway in the same, that you may haue euerlasting lyfe.
Then standing at the fonte the priest shall speake to the Godfathers and Godmothers, on this wise.
WElbeloued frendes, ye haue brought these children here to bee Baptised, ye haue prayed that oure Lorde Iesus Christe woulde vouchsafe to receiue them, to laye hys handes vpon them, to blesse them, to release them of theyr synnes, to geue them the kyngdome of heauen, and euerlastyng lyfe.
Ye haue hearde also that our Lorde Iesus Christ hath promised in his gospel, to graunt all these thinges that ye haue prayed for: which promise he for his parte, wil moste surely kepe and perfourme.
Wherefore after this promise made by Christe, these infantes must also faithfully for theyr parte promise by you, that be their suerties, that they wil forsake the deuill and all hys woorkes, and constantlye beleue Gods holy woorde, and obediently kepe his commaundementes.
Then shall the prieste demaunde of the childe (whiche shall be firste Baptised) these questyons folowyng: firste namyng the childe, and saying.
N. Doeste thou forsake the deuil and all his woorkes? Aunswere.
Doeste thou forsake the vayne pompe and glorie of the worlde, with all the couetous desyres of the same? Aunswere.
Doeste thou forsake the carnall desyres of the fleshe, so that thou wilt not folowe nor be led by them? Aunswere.
Minister Doeste thou beleue in God the father almightie, maker of heauen and yearth? Aunswere.
Minister Doest thou beleue in Iesus Christe his onely begotten sonne our lord, and that he was conceiued by the holy gost, borne of the virgin Mary, that he suffered vnder Poncius Pilate, was crucified, dead, and buried, that he went down into hell, and also did ryse agayne the thirde day, that he ascended into heauen, sitteth on the right hande of God the father almightie: And from thence shall come agayne at the ende of the worlde, to iudge the quicke and the dead: Doest thou beleue this? Aunswere.
Doeste thou beleue in the holy Goste, the holy Catholyke Churche, the Communion of Sainctes, Remissyon of Sinnes, Resurreccion of the fleshe, and euerlastyng lyfe after death? Aunswere.
Â¶Then the priest shall take the childe in his handes, and aske the name.
And namyng the chylde, shall dippe it in the water thryse.
First dipping the rightside: Second the leftside: The thirde time dipping the face towarde the fonte: So it be discretely and warely done, saying.
Baptize thee in the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holy gost.
Â¶And if the childe be weake, it shall suffice to powre water vpon it, saying the foresayde woordes.
Then the Godfathers and Godmothers shall take and laye theyr handes vpon the chylde, and the minister shall put vpon hym hys whyte vesture, commonly called the Crisome: And say.
Take thys whyte vesture for a token of the innocencye, whiche by Gods grace in this holy sacramente of baptisme, is geuen vnto thee: and for a sygne wherby thou art admonished, so long as thou liuest, to geue thy selfe to innocencie of liuing, that after thys transitory lyfe, thou mayest be partaker of the life euerlasting.
Then the Priest shall annoynte the infante vpon the head, saying.
ALmightie God the father of our Lorde Iesus Christ, who hath regenerate thee by water and the holye goste, and hath geuen vnto thee remission of all thy sinnes: he vouchesaue to annoynte thee with the vnccyon of hys holy spirite, and bring thee to the inheritance of euerlasting lyfe.
When there are many to be Baptised, this ordre of demaunding, Baptisyng, puttyng on the Crisome, and enoyntyng, shalbe vsed seuerally with euery childe.
Those that be first Baptised departyng from the fonte; and remaynyng in some conuenyente place within the Churche, vntill all bee Baptised.
At the laste ende, the priest callyng the Godfathers and Godmothers together: shall say this short exhortacion folowing.
FOr asmuche as these children haue promised by you to forsake the deuil and all his woorkes, to beleue in God, and to serue hym: you muste remember that it is youre partes and duetie, to see that these infantes bee taughte, so soone as they shalbe hable to learne, what a solemne vowe, promyse, and professyon, they haue made by you.
And that they maye knowe these thynges the better: ye shall call vpon them to heare sermons, and chiefely you shall prouyde that they maye learne the Crede, the Lordes prayer, and the ten commaundementes in thenglishe tonge: and al other thinges, whiche a Christian manne oughte to knowe and beleue, to hys soules healthe.
And that these children may bee vertuouslye broughte vp to leade a godly and Christian lyfe: remembryng alwayes that Baptisme doeth represent vnto vs our profession, whiche is, to folow thexaumple of our Sauiour Christe, and to bee made lyke vnto him, that as he dyed and rose agayne for vs, so should we (whiche are Baptised) dye from sinne, and ryse agayne vnto ryghteousnesse, continually mortifying all oure euyll and corrupte affeccions, and daylye procedyng in all vertue and godlines of liuing.
Â¶The minister shall commaunde that the Crisomes bee broughte to the churche, and delyuered to the Priestes after the accustomed manner, at the Purificacyon of the mother of euerye chylde.
And that the chyldren be brought to the Busshope to bee confirmed of hym, so soone as they can saye in theyr vulgare tongue the articles of the faythe, the Lordes prayer, and the ten commaundementes, and be further instructed in the Cathechisme, sette foorthe for that purpose, accordyngly as it is there expressed.
And so lette the congregacyon departe in the name of the Lorde.
Â¶Note, that if the number of children to bee Baptised, and multytude of people presente bee so great that they cannot conuenientlye stand at the churche doore: then let them stande within the churche in some conueniente place, nygh vnto the Churche doore: And there all thinges be sayde and done, appoynted to bee sayde and done at the churche doore.
Of them that be Baptised in priuate houses in tyme of necessitie.
Â¶The pastours and curates shal oft admonyshe the people, that they differ not the baptisme of infantes any longer then the Sondaye, or other holy daye nexte after the childe bee borne, onlesse vpon a great and resonable cause declared to the curate and by hym approued.
And also they shall warne them that without great cause, and necessitie, they Baptise not children at home in theyr houses.
And when great nede shal compel them so to doe, that then they minister it on thys fashion.
Â¶First let the~ that be present call vpon god for his grace, and saye the Lordes prayer, if the tyme will suffer.
And then one of them shal name the childe, and dyppe hym in the water, or powre water vpon hym, saying these woordes Â¶N.
Baptise thee in the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holy gost.
And lette them not doubte, but that the chylde so Baptised is lawfully and sufficiently Baptised, and oughte not to bee Baptised agayne, in the Churche.
But yet neuerthelesse, yf the chylde whiche is after thys sorte Baptised dooe afterwarde lyue, it is expedyente that he bee broughte into the Churche, to the entente the Prieste maye examyne and trye, whether the chylde bee lawfullye Baptised or no.
And yf those that bring any childe to the Churche doe aunswere that he is already Baptised: Then shall the Prieste examyne them further.
Â¶By whome the childe was Baptised? Who was present when the childe was baptised? Whether they called vpon god for grace and succour in that necessitie? With what thyng, or what matter, they dyd Baptise the childe? With what woordes the childe was Baptised? Whether they thinke the chylde to be lawfully and perfectly Baptised? And yf the minister shall proue by the aunswers of suche as brought the childe that al thinges were done, as they ought to be: Then shall not he christen the chylde agayne, but shall receyue him, as one of the flocke of the true christian people, saying thus.
Certifye you, that in this case ye haue doen wel, and accordyng vnto due ordre concernyng the Baptising of thys childe, whiche being borne in originall sinne, and in the wrath of God, is now by the lauer of regeneracion in Baptisme, made the chylde of God, and heyre of euerlastyng lyfe: for our Lorde Iesus Christe doeth not denye his grace and mercie vnto suche infantes, but most louingly doeth call them vnto him.
As the holy gospell doeth witnes to our coumfort on this wise.
AT a certayne tyme they broughte chyldren vnto Christ that he shoulde touche them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.
But when Iesus sawe it, he was dyspleased, and sayde vnto them: Suffer litle chyldren to come vnto me, and forbydde them not, for to suche belongeth the kyngdome of God.
Verely say vnto you: whosoeuer doeth not receyue the kingdome of God as a litle childe, he shal not enter therin.
And when he had taken them vp in his armes, he put his handes vpon them, and blissed them.
After the gospell is read: the minister shall make this exhortacion vpon the woordes of the gospell.
FRendes, ye heare in this gospell the woordes of our Saueour Christ, that he commaunded the children to be broughte vnto him, how he blamed those that woulde haue kepte them from hym, howe he exhorted all men to folowe theyr innocencie: ye perceiue how by his outward gesture and dede, he declared hys good wil towarde them, for he enbraced them in his armes, he layed hys handes vpon them and blessed them.
Doubte you not therefore, but earnestlye beleue, that he hathe lykewise fauourablye receyued thys presente infante, that he hathe enbraced him with the armes of hys mercie, that he hath geuen vnto hym the blessyng of eternall lyfe, and made hym partaker of his euerlasting kingdome.
Wherefore we being thus perswaded of the good will of oure heauenlye father, declared by his sonne Iesus Christ towardes this infant: Let vs faythfully and deuoutly geue thankes vnto hym, and saye the prayer whiche the Lorde himselfe taught, and in declaracion of oure faythe, let vs also recyte the articles conteyned in our Crede.
Here the minister with the Godfathers and Godmothers shall saye.
OVr father whiche art in heauen, halowed be thy name: let thy kyngdome come.
Then shall they saye the Crede, and then the Prieste shall demaunde the name of the chylde, whiche beeyng by the Godfathers and Godmothers pronounced, the minister shall saye. Â¶.N. Doest thou forsake the deuill and all hys woorkes? Aunswere.
Doest thou forsake the vayne Pompe and glorye of the worlde, with all the couetous desyres of the same? Aunswere.
Doest thou forsake the carnall desyres of the fleshe, so that thou wilt not folowe and be led by them? Aunswere.
Doest thou beleue in God the father almyghtie, maker of heauen and yearth? Aunswere.
Doest thou beleue in Iesus Christe hys onely begotten sonne our Lorde, and that he was conceyued by the holye Ghoste, borne of the virgin Marie, that he suffered vnder Poncius Pilate, was crucifyed, dead, and buryed, that he wente downe into hel, and also did arise agayne the thirde daye, that he ascended into heauen, and sitteth on the right hande of God the father almightie: And from thence shall come agayne at the ende of the worlde to iudge the quicke and the dead: doest thou beleue thus? Aunswere.
Doest thou beleue in the holy Goste, the holy catholyke Churche, the Co~munion of Saintes, Remission of sinnes, Resurreccion of the fleshe, and euerlasting lyfe after death? Aunswere.
Then the minister shall put the white vesture commonly called the Crisome, vpon the childe, saying.
TAke this whyte vesture for a token of the innocencie, whiche by goddes grace in the holy sacramente of Baptysme is geuen vnto thee, and for a sygne wherby thou arte admonyshed so long as thou shalte liue, to geue thy selfe to innocencie of liuing, that after this transitory lyfe, thou mayest be partaker of the lyfe euerlastyng.
ALmightie and euerlastyng God, heauenlye father, wee geue thee humble thankes that thou haste vouchesaued to call vs to the knoweledge of thy grace, and fayth in thee: Increase and confirme this fayth in vs euermore: Geue thy holy spirite to thys infante, that he being borne agayne, and being made heire of euerlasting saluacyon throughe oure Lorde Iesus Christe, may continue thy seruaunte, and attaine thy promises, through the same our Lorde Iesus Christe thy sonne: who liueth and reygneth with thee in vnitie of the same holy spirite euerlastinglye.
Then shall the minister make this exhortacion, to the Godfathers and Godmothers.
FOr asmuche as thys chylde hathe promysed by you to forsake the deuill and all his woorkes, to beleue in God, and to serue him, you must remember that it is your partes and duetie to see that this infante be taught, so soone as he shalbe hable to learne, what a solemne vowe, promyse, and professyon he hath made by you, and that he maye knowe these thinges the better, ye shall call vpon him to heare sermons: And chiefly ye shall prouide that he may learne the Crede, the Lordes prayer, and the ten commaundementes in the Englishe tongue, and al other thynges which a christian man ought to knowe and beleue to his soules health, and that this child may be vertuously brought vp to leade a godly and a christian life.
Remembring alway that baptisme doeth represent vnto vs oure profession, whiche is to folowe the example of our sauiour Christ, and to be made lyke vnto him, that as he died and rose agayne for vs: so shoulde we whiche are baptised, dye from sinne, and rise agayne vnto righteousnes, continually mortifying al our euil and corrupt affeccions, and daily proceding in al vertue and godlines of liuyng. &c As in publyke Baptisme.
Â¶But yf they whiche bryng the infantes to the churche, doe make an vncertayne aunswere to the priestes questions and saye that they cannot tell what they thought, dyd, or sayed, in that great feare and trouble of mynde: (as oftentymes it chaunseth) Then let the priest Baptise hym in forme aboue wrytten, concerninge publyke Baptime, sauing that at the dyppyng of the childe in the fonte, he shal vse this forme of wordes.
Baptize thee in the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holye gost.
The water in the fonte shalbe chaunged euery moneth once at the least, and afore any chyld be Baptised in the water so chau~ged, the priest shal saye at the fonte these prayers folowyng.
Most mercyfull God our sauiour Iesu Christ, who haste ordeyned the elemente of water for the regeneracion of thy faythfull people, vpon whom beinge baptised in the riuer of Iordan, the holye goste came downe in lykenes of a dooue: Sende downe, we beseche thee, the same thy holy spirite to assist vs, and to be present at thys our inuocacion of thy holy name: Sanctifie this fou~tain of baptisme, thou that art the sanctifier of al thinges, that by the power of thy word, all those that shall be baptised therein may be spiritually regenerated, and made the children of euerlastyng adopcion.
mercyful God, graunt that the olde Adam, in them that shalbe baptised in this fountayne, may be so buried, that the newe man may be raysed vp agayne.
Graunt that all carnall affeccions maye die in them: and that all thynges, belongyng to the spirite, maye lyue and growe in them.
Graunte to all them whiche at this fountayne forsake the deuill and all his workes: that they maye haue power and strength to haue victorye, and to triumph against him, the worlde and the fleshe.
Whosoeuer shall confesse thee, lord: recognise him also in thy kingdome.
Graunt that al sinne and vice here maie be so extinct: that they neuer haue power to raigne in thy seruauntes.
Ame~. Graunte that whosoeuer here shall begynne to be of thy flocke: may euermore continue in the same.
Graunt that all they whiche for thy sake in this lyfe do denie and forsake themselfes: may wynne and purchase thee (O lorde) whiche art euerlasting treasure.
Graunte that whosoeuer is here dedicated to thee by our office and ministerie: may also be endewed with heauenlye vertues, and euerlastinglye rewarded through thy mercy, Blessed lorde God, who doest lyue and gouerne all thinges worlde without ende.
ALmightie euerliuing God, whose moste derely beloued sonne Iesus Christ, for the forgeuenes of our sinnes did shead out of his most precious syde both water and bloud, and gaue co~maundeme~t to his disciples that they should goe teache all nacions, and Baptise them in the name of the father, the sonne, and the holy goste: Regarde, we beseche thee, the supplycacions of thy congregacion, and graunte that all thy seruauntes whiche shall bee Baptized in this water, prepared for the ministracion of thy holy sacrament, may receiue the fulnesse of thy grace, and euer remaine in the noumbre of thy faithful, and elect chyldren, through Iesus Christ our Lorde. [leaf motif]CONFIRMACION[leaf motif] wherin is conteined a Cathechisme for children.
TO thende that confirmacion may be ministred to the more edifying of suche as shall receyue it (accordyng to Saint Paules doctrine, who teacheth that all thynges shoulde be doen in the church to the edificacion of the same) it is thought good that none hereafter shall be confirmed, but suche as can saye in their mother tong, tharticles of the fayth, the lordes prayer, the ten commau~deme~tes: And can also aunswere to suche questions of this short Cathechisme, as the Bushop (or suche as he shall appoynte) shall by hys discrecion appose them in.
And thys ordre is moste conueniente to be obserued for diuers consideracions.
Â¶First, because that when children come to the yeres of discrecion and haue learned what their Godfathers and Godmothers promised for them in Baptisme, they maye then themselfes with their owne mouthe and with their owne consent, openly before the churche, ratifie and confesse the same, and also promise that by the grace of God they wyll euermore endeuour themselues faythfully to obserue and kepe suche thinges, as they by their owne mouth and confession haue assented vnto.
Â¶Secondly, for asmuche as confirmacion is ministred to them that be Baptised, that by imposicion of handes, and prayer, they may receyue strength and defence agaynst all temptacions to sinne, and the assautes of the worlde, and the deuill: it is moste mete to be ministred, when children come to that age, that partly by the frayltie of their owne fleshe, partly by the assautes of the worlde and the deuill, they begyn to be in daungier to fall into synne.
Â¶Thirdely, for that it is agreable with the vsage of the churche in tymes past, wherby it was ordeined that confirmacion shoulde be ministred to them that were of perfecte age, that they beynge instructed in Christes religion, shoulde openly professe their owne fayth, and promyse to be obedyent vnto the wyl of God.
Â¶And that no manne shall thynke that anye detrymente shall come to children by differryng of theyr confirmacion: he shal knowe for trueth, that it is certayn by goddes worde, that chyldren beeyng Baptysed (yf they departe out of thys lyfe in theyr infancye) are vndoubtedly saued. [leaf motif]A CATHECHISME[leaf motif] that is to say, an instruccion to bee learned of euery childe, before he be brought to be confirmed of the Bushop.
MY Godfathers and Godmothers in my Baptisme, wherin was made a member of Christ, the child of God, and an inheritour of the kingdome of heauen.
They did promise and vowe three thinges in my name.
First, that shoulde forsake the deuill and all his workes and pompes, the vanities of the wicked worlde, and all the sinneful lustes of the fleshe.
Secondly, that should beleue all the articles of the Christian faith.
And thirdly, that should kepe Gods holy will and commaundementes, and walke in the same all the dayes of my life.
Doest thou not thinke that thou art bound to beleue, and to doe as they haue promised for thee? Aunswere.
And hartilye thanke our heauenly father, that he hath called me to this state of saluacion, through Iesus Christ our saueour.
And pray God to geue me his grace, that may continue in thesame vnto my liues ende.
Beleue in God the father almightie, maker of heauen and earth.
Whiche was conceyued by the holy gost, borne of the virgin Marie.
Suffered vnder Ponce Pilate, was crucified, deade, and buried, he descended into hell.
He ascended into heauen and sitteth on the right hande of God the father almightie.
From thence shal he come to iudge the quicke the deade.
What doest thou chiefely learne in these articles of thy beliefe? Aunswere.
Firste, learne to beleue in God the father, who hathe made me and all the worlde.
Secondly, in God the sonne, who hathe redemed me and all mankynde.
Thirdly, in God the holy goste, who sanctifieth me, and all the electe people of God.
You sayde that your Godfathers and Godmothers dyd promyse for you that ye shoulde kepe Goddes commaundementes.
THou shalte haue none other Gods but me. ii. Thou shalte not make to thy selfe any grauen image, nor the lykenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, nor in the water vnder the earth: thou shalt not bow downe to the~, nor wurship them. iii.
Thou shalt not take the name of the lorde thy God in vayne. iiii.
Remember that thou kepe holy the Sabboth day. v. Honor thy father and thy mother.
Thou shalt not steale. ix. Thou shalt not beare false witnes against thy neighbour. x. Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours wyse, nor his seruaunt, nor his mayde, nor his Oxe, nor his Asse, nor any thing that is his.
My duetie towardes God, and my duetie towardes my neighbour.
And to loue him with al my heart, with al my minde, with all my soule, and with all my strength.
To honor his holy name and his worde, and to serue him truely all the dayes of my lyfe.
My duetie towardes my neighbour is, to loue him as my selfe.
And to doe to all men as would they shoulde do to me.
To submitte my selfe to all my gouernours, teachers, spirituall pastours, and maisters.
To ordre my selfe lowly and reuerentlye to all my betters.
To kepe my ha~des from picking and stealing, and my tongue from euill speaking, liyng and slaundring.
But learne and laboure truely to geate my owne liuing, and to do my duetie in that state of lyfe: vnto which it shall please God to cal me.
My good sonne, knowe this that thou art not hable to do these thinges of thy selfe, nor to walke in the commaundementes of God and to serue him, without his speciall grace, whiche thou muste learne at all tymes to call for by diligent praier.
Let me heare therfore yf thou canst say the Lordes praier.
OVr father whiche art in heauen, halowed bee thy name.
Thy wyll bee done in earth as it is in heauen.
And forgeue vs our trespasses, as we forgeue them that trespasse against vs.
And leade vs not into temptacion, but delyuer vs from euil.
desire my lord God our heauenly father, who is the geuer of all goodnesse, to sende his grace vnto me, to all people, that we may wurship him, serue him, and obey him, as we ought to doe.
And praye vnto God, that he wil sende vs al thinges that be nedeful both for our soules, and bodyes: And that he wyll be mercifull vnto vs and forgeue vs our sinnes: And that it wyll please him to saue and defende vs in al daungers gostly and bodily: And that he wil kepe vs from al sinne and wickednes, and from our gostly enemye, and from euerlasting death.
And this trust he wyl do of his mercye and goodnes, throughe our lorde Iesu Christe.
Â¶So soone as the children can say in their mother tongue tharticles of the faithe, the lordes praier, the ten commaundementes, and also can aunswere to suche questions of this short Cathechisme as the Bushop (or suche as he shall appointe) shall by his discrecion appose them in: then shall they bee brought to the Bushop by one that shalbee his godfather or godmother, that euery childe maye haue a wittenesse of his confirmacion.
ALmightie and euerliuing God, who hast vouchesafed to regenerate these thy seruauntes of water the holy gost: And hast geue vnto the~ forgeuenesse of al their sinnes: Sende downe from heauen we beseche thee (O lorde) vpon them thy holy gost the coumforter, with the manifolde giftes of grace, the spirite of wysedom and vnderstanding: The spirite of councell and gostly strength: The spirite of knowledge and true godlinesse, and fulfyll them (O lorde) with the spirite of thy holy feare.
Signe them (o lorde) and marke them to be thine for euer, by the vertue of thy holy crosse and passion.
Confirme and strength them with the inwarde vnccion of thy holy goste, mercifully vnto euerlasting lyfe.
Then the Bushop shall crosse them in the forehead and laye his hande vpon their heade, saying.
signe thee with the signe of the crosse, and laye my hande vpon thee.
In the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holy gost.
And thus shall he doe to euery childe one after another.
And whan he hath layed his hande vpon euery childe, then shall he say.
ALmightie euerliuing God, whiche makest vs bothe to wil and to doe those thinges that bee good and acceptable vnto thy maiestie: we make our humble supplicacio~s vnto thee for these children, vpon whome (after the example of thy holy Apostles) we haue layed our handes, to certify them (by this signe) of thy fauour and gracious goodnes towarde them: leat thy fatherly hande (we beseche thee) euer be ouer them, let thy holy spirite euer bee with them, and so leade them in the knowledge and obedience of thy worde, that in the end they may obteine the life euerlasting, through our Lorde Iesus Christ, who with thee, the holy gost liueth reigneth one god world without ende.
The blessing of God almightie, the father, the sonne, and the holy gost, be vpon you, and remayne with you for euer.
The curate of euery parish once in sixe wekes at the least, vpon warning by him geuen, shall vpon some Soonday or holy day, halfe an houre before euensong, openly in the churche instructe and examine so many children of his parishe sent vnto him, as the time wil serue, and as he shall thinke conueniente, in some parte of this Cathechisme.
And all fathers, mothers, maisters and dames, shall cause their children, seruauntes, and prentises (whiche are not yet confirmed) to come to the churche at the daye appointed, and obedientlye heare and be ordered by the curate, vntyll suche time as they haue learned all that is here appointed for them to learne.
Â¶And whansoeuer the Bushop shall geue knowledge for children to be brought afore him to any conuenient place, for their confirmacion: Then shall the curate of euery parishe eyther bring or sende in writing, the names of all those children of his parishe whiche can say tharticles of theyr faith, the lordes praier, the ten commaundementes.
And also howe many of them can aunswere to thother questions conteined in this Cathechisme.
Â¶And there shal none be admitted to the holy communion: vntyll suche time as he be confirmed.
Â¶First the bannes must be asked three seueral Sondayes or holy dayes, in the seruice tyme, the people being present, after the accustomed maner.
And if the persones that would be maried dwel in diuers paryshes, the bannes must be asked in both paryshes, and the curate of the one paryshe shall not solemnize matrimonie betwixt them, without a certificate of the bannes beyng thrise asked, from the curate of thother paryshe.
At the daye appointed for Solemnizacion of matrimonie, the persones to bee maried shall come into the bodye of the Churche, with theyr frendes and neyghbours.
DErely beloued frendes, we are gathered together here in the sight of God, and in the face of his congregacion, to ioyne together this man, and this woman, in holy matrimonie, whiche is an honorable estate instituted of God in paradise, in the time of mans innocencie, signifying vnto vs the mistical vnion that is betwixt Christ and his churche: whiche holy estate, Christe adorned and beutifyed wyth his presence, and first miracle that he wrought, in Cana of Galile, and is commended of Saincte Paule to be honourable emong all men, and therfore is not to be enterprised, nor taken in hande vnaduisedly, lightely, or wantonly, to satisfie mens carnall lustes appetites, lyke brute beastes that haue no vnderstandyng: but reuerently, discretely, aduisedly, soberly, and in the feare of God.
Duely co~sideryng the causes for the whiche matrimonie was ordayned.
One cause was the procreacion of children, to be brought vp in the feare and nurture of the Lorde, and prayse of God.
Secondly it was ordeyned for a remedye against synne, and to auoyde fornicacio~, that suche persons as be maried, might lyue chastly in matrimony, and kepe themselfes vndefiled membres of Christes body.
Thirdely for the mutuall societie, helpe and comfort, that the one ought to haue of the other, both in prosperitie and aduersitie.
Into the which holy estate these two persons present, come now to be ioyned.
Therfore yf any man can shewe any iust cause why they may not lawfully be ioyned so together: Lette him nowe speake, or els hereafter for euer hold his peace.
And also speakyng to the persons that shalbe maried, he shall say.
require and charge you (as you will aunswere at the dreadfull daye of iudgemente, when the secretes of all heartes shalbe disclosed) that if eyther of you doe knowe any impediment, why ye may not be lawfully ioyned together in matrimonie, that ye confesse it.
For be ye well assured, that so many as be coupled together otherwayes then Gods worde doth allowe: are not ioyned of God, neither is their matrimonie lawfull.
At whiche day of mariage if any man doe allege any impediment why they may not be coupled together in matrimonie: And will be bound, sureties with him, to the parties, or els put in a caucion to the full value of suche charges, as the persons to be maried doe susteyne, to proue his allegacion: then the Solemnizacion must be differed, vnto suche time as the trueth be tryed.
Yf no impediment be alleged, then shall the curate saye vnto the man.
N. Wilt thou haue this woman to thy wedded wyfe, to lyue together after Gods ordeynaunce in the holy estate of matrimonie? wilt thou loue her, coumforte her, honor and kepe her, in sickenesse and in health? And forsaking all other kepe thee onely to her, so long as you both shall lyue? The man shall aunswere.
N. Wilt thou haue this man to thy wedded houseband, to lyue together after Gods ordeinaunce, in the holy estate of matrimony? wilt thou obey him, and serue him, loue, honor kepe him, in sicknes in health? And forsaking al other kepe thee only to him, so long as you both shall lyue? The woman shall aunswere.
Who geueth this woman to be maried to this man? And the minister receiuyng the woman at her father or frendes handes: shall cause the man to take the woman by the righthande, and so eyther to geue theyr trouth to other: The man first saying.
.N. take thee .N. to my wedded wife, to haue and to hold from this day forward, for better, for wurse, for richer, for poorer, in syckenesse, and in health, to loue, and to cherishe, till death vs depart: accordyng to Gods holy ordeinaunce: And therto plight thee my trouth.
Then shall they looce theyr handes, and the woman taking agayn the man by the right hande shall say.
.N. take thee .N. to my wedded husbande, to haue and to holde from this day forwarde, for better, for wurse, for richer, for poorer, in sickenes, and in health, to loue, cherishe, and to obey, til death vs depart: according to Goddes holy ordeinaunce: And therto geue thee my trouth.
Then shall they agayne looce theyr handes, and the man shall geue vnto the woman a ryng, and other tokens of spousage, as golde or syluer, laying the same vpon the booke: And the priest taking the ring shal delyuer it vnto the man: to put it vpon the fowerth finger of the womans lefte hande.
Â¶With this ring thee wed: This golde and siluer thee geue: with my body thee wurship: and with al my worldly goodes thee endow.
In the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holy gost.
Then the man leauyng the ryng vpon the fowerth fynger of the womans left hande, the minister shall say.
Eternal god, creator and preseruer of al mankind, geuer of al spirituall grace, the author of euerlasting life: sende thy blessing vpon these thy seruauntes, this man and this woman, whome we blesse in thy name, that as Isaac and Rebecca (after bracellets Iewels of golde geuen of thone to thother for tokens of their matrimonye) liued faithfully together: So these persons may surely performe and kepe the vowe and couenaunt betwixt them made, wherof this ring geuen, and receiued, is a token and pledge.
And may euer remayne in perfite loue and peace together: And lyue according to thy lawes: through Iesus Christe our Lorde.
Then shall the Prieste ioyne theyr ryghtehandes together, and say.
Â¶Those whome god hath ioyned together: let no man put a sunder.
FOr asmuche as .N. and .N. haue consented together in holy wedlocke, and haue witnessed the same here before God and this cumpany: And therto haue geuen and pledged their trouth either to other, and haue declared the same by geuing and receiuing golde and siluer, and by ioyning of handes: pronounce that they be man and wyfe together: In the name of the father, of the sonne, and of the holy gost.
God the so~ne kepe you: god the holy gost lighten your vnderstandyng: The lorde mercifully with his fauor loke vpon you, and so fill you with al spirituall benediccion, and grace, that you may haue remission of your sinnes in this life, and in the world to come life euerlasting.
Then shall they goe into the quier, and the ministers or clearkes shall say or sing, this Psalme folowing.
BLe&s&sed are all they that feare the lorde, and walke in his wayes.
Thy wife shal be as the fruitful vine, vpon the walles of thy house.
Thy children like the olife brau~ches round about thy table.
Loe, thus shal the man be blessed, that feareth the lorde.
The lorde from out of Sion, shal so blesse thee: that thou shalt see Hierusalem in prosperitie, all thy lyfe long.
Yea that thou shalte see thy childers children: and peace vpon Israel.
GOd be mercifull vnto vs, and blesse vs, and shewe vs the lighte of his countenaunce: and bee merciful vnto vs. That thy waye may bee knowen vpon yearth: thy sauing health emong all nacions.
Leate the people prayse thee (O God) yea leat all people prayse thee.
leate the nacions reioyce and bee glad, for thou shalte iudge the folke righteously, and gouerne the nacions vpon yearth.
Leat the people prayse thee (O God) leat all people prayse thee.
Then shall the yearth bring foorthe her increase: and God, euen our owne God, shall geue vs his blessinge.
God shall blesse vs, and all the endes of the worlde shall feare him.
The psalme ended, and the manne and woman knelyng afore the aulter: the prieste standyng at the aulter, and turning his face towarde them, shall saye.
Lorde haue mercie vpon vs. Â¶Our father whiche art in heauen. &c.
God of Abraha~, God of Isaac, God of Iacob, blesse these thy seruauntes, sowe the seede of eternal life in their mindes, that whatsoeuer in thy holy worde they shal profitably learne: they may in dede fulfil the same.
Looke, lord, mercifully vpon them from heauen blesse them: And as thou didest sende thy Aungell Raphaell, to Thobie, and Sara, the daughter of Raguel, to their great comfort: so vouchsafe to sende thy blessinge vpon these thy seruauntes, that they obeyng thy wil, and alway beyng in safetie vnder thy proteccion: may abyde in thy loue vnto theyr lyues ende: through Iesu Christ our Lorde.
This prayer folowinge shalbe omitted where the woman is past childe birthe.
Merciful lorde, and heaue~ly father, by whose gracious gifte ma~kind is increased: We beseche thee assiste with thy blissig these two persones, that they may both be fruictful in procreacion of children: also liue together so long in godlye loue and honestie: that they maye see their childers children, vnto the thirde and fourth generacion, vnto thy prayse and honour: throughe Iesus Christ our lord.
God whiche by thy mightie power hast made all thinges of naught, whiche also after other thinges set in order diddeste appoint that out of man (created after thine owne image and similitude) woman should take her beginning: and knitting them together, diddest teache, that it should neuer be lawful to put asonder those, whome thou by matrimonie haddest made one: God, which hast consecrated the state of matrimonie, to such an excellent misterie, that in it is signified and represented the spiritual mariage vnitie betwixte Christ and his church: Loke mercifully vpon these thy seruauntes, that both this manne maye loue his wyfe, according to thy woorde (as Christ did loue his spouse the churche, who gaue himselfe for it, louing and cherishinge it euen as his owne fleshe:) And also that this woman may be louing and amiable to her housebande as Rachael, wyse as Rebecca, faithful and obedient as Sara: And in al quietnes, sobrietie, and peace, bee a folower of holy and godlye matrones.
lorde blesse them bothe, and graunt them to inherite thy euerlastinge kingdome, throughe Iesus Christ our Lorde.
Then shall the prieste blesse the man and the woman, saiyng.
Almightie god, which at the beginning did create our first parentes Adam and Eue, and did sanctifie and ioyne them together in mariage: Powre vpon you the richesse of his grace, sanctifie and blisse you, that ye maye please him bothe in bodye and soule: and lyue together in holy loue, vnto your lyues ende.
Then shalbe sayed after the gospell a sermon, wherin ordinarely (so oft as there is any marige) thoffice of man and wyfe shall bee declared, according to holy scripture.
Or yf ther be no sermon, the minister shall reade this that foloweth.
Al ye whiche bee maried, or which entende to take the holy estate of matrimonie vpon you: heare what holy scripture dooeth say, as touching the duetie of houseba~des towarde their wiues, and wiues towarde their housebandes.
Saincte Paule (in his epistie to the Ephesians the fyfthe chapter) doeth geue this commaundement to all maried men.
Ye housebandes loue your wyues, euen as Christ loued the churche, and hathe geuen himselfe for it, to sanctifie it, purgeyng it in the fountaine of water, throughe the word, that he might make it vnto him selfe, a glorious congregacion, not hauing spot or wrincle, or any suche thing, but that it shoulde be holy and blameles.
So men are bounde to loue their owne wyues, as their owne bodyes: he that loueth his owne wyfe, loueth himselfe.
For neuer dyd any man hate his owne fleshe, but nourisheth and cherisheth it, euen as the lorde dothe the congregacion, for wee are membres of his bodye, of his fleshe, and of his bones.
For this cause shall a man leaue father and mother, and shalbe ioyned vnto his wyfe, and they two shalbe one flesh.
This mistery is great, but speake of Christ, and of the congregacion.
Neuerthelesse, let euery one of you so loue his owne wyfe, euen as himselfe.
Lykewyse the same Saint Paule (writing to the Colossians) speaketh thus to all menne that be maried: Ye men loue your wiues and be not bitter vnto them.
Heare also what saint Peter thapostle of Christ, (whiche was himselfe a maried man) sayeth vnto all menne that are maried.
Ye husbandes dwel with your wyues according to knowledge: Geuyng honor vnto the wyfe, as vnto the weaker vessell, and as heyres together of the grace of lyfe, so that your prayers be not hindred.
Hitherto ye haue hearde the duetie of the husbande towarde the wyfe.
Nowe lykewise ye wiues, heare and learne your duetie towarde your husbandes, euen as it is playnely set furth in holy scripture.
Saint Paule (in the forenamed Epistle to the Ephesians) teacheth you thus: ye weomen submit your selues vnto your owne husbandes as vnto the lord: for the husband is the wiues head, euen as Christ is the head of the churche: And he also is the sauiour of the whole bodye.
Therefore as the Churche, or congregacion, is subiecte vnto Christe: So lykewise let the wiues also be in subieccion vnto theyr owne husbandes, in all thinges.
And againe he saieth: Let the wyfe reuerence her husbande.
And (in his Epistle to the Colossians) Saincte Paule geueth you this short lesso~.
Ye wiues submit your selues vnto your owne husbandes, as it is conueniente, in the Lorde.
Saincte Peter also doeth instructe you very godly, thus sayeng: Let wiues be subiect to their owne husbandes, so that if any obey not the woorde, they may be wonne without the woorde, by the conuersacion of the wiues: Whyle they beholde your chaste conuersacion, coupled with feare, whose apparell let it not be outwarde, with broyded heare, and trymmyng about with golde, eyther in putting on of gorgeous apparell: But leat the hyd man, whiche is in the hearte, be without all corrupcion, so that the spirite be mylde and quiete, whiche is a precious thing in the sight of God.
For after this maner (in the olde tyme) dyd the holy women, whiche trusted in God, apparell themselues, beeyng subiecte to theyr owne husbandes: as Sara obeyed Abraham callyng him lorde, whose daughters ye are made, doyng wel and beyng not dismaied with any feare. (?) The newe maried persones, (the same daye of their mariage) must receiue the holy communion.
[leaf motif] THE ORDER FOR[leaf motif] the visitacion of the sicke, and the Communion of the same.
The prieste entring into the sicke persones house, shal saye.
Peace be in this house, and to all that dwell in it.
When he commeth into the sicke mannes presence, he shall saye this psalme.
HEare my prayer (o lorde) and co~sider my desire: herken vnto me for thy trueth and righteousnes sake.
And enter not into iudgement with thy seruaunt: for in thy sight shall no man liuing be iustified.
For the enemy hath persecuted my soule, he hath smitten my lyfe downe to the grounde: he hath layed me in the darknesse, as the men that haue bene long dead.
Therefore is my spirite vexed within me: and my hearte within me is desolate.
Yet doe remembre the tyme paste, muse vpon all thy woorkes: yea, exercise my selfe in the woorkes of thy handes.
stretche forth myne handes vnto thee: my soule gaspeth vnto thee as a thirstie lande.
Heare me (o lorde) and that soone: for my spirite weaxeth faint: hyde not thy face from me, lest be lyke vnto them that goe downe into the pitte.
lette me heare thy louyng kyndnesse betymes in the mornynge, for in thee is my trust: shewe thou me the waye that shoulde walke in, for lyft vp my soule vnto thee.
Deliuer me (o lorde) from myne enemyes: for flye vnto thee to hyde me.
Teache me to dooe the thing, that pleaseth thee, for thou art my god: lette thy louyng spirite leade me foorth vnto the lande of righteousnesse.
Quicken me (o lorde) for thy names sake, and for thy righteousnesse sake bryng my soule out of trouble.
And of thy goodnesse slaye my enemies, and destroye all them that vexe my soule, for am thy seruaunt.
Glory be to the father and to the sonne. &c.
Remembre not Lorde our iniquities, nor the iniquities of our forefathers.
Spare vs good Lorde, spare thy people, whom thou haste redemed with thy moste precious bloud, and be not angry with vs for euer.
Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Christe haue mercy vpon vs. Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Our father whiche art in heauen. &c.
Lorde, looke downe from heauen, beholde, visite, and releue this thy seruaunte: Looke vpon hym with the iyes of thy mercy, geue hym coumforte, and sure confidence in thee: Defende hym from the daunger of the enemy, and kepe hym in perpetuall peace, and safetie: through Jesus Christe our Lorde.
HEare vs almightie and moste mercifull God, and Sauioure: Extende thy accustomed goodnesse to this thy seruaunt, whiche is greued with sickenesse: Visite hym, Lord, as thou diddest visite Peters wyfes mother, and the Capitaynes seruaunte.
And as thou preseruedst Thobie and Sara by thy Aungell from daunger: So restore vnto this sicke person his former health (if it be thy will,) or els geue hym grace so to take thy correccion: that after this painfull lyfe ended, he may dwel with thee in lyfe euerlastyng.
Then shall the minister exhorte the sicke person after this fourme, or other lyke.
DErely beloued, knowe this, that almightie God is the Lorde ouer lyfe, death, and ouer all thinges to them perteining, as yougth, strength, helth, age, weakenesse, and sickenesse.
Wherfore, whatsoeuer youre sickenesse is, know you certaynly that it is Gods visitacion.
And for what cause soeuer this sickenesse is sent vnto you: whether it bee to trye your pacience for the example of other and that your fayth maye be founde, in the daye of the Lord, laudable, gloryous and honourable, to the encrease of glory, and endlesse felicitie: Orels it be sente vnto you to correcte and amende in you, whatsoeuer doeth offende the iyes of our heauenly father: knowe you certaynlye, that yf you truely repente you of youre synnes, and beare youre sicknesse paciently, trustyng in Gods mercye, for his deare sonne Iesus Christes sake, and rendre vnto him humble thankes for his fatherly visitacion, submytting your selfe wholy to his will: it shall turne to your profite, helpe you forward in the right way that leadeth vnto euerlasting lyfe.
Take therfore in good worth, the chastement of the Lord: For whom the Lord loueth, he chastiseth.
Yea (as Saincte Paul sayeth,) he scourgeth euery sonne, whiche he receyueth: yf you endure chastisement, he offereth himselfe vnto you as vnto his owne children.
What sonne is he that the father chastiseth not? Yf ye be not vnder correccion (wherof all the true children are partakers) then are ye bastardes and not children.
Therfore seing that whan our carnall fathers doe correct vs, we reuerently obey them, shall we not nowe muche rather be obedient to our spirituall father, and so lyue? And they for a fewe dayes do chastise vs afer their owne pleasure: but he doeth chastise vs for our profite, to thentente he may make vs partakers of his holines.
These wordes, good brother, are Gods wordes, and wrytten in holy scripture for our coumfort and instruccion, that we should paciently and with thankes geuyng, beare oure heauenly fathers correccion: whansoeuer by any maner of aduersitie it shall please his gracious goodnes to visite vs.
And there should be no greater coumfort to christian persons, then to be made lyke vnto Christe, by sufferyng paciently aduersities, troubles, and sickenesses.
For he himselfe went not vp to ioy, but first he suffered payne: he entred not into his glory, before he was crucified.
So truely our waye to eternall ioy, is to suffre here with Christe, and our doore to entre into eternall lyfe: is gladly to dye with Christe, that we may ryse againe from death, and dwell with him in euerlasting lyfe.
Nowe therfore taking your sickenesse, whiche is thus profitable for you, paciently: exhorte you in the name of God, to remembre the profession, which you made vnto God in youre Baptisme.
And forasmuche as after this lyfe, there is accompte to bee geuen vnto the ryghteous iudge, of whom all must be iudged without respect of persons: require you to examine your selfe, your state, both towarde God and manne, so that accusyng and condemning your selfe for your owne faultes, you may fynde mercy at our heaue~ly fathers hand, for Christes sake, and not be accused and condemned in that fearefull iudgeme~t.
Therfore shall shortly rehearse the articles of our fayth, that ye may knowe whether you doe beleue as a christian man should beleue, or no.
Here the minister shall rehearse the articles of the faythe, saying thus.
Doest thou beleue in God the father almightie? And so forth as it is in Baptisme.
This may be done before the minister begyn his prayers as he shall see cause.
Then shall the minister examine whether he be in charitie with all the worlde: Exhortyng hym to forgeue from the botome of his herte, all persons that haue offended hym: and if he haue offended other, to aske them forgeuenesse: and where he hath done iniurie or wrong to any man, that he make amendes to his vttermoste power.
And if he haue not a fore disposed his goodes, let him then make his wyll.
(But men must be oft admonished that they sette an ordre for theyr temporall goodes and landes, whan they be in helth.)
And also to declare his debtes, what he oweth, and what is owyng to hym: for discharging of his conscience, and quietnesse of his executours.
The minister may not forget, nor omitte to moue the sicke person, (and that most earnestly) to lyberalitie toward the poore.
Â¶Here shall the sicke person make a speciall confession, yf he fele his conscience troubled with any weightie matter.
After which confession, the priest shall absolue hym after this forme: and the same forme of absolucion shall be vsed in all pryuate confessions.
OVre Lorde Iesus Christe, who hath lefte power to his Churche to absolue all sinners, whiche truely repente and beleue in hym: of his great mercye forgeue thee thyne offences: and by his autoritie committed to me, absolue thee from all thy sinnes, in the name of the father, and of the sonne, and of the holy gost.
Moste mercifull God, whiche accordyng to the multitude of thy mercies, doest so put awaye the sinnes of those which truely repent, that thou reme~brest the~ nomore: open thy iye of mercy vpon this thy seruaunt: who moste earnestly desireth pardon and forgeuenesse: Renue in him, moste louing father, whatsoeuer hath been decayed by the fraude and malice of the deuill, or by his owne carnal wil, and frailnes: preserue and continue this sicke membre in the vnitie of thy Churche, consider his contricion, accept his teares, aswage his payne as shalbe seen to thee moste expediente for hym.
And forasmuche as he putteth hys full trust only in thy mercy: Impute not vnto hym his former sinnes, but take him vnto thy fauour: through the merites of thy most derely beloued so~ne Iesus Christ.
IN thee, Lorde, haue put my trust, lette me neuer be put to confusion, but ridde me, and deliuer me in thy righteousnes: enclyne thyne eare vnto me, and saue me.
Be thou my strong holde, (wherunto may alwaye resorte) thou haste promysed to helpe me: for thou art my house of defence and my castell.
Deliuer me (O my God) out of the hande of the vngodly: out of the hande of the vnrighteous and cruell manne.
For thou (O Lorde God) art the thyng that long for, thou art my hope euen from my youth.
Through thee haue been holden vp euer since was borne: thou arte he that tooke me out of my mothers wombe, my prayse shalbe alwaye of thee.
am become as it were a monster vnto many: but my sure trust is in thee.
Oh let my mouth be filled with thy prayse (that maye syng of thy glory) and honour all the daye long.
Cast me not awaye in the tyme of age: forsake me not when my strength fayleth me.
For myne enemies speake against me: and they that lay waite for my soule, take their counsayle together, saying: God hath forsaken hym, persecute hym and take him: for there is none to deliuer him.
Goe not ferre from me, God: my God, haste thee to helpe me.
Let them be confounded and perishe, that are agaynste my soule: let them be couered with shame and dishonoure, that seke to doe me euill.
As for me, wyll paciently abyde alwaye: and wyll prayse thee more and more.
My mouth shall dayly speake of thy righteousnesse and saluacion: for knowe no ende therof.
will goe forth in the strength of the Lorde God: and will make mencion of thy righteousnesse onely.
Thou (O God) haste taught me from my youth vp vntill nowe: therfore will tell of thy wondreous workes.
Forsake me not (O God) in myne olde age, when am gray headed: vntill haue shewed thy strength vnto this generacion, thy power to all the~ that are yet for to come.
Thy righteousnesse (O God) is very high, and greate thynges are they that thou haste done: God who is lyke vnto thee? what great troubles and aduersities haste thou shewed me? and yet diddest thou turne and refreshe me: yea, and broughtest me from the depe of the earth agayne.
Thou haste brought me to great honour: and comforted me on euery syde.
Therfore will praise thee, thy faythfulnes (O God) playing vpon an instrument of musicke: vnto thee wyll syng vpon the harpe, thou holy one of Israel.
My lippes will be fayne, when syng vnto thee: and so will my soule whom thou haste deliuered.
My tounge also shall talke of thy ryghteousnesse all the daye long: for they are confounded and brought vnto shame, that seke to doe me euill.
As it was in the begynnyng. &c. Addyng this antheme.
Saueour of the worlde saue vs, whiche by thy crosse and precious bloud haste redemed vs, helpe vs we beseche thee, God.
THe almyghty Lord, whiche is a moste strong tower to all the~ that put their trust in hym, to whom al thinges in heauen, in earth, and vnder earth, doe bowe and obey: be nowe euermore thy defence, and make thee know and fele, that there is no other name vnder heauen geuen to man, in whome and through whome, thou mayest receyue helth and saluation, but onely the name of our Lorde Iesus Christe.
Â¶If the sicke person desyre to be annoynted, then shall the priest annoynte hym vpon the forehead or breast onely, makyng the signe of the crosse, saying thus.
AS with this visible oyle thy body outwardelye is annoynted: so our heauenly father, almightie god, graunt of his infinite goodnes, that thy soule inwardly may be annointed with the holy gost, who is the spirite of al strength, comfort, reliefe, and gladnes.
And vouchesafe for his great mercy (if it be his blessed will) to restore vnto thee thy bodely health, and strength, to serue hym: and sende thee release of all thy paynes, troubles and diseases, both in bodye and mynde.
And howsoeuer his goodnes (by his diuine and vnsearcheable prouidence) shal dispose of thee: we his vnworthy ministers and seruauntes, humbly beseche the eternall maiestie, to doe with thee, accordyng to the multitude of his innumerable mercies, and to pardone thee all thy synnes, and offences, committed by all thy bodely sences, passions, and carnall affeccions: who also vouchesafe mercifullye to graunt vnto thee gostly stre~gth, by his holy spirite, to withstand ouercome al te~ptacions assaultes of thine aduersary, that in no wise he preuaile againste thee, but that thou maist haue perfect victory triumph against the deuil, sine, deth, through Christ our lord: Who by his deth, hath ouercomed the prince of death, with the father, the holy gost euermore liueth reigneth god, world without end.
HOw long wilt thou forget me (O Lord?) for euer? how long wilt thou hyde thy face from me? How long shal seke counsel in my soule? be so vexed in myne heart? how long shal myne enemie tryu~phe ouer me? Consider, and heare me (O Lord my God) lighten myne eyes, that slepe not in death.
Lest myne enemy say, haue preuayled agaynste hym: for if be cast down, they that trouble me will reioyce at it.
But my trust is in thy mercy, and my hearte is ioyful in thy saluacion.
will sing of the lorde, because he hath delte so louyngly with me.
Yea wil prayse the name of the lord the most higheste.
FOra&smuche as all mortall men be subiect to many sodain perilles, diseases, and syckenesses, and euer vncerteyne what tyme they shall departe out of this lyfe: Therefore to the intente they may be alwayes in a redynesse to dye, whensoeuer it shall please almyghtye God to call them: The curates shall dilige~tly from time to time, but specially in the plague time, exhorte theyr parishoners to the ofte receiuing (in the churche) of the holy Communion of the body and bloud of our sauiour Christe: whiche (if they doe) they shall haue no cause in theyr sodayne visitacion, to be vnquieted for lacke of the same.
But if the sycke person be not hable to come to the churche, and yet is desyrous to receyue the Communion in his house, then he must geue knowlege ouer night, or els early in the morning to the curate, sygnifying also how many be appoynted to communicate with him.
And if the same day there be a celebracion of the holy Communion in the churche, then shal the priest reserue (at the open communion) so muche of the sacrament of the body and bloud, as shall serue the sicke person, and so many as shal Communicate with him (if there be any.)
And so soone as he conuenientlye may, after the open Communion ended in the churche, shall goe and minister the same, firste to those that are appoynted to communicate with the sicke (if there be any) and last of al to the sicke persone himselfe.
But before the Curate distribute the holy Communion: the appoynted generall confessyon must be made in the name of the communicantes, the curate adding the absolucion with the comfortable sentences of scripture folowyng in the open Communion: and after the communion ended, the Collecte.
Almightie and euerliuyng God, we moste hartely thanke thee. &c.
Â¶But if the day be not appoynted for the open communion in the churche, then (vpon conuenient warning geuen) the curate shal come and visite the sicke person afore noone.
And hauing a conuenient place in the sycke mannes house (where he may reuerentely celebrate) with all thynges necessary for the same, and not being otherwise letted with the publike seruice or any other iust impediment: he shall there celebrate the holy communion after suche forme and sorte as herafter is appoynted.
Prayse the Lorde, all ye nacions, laude hym all ye people: for hys mercifull kyndenes is confirmed towarde vs, and the trueth of the Lorde endureth for euer.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne. &c. Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Christ haue mercy vpon vs. Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Without any more repeticion.
ALmyghtye euerlyuyng God, maker of mankynde, whiche doeste correct those whome thou doest loue, and chastisest euery one whome thou dost receiue: we beseche thee to haue mercie vpon thys thy seruaunt visited with thy hand, and to graunt that he may take his sickenes paciently, and recouer his bodily health (if it be thy gracyous will) and whansoeuer his soule shall departe from the body, it may without spotte be presented vnto thee: through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
MY sonne despise not the correccion of the lorde, neyther faynt whe~ thou art rebuked of him: for whom the lorde loueth, him he correcteth, yea and he scourgeth euery sonne, whome he receiueth.
Verely verely saye vnto you, he that heareth my woorde, and beleueth on him that sente me, hath euerlasting lyfe, and shall not come vnto damnacyon, but he passeth from death vnto life.
Â¶Lift vp your heartes. &c. Vnto the ende of the Cannon.
Â¶At the time of the distribucion of the holy sacrament, the priest shal first receiue the Communion hymselfe, after minister to them that be appoynted to communicate with the sycke (if there be any) and then to the sicke person.
And the sicke person shal alwayes desire some, eyther of his owne house, or els of hys neighbours, to receiue the holy Communion with hym, for that shall bee to hym a singuler great coumfort, and of theyr parte a great token of charitie.
Â¶And if there bee moe sycke persons to be visited the same day that the Curate dooeth celebrate in anye sycke mannes house: then shall the curate (there) reserue so much of the sacrament of the body and bloud: as shall serue the other sicke persons, and suche as be appoynted to communicate with them, (if there bee anye.)
And shall immediatly cary it, and minister it vnto them.
Â¶But if any man eyther by reason of extremitie of sickenesse, or for lacke of warnyng geuen in due tyme, to the curate, or by any other iuste impediment, doe not receiue the sacrament of Christes body bloud: then the curate shall instruct him, that if he doe truely repent him of his sinnes, and stedfastly beleue that Iesus Christ hath suffered death vpon the crosse for hym: and shed hys bloud for hys redempcion, earnestly remembring the benefites he hath therby, and geuing him heartie thankes therfore: he doth eate and drynke spiritually the body and bloud of our sauiour Christ, profitably to his soules health, althoughe he dooe not receyue the sacramente with his mouth Â¶When the sicke persone is visited and receiueth the holy Communion, all at one tyme: then the priest for more expedicion shall vse this order at the visitacion.
Remember not Lorde. &c. Lorde haue mercie vpon vs. Christe haue mercy vpon vs. Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Â¶Our father whiche art in heauen. &c.
Lorde looke downe from heauen. &c. With the first parte of the exhortacion and all other thynges vnto the Psalme: In thee Lorde haue put my trust.
And if the sicke desyre to be annoyncted, then shall the Prieste vse the appoynted prayer without any Psalme. [leaf motif]THE ORDRE FOR[leaf motif] the Buriall of the dead.
The priest metyng the Corps at the Churche stile, shall say: Or els the priestes and clearkes shall syng, and so goe eyther into the Churche, or towardes the graue.
Am the resurreccion and the lyfe (sayth the Lorde) he that beleueth in me, yea though he were dead, yet shall he lyue.
And whosoeuer lyueth and beleueth in me: shall not dye for euer.
Knowe that my redemer lyueth, and that shall ryse out of the earth in the last day, and shalbe couered again with my skinne, and shall see God in my fleshe: yea and my selfe shall beholde hym, not with other but with these same iyes.
WE brought nothyng into this world, neyther may we carye any thyng out of this worlde.
Euen as it pleaseth the Lorde, so commeth thynges to passe: blessed be the name of the Lorde.
When they come at the graue, whyles the Corps is made ready to be layed into the earth, the priest shall saye, orels the priest and clearkes shall syng.
MAnne that is borne of a woman, hath but a shorte tyme to lyue, and is full of misery: he cummeth vp and is cut downe lyke a floure, he flyeth as it were a shadowe, and neuer continueth in one staye.
Â¶In the myddest of lyfe we be in death, of whom may we seke for succour but of thee, Lorde, which for our sinnes iustly art moued: yet Lorde God moste holy, Lorde moste mighty, holy and moste mercifull sauiour, deliuer vs not into the bytter paynes of eternall death.
Thou knowest, Lorde, the secretes of our heartes, shutte not vp thy mercyfull iyes to oure prayers: But spare vs Lorde moste holy, God moste mighty, holy and mercifull sauiour, thou moste worthy iudge eternal, suffre vs not at our last houre for any paynes of death, to fall from thee.
Then the priest castyng earth vpon the Corps, shall saye.
Commende thy soule to God the father almightie, and thy body to the grounde, earth to earth, asshes to asshes, dust to dust, in sure and certaine hope of resurreccion to eternall lyfe, through our Lorde Iesus Christe, who shall chaunge oure vile body, that it may be lyke to his gloryous body, according to the mighty workyng wherby he is hable to subdue al thinges to himselfe.
Heard a voyce from heauen, saying vnto me: Write, blessed are the dead which dye in the Lord.
Euen so sayeth the spirite, that they rest from their labours.
WE commend into thy ha~des of mercy (most mercifull father) the soule of this our brother departed.
And his body we commit to the earth, beseching thine infinite goodnesse, to geue vs grace to lyue in thy feare and loue, and to dye in thy fauour: that when the iudgemente shall come whiche thou haste committed to thy welbeloued sonne, both this oure brother, and we, may be found acceptable in thy sight, and receyue that blessing, whiche thy welbeloued sonne shall then pronounce to all that loue and feare thee, saying: Come ye blessed children of my father: Receyue the kyngdome prepared for you before the beginning of the worlde.
Graunt this, mercifull father, for the honour of Iesu Christe our onely sauior, mediator, and aduocate.
ALmightye God, we geue thee hertie thankes for this thy seruaunt, whom thou hast deliuered from the miseries of this wretched worlde, from the bodye of death and all temptacion.
And, as we trust, haste brought his soule, which he committed into thy holy handes, into sure consolacion and rest: Graunt we beseche thee, that at the daye of iudgemente, hys soule and all the soules of thy elect, departed out of thys lyfe, may with vs and we with them, fullye receyue thy promisses, and bee made perfite altogether, thorowe the glorious resurreccion of thy sonne Iesus Christe our Lorde.
These psalmes with other suffrages folowing, are to be sayde in the churche, either before or after the buriall of the corps.
Am well pleased that the lorde hath hearde the voyce of my prayer.
That he hath enclined his eare vnto me: therfore will call vpon him as long as liue.
The snares of death compased me round about, and the paynes of hel, gatte hold vpon me: shal finde trouble and heauines, and shall call vpon the name of the Lorde (O Lorde) beseche thee deliuer my soule.
Gracious is the lord, and righteous: yea our god is mercifull.
The lorde preserueth the simple: was in misery and he helped me.
Turne agayn then vnto thy rest, my soule: for the lord hath rewarded thee.
And why? thou hast deliuered my soule from death, mine eyes from teares, and my feete from falling.
will walke before the lorde, in the lande of the liuyng.
What rewarde shall geue vnto the lorde: for all the benefites that he hath done vnto me? wil receiue the cup of saluacion: and cal vpon the name of the Lorde.
wil pay my vowes now in the presence of all his people: right dere in the sight of ye lorde is the death of hys saintes.
Beholde (O Lorde) how that am thy seruaunt: am thy seruaunt and the sonne of thy handemayde, thou haste broken my bondes in sunder.
will offer to thee the sacrifyce of thankes geuyng: and will call vpon the name of the Lorde.
will pay my vowes vnto the lorde in the syghte of all hys people: in the courtes of the Lordes house, euen in the middest of thee, Hierusalem.
&c. Lorde thou hast searched me out, and knowen me.
Thou knowest my downsitting and mine vprising: thou vnderstandest my thoughtes long before.
Thou arte about my path, and about my bed: and spyeste out all my wayes.
For loe there is not a woorde in my tongue: but thou (O Lorde) knowest it altogether.
Thou hast fashioned me, behynde and before: and layed thyne hande vpon me.
Such knowlage is to woonderfull and excellente for me: cannot attayne vnto it.
Whither shall goe then from thy spirite? or whither shall goe then from thy presence? If clime vp into heauen, thou art there: If goe down to hell thou art there also.
If take the winges of the morning, and remaine in the vttermost partes of the sea.
Euen there also shall thy hande leade me: and thy ryght hande shall holde me.
If say: peraduenture the derkenes shal couer me, then shall my night be turned to day.
Yea the darkenes is no darkenes with thee: but the night is all cleare as the day, the darkenes and lyght to thee are both a lyke.
For my reines are thyne, thou hast couered me in my mothers wombe, wil geue thankes vnto thee: for am fearfully, and wunderously made, marueilous are thy woorkes, and that my soule knoweth ryghte well.
My bones are not hyd from thee: though bee made secretly, and fashioned beneath in the yearth.
Thyne eyes did see my substaunce, yet beyng vnperfect: and in thy booke were all my members written.
Whiche daye by daye were fashioned: when as yet there was none of them.
How deare are thy counsels vnto me, God? howe great is the summe of them? If tell them, they are moe in noumbre then the sande: when wake vp, am present with thee.
Wilt thou not sley the wicked, God? departe from me ye bloud thristie men.
For they speake vnrighteously against thee: and thine enemies take thy name in vaine.
Do not hate them, Lorde, that hate thee? and am not greued with those that ryse vp agaynst thee? Yea hate them right soore: euen as though they were myne enemies.
Trye me, God, and seke the grounde of myne heart: proue me, and examine my thoughtes.
Looke well if there be any way of wickednes in me: and leade me in the waye euerlastyng.
As it was in the begynnyng. &c. PRay&se the Lord (O my soule) while lyue will prayse the Lorde: yea as long as haue any beeing, will sing prayses vnto my God.
put not your trust in princes, nor in any childe of man: for there is no helpe in them.
For when the breath of man goeth furth, he shall turne agayne to his earth: and then all his thoughtes perishe.
Blessed is he that hath the God of Iacob for his helpe: and whose hope is in the Lorde his God.
Whiche made heauen and earth, the sea, and al that therin is: whiche kepeth his promyse for euer.
Whiche helpeth them to ryght that suffer wrong: whiche feedeth the hungry.
The Lorde looceth men out of prison: the Lorde geueth sight to the blynde.
The Lorde helpeth them vp that are fallen: the Lorde careth for the righteous.
The Lorde careth for the straungers, he defendeth the fatherlesse and widdowe: as for the waye of the vngodly, he turneth it vpsyde downe.
The Lorde thy God, Sion, shalbe king for euermore: and throughout all generacions.
Then shall folowe this lesson, taken out of the .xv. Chapter to the Corinthians, the first Epistle.
CHri&ste is risen from the dead, and become the firste fruites of them that slepte.
For by a manne came death, and by a manne came the resurreccion of the dead.
For as by Adam all dye: euen so by Christe shall all be made alyue: but euery manne in his owne ordre.
The firste is Christe, then they that are Christes at his commyng.
Then commeth the ende, when he hath delyuered vp the kyngdome to God the father, when he hath put downe all rule and all authoritie and power.
For he must reygne till he haue putte all his enemyes vnder his feete.
But when he sayeth all thinges are put vnder him, it is manifest that he is excepted, whiche did put all thinges vnder hym.
When all thynges are subdued vnto hym, then shall the sonne also hymselfe be subiecte vnto hym that put all thynges vnder him, that God may be all in all.
Els what doe they, which are baptized ouer the dead, if the dead ryse not at all? Why are they then baptized ouer them? Yea, and why stand we alwaye then in ieoperdie? By our reioysing, which haue in Christ Iesu our Lord, dye dayly.
That haue fought with beastes at Ephesus after the maner of men, what auauntageth it me, if the dead ryse not againe? Let vs eate, and drynke, for to morowe we shall dye.
But some manne will say: howe aryse the dead? with what body shall they come? Thou foole, that whiche thou sowest, is not quickened excepte it dye.
And what sowest thou? Thou sowest not that body that shalbe: but bare corne, as of weate, or of some other: but God geueth it a body at his pleasure, to euery seede his owne body.
All fleshe is not one maner of fleshe: but there is one maner of fleshe of me~, an other maner of fleshe of beastes, an other of fishes, and an other of birdes.
There are also celestiall bodyes, and there are bodyes terrestriall.
But the glory of the celestiall is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is an other.
There is one maner glory of the sunne, and an other glory of the moone, and an other glory of the starres.
It is sowen in corrupcion, it riseth agayne in incorrupcion.
It is sowen in dishonoure, it ryseth agayne in honoure.
It is sowen in weakenes; it riseth againe in power.
It is sowen a naturall body, it ryseth agayne a spirituall bodie.
There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body: as it is also written: the first man Adam was made a lyuing soule, and the last Adam was made a quicknyng spirite.
Howebeit that is not fyrst which is spirituall: but that whiche is naturall, and then that which is spirituall.
The first man is of the earth, earthy: The seconde manne is the Lorde from heauen (heauenly.)
As is the earthy, suche are they that are earthy.
And as is the heauenly, such are they that are heauenly.
And as we haue borne the image of the earthy, so shal we beare the ymage of the heauenly.
This saie brethren, that fleshe and bloud can not enherite the kingdome of God: Neither doth corrupcion inherite vncorrupcion.
We shal not al slepe, but we shall al be chaunged, and that in a momente, in the twynkelyng of an iye by the laste trumpe.
For the trumpe shal blowe, the dead shal rise incorruptible, and we shalbe chaunged.
For this corruptible must put on incorrupcion:& this mortal must put on immortalitie.
When this corruptible hath put on incorrupcion, this mortal hath put on immortalitie: then shal be brought to passe the saying that is writte~: Death is swalowed vp in victory: Death where is thy sting? Hell where is thy victory? The sting of death is synne: the stre~gth of sinne is the law.
But tha~kes be vnto God, which hath geuen vs victory, through our lord Iesus Christ.
Therfore my deare brethre~, be ye steadfast vnmouable, alwaies riche in the worke of the lord, forasmuch as ye know, how that your labour is not in vaine, in the lord.
Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Christ haue mercy vpon vs. Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Â¶Oure father which art in heauen. &c.
Lorde, with whome do liue the spirites of them that be dead: and in whome the soules of them that be elected, after they be delyuered from the burden of the fleshe, be in ioy and felicitie: Graunte vnto this thy seruaunt, that the sinnes which he committed in this world be not imputed vnto him, but that he, escaping the gates of hell, paynes of eternal darckenes, may euer dwel in the region of light, with Abraham, Isaac, and Iacob, in the place where is no wepyng, sorowe, nor heauynes: and when that dredful day of the generall resurreccion shall come, make hym to ryse also with the iust and righteous, and receiue thys body againe to glory, then made pure and incorruptible: set him on the righte hande of thy sonne Iesus Christ, among thy holy and elect, that then he maye heare with them these most swete and coumfortable wordes: Come to me ye blessed of my father, possesse the kyngdo~e which hath bene prepared for you from the begynning of the world: Graunte this we beseche thee, mercyfull father, through Iesus Christ our mediatour and redemer.
Amen. [leaf motif]THE CELEBRACION[leaf motif] of the holy Communion when there is a Burial of the dead.
LYke as the hart desireth the water brookes: so longeth my soule after thee, God.
My soule is a thirst for god, yea, euen for the liuing god: when shall come to appeare before the presence of God? My teares haue beene my meate day and nighte: whyle they dayly say vnto me, where is nowe thy god? Nowe when thinke thereupon, powre out my heart by my selfe: for went with the multitude, and brought them furth vnto the house of God, in the voyce of praise and thankesgeuing, emong suche as kepe holy day.
Why art thou so full of heauines (O my soule) and why art thou so vnquiete within me? Put thy trust in god, for wil yet geue him thankes, for the helpe of his countenaunce.
My God, my soule is vexed within me: therefore will remember thee concerning the land of Iordane, and the litle hill of Hermonim.
One deepe calleth an other because of the noyse of thy water pypes: al thy waues and stormes are gone ouer me.
The lorde hath graunted his louing kyndenesse on the daye tyme: and in the nighte season dyd syng of hym, and made my prayer vnto the god of my lyfe.
will say vnto the God of my strength, why haste thou forgotten me? why goe thus heauelye, whyle the enemye oppresseth me? My bones are smitten a soonder, whyle myne enemies (that trouble me) cast me in the teeth: namely while they say dayly vnto me, where is nowe thy God? Why art thou so vexed (O my soule) and why arte thou so disquieted within me? put thy trust in god, for will yet thanke hym whiche is the helpe of my countenaunce, and my God.
Glory be to the father, and to the sonne: to the holy gost.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer shall be: worlde without ende.
Mercifull god the father of oure lord Iesu Christ, who is the resurreccion and the life: In whome whosoeuer beleueth shall liue thoughe he dye: And whosoeuer liueth, and beleueth in hym, shall not dye eternally: who also hath taught vs (by his holye Apostle Paule) not to bee sorye as men without hope for them that slepe in him: We mekelye beseche thee (o father) to raise vs from the death of sin, vnto the life of righteousnes, that when we shall departe this lyfe, we maye slepe in him (as our hope is this our brother doeth) and at the general resurreccion in the laste daie, both we and this oure brother departed, receiuyng agayne our bodies, and risinge againe in thy moste gracious fauoure: maye with all thine elect Saynctes, obteine eternall ioye.
Graunt this, Lord god, by the meanes of our aduocate Iesus Christ: whiche with thee and the holy ghoste, liueth and reigneth one God for euer.
Would not brethren that ye shoulde bee ignoraunt concernyng them whiche are fallen a slepe, that ye sorowe not as other doe, which haue no hope.
For if wee beleue that Iesus dyed, and rose agayne: euen so them also whiche slepe by Iesus, wyll God brynge againe with him.
For this saie we vnto you in the woorde of the Lord: that we whiche shall lyue, and shall remaine in the cummynge of the Lorde, shall not come ere they whiche slepe.
For the Lorde himselfe shall descende from heauen with a shoute and the voice of the Archangell and troump of God.
And the deade in Christ shall arise firste: then wee whiche shall lyue (euen wee whiche shall remayne) shall bee caughte vp wyth them also in the cloudes, to meete the Lorde in the ayre.
Wherefore coumforte youre selues one an other wyth these woordes.
IE&sus sayed to his disciples and to the Iewes: All that the father geueth me, shall come to me: and he that commeth to me, cast not away.
For came down from heauen: not to doe that will, but that he will whiche hath sent me.
And this is the fathers will whiche hath sente me: that of all whiche he hath geuen me, shall lose nothing: but raise them vp again at the last day.
And this is the wyll of hym that sent me: that euery one which seeth the sonne and beleueth on him, haue euerlasting lyfe.
And wil raise hym vp at the laste daye. [leaf motif]THE ORDRE OF THE[leaf motif] Purification of weomen.
The woman shall come into the churche, and there shall kneele downe in some conueniente place, nygh vnto the quier doore: and the prieste standyng by her, shall saye these woordes or suche lyke, as the case shall require.
FOr asmuche as it hath pleased almightie god of his goodnes to geue you safe deliueraunce, and your childe baptisme, and hath preserued you in the greate daunger of childebirth: ye shal therefore geue heartie tha~kes vnto god, and pray.
Haue lifted vp mine iyes vnto the hilles: from whence cummeth my helpe? My help cummeth euen from the lord: whiche hath made heauen and earth.
He will not suffer thy foote to be moued: and he that kepeth thee will not slepe.
Beholde, he that kepeth Israell: shall neyther slumber nor slepe.
The lorde himselfe is thy keper: the lorde is thy defence vpon thy right hande.
So that the sunne shall not burne thee by daye: neyther the moone by nyght.
The lord shall preserue thee from all euill: yea it is euen he that shall kepe thy soule.
The lord shall preserue thy going out, and thy cummyng in: from this tyme furth for euermore.
Glorye be to the father, and to the sonne. &c.
As it was in the beginning, is nowe, and euer. &c. Lord haue mercie vpon vs. Christ haue mercie vpon vs. Lorde haue mercie vpon vs. Â¶Our father whiche art in heauen. &c.
Almyghtye God, which hast delyuered thys woman thy seruaunt from the great payne and perill of childbirth: Graunt we beseche thee (most mercyfull father) that she through thy helpe may both faithfully lyue, and walke in her vocacion accordyng to thy will in thys lyfe present: and also maye be partaker of euerlastyng glory in the lyfe to come: through Iesus Christe oure Lorde.
The woman that is purifyed, must offer her Crisome, and other accustomed offeringes.
And if there be a communion, it is conuenient that she receiue the holy communion.
Â¶After mattens ended, the people beyng called together by the rynging of a bel, and assembled in the churche: Thinglishe letanye shall be sayed after thaccustomed maner: whiche ended, the prieste shall goe into the pulpitte, and saie thus.
BRethre~, in the primatiue churche there was a godlye discipline, that at the begynning of lente suche persones as were notorious sinners, were put to open penaunce, and punished in this worlde, that theyr soules myght be saued in the daye of the Lorde.
And that other, admonyshed by theyr example, mighte be more afrayed to offende.
In the steede whereof vntill the sayde disciplyne maye be restored agayne: (whyche thynge is muche to be wished) it is thoughte good that at this tyme (in your presence) shoulde be read the generall sentences of goddes cursing agaynst impenitent synners, gathered out of the xxvii.
To the intente that you beyng admonished of the greate indignacion of God agaynste synners: maye the rather be called to earneste and true repentaunce, and maye walke more warely in these daungerous dayes, fleyng fro~ suche vices, for the which ye affirme with your owne mouthes: the curse of God to be due.
Â¶Cursed is the manne that maketh any carued or molten image, an abominacion to the Lord, the worke of the handes of the craftes manne, and putteth it in a secrete place to wurship it.
Cursed is he that remoueth awaie the marke of his neighbours land.
Cursed is he that maketh the blinde to goe oute of his waye.
Cursed is he that letteth in iudgement the right of the straungier, of them that be fatherlesse, and of widowes.
Cursed is he that taketh rewarde to slea the soule of innocent bloude.
Cursed is he that putteth his trust in ma~, taketh manne for his defence, and in his hearte goeth from the Lorde.
Cursed are the vnmercifull, the fornicatours and aduouterers, the couetous persones, the wurshyppers of images, slaundreers, drunkardes, and extorcioners.
NOwe seeing that al they bee accursed (as the Prophete Dauid beareth witnesse) whiche doe erre goe astray from the commaundementes of God, let vs (remembring the dredeful iudgement hanging ouer our heades, and being alwayes at hande) returne vnto our lorde God, with al contricion and mekenes of heart, bewailing and lamenting our synful lyfe, knowlagyng and confessing our offences, and seekyng to bring furth worthie fruites of penance.
For euen now is the axe put vnto the roote of the trees, so that euery tree whiche bryngeth not furth good fruite, is hewen downe and cast into the fier.
It is a fearefull thing to fall into the handes of the lyuing God: he shall powre downe rayne vpon the synners, snares, fyer, brimstone, storme and tempest: this shalbe theyr porcion to drinke.
For loe the lorde is cummen out of his place, to visite the wickednes of suche as dwell vpon the earth.
But who may abyde the daye of his cumming? who shalbee hable to endure whan he appeareth? His fanne is in his hande, and he will pourge his floore, gather his wheate into the barne, but he will burne the chaffe with vnquencheable fier.
The day of the lorde cummeth as a thiefe vpon the night, and when men shal say peace, and al thinges are safe: then shall sodayne destruccion come vpon them, as sorowe cometh vpon a woman trauaillyng with childe, and they shall not escape: then shall appeare the wrathe of God in the daye of vengeaunce, whiche obstinate synners through the stubbernes of their hearte, haue heaped vnto themselfe, whiche despised the goodnesse, pacience and long sufferaunce of god, when he called the~ continually to repentaunce.
Then shall they call vpon me (sayth the lorde) but will not heare: they shal seke me early, but they shall not finde me, and that because they hated knowlage, receiued not the feare of the lord, but abhorred my cou~sell and despised my correccio~: then shal it be too late to knocke, when the doore shalbe shut, too late to cry for mercy, when it is the time of iustice.
terrible voice of most iust iudgeme~t, which shalbe pronounced vpon them, when it shalbe sayde vnto them.
Go ye cursed into the fyer euerlasting, whiche is prepared for the deuill and his angels.
Therfore brethren take we hede by time, while the day of saluacion lasteth, for the night cometh when none can worke: but let vs while we haue the light, beleue in the light, and walke as the childre~ of the lyghte, that we bee not caste into the vtter derkenes, where is wepyng and gnashing of teeth.
Let vs not abuse the goodnes of god, whiche calleth vs mercifully to amendement, and of his endlesse pitie, promiseth vs forgeuenes of that whiche is past: if (with a whole mind and a true heart) we returne vnto him: for though our sinnes bered as scarlet, they shalbe as white as snowe, and though they be lyke purple, yet shall they be as white as woolle.
Turne you cleane (sayeth the lord) from all your wickednes, and your synne shall not be your destruccion.
Cast away from you all your vngodlynes that ye haue doen, make you new heartes and a newe spirite: wherfore wil ye dye, ye house of Israel? seing haue no pleasure in the death of him that dieth (saith the Lord God.)
Although we haue sinned yet haue we an aduocate with the father Iesus Christ the righteous, he it is that obteyneth grace for our sinnes, for he was wounded for our offences, and smitten for our wickednes: let vs therfore returne vnto him, who is the mercifull receiuer of all true penitent sinners, assuryng our selfe that he is ready to receiue vs, and most willing to pardon vs, if we come to him with faithfull repentaunce: yf we wyll submit our selues vnto hym, and from henceforth walke in his wayes: yf we will take his easy yoke and light burden vpon vs to folow him in lowlynesse, pacience, and charitie, and bee ordred by the gouernaunce of his holy spirite, sekyng alwaies his glorie, and seruing hym duely in our vocacion with thankes geuing.
This if we doe, Christe will deliuer vs from the curse of the lawe, and from the extreme malediccion whiche shal lyght vpon them that shalbee set on the left hand: and he will set vs on his right hand, and geue vs the blessed benediccion of his father, commaunding vs to take possession of his glorious kyngdome, vnto the whiche he vouchsafe to bring vs all, for his infinite mercie.
Â¶Then shall they all kneele vpon theyr knees: And the prieste and clearkes kneeling (where they are accustomed to saye the letanie) shall saye this psalme.
HAue mercie vpon me (O God) after thy greate goodnesse: according vnto the multitude of thy mercies, do away mine offences.
Washe me throwly fro my wickednes: and clense me from my synne.
For knowlage my faultes, and my sinne is euer before me.
Against thee only haue synned, and done this euill in thy syght: that thou myghtest bee iustified in thy saying and clere when thou art iudged.
Behold, was shapen in wickednes, and in sinne hath my mother conceiued me.
But loe, thou requirest trueth in the inward partes, and shalte make me to vnderstande wysedome secretelye.
Thou shalt pourge me with Hope, and shall bee cleane: thou shalt washe me, and shall bee whyter then snowe.
Thou shalte make me heare of ioye and gladnesse, that the bones whiche thou haste broken, maye reioyce.
Turne thy face from my synnes, and putte out all my mysdedes.
Make me a cleane hearte (O God) and renue a ryght spirite within me.
Caste me not awaye from thy presence, and take not thy holy spirite from me.
geue me the coumforte of thy helpe agayne, and stablishe me with thy free spirite.
Then shall teache thy wayes vnto the wicked, and sinners shall bee conuerted vnto thee.
Deliuer me from bloud giltinesse (O God) thou that art the god of my health: and my toungue shall syng of thy righteousnesse.
Thou shalt open my lippes (O Lorde:) my mouthe shall shewe thy prayse.
For thou desyreste no sacrifice, els woulde geue it thee: but thou deliteste not in burnt offeryng.
The sacrifice of God is a troubled spirite, a broken and a contrite herte (O God) shalt thou not despise.
be fauourable and gracious vnto Sion, build thou the walles of Hierusalem.
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifyce of righteousnesse, with the burnt offerynges, and oblacions: then shall they offre young bullockes vpon thyne aultare.
Glorye be tho the father, and to the sonne: to the holy gost.
As it was in the begynning is nowe, euer shalbe: worlde without ende.
Â¶Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Â¶Christe haue mercy vpon vs. Â¶Lorde haue mercy vpon vs. Our father whiche art in heauen. &c.
And for the glory of thy names sake delyuer vs, be mercyfull vnto vs synners, for thy names sake.
Lord, we besech thee mercifully heare our praiers, and spare all those whiche confesse theyr synnes to thee, that they (whose consciences by synne are accused) by thy mercyfull pardon may be absolued, through Christe oure Lorde.
Most mightie God and mercyfull father, whiche hast compassion of al menne, and hateste nothing that thou haste made: which wouldeste not the death of a synner, but that he should rather turne from synne bee saued: mercyfully forgeue vs our trespasses, receyue and coumforte vs, which be grieued and weried with the burde~ of our synne: Thy propertie is to haue mercie, to thee onely it apperteineth to forgeue sinnes: spare vs therfore, good Lorde, spare thy people whom thou hast redemed.
Enter not into iudgement with thy seruauntes, which be vyle yearth, and myserable synners: But so turne thy ire from vs, which mekely knowlege our vilenes, and truly repent vs of our fautes: so make haste to helpe vs in thys worlde: that wee maye euer lyue with thee in the worlde to come: through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
TVrne thou vs, good Lorde, and so shall we be turned: bee fauourable (O Lorde) bee fauourable to thy people, which turne to thee in weping, fasting and praying: for thou art a merciful god, full of compassion, long sufferyng, and of a great pietie.
Thou sparest when we deserue punishemente, and in thy wrathe thynkest vpon mercy.
Spare thy people, good Lorde, spare them, and lette not thyne heritage bee broughte to confusion: Heare vs (O Lorde) for thy mercy is greate, and after the multitude of thy mercyes looke vpon vs. .Â·. [leaf motif]OF CEREMONIES[leaf motif] Why some be abolished and some retayned.
OF suche Ceremonies as be vsed in the Churche, and haue had their beginnyng by thinstitucion of man: Some at the first were of godly intent and purpose deuised, and yet at length turned to vanitie and supersticio~: Some entred into the Church by vndiscrete deuocion, and suche a zele as was without knowleage: and forbecause they were winked at in the beginning, they grewe dayly to more and more abuses, whiche not onely for their vnprofitablenesse, but also because they haue muche blynded the people, and obscured the glory of God, are worthy to be cut away, and cleane reiected.
Other there be, whiche although they haue been deuised by man: yet it is thought good to reserue them still, aswell for a decent ordre in the Churche (for the whiche they were first deuised) as because they pertaine to edificacion: Wherunto all thynges doen in the Churche (as the Apostle teacheth) ought to be referred.
And although the kepyng or omittyng of a ceremonie (in it selfe considered) is but a small thing: Yet the wilful and conte~ptuous transgression, and breaking of a common ordre, and discipline, is no smal offence before God.
Let al thinges bee done emong you (sayeth Saincte Paule) in a semely and due ordre.
The appointeme~te of the which ordre, pertaineth not to priuate menne: Therfore no manne ought to take in hande, nor presume to appointe or alter any publike or common ordre in Christes Churche, excepte he be lawfully called and autorized therunto.
And whereas in this our tyme, the myndes of menne bee so diuerse, that some thynke it a greate matter of conscience to departe from a peece of the leaste of theyr Ceremonies (they bee so addicted to theyr olde customes) and agayne on the other syde, some bee so newe fangle that they woulde innouate all thyng, and so doe despyse the olde that nothyng canne lyke them, but that is newe: It was thought expediente not so muche to haue respecte howe to please and satisfye eyther of these parties, as howe to please God, and profite them bothe.
And yet leste any manne should bee offended (whom good reaso~ might satisfie) here be certaine causes rendered, why some of the accustomed Ceremonies be put awaye, and some be retained and kept still.
Some are put awaye, because the great excesse and multitude of them hathe so encreased in these latter daies, that the burthen of them was intollerable: wherof saincte Augustine in his tyme complained, that they were growen to suche a noumbre: that the state of christian people was in wurse case (concerning that matter) then were the Iewes.
And he counsayled that suche yocke and burthen shoulde be taken awaye, as tyme woulde serue quietely to doe it.
But what woulde saincte Augustine haue sayed yf he hadde seen the Ceremonies of late dayes vsed among vs? wherunto the multitude vsed in his tyme was not to bee compared.
This our excessiue multitude of Ceremonies, was so great, and many of them so darke: that they dyd more confounde, and darken, then declare and setteforth Christes benefites vnto vs.
And besides this, Christes Gospell is not a Ceremoniall lawe (as muche of Moses lawe was,) but it is a religion to serue God, not in bondage of the figure or shadowe: but in the freedome of spirite, beeyng contente onelye with those ceremonies whiche doe serue to a decente ordre and godlye discipline, and suche as bee apte to stirre vppe the dulle mynde of manne, to the remembraunce of his duetie to God, by some notable and speciall significacion, whereby he might bee edified.
Â¶Furthermore, the most weightie cause of the abolishement of certaine Ceremonies was, that they were so farre abused, partely by the supersticious blindenes of the rude and vnlearned, and partelye by the vnsaciable auarice of suche as soughte more theyr owne lucre then the glorie of God: that the abuses coulde not well bee taken awaye, the thing remayning styll.
But nowe as concerning those persones, whiche peraduenture will bee offended for that some of the olde Ceremonies are retained still: Yf they consyder, that wythoute some Ceremonies it is not possible to kepe anye ordre or quite discipline in the church: they shall easilye perceiue iuste cause to refourme theyr iudgementes.
And yf they thinke muche that anye of the olde dooe remayne, and woulde rather haue all deuised a newe: then suche menne (grauntyng some Ceremonies conueniente to bee hadde) surelye where the olde maye bee well vsed: there they cannot reasonablye reproue the olde (onelye for their age) withoute bewraying of theyr owne folye.
For in such a case they oughte rather to haue reuerence vnto them for theyr antiquitie, yf they wyll declare themselues to bee more studious of vnitie and concorde, then of innouacions and newe fanglenesse, whiche (as muche as maye bee with the trewe setting foorthe of Christes religion) is alwayes to bee eschewed.
Furthermore, suche shall haue no iuste cause with the Ceremonies reserued, to bee offended: for as those bee taken awaye whiche were moste abused, dydde burden mennes consciences withoute any cause: So the other that remaine are retained for a discipline, and ordre, whiche (vpon iust causes) may be altered and chaunged, and therfore are not to be estemed egual with goddes lawe.
And moreouer they be neyther darke nor dumme ceremonies, but are so set forth that euery man may vnderstande what they dooe meane, and to what vse they do serue.
So that it is not like that they, in time to come, shoulde be abused as the other haue been.
And in these all our dooynges wee condemne no other nacions, nor prescribe anye thing, but to oure owne people onelye.
For we thinke it conueniente that euery countreye should vse suche ceremonies, as they shall thynke beste to the setting foorth of goddes honour glorye: and to the reducyng of the people to a moste perfecte and Godly lyuing, without errour or supersticion: and that they shoulde putte awaye other thinges, whiche from time to time they perceyue to be moste abused, as in mennes ordinaunces it often chaunceth diuerslye in diuerse countreyes. *** [leaf motif]CERTAYNE NOTES[leaf motif] for the more playne explicacion and decent ministracion of thinges, conteined in thys booke.

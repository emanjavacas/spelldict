And whan sawe this cruell syght than fayled of my strength than wexed my sorowe newe whan sawe hym for moche people myght not come nere hym cryed to hy~ he myght not here me for the people that folowed hym.
And than sayd my systers to me go we mary by this way for this is the nere waye than we shall mete with your sone speke with hym or he dye than rose vp as a woman strengthed with a newe spyryte and wente fast on that sodeynly mette with my sone Ihesu in the way beringe the crosse vpon his backe than sayd wordes to my swete sone Ihesu.

And ye wycked Iewes co~strayned a man we called hym Symeon to bere the crosse to a place was called Caluarye than the cruell Iewes smote my sone Ihesu with theyr fete bete hym with scourges made hymselfe bere it vpon his backe vp at the mou~t of caluarye.
And thus hyed the wycked Iewes to offre vp that lothles lambe.
And without all other that was my swete sone Ihesu than Mary moost sorowfull of all moders pursued after my swete sone Ihesu as fast as myght to se what deth ye lambe sholde suffre that was my solace my Ioye vnnethes myght come to the mount of caluarye but as was susteyned by my systers so wery ful of woo was in my body by the tyme that came to the mou~t of caluary the wycked Iewes had done my sone vpon the crosse arered vp the crosse and put it in the erth than loked vpon my swete sone Ihesu wt my wepynge eyen byt+terly wepynge cryenge sayd to hym these wordes.

And whan my swete sone Ihesu herde me thus crye wepe he caste his eyen vpon me vnnethes he sayd to me these wordes.
Woma~ be of good comforte for herefore came in to this worlde herefo+re toke this body of the yt here hangeth on the crosse to daye for to helpe mannes soule to bye the soules out of payne that were lost for synne therfore suffre this cruell harde passyon that thou seest therfore moder rest now of thy wepynge of thy cryeng for this is my faders wyl also moder let it be thy wyll so in dyenge shall slee the deth wt the vyctorye of my passyon shall ryse the thyrde day.
And herefore moder take here that meane tyme Iohan my dyscyple that loue well let hym be thy sone be thou his moder to hym take the to warde for now shall dye on the crosse.
And whan my sone Ihesu had sayd these wordes he cast vp his eyen to heuen betoke to his fader his soule and soo with a grete crye yelded vp his ghost than Marye fell downe vpon the erth all the people wende had ben deed.
And aboute ye houre of none there came cruell knyghtes and stode before my sone one of them with a spere opened his syde and claue his herte in two and that sorowe clefte my herte in two.
And whan my sones syde was opened and his herte clouen a two than wente the knightes theyr way.
And than came Ioseph of arinathye a noble man and a ryghtfull and wolde ha+ue taken downe my swete sone Ihesus of the crosse whan sawe hym wexed quycke agayne in my spyryte and toke strength to me and sayd.

And whan Ioseph had sayd these wordes to me was somwhat com+forted therwith helped to wasshe my sones body that was defouled with spyttynge betynge bledynge.
And whan we had wasshed it we wyped it anoyntes it so at the last was smyten with a newe sorowe than sayd these wordes to my swete sone there he laye deed.

And whan had sayd these wordes fell dow+ne vpon the body of my swete sone Ihesu wepynge byt+terly and cryenge sore.
And than kyssed the woundes of his heed than his handes and than his fete.
And than the wou~de in the syde and than cleped all the bo+dy in myne armes and kyssed it and sayd these wordes.

The Supremacie of Christian Princes, ouer all persons throughout their dominions, in all causes so wel Ecclesiastical as temporall, both against the Counterblast of Thomas Stapleton, replying on the Reuerend father in Christe, Robert Bishop of VVinchester: and also Against Nicolas Sanders his Uisible Monarchie of the Romaine Church, touching this controuersie of the Princes Supremacie.

[Figure: HONI SOIT QVI MAL PENSE E. [Figure: royal blazon] To the moste high and moste excellent Princesse Elizabeth, by the grace of God, Queene of Englande, France, and Ireland, defender of the Faith of Christ, and in earth next vnder God, of the Church of England and Ireland, in all Ecclesiastical and temporall causes, the supreme Head Gouernor.
ALbeit most Gracious Soueraigne) might be vvoorthily noted of presumption, in dedicating these my trauailes to your Maiestie, as vvel for the basenesse of my skill calling, as for the vnreuerent demeanour of the aduersaries that here ansvvere, vnvvorthie vvhom your Highnesse should deigne to loke vpon: yet, bothe bicause the matter entreateth moste of a Princes estate, and that vpon the chiefest point therof, belonging in general to al Christian Princes, but in especiall to your Maiestie, against vvhom they chiefly direct their malice, and in maintenaunce vvhereof your Maiestie direct your gouernement, and herein haue giuen a mirror to al christian Princes to folovv, and be partakers in their common vveales, of the lyke blessings, wherwith God hath beautified your Highnesse, and established youre authoritie: thought it therfore not vnfit (setting my self and them aside, with all such by matters as incidently fal out in disputation, betvvixt the Bishop and master Feckenham, of me these my aduersaries· to conecrate this argumente of Supremacie to youre moste excellent Maiestie, as to vvhom chiefly in your dominions, next vnder Christ it dothe pertaine.
VVhich your Highnesse so nobly maintaines by practise of godlie gouernment, hovve euer we by the vvord and argument do defend it.
There is no controuersie at this day betvvixt vs and the enimies of the gospel more impughed, tha~ this one of the Supremacie, nor more bookes compiled more libels scattered, more vaunts made of truth on their partie, more sclaunders deuised of oure doctrine, and your Maiesties Title, more secrete conspiracies and open treasons against your Royal person and state of the Realme: than our aduersaries make, only for this Supremacie.
Shall Sathan then vse al this double diligence, in promoting the pride tyrannie of his Antichrist, the man of sinne, the foreigne vsurper of all Christian kingdoms: and shall the children of God.
be negligent in defence of the kingdom of Christ, of the Lordes anoynted, of the dutifull office and lavvfull authoritie of their naturall Soueraigne· Other meanes (I graunt) may be had to suppresse their furious dealing.
And God bee blessed therefore that hath furnished your Maiestie vvith povver, cou~sell, authoritie, lavv, vvisedome learning, vertue, courage, and al other Princely habilities· suffiiet to maintein your Highnesse Title, protect that portion of Christes Church, vvhich he hath committed to your most Gracious gouernment, in peace and truth prosperously, your enemies.
VVherein as your Maiestie hath euer most zlously sought and set forth the glorie of god, hath so glorified you again, as he hath promised, glorificabo: that your highnesse may say as king Dauid sayd· he hath deliuered you out of your enimies hands, and defeated all their purposes, he hath established you a kingdom here on earth in peace and righteousnesse, and hath prepared in heauen a Kingdom for you in glorie and eternitie.
Novv although this be so cleee, that euen the enimies themselues co~fesse, God vvorks vvith you, God fights for you, God hath take~ your hart into his handes, that haue taken his quarel into yours: yet sith the do mutte sclander your Highnesse, to take suche kind of Gouernme~t on you, as vvere not co~petent, as the Pope had vvont to do, your Highnes is furthest from: if this your claime be not proued to be grou~dedon Gods vvord, if those enuious be not co~inced by euident argume~ts of the seripture, al the foresaid prosperitie is cou~ted but earthly blessings, and such as other vvorldly Princes haue.
All the due authoritie is but extorted violence: neither is the mouth of the adoersarie stopped, neyther is the mind of the subiect satisfied.
And therfore vvhen al is don· there is no better mean to may this Title, than euen by learning for to me it to the vttermost, and to fight vvit the vveapon of Gods vvord for it, vvhiches sharpe to vvonde the aduersaries heart and conscience, than any tvvo edged svvord.
But some vvil say, this is sufficiently done, by other learned labours, vvhen both in the dayes of your Maiesties Father of most renoumed memorie, euen the best learned of our aduersaries did not only confesse it, but vvrote so effectually in defence therof, that shamefully aftervvard reuolting, their guiltie conscie~cebore vvitnesse against themselues, nor they coulde euer ansvvere their ovvne vvritings.
And also after that, in the godlie gouernment of youre Highnesse blessed Brother, many other more excellent fathers, in vvriting did confirme it.
And novv lastly in this your Maiesties happie Reigne, diuers famous and lerned men, to the further confirming of the godlie, and confounding the enimie therein, haue vvritten vppon this argument.
Yet sith oure aduersaries haue neuer doone thervvith, but sette on a freshe, lyke to him that vvhen in vvrastling he was euer cast, of pride and vainglorie vvoulde neuer acknovvledge that he had any fall: thought good to make euident to all your Maiesties subiects, euen to the enimies themselues, the places vvhere they shamefully fel, and lie stil in their errour, rather than to vvrastle vvith such vvarblers.
And yet if they start vp again, to trie a further pluck vvith them, and by the strength of Gods inuincible truth, so to ouerthrovv them: that as fast as they boast, cauill, and sclaunder: the truth of our cause, and the goodnesse of your Maiesties quarell, shall shevve it selfe the cleerer, although the simplier handled.
number of other vvhom knovve, coulde haue done it farre better, vvho may also at their discretions further trauaile in it.
And in deede (vvhere the most of this vvas done a good vvhile sith) it vvas layde aside thus long, expecting if any other vvould attempte it.
But sith none hath aduentured on it, thought it my dutie to yeelde to the godlie and vrgent requestes of those personages, that vnderstanding had priuately delte therin, required the publishing of my labours, to the vvhich condescended a great deale the vvillinger, partly bicause it touched vvithall, the defence of that Reuerende fathers innocencie and learning, the Bishop of VVinchester, vvho had, although briefly, yet most orderly and exactly, handled this questio~ before, and vvas oppugned by this aduersarie, neither vvas it for diuers causes thought so co~uenient for the Bishop himselfe to ansvvere, and for my part was bounde in so iust a cause to defend him.
But chiefly for that it spared not most opprobriously to slaunder your most excelle~t Maiestie, your title, your state, your gouernment, your most honorable and godlie Cou~saile, your nobilitie, your Bishops, your clergie, your magistrats, your iustices, your people, and all estates of your dominions, your doctrine, your faith, your religion, yea the truth and glorie of God, vvhich your Highnesse defendes, to all vvhich, and all other are bounde in principall.
thought not good therefore to stay it any longer, and suffer these vncircumcised Philistines blaspheming the truth of God, reproching the Lords anoynted, and rayling on the hoste of Israel, to stand thus and vaunt vnansvvered: but lette this ansvvere that had thus farforth made in priuate· come abrode to others.
Promising (god vvilling) by your Maiesties fauourable protection, to deale further vvith them, and to shevvethe continuall practise hereof, hovve in all ages, since Christendome began to flourishe vnder the Great Constantine, that christian Emperors, Kings and Princes, haue dealte as doth your Maiestie in the ouersight of Ecclesiastical matters, till the Pope by little and little encroching on them, not onely spoyled them of this their chief authoritie, but of their temporal estates and vvorldly kingdoms, yea of their goodes liues also.
In the meane season for this that is here alreadie ansvvered vnto, most humbly craue your Highnesse acceptation, vvhose right is here defended by truth from sclanders, that by iustice defendeth our right from iniuries.
Most hartily beseeching almightie God, as he hitherto hath vouchsafed, so to blesse, preserue, continue and prosper your Royal Maiestie, to the lo~g establishing of your Highnes Throne, to the vtter vanquishing of all your spirituall and bodily, priuie and open enimies, to the godlie comforte and quiet gouernment of all your faithful subiects, and to the prosperous aduancement of Gods euerlasting glorie, thorough Iesus Christe.
IT is nowe a good while since (deare Christian Reader) that this maister Stapletons Counterblast was blowne ouer the seas from Louaine, against the Reuerende father in Christe, the Bishop of Winchester, or rather against the Quenes Maiestie and hir Supremacie, was thus farre answered vnto, as here is nowe set foorth.
Which may easily be perceiued by the reading, for there is little or nothing altered, except a sentence or two here there added, as things haue falne out since.
speake this, that thou shouldest not here loke for any great or exquisite penning, thinking that after so lo~g a leysure some more notable and exacter answere should come forth.
Our aduersaries vaunt much of their wittes herein, and chiey this my matefellow master Stapleton, to be verie fresh pregnant in readinesse of answering, for he is his mothers sonne, and hath it on his fingers ends.
Howbeit, may say to these, as Apelles sayd to one, who when he had drawne a picture: Lo (quoth he) did this apace.
And thus it falleth often out with our Loanists writings, but Sat cito si sat bene, It is soone ynough if it be well inough, (say I) when all is done.
The reas why this answere came forth no soner, are these.
First, kept it priuate to my self, abyding if either the Bishop, against whome it was made, or any other woulde aunswere to it.
Secondly, heard at the length, that Maister Nowell the Deane of Poules trauayled in it, whose learning and wisedome being suche as all the aduersaries could neuer withstand: surceased to proceede any further.
Thirdly, when perceiued he set not out his answere neither, thought it best to lay myne asyde also.
Thinking that either he was stayed vpo~ som weightier consideration, than did know: or else that he did thinke the boke not worth the answering at al (as in very deed, to the lerned marker it is not) M. Nowel had answered Dorman in muche like matter before, which were ye occasio~s why it slept so lo~g.
But since that time, as many haue mused and talked much on the matter, so they haue not a little marueiled why nothing was said vnto it.
The argument was great and waightie, not so muche whether nowe the Supremacie belonged to the Pope, as whether it pertained to the ciuil Magistrate, and whether the Queenes Maiestie did claime and hold it by right or no, The parties in controuersie were of note, as wel master Feckenham among the Papistes, as the Bishop of Winchester, whose estimation among vs, is not more for his authoritie, than his name amo~g other nations for his learning.
Nowe when Master Stapleton stept in lyke a lustie yoncker, and blewe vp this Counterblast betwene these twain, so hotly hallowing for answer out of hande to be made by the Bishop therto, al this while had none: some did interprete it, that he was a very vnfit matche for so graue a Bishop, as (to say ye truth) the match was nothing euen.
And therefore wite not the Bishop, if he vouchsafed not to answer him, especially seing home his booke was so pestred with scoldes and scorners Rhetorike.
Neither will the horse of noble corage strike at euery brauling curre that barks at his heeles.
But when others misseco~strued this to the worst, said the Counterblast was so notably blown, that the Bishop durst not, nor was able, he nor any other to answer it: whe~ vpon the head of all this M. Saunders Latine volume co~mes forth, although chiefly on the Popes visible Monarchie, yet once again entring into this questio~ of the Princes Supremacie, with fresh matter (& as he bosteth) with such inuincible arguments against it, that all are but vnlearned, starke fooles, and cleane madde that do defend it: and not thus content, so depresseth the Princes estate, that he will now proue the Pope hath interest to depose al Christian Princes, and release their sbiects of their sworn obedience: which valiant champion vau~teth also, of his felow Stapletons noble peece of woorke, againste the Princes Supreme Gouernment, saying in his prayse: Quod argumentum· Thomas Stapletonus omnium copiosissimè tractait in Libro quen eloquentia doctrina refertum, contra Hornum Psudoepiscopum Wintoniens edidi, vvhiche argument Thomas Stapleton hathe moste copiously handeled in that booke, vvhiche beeing replenished vvith all eloquence and learning, he set foorth against Horne the false Bishop of VVinchester.
So stornfully this rayling Papiste speaketh of the Bishop, and so he braggeth of his fellowes lerning and eloquence.
All whiche considered, thought it necessarie and more than high tyme, to answer these proude Phariseis, least the goodnesse of the cause should become distrusted, the truth suspected, the Prince slaundered, the Bishop defaced, the enimie encouraged, the godlie offended, the simple abused, and the whole estate euill spoken of, by too muche vnfrutefull silence, and ouerlong suffrance of such false and glorious pratlers.
And although for these causes was the willinger to sette it foorth, yet was the more emboldned on the request of diuerse, that hearing had trauailed in it, by their godlie persuasions vrged me the more thereto.
The chiefe of the Argument consisteth on the Supreme gouernement of Christian Princes in causes Ecclesiasticall.
The occasion sprang of a controuersie betweene the Bishop of Winchester, and master Feckenha~, about the Oth of the Supremacie.
All which is extant abroade in a learned and pithie booke of the Bishops, answering to maister Feckenhams scruples.
The issue they draue the matter vnto, was this, that maister Feckenham must be resolued for the Princes Supreme Gouernement in Ecclesiasticall causes, by any of these foure meanes, the Scripture, the Doctours, the Councels, or the Practise.
The Bishop accepteth the offer, and maketh proofe of the Princes Supreme gouernment in Ecclesiasticall causes, not onely by any one, but by euery one of all these forsayd poyntes, as the Bishops booke is euident to testifie.
Maister Feckenham that had made his promise to take the Oth vponany of these proues, and seing them all (beyond his cunning and expectation) proued, but neither mynding to keepe touche, nor able to answere: suborneth a chapman from beyond the seas, to wit, this Louanist maister Stapleton, (if he may be called Maister, for order of schole degree, that is suche a renegate from God, and runnagate from his Prince) who to saue maister Feckenhams honestie, if he woulde aduenture to relieue his cause: master Feckenham should to saue his credite, vouchesafe to relieue his neede.
Master Stapleton hauing better furniture of sale eloquence, than store of grounded learning, and yet more learning than grace well to imploy it, in acknowledging the manyfest truth, taketh vpon him to aunswere the Bishop, and deuides all the matter into foure Bookes, whereof this is the fyrst, that here is answered.
This doone, he conceiueth suche apride of this his exquisite piece of worke, that we must needes haue some fyne new name for this fyne newe booke, (singular heads ye know, must haue singular inuentions) and bicause the Bishops name is M. Horne, he entitleth his worke forsooth a Counterblast.
And yet somwhat truer than he himselfe wist, beeing in deed a blast, scarce worth a Counter, if the reader well examine it.
And that ye maye the better perceiue, this volume deserues so rare a name, for these two rare gifts, eloquence and learning, for which maister Sanders so highly extolleth him Mulus mulum scabit: And sith these two champions beare now the bell for eloquence among the Papists, the one for English, the other for Latine: haue sorted maister Stapletons eloquence by it self, consisting on certain Co~mon places folowing, that we may the easier iudge of the substance of his learning, whiche otherwise we should not so well discerne, it is so poudred with his eloquence.
His eloquence (I confesse) haue sayde but little vnto, nor can say muche, nor would say ought vnto it, as one that neuer was trained vp in the scholes and arte therof.
As for maister Stapleton goeth beyond maister Saunders, and withoute all comparison is an perse Doctor in it, and therfore set it asyde, the better to viewe the learning, to the whiche had more especiall regarde, for when all is done, the Eloquence settes it out, but the Learning proues the matter.
And though it be not replyed vpon with suche learning as many other better coulde, that rather shoulde haue doone it, yet haue endeuored truly, simply and playnely to answere it, and (I hope) to the co~tentation of the modest Reader, that rather respecteth the bouling out of the truthe, the staye of his conscience, and the glorie of God, than either the estimation of learning, or the shewe of eloquence.
Nowe although the Supremacie be the principall matter, yet the importunitie of maister Stapleton hath once or twice caried me perforce away with him, to purge our selues of certain auncient Herekes that he layeth to our charge, and crieth so faste vpon vs for answere, and sayeth we styll slinke from it, as though we hearde it not, and therefore haue here at large made aunswere to it, which makes the volume aryse the bigger.
In somuche that thought, for all maister Stapletons exclamations, to haue lefte it out, or put it in one of his Common places.
But that Maister Saunders commeth rufflyng in wyth the like argument, and therefore lette it stande as it did.
And truste haue cleerely disburdened vs, and iustly burdened them therewyth, tyll they shall be hable to discharge themselues therof.
Last of all, since Master Sanders hath compiled his great volume of the Popes Uisible Monarchie, in the seco~d book wherof he entreth into this argume~t of the Princes Supremacie: haue chosen out of the second booke.
chapters of the state of the Ciuil and Ecclesiastical power, in the Original, in the Use, and End of both: of the Interest and superioritie of either state: chiefly of that he would not only defeate the Prince of all gouernment in matters Ecclesiasticall, but also clean dispossesse hir Maiestie of hir Crowne.
For, maister Saunders, to mayntein the trecherous fact of Pus the fift, the last Pope, (if Cardinal Bon Compagnion, Pope Good fellowe, as the talke wente, be not deade) woulde proue, that Bishops may depose their Princes, and assoyle their subiectes from their allegeance.
Whiche poyntes as they draw nerest to the present argument, and in deed are for learning (suche learning as it is) the principall pointes of all his volume, thought good to ioy them vnto Stapleton, and so in one answer, answere both, though both be answered seuerally, as they drawe neere or farre, in resemblance or varietie of Argument, example, or similitude aboute this matter.
Wherein what is doone, committe vnto thee (good Christian Reader) to iudge as God shall moue thy heart, and besecche thou him, to moue it to the best, That the truth may appeare, that the falshode may be detected, that thou mayst be edified, that the Prince may be obeyed, that the Gospel maye be prospered, and that God aboue al things may be glorified nowe and for euer.
Master Stapletons common places THat all master Stapletons whole volume (as well therein himselfe termeth it, a Counterblast is indéede but a verie blast, blowne out to encounter the graue and pithie of the right reuerende father in Christ Robert Bishop of Winchester, to he Libell of M. Feckenhams scruples, for refusall of the othe of the Quéenes Maiesties Supremacy: withall to blow out, (thereby to darken the clearenesse of the truth) these light clowdes without moysture whereof Saint Iude prophecied: haue good Reader, or euer enter into the laying of the Counterblast, gathered togither by themselues (as it were in a table of common places) all those blastes wherewith his Counterblast is puffed vp, and haue sorted them in seuerall windes and blastes, whereby thou mayste knowe, as it were by a chart, into what coast he is alwayes caried, and by what gale of winde he sayleth: so shalt thou the better finde, in what créeke he setteth footing, whether on fast or on foggie grounde.
Which yt it may the better appeare, beholde the most or principall of those windes, wherwith M. St in this his first booke, and so encreasing more and more in the residue (as we shall likewise sée when we come therto) bluring like an other Aeolus, bloweth forth his Counterblast.
To the whiche is added his beaderoll of vntruthes, with a plaine and briefe aunswere to euerie one of them.
The most of these his common places being such as here thou féest, thinke, good reader, thou wilt looke for no great aunswere vnto them: it is aunswere good inough to make them stande forth, and shewe themselues like proper fellowes mustring in their rankes and troupes: howbeit if any perticular things shall be thought worthie the aunswering: either in these common places they shall be satisfied, or else more at large in the aunswere to the Counterblast it selfe, nothing God willing, whereby master Stapleton, or any of his friendes, may iustly finde themselues grieued, shall be omitted.
The residue of these common places, that are eyther vnworthie any aunswere, or so much as the naming, except to shewe with what spirite our student is moued: shall be aunswered in the fronts and endes of these common places, euen with his owne wordes in vpbrayding the same to the Bishop.
VVhy seest thou a moe in thy brothers eie, but considerest not the beame that is in thine one eie? Either how canst thou say to thy brother: Brother let me pull out the moe that is in thine eie, when thou seest not the beame that is in thine owne eie· Thou hypocrite, cast out the beame out of thine owne eie first, and the shalt thou see perfitly, to pull out the moa that is in thy brothers eie.

The dealing of the Catholike writers is so vpright, that suche small occasions must be piked. &c. else against their dealings haue ye nothing to say.

After all this strugling and wrastling agaynst the truth by you and your fellowes master Iewell, and the rest, the truth is dayly more and more opened, illustred and confirmed, and your contrarie doctrine is or ought to bee disgraced and brought in vtter discredite.
VVas fully purposed, hauing so largely prouoked suche sharpe aduersaries, especially master Iewel, for a season to rest me and to stande at mine owne defence if any woulde charge me.

Thy religion is but a bare name of religion, and no religion in deede.

But this may boldly say, and doubt nothing to proue it, that in all his booke, there is not as much as one worde of Scripture, one Doctor, one Councell, general or prouincial, not the practise of any one countrey throughout the world counted Catholike, that maketh for such kinde of regime~t as master Horne auoucheth, nor any one maner of proufe that hath any weight or pith in the world to perswade, will not say master Feckenham, but any other of much lesse wit, learning and experience.
say master Horne commeth not once nighe the principall matter in question.
say further, in case we remoue and sequester all other proufes on our side, that M. Horne shall by the verie same fathers, Councels, and other authorities by himselfe producted, so be ouerthrowne in the chief and capitall question, vnto the which he co~meth not nigh as a ma~ might say by.

The premisses then being true, and of our side abundantly proued, and better to be proued, as occasion shall serue, as nothing can effectually be brought against them.
Ye haue not, no nor ye can not proue any such matters.
Must be so bolde, by your leaue, as plainlie and bluntlie to go to worke with you, as haue done before with master Grindall and master Iewell.
The Queene cannot make you Lord Bishop of VVinchester, as haue otherwhere sufficiently proued, in the Fortresse of of our first faith annexed to venerable Bede.
Luther, and Caluine, and other being therewith pressed, were so messhed and bewrapped therein, that they could not in this world wite, what to say thereto, answering this that, they wist nere what, nor at what point to holde them.
The Protestants wonderfully troubled about the question of the continuall succession of Bishops.
b. Master Horne can not defende and maintaine his herisies nor himselfe to be a Bishop by anie law of the realme.
The Catholikes not suffered to replie, least their aduersaries weakenesse should (as it would haue done in deede, and now daylie doth God bee praysed) euidently and openly haue beene disciphered and disclosed.

b. Notwithstanding all your great bragges, and this your clerkly booke, ye knowe not, nor neuer shall know, but that the Pope is the supreme head of the Church.
After all this your long trauaile, wherein ye haue to the most vttred all your skill, ye are so farre from full aunswering his scruples and stayes, that they seeme plainly to be vnaunswerable, and your selfe quite ouerborne and ouerthrowne, and that by your owne arguments and inductions, as we shall hereafter euidently declare.
referre mee to your scriptures, fathers, Councels, practise of the Church, that ye would seeme to rest vpon.
VVhereby neuerthelesse, you your selfe shall take a shamefull foyle and fall.
VVherefore go on a Gods name, and bring forth your euidences, go on, say, in Gods name (master Horne) and prosecute your plea stoutly.
a. b. Nowe therefore go on master Horne, and being at your first encountring ouerblowne and discomfited with your owne blast, thinke well whether it is likely, that ye shall hereafter bring agaynst your aduersarie any thing &c.
VVee freely graunt you that Princes may sharply punishe teachers of false and superstitious religion.
&c. for say to you, that you and your fellowes teache false and superstitious religion.
trowe it will be harde for you to bring forth any act of parliament, or any other conuenient and sufficient plea.
The olde ordinarie Latine glose, am right sure M. Horne, it hath no such thing.
His scripture, &c. reacheth nothing home to his pretensed purpose, but rather infringeth and plaine marreth the same, as haue sayde, and fully standeth on our side.
So doubt nothing it will fare with his examples, as Moses, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Iosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias.
And that they all come to short, and are to weake to iustifie his assertion.
But here am shrewdly encombred, and in great doubt what to doe, for could make a short, but a true aunswere that these ensamples are fully aunswered alreadie.
This one aunswere might well serue for all the kings doings now following, sauing wil particularly descende to euery one, and for euery one say somewhat.
Master Nowell fretteth fumeth with master Dorman, who shall coole him well ynough doubt not.
Ye haue hitherto brought nothing effectuall. &c. the contrary is by vs auouched sufficiently proued. &c. bring forth that king that did not agnize one supreme hed. &c. ye haue not done it, nor neuer shall doe it, and if ye coulde shewe any, it were not woorth the shewing. &c. what president haue ye shewed of any good king?
That the Popishe religion, is the vsuall religion a thousand yeares and vpwarde.

VVhat euidence haue ye brought forth? &c. what can ye bring forth out of the olde testament to ayde and relieue your doings? &c. what can ye shewe? &c. what good induction can ye bring? &c. what good motiue can ye gather? &c. what? thinke ye that ye can perswade vs? &c. are ye able suppose ye, to name vs any one king? &c. M. Horn, your manifolde vntruthes are disciphered and vnbuckled, ye are espied, ye are espied, say, well inough, that ye come not by a thousande yeardes and more neare the marke.
Your bowe is to weake, your armes to feeble, to shoote with any your commendation at the marke, yea if ye were as good an archer as were that famous Robin hoode, or little Iohn.
VVell shift your bowe, or at least wise your string.
Let the olde testament go, and proceede to your other proufes.
VVherein we wil now see if ye can shoote any streighter, for hitherto ye haue shotte al awrie, and as a man may say, like a blinde man, see nowe to your selfe from henceforth that ye open your eyes, and that ye haue a good eie, and a good aime to the marke we haue set before you.
If not, be ye assured, we will make no curtesie eft soones to put ye in remembrance.
For hitherto ye haue nothing prooued that Princes ought which ye promised to proue. &c.
Answere the fortresse (Master Horne) annexed to Saint Bede if ye dare.
Master Feckenhams heresie is so secrete and priuie, that Argus himselfe with all his eies shall neuer espie it, no nor M. Horne himselfe, let him prie neuer so narrowly.
b. Ye haue heard of (your auncestours) before perhaps, and that by me.
forbeare at this time of the residue of your noble progenitors, hauing in other places, as noted before, spoken largely of the same.
b. Come forth once and cleare your selfe of this only obiection if ye can being so often pressed therewith.
Cleare your selfe if ye bee able, assure you M. Horne you and all your fellowes will neuer be able to auoide this one onely obiection.
As haue proued you your companions open and notable heretiks, so shal streight way purge M. Feck. to be no Donatist, or any heretike otherwise for any thing yet by you laid to his charge.
M. Horne beware your self, &c. beware say, for suppose will lay more pregnant matter, in this behalfe, to your their charge, tha~ ye haue or possible can do to M. Feck. or any other Catholike.
If should amplifie this matter at large, it would rise to a prettie volume.
Aunswere then to my third demaund in the fortresse annexed to Saint Bede.
Here might we euen by your owne rule, crie out vpon you al, as Apollinarians and Eutichians.
And for my part (master Horne) that you may not thinke haue now beene first so aduised vpon sight of your booke: haue forced that argument, with many examples of godly Emperours and Princes, in my Dedicatorie Epistle to the Queenes Maiestie, before the translated Historie of the venerable Bede.
b. VVe say that you are wicked deprauers of religion.
b. VVe say ye are as great blasphemers as euer Christes Church had, &c. we say further, that not only the general councel of Trent, but the whole church hath conde~ned your opinions by general national cou~cels many hu~dred yeres since.

VVell will bring ye as thinke a substantiall and an ineuitable proofe.
b. Though graunt you all that ye haue alleaged, &c. and all thinges else that is here alleaged, yet all will not reache home.
VVhich aunswere of his may satisfie any reasonable man, for all that ye bring in here of Constantine, or all that ye shall afterwarde bring in, &c.
b. Giue to Caesar that belongeth to Caesar, and to God that belo~geth to God· which later clause· am assured, doth much more take away a supreme regiment in all causes ecclesiasticall, than necessalily by force of any wordes, binde vs to pay yea any tribute to our Prince.
b. VVe plainly say that this kinde of supremacie is directly against Gods holy worde.
VVhat can ye conclude of all that ye haue or shall say to win your purpose.
say that if Saint Augustine were aliue, he woulde say vnto you as he saide vnto Gaudentius.
b. Neither this that ye here alleage out of place, nor all the residue which ye reherse of this Constantine, &c. can import this superioritie, as we shall there more at large specific.
In the meane season say it is a stark most impude~t lie.
As haue at large in my returne against master Iewels fourth article declared.
b. VVhat honour haue ye got, what honour haue you saye wonne by this, or by the whole thing it selfe?
And shal we now (M. Horne) your antecede~t being so naught, the consequent ye will hereof inferre? nay pardie.
a, b. VVell will leaue this, at your leasure better to bee debated vpon, betwixt you and master Foxe.
Ye are a verie poore sielie clearke, farre from the knowledge of the late reuerende fathers Bishop VVhite, and Bishop Gardiner.
That may a little roll in your rayling Rhetorike, hearken good master Horne, walke not, and wander as ye doe here, &c.
go to worke with you truely, plainly, and particularly, shewe you by your owne Emperour, and by plaine wordes.
b. Hitherto ye haue not brought any one thing worth a good strawe, to the substantiall prouse of your purpose.
am right well assured, ye haue not proued, nor neuer shall be able to proue, in the auncient Church while ye liue.
walke not in confuse and generall wordes as you do.
To all these facings and crakes (though many of them be particularly aunswered as occasion requireth) these his owne wordes may suffise for aunswere.
All men knowe that your great vauntes are but wordes of course to saue your poore honestie.
Bicause he quarelleth so much with the Bishop, as for other things so for his Rhetorike, as also Doctour Harding and his fellowes vpbrayde likewise vnto Bishop Iewell his Rhetorike, and master Dorman to master Nowell: haue therefore set downe (as one of his chiefest common places) a briefe note or two by the way, to shewe wherein our master Stapletons flourishing Rhetorike doth most consist.
AS for your Rhetorike, ye woorke your matters so handsomly, and so perswasiuely, &c. what a newe Cicero or Demosthenes are you.
His chiefest floures of Rhetorike partly nothing but copia verboru, an heape of needlesse wordes: partly nothing but rolling on a letter.
With which Rhetorike thou shalt his whole booke so poudred, that it should be superfluous to trouble thée with any exacter collection of the~, being in effect nothing else but rs bahlatiua.

That thou mayest the better sée howe he obserueth this and kéepeth himselfe to his matter or no: first, beholde the issue and state of the question betwéene the Bishop and M. Fëckhenham, which is this.
VVhether any Prince haue taken on them any such supreme gouernment as dothe the Q. Maiestie in ecclesiasticall causes.
Which issue to be resolued in, Master Feckenham desireth the proufe by any of these foure wayes, eyther by the Scriptures, or by the Doctors, or by the Councels, or by the continuall practise in any one part of Christendome.
To the which issue by all these foure said wayes, the Bishop directeth all his prooues, and in this first booke he prooueth it by two of them, the Scriptures, and the Doctors.
Now whether Master Stapleton kéepe himself to this issue, or to the proufes thereof, or to the Bishops answere, without playing the wanton Spaniell, and the part of the Don: iudge, when thou hast read this his sixt common place.
And withall thou shalt sée, what good plentie of bye matters he had in store, when substantiall matter ayled him.
In his first Preface taking on him to gather abriefe summe, of such things as he thought specially he might deface the Bishop withall, throughout all his Preface he neuer setteth the issue in controuersie, but quarelleth about other things, with the Bishops rashnesse, follie, Grammer, Logike, Rhetorike, Arithmetike.
And where at the length he speaketh of king Henrie.

letting go the matter that he is in hande withall, he discourseth agaynst the Bishop of Sarum about Sabellicus titles.
to declare the whole pith of the question, and course of the Bishops and his owne ke: he digresseth into a common quarell about diuersitie of fects and heresies, which he ascribeth to the Protestants, he ceth into Greece, Affrica, Bohemia, Hungarie, Lifelande, pag. and so commeth home to Englande, digressing from the question and issue, to English bookes, to forbidding of the Bible to be read, to the iudgeme~t of Lambert, to burning, to religious houses, Pag. to vowes, to repealing lawes, to setting forth a newe religion, to mariage of Priestes, to consecrating· Bishops, to the reall presence, Pag.

Where he shoulde directly aunswere to that wherewith master Feckenham is by the Bishop charged, for refusing all the prooues of the olde Testament to play the part of a Donatist, Master Stapleton snatcheth herevpon occasion to runne out from his matter, and to gather togither first a great rabble partly of heresies, partly of no heresies, to charge vs withall, and then trauayleth to heape vp a number of poynts, labouring thereby to proue the Protestants, to be Donatists, medling by this occasion with euery matter, that he thought he might enlarge his booke withall, with sectes and diuisions, with bragging of multitudes, with viciousnesse of life, of tying the Church to this or that place, of corrupting the fathers, of visions and myracles, of vaunting of Councels, of a generall Apostacie, of beginning and continuance, of doctrine and Bishops, of complayning of good Princes, and praysing of ill, of defacing the Sacraments and incredible crueltie, of the Emperours lawes, and the holye Gospels, of murthering others and themselues, of false martyrs, all which (sauing his long discourse of thrée or foure pages agaynst master Foxes booke, which remitte to him to be answered) is aunswered for his importunitie sake, though much of it be more fullie aunswered by others, and also quite extrauagant from the matter in hande.
He chalengeth vs to be blasphemers, he is in hande with contempt of the number of the sacraments, with prouinciall and generall Councels, with another fling at M. Foxes booke of Martyrs, about the articles of Sir Thomas Hitton priest, Sir Iohn Oldcastle Knight, the Lorde of Cobham, for putting of heretikes to death, for compelling to receyue the fayth for manslaughter.
a. b. Once againe he is in hande with his olde quarell of Images, Idols, and the Crosse.
Where he should aunswere to the Bishops allegations out of Nicephorus, he letteth them all alone, and medleth with other matters nothing to the purpose, as with Michael Paleologus Emperour of Greece, with thalenging the Grecians for heresies, with the heresie of the holy ghost to proceede onely from the father, and not from the sonne, with the Councell at Lions, with the accordment betwene the Grecians and the Latine Church, with their reuolt from the same, with the spite of the Greeke Bishops.
From thence he runneth to other matters, rayling on the Authour of the Homelie agaynst Idolatrie, for calling Michael· Theodorus, about his depriuing and funerals, that the question of Images was not mooued at the Councell of Lions, of the setting vp and continuance of Images in the Greeke Church.
From hence he runneth to quarelling about the names of Valence and Valentinian, and of his and Theodosius his lawe agaynst the picture of the Crosse.
Against Bishop Iewel for citing it out of Crinitus simplie, as the same Crinitus doth.
Hereon he entreth into a generall inuectiue, agaynst the reading of the Homelies nowe et forth, and falleth in praysing of the Homelies in the Popish Church.
In steade of aunswering to the Bishops argument out of Saint Paule, and Chrysostomes allegation thereon, he is in hande againe with master Foxe, for setting forth the doyngs of Doctour VVesalian, with the Bishop to be but a poore Clearke, with the aduauncing of Bishop VVhite, and Bishop Gardiner, with chalenging the Bishop to be of the Grecians opinion agaynst the proceeding of the holye Ghost from the father and the sonne, with the decaye of the Empyre of Greece, with a comparison betwéene the decay of Hierusalem besieged at Easter by the Romaynes, and the Captiuitie of Constantinople besieged at VVhitsontide by the Turkes, with the poynting of Gods ynger, wyth the Realmes of Fraunce, Scotlande, Germanie, with the vaunting of his owne plaine and true going to woorke, with Michaell and Andronicus once againe, and none of all these things eyther aunswering the Bishop, or perteyning to the question.
Last of al, where he taketh on him to set downe the state of the question, he setteth vp many newe questions, neyther in hand betwéene the Bishop and master Feckenham, nor any whit defended by vs, but méere slaunders of the Papistes, of the Princes preaching the woorde of God, ministring the Sacraments, binding and losing, &c.
Thus handsomely hath he kept himselfe close to the matter, and yet euer he crieth, haue an eye to the marke, and willeth vs still to call for the question, and yet himselfe hath thus digressed from it, for otherwise ye must vnderstande, his bigge Counterblast had béene but a verie shorte and little puffe of wind.
But to all this impertinent stuffe (though the most of it for his importunitie be aunswered at large) answere it with his owne wordes. fol.
Much labour vainely and ydly employed with tedious and infinit talke and babling al from the purpose out of the matter which ought specially to haue bene iustified.
His seuenth common place, of false translations· THe reason why place this among his other common places, is that (although he cite fewe allegations in this first booke for the Popes supremacie, and therefore coulde not be much noted here of this fault) yet in his other bookes following, he is full of false translations, or at the leastwise so captions translations, that he might séeme any wayes to further his purpose thereby.
MAster Horne doth not faythfully but most corruptly and falsly alleage the authours wordes, and vseth his owne in steade of theirs, and to such as he truely rehearseth, he giueth an vnmeete and vnprofitable sense of his owne making.
Interpreting a sentence out of the storie of Magdeburge, wrested as spoken agaynst vs, defending the supreme gouernment of the Quéenes Maiestie, where it was spoken of a Popishe supremacie: he translateth Non sint capita Ecclesiae.
They may not be heads of the Church in no cafe.
Which wordes, in no case, as though it denied all kinde of supremacie, is his owne addition, and not his Authours wordes. fol.
To pretende a iolie antiquitie and authoritie for the Popish errour of penance, and that it is a Sacrament, alleaging S. Ag. whose words are these, Nunquid enim perfecte de Trinitate tractatu~ est ante{que} oblatrarent Ariant? nu~quid perfecte de penite~tia tracta est ante{que} obsistere~t Nouatiani? sic non, &c. VVas the matter of the Trinitie throughly discussed before that the Arrians barked agaynst it? Concerning repentance, was it euer throughly handled before the Nouatians withstoode it? &c. which master Stapleton translateth the Sacrament of penance was neuer throughly handled.
Where Saint Augustine nameth not penance but repetance, neyther speaketh he of any Sacrament at all, but onely sayth de poenitena, of repentance.
Where the Bishop alleaged King Dauids actes to inferre a supreme gouernment: Master Stapleton aunswering by this sentence.
Ut ingrediantur domum dei iuxta ritum suum sub manu Aaron patris eorum, That they should enter into the house of God according to their rite or maner vnder the hande of Aaron their father: to make the matter sme to serue his turne the better, he Englisheth these later wordes, Sub manu patris Aaron, Vnder the spirituall gouernment of their spirituall father and his successors the hie Priests, which wordes his text hath not.
Translating the wordes that he hath picked out of an Epistle of Theodosius: that which is there spoken of a particular controuersie of the ayth, and the Priests then, about the Bishop of Constantinoples deposition and appeale: he translateth, locum ac faultatem habeat de fide ac sacerdotibu iudicare.
That he may haue place and libertie to giue iudgement in such matters as concerne faith and priests.
As though it were spoken simplie of all such matters, where his allegation hath neyther these generall wordes suche matters as concerne, nor any such generall meaning, onely the Emperour Ualentinian writeth to Theodosius being also Emperour, that the Bishop of Rome may haue place and licence to iudge of the fayth and the Priestes, meaning of that controuersie of the fayth, that was then sproong vp, and the quarell about Flauianus, for so the ende of the sentence, in expresse wordes expoundeth it selfe.
Which wordes master Stap. leaueth out, least his false and captious translation should be espied.
THese fellowes iarre alwayes among themselues, and in all their doctrines fall into such poynts of discorde, that in place of vniforme tuning, they ruffle vs vp a blacke sanctus.
His eight common place of contradictions to him self, and his fellovves.
THis controuersie, sayth he, of the supremacie, is the only matter the Papists stand in, which if it were so, then they admitte all other thing and stand not in them, but straight he contraryth his owne tale, saying: other matters in controuersie are not so oppressed, Ergo, they be pressed, and the Papistes stande in them·
The Princes inuesturing of Bishops, is but an impertinent matter.
And yet anon he sayth, The inuestiture of Bishops is a matter quite destroying the Princes supremacie.
He often complayneth that the title of King Henrie the eight, and King Edwarde the ixt, was so simple and large, that it was faine to be mollified with the Queenes title.
the Queenes title hath more added than theirs, and that of greatest importance.
He sayth, Princes may meddle and deale with ecclesiasticall causes, which neither master Feckenham nor any Catholike will greatly contende with him in.
Where not onely the contrarie is most apparant, but also Cardinall Hosi will not suffer Princes so muche as Mouere sermone~, To moue any talke of ecclesiastical matters.
He sayth the matters debated in the disputation at Westminster were but three, the seruice in English, the alteration of ceremonies, and the Sacrifice propiciatorie.
But in the next page, where he sayth, there woulde haue beene more deliberation: he addeth a fourth, the controuersie of the supremacie.
He sayth those matters that were debated were nothing touching fayth, and yet in the page before, he onely sayd the first and the seconde be no matters of fayth.
He sayth also they were no principall matters, but dependant and accessorie.
And yet in the first he sayth of the supremacie, that it is of such and so great importance as no matter more nowe in controuersie, and for the other poyntes who séeth not what principall matters otherwhiles they will make these séeme to be, especially the sacrifice of the Masse, for the whiche they burned so fast in the late raigne of Quéene Marie, when this was one of their first and chiefest questions.
Againe that the Papistes be most obedient subiects to the Queenes Maiestie, he craketh almost in euery place.
And yet about this disputation he confesseth, that eue~ in a trifling matter, they disobeyed the Queenes commaundement.
a. b. Christian Princes ciuill gouernment reacheth and tendeth to this ende, to preserue their subiects from outwarde and inwarde iniuries, oppressions and enemies, to prouide for their safetie quietnesse, for their welth, abundance, and prosperous maintenance, and no further.
What is here more than in a Sarasin Prince? But anon he sayth.
Christian Princes most of all, are muche more bounde to employ themselues to their possibilitie, towarde the tuition and defence, furtherance and amplification of the spirituall Kingdome. fol.
The seruice of the Prince is common as wel to the heathen as Christian gouernment.
b. Christian Princes are faythfull aduocates in ayding and assisting the spirituall power.
He flatly confesseth that M. Feck. helped to spoyle Queene Marie of a principall part of hir royall power, right and dignitie (in spoyling hir of this supremacie) thought sayth he, he so did, but not as an vnfaythfull subiect.
But so to spoyle hi· and not therein to be an vnfaythfull subiect, are flatte contradictorie.
Againe he sayth, he did it as a repentant Catholike, but to spoyle any bodie of their right, and to do it repentantly, are also flat contradictorie. ibid.
Againe he sayth afterward, it was no part at all of hi royall power, but to confesse first that he spoyled hir of a principall part of hir royall power, and after to say it was no part of hir royall power, are likewise contradictorie.
As also to say he spoyled hir, and yet it was no part belonging to that, of which he spoyled What are all these but an heape of wordes, contradictions? And all this he vttereth within lesse than fortie wordes togither.
The~ Bishop that the Prince shall haue by him the lawe of God, ly that the syth not so· yet within fire lynes before, he confesseth that he yeth so, and of infidelitie, for leauing out woordes, that wente immediately before the Texte that the Bishop alleaged.
And so while hee stryueth to chalenge the Bishop, he cleareth the Bishop, and ouerth himselfe.
On the one side of the leafe, he graunteth freely, that by the.
of Deuterenomie, Princes may punishe teachers of false and superstitious religion and Idolatrie.
On ther of the leafe, he eateth his free graunt and sayth that in all chapter, or in all that booke· there is no ounde. cares not what.
Where the Bishop allengeth the of osue, M. St. the ensample, bicause sayth he, Iosue did sacrifice, other himselfe.
speaking of Iosue, he confesseth that he did them not him selfe, but by appoynting them to bee done by the priestes ministerie.
He chalengeth the Bishop for not prouing his matters by any testimonies of the newe Testament, after he hath handled the olde.
And by and by he confesseth that he alleageth two testimonies of the newe Testament to proue his matters by.
He confesseth that master Feckenham refused of sett purpose like wise man, the testimonies of the olde Testament.
And yet all his long treatise of eight leanes togither in the·
Chapter, is chiefly to this purpose, to proue that he refuseth them not.
He confesseth that he omitted them, bicause they made agaynst him, and yet he sayth, he includeth them, and affirmeth them as all making with him. ibid.
He graunteth by Saint Augustines wordes, that Princes may make lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes Religion.
And in the next side, he denieth Saint Augustines wordes to enforce any thing else, but lawes to punishe Heretikes, which is no Ecclesiasticall matter at all.
He sayth, we denie that Princes may punish Heretikes by death.
And he sayth we hold with Caluin, that sayth Princes may· pot· Heretikes vnto death.
When the Bishop presseth him with the ensamples of Moses, Dauid, denieth as doth master Dorman that the ensamples of the old are figures of the new Testament, and yet in the·
Chapter he graunteth, that all the examples that the of the olde Testament herein, be figures of the newe. fol.
He confesseth there is some regiment that Princes may take vpon them in causes ecclesiasticall.
And in the next side he the Princes regiment to but an ouer in ciuill matters.
But forthwith againe contrarie to this, he graunteth the Prince may haue the procurations and executions of Church matters.
And thus in Docke, out Nettie, he so graunteth and denieth that there is no holde of his worde.
He graunteth Christ destroyed not the rule of Princes in Church causes figured in the olde lawe, and that Christs sentence, giue to Caesar that that is Caesars, confirmeth the figure of Princes rule in Church causes in the olde lawe.
And yet streightway he sayth, it maketh nothing for it
He sayth this sentence, giue vnto Cesar that belongeth vnto Cesar, destroyeth not the figure: where the subiects in the olde lawe were bounde to giue all duties to their Princes that belonged vnto them.
And yet anon after by this sentence sayth he, men be not bounde to pay any thing, yea not so much as tribute to their Princes.
And so this sentence confirmeth not, but loeth and destroyeth the figure, by the which subiects were bounde before to their Princes.
And yet he sayd before it determined not that neither.
He sayde also before, that this sentence onely licensed, that we might pay tribute if we woulde, but we ought not.
And yet after he sayth, Christ willed that to be giuen to Caesar that is his, which is oth a determination and commaundement also.
He sayth the Bishops admonition hereon, is without anie cause or grounde.
And anon he sayth, it serueth him and his brethren for many and necessarie purposes.
He graunteth that Princes haue authoritie, both to further the obseruation, and to punishe the breach aswell in the first table as in the seconde, that is, aswell in such actions as concerne our dutie to God him selfe, as in the dutie of one man to another.
But in the next side he flatly denieth this againe, saying, these are the workes of the first table, the punishing, correcting or iudging of these, appertaine nothing to the authoritie of the Prince or to anye hys lawes.
He sayth we make the Princes supreme gouernours without any limitation.
And yet withall he alleageth Master Nowell to say, it is not without limitation, but that Godly ministers may iudge of the synceritie of doctrine according to Gods worde. fol.
As also he shewed in the diuision before howe the Bishop limitted the Princes gouernment, by the boundes of the worde of God.
Where the wordes are euident, for all those that bee put in authoritie.
And yet himselfe by and by sayth, hee speaketh of theyr gouernment.
And anon after, will ye knowe (sayth he) whie the Apostles both Saint Peter and Saint Paule so earnestly taught at that time obedience to Princes? But what obedience coulde they require in subiectes, if they comprehended not with all authoritie in Princes. fol.
am here in the beginning put to the knowledge by the varietie of your aunsweres, that they cannot be both true, but if the one be true, the other must be false.
By your contradictions, ye shewe the vnstablenesse of your owne Iudgement.
His ninth common place of petit quarels, at Grammer and other trifles, to prolong his booke thereby.
WHo seeth not nowe that all this was but a quarell picked without desert and you (master Stapletonn) to haue shewed yourselfe amost ridiculous wrangler.
But Gods name be blessed, the dealing of Catholike wryters is so vpright, that suche small occasions must bee piked, and vppon suche trifles your Rhetorike must bee bestowed, else agaynst their dealing ye haue nothing to say.
IN his first Preface, where he giueth a briefe antedate of all those things, that he is ust offended withall: he maketh this a verie heynous faulte that the Bishoppe called Conuent, It ought to bee, for It is meete or conuenient to bee·
As who saye if a thing bée meete and conuenient, it ought not to bee, or if it ought to be, it is not meete and conuenient to bee.
But if Oportet muste néedes alwayes signifie it ought to bee, then ought your Bishops (if they bée Bishops) to bée maryed.
For Saint Paule sayth not Conuenit, but Oportet Episcopu esse vni vxr is viru, Bishop ought to be the husbande of one wife.
In the same place he maketh a sorer matter aboute this worde recenendam, to reherse, which worde the Bishoppe went not aboute to interprete in that place, as the letter sheweth, but onelye to tell the sentence and intente of their doyng: and wherefore did the Councell present their doynges, to bée read or rehearsed before the Emperour, but that he might examine and confyrme the same? Besides that they them selues beséeche him to ratifie and confirme them, which he could not well doe, hauing not examined and perused them. ibid.
Likewise about irrogare priuilegia, that eyther by escape of the Printer (as many such escapes in any booke may hap) or by the ouersight of the writer of the Printers copie, was printed to take away, for he gaue, of which escape, Lord what a wonderfull triumphant outcrie he maketh also in his Counterblast, while the materiall purpose is all one agaynst him, whether the Prince made priuileges, or abrogated priuileges and tooke them from the Clergie.
For, if his taking away were lawfull, his authoritie remayned equall in both, except ye will say· Princes haue authoritie to make priuileges for the Clergie, giue or make for them what and how much they will, but they, that haue learned holdefast, the first point of hawking, will not suffer them by the same authoritie, to take any away agine, for that is against their profite.
But the lawe sayth contrary, the same authoritie that may make, the same authoritie may vnde and take away againe. ibidem.
But lesse maruaile is it that he quarelleth about the former wordes, that cauilleth about the Englishing of quaui causa, any cause, which must be, sayth he, euery cause, calling this interpreting, foule shiftes, neuerthelesse of much importance, to call quauis, any, yet himself euen in the next lease, not of quauis, qualibet, or quacun{que}, whereon he descanteth Grammarian like, but euen of nothing, can make (Any) a foule shift, and yet not of any other importance at all, than to shewe that any, or all these causes of his brablings, are in conclusion of no importance at all.
But admitting as he would haue it the Kings and the Councels decrée agaynst the carying of causes out of the Realme, to be pleaded at the Court of Rome, should signifie not any, but euey cause, then coulde not the penaltie of the breach thereof extend to any, that had tryed excéeding many causes at Rome, and dayly did for all this decrée, vnlesse it had ene proued he had there tried euerie cause, and so the decrée it selfe had bene of non importance at all, whereat so heynous a matter is made, and yet the worde in that place admitteth so well none other interpretation.
The like quarell he piketh aboute supremu gbernator, supreme gouernour, in the Queene Maiesties title to the othe administred at Oxenford, of the which othe he sayth, scholler might make an honest refusall, were it nothing but for false Latine.
Which rule of his if it holde: then many of their poishe ceremonies, their Latine seruice, their Masse, yea euen their consecration might honestly he refused, were it but for false Latine, when their ignoraunt Priestes did pronounce corpus &c. in nomina patria filia spirita sancta &c. for sumsimus. or such like wordes, about the which your best scholemen make somewhat more standing vpon the intentios, and not so much vpon the sillables, that euen for the false construction of sir Iohn lack Latine that patreth Latine like a Parat, they might honestly refuse the same: but to saue the honestie of theyr priests, and their ignoraunt escapes, they haue a contrarie glosse to your rule, quia error sillabae non nocet, the error of a sillable hurteth not, althoughe, they that vsed this phrase, knewe as well howe to set the Substantie and the Adiectiue togither, as master Stapleton dare say, and (were it so as he sayth) might take the phrase vsually receyued, not respecting the gender so much, as the selfe thing and power, As we vse in English to say without quarelling thereat, the Quéenes Royall or regall estate, though shee by hir see, be Queene, and by Grammer shoulde say reginall estate, likewise we call hir gouernour, defender, and your selfe call hir often Prince, not Princesse, all these and suche like wordes or phrases, setting aside the exacting of Grammer rules, in respect of hir kingly power, the lawyers say they may vse this licence of speach, to whome remitte you, and to other your Canonists, scholemen and Historiographers, that haue vsed the same or like, with no reproche or quarell piked thereat.
And if now the Quéenes Maiesties supremacie must néedes be renou~ced for this phrase, bicause by the censure of our new Aristarchus, it is not so Grammerlike, then must your Pope himselfe léese his vsurped supremacie, so oft (as it often falleth out) he is no Grammarian at all. ibidem.
Likewise he maketh a quarell about these wordes supreme head, in the title of King Henrie and King Edwarde, and the wordes of the title vsed nowe, supreme gouernour, where all men knowe that the sense is all one, but that this title more plainly expresseth ye matter to preuent such ianglers.
Yea but sayth he there is a certaine addition of greatest importance (which is) in all spirituall or ecclesiasticall things or causes as temporall.
What is this but an importune séeking of a knot in a rushe of no importance? there any thing in these wordes, added more, than was ully compre hended in the other, or than King Henrie, or King Ewarde claymed and tooke on them?
He maketh an other petit quarell at the fourme of the printed letter.
But it is aunswered in his bederoll of vntruthes, where he likewise maketh a slurre aboute it.
Diuerse other petit quarels he dath aboute the distinction of the letter, and for cyting the effect of certaine textes, and not declaring them worde for worde, fol.
Another quarell he pyketh at the Bishop, for citing Emanuell Paleologus· the Emperour of Greee.
Aother for that he calleth him Christian Emperour, these ar aunswered in theyr proper places.
Another or translating Suprema Anchora, Supreme Anchore, and not the last Anchore, but this is likewyse aunswered. like petit quarels he piketh many, which here for breuitie ouerpasse.
And although there is none vnaunswered in their places, yet aunswere them all with his owne wordes.
man woulde here suppose (master Stapleton) that ye had some great and iust occasion, thus grieuously to charge such a man (as the Bishop is) and that in print where all the worlde may read and consider it.
VVhat an offence beseech you hath (the Bishop) committed herein so great as wothie a dash with your pen. b.
To these he adioyneth his tenth common place, which himselfe calleth wordes of course, saying, these are but wordes of course.
His vvordes of course, that is, such as may be better returned on himselfe.
FIrst his beginning of his first Preface, with the parable of the foolishe buylder.
Whom he compareth the Bishop vnto, for attempting this controuersie, which he calleth the Castle of our profession, and not able to go through therewith, is therefore laughed to scorne, saying, beholde this man beganne to buylde but hee hath not beene able to make an ende.
That this may be truely recoursed on the Papists, all the worlde beginneth to sée and to laugh them to scorne, at the ouerthrowe that God hath made of their Nymrods Babilonicall Towre, and howe the more they labour to repayre the decay thereof, bycause they buylde not on Iesus Christ the Rocke, but on the sandes of theyr Fathers traditions, they can not therefore with all theyr force, inquisitions, deuises and attemptes, bring their buylding to any good passe, their groundworke rotten, their stuffe is naught, and therfore master Stapletons Fortresse, and all their Bulwarks are ouerthrowne, spirituoris ius, with the spirite of his mouth, that is, with the worde of God.
But ye will say (sayth he, of this parable) they be but words of course.
Well preuented, master Stapleton, and in time, who can rightly say or iudge any other of them, sith they be so indéede, as your selfe confesse, wordes both of ordinarie course with you and all your side, and what is sayde in the whole discourse of them, but such course stuffe God wote, as in recoursing them to you, may be more fitly and truely applyed.
For ensample, euen in the similitude ye alleage of the Apples and Grapes of Sodome and Gomorre.
fayre to the eye without, within nothing but stinking ashes.
most liuely picture of the fruites of Poperie, more glorious withoute in pompe, riches, wealth, and might of the worlde.
More shining in outwarde holinesse, counterfeyts myracles, Iewish ceremonies, and Pharisaical workes, and in all other things more faire and delectable to the outward senses, than euer were the Apples of Sodome, or any thing else: but within, for sounde doctrine, and the right worship of God, consisting in spirit truth, neyther the Apples of Sodome and Gomorre, nor Sodome and Gomorre it selfe, had euer the like stinch and infection.
And all those gay things come but to touche them, with the touche stone the holye worde of God, they smlder forthwith into Ashes, or rather into nothing.
Uevobis hypocritae (sayth Christ) VVo bee to you hypocrites, that make cleane that is outwarde. &c.
The like recourse is made of all your glorious pamphlets, and of this yours in hande, there néede none other aunswere than to returne your owne words to your owne selfe thereon.
It beareth a countenance of truth, of reason, of learning, but come to the triall and examination of it, finde a pestilent ranke of most shamefull vntruthes, an vnsauery and vaine kinde of reasoning, and last of all, the whole to resolue into grosse ignorance.
After all this strugling and wrastling agaynst the truth by you and your fellowes, the truth is dayly more and more opened, illustred, and co~firmed, and your contrary doctrine is or ought to bee disgraced, and brought in vtter discredite.
The aunswere to this, is the same that made to the quarelling sophister, If say it, the argument is true, if thou sayst it, it is false.
That which ye forge of a namelesse Protestant, from one of your lying fellowes that protestant of late dayes being pressed of a Catholike for extreeme lying, and not being able to cleare himselfe, sayde plainely and bluntly, Quamdiu poter clades adferam, latebunt quamdiu poterant, valebunt apud vulg ista mendacia, will deface them, and do some mischiefe to them as long as am able, my lyes shall lie hidde as long as may be, and at the least the common people shall fall in a liking with them. pag.
this is most likely to be your owne and your authors lie on the Protestants, that at the least the common people might fall in a misliking with vs: so is it euidently true if it recoursed on your owne side, all the world can witnesse, it hath bene your sayings and doings in very déede: and noe for feare should haue bene preuented, obiect it in your Preface to vs.
It is you that with your crueltie, and slaunders haue and do say, Quamdin potero clades adferam, wil do mischiefe to them long as can.
It is you that this long while haue slaundered and deuised horrible lies· by those that haue professed the truth, altering and chopping their articles, saying, they mainteyne such and such he resies as they neuer thought, and haue sayde, Latebunt quamdi poterunt, valebunt apud vulg ista mendacia, These lies shall lie hidden with the vulgare people so long as may be.
And so haue yée made the people (in executing your crueltie) beléeue that they did God good seruice.
So did the Phariseys and highe priestes, abuse the and ignorance of the Iewishe people, with such vntrue slaunders on Iesu Christ himselfe.
And to the better compassing hereof, ye haue set forth lyes for truth, and kept the people ignorant, least they should discerne them.
And ye haue sayd of your hypocritiall errours, of your ayned myracles, and legends of lies, latebunt {quam} diu prerunt, vlebunt apud· mendaci, The ignorant people will ostéeme such lying to es.
And therfore we may well returne your conclusion on your selfe, that ye be those false Prophets and lying masters, such as Saint Peter spake of, bringing in wicked and damnable sects.
God giue them grace which are deceyued by you, so well to knowe you, as we that do examine your writings, haue good cause to know you.
And thus your wordes of course, fathered (as ye call it) in a luskie lane of some indiuiduum vagum, (a certaine Protestant of late dayes) and for witnesse hereof aske your fellow if it be not so: howe well in euery poynt they appeare (that as they say the foxe was the first finder) to be your owne tootoo open sayinges and doynges, to charge vs withall, a Gods name hardily, let all the worlde be iudge.
Of deepe silence to aunswere the pith of the matter.
Remoue them with a writte of returne to the Papists themselues, and then they are fully answered.
b. heresie worketh in the Church that it maketh the truth to be more certenly knowne and more firmely and stedfastly afterwarde kept, so sayth S. Augustine the matter of the Trinitie was neuer well discussed till the Arrians barked agaynst it. &c.
This is truer M. St. than eyther ye wene, or would.
The experience whereof is dayly to be séene in the Papists, defending their errors and impugning the truth, in their subtile practises, in their tyrannicall inquisitions, and cruel torments, yea euen in this yours and your fellowes volumes, striuing to obscure and deface the truth: but all these steps notwithstanding, the truth is and shal be more and more set forth, the Popish errors sse and lesse begutle vs, and the kingdome of Antichrist detected and forsaken.
Nazianzen saith, Verum est {quod} vnum est, mendaciu~ aute~ est multiplex.
The thing which is true is alwayes one like vnto it selfe, whereas the lie, the cloked and counterfeyt thing is in it selfe variable and diuerse.
By the which rule here giuen, of so learned and graue a father, am here put to knowledge, that the Papists not being content with the onely worde of God, alwayes one and like it selfe, but ioyning thereto mens variable and diuerse vnwritten verities: That the Papistes being not content with the true spirituall worship of one God, alwayes one like himselfe, not with one mediator Iesus Christ, but yéelding spirituall worship to Saints and Saints pictures besides God, and making other variable and diuerse mediators to God besides Christ: that the Papists being not content with the only merites satisfaction of Christs death always one and like itselfe· but deuising variable and diuerse Masses, Diriges, Pilgrimages and satisfactions besides: being not content with the flat scripture alwayes one and like it selfe, that testifieth only faith in christ, to be the meanes of apprehe~ding our iustification, but adding variable diuerse infinit work of their own, to deserue their iustification by: being not content with the only title profession of Christianitie, alwayes one like but stting vp variable diuerse feas, professio~s, religions, names besides: be but cloked counterleyy liers· as Greg Nazn. hath most truly said.
And thus ye sée M. St. how you citing falsly this sentence to proue the variable your selfe on· the thumbes.
Let the King (sayth master Stapleton) reode on Gods name, not onely that booke, but all the Bible beside, it is a worthie studie for him, but let him beware least this sweete honie be not turned into poyson to him, &c.
What wordes are here that we say not also? yea, his permission of Princes to read and studie the Bible· is our most earnest prayer and exhortation.
And they, whatsoeuer they would seeme nowe to pretende, bicause they can no longer keepe it vnder their bushell: it is full sore agaynst their heart that Princes should read or studie it.
Otherwise, why suffred they not Princes, to giue them selues to so woorthie and commendable a studie heretofore? And nowe that they can kéepe it in no longer, who it is that turneth this sweete honie of Gods worde into poyson, is easie to iudge.
Whether hée that giueth bread to the hungrie, bringing forth the whole loafe of the onely pure wheate, and willeth them that are to be fedde therewith, to sée, to view, to féel the whole, and in seasonable time breaketh it to his fellow seruants, before their faces, that they may fully refresh their hungrie seules: or he that beateth his fellowe seruaunts, hydeth the loafe from them, and if he must néedes giue them some, mingleth the pure wheate with his owne branne, and that worse is, with Darnell, and more of that by thrée halues than of the wheate, and will néedes haue the receyuer blindfolded, nor will suffer him to take it in his owne handes, but by gobbet meale thrust it into his mouth, nor will let the partie sée, what (in this sort) he crammes him with, as though he were worse than the Capon in a coupe, and yet for all this, will beare him in hande it is the true bread.
Whether of these twaine be the likelier to giue this poysoned bread: no man that hath any witte, but will giue a shrewde ayme.
As for false translations, false dangerous, and damnable gloses, wherewith (master St. sayth) we haue corrupted and watred the same, and made it as it were of pleasant wine most soure vinegar: it is so euident on his owne part, that the Papistes haue so vsed the Scripture, and that so shamefully, that it séemeth he is past shame, that he dare once mencion it, and yet he obiecteth it to vs, that admit the expresse scripture, without any gloses at all.
Take heede to your selfe Maister Horne, for say to you, that you and your fellowes teache false and superstitious religion, manie and detestable heresies, and so withall playne idolatrie.
Blot out these wordes Maister Horne, and put in Maister Stapleton, and then it is truely sayd: Although wée not only say it, but proue it also.
And therfore you and your felowes M. Stapleton had nede to take hede thereto.
&c. VVe say ye are as great enimies as euer the Church of Christ had. &c. VVe say ye be they that haue contemned Christs sacramentes: we saye further that not onely the generall Councell of Trent, but that the whole Church hath condemned your opinions.
fol. a He telleth vs, we would mayster and rule oure Princes, bicause we limit their rule to Gods worde, and that wée referre the interpretation of Gods woorde to oure selues that wee make therof a welshe mans hose.
Whiche woordes of course are answered in their places, and are so manifest the dooings of the Papists, and so farre from touching vs, that it is maruell with what face he could reherse suche things.
But such is the propretie of impudencie, to obiect that to other, wherein he is most culpable him selfe. fol.
VVe plainly say this kind of supremacie is directly against Gods worde, so he sayd before, and so let him say sil, so long as he doth but say so, and can neuer proue it.
These and suche like his sayings, good reader, as thou séest them but mere words of course, so thou shalt fynd them swarme thorow ut all his booke, and if any of them be not answered (for thou séest cut them off for breuitie sake) answere then them as thou thinkest good, easy answer God wote may serue them, and his owne wordes serue for all, returned on him selfe, nomine, de fubula narratur, change but the name, and the tale is tolde of thee.
In the meane season for these and all his other wordes of course, will say to him againe as he sayth to the Bishop, Neither vvill thanke you for bringing to our hands so good stuff to proue our principal purpose by, but say herein to you as S. Aug. sayd in the lyke case to the Donatists, alleaging the workes of Optatus, by whiche they were euen confounded, and the catholikes cause maruellously furthered, Nemmen ipsis· &c. Neyther doo wee yet thanke them for their so doing, but rather God, for that they shoulde bring foorth and vtter, eyther by talke or by alleaging, all those thinges for our matter, the truth forced them, not any charitie inuited them.
And so truly (M. Stapleton) that you haue alleaged all this and other lyke wordes of course, when they are compensed to you, you are euen so confounded by them, that it had ben better for your cause ye had not so muche vsed them, but that ye brought suche good stuffe to our handes, the truth of our cause forceth you, not any good will to our cause, or to vs, moued you.
Maister Stapletons ovvne vvords returned to him selfe for all these his Common places.
MOderate your penne better, reporte your authors more syncerely, translate your allegations more truely, laye downe the whole sentence without concealing of such matter as ouerthroweth your purpose, say no more than ye fynd in stories, slander not your betters, deale more aduisedly and vprightly, (séek not out so often bymatters starting holes, quarell not somuch about trifles of letters, syllables, escapes in printing, raile not so bitterly, scoffe not so Lucia~like, boast vaunt not with such defacings of persons, and outfacings of the matter, leaue your vain rhetorik of Copia verboru~, and rolling on a letter, vse not (as ye cal them) so many words of course, let your tale hang better together without so many contradictions) so shall your vntruthes be fewer an other tyme, but so wil your cause assure you (M. Sta) come starke naked feble and miserable, And al your great volume as bare ield as Esops pulde crow, as partly may appere by this pretie farel of some such yeur sentences and ordinarie phrases, in a part of the foresayd poyntes, and may further be considered what a full and sufficient booke they might make vp of them selues, if al the residue throughout all the foure bookes were gathered togither, and sorted in their troupes and orders of these your common places.
But these only shall suffise for this your first booke, for a viewe of the rest, to shew what good diuinitie of Louaine your volume is most arced withall, and what, as ye say, they shall looke for at your handes.
Master Stapletons Beadroll and collection of vntruthes, vvith a plain and brief ansvver to euery one of them, so many as are noted in his fyrste Booke.
YOur answere is so fraighted and stuffed with falshodes, your vntruthes do so swarme and muster all along youre booke, that for the quantitie of your treatise, you are comparable to Maister Iewell, youre vntruthes amounte to the number of sixe hundred fourescore and odde, they be so notorious and so many, that it pitieth me in your behalf Crocodili lachrym to remember them, but the places be euident, and crie corruption, and maye by no shifte be denied.
If my curiositie in noting them displease you, lette the vttering of them fyrst displease your selfe, then ye will the lesse be displeased with mee.
You knowe maister Iewell hath led vs this daunce, be not angrie, Maister Horne, if we followe the round.
If had not seene a further meaning in his setting foorthe and publishing the booke, than he durst playnly vtter.
Lo, euen at the first striking vp of the round, what a passing notorious vntruth is here, to bee the captain ringleader to all this bande: ye may well, M. Stapl. not pitie it, but pitie youre selfe, and be ashamed also, to haue so cried out of suche notorious vntruhes, and here to beginne your daunce with this, to haue vs look for the lyke to folow the rounde.
Howe vntrue this is, let eche man hardely coniecture, and your selfe shew, that M. Feckenham durst not say all that he ment, oftentimes in excusing him, and euen your next vntruth will somewhat declare this further.
But seing his chief end and principal purpose entended as may be iustly gathered in publishing the booke, was to engraffe in the mindes of the subiects, a mislikyng of the Queenes Maiestie, as thoughe she vsurped a power authoritie in ecclesiasticall matters wherto she hath no right.
You so chalenge this to be an other vntruthe, that denying it to be his chiefe ende, ye durste not saye, but couertly confesse, that an ende and purpose of him it was, thoughe not the chief end.
Wherin ye proue that, that ye chalenged before for an vntruth, to be a truth, that he ment more than he durst playnly vtter.
And yet howsoeuer ye woulde couer his and your meaning here, both he in his booke, and you in yours also, durst plainly vtter, that ye mislike hi Maiesties claime of this supreme authoritie, and playnly laye to hir charge vsurpation.
And sit this, his, and youre bookes are chiefly directed to dissuade hir subiects myndes (to whome in hucker mucker ye sende these bookes ouer) from the acknowledging of the sayde hi Maiesties supreme authoritie, maye it not truly be sayde, men maye iustly gather this as youre chiefe ende? Is not euery wriers chiefe ende, to persuade his reader in his principall matter? is not this here youre principall matter, to improue the taking vpon hir of this authoritie? If ye haue any chiefer ende, or more principall purpose, that is better than this: cléere your self and shew it.
Uerly our chiefest end in writing hereof, is to persuade hir subiectes, (that by your deceiuings stand in any mammering) to a godly liking of the sayd title, as most de and lawfull to hir highnesse estate.
And if yours be not the contrarie hereto? let your doings be according, and we shal like it the better.
But see here, M. Stapleton, how soone ye folter in your numbers, and misse in your tale at the fyrste beginning of all, ye haue scored vs vp in your marginall score, two vntruthes, when ye come to counting them twaine, afterward in your answere ye recken vs vp thrée, saying of the second in your score, This is an vntrue and false surmise of Maister Horne, as are the other two here also, reckning vp that, that ye counted for the first.
And thus wée knowe not whether we haue euen or odde,
Is this your daunce (M. Stap.) in beginning to trip the round, when one lye tumbles out so proprely in the necke of an other? But hoysta God blesse them, they fallout faire.
Howbeit, as they say, it is a good horse that neuer stumbled: thoughe it be an euill signe to stumble, yea to fall downe right at the first setting out.
make proofe by the continuall practise of the Church in like gouernment as the Queenes Maiestie taketh vpon hir.
The thirde vntruth you neuer proue the like gouernment namely in all Ecclesiasticall thinges and causes.
The truthe or vntruthe of this, being referred to the triall in the sayde practise, will soone pull backe this thirde dauncer from hopping in your rounde.
And as for your self ye are a false piper M. Stapleton, thus soone vnto your to pipe a wrong rounde, harping on an other issue, than was required of the B. to proue.
Wherin as your greate falshood hal appeare: so your selfe do here halfe graunt this to be no vntruth, daring not flatly say, the Bishop neuer pro ued the like gouernment, which the Bishop only here affirmeth, but you denie it in a respect, namely (say you) in al ecclesiasticall things and causes· which the Bishop here affirmeth not, nor it is his propre issue in question, demaunded of Master Feck. and yet he proueth euen that also.
The fourth vntruth, for he wrongfully alleageth both the wordes and meanings of his authours.
He bringeth no instance at al, wherby to proue this that he sayth, which til he can do, it must go for a lie of his owne making, wherby he measureth other mens translations by his owne, corrupting his authors wordes, sentences, mindes and all, as is alreadie declared.
The fyfth vntruth, in wrongfully charging Feckenham for the title of his treatise.
Whether Master Fecke~hams treatise had a true title or no, lette others déeme.
Maister Feckenham made a treatise, entituled by the name of An ansvvere to the Queenes Maiesties Commissioners, and the same by writing be deliuered to the Bishop of Winchester, and afterwarde sent abroade the sayd Treatise, entituled by name: The declaration of suche scruples. &c. as Maister Iohn Feckenham by vvryting did deliuer vnto the Lorde Bishop &c. when he neuer deliuered any suche entituled treaise vnto him.
Is this then vntruly or wrongfully don, to charge him of the title of his treatise? His sixth and seuenth vntruth trifling denials.
You. &c. not without the helpe of the reste, as may be gathered, deuised, wrote and purposed to deliuer this booke to the Commissioners.
Neither doth the Bishop flatly affirme it, but only sayth, as may be gathered, whervpon M. Stapl. can not iustly gather a flat asseueration one way or other· to conclude his vntruth.
Neither doth St. improue it any way, thoughe himselfe and that verie often, without any coniecturing of the matter (and yet can he gather no iust coniecture therof) doth boldly charge the Bishop with the helpe of other.
Which so often as he doth, he shoulde remember that this vntruth returneth on himselfe.
In al which points ye were so answered, that ye had nothing to obiecte, but seemed resolued, and in a manerfully satisfyed.
And in his cou~terblast he saith, had not the B. put in these wordes, In a maner, otherwise it had passed al goodmaner honestie too, so vntruly to make report, the contrary being so wel known, that he neuer yelded vnto you in any one poynt of religion, neither in Courte, nor yet in mannour, nor else where.
Ye are a mannerly man perceyue mayster Stapleton, and as full of good manners or honestie, it appeareth, as an egge is full of oatemeale.
Belike ye haue bene brought vp neyther at courte nor mannour, but at Hogges norton as they saye, for otherwise what good manner or honestie is this, to chalenge youre better of so heynous vntruth, and proue nothyng at all agaynste hym, but saye, the contrarie is well knowne, when your selfe knowe it not at al, but speake without the booke.
For shame (M. Stapl.) learne better maners, to referre it to them that were present at the hearing of both parties, and then shal ye hazard your honestie and truth a great deale the lesse, and shewe your nourture to be the more.
Wherevpon made afterwarde relation (of good meaning towardes you) to certayn honourable persones, of the good hope had conceyued. &c. The.
VVhat good meaning coulde he haue to him when he would haue him reuolt from the religion by him receiued and professed at Baptisme, to reuolt from the faith of Christes catholike churche. &c. Why Master Stapleton is this incredible, that the Bishop hoping of his conformitie in making relation thereof to the honourable, might not haue therin a good meaning? yea, admitte the truth whiche he professeth, were as false as you woulde haue it séeme to bée: mighte he not for all that haue a good meaning? Saule had a good meaning, ye wot, when he did full ill.
And how say ye to your Scholemen, that speake so muche good of a good meaning, yea euen in ill causes.
But as the Bishop meant wel to him, so the cause was good also, and your cause naught, how well so euer ye meane in an ill matter.
Ye meane well (I dare say for ye, good man) when ye talke of reuolting from the religion by him receyued at baptisme, and the faith of Christes catholike churche, meaning your popishe religion and churche, and manie times ye wishe the Bishop to acknowledge it, but he and all godly wise men doo sée howe you are deceyued in your well meaning, by euill and false assumptions, takyng that for Christs catholik church, which is not, nor the popish faith is that faith which we professed at baptisme, but a degenerate faith.
Nor Master Feckenham was baptized, if he were rightly baptized, in the name of the Pope, or the Popes religion.
Which if you doe meane, your selfe meane not so well to him as you pretende.
Now for the vntruth of the Bishops well meaning to M. Feckenham (be the cause as it be may, this way or that) howe dare you so boldely anouch, that it is incredible the B. shoulde meane him well? Beware M. St. ye presume not to sit in Gods seate, the hart of man, which for meaning is only knowne to God and the meaner.
Qui enim hominum scit quae sunt hominis, nisi spiritu hominis qui in eo est? For what man knoweth the things that are of man, but the sprite of man that is within him? certaine friend of yours standing by and hearing what had declared then to the honorable in your commendation, did shortly after reporte the same vnto you.
Any answere were néedlesse, but that the facing of this man is shamelesse, that denieth so boldely he knoweth not what.
The right honorables (God be praysed) be yet aliue, to whom the Bishop reported it: the stander by at the same time, as those right honorables can tell, was a Gentleman named M. White, of Southwicke, whome since God hath called away, which openly to M. Feckenham, in the hearing of the Bishop and all other present, declared that he hearde the Bishop speake to the honourable in his comendation.
Al this notwithstanding, in M. Stapleto~ like another suborned Stilpho, that neyther was there, nor, as he confesseth in his Prface Pag.
had any skil of the priuate doing betwéen them, and yet he steppeth in as boldely as though he had ben the chiefe and denieth, that there wa any such reporte at all.
But to vse his owne termes, what is impudencie if this be not? Doubting that you confederats should vnderstand of your reolte,
which they euer feared hauing experience of your shrinking from them at
Here in your score are notched vp two seuerall vntruths, in your answere, bothe these two by contraction are but one vntruth· and thus ye can not kéepe your tale.
Yea, But this (saye you) incomparably passeth and farre excelleth all your foresayd vntruthes, and so belike it maye goe well for two it selfe.
But wherefore is this so passing an vntruthe? The bishop sayd his confederates feared his noueltie, hauing experience of his shrinking from them.
To this you replie and say: In what one point of religion did he shrinke from his companie? and in the ende ye come in asking further: VVhat shrinking in religion call ye this? as though the Bishop had charged him with shrinking from them in religion.
then would they no longer haue feared it, being alreadie done: but they were afterward afrayd of his shrinking in religion, séeing his shrinking from them, in that so péeuishly they stacke to their obstinate refusal, wherin your self co~fesse, they refused to obey the Queenes highnesse co~mandement.
And the lesse matter ye wold make it, ye lesse ought they to haue shewed such disobedience, had they ben good subiects (as they prete~d) or had they in déed stuck to their cause.
But they shronke fro~ their cause, which of likelyhood they suspected.
Howbeit M. Feck. seing not so much in it as they, he (as you say) for his parte thought it not good to disobey the Queenes highnesse commandement, and so therin shranke from them.
This (Master Staple.) your self confesse, and so or euer ye wist, ye clere the Bishop of this incomparable vntruth.
vntruth, that M. Feck. should giue vp his treatise in writing, after he was resolued by Horne.
And in his counterblast, How vnlikely a tale is this? that Maister Feckenham should either bee resolued by Maister Horne, or beeing resolued, shoulde then giue vp his matter in writing, for none other cause, than M. Horne reporteth.
durst make any indifferent man iudge, yea a number of M. Hornes owne sect, there is no apparance there is no colour of this matter, and therfore wil be so bold as to adde this to his other vntruth.
This vntruth springeth of two causes: the one, the vnlikelyhod of the matter, the other, M. Stapleto~s boldnes, for he wil be so bold as to score it vp.
But pray you M. Sta. is euery vnlikelyhood an vntruth with you? ye are ouer bold that dare so affirme.
Were ye present there? Did ye see the dealing? can ye tel the co~trary? No· How dare ye then say it· write print it to all ye world, yt it is an vntruth.
Is this suf proof to say, it is vnlikly to be, Ergo it is not? to presse this vnlikelyhood the sorer, there is no apparance say you, there is no color in this matter.
In déed here ye say truer tha~ ye are aware, there is no colour nor apparance· but the very truth it selfe, in yt the B. sayd, neither yet an vnlikely truh therin.
Nay, say you, dare make any indifferent man iudge, yea a number of M. Hornes owne sect, that it is not lykely that M. Feck. should be resolued, or should giue vp his treatise in writing· after he was resolued by M. Horne.
What? man, if you remember you but of youre own, of your maister D. Hardings inconstancie, and other a number euen of youre owne sect ere this, ye may find likelyhod inough of M. Feckenha~s resolution, yea euen in himself in K. Henries dayes, and therfore bewar whom ye make iudge in the matter of this vnlikelyhood.
But setting like or vnlyke apart, may a man be so bold as to say, that your selfe (so boldly charging the B. with an vnlikely vntruth make a manifest vntruthe: for the B. said not (a you tel the tale) that M. Feck. was resolued, or that he wrote his treatise after he was resolued, but that he seemed resolued, these were the bishops words.
And so he likewise said before, yt he semed resolued, in a maner flly satisfied, that he semed openly to haue little matter to stand in, but that he was resolued that is to say fully persuaded, the B. might haue some cause (for all his hope) to dout, knowing that, wisedom wil not enter into a froward mind.
And the Bishop here telleth, how afterwarde he perceyued the contrary to his former opinion of M. Feckenham, declaring how he pointed to his brest, saying: that was there (meaning Poperie) that should neuer goe out.
Thus ye vntruly say, the B. sayd, that the B. sayd not, and then (being your owne vntruthe ye skore it vp as his.
How soeuer by words ye would seem to tender hir Maiesties safetie, quietnesse, and prosperous raigne: your deedes declare your meaning to be quite contrary.
M. Feck. by al his deeds, hath always shewed himself a most obedient subiect.
His dysobedience to hir highnesse authoritie herein, and the priuie dispersing of his boke, to bréede a misseliking as is before shewed, is proufe ynough hereof.
Howebeit this must néedes be a villanous vntruth, for no milder terme will serue this gentleman.
And yet himselfe is farre worsse than M. Feckenham in the same fault, as his Common place of slaunders, to whom this terme villanous, might better agrée, doth declare: where he neither spareth hir highnesse or cuntrie, nor any estate, or lawes thereof, howe soeuer here he speake of obedience and subiection, as thoughe he were as innocent as a lambe.
How much prosperitie you wishe to hir Maiestie appeareth, when with
deepe syghes and grones you loke daylie for a chaunge thereof, and that
vntruthes, diuelishe and spritishe, blasphemous, horrible, and villanous, for neyther is the Pope any heretike, neyther doe catholikes make him their God, neyther wish they him to raigne in the Queenes place, that is to saye, haue temporall iurisdiction as the Queenes Maiestie hath.
Here is an heape of sore vntruthes, piked out of one poore sentence, and yet are al so apparant truthes, as al the world may sée them.
Your grones and sighes for a change, not only of the Religion hir Maiestie setteth oute, but also of the authoritie that hir highnesse taketh on hir, not only the prime whisperings, letters, tokens, and comforting of the Papists, in hope of a day, that long ere nowe ye looked for, doe declare: but these your books that ye priuily scatter about, and your selfe euen here in this present Chapter, doe shewe your good heart, saying, and for my parte pray God hartily the triall once would come.
What cal ye this earnest wish, but a sigh and a grone? which is in déed as ye terme it, both diuelish and spritish, but hypocritae peribit, the hypocrites hope shall perish.
That the Pope is no heretike ye stoutely affirme, but ye cleare him not.
You say, that the Catholikes make him not their God.
The Bishop sayd not the catholikes did so, but the Papists, howebeit ye will haue vs presuppose, you be catholikes.
But catholikes or papists, who are they that write Dominus Deus noster Papa, our Lorde God the Pope, and giue him that honor that is only due to Christ? Ye wish him not to raigne in the Queenes place ye saye, that is, to haue temporall iurisdiction, as the Queenes maiestie hath.
Who made you M. Cotroller to take so vppon you to assigne the Quéenes maiestie hir place, which ye make verie straight for hir highnesse to sitte in? The better halfe of hir throne your self here yéelde to your Pope, that is, all hir gouernement ouer spirituall matters, and ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, leauing hir Maiestie no more roome in hir own seat, than ye woulde do any heathen Prince or Turke: to haue only temporall iurisdiction in their Realmes.
But think ye your Pope will be yet content with this, hauing gotten the halfe of the place, wil he not striue for the whole, and thrust the Princes cleane out? How serued he the Emperours of Gréece? how serued he diuers Germaine Emperours? how lerned he King Childerike of France? how serued he King Iohn of England? sat he not alone in the whole place? made he not this realme tributarie to him, somuch as in him lay? Did he neuer claime the kingdome of Cicile, nor the kingdom of Irelande? yea doth he not say, that al Princes temporal iurisdiction floweth from him, and he may depose the~? Did the Pope neuer put off and set on with his foot an emperours diademe? Did he neuer himself weare the scepter, swoord, and robes of an Emperor? Did he neuer giue the temporall iurisdiction of this realme to the French, and after reuoked the French againe? And what doth he nowe? Hath he not giuen the temporall iurisdiction, and the estate of the crowne and realme to any that can waste, spoyle or conquer it, saying as though he were Christ, Qui potest capere, capiat, he that can take it, take it, so that he will become the Popes man for it? What is this but to take vpon him to sitte in hir highnesse and in all other Princes places? The.
vntruthes, are none of them so proued, as is euidently shewed in the answere to the
chap. for that he hath not improued the Bishops definition of a supreme gouernour, but rather in matter agréeth therwith, and al his examples shew the truth therof.
Like an vnfaithfull subiect co~trary to yt oth &c. you helped to spoyle Quene Mary of a principal part of hir royal power right and dignitie.
vntruth slandrous, for M. Feck. so did, not as an vnfaithfull subiect, but as a repentant catholike.
Ye haue well excused him M. Stapleton, and he is much beholding to you therfore.
Where the B. laid to his charge that contrary to his othe made to King Henry, he helped to spoyle Queene Mary of hir royall power, right and dignitie: ye confesse the fact, and say, he did so, but what then, he did it (say you) not as an vnfaithfull subiect, but as a repentant catholike.
Yeare as good a Proctor for your client, sée, M. Stapleton, as the Proctour that taught his simple client to saye, did so, but what then, who is his witnesse? where no witnesse néeded when the partie had confessed the fact.
So you Master Stapleton confesse, that M. Feckenham periured himselfe to his Prince, and that he spoyled hys soueraigne Queene Mary of hir royal power, right and dignitie.
But ye stande in the maner of the doing it, whiche is not so much material how he did it, as whether he did it or no.
And since ye confesse so fréely for him (as his proctour) that he did so, may tell ye agayn, howsoeuer he so did, it coulde not be so doone, but like an vnfaithfull subiect, (I had almost sayd worse) for any subiect liuing, vnder any preence to spoyle his Prince, of his or hir principall, or any part of their royal power, right or dignitie.
Call ye that Catholike repentance? that is catholike repentance with al my harte.
And if you do not repent and recant your note of this vntruth, M. Feckenham may repent that euer he hired you, that haue not as ye saye, slaundered him, but spoyled him of all his faith and honestie.
Now where the Bishop sayd he spoyled hir: Of a principall parte of hir Royall power, ryghte, and dignitie, Yée adde youre.
vntruth, this is no part at all of the Princes royall power.
Yedenye this too late Maister Stapleton: For where before the Byshop charged hym, that hée spoyled hir of a principall parte, and you saye for him he did so, youre selfe bothe directly, graunte it a principall parte, and indire ely, bycause hee spoyled hir, whereof praye you, but of that béelonged vnto hir? For otherwyse hée spoyled hir not, if it were not hir ryghte.
And then shoulde you haue sayde, he dydde not so, whyche you doo not, but flatlye confesse, hee dydde so, and therefore it was a parte thereof.
You play nowe after your retourne into your holde, as you did after the Parliament before ye came out of the Tower to me.
The Tower is not M. Feckenhams hold, for it holdeth him, not he it.
This vntruth, in the yrkesome number of his ragman roll, is chiefly noted to recreate the spirits of the reckoner, with some pleasaunt deuise, as M. Stapleton in his merrie conceyt, thought good to sporte at the name of holde, saying, the Tower is not his holde, for it holdeth him, but not he it.
He lerned belike that iest of the fellon in Newgate, to who~ when one sayde he was in for a birde, that is vntrue, quoth he, am in for an horsse: so dalieth M. Stapleton about the ambiguousnesse of this word holde.
And when al his holde is done, it is no vntruth, of any matter, nor spéech neyther, so long as men vse it both ways commonly: but dare say M. Stapleton would be loth, to haue the Tower no lesse his holde, than it is M. Feckenhams.
His two laste vntruthes proued that M. Feckenham deserued that holde.
As for M. Stapleton who thinketh himself safe in his holde at Louain: what holde he well deserueth elsewhere, his reuerent spéeches on the Quéens maiestie, hir Parliament, and Realme, in this his boke declare, besides his open and stubborne disobedience.
Whereby (your friendes) might be the rather induced to continue their good opinion conceyued of you, and also pay your charges weekely in the Tower, sente vnto you
euery Saturdaye by your seruant, who wrote and deliuered the Copies abroade as ye tolde me your selfe.
The Queenes Highnesse wordes in the Towre can testifie the contrarie.
Did the Quéenes highnesse in the Tower saye, that M. Feckenhams friendes did not send vnto him wéekly to pay his charges? did hir highnesse say so M. Stapleton? ye affirme it boldly, and nicke it on youre score.
But till yee proue it, ye shall giue me leaue to thinke, that youre wits were occupied about some other matter, or else ye woulde haue set this note in some other place.
For in your counterblast speaking of this matter purposely, ye haue nothing to say there to it, but that it is (as farre as can vnderstand) stark false.
And so calling it the Bishops gueste and sumize, ye would put him to his proofe by some circumstance: so that there it séemeth ye can not flatly improue it, but requiryng further proofe, déeming it a guesse, daring not say it is stark false, but as far as ye vnderstand and yet in your score so flatly to auouche it for a certain vntruth and so redily and precisely to affirme, that the Queenes Maiestie sayde the contrarie therto, iudge your self how these things ha~g togither.
Now that ye ar returned again to the tower, and perceyuing that your frendes (as you gaue them iust cause) haue some mistrust of youre reuolt, and wauering inconstancie, whereby youre estimation and fame, with your seruice to youre God the belly, is decayed.
Ye still confounde your talie, M. Stapleton, in nicking on so fast without aduisement, making one an whole heap, and an whole heape of vntruthes, but one vntruth.
Belyke yée doe it by the figures of Arithmetike, diminution, and multiplication, that ye vpbrayde to the Bishop in your preface, wherby many are but this one, and yet this one is many, yea many slaunderous and rayling vntruths.
Although ye proue neither one slaunder, or railing, or any one vntruth at all: but lette it quite alone, for feare of opening further matter.
sore head ye wist is soone broken, and if they shoulde fall out in the ripping of them to be true, M. Feckenham might rather beshrew your heart, than con ye any thanke for noting suche vntruthes.
Other vntruthes he chiefly standeth vpon in his counterblast, but they are none of the reckoning.
As the Bishops noting of M. Feckenhams impudencie, saying: VVhervnto presently am required to svveare, when no othe by the Bishop was required at all of him.
These and other falsehoodes that the B. layeth to M. Feck. charge, Stap. though he say in his counterblast, that the B. accumulate an huge heape of vntruths, yet for shame durst he not put them in his score, neither one by one nor alon a plump, for feare his reckoning shoulde be called to an accompt, but thruste them vp together in the thicke of his booke.
And yet séeing in the ende hée coulde not excuse Maister Feckenham of those thinges wherewith the Bishop charged hym: Howe soeuer it be (sayeth he) this matter is nothing appertayning to the state of the principall question, and of small importaunce.
Where in déede it muche apperteyneth to the purpose of the controuersie betwéen the parties, and is of great importance, to shewe the entrie into the whole controuersie.
But if it had ben as light as he would haue it séeme, is it therfore lawfull for M. Feck. to lie so impudently therin, or for M. Stapl. so to excuse his lying? You did know, acknowledge and confesse this supreme authoritie in causes ecclesiasticall to be in king Henrie the eight and his heires.
For no man can knowe that which is not true.
As ye were before disposed to be somwhat pleasant in your note of the holde, so here you vtter an other knack of your budget, to shewe howe déepe a Philosopher ye were in suttle knowledge, and therfore where the Bishop according as eche man vseth to speake, did say, that M. Feckenham did know and acknowledge it then, in confessing this supreme authoritie of the Prince, you contend on the word knowe, that hée did not knowe it, bycause it is not true, and cite Aristotle to witnesse.
Why sir, dothe not the Scripture euen in the beginning, mention Arborem scientiae boni mali, The tree of the knowledge of good and euill? And yet doe all the Philosophers say, that Verum bonum, malum falsum conuertuntur, looke what is true that is good, and looke what is euill, that is false.
Knowledge therfore is not alwayes taken so precisely to be onely of true things, but graunting you this precisenesse that knowledge is only taken to be true thing yet you do yll herein, bicause ye take after your ordinarie custome Pro concesso controuersum, that to be graunted that is in question, whether your or our part be true or false héerin.
Yea, why maye not we saye, and that wyth greater reason, that you take the truthe for falsehoode, and falsehoode for truthe.
And so you, nor any of your syde, notwithstanding all youre great bragges, and thys your clearkly booke, haue anye true knowledge.
VVell maye ye saye (as ye doo moste falsly,) and to youre poore wretched soule, as well in this as in other poyntes, moste dangerously beleue the contrarie, but know it yee can not vnlesse it were true, for knowledge is only of true things and as the Philosopher sayth, Scire est per causas cognoscere.
Do ye know whose words al these be? and yet ye sée how they serue our turne far better than yours M. Sta. bycause our cause resteth on the truth, which is the infallible worde of God, Deus est verax, God is true yours is grounded on ye doctrines of men, Omnis aute~ homo mendax, but euery man is a lier.
And therfore is it lesse maruel, sith ignorance and falsehood, knowledge truth are al one, that ye account somuch of ignorance, make it to be the mother of deuotion, that ye kepe down ye people in ignora~ce, which conspireth with falshood, cannot abide knowledge yt is linked with truth: as ye haue lo~g kept ye truth vnder a bushel, so yet you ca~not abide yt it shuld come to ye knowlege of ye people, perceiuing ye sith knowledge hath begon to spring in the world, our cause wtal, as ye truth hath florished, yours hath drouped as yt falshod: wherfore your fre~ haue cried out vpo~ al good letters, séeing that their cause hathe had no greater enimie than knowledge is, no greater maynteyner than ignoraunce, Qui male agit odit lucem, nec venit ad lucem, ne opera eius arguantur.
He that doth euill (sayth Christ) hateth the lighte, nor commeth to the light, lest his workes should be reproued.
Next vnto this, you note a rabblement of vntruthes but ye neither number them in youre Calendar (but onely marke them with a starre in the forbead) nor in youre replie say any more vnto them than this: will not, nor tyme will serue to discusse them, but why woulde youre will and your time serue you to chalenge them for vntruths, and not serue you to discharge your chalenge, and your owne truth, in prouing them so to be? but go to, see there is no remedie wée must tarie your leysure, vntil that youre will come on you, and that your tyme will serue you.
This was so vntrue that all the world rang of it, and the Papists themselues cried out theron.
Although ye were in the Tower in king Edwardes tyme, that was not for any doubte of the supremacie, for that ye still agnised, but for other poynts of religion, touching the ministration of the sacraments.
This was not the cause of his imprisonment, as shall appeare.
Here in his beadroll thoughe ye sée he denyeth it latly, yet in his counterblast, where he toucheth the same, he dare not be so impudent.
But saith as vnderstande, so that if hée be chalenged of rash dealing, to affirme that for an vntruth, that he stammereth in: no will he saye, looke my beadroll, and ye shall fynde that denyed it flatly and boldly withoute any stammering at the matter.
If againe this bolde flatnesse be proued a atte lie, ushe will he sai, referred it (in saying it shoulde appeare) to my counterblast, where declare no further, than vnderstode by my freendes, let it light on them if it be a lie: thus cunningly Maister Stapleton hath handled the matter.
But a manifeste lye it is, that he maketh, howsoeuer he auonch or mollifie the same.
For this was a special cause of his imprisonment, as those can tell that be yet liuing, who were sente to him, and to others to persuade them therein.
And by whome soeuer hée vnderstoode it, it is but M. Stapletons, and his misseinformers lye.
And where he would excuse the matter, bicause he was examined in the matter of Iustification, doth it follow therfore he was not in, also, for the matter of the sacrament, being principally then in controuersie? The Bishop only said be was in, for other pointes of religion (and namely) touching the Sacrament, but sée howe pretily M. Stapl. would bleare the readers eyes with quarelling at this half point of the sentence, least the reader shoulde marke wherin the Bishop principally charged M. Feckenham, that hee had confessed this article of supremacie, all King Edwardes dayes, and so knewe and acknowledged it then, contrarie to his pretence of ignorance nowe therin.
But from this M. Stapleton slippeth in great silence, and sayeth not a word therto: but dalieth about other matters to finde the readers play.
And so (by his owne rule) confesseth, by not denying the verye poynt in hande: that M. Feckenham all king Edwards time, though he were in the Tower, yet euer hee agnized this title then, that he refuseth nowe.
Wherevnto also you agreed and promised to professe and preache the same in open auditorie wheresoeuer you should be appoynted.
He was not deliuered vpon any promise of recantation, but to bee disputed withall.
Here M. Stapl. maketh muche adoe to conuince the Bishop of an vntruth, and to make it seeme more probable, he citeth diuers honourable and worshipfull to witnesse, and al nothing to the purpose in hand, excusing M. Feckenham of that, wherwith no bodie charged him, and answering nothyng, but by silence consessing that, that he was charged withal.
The bishop made no mention of any conference or disputation had with M. Feckenham, after his departure oute of the tower, but of that conference whiche was with him, maister Moreman, and maister Crispine, whyle they were in the Tower.
When at their owne suite to the councell, they desired to haue some learned men, with whom to conferre, especially about the sacrifice of the Masse, the ministration vnder bothe kyndes, and the ministration vpon a table, and not an altare.
And at this their sute, Master Storie the Bishop then of Chichester, and Maister Roberte Horne then parson of All Hallows in Breadsteat, now bishop of Winchester, were appointed by the honourable counsel to deals with them, which they did, by the space of a moneth at sundry tymes, till that Master Feckenham did· consent with them in all these thrée poyntes, and so by maister Hobbies meanes was deliuered, as also M. Crispine shuld haue ben, but that death preuented him, only M. Moreman stubbornly persisting in his errours, remained still in the Tower.
In this conference M. Feckenham promised to preache, as the Bishop truly charged him.
Of which conference and promise, there be yet many on lyue, both worshipfull and honeste men, to witnesse the same, and proue you a lyer M. Stapleton, so impudently to denie it.
vntruth more slaunderous, as may wel appeare by this your booke.
It appéereth thereby right well in déede, and shall further appéere, that you also had not any greate thyng else to to saye to the contrarie neyther: excepting these and suche lyke your brabbling common places.
For answere say, they ought to take vppon them such gouernment (as doth the Quéens maiestie.)
vntruth employing a contradiction to youre former aunswere made to Mayster Feckenham, as shall appeare.
The answere is here cited for an vntruthe, but for triall it is referred to appeere in an other place, on the other side of the leafe in the counterblast, and there being cited also, bicause nothing is proued but by M. Stapletons hearesay, of an other contrarie answere, the matter is there againe further deferred to be hearde an other daye, when Maister Stapleton shall be occasioned to entreate more at large hereafter vpon the matter, wher (at the Calends of Gréece) it shal be proued both an vntruth, and to implie a contradiction.
The contradiction that he would enforce, is betwéen a suborned answer, forged to be made in the bishops name which he neuer made, and this present answere which the B. maketh: so that in déede there is no contradiction at al in his answere, bicause the one of them is of their owne making, not of his.
As for the vntruth of the Bishops answere, standeth only on M. Stapletons bare saying, that it is false and deceyuable.
And ye must wel wee, that M. Stapl is of suche indifferencie and credence, that he would not saye it on his worde, if it were not so, and therefore in any case ye must beléeue him, or else ye marre his reckoning.
vntruths, bicause they are the whole matter throughout the eight chapter wherwith he chargeth the Bishop, in the answere to the chapter they are at· large answered.
vntruth, for Moyses was the chiefe Priest, as shall be proued.
Howe this promise shall be proued, or the Bishops saying improued, to auoyde anticipations repetitons, thou must resort to M. Stapletons proues, and the answer thervnto.
The charge of chiefe gouernment ouer Gods people bothe in causes temporall and ecclesiasticall was committed to Iosue.
Iosue had not the supreme gouernement in Ecclesiasticall causes, but Eleazarus had it.
Whether he had it, that commaunded Eleazarus in ecclesiasticall matters, or Eleazarus that obeyed his commaundement, is easie to iudge.
And notwithstanding any thing that M. Stapleton bringeth beside his bare allegatio~, Iosue had the supreme gouernement therin.
To Eleazar only belonged the administration of things belonging to the Priests office.
For beside, in all thinges to be doone of Iosue, Eleazar should instruct him.
If this were beside the administration of things belonging to the Priestes office: then to administer instruction, in any thing vnto the Prince, was not the Priests office.
For if it were belonging to his office: why saye you it was beside, being conteyned in it? But sée your fonde reason, the Bishop saith, he had not the supreme gouernement, but the administration of things belonging to his office, yes say you he should instruct the Prince, Ergo, he had the supreme gouernment of him.
Neither had he, say you, that supreme gouernment as his office, or belonging to him, but besides, and not belonging thervnto, whyle the questio~ is, whether this supreme gouernement belong to the Priests office, or to the· Princes office, but your self withal exclude it from the Priestes office.
And thus to nick vp on the score apace, ye speak it séemeth) ye can not wel tell what.
Dauid. &c. the supreme gouernour ouer all estates, both of the laitie and of the clergie in all mane of causes.
Dauid was not suprme gouernour in all maner causes, but suffered the Leuites in Church matters, to liue vnder the rule of their high Priest.
As though these two might not bothe agrée verie wel togither, except it were in such an vsurper as is your Pope.
As for the Quéenes Maiestie, hir hyghnesse claymeth no suche Papaliie, but suffreth the inferiour ministers to liue vnder the rules of their superior Bishops: yet hir supreme gouernment, to ouersée, that all of them obserue their rules in their vocations, is no whit empaired.
vntruth, for Salomon of his owne authoritie (as your argument runneth) deposed not Abiathar, but executed only the sentence pronounced before by Samuel Gods minister.
Your selfe confesse the Bishops wordes M. Stapleton, nor ye can for shame denie them, the Scripture is plaine for them, and therfore ye runne from them to the Bishops sense, and say, not his wordes, but his meaning and argument is vntrue therein for he dyd it, but not by his owne authoritie, but executed Gods sentence, as thoughe these were contradictorie, to execute Gods sentence in doing it, and to doo it by his owne authoritie, when all authoritie of any Prince, commeth likewyse from God, and he is Gods minister, and executer thereof, and yet withall it is hys owne authoritie, bicause the authoritie is giuen him of God thereto.
Althoughe herein, chalenging the B. of one vntruthe, ye vtter two vntruthe your self together on a clap.
First ye say, he executed only the sentence pronounced before by Samuel Gods minister.
Where the texte that afterwarde ye cite, fayth not so, but, to fulfill the wordes of the Lorde, whiche he spake ouer the house of Hely in Silo, which wordes of the Lorde, we fynde out in th.
chapters of the first booke of the Kinges, where the whole story is at large set out, and detes your falshoode.
The wordes that doe threaten Hely and his posteritie, in the.
chapter, were pronounced by a Prophet in déede, but he is not named, the text only sayth, Venit aute~ vir dei ad Hely, ait ad eum, haec dicit Dominus, And there came a man of God to Hely and sayd vnto him, thus sayth the Lorde, &c.
This Prophet pronounced (and was Gods minister therein) among other things, euen this deposition of Abiathar.
But this man of God was not Samuell, who was at that time as yet but a childe.
The seconde time was in the next chapter, by God him selfe, that called Samuell thrée times, and the fourth time, dixit Dominus and Samuelem, the Lorde sayde, or as ye call it, pronounced vnto Samuell, &c. confirming all that he had pronounced before, by the former Prophet.
As for Samuell béeing straightly charged by Hely the hye Priest (not by the way of prophecie pronounced those words of the Lords to him, or to any other) but onely shewed him al that God had sayde, Indicauit ei vniuersos sermones, non abscondit ab eo, And Samuell tolde him euery whit of the ayings, and hidde it not from him.
And therefore where ye say, he onely executed the sentence, pronounced before by Samuell Gods minister, as though God had prophecied it, by the mouth of Samuell, as he did in the chapter before, by an other: and as ye say in your Counterblast, published before by Samuell the Leuite: the texte mentioning neither the pronouncing nor publishing of this sentence by Samuell at all, but onely the fore sayde maner of priuate telling to Hely what he heard God pronounce: it is but an vntruthe in your selfe, to tell your tale so to your aduauntage, that it might séeme that Salomon was but the executour of some solemne sentence published and pronounced before by Samuell, commaunding or mouing king Salomon, to obey that sente~ce, and so to depose Abiathar, And héere appeares also your other vntruthe, that Salomon shoulde doe it to this ende and intent, to fulfill this prophecie.
Which in déede he fulfilled in the dooing, but it was not fulfilled by him alone, king Saule had fulfilled a greate parte of it before, in causing to be killed wickedly, the whole familie of Hely, excepte onely this Abiathar, that escaped by flighte.
Whiche cruell facte of Saule, proceeding onely of méere malice agaynst Dauid, and furder agaynst them as Dauids abettours fautours: was the onely cause of this tyrannie, and not to fulfil Gods prophecie.
Neither coulde he pretende it, and yet he fulfilled the same, when he fulfilled his wicked luste.
But Salomon that deposed Abiathar, the onely remaynder of Helies stocke, and his sonnes after him, had good and righte cause to depriue him, and all his posteritie, of thys dignitie, bicause he was, as your selfe confesse, a traytour to him.
For which cause Salomon deposed him, and layde this cause to his charge onely, not that he must execute Gods sentence, of punishing his fathers offence, and yet in doing the one, he perfourmed the other also.
Bothe of these Princes were executours of Gods sentence, that wrought by his secrete Iustice, what soeuer he purposed, yea as well by the euill deede of Saule, as by the righteous déede of Salomon.
And things foretolde in the scripture, came not to passe bicause they were foretold, but bicause they should come to passe therfore they were foretold.
God did foretell what he would do to that house, yet he named not by whom, so that none could pretend to do it, bicause God had foretold it, but when God had done it (by suche instruments as he purposed, good or bad) then the writers of the scripture, by the instruction of the holy ghost, bicause of the certenty of Gods prophecie, doe say it was done, to fulfill suche or suche a thing.
So when Herod had killed the innocents, sayth S. Mathew tunc adimpletu~ est, the~ was fulfilled that which was spoken by the Prophet Ieremie, of which kinde of spéeche, as well in factes of the godly as the vngodly, we haue many ensamples.
Though therefore the wordes of the Scripture be, Eiccit ergo Salomon Abiathar, vt non esset sacerdos domini, vt impleretur semo Domini quem locutus est super domum Heli in Silo: And so Salomon cast out Abiathar, from being the priest of the Lorde, that the Lordes wordes might be fulfilled which he spake vpon the house of Hely in Silo: yet doe not these wordes import, that Salomon did it of this purpose, to fulfill that prophecie, as you woulde make the reader to vnderstande, by youre guylefull translation, saying, And so Salomon put out Abiathar. &c. to fulfil the words of the Lord as though the cause why he did it, was that, when the cause was Abiathars treason, and therfore he tolde him before, he was ilius mortis, the childe of death, id est, (sayth Lyra) morte dignus pro conspiratione co~trame, rdinationem Dei patris mei, that is to say, Thou art worthie to suffer death for thy conspircie against me, and the ordinance of God, and of my father.
Here is the verie cause why Salomon deposed him although also he fulfilled therein Gods secret iustice, whiche the holie writer considering, wrote vt adimpleretur, that the Lordes woordes might be fulfilled.
And thus whyle yée would charge the Bishop with one lye, euen your self discharge him, and you committe a couple for failing, to men the matter withall.
Neyther the Priestes nor the Leuites swarued in any thing (pertayning to their office) from that the king commaunded them.
These wordes make a heynous quarell, at which wordes also in his Counterblast, he stormeth, saying, He hath swarued lewdly from the text, added wordes more than is exprest, and that with suche homely shiftes an yll cause must be furthered.
And when all is done, it is but a little parenthesis placed in the middle of the text by the way of explication, declare, wherein the king commded them and they obeyed, in their offices nexte before set out, howe the king ordeyned according to the disposition of Dauid his father the offices of the Priests in their ministeries, and the Leuites in their orders, to prayse God, and minister before the Priests according to the custome of euery day, and the porters in their diuisions porte by porte, for so had Dauid, a man of God, commaunded, and neither the Priestes nor the Leuites swarued from any thing that the king commaunded.
Wherein the Bishop placing this parenthesis· what did he that any most exacte interpreter might not do? Stap. héere escrieth it for so horrible a cryme, yea and an vntruthe of his bedroll withall, whera first there is no vntruthe at all in the parenthesis, and himselfe in the same chapter, confesseth for Princes a great deale more: that they may not onely commaunde the Priests, to do those things that appertayne to their office, but cause them to do them, which is a manyfest proofe of the Princes supreme authoritie them, so that vntruthe in this parenthesis was there none.
Nor any other faulte at all, sauing that M. Stapleton was frowardly disposed to picke a quarell at the forme and print of the letter, not at the matter, as though those wordes were pretended to be the wordes of the texte, wherein he himselfe, though there were some negligence in the printing, dothe yet excuse the Bishop of this faulte, of any suche addition of wordes.
For twice in his Counterblast mentioning those wordes, he circumscrieth them with a parenthesis, and seuereth it in the poynting as the bishop did, from the text, which is argument inough to any, but to contentious quarellers, who will euer busie themselues to séeke, as they say, a knot in a rushe, that it was not put in, as the expresse words of the text, but as the opening of the sentence.
To returne therefore his owne wordes to him selfe, with suche homely shiftes an ill cause must be furthered, and with suche patit quarels, a good cause must be bayted at, and chalenged for lewde swaruing, and homely shiftes.
And yet his manifest swaruing from text, letter, sense, and all without either difference of letter or of poynting, must be neither lewde nor homely shifte at all, but good and Cathelike translating with him.
Iosaphat vsed his Princely authoritie in the reformation of religion.
Here M. Stapleton standeth altogither on the terme of the Scripture· would to God alwayes the Papistes would thus, not in termes so muche, as in the truthe of matter, be leueled by the scripture.
But here he dothe it euen as the deuill obiected scripture vnto Christ, not to shewe any regarde, onely aboue all other, to the authoritie of the scripture: but to picke a quarell with the Bishop, althoughe vntruthe he can finde one.
The Bishop aouched not, that this very terme is here in the scripture, nor he stoode vpon termes, and therefore though the scripture termeth it not, yet hath the Bishop committed no vntruthe.
He onely sayd, that losaphat hath· no small commendation in the scriptures, for that he vsed his Princely authoritie in the reformation of religion.
If you can improue the sentence and effect of this, then hardly chalenge the Bishop for an vntruthe.
But this can ye not doe, and therefore ye flée to termes, and let the matter alone, whiche is the principall, and is manyfest in the Scripture, that he vsed his princely authoritie in those thinges that he dyd, yea and your selfe confesse that he vsed care and diligence about the directing of ecclesiasticall matters, that he reformed religion, that he commaunded and appoynted the ecclesiasticall persons, the high Priest and all other, so well as temporall, in their ecclesiasticall functions.
This your selfe haue graunted and confessed, bothe in sentence and in termes also: and the texte is playne ye coulde not denie it.
But did he direct, refourme, commaunde, and appoynt· and all without authoritie so to doe? and what authoritie had hé besides his princely authoritie? Ergo, euen by your owne confession, he refourmed religion by his princely authoritie· as the Bishop sayde.
And therefore euen your selfe that accuse him, acquite him also of this vntruthe.
He did commaunde and prescribe vnto the thiefe Priests, &c. The.
There appeareth not in the scripture any suche prescription made vntò the chiefe Priestes.
That it appeareth in the scripture· it is most euident, and your selfe haue confessed it in your Counterblast. cap.
fol. to the which place where it is aunswered, remitte the Reader.
At the commandement of the king concerning things of the Lorde.
Those words co~cerning things of the lord, are no words of the text, but falsly added to holy scripture.
Ye are very hastie in nicking on your score, M. Sta. and so hastie, that ye haue no leasure, or will take none to examine your text.
The olde translation hath in deede iuxta ma~datu~ regis imperiu~ domini, according to the co~mandement of the king, and the co~mandeme~t of the Lord.
But the Hebrue text hath, as those that are skilful in that tongue can tell, edibrei· Ieoua: which atablus noteth to signifie, In vel de rebus Domini, In or concerning the things of the Lord, euen as the B. saide, so that he is clerely acquited by suche learned interpreters, as your skill M. Stapleton· will not easily confute.
And when ye haue co~futed them, then score vp this for an vntruth.
Although eue~ then, ye could not wel charge ye B. therwith, but the Hebrue text it selfe, and Uatablus that so expoundeth it.
And yet you note it so bitterly, for falsly added to holy scripture, not marking the common practise of your owne side, ordinarily to adde, and to subtracte what ye please from the holy scriptures, and when ye please make them not ouer holy neither, howesoeuer here to aggraate a quarell agaynst the Bishop, ye thought good to terme them holy scriptures.
But nowe to admit, that those were not the wordes of the scripture, but onely the exposition of the wordes, yea and that there was a negligence in the printing or copying out thereof, whereby the words were printed in seuerall letters like the texte, were this, M. Stapl. so heynons a faulte, where in effe the matter is moste true, and all one with the text? Did not the king commaunde them to sanctifie the Lordes house? Did they not obey and come when they had so done, and make an accounte to the king of all that they had done, saying to him: VVe haue sanctified all the house of the Lorde, and the shewbread table with all the vessels thereof, and all the furniture of the temple, &c. and see they are before the altar of the Lorde? Nowe that all these things, were things of the Lorde, or that they obeyed the kings commaundement, and made relation of al their doings to the king, concerning these things of the Lorde: This M. Stapleton medleth not withall, nor dare denie it, which is the matter in question, and fully proueth the Bishops assertion agaynst M. Feckenham, that they obeyed the kings commaundement concerning things of the Lorde.
So that in the matter of the Bishops saying, there is no vntruthe· as euen M. Stapleton him selfe can not denie the scripture is so playne.
And beeing true, it argueth most expressely the vntruthe to remayne in M. Feckenham and M. Stapleton, with their co~federates, that denie the Clergies obedience to their Princes, and the Princes authoritie of commaunding them, concerning things of the Lorde, which the scripture heere alloweth.
Nowe what dothe M. Stapleton to saue his poore honestie, as termeth it, but casting a cloude before the readers eyes lest he shoulde consider this, he quarelleth after his maner at the printe, and not so content, crieth out of wordes falsly added to holy scripture, where if the wordes had béene misprinted onely, in a wrong fourme of letter, ye the sense is all one, the matter is moste true, and the wordes them selues of the learned Hebritians, are euen so expounded, so farre are they from all false addition to holy scripture, as M. Stapleton most falsly dothe exclayme.
According as Dauid had disposed the order by the counsell of the Prophetes.
Bicause he appealeth in this vntruth to his Counterblast, where he sayth, it shall appeare, in Gods name let it there appeare, where it is also answered folz For his.
vntruthes he alleageth no reason, nor cause, onely he sayth, the former is boldely auouched, but no way proued, and the other, somewhat more impudent.
Since therefore he hath nothing wherein to conuince them, may wel returne his boldnesse and impudencie to him selfe, and remitte the tryall of the truthe or vntruthe, to the discussing of Iosias ensample.
Nowe haue you shewed your selfe playnely herein to be a Donatist also.
M. Horne and his fellowes are in many poyntes Donatistes, as shall appeare.
The triall of this vntruthe, is discoursed at large, in the proper place where M. Stapleton citeth it to appeare, there shall be heard inough, for triall of this chalenge pro contra, and as the Reader on the viewe of bothe shall there finde it, so on Gods name let him estéeme of it.
The Donatistes sayde they were of the Catholike fayth, of the Catholike shifte for their defence agaynst Gods truthe, the Popishe sectaries do vse in this our time, beeing no more of the one or of the other, than were the Donatistes and suche like.
Answere the Fortresse, M. Horne, annexed to sainct Bede, if ye dare to defende this most sensible and grosse lye.
Howe happie are you, M. Stapleton, that euer ye buylt suche a Fortresse, that ye thus can crake of, so lustily bidde vs come and assayle, crying, aunswere the Fortresse, and come if yee dare, and if he come not, then he dare not come, if he set not on your Fortresse, then this must néedes be a lye. Muste it? nowe truely then youre Fortresse is but a weake Fortresse, if the prouing this a lye doe aunswere and ouerturne your Fortresse.
We néede neuer goe thither for the matter, to proue your Church no the catholike Church, nor to haue the catholike fayth, this wil be proued in this booke well inough warrant ye, or euer it be ended, ye shal sée your self more than once or twice confesse it.
And diuers other haue at large proued it, what néede we then runne to your Fortresse.
M. St. gathereth an other vntruthe, but before it he setteth downe two marginall notes.
The first where the Bishop sayd: All the sectes of the Donatistes, whether they be Gaudentians, Petilians, Rogatists, Papistes, or any other sect. &c. Upon this word Papistes, master Stapleton maketh a starre, saying: You should haue sayd Protestantes who in so many points as hath bene shewed, resembled the Donatistes.
It is well inough M. Sta. and ye can let it stand, til time be ye haue vntrussed all those poyntes, euen from your own sloppes, then ye may go perhaps like Baily hosegodowne.
Where the Bishop hauing alleaged a long sentence of S. Augustine agaynst M. Feckenham.
Thus farre S. Augustine (sayth he) by whose iudgement of the catholike Church, &c. Note (sayth M. Stap.) that nowe S. Augustines iudgement is also the iudgement of the catholike Churche.
To the which note also adde this note withall (M. Stapleton) that your Church is not then the Catholiks Church, whose iudgement herein agréeth not with Sainct Augustines iudgement.
Loe M. Stapleton howe pretily yourself begin to aunswere your last vntruth, if ye holde on thus, we shall not greatly néed to scale your fortresse, euen this your Cou~terblast will encounter and ouerblowe it.
The opinion there mencioned, and confuted by S. Augustine, is this of the Donatists, that the order, rule, and gouernment, practised be the Kinges of the olde Testament in ecclesiasticall causes, ar not figures and prophecies of the like gouernment to bee in the kings vnder the newe Testament, nor the order that Christ lefte behinde him in his Gospell newe Testament.
This was the opinion of the Donatistes in Saint Augustines time, and this is yours, Master Fecknams, and Master Dormans opinion nowe, that they are not such figures and prophecies, and therfore ye confesse your selfe fol.
that M. Feckenham omitted the proufes of the olde Testament, bycause they made against him.
Nowe whether this be an erroniouse opinion or no, commit you and Saint Augustine togither to scamble about it.
Whither S. Augustine haue witnessed no such large and supreame gouernment as we attribute now to Princes, yea whither Master Stapleton haue graunted so much or no, is proued at large in the.
Your wilfulnesse is such, that you delight only in wrangling against the truth.
Then are your selfe this claunderer M. Stapleton that confesse, Folio.
he omitted to shewe forthe the truths, of purpose bicause it made agaynst him, what is this but wifull wrangling agaynst the truthe? Constantine made many holesome lawes and godly constitutions wherewith he restrayned the people with threates, forbidding the sacrificing to Idols, to seeke after the diuelishe and superstitious soothsaying to set vp Images.
They were Idols, not Images that Constantine forbad his subiects to set vp.
he sayth: to say that Constantine forbad to et vp Images, is an open and a shamelesse lye.
The very words euen in the same place, and many other of the booke, are playne agaynst Images, and nameth bothe Idols and Images also, as the Bishop dothe.
Which withal confuteth his subtile distinction, betwéene Image and Idoll, as though an Image might not be an Idoll also.
For Constantine forbiddeth bothe [undefined span alphabet] and [undefined span alphabet].
As for [undefined span alphabet] your selfe confesse he forbad, whether he forbad Images or no, these are Eusebius owne wordes in Gréeke, [undefined span alphabet].
Euen so Christe our Sauiour confirmed this their authoritie, commaunding all men to attribute and giue vnto Cesar that which belongeth vnto him.
This place of S. Mathew maketh nothing for the Princes supreme gouernement in ecclesiasticall things.
It maketh, as the Bishop alleaged it, to confirme al that authoritie by Christes Gospell, that was due before in the time of the olde Testament, Which your selfe graunt· but that Princes had supreme authoritie in ecclesiastical things, in the time of the olde Testament, the Bishop proued before, and your selfe also graunted it, though ye denied such supreme gouernement as we attribute.
Therefore this place maketh some thing for Princes supreme gouernment in ecclesiasticall things, so bewrayeth your owne vntruth and the truth of the Bishop.
This to be Christes order and meaning that the kings of the nations should be the supreme gouernours ouer their people, not onely in temporall, but also in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes, the blessed Apostles Peter and Paule, doe playnely declare.
So saye you in déede, Stapleton, but the Bishops proofes out of Chrisostome and sainct Augustine, do playnly declare they did.
Of misunderstanding sainct Augustine, bicause, besides this bederoll, he also chargeth the Bishop therewith at large in the Counterblast, it is answered seuerally in the answere of the.
Not meaning only the transgressors of the seconde table in te~porall matters, but also agaynst the offendours of the first table in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes or matters.
Sainct Augustine meaneth not to teach suche gouernement of Princes in ecclesiasticall matters, as you teache, but onely to punishe Heretikes, and by the same to mayntayne the Catholike fayth decreed by the Clergie, not by the ciuill Magistrate.
Belike ye can tell better what sainct Augustine meant, than be could him selfe.
But S. Augustine is playne, he néedeth no suche interpreter.
Remember your owne note, maledicta glossa quae corrumpit textum, Cursed be that glose that corrupteth the text.
S. Aug. interpreting ye mynd of ye Apostle to be, that the authoritie power of Princes hath to deale in ecclesiastical causes so wel as in te~poral.
Ye shoulde haue tolde out the sentence of S. Augustine, that the B. citeth, which fully proueth it, and then haue improued it as an vntruth if ye coulde, whiche although ye do not, yet in the margine of that sentence, ye crye out lustily and say, where is there in all this master Horne that the Princes haue to deale in ecclesiastical causes, so well as in temporall? For sooth master Stapleton euen here at your hand, in this present sentence, wherein S. Augustine proueth, and your selfe also graunt so muche, that the Princes authoritie, punishethe so well abuses in eccl. causes, and faultes againste religion, as it doth ciuill or temporall causes, but it punisheth all external faultes and abuses in al ciuil and temporal causes, that by his supreme authoritie therein, not as an others executioner.
Ergo, it punisheth al external abuses and faults in all ecclesiasticall causes and religion, and that by his supreme authoritie therein, and not as the clergies executioner.
Eusebius. &c. vnderstanding the ministerie of the ciuill Magistrate to be about Gods religion and eccle. causes so well as temporall.
Eusebius neuer vnderstoode any such ministerie of the ciuill Magistrate.
In what things Eusebius vnderstoode the ciuil Magistrats ministerie to consist, the B. set downe Eusebius his owne wordes, to proue that he vnderstood it so: you say he neuer vnderstoode it so, but ye set downe neuer a worde, neyther here, nor in your Counterblaste to proue the contrarie, which tyll ye shall be able to do, the Byshoppes vnderstanding of Eusebius by his owne wordes is no vntruthe.
Eusebius saythe, that in preaching by hys decrees true godlynesse, in setting foorthe the religion of the moste holy lawe, and the most blessed faythe, the Princes ministerie consisteth in these things, so wel as any other, or before al other, as his best ministerie But these things are not ciuill matters but spirituall and ecclesiasticall: Ergo, his ministerie by Eusebius vnderstanding consisteth so well in ecclesiasticall or spirituall matters as ciuill or temporall.
This moste Christian Emperoure did rightly consider as he hadde bene truely taughte, of the moste Christian Byshoppes of that tyme, that as the Princes haue in charge the mynisterie and gouernement in all manner causes eyther temporall or spirituall.
And in his Counterblast: say it is a starke and most impudent lye that ye say without any profe.
Constantine was taught of the Byshoppes, that Princes haue the gouernement in all manner causes, eyther temporall or spirituall, ye conclude after your manner, facingly and desperately, vvithout any proufe or halfe proufe in the worlde.
Here are wonderfull boysterous wordes Master Stapleton, but greate boast and small roaste, as they say.
For all this hyghe chalenge standeth on saye and so in déede it appéereth to be your saying, but hadde it not béene your saying Master Stapleton, woulde haue thought it hadde béene some cotqueanes cryaleyson, and woulde haue answered, a wispe, a wispe, for setting aside your foule language, what vntruthe is here concluded, or what concluded that is not proued? The Prince hath the setting foorthe of true religion of Gods moste holy lawe, and the moste blessed faythe, but these thinges are not ciuill but ecclesiasticall and spirituall: the Prince hath to pute awaye and ouerthrowe all euilles that presse the vvoorlde, but none presse the worlde more daungerously than superstition, Idolatrie, erroures, heresies, scismes, sectes, and false religion, all whiche are no ciuill but ecclesiasticall and spirituall matters: The Prince dothe these thinges not as an executioner of an others ministerie, but all the dooing hereof is the ministery properly belo~ging to his owne office, yea it is his best ministerie.
Ergo, he dothe all these thinges with as muche or more full and proper authoritie of his office· as he dothe any other ciuill thing, But his ministerie in ciuill things is by his supreme authoritie vnder God therin, whose minister S. Paule calleth him.
This is the Bishops conclusion moste playne and true, all your blackemouthed Rhethorike to the contrarie notwithstanding.
For this cause also Nicephorus, &c. compareth Emanuell Paleologus the Emperoure to Constantine.
There is no doubt some great cause that moued you M. Stapleton, to put this in your bederoll of vntruthes, that the Bishop sayd, for this cause.
And if you were asked for what cause ye doe so, it séemeth it would be harde for you to render any, and therefore ye take a wise and a short way to tell vs it shall appeare.
But here ye shewe none, nor any at all here appeareth.
And where it shoulde appeare, there appeareth none also, except this be sufficient reason onely to denie it, and say, it is no cause at all.
For these wordes onely appeare there: VVhere ye say, for this cause also, &c. this is no cause at all, but is vntrue, as of the other Emperour Constantine, and muche more vntrue, as ye shall good reader straight way vnderstande.
What cause pray you is here alleaged? and yet this is all that ye say vnto it, sauing that as ye sayde before, it shoulde appeare, referring vs there, hither: here ye saye, as the reader shall straightway vnderstande it.
And yet neyther straight way nor crooked way, ye speake one worde more of the matter, but goe about the bushe, medling with other matters, and not with the truthe, or vntruthe hereof any more.
And so it appeareth nusquam, and the reader shall vnderstande it nunquam.
Neyther is it any maruell, if ye can not lette the reader to vnderstande it, for thinke ye vnderstoode not the Byshops wordes your selfe, which if ye had done, ye wold neuer haue quoted it for an vnth for shame.
Ye knowe the Byshop before hauing, for the vnderstanding of saint Paules wordes for the Princes ministerie, alleaged the ensample of Constantine, to shewe that his best ministerie consisteth in his carefull zeale, direction of Gods glorie and truth, and other matters of religion, wherein Eusebius commendeth him, being a famous ecclestastical writer, and allowed amongst you: sythe also Nycephorus another your late famous ecclesiasticall writer, co~parth moste expresly herein the Emperour of his time, to Constantine the great: what vntruth hath the Byshop committed to say, For this cause Nycephorus compareth the one to the other, for that he did so neerely imitate his duetifulnesse, in ruling, procuring, and reforming religion to the purenesse thereof.
If Nycephorus haue not thus in these poynts compared them, then a Gods name blame the Byshop, that sayde for this cause alo Nicephorus. &c. but if Nicephorus haue so done, then is the Bishop clered of this vntru, that said did so.
And if ye haue any quarrel to picke, go picke it against Nicephorus, that so did, and not againste the Byshop, that only sayde he did so.
Nowe whither Nicephorus haue done as the Byshop sayde did or no, let the reader be vper.
The words of Nicephorus are long, notwithstanding will set downe some of them, writing to the Emperoure he sayth thus.
Verily one shall suffice me as mighte aye for all, with whome also perchaunce, for that kinred and likelyhood whiche is betweene you and him, you will gladly suffer your selfe to be compared, and is this any other than that Consta~tine, the great valoure and name among all men? Constantine whose memorie ought to be as it were a certaine sprite in all menne.
Constantine the greate in suche artes as belong to an Emperour, in prudence incomparable, but in feruencie towardes God, and in great actes atchieued, and contentions susteyned for the true godlynesse he is aboue all, euen as the Sun is shining aboue the starres.
And art not thou most excellent Prince the verie certain image of him (& here noteth in the margent co~paratur. &c.
The Emperor is co~pared to Constantin the great, and is conferred with him) verily eue~ so doth the glasse render the right shape of the Image, as thou expressest the diuine shewe of his mynde, and glisterest again being very like vnto him, none otherwise than euen the naturall sonne doth represent his father: and although know well thou wilt disalowe my boldnesse which art chiefly wont to auoyde and beware of such prayses, notwithstanding will not doubte to saye this thing (whiche beeseech thee suffer me and consider my reason, sith chiefly knowe that thou art the sonne of God by grace and the Lords anointed aboue the reste) that thou art the Image of him in all poyntes alyke, which manifestly hast obtained the very godly form of him, and the force and impression eyther of his liuing or imperial substance.
And so he runneth into particular poyntes, wherin he compareth them togther.
Is not all this enough master Sta. to proue the Bishops saying true, for this caue alo Nicephorus· &c. compareth these two Emperours togither: but you this, and shewing no cause in the world why ye chalenge the Bishop therefore, runne to an other quarell about the Emperours name, bycause the B. sayde as followeth.
For this cause also Nicephorus in his Preface before his ecclesiasticall hystorie, dothe compare Emanuell Paleologus the Emperoure to Constantine.
Ye are aunswered to this at large in the replye to your Counterblasting theron What soeuer his name were, as it is called in question, so the Byshop is cleared thereof, following your owne principall auors doctors, that translting and setting out this story, named him euen as the oth Emanuel Paleologus, not once nr twice neyther, the blinde man castes his affe, but as they say the~selues, on good considerations among them therevno.
So say you M. Stapleton, and so ye reuile him in your Counterblaste, for a wretched heretike also, and a wicked dooer.
But your ecclesiasticall writer Nicephorus saith not so of him, he reciteth many vertue· and also and excellent vertues of this Emperour.
If he were not suche a one, or had not such vrtues as Nicephorus reheareth him to haue, what is that to the Byshop who only sayth? Nicephorus reciteth his noble vertues.
And to proue this true, the whole preface of Nicephorus is manifest, beeing for the most part nothing but the Princes co~mendation of such noble vertues as Nicephorus sheweth he was endewed withall.
He calleth him principn omniu~ Christi aantissimo atque humanissimo, qui prorsus omnes virtutes complexus, nihil rerum pulcerrimarum excellentissimaum pretermisisti.
The Emperor most louing of Christ, and most teous, who hauing throughly atained all vertues, haste let slip nothing that is moe faire and excellent.
It were tedious to rcite al or the quarter of that he citeth in the prayse of this Emperours vertues.
The preface throughout is manyfest, the Byshops allegations that ye can not denie, the comparison aforesaide betweene him and Constantine do declare, yea your self confesse, that Nicephorus doth highly aduance and ex this Emperour.
But as Nicephorus saith, if wée may beléeue him on his credite, beeing called of all your side scriptor per onmia verè catholicus, a verye catholike writer in all poynts, he flattreth him not, nor forgeth, but speaketh the truth, in praysing of him, al which dothe sufficiently acquite the Byshoppe for saying that Nicephorus reheareth his noble vertues.
This is onely a marginal note that the Bishop prfireth to all the allegations that he citeth out of Nicephorus, to any one sentence of which allegations M. Stapleton answereth nothing.
But thus iustleth at the marginall note, and sendeth vs to his Counterblaste thereon, where it shall appeare how vntrue, howe fonde and foolishe it is.
Which the reader shall iudge when he hath read his Counterblaste, the answere thereto.
That by their rule, ministerie and seruice, not onely peace and tranquillitie, but also godlynesse and religion should be furdered and continued amongst men.
Ye doe the Byshoppe manifest iniury M. Stapleton, neyther haue ye any vauntage to pretende any of your former quarels at the printe of the letters, it is euident the Byshop setteth not down those words, as the bare words of the trt of S. Paule, whiche he cited the line before adverbum, and with diffinct letter, which he doth not here, but Paraphrastically expoundeth the texte.
Wherein if he doe wreste the meaning of saint Paule ye shoulde hardly note that, for an vntruthe· S. Paule there nameth not religion, that is true, but that this worde godlynesse which saint Paule nameth comprehendeth not religion, as the Byshop saythe, that is your owne vntruthe.
But this matter is debated more at large, in the answere to your Counterblast chap.
where is shewed bothe by the Fathers and by your owne chiefe writers, that sainte Paule by this word godlynesse meant true religion.
Here ye set another blasing starre vpon these words that the Byshop sayth.
This woulde be noted with good aduisement that Sainte Paule himselfe sheweth playnely prosperitie amongste Gods people and true religion, to be the benefites and fruites in generall, that by Gods ordinance springeth from the rule and gouernement of Kings and Magistrats vnto the weale of the people.
This would be noted (say you) howe ye racke saint Paule: he nameth not religion at all, he dothe not attribute religion to the rule and gouernment of the ciuill Magistrat, but peace and tranquillitie only in godlynesse.
Ye durst not note this for an vntruth M. Stapleton, but for a racking or wresting, althoughe this is but your peeuish difference.
If he racke saint Paules meaning, he telleth an vntruth of saint Paule, although this dothe cleare the B. of racking also, that ye durste not playnely note and score it vp for an vntruth: yet as the B. saying is most true, so it nothing swarueth from the meaning of sainte Paule.
For a the B. proueth by Chrysostome, that by this worde godlynesse is meant religion, and the inwarde peace of the mynde and conscience, and not only the outward peace of the body.
So Saint Paule maketh these to bee the benefites, fruites and endes, that by Gods ordinaunce wee receyue from the rule and gouernement of kings and magistrates, in whiche saying S. Paule is not racked, but it is you M. Stapleton, that racke Saint Paule· for he sayth not tranquillitie and peace only in godlinesse, may put your only in your pursse, Saint Paule sayth in godlinesse and purenesse.
The whiche knot and fastening togither of religion and prosperitie inco~mon weales, the most Christian and godly Emperours Theodosius Ualentinianus did wisely foresee.
They sawe no suche confounding of the two functions spirituall and temporall as you imagine.
This vntruth is directed against the Byshops imagination, ye go verie neare the B. M. Stapleton, that where hée sayth no suche wordes as you chalenge, ye will créepe into his heart and fetche from thence, ye haue a goodeye sighte that can see what the B. imagineth.
But wisdome wil think this to bée a fonde toy of your own idle imagination, for the Byshops words import no such confusion as ye talke of, hée telleth howe godlynesse and prosperie are lincked togither in common weales, so that the one cannot be well without the other, that the Prince is the knitting togither of both these, and this he saythe the Emperours sawe, and that they saw it, he bringeth good proufe, theire own manifest words set downe at large: eyther proue this an vntruth M. Sta. or else the B. hath made nene, it is but your vntrue sclaunder fonde imagination.
That such like gouernment in Churche causes, as the Queenes Maiestie taketh vpon hir, dothe of duetie belong vnto ciuill magistrates.
Such like gouernement you haue not nor euer shall be able to proue.
The B. saith that in this first booke he hath hitherto proued it by the scriptures, the Doctours and some Emperoures.
This you denie that he hath done, and set him a long day to proue it.
Nowe the truth or vntruth of this the reader must hang in suspence til be haue read the prs ouer, what they bee, and then in the name of God lette himiudge, whether the vntruthe lyghte on the Byshoppe or on Master Stapleton.
In the meane season ytherto the Reader maye haue a taste, what shame is in this impudent mannes ace, what truthe in his cause, and what folly in hs heade, thus to the wide worlde to score and sette out suche thinges for vntruthes, as beeing neuer so little rypped vp, are moste apparante truthes, and to make suche a tryumphante gambolde, and pyping vp of a round as hee doth thereon.
But lete hym daunce his yll, and nicke vp still on the score, in the ende hée will runne so farre in the lashe, that no man will credite a worde of his mouthe.
lyer is not beleeued, no thoughe he svveare. [leaf motif]To Master Stapletons first Preface.
OR euer Master Stap· enter into his counterblast, he prefixeth two Prefaces, the first to the B. the second to the Reader.
The first, bicause it is only a packet, trussed vp, of all such accusations, as he layeth to the Bishops charge, through out his whole counterblast, and so is to be aunswered in their proper places, minde not therefore to follow Master Stapletons vaine, that saith, Decies repeta placebunt, to spende the time and trouble the Reader more than néedes in answering to them here, that are to be answered in their places seuerally, and are already many of them noted before, in his Common places.
The effect and conclusion of this preface, in the ende is this.
That the Bishop must néedes make a full reioynder, full reioynder say (saith he) and perfect to all and euery parte of this reply, and put in Master Stapleton whole answere, not omitting any one line or sentence either of the text or of the margine: or els the truth is not on the Bishops side, or els he wa~teth learnyng: or els he buildeth on no good fundation, nor the cause he groundeth on is sure, or els all men vvill laugh him to scorne, for his faire piece of vvorke so shamefully broken of, or els M. Feckenhams scruples are most learned and inuincible reasons, or els the othe can not be take~ with out manifest periurie, or els Master Horne must retract his most haighnouse heresies, or els (which should haue set before) all that the B. hath saide, is but vvoordes of course to saue his poore honestie, and but waltham talke, or els (as he obiecteth foolishnesse to the B.) so M. Stapleton may proue as wise as walthams calfe, and thus as he saith to the B. for this time take my leaue of you, Vale resipisce, so may for this your first Preface, take my leaue of you Master Stapleton, Uale sape. [leaf motif]To Master Stapletons seconde Preface.
THe seconde Preface is directed to the Reader, and is co~triued in thrée partes.
The first sheweth the reasons why he tooke vppon him to answere the Bishop.
The second how by what order he procéedeth in his answere.
The thirde is an earnest admonition to forsake this religion.
In the first parte he sheweth that Master Fekenham could not answere the B. him selfe, but he sheweth no other reason thereof, than this, seing his state is such.
Secondly, that the cause why he more than any other of his complices tooke vpon him to answere this, least it should appeare to come of his owne ambitious busiositie, was only at the request of some of his friends, he will not tell of whom, for so perhaps be might detect him selfe, to be a disciple of Balaa~s marke, hyred for lucre to curse with his cursed and blackmouthed Rhetorike, the Churche and truth of God.
And bicause hereby, be would haue the reader couertly to vnderstande, what kinne a great clerke he is, of what terrour to his enemies, and estimation among his friendes, to entreate him more than any of all the rest, to atchieue this enterprise: he telleth vs he was not very willing therto, bicause forsooth, he purposed hauing so largely prouoked suche sharpe aduersaries, especially M. Ievvell, for a season to rest and stande to his owne defence, if any would charge him.
Wherein he would not haue ye forget, what a lustie prouoker of sharpe aduersaries he is.
And although for two causes he was lothe to medle therewith, first for that many things in this booke pertaine to certaine priuate doinges betwixt M. Feckenham, and M. Horne, of the vvhich (saith he) had no skill: secondly for that a number of such priuate matters, touching the state of the realme occurred, as to them (vvithout farder aduice) could not throughly shape any ansvvere: yet notwithsta~ding all these thinges that neyther touched M. Stapleton, nor he had any skill of them, nor could shape any ansvvere to them, he must néedes intrude and busie him self, to shape some mishapen ansvvere, his fingers itched (since none of al his sharpe aduersaries would once deigne to answere him) to prouoke the B. in these things, and where his skill should faile, rather than his will should faile, he would furnish out his answere with his foresaide common places, in which he hath a very good skill and grace.
As for the residue of his wantes, aftervvarde it so hapned (saith he) that by suche as haue good cause to credite, there came to my knovvledge such instructions, as vvell for the one as for the other, that vvas better vvilling to employ some paines and studie in this behalfe.
How these instructions hapned to him, we must not vnderstande all, for feare it fall out (as they say) that asking his felow if he be a thee, two false companions néede no broker.
As it will feare me fall out Master Stapleton in the scanning of your false informations, whereof your selfe were vnskilfull ye saye, but ye haue good cause to credite them, were the more vvilling to employ your paines and studie therein, and good reason ye should credite them, that make any thing for you.
For why, they be credible men of your owne partie: be it true or false they tell you, recke not you, let them beare the blame, if they lie, you did but tell it for them.
Why should ye not therefore employ your paines, and studie, to painte it out, that the more willingly, since they do paie well for it.
Now Stapleton being wel instructed, though he promise to take the vvillinger paines and studie, in this behalf, yet must ye not presuppose, that he taketh this vpo~ him, for that (saith he) thinke my selfe better able than other, but for that vvould not it should seeme, there lacked any good vvill in me either to satisfie the honest desire of my friendes, or to helpe and releue such, as by suche kinde of bookes are already pitifully inuegled and deceaued, or to stay other yet standing, that this booke be not at any time, for lacke of good aduertisement a stumbling stocke vnto them.
What soeuer here M. Sta. ye pretende of your forward good will, who so co~ferreth here with your Co~mon place of boastings crakes, may easily returne your own saying on your selfe, that these are but vvordes of course to saue your poore honestie, least men should sée detest your ambitious vaine glory herein.
Neyther doth your preposterous zeale couer it any whit, except this be to helpe relieue a stu~bler, where scarce a straw laye in his waye before, to tumble a stocke into his path, to make him fall downe right.
Now that M. St. hath shewed the occasions that pricked him forward to set on the B.
Wherein first after his ordinarie crakings of his poore labour, of his diligence, of his vvhole and full replie he excuseth his long tediouse babling: vvherein rather feare (saith he) haue saide to much than to litle, which in déede he hath good cause to feare, as his Common places do shal declare.
And yet would he haue euery word put in replied vnto, him selfe in his owne co~science hauing sayd to much alreadie.
But to excuse this faulte he hath a sufficient reason at hande, that tediousnes is good to make al perfect, and therefore he had rather be tediouse than shorte.
Thus hauing handsomly excused the matter, he secondly sheweth the order of the Bishops booke.
M. Hornes ansvvere as he calleth it resteth in tvvo partes.
Why M. St. how call you it? may it not thinke you be called an answere, that answereth the demaunde or request of an other? but as you wrangle péeuishly about the name, so that curiouse fine pate of yours, disdeyneth the playn and simple name of an answere, or replie, or any other vsuall worde, as ye pretende, to auoyde confusion, but in déede, to shew some singuler conceite and excelle~cie of your booke, which so finely ye Entitle counterblaste, to say the truth a blast not worth a counter, to counterblowe and all to blast the Bishops answers with all.
The two partes that he deuides the Bishops booke into are these: In the first (saith he) and chiefest he playeth the opponent, laying forth out of the holy Scriptures both Olde and Nevve, out of Councels both generall and nationall, out of Histories Chronicles of all cou~tries, running his race fro~ Constantine the great, dovvne to Maximilian, great grandfather to the Emperour that novv liueth: taking by the vvay, the Kings of France, of Spaigne, and of our owne countrie of England, since the conquest, all that euer he coulde finde, by his ovvne studie and helpe of his friendes, partly for profe of the like gouernme~t of Princes in Ecclesiasticall causes, as the oth attributeth novv to the crovvne of Englande, partely for the disproofe of the Popes supremacie, vvhich the othe also principally extendeth to exclude.
In the seco~d and later parte, he playeth the defenda~t taking vpon him to ansvvere, and to satisfie certaine of M. Feck· argume~ts, and scruples of co~scie~ce, vvherby he is moued not to take the othe.
Hovv vvell he hath played both his partes· the perusall of this replie vvill declare.
Hovv vvell so euer he hath played his partes, full ilfauoredly, you begin to plaie yours M. Stap. thus to wrangle about the partes of opponent and answerer.
The B. playeth not the opponent, but you playe the Marchant.
The B. not in playe but in truth good earnest, (as M. Feckenham pretendeth to requireth to be satisfied) answereth to his requestes, by the foresayde proues that here ye confesse he bringeth forth.
The partie opponent (as in the other scruples) still is M. Feckenham.
But be he opponent or defenda~t (as either of the~ in respects, may be either) if he bring those proues that ye graunt he doth, ye haue litle occasio~ to make a playe scoffe at the matter.
Neither doth this blemish ye truth, fro~ whom he had it: wher with ye would séeme as it were with an awke blowe, to foyle the B. learning, that he founde out these prooues not all by his owne studie, but by the helpe of his friends.
Which as you M. Stapleton for your owne parte were faine to confesse right now, so is there no cause, ye should measure the Bishops knowledge by your owne defecte.
But herein ye do but as the residue do, this is the fashio~ of all your co~péeres.
Where truth faileth you· at the least, to winne a credite of learning to your selues, (like prowde Pharisies) ye dispise al other besides your selues.
To which purpose, as M. Stapl. would staine the Bishops godly and learned labour herein, at the least, that all might not séeme to be his owne, but gathered by others to his hands: so in the telling of his owne well ordered péece of worke, he setteth out euery point to the vttermost, to co~mende the better vnto vs, his great learning, industrie, and perspicuitie.
He telleth vs solemnly, how to the first parte, he replieth in three bookes, how he hath deuided eche booke into seuerall chapters, what he hath noted at the toppe of eche page.
But he telleth not what common places he hath set out in eche line.
He telleth how he hath exceedingly lightned the matter, and what recapitulations he hath made thereof.
To the second parte, he telleth vs it shall appeare (but when he telleth vs not) both what strong and inuincible arguments M. Feknam right learnedly proposed, as most iuste causes of his said refusall.
And also vvhat ely shiftes, and miserable escapes, M. Horne hath deuised, to maynteine that obstinately, vvhich he once conceaued erroneously.
And thus forsoothe, nothing to the prayse and setting forth of him selfe M. Feckenham, nor to the blemishing of his aduersarie, hath M. Stapleton deuided the content of the Bishops answere, and his counterblast thereto.
Now thinking with this preiudice of both their labours he hath sufficiently affectionate the Reader to his partie, thirdly he entreth into a generall fore warning of him, the effect whereof is to forsake this religion, which he beginneth with this earnest adiuring of him.
Novv good Reader (saith Master Stapleton) as thou tendrest thine owne saluation· and hopest to be a saued soule, in the ioyful and euerlasting blisse of heauen, so consider and vveigh vvith thy selfe the importaunce of this matter in hande.
What hope of saluation (M. St.) can the Popish doctrine bréede, that alwayes doubteth as much of damnation, as it hopeth of saluation, ha~geth wauering betwene dispayre hope, admitting no certentie of faith or trust to grou~de vpo~? The attenion that ye desire in the Reader, we as earnestly desire the same also, neither that he come to reade attentiuely, with any preiudicate opinion on either parte, as you would haue his minde foresalled on your side, but euen with indifferencie, as he shall finde the matter in hande to leade him, so to weigh and consider the importance thereof, euen as he tendreth and verely hopeth his ovvne saluation.
And as the Reader shall do this for his parte, so let vs sée how you do for yours, and of what great importance your arguments are, to sturre vp this earnest attention in the Reader.
Then if this Religion vvhereby thou hopest to be saued, haue no authoritie to grounde it selfe vppon, vvhat hope of saluation remayning in this religion canst thou receyue? Now as though the Maior were in controuersie, and the pointe we sticke vpon: he first solemnely strengthneth it with the authoritie of S. Augustine.
For no true religion saith S. Augustine, can by any meanes be receaued, vvithout some vvaightie force of authoritie.
As for the Minor which determineth nothing, but hanging on a conditionall pinne: maketh no directe conclusion too or fro.
We graunt him that our religion haue no authoritie, no hope of saluation can be grounded thereon.
But then he replieth: If it haue any authoritie, it hath the authoritie of the Prince, by vvhose supreme gouerment it is enacted, erected and forced vpon thee, other authoritie hath it none: Ergo, For want of sufficient good authoritie, it is no true Religion.
Ye desired right now M. St. euen as the Reader tendreth his ovvne saluation, to consider and vveighe vvith him self the importance of this matter.
And is this all the importance of your first argument against our Religion, that the Reader should weigh co~sider so déepely? What is here alleaged besides a bolde and manifest slaunder, forced vpon the Reader, by the authoritie onely of your bare woorde? Which the more the Reader shall consider, and especially thus your beginning, for an handsell of good lucke to the residue, he shall the better perceaue the falshood and impudencie of your whole cause dealing.
For, to set one If, against another, If the reader better co~sidering weighing with himself, shal finde this religio~, not to be of so late enacting, erecting, forcing, but enacted, erected and forced of God in his holy woorde, shall not this co~sideration detect you to be a malicious slau~derer? if the reader with al shall vveigh the peise of your argument, that the Prince hath a supreme gouernment in all Ecclesiasticall causes: Ergo, the Religion that the Prince sets forth hath noe other authoritie but of him, shal be not finde it like the father of it, as light as a thing of nought? But, exhorting the Reader to vveigh and consider the matter, not considering nor vveighing what ye say your selfe, ye blunder on in your Ifs, and say: If then that supreme gouernment (that hauing none other authoritie, enacteth, erecteth and forceth a Religion vpon thée) be not due to the laie Prince, but to the spirituall Magistrate, and to one chiefe Magistrate among the vvhole spiritualtie, thou eest thy Religio~ is but a bare name of religion, and no religion in deede.
Here whether he be ashamed to set it downe, or thinketh it so cléere it néedeth not recital, but is inferred of the Maior he leaueth out ye Minor of his argume~t.
But, that supreme gouernment is due to one chiefe spirituall magistrate only, and to no lay Prince.
Ergo: Thy religion, is no religio~ in deede, but a bare name therof.
The reader, thanks be to God, were he but a simple clerke, néede not greatly beate his braynes in considering the vvaight of this argument.
The maior is hanged vp for holidayes, on your conditional pin.
The whole in effect standeth on these two false urmised principles, presupposing the prince to take suche supreme gouernement on him, as the Pope chalengeth, and that suche as the Pope chalengeth is due to the Pope, to make, infringe or alter religion, without any other authoritie, which indéede is neyther due to Prince or prelate, but to God alone, nor the prince but the popeclaymeth it, and therefore his argument maketh only against the popes religion, as thus: To enact, erect, or force religion vpon thee, yther of spirituall or lay magistrate whosoeuer, by their, or his supreme and other authoritie for it, hath none, is to make in deed no religion at all, but a bare name of religion onely: But that thus doth the Pope, as (besides that it is manifest) euen here M. Stap. plamely confesseth, saying that supreme gouernment (making relation to the wordes immediately precéeding, vvhich supreme gouernement enacteth, erecteth, and forceth religion vppon thee hauing no other authoritie) is due to the spirituall magistrate, and to one chiefe magistrate, among the vvhole spiritualtie, meaning his holy father the pope: Ergo: The popes religion is a bare name of religion onely and no religion in deede.
And thus his owne argument better considered, returneth on him selfe.
But he béeyng blinded with the affection of his false principles, and reasoning petitione princip· runneth on with his from the religion to the othe, to inferre peririe.
Againe (sayth he) if this supreme gouernement be not rightly attributed to the lay magistrate, in vvhat state are they, vvhich by booke othe doe svveare that it ought so to be, yea and that in their consciences they are so persvvaded.
Is not periurie, and speciallye a vvilfull continuance in the same, a most horrible damnable crime, in the sight of god? and doth not gods vengeance vvatch ouer them vvhich sleepe periurie· vvill be a quicke vvitnesse to periured persons sayth God by the Prophete Malachie.
He that heard you preach thus against periurie M. St. knewe ye not, might thinke ye were not guiltie.
But if he better co~sidered your periured case, obstinate disobedience agaynst your Prince, how wilfully ye continue and sleepe therin, and maliciously slaunder your prince countrimen, and wrest the oth of set purpose.
he woulde surely maruell of your impuden If this supreme gouernment (say you) be not rightly attributed to the lay magistrate, in vvhat state are they, vvhich by boke oth do sweare that it ought so to be? What is this supreme gouernment M. St. that ye speak of? If ye say, that which specied before, to were, that which erecteth, enacteth, and forceth religion vpon thee, without any other authoritie therof what is this but one of your impudent slau~ders? For though your pope taketh this supreme gouernme~t, you giue it him, yet neither we attribute this to the prince, nor the prince taketh any such vpo~ neither do ye people sweare it ought so to be, nor any such oth is tendred them, therfore be in no such state of periury.
The oth that the prince offreth the people take, nameth nor conteyneth any such supreme gouernme~t, but such as they may lawfully ought to take, thanks be to god, incurre no such dau~ger, but performe therin their dutifull true obedience.
But in what state are you (to set another if to yours, the supreme gouernment, that ye lay magistrate (as ye saucily cal the Quéenes maiesty) requireth by oth be rightly attributed vnto hir highnes, in what state the~ are all those papists that obstinately disobey, maliciously slau~der, by al meanes impugue the same? are you not in the state of periurie, or farre worse? in what state be al you papists, that where the oth to this supreme gouernme~t which ye speak of, implieth (as you co~clude) manifest periury, and you plainely ascribe it to the Pope, the Pope sweareth you other his vassals to it, is not this periurie (especially a vvilful co~tinuance in the same) a most horrible damnable crime in the sight of God, and doth not Gods vengeance vvatch ouer them vvhich sleepe in periurie? vvill bee a quicke vvitnesse to periured persons sayth God by his prophet Malachie.
And therfore looke your selfe to this your chalenge better about ye M. St.
For if the reader should vveigh it further, as ye pretende, feare me, further matter will fall out agayst ye.
But for all this M. St. will not stay, but on he goeth still with his iffs, and reuerseth his arguments on the contrary, reasoning on this his condition absurdo.
If that supreme gouernment may duly rightly appertein to our liege souereigne, or be any principall part of a princes roial povver, as master Horne stoutly but fondly auoucheth, or of his eruice to God, vvhich neuer prince in the realme of England before the dayes of K. Henry the
vsed or claimed, vvhich neuer Emperour, king, or prince vvithout the realm of England yet to this present houre had or atte~pted to haue· vvhich the chief masters of the religion novv authorised in England do mislike, reproue condemne, namely Martin Luther Iohn Philip Melanction and the Magdeburgens, as in place co~uenient haue shevved, vvhich also in no time or age since princes vvere first christned, in no lande or cou~try, in no councel general or national, was euer vvitnessed, practised, or allowed: last of all, which directly fighteth vvith christs co~mission giue~ to the apostles their successors in the gospel, standeth direct co~trary to an article of our crede: if such supreme gouernme~t (I say) may be lavvful good, the~ is the oth lavvful, and may vvith good conscience be taken.
But if these be such absurdities as euery man of any consideration seeth and abhorreth, then may not the othe of any man that hath a conscience bee taken.
Neyther can this supreme gouernment be possiblye defended for good and lavvfull.
Upon iffs and affs ye may conclude M: Stap. what ye please.
This one pin, f, will beare all this light stuffe that that ye hang vpon it well inough.
What man, and if, the skie fall we shall haue Larkes they say.
Ye recken vp many particulers, if, this be thus, and if, that be so, and if the other thing be that: and suche be good, and if these he suche: but if this be not thus, if that be not so, if such be not these, if these be not such: then say then, that that is not this, and this is not that, and so ye conclude it makes no matter what.
For of all your solemne arguing to and fro, ye lay downe in déede many particulers, but neither to nor fro ye proue any one, so that he that woulde rebate them againe particulerly, might as easily improue them all, if with a contrarie if, he denie them euery one.
And if it be so say you, then. c. and if it be not so maye be say, so then and so, vera vice.
And what is this but mockholiday with the reader, whome ye desire to marke you so attentiuely, and here is no proofe at all to marke.
Besides that, all these iffs stande on your former wrong principle, (that supreme gouernement) and may be all answered with one if, if not the prince in déede, but your pope, claymeth that supreme gouernment, then the othe from the prince, as clayming another maer of supreme gournement, is frée from all these absurdities, and they onely light on your popes pate, that exacteth the same.
And so must they stande by your owne confession, till ye proue that supreme gouernment, and these absurdities to make against the prince.
Yes say you that do for it followeth immediately, That al these absurdities and manie yet more, vvhich to auoyde prolixitie here omitte, do hereof depende: this replie gentle reader, abundantly proueth.
Whie? is this proofe ynough M. St. hauing made so solemne and full a conclusion agaynst our religion, the princes supreme gouernment, and the othe, and will, your reader as he hopeth his saluation, to marke howe ye proue the importance of your matter: And hauing alledged many bitter things, when you should come to the proofe of any one thing, to prooue nothing, but onely tell him proue it in your replie? and clawing him with the smooth title of (gentle reader) do ye thinke he can be so satisfied? Now srely then he might be a gentle reader, but he should not be a verye wise reader, that woulde thinke this were ynough, to answere the hope of his saluation.
But ye say ye omit the declaration of the proues here to auoyde prolixitie.
Why auoyde ye not then here, such prolixitie also, in making your solemne conclusions, and reserue them (as were more couement) to their conuenient places, where ye saye ye haue shewed them? What néede ye néedelesy babble of them here? or whie maye not reiecte the answere of them to the place of answere which ye referre vs vnto? and there a gos name let the reader vveigh them.
In the meane season answere, if, with if, if nothing hereof be hitherto proued ut is to be proued hereafter in your replie, then for any absurditie here concluded, the othe is to be taken, the princes supreme gouernment is good and lawfull, and your owne arguments fond kind of reasoning, to conclude simplie on co~ditionals, to auoid prolixitie by long vain babling, to craue the readers diligent vveying, and to bring no proofe the vveight of a straw, these are the most absurdities that the reader as yet can finde.
The like are your vaine crakes, that ye beare he reader in hand withall, how ye haue euidently proued the primaie of the B. of Rome, not only in England before and since the conquest, but throughout all Christendome, as well the east as the vvest Church, euen by the authours to the contrarye, and howe ye haue proued the first general councels, many nationall besides, in Spaine, Fraunce, and Germanie And nothing is pronounce the~ the princes supreme gouernment in matters ecclesiastical.
And here breathing your self, as though you all in as ye beast, it is nov thy part you) not to shut thine eies against the truth so clearely shining before thy face.
What soft M. St. the Sun shineth not in your Hemisphere as yet: Ye are earely vp neuer the nearer.
Ye haue told the reader his dutie alredie, to vveigh co~sider vvith himself the importance of the matter in hand as he hopeth to be a saued soule, tendreth his owne saluation.
This is a sore coniuration, and requires yt he be not moued lightly, with any preiudice or affection, nor caried about with euery wind, on credite of your word.
Soft a while, till he shall sée these things ye boast of, they are not yet in hand, when they shal come to hand, then giue him leaue to trie view them, what side he shall find the truth to shine clearely before his face, to that part he should open his ies, his eares, and hart also, and shut them to that partie that he shal find loue darknesse, can not abide the cleare shining beames of the truth to lighte~ direct him.
But as though ye had woon the reader already, and had determined before hand which is the truth: Against the vvhich truth (say you) bicause master Hornes ansvvere, is but as it vvere a vaine blast, the confutation of that ansvvere to auoide confusion of replies (vvherof so many and diuers haue of late come forth) haue termed for distinction sake a Cou~terblast.
Whatsoeuer the B. answere is, the readers attention hitherto séeth nothing in you, but vaine wordes, and a vaine title of a vaine booke to come, as he maye hitherto iudge, procéeding of a vaine head, to shewe a finer vaine than your fellowes haue.
Your fetch is in this your vainglorious title, to gyrde at the B. name, whereat diuerse tymes ye lykewise scoffe, as though an other oulde not descant a like on yours.
But this vaine dealing, as it may perhaps delight oad on, such as your selfe (and yet erchaunce, the indignitie of your behauiour, against, though your aduersarie, yet farre your better, and your mlapert arrogancy, in aduauncing of your selfe, may lose ye some credite with other your friendes) nothing the Bishopp, nor impeaceth the cause that the B. defo~deth: so the idifferent reader betwene both, reading both, will no doubt regard more the force or weaknesse of your arguments, than estéeme the iolitie of your fresh title, or feare ye boysterousnesse of your Counterblast, so conferring the one with the other, will iudge as he findeth cause.
Neither wil the aduised reader be moued wt your flattry, saying.
And novv gentle reader most earnestly besech thee of all other articles that be this day ouer all christe~dom co~trouersious, through the great temeritie of selfe vvilled heretiks raised vp, most dilige~tly to labor and trauail in this of the supremacie, as being such, that to say the truth· in effect all other depend vpo~.
You besech the reader so M. St. that he shold do but well to grau~ your vown.
How be it there are many other articles of lesse co~trouersie betwene vs, his day, far more subtile dau~gerous.
Neuertheles, it shalbe necessary for the reader, most dilige~tly to labor trauail in this of the supremacie, as a mother in déede to ye most of your popish errors, so ye reader shal espie, your selfe to be one of those self vvilled heretiks.
And yt for al your earnest beseching him to trauell most herein, ye would haue him either beleue first, ground him self, on your false principles: or else would ye se beshrew him, for traueling one whit therin, and fal as fast to besech him, to let the matter alone, except he wil before hand on your word, beleue yt this supreme gouernme~t belongeth to your pope.
And hauing so gotte~ his grau~t on this, which is ye co~trouersie it selfe, the~ ye besech the gentle reader most diligently to labor trauell in this controuersie.
But the reader may sée, with no great trauell for y^ matter, yt as ye etract your duty fro~ your prince, so ye ascribe a great deale to much to your pope.
For, where to win the reader to your partie, ye say that all controuersies in effect depend vpon this: Ergo admit this, admit al: deny this, deny al: the antecedent in déed in your popish church is true, Where they make al articles of religio~ to depend vpo~ him.
But in christs church it is true of none other but of christ alone.
Upon who~ being ye corner sone rock, al ye building is fou~ded, ariseth, in who~ being ye only chiefe vniuersal hd, all the members haue lyfe, all controuersies in effect depe~d.
But it is not so of any limited and secondarie head, or supreme gouernour in any particuler Churche of Christians.
That all articles, or any article of fayth dependes on the Princes gouernement, but the Princes gouerneme~t depends on them, to ouersee them duetifully set foorth.
And when the Reader séeth this, that the Prince claymeth not an absolute Supreme gouernement, and that it is your Pope onely, that taketh this absolute Supromacie on him, and you that giue it him: then trust the reader will not be so wonne with your fayre words, which make fooles fayne, as he wil abhorre your slaunders on your Soueraigne, and detest the open iniurie ye offer to Chryst the onely head, to make all Articles depende on your Popes supreme authoritie.
Nowe whereas for this ambitiouse clayme of your Pope, ye alleage here nothing to fortifie the same: ye thinke ye shall winne it, yet at the least this way, if with dispitefull raylings, ye may beforehande discredite vs to the Reader, and so winne credite to your selfe thereby.
Ye argue thus: The Protestantes (whom odieusly and falsly ye deuide into many sects) are at mutuall and mortall enemitie among them selues, but al conspire agaynst the primacie of ye Pope, Ergo a good resolution once had in this poynt stayeth and setleth the conscience, as vvith a sure and strong anker from the insurgies and tempests of all sects and schismes.
This argument might as well make for Mahomets religion, or any other neuer so false, as for the Popes: to reason from the aduersaries diuision among them selues, or agréement of them selues agaynst his religion: to a truthe and perfection in his false religion.
And thoughe the argument faile alike bothe in the Pope and the Turke, yet it holdeth in Christes primacie. and onely in him, agaynst Pope, Turke, Sectarie, or any other deuided from him.
Chiefly agaynst the Popish church, wherin are diuers infinite sects errours, and al at mutuall and mortall enmitie amongst them selues, and yet all conspire with the Pope agaynst Christ and his truth: Ergo, a good resolution once had in Christ his truth, stayeth and setleth the conscience, as with a sure and strong anker from the insurgies and tempests of all sects and schismes.
This argument thus framed, had bene better and truer, and not to make the Popes supremacie, or the exalting of any creature in heauen or earth, to be the anker holde and stay of our consciences, besides Christ and his truthe.
Which sithence all Papistes do, by this your confession, they can haue no good resolution, resoluing them selues amisse, leaning to a broken Réede.
Where they say, Pax, pax, peace peace, non est pax impijs dicit dominus, there is no peace of conscience at all, nor any sure ankerholde to stay vnto.
And therefore if Protestants, yea al Sectaries or Schismatikes, though they can not agrée amongst them selues, yet if they all hate thys moste Antichristian doctrine, to grounde their faythe on man: no meruayle though they hate it, it is so wicked and detestable, that euen good and badde, and all abhorre it.
After he hath taken this pro confesso, that the anker holde of conscience, consisteth in setling him selfe on the Popes primacie, he reasoneth on the contrarie effecte.
Contrary vvise, they that be once circumuented and decea ued in this Article, are carryed and tossed vvith the raging vvaues and flouds of euery errour and heresie, vvithoute stay or setling, euen in their ovvne errours.
True in déede, Master Stapleton if ye had rightly shewed withall, what it had bene to be circumuented and deceyued in this Article, otherwyse ye doe but lyke an vnskilfull and harebrayned Pilote herein, that to auoyde the rocke, thinketh him selfe sure and safe, when he hath caste hys anker on the quickesandes, or rather euen in the goulfes mouthe, and so warrant him also (as you saye) he shall not néede long to feare to bée caryed and tosted wyth the insurgies and tempestes of the ragyng waues and flouddes, but soone be swalowed vp and drowned in them.
But Master Stapleton not considering, or not mynding to warne the reader of this to much trusting to a false Pilote, but to terrify him further wyth feare of forsakyng this Popishe ankerholde, and to confirme thys argument of the contrarie effecte, reasoneth from the instancies of dyuers ensamples.
The Grecians forsooke the vnitie of the romaine Church: Ergo they fell after to be Arrians, Macedonians, Nestorians, Eutichians, &c. and in conclusion fell into the Turkishe captiuitie.
This argument besides other faultes, hath chiefly two hoamely and foule fallations, that make it vcious.
The one secundum quid ad simpliciter, from the Churche of Rome, limitted to that tyme that it was not stayned with those errours, to the Churche of Rome simplie, that since that time hath falne it selfe, partlye into some of those errours, partly into other as great, and many worse.
The seconde fallacion is non causa vt causa: for theyr fall was into those heresies, not bicause they acknowledged not the Bishop of Rome, to be their supreme heade, for therein they had played like the Flownder, that lept out of the frying panne into the fire: but bicause they forsooke and peruerted the worde of God, as the Papists since haue done, and their ares itched and aiended to the inuentions, doctrines, errors of men, to lying masters, as the papists haue done also.
This was the proper cause of their fall into these errors, and of the Papists fal, into the like or greater.
And where M. St. ioyneth to his conclusion, to make the sequele more dreadfull, that after diuerse reconciliations with the Romaine Sea, they fell into the Turkish captiuitie: Why may it not as well be noted thereon, that they neuer came into this extreme flanery of the Turke, but their Empire continued aboue
yeares, till after those their reconciliatio made with the Pope? then within
From the Gréek and ast Church he procéedeth to the Affricanes, making the like argument on them.
But to answere him briefly: To reason thus, from the vnitie of the Romaine Sea, in fayth then, to the obedience of the Romaine Sea, in the supremacie nowe, euery scholer will some say, is a very good non seqtur.
The like common fallace non caus vt caus, he maketh of Hungarie and Lifelande, fallen into the handes of the Turkes and Moscouites.
Bicause (sayth he) they forsooke the Pope, and fell to Luther.
But if this argument be good, demaunde of him, how the hodes, Belgradum, Buda, and other cities and parts in Austria which likewise the Turk hath gotten, be cleane forgetten here of him, and not reckened vp in this number? was it bicause they acknowledged, none more than the Rhodians, the Popes supremacie? and yet fell into the Turkishe captiuitie so well as the other? At the length he home to Englande, and when he should here make the full conclusion of all these lamentable sequeles, of reolt from the Romaine Sea, in other Countreyes, that the lyke shoulde lyghte on vs: séeyng that his argumente, contrarie to hys long and wycked hope, doeth fayle in the conclusion: least eyther hée shoulde shewe the follie of hys impertinent argumentes, or vtter the vnnaturall malice, that for his Pope and popishe religion, he hath fostred long in his cankred breast agaynst his naturall prince and Countrey: he turneth the Catte into the Panne, not by concluding hys argument on the lyke issue to Englande, but rawly and generally knitteth vp the matter thus: But vvhat vvas the issue all the vvorlde knovveth, and Englande, the more pitie, greeuously feeleth.
To this M. Stap answere: Thanks be giuen to God, no suche isue, as you would conclude of other Countreys, from errors and the Turke to vs.
It is you that abhorring the Gospell more than Turkerie, feele this gréefe ye speake of, for that your sequele holdeth no better in Englande.
Englande neither feareth the Turkes, nor these your byous threates, and would to God no parte of Christendome, euen of those that you accounte moste Popishe catholike, were no more subiecte to the inuasion and daunger of the Turkishe, barbarous, and Sarains irruptions and tyrannie, than Englande: is and yet if God shoulde punishe any parte of Christendome by them, though he vse by his secret Iustice, their furie, as a rodde to scourge their offences, yet will not we, nor may iustly, make suche tragicall sequeles, reasons to argue pro or contra on Religion, as here you doe by these peoples, to conclude agaynst vs.
Englande euer since that, through the Quéenes most excellent maiestie, it hath enioyed the libertie of Gods moste holy worde, hath mager all your spites, reioyced withall, bothe tranquillitie, wealth, peace, fréedome, and aboue all things, the fauour of God in Christ, euen for that it hath escaped the spirituall bondage of your Pope, farre worse than the bodily captinitie of the Turke, God continue his mercy to vs, and make vs thankfull for it.
Nowe since ye can not fasten any such sequele as ye wishe on Englande, ye gather petite quarels, and like a poher, seeke corners to finde out some inconueniences, not worthy answere.
And yet bicause ye resume them often times after, and make muche ado about them, as reading the Byble and other books, suppressing Abbeys, marriage of Priests, oirginitie, vovves, no Church Byshops, but Parliament Byshops, the sacrament of the altare. &c. they are answered, where ye handle them at large, and not here whereye snatch at them.
Onely this your grosse lie, will note here, about king Henries lawes.
Ye say, that after his death and in the minoritie of his sonne king Edvvarde, all the lavves that he had made touching matters of religion (sauing against the supremacie) vvere repelled and abolished: What a manifest and impudent lie is this? King Henrie besides the supremacie, made lawes for the abolishing of shrines and pilgrimages, of pulling downe Images, of depressing popish sectaries, Monks, Friers, Numies, Heremits, Anachores. &c.
Were these lawes repelled and abolished after his death in the minoritie of king Edwarde? Shewe it, or else wipe your lippes, for a foule lie hath beslabbered them Master Stap.
All these former arguments and these extrauagant discourses consist on a wrong principle.
All this haue spoken (sayeth he) to shevve it is most true, that haue sayde, that there vvill neuer be redresse of error and heresie, or any stay, vvhere men are once gone from the vnitie of the Sea Apostolike, vvhich is the vvell spring and fountaine of all vnitie in the Catholike fayth.
This false principle if we denie it him, then all his arguments of absurdities, and euents theron, are not worth a rush.
But had he put in but one letter more, and for vnitie had sayd vanitie, it had bene a most true principle, nor we woulde or coulde haue euer denyed the same.
The last reason of his Preface to leaue a pricke of discredite agaynst the Protestants in the readers minde, is of our discorde and inconstancie in this question, the assumption whereof being in déede nothing but slaunders, of the prince, the Realme, and diuerse Godly learned men, is partly sette out in his common place of slaunders, and partlye shall be further particulerly aunswered, as they come to hande in the booke where he discourseth on them.
Thus much for the pithe of all his argumentes, conteyned in hys Preface to the Reader, to winne hys minde to hys cause before hande, and alienate it from ours: but the wyse Reader wyll first reade, or euer he giue his iudgement.
The answere to M. St. Counterblast on the Bishops Preface.
IN his answere to the B. Preface, whereas the Bishop in the first Deuision (for so.
M. Stapleton termeth euery seuerall portion that he answereth vnto) sheweth the necessarie reasons that moued him to answere Master Feckenhams booke, and the couert meaning of master Feckenham, in secretly scatering his booke abroade: that therein he shewed a further meaning than he durst plainely vtter, and that the intent of the booke as might iustly be gathered, was to engraft in ye mindes of the subiects a misliking of ye Q. maiestie as though she vsurped a power and authoritie in ecclesiasticall matters, whereto she had no right: to slaunder the whole realme as though it were estraunged and directly agaynst the Catholike Church, tenouncing and refusing to haue communion therewith, and vnder the B. name to deface the ministers of the Church, that therfore he could not but of dutie shape M. Fec. an answere.
To this M. St. omitting the B. motiues, laboureth like a clearkly proctour for his client, to purge M. Feck. for the setting forth of his booke, and accuseth the B. of false surmising, laying to the B. charge his first two vntruthes which are answered in their proper Kalender.
The clearing of Master Feckenham he deuideth into thrée partes.
First whie M. Feckenham made this booke, or as he calleth it a Shedule, or little treatise.
Thirdlye, whye hée afterwardes caused the same to bée publyshed and deliuered to some of the councell.
But first whatsoeuer he wil set downe for master Feckenham, whom he calleth the reuerent father my lord Abbot of VVestminster, bicause him selfe hath no knowledge hereof, but by hearesay, all that he declareth he buildeth on this grou~d, as assuredly vnderstand.
Now who gaue him thus assuredly to vnderstande, a man may easily deuine, euen forsooth this reuerent father, who as we must vnderstande with all, would tell M. Stap· nothing that should be partiall to himselfe in his owne case.
We must therefore beléeue that all is true that Master St. telleth of Master Feckenham, for assuredly master Feck. his own self, no worse man hath let him so to vnderstand.
The drift of all this first deuision is to chalenge the B. of vntruthes, which is answered into, the boderoll, as before and therefore is but superfluous to repeate it.
THe B. in the seconde deuision of his Preface declareth by what maner of proufes in this answere, he satisfieth maister· Feckenhams demaunde, by the scriptures, by the Doctors, by the cou~cels, and by the Churches practise.
And that euen by some such authors as themselues are, papists, and in this matter partiall to the Pope.
The first part is nothing else but an heape onely of slaunders, and bragges.
The seconde is a setting vp of markes before his counterblast, for the reader to direct himselfe vnto, wherby to sée who swarueth from, who kéepeth him niest, to the question in controuersie.
The thirde is a quarrelling with the B. for saying that he brought foorth proufes euen of the papists them selues.
The first part is set out in hys common places thereon, whereto, howbeit his slaunders and bragges be very lauishe, there néede no furder answere.
In the seconde, remembring at the length himselfe, that he hath hitherto spoken nothing materiall to the question, after his facinges, he saith: VVherfore as it is meee in all matters, so is it here also conuenient and necessarie, to haue before thine eyes good Reader, the state and principall question controuersed betvvene the parties standing in variance, and then diligently to see hovv the proofes are of eche partie applied, for the confirming of their assertions.
This is very good and necessarie councell that here ye giue the Reader M. Stap. and it had bene to be wished, your selfe had eyther in time remembred it, or not forgot it so soone againe.
But ye would not remember it of purpose, for had ye set this rule alwayes before your eyes, and (as ye should) haue followed your owne precept, ye well foresawe, what a leane carrion Pamphlet, your puft vp Counterblast should haue ben, lookyng with a thinner payre of chéekes by thrée deales and more, than it dothe.
Neuerthelesse wishe, as you do, the Reader still to marke this rule, and he shall sée it is no good fatte nor sounde fleshe, but foggy winde, that this whole Counterblast is bolne and swolne vp with all.
Now hauing this warning of his owne mouth, to haue still before our eyes the state and principall question of the booke, and thereby to sée hovveche parties proues are applied, let vs see how here he sets it downe before his owne eyes, and applies his proues thereto.
What the state and principall question is betvveene the parties (M. Feckenham, and the B. of Winchester) standing in variance, Looke M. Feckenhams owne woordes, desiring therein to be resolued.
VVhether any such gouernment in Spirituall or Ecclesiasticall causes as the Queenes Maiestie claymeth, may be proued by any of these foure meanes, the Scripture, the Doctours, the Councels, or the continuall practise of any one Church of Christendome.
On this state being demaunded to be proued or improued, standeth the principall point in variance betvveene these twaine.
This M. Feckenham earnestly calleth vpon, and offereth readily to sweare, if this by any of these foure partes can be proued.
This, the B. of Winchester laboreth directly to proue, and fully hath proued euen by all foure partes, vnlesse you can disprooue his proues.
And this now is your principall parte M. St. alwayes while ye labour to confute him, to haue set and fixed your eyes on this point, being the issue, the state and principall question betvveene these tvvaine in variance.
And to shew wherein the Bishop swarues from this, or makes any defect herein.
And not to looke vpon other so many impertinent matters (as your Co~mon place thereon declares your vagaries) nor to stande so long on them, nor to prie and poare out new starting holes, nor direct the eye of your reader to a wrong marke, point out a new butte, to the which whe~ your aduersarie directly shooteth not, but to the issue couenanted betweene them twaine, desired of the one to be shotte vnto, shotte vnto fully hitte of the other, and then you like a bootie ayme giuer, to crie out as ye do, that he shooteth vvide and shorte, co~meth not nere the marke by a
miles: Ye are a false ayme giuer M. Stap. all the world may sée, withall, how, when ye sée the marke is hit at the full euery time, ye haue no other shifte but this, to denie that to be the marke set vp.
But now let vs sée how properly your selfe shoote at the marke, and set before your eyes the state of the question in variance betvveene them twayne.
If ye starte away therefro~ hauing now saide thus much, ye quite shame your selfe and your cause.
Looke to it therfore, play the good archer shoote you néerer, hit the marke, to winne the B. shotte ye can.
But howe ye beginne to wrangle euen at the first entrie, and swarue from your owne principle, to set before your eyes the principall state in variance betvveene them, whiche (saye you) is conuenient and necessarie.
Nay, say you, ye shall first graunt me sixe thinges, and when ye haue graunted them, then will enter into this matche with you, and shew how ye euer shot amisse, and so beate you out of the felde.
Is this euen dealing M. St. to demaunde sixe things at once to be graunted? What? will not one, two, or thrée serue your turne? ye are to gredie, man, remember that qui cupit totum perdit totum.
But let vs sée your sixe demaundes, whether they be reasonable, and to be graunted yea or no.
There are therefore say you many thinges to be considered, first that Christ lefte one to rule his vvhole Churche in his steade from time to time vnto the ende of the vvorlde.
Is this your first request to be considered and graunted M. Stapleton? now surely a reasonable demaund to be considered vpon: And woorthie to haue that Salomon graunted to Adonias, for asking of Abisag to wife.
Wise king Salomon saw he might aswell haue asked the crowne from his head, yea his head from his shoulders: and who so vnwise that seeth not, ye might aswell aske the whole controuersie to be graunted you, and graunt ye this, what néede ye propounde your other principles following.
How be it let vs sée what they be also.
Secondly we muste consider (ye say) that this one vvas S. Peter the Apostle, and novv are the Bishops of Rome his successours.
Out of doubt ye had on some great considering cppe M. Stapleton, when you considered that the Bishop should haue considered this.
He was much to blame he considered it not, but M. Stapl. and ye were as wise as God might haue made you, ye would haue better co~sidered with your selfe, than to thinke others haue so litle consideration, as to graunt ye this your false and foolishe principle.
Thirdly (say you) that albeit the Bishop of Rome had no such vniuersall gouernment ouer the vvhole, yet that he is and euer vvas the Patriarche of Englande and of the vvhole VVest Church, and so hath as much to do here as any other Patriarche in his Patriarchshippe.
It is a signe (M. Stap·) ye shrewdly doubte the former twains woulde neuer be graunted, that so soone would be content to become a Patriarche of a piece, from a Pope of the whole: which though it sheweth lesse haughtinesse in you, that would play small game, rather than sit out, yet perchance your Pope is of Alexanders spirite, to whome Darius hauing offred halfe his dominions, if were Alexander ({quod} Parmenio) would take it, so would ({quod} Alexander) if were Parmenio: And so perchance your Pope will say to you, if were Master Stapleton, would be content at least to be a Patriarche, and perchance a worse rowme woulde serue.
But beyng the Bishop of Rome he will say, Aut Papa aut nihil.
And therefore least ye get his curse, before ye aske our consent, the surest way were to know how he will like of this your limitation, and when he shalbe content, then propose it to vs to consider thereon.
But see ye like not greatly to stande hereon, for fourthly say you.
Then all vvere it, that he had nothing to intermedle vvith vs, nor as Pope, nor as Patriarche, yet can not this supremacie of a ciuill Prince be iustified.
VVhereof he is not capable, especially a vvoman, but it must remayne in some spirituall man.
Your must is very mustie M. Stapl. and smelleth of the pumpe of Romes ship.
Your Sequence is as badde: the B. of Rome neyther as Pope nor as Patriarche is supreme gouernour in Ecclesiasticall causes in England: Ergo, No ciuill Prince man or woman is capable of it.
Againe: There must be one spirituall man that must haue an vniuersall gouernment ouer the whole Churche: Ergo· ciuill Prince may haue no particuler gouernement in his particuler Churche.
For neither hath the Pope, as Pope or Patriarche, or any otherwise, any supreme gouernement ouer Englande, as you presuppose he had none, and yet the Prince both may haue, and hath some supreme gouernement ouer vs.
For in déede all supreme gouernement, suche as the Pope vsurped, she neither hath, nor may haue, nor requireth, nor belongs to any creature, but is due to Christ alone.
He is that spirituall man, that your other antecedent speaketh of, if ye meane him, it is true: if you meane any other, it is but your false presupposall, though the consequentes whereon we stande, followeth neither way, neither doe ye laboure once to proue them.
But is here all things we muste consider? no say you, for fiftly, Besides this, the Catholikes say, that as there vvas neuer any such president heretofore in the catholike Church, so at this present there is no suche, excepte in Englande, neither among the Lutherans, the Suinglians, the Suenkfeldians, or Anabaptists, or any other secte that at this day raygneth, or rageth in the vvorlde.
None of these, say, agnyse their ciuill Prince, as supreme gouernour in al causes spirituall and temporall.
Let goe these raging termes of sectes, M. Sta. to their common places, and pray ye tell vs once agayne, who sayth thus? Who? euen the Catholikes say so.
Then gentle M. Stap. haue me commended to those your Papisticall Catholikes, that ye say, say so, and aske them agayne if all be Gospell that they do say, or no.
Tushe man, (will Stap. replie) will ye not beléeue the Catholikes? Why then sixtly and Laste of all saye, and M. Feck. vvill also say, that euen M. Horne him selfe in this his aunsvvere, retreateth so farre back from his assertion of supreme gouernement in all causes spirituall and temporall, vvhiche is the state and keye of the vvhole question, that he plucketh from the Prince the chiefe and principall matters and causes ecclesiasticall, as vve shall hereafter playnely shevve by his ovvne vvordes.
But syr, might a man be so bolde to aske your mastership, what are you and M. Feck are ye not Catholikes? that when ye haue saide the catholikes say so, ye come rushing in say, Last of all say, and M. Feck. vvill also say, you make vs doubte least ye be no Catholikes, and withall to suspect (when ye cal your selfe and your client M. Feck. to witnesse,) some partialitie in your sayings, least the sole will holde with the shoe: and that as two false witnesses came in agaynst our sauiour Christ, with say so, and he vvill say so also, so woulde you compact togither to slander the B. herein, with, say so, and M. Feck. vvil say so also.
But by both your leaues, may be so bolde as to set your, say so, and his, say so also, asyde, and desire ye to proue your so saying.
Why say you, doubt ye of that? we shall here after plainly shevve it by hys owne vvordes.
These are but vvords M. Stap. and ioly promises, if ye can shevve it so playnly, why shevve ye it not playnly here, where ye say it so playnly? or else haue shevved at the least, where the B. doth thus? which till ye shall playnely shewe, this your· bolde and playne saying, may be suspected for a playne lye.
But M. Stap. shaking of the further examining of this matter, hastneth to the full determination, and solemnly sitteth downe like a Pope him selfe or Patriarth, pronou~ceth the definitiue sentence of this matter, saying: The premisses beeing true, and of oure side abundantly proued, and better to be proued, as occasion shall serue, as nothing can effectually be brought agaynst them, so master Horne, as ye shall euidently perceiue in the processe, straggleth quite from all these poynts.
Ha sir, howe Popelike ye haue handled all this matter.
But were it lawfull to appeale from your sentence or call it in question, might it not be asked whether the promisses were all true? Yea might it not be doubted whether they were not all moste false? mighte it not be thoughte that it were scarse abundantly proued of your side, to say, the Catholikes say so, and say so, and maser Fecken. vvill say so? Might it not be suspected that ye still say ye haue proued it, ye will proue it better· ye shall hereafter shew it playnely· we shall euidently perceiue in the processe, and presently, that we can perceiue, ye proue, nor shevve any thing at all, and so sitte downe to sentence, as though the matter were out of all doubte and controuersie, determining solemnly that al these premisses be true, and Horne erreth in defending the contrarie.
This is an harde lawe M. Stap. presently to condemne and behead the man, and then after to examine the facte.
But it is the dayly practise of your holy father, and so lyke a good sonne ye follow his ensample.
But now sir, whereto were all these sixe so vndoubted principles broughte forthe? They are (say you) the principall questions in variaunce betvveene the parties controuersed, to fixe their eye vppon.
What? are these but questions, that were suche true and infallible principles righte nowe? If they be but questions, see they bée still disputable, for all master Stapletons definite sentence.
man maye still doubte of them, yea dispute of them.
And they may chaunce proue as false in the ende, after diligent discussing them, as master Stapleton, without further doubt would haue them presupposed to be true.
But to saue all vprighte he sayth, they are the principall questions controuersed betvveene them, and yet master Horne, dothe not once touche them, he commeth not nighe them.
What doth he not man? not once touch them nor come nighe them? and yet M. Feck. and he be most at variance about them? What a variance is that, belike he alloweth them, go to, go to, M. Stap. leaue this fonde lying for shame.
Your selfe knoweth, ech man may see, that he toucheth and toucheth home (as occasion serued him) all those of them, that were incident to his matter.
Some of them in déede he little medleth withall, as questions principally sucked out of your owne fingers, and deuised nowe by you to defeate all that he touched, as though he touched other things, and not the matter in question, from the whiche ye say he straggleth quite.
But this is your doing M. Stap. ye bring in newe controuersies that were not the issue betwéene them, on whiche you should haue fixed your eyes.
But the B. so touched the matter he had in variaunce, and so touched you also, that thus malapertly woulde varie with him and hitte you so full, that your eyes stared belike in your head, that ye coulde not, or woulde not, sée the question, but quite straggled from it, to other questions, and those also, which we must graunt ye for principles, and thei no doubt but ye will conquere all alone.
These newe premisses béeing thus craftelie deuised, and set vp by you, as the principall questions in variaunce betvveene them, that striued cleane about another matter: as though neither the B. nor M. Feck. sawe where aboutes they striued, no fixed their eyes any thing néere their matter.
But fought more Andabatarum, beating the ayre, and them selues, they wiste not about what: and béeing nowe reuoked to their matter by you, that neuer caste your eye so much as one glimpse aside therefrom: these béeing also suche principall matters, as muste withall of our liberalitie be graunted you, for moste assured principles: thinking nowe all is proued on your side: M. Horne (say you) straggleth quite from al these poynts, besetting him selfe, all his studie and endeuour, to proue that, vvhich neither greatly hindreth our cause, nor muche bettreth his and for the which neither M. Fek nor any other Catholike, vvill greatly contende vvith him, vvhich is, vvhen all is done, that Princes may meddle and deale in causes ecclesiasticall.
Ye do nowe like a liberall gentleman (M. Stap. graunt vs more than some of your highest estates euer would allow.
Cardinall Hosis durst not be so frée to Princes, as to graunt them thus much, as mouere sermonem, to moue any talke of ecclesiasticall matters: and dare you that are nothing like to come to so ye promotion, graunte that Princes may medle and deale with causes ecclesiastical? What moued you hereto? belike ye still dreamed of your former Papall sentence, and that we had graunted, or we must néedes graunt, bicause you haue sayd so, that these are the principall questions, and these are also moste true principles· and that nothing can effectually be brought agaynst them: which when ye presupposed we must néedes graunt, ye were content to graunt agayne to the B. that straggling as ye say from these poynts, that whiche he proueth may well be graunted him, that Princes may medle and deale vvith causes ecclesiasticall.
But nowe sir, put the case that this were but your owne fonde dreame, that he graunteth you those to be his questions, or those questions to be suche principles, that eche man vtterly denieth that, which you fancie eche man grauntth: yea that M. Feck. wil tell you, that not one of these your sixe questions were any of his questions, and that he dreamed not like you, but saw well inough what be dyd, when he stoode wholly on hys sayde issue, of the dealing of Princes in ecclesiasticall matters: yea and all your fellowes are ashamed that all the world should sée, ye set vp wrong markes, and fondly tooke for graunted, that almoste eche man denies, or doubteth of: When your selfe, béeing come to your selfe, shall sée all this: will ye not repent ye of your hastie liberalitie? and saye your selfe sawe not so muche? for if ye had ye would not haue graunted it so
Which beeing in déede the thing in question, and the thing wherein ye graunt the B. hath beset him selfe, all his studie and endeuour to proue: it not onely, as you graunt agaynst yourselfe, some what hindreth your cause, somewhat bettreth his, saying it neyther greatly hindreth our cause, nor muche bettreth his, but also it fully proueth the question in variaunce, on his parte, and cleane ouerthroweth M. Feck. assertion therin.
And thus of your too muche prodigalitie (as M. Feck. may call it) laboring to defende him, ye haue quite foilde him: and while ye would set vp new markes, and haue al mens eyes fixed theron, your selfe not fixing your owne eyes on the very marke set vp betwéene them, graunt that the B. hitte at the full, that which he shot vnto.
Which graunted, the arrow so reboundeth on you, your cause, that it quite ouerturneth both.
But M. St. hauing now espied, that he hath graunted that, which he sawe answereth sufficiently M. Feck. issue, and also confoundeth these new and false principles, and yet he could not for shame playnly reca~t, nor reuoke his grau~t: he first begiuneth· to pinch nip it, saying, it is true, princes may haue dealing in eccl. matters, but in some meaning, by whiche some meaning what he meaneth, as he dare not here for shame vtter, so he quickly slippeth fro~ it, telling vs it reacheth not home, and that the B. doth but face and bragge, thinking euery man borroweth of his co~mon places.
And so (to knit vp with his own words) is much labour vainly and idelly employed, with edious and infinite talke and babling, al from the purpose and out of the matter, which ought specially to haue bene iustified, not in stead thereof, to detayne and delude the reader with these newe sixe markes and false presupposed principles.
The third part of this diuision, is his quarelling with the B. for saying he made proofe, euen by many Papists them selues.
Which part he distributeth into thrée members: the first, he calleth in the margent, the vneuen dealing of the Protestants, the seco~d, a chalenge to M. Horne, and the third, M. Hornes tale incredible.
First, for the vneuen dealing of the Protestants Now is it worthy (saith M. St.) to see the ioly pollicie of this man, and how euen and corrspondent it is to his fellow Protestants.
M. Iewell restrayneth the Catholikes to sixe hundreth yeares, as it were by an extraordinarie and nevv found prescription of his owne, embarring al latter profes, yet he him selfe in the meane tyme runneth at large, almoste one thousande yeares later, shrynking hether and thither, taking tagge and ragge, Hereike and Catholike, for the fortifying of his false assertions.
When ye haue proued the B. of Saru~ his assertions false, then cal them so, for before, while ye complayne of the Protestantes vneuen dealing, ye shal shew most vneuen dealing in suche a Papist as your selfe.
As with all you shew your ioly Logike that you crake so much vpon, how euen correspondent it is to reason.
yeres to proue their articles by, Ergo, he can not confute their articles with their own co~fessions that are of later yeres.
As for the tag and rag, and mag too that he hath improued them withall, be euen them selues, their owne ragged rabbines, and tagged scholemen, be they heretikes or be they catholikes.
But be they as ye please to call them, dothe the limitation of your proues restrayne his improues? What if he improued your articles euen by your own mouthes who are now oxtant? might it be lawfull for you to cyne yet more newe articles? and to alledge proues for them of your own time, bicause he confuteth them by proues of your owne tyme? this belike were euen dealing with you, to let you haue so large scope to proue articles, as the improuer may haue to confute the~.
But as it is good reason ye should for the profe of your articles, be content for shame with so large a scope of.
yeres nexte after Chrise, so haue ye accepted thys limitation already, and M. Harding your standard bearer, your selfe with many of your partners, haue vndertaken to bring foorth your proues according to that restraynt of
How ye haue done it, Scripture (as they say) maketh mention, let the readers iudge.
Belike your selues doubt of those proues. and therfore groyne now at length, to be so restrayned for your proues, and fayne woulde haue a larger scope, saying, this is an extraordinarie and nevve founde prescription of his ovvne, embarring all later prooues, it goeth harde with you he like, that ye whine now so fast at that which ye receiued so lustily (to soeme to) and craked vpon before: and now that ye can not proue any one of your articles, in all that terme of
But what if ye had bene restrayned to the time of the primitine church? ye would then haue made an outcrie, and yet it had bene requisite, that for articles of faith religion, ye should not refuse to be restrayned euen to Chryst his Apostles.
And least ye should thinke we deals vneuenly with you, wheras you for to proue those articles of your religion, haue ye scope of.
yeres next after christ: limit you vs for any one articls of our fayth or religion, euen to the time of Christ and his Apostles abode on earth.
that we wil proue it, euen within sixe score, yea within sixe yeres, if ye wil.
So little haue ye, any iust cause to complayne of vneuen dealing· But let goe this your fonde quarell agaynst the B. of Sarum, and preserute your argument from him to the B. of Winchester your aduersarie.
This vvise trade (say you) this man keepeth also, and to resolue M. Feck, and settle his conscience, he specially staieth him selfe vpon Platina, Nauclerus, Vspergensis, Sabellicus, Aeneas pius, Volateranus, Fabian, Polychronico~, Petrus Bertradus, Be~no the cardinal· Dura~dus· Paulus Emilius, Martinus Penitentiarius, Polid.
Ver. and such like as he him selfe declareth other where, and in this place also confesseth.
Now albeit the catholiks refuse no catholik writer, nor in this matter haue cause so to do yet in a matter of such importa~ce vvhich besides the losse of all temporall reliefe, and besides bodily death, importeth also euerlasting damnation, to the catholikes (if the case so stande as M. Horne and his fellowes beare vs in hand) reason vvould he should haue fetched the substance of his profes much hier, yea, within the.
yeres, whervnto they strayne and binde vs The effect of al this, is, that as the B. of Sa. hath done, the B. of Wint· must do the like, or else they disagrée: and is contriued in this argume~t.
If the B. of Sa would haue the papists to proue those their articles vvithin the boundes of
yeres, then should the B. of Winchester in this so an Article, fetche the substance of his proufes vvithin those boundes.
But the B. of Winchester doth not this, but to resolue M. Feckenam and setle his conscience, stayeth him selt vpon Platina, Nauclerus, Abbas Ursperg.
Sabellic &c. all popish and late writers: Ergo, Their doings are not euen and correspondent.
To this answere: no parte of this argument is true, neither Maor, Minor, nor Conclusion.
The sequence of the Maor followeth not, bicause the B· of Sarum and the B. of Winchesters cause and occasion were nothing a like.
For first, he fetcheth the substance of his from within
Secondly he stayeth not him selfe and his cause vppon any of those late writers mentioned by you, but onely confuteth a Papist by a Papistes owne witnesse, nor he did this but onely to satisfie a Papists demaund For so M. Feckenham in his fourth parte expresly desired to be resolued, not by the restraint of
Although in a matter of such importance say) reason vvould that M. Feckenham should not haue disdayned to be resolued with the proufes of
But now that he requireth the continuall practise, what hath the B. committed, in laboring to resolue M. Feckenham, and settle his conscience, euen after his owne assignement? If he had not thus done, then ight ye haue wrangled more probablie.
But to request him to do it, and when he hath done it, to say he should not haue done it, what is this but very paltrie wrangling? thinke, would that had not done it, but ye should be angry with M. Feck. that desired him thereto.
Thirdly, the conclusion is like the premisses, for neyther vpon these their proues, or improufes ye can inferre any discorde or folly, in the manner of their writinges, nor any matter of dissonhre betwéene the~ Only in this your reprehension you iarre with your selfe, for where your drift is to proue the B. of Win. doings, not euen and correspondent to the B. of Sarisburies: when ye haue alleaged the doings of the one, should inferre the vnlike doings of the other, this wise trade (say you) this ma~ keepeth also How wise the trade is let others that be wise iudge: but how wise a trade keepe you, to inferre your complaint of vnlike dealing? for if he keepe also the same trade, be it wise or vnwise, that the B. of Saris hurie did, the~ are their doings of one trade· euen and correspondent to the other.
If they be not correspo~dent, Why then say you, this wise trade this man kepeth also? But this wise trade keepe you, all euer your booke, to ouertake your self in your own tale telling· Yet, although there be no eue~neste in your tale, you are stil correspondent to your selfe, euer wrangling about bymatters, let the principall slippe.
For what is here concluded, of that which you saie right now, our should be alwaies fixed, on the state of the question in variance betwene them twayne: and to see how eche partie applies his proufes therto? which if we here should do, we should sée this your brible brable, to be nothing euen or correspo~dent to the matter, nor to your owne aduertiseme~t.
Now M. St. hauing proued (as he imagineth) such a foule iarre of vneuen dealing betwene ye protestants this argume~t so pleaseth him, that herevpo~, he entreth into a chale~ge with the Bishop, to haue precisely the whole euery word of the Quéenes· Maiesties title, that in expresse wordes to be proued within the said
But herein ye wilie folishnesse or folish wilinesse, for precise termes, that he would obiect to the B. of Saru~, as al the world may sée the saide B. standeth not therin: so M. St. him self sta~ding precisely on the same, incurreth worthely his owne rude termes, be it of folishnes or folish wilinesse, the more to bewray them both, he chale~geth the B. furder, to haue these precise wordes proued in the saide
That the temporal men, without, yea and against the consent of the whole Clergie, altered the state of Religio~, called vsed for Catholike through out the whole corps of Christendome one thousande yeares before.
This he chalengeth to haue precisely verba found out with in
yeares, euery point of this chalenge he would· haue so proued by exprese wordes, that within
yeres after Christ, the state of the Religion that co~tinued
yeres· after Christ, should haue be thus altered: thus would he· co~teyne limite (like a good Arithmetrician) the number of
Whether this be fool wilinesse or wilie foolishnesse, euen let Sim subtile M. St. the chalenger· he iudge him selfe therof.
As for the matter it selfe of his chalenge· is referred to his place of ders, so much a toucheth those, whome he calleth men.
The other parte thereof, may thrust in an elbow, among his lying crakes.
That the Popish religion, which after his ordinarie fashion he calleth Catholike, was called so, or so vsed,
Your precise termes called and vsed for Catholike, if ye meane of the present or late time, may well be borne with all, it hath so (I grant) ene called and vsed for Catholike, though in déede it were neuer so.
But to say it was called or vsed so, for a
yeares agoe, when it had neither name, nor vse, nor was any thing at al, therein ye recken without your hoste: but true reckeners do say misreckening is no payment.
But now at the gth ye come nearer to the B. preface.
And that by such authours for a great sort of the~, as are the more to be credited in this matter for that they were most earnest fautours of the Romish sea, &c. Here ye come in huing, VVhat an impudent face as harde as any horne or stone haue ye, besides, your mere follie, to make the worlde beleeue that the authors aforesaide alowed suche kinde of regiment, of ciuill Princes, as the Catholikes novve denie? VVhiche assertion· is so certenly and notoriously false, that Master Horne him selfe can not nor doth not denie, but that his ovvne authors vvere most earnest fautors of the sea of Rome.
And how then may it once be thought by any vvise man, that they should alovve the doings of such, that forsake and abandonal manner of authoritie of that sea, furder than is the common authoritie of all other Bishops, yea and make the Bishop of that sea to vvhom the saide authors attribute so large and ample authoritie and prerogatiue as may be, and vvhom they agnise as supreme Iudge in matters of fayth, a very Antichrist.
These things be incredible, these thinges (as the Prouerbe is) hang together like Germaines lippes, and so shall you good Readers see the matter most euidently fall out.
Let the matter fall out as it shal M. Stap.
answere as now to this present, which well sheweth who eareth that impudent face ye speake of, for what is all this but partely your impudent facing, that all these authors are so clere on your side as ye pretende.
Partely it is yet a more impudent facing, thus before the face of the worlde to outface the B. with a manifest vntruth, saying, that he saide, all those Popishe writers allowed it.
Where he onely sayd a great sorte of them not all.
Neither talked he of their allovving this thing, but sayd they were most earnest fautors of the romish sea, infected &c. Whether they allowed it or not, what was that to him? in this parte of the practise, he proued by their owne tales, the thing to be practised, not their allowance or disalowance thereof.
And yet might they, yea ought also, (being Historians) to write the facte, whether they allowed it yea or no.
As for making the Pope to be Antichrist, diuerse of them haue not spared to call him so, whether they tooke him to be so or no referre to others.
But all this not withstanding, you crie out, these things be certenly and notoriously false, these things be incredible, M. Hornes tale incredible.
But for short answere M. St. these incredible things if your owne light witte, did not hang in the light of your owne liyng lippes, ye might see them hang togither well inough.
Thus much to your counterblast on the B. Preface. [leaf motif]M. Feckenhams title of his Booke.
THe declaration of such scruples and stayes of conscience touching the Othe of supremacie, as M. Iohn Feckenham by writyng did deliuer vnto the L. Bishop of VVinchester, with his resolution made thereunto.
This title the Bishop noteth to conteine an vntrue reporte and ambiguous guile.
You pretend (saith the B.) and would haue your frendes to thinke, that the first foure chiefe pointes set forth in your booke, were deuised by you, put in writing, and so deliuered vnto me, as the matter and ground.
Whervpon the conference to be had betwixt me you should stande, and that made therevnto none other but such resolutions, as it pleased you vntruly to reporte.
In the first parte you conuaye an vntruth vnder a colourable and ambigious meaning, in these wordes, as M. Iohn Feckenham by writing did deliuer vnto the Lord of VVinchester.
In the other parte you make vntrue report with out any colour at all.
Thus saith the B. to M. Feckenham, for the false title of his Booke.
To this M. Stapl· counterblast consisteth on foure points, the first is, that It is a by matter, which whether it be true or false, doth nothing either preiudicate or touche the principall question.
To the which answere, it is in déede but the very title, but feare me, it is somwhat preiudiciall to the parties honestie, also to his whole treatise, to be entituled with a manifest lie.
Howbeit St. doth wisely for himselfe to set the matter so light, that it should not force whether this title be true or false so long as it doth not touche the principall question, for by this rule M. Stapl. counterblast, being almost litle els, than by matters nor touching the principall questio~, when soeuer (as it will fall out very often) he shalbe sounde to make a lie, the matter may quickly be salued, with this his first rule, it is a by matter which whether it be true or false, doth nothing either preiudicate or touche the principall question.
And so this one answere may serue to defend not onely M. Feck but the best parte of M. Stapl. counterblast.
But if he had any great regard of his owne, or M. Feck. honestie, or would winne credite to his booke cause, he would haue more regarde, then, euen of the thing that is first of all chalenged, for a manifest falshood, to protest that he recketh not whether it be true or false.
It is a signe either of a very rechlesse defender that careth not for truth: or of a very false client and cause that must be defended with falshood. that, euen in the very title front of the treatise.
But alas, what should M. St. els do, in so euident a case, yet may say to you, he setteth a good face on the matter, leauing out nothing that may séeme not only to make ye matter lesse haighnous, but also to proue that M. Feck. vsed simple dealing herein.
And so secondly entring into the excuse of M. Feck.
VVhat inco~uenience (saith he) is it pray you, though M. Feck wrote in the towre, that which he deliuered to M. Horne at waltha~· what inconuenience foloweth pray you, if he minded first to deliuer the same to his examiners in the Tower, or els where as occasion should serue? is this sufficient to disproue him, to condemne him, to slaunder him of surmised vntruth? it is rather to be thought of such as are not malicious, to be playne dealing· not to dissemble with you, but euen as he had penned the writing before, so without any alteratio~ to deliuer it· who neuerthelesse afterwarde hauing occasion to exhibite and present the same writing to others, did simply without guile or deceipt signifie it to be deliuered vnto you at waltha~· and was it not so? denie it if you ca~.
Euery childe by this may see, how fonde and foolish your cauill is.
But euery childe M. St. (you thought) should not see the couneyance of your Sophistrie, in fetching the matter thus about the bush to clere M. Feck. of the falshood of his title.
And yet many childre~ know that captio~ wel inough pluribus interrogats, by asking many things togither confusedly, to make vs grau~t vnawares what ye please to conclude.
We graunt ye, that M. Feck. wrote that in the Tower, that he deliuered to the Bat waltha~, he did so, and might do so without any inconuenience.
We graunt ye also, he minded first to deliuer the same to his examiners, in the tower or els where, as occasio~ should serue, this might he also haue done conueniently.
You aske againe, if this be sufficie~t to disproue him, to condemne him, to slau~der him of surmised vntruth? We graunt ye also it is not M. St. nor ye B. or any other goeth about so to do, here in you do but slaunder ye B. with surmised vntruth.
Ye procéede, that it was plaine dealing, and not to dissemble with the B. euen as he had penned the writing before, so without any alteration to deliuer it.
We graunt it might be so also M. Stapl. if he meant good sothe, but what is all this to the matter, wherewith the B. chargeth him? It followeth, VVho neuertheles afterwarde, hauing occasion to exhibite and present the same in writing to others, did simply without guile or disceit, signifie it to be deliuered to you at Waltham.
Yea forsooth M. St. now ye come to the purpose, wherewith the B. chargeth him, for the falshood of his title Proue now that this treatise, thus made by M. Feck. in the tower, directed to the co~missioners, after that, without any alteration deliuered to the B. at waltham: had the same title which this his treatise set out, hath, then you cléere M. Feck.
But this you can not do, and therefore you speake in ious speaches, saying, VVho neuerthelesse afterwardes hauing occasion to exhibite and present this same writing, to others did simplie without guile or deceit, signifie it to be deliuered vnto you at waltham.
The writing ye say, is the same writing, howe chance then it hath not the same title? why say you, neuerthelesse? meane you not thereby he altered either somthing therein, or at least the title thereof? why dare ye not speake it in plaine english? But say he did signifie it to be deliuered to the Bat waltham? If he had let the treatise kéepe his true title, and then haue made such signification, then might ye haue said he did it simplie without guile or disceit, then might ye haue concluded plaine dealing.
But since M. Feckenham first enituled his booke, an Answere &c. to the Queenes Highnes commissioners &c. and after scrapeth out that title, in place thereof entituleth it, Scruples &c. to the Lorde B. of VVinchester: if ye had concluded that M. Feck vsed plaine dubling, this had bene a plaine conclusion.
And the more ye trauaile to excuse his dubling, ye shew your owne guile and disceit, with your captious argume~t ambiguous speaches, and to couer his falsehood bewraye your owne vntruth.
Which M. Stap. wisely fearing, letteth go the furder excusing of M. Feckenham and retorning to his former rule.
Be it false or be it true what is al this (saith he) to the matter and thing now in hande? it is (as your selfe confesse) but a circumstance.
And here thirdly after his defence of M. Feck· he falleth to accuse the B. for not obseruing of due circumstances.
But reserue the answere, to some instance hereof, also his marginal note that M. Horne keepeth not his owne rule.
But sith this hath neither cou~terblastical, nor marginal, nor any of proofe at al: till it shale proued, let it go as woordes of course among his common places.
St. hauing thus labored to excuse the title of M. Feck, booke, and that now it is so clere of all faulte, that he might procéede to his next diuision without furder dalia~e, as one that all this while, was not well aduised, nor remembred his matter, nor him selfe, but wrote this excuse of M. Feck. halfe a sléepe, sodenly calleth to minde one greate poynte, wherin the title of M. Feckenhams treatise may be counted faultie.
And here fourthly, he entreth into a great and solemne counterblast, almost full true sides of his booke, the summe whereof is very muche forsoothe appertayning to the question, and therefore in no case muse so lightely be forgotten.
But novv (sayth he) that remember and aduise my selfe a little better, suppose can not altogither excuse M. Feck. for this title, but muste rase out thereof foure vvords, and in steade of L. B. of VVinchester, set in M. Robert Horne.
This is a sore fault in deed M. Stap. and M. Feckenham worthy great blame for it, and you worthy much commendation, for calling to your remembraunce so seene, a matter that so muche toucheth the state of the question betweene them, whether the B. of Winchester were well called L. Byshop, or M. Horne, yea or no, a very highe poynte, and worthy so clerkly a declamation, as ye haue made there.
But since, as ye confesse, he is so in the estimation of many, and so called after the vsuall sorte, let vs sée after what vsuall or vnusual sort, you esteeme and gather to the contrarie, agaynst M. Feck. and the B. herein.
But first, remembring also in time, that this is not the way to defende M. Feck. to finde faulte with him, and that he hath already founde a faulte in this title of his treatise, and can not eate agayne his worde: though he defende him not, yet will he not be ouer harde an aduersarie to him, but mitigate at the least the cause of his defaulte, saying: M. Feckenham dissembling and winking at the common errour. &c. of his great modestie and ciuilitie, willing the lesse to exasperate you others, though he well knewe ye vvere no right B. yet after the vsual forte, calleth and termeth you L. B. of VV.
But muste be so bolde by your leaue, as playnly and bluntly to go to worke with you, as haue done before with M. Grindall, and M. Iuell, your pewfellowes, and to remoue fro~ you this glorious glittering pecocks tayle, and to call a fig a fig, and a horne a horne, and to say that most truely, ye are no L. B. of VVinchester, or else where, but onely M. Robert Horne.
And is there no remedie M. Stap. but you muste be so bolde and blunt, as to chaunge M. Feck. title onely, for saying L. B. of.
VVinchester? But since ye must néedes, who can let you, ye do but after your blunt kinde, ye are a plaine ma~, brought vp at home, who so bold as blind bayard.
Yet is your bunt boldnesse herein yt more to be borne withall, that while ye would shew your bolde spite agaynst the B. your aduersarie, ye excuse M. F. your clye~t with very blunt termes also: who~ ye entituled before with smooth flattring clawes, The right Reuerent father my L. Abbot of VVestm.
Now he is distembling M. Feck. and winking M. Feck. at the common error.
But the B. and M. Feck. must néedes beare with you at this time, bicause ye must néedes be so bolde as to go plainly and bluntly to worke.
But howsoeuer they must beare with you for your blunt spéeches, must we also beare with you, that would make dissembling at errours, to procéede of great modestie, and vertue to be the mother of vice? except disse~bling be also a vertue in you, as it is much vsed amongst a number of dissembling Papists at this day with vs, was wont to be proper to friers monks aboue al other, to dissemble, that with most fayned modestie and humilitie to.
But al was but hypocrisie, an hypocrites end it hath come vnto.
Therefore howsoeuer we muste beare with your bluntnesse, as ye cal a fig a fig, a horne a horne, so pray you call dissembling dissembling falshod falshod, ye can neuer call it modestie, great or little, howe boldely, bluntly and immodestly so euer ye out face the matter.
And thus once againe, while ye would excuse M. Feck. title, to conteine no ralshod ye not only accuse it, but also accuse M. Feck. to be a false dissembler, and a winkapipes, so properly ye defende him.
But still ye must be borne withall, for bicause ye go bluntly to worke.
And were it not that for this phyne bluntnesse, ye muste be borne withal, some blunt playne fellow woulde peraduenture call for some reason.
Let vs heare therefore howe bluntly you proceede to proue, that ye haue so bluntly spoke~.
For (say you) albert the Prince may make a Lorde at hir gratious pleasure, whom she liketh, yet can she not make you L. B. of VVinchester, considering you are not L. but in respect of some baronages and temporalties belonging and annexed to the See of VV.
But you vsurping the See, as ye are no B. so for the consideration aforesayde ye are no L. nor Prelate of the Garter.
For ye can be no Prelate of the Garter, beeing no Prelate at all, that beeing a prerogatiue appropriate to the Prelate and B. of VVinchester.
Soft M. St. if ye be so playne blunt a man as ye pretr~d, ne sutor vltra crepda, hew not hye, least chips fall in your eye: blunder not so rudely with princes. must the Q. Maiestie beare with you to, bicause you must needs go bluntly to worke? ye presume to determine what the Q. highnes may do.
She can make him but she can not make him L. B. of VV.
And why so M. St? considering he is not Lorde, but in respecte of some baronage and temporalties belonging and annexed to the See of VVinchester.
Erg, then ye graunt him to be Lorde B. by your owne words, to whom the Q. highnesse (as you graunt she may, in respect of the temporalties and baronies belonging therto hath graunted and giuen him them.
Wherby she hath made him Lord, except ye wil denie, that hir highnesse authoritie, which euen al your popish bishops, did receiue before at hir graces progenitors hands, neither the baronies and temporalties onely (wheby they were named Lords, but their inuestiture also, wherby they were Byshops, at the Princes handes.
But see stil how bluntly ye go to worke against your self, for hast to remoue this title of Lord from the B. of W. ye ouerturn ye glory of your own prelats.
For if this your rule be true, yt he is not called Lord, but in respect of some baronies temporalties belonging and annexed to the See how many Cardinals, Bishops, Suffraganes, Abbots, Priors, euen in Italie (that haue neither baronies nor muche temporalties) should léese their title of Lorde honour? thinke you all these will be pleased with this your rule? We must beare with you there is no remedie, and well may M. Feck. of friendship, the B. of pitie beare with you also, the Quéenes maiestie of hir gracious clemencie beareth with your saucie bluntnesse.
But assure your selfe, and ye were as blunt playne as euer were your Marcolphus, those Italian prelates, if ye stayne their honour, will neuer beare with you one iot.
And rede you beware this bluntnesse for they can do much with your holy father the Pope, except ye be so blunt ye care not for him neither.
But deale with them as ye may, ye are blunt inoughe in your owne conceite, for the finest of them all.
Let vs sée what reasons moueth you to be so blunt with the B.
He is not L. Byshop of VVin. nor Prelate of the Garter.
Why so? bicause he is no B. or Prelate at all.
How proue ye that? he is an vsurper, he is an intruder, he is called therto by no lawfull vocation nor canonicall consecration &c. he is no true B. &c. his vocation is direct contrarie to the canons and constitutions of the Churche, and to the vniuersall custome and maner heretofore, vsed and practised not onely in Englande, but also in all other Catholike countreys and Churches, deliuered to vs from hande to hande, from age to age, euen from the first grafing and planting of the fayth, especially in Englande.
Here are many blunt playne words in déede M. St. and many great crakes, but here is no proofe of any: do not think ye muste still be thus borne withall: your to muche presuming of eche mans pacience, to beare with your rudenesse, will hazarde your credite to farre, excepte ye alledge some reason of your sayings.
For the which referre me (say you) to all autentike and auncient· recordes, as well of Englande as of other Nations concerning the ordinary succession of Bishops, namely in the foresayde Sea of VVinchester, for there was not, no not one, in that Sea, that did not acknowledge the supremacie of the Sea of Rome, and that was not confirmed by the same, vntil the late time of M. Poynet, who otherwise also was an vsurper, the true B. then liuing, and by no lawfull or ecclesiasticall order remoued or depriued.
Ye are therefore the first B. of this sewt and race, and so consequently no B. at al.
As not able to shew to whom ye did ordinarily succede, and any good or customable either vocation or co~secration.
VVhich point being necessarily required in a B. and in your Apostles Luther, and Caluin other lacking, (as haue otherwhere sufficie~tly proued, though you by depesilence thinke it more wisdome, vtterly to desemble, than once to answere) they being therwith pressed, were so messhed and bewrapped therein, that they coulde not in this worlde witte what to say thereto, answearing this and that, they wiste neare what, nor at what poynt to holde them, yea Beza was fayne at the last assemblie at Poysie, with silence to confesse the inuincible truth.
Setting aside these vaine crakes, manifest lying slaunders which referre to your common places M. St.
Your argument is this, ye succeede no Bishop of VVinchester: Ergo, ye are no Bishop of VVincester.
answere: First, if he meane succession of the person in the roome, your antecedent is euident false.
He succeded the persons of Popishe Bishops in the same roome.
For then, the first Bishop of that Sea, was no B. bicause he succeded none, but was the first therf.
And if the first was none, then the second was none, and so there was neuer any at all.
If ye meane sucession of the doctrine, and the Apostles rules: then neyther Bishoppe Gardiner whom ye call the true B. nor any popishe Bishops, haue succession, but digression and defection from them.
And our Bishoppes haue the true succession, that is to say followe the doctrine and orders of the Apostles, prescribed in the worde of god, for a Bishops office.
But howe do ye proue your antecedent? Of all the Bishops not onely in Englande, but in other nations, namely, in the Sea of VVinchester.
From hand to hand, from age to age, euen from the first grafting and planting of the fayth in Englande, not one of them all, no not one, that did not acknowledge the supremacie of the sea of Rome, and that was not confirmed by the same.
But you do not acknowledge the supremacie of the Sea of Rome, nor are confirmed by the same.
Ergo, ye are the first Bishop of this sewt and race, and so consequently no bishop at all, as not able to shew to whome ye did ordinarily succeede, or any good and customable eyther vocation or consecration.
This argument (M. Stapleton) is of a newe sewt and race, it succedeth neither good nor customable moode or figure, and therfore can make no good successe.
The minor we graunt, as euident on the Bishops part.
For the maior we must put you to your proufe.
For proufe hereof, you say, for the which referre me to all autentike and auncient recordes as well of Englande, as of other nations.
Ye say well herein master Stapleton, and we take your offer.
Did Iames euen the first Bishop of Hierusalem, acknowledge the supremacie of the Sea of Rome? Was he confirmed by the same Sea? when as yet the same Sea was not to be acknowledged or be confirmed by? If (as you say) the B. can be no prelate of the Gater, being no prelate at all: how could that Sea be acknowledged, that was not at all? Moreouer do ye thinke that Timothie Bishoppe of Ephesus, or Titus of Crta, and all other Bishoppes of Asia or Grece, that Sainte Paule made, acknowledged the supremacie of the Sea of Rome, or were confirmed by the same, when Sainte Paule that ordeyned them sayeth, he receyued his authoritie of no man? And when he came to Rome, he neyther came to haue his Bishops confirmed of the Sea of Rome, nor he founde anye Sea there, nor sought Peter for the saide purpose else where, nor thought himselfe any whitte inferiour to him: much lesse thought he of any suche supremacie, eyther of his Sea or him.
Nowe, if the first and originall of all those Bishoprikes Eastwarde, neyther acknovvledged anye supremacie of that Sea, nor were confirmed by the same: What plea can you make of theyr succession? If they swarued from theyr predecessours and first founders, your selfe confesse it is no good succession, but a newe sewte and race.
And if it be good and lawfull succession, that the Bishops of the East Churches succeded by, then, neyther acknowledged they anye supremacie of the Sea of Rome, nor were confirmed by the same, euen which not onelye the true autentyke and auncient recordes doe testifie, howe they agréed, although in sayth, yet nothing lyke in disciplines, rytes and orders, to whiche the Romaine Sea doth sweare all those Bishoppes, that are confyrmed by it, and acknowledge obedience therevnto: But also euen to this daye (thoughe one or two Bishoppes, nowe and then of late time, for verye necessitie and hope of reliefe) haue runne to the Sea of Rome, yet by theyr ordinarie and customable succession, euen from the Apostles times, so long as they continued Christian, neuer acknowledged they the supremacie of the Sea of Rome, nor were confirmed by the same.
The like recordes for the Churches southward, remaine, not only of their beginnings from the other Apostles, not from the Sea of Rome, but also of their continuance, howe they woulde not admitte anye supremacie of the same Sea, ouer them, and what contention they had thereabout.
As for their confirmations, that they had them not from the sea of Rome, but euen from the Emperour, yea the Bishop of Rome himselfe, and other, from their princes: the practise when we come thereto shall shewe.
And as east warde and southwarde, so may we like wise reason of the Church westward, where S. Paule (after he had bene two yeare at Rome) by the space of tenne yeares trauelled in Italie, Spaine, and Fraunce, as witnesse Eusebius, Epiphanius, Ierome, Euthalius Diaconus, Nicephorus, Beda, Platina, yea Frier Perionius, that wrote the other daye de vits Apostolorum: that in Langue do he made a Bishoppe at Narbona, who trauelled after with him in Spaine.
And if in all that space (as it is most likely) he made other Bishops, shall we suppose they were not full Bishops, till they had their Bulles from the Sea of Rome? And if the first B. did not so, your reason of succession fayleth.
Now let vs briefly sée howe it likewise fayles for England.
Namely in the foresayde Sea of VVinchester, that from the first grafting and planting of the fayth in England, there was not, no not one in that Sea, that did not acknowledge the supremacie of the Sea of Rome, and was not confirmed by the same, vntill the late time of master Poynet: who otherwise also was but an vsurper, the true Bishop then liuing, by no lawful or ecclesiasticall order remoued or depriued.
The lawfull order and sufficient causes of B. Gardeners depriuation is extant, and sette out in the booke of Monumentes.
Howe true a Bishop (as ye call him) he was, if the acknowledging of obedience to the Sea of Rome, bée an argument of a true Bishop, his booke de vera obedientia, of true obedience, doth declare, and almost all the time of his bishopriche, he neuer acknowledged the supremacie, to apperteine to the Sea of Rome, but to the prince, as the Bishop now doth, there néede no recordes for the matter.
And as for olde recordes, since the first grafting and planting of the faythe in Englande, whiche is farre longer, than eyther from your Apostle, monke Augustine, or from Birinus Bishop of Winchester: the recordes do testifie, howe the Christians, whome your Augustine and his mates founde in thys Realme, neyther kept the ceremonyes and rytes of the Romaine Churche, nor admitted the Legantine authoritie, of your sayde Apostle, which argueth that theyr Bishoppes acknowledged not (as you saye) the supremacie of the Sea of Rome, nor were confirmed by the same, euen from Lucius till almost King Arthures tyme. when the Heathen Sarons so preuayled, in the west parts, that euen in Winchester, in King Arthures reigne, Cerdicius erected a Temple of Heathen Idolles falsely called yet to this daye the Temple of Dagon, as the olde recordes doe mention.
Now M. St. séeing the falsenesse of this argument of succession to be such, that he dare not abide the triall of his recordes, he flyeth from it, and graunteth at the length, the B. vocation to be good and sownd.
Yet hath he a stronger reason to disable him, which is this: No heretike ought to be admitted to a Byshops roome, or if he be, he forthwith ought to be remoued.
But for that yee are yoked, or as ye pretende maryed, ye are no doubt an Heretike, Ergo were your vocation good and sounde, yet haue you disabled your selfe to occupie that roome, and eyther ought not to be admitted, or forthwith ought ye to be remoued.
aunswere the maior true, and if it were as truely executed, none should better féele it, than the popish prelates, who confesse them selues not only for other Seas, but euen for their hed and mother sea of Rome, that diuers hereikes haue bene B. thereof.
Who being so admitted, demaunde with Piers Plowma~ of you M. St. by this your maior, who shall hang the Bell about the rattons necke? who shall remoue an heretike Bishop of Rome? thinke it will belong or euer he remoue him selfe.
The minor of this argument is of the diuels sophisrie, so S. Paule calleth it doctrinam daemoniorum, and sayth, let a B. be the husbande of one wife, and so was Saint Peter (who ye say was your first Bishoppe of Rome.)
And yet neither was Saint Peter therefore an hereike, nor saint Paule woulde haue B. to be hereikes.
And yet here to proue vs heretikes, for defence of mariage, he saith he will referre vs to the olde Canons of the fathers.
What fathers meane you, the Apostles, Master Stapleton, that sayd mariage was honourable among all men? Meane ye the Canons that beare those fathers titles, and say, Episcopu aut Presbiter vxorem propriam nequaquam sub obtentu religionis abijciat, si vero reiecerit excommunicetur, sed si perseuerauerit deijciatur? Let not a Bishop or a Priest putte awaye his owne wyfe vnder the pretence of Religion, and if he put hir away, let him be excomunicate, and if hee continue (in his fault) let him be put out of his office.
If you meane these fathers, your selues heare their verdict agaynst you.
Dr meane ye the fathers of Nicene councell, that agréed to the reuerent father Paphnutius? but, for some of the fathers, ye name whom ye meane, specially S. Augustine and Epiphanius, whom ye call poore Catholikes, in déede master Stapleton they are very poore helpes, that ye can wring from them, to maintaine Poperie withall: but thinking we will reiect them, M. St. will wrap vs euen in our owne confessions.
Your owne famous Apologi (sayth he) sayth that Epiphanius numbreth.
heresies, of the which it is one, for a man after the order of Priesthood to mary.
But trust you wil not be agaynst your owne Apologie.
Ergo ye are heretikes by your owne confession that marie after Priesthood.
The co~sequence of this argume~t goeth hard M. St. to reason from ye Apollogies reciting of Epiphanius, to the Apollogies allowing of all thinges that either he hath, or they recite out of him.
heresies, and the Apologie vsth this tearme Heresies, in the same sense that Epiphanius did, as appeareth plainly by the example, of heresies that are therein rehearsed.
perticular and seuerall false opinions, for so he should haue doubed at the least that number, but he meaneth by
heresies, so many head or chief ectaries or sects, whereof euery one maintayneth many seuerall perticular opinions hereticall, this is the plaine meaning of Epiphanius, as appeareth most manifestly through out his booke, which argueth that M. St. séeking this poore shift, full lyke a poore Catholike and poore clearke also, neuer read Epiphanius himselfe, but hearing tell that Epiphanius wrote agaynst heresies at perticular opinions hereticall.
Of the which heresies taken after Epiphanius his vsage, sect or sectarie, either for a perticular opinion hereticall, he reckeneth this for none, (that can finde) for a man after the order of priesthood to marie.
If he had reckened this for any, be sure M. Stap. would hane reckened vp hys wordes and quoted the place.
Master Staleton now imagining with himselfe that he hath quite foyled vs, and that we must runne from the fathers, yea and eae our owne wordes, cryeth out, what then haue you to iustifie your cause? But againe to help vs in this distresse, he conceyueth that there is yet one poore and selye helpe behinde, and that is to flie vnder the defence (as he contumeliouslye tearmeth it) of our brickle Bulvvarke of actes of Parliament.
And here for raging after many impertinent things he co~cludeth thus.
Such and such articles are commaunded to be set forth by the authoritie of Parliament.
Ergo our fayth hangeth onely on the authoritie of Parliament.
Item, such and such articles of religion are not namely expressed in the actes of Parliament, Ergo they are heretical, and vnlawfull.
The follie of these arguments néede none other answere but to shew them.
But all this while where were your eyes fixed, that they once looked not to the question in controuersie doe ye obserue your owne rule, so well M. Stapleton? howbeit, sith ye doe it of bluntnesse, agaynst these wordes of M. Feckenhams title, the Lord Bishop of VVinchester, Ye must be borne withall.
THe B. to proue this chalenge of M. Feckenhams title to conteyne manifest guile and falshoode, sheweth the whole processe, fyrst of Master Feckenhams treatise composed in the Tower, and directed to the Queenes highnesse Commissioners: and afterwardes howe he scrapeth out those phrases, and pretendeth as thoughe the treatise had beene composed at Waltham, and directed to the Bishop.
Secondly, for his pretence of scruples as deliuered to the B. by writing, to be resolued in them, and of the B. resolutions there vnto, the B. sheweth the whole dealing of the co~fere~ce betwene the~.
First that by mouthe, not by wryting, they reasoned on these poynts, and that M. Feckenham seemed resolued in them, and vpon what occasion afterwarde he fell to wrangling agayne from them, what a doe the Byshop had, to haue master Feckenham write some positions or assertions in for me of propositions, to the ende they mighte certenly goe forwarde, whiche the Byshop coulde not bring him vnto, tyll at the lengthe, at his owne requeste the Byshop putte in wryting the woordes of the othe, with the sense or interpretation added therevnto, that master Feckenham considering therevppon, mighte deuise the fourme of his propositions, wherevppon they mighte afterwarde debate.
Whereby appeareth bothe howe vntrue it is, that he had deliuered vnto the Byshoppe any suche scruples of his in wryting, for then the Byshop needed not haue soughte any propositions of hys assertions: and also how vntrue that is, that the interpretation of the othe, whiche the Byshop wrote at his requeste, before he euer sawe any writing of master Feckenham, was to answere hys scruples and stayes deliuered to the Bishop in writing.
To these the Byshoppes chalenges of master Feckenhams false tytle, master Stpletons answere is thréefolde.
First (sayth he) here is no matter effectuall, but that maye seeme already by our former ansvvere sufficiently discharged.
Howe this matter is before of you discharged, is yet freshe in the Readers memorie.
thinke he will not giue ye your quietus est, so lightly, except ye bring better proues, and agrée better to your owne tale.
For here, where ye say, ye haue ansvvered suffyciently before, to all that is effectuall, this argueth that he was charged with somewhat that was effectuall, else haue ye answered to no effectual thing.
And yet your answere before was, that ye matter wherwith the B. charged M. F. for his false title, was but a bie matter, which, whether it were true or false doth nothing preiudicate or touch the principal question: and so the whole charge is a matter nothing effectuall.
But let go this to your contradictions, and let the reader iudge howe sufficiently ye haue discharged M. Feck. or not rather charged him, with as muche, or more than the B. did.
The seco~d part of M. St. answere, is a gathering togither of such matters, as he noteth in the B. for vntruthes, which referre to his common place theron.
Thirdly, where the B. speaking of the occasion of M. Fe. wrangling in his conference with the B: mentioned hys shrinking from his confederates in the conference at W. in the.
yere of the Q. maiestie: Herevpon, though he co~fesseth, saying, might now passe forth to the residue of M. Hornes booke, yet must he not in any wise let slip this occasion of digression, for otherwise, he should want matter to suffe vp his connterblast.
And so at large entreth to proue, that they were vneuenly delt withall, for proofe wherof, he alledgeth diuers reasons.
First, they were disaduantaged to be put to the profe of that, wherof they were in possessio~.
answer, they were in possession of possessions in éede, not of the truth, vnlesse they had it in their possession of imprisonme~t.
Secondly, they gaue ouer the disputatio~, not bicause they had not, or did not shevve suffycient euidence, but bicause they were very muche strayted for shortnesse of tyme: and so belike coulde not finde it out.
Thirdly, it was a fruitlesse and superfluous enterprise, to dispute of those three matters only, whether the seruice may be in the mother tong.
VVhether any one realme may alter and change the rites and ceremonies in the Church, make new.
VVhether the masse· be a sacrifice propiciatorie, seeing that the.
dependeth vpon the questio~s of transubstantiation, the reall presence, vvhich ought first to haue bene discussed and then this as accessorie therevnto.
What a nu~ber of starting holes the papists had to auoide the disputation? they were farre better armed to find excuses to giue it ouer, than prouided to go throughstitche therwith.
But had they had such euidence ready as ye pretende M. St. what néede they finde fault with the time? although they had as much time, as their aduerfaries had, to prepare them selues.
And if they were strayghted for shortnesse of time, to dispute onely of three matters, and those as ye say not the weightiest neither: why complayne ye of their questions to haue bene but three onely, in so many and weightie matters, as nowe stande in controuersie? Could they dispatch so many great matters, in so straight a time, and would they whine to be straited, for only three lesse matters? Ha M. St. this is to broade before.
But ye wrythe the excuse an other way, not so muche for the number, as the lightnesse of the matters, to be dependant and accessory to other questions, ad to be no matters of fayth.
How light so euer ye woulde séeme to make them now, ye haue made the~ as waightie an other time before.
But let the~ be as light as ye would haue them, lesse to, did ye not agrée on them, yea did you not your selues deuise them, vnwitting to the other parties? Did ye not prepare for them? might ye not the easelier haue answered vnto them? these are but childishe excuses, let vs heare what more ye haue.
Yea there M. St. ye hitte the nayle on the head.
His example of the Anabaptists disputation at Monster, which he likeneth to this at VVestminster, passe ouer to his raylings and slaunderous common places.
Fifthly, they should haue bene suffred to haue replied to their aduersaries, which they could not be suffred to do.
If ye had put in disorderly, ye had said true.
But would they haue kept the order by them selues deuised and agreed vpon, they might haue replied at the full: the doing was not in hucker mucker, inowe heard it that can tell.
And your owne other excuses do plainly argue, not that ye coulde not be suffred, but that ye could not for the time, or would not for the matter, and néeded not pleading possession, and thought not good, for bicause of the Iudges, with such other excuses, that as your selfe confesse, moued you to giue ouer the disputation.
Which howe it agréeth with this fifth excuse, that ye could not be suffred to replie: is easie to discerne, and to take a lyer tardie in his owne tale.
Sixtly last say you, surely amo~g al other, concerning the supremacie of the Prince in causes eccle. &c. there shoulde haue ben much more mature deliberation.
Deliberation is good in al things, M. St. but wilfull prolonging foding on the time, is neither good nor godly, chiefly in Gods matters, wherein we are bidden, hodie si vocem andieritis, nolite obdurare corda vestra.
But when would your deliberation be ripe M. St? it appeareth by these your excuses, yt your selfe would be rotten, or euer it would be ripe.
Ye would go to it with ripe deliberation, that is to say, as a beare goeth to the stake: ye would aduise your self long or euer ye would willingly come to try your doctrine religion by disputation, if ye could otherwise chose.
Howbeit by your owne tale, these matters néede no such long protracting the time, béeing so few, so light, as here in your excuses you pretend they be.
Yea but surely (say you) among al other things co~cerning the supremacy of the Prince in causes ecclesiastical.
Why M. St. here was neither al causes, nor the cause of supremacie debated.
But onely (as your selfe say) three accessarie matters, and matters nothing touching faith.
And therefore ye ouershoote your selfe once againe, to put in this excuse.
But what is your small drift of all these excuses? forsooth this: The Popes legate should haue bene president at the disputation of these matters, and then it had bene a formall disputatio~.
Then would ye not haue complained of the straightnes of time.
Nor refused either to haue answered or replied, if the Popes legate had bene president at it.
But who seeth not that this is no indifferencie? but what argument bring ye to proue that the Popes legate should be president thereof? Especially considering (say you) that aboue ten hundreth yeares past, in disputations of matters of faith, whereto the Catholikes were prouoked in Aphrica, the saide Catholikes required, that at the saide disputations should be present the Legates of the sea of Rome, as the chiefe and principall sea of Christendome.
Ye forget M. St. that in Aphrica likewise, the Catholikes refused the B. of Rome his anthoritie, and detected his falshoode in forging of Canons therefore.
And let vs sée your argument, which in effect is this: Aboue ten hundreth yeres past, when the sea of Rome florished in more perfect religion and faith, the Catholickes of Aphrica, in their disputations of faith, required that at the sayd disputations, should be present the Legates of the sea of Rome, as the chiefe principall sea of Christendome.
Ergo: We now, in all our disputations of causes Ecclestastical, especially concerning the supremacie, should acknowledge the Pope by his Legates, to be president thereof.
This argument followeth not M. Stapl. reasoning, from that tune to this, from their requiring to our submission, from Aphrike to England, from presence to presidence, from certaine questions to all questions, from matters of saithe to these in hande, which your selfe say are nons.
From the chiefe and principall sea then, to the vniuersall supremacie that the Pope claymeth now, in all which pointes there is no sequele, and therefore your argument is starke naught, nor all your vayne excuses, will hide their frowarde disobedience, or strengthen the weaknesse of their naughtie cause in the saide disputation.
But let vs now (saith M. St.) returne to M. Horne, for these matters were [undefined span alphabet], M. Stapleton looked quite besides his marke.
THe third Diuision sheweth the cause and occasion, why M. Feck. deliuered this his treatise to the Bishop, not as he pretendeth to be resolued at the Bishops handes, for he had sayd before that the matter it selfe was grounded here (pointyng to his brest) that shall neuer go out.
But, beyng charged of the B. herefore, that he had neither conscience nor constancie, M. Feckenham shewed and deliuered this his treatise to the B. to shew what he had suffred for the same, and how it was grounded and setled in him long before.
Which argueth first his falshood in pretending to haue offred the booke before to the B. as scruples by him to be resolued in: And also his furder falshood, in setting forth of his owne bald resolutions to his scruples, vnder the B. name.
To the former parte M. Stapleton replieth it is an vnlikely tale, and referreth it to his score of vntruthes.
The later parte for the resolutions, he leaueth it to a place more apropriate, where the matter shalbe more conueniently and more fully discused.
And this is all that he saith for the cléering of M. Feckenhams false title.
MAster Feckenham in the beginning of his treatise, propounding one chiefe purpose and entente (as he saithe) of this Othe, to be for a more sauegarde to be had of the Queenes royall person, and her highnesse most quiet and prosperous raigne: Offreth to sweare thus muche, that her Highnesse is the onely supreme gouernour of this Realme, and of all other her Highnesse dominions and Countries, according as the expresse woordes are in the beginning of the sayde Othe.
And offreth yet furder to sweare: That her Highnesse hath vnder God the souerainetie and rule, ouer all manner of persons, borne within these her Highnes realmes, of what estate either Ecclesiasticall or Temporall soeuer they be.
To this the B. of Winchester answereth, that this beyng one chiefe entent of the Othe, as is graunted: whosoeuer denieth the chiefe parte of the Othe, what soeuer in wordes he pretende, in his deedes denieth withall the chiefe entent therof.
But M. Feckenham doth thus, Ergo: How soeuer by woordes he would seeme to tender her Maiesties safetie, his deedes declare his meanyng to be cleane contrarie.
The Minor that M. Feck. denieth the principall parte of the Othe, he proueth thus: The principallest parte of the Othe, is the Q. Highnes supremacie in causes Ecclesiasticall so well as Temporall, but about this M. Feck. dalieth with dominions and persons, denieth the causes, which is the matter it selfe, wherein the gouernance doth consist: Ergo, He denieth the chiefest parte of the Othe.
The Maior, that the gouernance in Ecclesiasticall causes is the chiefest thing that the Othe doth purporte, is euident.
The Minor, as it appereth by this nice daliance of M. Feck. so the B. furder proueth it, by this his treatise, by his deepe sighes grones, desiring a change, and ascribing to the Pope this principall parte of the Othe.
M. St. to counterblast these the B. arguments, bloweth apace with bothe his chéekes.
With the one breathing out dispitefully all riffe raff, that he coulde gleane togither, to deface, as he thought, the protestantes with disobedience.
With the other he laboreth to qualifie the disobedience of the Papists, namely of M. Feckenham.
But before these two partes, wherein the most of his replie consisteth, he prefixeth yet one page, declaring first that this parcell of the Othe, is no parte of the Princes royall power, and wherefore the Papists refuse the same.
First saith he, There haue bene many kings in this realme before our time, that haue raigned vertuously, quietly, prosperously, most honorably, and most victoriously, which neuer dreamed of this kinde of supremacie, and yet men of such knowledge, that they could soone espie, wherein their authoritie was empayred, and were of such courage and stoutnesse, that they would not suffer at the Popes handes, or at any other, any thing done derogatorie to their Royall power.
This argument standeth vpon the opinio~ of Princes heretofore, and is framed thus.
What soeuer the noble and prosperous Kinges to fore, tooke to be so, or tooke not to be so, the same was and is so, or was not and is not so.
But many noble and prosperous Kings heretofore, tooke this kinde of supremacie to be no parte of their royall power: Ergo, It was not, nor is any parte thereof.
The Maior, which God wote is very fonde and weake, he would furnishe and strengthen with their wisedome and stoutnesse, if it had bne iniuriou to their authoritie, they were so wise they could soone espie it, were so stoute they would not suffer it.
But who seeth not, that they could not very soone espie it, in that palpable darknesse of poperie: and that worldly politike wisedome, is no good proofe of soone espying the spirituall wisdome of God and his worde, and of their dutie in setting forth thereof? This knowledge was not so clerely espied then, as thanks be to God now it is, being pulled fro~ vnder the bushell, wherewith it was couered, and the Angel of darknesse, being stripped out of that shape of the Angell of light, that when he was cladde withall, be bleared many wise Princes eyes.
And though many of them were coragious stoute, yea espied to, what belonged vnto them, attempted also to get it, yet who seeth not, that the Popes tirannie ouermatched them? And yet suche Princes were there many, wise, stoute, and vertuouse, that dreamed not as you say, but well saw this their authoritie, and tooke it on them, and withstood the Popes vsurpation.
Which improueth your Maior, that ye would séeme to cary away so cléere.
And withall ouerturneth your argument, by the like: Some Princes thought it was no parte of their royall power: Ergo, it was not.
Some Princes thought it was parte of their royall power: Ergo, it was.
Neyther of these argumentes (ye sée) doth holde, for still the matter is where it was, who thought so, or who thought not so, and yet bothe of them politike, stout, and prosperous Princes.
But whereto doth M. St. thus colourably, so highly extoll the vertuous, quiet, prosperouse, most honorable, and most victorious estate, of those noble, wise, stoute, and coragious princes, that (he saith) neuer heretofore dreamed of this kinde of supremacie? can he dreame out this so drylie, against his most gratious soueraigne, the Q. Maiestie now, that not only of right claymeth, but most godly directeth this supremacie, to blemish her highnesse with her noble auncesters, and thinketh he this his byiouse nippe, could not easily be espied? Yes M. Stapleton, it is easie to sée your good harte, and what opinion ye haue of her highnesse.
But albeit comparisons be odious, chiefly of the liuing with the dead, De quibus nil nisi bonum, whom we ought to speake reuerently vpon: yet notwithstanding, thus muche may say, without derogating from them, or lattrie of her, (for he flattreth not that saith that which eche true man findeth true) her highnesse in no point that you recken, is inferiour to any her royall progenitors, in many farre greater pointes, that ye recken not, doth farre surmount them all.
Which speake not to boast of, but that God, whose giftes they are, make her thankful for them, vs thankful for her.
And therefore, go the matter by wisedome, fortitude, quietnes, vertue, honorable, prosperous and victorious raigne, her Maiestie that claymeth this title, her Brother, and Father before her also, haue as good plea for them, as any other princes of England can haue, that neuer claymed the same.
And therefore leaue this crake M. St. of vpbrayding to her highnesse, the good giftes of her predecessours, for thankes be to God (that hath giue~ hir all the same or more) hir grace hath had hitherto a most quiet, prosperous and victoriouse raigne, and yet hath claymed and enioyed this supreme gouernment withall, yea, the one hath strengthned the other: And God for his mercy co~tinue prosper hir maiestie long therein.
And in déede this is that ye whine at, that God stil so prospereth the successe of his Gospell by her: so God hath promised, cun{que} honori ficauerit me· glorificabo eum, thus he glorified Salomon, when he sought the wisedome truth of God, before the riches might of worldly Princes, so hath God blessed her Highnesse aboue many Christian princes, for that she directeth all her gouernment, to the setting forth of his glory.
Peccator videbit irascetur, all you Popish enimies beholding and gnashing your téeth thereat.
But who would thinke M. Stapl. were one, or the Papists any, they haue of him so swéete and fine a proctor, with so fayre wordes to couer so foule disobedience.
And albeit (saith he) the Catholikes wishe to the Q. Maiestie, as quiet, as prosperous, as lo~g· as honorable an Empire, to the glory of God, as euer had Prince in the world, are as wel affected to her highnes, as euer were good subiectes to their noble Princes aforesaide: Ye recken not vp so many times as as as, as as as as, as he were a very asse, that would beleue you for all your goodly wishes and painted affections, such faire wordes may make fooles faine, and beleue that all is golde that glistreth.
But what in harte you wishe, and in déede you attempt, her grace hath tried throughly, all men well perceyue.
But God sendeth a curst cow short hornes: God sende her Maiestie long safetie, fro~ the fained teares of such wel wishing Crocodiles.
And the~ with ye grace of God, she shall do wel inough, maugre all hollow harted Papists.
But go to now, tell on M. Stap. if ye wish her highnes thus wel as ye wold séeme, why refuse ye your duetiful obedie~ce? Albeit (say you) the catholikes wishe thus, yet can they not finde in their harts to take the Othe, not for any sinister affectio~ &c. but onely for conscience sake, grou~ded vpon the Canons and lawes of the holy church, and the continuall practise of all christian and Catholike realmes, finally vpon holy Scripture; namely that saying of S. Peter, portet obedire Deo magis quàm hominibus, God must be obeyed more than men.
Is not here a fayre cloke to couer the Papists disobedie~ce to their Prince withall? all whose open stubbornesie, and priuie practises against their Prince countrie, are not forsooth of any sinister affection, but euen for conscience sake.
But what manner a conscience is this that ye do it for M. Stapl.? is it not such an other conscience, as Sir Thomas More telleth the Wolfe had? to whom when the Foxe his ghostly father enioyned him penance for his rauening, that he should neuer after, deuoure any thing that he thought in his conscience was aboue the value of sixe pence, the penitent Wolfe afterward, seing a fat cow with her calfe feeding in a medow, being hungrie and gréedie of his pray, yet durst he not breake his ghostly fathers rule, till he had examined in his conscience the price of them: On my conscience ({quod} the Wolfe) this cowe is but worth a groate, and then of conscience can her Calie be hardly worth halfe as muche.
Now if you M. Stapl. and your fellowes haue this woluish conscience, to deuoure the shéepe of Christ, the cow and calfe and all, to burne the people of God, to persecute his truth, to betray your countrie to strangers, to disobey your naturall Prince, and so can set your conscience, that all is done for conscience: then, as, many haue to little consciences, so you haue a great deale to much.
But to shew that your conscience is no better, pray ye whereon is it grounded? Grounded vpon the Canons lawes of the holy Church, and the co~tinual practise of all Christian and catholike realmes.
Do ye ground your consciences vpon the Canons lawes of the church, that is, vpo~ the practise of man? this is but a sandie grou~d, (M. St.) for a christian co~science (in a matter of religio~, that ye say, is the waightiest of all points in controuersie, the fountaine of al other) to be builded founded vpon.
And yet the one of these groundes, is a manifest lying crake, of the continuall practise of all Christen realmes, which ye haue not yet proued, crake of it, and grounde your conscience on it, when ye haue proued it, for before, ye do but set your conscience on the tenterhookes, to presume of that ye haue not proued.
The other is euen the wolues conscience vp and downe, that grounded his conscience of his owne gréedie desire, so you grounde your conscience on the canons and lawes of the holy Church.
And what is the holy Church with you, on your conscience? Forsooth on our conscience holy Church, is our selues, that be the Bishops, Monkes, Friers, and priestes.
We (say you) are the holy Churche, and our owne lavves and canons, are the lawes and canons of holy Church, and all that is giuen to vs, is giuen to holy Churche.
And so ye grounde your consciences after your owne lawes and Cannons, as the wolfe did after his.
Are not these good woluishe consciences? But haue ye no better grounde of your conscience than these two? yes, say you, finally we ground our consciences vpon holy Scripture, namely that saying of S. Peter, oporte obedire deo magis quam hominibus, God must be obeyed more than men.
In déede M. St. if ye can make this a grounde, it is a much surer grounde than the other twayne, the sacred worde of God, and the obedience that ye owe to God.
Howbeit sithe euery pretence of obedience to God, and euery wresting of Gods worde, is no good grounde of conscience: neither the worde of God, nor the obedience to God, taketh away the obedience that is due to the Prince: Howe do ye frame your argument, from S. Peters saying? God muste be obeyed more than man.
Ergo, the Q. Maiestie can not be obeyed for supreme gouernour vnder God, in all ecclesiasticall causes within hir dominions.
This argument is so fonde, it might serue any traytor, or any other to disobey his Prince, vnder pretence of conscience: and therefore can not cleare you from the sighes and grones, that ye make for your foresayde change, where with the Bishop rightly chalengeth M. Feckenham.
These arguments nowe pretending conscience, béeing not sufficient to discharge the Papistes of disobedience, M. St. addeth to them two more, the one, by obiecting the like to vs: that we sighe and grone for the change of other princes, nor affected in religion as we be.
And so he thinketh to put away this reason from them selues, that the B. maketh agaynst them: The Papistes do not obey but impugne the Q. Maiesties authoritie, Ergo, they wishe and looke with diepe sighes and groanes, for a change therof.
The other argument that M. St. maketh agaynst this, he frameth thus: diuers papists haue lost their goods, and are ready to lese their life, Ergo, they wishe not for this change.
This argument as it serueth no more their cause, than any other heretikes: so it followeth not, but rather the contrarie, that the more they léese, the more they wishe the change.
And to shew this, as one that had forgotten himselfe, whyle he craketh what witte, body, and lyfe, he would employ for his prince and countrey, adding withall this exception, if the case so require: he bursteth out into a diepe sighe and groane for a change, saying: And for my parte pray God hartily the tryall once woulde come.
What case is this ye speake off so doubtfully master.
St. if it be not a change? that leauing your argumente, ye fall thus deuoutly to your beades, pray so hartily, promising to employ your pregnant witte, your proper body, yea venture your life and all, that once it might come, if it be not a change? if ye meane well, why be you not at home, and in your natiue countrey employ your witte body, like a good subiect as ye ought to do, but subtract your bodie, and bende your witte, your body, and all your endeuour, by all malicious practises, agaynst hir Malesties authoritie herein· abusing dayly, not onely by suche your inuectiue Pamphlets dispearsed abroade in hucker mucker, hir Maiesties subiectes here quiet at home, to make them mislike hir Highnesse regiment: but also to slaunder hir abroade to other Nations, besides your continuall whisperers, whom ye sende aboute, instilling into the peoples heades, a hope or feare of a chaunge to come: bearing the people in hand, euen from hir Maiesties first raigne, that the nexte Easter, the nexte Midsomer, the nexte Michelmas, the nexte Christmas, the nexte quarter, the nexte halfe yeare, the nexte yeare, we shall haue a chaunge.
And thus from yere to yeare ye fode them on, with vayne hope, nourishing priuie rebellion in their hearts, or at least, to make the people to faynt and murmure, as the searchers of the lande of promise, did to the children of Israell.
But God be blessed, that hitherto hath defeated all your blinde prophesies.
He will confounde the hypocrites hope, and establishe his truthe for euer.
Nowe to put away this cryme from the Papists, and to charge vs therewith, he alledgeth first, the practise of the Paynims and Ievves, and Heretikes.
The effecte of hys argument is this: Diuers Heretykes vsed greate cruelties and seditions, for that they misliked the contrarie religion to theirs: Ergo; the Papistes misliking the Quéenes maiesties authoritie, and wishing a chaunge thereof, make not in so dooing, a preparation to sedition, but we that acknowledge the same, do make it.
And if hotte burnyng, cruell handeling, trayterous poysoning, pitifull murdering, horrible tragedies, tragicall enormities, priuie and great conspiracies, (all which he obiecteth to vs in the sustian fumes of his boystrous Rhetorike) be arguments of Paynims Iewes, or Heretikes: then one better than the Papistes haue deserued those titles.
And here, as he thinketh, béeing gotten into a plentyfull ayne, he runneth into Germanie, Denmarke, Swethlande, Englande, Fraunce, and Scotlande, fro~ these to the low countreys of Brabant, Hollande, Flaunders, and Lukelande, from thence to Monster, then to the Duke of Saxonie, and the Lantgraue of Hesse, agayne to Denmarke and Swethlande, and for his witnesse, he bringeth in one as good as him selfe, Frederike Staphilus.
From thence sodenly to Charing crosse and to Towre hill, then haue ouer the water agayne to Fraunce, Piemont, Geneua, Gascoigne, Rhone, Orleance, Lions, skipping in and out, and it were a Iacke of Bedlam, raking euery corner to picke quarels, and deuise lyes by the Protestants.
And what proofe of all this alledgeth he? forsooth, referre you M. Horne, to an oration made of this matter expressely, and pronounced here in Louayne, and translated eloquently, and printed in our Englishe tongue.
Naye, then it must néedes be true M. St. who dare gainesay it, if suche a man of credence as you, will referre all these discourses vnto that oration, yea and that it was pronounced among you in Louayne, where, God wot, neuer lye is pronounced, yea, and besides all this, it is translated eloquently in our Englishe tongue, and printed too: these are sore arguments promise you, as euer heard so wise a man make, to proue the truth of all thse accusations, that ye lay to the protestants charge.
But M. Stap. and ye would follow my councell, ye should let all these by quarels go, and referre your selfe to your matter.
But ye wil first make an other vagarie, and sée the countreys once agayne, so may ye write vs ouer lies owe by authoritie, as ye do full handsomly, for after ye haue bene at Scotlande, and are returned to your lovve countreys of Flaunders, we haue fiue leaues togither entituled the rebellion of Flaunders, with a swarme of reprocheful staunders, to deface the Gospell with sedition, hurli brlies, and disobedience: when all the world séeth, the authors of al those tumults, to be the Papists them selues.
At length remembring him selfe that all these lyes, are no good purgation for the Papists, for the ful proofe of their obedience.
Now for the purgation of the Catholikes (sayth he) agaynst whom this man so falsly and malitiously bloweth his horne, it may seeme a good and conuenient proofe of their quietnesse and obedience, that all this eyght yeres more, there hath not bene in this realme, no not one that can heare of, that hath bene conuicted of any disloyaltie, for worde or deede, concerning the Princes ciuil regiment: which they all wishe were as large and ample, as euer was our noble countrymans the great Constantines.
You blow your pipe like a subtile flatterer, howsoeuer he bloweth his horne, M. St.
The ioly ciuill regiment, that ye wishe hir highnesse, is in the ende no better, as your selfe afterwarde shew, when ye come to the definition therof, than ye can aforde to the very Turke, and therfore hir Maiestie is much beholding to you, and hath very loyall subiectes of you.
Yea you are (as ye commende your selfe, if we may beléeue you on your owne reporte) suche obedient subiects, that all this eyght yere and more there hath not bene, no not one conuicted of any disloyaltie, for word or deede, that you can heare of.
Ye do wisely, M. Stap. to mitigate the matter by your owne hearing: ye coulde heare all things that sounded agaynst the Protestants, wherein you were as quicke of telling as of hearing.
But for any thing, that should sounde agaynst the Papists, although it rang in the eares of all men, ye haue on your haruest eares.
But and if ye coulde haue heard on that side the eare, that sheweth out the Papistes practises, ye shoulde haue hearde of many their conspiracies, and other their wicked attempts, bysides their muttrings that they dare not vtter, which if they durst, no doubte ye shoulde heare thereof.
Did ye neuer heare of one that wrote, Quod non est tutum scribere contra eos qui possun prescribere? Well, it was written and printed at Louayne also, no doubt of an obediente subiecte, but he Englished it not, for feare all Englishemen shoulde haue séene his Diuels Paternoster, and haue espied hys trayterous heart, that no will wanted in him, to directe his penne, so farre as he durst, against his most gratious soueraigne: and shall we thinke, if he could with safetie atte~pt further agaynst his prince, that he woulde spare his vttermoste? Well, ye knowe him, dare say, at least ye haue heard of him, for he taketh him selfe a nere friend of yours, and spake it, besides many mo trecherous wordes agaynst his Prince, euen within this your limitation of eight yeres, and lesse: but will not bewray him, although your partiall dealing be not to be borne withall.
To diffame the Protestants, ye haue runne at randon, and raked togither, all that ye could deuise, from Paynims, lewes, and heretikes, and all other, true or false, for this.
yeres, in euery countrey, all that ye could heare of, or inuent any thing to slaunder the Gospel by.
On the contrarie, for your owne partie, ye could rember your selfe, but of eight yeres onely in Englande.
Where euen in your sayd eight yeres, had ye but opened your other eare, to vnderstande but those Frenche and Flemmishe matters, that were done harde by you, you might haue heard of such fetches, practises, murthers, conspiracies, and other suche horrible enterprises of the Papists: that your eares would haue glowed on your head, to haue heard but a quarter of them reported truely.
But letting go these eight yeres, may it please ye to rember, if not of olde times, the continuall broyles, seditions, conspiracies, and rebellions, that your Pope Popelings, haue exercised christian princes and their realmes withall: as in Germanie, Henry the.
In Fraunce, king Childeprik, Philip le Beaw, Philip de Ualois.
In Italie, the factio~s of the Guelphes, Gibellines, the Albi Nigri.
In Rome, the hurlie burlies with the Consull people for their auncient libertie.
In England, the troubles of king Iohn, and king Henry the.
If not all these many moe: yet pray you remember the late rebellions of the North, of Lincolne shire, of Deuonshire, the attempts of cardinall Poole, in the time of king Henry the eyghte, of Kettes rebellion, of the Westerne mens vprores in king Gowardes time.
All moued by the Papists, good paternes of Popishe obedience and loyaltie to their Princes warrant you.
But al this M. S. could neuer heare of, nor any other thing else that sou~ded against the~.
And here, as though they were so cleare and innocent from all disobedience, returning agayne to his former prete~ce of conscience and religion, as though he were the proctor of the Papists: VVe poore Catholikes (sayth he) most humbly vpon our knees, desyre hir highnesse, that we may vvith moste lovvly submission, craue and require to be borne vvithall.
And were ye downe on your marybones in déede, M. St. when ye wrote this? but why shuld we not thinke so? since that (to haue hir highnesse the better behold you, how humbly ye knéele) ye are run to Louayne, belike that she might sée you knéeling ouer ye seas, bicause she could not sée you so néere as here at home.
What a mockerie is this, most stubbornely to disobey hir gouernement, to forsake hir Maiesties dominions, and your natiue cou~trey, and liue in other Princes territories, as subiect to them, not to your natural Soueraigne, to sollicite, not onely by priuie whisperers, hir Highnesse subiects to a misliking of hir gouernement, but by open writing to deface, to slaunder, and inueighe agaynst the same: and all the while moste humbly kneeling, vvith most lovvly submissio~, desiring, crauing, requiring.
If this be your most humilitie, and most lovvly submission if this be your maner of desiring, crauing, requiring, how intollerable and tyrannicall, was your violent and proude authoritie? when Emperours were fayne to go barefoote, knéele vnto, and kisse the feete of your Pope, and with muche adoo and great labour, obtayne thus muche fauour at his holynesse, to lye prostrate and be troden vnder his féete, when al Princes and people créeped, crouched, and stoode in dreade, of almoste euery pelting Priest.
M. St. to come home, and doe your duetie, as good subiectes ought to do.
Shewe that lowly submission, that is necessarie, and then craue that is requisite, and so may ye easily finde hir highnesse mercifull and gratious to you.
But what is it, that after this mocking sort ye pretende to craue so earnestly? To be borne withall, if we can not vpon the sodayne, and without sure and substantiall grounds, abandon that faythe that vve vvere baptised in.
Sée what a wicked slaunder to couer your disobedie~ce, ye charge your most gratious prince withall: as though she went about to make you renie that fayth ye vvere baptised in.
And this ye doe euen where ye pretende to kneele on your knees, vvith moste humble and lowely submission.
Sée what cankred hearts ye beare, for all your counterfayte crouching.
If ye knowe, M. Stap. the fayth ye were baptised in, at least, if ye were rightely baptised, and be a true Christian man, it is not in the name, fayth, or obedience of the Pope, but in the name, fayth, and obedience of the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost, and this fayth, the Q. maiestie goeth so little about, to haue you abandon, that hir Graces supreme gouerneme~t is chiefly directed to this end, to haue ye without any superstition, error, idolatrie, or any other pollution therof, kéepe maintein it inuiolate, as in baptisme ye promised to do, and therfore this is not subiect like, though ye be on your knees neuer so muche, to accuse hir highnesse, as to cause ye to abandon the fayth ye were baptised in.
She requireth ye to kéepe it, not abandon it, neither on the soden, nor at leisure.
And if this were all the cause of your refusall of obedience, as hir Grace neuer denied you it, ye doe but slaunder hir: so néeded ye not haue runne away, nor shew yet such disobedience to hir authoritie, since she euer graunted and maynteined the thing ye séeme to craue.
Howbeit your counterfeite humilitie detecteth it selfe, to be very stubborne disobedience.
And that while ye pretende to craue one thing, ye entende another thing.
And that is, ye would be borne with, still to refuse her graces supreme authoritie ouer you in Ecclesiasticall causes, this is the thing in deede ye meane: and ye would the rather be borne withall, bicause it is a matter that commeth vpon the sodaine, therefore ye can not vpon the sodaine graunt it.
Weightie matters require not to be done on a sodeyne passion, but with deliberation· But is this so sodeyne a matter yet vnto you? did ye neuer heare of this questio~ before? haue ye not had leasure to deliberate thereon? but who seeth not, that and ye had neuer so much leasure, this matter would still come vpon the sodeyne to you? and of reason ye must haue time to take aduisement vpo~ it, which you will take all at your leasure, and so for feare ye should become an obedient subiect vpon the sodeyne, ye craue to remayne still vpon deliberation an obstinate enemie.
But M. St. prete~ding this refusall to be for the abandoning of the faith that we were Christened in, procéedeth: And as we are assured all our auncetours, and her Maiesties owne most noble progenitours, yea her owne most noble father King Henrie the eight, yea that faith, which he in a clerkly booke hath most pithily defended, and thereby atchieued to him and his, and transported as by hereditarie succession, the worthie title and stile yet remayning in her Highnesse, of the Defendour of the Faith.
As ye slaunder most wickedly the Quéenes Maiestie, to cause ye to abandon the faith of your baptisme· so ye slaunder not only al our auncestors but that most famouse Prince her highnesse Father K. Henrie the
as christened in the faith of the Popes obedience: hereof ye say, ye are assured, when it is most assured most euident false.
For although our fathers, the Q. Maiesties father also, yea many of vs our selues, the Q. Maiestie also her selfe, were borne and baptised, when all the errours of poperie, or many of them did chiefly abounde: yet can no more any one of these, be said now, to be baptised in those errours, that they helde which baptised them, (if they kept the right formall words of baptisme, baptise thée in the name of ye Father, of the sonne, of the holy Ghost:) tha~ in the old time any of their childre~, or they themselues, could be saide to be baptised in such errours, as they helde that were Nouatians, Donatists, Rogatists, Pelagians, or any other Heretikes, that notwithsta~ding kept the right element formal words of baptisme.
Neither can any Papist say now to any, that dissuadeth him from his popish errours, that he goeth about to will him, to abandon the faith wherein he was baptized: any more tha~ a Pelagian, or any such Heretike, being moued to forsake his heresie, could prete~d he were moued to forsake the faith, he was baptised in, bicause they that baptised him, yea his auncesters before him, were Pelagians, &c. Ye should therefore M. St. make your distinction, betwene the faith of your baptisme, and the faith that your popish Church putteth in diuers erronious pointes of doctrine.
As for the faith that K. Henrie the the Q. Maiesties most noble Father, set out in the Booke that ye mencion, therby labour to stayne the Q. Maiestie, as setting out a contrarie faith to her father: as you for your parte M. St. shew your extreme malice, nothing subiectlike, to blemish her highnesse with the famous renown of her father, which notwithstanding ye ca~ not do: so for the King her father, answere you, howbeit his booke were clerkly, yet clerklines is one thing, truth is an other.
what maruel if he the~ wrote, in defence of your doctrines, whe~ your popish prelates hid ye very truth fro~ him, bore him in hand, that your falshoodes were truth? till it pleased God, not to suffer so noble a Prince, to be any longer deluded by such false prelates, but first in this question, after in other, according to the measure of his merciful riches, reueled the truth vnto him: how chance, ye speake not of his faith then, what clerkly sincere doctrine he set out the~, against your Pope? And as for the Q. Maiestie herein, (which is the proper questio~ now in ha~d) followeth most zealously the steppes of her highnesse father, not wherein he was abused, as many other princes were, by false teachers, but in that he forsooke those errours, he abolished those false teachers, their captaines vsurped authoritie, in yt he obeyed the truth reueled to him, before all his own clerkly bookes, before all worldly glory securitie, aduentured himselfe his kingdome, against all his enemies, in setting forth the truth, gouerning his subiects after ye word of God.
Which though it were not so plentifully set forth then, nor all wéedes so thoroughly rooted vp, by reason of some false Gardiners, whom he trusted ouer much (howbeit at le~gth thanks be to God he espied them also, had procéeded furder if God had lent him furder life) yet is he rather to be commended for that he did, than to be euil spoken or euell thought of, for that he could not throughly bring to passe in his time, but left his most vertuouse Sonne King Edwarde, to bring to more perfection.
And herein hath the Quéenes highnes followed, as ye say, both her Fathers and Brothers faith also.
But ye wring al to that faith, wherein he was before beguiled, as though she should follow him in that he was deceiued, not wherein he founde out forsoke the deceyuers, that you with your painted wordes might likewise deceyue her Highnes now, as they deceued her Maiest father then.
But sée how God turned their deceyt agaynst them selues.
That where your Pope, to flatter K. Henrie withall, ascribed to him this title (as it were the prophecie of another Caiphas) Defender of the faith, the King espying the falshood of ye Pope, became the very defender of the true faith in déede, abolishing the Pope the very impugner peruerer therof, and so (as you say truer than ye wist, M. Stap.) atchieued to him and his, and transported as by hereditarie succession, the worthy title and stile yet remaining in her Highnesse, of the defendour of the faith.
Neither as you faintly say, this title onely remayneth in her Highnes, but the thing that the title doth entende, her highnesse is in very déede, not in a aked name, the defender thereof: And hath defended her subiects, not from foreyne power of straungers onely, brought in by the Papistes, and from all bodily iniurie and oppression of Popish firebrandes, or any other tirannie: but defendeth euen our faith from all errours, heresies, superstitions, and Idolatries.
And this it is for a Prince to be a defender of the faith in déede: which argueth a plaine supremacie.
Now after M. Stapl. hath thus flattred, and on his knees humbled him selfe, to obtayne a placard of their disobedience: vp he starteth once againe, and geueth another fling at vs, to reuerse this crime of disobedience on vs, thinking so to excuse this disobedience of the Papistes thereby.
And first he setteth on those, whome he calleth round cap Ministers, howbeit if he remembred, that within this hundreth yeres and vpward, the popish priestes themselues did weare round cappes, he would not be so hastie to giue that nick name.
He asketh who are those that haue preached with a chaine of golde about their neckes, in steade of a tippet? Assoyle your question your selfe M. Stapl.
What slaunderous reporte you haue heard of any singuler person know not, no such order is alowed.
Although it be common among your popish Cardinals, Bishops, Abbottes, Deanes, Canons, and other beyonde the Seas, so to ruffle as ye speake, not onely with a chayne of golde, but with hatte and feather, cappe and agglets, rapier and cloke, hawke and houndes, ruffians fooles wayting on them, and oftentimes in complete harneys on a great courser, or on a palfrey with a courtisane behinde them, thus go the chiefest of your fleshly spiritualtie: belike they learned it of that royster Pope Iohn.
Upbrayd not therefore such petit and perticular things to vs, which is so great and so common a fault with you.
But Master Stapleton will go more certainely to worke, and charge the Protestantes ex scripto wyth their owne writings.
VVho are those pray you (sayth he) that write, sint sanè ipsi Magictratu membra, paries, ciues ecclesidei, imo vt ex toto corde sint, omnes precari decet.
Flagrent quo{que} ipsi zelo pietatis, sed non sint capita Ecclesi, quia ipsis non competit iste
Let the Magistrates also be members, and partes, and citizens, of the Church of God, yea and that they maye bee so it behoueth vs all wyth all our heart to praye.
Let them bee feruent in the godly zeale of Religion, but they may not be heades of the Churche, in no case, for thys supremacie doth not appertaine to them.
These are no Papists trow M. Horne, but your owne dere brethren of Magdeburge, in their new storie ecclesiasticall, by the which they would haue all the worlde directed.
Yea in that storie wherof one percell, Illiricus and his fellowes haue dedicated to the Queenes maiestie, that beare the worlde in hande they are the true and zelous schollers of Luther.
Thus triumpheth M. Stapleton against the wryters of the storie of Magdeburge.
These wryters do say that Princes may not be heades of the Church, Erg no prince ouer all Ecclesiasticall persons causes in his owne dominions, may be supreme gouernour.
Howe euill this argument followeth is easie to perceyue, and the better, in behlding howe impudently master Stapleton wresteth these wryters.
But he forceth not thereof, bicause they be his aduersaries.
For that which they write, not simplie agaynst the supremacie of princes in Ecclesiasticall causes, but agaynst suche supremacie of princes, as the Pope vsurped: that wresteth he as spoken agaynst such supreme gouernment, as the Quéenes maiestie claymeth and vseth.
The writers hereof, hauing set forth two nsamples of that age, the one of a godly princes gouernmet, by Constantinus Pogonotus: the other of a wicked tyrant, by eraclius: to declare what kinde of supremacie they disalow.
Thy she we that this is the scope of the matter, iste est scopures, {quod} magistratibu politicis, non sit licitum cudere forma religionu~, in perniciem veritatis, ita vel co~cilietur verita, me~daium, vel vtra{que} simul sopiant, id quod tandem um habet exitum, vt regnent errores, veritas crucifigatur, sepeliatur.
This is the cope of the matter, that it is not lawfull for politike magistrates to coyne formes of religion, to the destruction of the truth, so that thereby truth and falsehoode should be reconciled togither, or both of them togither quayled: VVhich at the length commeth to this ende, that errors raigne, the truth is crucified buried.
And so followeth the sentence that M. St. citeth, let the magistrates also be mebers. &c. but let them not be heades of the Church.
And this they do not once nor twise, setting forth the doings of the wicked yrant Heraclius for ensample, that was altogither led by affection, and not indifferent to heare ither party, nor called in counsell lerned and faithfull men, nor called any synode to trie the matter, nor serched ye truth diligently, but being puffed vppe with pride, and deuising oely with a flattring Monke (that after set vp the false fayth of Mahomet) determineth in a corner of a moste weightie controuersie, and afterwardes will haue the matter neuer called into question.
This Emperour they call Architectum religionis, and demaund what man well in his wittes, woulde alowe such attempts, processe and executions? concluding it is not lawfull form as religionum conflare. &c.
To make newe formes of religions, and obtrude them to the Church without all kind of godly, honest, modest and comely gainsaying refuting therof.
All this and much more, say they, of that kinde of supreme gouernement in Princes that they mislyke, and is in déede to be vtterly mislyked of all Christians.
But as this is a plaine description of your Popes supremacie, that playeth in all these poynts Heraclius part, so it nothing toucheth that supremacie that the Quéenes maiestie claymeth.
It is but your wicked malice to slaunder hir, with such tyrannicall vsurpation of Heraclius as they condemne.
Whie doe ye not rather take theyr other comparison, from Constantinus Pogonotus, to al other godly Princes, and referre that to hir regiment? With what care, and singuler diligence, trauaile, and godlinesse, when the Churches were horibly deformed, and torne, by the sect of the Monothelites, He summoned the sixt generall Councell, he ouerwhelmed not the debating of the controuersie of doctrine by might or preiudice.
He willed the Ministers of the Churche, and preachers of the worde of God, to searche out which opinion was, and which was not agreable to holye writte.
He regarded not the ensamples of hys auncesters, who by publike Edictes had approued the doctrine of the Monothelites, which was harde for him to abolishe.
Neyther did the authoritie of the Patriarches and Bishoppes, in Constantinople and all ouer the East (that stifly helde that opinion) any thing moue him.
Nor he suffred himselfe to be made afrayde, although he heard that the pryde of the Byshop of Rome was incredible, as one that wickedly chalenged a dignitie and authoritie aboue other Bishops and teachers.
But sent his letters to him, exhorting him to come or sende some other in his place.
Neyther gaue he him any prerogatiue, nor craueth licence of hym to call the Councell, but of hys owne duetie, he defineth him selfe for the appoynting of the Councell.
He louingly biddeth the Romaine and other Bishoppes, not to bee absent at so necessarie matters, and concerning the Churches publike weale.
The Emperour himselfe is present at the Synode, not as a dumbe or deafe person (like a cifer in Algorisme) or receyuing the decrees without iudging of them, or placing the B. of Romes Legates in the chiefest place, and receyuing them without all contradiction (as oracles from them, as it were from Apollos triuet) but modestly, reuerently, and godly, as much as became his calling, he gouerned the Synode, propounding to them the state or scope of the cause, and enquiring on a rowe, gathered their sentences togither, least ought should be done rashly or confusedly.
He commaunded not the one partie, but the contrarie partie also, plainly and without subtilties to declare their opinions, and what groundes they had of their sentences, out of the holye scriptures, and what autenticall witnesse of the approued fathers.
And so forth, they declare, howe indifferently he dealt with either partie, knowing, that he must not condemne any before he knewe the full matter.
And when it was euidently found out, that the Monothelites could not defend their opinion, by the clere testimonies of the scripture, nor any sentences of the doctours allowed, yea when it was founde out, they hacked of purpose certaine of the Doctours sayings, and in place of them cited certeyne sayings falsly fathered in the Doctors names, the~ the Emperor subscribed to the iudgeme~t of al those that thought aright, and earnestly and stoutly executed the condemnation made in the name of them all.
Here these wryters commend this Emperor, the more for that he had about him, no doubt say they, such parasites, as woulde tickle in his eare, that these thinges were vnsitting fo his maiestie to intermeddle him selfe, with the brawles of the Churches pelting Doctours.
It were a blemish to him, to condemne his ancesters, to cal into doubt or retract things already decreed.
Let the bishops alone with the matter, for euen they are able to make lawes agaynst the Emperors estate, and abase it.
The Emperour by his authoritie may do no more than commaund silence, sende into exile, or punish with other violence, those that make clamors, or disobey the councels decree.
But the Emperor not regarding these fancies, thought it honorable to him to be present, in the midst of the teachers of gods worde, assisting not a little the triall and iudgement of the co~trouersie.
This ensample these wryters thus set out, for a princes gouernme~t, dealing, ouersight in the chiefest ecclesiastical causes.
And thus before they determined in generall, that God or deined not Princes to spoile their subiects, and make themselues at.
Neither onely to attende to outward discipline, and that men may liue in honest tranquilitie, for (say they) seing that magistrates are in the scriptures called Gods, this ought to bee their first and chiefest care, that their subiects serue God after such a sorte, that his kingdome in their dominions may bee knowne, encreased, and conserued, that is to were, sincere doctrine.
&c. may be deliuered, remaine, passe fro~ the~ to their posteritie.
To this end tendeth all politike administration, all defence of peace and neighborhod, that laborsome care of getting the liuing gathering goodes: that these spirituall euerlasting goodes both of the body of the mind, should be gotten.
Thus do they stretch out, further than doth M. St. the bounds of a princes gouernment to al ecclesiastical canses.
And all that they write on the other part, is against such a popish supremacie, as establisheth maketh a new religio~ quicquid imperitaerit re.
And yet sée howe spitefully and falsly M. St. wresteth it, as writte~ against the Q. maiestie.
When as he confesseth himselfe, they co~mend hir, euen by the ensample of Constantine, they allow that supreme gouernment that she doth take vpon hir.
Now M. St. after his maner presupposing, we will reiect these writers, as though they spake against the supreme gouernme~t of the Quéene: In case ye thinke (sayth he) theyr testimonie not to haue weight ynough, then herken to your their Apostle Luther, who writeth that it is not the office of kings princes, to co~firm no not the true doctrine, but to be subiect and serue the same.
The effect of this argument is this, princes must not take on them, so to confirme the true doctrine, that they be not subiect therevnto, nor serue, but rule the same: Ergo Princes may not set forth the true doctrine, nor be supreme gouernors in their dominions, ouer all ecclesiastical persons and causes.
And as ye wrested the former writers, so wrest ye Luthers saying also, whose se~tence as it is nothing against the godly gouernment of our most noble soueraigne, subiect to ye principall authoritie of Gods word, that it might be of chiefest authoritie, subduing thereto the authoritie of all other writers, remouing those superstitions, that exalted them selues in authoritie equall, or aboue Gods worde: so this sentence is eftsones, as the other, agaynst such vsurpation, as is euident that your Pope taketh vpon him.
But M. Stapleton dreaming that he hath so sore pressed vs, and this is so harde and straunge a case, that now Luther can take no place amongst vs: he obiecteth another vnto vs, one Andreas Modrenius.
And yet his saying also, maketh (God wote) ful little for the Papists herein.
Who saith there ought to be some one to be taken for the chiefe and supreme head in the whole Church in all causes ecclesiasticall.
What conclude ye M. St. herevpon? Ergo it must be your Pope? or no christian prince? And here as though all these were not yet sufficient testimonies, ye bring in Caluin.
But since ye doe it but to fill vp your booke, with that common allegation of your side, which being also not omitted of M. Fecke~ham, is to be referred, to be propounded and answered vnto in his proper place: therefore remit you thither.
Onely to that ye say, he so spitefully handled King Henrie the eyght, as hee neuer handled the Pope more spitefully, aunswere: this is but your spitefull lie, to deface the Protestantes.
Else why doe ye not proue the same? And as for your Pope it is euident also, he neuer handled him spitefully, but onely reproued his vyces and errours by the worde of God.
But howe spitefullie your Pope and popishe Prelates, so farre as they coulde, handeled him, and howe spitefully they handle all Protestantes, that they maye once sette their spitefull spirituall fingers vppon, all the worlde doeth sée.
And yet the silie Protestantes muste beare all the blame, it is not ynoughe for them to beare the iniuryes.
This lesson ye learned of the Diuell of Dowgate, to bite and whine also, or rather ye doe as Esops Woolfe did, chalenge the poore Lambe for troubling his water, and to misuse him spitefully, but thys mercifull Woolfe, deuoured this spitefull Lambe.
He vrgeth vs farther in great outcryes, with a sentence of one Anthonie Gilbie, our own Countriman.
Anthonie Gilbie an Englishe man, speaketh verie vnreuerently, and vnreligiously, of King Henrie the eight: Ergo the Protestantes now in England, whatsoeuer they pretende and dissemble in wordes, in heart mislike the Quéenes maiesties gouernment.
How doth this follow M. St? and yet ye wrest Anthonie Gilbies sentence also.
He speaketh not of this supremacie neyther, but in plaine wordes, of such a supremacie in England, as ye Pope chalengeth all ouer Christendome.
Though therefore he be greatly to be blamed, for his vnreuerent speach, and for his vnaduised mistaking of hys Princes lawfull authoritie: yet is he not to be belyed, as though he spoke of all kinde of supremacie in all princes simplie.
It is a shame (as they say M. St.) euen to belie the Diuell.
Ye haue brought Anthonie Gilbyes sentence, agaynst vs and the Quéenes maiesties authoritie.
Haue ye not wel holpe~ your self, if this sentence also make flat agaynst your pope? For if (as he sayth, therin truely) Christ ought onely to be the head of the church, the placing of any other displaceth him: then is not the pope the head also, but the placing of him displaceth Christ.
But the Pope chalengeth to be the heade of the Churche also, which our prince doth not: Ergo not our prince, but your Pope displaceth Christ.
And thus thinking to beate vs, ye still make a rodde for your owne Popes tale.
And here sodenly calling to mind, how far he hath straied in forraging out these sentences, he returneth a little to the Bishop, setting on him for calling the Pope the Papists god in earth, the archeheretike of Rome and that M. Fec. would haue him reigne in the Queenes place.
Besturring himselfe with a heape of arguments, to defende his Pope.
Besides his scoffes, raylings, and other rhetoricall floures quoted in his common places.
But first for his Pope sayth he, VVe make no God of the Pope, and sometimes perhaps no good man neyther.
In déede M. Stap. ye should haue more than both your handes full, to make your Pope sometimes a good man· ye néede not put perhaps to the matter.
It would pose him selfe, and all the Diuels in hell, and that oftentymes, to worke such a miracle on him, as, that man of sinne, that childe of perdition, and aduersarie of God, to become a good man.
But yet say beware, howe ye speake such buggishe words of him, as not to be a good man.
Whose wil is law, whose law is all power, in heauen, in earth, in hell.
Beware least this come to his eares M. Stap. and withall, that ye make him not a God in earth.
Are not you of theyr religion, that beléeue and confesse this principle, deus noster Papa: Our Lorde God the Pope? Yea and as some say, he is Plus{que} deu.
If ye be not: whie defende ye him, and his errors, against the truth of God? whie forsake you your most vertuous Prince, to follow a straunger, and that an yll man? but you answere: And yet we reuerence him, for his office, and authoritie, that Christ so amply and honourably gaue him, for preseruation of vnitie and quietnesse in his Church.
That ye reuerence him in déede, and that is more, adore him to, is manifest.
But the patent of that his office and authoritie, that ye crake Christe so amplie and so honorably gaue your Pope, ye shewe none, nor where, nor how, nor when he gaue it: Only ye tell vs of the endes, wherefore he gaue it.
For the preseruation of vnitie and quietnes in his Church.
But if these were the endes M. St. he hath forfeited his patent long ago.
That not onely disagreeth from the expresse wordes and commau~dement of Christ, but swerueth, one Pope from another.
And how chance he setteth his own scholeme~, his Canonists at no better vnitie? his Thomists and his Scotistes, his sects of Religions, at no better quietnes, than a tade a snake togither? how chance he agreeth no better with his Bishops, his own colledge of cardinals? How chance he falleth out so often with Emperours and kings, setteth Princes their subiectes by the eares togither? why fighteth he so fast with both his swordes, like king Arthures dubble sworded knight? why had he rather at this day, that al christendome were in a broyle, so much blud were cruelly shedde, than he would relent one inche of his honour, one penie of his filthie gaine, one ite of his errors, Idolatries, false dectrines, that eue~ are co~fessed of his own secte, giue place to the worde of God? is this his preseruing of vnitie and quietnes, in the Church of Christ? or had he any such patent giuen him, hath he not lost and lost it againe? and will ye still reuerence and adore him, for it? Secondly, where the Bishop calleth your Pope, the archheretike of Rome.
Your wisedome (say you) with like truth also appeareth, in that ye call the Pope the Archeheretike of Rome, naming no man, and so your wordes so liberally wa~tonly cast out, do as well comprehende S. Peter, S. Clement, and other holy Martyrs, and Bishops there, as any other.
The summe of this argumt is this, The Pope now aliue, or to come, (for the B. speaketh of one, that they would haue raigne in the Queenes place) is called an archeheretike: Ergo, S. Peter, S. Clement, and other holy Martyres, are called archheretickes.
His answere to this is thus, promise you a well blowen blast and handsomly handled, answere ye againe M. Stapl.
promise ye this is a well made argument, and handsomly answered.
Ye bragge much for your Pope of S. Peter, and S. Clement, and other holy martyres.
Your Pope doth well M. Stapl to bragge of them, for that is all the neerenesse that he co~meth to them.
S. Peter and those Martyrs were as like your Pope, and he as like them, as Caiphas was like to Christ.
If they saw his deings and his craking of them, they would neuer crake againe of him, but call him archeheretike to.
But he may crake of these holy martyrs, as ye Earle of Warwick craked in king Edward ye fourths daies, that it was a iolier thing to make Kings, than to be him self a King: and so may your Pope bragge, that it is a iolier matter to make martyrs, than to be a martyr him selfe.
He can make saintes he saith, beléeue it, the poore saintes féele it dayly, whose stoles he dippeth in their bloud.
So like is he to s. Peter, S. Clement other holy Martyrs, that where he is none him selfe as were they, yet in that defect, he will reo~pence God, with store of martyrs of his owne making.
And for this resemblaunce, if the Pope be now touched, Peter by by is touched, and he that speaketh generally of the Popes now a dayes, if he name not one certaine Pope, casteth out his wordes wantonly, at S. Peter, S. Clement and other holy Martyrs of the old time.
But and ye had not bene wantonly disposed M. St. your self, you might wel haue perceyued whom the B. meant, nothing the old Bishops of Rome (of whome whether S. Peter were euer any or no, is an other question, and ye are well stripped out of that Lions skinne.)
But he spake plainely, of such Bishops as now vsurping the sea of Rome, ye would haue to raigne in the Queenes place.
VVith like finenesse (say you) ye call him archehereticke that is supreme iudge of all heretickes and heresies to.
answere with the like finenesse ye take that for graunted, that is chiefly denied.
By this fine Sophisticall figure Petitio principij, your finenesse M. St. will hurt you, euery boy in the scooles would hisse out such fine reasoning.
Ye call him archeheretike, (say you) that hath already iudged you and your Patriarches, for archeheretikes.
wiste as well might the fellon at the barre in VVestminster hall, to saue his life if it might be, call the iudge, the strongest theese of all.
And doubtlesse had he a Prince on his side, his plea were as good as yours is.
Let go the Prince M. Stapleton, that is to much trecherie, and more than felonie, though ye liken vs to the fellon, to resemble the Quéenes most excellent Maiestie to an abbettour of theeues and fellons: then will answere your wiste, with an other wiste.
wiste as well the strongest theefe of all, might crie stoppe theefe, by any true man, to saue the pursuite from him selfe, and his crie were as good as the Popes crie, that we, not he, are the archheretikes: and doubtlesse, hauing such confederates on his side as you, to helpe to crie so with him, the theeues crie might séeme more true, than the true mans.
Especially if as you would haue the matter go, that the theefe should be made iudge in his owne case to, when would this theefe condemne him selfe trowe you? do ye not perceyue M. Stapleton, that your comparison fayleth of the indge in VVestminster hall against a fellon? when saw ye there a iudge sit, and giue sentence in his owne cause, him selfe beyng on the one side the principall partie? what Iustice or lawe call you that? you should therefore let VVestminster hall alone, and say, at Rot in Rome, or in the Popes co~sistorie, and where he will site as Iudge on him selfe and vs.
There in déede, he hath Iudged vs to be the archeheretikes, but euen this vniust doyng, sheweth him selfe to be the very archeheretike.
Otherwise if his cause were good, he durst come downe from the bench, and pleade with his aduersaries, the truth or falshood thereof: Which till he do, he plaieth the parte of an archetyrant also.
Now (say you) where ye say we would haue the Pope, to raigne here in the Queenes place, proceedeth from your like truth and wisedome.
For albeit the Popes authoritie was euer chiefe for matters Ecclesiasticall, yet was there neuer any so much a noddie, to say and beleue the Pope raigned here, the Pope and the King, being euer two distinct persons, farre different the one from the other, in seuerall functions and administrations, and yet well concurrant and coincident togither, without any imminution of the one or the others authoritie.
answere, with the like truth and wisdome, as ye reasoned before, so ye frame also this reason.
Ye say (say you) we would haue the Pope to raigne in her place: Ergo, ye say we would haue the Pope to be King.
Hereupon ye make your distinction of raigning, and hauing supreme authoritie, and so ye conclude there was neuer any so much a noddie, to say and beleeue the Pope raigned here.
First your argument is faultie, for, putting the case, ye will not for shame say, that ye would haue him King here, yet if he tooke from her a principall parte of her royall power, did he not then raigne in her place, though he claymed not to be King? and since ye vaunt of wisedome, what a wise distinction is this, of raygning and hauing supreme authoritie, to bleare the simples eyes with woordes? for so farre forth, as he claymeth the supreme authoritie, which he doth in all supreme matters, as are Ecclesiasticall, and that ouer her, so well as any other: so farre foorth he claymeth, to raygne ouer her.
Nowe this being a parte of her royall power, deth he not clayme to raigne euen ouer the principall parte, and so is King thereof? But say you who was euer so much a noddie as to say he raygned here? Sir this noddie is euen your Pope, that maketh this clayme, you your selfe for him.
Do you not here say, (although you greatly lie therin) that he was euer chiefe for matters Ecclesiasticall, and do not all your complices say, that he raigneth for spirituall matters, both here all ouer Christendome? Yea, wil go further, for the temporalties to.
pray you (sauing the reuerence of your noddie who raygned heere, when for certayne dayes the Popes legate, kept the crowne of Englande from king Iohn, and gaue it him agayne, making the king become vassall feodatarie to the Pope, and to holde the crowne and realme of him in fee farme, and pay.
for Irelande? And hath not the Pope chalenged other kingdomes also: yea doth he not clayme to be the chiefe Lorde and Prince of all kingdomes? and to set vp, and depose, what king or prince he pleased? And he that beléeued not this, was not counted a noddie, but an heretike.
And yet sayth M. St. was there euer any so much a noddie, to say and beleeue the Pope raigned here? but all Papistes muste be noddies with him, yea his owne Pope in steade of a triple crowne, muste weare a cockes combe, and him selfe for companie will beare the bell.
But here he leapeth backe agayne to M. Gilbie, not for the matter of supremacie, but for his misliking of certayne orders of religion in king Edwards dayes, and here vpon pleadeth, that the Papistes are nowe more to be borne withal, if they can not beare the seruice, and the title set foorth.
answere, first (M. St.) another mans faults excuse not yours.
For were his greater, or any of those Protestants, that ye vpbrayde vnto vs afterwards, yet are they lesse, in that they obstinately maynteyned not the same, nor persisted therin, nor attempted any conspiracies, nor would haue a foraigne supreme, nor suche an other as your Pope, the father of errors, and so on their submission or repentaunce, their fault is pardoned or made lesse.
But you obstinately maynteine a playne refusall of obedience, would haue a foraigne vsurper be your supreme, and not onely subdue the realme and our bodies to his tyrannie, but our soules to his errors: neither do ye repente therof, but perseuer in it, and by wicked Libels, priuie conspiracies, and all other meanes that ye can, deface Gods worde, your natural prince, natiue countrey: your fault therfore, is much greater tha~ his, or theirs.
And therfore your wilful obstinacie is not to be borne withal, especially since after so long and gentle tollerance of the Quéenes moste gracious lenitie towards you, ye encrease your malice, and harden your hearts with Pharao, abusing hir highnesse lenitie.
Now, where the Bishop sayd, these dealings were a preparation to rebellion agaynst the Queenes person, M. Stap. sayth, that it nothing toucheth hir person, nor hir crowne.
And that without the ecclesiasticall authoritie, the crovvne hath continued and flourished moste honorably many hundreth yeres· and shall by Gods grace continue full well, and full long agayne, when it shall please God.
Why M. Stap. what meane ye by this? dothe not the crovvne flourishe and continue, euen nowe also, God be praysed for it? why say you then, it hath flourished, and shal agayne, when it shall please God, as though it dyd not now.
And the state of the Crovvne were nowe no estate, or a very ill estate, in the reigne of the Quéenes maiestie.
If this be not a preparation to rebellion, to make the Subiectes mislike the estate of the Crovvne, is it not then, euen a rebellious Proclamation it selfe? but let vs sée your argument, that ye make hereon, to excuse your selues.
Diuers Princes haue continued and flourished honorably of long time without the ecclesiasticall authoritie.
Ergo, it is nowe no preparation to rebellion, agaynst the Quéenes person, to refuse hir authoritie ouer all causes ecclesiasticall, and to defende that it apperteyneth not to hir person or Crowne.
First the worde ecclesiasticall authoritie, is very subtilly and doubtfully spoke~, as though hir highnesse went about to play the minister.
The ecclesiasticall authoritie nothing toucheth hir person or crowne· without the whiche it hath most honorably continued and flourished many hundreth yeres, and shall by Gods grace continue, ful wel, and ful long agayne, when it shal please God.
But then is this your most spitefull slaunder, to say, that the Quéene now taketh vpon hir eccl. authoritie, and that it is now vnited to hir person or crowne, which is most euident false.
And therefore the crowne flourisheth, (for any suche matter) so well as euer it did.
And God graunt it neuer to flourish worsse, than it doth vnder hir Maiestie now.
But the antecedent béeing so farre foorth true, as is declared, then the consequent followeth not, that it is now no preparation to rebellio~ to refuse hir authoritie ouer all eccl. causes, and to defende that it perteyneth not to hir person or crowne.
But if in the antecedent by ecclesi. authoritie ye meane authoritie ouer ecclesiasticall matters, then the antecedent is false, and so to be proued, by the issue of the practise in this Realme: Neither is it any good argument.
Bicause many tooke it not on them: Ergo, none may? Bicause they did not vse it: Ergo, they ought not? Bicause they had worldly prosperitie without it: Ergo, it was not necessarie to them? Bicause the denial was no preparation to rebellion then: Ergo, it is none nowe? None of these causes are sufficient, M. St. and therefore your subtile and false reason fayleth.
Now when ye sée nothing will fadge this way, eyther to defende you, or to accuse vs, ye will set vpon vs for other matters, that we are those that make this preparation to rebellion.
Let this title and eccl. iurisdiction goe (say you) which all good princes haue euer forgone, as nothing to them apperteyning: let vs come to the very temporall authoritie, and let vs consider who make any preparation of rebellion, the Catholikes, or the Protestants.
In letting that go, M. Stap. that appertayneth to this title and ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, ye let go your matter, and after your maner, make so many impertinent discourses, contrarie to that ye called vpon before, neuer to swerue from the question in hande, and nowe your selfe swerue of purpose from it.
Howebeit, shall we let you go so rounde away, with suche a heape of notorious lyes, that all good Princes haue euer forgone this title and ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, as nothing to them appertayning? that not some or many, but all good Princes, haue forgone, and euer forgone, both this title, and also ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, and so euer forgone it, as nothing pertayning to them? If ye coulde haue shewed this, ye should haue well spent your time, and kept ye nearer your matter, ye néeded not haue fisked about so many by quarels.
But this could ye not proue, and therfore it was necessarie, ye should runne to them, picking quarels at vs, not marking your owne wicked defacing of your Prince, whome otherwhiles so fauningly ye flatter.
For whereto else tendeth this saying, all good princes haue euer forgone this tytle and ecclesiasticall iurisdiction, as nothing perteyning to them, but to inferre, that all those princes that take on them, or will at any time not forgoe thys title eccl. iurisdiction, as apperteyning to them, are ill and wicked Princes? What else can be made of your saying? And so not onely ye playnly reuile the Lordes anoynted, the Quéenes most excellent maiestie, but also hir highnesse brother and father, whom so muche ye praysed before.
For neither of them did forgo it, no not Quéene Mary hir selfe, that dyd forgoe it, did euer forgoe it, so ye rayle at hir also.
Besides many other godly princes, of this other realmes, for the eccl. iurisdiction, as ye call it, whiche some of them did neuer, some of them did not euer forgoe.
And therfore ye both reuile them, and belye the~, but chiefly the Quéenes highnesse, and is not this neither a preparation to rebellion? But M. Stap. muste néedes be let goe, whether he list to range: and therefore let him goe.
First, he asketh, vvho vvere they that set foorth deuises of their ovvne, for the succession of the crovvne, vvithout the Princes knovvledge? Surely (sayth he) no Catholikes, but the very Protestantes them selues.
Ye doill, M. Stap. to make a generall conclusion, of the Protestantes simply, from the priuate dooinges of some.
Should a man say that the pedigrée, that M. Christoferson set from Iohn of Gaunt, for king Philips title to the Crowne of Englande, prouing him to be, euen nearer than Quéene Mary hir selfe, was the dooing of all the Papistes? No, the Papistes mystiked and corrected it.
Howebeit, when it was best corrected, it tended to a farre worsse ende, (which ende was all their dooings and fetche, to bring this Realme to perpetuall slauery and bondage of Aliens) than dyd these mens facte, in deuising for the succession: which though it were not lawfull to be done, vvithout the Princes knovvledge, as ye say: yet was their entent farre otherwise than to make a preparation to rebellion, yea rather to stoppe all gappes (as they thought) the better from Popishe rebellion, althoughe they medled further than became them to do.
But what excuseth this the Papistes disobedience? thinke ye these faultes of the Protestantes be couerings large inoughe to hyde the Papistes wickednesse? but to stretche them further, he discourseth on the writinges of master Knox, and master Goodman.
For we shall haue all layde in our dishe, noughte shall be lefte behinde concealed, that any Protestants vnaduisedly euer dyd or spake.
And it is good to sée our owne fats and follies, this profite of foes Plutarche teacheth vs, to be one of the greatest commodities, for that that our friendes would not tell vs, our enimies will not layne, but spe out all that they knowe, to our shame, good and badde, false and true togither.
And therfore we had néede beware, that professe the word of God, how circumspectly we lead our liues, least we giue occasion to the aduersarie, and his ministers, to slaunder the Gospell, and that the vncircumcised Philistians rayle not of the God of Israell, by reason of our defaults, as héere this enimie dothe.
Howbeit his argument is all insufficient, either to proue any disobedience in vs, or to excuse the Papistes disobedience: the argument is this.
M. Knox, and M. Goodman wrote agaynst the raygne of women: Ergo, the Protestantes acknowledge not the Quéenes supremacie in all causes ecclesiasticall.
Such slender arguments he gleaneth togither agaynst vs, séeking bye matters.
But what should he do? else should he haue nought to furnishe his counterblast withall.
At last, giuing ouer the pursuite of the Protestantes, he returneth to the defence of his clyent, that this can be layde of all men least to M. Feck.
And héere lyke a wel enstructed proctor, he reckneth what good déedes he did in Q. Maries dayes, and appealeth to certayne Right honorables, as the Lorde Earle of Leicester, the lorde Earle of Bedforde, the lorde Earle of VVarwike, Sir VVilliam Cecill secretarie.
Yea the Queenes maiestie hir selfe, to defende and purge him.
The good déedes that he reckneth vp are these two.
First, that sir Iohn Cheekes life, landes and goodes, by his trauayle and humble suite were saued.
The other: His hope is, that the Queenes highnesse, his soueraigne good Lady, will thus muche reporte of hym, how in the beginning of hir highnesse trouble, hir highnesse then beeing imprisoned in the Court at VVestm. and before hir committie to the Towre, his good hap was to preache a sermon before Queene Mary, and hir honorable councell in the Courte, where he moued hir highnesse and them also to mercy, and to haue consideration of the Queenes highnesse that now is, then in trouble, and newly entred in prison.
VVhat displeasure he susteined therfore, do heere (saith M. St.) omit to expresse, but this certenly know that he hath reported, and hath most humbly thanked almightie God, and hir highnesse, that hir highnesse had the same in reme~brance, at the first last talke that euer he had with hir in hir palace at VVestin. before hir highnes coronation.
trust these are suffycient personages for M. Feck, purgation and discharge, against your false
And so he concludeth with a prayer, that M. Feck. may be made partaker of the like dooinges, as he then shewed to other men.
That downe, M. St. God hath graunted him long time, M. Fec. hath felt it: nor (if he be not too vntha~kful) can deny it: yea, your selfe graunt that he confesseth the Q. highnesse to be his soueraigne good lady, reported, that hir highnesse forgot not the same, warrant you, forslacked not ye large recompence of his sermon, not only if he would haue reuoked his errars supertitions, but also, euen as he wilfully refused hir highnes fauourable inclinatio~ towards him, haue herd him ofte~ times my selfe, publikely priuately acknowledge, what the Q. maiestie most liberally gaue him, at the reducing of the Minster to the former estate.
But what doth this Pharisaicall repetition of his former good déedes then, excuse his obstinate disobedience now? or proue that his booke set foorth agaynst the Queenes maiesties authoritie, dispersed among hir subiects, is notnowe a very preparation to rebellion? if he did any thing then, to deserue fauour now, let him now so behaue him selfe, that he may finde it, the Quéenes maiestie is most mercyful and beneficiall.
What hindreth him then, but his owne rebellions obstinacie? and yet he hathe founde since (what little fauour so euer he got for other then) tenfolde muche more doubled to him agayne.
Little fauoure (God knoweth, and hir Highnesse felte) founde she in that hir trouble, and streight imprisonment, after M. Feck. sermon.
But ye will not expresse, what displeasure M. Fec. susteined for mouing Quéene Mary and hir Councell to mercy, and to haue but consideration of the Queenes highnesse that now is.
What? gotte he so great displeasure for thus much, M. St? was it so sore a matter, to moue them to mercy and consideration of their doinges? had thought they had done all thinges with mercy and great consideration.
But why will ye not expresse it? forsooth, ye should then expresse, what excéeding crueltie, (whiche can hardly be expressed what inconsiderate doings, the Papistes vsed then, neither coulde they be moued from them.
And neuer so little a motion (for M. Feckenham went not ouer farre warrant you) coulde not be made of mercy and consideration, without great displeasure taken.
Ye haue well described the state of your Popes raigne (M. Stap.) so vnmercyfull an estate and inconsiderate, that for description thereof ye doe best, as dyd Timantes, when he paynted the mourners at the sacrifice of Iphigenia, setting out one wéeping, another with this, another with that heauie visage, when he could not deuise a more dolrous cou~tenance, he paynted Agamemnon hiding his face with a kerchiefe: so you, whe~ ye can not sufficiently set foorth those dolefull tymes, ye do wisely, in that ye omit to expresse them, and therein ye expresse them most of all.
And woulde ye haue lyke mercy and consideration sheshed nowe to the Papistes, as the Papistes shewed then to the Protestantes? Alas, master Stap. if but halfe a quarter of suche extremitie were shewed nowe, as was shewed then, it woulde goe harder with master Feckenham, and other his complices, than it dothe.
No, no, M. Stap. their chambers, their walkes, their libertie, their ease, their fare, is nothing like your do~geo~s, your stockes, your colehouses, your famine, your racks, your gaggs, your whipping there, rostmeate at a stake, that ye gaue the protestants.
warrant ye Fe. lookes not like a ghost, nor like a poore scholler of Cambridge or Oxford, perchaunce fares better than some stude~ts of diuinitie in Louayne.
It is easy to discern M. St. what spirite either religion is of, the protestants and the papists, euen by this your own note of vnmercifulnesse and mercy: and now (saith M. St.) let vs proceede on to the residue of your booke.
THe Bishop of Winchester, after he hath shewed (on M. Feckenhams wordes) the entent of the Othe, and the entent of M. Feckenh. booke to be contrarie: and therefore, what soeuer he offreth in wordes, he denieth the same in déedes: and in the beginning for ensample, dalieth with ye Oth about dominions persons, thinking therby, he escapeth the principall ende of the Othe: in this diuision sheweth first, how doublie he dealeth, in pretending as though the Bishop had forced him to sweare: but there was no such Othe offred or required betwéene them: rgo, man might well maraile, that he shamed not to pretende such a lie.
Secondly the Bishop sheweth, how M. Feckenham is taken in his owne daliace.
In that ye graunt to her Highnesse the onely supreme rule ouer the Laye and Ecclesiasticall persons, you haue all ready proued withall the causes also, euenby a supreme gouernors definition.
supreme gouernour or ruler, is one who hath to ouerse, guide, care, prouide, order, and directe the thinges vnder his gouernment rule, to that ende and in those actions, which are appointed, properly belong, to the subiect or thing gouerned: But the Queenes Highnesse is, by your own co~fession, the only supreme gouernour ouer al manner persons Ecclesiasticall, &c. Ergo, Hir highnes hath to ouersee, guide, care, prouide, order and direct, to that ende, and in those actions, which are appointed, do properly belong to persons Ecclesiasticall.
And thus concludeth, that M. Feckenham grau~ting thus much for fashion sake in generall speache, is but a dissembler, and in déede denieth the obedience of the person also: or els he péeuishly standeth on the distinction of the cause, which in full effect he hath graunted alreadie.
Here is first a worshipfull reason, and cause to meruaile at M. Feckenham.
that he should by writing presently offer him selfe to receyue an Othe, bicause he neuer made mention of any suche othe before, neither any suche was at any time of him required, surely this is as great a cause to wonder, as to see a goose go barefoote.
Ye plainly falsifie the Bishops woordes M. Stapl· he said not, that M. Feckenham neuer made mencion of any suche othe before, but he saide, that he neuer made any motion of such an offer to him.
So that this declareth both a double dealing of him, also a wresting of you.
But this in eyther of you, muste not be wondered at, as a rare dealing, that in lying and wresting ye be shamelesse, bicause it is as common to you, as to sée a goose go barefoote, and as rare, as to heare a barefoote Foxe, preach to shod géese in Louaine.
Secondly to the Bishops argument he saithe: But now will he play the worthy Logitian, and M. Feckenham will he, nill he, shalbe driuen by fine force of a Logicall definition, to graunt the Queene to be supreme head in all causes Ecclesiasticall, for that he graunteth hir to be supreme head of all persons both Ecclesiastical and Temporal.
Bicause (saith he) the supreme gouernour or ruler is he, that ordereth and directeth all actio~s, belonging and appointed to the subiectes, and thereby enferreth that the Queenes Maiestie is supreme and onely gouernour, eue~ in those actions that belong to Ecclesiasticall persons, which are causes Ecclesiasticall.
But as good skill as this man hath in Logike (which is correspondent to his diuinitie) he hath brought vs forth a faultie and a vitiouse definition.
For a supreme gouernour is he, that hath the chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, not in those actions that may any way, properly belong to the subiect or thing gouerned, (as M. Horne saithe) but in those actions that belong to the ende, whereunto the gouernour tendeth.
VVhich may well be, although he haue not the chiefe gouernment in all the actions of the thing gouerned, but in such actions as properly appertaine to him, as a subiect to that gouernour.
Although M. Stapl. arguments hitherto haue shewed some tast of his owne great skill in Logike, and what a worthie student of Diuinitie he is him selfe (the want of which two he vpbraydeth to the Bishop after his prowde scornefull manner) yet in this his cou~terblast to the Bishops only reason of a supreme gouernours definition, he wil further shew what a passing subtile Logitian, déepe Deuine he is.
But alas the mans ill lucke, for while he clerkly laboreth striues to bring M. Feckham out of the briers, he not only wrappeth him the faster in them: but so snarleth entangleth him selfe withall, that as one all amased, he speaketh he wottes not what.
And goyng about the Bushe wonderfully to worke, when he hath all done, he hath not onely left the matter where it was, against M. Feckenham, but hath made it more playne against him selfe also.
First, he reprehendeth the Bishops definition of a gouernour as faultie, but his guiltie conscience was so striken, that he durst not, or he well wist not, how to report the definition as it laie, but saith that the Bishop defined, supreme gouernour, to be one, that ordreth and directeth all actions, belonging and appoynted to the subiecte: Which the B. said not, but M. St. who hath altered, hacked, and cut halfe away of the Bishops definition, which within eight lines after (though nipping and wresting the woordes, yet some what more truly than before) he expresseth, saying: in those actions that may any way properly belong to the subiecte or thing gouerned.
Wherein he séemeth vnskilfully, or as one astonnied, to make no difference betwixt the subiect which is the person, and the obiect, which is the matter and action, or not to vnderstande that properly the gouernour, is not said to order and direct the obiect, but the subiect, in or about the obiect.
In which point as the Bishops definition is distinct and cleere: so M. Stap. finding fault therewith, but not able to saie here lieth the faulte, nor to amende it, and yet going about to amende it: either in conclusion, maketh one, nothing differing in matter, or farre worsse so much as it differeth from it.
supreme gouernour (saith M. Stapl.) is he, that hath the chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, not in those actio~s that may in any wise belong to the subiect, or thing gouerned (as M. Horne saith) but in those actions, that belong to the ende whereunto the gouernour tendeth.
This is your perfect definition M. St. which either is Ide~ per Idem, a gouernour is he that gouerneth in those actions, wherein he is a gouernour: and so your fautles definition is very faultie it selfe: or els it is in effect and matter all one, with the Bishops definition, that ye reprehende, though ye would in wordes séeme to make some difference: so againe it is the more vitious, the more obscure it is.
But this may well be (say you, to confirme your definitio~) although he haue not the chiefe gouernment in al the actions of the thing gouerned, but in such actions as properly appertaine to him as a subiect to that gouernour.
M. St. we stande not now in question what may well be, but what is of necessarie consequence.
But ye séeke out corners and darke speaches to wrappe the truth in such obscuritie, after the Popishe manner, that your readers might rather meruayle at ye than vnderstand ye.
Which if they did, they should sée your folly and contradictions, and that your selfe scarce vndersta~d your owne wordes (if they were your owne) for if ye vnderstoode your selfe, when ye say, he hath chiefe gouernment, in such actions as properly pertayne to him, as a subiect to that gouernour: then would ye also sée, how it followeth that being a subiect to him (as M. Feckenham hath confessed) as well in that he is an Ecclesiasticall person, as Temporall: he is also a subiect to him in such actions, as are so well Ecclesiasticall as Temporall.
He that is subiect to the Princes supreme gouernment, is vnder him in all such actions as appertaine to him, as a subiect to that gouernour.
But euery manner person so well Ecclesiasticall as Temporal, borne in the Princes dominio~s, is subiect to the Princes supreme gouernment: Ergo, The Prince hath the supreme gouernment ouer euery manner person borne in his dominions, in all such actions as are Ecclesiasticall so well as Temporal.
And thus his owne darke speaches being brought to light, make flatte agaynst him selfe.
But to make the Reader vnderstande his meaning better, and to vnwrappe him selfe out of this obscuritie, in the which he hath rather hindred than bettered his cause: he setteth out the same with sundrie ensamples, of a Master and his Seruaunt, a Father and his Sonne, a Mayor and a Citizen, the Prince and his subiect, a Schoolemaster and his scholers, the Shipmaster and the Mariners.
For in one man (saith he) many rulers may and do dayly concurre, which in some sense may euery one be called his supreme gouernour.
As if he be a seruant, the Maister: and if he be a sonne, in that respect the father, and if his father and Master dwell in a citie, the Mayor also, is the fathers maisters, so his chiefe gouernour to, for things concerning the chiefe gouernment of the citie, and of all these the Prince, chiefe and supreme gouernour, as they be subiects.
Otherwise the Prince doth not intermeddle with the fathers office, in duetifulnesse dewe to him by his sonne: nor the Master for that gouernme~t he hath vpo~ his seruant, no more than with the scholemaster, for the gouernment of his schollers, and their actions, or the maister of the ship, for the actions doings of the mariners, otherwise than any of these offende the positiue lawes of the realme, and so hath the Prince to do with him as his subiect, or when he shal haue neede to vse them for the co~mon welth, wherein as subiects and members of the said common welth, they must to him obey.
Much like is it with the spiritual men, which be also members of the said common welth, and therefore in that respect, subiect to the Prince and his lawes: and so is it true, that the Prince is supreme gouernour of all persons as well spirituall as temporall.
But that therefore he should also be supreme gouernour in al their actions, will no more follow than of the actions of the~ before rehersed, yea much lesse.
M. St. thinketh he hath now clered the coast, that by all these ensamples, the matter goeth cléere with him.
Shewyng first how euery one of these rulers, master, father, mayor, and Prince, may in some sense be called supreme gouernours.
But yet, either he doth not or wil not sée withal, how in the sense now in controuersie, all these ensamples are also flat against him.
For as the father, in all causes that haue respect from the father as father, to the sonne as sonne· is the sonnes supreme gouernour, as he saith: and as the master in all causes that haue respect from the master as master, to the seruant as seruant, is likewise the seruants supreme gouernour: and as the mayor in all causes that haue respect fro~ the mayor in that he is mayor, to ye citizen in that he is a citizen, is also the citizens supreme gouernour: so the supreme gouernour of ecclesiasticall persons, in all causes that haue respect from him, in that he is a supreme gouernour, to ecclesiasticall persons in that they be ecclesiasticall persons, is in all those causes their supreme gouernour: but the causes in respecte whereof they be called ecclesiasticall persons, beyng no other than ecclesiasticall causes, it followeth that he is not onely supreme gouernour of the persons, but also in the causes belonging to the persons, as the father or master is not onely supreme gouernour of the sonnes or seruaunts persons, but also in those causes in respect whereof he is the sonne or seruant.
Yea, but saith M. St. though the Prince be supreme gouernour to these and all other persons in the realme, yet as he entermedleth not with father, schoolemaster, shipmaster, &c. in their seuerall actions of their offices or vocations: so though the Prince be supreme gouernour of all persons ecclesiasticall, yet is he not supreme gouernour in all their actions of their offices or vocations.
Ye conclude not a like M. Stapl. but subtilly and falsely ye alter the state of the conclusion: if ye made your argument aright, ye should make it thus: as the Prince intermedleth not in the seuerall actions of his temporall subiects offices or vocations, so he intermedleth not in the seuerall actions of his Ecclesiasticall subiectes offices or vocations.
This is the right illation of the smilitude, and thus it maketh nothing against vs. Which you espying, in the place of intermedling, thrust in, gouerning, concluding alsely, bicause he is no intermedler in the one, that therefore he is no gouernour of the other.
But the urder ye wade in this similitude, the more ye labour against the streame.
For as, although the Prince intermedle not with the Fathers, the Masters, the Schoolemasters, the Pilotes seuerall actions, in their offices or vocations: yet he ought to ouersée, that euery one of these, and all other his subiects, do their owne proper actions, belonging to their vocations, and offices dutifully: yea not onely to make lawes for them all, as subiectes, but also for their seuerall estates and degrées besides, not for him selfe to exercise, but for them to worke in their vocations: so the Prince beyng likewise gouernour of Ecclesiasticall persons, so well as of any other aforesaide, although he intermedle not with the seuerall actions of their vocations, yet ought he to ouersée them, that euery Ecclesiasticall estate do their proper actions dutifully, and also to make Lawes and Orders, not for him selfe, but for them in their degrées and vocations to exercise and obserue the same.
And thus your similitude euery way maketh quite against you M. Stapl. how be it you will proue it better ye say.
For the better vnderstanding whereof it is to be knowne, that before the comming of Christe, Kings were there many, but Christian Kings none.
Many co~mon wealths were there, but no Christian common welth, nor yet godly co~mon welth, properly to speake, sauing among the Iewes, but cluill and politike.
The ende and finall respect of the which ciuill common wealth, was and is vnder the regiment of some one or moe persons, to whome the multitude committed them selfe to be ordered and ruled by, to preserue themselues, from all inwarde and outwarde iniuries, oppressions and enemies, and furder, to prouide not onely for their safetie and quietnes, but for their wealth and abundance, and prosperous maintenance also.
To this ende tendeth and reacheth, and no furder, the ciuill gouernment: And to the preseruation, tuition, and furderance of this ende, chiefly serueth the Prince, as the principall and most honorable person of the whole estate, whiche thing is common as well to the Heathenishe, as to the Christian gouernment.
Is this all that ye will aforde christian Princes M. Stap. what a heathenish doctrine is this, to make Christen princes and Heathen princes gouernment all one? What if Christen princes (as they haue right good cause) beginne to startle at this, that ye make their estate no better before God than is the great Turkes? And what if one should answere, that ye not onely sclaundered reprochfully, all the estates of Christendome nowe liuing, or that shalbe, or haue bene since Christes comming: but also wickedly deface all the godly Kings and rulers before Christes comming, Melchisedeck, Dauid, Salomon, &c. beléeuing in Christ to come, as Christen Princes now beare the title of Christ already come.
And yet dare you saie, that before the comming of Christ, Kinges were there many, but Christian kinges none.
Do ye dallie on the tytle and name of Christian, or meane ye the tytle and effecte of christianitie? if ye meane so (as ye must néedes meane, if ye meane any thing materiall to the purpose) ye are very iniurious, not onely to those Kings, but to their subiects, yea, to their common weale also.
And yet ye say further, their common wealth was but ciuill and politike, and vvente no further, than outwarde peace, tranquillitie, welthe, and prosperous maynteinance, which is the onely ende of their gouernement, and that it reacheth not any iote further.
What if one should bidde you looke further in the scripture, and so ye should finde it stretche somewhat further, than to be common with the great Turkes gouernement? What if a man should presse you with your owne wordes afterwarde, that yet catche it more than one inche further, for assisting of the Churche vvith the temporall svvorde, which the great Turke, the great Chan, the Persian Sophie, doth not, but drawe their swordes agaynst it? What if a man should referre this among your contradictions? What if he should ioyne another withall, that where yet ye confesse, the Iewes common vvealth was godly before Christes comming, and other common wealthes were not godly and yet the ciuill gouernement of Christian princes, reacheth no further, than the ciuill gouernement of heathen princes, and one finall ende is common to bothe, and so eyther the Heathens common vveales were godly also, or else the Iewes were vngodly too? yea, what if the heathens co~mon vveale, and heathen Princes fell out to be in better estate of the twayne, if only quietnesse, vvealth, abundance, and prosperitie, were the onely and finall ende of bothe? if ye were well vrged in all these thinges, thinke ye, M. Stap. these your principles would be able to defende you? yea lastly, if one woulde denie these your Heathen and Turkishe maximies, bring ye any thing to proue them, than your owne bare saying, that it is to be knovvne? But no true Christian knovveth it, Stap. nor will euer acknowledge this, which with suche bolde impudencie, ye grounde vppon, that christian Princes gouernement reacheth no further, than ciuill and outvvarde safetie, vvealth, abundaunce, and prosperitie, and is common asvvell to heathen, as to Christian princes.
Neuerthelesse, M. Stap. taking it for a rolled case, and out of question, rolleth vp the matter as graunted.
And as he hath thus determined the boundes of Christian Princes gouernement, so (as it were by commission from his holy father) he descrybeth the Popes kingdome.
But ouer and besides (sayth he) yea, and aboue this, is there an other gouernment instituted and ordeyned by Christ, in a spirituall and a mysticall body, of such as he graciously calleth to be of his kingdome· which is the kingdome of the faythfull, and so consequently of heauen, wherevnto christian fayth dothe conduct vs.
In whiche spirituall body, commonly called Christes catholike Church, there are other heades and rulers than ciuill Princes, as Vicars, Parsons, Byshops, Archbyshops, Patriarkes, and ouer them al the Pope.
VVhose gouernement chiefly serueth, for the furtherance and encrease of this spirituall kingdome, as the ciuill Princes doe for the temporall.
That there is another mysticall body, the kingdome of the faythful directed by an other spiritual gouernement, this is a true principle, M. Stap. and truer than you wéene or would haue it.
But as you are deceiued, and would deceiue others, with the title of that spirituall Churche, so on thys principle, you gather a moste false assumption.
That the heads of this spiritual or mystical body, the church of Christ, are vicars, parsons, byshops, archbyshops, patriarkes, and ouer them all the Pope.
In which assumption, ye take for true grau~ted, sundry manyfest errors, flatly of vs denied, chiefly foure.
The first about the spirituall and mysticall body of Christ.
Wherin ye shew great vnskill, not knowing what is ment by the spiritual mystical body.
For in that respect, as there are no ciuil princes, emperours, kings, or quéenes, so there ar no Bishops neither, no not Greke nor Scythian, Gentile nor Iew, neither male nor female, but all the elect that haue bene, are, or shall be, either in heauen aboue, or here dispersed in any parte of the earth, without any respect of person, are al members, and Christ the only head.
And so M. St. your selfe also call it, the kingdome of the faythfull, so that if any bishop be vnfaithful, he is so far from beeing a head in this misticall corporation, that he is no member or any part therof.
And your selfe confessed before, that now the~ your Pope was no good ma~ neither, therfore vnfaithful, hauing not the true, liuely, effectual faith in Christ, as they only haue yt be me~bers of this body, wherby he is quite excluded fro~ it.
Your first error therfore is, in not discerning betwéene the inuisible and visible estate of the Church.
Secondly, taking it (as after, contrarie to your former sayings, ye seeme to expounde it) to be the visible estate of the church, saying, co~mo~ly called Christes catholike church: then erre ye, in that ye say, vicars, parsons, bishops, archbyshops, and popes, be rulers and heades of it.
For excepting parsons (taking them for pastors) Bishops, the scripture knoweth none of thse rulers.
The other titles haue come in since, with deanes, archeaco~s, abbots, priors, cardinals, patriarches. &c. although speake not against the names of the~, no not of the name of Pope neither, which béeing well vsed, reueri~ce admit, but against the Popish hierarchie, proud abuse of them.
And therfore thirdly, where ye say, the Pope is ouer them all, that he is so ouer all those degrées in your Churche, graunte ye, but that he is so ouer those, or any other degrées, in the true visible Churche of Christ, it is but your facing maner, to take that for confessed that is chiefly denyed.
Fourthly, that ye affirme the Pope, and his Prelates gouernemente chiefly to serue for the furtheraunce and encrease of the Spirituall kyngdome of Chryst: where it is euident to the contrarie, what hauocke and decrease, so muche as they can, these Rulers make of the members of Christes Churche, to maynteine infidelitie, and exautorate the worde and kingdome of Christ thereby.
M. Stap. now presupposing, that the christian Princes gouernement is only outward and for the body, and co~mon with the heathen and stretcheth no further: and that on the other parte, the Pope ouer al, and his fleshly chaplens vnder him, are the heades and me~bers of the spiritual and mysticall body of Christ: nowe he will proue (and God before) that this gouernement of the pope, his chaplaines, is far aboue the kings gouernement, and that kings he subiect therto.
Now (sayth he) as the soule of man incomparably passeth the body, so doth this kingdome the other, and the rulers of these the rulers of the other.
And as the body is subiecte to the soule, so is the ciuill kingdome to the spirituall.
His reason is thus: The soule or spirite incomparably passeth the body: The kings gouernement is onely for the body, and the Priests gouernement onely is for the soule and spirite: Ergo, the Priestes gouernement incomparably passeth the Kinges.
As this argument is noughte, so the conclusion béeing rightly vnderstoode, dothe noughte infirme the Princes supreme gouernement ouer all ecclesi. causes.
For thoughe the maior be true, the minor is moste false, that the kinges gouernement is onely for the body.
Yea though the spirituall gouernement be onely the Priestes, yet the gouernement ouer spirituall matters, and matters apperteyning to the soule, may still for all that, and dothe belong, euen ouer the Priests to the Prince.
Neither dothe M. St. proue the co~trarie, or alledge ought for his minor, than as we haue heard, the foresaide principles, of limiting the Princes gouernement, to be all one with the Turkes.
But you might haue done well M. Stap. to haue esed your paynes euen here, and haue troubled your selfe no further to proue your matter, if these your vaine presupposals, be such true and vndoubted principles.
But as though we had alredy graunted them, M. St. still goeth on.
To the which kingdome (sayth he) as well Princes as other, are engrafted by baptisme, and become subiects to the same by spirituall generation, as we become subiectes to our princes, by course and order of natiuitie, which is a terrestrial generation.
As the childe that is borne by a terrestriall generation, in the earthly Princes kingdome, is subiect to the earthly Prince: so, euen the Prince being borne againe by spirituall generation, is become subiect to the spirituall kingdome.
But the rulers of the spirituall kingdom are the pope. &c. Ergo the Prince is become subiect to them.
Thus fondly still ye reason on your principle, in so much that we can say nothing agaynst you.
But nowe, while ye thinke ye may say what ye will, sodenly see how ye haue ouerturned these your mightie principles, with a trippe of your owne contrarie sayings, euen in the same place.
Furthermore (say you) as euery man is naturally bounde, to defende, mainteyne, encrease, adorne· and amplifie, his naturall countrey, so is euery man bounde, and much more, to employ himselfe, to his possibilitie, towarde the mition and defence, furtheranee and amplification, of this spiritual kingdome, and most of all the princes themselues.
As such which haue receyued of God, more large helpe and facultie, toward the same, by reason of their great authoritie, and temporall sworde, to ioyne the same as case requireth, with the spirituall sworde.
Thinke ye this to be true indéede M. St. may we trust you on your wordes? then is religion an ende of the Princes gouernment, which a little before ye not onely most vntruly denyed, but buylded as ye thought iolye arguments therevpon.
All whiche come nowe downe of themselues with an heaue and hee, your selfe pulling awaye the soundation, wherevppon they were buylt.
And nowe ye make an other platforme, contrarie to the former, which is, that Princes moste of all are bounde (as those that haue receyued of God more large helpe, and facultie towarde the same) to employ them selues to their possibilities, to these endes, to defende, mainteyne, encrease, adorne, and amplifie, not onely the ciuill peace and prosperitie, but much more the spirituall kingdome.
And ioyne the temporall sworde with the spirituall sworde, as the case requireth.
Upon this, as a better platforme than the other, build this argument euen according to your owne definition of a supreme gouernour, and master Feckenhams offer.
supreme gouernour is he (say you) that hath the chiefe gouernment of the thing gouerned, in those actions that belong to the ende, wherevnto the gouernor tendeth: But the actions of Ecclesiasticall persons (ouer whome the Prince is supreme gouernour, as master Feckenham hath graunted) doe belong properly to the ende, wherevnto the Prince tendeth: to wete, not onelye to mainteyne the common peace and tranquilitie, but also to sée that Gods religion and seruice be purely and syncerely had and kept amongst the subiects: Ergo In these actions the prince is supreme gouernour, and so by consequence in all causes and actions ecclesiasticall.
To proue the minor: first, that all the trauayle of all godly Preachers in the worlde, is to this ende, is playne and manifest.
That this is also the chiefe ende of the Princes gouernement, both your selfe master Stapleten at length haue confessed, centrarie to your former heathen limitation, and also the verye heathen and prophane wryters themselues: so well as Christian, haue acknowledged.
Wherein master Stapleton both sheweth his great follie, in reasoning that heathen Princes did not regarde religion, Ergo they ought not especially to haue regarded it: and also bewrayed his ignorance in the antecedent of this his vaine reason: for the heathen though they erred in mistaking religion, yet they knewe and taught that it was an especiall care, and ende of the Princes gouernment.
speake not howe Plato in his bookes de rep. legib. reckoneth the care of Religion, to be a chiefe ende of theyr authoritie: And yet will note two sentences out of Aristotle, whome to denie your Sorbonistes make more than petit heresie. [undefined span alphabet]) sayth he) [undefined span alphabet] in the other Cityes the sacryfices are left onely to the Kinges.
For the Capitaine was oth King and Iudge and Lorde of the deuine matters.
And to proue this by the storyes of heathen Princes.
Numa Pompilius hath his chiefest commendation not so muche for making ciuill lawes and pollicies to the Romaynes, as for his lawes about theyr religion, theyr Priestes, theyr Nunnes, theyr Sacrifices.
The Magistrates of Athens, did sitte in iudgement and condemned Socrates when Anitus and Melitus accused him for false religion.
The Romaine Princes them selues woulde labour principally for the office of the chiefe Bishoppe, whiche terme Pontifex.
Tiberius promoted to the Senate of Rome, (as to those that had the care and gouernement of theyr religion) that Christ might be accounted among theyr Gods.
Yea, in the Scripture is declared that Nabuchanezar the King of Babylon, an Heathen Prince, and vtterly destitute of the truthe, before God gaue him some sparkes thereof, yet made hée a lawe of worshipping hys owne Image.
And King Darius of Persia made a decrée that none shoulde worship God in certayne dayes.
In all which matters although these heathen Princes crred from the truth: yet they thought, that religion (which they mistooke for truth) to be a principall part belonging to their gouernment.
Although therefore master Stapleton ye doe great iniurie to Christian Princes to make their state common with the Paganes: yet do you more iniurie herein to them, than the heathen did to their heathen princes.
Was it lawfull for them in their heathen gouernment to haue so especiall a care aboute their heathen and false religion, and is it not lawfull for godly Christian Princes, to haue the like or more aboute Chrystes true Religion? Is the ende of their gouernment common to both alyke, as ye say, and yet the Heathens stretched further than doeth the Christian Princes? Iohannes de Parisus affirmeth, that this is a false supposition of yours Master Stapleton.
That the Kingly power hath the cure of the bodie and and not of the soules.
Sithe it was ordeyned to the common profite of the Citizens, not euery profite, but that profite which is to liue according to vertue.
Herevpon sayth the Philosopher in the Ethikes, that the intention of the lawmaker, is to make men good, and to enduce them to vertue.
And also in the Politykes he sayth, that as the soule is better than the bodie, so a lawmaker is better than a Physition, bicause the lawmaker hath care for the soules, and a Physition for the bodie.
Nowe as the Philosophers ascribed this ende (in the Heathens false religion, in vertues of lyfe, and care of the soule) to the gouernement of Heathen Princes: Doth not Saint Paule shewe as muche and more trowe you, for the ende of Christian Princes gouernement in these thinges? Ut tranquillam vitam degamus in omni pietate honestate.
That we may leade (sayth he) a quiet and peaceable life in al godlinesse and honestie.
Was this no further master Stapleton than safetie, quietnesse, worldly wealth, aboundance and prosperous maintenance? Did the great Constantine stretche the ende of his gouernment no further when he sayde, debere ante omnta scopum esse udicaus, &c.
iudged that this oughte before all other thinges to be my scope, that among the most holye multitudes of the Catholike Churche, one fayth and syncere charitie and godlinesse agreeing togither towardes almightie God, might be conserued? Did the whole assemblye of Byshoppes, in the first generall Councell at Constantinople, limitte no further the endes of Theodosius gouernment, when they confessed that God instituit imperiu Theodos ad communempacem ecclesiarum, sanae fid confirmationem? God did orday ne the gouernement of Theodosius for the common peace of the Churches, and the confirmation of the sounde fayth? Did Saint Augustine beléeue that Princes gouernement reached no further, when he sayde, Reges in terris seruiunt Christo faciendo lege pro Christo? Kinges in the earth doe serue Christe in making lawes for Christe? Did Iustinian suppose, hys authoritie tended no further, when he wrote, Legum Authoritas diuinas humanas res bene disposuit? The authoritie of the lawes hath well disposed both the deuine and humaine matters? Did the mste Christian King of Spaine Richaredus, thinke that the ende of hys gouernement stretched no further, when he sayde openly in the thirde Councell at Tolet, before all the Bishoppes there assembled, Quanto subditorum gloria Regali extollir, tanto prouidi esse debemus in his quae ad Deum sunt, &c? Howe muche more we bee exalted in royall glorie ouer our subiees, so muche more ought wee to bee carefull, in those matters that appertayne to God, eyther to augment our owne hope, or else to looke to the profite of the people committed to vs of GOD.
And as ye see me in verie deede inslamed wyth the feruencie of fayth, God hath styrred mee vp to this ende, that the obstinacie of infidelitie beeing expelled, and the furie of discorde remooued, shoulde reuoke the people to the knoweledge of faythe, and to the eloweshippe of the Catholyke Churche, who serued errour vnder the name of Religion.
Lo master Stapleton, here ye sée farre other endes, of the ciuile gouernment of Christian Princes, than (as you most falsely and iniuriouslye alleage to preserue them from all outwarde iniuryes, oppressions and enemyes, and further to preserue them for theyr safetie and quietnesse, for theyr wealth, abundaunce, and prosperous maintenaunce, and that it tendeth and reacheth no further.
And that thys is common as well to the heathenishe as the Christian gouernement.
Fye for shame master Stapleton that euer suche heathenishe woordes shoulde procéede out of your catholyke lips.
But ye are halfe ashamed sée, and woulde mollifie the matter so muche as ye can with a proper qualification: that those thinges which these godly Princes did, although they did them: yet therein were they no more but Aduocates: and so saye you, All good Princes doe and haue done, ayding and assisting the Churche decrees made for the repression of vice and errors, for the maintenance of vertue true religion: Not as supreme gouernors themselues in all causes spirituall and temporall: but as faythfull Aduocates in ayding and assisting the spirituall power, that it may the sooner, and more effectually take place.
As ye bring this shifting distinction of Aduocate to late, M. Stap. hauing before quite debarred the Princes Ciuill gouernement, of goyng anye iote further than ye there did bounde it, to meddle no further wyth ayding and assisting the spirituall power, than a Saracene doeth ayde and assist it: gyuing Princes no more leaue to be Aduocates thereof than ye make the Turke or Souldan, saying this theyr so limitted gouernement is common as well to both Heathen as Christian: euen so this your office of Aduocateshippe came to late into the Churche by manye yeares, to debarre anye of these forenamed Princes, in theyr owne supreme gouernement aboute matters, to make it sownde, as though they onely had béene the ayders, assisters, or Aduocates vnto others, and not them selues the doers.
Whereas on the contrarie, they were the verye doers, thoughe not of those actions that appertyned to the Ministers offices, yet of the gouerning and directing bothe the Ministers and their actions, yea and the principall ouerséers and supreme rulers of them, as euen their déedes and wordes before rehearsed plainly declare.
As for thys shyft of Aduocation, was long sithence, after theyr tymes deuysed.
Whiche office of Aduocateshippe, séemeth to bée deyued, from this fonde errour of the Papistes, that the seculer power is immediately and primarelye (as they terme it) in the Pope, but he hath not also immediatelye the exercise or execution of it, but gyueth that to the Prince, and so the Prince becommeth the Popes Aduocate, or rather his executioner.
And thus was first (say they) Carolus Magnus Pope Adrians Aduocate, executing the Byshoppe of Romes will, agaynste Desiderius King of Lumbardie.
Wherevpon Charles was made Emperour by the Pope, notwithstanding Michaell the Emperour was then lyuing at Constantinople.
Propter hoc dicunt (sayeth Dantes Aligherius) quòd omnes qui fuerunt Romanorum imperatores, post ipsum ipse, Aduocat Ecclesiae sunt, debent ab Ecclesia aduocari.
For thys thyng, all that were Emperours of Rome after hym, and hee hym selfe, are Aduocates of the Churche, and oughte of the Churche to be called vpon.
Lupolous de Babenberge also telleth, that Pope Zacharie declarauit. &c. declared or pronounced, that Childericus Pepins master, shoulde be deposed, and Pepine be made the King of Fraunce, whome when Pope Steuen the seconde annoynted, with his sonnes Carolus and Carolomanus, French Kings: Ipsos specialiter elegit (sayth Lupoldus) ad sedem Apostolicam defendendam.
Ex hac electione puto{que} reges imperatores Romanorum, sint vs{que} in hodiernum diem ecclesia Romanae aduocati, de qua Aduocatia loquuntur iura canonica.
Of this election thinke it commeth, that Kinges and Emperours of the Romaynes are euen to this daye the Aduocates of the Romayne Churche, of whiche Aduocacie, speake the Canonicall lawes.
Thus you sée the originall of your deuised Aduocateship, commeth nothing neare the examples of the sayde godly Princes, béeing themselues supreme gouernours in Ecclesiasticall matters before your Aduocateshippe was first hatched.
And yet it is but a sielie shift of your Canonistes descant, rather detecting the vnlawfull encroching of the Pope, than defeating anye parte of the Princes authoritie, in this hys supreme gouernement.
As for those Princes Carolus Magnus, his sonnes and other Emperours since theyr tymes, were nothing suche Aduocates as your Pope and you woulde nowe pretende, that is to say, to be your onelye executioners: But as these stories testifie, euen these Aduocates also, were the chiefe directours and supreme gouernours, of all those things they did.
Yea the Pope hym selfe so well as anye other Byshoppe in theyr territoryes was subiecte to them.
They ayded and assisted the Byshoppe of Rome graunt, when he humblie aduocated, then he called vppon them for ayde and assystance, agaynst the wrongers of him.
But the Pope by commaundement called them not, and they obeyed his calling, and so became his aduocates, which is cleane contrarie to an aduocates office.
But M. St. will further proue, by his former ensamples, why this supreme gouernement can not appertayne to the Prince.
For this supreme gouernement (sayth he) can he not haue, vnlesse he were him selfe a spirituall man, no more than can a man be master of a shippe, that neuer was a mariner: maior, that neuer was a citizen.
Hys principal gouernement resting in ciuill matters, and in that respecte as haue sayde, he is supreme gouernour of all persons in his Realme, but not of all their actions, but in suche sense as haue specified, and least of all the actions of spirituall men, especially of those which are most appropriate to them, which can not be vnlesse he were him selfe a spirituall man.
You frame your similitude very vnproportionably, M. Stap· from the master of a shippe, or the maior of a citie, to a Prince or supreme gouernour.
Either of these béeing particuler offices vnder a supreme gouernour, that maketh lawes, euen both for maiors in cities, and masters of shippes also· And albeit no argume~t builded on similitudes, is firme to proue or improue any controuersie, though rightly applied, they may lighte~ the matter, to him that assenteth, but not enforce it to him that denieth (notwithstanding your similitudes, as they proue nothing, so they nothing lighten, but more obscure the matter) yet if these your similitudes were admitted, fro~ maior and pilot, to supreme gouernour, what true conclusion can ye inferre vpon them? when both the ensamples that ye make your similitude from, and the matter that ye apply them too, are false.
For a man may be master of a shippe, though he neuer was a maryner in the shippe: and also made the Maior of the towne, wherein he was neuer citizen before.
As many a noble or gentleman, is made the captayne of a forte, of a towne, or an armie, that neuer was prest before a souldier, and yet a good captayne to, hauing the knowledge howe to gouerne souldiers, though he him selfe were none.
Yea, to draw néerer than mariners, Maiors captaines, reade ye not, that S. Ambrose was neuer so much as any of the clergie, and that more is, no not baptized, yet he was a better byshop, than the best bishop of the Romish making now, or than the byshop of Rome him selfe? yea your holy Pope Felix.
was he before he was Pope any other than (as ye call it) a méere lay man, neither Cardinall, Byshop, Priest, nor had so much (that we reade of) as your benet collet? and therfore your examples are not true of Maior Pilot, that they must haue bene citizen mariner before.
And yet, where herevpon, ye would néedes haue christian Princes to be spirituall men, if they should be supreme gouernours of spiritual matters: it is graunted you, and so they be.
And if you thinke godly christian Princes not to be spiritual, but vtterly voyde of spiritualnesse: then is this in you a lying and carnall spitefulnesse.
All godly Princes, ya all godly persons are spiritual, and that muche better than any shaued or oyled massing Priest.
But if ye meane, after the common distinction, those that haue any spirituall office in the ministerie of the worde and sacraments, as deacons, elders, byshop: &c. then your similitude, as is before declared, fayleth.
Such Offices are not necessarie to haue gone before in a Supreme gouernour ouer them, although the knowledge is necessarie how to gouerne them.
Besides this, the proportion of your similitude fayleth, in that to proue a supreme gouernour should withall be a spiituall man, yo alledge ensamples of suche gouernours, as be not, but haue bene, suche or suche persons before: and so from the master, which hath bene a maryner, and nowe master, you conclude, the prince béeing a gouernour in spiritual matters, should withal be a spiritual person.
Neither doth the proportion hold, in the necessarie relation of the similitude, from a Maor to his citizen, from a master of a ship to a mariner seruing in the ship (which hath relation fro~ the gouernours, to the parties in their offices gouerned) to any like relation betwéene a supreme gouernour, ouer eccl. causes persons, to a spirituall person· but from a spirituall gouernour, to a spirituall subiect, this were the right relation.
Now the Prince néedeth neither to haue bene a spiritual subiect, nor yet a spirituall person, in your common sense of spiritualtie: neither so claymeth he to be a spirituall gouernour.
And therefore, neither the ensamples of your similitude, nor the proportion holdeth.
But sée how still your owne tale ouerturneth your selfe.
For if his principall gouernement resteth in ciuil matters (as immediatly ye say) that, in that respect he is supreme gouernour, of al persons in his realme, but not of their actions: why is he not of their actions also, syth they be ciuil or temporal matters in which respect he is their supreme gouernor? is it not bicause, though he be their supreme gouernor, yet he professeth not all their seueral offices, scie~ces, handy crafts, mysteries, or vocations, and so is not a dealer in their actions? which hindreth nothing his principal gouerneme~t ouer them al, that he is, nor euer was, a prentise of any of their sciences, nor practiseth the actions of their callings, being all ciuill matters.
And yet say you truely, he hath the principall gouernement in ciuill matters.
But why then also, notwithstanding the prince dealeth not with the actions of spirituall men, may he not haue a principall gouernement in spirituall matters, thoughe him selfe haue not the spirituall function, or office of a spirituall man? Doe ye not ée, by your owne wordes, that to haue a principall gouernement, or to be a supreme gouernor our all persons and matters· is one thing: and to do all the particuler actions, of those persons or matters, is another thing, not requisite in the supreme gouernour? and why then wilfully confounde ye them so often, as though we made the Prince the doer of the actions, bicause we acknowledge the Prince the gouernour of the matters.
And why sayde ye before in your last similies, that he coulde not be a principall gouernour of any ciuill matters excepte he had bene a doer of the actions, and as it were, a prentise to the occupation before? concluding the like for a gouernour of spiritual persons and causes, that he must be a spirituall man, and do the spirituall actions.
But if now, béeing better aduised, ye perceiue that a man may be a gouernour in ciuil matters and yet be not the doer of the ciuill actions, then conclude likewise for spirituall matters, that the Prince may be a supreme gouernour in spirituall causes, and yet the same not the doer of the spirituall actions.
The two vntruthes therfore M. Stap. that ye gather of the Byshop, saying: VVherefore we haue heere two vntruthes, the one, in an vntrue definition, the other in saying the Prince is supreme gouernour in all causes spirituall, are no vntruthes.
Neither haue ye, or hitherto coulde ye, improue his conclusion, with all your ensamples, or your similitudes, Yea, euery similitude that ye haue made, béeing throughly weyed, hath proued the Byshops conclusion, and confuted and contraried your selfe.
But beside al this, we haue, sayth M. St. a playne contradiction of M. Horne, directly ouerthrowing his owne assertion heere.
The Bishoply rule and gouernement of Gods Church sayth M. Horne co~sisteth in three poyntes: to feede the Church with Gods word, to minister Christes Sacraments, and to bynde and lose. to gouerne the Churche (sayth he) after this sorte, belongeth to the onely office of Byshops and Church ministers, and not to Kinges, Queenes, and Princes.
Now then, these being, by his owne confession, the actions that properly belong to Ecclesiasticall persons, and the Prince by his sayd confession, hauing nothing to do therewith: how is it then true, that the Prince is the onely supreme head and gouernour in causes Ecclesiasticall.
Yea in those, that do properly belong to persons Ecclesiasticall? or by what colour may it be defended, that this saying, is not plaine contradictorie and repugnant, to this later saying, which we haue alleaged, and whereof we shall speake more largely, when we come to the saide place? There is no doubt M. St. but ye will recken it vp there at large, and here also, and in many other places, ye still sing Decies repetita placebunt, for so your booke will growe to a welfauoured volume.
But ye should first cléere your selfe, of your own foule contradictions before committed, and then obiect contradiction to the Bishop.
But let vs sée what a sore contradiction it is: Princes can not do certaine Ecclesiasticall actions.
Here M. St. ye labour to shew where the Bishop saith so, but ye should labour to proue them co~tradiction, but that ye take for manifest, being manifest false.
Neither néede there any colour to defende these sayings from contradiction, for it was euen the last thing that your selfe defended, in putting a difference betwene a principal gouernment of matters and that gouernment that is exercised in doyng the actions of those matters.
And thus easily your self reconcile this great contradiction, and awere your owne argument, that ye make of the Bishop sayings, reasoning thus: He confesseth, that those actions do not belong to the persons of Princes, Ergo, he confesseth, that Princes are not supreme gouernours to direct and ouersee them.
And therefore where ye lappe vp the matter, saying, Thus ye see M. Horne walketh like a bare footed man vpon thornes, not knowing where to treade, ye should remember your selfe M. Stap. that you haue walked all this while like your barefooted goose that ye spoke of before, not knowing what last ye creaked.
MAster Feckenham offreth to sweare to obserue and performe that obedience to the Queenes hignesse now, that he did before vnto Queene Mary.
The Bishop sheweth how therein he was forsworne, as he had helped to spoyle Q. Mary, of a principall parte of hir royall power, so would he with no lesse disloyaltie spoile the Queenes Maiestie now.
M. Stapl. taking after his fashion, Non concedenda pro concessis, saith the othe is vnlawfull: likeneth it to wicked King Herodes othe, denieth this gouernment to be any part at all of the Queenes royall power, and auoucheth that if the Bishop can once by any meanes, proue this gouernment to be a principall parte or any parte at all of the Queenes royall power, he dare vndertake that not only M. Fek. but many mo, that now refuse, shall most gladly take the saide othe, he were surely no good subiect that would wish hir highnes any wro~g.
To wishe wrong to any body, is naught in déede M. St. worse to do it, but worst of al to wish and do it against your liege and soneraigne.
What wrong ye wishe and do by all trecherous practises, vnto the Q. Maiestie, is apparant, and therefore your owne iudgement be on your owne head.
Ye liken hir highnesse to wicked King Herode, euen here present, yet ye say ye wishe hir no wrong.
But what reasons should moue ye M. St. to thinke this open wro~g no wrong? Neyther can (say you) the maintenance of the Catholike faith, wherof she beareth a title of a defender, be counted any iniurie to hir highnesse, neither is it to be thought but if there had bene any wrong or iniurie herein done to the Crowne, some Christian Prince or other in the worlde haue ere this, once in this
This later argument of former Princes, is answered a large alreadie.
The other argument, standeth on M. Stap. former presupposall, that the Popes supreinacie is the Catholike faith.
The maintenance of the Catholike faith, is no iniurie to the Queenes Highnesse.
But our refusall of the othe is the maintenance of the Catholike faith: Ergo, our refusall of the othe is no iniurie to the Q. Highnes.
Here where M. St. should proue the Minor being manifest false, he letteth that go, presupposing it is most true, and confirmeth the Maior which none denieth.
She beareth a Title of defender of the Catholike faith: Ergo, The maintenance of the Catholike faith is no iniurie to ir highnesse.
Of this Title we spake also before, onely now note his argument that here couertly he séemeth to make thereon.
The Qu. highnesse Title calleth hir defender of the faith: Ergo, If she should also haue the Title of supreme gouernour in all causes Ecclesiasticall, then were the former Title iniurie to hir highnesse.
But the former Title of defender of the faith can not be counted any iniurie to hir highnesse.
This bald reason standeth vpon a presupposal in M. St. head, that this is a principall article of the Faith.
The Pope is onely head of the Catholike church: But graunt not M. St. this his faithlesse principle, and he wil proue but a sielie Defender of this.
MAster Feck. pretending that he was by the Bishop required prouoked to sweare, refuseth that parte of the Othe that toucheth the Quéenes supremacie in the causes Ecclesiasticall, vnlesse the Bishop shew him the meanes how he may sweare without periurie.
The Bishops answere stands on two points: the one, to detect his false dealing to pretende that the Bishop required the othe.
The other, that this his refusall of the later parte of the Othe, is but his nice daliance in woords, hauing graunted alreadie the matter in effect.
The B. reasoneth thus: Euery Ecclesiasticall person is called Ecclesiasticall onely in respect of ecclesiastical functions, things and causes belonging to ecclesiasticall persons.
But ye haue graunted that the Queenes highnesse is supreme gouernour ouer al persons in hir realmes so well ecclesiasticall as temporall: Ergo: ye haue graunted that she is the supreme gouernour ouer them in those their ecclesiasticall functions, things and causes also.
M. Stapletons counterblast is thréefold: the first against the Bishops argument.
The seconde as he calleth it, is an heape of vntruthes wherewith M. Feckenham is falsly charged.
The thirde his shamefull sclaunders, that the plague, was sent of God to punish the doings of the Parliament: that bicause the Bishop required the Othe of D. Bonner, he therfore sought his bloud.
That our Bishops were no Churche Bishops, nor parliament Bishops neither.
But these too friuolous partes omitte, it sufficeth to haue quoted the slannders in their common place.
As for the vntruthes, are answered in their proper bedroll.
will answere onely now, that which is materiall, and that counterblasteth the argument.
Yet once againe (saith M. St.) M. Horne taketh in hande M. Feckenhams graunt, which may well be graunted, and by· his great cunning and skilfulnesse will thereof inferre as before, that may not be graunted.
But now he spitteth in his hande, and taketh faster holde as he thinketh, and seing the lightnesse of his former reason, woulde nowe giue greater weight to it with a new fetche, but yet as light and as weake as the other, and employing manifest contradiction as before, and to be answered as before.
For albeit, a man is not called an Ecclesiasticall person but in respect of some church cause and function, which we freely graunt to M. Horne, yet is he neuer a whit the nearer of his purpose, vnlesse he can proue that there were also no other respect, why he should be vnder the Prince, but for causes Ecclesiasticall.
For as we haue saide, he is a subiect also as other Laye men are, and a member beside of the ciuill common wealth, in consideration whereof the Prince hath to do with him, and not properly as he is a spirituall man, though both respects be concurrant in one person, and he be named of the worthier.
As the Bishops argument is plaine and formall against M. Feckenham, so here M. Stapleton stepping out to helpe him, as it were clapping him on the backe, recomforts him, saying, his graunt of the Minor, That the Queenes highnesse is spreme gouernour of all persons in hir realmes so well Ecclesiasticall as temporall, may be well graunted.
And he will also freely graunte to the Bishop the Maior, man is not called an Ecclesiasticall person but in respect of some church cause, and function, which is all one with the Bishops affirmatiue: Euery ecclesiasticall person is called Ecclesiasticall onely in respect of Ecclesiasticall functions thinges or causes belonging to Ecclesiasticall persons: what now can rightly follow hereof, but the Bishops flatte conclusion, that the Queenes highnesse is supreme gouernour of them, in those their functions, things and causes also? Nay saith M. St.
will graunt him al this freely, and yet is he neuer a whitte the neerer of his purpose, vnlesse he can proue that there were also no other respect, why he should be vnder his Prince, but for causes ecclesiasticall: for he is a subiect also as other lay men are.
sée you would faine slippe the coller, deuising a new diuersitie of respects betwéene ecclesiasticall person and subiect, when the question is, and M. Feckenham hath confessed, that he is a subiect euery way, whether he be lay subiect or ecclesiasticall subiect· Otherwise, whe~ M. Feckenham saide, ouer all persons either ecclesiasticall or temporall of what estate so euer they be: if he had ment as you say ouer ecclesiasticall persons in déede, but not in that respect that they be ecclesiasticall but temporall and lay persons, then had he plainly dalied in coloured speach foolish meaning, as thus: ouer al persons ecclesiasticall and temporall, that is to say ouer all persons temporall and temporall· if he meant ecclesiasticall persons, not in that respect they be so called, but in that respect they be temporall and lay as other subiectes be.
But this is your owne wilie deuice which in effect is nothing but wilie beguild him selfe.
M. Feckenham ment plaine therefore twice togither saith, either ecclesiasticall (on the one partie) or temporall persons (on the other partie) and to make the matter plainer, of what estate (saith he, that is to say of what condition kinde or degrée of subiects) soeuer they be.
And did not your selfe say before and freely graunt it, that an ecclesiasticall person hath not his name of ecclesiastical person for any other respect but for ecclesiasticall causes and functions? why say you now contrary to your self, he is named here ecclesiasticall person· not in any respect of any ecclesiastical causes or functions, but in respect he is a lay and temporal subiect? how hangs this togither M. Staplete~? will ye denie so soone that so late ye freely graunted? then perceyue (as ye here say the Bishop doth) must be fayne also to spitte on my handes and take faster holde on yours and M. Feckenhams graunt.
M. Feckenham hath graunted and you also, thus much: that the Queenes Highnesse is supreme gouernour ouer all persons borne within hir realmes, either ecclesiasticall or temporall, of what estate soeuer they be.
That is to say, they are all subiect to hir, all persons gouerned, or vnder hir supreme gouernment, but the vsuall worde is subiect.
Subiect here is the Generall worde or Genus, comprehending two members deuiding the~ selues vnder it, that is, ecclesiasticall person and temporall person.
Either of these is comprehended a like in the generall woorde subiect, for it is neither nearer the one nor the other, nor may be more properly spoken of the one than of the other.
The temporall person is as much subiect and no more, than the ecclesiasticall person, the ecclesiasticall as much and no more than the temporall, nor these two can be confounded togither, nor the one taken for the other, Membra diuidentia non confunduntur, but as the one is temporall in respect onely of the temporall functions, so the other (as ye say well therein) is ecclesiasticall, only in respect of functions ecclesiasticall, bothe are comprehended vnder their generall worde subiect: thus doth M. Feckenham plainly set them foorth as it were in a table.
Now commeth our student M. St. seing all this so manifest plaine, that him selfe is eue~ forced to graunt it: he hath studied out this shift, first to iumble them altogither iugglerlike, then deuides or rather breakes them, making ecclesiasticall and subiect to be Membra diuidentia, the one to ouerthwart ye other, which they do not, but the one co~prehendes the other.
And maketh this worde person, to be general to them both, which here is al one with subiect.
And thus when he hath plaied Cole vnder ye candlestick, chopping chau~ging the words, now saith he, ye shall sée the Bishop is neuer the nearer of his purpose, vnlesse he ca~ proue that there were also no other respect, why he should be vnder the Prince, but for causes Ecclesiasticall, for as we haue said he is a subiect also.
As who should say in that respect he is a subiect, he is not Ecclesiasticall, in that respect he is ecclesiasticall, he is no subiect bicause he supposeth these two are contrary respects, ecclesiastical subiect.
But this he doth by presupposall, that ye will graunt him al that he saith, or els he would neuer so freely haue graunted the Bishop, that which after made against him selfe.
For who seeth not that ecclesiasticall and subiect may well agrée togither, which M. Feck. saw well inough, whe~ he graunted as well the ecclesiasticall person as the temporall to be the princes subiect? And againe, who seeth not that this is but a fonde shifte of M. Stapl. to say that the Bishop is neuer the nerer of his purpose, onlesse he can proue there were also no other respect, why he would be vnder the prince but for causes ecclesiasticall.
For, grau~ting him againe, there are other respects wherefore he is also vnder his prince.
What is M. St. the nerer of his purpose? doth it follow bicause he is subiect also in other respects, that therefore he is not subiect in this respect? he should haue proued this, but this he lettes alone, and thinks all is safe if he be subiect in other respects.
But what other respects so euer there be, him selfe hauing freely graunted· that this name of person ecclesiasticall hath no other respect, but to the causes ecclesiasticall: and being gouerned or subiect, as M. Feckenham hath graunted, in respecte of eyther parte of this diuision, temporall or ecclesiasticall: if fellowes that in all respectes what soeuer, of causes or persons ecclesiasticall or temporall, the Prince is supreme gouernour.
Nor all M. Stapl. crooked shiftes, and crabbed respects, to hinder the sequele of this argume~t, are any more to be respected, than ere trifles, and toyes to delude the Readers withall.
But M. St. will not giue ouer the matter thus, but will bring his darke respects, to the aspect and light of all mens eyes, by a familiar though somwhat an homely sim As if master Robert Horne were a lay man and a paynter, (sayth he) the Queene properly hath not to do with him as a paynter (vnlesse it were for some lavve or order concerning paynters) but as Robert Horne hir highnesse subiect, and borne vnder hir obeysance.
Sée how enuye hath blynded this man, that whereas for very spite he likeneth the reuerent and godly learned father in Christ, to a paynter, this his paynted similitude maketh also flat agaynst him.
For, as he confesseth, the Prince hath to doe vvith a paynter, not onely in that he is simply hir highnesse subiecte, borne vnder hir obeysance, but also in respect he is suche a subiecte, in whiche regarde (he saythe) she maketh lavves and orders also concerning paynters, thoughe she entermeddle not with the Paynters pencell, in drawing lynes, and laying colours, and other their perticuler actions: euen so hath hir highnesse to do with all ecclesiasticall persons, not onely in that they be simply, subiectes borne vnder hir obeysance, but also euen in that they be suche manner of ecclesiasticall subiects, in which respect she may also make lawes and orders concerning ecclesiastical persons, though she entermeddle not with preaching, ministring the sacramentes, and other their particuler actions.
Thus as God would haue it, doth your owne similitude (M. Stap.) which of pure enuye ye bring foorth to deface the byshop withall: so liuely in euery poynt make agaynst you, as any similitude can do.
At length ye discende from your similitude, to your playne purpose, saying.
So shoulde the Queene haue also to doe with you, yea in case ye were the true Byshop of VVinchester, but not properly as Byshop, or for your byshoply function, for the whiche ye are immediatly vnder your Archbyshop and the Pope, but considering you as a subiecte othervvyse, or as Byshop either, touching your temporalties, and no further.
For the which the true Byshops also to their Prince do their homage.
With muche adoe (for it sticketh in your throte lyke a boane) ye admitte at length this case, that the Bishop were the true Byshop of VVinchester, but without any stay at the matter ye could compare him to a paynter but now beeing a Bishop, he is (as you say) vnder his Archbishop and the Pope, and vnder the Queene onely for his temporalties.
Here is no argument, M. Stapleton, but your bare assertions, as though the matter were cleare and all out of question.
ye had still reasoned from the similitude of the paynter and paynted it out in his true meaning, ye had concluded another maner of tale, that as the Prince mighte meddle euen with lawes and orders for paynters, so she hath to do with Byshops, not onely concerning their temporalties, but euen co~cerning that they be Byshops.
And where ye say, in that he is byshop, he is immediatly vnder his Archbyshop and the Pope, what if his Archbishop be not vnder the Pope neither, is he not then also béeing immediatly vnder him, exempted likewise from your Pope? and thus ye stammer euen in your owne false principles.
Now when ye haue thus without any reasoning determined the Byshop to be vnder the Pope, and that he dothe homage to the Quéene onely for his temporalties and no farther, ye conclude the matter, saying: But what should further reason with this man, vvhiche (as haue sayde) hathe remoued the Prince from all superioritie, concerning the meere Byshoply or Priestly function, and so with a notable contradiction hathe full vvorshipfully concluded agaynst hym selfe, and eased hys aduersarie of any other proofe, and eased master Feckenham also, for taking any othe, that the Queene is supreme head in all causes temporall and spirituall.
This notable contradiction is so sore a matter, that you muste néedes haue a fling at it once agayne, the contradiction is this: The Prince hath not the iurisdiction of the meere Priestly or Byshoply functions: The Prince hath the superioritie ouer the priestly or Byshoply functions: Is not héere a notable contradiction, and worthy to make thys finall conclusion thereon? The Prince hathe not the iurisdiction of the meere Priestly or Byshoply functions: Ergo, He is remoued from all superioritie ouer the same functions? Full vvorshipfully concluded, to vse your owne termes master Stapleton.
What should ye reason further with this man? but in steade of reasoning, fall to making principles, or sit downe and ease you with master Feckenham without any further proofe.
But, mighte it please you to starte vp agayne, and looke better aboute ye: ye shoulde sée, that betwéene euen that superioritie (which worde notwithstanding the Byshop sayde not, but power or iurisdiction) of the meere byshoply or priestly function, that is to saye, his office, and the proper actions of his office, preaching, binding and losing, the ministring of the Sacramentes: and betwéene the superioritie, that is, the ouersight and supreme gouernement, in caring for, directing, and prouiding, that all those functions and actions be duetifully done on their partes, to whome they properly belong: there is a great difference, as all your similitudes hitherto haue proued and concluded agaynst you.
And that betwéene the dooing of the one, and the not dooing of the other, is no contradiction or opposition at all.
And therefore ye be not so eased yet, but that ye muste take a little more paynes, or else where ye had thought to haue wonne the spurres, ye may happe to lose the saddle.
MAster Feckenham standeth on foure poyntes, whereby he thinketh he should periure himselfe, if he should sweare to this laste parte of the othe, in eccl. causes.
The first point is, that he muste testifie it on a booke othe.
But to testifie any thing on a booke othe, and not to knovve the same, is periurie.
Then for him selfe he pleadeth ignoraunce, that he neither knovveth it, nor knovves any meanes hovv to come to the knovvledge of it.
Whervpon he ioyneth an issue with the Byshoppe, which issue is this: If the Byshop make proofe to him, that any Emperour or Empresse, King or Queene, may clay me or take vpon them any suche gouernement in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes, then he will yéelde and receiue the othe.
The meanes whereby he will haue this issue proued, are these foure.
Either by suche order of gouernement, as our sauiour Christ hath lefte behinde him in his Gospell and nevve Testament: Either by the vvritinges of suche learned doctors bothe olde and nevve, vvhich haue from age to age vvitnessed the order of eeclesiasticall gouernement in Christes Church: Either by the generall councels, vvherin the right order of ecclesiasticall gouernement in Christes Churche hath bene moste faythfully declared, and shevved from time to time: Or else by the continuall practise of the like ecclesiasticall gouernement, in some one Church or parte of all Christendome.
By these foure meanes, this issue aforesaide (as the state of the controuersie betwéene bothe parties) must be tryed.
That, by any of these foure meanes, proofe be made to him, That anie Emperour or Empresse, King or Queene, may claime or take vpo~ them, anie such gouernment in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes.
The satisfaction whereof to be proued by the Bishop is this: That by some of these foure meanes, proufe may be made to him, that some Emperour, Empresse, King, or Queene, may clayme or take vppon them, some such gouernment in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes.
If the B. shall be founde to haue proued thus much to M. Feck. he hath fully satisfyed his request, and M. Feckenham according to his promise, ought to sweare with humble thankes, notwithstanding master Sapletons quarelling Counterblast.
The Bishop reducing M. Feckenhams first poynt, to a forme of argument, repeateth it: No man may restifie any thing by a booke oth, whereof he is ignorant and knoweth nothing, without committing manifest periurie: But you neyther knowe that the Queenes highnesse is the onely supreme gouernour of this Realme, as well in all spirituall or ecclesiasticall things or causes, as temporall: neither yet know ye anye waye or meane, whereby to haue anye knowledge thereof.
Ergo ye cannot testifie the same on a boke oth, without manifest periurie.
To this the B. replieth, that although he might flatly denie the minor, that M. Feck. is not without all knowledge, and vtterly ignorant of ye matter, nor destitute of al meanes to attaine therto: yet he sayth he wil answere by distinction of ignorance, to shew how M. Feck. is ignora~t, how he is not.
He alleageth a thréefold deuision of ignorance out of Thomas of Aquine the chiefe of the Popish scholemen· Ignorance of simplicitie, Ignora~ce of wilfulnes, and ignorance of malice.
Prouing that he is not ignorant of the first sort, hauing in king Henries and king Edwards reignes, continually knowne, acknowledged confessed it, and therfore his ignorance is either of wilfulnesse, or of malice, or of both of them.
M. St. Counterblast standeth chiefly on thrée matters, first his answere to Thom. distinction, with an obiecting againe to the B. the opinion of Tho. in this co~trouersie.
Thirdly, an excuse of master Feckenham for setting forth this supremacie.
With a quarell ioyned thereto that the B. citing a sentence out of the booke of wisdome, called it a sentence of the holy ghost, concluding thereon a discorde of our doctrine.
But or euer he enter into his first part, he noteth this for a generall warning before.
Now are maister Feckenham, and master Horne come to couple and ioyne togither in the principall matter.
If this forewarning be true M. St. that this their coupling and ioyning togither on this issue (to wete, whether any princes haue take~ any such gouernme~t on them be nowe by your confession the principall matter controuersed, betweene the partyes standing in variaunce, whiche (as ye sayde before) is conuenient and necessarie to haue before (our) eyes, and then deligently to see howe the proufes are of eche partie applied, for the confirming of their assertions: Then all those sixe principles, whiche ye sette vp before your Counterblast as markes to fixe the eye of the Reader vppon, were but false markes and not the principall matter, wherein the parties coupled them selues togither to proue or improue the same.
Then were almost all that hitherto M. Stap. hath sayde (as the Reader marking this well shall sée) and the most of that which he hath to say in this great Counterblast, nothing else but a running about the Bushe, and wresting of euerye thing, from the principall matter in which they ioyned, to some other matters wherein they coupled not.
Whiche is plaine to beguile and abuse, not rightly to direct the eye of the Reader, as the Reader fixing his eye on thys issue, shall soone espie your falsehoode.
This issue then, being the principall matter (as ye say) and the Bishop coupling and ioyning herein togither with master Feckenham (as ye also say) and the Bishop hauing proued that which he endeuoured himselfe to proue (which ye likewise haue confessed) what remayneth by your owne tale telling, but that the Bishop hath fully proued the principall matter in question? Neither will you (as you say) nor any other Catholikes greatly contend with him for that he hath proued: and he hath proued that that he laboured in: he laboured in that he coupled: he coupled in this issue: thys issue is the principall matter betwéene them: whie then do ye so fiersely contende? but that ye woulde shewe your selfe a vaine sophisticall and brabling quarrellour, that haue no great cause to contende, nor anye cause at all, and yet will so greatly contende, onely of wylfull malice, confessing your selfe the thing to be proued, that is the principall matter.
Master Stap. hauing giuen this forewarning, commeth to his first part, which he deuideth thréefold.
First he iesteth out the matter with scoffes, which referre to his common place thereon.
Secondly, he denieth master Feckenham to haue any ignorance in this poynt except it were inuincible ignorance, by no study or diligence able to be put away, and therfore pardonable.
Since ye admit the distinction M. Stap. ye bring out of time your other inuincible ignorance.
But sée how ignorantly, while ye would defende M. Fec. you ouerthwart him, he pleadeth ignorance for his defence, and you say he is not ignorant and woulde put the B. to proue that he should be ignorant of wilfulnesse and malice, which the B. hath done alreadie, and so ye debarre M. Fecke~ham of his refuge, and make him to haue knowledge of this poynt.
Which not only he himself denieth, but which your selfe afterwards denie also, yea that he could not haue knowledge of this poynt.
But you thinke to escape cleare, with helping the matter by a newe pertition of ignorance, adding a fourth part of inuincible ignorance.
Surely (say you) if there were any ignorance in this point it were such as S. Tho. and other call inuincible ignorance.
Except (M. St.) ye confound this fourth ignorance with one of the thrée before named, ye quite exclude M. Fec. from the whole distinction of Thomas, and yet ye say the distinction may be true, ye will not stick with him for that distinction.
So that eyther ye sticke at that ye will not sticke, and make that false that ye graunt true, or else ye proue master Feck. not to be ignorant, contrarie to his defence, and all the rest of your owne défence of him, as we shall sée your wordes afterwarde.
In the meane time let vs sée howe pretily ye shift off the matter, onely bicause the Bishop names Tho. of Aquine a schole Papist, for the diuision of Ignoraunce, thinking ye haue gotten a wonderfull aduauntage thereby, for the Popes supremacie.
But nowe (sayth M. Stap.) the verye authour brought forth by master Horne, so fullie and effectually dischargeth M. Feck. of all three, and chargeth M. Horne, with the worst of them three, that is wilfulnesse and malice, as he shal winne small worship by alleaging of S. Thomas.
For S. Tho. sayeth plainely, that we are obliged and bounde vpon paine of euerlasting damnation to beleeue that the Pope is the onely supreme heade of the whole Church.
Nowe fearing (as not without good cause) that the B. would in this matter reiect the authoritie of this Thomas, whom our Thomas calleth a late latine writer, and to much affectionate to the Pope: as it were by preuention, He can not well reiect his authoritie (sayeth he) vsing it him selfe.
And why so Sir pray you? must euery one that citeth him in any one poynt, receyue and admit his authoritie to in euerie poynt? Is it lawfull for the Sorbonistes, the Scholemen, and the whole rabble of the Papistes, yea for Thomas Stapleton him selfe, to accept Thomas of Aquines authoritie in some poyntes, and to reiect his authoritie in other some poyntes: and is it not lawfull for the Bishop or anye other to vse the same libertie? The Sorbonistes affirme of this Thomas, Illa doctrina non potest esse in omnibus sic approbata, &c.
That doctrine can not in all thinges be so approued, that conteyneth many thinges erronious in fayth: but as they say the foresayde doctrine of Saint Thomas, not onelye in the matter of the absolute necessitie of a creature, &c. but also in manye other thinges conteyneth manye matters erronious in fayth.
And againe, Non oportet credere. &c. VVee muste not beleeue that the doctrine it selfe is in no parte thereof erronious or hereticall, wherein are conteyned manye contrarieties and repugnancies, yea euen in the matter perteyning to the sayth· but manye suche contrarieties and repugnancies are conteyned in the doctrine of Saynt Thomas: Agayne. dicunt aliqui. &c.
And some saye for thys, that manye maye denye the glosses of the decrees and Decre, when the glosse doeth openlye denye the texte, and lykewyse some saye of the ordinarye glosses of the Byble, that notwithstanding seeme to bee of greater authoritie (when they are alleaged for authoritie) than is the Doctryne of Saint Thomas.
The sixte example maye bee giuen of certayne Doctours whiche are not canonized Saintes, as the venerable Anselme Byshoppe of Cant.
Hughe of Saint Victor, and certayne other, whose sayinges or wrytinges are in certayne poyntes founde erronious, and yet theyr doctrine seemeth to bee no lesse authenticall, than the doctrine of Saint Thomas, sithe they are of the skilfull in their scolasticall actes alleaged for authoritie, nor are wonted to bee denyed, but their sayinges reuerently to be glosed and expounded, whiche notwythstanding the Schoolemen are not woont to doe on the sayinges of Saint Thomas, and therefore it seemeth presumptuous so to extoll hys Doctrine ouer them and other Doctours, that wee maye not beleeue and affirme that hee erred in fayth, euen as other also haue erred.
And after this as likewise before, reckoning vp diuerse errours, these spéeches are common: Ista locutio est de virtute sermonis falsa multum impropria. &c.
This speech in the force of the wordes is false and verie improper.
Et breuiter haec alia multa erronea falsa impropriè dicta, vide~tur multis in praedicta doctrina contineri quae, tamen ex taedi pertransimus.
And briefly these and many other erronious, false, improper sayings, seeme to many to be conteyned in the foresaide doctrine, the which notwithstanding we ouerpasse for tediousnesse.
And from hence they discend to manifest errours in diuinitie.
They say also that in verie many places of his doctrine he erred by reason of this, that he applied to much the principles of philosophie or rather certaine wordes of Philosophers to the conclusions of Diuinitie.
Thus say the great Censors of the Popish doctrine agaynst Thomas of Aquine, so well they agrée togither in vnitie of doctrine, obiecting discorde vnto vs. Yea the whole swarme of Papists, not excepting our Thom.
St. here him selfe (vnlesse he be returned to the truth since he wrote his booke) reiecteth and condemneth Thom· of Aquines iudgement and authoritie, in one of the most necessarie matters of Christian religion, namely the doctrine of iustification.
For expounding this sentence of S. Paule: Arbitramur hemne~ iustificari absque operibus legis: Arbitramur enim nos, &c.
For we being taught of Christ, thinke (sayth Thomas) according to the truth of the Apostle, that euerie man, whether he be Iewe or Gentile is iustified by faith.
By fayth purifying their hearts, that without the workes of the law, and that not onely without the ceremoniall works, which did not giue grace: but also without the works of the moral commandements, according to that saying to Titus.
Not of the works of the righteousnes that we haue wrought.
The reason is presumed, that we are saued for our merits, the which he excludeth when he sayth, not of the works of the righteousnesse which we haue done: But the true reason is the onely mercy of God.
There is not therefore in them the hope of iustification, sed in sola fide, but in fayth alone.
VVorkes are not the cause that any bodie is iust before God, but they are rather executions and the manifestings of righteousnesse.
Where Tho. of Aquine thus according to Gods worde speaketh the truth, as in this poynt here of iustification: the Bishop and all other faythfull, receyue his iudgement and admit the same, with better reason than the Papists reiect it.
But where as, in many other poyntes he swarueth from the truth: though the Papists saint him neuer so much, yet there all true saintes, with good reason refuse him.
As in this that master Stapleton citeth out of him, who confesseth him selfe that Thomas being a late latine writer, wrote partiallye in this poynte, bycause hée was to muche affectioned to the Pope, and shall we beléeue such an affectionate wryter in hys partiall affection? Or shall we beléeue master Stapleton no lesse affectioned than Thomas, telling vs that Thomas sayeth plainly, that we are obliged and bounde vpon paine of euerlasting damnation, to beleeue that the Pope is the only supreme head of the whole Church.
And yet when he hath all done, Thom. plainly sayth not so, it is but our Thomas his plaine lye.
And though Thomas him selfe in that he sayde, made also a plaine lye, as affectioned to the Pope, yet shoulde you haue wordes more truely master Stapleton, if ye pressed the Bishop with his authoritie.
Thomas his partialitie woulde soone be more weight thereto, ye say: Saint Thomas proueth his assertion by Cyrill and Mximus, two notable and auncient wryters among the Gans.
VVherefore it followeth that neyther master Feckenham, nor master Horne, nor any other Christian man, can knowe the contrarie, beeing such an euident and daungerous falsehood as importeth eternall damnation.
Sée howe one Thomas here (were it but for namesake) woulde still helpe another Thomas, he careth not by what meanes, hooke or crooke, both belying Thomas and these notable fathers also.
Where sayd Thomas your wordes aboue alleaged? Where had he them out of Cyrill and Maximus? where haue Cyrill and Maximus that assertion? Shew it and then you cleare your selfe.
In deede Thomas being a late affectioned writer herein, alleageth proufes out of both Cyrill Max. but they proue no such assertion.
Cyrill hath no such wordes in his booke of Thesaurus, and that epistle of Maximus is not extant for ought that can learne, and yet Thomas doth but wrest both their sayings to proue his title, that it is of necessitie of saluatio~ to be vnder the B. of Rome.
The sentence that he fathereth out of Cyril to proue his saying, and yet notwithstanding proueth it not, is this: Ita{que} fratres, &c.
Therefore brethren, if wee followe Christ, let vs as his sheepe, heare his voyce, abyding in the Churche of Peter, and let vs not be puft vp with the winde of pryde, least peraduenture the winding serpent cast vs out for conte~tion, as long since it cast Eue out of paradise.
Can you, or Thomas, or any other, co~clude your assertion, or anything for your Pope on this saying? ye wil vrge these wordes the Church of Peter Thinke ye he ment the church to be S. Peters patrimonie, as ye terme it? or the Church of S. Peters dominion? if ye so thinke, S. Peter hym self gaynsayth it, saying that he is him self but [undefined span alphabet] consenior, a fellowe Elder, or Priest, and witnesse of Christes passions, and not the Lord, but Christ the Lorde of his Church, and him selfe with other not to be rulers and princes among the clergy, but they be only pastors formes of the flocke, Christ alone being the Prince of the Pastors.
So that if you meane hereby S. Peter to be the owner and Lorde of the Church (as your Pope at this day taketh on him to be) this sentence maketh nothing for him, but quite agaynst him.
For neither doth the Pope followe the humilitie of Christ, nor heare his voyce, as Cirill willeth, neither followeth he Peter, of whome he craketh, but is puft vp with the winde of pride.
Whiche Cirill forbiddeth, and therfore is cast out with the winding serpent.
But what Cirill meaneth by ye church of Peter, euen the other sentence following may declare of Maximus: Coadunatam fundatam super Petram confessionis Petri dicimus vniuersalem ecclesia, sicundum definitionem saluatoris, in qua necessario salutis animarum nostraru~ est remanere, ei obedire, suam seruantes fidem confessionem.
VVe call that the vniuersall Church, according to the definition of our Sauiour, the which is vnited togither, and founded vpon the Rocke of Peters confession, in the which it is necessarie to remayne, for the saluation of our soules, and to obey it, keeping the fayth and confession thereof.
The Church of S. Peter, that is to say, the Church vnited and founded vpon the rocke of Peters confession, not of Peters rule and patrimonie, but of his confession, which Rocke is onely Christe the corner stone, on whome onely the Churche is founded, and in whome as liuely stories of the buylding we are vnited.
To this Churche in déede muste we be obedient, and remayne in it, kéeping the fayth and confession thereof.
But what doth this proue for the obedience to the Pope his Church? dothe it not rather detect his church, not to be the vniuersal Church, wherof Maximus speaketh, that Christ hath defined (howsoeuer the Papistes crake of the vniuersall church) syth it is not vnited togither on the rocke, but on the sands of mens traditions, and founded as you say, vpon Peter, not as Christ sayd, vpon the Rocke· Since it kéepeth not this faith confession, nor remaineth in it, nor obeyeth it, it is not Christes true vniuersall Church, neither ought we to remayne in it, or obey it.
But as the Angell calleth vs, exite de illa populus mens. &c. Come out of hir my people, and be not partakers of hir offences, least ye taste also of hir plagues.
And thus by Maximus saying (howsoeuer Thomas as an affectionate late writer doth wrest the same to the obedience of ye Pope and his Churche) when we examine Christes true definition, and Peters confession, we finde that we are obliged and bounde, to renounce the Pope and his Churche, and that vpon payne of euerlasting damnation.
But nowe M. Stapl. let vs also sée your owne proper argumentes oute of Thomas.
Thomas sayth, the Pope is the only supreme head of the whole Church (wherin he quite excludeth Christ:) Ergo, we are obliged and bound to beleeue the same vpon payne of euerlasting damnation.
Thomas sayth, we are obliged and bounde to beléeue the Popes supremacie vpon payne of damnation: Ergo, the B. is to be charged with malicious and wilfull ignoraunce.
Thomas sayth, we are obliged and bounde to beleeue the Popes supremacie, vpon payne of damnation: Ergo, M. Feckenham is fully and effectually discharged of malicious and wilfull ignorance.
Thomas his distinction of ignoraunce is alledged of the Byshop: Ergo, the Byshop is bounde to allowe his authoritie simply in all matters, or in this of the Byshop of Romes supremacie.
Thomas cyteth Cirill and Maximus to proue his assertion: Ergo· the matter is so playne that the Byshop nor any other can know the contrarie.
These writers say so (or rather as is shewed are wrested to say that they say not:) Ergo, it is suche an euidente and dangerous falshood, as importeth eternall damnation.
These are the wise and worshipfull conclusions (to repeate your owne termes) that ye gather on the authoritie of Thomas, bicause the byshop cited him in the sayde diuision of ignoraunce: wherefore ye say, he shall vvinne small vvorship by alleaging of S. Thomas.
Howbeit you to win much worship and great honor by alleaging him, haue aduentured to lay all your honestie to pledge.
M. Stapletons seconde parte about vntruthes is answered sufficiently in his bedroll.
In the third part be confesseth that, wherwith the byshop chargeth M. Feck. that in king Henries dayes he set foorth this supremacie in his open sermons.
But withall to excuse him, he saith, it was not vpon knowledge but vpon very ignorance and lacke of true knowledge, and due consideration of the matter· What ignorance cal ye this M. St? if it be not malicious, it is of simplicitie, yea and wilfull carelesnesse withal· yet before ye sayde he was discharged of all three, and héere contrarying your own selfe, ye charge him again with two of them at the least, besides that ye there sayde: Surely if there were any ignorance in this poynt, it vvere inuincible ignorance, by no studie or diligence able to be put away, and therfore pardonable.
But is this suche ignorance, when héere ye confesse that he studied not for it, but did it without due co~sideratio~ of the matter? therfore it was not pardonable eue~ by your own saying.
Thus, while ye would excuse him of ignora~nce, do not only accuse him of ignorance, but also declare such great ignora~ce in your self, yt it séemeth ye neither well wot, nor muche care what ye say, so that ye may contende.
Neither shame you in this poynt, whyle ye would mitigate M. Fecke~hams fault, to accuse with him of ignoraunce, no fewer than all, yea the beste learned of the realme then, to whom it was not so well knowne (ye saye) as it is nowe to euery man, beeing but of meane learning.
To the proofe whereof, ye cite sir Thomas More, that tyll his latter time, did neuer of many yeres beléeue the Popes supremacie to be prouided by God, and therefore M. Feck. with many other good and well learned men otherwise, was caried away among them, with the violence of this common storme and tempest, for lacke of mature and deepe consideration.
Where as nowe all Papistee, suche as haue trauelled in these latter controuersies do beleeue, that the Popes primacie was immediatly instituted of God, and that it is Iure diuino, by Gods lawe, and not the Princes supreme gouernment, which is now knowne clerely to stand agaynst it.
Héere is no argument all this whyle for it, but onely defacing of their predecessors learning and knowledge, to aduaunce their owne, which notwithstanding it be nothing comparable in all wyse mens iudgements, yet is it worthy to beholde the grosse presumptuous impudencie of these Louanistes, that as though they came from the newe Indies, that say, other men are blinde or haue but one eye, and they onely haue two: so these wryters pretende they haue suche knowledge nowe, yea, the meane learned among them, as the very best learned before them, had not the lyke, who were not resolued herein, nor sawe so muche as they now do, in the Popes authoritie.
For they haue espied now at the le~gth with their Linxes eyes, that the Pope his primarie is de lure diuino of the law of God, which thing euen Sir Thomas More did not sée, who a great whyle was so blinde herein, that he thought it but the Churches institution: at length, full dimly God wot, he thought that he saw, it was prouided of God.
But nowe euery meane learned Louanist, hath espied through a milstone (to vse M. Stapletons owne phrase) and cleerely seeth and knoweth, it is ex lure diuino, instituted by God immediatly.
Who would haue thought they had bene then so blinde, vnlesse M. Stapl. had told vs they were so? or that our Louanistes had bene waxen so cunning, to haue found out of late, that they could neuer sée before? no doubt they had turned ouer and ouer, both the Old and the New Testament many a time, and warrant ye, all to haue found out this immediate institution of God, and yet was it neuer their happe (vnfortunate blinde buzzardes that they were) to light on the place of this Institution.
But now the Bible and Testament hath bene so turned and tossed once againe at Louaine, and that with such cléere eye sights, that it is plainly founde out, yea and so cléere, that euery man of meane learning knoweth it, that the Pope is supreme head ouer all the whole Church, instituted by God immediatly, to be obeyed vnder the paine of eternall condemnation.
happie man for the Pope (whose estimation and welth began so fast to decay) that yet at the last hath founde out this institution.
warrant ye like to weare a Cardinals hatte M. Stap if you haue had so good lucke, to finde this out.
But pray you (since it is so plaine a place, that all your side now cléerely séeth it) shew where aboutes in the Bible or Testament it is.
haue of purpose turned them ouer ere now also, yet could neuer haue the hap to sée this.
But hope your sight be better than mine, pray you tell vs where it is, do but quote the place, is it not peraduenture on the backe side of your booke? for in your booke it is to be doubted ye shal finde no more, than could those learned men before you, finde out.
That it was ordayned but Iure humano, by the law of man.
And where ye crake so much, that ye haue now founde it instituted lure diuino, by the law of God, am afrayd it will in the ende be found out, to haue ben forged fraude Diabolca, by the iniurie and craft of Sathan.
That it is not Iure diuino, by Gods lawe, your selfe alleaging no place or proofe besides your onely vaunt, fearing ye should be put to the proofe of your crake, ye starte from it againe by admitting that if ye could not (as ye ca~ not) proue so much as ye haue made boast of, though the Popes primacie (say you) were not ordeyned of God, yet could it not be reiected by any one realme.
And although the Popes primacie were not grounded directly vppon Goddes worde, but ordeyned of the Churche, yet could it not be abrogated by the priuate consent of any one or fewe realmes, no more than the Citie of London can iustly abrogate an acte of Parliament.
The sequcle of this argument M. Stapleton is nought by thrée wayes.
First by presupposing an impossible absurditie that the true Churche of Christ should ordeyne any other necessary doctrine to saluation, than God hath ordeyned or is grounded on his woorde.
The spouse of Christ heareth hir husbande, my sheepe (saith Christ) heare my voice, and not the voice of a straunger.
Seco~dly if this absurditie were admitted, that the church of Christ should or could (as it ca~ not) ordeine other things, yet should not we be bounde to follow it, no though an Angell came from Heauen, to teach vs any thing that is not onely contrarie, but euen praeter besides the woorde of God.
And thus the Fathers of the Church the~ selues haue taught vs, to reiect it as easily as to receyue it, what soeuer hath not his authoritie out of the Scriptures.
And what wee finde not in the Scriptures, we may vse them euen as we list our selues.
Why may we not say as S. Augustine saide, Quia Canonicum non st, non me astringit.
Bicause it is not the Canonicall Scripture it bindeth me not to beleue or receyue it? but of this matter furder as ye giue furder occasion.
Thirdly your argument of proportion from a Parliament to London fayleth, standing on your olde and vayue presupposals, that we haue graunted or must graunt you, that your Popish Church is the true Churche.
That Christian realmes haue the same respect to your Popish church, that a Citie in any Realme hath to the whole estate of the same Realme, and againe that your Popes violent Councels, are as frée, lawfull, and generall, and enact onely as Godly decrées and constitutions, to the directing of the true Churche, as the Parliaments of a realme be frée, lawfull and generall, and enact godly lawes and constitutions, for their policies and estates.
All these things beyng nothing proportionable, we must graunt you to be true and fitte, or else this your argument, and your former crake, neyther barell better herring, may go togither a Gods name.
The rest of your counter blast to this diuision, as it is nothing materiall, so it is eyther altogither wordes of course, or else a petit quarell that ye lappe vp all the matter withall, bicause the Bishop called this sentence, a sentence of the Holy Ghost, In malelam animam non sapientia: VVisedome shall not enter into a frowarde soule: which bicause it is mere impertiuent and friuolous, haue reiected it to your common places.
Discorde on our doctrine can ye gather none thereon, but you would faine sowe discorde where none is, and yet ye boast of vnitie.
But if ye remembered, (setting all other discordes aside) how well as is afore sayd, your Sorbonists, and your Louanists, and you Thomas Stapleton agrée euen with your owne swéete S. Thomas of Aquine, and how your tale agreeth with it selfe, how it excuseth and accuseth M. Feckenham, ye should then sée who they be, that as ye say, in place of vniforme tuning ruffle vs vp a blacke Sanctus, who they be that chaunging their shapes like Proteus, haue so often altred their religion, and whether they touch M. Feckenham and you, or any of your chiefe Masters yea or no.
THe Bishop hauing by Thomas his distinction of ignorance answered M. Feckenhams argument: descendeth to cope with M. Feckenham in his issue, and to proue the same by all the sayd meanes that he requireth.
And first to the issue, whiche was: That any Emperour or Empresse, King or Queene, may claime or take vpo~ them any suche gouernment in spirituall or Ecclesiasticall causes: The Bishop answereth that they ought to take such gouernment, Ergo: they may lawfully do it.
For his antecede~t that they ought, he referreth to the foure meanes of the issue, that M. Feckenham would haue it tried by.
M. Stapl. picking by quarels, of other pretended answers, made by the Bishop before, falsely surmising that he then denied, or mollified the woordes of the othe, and that now he answereth, without any molliiyng or restiaint, that the Queene ought to take vpon hir such kinde of regiment: these answeres he calleth so arring, variable, diuerse, and so contrary the one to the other, that if the one be true, the other must be false, and so concludes they be false and deceiueable both of them.
But M. St. this is a false and a deceiuable point of your owne deuising, from the which perceyue by the tenour of your whole counterblast, ye will neuer iarre nor varie one iote, except God sende you hereafter better grace and iudgement, than thus still to ground your self and your writings, on manifest lies and forgeries, and then presuppose them in your nodle, for manifest principles and truthes.
Thus do ye all your booke ouer, so ye play here.
First ye ground your selfe on a forged answere, that the Bishop should before haue made: imagining it must néedes be true, bicause you say ye certainly vnderstande, that M. Feckenham hath so reported to some of his friendes, that the Bishop made then another resolute answere.
This is all that ye all age for proofe of it, ye haue it but by heare say, at the hande of some partiall tale bearer, some tolde you, that M. Feckenham told some, that the Bishop tolde him, that this was his resolute answere, and you beleue it for a certentie, and write it solemnly in your booke, to deface the Bishop as it were with doubble and contrary answering, your selfe in the meane season answering nothing to the argument, nor to ye Bishops present and printed answere.
And therfore neede returne no other answere to you, than, that one tolde me, that another told him, that he told you, that ye were to light of credence, to beleue euery flimme flamme tale, and to rash of Iudgement, to clap downe such tales in your booke, of whiche ye had no better proufe, than that all the worlde should see, claw me claw thee, two false marchants néede no broker they say.
THe Bishop entring into his proufes of the issue, that Princes ought to take vpo~ them such gouernment in Ecclesiasticall causes, as the Queenes Maiestie doth chalenge and take vppon hit, among other properties belonging to the Princely office, to beginne with all, auoucheth out of Deut. the
with some expositoures vpon the same, that the Prince is commaunded to haue by him the booke of the lawe, to reade in it diligently, to this ende that he himselfe may learne the feare of God, and cause his subiects to become Israelites by his princely authoritie, redressing the peruersnesse of such a swerue from the ordinances and ceremonies appointed of God.
M. St. answere to this argument, resteth on foure faults that he findeth with the Antecedent, which he calleth vntruthes, so reckoneth them vp also in his score, but bicause they are the principall materiall pointes whereon his answere dependes, thought it more fitte to note them here.
But first after his scoffing, craking maner he saith to ye Bishop: Go on saie in Gods name, M. Horne, and prosecute your plea stoutly: God sende you good speede.
And so he doth, eue~ such as ye, the honestie of your cause deserue. &c.
But all these his fromps and vaunts ouerpasse and referre them to his common places, and will onely answere to that which he chargeth the Bishop withall, which is no lesse than infidelitie and vnskilfulnesse.
And to beginne with the later, bicause he saith it is the least matter and noteh it for the former vntruth.
Your vnskilfulnesse (saith he) whiche is the least matter, standeth in that ye say the King is commaunded to haue by him the booke of the lawe, your texte sayth not so ir, but Describet sibi Denteronomium legis huius in volumine: he shall write out this second law in a booke; as Edmund Beck, a man of your sect truly hath translated.
This is the least matter, saith M. Stapl. and yet this is so great a matter, that as a notable reproche, he fasteneth it also in the margine as it were with a tenne penny nayle (to vse his own phrase) M. Hornes vnskilfulnesse· But if M. St. did not play the vnskilfull hypocrite him selfe, but had pulled the beame of vnskilfulnesse out of his owne eye, he should then haue cleerely séene, that the Bishop vsed good skill in citing his text faithfully, and he in thus reprhe~ding the Bishop hath shewed so litle skill, and so much infidelitie, that though he him selfe be paste shame, yet M. Feckenham, and all his fréendes may well ashamed of him.
Ye say (saith M. Stapleton) the King is commaunded, to haue by him the booke of the lawe, your text saith not so sir.
Forsooth sir the text saith so by your leaue, the text hath bothe, and therefore it is not the Bishop but you that lie, both vnskilfully and also vnfaithfully therein.
Put on your spectacles, reade your text againe, and dare say, except your lippes hang in your lighte, ye shall within sixe woordes following, finde these woordes, Et habebit secum, and he shall haue it with or by him, or as Munsterus translateth it, Erit{que} illud pens em, and it shalbe about him, or appertayning vnto him.
So that here appeareth plainly your skilfull fidelitie, (if it be not done rather of peruersitie and malice, to vse your owne woordes) in deniyng the Scripture to say that, which in plaine woordes it saithe, and in calling that an vntruth in translation, which euidently is a very true translation.
This vntruth therefore must be cutte of from your talie, and nicked vpon your score.
The second fault founde with the Bishop in his antecebent, is an vntruth (as M. Stapleton hath scored it vp) in leauing out a parte of the sentence materiall.
Your infidelitie (saith he) appeareth in the curtalling of your texte, and leauing out the woordes that immediatly go before those that ye alleage.
What were these woordes that the Bishop did alleage? That he haue by him the Booke of the lawe.
Say ye me so M. Stapleton? then, if the Bishop haue left out the wordes of Moses, that immediatly go before those that he alleaged, euen by your owne confession these wordes alleaged, do come immediatly after those that ye say the Bishop left out.
Dye not sée what a manifest lier your owne testimonie proueth you.
Within sixe lines folowing, ye affirme that the text hath not these wordes, and here ye say they follow immediately.
You are full of gathering contradictions, what call ye this, it followeth in the text immediatly, and, it is not in the text at all.
Where is your Logike that ye boaste of? are not these contradictories? so that vnlesse ye ca~ ake two contradictions true, ye haue made your selfe in the one an open lier.
Alacke M. Stapleton where was your remembrance? Mendacem memorem esse oportet a lier should haue a good memorie least he faulter.
But how say ye to this, the Bishop hath leaft out a parte of the sentence materiall, he hath curtalled his· text.
The later worde he hath (bicause they make directly against him) quite least out.
Hath he so M. St.? verily that were a foule faulte, and infidelitie in deede.
But what againe if he haue not done so, if he haue left out no parte of the sentence which he cited, what if those wordes which M. Stapleton would adde out of another sentence, would not make any thing against the Bishop, were he not then cléered of this faulte, and might it not redounde to the faultfinder? And by your leaue M. Stapl. though will not herein charge ye with infidelitie, vnlesse ye wist it, but impute it rather to want of knowledge, yet at the least, it is one of your vnskilfull lies, for the sentence, Et habebit seum, &c. and he shall haue it by him, and shall reade it all the daies of his life, that he may learne to feare the Lorde, his God, and keepe his woordes and ceremonies, whiche are commaunded in the Lawe, is an whole and perfect sentence, and as the Hebrues call it a Pasuk. which, if not so much as perusing the Hebrue or Chaldee text, yet if, meaning a truth, ye would haue looked vpon the translation of Sanstes Pagninu or Munsterus, ye should haue séene it to be a full period and sentence of it selfe.
So that the Bishop is sufficiently discharged of all vnfaithfulnesse, nor hath curtalled any sentence that he alleaged, nor left out any later, former, or middle parte, materiall, or not materiall thereof.
But now M. Stapleton, looke you to it, least you be founde herein a passing vnfaithfull lyer, not onely on the Bishop, but on the holy Scripture also.
What was his text? he shall haue by him the booke of the lawe.
What woordes follow immediatly after? and he shall reade it all the dayes of his lyfe, to the ende that he may learne to feare the Lorde his God, and keepe all his wordes and ceremonies that are commaunded in the lawe.
All this the Byshop cited and expounded also: hath he then curtalled his text, M. Stap. that so throughly and so largely hath set out the same? Tushe, saye you, he lefte oute the wordes that immediatly go before those that he alledged.
Why, M. Stay. call ye that curtalling? curtalling is to cut off those wordes that come behinde.
To cut off those wordes that immediatly go before, was rather to behead his text, than to curtall it.
And do ye not sée withall how contrarie ye speake to your selfe, they be the latter wordes and they be the words that immediatly go before? If they be the wordes that go before, they be not the latter wordes, if they be the latter, they be not those that went before, vnlesse they come twise bothe before and after, and so the head and the tayle of the sentence is al one, and the byshop cutteth off both head and tayle away, according to your popishe vsage of the Scripture.
But then where ye say, he leaueth out a material parte of the sentence, ye should haue sayde he tooke away, all that is materiall, and not one materiall parte thereof.
And those words which ye say come after, and that the byshop leaueth them out, bicause (ye say) they make directly agaynst him, they come not after at all, but playnly are set before.
And muche maruell with what impudent face ye durst chalenge the byshop for curtalling his texte, when he telleth all the wordes that followe, both of the sentence he cited, and of that whiche commeth after also: and yet your selfe so flatly belye the Scripture, for malice to the byshop, in saying, suche wordes that the byshop lefte out do followe which neither followe at all: and your selfe before confessed, they went immediatly before.
Lesse maruell it is that ye sawe not the period, for although those wordes whiche ye cite, as lefte oute, taking a copie of the Priest, and the Leuiticall tribe, wordes going before the bishops sentence, and he shall haue by him. &c. yet is there a ful period betweene them, which you saw not, or would not sée, so that those former words are no materiall part of the sentence following cited by the byshop, but a material part of the sente~ce going before, which the byshop cited not.
But M. St. citeth falsly threapeth that the bishop did cite it, and in citing it, lefte out a materiall parte thereof, charging the byshop in these wordes, after suche order as your owne text appoynteth· saying: VVhen he is set vpon the seate of hys kingdome, he shal write him out this second law in a booke, taking a copie of the Priestes of the Leuiticall tribe.
VVhich latter wordes ye haue, bicause they make directly agaynst you, quite lefte out.
Why, M. Stap. he left out bothe the latter, middle, first wordes, and all of this sentence, he mentioned it not at all, ye doe but threapen kindnesse on him, to fasten withall vpon him your chalenge of infidelitie.
Onely he alleaged the nexte sentence, and that expounding it so fully, that he leaueth oute neither former, latter, or any materiall poynte at all thereof..
And thus muche doth your selfe also witnesse agaynst your selfe, saying, that he lefte ot vvordes that immediatly goe before the vvordes vvhich he alleadged.
And what were those? he shall haue by him. &c.
This then was the texte that he alleaged by your owne confession.
And therfore when ye vrge him with the former texte that he alleaged not, to proue infidelitie in him: ye contrarie your selfe, ye cleare him, ye shewe your owne excéeding vnfaythfull dealing, bothe to the scripture, and to him also.
But wherefore should the Byshop haue left out (as ye charge him) any materiall parte of his texte? bycause (say you) it maketh directly agaynst him.
In déede that were a shrewde cause, and would iolily cloke M. St. infidelitie, and cause men to suspect infidelitie in the bishop, if he had concealed any thing in his text, that directly made against him.
Which infidelitie who vseth, and who approueth it, for the poynt of a wise man, to conceale that, that maketh agaynst him, shal after wel appeare.
But now, although it be plainly proued, that the byshop in his text left out no part therof: Yet for further tryall of this also, let vs take not onely the latter wordes of the next period going before, which words he complayneth are lefte out, but euery worde also of the same sentence, concluding two or thrée periodes vnder one, bicause we would haue nothing left out, and ioyne them to the sentence following cited by the byshop, and then behold what maner of conclusion either directly, or indirectly they make agaynst him.
Wherin shall appeare, that M. St. hath so besotted himselfe in diuinitie, that he had quite forget the logike that so ofte he crakes vpon.
These textes are these: VVhen he is set on the seate of his kingdome, he shall write for him selfe out of this seconde law in a booke, taking a copy of the Priests of the Leuiticall tribe.
And he shall haue it with him, and he shall reade of it all the dayes of his life that he may learne to feare the Lorde his God, and keepe all the wordes and ceremonies that are written in the lawe.
The king shal write out this second law in a booke, taking a copy of the Priestes of the Leuiticall tribe: Ergo, a king ought not to take vpon him suche gouernement in ecclesiasticall causes, as the Quéenes maiestie doth chalenge and take vpon hir.
For this is the conclusion that directly maketh agaynst the bishop: but as herein his logike is altogither vnskilfull, so is his diuinitie yet more vnfaithfull.
For, hauing chalenged the bishop for leauing out these words, taking a copie of the priests of the Leuiticall trybe, as directly against him: and the~ immediately foloweth (sayth he) how he shall busily reade the sayde booke, and so foorth.
In which words he maketh another toto manifest lie, falsifying the text yet once againe.
For these words, Et habebit sec, he shal haue with him, which word he leaueth quite out, go betwéene, therfore followe not (as he sayth) immediatly.
But sée héere (whether it be of malice to the byshop, or to the Scripture) that all this while in quarelling with this little poore text, habebit secum, he shall haue with him, he findeth fault with translating, he accuseth the byshop of infidelitie and vnskilfulnesse, he complaineth of leauing out wordes going immediatly before, of curtalling the texte, and leauing out latter wordes, of leauing out a material part, of words following immediatly: he citeth and reciteth these and those wordes in Latin and Englishe, he scanneth and descanteth on translations, and all this while those onely three wordes, habebit secum, which the byshop alleaged, wrinching and wresting, he euer glaunceth by them, he will not once name them, but leaueth them quite out, which was the materiall thing that the byshop alleaged.
And yet all the while he whineth of leauing oute, and leaueth oute him selfe that he should chiefly answere.
What shall we thinke is the cause that he dothe thus? surely there is some force in those wordes, that he sawe were more directly against him, or else he would neuer do so for very shame.
But remember a tale that he hath patched vp into his counterblast, of the Simoniacall Priest, that béeing commaunded to say In nomine patris, filij, spiritus sanct, could rehearse all well inough, till he came to spiritus sancti: as for that, he could not pronounce it in any maner of wise.
But sée your chance M. Stap. that ye there fabled, howe here your selfe haue playde the like part.
The byshop vrgeth you with thrée wordes, habebit secum· ye will not onely answere nothing thereto, but ye will not in any wise, whyle ye repeate the sentences, so muche as name those wordes, and yet ye goe rounde about them.
On the other side, those wordes that the bishop cited not, as no parte of his sentence alleaged, Lorde what a doe ye make of curtalling, of leauing out, of infidelitie, vnskilfulnesse, peruersitie, malice, and can not tell what.
Onely bicause ye thinke those wordes séeme to make for your massing Priests authoritie, bicause they name Priests: and yet God wot they make nothing for you, nor agaynst the byshop directly or indirectly.
But you thinke this sentence maketh thus much for your priestes, that if the Prince hereon will clayme by the one sentence, to haue the knowledge of the lawe and worde of God: ye wil enforce of the other, that he shall haue no more therof, nor no otherwise, than it pleaseth you to licence him.
And so farre ye dare aduenture to say: VVell let the king reade in Gods name, not only that booke, but all the whole Byble beside, it is a worthy and co~mendable studie for him.
But let him beware that this sweete honie be not turned into poyson to him, and least vnder this pleasant bayte of Gods worde, he be sodenly choked with the topicall and pestiferous translation, wherewith ye haue rather peruerted than translated the Byble printed at Geneua, and in many other places, with your false dangerous damnable gloses, wherwith you haue corrupted and watred the same, and made it as it were of pleasaunt wine, moste sowre vineger.
The onely remedie and helpe to eschue and auoyde this daunger, is to take this booke, and other holy writings faythfully translated at the Priestes handes, as they from tyme to tyme haue receyued them.
Howe fitly ye apply your metaphors in making one thing in the same respect to be sweete hony, yet sowre vinegar, let others desca~t, How properly ye rap your friers monks on the balde, in vpbrayding gloses wherwith the worde of God hath bene watered and corrupted, let euen the Papistes be iudge them selues, whether it toucheth you or vs more néere.
How notably ye haue confuted the translation of the Geneua Byble, shall be declared, when ye shall set downe some one or other false worde or sentence translated in it.
Howe well you like that kinges should read the Byble, as a worthy and commendable studie for them, appeah, in that ye can away with no translation, nor yet your wyll set out any for them.
But howe well soeuer you like it, or at least dissemble for to lyke it, the moste of your complyces lyke it neuer a deale: Full sore agaynst whose willes it was translated in the mother tong of any prince or people.
But if it were so worthy and commendable a studie for Princes, why were not Christian Princes permitted to studie in it? why kepte ye them in ignoraunce? why limit ye them within the studie of ill affayres, of martiall policies, of hunting and hauking pastimes: But as for the worde of God not one word, no not to moue any talke thereof, sayth Cardinall Hosius.
And thinke ye they might then make the same their studie? but how soeuer ye ordered Princes as other people then: now that ye sée there is no remedie, Princes will be no longer deluded, but make it their studie in déede: with a false heart God knoweth, ye say, well let the king reade in Gods name, not onely that booke, but all the whole Byble beside.
If ye be thus liberall (master Stapl.) to Princes from your heart nowe, why did ye quarell with the byshop so muche before, for saying, he should haue by him the booke of the lawe, should he reade and studie the same, and yet not haue it by him? But perceiue ye are halfe wéerie of your owne wrangling, and therfore in the end, ye not onely graunt that he shall haue it by him, but also shall make the same his studie.
Now here if your fellowes aske ye, what ye meane to be thus liberall to princes, in permitting them to studie in the worde of God, in suche tonges as they vnderstand, which thing many of your felowes would stifly gaynsay: be content my masters may you say, it is not now time to striue to muche with princes, since they will néedes haue thus muche, let them haue it a Gods name, yea let vs séeme to giue it them franke and frée, but euer presupposed they muste haue it of our giuing, and then god inough, they were as good and perchaunce better without it· For here, after ye haue seriously warned princes to beware of our false gloses and translations: The onely remedie and helpe (say you) to eschue and auoyde this danger, is to take this booke and other holy writings faythfully translated, at the Priests hands, as they fro~ time to time haue receiued the~.
Some simple man, that heard ye, M. Stapleton, thus demurely preache of translations and glosinges, woulde perhappes thinke ye coulde not glose and translate so falsely so impudently as ye do, euen here, where ye reprehende the same in others.
Dothe your texte that ye beate so much vpon, mention these words, receiuing of it translated at the Priests hands, as they from time to time haue receiued it? or is there any suche meaning? First, there is no mention of any translating at all, but the text sayth, accipiens exemplar sacerdotibus Leuitic tribus: taking a copie of the priestes of the Leuiticall tribe: Or as other haue it, describet sibi exemplar huius legis, in librocoram sacerdotibus Lenitici generis.
He shall write out for him selfe a copie of this law in a booke before the Priestes of the Leuiticall tribe.
He speaketh not héere of any translation, for why, the lawe was wrytten in their owne mother tongue.
Nowe bicause to other Princes it is giuen translated, can ye inferre hereon, the Priests onely should haue the translating of it? or béeing translated, it should be receiued onely at the Priests handes, as they from time to time haue receiued it? wherby it should follow, that had the translation passed any continua~ce from time to time, it should be forced on vs for a faythful translatio~, were it neuer so false: which is appara~t in the old translation that hath long time fro~ time to time continued falsly vnder S. Hieroms name, as both appeareth by S. Hieroms works, also S. Hierom co~futeth this fond reason.
Neither was he moued with ye outcries of those in his time, yea euen of S. Austine, yt cried on him as you do now on the learned tra~slators in our time.
Neither might ye word of god hereby be tra~slated into any other to~g, tha~ it hath ben tra~slated into of long co~tinuance fro~ time to time, thus should princes be debarred of the word of God, in which ye would haue them studie except you popish priests would translate it, per aduenture, to kéepe them from it, ye would say you should not deliuer any other translation, than hath bene vsed from time to time.
And yet to what prescription of time, ye wold driue vs off, it is vncerteyne.
This is false therfore, and ful of absurdities, that ye prattle of receyuing it translated at the Priestes handes, as they from time to time haue receiued it.
No (M. St. to borrowe your own termes) your text sayth not so sir, nor meaneth so.
But only that the prince should receiue it of the Leuiticall priests, as they had faythfully kept the word of God, from the first original setting out therof.
Ung double de ceste loy· ad exemplum libri sacerdotu~ Leuitaru~.
Quasi dicat ad exe~plu~ castigatissu~, ad exemplum eoru~ qui sunt periti in ea lege, quales sunt Leuitae.
He shall prouide for him selfe, that of this lawe there be drawen out a coppie, commonly called a transumpt.
According to the examples of the priests beeing Leuites (as who should say) after the best corrected copy, after their copie that are skilfull in the lawe, suche ones as the Leuites are.
But to receiue it after such a simple sorte, as in processe of time the Rabines and the Priests too, from time to time had watred it with their false gloses: as since that time, the popish Rabines of the schole friers, monkes, and priestes, from time to time with their false dangerous damnable gloses, haue corrupted and watred the same, and made it as it were, of pleasant wine moste sowre vineger: ye had néede to ryse betimes, M. Stap. or euer ye shall proue this vntimely consequence, by the text that you vrge so sore, or yet by any other.
Your argument is this: The king in the olde lawe, should receiue the coppie of the booke of the lawe, at the handes of the Priestes of the Leuiticall tribe: Ergo· If Princes now will haue the Bible, they must receyue it of such, and after such manner, as the popish priests will from time to time deliuer it to them.
Now, not seing ye extreme folie of your sequele, ye runne on headlong as though all were yours, and say: if this order had of late yeares bene kept, and that Princes and other had taken the Bible as it is and euer hath bene of the Priestes of the Catholike churche (orderly and lawfully succeeding one the other as the Leuites did) read, taught, and expounded, as well in Greke and Hebrue as in Latine, these errours and heresies should neuer haue taken so deepe a roote as they haue now caught.
Here is bibble babble inough but no argument, and all runnes vppon his wonted presupposals, that our doctrine is heresies and errours, that they be the Priestes of the Catholike churche.
That they orderly and lawfully succeede one the other, as did thee Leuites.
That they haue euer redde taught and expounded the Scripture, in Greeke, Hebrewe, and Latine.
And that this their order from time to time, hath euer bene, till of late.
Let all these thinges be graunted to M. Stapl. for vndoubted principles, and then let him alone.
But if a man denied all these things (beyng euery one so apparant false) proued that our doctrine were not those dangerous gloses, errours, or heresies, but the expresse infallible worde of God: if he denied that their Church were the Catholike Churche, otherwise than in that sense that the scholler of Oxford, by a certeine woman whom other praysed, did merily say, she was a Catholike woman, meaning a common queane, so the Popishe church in like sense is a Catholike church, that is to say, a common strumpet prostitute to all Idolatrie, and not the chaste espouse of Iesu Christe: if he denied not onely such orderly succession in your Pope, his Bishops, and Priests now, as was of the Leuites then, they beyng expresly ordeyned of God, you beyng not ordeined of God at all: but also proue that suche succession as it is, (whiche in dede may better be called degeneration) is altogether vnorderly and vnlawful: If hée denyed that they did alwayes reade, teache and expound the scripture in Hebrue, Greke and Latine, when euen among the moste of theyr greate Schoole doctours, in that blynde tyme, they had vneth any meane skill in Latin, muche lesse, or nene at all in gréeke or Hebrue: As for the moste of their morrow Masse Priestes lyke blynde guydes, were so farre from reading, teaching, and expounding the Scriptures to the people, out of any other tongues, that euen in their mother toung they scarse knewe one worde thereof themselues: If he denyed that they woulde haue the Scripture redde, taughte and expounded at all, but on the contrarie woulde haue no translation, other than their common latin translation, which howe corrupte it is, is manyfeste: as Besides the Protestantes, Caietanus, Erasmus, Pagninus, Catharinus, and others of themselues are enforced to confesse it: If he denied that the Popishe handling of Gods woorde, hathe bene the order that hath euer bene, but is quite contrary to the originall Institution, to the aunciente order, and is of muche later tymes, as corruption from tyme to tyme hathe taken deeper roote.
If a man thus denyed all these his Principles, til tyme be that M. Stapleton shall proue them better, than onely by dreamyng that wée graunte them for true, whyche are called into greate question, and denyed of vs for manyfest false: Then is all the fatte in the fire, and thys Mast.
Neuerthelesse, M. Stapleton styll procéedyng on, as thoughe all these thynges were out of question: Neyther is this place onely mente (sayeth he) that the King shoulde take the bare letter, but rather the exposition vvithall, of the sayde Priestes.
For vvhat vvere the king the better, or any man else for the bare letter, if hee hadde not also as ordinarie a vvaye for his direction in his vnderstandyng, as hee had prouided him for to receyue a true and an incorrupted copie? VVhereof wee may see the practise in all ages in the catholike Churche, whereof this place is the very shadow and figure.
And herewithal he setteth vp in his margin this note: bothe the bookes of the Scripture, and the exposition muste be taken at the priestes handes.
The argumente is this: The king in the olde lawe must receiue not only the bare letter of the priestes handes, but the exposition withall: Ergo, Christian Princes muste receyue that sense of the Scripture, that the Popishe priestes doe please to expounde vnto them.
As there is none truste so simple, that séeth not the fondnesse of this argumente, so agayne eche man may perceyue, that the more M. Stapleton trauayleth on these wordes (whiche he sayth be vnfaithfully lefte out,) hée shall not onely shewe the more his owne vnfaithfulnesse: but detecte also the vnfaithfull dealing of all his Romishe priestes and Churche.
For where as this place sayeth, that the Leuiticall Priestes shall delyuer to the Kyng a perfecte and true Coppie of the Lawe of God, whyche hée shall vvrite oute and haue it by him.
And that the Priestes shoulde not delyuer onely the bare letter, but withall the exposition therof, not expounded after their fantasies, as dyd the Scribes and Phariseis, in one place by the bare letter, whiche Christ confuteth Math.
In an other place, by their owne inuentions and traditions, but one place truly expou~ded by an other, and so deliuer it faithfully to their Prince: And that this order then was the verye shadowe and figure of the true Churche novv: But then is it most euident that the Popishe Churche is not the true Churche, nor was figured hereby at all.
For first the popishe Prestes deliuered not a coppie of the lawe of God, to wete, of the Old and New testament vp into their Kings, Queenes and Princes handes, to write it out and haue it alwaies by them to studie vppon: but rather do the contrary as did the Pharisies, keping the key of knowledge away from them of purpose, telling them it appertaineth not to their estates: but that they may go play them, or employ them selues in other foreigne matters, onely the worde of God they must in no case meddle withall, which belongeth alonely to the Priests.
Nor they will be bounde to deliuer vp to their Princes any coppie thereof at all.
But thus much yet they will do for their Princes, to giue them a péece here and there, and that either must be the bare letter as M. Stapleton calleth it, or els such expositions, as it shall please them to leauen the dough withall.
And is this now the perfect bodie of that shadow, the veritie of that figure set forth in Moses order? or not rather the full accomplishing of the Scribes and Pharisies doings? whom they haue so followed in not giuing vp a coppie to their Princes, in wresting, defacing and taking away Gods worde, that theirs may better be said to be a very shadow and figure of the Popish priests dealings herein.
And that we rather expresse the veritie of that figure and shadow of Moses order, rendring vp to our Princes a full, perfect, and sincere coppie of Gods lawe, that they may write it out, set it forth, haue it by them and meditate therein day and night (as King Dauid counsayleth) to learne thereby to be wise and feare the Lord their God: and by them all their subiects.
And thus his importune vrging of this place hath so properly helpt his matter forwarde, that where he saith, the Bishop left it quite out as making directry against him, what soeuer the Bishop did, it had bene better for M. Stapl. to haue left it quite out, also: or not to haue triumphed so much on that, which at the better view thereof, so directly maketh against all his popishe Priestes.
But for all this, M. Stapleton will proue, that the popish priestes must not onely haue the handling of Gods worde: but also that they can not be deceyued, nor erre in the sense thereof.
And this will he proue euen by the Protestants them selues.
For (sayth he) as the Protestants them selues are forced by plaine wordes to confesse, that they knowe not the true worde or booke of God, but by the Churche: whiche from time to time deliuered these bookes, euen so by all reason and learning they shoulde also confesse that the Churche can no more be deceyued, in deliuering the sense of the sayde worde, than in deliuering the worde it selfe.
VVhich seeing they will not confesse, (for then we were forthwith at a point and ende with all their errours and heresies) they must nedes continue in the same.
The Protestants confesse that they know not the worde of God but by the Churche (of Christ) that kéepeth, witnesseth and agnizeth the same from time to time.
Ergo the Protestants must néedes confesse, that the Church (he meaneth the Popishe priestes) in deliuering of the worde can not be deceyued in the sense thereof.
In stéede of aunswere hereto, master Stapleton him selfe maketh a preoccupation, for perceyuing the falsenesse and follie thereof woulde soone be reiected: VVhich seeing (sayth he) they will not confesse (for then we were at a point with all their errours and heresies) they must needes continue in the same.
Do we not confesse, master Stapleton that ye woulde haue vs confesse? why then haue ye reasoned all this while thus fondly, taking that for confessed which your selfe now are forced by plain wordes to confesse, that we confesse not, but vtterly denie, that you be the Catholike Church, that you haue deliuered these bookes from time to time, (which you haue rather hid away) that you can not erre in the sense the scripture, and such like wrong principles.
Which in déede if we shoulde falsely confesse with you, then all the matter were at a poynt and ende, as ye saye.
But since we denie it, and reiect your fonde reasoning, petitione principij, it is tyme that ye séeke out other arguments more substantiall, or else as your cause is at a poynte, or not worth a poynt: so in conclusion ye stande on this poynt, to slaunder vs, as following euery man his owne heade, and that we shal neuer haue done, and errours will neuer cease more and more to encrease and multiplie, vnlesse we take forth (say you) the lesson haue shewed you.
And what lesson is that? Forsooth that we must graunt and confesse to be most true, all these your false principles.
And then we shall be your white sonnes, and good scholers dare say, if once we would conne that lesson.
Ye would giue vs a fat remedie, and leaue to play the fooles truands all day long, if we would learne that lesson of yours.
But such scholemasters as are, such schollers ye desire to haue, and suche lessons ye take them forth.
Caecus autem si caeco ducatum prestet, ambo in foueam cadunt.
If the blinde leade the blinde, both of them fall into the ditch.
Thus ye deceyued the princes and people in tymes past.
But God be praysed both Princes and people haue now taken forth that lesson, out of Gods holy word, that ye could not, or neuer would teach, read or expound vnto them.
Nowe when ye haue redde this lesson vnto vs, with so false a glosse and commentarie vpon the text, (as ye complaine) left out: ye determine that the best remedie were the exact obseruation of this place that ye haue (say you) so wilyly and sleightly slipt ouer.
This is but a poynt of your apparant impudencie master Stapleton, to set a bede face on the matter, for God knoweth ye would nothing lesse, than that the diligent reader shoulde exactly obserue this place.
Whiche if he did, this place alone, (were there no more) woulde sufficiently shewe howe ye haue haled and racked it, and all the lawe of God besides.
That this place therefore (if the exact obseruation thereof be the best remedie to your cause, as ye say) might remedie your cause the better, haue somewhat the more exactly obserued it, and if your cause haue founde any remedie thereby, muche good doe it you, ye shall haue more of it.
So that trust yée shall not néede to complaine of ouerslipping any thing materiall.
Which least ye should doe, the Chapter shall be yet more exactly obserued than perchaunce ye would haue it to be.
And to begin with that ye quarrell at next, as wilily and sleightly slipt ouer.
But most of all (say you) another sentence in the verie said Chapter.
And euen the next to this ye alleage that the king as soone as he is chosen shall bestowe his studie vppon the reading of the Deuteronomie.
VVhere Moses sayth that in doubtfull causes, the people shoulde haue their recourse to the sayde Priestes, and to the iudge for the time being meaning the highe Priest, of whome they shoulde learne the truth: and are commaunded to doe accordingly, euen vnder paine of death.
All this ye say the Bishop wilily and sleightly slipt ouer, and yet in the verie sayde Chapter it was euen the next to that he alleaged.
Alacke master Stapleton that euer yée should for shame haue thus ouerslipt your selfe.
Were ye not halfe a sléepe, when ye made this slippe? For will not recharge you so harde wyth wylinesse and sleight, but with palpable grosnesse, and marueylous negligent ignoraunce, in a student of diuinitie, to beate so much vppon a text as you doe here, charging your aduersarie wyth wylinesse, sleight, vnfaythfulnesse, vnskilfulnesse, leauing out, curtalling, and ouerslipping, and your selfe shewe so little skil, or regarde, in citing your text, that eyther ye know not, or ye care not what commeth before, what commeth after, what commeth next, what commeth not next, nor nere it.
Ye saye that the sentence of the Priestes and the Iudges iudgements on doubtfull cases, commeth euen the next, to that the Bishop alleaged in the verie sayde Chapter.
Turne your booke to the Chapter once againe M. Stap. reade the wordes that come next, yea all the wordes that follow in that Chapter.
Nor his heart shall be lifted vp in pride aboue his brethren, neyther shall he turne to the right hande or to the left, that both he and his childe may raigne long time ouer Israell.
Doth not this follow next and is not this the last sentence of the sayde Chapter? Then if it be in that verie Chapter, it commeth not as you say next vnto it, but must néedes go before, and so doth it.
Neyther yet the next before, for there commeth betwene them fiue or six periods at the least.
And as they are two diuerse places, so are they two sundrie matters.
Ye charge therefore the Bishop amisse, with wilie and sleight ouerslipping, where nothing is ouerslipped, though the former sentence be not alleaged.
The King shall bestow his studie vpon the reading of the Deuteronomie, where Moyses sayth that in doubtfull causes.
Ye falsely say it commeth next to it, which it doth not, but goeth before, in another matter, and diuerse sentences betwene.
What a foule ouerslippe was this of you, that could prie so narrowly to séeke a slippe ouer a slipper in anothers footing, where was not so muche as any tripping awrie, and your selfe vnawares haue slipt into a foule lie ouer the sloppes and all.
But if we let slippe this, as but a grosse ouerslippe, yet maye we not so let slip M. Stapletons slipperie and false exposition, for all he sayeth, that their priestes can not expounde the scripture amisse.
For where the text sayth, the people sholde haue their recourse to the priestes, and to the iudge for the time beeing: meaning (sayth M. Stapleton) the high priest: In déede so doth his popishe glosse interline it, and yet euen Lyra that woulde shift of the matter, as much as he might, for his Pope, with his morall or rather marre all gloses hereon: both noteth in his margin that these be twaine, summ sacerdos, iudex, the high Priest and the Iudge.
In these and the like cases, they must runne vnto the higher Iudges, that is to say· to the high Priest, and to the chiefe Iudge of Israell.
And althoughe sometime it chaunced, that one person had both these offices as appeareth by Hely, who was both chiefe Iudge, and chiefe Priest, yet for the most part, as they are distinct offices, so were they commonly in distinct and seuerall persons.
And to proue this further by the penaltie, which as you say was vnder the paine of death, the which iudgement apperteyned to the Iudge, but ordinarily it was not lawfull for the high priestes, to iudge any man to death, as euen the wicked priestes, to cloke their murther, when Pilate sayde vnto them, Accipite eum vos. &c. Take you him and iudge him according to your law, coulde replie (like to the papisticall Priestes, that post of the bodyes death to the temporall power) Nobis non licet quem{que} interficere, It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man: but the Iudge that this place speaketh of, should ordinarily condemne to death the refuser, Ex indicis decreto moriatur homo ille, Let that man die by the iudges decree.
Ergo he meaneth not that this ordinarie Iudge shoulde be the high priest.
Besides this the very text is plaine, in making this distinction, to the Priestes, and to the Iudge, not to the Iudge meaning the Priest.
Againe, The commandement of the high Priest, and the decree of the Iudge.
Which fully importeth that he meaneth not the one by the other, but expresseth two diuerse persons, and two seuerall offices distinctly.
Wherfore master Stapleton apparantly wresteth the text, thus flatly to say, that he meaneth the high Priest by the name of Iudge, to proue that his Pope hath no péere, but all iudgement remayneth in him alone, in euery difficult matter of religion.
And here againe appeareth another of his false and purposed ouerslippes.
Moses (sayth he) doth say that in doubtfull causes the people should haue their recourse to the priests.
Whie doe ye here master Stapleton forget your former marginall censure, of leauing out anie materiall partes of the sentence? telling vs of doubtful causes, but not telling vs what those doubtfull causes were, and speake as doubtfully as though they were matters of doctrine, religion, and ecclesiasticall ordinaunces, (which are the matters in question betwéene the partyes) when this place speaketh onely, of decyding a difficult or doubtfull matter, betweene bloud and bloud, plea and plea, plague and plague, in matters of stryfe: But none of these specifications, what maner of doutfull causes hée ment, woulde you expresse, for feare it woulde then bée to soone espyed, that this sentence made nothing at all for the supreme iudgement of your Pope.
And yet after these two sleightes, the one of remoouing the ciuill Prince or iudge from this iudgement with the Priestes, and ascribing all to the Priestes alone, to make it serue your purpose the better: The other by slipping ouer all these doubtfull causes, in the sentence expressed, as thoughe it were simplie spoken wythout anye specification, to make it serue for the Priestes absolute iudgemente in all ecclesiasticall ordinaunces: When ye haue wyth thys dubble sleyght and wylinesse thus wrested the Text, then come yée in ruffling lyke a lustye Rutterkin, and swappe mée downe hereon this iolie marginall note.
An other sentence in the sayde Chapter by master Horne alleaged that ouerthroweth all his boast.
God saue al master Stapleton, here is no small boast trowe.
We had nowe néede to beware betymes, for feare the Bishoppe be here quite ouerthrowne, since that master Stapleton maketh so prowde a chalenge.
Let vs therefore take héede to hys argument on thys place.
VVhiche place (sayeth he) well weighed and considered, serueth to declare that haue sayde, that the King and others, shoulde receyue not onelye the letter, whiche as Saint Paule sayeth doeth kyll, but the true and syncere meaning withall, wherein standeth the lyfe of the letter, as the lyfe of man wythin hys bodie, yea the eternall lyfe (whereof by following lewde lying expositions of holye witte, wee are spoyled) at the Priestes handes.
Is this the conclusion of all this great crake M. St. that the B. should be quite ouerthrowne by this sentence? what one word is here, not only of this sentence, but euen of your owne well weighed and considered conclusion theron, which hath come nere vnto, much lesse ouerthrowne the Bishops assertion? Which if ye would haue ouerthrowne, ye should haue concluded agaynst it, and thus haue reasoned.
Moses sayde to the people of Israell, if any hard or doubtfull thing in iudgement rise vp with thee, betwixt bloud and bloud, plea and plea, plague and plague, in matters of strife within the Citie. &c. Go to the Priestes and vnto the Iudge that shall be in those dayes. &c. Ergo a Christian king ought not to chalenge or take vpon him any such supreme gouernment in ecclesiasticall matters as doth ye Queenes maiestie.
But who séeth not that this sentence is to farre fetched to inferre any such conclusion? And therfore master Stapleton thoughe this was his butt on whiche his ey shoulde haue béene fixed, and brought his proues to haue improued this: yet durst he not once touche or come nighe it for very shame, for if he had, he sawe that euery boye in the scholes would haue hissed out his argument.
And therefore wilyly weighing and considering howe he might make it séeme to serue to some purpose, that he had craked on so much.
This place (sayth he) well weighed and considered serueth to declare that haue sayd, that Kings and others should receyue not onely the bare letter, but the true and sincere meaning withall. &c. at the priestes handes.
And is this all that this place serueth to, M. Stapleton? for dare say you haue well weighed and considered the matter, that from so great a boast, are so sodenly fallen into so déepe a consideration, of the bare letter killing, and the true quickening sense therof.
Wheras that text if ye would but meanely weigh and consider it once againe, neyther talketh of any killing letter, or liuing sense at all: but of certaine doubtfull cases of strife, nor can serue to confirme those sayings of Christ and Saint Paule, without manifest wresting of it.
But to what purpose doe ye so well weigh and consider that, whiche is nothing in question, and that which is in question, denyed, and you should proue: without any weighing or considering ye take it for confessed? Who doubteth of this that Princes should not onely receyue the bare letter, but the true sense and meaning withall at the priestes handes? This Princes in déede should do, which if they had alwayes done, they shoulde not haue receyued so many of their lewde lying expositions, as they haue done here to fore, at the priestes hands, who herein deceyued princes, and gaue them not the true meaning and sense togither with the copie of Gods worde: but debarred Princes of copie thereof, of letter, sense, and all: féeding them wyth the vayne fables, and lewde lying expositions, of theyr owne deuisings.
Wherefore Lyra noteth here vppon the Hebrue glosse, Hic dicit glossa Hebraica. &c. Here sayth the Hebrue glosse, if the priest shall say vnto thee that thy right hande, is thy left hande, or thy left hande, is thy right hande, this saying must be vpholden, which thing is manifest false.
For the sentence of no maner of man, of what authoritie so euer he be, is to be vpholden, if it conteyne a manifest falsehoode or errour.
And this appeareth by this, which is set before in the text.
They shall iudge vnto thee the truth of Iudgement: and afterward is set vnder: And they shall teach thee according to his lawe: whereby it appeareth that if the Priestes speake that which is false, or swarue from the law of God, they are not to be heard.
Thus sayth Lyra in (confuting the Hebrue glosars) of their hye Priests, that sayde they could not erre, and therefore what soeuer they taught must be beléeued.
And do not your Papistes say the same of the Pope, and your selfe holde the same of your Priestes expositions, that theirs alwayes muste be taken for the true sense? else wherto bring ye out this conclusion? In doubtfull cases of bloud, and ciuill actions of strife, the highe Priest, and the chiefe Iudge muste determine a finall sentence: Ergo, Princes muste receiue, not the letter of the scripture, but suche sense as the Popish priestes and the Pope, shall determine for the true sense in all controuersies of religion.
For this is the ful drift of your reason, though ye dare not for shame speake so playne.
But this argument, the more it is wayed, wayeth lyke a fether in the winde: and therefore ye turne the conclusion into generall words and say: Ergo, Princes and others muste receiue at the Priestes hands not onely the bare letter that killeth, but the true and sincere meaning therof withall.
Which co~clusion is not in controuersie, but on both parts graunted they oughtso to do, the Priests to deliuer to their Princes and others, the worde of God, and the true sense therof: and the Prince and others oughte so to receiue of them the same word of God, and the true sense thereof, and not the priests owne deuises and expositions.
But since that none haue euer done more co~trarie to this rule, sythe it was first giuen by Moyses, then haue the Popishe priestes: had not Christian princes great néede to beware of Popishe Priests gloses, and follow the councell of Lyra in reiecting them, as other good Princes haue done, to displace those false glosing priestes, and place faythfull disyensers of Gods mysteries in their roomes, and ouersée that their people be not deceiued in receiuing at the priests handes, quid pro quo? And for this cause the priest shoulde deliuer to his prince a perfect copy of the law, which M. St. wickedly termeth the bare letter that killeth, and thereto wresteth S. Paule, wresteth this sentence of the iudiciall law, among the Iewes for their time, in the foresaide ciuill controuersies: to be a simple rule for all christian common weales, in all ecclesiastical causes, excluding quite al iudgement from the prince, including it in his Pope Priests alone, iumbling the Prince and the people togither vnder the priests absolute determination.
Where this place ioyneth togither as colleages, the prince with the priest, or rather ascribeth the skil in suche doubtes to be defined by the learned and faythfull priest, and the full authoritie to giue iudgement, and to ratifie the Priestes sentence, in condemning the refusers to death, and in approuing the receyuers, to consist, not in the high Priest, but in the Iudge or Prince.
And thus this place, that he would so fayne wrest euery way agaynst Christian Princes, and for his Pope and popelings, béeing well wayed and considered according to his owne request: maketh nothing for his matter, nor for his shauelings, but cleane agaynst them.
And béeing better wayed and considered, maketh nothing against the Bishops cause, nor against christian Princes supreme gouernment, in ouerséeing correcting such false priests: but very muche for their duetie and chiefe authoritie therin.
M. St. hauing thus shamefully counterblasted the Byshops allegatio~, to set a good face on an euilfauorde matter: biddes the byshop go on, and crieth out that he hath goten the victorie, that the bishop is at his first encou~tring ouerblowne and discomfited euen with his owne blast.
And that it is not likely hereafter, that he shall bring any thing to resolue his aduersarie.
But as God would haue it, all these wordes are no blowes, nor arguments, but vayne triu~phes before he haue gotten the victorie: of the which he reckoneth him selfe so sure, that he graunteth the Byshops other allegation.
For as for the next place (sayth he) it enforceth no supremacie, we freely graunt you, that princes may sharply punish teachers of false and superstitious religion and Idolatrie (beeing therof by the Priests instructed) whiche is the matter of your texte.
This parenthesis, M. St. (beeing therof by the priests instructed) is the levvde lying glose of your owne forge.
The text hath no such matter of the priests instruction but what thinke you, doth enstruction more enforce an authoritie in the priest, than powre to punish correct doth enforce an authoritie in the prince? or doth this follow, that bicause the prince by the priests enstruction doth punish false teachers: Ergo he punisheth the~ by the priests authoritie? but as you fréely graunt that the prince may punish noughtie, false, and idolatrous priests, so that the priests instructio~ is any matter of the byshops text, or that his instruction should more enforce authoritie ouer the prince, than the princes punishment doth ouer false teachers: is both euident false, this we as flatly deny, as you do fréely graunt the other.
Howbeit, presupposing that we would also grau~t him this, that all things must still be done by the priests instruction: But then (sayth master Stap.) take heede to your selfe master Horne) and as though he him selfe were this instructour, for say to you (sayth he) that ye and your fellowes teache false and superstitious religion, many and detestable heresies, and so withall playne idolatrie.
In déede sir, so ye say, that full stoutly, braying out with say to you, but thanks be to God, ye do but say it to vs, ye do not proue it to vs, but and it were put to a double post, might it not proue a worde of course? and then take heede to your selfe master Stapl. for we not onely say to you, but by the worde of God proue it to you, that you and your felowes teach false and superstitious religion, many and detestable heresies, so withal plaine idolatrie. &c. and so haue ye giuen sentence agaynst your selfe, haue told the magistrate his office to punishe you as false teachers, that care not how ye falsifie wrest the scriptures to deface your aduersarie, the vnskilfulnesse and vnfaythfulnesse wherwith ye falsly charge him, euer double or treble, redounding vppon your selfe.
The residue of your proces on these two chalenges of vnskilfulnesse vnfaythfulnesse, referre to your common places of rayling, scoffes, and slaunders, and will answere to the thirde great faulte that ye finde in this diuision.
Nowe that ye bring out of Glossa ordinaria, (say you) that the Prince is commanded by his princely authoritie to cause his subiectes to become Israelites, it may perhaps be in some ordinarie glose of Geneua his notes, Bales, or some such like, but as for the olde ordinary Latin glose, am right sure (M. Horne) it hath no suche thing.
Are ye right sure therof, M. Stap? and hath it no suche thing in déede? will ye venter your poore honestie thereon? dare say ye would haue vs thinke, that ye haue looked on the ordinarie glose, whether any suche thing were there or no, else would ye neuer for shame so boldly affirme it.
But what speake of shame in so shamelesse a face, that boldly dare auouche he is right sure there is no suche thing, when if he had looked in ye ordinary glose, except he would of purpose looke from it, he could scantly misse it, euen at the first viewe.
The wordes of the glose vpon super Israel, are these: Benedictio est regnare super Israel.
It is a blessing to raigne ouer Israell, that is to saye, by raigning (which the Byshop Englished, by his Princely authoritie) to make or cause to become Israelites, that is to wete, folkes seeing God.
The Bishop Englished the sentence playnly, by his Princely authoritie to cause his subiectes to become Israelites.
And what is here that is not onely in summe of sentence, but in the very emphasis or force of the bare wordes, all one with the glose? and yet this moste impudent, what should call him, vnskilfull or vnfaythfull lyer, or both, chalengeth the Bishop of vntruth, and sayth he is right sure there is no such thing.
In what thing wil this man stick, to outface the simple vnlearned, that dare thus deale with such a lerned father? and co~mit it to print to be examined of any lerned reader, and crake of such assurance, as though he had poared ouer al the booke for it, euen at the first chop, he is found an open lyer.
But doubt whether euer he looked on the booke at all, but trusted some retchelesse superuisor.
For if he had looked but ouer the head of the verie texte, Ut longo tempore regnet, That he might long time reigne, hée shoulde haue founde noted on this worde Regnet, corporaliter spiritualiter, That hee shoulde reigne or exercise his Princely authoritie a long tyme, Bodily and spiritually, not onely to haue a regiment in lay, temporall and ciuile matters, as M. St. affirmeth, but euen in spirituall matters also.
And had he but looked a little higher on these wordes, Leget{que} illud omnibus diebus vitae su.
He should read it all the days of his life, He should haue found, Vsus reddit magistrum, the vse (of reading the worde of God) makes the king a maister (in Gods worde) that is to say, a setter forth or teacher thereof as it were.
Upon whiche the ordinarie Glose sayth, Nota quan assiditate legere debent Sacerdotes, assidue legant reges.
Lectio ipsa est lux vit: vnde verba qua ego loquor spiritus vita sunt.
Note with howe muche continuaunce the Priestes ought to reade the worde of God, when Kings should reade it continually: The reading is it selfe the lyghte and the life, whereuppon sayth Christe, the words which speake are spirite and life.
Here M. Stapleton, the lyfe lyes not (as you sayde right nowe) in the Priests exposition, but in the word it selfe, and the continuall reading thereof: wherein not onely the Priest, but the Prince, is a kynde of Maister: But are ye not right sure, none of this is there neyther? ye were best to say so, for perceyue ye haue an excellente grace to face downe a matter, bée it neuer so playne and open.
Let vs nowe come to the fourthe and laste fault, that he gathereth against the Bishop in this diuision whiche is also an vntruth (as he saith in his margin) the place of the Deuteronomie flady belied and adding this vnto the other before, he saith, This therfore may wel stand for an other vntruth, as also that which immediatly you alleage out of Deu.
for in al that chapter or in any other of that booke, there is no such worde to be founde as you talke of.
Uerily beléeue our student M. St. had for studied himself in a lasie slumber, and wrote this nodding half a sléepe, for ful awake for pure shame, he would neuer haue suffred such lewd lyes to scape his pen, come in dropping thus one in an others necke, as though he were at a poynte, he cared not what he sayd, neither against the playne truth, nor against himselfe, much lesse against the bishop: Euery worde that the B. rehearseth in the last end of this diuision, is fu~d plainly exprest in the xiij. and·
of Deut. which chapters ye Bishop quoted: The wordes of punishing teachers of fale and superstitious religion and idolatrie, in the former side of the leaf, he grau~teth himself to be in Deut. the.
Notwithstanding he forgetteth straight wayes what he sayd, affirmeth on ye other side of the leaf, that there is no such word to be found.
But as he trippeth on the truth in the first side, so on the other side of the same leaf, he flatly falleth into a flat lye, in both he tumbleth into a foule contradiction.
The prince by his authoritie may punish teachers of fale religion, superstition and idolatrie.
And may he do it withoute examining, whether the doctrine wherewith the teacher is charged be true or false, and being false whether he taught it or no? Suche may be the order in the Popes consistorie, but in Gods Courtes it is farre otherwise.
(as the Bishop auouched) the Prince, when any is denounced vnto him, to haue taught any false religion, that he make diligent examination, Quia no est procedendum ad sententiam (sayth Lyra vpon these wordes) fine dilige~ti examinatione praeuia, bicause he must not procede to giue sentence without diligent examination had before.
And this beeing found by the Princes diligent examination that he hath taughte false religion: he shall be put to deathe.
The laste wordes also of the Bishops diuision, to wete, Et aufres malum de medio tui, And thou shalt take away euil from among thee: Are they not plainly set foorth in both those chapters? So that a man might wonder that knewe not well Master Stapletons impudencie (seeing that all the poyntes that the Bishoppe speaketh of in the later parte of this Diuision, in the places of the Deuter· aboue mencioned, are so manifestly expressed) with what face M. Stapleton can so boldly affirme, that in al the·
chapter, or any other of that boke, ther is no such word to be found as the bishop talketh of.
And thus with more than a full messe of notorious vntruthes (to returne your owne conclusion M. Stapl. moste worthyly vpon your selfe, ye haue furnished the firste seruice, brought yet to the table, concerning the principal matter: howbeit perhappes though this be verie course, yet you haue fine dishes and dayntie cates comming after.
And as he sayth in the entrance of this diuision, Go on say in Gods name (M. St.) and prosecute your plea stoutely, God send ye good speede, and so he doth euen such as you and the honestie of your cause deserue, and at the first entrie of your plea, causeth you and your clerkly and honest dealing, forthwith to your high commendation so to appeare, that euen the firste authoritie that ye handle of all the holy Scripture, playnly discouereth you and causeth you to be espied, and openeth as well your fidelitie, as the weakenes of youre whole cause, the which euen with youre owne firste Counter blast is quite ouerblowen.
So fitly (M. St. al these your owne words do serue against your selfe.
IN this diuision the Byshop bringeth for his purpose two things, first he alleageth generally that the beste and moste godly princes that euer gouerned Gods people, did perceiue and rightly vnderstand, that to be Gods will, that they haue an especiall regarde and care, for the ordering and setting foorth of Gods true Religion, and therefore vsed great diligence, with feruent zeale, to performe and accomplishe the same.
Secondly, for proofe héereof, he entreth into his ensamples of the olde Testament, beginning with Moyses, that he was not the chiefe Priest or Byshop, but the supreme gouernour or Prince, and as chiefe gouernoure had the ordering of religion, whiche he dutifully executed with great zeale and care.
To the former parte and generall assertion of the Bishop, M. Stapleton only answereth by a marginall note, saying: Regarde, and chiefe rule, care and supreme gouernement, are two diuers things· Nowe forsoothe a solemne studied answere of a student in diuinitie, he is a silly wise man that vnderstoode not thus muche before without this marginal note.
Too simple were he in déed that séeth they be not al one, as he hath simply set them out.
But he that complained so late of curtalling and leauing out a materiall parte of the sentence, whiche dooing he calleth vnfaithfulnesse, sée howe vnfaithfully he hoffeth and curtalleth the Bishoppes sentence.
The Bishop spake not of simple care and reregarde, but of an especiall care and regarde for the ordering setting foorth of Gods true religion.
With which assertion M. Stap. findeth no fault, neither any worde goeth about to improue it, and so sheweth himselfe to agrée therewith, and by silence to confesse the truth thereof.
Now therefore let vs resolue the Bishops assertion, and then consider thereon.
First that godly Princes ought to order and set forth Gods true religion.
Secondly, that they ought to doe this with an especiall regards and care.
Thirdely, they perceyue and rightly vnderstande, that it is Gods will they shoulde so doe.
Now since that this by master Stapletons déepe silence, is agréed vpon betwixt the Bishop and him: make hereon this argument.
To order and set forth Gods true religion with especiall regarde and care is the Princes duetie.
But the only sort of gouernment that the Quéenes Maiestie doth chalenge and take vpon hi in ecclesiasticall causes, is to order and set forth Gods true Religion with an especiall regarde and care.
Ergo Prin ought to take vpon them such gouernment, as the Quéenes Maiestie doth claime and take vpon hir in ecclesiasticall causes.
And thus is the Bishops antecedent directly proued, and so consequently the principall matter of M. Feck. issue.
Nowe as the former part being the generall assertion to all the ensamples following, is no whitte impeached by any aunswere of master Stap. to it, but by silence (whiche with him is an argument of confession) graunted: so like a very Counterblaster in déed, he blusreth and puffeth at the seconde part, as though he would all to blast it.
Moses (sayth the Bishop) was supreme gouernour ouer Gods people, and was not chief priest or Bishop, for that was Aaron.
Here master Stapleton denyeth not Moses to be the supreme gouernour, but that he was not chiefe priest or Bishop he vtterly gainsayeth it.
It is an vntruth (sayth he in his score) for Moses was the chiefe priest as shall be prooued.
Here is a flat promise of proufe, but feare me it wil neuer be perfourmed, neyther doth master Stapleton here go about the perfourmance of it.
And therefore the Bishops denial of Moses to be the chiefe Priest, must stand for a truth, till by prouing Moses to be the chiefe Priest, he haue proued it to be an vntruth.
And in the meane time, his promise must stande but for a crake, as also his prowde entrante into his Chapter.
That the Scripture by the Bishop alleaged reacheth nothing home, but rather infringeth and plainely marreth the Bishoppes purpose, and fullye standeth on our syde, sayeth this student, so greatly hath arrogancie sotted him.
He fareth as did the Souldiour, who when his aduersarie had manye tymes in wrastling hurled him downe in the sighte of euerie stander by, yet woulde hée neuer confesse that hée had anye fall, yea, most arrogantlye· he styll affyrmed that hée had ast the other.
And euen so playeth this student (for this of wrastling is one of his common similitudes) he contendeth to wrastle with the Bishoppe, whiche is in verys déede as hée sayeth in this Chapter, Impar congressus Achlls Troilus.
What a number of oule falles hée hath had, yea, howe hée hath béene ouerturned in hys wne trippes, is apparaunt to euery Readers eyes, and goe no further but euen to hys last Chapter.
And yet sée howe hée craketh, that all the Byshoppes allegations, marre hys owne cause, and fully stande on hys syde.
Where contraryewyse they haue drie beaten him backe, bellie, side and all.
And as hée thus fondely maketh vaunt of his former victorie: doubt nothing (sayth he) it will fare with his examples.
Well sayd of a student, like an other Gawin, he doubteth nothing.
But sée a sodaine qualme of hys inconstancie, for euen streyght wayes, after he hath cryed out, all comes to shor: he sayth, but here am shrewedly ncombred, and in a great doubt what to doe. Whie master Stapleton, are ye now so soone in a great doubt, and right nowe as doeth bolde Bayarde doubted nothing, and haue before alreadie without any stammering thereat, clapped downe your marginall note for a full resolute aunswere, that Moyses was the chiefe Priest, and nowe doubt ye what to answere? But master Stapleton hath so many weapons that he is shrewdly encombred with them, as it were another armed Golias, and yet one smal poebble stone, will soone ease him of this encombrance.
He telles vs he hath so many aunsweres, that he doubteth with which he should beginne, for could (sayth he) make a short but a true aunswere that these ensamples are fully aunswered alreadie by master D. Harding and master Dorman.
In déede master Stapleton this were a short aunswers, but sée your selfe feare (as ye sayde before) it woulde come to short, and not reache home to the matter.
Yet, say you, if ye shoulde referre the Reader thither, to his and your great ease, it should be to the sparing, not only of penne, ynke, and paper, but of the time also, which of all thinges is most precious.
It séemeth master Stapleton ye are a man of déepe casting, these are good considerations of penne, ynke, paper and tyme.
But whie followe ye not your owne councell, whiche if ye had obserued, and left out so many impertinent vagaries, and other your trifling common places, ye had saued more paper, penne, ynke, and tyme, by thrée halues than ye haue done.
And here as séeming full resolued to follow this aduise, ye clappe downe another marginall note.
All master Hornes examples out of the olde Testament aunswered alreadie, by master Doctour Harding, and master Dorman.
Here, sayth he, is a shorte but a true aunswere.
All M. Doctor Hardings and M. Dormans answeres, confuted alreadie by the of Sarum, and M. Nowell.
Here is another as short an answere as yours M. Stap. and a great deale truer, whiche remitte to the indifferent viewers of both their answeres.
Nowe might we both rest, and breath vs, from further answering of these ensamples, and spare penue, ynke paper, and time also, that he séemeth to accompt most precious.
But another thing was more precious vnto him, and that was master Feckenhams hyre, and his friendes largesse, for so much Paper penne ynke and time spent about his booke, and the gaine of the printed copies, which the bigger volume it came vnto (for he woulde not séeme a thréehalfepennie student) the fatter exhibition it should yéelde, and he séeme the greater clerke, yea to go beyonde his masters.
And therefore there is no remedie, he will spare neyther penne ynke paper time.
nor paynes also, but that his Counterblast shall be blowne vp to so large and full a volume, that it may encounter euen the best of theirs.
To whose answeres if he shoulde referre himselfe, and saye no more thereto: Then feare me (sayth he) woulde steppe forth if not master Horne (a good simple plaine man in his dealings) yet some other ioly fine freshe pregnant wittie fellowe, yea and bring me to the streightes which way so euer did treade.
You are loath perceiue master Stapleton to be brought into the streight way to treade aright therein, for then your wrie treading woulde soone be espied.
But ye séeke crookes and shifting answeres for the nonce.
And lyke the vayne talkatiue Arrian Philosopher, ye dispise the right reuerende and learned father, calling him in contempt a good simple plaine man in hys dealings.
Whose wisedome, iudgement, learning and estimation, not onelye all godly learned that knowe him both on this side and beyonde the seas, acknowledge wyth reuerence: but euen the chiefe syre on your syde, and your good masters master Stapleton doe confesse, thoughe they groyne thereat, and be of contrarie opinion vnto him, and agrée therein with you, yet are they ashamed of this your light demeanour.
And which of them séeth not that yet it is muche better, to be a good simple plaine man in his dealings, then to be a vaineglorious, wicked, craftie, dissembling man, in his dealings, as you haue shewed your selfe throughout all your Counterblast to be? And if he be a good simple playne dealing man, are not you agayne (that durst counterblast his dealinges) a naughtie, false, and dubble dealing man? If he be a good simple plaine man in hys dealinges, than he hath dealt well simplie and plainely wyth master Feckenham, who ought to receyue the othe by his promise, if he ment also good truth· simple and playne fayth in his dealinges.
And then what ment you master Stapleton, thus to bende your studie, to spende your paper, penne, ynke, paynes and tyme, agaynst a good simple and plaine dealer? Though ye haue Balaams marke· man, and tread the way of Balaam.
Qui mercedem iniquitat is amit, That loued the rewarde of iniquitie.)
Beyng hyred for lure to wryte agaynst him: did ye thinke that dbling false woulde preuayle agaynst honest, playne and simple dealing? Or that the truth is to be dispised bycause it is playne and simple? And that your false craft woulde not be espy, except some iolie, fine, freshe, pregnaunt, wittie fellowe, woulde steppe forth and bring yee to the streightes? Ye are muche deceyued master Stapleton, in your owne concepte, and thinke your selfe a iolyer fellows than any man else takes you, that ye must néedes bée matched th some suche ie pregnaunt wittie fellowe, or else ye can not be dryun to the streightes.
But were your memorie as good as take your witte to be, ye would not forgette, that euen that Balaams Asse, whereon your Balaams mynde doth ryde, hath brought your selfe to the streyght manie tymes before thys.
And as Saint Peter sayeth of hym, Correptionem vero habuit vesani. &c. Hee was rebuked for hys iniquitie, for the dumme Asse speaking with mans voyce forbad the foolishnesse of the Prophete: so your owne tongue hath diuerse times so confounded you, that there is lesse néede than ye wene of some suche iolye fellow.
wisse a good simple plaine dealing man, will bring ye to the streightes soone ynough, howe wittie, pregnant, fresh, fine, and ioly, so euer ye estéeme your selfe.
Nowe say you: If should (as sayde) sende the Reader to them, then shoulde heare a foole, a dolt, an Asse, that can say nothing of his owne.
As though ye had not alreadie sent the Reader to them, when ye say it is a true and a short answere, and set it forth with a solemne note in the margine, as it were a marke for the nonce set vp, for the Reader to resort vnto them.
Doth your conscience giue ye therefore, that ye deserue suche homely termes as you conceyue ye shoulde heare, if ye did so? Whie did ye not then auoyde the doing so, that ye might there by aoyde those termes? But ye maye well heare in déede, (if not suche termes as your guiltie conscience fancieth you deserue) yet this, that yee can say nothing of your owne, but theyr aunsweres in effect, turquesed in your flaunting liuery wordes.
Then shoulde the cause be slaundered also (saye you) as so poore and weake, that it coulde beare no large and ample Treatise, and that their aunsweres were suche as was ashamed of them, and therefore wylilye and wiselye forbeared them, wyth manye suche other triumphant tryfling toyes.
Would ye in good sadnesse master Stapleton auoyde all triumphant tryfling toyes? Whie then stande ye tryfling in these excuses? If master Harding and master Dorman haue aunswered these ensamples alreadie, lease you any estimation (vpon the whiche ye stande so muche) béeing yet but a yong student in diuinitie to them, to referre the matter to their aunsweres? If they haue answered ho· your surplusage is but tryfling toyes.
If it be any other, then their aunsweres reached not home.
And so your answere makes your selfe a lyer, that say they haue aunswered the Bishoppe alreadie.
Againe, is your cause slaundered as poore and weake, if it haue aunswered alreadie by suche famous Rabines? Or is it the richer and stronger for the addition of your néedelesse toyes? Lastly, doth the honestie of your cause lie, in bearing a large and ample Treatise? Nowe truelye then it is a false cause, that dare not abide shorte plaine and simple dealing, but must bée flourished embossed out with a large and ample· Treatise.
And herein you haue done in déede your parte, neyther wyll speake it to flatter you (thoughe woulde not haue you waxe to prowde thereof) your aunsweres are farre beyonde all your fellowes, or maisters, or anye of your syde, for rayling, scoffing, lying, slaundering, quarrelling digressions, and other your common places, ye may eare the pricke and prise.
Yea the best of them all herein, are but benchewhilers to you, that of so poore and weake, of so false and naughtie a cause, coulde make it beare so large and ample a Treatise.
But when all is done, a good playne simple manne in hys dealing, woulde tell yée in plaine Englishe, that all these flourishe are nothing else, but tryumphaunt trysing toyes.
Againe, (say you) if shoulde repeate or inculcate their aunsweres, then woulde master Nowell or some other rushe in vpon mee, with his ruffling rhetorike that he vseth against master Dorman, and master Doctor Harding, with a precise account and calculation what eyther master Dorman master doctor Harding borowed of Hosius, or either of them two of the other, and what haue no we borowed of them both, or of eyther of them.
It were maruayle, had master Stapleton any shame, that he would for shame mention those broade borowings.
Howbeit that this is but a craftie preoccupation, borowing likewise from them, the most of his stuffe, and would not be vpbrayded therefore, nor called to account: a good simple plaine dealing man may soone espie this preuention.
Nowe that he hath cast all his doubts that encumbred him, like a circumspect man, bicause he woulde haue hys aunswere large and ample: and hath made his preoccupation, vnder the name of borowing, to steale hereafter what he will from his fellowes, knowing he might be bolde with them, who had by like borowing the sne from others: leauing the short aunswere that he chose before, hée chooseth two for more suretie, that if the one fayle him, the other may helpe at a piche.
But on the one syde (sayeth he) least anye of the good brethren, shoulde surmile vppon my silence any suche distrust· will compendiously as the matter shall require abbridge their aunsweres, and that master Horne shall thinke that our stuffe is not all spent· shall on the other syde for a surplussage, adioyne some other things to our opponent accomodate.
An Almonde for Parate, so finely our student begins to speake, that a good plaine simple man can scarce vnderstande his termes.
But this is the effect of it, we shall now haue new stuffe of some olde store, (good stuffe and God will) for all their stuffe as he crakes, is not yet spent, but perceyue it goeth harde with them in their store house, and that this stuffe is some of the last cast, God sende it be not such stale stuffe, when it comes to the view, as Cardinall Campeius moiles did bring into Englande, and vttered in Cheape side.
But such as it is we must take it in good worth, it is the best he hath to answere the Bishops ensample withall.
The first ensample is of Moses, in whome the Byshop noteth thrée things.
First that he was the supreme gouernour of Gods people.
Secondly, that hée ordred and set forth Gods true Religion, wyth great regarde and care, prescribing aswell to Aaron and the Leuites, as to the people.
Thirdly, that he was not the chiefe priest, therfore could not do them in suche respect, but as he was supreme gouernour.
The first and the seconde propositions that Moses was the supreme gouernour, and that he did order and direct all things, M. St. graunteth.
The thirde parte he denieth, and affirmeth that Moses was the chiefe priest, and in that respecte dyd all these foresayde thinges.
This assertion he sayth he will proue, bothe by his masters olde, and by his owne surplusage of newe stuffe also.
say with M. D. Harding, and S. Augustine, that Moses was a Priest aswell as a Prince, say the same with M. Dorman· with Philo Iudeus, with S. Hierome, and with S. Hieroms master, Gregorie Nazianzene: Ergo, Moses was the chiefe Priest.
By the like reason, if M. St. be a priest, he might proue him selfe to be the Pope of Rome.
He is a Romish priest: Ergo, he is the chiefe Romish priest, which is the pope.
But here he will cry out, and say do him wrong to change his conclusion, for he inferreth no such words, but these: And so consequently Moses ensample serueth not your turne, but quite ouerturneth your assertion.
True it is in déed, this is your co~clusion, M. St. but what was the bishops assertion, which this ye say, quite ouerturnes was not this his assertion, that Moses was not the chiefe priest, and did not you denie this assertion, affirme it to be an vntruth, saying, for Moses was the chiefe priest, as shal be proued? did ye not héere make promise to proue it? did ye not say, that to answere this example, ye had other freshe stuffe, not yet spent? must not then this stuffe be directed to this ende conclusion, to fulfill your promise, ouerturne the bishops assertion, which was, that Moses was not the chiefe priest, but Aaron? and you should proue as ye haue freshly promised, that Moses was the chiefe Priest.
And therfore if this be not your conclusion, ye subtilly falsly swerue fro~ the co~clusion that ye ought to haue co~cluded: ye performe not your promise to proue Moses the chiefe priest: nor your conclusion, as ye crake, ouerturnes the byshops assertion: which was that Moyses was not the chief priest, but Aaron.
And therfore either this is your argument, Moses was a Priest, Ergo, he was chiefe Priest, or else ye conclude not agaynst the bishops assertion.
If ye say ye conclude this, al the world séeth what a fonde conclusion it is.
And if ye haue a poleshorne priests crowne of your owne (as doubt not but ye haue a faire one) ye may aswell conclude to your self the Popes triple crowne.
And if ye co~clude it not, ye conclude not agaynst the bishop, nor fulfill your promise, for all your proues stande on this profe, that Moses was a priest.
Nowe the question was not whether Moses was a priest, or no, which is another question in controuersie.
But the question is, whether he or Aaron were the chiefe priest.
Yet will ye peraduenture say, though haue herein (as ye haue proued) swarued from the directe conclusion in hande, that Moses was not the chiefe priest, nor kepte my promise, yea and made a scape in saying, that ouerturned the bishops assertion, when did not, or if went about it, yet mine argument proued but a fonde reason, from priest to chiefe priest: yet in the ende haue proued Moses a priest, and so consequently it serueth not your turne (vnlesse ye will king Henry the eight, and his sonne king Edwarde, yea our gratious Queene to be a priest to) but rather quite ouerturneth your assertion: and think you M. Horne, that the Queenes authoritie doth iumpe agree with the authoritie of Moses in causes ecclesiasticall? then may she preache to the people as Moses did: then may she offer sacrifices as Moses did: then may she consecrate priests, as Moses did consecrate Aaron and others: then may it be sayde of the imposition of handes, as was sayde of Moyses, Iosua the sonne of Nun was full of the spirite of wisdome, for Moses had put his hande vpon him.
It must needes therefore followe that Moses was a priest, and that a high priest, whiche ye heere full peeuishly denie.
And thinke ye M. Horne, that the Queenes authoritie do the iumpe agree with th'authoritie of Moses? might not the byshop demaund agayne the like of you, and thinke you· M. Stap. that euen your Popes authoritie, (admitting it were not the vsurped tyrannie which it is) dothe iumpe agree with the authoritie of Moyses? yea admitting also that question, that he was a Priest, and so consequently agayne it serueth not your turne, nor master D. Hardings, nor master Dormans neither.
am sure, as ye confesse he was a priest, so ye will admit a difference betwéene your Pope and him, and euen so (since ye reason thus precisely of differences in the persons) ye ought also to haue made a difference betwéene Moyses his diuerse offices, and to haue giuen either office his proper actions, and so to haue applied them, and not to haue confounded them, admitting that he, one person, were both a Prince, and a Priest also, which hangs in controuersie for all your cited authors.
Moyses (by an especiall priuiledge) was a Prieste as well as a Prince, and thereby did preache, offer sacrifice, consecrate Aaron, lay imposition of handes, and did other offices of Priests, and many extraordinary things besides: Ergo, Moses in that he was a Prince, not a Priest, in that he exercised ordinary gouernment ouer priests and all ecclesiastical persons and causes, as other Princes did after him· is not to be broughte for example for our christian princes to follow.
And what an ilfauorde argument is this pray you? but to hide this sequele after your fashion, ye would inserre another yet more darke conclusion, saying: It must needes therfore follow, that Moses was a priest, that a high priest, which ye heere full peenishly denie.
Doth this conclusion, M. Stap. if it were admitted, improue the Byshops assertion? and yet this your conclusion standing on thrée partes, as it is not to the purpose, so is euery parte starke false, and like the maker thereof.
For Moses by his prerogatiue, hauing especiall co~maundement of God therto, might well do all those things, and yet it followeth not of any necessitie, that, as you say, he must néedes therfore haue bene a priest.
Or if he had bene a priest, he must néedes therefore be a high priest: or if he had bene a high priest, that he must néedes be the highest priest.
Neither did the byshop denie peeuishly, that he denied (as you full peeuishly, rashely, and like your selfe do iudge,) nor yet denied, or graunted, or spoke vpon, one way or other, whether Moses were priest, or a high priest, yea or no.
But denied, and that truely, that Moses was not the highest or chiefe Priest.
Which words ye durst not alleage, nor yet generally terme him the high priest, but ye say, a priest, and that a high priest, your selfe séeming euen by your spéeche, to graunt that the high priest or highest priest he was not.
Nor ye can not cauill about your owne phrase, vnlesse ye will say it is all one, a Lorde, and the Lorde, a high priest, and the high priest, so say ye ment the chiefe priest, when ye sayd, a high priest: for all the worlde séeth a great difference betwéene these termes, and that your self did subtilly sée, to make the reader beléeue ye had performed your promise in prouing him to be the chiefe priest.
And yet ye bring no profe, but onely say, a priest, and that a high priest, go, the highest priest So that if the reader more narroly viewing your grosse sleight, shoulde chalenge ye, that you haue not proued him the highest priest simply, no (will ye say to saue your honestie) onely sayde, a priest, and a high Priest, and no more.
But why do ye then belie the byshop, saying he denied that, that he medled not with, and proue not your matter in hande, nor kéepe touch with your reader in perfourming your promise, that Moses was the chiefe Priest? Haue ye learned so wel this subtill shift, that Omne promissum est aut debitum aut dubium, Euery promise is eyther due or doubtfull? But howsoeuer ye will discharge your promise, this your doutfull conclusion neither dischargeth your falshood, nor impugneth the Bishoppes assertion, muche lesse ouerturnes it, that he was not the chiefe priest, but the chiefe Prince or gouernoure, and thereby did order and direct Gods true religion, bothe to all the Priestes and people, as the Bishop affirmed.
Nowe seeing he can by no meanes, neyther olde stuffe, nor newe stuffe, bring it about as he wold haue it, nor proue him to be the highest Priest, he will leaue his promise, and lyke to the Fore that would eate no Grapes, when he could not come by them, with all the leapes he coulde make, so M. Sta. will nowe, euen renounce his solemne marginall crake, that he promised to proue Moyses the chiefe prieste, and leaping at it, but euer leaping shorte, that he was a Priest, and a little higher, that he was a highe Priest, but he can not leape so high, to obtaine his purpose, that he was the highest Priest, he will now let him goe for béeing any Priest at all, and since he can not get the grape he wil none of it, but will hunt after an other praie.
say now further with master Dorman (sayth he) that put the case Moses were no priest, yet this exa~ple frameth not so smoothly and closely to your purpose as ye weene, for Moses was a prophet, and that such a prophetas the like was not againe.
Giue me now M. Horne Princes, prophetes, giue mee Pnces and lawmakers by especiall order and appointement ordeined of God, to whose wordes God certainly wold haue giuen as great authoritie, as he would and commaunded to be giuen to Moses, and then perchaunce will saye that ye saye somewhat well to the purpose.
Againe Moyses was suche a speciall Prophete, and so singularly chosen of God to bee hearde and obeyed in all thinges, that he is in the holy Scripture euidently compared to Christe himselfe: compared, saye, in the office of teachyng and instructing.
Moyses in the Deuteronom, foretelling the Iewes of a Messias to come, sayeth: The Lorde thy God will rayse thee vp a Prophete from among thyne owne nation, and of thy brethren, suche an one as my selfe, him thou shalt heare.
And this so spoken of Moyses in the olde Lawe, is in the nevve Testament auouched and repeated, firste by S. Peter the chiefe apostle, and nexte by Saint Stephan the firste martyr, and applyed to Chryste.
If then Christe must be so heard and obeyed of vs, as was Moyses of the Ievves, no doubte as Christe is a king, a Prince, a Prophete, a Prieste, and a Bishoppe to vs: so vvas Moyses to them a Prince, a Prophete, a Priest, and a Bishoppe.
As Christe is of vs to bee hearde and obeyed as well in all matters Ecclesiasticall as temporall (for no temporall lawe can haue force agaynste the lawe of Christe among Christian men) so vvas Moyses to be hearde and obeyed of the Ievves in matters and causes as vvell temporall as spirituall.
Tanquam meipsum audietis, You shall heare that Prophete euen as my selfe.
Shevve vs Master Horne any prince in the nevve Testamente so conditioned and endevved, and then make your argumente on Gods name.
Verely any prince that novve is (namely in Ecclesiasticall gouernement) compared vvyth Moyses, is as the Poete sayth: Impar congressus Achilli Troilus.
Yea forsoothe novve yee saye somethyng further, Maister Stapleton, as ye boaste: howbeit nothyng further in substaunce than youre fellowes before, but in flourish of Copia verborum, yee saye novve further in déede, And maye saye to you, it was high tyme to saye something further: for hytherto all that ye haue sayde is nothyng.
Well saye you, nowe Put the case Moyses were no Prieste: conclude then he was not hyghe Prieste, and so putting this case, yée put youre selfe in an yll case, that before ye made a false lying crake, and nowe with shame are fayne to giue it ouer.
But if ye put the case (as ye say) like Master Dorman, then dare ye not abide, by this case neither lyke Wylliam Sommer, for so playde Master Dorman in putting this case, and so feare in the ende ye must be fayne to do.
Nay say you it frameth not so smoothely and closely to youre purpose as ye vvene.
Well Master Stapleton, it hath hitherto so framed, that ye are fayne to gyue ouer youre tackelyng, and forsake the perfourmaunce of youre promyse, and to séeke oute other shiftes of descante so that, althoughe ye woulde beare vs in hande, it frameth not so smoothelie, and closelie for the Bishoppe, as hée thinkes, yet you graunt thereby, that it frameth to his purpose.
But as for your purpose, for all youre olde or newe stuffe, it neyther frameth wyde nor close, smoothe nor roughe, but bringes it out of frame.
For what an argument call ye this? Though Moyses was no prieste, yet Moyses was a prophete so well as a Prince.
Ergo, Princes in that respect Moyses was a Prince, may not followe his princely steppes.
Was not Saule also for the while a Prophet: Num Saul inter prophetas? Was not Debora a Prophetesse, and yet a Princesse too or Iudge ouer Israel? Was not Dauid a Prophete, and is commonly called Regius propheta, the Kingly Prophete? Neuerthelesse all Christian Princes maye and oughte to folowe his princely supreme gouernement.
And yet you cry, Giue me now M. Horne princes, prophetes, giue me princes and lawemakers by especiall order and appoyntmente ordeined of GOD. Doe ye not sée howe fondly ye reason, and howe ye confute your selfe· Yée reason as thoughe there were no difference to be putte betwéene those especiall giftes and appointmentes: and the ordinarie gifte of their Princely authoritie, bycause one Prince had bothe, and that after an extraordinarie and especiall sorte, but if those commaundementes, lawes, and giftes of prophecies, were suche specialties, (as you saye) ordeined of God, then do your self seuer them from the prince ly authoritie.
And why do ye then demaund suche prerogatiues in euery Prince, whiche they had not in resp· they were Princes, but in other especiall respects? But by this your fonde rule, if bycause they had suche especiall priuileges, commaundementes, or giftes, therfore they are not to be broughte in for an example of the authoritie: then you must not alleage them, for the Priestes or bishops authoritie in Ecclesiast. causes neyther, except your Priests Bishops haue the lyke prerogatiues, and that God wold haue as great authoritie giuen to them, as he would and commanded to be giuen to Moyses.
Yea, you may hereby exclude al Princes from al ciuil gouernement too, whiche if we proued they might haue, bicause Moyses ordered and directed all the Iudiciall lawes of Gods people: may ye not replie on this fashion, and say, Giue me Princes and lawmakers by special order appointment ordeined of God? For you knowe wée can giue you none in these lawes neyther, that are equall to Moyses.
May not therfore Moyses ensample herein, be alleaged for the Princes authoritie in makyng ciuill lawes, bicause the Prince maketh them not, with suche speciall order and appointment ordeined of God as Moses did? Yes M. Stap.
Moyses authoritie may well be alleaged for al Princes authoritie, although they haue not the like gifts that Moyses, Iosue, or Dauid had.
Yea those singular ornamentes of God in them, ioyned to their princely authoritie, make so an argument to feare Princes from doing the like things, bicause they haue not the like excellent giftes: that they be rather encouragementes, to set such singular Princes gouernement (as patternes to folow) euermore before their eyes, and the better those Princes were, the better theyr ensamples be.
Where as you reason contrarywise, such a Prince was more excelle~t than princes be now, Ergo, our Princes now may not take example of him: but ye shoulde conclude, that they oughte to take example of him the rather.
And euen for these causes, such Princes are examples to all other, bicause they so excell all other.
So men set their children in writing, to the best and most cunning penman, at the least to haue them come the nearer to him, so muche as they can though they ca~not fully attain to his perfectio~, not to say, tushe he writes too fine for them, and therfore they must not take ensamples of him.
Yea, if a learned Schoolemaister were also an excellent diuine, myght not the same man be reckoned for a schoolemaister, yea rather for a paterne and ensample for other schoolemaisters to follow, bicause of his singular gift to traine the children vp in the feare knowledge of God, so well as in the rudimentes of Grammer? And will ye then debarre Moyses from being an example to other Princes, bicause he was not only a Prince, but a Prophete also, bicause he had more excellente giftes and prerogatiues than other Princes haue? But here, thynking thereby the more to abase and dashe Christian Princes oute of countenaunce, from taking example of this excellente Prince Moyses, ye mounte so highe into the prayse of him, that lyke to the Fryer which in the prayse of saincte Frauncis, extolling him aboue all the Sainctes, aboue Seraphin and Cherubyn, yea aboue Christe, coulde fynde no place in Heauen to sette him in: so where in the prayse of Moyses, ye shoulde referre him vnto Christe, ye ouershoote your selfe, and referre Christe vnto him, making Christe to be terminum quo, and Moses terminum ad quem· Moyses sayeth (saye you) The Lorde thy God will rayse thee vp a prophete, from among thyne owne nation, and of thy brethren, suche a one as my selfe, him shalte thou heare.
Ergo, Chist is so to be hearde of vs, as Moyses was of the wes. Hereuppon preposterously ye inuerte the reason backewarde, not from Moyses to Christe (of whome Moyses knowledged hym selfe but a fygure) but from Christe agayne to Moyses, as though Christe also were a fygure of him, saying: As Christe is a kyng a Prophet, a Prieste, and a Bishoppe to vs, so was Moyses to them a Prince· a Prophete, a Priest and a Bishop.
As Christe is of vs to be hearde and obeyed vvell in all matters Ecclesiasticall as temporall, so was Moyses to be hearde and obeyed of the Iewes, in matters and causes, as well temporall as spirituall.
What a manifest writhing of Scripture is this? Who playeth Cacus parte here, that drewe Hercules en by the tayles backwarde, and so stole them into his theeuish denne? Doe not you so hale this testimonie of Scripture backwarde, lyke the witche that sayde hir Pater noster backewarde, to make hir payle goe forewarde, saying, As Christe is King, Prophete, Prieste, and Bishop, so was Moyses: As Christe is to be hearde and obeyed, so was Moyses.
Where by the testimonie alleaged, ye shold rather haue reasoned forwarde, thus: As Moyses was Prince, Prophet, priest bishop to the~, so should Christ be to vs: As Moyses was hearde and obeyed of them, so shoulde Christe be of vs.
This had bene the right and orderly reason, but you sawe, that then youre wresting the Text woulde soone be espyed: And that in swaruing from the hearing and obeying of the olde lawe of Moyses, and the Gospell of Christe, to all proportions of these peons offices, would be but an homely sequele to serue your urpose, and rather abase Christe, than serue any thyng for Moyses, to make him a Priest and a Bishop.
And where you make Chryste a fygure of Moyses, to make Moyses also a Priest and a Bishoppe, bycause Chryste is so: the texte maketh a similitude from Moyses to Chryst, onely in eyther béeing a Prophete, and that the one Prophete and the other shoulde be heard and obeyed: But you turne it topsie turuie, and making Christes person represente Moyses person, conclude thereon not onely Prophete but Priest and Bishop also, which the texte citeth not, nor any other mentioneth in the scripture, that Moyses was priest and Bishop.
Nor the Priesthood of Christe was prefigured by Moyses priesthoode, (for that is a question whether Moyses were Priest at all or no,) but the Scripture expressely for Christes priesthoode, testifyeth, that Aarons Priesthoode in some respectes, but chiefly Melchisdecks, were the onely fygures thereof, and not any Priesthood of Moyses, and therefore your selfe durste not flatly conclude before that hee was the chiefe Prieste, but a highe Priest: But dare ye saye the lyke of Christe, he was a hyghe Priest, but not the chiefe or hyghest Priest of all? But when ye sawe a glimse, that this inuersed argument could not proue Moyses to be a lyke Priest to Christ nor bishoppe at al, nor that his béeing a Prophete, tooke awaye the ensample of his Princely authoritie: as ye did the residue, so ye subtilly inuerte and folde vp the conclusion.
For, where it shoulde haue falne out thus: As Christe is of vs to hee hearde and obeyed, as vvell in all matters Ecclesiasticall as temporall: so vvas Moyses to bee hearde and obeyed of the Iewes, in all matters and causes as well spirituall as temporall, whiche were the playn conclusion: yée come indreaming and saye, in matters and causes as vvell temporall as spirituall, as thoughe the uestion were moued of temporall, not of spirituall matters· neither dare ye say all, as ye did in ye former part.
But if ye replie that ye ment all, and so the proportion of your argument runneth, and that do ye wrong to charge ye, with so lighte a matter, since the indefinite, is taken for the vniuersall: maye not replie agayne, that ye doe the Bishop muche more treble wrong? that so often call and make suche outcryes for thys syllable, all, when soeuer he concludes, In matters so wel ecclesiastical as temporall, Lo say you, he leaueth out, in all matters Ecclesiast. and temporall.
Whiche althoughe it were no parte of his issue with M. Feckenham, and yet he settes it downe oftener than ye woulde haue it, though he be not in euery particular proofe bounde thereto: yet sée howe thys hitteth your selfe, that if ye leaue out this word (All) ye can make no good conclusion from Christe to Moyses at all.
Nowe when you haue thus Master Stapleton, preferred Moyses before Christe, ye crie out vnto the Bishoppe, Shewe vs Master Horne any Prince in the newe Testamente so conditioned and endued, and then make youre argument on Gods name.
Haue you made your argument on Gods name M. Stapleton? or not rather in his name that exalteth himselfe aboue all that is called God, when ye haue made the mayster serue as a fygure to the seruaunte, to serue youre purpose? But lette Moyses haue hys due estymation vnder Christe, and hys especiall prefiguryng of Chryste also, and all prerogatiues of dooyng any thyng for the tyme then, by Gods especiall appoyntmente, that Princes nowe can not doe: Yet on Gods name, maye anye man argue as the Bishoppe dyd, that Moyses care and regarde (béeyng the Prince of the Israelites) in settyng foorthe and ryghtely orderyng Gods true religion then: maye, and is, and oughte to be a paterne to all Christian Princes, to care and regarde in setting foorth and rightely ordering Gods true religion nowe.
And what though in this co~parison (although in déed be no comparison, as you call it, but an example) any christian Prince that now is, compared with Moyses, be Impar congressus Achilli Troilus, as vneuen a match as Troilus to contende with Achilles, may not therefore a christian Prince followe Moses examples? Why bring ye that Poets sentence, M. St? what Prince goeth about to co~pare contend with Moyses, and not rather submit them selues to his example heerein? Ye slaunder christian Princes, ye deface Christes glory, ye belye Moyses, ye skippe from Priest to Prophet, from Prophet to Priest agayne, to delude the bishops ensample, and yet all this will not frame, neither smoothly nor roughly to your purpose.
Whiche when ye perceiue, leauing all these shifts of descant, to infringe the authoritie of this first example, that vrgeth you so sore, that ye can not tell what to say vnto it, but are driuen to the harde wall, and that all store, olde stuffe, and new stuffe is cleane spent: then as a desperate man ye quite denie all examples, either of Moyses, or of any that hereafter shall be alleaged, and ée for sanctuarie once agayne, to the place of the Deuteronomie, mentioned in the former diuision, of the doubts arising betweene bloud and bloud, plea and plea, leprie and leprie, to be determined by the priestes Iudge.
And héere clayming sanctuarie, and remouing al examples: And the lawier sayth (say you) legibus non exemplis iudicatur, VVe muste iudge according to the precise rule of the lawe, and not by examples: extraordinary doings enforce no ordinary prescription or rule.
The ordinary rule of priests iudgements without whyes and whats, and suche other tryfling importune instances, as ye are wont to make agaynst it, by the lawe of Moyses, and by your owne chapter before alleaged in doubtfull cases, muste absolutely vpon payne of death be obeyed.
By this rule of the lawe you must measure all the examples following, of kinges and princes vnder this lae.
Ye muste square your examples to the rule, and not the rule to the examples, vnlesse ye will make of the lawe of God Lesbiam regulam, and bothe vnskilfully and vnorderly worke therwith.
And hereon as a ruled case ye set downe your marginall iudgement.
If ye will not, M. St. be iudged by examples, wherefore do ye take vpon you to defende M. Feckenham, and impugne the byshop? For one of the foure meanes whereby he desireth to haue his issue proued, and will be iudged by, is practise: which altogither ye wot, standeth of examples, and therfore the byshop proueth it by examples.
And if you will now flée from the authoritie of examples, ye should at the beginning haue striken off, one of those foure meanes to haue the issue proued by, and not first to admit them, and id the byshop go on, and say ye will yeelde also if, he proue ought by any of those foure meanes, and when he hath so proued the same, by suche examples as first with al shiftes ye labour to answere, and when ye can not answere to any purpose, will ye now at length come in crying, with an humaine lawiers shift, against the examples of Gods eternall worde, say, legibus, non exemplis, iudicatur, men muste iudge by law, and not by examples? is this your indifferent dealing, M. St? But of what opinio~ pray you, be you, that dare reiect the ensamples conteined in the holy scripture? make a difference betwéene them and rules? do ye lyken them to other worldly examples? are they not also rules, if they be examples of godly men, for vs to folow: if they be examples of wicked men, for vs to flée? Doth not S. Paule so teache vs, after he had cited many examples of the olde Testament, saying: Hc autem omma in figura illis contigebant. &c.
All these things hapned to them for ensamples, and are written to admonishe vs, vpon whome the endes of the worlde are come.
Thus maketh he rules of these examples to be ware the like.
And your selfe that héere refuse them, if this or any other ensamples should neuer so little sée me serue your turne, or may with any countenance of probabilitie be wrested to it: there by and by ye will be iudged by ensamples, and maruellous eloquently dilate them, omitting nothing that might eache forwarde your cause, yea though in steade of an example of the scripture, it be but a tale of your golden lying legende.
This is afterward in all your Popish historiographers, your common fashion, as the Reader shall perceyue.
And héere ye will not in any wise the matter to be iudged by examples of the Scripture.
For then it were to euident by many and manyfest examples, the iudgement would goe agaynst you.
The examples of Gods worde woulde soone ouerthrow you, and therfore you playnly refuse nowe at the length to be iudged by them.
But to bleare the simples eyes, ye alleage that extraordinarie doings enforce no ordinary prescription or rule.
As who say the byshop alleaged suche doings of Mases as were extraordinary, and not rather suche his doings, as other godly princes did besides him the like, it is your selfe, M. St. that recken vp his prophecies, his making speciall lawes appoynted of God, and other his extraordinary gifts doings: and not the bishop.
And therfore this is but one of your ordinary shiftes, vnder the pretence of extraordinarie doings, to denie flatly in the end al exa~ples brought against you, and say, men must not iudge by examples.
But wherby wil ye be iudged then? by the rule, say you, of the chapter going before, that the Priests the iudges iudgement, in doubtful cases, without whies and whats, must absolutely be obeyed vpon payne of death.
By this rule of the lawe, you muste measure all the examples following, of Kinges and Princes vnder this lawe.
If this be your rule, M. Stap. this is ruled ouer alreadie.
Which besides that it hath shewed many of your impudent falshods, in belying and wresting the place, so it be wrayeth also your extreme folly, ignorance, maliciousnesse, and arrogancie, besides the weakenesse, yea and desperation of your whole cause, to flée from examples, and depende on this sentence.
First, this rule was but the Iudiciall lawe of the Iewes, and so it toucheth not vs. Secondly, the cases mentioned in this rule, were not matters of religion, but ciuill cases of strife betwéene neighbour and neighbour, and therfore the rule of that lawe was no absolute rule in all cases to them, or is any rule at all in any case to vs, and is bothe to them and vs, manyfestly wrested of you, to all cases of religion: and therefore in this controuersie, of all spirituall or ecclesiasticall matters, is alleaged out of place and season.
Thirdly, the doing herein appertayned not to the Priests alone, but the sitting and determination of the truthe of the doubt to them, and the ratifying decrée to the Iudge or Prince.
Fourthly, it was not absolutely done, without whies and whats, as you pretende, but that, euen by your owne popishe doctours mindes, men might not onely haue asked why and what, but vtterly haue refused it, had it bene, not according to the lawe.
But to beare men in hande, as the Papistes would, that the Crowe is white, and we muste not say the contrarie, bicause (as the Pharisies saide, we haue a lawe, and by that lawe he ought to dye) so sayth M. Stap. we haue a rule, and by this rule ye muste obey the Priestes sentence in all doubtes whatsoeuer he sayth without any whies and whats therto.
And whatsoeuer examples ye haue to alleage, they must all be measured and squared by our rule, otherwise ye worke vnskilfully and vnorderly, making of the lawe of God Lesbiam regulam, a rule to bowe euery way that ye would haue it.
But who are those that make of the lawe of God Lesbiam regulam, to runne on foure whéeles to euery tropologicall, anagogicall, mysticall, and morall sense, that ye liste to applie it: who it is that by this rule, would make the manifest words of Moses Lesbiam regulam, applying them backewarde and forwarde as he liste, and wresteth Christ to Moyses, and would rule Christ vnder Moyses ruler: who it is that would bring all examples to one rule, and so make his owne rule Lesbiam regulam also: who they be that call the scripture not onely Lesbiam regulam, but besides giue it other foule and shamefull tearmes: trust master Stapleton you are not ignorant.
But euer ye were best to obiect that to vs, wherein ye are culpable most your selfe, for thus it becommeth an impudent man in a desperate cause to do.
And so yelustily knit vp the matter, that This one answere might well serue for all the kings doings now following, sauing that will (say you) particulerly descende to euery one, and so for euery one say somewhat.
What somewhat ye will say to other ensamples, we shall then sée somewhat as ye descende vnto them, and somwhat may we sée alreadie by this, whereby ye count ye haue answered all to come.
The somewhat and summe of this great answere is this: canceled rule, perteyning nothing to Christian men to follow, nor being euer of any spirituall matters, but indiciall and ciuill cases, for the time being, wherein the Prince had as much to doe, or more than the Priests, is a fitte rule and absolute, in all ecclesiasticall and religion cases, to rule ouer all Christian Kings, Quéenes, and Princes, vppon paine of death to be ruled by popishe priestes: but an expresse ensample of a most godly Prince, to set forth, order and direct Gods true religion, with great regarde and care, is no fitte ensample for Christian Princes to follow.
And the reason is, bicause, that Prince had, besides that he was a Prince, some especiall prerogatiues, and other excellent giftes of God.
Here is the full effect of your whole answere, which how effectuall it is to infringe the Bishops assertion, let all the worlde be indge.
And yet ye so triumphe hereon, that as it were some instie freshe Champion, hauing beaten all downe before him, ye crie out for another aduersarie.
Ye are all heart to the hard héeles sée M. St. and were it not herein that ye resemble the wise captayne, that in the beginning you mentioned out of Luke.
woulde haue sayde this chalenge had procéeded of a noble and hawte orage, but bicause it wanteth that naturall wisdoe and foresight, so rashly to runne vpon one aduersarie, hauing more than bothe your handfuls with him, yet more fondly to chalenge another on your toppe, your case beein so badde, and your selfe so weake and vnskilfull a souldiour withall: all wise men will iudge it in you neither pollicie nor manhoode, but that in your foole hardie presumption ye play but the desperate Dicke, if not a Thom of Ldlem.
NExt to Moses the Bishop adioyneth the ensample of Iosue, prouing by diuers testimonies and doings of Iosue, that the supreme gouernement in all ecclesiasi also well as temporall causes, was committed to him, ot to Eleazar the high priest, who onely had the ministration of things belonging to the priestly office.
M. Stap. in al the residue of the examples, auing before promised to be as briefe as he may: yet to amplifie his answere, least it should be too briefe, or his counterbast too small, in the beginning, and so throughout his answers, picketh bye quarels at the Apologie, at master Nowell, at the Conuocation, and other thinges not to the present purpose, but for any materiall or directe answere to any of Iosues doinges, he vseth nothing but méere shiftes, or very childishe arguments.
M. D. Harding (sayth he) sheweth that allegation to importe no chiefe rule in spirituall matters as in deede it doth not.
As though the whole matter (M Stap.) muste be determined by hat so euer your M. D. Harding hath sayde, and you with it is learned proofe, in deede it dothe not haue confirmed your masters saying.
Now as though this were, betwéene his allegation and your co~firmation, a sufficient and ful prooe, ye set downe theron your marginall note, as a cleare case, Iosue no supreme gouernour in all ecclesiasticall causes.
What kinde of arguing call ye this, M. Stapl? but sée howe soone at the first ye confounde your selfe, and that Iosue had the gouernement in eccleuasticall matters.
For where ye picke by quarels, already answered, agaynst the Apologie and master Nowell, about this phrase to goe foorth and come in, and will not haue it vnderstoode onely of going and comming to and fro the warres, as M. Nowell hath fully proued it dothe, as also Ruvi and Aben zra, do expounde it, and Lyra expresseth the meaning of the phrase, do a quod no si ad labores sed prius, so that he be not the last but the first to labour.
But say yau, Immediatly before it is generally vvritten, prohoc si quid agendum crit, Eleazar sacerdos consulet dominum.
For him (meaning Iosue) Eleazar aske counsell of God when any thing is to be done.
In which words we see euidenty, that Iosue whatsoeuer he did touching the gouerning of the people in ecclesiasticall matters, he did nothing of him selfe, but was in all suche matters instructed of Eleazarus the high Priest.
Doe ye not see withal euidently, master Stapleton, that admitting this to be vnderstood so generally as you prete~d, howe your selfe doe piaynly graunte, that the gouernement in ecclesiasticall matters appertayned to Iosue, in saying: VVhat soeuer he did touching the gouerning of the people in ecclesiasticall matters: and what now will ye make Iosue? a Priest? no say you, but in all such thinges he was instructed of Eleazarus the highe Priest.
VVhose parte therfore it was alwayes to aske counsell of God, when Iosu had anything to doe.
Why, what then M. Stap. the question is not asked heere of asking counsell, who asked it of God, or whether Iosue asked it of Eleazar, but by whose gouernment it was done.
We graunt the Princes shoulde aske counsell in all ecclesiasticall matters of their godlye learned clergie, and they shoulde aske it of God, that is to say, of his holy worde, wherein he hath reuealed his will.
But what letteth this asking counsell, the ordering, doing, setting forth, and gouerning of those ecclesiasticall matters, to be in the Prince? What hindreth this, that the Prince ought to aske counsell also in euery weightie ciuill affayre, the chiefe gouernment thereof to be in the Prince? Though he follow in all points, the aduice of his counsellers, yet haue not they the chiefe authoritie? This exception therefore of asking counsell, taketh not away your graunt, that Iosue had the doing of those things that touched the gouerning of the people in ecclesiasticall matters.
And so is this a fit ensample, euen by your owne flatconfession.
And with all ye haue graunted the full issue, that godly Princes haue and may take vpon them such gouernment in ecclesiasticall causes, as the Q. maiestie now doth.
Here if ye would flée touch, and say ye graunt Iosue had the gouernement in causes ecclesiasticall, but not the supreme gouernment: although this be but a shifting toy, so long as he did not those things by any others gouernance, (and yet is it much more than your fellowes, or your selfe otherwhiles will confesse, that he was any gouernour at all in ecclesiasticall matters: so contrarie ye are to your fellowes and your selfe) yet what can ye shew, why, as ye grau~t Iosue to be gouernour: so he should not be supreme gouernour also, but be subiect to another? If ye stand on this argument: Iosue must in all things aske counsell of the Priest: Ergo, Iosue in all things is subiect to the Priestes iudgement: By this argument you will make the kinges counsell to be the kings supreme gouernours to.
But they for all theyr good counsell giuen to the king, be he neuer so much bund to take it, are but his subiectes still therein, and he their soueraigne Lord, for by him when al their cou~sell is done, the thing must be set forth, established through his authoritie.
As therfore you haue grau~ted, Iosue had ye gouerning of the people in ecclesiastical matters: so this exceptio~ doth nothing embarre his supreme gouernment therein, but rather establish it, that in all his doings were they neuer so generall, the priest was but the counsellour, first learning of God, and then instructing his Prince: but the gouerning and setting forth thereof belonged vnto Iosue.
And to reason on the contrarie, from asking or giuing counsel and instruction, to a chiefe authoritie: or from following good counsell, to obedience and subiection: is but an homely argument, and fitte for suche a counsellour as your selfe are M. Stap.
But when ye sée this weakenesse of your argument, by and by you start backe againe from all that you haue sayd.
And as before ye forsooke the ensamples from Moyses, and referred them to your foresayde wrested rule, so woulde ye nowe also deale with Iosue, that if the Priestes counselling would not inferre his authoritie, yet his iudgement should as ye thought enforce it.
The Priest and the Iudge must discusse all doubtes of bloud, strife, cleane, and vncleane.
Ergo all the testimonies of the holy scripture brought forth by master Nowell, and before him by master Horne, can not induce supremacie in causes ecclesiasticall, but the execution of the high Priestes or lawes commaundement.
This friuolous argument, grounded on this impertinent and weake ankerholde, which master Stapleton maketh his generall rule and succour, whensoeuer he is driuen to a plunge, then backe againe to this, as a foxe to his earth: is so fully aunswered and confuted, that it were but superfluous to stande any longer about it.
And here (sayth master Stapleton) will not quarrell with master Nowell. &c.
Under pretence that he will not, he beginnes to picke by quarrelles with him.
The quarels are, a couple of miquotings of figures for
For vsing such examples as the Bishop of Winchester doth.
For detecting M. Dormans sealth, the noting wherof, he calleth childish and boyish rhetoike, for feare in deede that his owne childishe and boyish rhetorike (stealing so many sentences, arguments, and in maner whole leaues, from Doctor Harding and master Dorman, as master Dorman stale from Hosius maler Harding) shoulde be also detected as master Dormans is, and therefore he flourisheth it out with his common places, but the stuffe is the olde stffe still, though newe furbished for rusting to seeme the fresher to the shewe.
After he hath done with M. Nowell he returneth to Iosue, and least he should seeme to haue answered no particuler point, he choseth out one of Iosue his doings in the place of all the rest alleged, not so much to make any answere at all to the obiection thereof, as thereby to picke yet another by quarrell, and so to shake of the matter, as though he had made a clerkly answere thereto.
The Bishop shewed how at the appoyntment of Iosue, the priestes the arke of Couenant, and placed the same: so goeth on through many perticuler actions, that declae Iosues supreme gouernment ordring of ecclesi matters.
To this when M. St should directly answere, whether this declare an authoritie of the Prince, euer the priestes in ecclesiasticall matters yea or no, in seed of answere he sayth.
But for the doyng of Ioue, will further note, that then the Priestes tooke vp the arke of couenant, and went before the people.
But pray you master Horne, how was this obserued of lae yeares, when the lay men durst aduenture to take the guiding of the arke, and go before the Priestes, and not suffer the priests to go before them? And durst alter the state of Christian religion, agaynst the will and minde of he B. the whole clergie then at their conuocation asembled? And pray you againe master Stapleton.
What doth this answere the Bishops proposition? shewth your shifting, it detecteth your malice, that witingly slaunder your most gracous price, natiue countrey.
Hir Maiestie hath onely done therein, euen after the example of this moste Godly price Iosue.
In co~maunding the arke, that is is to say gods holye worde, in the syncere setting forth of it, by the godly ministers thereof, to be caried before hir, hir subiects.
And when your popish prlates priests (which in deed are neyther preates nor prieus) refused to cary it, otherwise tha~ after your on devises to cart it, ot after Gods or rather would not cary it about at al, but bury it vnder a bushel, in therof cary about mamets toyes, to mke peopl commit most barbarous idolatrie: hir high sse as hath abolished iuch caryage: and as did Salo out of office your aud clergie, and placed other painful in their ooues, to cary this erke as goo hath appointed it, before hir highnes all hir people.
Now when ye haue thus the prince, the clergie, the whole realme, and yet answered not one worde to the obiection: VVell (say you) et tts pale for this present, say no for Iosue his doing, sauing that otherwise they are not to be drawne into an ordinarie rule for that the spirite of God was certainly in him, and for that hee had part of Moses glorie, and the people commaunded to heare him, and those things that he did (wherof M. Nowell M. Horne would inferre a soueraigntie in causes spiritual) he did them by the expresse commaundement of God.
And from such princes to all princes indifferently, to gather the like preheminence in all poynts were no sure and found gathering and collection.
Your argument is this: those Princes in whom the spirit of God certainly is, and haue part of Moses glorie, and whom th· people are co~maunded to heare, and whose doings are by Gods expresse co~mandement, are not ensamples for all godly Princes to follow in their gouernments.
But such another was Iosue: Ergo it were no sound gathering collection, to set Iosue for ensample, for other Princes to follow.
For that which ye inferre (of like preheminence in al points to Iosue) both maketh your argument vicious, hauing more in the conclusion than is in any of the propositions: neyther doth the Bishop or any other contende for like prehemmence in all point, as Iosue had, but inferre of his ensample a like charge of their dueties, a like care and regard of gouerning Gods people, to be required of the~, being princes rulers as Iosue was.
But where lerned you this wicked false principle, wheron ye ground your argumnet? that the doings of any, are not to be set for examples for other Princes to follow, that had certainly the spirite of God in them, or that had a part of Moses glorie, or the people were commaunded to heare them, or bicause they did their doings by the expresse commaundement of God, are they not a great deale the more to be set for ensamples to follow? Would ye haue them follow such as certainly had the spirite of errour in them, suche lying Papistes as your selues? Woulde ye haue them follow your expresse commaundements, and then they were to be followed, but not if they followed the commaundements of God? Are those Princes not to be followed whome God commaundeth the people to heare: And are they to be followed whom you commaund the people to heare? If they be godly Princes, God commaundeth all people both to heare them, and obey them, chiefly where they haue for warrant the expresse commaundement of God.
So that by your wicked principle no good nor godly princes ought to be drawne into example, for any other Princes to follow, but naughtie and wicked Princes, such as had so little any part or sparke of Moses glorie, that they had not the spirit of God in them, or at the least it is vncertaine whose spirite they had, such as the people were not commaunded to heare them, suche as had not Gods expresse commaundement for their doinges, these are fitte examples with you for Princes to followe.
Thus do ye shew how ye haue heretofore, yet still would abuse Princes, making them so drunken with that cuppe of abhominations of the whore of Babilon, that they might take ensample of no good nor godly Prince.
But let vs sée howe substantially ye proue your maior.
You reason by admitting the contrary thereto, ab absurdo, from a foule inconuenience that we should fall into, by taking such Princes for example: or else fall into a oule contradiction agaynst our selues.
Else if ye will haue your examples (say you) to proue and confirme, then as Iosue circumcided, so let the Prince baptise, and as Iosue sacrificed vpon an altare, so let the Prince in Cope Surplesse celebrate your holy co~munion: But these two things as peculier offices of Bishops and Priests.
Nowell excludeth flatly all Princes from, yea and sayth they ought to be vntouched of Prince or other person.
Ergo, thus agayne, either ye iumble and iarre one from another, or else your argument (to bring Iosue for example to proue and confirme) falleth downe righte, choose whiche of bothe ye will.
Héere is, as M. Stap. thinketh, a marueilous Dilemma, and yet the absurditie therof moste easily anoyded, and the contradiction as playnly turned vpon him selfe.
To the maior answere, that as the one did these things, so dothe the other, and therfore the one is a fit example of the other.
As Iosue then did circumcise, so the Prince nowe baptiseth.
As Iosue did then sacrifice on an altare, so the Prince doth now celebrate, not ours (as he scornefully termes it) but the Lordes holy communion.
Neither of them, by executing them selues the fact, but by commaunding, appoynting, and ouerséeing the facte to be rightly executed by the ministers, to whom the doing apperteineth.
And that this was Iosue his doing, and not otherwise: Lyra vpon these wordes, Et primum quidem benedixit populo, doth witnesse, And first of all he blessed the people, &c. Non est intelligendu~ quòd Iosue proprie loquendo benedixit populum, quòd hoc pertinet ad sacerdotum officium, sed imprecatus est bona populo, tanquàm princeps populi, post immolatione~, praedicta~ quam similiter fecit non per se, sed per sacerdotes.
VVee must not vnderstand (these words he blessed the people) that Iosue in speaking him selfe did blesse them, for this apperteyned to the Priestes office.
But Iosue as the Prince of the people wished well vnto them, after the offring afore sayde, whiche likewyse he did not by himselfe, but by the Priestes.
Then afterwarde he reade all the wordes of the lawe, the blessinges and cursings according to all that is written in the booke of the law, there was not a worde that Moses had commaunded, whiche Iosue read not, before all the congregation of Israell, as well before the women and the children, as the straunger. &c. Non per se sed per sacerdotes vt praedictum est, coram omni multitudinem Israel.
Not by him selfe, but by the priestes, as is before sayde, afore all the multitude of Israell.
And euen as he thus read and blessed by his commaundement, and their ministerie: so saith Lyra, fecit immolationem similiter, he did offer sacrifice in like sort, not by him selfe, but by commaunding the minister to do it.
And do ye thinke that he circumcised all the whole people of Israell with his owne handes, because the wordes are, circuncidit filios Israel? Do ye thinke bicause the bare wordes are, Igitur Iosue de nocte consurgens mouit castra, that he remooued all their tents with his owne handes? and of the stones in Iordan, alios quoque duodcim lapides posuit in medio Iordanis alueo, that he set them in the riuer with his owne fingers Do ye thinke of the Citie and the King of Hai, succendit vrbem fecit eam tumulum sempiternum, regem quo{que} eius suspendit in patibulo, he burnt the Citie, and hee made it an heape for euer, and the King thereof he hanged on a gallowes, and of the other Kinges Iosue smote them, and slewe them, and hanged them on fiue trees: all these thinges and a number of such other, as well seruile as other deedes, as well temporall as ecclesiasticall, thinke you, bycause still all runneth vnder his name and his doing, that he did them hym selfe? Or rather gather thereon, that syth he did not these things himselfe, and yet so well in ecclesiasticall as other matters, all beareth the name alone of him, it importeth his supreme gouerment and direction of them.
So little is there any absurditie, in the comparison of these doings, but your owne absurde mistaking and reasoning so absurdly on them, not distinguishing betwene the doing of these things and the maner of doing them.
To the minor likewise answere, there is no contradiction, iumbling, or iarring, betwene the Bishop and master Nowell therein.
For of the same minde that the one is, is the other also, as the Bishop hath declared many times in his answere, euer obseruing this destinction betwéene the doing of the fact, and the ouersight in appoynting the fact to be done.
But this, of a peuish selfe will, ye will not vnderstande.
And so here bicause the wordes are simplie spoken that Iosue did such things, ye vnderstande it that personally he executed the doing of them.
But what now if you doe contrarie your owne selfe, and talking after of this same partie, confesse that the doing of these and such like things· must be vnderstoode by this sayde maner of anothers ministerie? May ye not then most worthely here your owne wordes returned on your selfe, that your argument falleth downe right (if euer it stoode vpright) your selfe, in playne spéeche hurling it downe? and that eyther here or there yée speake agaynst your owne conscience, your owne sayings iumbling and iarring one from another, and so ye encurre eyther the absurditie or the contradiction, choose which of both you will.
The next ensample of the Byshop is of Dauid, how God appoynted him king, not onely for the people to liue in ciul peace and honesie, but chiefly that by Dauids gouernment, care and zeale therein, they mighte be fos red vp in Gods true religion, decayed among them by the negligent reigne of king Saule.
This the Eyshop proued by king Dauids Actes, in ordering, disposing, reforming the priests and Leuites in their offices and functions ecclesiasticall, in appoynting howe the Arke shoulde be borne.
For sacrifising, and blessing, for ordeining Psalmes, singers, instruments, officers, and all other things, for the setting foorthe of the diuine seruice, and Gods true religion.
Whiche argueth that he was their supreme gouernour in all ecclesiasticall causes.
Master Stap. first for a briefe summarie answere to these doings of Dauid, clappeth downe this marginal note: Dauid in all these matters determined no doctrine, nor altered any religion agaynst the Priestes willes of his owne supreme authoritie.
This note is bothe malicious and slaunderous, as though we ascribed to the Quéenes Maiestie, or she tooke vpon hir such authoritie, and that of hir owne sway and wil, against all hir Clergies minde and counsell, to determine and alter what religion pleaseth or displeaseth hir.
This is the Popes clayme and tyrannie, and not oure Princes, or any other godly Princes dooing.
And yet this note is partly false, for king Dauid agaynst the will of hys idle Priestes, caused the misordering of the Arke to be reformed.
And did many other thinges about Religion, to the which the Priests obeyed.
And determined doctrine also, euen by master Stapl. owne confession in this Chapter.
The first argument that master Stapl. maketh is this: Bothe M. Dorman, and M. D. Harding affyrme that the proceedings of king Dauid are nothing preiudiciall to the ecclesiasticall authoritie in redressing of disorders before committed, or doing suche thinges as are heere rehearsed: Ergo, They inferre no supreme gouernment ouer causes ecclesiasticall.
This argument standeth altogither vpon the authoritie of his good masters.
M. Dorman, and M. D. Harding, from whome he boroweth his stuffe.
For, the moste of his owne surplusage, is but his common places of descant on them.
And as they be so great in his bookes, so he reasoneth as Pythagoras schollers had wont to reason of their master, [undefined span alphabet], he sayde so: Ergo, it is so: and thus argueth M. Stap.
Bothe M. Dorman, and M. D. Harding affirme it: Ergo, it is true.
But what do they affirme? That the proceedings of king Dauid in redressing disorders before committed, or doing suche things as heere are rehearsed, are nothing preiudiciall to the ecclesiasticall authoritie.
Why M. Stap. who sayth against them, or you herein? king Dauids procéedings in deede, were nothing preiudicial to the ecclesiasticall authoritie of persons ecclesiasticall, they executed all their functions still belonging to their authoritie.
And bicause his procéedings in redressing suche disorders, and all other things that he did, declare moste plainly his supreme gouernement, in setting foorthe and directing Gods true religion, and yet were no preiudice to the Priests ecclesiasticall authoritie: it followeth ther vpon that the supreme gouernment, in setting foorth Gods true religion, in correcting, repressing ecclesiastical disorders, in reducing and directing good orders, and al other doings here rehearsed, that ye confesse king Dauid did, are no parte of the Priestes ecclesiasticall authoritie, for then in doing them, he should haue done things preiudicial therevnto, and therfore they are no parts therof, but of king Dauids royal authoritie.
And this while fondly ye woulde as it were, ouerpresse vs, with suche great mens authoritie as is M. Dorman, M. D. Harding: or euer ye be aware ye make them flatly giue verdite agaynst you, with vs.
Gods name bring their authoritie so agaynst vs as oft as ye wil, neither M. Dorman nor M. D. Harding will giue ye great thanks therfore.
But for all this ye will bring vs more of D. Hardings stuffe.
As master D. Harding (say you) noteth, king Dauids proceedings in redressing disorders before committed or doing suche things as are heere rehearsed, do no more employ a supremacie in him, then the reformation of religion made by Queene Mary.
But that, ye wot well, employeth in hir no suche supremacie.
This argument sta~deth wholly vpo~ his M. D. Hardings authoritie alone, bicause he hath noted that the one dyd no more than the other, that their doings were alike héerein: But the doings of the one inferre no supremacie, Ergo, the others neither.
But if we might be so bolde as to denie this your maior, or rather your maxima or principle that ye build vpon of D. Hardings comparison, in making king Dauids doings to be none other, but such as were Quéene Maries: Where were then your argument, M. St? ye talked righte now of Impar congressus Achilli Troilus, the match betwene Troilus Achilles was vneue~, but here is a gret deale more inferiour match betwéene K. Dauid Q. Mary.
Yea their doings were so little alike, that they were cleane contrarie.
For, although she were a princesse of famous memorie, yet herein your popish Prelates made hir so beléeue them, that she durst not redresse disorders in the Clergie at al, but suffred the Pope and his prelates to reduce their false religion.
Nor she retayned the estate that belonged to hir of supreme gouernment, but vtterly renounced it.
And therfore that reformation, or rather deformation, was not made at all by hir, nor in hir name, but by the Pope and his Popelings, she only permitting it· But if ye meane as ye speake, that it was made by hi in dde, as your Massers words are, Queene Mary did it, by the meanes of the Priest so that she was the doer, and they were but the manes, she was the maker, and they but hir instruments: then your similitude goeth agaynst you, and proueth a supremacie in hir, as was in Dauid.
But ye speake colorably to make in suche a some proportion in speeche of a similitude.
For in very déede, what soeuer ye say, the matter went so, that your popishe byshops and priestes were the doers of all.
And she good Lady, was but your instrument and meane, whereby ye killed Christ in his members as did the high priestes kill Christ in his body, vnder Pontius Pilate.
speake not to compare hir, béeing hir selfe a noble Christian Prince, to him, béeing a heathen tyrant: but to shewe how you abused hi authoritie, as the Iewes did his.
But as for king Dauid, as he did those things, in redressing disorders, and all other noted by the Bishop (whiche your selfe can not denie) so he was the principall in the dooing of them, and he reformed euen the Priestes them selues.
And thoughe in some thinges he vsed the Priestes as meanes, yet what dothe this infringe his supreme authoritie, and not rather proue it? And thus your other argument from D. Hardinges authoritie, by D. Hardinges owne confession, that they were but the meanes, and king Dauid, and Quéene Mary the doers of suche ecclesiasticall matters, once agayne maketh quite agaynst you, and your master D. Harding also, and establisheth the Princes supreme gouernement ouer the priests and all.
areade ye beware, since ye stande so muche vpon your masters woordes héerein, that if ye alleage hys authoritie any more, ye bryng hym foorthe to better, purpose, or else whyle yee thynke by clawyng hym thus, to wynne hys good fauour, yee gette hys heauy displeasure, and that he answere ye flatly, non hercule veniam tertio, he will not come at your cal. Howbeit ye will once agayne in hope of better lucke bring him foorth, and alleage his authoritie better than ye haue done hitherto.
Besides that (say you) it is to be considered, as M. D. Harding toucheth, that he passed other Princes herein, bicause he had the gifte of prophecie.
So that neither those thinges that the Apologie sheweth of Dauid, or those that ye and master Nowell adde therevnto for the fortification of the sayde superioritie, can by any meanes induce it.
This friuolous argument, he was a Prophet also aswell as a Prince, Ergo, his superioritie in that he was a Prince, can not be alleaged for other Princes to followe: ye vsed before, as your owne freshe stuffe, to shifte off Moses ensample: but as it nothing helped your cause then, no more dothe it nowe.
Onely it detecteth héere, your vayne crake there, of vnspent stuffe, where in déede it was olde rotten stuffe, spent before by D. Harding on king Dauid, as héere your selfe co~fesse: yet there ye brought it as a notable fresh surplusage, beyonde all that had bene sayde.
But as you thus of D. Hardings olde scroppes héere, would haue made vs there newe fresh stuffe of your owne, wherby the alleaging of him agayne this third time openeth your shame: so yet once agayne ye make your M. D. Harding, and your selfe for companie, confounde your owne tales, and speake contrarie to your selues.
Right now ye sayde, and alleaged your masters authoritie for it, that king Dauids doings were no more than Queene Maries doings, to employ a supremacie.
Nowe ye say agayne, and like wise alleage your master for it, that king Dauid passed other princes heerein, bicause he had the gifte of prophecie.
If he passed other princes héerein, then he passed Quéene Mary, whome many other Princes haue also héerein passed: and so his doings were more than were Quéene Maries doings héerein.
For who knowe not that she was no Prophete? and thus the oftner ye alleage your master, ye take your master tardie in one lie or another and make him still contrarie both himselfe and his cause also.
Againe, it King Dauid were a Prophete, as graunt he was: a Prophete, ye wote, might and did determine doctrine, but your selfe sayde before, Dauid in all his doings determined no doctrine, and thus ye lie on your owne head, and make your master witnesse thereto.
Well, leaue at the length to cite your masters authorities for shame master Stapleton, since ye can bring them out no handsomer, or howe well so euer ye haue brought them out to your aduantage, since they be no better proues than that: He affirmeth, he noteth, he toucheth: as though all were gospell that master Doctor Harding affirmeth, noteth or toucheth.
Are ye so fond to thinke any man would yéelde so soone vnto them, vnlesse he were as wise as your selfe? But since none of all these reasons will serue, we shall now haue other stuffe of your owne, though not very fresh, but such stale refuse, as your masters haue refused, but to you all is fishe that commes to nette, ye do wisely to let go nothing, that maye any waye be wrested to helpe so yll a cause.
And first ye reason from the authoritie of the scripture.
In déede this is a better way than to reason from D. Hardings authoritie.
The Scripture (say you) in the sayde place by you and master Nowell alleaged, sayth that Dauid did worke iuxta omnia quae scripta sunt in lege domin, according to all things written in the lawe of God.
What conclusion can ye inferre hereon agaynst the Bishops allegation of Dauid? Ergo he had not an especiall care and regard in ordring and setting forth Gods true religion? if ye make the quite contrarie conclusion: He did worke according to all things written in the lawe of God: Ergo, as the B. sayth he had an especiall care and regard in ordring directing Gods true religion: then should ye make a most true conclusion, where otherwise rightly applied it can no ways serue your turn.
Thus bring ye out that, which once again ouerturnes your cause, and proues K. Dauids supreme gouernme~t.
And euen so the Q. Maiestie by this ensample of K. Dauid, is taught to do the like, as praysed be to god for hir therfore, she foloweth wel herein the steps of K. Dauid: doing, iuxta omnia quae scripta su~t in lege domini, according to all things written in gods law.
And where the papists in al their errors, this amo~g other of ye supremacie, do praeter co~tra omnia quae scripta sunt in lege domini, besides against all things writte~ in gods law: As Dauid redressed eccl. disorders crept in before his time, so ye Q. highnes now hath redressed such disorders, as she fou~d before hir time crept in.
Thus the more ye reason, ye more stil ye make against your selfe.
Ye had néed adde some better stuffe tha~ this, or els if ye thus hold on, your friends wold wish M. Fec. had hired ye to hold your peace, when he first moued you to plead for him.
Stap. séeing it now more than high time to adde some notable thing to better his cause: VVherevnto adde (sayth he) a notable saying of the scripture in the sayd booke by you alleaged concerning Dauids doings by you brought foorth touching the Priestes and Leuits.
Vt ingrediantur domum dei iuxta ritum suum sub manu Aaron patris corum sicut prceperat dominus deus Israel.
King Dauids appoyntment was, that the Leuits, and Priestes should enter into the house of God, there to serue vnder the gouernment: of whome, pray you? not of King Dauid, but vnder the spirituall gouernment of their spirituall father Aaron and his successours.
Upon this notable sentence for your purpose, as ye thinke, you gather thrée notes.
And bicause ye would go orderly, ye begin first with the last note.
VVhere we haue to note first (say you) that Dauid appoynted hereto the Leuits nothing of himself: But sicut praeceperat dominus deus Israel: as the Lorde God of Israel had before appoynted.
VVe haue here againe to note first in you M. Stap. no plaine dealing, that begin with the last part of the sentence first.
And wherefore pray you? but that, that which is spoken here of this matter in especiall, ye woulde make it séeme to serue for all Dauids doings in generall.
VVe haue to note againe, your hacking and wresting of this sentence, which sheweth a playne destination betweene theyr turnes of comming in, and their ordinarie ministerie in theyr turnes, in attending on the highe Priest.
The text is thus: ae vices eorum secundum ministeria sua vt ingrediantur domum domini, iuxta ritum suum sub manu Aaron patris eorum, sicut praeceperat dominus deus Israel.
These are theyr courses after their ministeries to enter into the house of the Lorde, and according to theyr manner be vnder the hande of Aaron their father, as the Lorde God of Israel hath commaunded.
Which last wordes ye beginne withall, and ioyne them to the first parte, as thoughe the Lordes commaundement had béene of Dauids appoyntment where it was onely of the obedience of all the Tribe of Leuie, to be vnder Aaron and his successors in the ministerie, which in deede was Gods statte commaundement.
But the appoynting of the courses to those mencioned in that place, was Dauids commaundement, euen as your selfe doe say it was King Dauids appoyntment.
And the Chapter before of the lyke argument playnlye sayeth.
And according to the last commaundements of Dauid, the Leuites were numbered from twentie yeare and vpwarde, to wayte vnder the hande of the sonnes of Aaron in the seruice of the house of the Lorde.
But admit that these wordes Sicut praeceperat, &c. as god had commaunded, be to be ment as you pretend of a speciall co~maundement to Dauid, so to dispose those courses: as ye expound it, he did nothing without gods co~maundement.
Is this again pray you? any argume~t to improue his supreme authority next vnder god, bicause he did al things sicut praeceperat dominus, as the lord had co~maundéd? then by this same rule yourpriest should not haue the supremacie neither, for am sure he had no further priuiledge, to do against, or beyond Gods co~maundement, no more than Dauid had.
It is your Pope that thus stretcheth his claime to do beyonde all Gods forvoade, and contrarie to Gods commaundement, but little or nothing sicut praeceperat dominus deu Israel, as the Lord God of Israel hath co~maunded.
As for the Quéenes Maiestie hath not done, or doth any thing, more than Dauid did, which is, sicut praeceperat. &c. as God hath commaunded hir to do.
And syth Gods commaundement vnto Dauid stretcheth to the placing appointing both aboue vnder, in their orders of sacrifices, eue~ of all the leuiticall prieses: it strengthneth hir cause the more that she hath not onely the bare example of King Dauid, but also the warrant of Gods commaundement for the supreme gouernement of all hir clergie to place them in their seuerall functions.
Secondly, (ye say ye haue to note) that king Dauid did make appoyntment vnto them, of no straunge or new order to be taken in religion, but that they should serue God in the temple, iuxta ritum suum: after their owne vsage, custome or maner before time vsed.
Secondly, we note to you againe M. St. that you interprete his sayings ambiguously, and applie it maliciously.
Ambiguously, bicause thoughe Dauid neyther made any straunge or newe order to be taken in Religion, nor yet in their vsage custom or maner of their ceremonies commaunded of god, and so vsed before his time, but saw euery thing dutifully obserued both sicut praeceperat dominus, iuxta ritum suum: as the Lord had co~manded, after their owne order: yet in their courses and in other circumstances, diuers of his orders were new and strange vnto them, and of his owne appoyntment.
And diuers ceremonies that were iuxta ritum suum, according to their own order, hauing been neglected by the priests, and become straunge vnto them: those he redressed iuxta ritum suum, according to their own order, and sicut praeceperat dominus, as the Lorde had commaunded.
But what serueth this howe soeuer ye expounde it, to infringe any supreme gouernement in king Dauid? bicause the Prince is bounde not to alter the Priestes rites and ceremonies béeing appoynted of God, Ergo, he is not supreme gouernour in séeing them kéept accordingly? might ye not rather argue contrarywise.
The prince is bound not to alter religion, nor those orders that God hath ordeyned, bringing in straunge and new: Ergo, he is bound to ouersée, care, and prouide, that those orders be onely kept and none other brought in.
And if princes had alwayes looked to this their duetie more narrowly than they haue done, then had not your Pope and popishe Prelates broughte in so many vayne traditions, false doctrines, and superstitious ceremonies as they haue, neither iuxta ordinem suum, according to their owne order, nor sicut praceperat dominus, as the Lord commaunded.
On the other part this your application is a malicious slaunder to the Q. highnesse.
For she hath not made or appointed to be receiued, any strange or new order in religion, but reuoked the olde primatiue order of religion ordeined of Christ, and hath appoynted the ministers of God to do their dueties, secundum ritum suum, according to their owne order, sicut praeceperat dominus, as our sauiour Christ by him selfe, and his Apostles hath prescribed to them.
It is your Pope and Papall Church that offreth strange fire to God, that hath appoynted erected those strange and newe orders in religion, and therfore hir maiestie hath worthily abolished all those false priests with their strange and new orders, and all their false worship of God, and in that hir highnesse thus doth, she sheweth hir selfe to follow Dauids esample, like a godly supreme gouernour.
Thirdly and lastly (say you) king Dauids appoyntment was that they should serue in the house of God, sub manu Aaron patris corum, as vnder the spirituall gouernement of their father Aaron, and his successors the high Priests.
Héere agayne to the shew of some aduauntage, ye translate sub manu, which is vnder the hande, importing, attendant at hande in their ministerie to the high Priest: vnder the spirituall gouernement, as thoughe they were exempted from the kings gouernement, and so you make your conclusion, saying: The which words of the Scripture do so well and clearely expresse, that king Dauid did not take vpon him any spirituall gouernment in the house of God. &c.
This conclusion is captious, and yet not to the purpose.
There is a difference betwéene spirituall gouernment, and gouernment ouer spirituall cclesiasticall matters.
This ye should conclude, not that: if ye will confute the bishop.
And this gouernment ouer spirituall matters tooke Dauid on him, the other, that is, the spirituall gouernment he left entier vnto the Priests, without any preiudice to their ecclesiasticall authoritie, as ye graunted before.
And as Dauid therin did, so doth the Quéenes Maiestie nowe.
But what maketh this agaynst king Dauids supreme gouernment, that the inferior priests Leuites in their ministeries offices were by the kings appoyntment, vnder the hande or spirituall gouernment of their spirituall father Aaron, and his successors the high priests, as you translate the text? Is it not also the Q. Maiesties appoyntment, that the inferiour Ministers should serue in their functions, vnder the spiritual gouernment of their bishops? and bicause it is hir appoyntment, it is an argume~t not of hir subiectio~, but of hir authoritie héerein ouer them, as also is this of Dauid.
And therfore the exa~ple was very well applied, al your three notes on your notable sente~ce, that you haue added to your master, not onely nothing seruing your turne (for all ye haue so notably inuerted the text, so wrested the sense, so expou~ded the words, that your friends might very much muse and maruell at your falshoode) but also in the whole euery part, all your thrée notes, haue made cleane agaynst you.
And yet ye knit vp your conclusion on them, That ye can not but very much muse and maruell why he should alleage king Dauid for any example or proofe in this matter.
So desperate a face ye can set on the matter, though all be quite agaynst you.
Now, as M. Stap. dalied with Moses before, if he coulde not proue him a priest, yet at the least to proue him a prophet: so héere (after a florishe in one of his common places, slaunderously comparing our clergie with Qza) seeing that he can fasten no good argument against princes by the priests, he will once agayne assay it by the Prophets.
And where the bishop alleaged that Dauid made Psalmes, ordeined priests, Leuites, singers, and porters, &c. he denieth not, but that Dauid did al these things, but, sayth he, Think you he did al this and the rest of his owne authoritie, bicause he was king of the people? so you woulde haue your reader to beleeue, but the holy ghost telleth vs playnely, that Dauid dyd all this, bicause God had so commaunded by the handes of his Prophetes.
What argument call ye this, M. Stap? the king ordeined and set foorth ecclesiasticall lawes, bicause God had so commaunded by the hands of his Prophets.
Ergo, The king is not supreme gouernour to sée those thinges obserued, but the Prophetes are the supreme gouernours of them: Héere ye stande on two things, on Gods commaundement, and the Prophetes message.
As for your reason on Gods commaundement, is answered already, it not that godly Princes authoritie that submitteth him selfe to God, as Dauid did, and the Quéenes Maiestie doth: but it is to be brought agaynst the ambitious proud vsurpation of your Pope, that maketh him selfe as it were a God in earth, and will controll Gods flat commaundement.
Agayne, that ye vrge so much the ministerie of the Prophets, to abase the kings authoritie, and thereon make your conclusion, saying: Thus you see, that by the declaratio~ of the prophets Gods ministers then, as priests are now, the king did al those ecclesiasticall matters, and not by his princely authoritie.
This answere is but a méere shifte, and yet nothing for your priestes supremacie.
But suche is your enuie to princes, that ye care not to whome ye ascribe this supreme gouernment, so that princes haue it not.
When ye can not proue that it appertayned to the priests, ye alleage the prophets.
Ye are not so ignorant, dare say, but that ye know the prophets were no priests, and many of them (as ye terme vs lay men) and some also of occupation.
Yea but say you, they were Gods ministers then, as priestes are nowe.
Ye should proue they were priestes then, for, were they but Gods ministers herein to declare the same to the prince, doth this proue any supreme authoritie héerein ouer their prince? Nay but (say you) they were suche good ministers as priestes are nowe.
In déede were they suche as your priestes crake now to be, then the matter were out of question.
For your priests now say they, be not onely aboue kings, princes, and all other men, but aboue angels, yea that they can make their maker also which Angels can not do, as D. Bonner vaunted in his conuocation of priests.
The Prophets coulde do none of these things, nor so exalted them selues.
They were then Gods ministers and faythfull preachers of his worde, they were not sacrificers.
And if your priests nowe are like prophets then, they must not be sacrificers, but preachers of Gods worde, and so shal they be like the Prophets.
Your priests, chiefly your Pope can not erre in iudgement ye say, do ye father this warrant on the Prophetes, or on the Priests? haue ye not alleaged the priests for it? and nowe when ye sée the priests will not serue your turne, ye say ye be like the prophets.
But ye should make a distinction like what prophets ye be· are ye not like to lying prophets? are ye not like the Prophet that God sayd he would tempt his people withall, that shoulde say, come let vs goe worship straunge Gods? are ye not like the false flattring prophets that deceiued king Achaz, like Baals prophets maynteined of Iesabell? But Christ hiddeth vs take héede to suche false prophetes as you be, that come in sheepes clothing, and are rauening wolues within.
But let vs consider further this your shift by Prophets.
Ye say, Dauid did all those ecclesiasticall matters, but not by his princely authoritie, but by the declaration of the prophets, Gods ministers then as Priests are now: and therfore the next authoritie vnder God was theirs, not his, bicause he was no prophet.
But what nowe if Dauid were a prophet also, and is so co~monly termed, and your selfe the leafe before sayd, he had the gift of prophesie, and alleaged your master D. Harding for it? will not this proue then by your own shifte, that either he béeing Gods prophet, had therby so well as others this authoritie, contrarie to the which ye say he had it not, but the prophets had it: or else the hauing of the gift of prophesie, is no argument of any supreme authoritie, as ye would so sayne inferre.
As in déede it is not neither in priest nor prophet: which ye shoulde soone haue perceiued, had ye but read the next chapter to that, out of whiche you tooke (as ye fancied) your notable sentence for the Priestes gouernement.
of his appoyntment among the priestes and sonnes of Aaron.
The Chapter beginneth thus: And Dauid and the captaynes of the host appoynted out to do seruice, the sonnes of Asaph, of Heman and Iduthim, which should prophecie with Harpes, Psalteries, and Cymbals.
And the multitude of the men were to do seruice in their offices.
The sonnes of Asaph &c. to wayte on, or to be at the hand of Asaph, who prophecied by the king.
And againe, These were the sonnes of Heman the Kings Seer of visions in the wordes of God to lift vp the horne that is the power, meaning of Dauid.
And againe, saph, Iduthim, and Heman were at the Kings hande, that is to say, at the kings commaundement to execut hys appoyntment.
Chapter is of Dauids ordring the Porters diuisions, ending on this wise: VVhom king Dauid made rulers ouer the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the halfe of the tribe of Manasses, for euery matter perteyning to God, and for the kings businesse, that is to say, both in spirituall and temporall things.
And also a little aboue, In all the businesse of the Lorde, and for the seruice of the King.
Howbeit, speake not this so much to proue King Dauids supremacie ouer the Porters, in all and euery ecclesiasticall matter, so well as temporall, but chiefly to followe your shift of the Prophetes.
For here we sée howe expresly the Prophets also, were appoynted their orders by the king, and euen the principall fathers of them attendant vnto him, as their children were to them.
And thoughe theyr children were vnder theyr gouernmentes as were the inferiour Priestes vnder the higher Priestes, yet as Asaph, Heman, and Iduthim, were vnder the gouernment of the King also, who ordered, directed, appoynted and co~maunded them, so was Aaron and his successors the high priests vnder the appointment and order of the King, for all that their sonnes and inferior priests were vnderneath their gouernment.
For the one gouernment doth not exclude the other, as master Stapleton himselfe confesseth, that in one man many rulers may and do dayly concurre which in some sense may euery one be called his supreme gouernour.
And thus was first God by the ministerie of his priestes and prophetes, the absolute supreme gouernour vnto Dauid.
So was Dauid next vnder God, by his ouersight, ordering, and commaunding those ecclesiasticall actions to be rightly done, the supreme gouernour, not onely to the Leuits and Porters: but to the chiefe Priestes, to the chiefe Prophets and all.
And so were the chiefe priestes and principall Prophets in their functions and ministeries of theyr offices, the supreme gouernors ouer their inferior priests prophets: and yet was not their gouernment embarring the kings, nor the kings any whit preiudicial to theirs.
For the priestes and the prophets did the action: but the co~maundements, the appointing ordring, was the kings next to god, who co~maunded them to him, to the priests prophets.
And this order should M. St. haue séene had he but read the next sentence before the text that he vrgeth.
According to the commaundement or disposition of Dauid the king, of Gad the kings Seer of visions, and Nathan the prophet. &c.
Thus the prince, euen in those thing that god co~maundeth by the hand of the prophets, is chéef for his authoritie vnder God.
Next to whom are adioyed the Prophets, or learned preachers, or ministers of Gods worde, as by whose mouth or hande God commaundeth it to be done, and haue mosts skill thereof.
And yet that both priest prophet do their offices faithfully, apperteyneth to the kings co~mau~dement: appéereth further throughout this chap. as also in Ezechias ensample fro~ whence be takes this se~tence as we shall sée whe~ we come therto.
Onely thus much to detect the shifts yt M. St. maketh, stil leaping from priest to prophet, fro~ prophet again to priest, as it were a squirrel skipping fro~ one trée to another, to saue hir fro~ ye birdbolt, but all wil not be, nothing wil any thing serue his turne, but euery thing maketh quite against him: which whe~ he séeth (as it were to set an Oliuer agaynst a Rowlande, he alleageth agaynst king Dauids eusample, the ensample of Carolus Magnus.
Againe (saith he) the like might you haue alleaged of Carolus Magnus, that he corrected most diligently the order of reading and singing in the church, that he brought first into Frauce catum Gregorianu~, the order of singing lefte by S. Gregorie at Rome, and appoynted singers therfore, when they did not well, placed other in their rowmes.
And many such other like matters of the church, wherin that godly Emperour much busied him selfe, and yet exercised no supreme gouernment ouer the clergie, but was of all other Princes, most far fro~ it: as it may easily appeare to him that wil read in the decrees dist.
in memoriam, where he protesteth obedience to the Sea of Rome, yea though an importable charge should be layde vpon him by that holy Sea.
Ye haue picked out an vnlike vneuen match, M. St. to compare herein the doings of king Dauid with K. Charlemaines.
Where is become your Impar congressus Achilli Troilus, the vnequall matche betwene Troilus and Achilles? Howe corrupte the tyme of king Charlemayne was, and what practises and fetches your Pope vsed, to get the crowne of Fraunce to Pepin his father, from the right and lawful prince therof, and the Empire of Rome to Charlemayne, fro~ the Emperour of Constantinople, to who~ it dyd belong: euery hiltoriographer can tel, may fitter be declared in his proper place, than here to leape ouer the stile, ere ye come at it by many an hundreth miles: yet for hast ye breake your shinnes euen agaynst those things yt as trifles ye recken vp vnto vs.
As, the correcting most diligently the order of reading and singing in the Church, the placing and displacing singers, if he did these things as a godly Emperor, as ye say, then he tooke it, that as Emperor he had a gouernment in them.
But ye say as a godly Emperor he much busied him selfe.
If he found him self busines like a busie body, wherin he had no authoritie thus so place displace, to institute, order, and correct, how was he a godly Emperour therin, or not rather as ye sayd before, played Oza his part? But ye say he was therein a godly Emperour, therefore he did nothing of any buiositie, but of his owne authoritie and supreme gouernment therein.
Well yet say you it was but in singing and ouer singers.
Was it no further M. Stapleton: howe then do you say, the like you might haue alleaged of Carolus Magnus, to King Dauids doings? Did King Dauid meddle onely with singing and singers? Did he not meddle with Priestes and Prophetes also? But to salue the matter ye say, and many other suche like matters of the Church.
Whie tell ye not man what those many other matters were? haue ye no lust to declare them, for feare they would marre your market? Well, let them alone till we come to the proper examination of them.
Howbeit whatsoeuer they shall fall out to be, here remember ye liken them to King Dauids doings.
But King Dauid commaunded and appoynted singers, Priests, Prophetes, all the clergie, high, and lowe, of what degrée so euer: Ergo, King Charlemaines authoritie stretched further than to singing men, euen to all Priestes, Prophetes and all the clergie besides.
And thus eyther your similitude is not like, or else the one and the other maketh cleane against you.
But if these doings of Charlemaine be not like, yet hath master Stapleton another proufe in store.
which Iuo also alleageth, where he renueth out of the Code of Theodosius a lawe binding all his subiects of all Nations, Prouinces and Countreys, of what so euer qualitie or condition they were, and in all maner causes, if the defendant require an ecclesiastiall iudgement, it be not lawfull from the Bishops sentence to appeale any higher.
This lawe is here brought forth master Stapleton very vntimely and impertinently, nothing to proue or unproue the ensample or doings of King Dauid, vnlesse ye woulde proue it on this wie. uo alleageth a lawe of Theodosius, binding all his subiects of all Nations, Prouinces and Countreys, of whatsoeuer qualitie and condition they were, and in all maner causes, if the defendant require an ecclesiasticall iudgement, it be not lawful from the Bishops sentence to appeale any higher: Ergo king Dauid made the like lawe to this, or this was like to king Dauids lawes.
Howe thys hangeth togither like your Germaines lippes that before spake of, let others iudge.
King Dauids lawes were not for priests to be such Iudges, but for priests to be subiect to these orders, that they should obserue and obey them, porter, singer, Leuit, Priest, or Prophet, high or low, of what qualitie or condition soeuer they were.
These lawes of king Dauid were (as ye say) by Gods commaundement, by the mouth of his Prophets, and therefore coulde not be yll.
The law you cite of Iu from Theodosius, though at that time it were good, vpon some godly consideration, yet it is not ius diuinum, the law of god, it is but mans law, the princes law, sheweth a chief authoritie in him to giue such liberties to the clergie, which as they may be very wel vsed, especially when princes do looke well to them, that they vse their gifts, offices and priuileges dutifully: so haue they since by your pope and prelates bene very ill vsed, euen to the treading down of the doners of the~, Theodosius, Iuo, or any other.
And as the Iuy taking al his stre~gth growth from the Oke, so co~passeth ouergroweth it, and that by his gréene pleasant embracings of it, till the Iuy haue quite destroied the whole bole of the Oke: so haue your clergie by such franchesies liberties of princes, at the first by compassing them with counterfeit holines subtile deuises, so growne vp aboue them in riches, strength and possessions, that at the length ye haue destroied brought to nothing, all their supreme estate ouer you.
For whereto bring ye out this priuiledge of the Emperor Theodosius, that none might appeale to any higher sentence than the B. but as ye haue brought it now in the end, to cal cora~ vobis, as your vnderling, eue~ the prince himself, from who~ ye co~fesse this your priuilege came? And thus ye alleage king Iuo his lawes as it were an Iuy bush to behold how your popish prelates do play ye Iuies part.
But it is hie time with other sharper lawes that princes pull vp such Iuies by the rootes.
Now as ye haue thus shifted off ye answere to king Dauids doings, redressings, ordrings, lawes, and chiefe gouernment in ecclesiasticall causes, so to knit vp the knot, euen like a fawning Iuy about princes your selfe: And surely (say you) no Prince more recognized their obedience to the spirituall magistrate in spirituall causes, than such as were most readie and carefull to ayde, further, and to their power direct, all spirituall matters.
This therefore proueth well that godly princes do further and set foorth godly religion, by meanes seemely to their vocations.
Why master Stap. who desireth or attributeth more to Princes than to set forth Gods religion by meanes semely to theyr vocation? If this ensample of Dauid, as you say, proue thus much: then to gouerne, direct, commaunde, and appoynt the Priests, yea your hiest Priestes, as Dauid did, is no vnseemely meanes to their vocation, nor vnsitting euen for your Popes vocation, to obey the Princes appoyntment and commaundement.
And if to direct all spirituall matters may be done of Princes, yet the obedience to the spirituall Pastor in spirituall matters, still recognized: then doth not the Quéenes Maiestie any preiudice to them, recognizing to them a dutifull obedience in the ministration of spirituall matters: for all that she fetteth forth Gods true religion and directeth all spirituall matters, as ye graunt she maye.
Which is as much as the Bishop or any of vs desire, or hir Maiestie taketh on hir.
But (say you) here is no maner of inckling, that Princes do or did euer beare the supreme gouernment in all ecclesiastical matters, to decide and determine, to alter and chaunge, to set vp and plucke downe, what religion liked them by their princely authoritie, and mere soueraigntie.
Haue ye gone about to impugne this all this while M. Stapleton, then see well it was not for nothing that alwayes ye aunswered so wide.
Doth the Bishop maintaine or euer sayde that Princes might decide, determine, alter, chaunge, set vp, pluck downe, what religion liked them, by their Princely authoritie, and mere soueraigntie? Quote me the lease, name me the place, where once the Bishoppe so said.
Or doth the Q. Maiestie take any such thing vpon hir.
These be but your wicked, had almost sayde traytrous slaunders, to desace hir highnesse to hir simple subiectes.
And no doubt so ye report to other Countreys of hir Maiestie, as ye write here most opprobiously agaynst hir.
It is your Pope agaynst whom ye should make this conclusion, for he taketh on him to decide and determine, to alter and chaunge, to set vp and pluck downe what religion liketh him.
The Quéenes Maiestie, God be highly praysed for hir, as a most godly supreme gouernour feloweth king Dauids ensample, and neyther your wicked conclusion toucheth hir, nor these your shifting counterblasts come nere the matter in hande.
AFter King Dauid, the Bishop alleageth the wise King Salomon his sonne, citing a briefe summe of his actes that inferre his supreme authoritie.
For answere to this, Master Stapleton chooseth out one act of Salomon, as a full aunswere to all the rest besydes, and sayth: The weight of this obiection resteth in the deposition of Abiathar the high Priest.
The weight of this aunswere resteth first vpon a manifest vntruth.
The Bishop alleaged besides Abiathars deposition, the placing of Sadocke, the placing of the arke in the temple of Salomon, the dedication of the temple, the offring sacrifices, blessing the people, directing the Priestes, Leuites and other Church officers after his fathers orders, and the Priestes obedience in euery thing to the kinges commaundement: none of these obiections resting on Abiathers deposition.
Onely the néerest that commeth to it, is the placing of Sadocke in Abiathars roome.
And yet sayth M. Stap. the weight of this obiection resteth in the deposition of Abiathar the high priest.
And so thinketh if he fully aunswere this, he hath satisfied all the rest.
Nowe since M. Stapleton will néedes haue it so, and hath prepared himself onely to aunswere the deposition of the high Priest, as the highest and principallest matter, be it so, let vs go forwarde with him, and sée his aunswere thereto.
Although hereafter he must remember, that if the placing and displacing of prelates, be a matter of such importance (as in déede it is to this present purpose) that the answering of it includeth diuerse other weightie poyntes also: then the inuestiture of Bishops is not so impertinent a matter, as nowe and then he will sée me to make it being vrged therewith.
He must remember also, that making all other obiections to rest on this as chiefe, if he answere not this, then both all the other be vnaunswered: and this being a chiefe matter doth quite ouerthrow all his counterblast besides, and brings his pope to his olde obedience, yea in case also of lyke deposition to Abiathars.
Wherefore, it standes him now in hande, to answere well and surely vnto this obiection.
To go therefore (like a profounde clerke déepely séene in the doctours) the more authentically to worke, he first presseth vs with the authorities of his good masters: This thing (sayth he) Master Dorman, and Master doctor Harding say employeth no more superioritie, than if a man should say Queene Mary deposed Master Cranmer.
But Queene Marie was not the chiefe, but an accessorie instrument for the furtherance of the execution.
Ergo, Salomon in deposing Abiathar was not the chiefe, but an accessorie instrument for the furtherance of the execucution.
Ye are much in Master D. Hardings debte already master Sapleton, for much good stuffe that ye haue borrowed of him, especially this example of Quéene Mary and Bishop Cranmer, which perceiue ye like full well, therefore ye will borrowe it once againe: and bicause master Dorman borrowes it out of him also, ye will borrowe it of both: neuerthelesse so, that they haue the praise thereof that vsed it before you.
And therefore to gratifie your masters againe mulus mulum scabit, for one mule as the latine prouerbe saith rubbes another mule) you euer referre vs to their high authoritie, saying: say with master D. Harding: say with master Dorma~: D. Har. sheweth: master Dor. and master D. Harding affirme: M. D. Harding noteth.
M. D. Harding toucheth: and here, master Dor. and master D. Harding say it imployeth no more.
Thus ye thinke to saue your credite with them, to obiecte their credence and authoritie to vs.
But in thus doing, either ye shewe a great arrogancie in them, or an extreame flatry in your selfe, with no lesse folly, to frame your argument on their bare sayings, and obiect it to vs for good authoritie, they being parties aduersary, besides, God wotte, their litle estimation euen among your selues.
Although herein taking witnesse thus one of another, what is it else than to aske your owne fellowes if you say true or no? Let go therefore your masters authoritie, and if ye will néedes alleage them, alleage their reasons if they haue any, and tel vs not they say imployes no more, but proue you, or alleage their proues, that it employes no more.
Ye vrge the doings of Quéene Marie how litle they imployed, but ye take pro concesso and not to be denyed to your Master, that their doings were alike· wheras they were most vnlike, and quite contrary.
Quéene Mary ye say was but the accessorie instrumente therein to the high prieste which is ye say the Pope: but Salomon deposing the high priest, that as ye likewise say was the figure of your Pope, how could he be an accessorie instrumente to the high priest, when he sat vppon him, gaue indgemente against him, and deposed him? was the high priest the principall doer of it against him selfe, and Salomon but his accessorie instrument? indede your high priests beare princes so in hande, that no body can sit in iudgement on them, or depose them, but they must do it them selues, or else it can not be done.
Abiathar neuer learned that knacke, but was iudged and deposed of his prince.
nor the prince was his instrument thereof, for then had he not bene deposed at all, he would not haue made an instrument to Salomon to depose him selfe.
But Salomon did it against the will of Abiathar being a traytor to him: nor he did it as the other priestes accessorie instrumente, for a the other priests were inferiour to their high priest: and the inferiour (your lawe saith, and good reason to) can not depose the superiour, Ergo, he was accessarie instrument to no liuing creature herein, but did it by his owne royall authoritie, and therfore by this royall authoritie he was supreme gouernour ouer the priests, yea, the highest priest and all.
Nowe contrariwise, Quéene Mary did not depose the highest priest, which you say is your pope of Rome, and not the Archbishop of Caunterbury, excepte ye will translate your primacie fro~ Rome to Canterburie.
She wrongfully deposed the archbishop of Cant. or rather as ye say, was but an accessorie instrument to the furtherance of the execution.
For so in very déede ye vsed hir, while your Romish Pope his legats and prelats were the doers thereof: she sate not on hym in iudgemente, nor gaue sentence agaynste hym, as did Salomon againste Abiathar, and had she done so, as ye woulde not haue allowed hir dooing, so would ye not allowe him to be the highest priest.
And if ye will néedes haue it, that their doings were alike, then as King Salomon deposed by his princely authoritie the chiefe Bishop, so, after your account that the Byshop of Rome is the chiefe Bishop, she should haue deposed the Bishop of Rome, which she did not, but set him vp in hir realme euen aboue hir selfe, where he was before put downe: so that these doings being in euery point contrary, how are King Salomons doings with the high priest Abiathar, like to the doings of Quéene marie to Bishop Cranmer? and therefore this is but a shifting aunswere of your Masters olde stuffe: and you are but their accessorie instrument, to burnish it a freshe: which ye doso yll fauouredly, that your master or you can take little honestie by it.
Ye alleaged this comparison of Q. Mary out of your Master once before, that Quéene Mary redressed religion, but by the meanes of the Priests.
What is the meane wherby one doth any thing, but the accessorie instrument whereby he doth it? And what is the accessorie instrument but the meane? But the Priestes ye say are the meane, for the Prince to doe it by.
Ergo the Priestes were but the accessorie instrumentes to the Quéene.
Which if it were any abasing of the Princes superioritie, whie is it not an abasing of your Priestes? And as ye make these shiftes thus in the ende fall out against your cause: so can ye not agrée in your owne tales to your selfe.
In the ensample of Dauid the Quéene was the represser, and the Priests were the means or instrument: in this cause of Salomon, where your Pope by his figure (as you say) the high priest, is so nere touched with an example of depriuation: There contrary to that ye tolde vs before, the highe Priest him selfe must be the represser, and the Prince but the meane or instrument.
And thus it séemeth ye care not what ye say, for you, or agaynst you, so ye maye shift of the matter in one place, though in another ye speake quite contrary.
And thinking to beare your selfe out with your masters authoritie, yée make your master partaker of your shame, besides the shame that they haue for their shamefull shiftes receyued alreadie at the Bishop of Sar. and master Nowels hands.
But here thinking to be euen with master Nowell for confuting this vnlike similitude, vsed also as newe freshe stuffe by master Dorman.
But Lord (sayth he) howe master Nowell here besturreth him selfe? Nowe when the Reader should looke howe here master Stapleton would besturre him selfe, to bring ought against master Nowell: he dare alleage nothing, it was but a copie of his countenance.
He fumeth and he fretteth with master Dorman (sayth he) who shall coole him well ynough doubt not.
In the meane while, will aske master Horne and master Nowell to, one question.
Yea forsooth master Stapleton, like your witte nowe better than before, demaunde what you will, but chalenge not the combat so fast as ye did ere while, cumber not your selfe with more aduersaryes than ye néede, ye shall finde more ease in the ende.
Master Horne sayth (say you) a little before that Iosue sacrificed burnt sacrifices, and burnt offrings, that king Dauid sacrificed burnt and peace offrings, that Salomon offred sacrifices.
VVere trow ye Iosue, Dauid, and Salomon priests? If so, then how bring you their ensamples to proue any thing for Kings and Queenes that are no Priestes? If not, then this phrase is verefied in that they caused the Priestes (to whome the matter pertayned) to offer sacrifices.
And so whereas M. Horne sayth of Iosue, that he sacrificed burnt sacrifices which is agreeable to the latine obtulit holocausta, master Nowell sayth he commaunded sacrifice to be offred.
Thus farre your question to the Bishop, and your dilemma thereon.
To the question aunswere, that neither Iosue, Dauid, nor Salomon were priestes, if not, say you, then by your owne words and master Nowels, this phrase is verefied, that they caused the priests to offer sacrifices.
graunt ye master Stapleton, and it was graunted to you many tymes before by the Bishop: what inferre ye herevppon? And why then pray you M. Nowell (say you, turning your speche to him) may not this phrase also be taken after the said sorte that Salomon deposed Abiathar in procuring him by some ordinarie way to be deposed for his treason? as master Cranmer might haue bin, though he were deposed and burnt for his heresie.
Here is a matter farre fette or euer the inconuenience breake out.
In the ende thanks be to God, this is the worst conclusion: and why may not this phrase also (of deposing) be taken after the said sorte of sacrificing? aunswere, that to reason from may to must, either must or may be but a mustie reason.
had thoughte this déepe question, and this lustie dilemma vppon it, woulde haue concluded with a necessitie, this phrase of deposition muste be so resolued as the other of sacrifice: and commeth it now in like a poore hedgecréeper, with a perchaunce that it maye bée so resolued? parturiunt montes nascitur ridiculus mus: the mountaynes trauaile, out there péepes a mouse.
But nowe since ye conclude no furder, but that it may be so, what if one would doubte of your may bird, and like a good simple plaine dealing man, wold bluntly say to your may, Perawnter yea sir: perawnter nay sir, and bid ye reason more substantially than to stand on a peraduenture that it may be so.
But since ye will nedes know why the one phrase may not be vnderstoode like the other, will not only shew you why they may not, but also why they must not.
The phrases on the one parte of Iosues, Dauids and Salomons sacrifices, mighte not be done personally by them, bycause they were no priests, but it must haue bin done by the priests, bicause it was the priests especiall office appointed of God But in this other case of deposition.
Salomon not only might either commaund or execute personally, or by his deputie: but of dutie ought to haue deposed that naughtie high priest, bicause on the one parte it was no especiall or any part at all of the priestes office appointed by God to depose their high prest, nor the inferiors cold depose their primate: on the other parte, only the king could do it, did it, and ought to do it, bicause it appertayed to his royall estate, and was appointed by God thereto.
And thus ye sée the phrases are not alike, neither may nor must be resolued the one by the other, as ye say in your co~clusion, Salomo~ deposed Abiathar in procuring him by some ordinarie waye to be deposed for his treason.
What some ordinarie way should this be, that ye tell vs thus generally, he mighte procure? If it were for the lower to depose the higher, it was no ordinarie way.
If it were by the other priests, it was by the lower.
If it were by some Prophete, it was extraordinarie, and yet ye pull downe the Prophetes and all vnder the priests, especially vnder the high priest.
If it were by the princes procurement, ye say the prince is also inferior, durst any inferior at an other inferiors commaundement, or procuring, attempte to depose their superiour, yea their supreme? your Pope wold giue ye little thankes, and he hard ye harpe on that string master Stapleton.
By what ordinarie way then shuld it be done, who shoulde haue done it, who shoulde haue procured it? Can ye deuise any excepte the ordinary power that God gaue the Prince, had byn the procurer doer and all thereof? Nowe that ye haue put foorthe youre question, made youre dilemma, lapte vp youre conclusion, and nothing still serueth your turne, but more againste you: shall be so old as to demand of you agayne, euen your owne questio~, and adde another dilemma of your owne wordes thereto? VVere trow ye Iosue, Dauid, and Salomon priests? If so, then howe say ye here, this phrase (they sacrificed) is verefied in that they caused the priests to whom the matter perteyned to offer sacrifices? And why vse ye all the shiftes ye can to abase their doinges? If no: Whie sayde ye then thrée leaues before of Iosue, If yee will haue your examples to proue confirme, then as Iosue circumcided, so let the prince baptise, and as Iosue sacrificed vpon an aultar, so let the prince in cope and surplesse celebrate your holy communion? Did Iosue circumcise and sacrifice personally him selfe, and was no priest? speake this onely to shewe your shifting off of your aduersare on the one part, and your contradiction to your selfe on the other, euen in your owne question.
Although herein if ye say they were no priestes (which this your later exposition, contrary to the first inferreth) ye say the truer, and therefore doe well to recant your former saying.
But sée howe ye contrary your selfe once agayne, ye liken the phrase of deposition and sacrificing togither.
Salomon deposed Abiathar in procuring by some ordinarie way to haue him deposed: And Iosue, Dauid, and Salomon did sacrifice, in that they caused the Priestes to offer sacrifice.
Here the Prince when he will haue sacrifice done, causeth the priest to minister and execute the sacrifice, and so the Prince doth it by the Priestes handes.
Who is here the instrument for the furtherance of the execution? the priest.
For the Prince can not, except ye will make him a Priest.
Who is the causer (as ye call him) and such a causer, as hath the name of the doer, though he do it not, but haue an accessorie instrument for him? the Prince.
Doe ye not sée what an ouerthrow ye giue your selfe? and withall speake cleane contraryes not a dosen lynes asunder? The Prince is not the chiefe, but an accessorie instrument to the furtherance of the execution: the Prince is the causer and doer, but he doth it by an others execution.
Is not this plain contradiction? and yet to helpe the matter, ye let another on the necke of it.
As Iosue and Dauid did sacrifice, so did Salomon depose Abiathar.
Salomon was the minister and executer: Iosue and Dauid were not the ministers and executers: If these things be a like, this is another manyfest contradiction.
If they be not a like, why bring ye them one for proufe of another? Why affirme ye them to be alike, when the doyng of the one by your owne report, is contrary to the other? Eyther ye lie in saying they be alike, or ye speake huddle and ouerthwart your selfe.
And yet while ye would séeme nicely to stande descanting on the phrases, (be it vnwares or wittingly) ye graunt the full point of the matter, that in the sacrifices, and the deposition, whosoeuer were the executor, the Prince was the procurer, the causer, and the commaunder therof, which is ynough to argue his supreme authoritie therein.
Your conclusion is, he was deposed by the Princes procurement, for his treason.
And who was this yt thus was delt withall? for sooth the highest priest.
Why, the highest priest is (ye say) the figure of your Pope, was the figure of your Pope then a traytor? trust ye will tell a good tale for your Pope anon.
Nay will ye say, the Pope can not be a traytour, nor be deposed, bicause he is the highest Priest.
And what say ye to Abiathar the successour of Aaron, was not he the highest Priest also? If he were not, name an higher.
And yet sée, his seate saued him not from being a traytor, nor his highnesse from being vnder the prince that deposed him.
And had he not béene vnder his Prince, he could not haue bene a traytour to him.
traytour is he that reuolting from his dutifull obedience to his Prince, rebelleth or conspireth agaynst him.
But ye say Abiathar was a traytour: Ergo, he ought a duetifull obedience to his Prince, from the which he swarued.
Now if that hiest Priesthood (which as ye say was a figure of the Popes highest Priesthoode) was neuerthelesse obedient to the Princes royall authoritie, and the highest priest might be a traytour, in swaruing from his obedience: then the Bishop of Rome hauing nowe likewyse the highest Priesthoode (as ye pretende) ought neuerthelesse to bee the Emperour of Romes obedientiarie: and if he swarue from his obedience: as was Abiathar, he is a traytour and ought to be deposed as Abiathar was.
But howe well he hath set the paterne of Abathars trason before his eyes, and farre passed it, in conspiring rebelling against the Emperor of Rome, and in the end hath exempted himselfe from all obedience of the emperiall estate, denying that he can be a traytor therto, but contrary, that the emperor oweth obedience vnto him: it is so manifest that your selues can not deny it.
Only therfore it now remayneth that all other princes in their signiories, as the Quéenes Maiestie hath done in hirs, take ensample of wise king Salomons supreme gouernement, in deposing this traterous Abiathar.
And thus thinking to deface the memorie of the blissed martyr Bishoppe Cranmer, that neuer conspired agaynst his prince, that neuer claymed supremacie ouer his prince, that neuer tooke hym selfe to be the highest Priest, that in hys lyfe lyued lyke a moste godly father, and in his death behaued himselfe as mylde as a Lambe: ye haue no whitte Master Stapleton blemished hys renowne, yea your disprayse redoundeth to hys greater prayse.
Neyther doth your masters nor your similitude of him to Abiathar, agree in any poynt, onely with your Pope it agréeth, and that as you sée in euerye poynte so iumpe: that, as hée claymeth Abiathars chiefest place, as hée hath practysed more than Abiathars treason, so Chrisyan Princes followyng King Salomons steppes, shoulde giue hym also Abiathars rewarde.
And were that or thys Abiathar neuer so muche the highest Priest, Christian Princes haue the same authoritie nowe to depose lowest and highest also, that Salomon had before: except Maister Stapleton haue yet some further shifte to delude thys fact of Salomon.
But nowe master Horne, (saith he) that Salomon was but a minister and an executer herein, the verie wordes immediately following (the which bicause they serue plainely against your purpose, you craftily dissembled) do testifie.
And here he fastneth a triumphant note in the margine.
Master Horne ouerthrowne concerning the deposition of Abiathar, by the very next line of his owne text guilefully by him omitted.
Here is of a sodaine a sore a doe in déede.
Salomon shall be proued but a minister and an executer herein, by the plaine wordes of the scripture.
The Bishop shall be proued a craftie dissembler, and a guilefull omitter of those wordes.
May the matter go by M. Stap. wordes, these wordes giue a very boisterous Counterblast.
But since he will proue it by the scripture, let vs heare not his, but the scriptures wordes, and his conclusion thereon.
The wordes are these: And so Salomon put away Abiathar from being Priest vnto the Lorde, to fulfill the wordes of the Lorde, which hee spake ouer the house of Hely in Silo.
Ergo Salomon was but the minister and executor of Gods sentence published before by Samuell the Leuite.
What doth this infringe the Bishops purpose, or ouerthrow his assertion master Stap? can ye conclude hereon he, was not the supreme gouernour next vnder God in doing of the fact, because he was the minister and executor of gods sentence? By this rule the Prince were not supreme gouernour vnder God, in any poynt of ciuill iustice neither: for he is therein also a minister and executor of Gods sentence, that by his Prophees commaundeth the Prince to minister and execute iustice.
And by this rule, howe coulde prooue this superioritie to bée youre Pope eyther? would ye make him haue such a claime, that he should not be Gods minister and executer of Gods sentences? or would ye not rather reason contrary? He is in all spirituall causes the minister and executer of Gods sentences published by his Prophets.
Ergo he is the supreme gouernour vnder God in all spirituall causes.
If ye had any sentence of God to proue this antecedent, warrant ye then ye would reason on this wise.
Yea, you do reason on this wise, though ye haue no sentence of God at all therefore.
As for vs, we haue (as by your owne testimonie) the worde of God to warrant, that the Prince in deposing the hiest Priest, and figure of your Pope as ye say, hath so good warrant of authoritie therefore: that euen hee was Gods minister therein, and executer of Gods sentence.
which plainly argueth his supreme authoritie next and immediately vnder God.
To be a minister and executer on that fashion next and immediately vnder God, is no argument to abase the princes authoritie.
If ye had proued he had béene the priestes vnderling minister, and executour herein, this had béene somewhat to your purpose.
But this ye could not proue, and ye sayd the contrary before, that the priest was the princes minister and executour, and that he deposed Abiathar not by himselfe, but as he sacrificed, by causing another to minister and execute for him.
Nowe when ye say the Prince is Gods minister and executer, the priest is the princes minister and executer, doe not your self pray you acknowledge in the ministerie and the execution the priest to be vnder the prince? and that the prince is not onely Gods minister and executer, but as ye say further the causer, commaunder, and procurer also therof to the priestes? Is this the ouerthrowing of the Bishop as your margin maketh boast: or is it not rather the ouerthrowing of your selfe? can ye speake any thing more plaine for the Bishop, and agaynst your cause than this? and yet ye crie eut that the Bishop omitted and dissembled his guilefully craftily, verily M. Stap· there was no cause ye see why he should so do, the craft and guile is but your owne, the Bishop as he did in all the other doings, onely touched them per transnnam, not describing any one of the circumstances, but in a worde or two shewed the fact, and so passed ouer to other factes of Salomon.
But whatsoeuer the Bishop tolde or left vntolde, it had béene better for you, as ye haue vsed guylefully and craftily many other poyntes, to haue omitted and dissembled this, if ye haue no better shift than this, that not onely maketh nothing agaynst the Bishoppes assertion in Salomons supreme gouernment, but still more and more, euen by the mouth of God by his Prophets doth confirme the same.
Nowe that none of all shifts will hitherto srue against this one ensample of Salomon, yet hath M. St on shift more behinde, and that a trimme shift to.
Besides (sayth he) that the deposing of Abiathar doeth not employ that Salomon was the chiefe ruler in all causes ecclesiasticall, whiche is the Butte that ye must shoote at, and then must ye prouide another bowe, for this will not shoote home.
This is one of your olde sale shiftes M. Stap.
sée you are nowe euen at the last cast, to let the arrowe alone, and quarrell about the bow, and the butte, but and ye would (as ye gaue good counsell to others) haue followed it your selfe, in firing still your eye on the issue betwéene the parties in controuersie: neyther would yemake so many vagaryes as ye do, nor here haue quarelled at the Bishop short shooting.
The wordes of the issue whiche is the butte that M. Feck. requireth the Bishop to shoote vnto (if ye be remembred) are these: to make proofe vnto me that any Emperour or Empresse, King or Queene, may claime or take vppon them any such gouernment in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes (meaning as doth the Quéene) if the Bishop proue this: then he hittes the Butte.
His artillerie the Bow and Arrowes that he must shoote withall at thys Butte, are appoynted by him likewise: the Scriptures, the doctors, the Counsels, and the practise: the testimonies, allegations, decrées, and examples therein conteyned.
The Bishop hitherto hath with many arrowes out of the Scripture hit the Butte so full: that as yet ye coulde not make this quarrell, but sought other peltyng shiftes.
Nowe, séeing that none of all those paltrie brablings will serue, ye say hée shootes not home, and must chaunge his Bowe.
His Bowe here is the Scripture, his Arrowes here are the ensamples of Salomon, of which the Bishop shotte a good many seuerall Arrowes and factes, and euery one hitte the Butte.
He alleaged not onely the facte of Abiathars deposition, but also of Sadockes placing, of consecrating the Temple, of sacrificing, of placing the Arke therein, of blessing the people, of directing the Priests, Leuites, and other Churche officers, and of their obedience to all his commaundements.
Of all these allegations, you your selfe master Stapleton, choose one to answere vnto, whiche is the deposition of the highe Priest, and say all the obiection dependes thereon.
And so guylefully omitting the residue, stande onely a measuring thys shotte, and in the ende after muche warbling crie out, shorte, shorte, ye muste prouide another Bowe, for thys wyll not shoote home.
The deposing of Abiathar doeth not employe that Salomon was the chiefe Ruler in all ecclesiasticall causes.
First, what if it doth not, M. Stapleton? one fact of Salomon employes not all ecclesiasticall causes.
Go to, doth it employ some ecclesiasticall causes to be in the chiefe rule of the Prince? If ye graunt me this, ye graunt the issue, and this is the ende ye graunt.
But ye say it employes not all ecclesiasticall causes· and therefore is short· Did the Bishop againe shoote no more but that one? how chaunce ye medled not in measuring of the other? Did ye foresee, that as this had hitte one cause, another woulde hitte another, and so at the least euery one one cause, yea perchaunce euery one and so a number of your causes might be hitte, and perchaunce all causes, by some one shot, not yet measured, and therefore guylefully and crastily disembling and omiting them, you let all the rest alone.
Yet should ye not then for shame haue thus cryed out agaynst this one first shotte, since if it were shorte though short shooting léese the game, yet one shorte shotte leaseth it not.
And if one bee shorte, manye other maye come home, and wynne the game for all this, especially matching with one that shooteth so faire and Gentlemanlyke as you doe Maister Stapleton, that it were better to stande at the marke many tymes, than from it.
But séeing ye deale so vneuenly with the Bishops other shottes, (for all your bellowing short, shorte, it hittes not the Butte, it commes not home) ye giue all standers by, suspition of fale ayme in this shotte, and therefore let vs measure it once againe.
The deposing of Abiathar (saye you) doth not employ that Salomon was chiefe ruler in all ecclesiasticall causes.
pray you who was then chiefe ruler in all ecclesiasticall causes? Abiather say you.
And wherefore he? bicause he was the highest Priest or Byshoppe, therefore the chiefe rule of them was in him.
Doth it not then followe, if he depose him, in whome is all the rule, that all this rule is yet restrayned vnder hys higher rule, that deposeth him? For the more manfest ensample of our time: If aske in whom the chiefe rule of all ecclesiastical causes is now, in the Pope, say you: wherfore? say I: bcause, say you, he is the hiest Priest or Bishop, and therefore he hath the yest rule of all ecclesiasticall causes Well say I, if the Emperou nowe woulde go aboute to cite the Pope, to iudge him, and tell him he is the childe of death, for not acknowledging his olde obedience to him, and so deposing hym bydde him departe and meddle no more with that Byshoprike: the Emperour can not doe this (say you) for then the Pope in all ecclesiasticall causes shoulde be the Emperours inferiour, if the Emperour might depose bicause when he is deposed by the Emperour from all his chiefe rule, all his chiefe rule is translated from him, and so were hée vnder the Emperour, and all his chiefe rule at the Emperours disposition to giue to another.
But thys saye you were suche a fowle inconuenience as the lyke can not bée.
And therefore the Emperour can not depose the Pope, but the Pope the Emperour.
Wherein doe ye not sée, howe the graunting of the deposition of the chiefe Priest, inferreth a hyer rule and authoritie in the deposer ouer the deposed, in euerie prerogatiue that the partie deposed had before he was deposed? But then (will ye say) the Prince that deposed the highest Priest, may not he doe all those matters that the priest might haue done, if hée bée the chiefe ruler of them? It is one thing master Stapleton, to be the chiefe ruler in and ouer all those ecclesiasticall causes, that the partie deposed myghte haue done, and to bée the chiefe doer or executioner of them.
For example, the Prince maketh an Admirall or chiefe ruler ouer hys Seas, a President or Deputie ouer hys Marches, a chiefe Iustice or Chauncellour ouer hys lawes. &c.
These Officers agayne, the king deposeth: the deposition of them is an argument, that in all those thinges the King is the chiefe ruler.
And although the King can not doe anye of those thinges that belong to their Offices, yet is that no impayring of hys chiefe rule ouer them and all thinges in theyr offices: And therefore hée transferreth the doing, to them that better can or wyll doe those offices.
And so likewyse in the chiefe office of priesthood (admitting there were such an one now in all ecclesiasticall causes) though the prince can not do all those ecclesiasticall actio~s nor any one of them: yet grant the prince that he may depose that chiefe priest, to whome the doing of them appertaineth: ye graunt with all that he is the chiefe ruler of all those ecclesiasticall things, so farre forth as the rule of ouersight, gouernance and directing stretcheth vnto, which is aboue the ministeriall executing.
Nowe (as youre selfe haue confessed) the prince is the causer, and the prieste the executor, and doer, which likewise his name importeth, and therefore is called minister: whiche name though the prince haue also, yet he hath it (as your selfe haue likewise confessed) in a higher respecte, bicause he is Gods especiall minister, to ouersée, directe, dispose, and depose all other ministers.
And thus graunting the ensample euen but of this one facte of Salomon for our princes to followe, to depose in their realmes any one whatsoeuer highest or lowest priest, it not only hitteth home the butte, yea and the pricke to, set vp by master Fecke~ham: but this one facte of Salomon, and the like of christian princes now, employeth a chiefe rule of ouer sight and direction (though not of executing in al ecclesiasticall causes) besides whatsoeuer appertayneth to the parties office that may be so deposed, as Abiathar was by Salomon.
The vntruth that ye note in the end of this ensample, is orderly aunswered in your beadrolle.
TThe Bishop in this diuision alleadging the example of king Iosaphat, chiefly of two visitatio~s set forth by him,
how he reformed religion through out all his dominions, appointed preachers and setters foorth of Gods lawe, and Iudges in all causes aswell ecclesiasticall as temporal: co~cludeth his supreme gouernment herevpon.
To this Master Stap. counterblaseth: As M. Doctour Harding and M. Dorman haue written so say that yee are they which frequent priuate hilles, aulters and darke groues that the scripture speaketh of.
VVherein you haue set vp your Idols that is your abhominable heresies.
In that ye say, master Stapleton, As they say, so say I, ye shewe howe well ye haue learned your lessons thus one of another, to say what soeuer your master sayd before you, and take your bare so saying for proufe good inough.
But as ye fondly flatter your selues with your owne sayings, so more fondly ye obtrude them as principles to your aduersaries, that will by and by bid ye either proue them, or else will they still estéeme them as they are, for mere lying sayings of a knot of thrée false confederates, the master his two schollers to outface delude the manifest truth withal.
And if these your masters sayings and yours hap to become wordes of course, then beware you on whose side they are lykest to light, that haue mainteyned so open Idolatrie, and diuerse false worships of God that he did neuer institute.
After this master Stapleton drawing néerer to the matter, admiteth this example of King Iosaphat: VVee also confesse (sayeth he) that there is nothing written in the holye Scripture of Iosaphat, touching his care and diligence about the directing of ecclesiasticall matters, but that godly Princes may at this day do the same, doing it in such sort as Iosaphat did.
Holde ye here master Stapleton, and we aske no more of you.
First the care and diligence, that Iosaphat had aboute the directing ecclesiasticall matters.
Which care and diligence was the Bishoppes first proposition, nowe twise alreadie graunted by you, what followed thereon ye haue heard before alreadie.
Secondly, that godly Princes may at this day doe the same, doyng it in such sort as Iosaphat did.
Herevpon conclude this argument: As Iosaphat did in directing ecclesiasticall matters, so doth the Queenes maiestie nowe: But all godly Princes ought so to do, as Iosaphat did in directing ecclesiasticall matters: Ergo, the Quéenes Maiestie doth now, as all godly Princes ought to do.
To proue that she doth as did king Iosaphat: your selfe confesse, that he reformed religion and was carefull and diligent about directing ecclesiasticall matters.
But the Queenes Maiesties clayme is none other herein but this, to reforme religion and to be carefull and diligent about directing ecclesiasticall matters: Ergo, King Iosaphats doings and hirs are not vnlike.
Ergo, King Iosaphats example hitteth home the Butte, and is a fitte patterne to hir and all godly Princes of supreme gouernment in ecclesiasticall causes.
Here séeing that for fashions sake, where ye durst not denie the manifest truth, ye haue graunted so much that in déede ye haue graunted all: ye would now restraine your graunt, and say it was conditionall, that though all Princes may reforme religion, and with care and diligence direct all ecclesiasticall matters, yet they must do it in suche sort as Iosaphat did: and therefore leauing your simple and generall termes of reformation and direction by godlye Princes, yée will haue them perticulerly leueled by that sort that Iosaphat did them.
Whiche as we gladly, graunt you in all thinges that Iosaphat did well and godly, as were the moste of his doings, and in al that which the Bishoppe rehearseth: yet in some thinges Princes muste not doe in that sort, but go beyonde him.
For, althoughe for the moste part he did those thinges, Quae placta erant domino, That were acceptable to the Lorde: en excelsa non abstulit, Notwithstanding he tooke not away the high places: wherein godly princes muste do after a more zealous sort than Iosaphat did.
As for all those things that the Bishop citeth, sée that ye stand to your graunt made vnto vs, that Iosaphat reformed religion, and vsed care and diligence about the directing of ecclesiasticall matters, and then that godly princes may at this day do all the same: And feare ye not but we will also graunt to you, and not starte therefrom, that they may reforme religion and directe ecclesiasticall matters in such sort as Iosaphat did.
And so, excepte ye be disposed to quarell, or will falsefie the sorte and manner of Iosaphats or the Quenes Highnesse doings, trust we shall anon agree herein.
They may do it (say you) in such sort as Iosaphat did, that is, to reforme religion by the priests.
First this is very subtilly spoken master Stapleton (by the priests) if ye meane by the aduise or godly counsell of the prestes, true it is, so might king Iosaphat well haue done.
If ye meane by the authoritie and commaundemente of the priestes, then is it false, nor you can euer proue that Iosaphat did it by theyr commaundement and authoritie, but they contrarywise by his.
Nowe in suche sort as Iosaphat did, hath the Quéenes Maiestie done, and this proueth bothe their supremacies herein.
Not to enact (say you) a new religion, which the priestes of force shall sweare vnto.
Indéede this did not Iosaphat, no more hath the Quéenes Maiestie done, it is but your surmised sclander.
Item to suffer the priests to iudge in controuersies of religion, not to make the decision of suche things a parliamente matter.
This latter parte of your sentence, is agayne but youre manifest sclander, to suffer the priestes to iudge in controuersies of religion after the rule of Gods word, and not after their owne pleasures, in suche sorte Iosaphat not onely suffred, but ordeyned them, commanded and ouersaw them so to do: and so doth the Quéenes maiestie.
And this sufferance, commaundement and ouersight, argueth their chiefe authorities.
Item not to prescribe a newe forme order in ecclesiasticall causes, but to see that according to the lawes of the church before made, the religion be set forthe, as Iosaphat procued the obseruation of the old religion appointed in the lawe of Moyses.
And euen thus and none otherwise hath the Quéenes Maiestie procured the obseruation of the old religion of Iesus Christ whome Moyses prefigured, and the orders of the apostles, and most auncient fathers after them, to be restored: remouing, as Iosaphat did, all other newe formes and orders of ecclesiasticall abuses.
And this restoring and procuring of the aunciente religion and ceremonies, the suppressing and abolishing of new: is againe in both these princes a good argument of their supreme gouernement.
Briefly (say you) that he do all this as an aduocate, defender and son of the Churche, with the authoritie and aduice of the cleargie, so Iosaphat furdered religion, not otherwise.
Your word aduocate how it came vp, is declared already, but neither aduocate, defender, sonne or daughter herein, are any thing contrary to supreme gouernour.
But where ye adde al these words, aduocate, defender, and sonne, to the prince: and to the cleargy authoritie aduice: this sheweth your subtile deuise, to deceyue princes with youre paynted termes.
But princes begin to waxe wise and learned, as Dauid exhorted them, and perceaue howe ye haue foaded them with these names and stiles, that were but nomen sine re, a bare name without any matter: for, the authoritie and aduice ye reserued to your selues.
The princes to whome ye gaue these gay titles, had neither authoritie, nor might giue their aduice, according as Hosius woulde not haue them so much as to talke of matters of religion, much lesse to reforme religion, to directe ecclesiasticall matters with care and diligence as before ye graunted.
And nowe to eate againe your worde, ye woulde haue them be carefull and diligent without aduice, reforme and direct without authoritie, of their owne, except onely the clergies aduice and authoritie.
Thinke ye Iosaphat did so, not otherwise as ye say ye may well tell vs so but the Scripture telleth vs otherwise: howe he gaue aduice to the Clergie, and by his authoritie directed them, though denie not he might vse their aduice, and admitte their authoritie to, yet the supreme authoritie apperteyned vnto him.
Not (say you) as a supreme absolute gouernour, contrary to the vniforme consent of the whole clergie in full conuocation, yea and of all the Bishops at once.
This worde absolute, is but your absolute and malicious slaunder M. Stap.
Such absolute supreme gouernment did your Pope vsurpe, as sayth Franciscus de Ripa, that the Popes power is absolute and that he may do what he will.
As Baldus in the proheme of the decrées alleageth, that his power is absolute from all bondes, and from all rule of restraint.
And that we must beléeue him absolutely as Marcus Mantua and Pope Boniface himselfe affirmeth.
Thus doth not the Quéenes maiestie, no more did king Iosaphat, and therefore inferre the conclusion that the Queenes Maiestie doth all these things, in such sort as losaphat did them, excepting these quarelous slaunders which are your owne, put them vp in your purse agayne master Stapleton, and then shall ye finde the sort and manner of the doings, of the one Prince and the other alike: and so conclude with your owne conclusion.
he vsing the same supreme gouernment then, that the Quéenes Maiestie now doth: nor ye can alleage any thing to the contrary but certaine manifest slaunders.
Whervpon it followeth that the Q. taketh none other authoritie vpo~ hir than Iosaphat did, and all godly Christian Princes ought to doe the like, the one ensample fitting the other euen as your selfe confesse.
Now that M. St. by this most cleare confession graunt, hath yelded so farre in this example that he hath contraried not only M. Dor yt denied it to be a fit example, fro~ Kings in the old law to kings in the new: but contrary also to himself that denied before any example at al to be fit, telling vs that legibu non exemplis iud atur, Men must iudge by lawes and not by examples.
And here he sayth that this example fits well christian princes, thereon hath concluded already the full matter in question: neither can find any thing in the Q. maiestyes doings swaruing from Iosaphats, but certain of his owne mere slau~ders: he startleth, and besturreth himself with euery tristing quarrell, picking fault at tra~slations, at the print of the letter, such like things to occupie the readers head withall, least he should perceiue marke, how the weight pith of the matter is alredy graunted and concluded, by his owne mouth confession.
And here he chalengeth ye B. with wretched shameful bandling of the holy scriptures.
This is a sore fault indéed if it were true, but how proueth he this? First promising verye sadly in his preface (sayth he) to cause his authors sentences for the part to be printed in latine letters, here coursing ouer three seuerall chapters of the
he setteth not downe any one part or worde of the whole text in any latine or distinct letter, but handleth the scriptures as pleaseth himselfe, translating, mangling and belying them beyond all shame.
For the translation we shall sée afterward St. what you chalenge therin, in the mean season, we may well sée how hard it goeth with you in yt ye are faine to séeke such brabling matters as this, which is but a petit quarel, and that false also.
The Bishop euen as your selfe confesse, did but course ouer, that is, did but touche the summe effect of those matters, not set out word by word the text, as he hath not chau~ged the letter hitherto in ye like doing, ye find no fault there with.
Neither did the B. bind him selfe in translating, to euery worde, but so to set out their minds se~te~ces, which word minds, ye haue left out, also for these words (for the most part) ye haue put in, for the part.
Thus do ye order the Bishops sentence in setting it foorth in a distincte letter, as though he had so said, which in déede is the part of wretched and shamefull handling and belying beyond all shame, especially to vpbrayde it to another, to shewe the more impude~cie of your selfe therin.
As for the Bishop only shewing the effect of the matter, and not the words, nor going about there to translate at al, it was lawfull for him to vse his common print, his promise still obserued when he translated any thing.
You youre selfe vse this commonly in translating, not onely to kéepe your ordinarie forme of letter, but therby, to ha~dle the scrip ture as it pleaseth you.
But now in this the Bishops summarie draught out of all those three aforesayde chapters, let vs sée what it is that ye chalenge him for so sore.
He telleth vs (say you) of the kings visitours, of a progresse made in his owne person, through out all his countrey, and of Iustices of the peace, whereas the texts alleaged haue no such words at all.
It is easie to sée howe enuy or proud follie blindeth thys ma~, that reprehendeth the Bishop as missetelling the effect of a sentence, and him selfe in distincte letter, going about to set out the Bishops words, as he did before, cannot or will not repeate the same aright, were these the bishops words, kings visitors Iustices of the peace· the bishops words wer these, He se~t forth through his kingdom visitors, again, he appointed in euery towne through out his kingdome as it were Iustices of the peace.
it is so in effecte master Stapl. and so they were the kings visitours.
But yet should you here tell the bare wordes that the Bishoppe alleaged, and if you may be blamelesse in saying you tell the effect summe of the sentence, may not then the same saying bishop also? and a gret deale more, bicause (as ye say) he did but course ouer three chapters briefly, and therefore coulde not easily expresse the bare texts.
But you might easily (noting but two or thrée little sentences) haue set them downe playne.
Ye say ye bishop telleth of Iustices of the peace.
The bishop only said, as it were iustices of the peace, as who should say, suche officers then, as a man might liken to our petit iudges, or iustices of the peace now.
But thus ye euer loue to wrest the Byshops words, that ye may make the feater entrance into one of your common places, saying: Verily suche a tale he telleth vs, that his ridiculous dealing herein were it not in Gods cause (where the indignitie of his demeanour is to be detested) were worthily to be laughed at.
Are the stories of the Scripture become tales to this Louanist? are the visitations and progresse of this godly king, that right nowe was with him a fitte ensample for christian princes, become now ridiculous dealing, and worthily to be laughed at, or indignities to be detested? suche were in déede the Popishe visitations.
As for that the byshop citeth is manyfest in the scripture.
The king sent out his Princes and preachers, as the summe of the chapter in your olde translation sayth, mittit praedicatores per vniuersam Iudeam, he sendeth ont preachers throughout all Iewry: Whervpon Lyra noteth, hic ostenditur qualiter populum suum instruxit, scilicet per sacerdotes Leuitas quos ad hoc misit cum eis aliquot de principibus suis, vt populum inducerent ad obedientiam punirent rebelles si quos inuenirent.
Heere is declared how he instructed his people, to wite, by the Priests and Leuites, whom he sent to this purpose, and with the~ certaine of his Princes to moue the people to obedience, and to punish the rebellious, if they should finde any.
Is it ridiculous or detestable dealing herein, to name these parties visitours sent from the king? were they not sent to him to visite ye people reforme the~ in religion? Againe the bishop said, he made a progresse in his owne person, throughout al his cou~trey.
What fault find ye herewith, that he called it a progresse? call you it an egresse, or by what ye can finde a more vsuall or itter name, where the prince him selfe doth trauell.
The text is, egressus est ad populu~, and again he went foorth vnto the people.
Stande ye on that he said it was in his owne person? In déede Lyra saith, per sacerdotes Leuit as sicu ante ficara, He went foorth by the Priests Leuites, as he had done before.
But the text séemeth co~trary, that he traueled him selfe.
Wheron Uatablus noteth, vt ambularet per populu~ fortasse que~ offenderat alo exe~pl, vel per populu~ cut praerat, quasi dicat peagrauit regione~ sibi subditam.
That he might trauel by the people who~ perhaps he had offended by his euill exa~ple (for personally he went out with them to Achabs warres) or by the people who~ he ruled, as though he should say, he trauelled all ouer the realme that was subiect to him.
Are ye offended that he sayth throughout al his countrey.
The text is playne De Bersabe vs{que} ad monte~ Ephraim, from Beersabee, euen to the mount Ephraim.
Id est (sayth Lyra) principio regni sui vs{que} ad finem, that is, from the beginning of his kingdome, euen to the end therof.
Of which progresse in the note before, sayth Lyra, Hie consequenter ponitur ipsius Iosaphat eme~datio in se populo, primo in cultu diuino.
Here consequently is set foorth the amendment of Iosaphat in him selfe, and in the people, and first in the worship of God.
In none of these words hitherto there is any indignitie, nothing to be detested or any ridiculous tale to be laughed at, but euery word is agreable to the most graue, holy and infallible worde of God.
If there were therfore any such leuitie detestablenesse in ye bishops termes, it is only in this, that he likened those parties to iustices of the peace.
But this name am sure is neither to be detested nor laughed at, except you be some od wicked Lucian or Timon all godly christians can allowe this name with reuerence.
Is the ridiculcusnesse detestablenesse, in saying the one might resemble the other? reade the text.
Constituit{que} Iudices terrae in cunctis ciuitatibus Iuda munitis per singula loca, and he appointed Iudges of the land in all the walled cities of Iuda through all places.
Now could a man expresse this by a liuelyer example, than to say those petit iudges were, as it were Iustices of the peace, if you can shewe a more apter estate to expresse them by, do it on Gods name.
dare say for the Byshop, he will giue you good leaue, though ye somewhat missed the quishion, make no such haynous matter therat.
Lyra sayth, Hic secundo describitur ipsius Iosaphat populi melioratio in regimine populi, primo in communibus causis, secundo in arduis, in quibus erat recursus in Hierusalem.
Circa primum dicitur, constituit{que} Iudices, vt non oporteat populum discurrere loca ad locum, ad habendum in causis communibus.
Heere secondly is described the bettering of Iosaphat him selfe, and his people, in the gouernance of the people, first in common causes, secondly in difficulte causes, wherein the recourse was vnto Hierusalem.
Concerning the firste it is sayde, and he appoynted Iudges to be had in the common matters that the people shoulde not runne vp and downe from place to place.
And is not this exposition of Lyra so agreable to the Byshops, that it conteyneth euen the same? what cause then had ye héere, Master Stapl. to make this haynous exclamation? Were not this youre dealing rather ridiculous, and to be laughed at, sauyng that the indignitie of your enuious demeanour is more to be detested? But nowe in the matter, of all this what is héere, that directly inferreth not Iosaphats supreme gouernement, not onely ouer the nobles and the people, but ouer the Priests, Leuites, preachers, al the clergy, in directing and setting foorth the word worship of God, that not only in co~mo~ matters, but eue~ for those matters also of the priests sente~ce at Ierusalem, for the which hitherto ye haue made so muche ado? but all this, M. Stap. though he saw it plaine inough, yet he thought best not to meddle therwith.
But rather (least the reader shoulde marke it also) to finde him play about the printing of words and phrases, and here at to hallow and make suche outcries, as though all the matter lay therein.
Yea he bursteth out into such a vehemencie of his spirite, that not contente with his former haynous quarels, he layeth yet greater to the Byshops charge, saying: But from fonde counterfayting he proceedeth to flat lying, for where he sayth that Iosaphat commanded and prescribed vnto the chiefe Priests what fourme and order they should obserue in the ecclesiasticall causes and controuersies of religion.
This is a lewde and a horrible lye, flatly belying Gods holy worde, the which in one that goeth for a Byshop, what can be done more abhominable? In déede, M. Stapl.
it were an abhominable thing to belye Gods holy worde, were it in any man, chiefly in a Byshop: but this abhomination, besides many worsse, not only lewdly, flatly, horribly to belie, but to deface blaspheme, yea to take away and burne Gods holy worde, are the right properties of your Popish Bishops, not of ours.
But what hath the Bishop nowe héere saide that belyeth and accordeth not with the holy scripture? for, the wordes which you your selfe set foorth, do they not playnly comprehende a fourme and order which they should obserue in ecclesiasticall matters and controuersies of religion? Sic agetis &c.
Thus shall ye do in the feare of the Lorde, faythfully and with a perfect heart.
They should do their duetie faythfully and perfectly, as they had done before in the dayes of Asa and Abias.
Lo, do not your owne selfe héere confesse a maner and fourme of order, which be prescribed them to do those things by? Agayne are not these your owne words, howe Iosaphat appoynted the Leuites and priestes to these ecclesiasticall functions, it shal appeare in the next Chapter by the example of Ezechias? Where ye say, howe he did it: had that how, no maner or fourme of order in it? Yes, but ye say, that maner of fourme shall appeare in the example of Ezechias.
Gods name so let it doe in the meane season, ye graunt he did it after the fourme of order that Ezechias dyd it.
And there ye say that Ezechias did it as Dauid did it.
But ye wotte well the Scripture sheweth at large the fourmes and orders of Dauids appoyntments: if therefore Ezechias did it like to Dauid, and Iosaphat like to Ezechias, then is the bishops saying proued true, by all these your confessions, that he commaunded and prescribed vnto the chiefe priests what fourme and order they should obserue in ecclesiasticall causes and controuersies of religion.
Is not this then your own abhomination and contradiction, atly to say, here is no fourme or order prescribed? and that the Bishop belieth Gods holy woorde which in one that goeth for a student of Diuinitie, to sclaunder one that goeth for a Bishop, what can be done more malapertly? But as ye thus sawfely misuse your better, so full fondly and malitionsly, do gather that thereon, then the which the Bishop minded nothing lesse, nor can instly be gathered thereupon.
say the Bishop writeth thus to make folke weene that religion proceded then by way of commission from the Prince onely.
This is your owne spitefull sclander M. Stapl. not onely on the Bishop but on the Quéenes Maiestie, your argument is this.
He prescribed them a fourme and order to obserue in co~trouersies of Religion.
Ergo, He attempted to make Religion proceede by way of commission from the Prince onely.
from the fourme and order of athing, to the thing it selfe.
It is your holy father the Pope to whom ye may obiect this conclusion, he maeth religion to depende on him and to proceede from him onely· by his Commissions and Legacies latere.
all true religion to procéede onely from God the father, through Iesus Christ his sonne, by the insctio~ of the holy ghost in the mouth of the Patriarches, Prophets, and Apostles.
And from the Prince to procéede, onely such godly orders, and formes of directing, and setting foorth that true religion, as he by the notable examples of these godly Kinges, shall finde out paterns most expedient for him and his people, to gouerne and order them of what state soeuer they be, in that true religion, and all other ecclesiastical causes belonging thereto.
So did Iosaphat then, so doth the Quéenes Maiestie now.
Fro~ whose authoritie, next nder· God, the order direction procéeded, though the religio~ procéeded not from them, but altogither from God.
Nay (say you) king· Iosaphats dealings were rather with perso thn with matters ecclesiasticall.
This was M. Fecke~hams former shifte, and many proper ensamples and similitudes you also vsed thereon, to dally about the of the ecclesiasticall person, but not in ecclesiastical matters.
But those were but séely shifts, and euer turned against your selfe in the ende.
And therefore ye dar not abide by this shifte, but within a litle while after, yea euen in this Chapter, ye recant and denie the obedience of the persons and all.
And what hath bene your practise, any other than cleane to ridde your selues out of al obedience from the Princes authoritie? ye knowe your Pope hath bene vnder the Emperour ere now, but vnder what Princes obedience euen for his person will ye confesse your Pope at this day to be? And do not all the packe of the popishe Priestes, as his chickens clcke vnder his winges, and exempt euen their persons also from the dutifull obedience they owe to their naturall soueraignes, in so much that where the Popes primacie is admitted, Princes can not by any of their lawe· fasten any condigne punishement, vppon any ecclesiasticall persons· what mischiefe soeuer they committe? and all bicause the ecclesiasticall persons were priuileged and exempted from their Princes authoritie.
Wherein your generation dealt surely for themselues, that hauing graunted them an inche got an elle.
For, seing, that if they should graunt againe the obedience of the person, the cause and all would at last returne to his old master the Prince, as it did before, but you thinke your selfe sure inough, if ye graunt that Iosaphat dealed with ecclesiasticall persons, but not with their matters.
As ye shifted of the matter before, that the Prince dealeth with a Bishop for his homage, baronie and temporalties, but not otherwise.
Thinke ye M. Stapl. and tell me on your fidelitie, did Iosaphat meddle with the high Priestes, and all other of the Clergie so well as his temporaltie, onely in respecte of their persons, or in respecte of their reuenues and linings vnder him, or chiefly in any of these respectes did he thus commaunde them and deale with them: or not rather and most of all in respect of refourming abuses in religion, and setting in order all ecclesiasticall causes? he appointed not onely the persons but the places where the persons shoulde execute their offices, and what matters these and those persons shoulde entreate vppon, and how they shoulde do them, as your selfe haue confessed the manner.
And least we should thinke he ubbered ouer the matter, as ye say, many good and godly princes among the Christians also haue charged their Bishops and clergie to see diligently vnto their flockes and charges.
Ye say true M. Stapleton, many godly Princes haue thus done to your further confutation in this issue.
But you meane they haue onely giuen them a generall exhortation, and yet neuerthelesse lefte the matter wholly in their Clergies hands, not medling themselues therewith: Least ye should thinke that Iosaphat did it thus sclenderly, not that his chiefe charge of ouersight lay thereon, not onely of them all generally, but particulerly in euery kinde of matter: the holy ghost hath penned out, how precisely he went to worke, that rather hauing his care about the matters, then the persons.
For this was his principal marke care, not so much that the person might sit in authoritie, as that the matter might wisely and truly be iudged and discerned, and therfore saith the text.
In Hierusalem quoque constituit Iosaphat Leuitas, sacerdotes, principes familiaru~ ex Israel, vt iudicium causam domini Iudicarent habitatoribus eius, &c. Praecepitque eis, &c.
And Iosaphat appointed in Ierusalem Leuites and Priests and families of Israell, that they might giue iudgement and iudge the cause of the Lorde to the inhabitants thereof, &c.
And he co~maunded them saying: Thus shall ye do in the feare of the Lord faithfully, and with a perfecte harte, and in euery cause that shall come vnto you of your brethren that dwell in their Cities, betweene bloud and bloud, betweene lawe and precepte, statutes and iudgements, ye shall iudge them and admonish them. &c. Whervpon saith Lyra: Hic ordinatur regime populi in arduis causis, &c. Here is ordeyned the gouernment of the people in difficult causes, which could not well be cutte of, without recourse had to Ierusalem, according to that which is co~maunded, Deuter.
Where it is saide, if thou shalt perceyue the iudgement before thee to be difficult and doubtfull, arise and get thee vp to the place which the Lord shall choose.
And therefore Iosaphat appointed iudges there, to determine such difficult matters.
Wherefore it followeth, euery cause which commeth vnto you, &c. VVheresoeuer the question is: if it be of the lawe, so farre forth as pertaineth to the ten comma~dements of the tables.
If it be of the commaundement, so farre forth as pertaineth to the other moral points: if it be of the precepts of the ten commandements, as it were certaine conclusions piked out: if it be of the ceremonies, so farre forth as pertayneth to ceremoniall matters: of iustifications, that is to say of iudiciall matters whereby iustice is to be conserued among men.
Thus is there no parte ecclesiasticall or temporall, exempted from the ouersight, care, directio~ appointment of the king.
No not the iudgement that ye haue so often alleaged and craked vppon out of the Deut.
vnder the which (as a generall rule for all examples to be ruled by) ye would subdue the Prince vpon paine of death, to obey the absolute determination of the Priest.
Euen this same office and all other, with all causes to them belonging, (so farre as stretcheth to the ouersight and supreme gouernment) do belong, to the Prince, to appoint and ordeyne fitte parties, to displace and remoue vnfitte parties, to sée al these offices, so well as any other temporall, obserued kept and executed dutifully.
Which is not so much for the persons, as for the persons offices.
And therefore Iosaphat not only appointed them by his authoritie or regiment as Lyra saith, their offices: but also he told the~ how they should do their offices.
Nay say you, to each your matter yet with an other shift, He doth it not with threates of his highe displeasure, or by force of his owne iniunctions, but onely saith: so then doing you shall not sinne or offende.
The which very manner of speache, christian Emperours and Kinges haue eftones vsed in the like case, as we shall hereafter in the thirde booke by examples declare.
Euen in the examples that ye shall there declare M. St. ye shall finde both threates of high displeasures and the ininctions also of many godly princes.
And therefore seing that ye co~pare their doings alike, why say you these doings of Iehosophat haue no threates nor iniunctions? what call ye this, did he not threate them trowe you, when he saide, Ne veniat tra super vos super fratres vestros, Least wrath come vppon you and vppon your bretheren.
He denou~ced vnto them the wrath of God, which declared his great zeale and care of Gods matters as the Bishop saide.
And thinke you that the high displeasure of God, conteyned not this godly Princes high displeasure also? do ye suppose that they drad not the Princes high displeasure in the breache of their dueties, bicause he threateth them with Gods moste high displeasure? Or thinke ye it was not so forcible as any iniu~ctio~ of his vnto them, in that (as your selfe say) he charged them, and (as the text saithe) Praecepit eis, he commaunded them? which is most plaine and euident to signifie, that he enioygned them by his supreme gouernment ouer them? And to shew that besides his charge, his commaundement, his threate of Gods most high displeasure, they should incurre his high displeasure also, if they or any other disobeyed: Lyra saithe on his former visitation, Hic oftenditur qualiter &c. Here is declared after what sorte he instructed his people, to wite, by the Priestes and Leuites, whom he sent to this purpose, and with them certaine of his Princes, to bring the people to obedience, and to punish the rebelles, if they should finde any.
And of this visitation also saith Lyra: He appointed Zabadias to be ouer those workes that belong to the Kinges office, that if any rebelles were found they should by him be chastized with due punishme~t.
Doth not this import the Kinges highe displeasure, in the breach of these his appointments, charge co~maundment, when he adioyned those that should punish the disobedient? Now whereas the Bishop briefly noted all this, how King Iosaphat appointed the Priestes to decide and iudge controuersies: you snatch thereat, and clappe downe thereon a marginall note.
Yea the Priestes iudged, not the king, say you, ouerskipping that the King appointed them thereto, which argueth his supreme gouernment.
And yet the King iudged also by his deputie, not the Priest alone.
And so saith plaine the texte: In Hierusalem quoque constituit &c.
And Iosaphat appointed also Leuites and Priestes, and the Princes of the families of Israel: Here M. St. he appointed as well the lay Princes, as the Priests.
And wherto? vt Iudicium causam domini iudicarent, that they should iudge the iudgement and cause of the Lorde.
Sée how plaine this is against you: but what is there not, that ye will spare to wrest, to make it sée me to serue your turne? For eue~ of the last sentence, ye thinke in the ende ye haue gotten so notable a proufe for your matter: that greatly ye vrge it and wonderfully triumph therevppon.
Amarias the priest and your Bishop, shall haue the gouernment of such things as appertaine to God.
And Zabadias shalbe ouer such workes as appertaine to the kinges office.
Lo (say you) the kings office and diuine matters are of distinct functions.
Lo say I, how sone ye would co~clude a lie.
Your text saith not, the kings office and diuine matters are of distinct functions.
Nor maketh any opposition or distinction betwene the kings office and diuine matters, as though it appertained not to the kings office, to haue any thing to do with diuine matters.
Contrary to the which, your own co~fession euen in this kings doings, witnesseth against you, that he reformed religion, and had a care and diligence about the directing ecclesiasticall matters.
And trow you he did this beyond the bou~des of his office? How can then his example, as ye say, fitte well christian princes, if it be not a parcell belonging to their office? the text is plaine that the king appointeth as wel the Bishop Amarias his gouernme~t, as Zabadias his gouernme~t: to the one, to haue the gouernme~t of such things as appertaine to God: to the other, to be ouer such workes as appertaine to the king.
Here in these two, (such things) on the one partie, and (such workes) on the other partie, is the distinction made: and not betwene the kings office, and diuine matters, as you falsely conclude.
And yet pray you what argument can ye gather herevppon? The kings office diuine matters are of distinct functio~s: Ergo the King hath no supreme gouernment ouer all ecclesiasticall causes.
By the like reason he hath no supreme gouernment ouer temporall causes neither.
For, the kinge office his temporall subiects matters, are not they also distinct functione? Ergo, the king hath no supreme gouernme~t ouer his temporall subiects matters.
Againe ye reason thus: Thus saith the king, the priest shall gouerne in those things that belong to God.
Ergo, to ouersee the Priests, gouerne them rightly, appertayneth not to the kinges gouernment.
Where in deede you should rather reason the quite contrarie.
Thus saith the king, the priest and the Bishop shal haue the gouernment of such things as appertaine to God.
Ergo, the Prince that thus appointeth him thereto, hath an other supreme gouernment of appointing and ouerseing euen the priests gouernment.
Doth not the King appoint the one to his office, so well as he appointed the other, are not both gouerned in their offices vnder him? Yet say you, ouer gods matters is the priest, not as the kings commissioner, but as the priests were after the example of Moses.
The Bishop refuseth not the example of Moses, but alleaged euen the same, and your selfe then refused that example: saying, he had such prerogatiues, that he of all other could not be alleaged for exa~ple, bicause of his especial priuilege.
And now contrary to your former sayings, you say, the priests were not as the Kings co~missioners, but were alwaies after the example of Moses.
But go to, be it so, how doth this helpe your matter, or not rather quite confute it? In Moses time Aaron, and after him Eleazar were the chiefe priestes ouer gods matters, vnder whome were the other Priestes and Leuites.
But all of them, yea Aaron and Eleazar, so wel as the rest, were vnder the supreme gouernement, in ecclesiasticall causes so well as temporall, of their Prince and ruler Moses.
Ergo, If Moses be an example how the priestes should alwayes gouerne vnder Gods matters, then muste their gouernment be alwayes vnder the princes supreme gouernment, to ouersée, order and direct them as Moses did.
And where ye say, the Priest here, was not the Princes commissioner in these matters, the very text is most playn to the contrarie.
stande not on the worde, least should minister to you occasion of wrangling with me, as ye do with the byshop: but goe to the matter.
What call ye him that the Prince sendeth foorth in a commission, committing a charge vnto him, call ye him not a commissioner? and his commissioner that so sendeth him in commission? did not Iosaphat so sende about his priestes and Leuites on this commission, that they shoulde teache and set foorth euery where the worde of God? Tertio ann regni sui misit, &c. in the thirde yere of his raigne, he sent out certayne of hys princes, Benail, and Obdias, and Zacharias, and Nathaniel, and Micheas, that they should teache in the cities of Iuda: and with them the Leuites, Semeiah, Nethamah, Zebediah, and Asahel, and Semiramoth, and Ionathas, and Adonias, and Thobias, and Tob Adoniah Leuites: and with them Elizama and Ioram Priests.
And they taught the people in Iuda, hauing with them the booke of the lawe of the Lord: and they went about throughout all the cities of Iuda, and taught the people.
Were they not héere sent in this commission thus to do, fro~ the king? Their doctrine was not the kings, but Gods commission, the Lords booke: but this their maner of traueling in setting it foorth, was the kings commission.
And they, so wel the Priests and Leuites, as the Princes, were bothe of them the kings commissioners.
In lyke case, the Quéenes maiesty sendeth out hir godly learned commissioners, sendeth by them the worde of God, Gods booke and truthe to be set foorth.
The truth thus set foorth, hath not his authoritie from hir co~mission, nor the preachers to preach, only by hir outward commission? but they haue another inward co~mission from God, and are Gods commissioners by the calling ministerie of their office.
Howbeit, in this outward maner of visitation setting it foorth, in this sorte of traueling about hir highnesse townes and cities, reforming abuses, directing all eccl. causes: they are therin euen aswell the Quéenes co~missioners, as those priests Leuites in al their reformatio~ of religion, were co~missioners from king Iosaphat.
And thus euery thing in the ende is moste euident agaynst you.
But yet ye blunder still on in your owne conceite, and thinke ye haue héere gotten a wonderfull strong argument.
And marke well M. Horne, this poynt (say you) Zabadias is set ouer suche workes as belong to the kinges office.
But suche workes are no maner thing perteyning to the seruice of God (for ouer them Amarias the Priest is President) Ergo, the kinges office consisteth not about thinges perteyning to God, but is a distinct function concerning the common weale.
Ergo, if the king intermeddle in Gods matters, especially if he take vpon him the supreme gouernement thereof, euen ouer the priests the~ selues, to whom the charge is committed, he passeth the bou~des of his office: he breaketh the order appoynted by God, and is become an open enemie to Gods holy ordinance.
Your crakes and reuilings that ye powder your argument with, remitte to their proper common places, to the argument aunswere.
If it be marked well, as ye would haue it, saying, Marke well this poynte M. Horne: First, the marker shall finde it neither in any moode nor figure.
Secondly, the marker shall finde an Equiuocation in these words, workes, kinges office, pertayning to Gods seruice.
Which words béeing diuerfly vnderstoode in either proposition: Thirdly, make a paralogisme of foure termes.
Fourthly, in these words ye make a Fallation a secundum quid ad simpliciter.
Lyra liuiteth thee words, super ea operaerit quae ad regis officium pertinent.
He shall be ouer those workes that perteyne to the kings office: onely to the ayding and strengthening the Priests and the Leuites, by the temporall sworde, to punishe the disobediente.
But is there no other works of the Kings office besides this? Uatablus vnder standeth it, that as the priest medled with the weightie causes at Ierusalem: so also the Leuites shoulde be ouer the lesser causes, Causae Ciutu~ cognoscebontur Leuitis, causaeaute~ Regtae Zabaudi.
The causes or controuersies perteyning to the citizens, should be herd of the Leuites, and the causes and controuersies perteyning to the King, should be herd of Zabaudias.
Neither of these vnderstande these words so generally, of al the doings belonging in any wise to the office of a king.
In lyke case, for the priestes gouernment, in suche thinges as belong to God, Id est (sayth Uatablus) quod pertinet ad rem diuinam: To wite, so farre as perteyneth to the diuine seruice, or the dyuine administration.
And you wrest it to be vnderstoode simply for all ecclesiasticall matters, and all causes of religion.
Besides that Fifthly, ye reason styll after youre wonted fashion, from the distinction of the thynges and vvorkes of eithers perticuler functions, to the taking away of the Princes supreme gouernement ouer those distincte workes and functions.
Howe dothe this argument followe? The king appoyntes one ouer Gods workes, and another distinct from him ouer his owne workes: Ergo, the king hath not a supreme gouernement ouer them both, to ouersée the~ to do those works.
Your conclusions therfore last of all are faultie, neither directly following vpon your premisses, and comprehending much more then they inferre.
This part of your conclusion, that the kings office is a distinct function from the Priests, neither impugneth the byshops assertion, nor the princes supreme gouernement.
Conclude this M. Stap. agaynst them that confounde their offices.
The other parte of your conclusion, that the kinges office medleth onely with the common weale, by which ye meane, onely the ciuill policie, and hath nothing to do with any matters perteyning to God: or euer ye shall directly proue it, on this, or any other place in the whole scripture, it will finde ye somewhat more to do than ye suppose it will.
As for the kinges intermedling with Gods matters: your selfe before haue graunted a king may intermedle and be no breaker, nor enimie to Gods order.
And that euen this king Iosaphat vsed a care and diligence about the directing of ecclesiasticall matters, that he reformed religion, and that godly christian Princes may at this day do the lyke.
And is all this no intermedling? dothe it not rather proue he intermedled, that as supreme gouernour thereof, yea euen ouer the Priestes them selues, to whome that charge (of doing those matters) is committed? and yet he neither breaketh the order appoynted by God, nor is become an enimie to Gods holy ordinance.
Ye say, it was Gods ordinance and appoyntment, what followeth? it was not therefore the Princes ordinance and appoyntment also? as though these were contrary, and coulde not stande togither the one vnder the other, the ordinance of God, and the ordinance of the king.
Put case the Priest had ordeined it, might it not haue béene Gods ordinance too? but the priest ordeined it not, but the prince: Ergo, the Prince immediatly ordeyning it vnder God, sheweth that he hath an immediate power vnder him, euen aboue the Priests.
Of whome are these words so precisely spoken, he appoynted, he commaunded, he sayde it shall be so, thus shall ye do, &c? was it the Prince, or was it the Priest? Did Amarias commaunde Iehosaphat, or Iehosaphat commaunde Amarias, and all the other Priestes and Leuites? who is the supreme gouernour of the twaine, the commaunder and appointer, or he that is commaunded and appoynted? Untill therefore that ye can proue, that the high Priest Amarias, commaunded and appoynted vnto King Iosaphat these things, and that the king did not commaund, nor appoynt these things to the Priest and Bishop: euerie man that hath any vnderstanding, will easily perceyue and iudge, that the Prince was the Priestes supreme gouernour next vnder God, both ouer his person, and ouer the thing also wherein he appoynted and commaunded him.
But, sée your constant dealing in this matter· before, you made the gouernance of the thing to be more than the gouernance of the person.
And here as though it were a greater matter to gouerne the person, you say: If he take vpon him the supreme gouernment thereof euen ouer the Priests themselues, to whom the charge is committed: Againe, before you sayde, that Iosaphats dealings were rather with persons than with matters ecclesiasticall: But now ye exempt the persons to, saying: If he take vpon him the supreme gouernment euen ouer the Priests themselues, &c. he passeth the boundes of his office.
And thus, although for a while ye would shift off the matter by séeming to graunt somwhat, to bleare the reader withall: yet in the ende contrary to your former graunt, ye eae your worde, and debarre the Prince of all, both for matter and persons to.
But (thankes be to God) this insample of Iosaphat is so plaine, that all these fetches and shiftes that ye are dryuen vnto, can so little any way improue his supreme gouernment: that euery thing which ye bring agaynst it, maketh more and more for it.
Such is the force of the truth, and so doth falsehoode in his owne trippe still ouerturne it selfe.
THe Bishop alleaging the example of king Ezechias, fist sheweth what great commendation, for his godly gouernment in reforming religion, the scripture attributeth vnto him.
Secondly, how he called togither the clergie, telleth them their faults, declareth to them the wrath of God, exhorteth commaundeth them to do their dueties in clensing themselues, in making their sacrifices, and appointeth their offices, prouideth them conuenient portions to liue by, and that in all things the clergie and the people obeyed the Kings commaundement, which argueth his supreme gouernment ouer all ecclesiasticall persons and causes.
To this master Stapleton aunswereth, first on the olde warrant of his good masters wordes, by reiecting all this as insufficient.
Here is nothing brought in by you (sayth he) or before by the Apologie (as M. Dorman and M. D. Harding do well aunswere) that forceth the surmised soueraigntie in King Ezechias, but that his power and authoritie was readie and seruiceable (as it ought to be in all prynces) for the execution of things spirituall before determined, not by him as supreme head newly established.
How well or yll master Stap. your masters haue aunswered this obiection, and are aunswered againe, is apparant and easie to be iudged by viewing both their answeres.
Howbeit, vnto their wel doings, for feare they should not fal out so well as ye pretend: you haue done well also to better their answeres, with the surplusage of your new stuffe.
And if it were graunted you M. Stap. that those things which Ezechias did, had not bene, by him as supreme heade, newly established, would it folow therevpon, that they were not by him, as supreme head or gouernour, newly reformed neyther: hauing bene some of them of olde established before, by the priests negligence, hauing long time bene corrupted? But what letteth why they may not also be sayde, to haue bene by him newly established, being quite decayed before? And so sayth Lyra of the ioy at the great passeouer that long time had ceassed, Propter quod, quado Ezechias eam renouaeuit, fuit maior exultatio, quòd noua placent delectant.
For the which cause, whe~ Ezechias renued it, there was greater reioising, for bicause new things do please and delight.
But was the brasen serpent pulled downe and destroyed euer before, as other Images and hill aulters had béene? was the feast of the passeouer euer chaunged before? was that order of collations euer ordeyned before? was this the Leuites doings of the Priests partes, euer done before? So that at the least some of these doings were by him newly established and neuer done before: but as the necessitie of the time was then, so were they commaunded to be done by him and well allowed of God.
Yet, say you, they were not newly established by him as supreme hed, but his power authorite was ready seruiceable for the execution of things spiritual before determined.
But if these things were not before determined, pray you master Stapleton, whose executioner was he then? neither the priests nor the prophets had before determined that he should do, or commaund to be done these things, therfore he was neyther the Priestes nor the Prophets executioner in them.
If ye say, God had determined that they should so be done: ye say true, and we denie not, but that the Princes power and authoritie did execute Gods determination, yea it was readie and seruiceable, as ye say, thereto.
But what conclude you herevppon? Bicause the princes power and authoritie is ready and seruiceable to execute Gods determinate purpose, yea or his open commaundement either, and that by the mouth of any Priest or Prophete: Ergo, he is not supreme gouernour vnder God therein? In déede ye might well conclude he is not an absolute supreme gouernour ouer God, whose determination he doth execute so seruiceably, but this ye might conclude agaynst your Pope, that exalteth him selfe aboue all that is called God, and despiseth to execute seruiceably Gods open determination, and maketh all Princes to bee seruiceable executioners of his own determinations.
Thus doth not the Quéenes Maiestie nor any Godly Prince, but obeyeth and executeth Gods determination, with all hir power and authoritie most readie and seruiceable therevnto, and yet is neyther hir supreme power nor authoritie vnder God, any whitte empayred thereby.
And if this be an argument to abase the Princes supreme power and authoritie, how shall it not also abase the Priests? ought they to doe any other things then execute Gods determinations? ought not their power authoritie be ready and seruiceable herevnto? Ergo· they can be no supreme gouernors neyther.
But ye will say the Prince is yet inferiour to them, bycause they executed Gods commaundement immediately, and the Prince theirs.
What now, if it fall out quite contrary, that Ezechias executed seruiceably Gods commaundement, they againe executed (although their seruice was not ouer readie, such was their corruption, yet tandem, at the length, they executed) the Princes commaundement, doth it not then followe that they were therein inferiour to the Prince? But, that he commaunded and appointed them, and that they executed in these spirituall things his commaundement and appoyntment, the scripture is most apparant.
He brought in the Priestes and gathered them togither in atrium sacerdotum, sayth Lyra, into the porche of the priests.
And therefore sayth Lyra, vnder him was made Primo, expiatio legalis. &c.
He, as a commaunder, sayde vnto the Priestes séeing them sowly deed, Audite me Leuitae sanctificamint. &c. Heare me you Leuites, and be ye sanctified, clense the house of the God of your fathers, and take away all vnciennesse from the sanctuarie.
Which are not wordes of entreatie, but flatte commaundements, as Lyra sayth: Ezechias cupiens renouare foed cum domino, primo pracepit. &c. Ezechias desirous to renew the couenant with the Lorde.
Secondly, by them being sanctified, the temple to be clensed.
Thirdly, by those which were clensed, sacrifice to be made for the offence of the people.
Fiftly, by clensing, the holy burntoffrings to be offred vp.
Thus were all these thinges done by his commaundement, by his constitution, and at his pleasure.
Nunc igitur placet mihi vt foedus cum domino, It is now therefore my pleasure (sayth he) that we enter into a couenant with the Lorde.
And in this doing, euen in the place where he putteth them in minde of their high office, he calleth them not his fathers (which worde hereafter ye stande much vpon) but calleth them, being the Priestes Leuites, his sonnes: Filij me (sayth he) nolite negligere.
my sonnes be not negligent, being him selfe in yeares but a childe in respect of them, of the age of xx. yeares: sauing that in respect of hys royall power and estate, he considered he was the father of all Gods people, so well the clergie as the laitie: and so the clergie tooke him, and obeyed him.
Et ingressi sunt iuxta mandatum regis imperi domini, And they entred in according to the Kings commaundement, and the commaundement of the Lorde.
Iuxta mandatum regis (sayth Lyra) ad purgandum templum domini, To clense the temple of the Lorde, according to the Kings commaundement.
And Lyra praysing all these doings sayth, Et sic Ezechias in coronationis. &c.
And so Ezechias in the day of his coronation, opened the doores of the temple of the Lorde, and euen there gathering the Priestes and the Leuites togither, he enioyned vnto them the sayde purging.
(Lo here is againe the kings owne iniunction, whereat ye quarreled in the former Chapter.)
And on the morrow after, they began it: and in this appeareth the great prayse of Ezechias, that euen foorthwyth from the first day of his coronation, he commaunded the renuing of the diuine worship that was destroied by his father.
Lyra shewing further of the pollution of the temple, telleth out of the Hebrue glosse, that there were many Images of Idolatrie, fastened in the walles of the Temple, with such strong and great nailes that they were hardly pulled away.
liuely patterne of your popish Temples Master Stapleton, decked vp euen so, with Images in the walles: and withall it confuteth your fonde distinction of Image and Idoll, since as well ye may haue Idolatrie of Images as of Idolles.
If ye thinke to escape by distinguishing of the Images of holy Saintes, and the Images of the wicked heathen, that they onely be Idolles, not the other, pray you what was the brasen serpent, was it the Image of any prophane thing? or not rather a representer of Christ, and yet it became an Idoll, and this godly King, not the Priestes destroyed it, and called it in contempt, a péece of brasse, as a man might call your Images or Idolles (whether ye will) a stocke or stone.
Thus did this notable Prince, which tell by the way, not onely to shewe his supreme authoritie in the doing: but besides, to aunswere your ordinarie cauillation in defence of your manifest Idolatrie.
The Temple being clensed from these Images, the Priestes offered, first for the King, Pro Regno, for the Kingdome, that is, sayth Lyra, pro Rege Principibus, for the King and the Princes: and after for themselues the people.
The King ad them offer on ye aultar of the Lord: and they obeyed, offred (sayth Lyra) pro peccatis Regis, Principum, Sacerdotum, Leuitarum, communis populi.
For the sinnes of the King, of the Princes, and of the Priestes, and of the Leuites, and of the common people.
Againe, he commaunded the Priestes to offer the burnt offrings, and he and his Princes commaunded them to sing Psalmes.
When they had sung and worshipped the Lorde: he tolde the Leuites they were sanctified, and commaunded them to doe their ecclesiasticall functions: saying, Accedite offere victimas laudes in domo domini, Come neare and offer burnt offrings and prayses in the house of the Lorde.
Thus are all these ecclesiastical matters hitherto noted, done of the Priests and Leuits by the direction commaunding of Ezechias.
Nor this your common shift can any thing auaile you to abase Ezechias doings, bicause he appoynted diuerse of those things According as Dauid had disposed: he appoynted also diuers other thinges, which Dauid neuer had disposed, and yet he had the lyke authoritie and commendation in appoynting both.
Which argueth his supreme authoritie in appoynting ecclesiastical matters, whosoeuer had appointed the~ before.
And what was Dauit? was he not a king also? So that this paltrie shift still maketh agaynst you, that although godly Princes succeding, establish, renue, appoint, commaunde such matters as their predecessors haue done before: yet haue they no lesse authoritie therein, than had euen the first appoynters of all.
And also the Quéenes maiestie taketh none other authoritie now on hir, in appointing commaunding, than Dauid, Ezechias, other auncient godly Princes did: than Constantinus, and other hir predecessors, haue done before.
And hir authoritie, in renuing such orders as long haue bene decayed or abolished· is lesse than was theirs, in the first ordering and commaunding of them.
But ye say king Dauid did not order those things by him selfe, but it was Gods commaundement.
As though any said (except it eyour Pope) that this supreme authoritie is not subiect to Gods commaundement, and vnder hys absolute authoritie, or as though this subiection vnder God, abaseth the Princes authoritie, and not rather confirmeth it to be immediate next vnder him.
But ye adde further, God did it, by the handes of his Prophetes.
If to do a thing by the hands of another, do alwayes signifie a supreme authoritie in the partie by whose handes it is done, then were ye Princes Pursiuant or letter bearer, aboue the Lieutenant, Iudge, or Deputie, to whom the letter is sent.
But the bearer although the Prince sende it by his hande or ministerie, is not onely vnder the sender, but also vnder the partie to whome it is sent, and he, not the earer, is next and immediate vnder the Prince, in the performing of his letter, and signifieth againe to the Prince by the bearers hande, his dutifull obedience in fulfilling the content thereof.
Either parties here, ye sée, vse the bearers hande or ministerie: doth it follow therevpon, he is superior to either of them, or not rather vnder both? What good argument can ye frame herevpon? God commaunded Dauid by the handes of his Prophets: Ergo, the Prophetes were aboue Dauid in ordering and directing Gods will and commaundement? And againe, where ye say, Iosue, Dauid and other Princes sacrificed by the handes of the Priestes.
Ergo, the Priestes and Leuits were aboue Iosue, Dauid, and those other Princes? Your argument therfore, God co~maunded by the handes of his prophete, that the king should make such orders: Ergo, the Prophete is the Kings supreme gouernour: is a very slender argument.
But if ye had reasoned thus, The partie that commaundeth is supreme gouernour to him by whose handes he doth it: The Prince commaundeth these ecclesiasticall matters to be done by the handes of the Priestes and Leuites: Ergo, the Prince therein is the supreme gouernour to the Priests and Leuites.
This had bene the fitter and truer argument of the twayne.
Neuerthelesse M. Stapl. ye haue shifte vpon shifte, and more waies perceiue to the wood tha~ one.
For, séeing that this argument, God commaunded by the hands of the clergie, that the Prince should make ecclesiastical orders, could not inferre he did it by their authoritie, but rather it argueth the Princes authoritie ouer the clergie: ye fall then in quarelling, that the Byshop sayth, the king did it by the counsell of the Prophets.
As though (say you) Dauid had first done it by the aduise or counsell onely of the Prophets, by his owne authoritie.
M. St. by the counsell aduise of other, inferre his own authoritie, in the disposing, that is the asker of counsell? Thus ye say héere, and remember ye say it.
For hereafter ye make this a common reason: He did it by their counsell, Ergo, he did it not by his owns authoritie.
But be it Master Stapleton, he dyd it not of his owne deuise and simple commaundemente or authoritie, but by Gods commaundement and authoritie ouer him.
Dothe it followe therfore he did it not by his owne authoritie, since all his authoritie was of God? but what improueth this his authoritie ouer the priests or prophets? can ye shew he did it by their authoritie? be it their counsel, or be it their declaration, their authoritie it was not, but Gods: and vnder God, the kinges authoritie, in disposing suche orders.
And therfore your caui agaynst the word counsel, sheweth you wanted counsell to haue disposed your answere better.
For euen in this present example, do ye not sée how king Ezechias did order diuers eccl. matters by the counsell of his princes, clergie, people, and yet the whole dooing was by his owne authoritie? Inito{que} consilo Regis principum vniuersi coetus Ierusalem, decreuernt fcerent phase me~se secundo.
And a councell beeing helde of the king and his princes, and al the assemblie of Ierusale~, they decreed to kepe the Passouer the.
moneth Wheron sayth Lyra, Circa celebratione~ Ezechs de consilio sacerdotum diem instituit.
About this celebration, Ezechias by the cou~sel of the priests instituted the day: Secondly he bad the people therevnto: Thirdly he celebrated it solemnly· So that the whole doing in this councel was by his owne authoritie in a matter neuer vsed before, for the present necessitie to change the day of the Passeouer.
Moses, Dauid, or any other Prince, had neuer by the commaundement of God, or by the handes of his Prophetes ordeyned it before.
And therefore withall where ye say: In all thinges that Ezechias or Iosaphat before dyd, they dyd but as Dauid had done before.
answere, that whatsoeuer they dyd, you héere do none other, than your masters and you haue done before.
Ye care not what rechlesse lies ye boldly auouch, to bolster vp your false cause, and furnishe your volumes withall.
Were all these thinges hitherto recited, done before by Dauid? had he taken downe and destroyed the Brasen serpent? had he caused the Leuites to play the Priestes partes? had he altered the Passouer day? had he appoynted before to the Cleargie those portions of liuelde that are mentioned? Besides diuers others things that argue his authoritie.
For after his summons to come to the Passeouer, whereto the Iewes obeyed, Ut facerent, secundum prceptum Regis principum, verbum Domini: To doe the worde of the Lorde after the commaundement of the king, and of the Princes: bicause there were not Priestes clensed inowe, the Leuites did that, whiche by the lawe belonged onely to the Priestes offices.
But by whose authoritie did they it, had God commaunded it by the handes of his Prophetes? had Moses, Dauid, or any other so disposed it before? or dyd they it héere of their owne brayne? No, sayth Lyra, it was done de mandato Regi, by the kinges commaundement.
They also that were vncleane did eate of the Passeouer, which according to the law, ought to haue bene eaten only of the cleane.
But they were, sayth he, dispensed with for the necessitie.
And how? the king him selfe, that was the commaunder and doer of these things, contrary to the law for necessitie sake, made a prayer for them to the Lord, and he heard him, and was pleased therwith.
Thus did God accept these dealings of the king in ecclesiastical matters, and allow his authoritie in commaunding disposing them.
And as he was the chiefe orderer and directer of all these things, so it followeth in the.
chapter, how he directed all other things about the Priestes.
And therefore sayth Lyra theron: Cum{que} haec fuissent ite celebrata, &c. Hic consequenter sub Ezechia discribitur reparatio sacerdotalis ministerij, &c. VVhen these thinges were orderly celebrated.
&c. Here consequently is described vnder Ezechias, the repayring of the priestly ministerie, about which is first described the destroying of Idolatrie, where the text sayth: And they brake the Images, &c.
And this by good reason, bicause that first the impediments of the Priestly ministerie ought to be remoued, &c. Seco~dly, the repairing of the priestly ministery is described, &c. where Ezechias, first, restored the priests and Leuites in their offices.
Thirdly, he ordeined in these things procurators for the~. &c.
And thus all the doing, not onely ouer the temporaltie, but ouer al the clergie, so far as apperteineth to ye chief gouernme~t vnder God, in ordring, appoynting, co~manding, directing, prouiding, belonged to K. Ezechias.
And in the ende hereof, the scripture giueth him this co~mendation, fecit ergo Ezechias vniuersa, &c Ezechias therfore did all the thinges that we haue spoken of, through all Iuda, and he wrought that which was good, and right, true before the Lorde his god in al the works that he bega~, for the seruice of the house of God bothe in the lawe, and in the commaundementes he sought his God, and did the same with all his heart, and it succeeded prosperously.
In like case, God be praysed (maugre your mightie Zenacheribs head triple crowne, with al your blasphemous raylings, that play the parte of Rabsaces, to robbe the peoples harts from the Lorde their God, fro~ their duetyfull obedience to their princes supreme authoritie) the Lorde hath prospered blessed the Q. Maiestie, in following this godly Princes steps, in reforming, or newly establishing Gods true religion decayed, as this good king Ezechias did.
And therfore as are all the residue of these your séely shifts in this example, so is your conclusion no whit agaynst hir highnes doings, and but slaunderous lies on hir Maiestie, and craking lyes on your selues, saying: This is farre from enacting a new religion, by force of supreme authoritie, contrary to the co~mandement of God, declared by the bishops priests, the onely ministers of God now in spiritual matters, as Prophets were then in the like.
And this ye clappe vp for ful conclusion, to all the doings of king Ezechias.
To which conclusion before answere, haue to detect one pretie shift of yours, muche practised in your volume.
Whe~ ye should haue answered to the doings of king Dauid, ye then sent vs hither to the doings of king Ezechias: now when ye come to the answere of king Ezechias, ye sende vs backe agayne to the doings of king Dauid.
Likewise, when ye should fully answere the doings of king Iosaphat, ye tell vs: How Iosaphat appoynted the Leuites and priests to these eccl. functions it shall appeare in the next chapter by the example of Ezechias.
When we come to the example of Ezechias, to finde it set out héere, as ye promised, ye sende vs backe agayne to Iosaphat, and to Dauid, saying: In all that Ezechias, or before Iosaphat did, they did but as Dauid had done before.
That is, they executed Gods commaundement declared by the prophetes.
And thus ye shifte and poste vs of, from one place to another, making vs beleue here, that ye answered fully there: making vs beleeue there, ye answere fully here, and when both places be conferred, ye haue answered no more in the one than ye haue in the other, and that is in effect· to resolue the arguments, nought at all in both.
And if ye make an accompt of this place to be a resolute answere, why sende ye vs backe againe to Dauid and Iosaphat? yet how can those answere this, or this answere those examples? Since many things ye se here were done by Ezechias, that were not the executing of any commaundement of God by any of his Prophetes before: But of his owne authoritie Ezechias dispensed for them, and was allowed of God therein, when he had commaunded them to be done.
Now for your conclusion of the Quéenes Maiestie is mere sclaunderouse and like to your premisses.
Hir highnesse doth not by force of hi supreme authoritie enact a new religion contrary to Gods commaundement, but by the force of Gods woorde in these ensamples, giuing hir a supreme authoritie: she enacteth the most old religion to be renewed and restored, and reiecteth all other as new, crept since into the Church, not proceeding ab Antiquo dierum, from the ancient of dayes, but ab antiquo serpente, from the ancient serpent, such as chiefly is the doctrine of papistrie.
And therefore your conclusion is not to the matter in hande, otherwise than against your Pope.
For he by the force of Supreme gouernment, or rather supreme vsurpatio~, enacteth a new religion contrary to Gods co~mandement, declared by Christ his Apostles, therfore by the Apostle is accursed.
If any shall preach any other gospel than that ye haue receiued: let him be accursed.
As for that ye say, the co~maundement of God declared by the Bishops and Priests: is but a craking lie.
For they hidde Gods co~mandement (if ye meane your popish Bishops and priests) and declared their owne commaundement, in steade thereof, as did the Phariseys make frustrate Gods commandement for their owne traditions sake.
And so farre are they from being the ministers of God now in spirituall matters: that, as they dispise to administer Gods worde Sacraments, so they disdayns scorne at, euen the name of Ministers, as euen your selfe do M. St. other where, how soeuer here it came vppon you, to pretende to bestow a reuerent speach thereon.
But the Apostles thought not scorne of the name, but willed men so to estéeme them, as the ministers of God and the dispensers of his mysteries, but as your papall Bishops and Priestes be nothing like Gods ministers, so least of all are they like the Prophets that were then, except ye meane the prophets of Baal, that maintayned idolatrie and pleasant leasings, to maintayne them selues at Achabs table, and fill their paunches with the chéere of Beel and the Dragon.
The Lords prophets they be not like neither in preaching, propheciyng or ought els.
And yet saith M. Stapl. they be the onely ministers of God now in spirituall matters, as prophets were then in the like.
Why M. Stapl. were the prophets then onely gods ministers in spirituall matters? if ye say, no: how doth your tale hang togither? why say ye, they are onely Gods ministers now, as Prophets were then in the like? since the Prophetes were not onely Gods ministers then, as ye pretende for your Bishops and Priestes to be onely now.
If they were not onely then, no more be yours only now, admitting they were in the like.
If ye say, yea: they were onely then Gods ministers, as the Bishops and Priests be now: what were the Bishops, Priestes and Leuites then, that were no prophetes, were not they Gods ministers in spirituall matters also? if yea, then were not the Prophets in the like to your Bishops and Priestes, that are (as ye say) only gods ministers now.
Make your tale for shame hang better togither, and withall tell what you meane by this dubble shuffling.
Ye tolde vs before that your Bishops and Priestes now, are like the Bishops and Priestes then: and that not the Prophets, but the Priestes, had that prerogatiue which ye haue so often craked vpon, your generall rule of iudgeme~t, whereby ye vrged then, a supremacie, not in the Prophets, but in the Bishops Priests.
And now seing that ye ca~ not proue it in these examples, where the Bishops Priests obey the Princes ordinance as his inferiours: ye shift of the matter to the Prophetes, say now your priests prelates succéede are like the Prophetes let go the former claime of priests.
But these are but your shifts, for if the Prophets had this supreme gouernment, then the priests had it not.
If it appertained to the hie priestes chayre, so long as the priesthoode of Moses continued, then it belonged not to the Prophetes, and thus ye contrary your selfe.
But in very déede neither of the~ both had it, but the Prince vnder God.
They were both Gods ministers in their diuerse functio~s, and yet subiecte to their Princes as for the popish Bishops and priestes, are like to neither of both.
THe Bishop with the like example of Iosias concludeth his collection of the Princes in the Old Testament, and herevppon maketh in effect this reason: All these doinges of these kinges are commended as acceptable seruice and right in the sight of God: But the clayming taking vppon them the supreme gouernment ouer the ecclesiasticall persons of all degrees, the ruling, gouerning and directing them in all their functions, in al manner causes belonging to religion, were the doings of all these kinges: Ergo, For Princes to clayme and take vppon them the like supreme gouernment, is their right and acceptable seruice in the sight of God.
The counterblast of master Stapleton to this diuision is thrée folde.
Thirdly by setting vp newe issues and markes, to improue all that the Bishop hath hitherto exemplified, as vnsufficient to proue the issue.
King Iosias traueled full godly in suppressing Idolatrie by his kingly authoritie.
VVhat then? so doe good catholike Princes also, to plucke downe the Idolles that yee and your brethren haue of late set vp, and yet none of them take them selues for supreme heades in all causes spirituall.
This is all that he aunswereth to the example of Iosias.
First where the Bishop sayd: Iosias had the like care (to the foresayde Princes) for religion, and vsed in the same sorte his Princely authoritie in reforming all abuses in al maner causes ecclesiastical.
He traueled full godly in suppressing Idolatrie by his kingly authoritie.
As though this were a full aunswere denying or graunting the Bishops assertion, or as thoughe besides the suppressing of Idolatrie, he did nothing else.
Where as the scripture is plaine, how hee also redde the lawe before all his subiects, how he made the couenant with God that all hys subiectes shoulde walke after the Lorde, and obserue all hys commaundements, testimonies and ceremonies.
Howe he commaunded them to kéepe suche a solemne passeouer, as was neuer kept by any of all the kings before him.
How the Priestes appoynted not themselues, but he appoynted them in their offices.
Howe they exhorted not him, but howe he exhorted them, to prepare themselues (sayth Lyra) dutifully to celebrate with deuotion the solemnitie of the passeouer.
Howe he commaunded the arke to be set vp in the Sanctuarie, and to beare it no more on their shoulders.
Howe he commaunded the~ to minister to the Lord and to his people Israel.
How he commaunded the~ to prepare them selues according to the houses of their au~cesters in their orders a Dauid had appointed them.
How he co~maunded them to minister in the sanctuary by their families and Leuiticall courses.
How he commaunded them to be sanctified, and then to offer the passeouer.
How he commau~ded them also to prepare or sanctifie the residue of their brethren.
And when al things were prepared, how the Priestes kept their stations and the Leuites were in their orders according as the king had commaunded them.
And so (saith the text,) after it hath reckened vp the manner of the Priests, Leuites, singers and porters ministeries) all the seruice or worship was orderly accomplished in that day to keepe the passeouer and offer their burnt offrings vppon the aultare of the Lorde according to the commaundement of Iosias the King.
All these things (M. Stapl.) were done by his authoritie and commaundement: But all these thinges are matters and causes ecclesiasticall: Ergo, his authoritie and commaundement stretched furder than in suppressing Idolatrie, yea uen ouer the chiefest matters ecclesiasticall.
But all this had M. Stap. quite forgotten, and therefore we must beare with him, though he answere the Bishop only with this: Iosias traueled full godly in suppressing Idolatrie by his kingly authoritie.
Wherein we sée also how doubtfully he speaketh, for when he perceyued it could not be denied, but that which he did, he did by his kingly authoritie, yet would he not say that he suppressed Idolatrie by his kingly authoritie, but he traueled full godly in suppressing Idolatrie by his kingly authoritie.
as though his kingly authoritie stretched no furder, than to trauell in the execution of seruing the priestly authoritie.
But the Scripture is most euident, that his kingly authoritie and godly trauell, was not in executing the Priestes commaundement, but the priestly authoritie traueled in the seruice and executing of the Princes commandement.
For, as he destroyed all their Idols and places of Idolatry, and abolished or depriued (as Uatablus expoundeth it) the false priestes of their priestly dignitie: so he commaunded by this his kingly authoritie, all the true priestes, both the high priest Helchias, and vnder him the inferiour priestes and porters, to trauell likewise in bringing out to him all the Idolatrous vessels, and he summoned or gathered togither all the Priestes.
And all that there is done, is named to be done by him, that is to say eyther by him selfe, or by his appoyntment and commaundement, through his kingly authoritie, both in abolishing the false worship, and in establishing and directing the true worship of God, not onely in generall, but also in perticuler, yea in the chiefest spirituall matters, ouer all the Clergie and the high Priest, so well as all his other subiectes: and all this was done of him by his kingly authoritie.
But what then saith M. Stapleton, to all this: as it were with a phillip to ouerturne al the matter, with his Masters what then.
Forsooth M. St. then, it was not his godly trauell in a seruiceable execution of the priestes commaundements: but his godly trauell in commaunding them, their godly trauel in a seruiceable execution of the kinges commaundements.
And then, it was not onely in suppressing Idolatrie as you limite it, but in refourming, establishing, directing appointing the whole true worship of God besides.
And then was this his kingly authoritie, by the which he did all these things, though many of them were Moses, Dauids, yea the Prophetes former ordinances, and Gods commaundement long before: yet were they done here by the kinges owne authoritie, which in the last example of Ezechias concerning Dauid ye would not admitte, bicause it was Gods appoyntment by the hande of his Prophetes.
Such as were many of these things like wise, and yet now ye graunt, they were done also euen by Iosias his kingly authoritie.
And then, pray you, what so great a difference finde ye betwéene these twaine, the King doth it by his kingly authoritie, that here ye confesse: and the King doth it by his owne authoritie, that there ye denied? is not the kinges kingly authoritie, the Kinges owne authoritie? and yet is all his authoritie from God.
It followeth then, to your what then, by your owne confession, and the manifest Scripture, that this his owne kingly authoritie of Iosias, was next vnder God the chiefe and supreme ouer all the Priestes, Leuites, Singers, Porters, or any other, so well as the people, in all abolishing of false religion, and in all commaunding and directing the true worship and religion of God, which are the principall causes ecclesiasticall.
And what then say you to this M. Stapleton? doth it not cléerely proue the Bishops assertion against M. Feckenha~, for al your counterblasting it with your bigge what then? Thinke ye it proues he did no more then, than you will suffer Princes to do now, abusing them with the title of good catholike Princes, and bereauing them of their good catholike and princely authoritie, that by the examples of these good catholike princes they ought to take vpon them, and your Pope vsurpes it from them? And yet you say (to abase the doings of Iosias) so do good catholike Princes also, to plucke downe the Idolles that ye and your brethren haue of late set vp, and yet none of them tooke them selues for supreme heades in all causes spirituall.
The question is not nowe Master Stapleton, what those your good catholike Princes (as ye call them) take them selues to be: whome you haue spoyled, and make beléeue, what it pleaseth you to tell them, that their kingly authoritie reacheth no furder but to be seruiceable trauelers and executioners of your commaundements.
But the question is here, what these Princes (mencioned in the holy Scriptures) tooke them selues to be, which appereth by their appointinges and co~maundinges of their Clergie in their functions, that they tooke them selues for their Clergies supreme gouernours in these matters.
And so ought al good catholike princes by their examples to estéeme of them selues, and of their high calling and charge in ecclesiasticall causes, and trauayle by their godly supreme gouernment to discharge the same.
Where ye say therefore, so do good catholike princes, meaning those that submitte themselues, with all the gouernment of religion, and all ecclesiasticall matters, to your Pope and his prelates, not medling them selues therewith, as did Iosias and these other godly Kinges, whome we sée to haue medled with the gouernment and direction thereof: it is apparant false, and their doinges herein are no more alike, than blacke is like to white: than to commaunde, directe and appoint others, is like, to be of the same parties, in the same matters, commaunded, directed and appointed themselues: than gouerning is like seruing: than one contrarie is like to another.
And yet you say (for ye care not what ye saie) as did king Iosias, so do your good catholike princes now.
But what is that they do? plucke down the Idols (say you) that you and your brethern haue set vp.
Whether we our bretheren, or you and your bretheren haue set vp Idols, let it fal out betwene vs as it shall, hereafter we shall come to the reckening: onely stande you to this M. Stapleton, that the plucking downe of Idols belongeth to Princes, by their kingly authoritie, and that so they ought to account of them selues their authoritie: which if they had done, and diligently executed this their kingly authoritie, your shifte of Images and Idols had not auayled you, for euen to your moste famous Images, shrines, and pilgrimages, hath foule idolatrie bene committed, as the chiefe of your brethren them selues are fayne to confesse, and crye out vpon, and yet durst your princes neuer pull them downe, nor you would euer haue suffred th so to do, (for your lucre lay muche therein) but caused the Princes to mainteine and enriche suche Images as you dayly did set vp.
As for the Idols that we should haue set vp, who séeth not we haue so little set vp any, that we reiecte for Idols those which ye call your Images, and professe that neither they, nor any other thing besides God, nor God in them, or by them, is to be worshipped: but God alone, and that in spirite and truthe, and so receiue his playne simple worde and sacraments.
But if, as ye sayde before, those Princes pull downe our heresies, and those are the Idols that we set vp: except this presupposall should be graunted you, that those be heresies which we mainteine, your argument néede not be plucked downe with idols, for it would fall downrighte of it selfe: what a kinde of reasoning call ye this, to take that for graunted, and out of all doubt true, that is chiefly denyed, and is most starke false? But what soeuer our doctrine is, do those your Princes plucke it downe by their kingly authoritie, or by your false suggestions and commaundements? or suffer you their kingly authoritie to pul downe, set vp, or meddle any thing at all with one iote of doctrine, true or false, more or lesse, otherwise than you by your priestly authoritie, will commaund, appoynt direct them? What babble ye then of their kingly authoritie, in pulling downe such idols of ours (as ye say) where both there is neither any Idols at all, and you giue them, be there or be there not, no authoritie, kingly nor vnkingly at all, but onely make them your seruitours, mighte say for your vnworthie vsage of them, your Butchers slaughtermen, at your commaundement to kill and make hauocke in the congregation of Christ, destroying his liuely Images and members, for the maintenance of your dead Images most grosse Idolatrie.
And yet ye obiect Idolatrie to vs, which is, not to espie a mote, but to quarrell at a mote, in your brothers eie, where none is: and not to see the great beame, or rather a number of beames, postes, stones, stockes infinit Idols in your owne eyes, and in the sight of all the worlde.
Can your Princes see to plucke out so small a mote in our eyes, yea, so small to your eyes, that ye are fame to call it inuisible or spirituall Idolatrie (and yet falsely charge vs therin also) can not sée to pull out of their owne eies, those open manifest Idolatries that the Popish Church hath set vp? would ye haue vs thinke those princes to be thus blind? Surely if some of the~ be, yet many of them haue séene and do sée such inckling, that ye had néede to beware betymes what kingly authoritie ye geue them in plucking downe of Idols.
For shortly they will not onely pull downe all your Idols, but pul you downe also for wicked Idolaters, asking Iosias pulled down suppressed al Idolatrie by his kingly authority.
And so by his example many good catholike princes indéede, as ye say, (thanks be to God) haue done, do, and God willing shal dayly more more suppresse pul downe the Idols, that you and your brethren M. St. haue of long time set vp.
And in steede thereof by their kingly authoritie, set vp the true worde and worship of God.
And thus, as did Iosias, hath the Quéenes maiesties most noble Father Brother of famous memories done, hi Highnesse after them (who~ God continue prosper) doth.
And as Iosias not onely pulled downe the Idols, but also the houses and ope~ maintenance of filthie fornication, in the false Idolatrous priests, in their geided chaplaines, as Lyra sayth, as he telleth how the Hebrues called them diculas Mnachorum, the celles of Monkes, how he destroyed their Sodomitical priests, and their co~ctines, that weaued their hangings for their groues: So do ought to do good catholike princes.
And so hath the Maiestie both suppressed the popish Idols, abolished a maintenance dispensations of whores, concubines, other such vowed Stalions Sodomites, pulled down the Monkish cels, with their Nunnish weauers, hath (as did Iosias) established the only worship of the liuing God.
ye only veritie of gods most blessed word, the holy ordina~ce of honorable chast matrimony.
And this hath she done by Gods co~mandeme~t, by the hand of his prophets vnder God by hir royall or kingly authoritie (for so may cal it, for al your petit quarels) and therfore since she can ought to do these things (as did Iosias) by hir kingly authoritie: it followeth, hir kingly authoritie is a supreme authoritie, ouer all hir subiects, bishops, and priests, or any other, so wel Clarke as Lay, in suppressing al false religio~, plucking it downe, in setting vp establishing Gods true religion, and al things ecclesiasticall belonging there vnto.
Now sayth M. St. to the bishops argume~t, collecting his conclusions on the manyfest doings of all these Princes: And ye haue hitherto brought nothing effectual to proue that the kings of Israel did so, wherfore your co~clusion, that they did rule, gouerne, and direct the eccl. persons in all their functions, in al maner causes of religion, is an open notorious lie: and the contrary is by vs auouched, sufficiently proued by the authoritie of the olde Testament, whereupon ye haue hitherto rested and setled your selfe.
Whether this bare saying, on M. Stap. priestly authoritie, without any further profe or improfe, be any thing effectuall, to proue that the kinges of Israell dyd not so: and whether the Byshops conclusion, of these tr open and notorious doings, or M. Stap. deniall, be an open and notorious lye: let the indifferent reader marker of these kings doings, hardly be the pere.
But M. St. as though he had decided the matter already to the readers hand: The contrary (saith he) is by vs auouched and sufficiently proued by the authoritie of the olde Testament.
That it is auouched, M. St. and that full stoutly auouched the reader may soone perceiue.
But that this your auouching is sufficiently proued by the authoritie of the olde Testament, woulde require a more sufficient proofe and authoritie, than your so saying (M. Stap.) in the iudgment of any sufficient examiner and conferrer, what you on the one parte out of the olde Testament, hitherto haue alleaged for your priestes supreme gouernment, and what the byshop hath alleaged for the Princes supreme guuernement: bothe allegations and proues in their places are euident.
Commit them to the reader, suspende your hastie and partiall iudgement, least your sufficient proues be estéemed more vnsufficient.
The thirde parte of M. Stap. answere is prefixed with a marginall note, saying: It is heere declared, that master Horne commeth nothing nye the principall question.
First, an exhortation to regarde the principall scope and issue of the matter.
Secondly, a setting vp of eight or nyne new markes, as the issue and principall matter in question.
Thirdly, a number of outcries and exclamations, that the byshop shooteth wide, and commeth not néere the marke.
The first (as ye say M. Sta.) is a good admonition.
Necessarie it is that the Byshop haue before his eye the very state of the question, which must be especially euer regarded of such as mynde not too loosely, and altogither vnfruitfully imploy their owne labour, and loose bothe their owne, and the readers labour.
This is good counsell, and ye often put the Byshop in minde of it, but pray you dothe it not comprehende your selfe? or haue ye a Bull from the Pope to call vpon other, and dispence with your selfe? it may well be ye haue some especiall placard, for ye vse it throughout all your counterblast, to make your continuall outrodes and vagaries quite from the matter.
No Flie is busier in buzzing on entrye dish, than your Counterblast is blowing on euery flim am tale.
If ye thinke ye maye be borne withall for the enlarging of your volume, yet ye make your Readers loosely and altogither vnfruitfully to employ their labours carying them at roauers (as ye say) and at randon to, (s ye had woont to do the people after all Hallowes) from the very state of the question in controuersie.
For shame therefore vpbrayde not this to the Bishop, of straying from the marke, excepte you kéepe your selfe better to the marke, or else shewe your Dispensation that yée may styll babble all besides the question, of what impertinent tryfles yée please to descante vppon, and will not suffer your aduersary once to wincke awrye, nor to alleage anye thing, thoughe it neuer so muche appertayne to the purpose, if it doe not directly conclude the very state of the question.
If ye will deale vprightly, call vpon the Bishop hardly, so oft as ye will: but then stande you for shame to your tackling to, least an other come and call as fast on you, to marke and regarde better the matter ye meddle withall.
But perhappes ye will say, admitte that ranne astray from the matter my selfe, yet, doth my faulte excuse the Byshoppes? In déede it doth not Master Stapleton, if hée bée faultie therein, but it lesseneth hys, and it maketh yours the greater, and the more to your shame, except yée be a verye impudent man, for your fault herein is manifest, and therefore deciphered oute vnto you, in one of your common places? If ye be belied, there purge your selfe, whiche tll ye doe, the more ye call vppon the Bishop, to kéepe him to his marke: he that shall marke your dealing, shall wish you had either lesse impudencie, or more remembrance of your selfe.
Neuerthelesse, since ye so sharply chalenge the Bishop, that all his examples draw nothing neare the mark, but runne at randon, and shoote all at Rouers: pray you sir call to your remembraunce what was the marke and issue in question betwene them? was it not this, that if the Bishop by any of the foure abouesayde meanes coulde make proofe to master Feckenham that any Emperor, or Empresle, King or Queene, may clay me or take vpon them any such gouernment in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes, that then he would yéelde? Was not this the state of their question? accorded they not on this issue? and ought not the Bishop to direct all his examples to proue this? And if he proue this, whether he shotte at Buttes or Rouers, hath he not hytte the marke? and what woulde ye haue more? Nowe that he hath done this, is plainely proued by euery of these examples, and that not onely as the wordes of the issue inforce, that they tooke vpon them some suche gouernement in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes, which being prooued is ynough to discharge the Bishop of straying from his matter: but also, that they daymed and tooke vppon them suche supreme gouernement in all spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes.
And you haue counterblasted nothing to the contrary, that were able to remoue these prooues from this marke and issue, sauing your facing and bracing of the matter, and a number of blynde pelting and foreworne shiftes, except ye haue any better behinde to come.
For all these shiftes hitherto notwithstanding, the Bishoppes examples are both directly directed to the issue, and directly and fully prooue the same.
And whers ye find faulte with straggling from it, ye touch not him, but wring your selfe by the nose.
For ensample whereof, remitte the Reader to your common place thereon, or to spare his paynes, and go no further, than euen here to marke the markes that your selfe set vp, and conferre them with the issue betwéene the Bishoppe and master Feckenham, and the Reader shall soone discerne howe farre of purpose ye stray from it, yea from those false markes also that your selfe set vp before And yet ye crie the Bishop strayes from the marke, and will the Reader to fixe his eye thereon.
But herein ye play as the common people say the Lapwing or Pewet doeth, who when they seeke hir Neast, draweth them still further and further from it, wyth hir noyse and flittering about them, crying as the simple people imagine, here is it, here is it, when it is nothing neare it.
And euen as they conceyue of the Pewet, so do you with vs, with great noyse and earnestnesse, bidding vs regarde and set before our eyes the very state of the question, and busily pretende to tell vs wherein lyeth all the chiefe question, when vnder the cloake and credite of this your earnestnesse, ye carie the reader quite away from the question and issue in controuersie, to runne vp and downe after such newe and so many questions, that the Reader dared as a man in a maze, shoulde neyther perceyue the true question in déede, nor finde out the weakenesse and falsehoode of your cause, nor well knowe where himselfe is become.
But, that he maye winde himselfe the better oute of this your Laberinthe, let him (as is sayde before) directe his eye euer on the issue betweene the parties, and then shall hée still see whereaboutes hée is, and howe farre or neare, not onely the Bishop is, but you also are, to or from the matter.
The issue, as is before sayde, is this, That any Emperor or Empresle, King or Queene, claymed or tooke vpon them any such gouernment.
By this issue in all his examples, hath the Byshoppe directed him selfe, that Moses, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Iosaphat, Ezechias, and Iosias, did take vpon them suche gouernment.
But all these were Kings and Princes of Gods people, commended of God for their godly gouernance: Therfore Emperours and Empresses Kings Quenes, may and ought to take such gouernment vpon them.
This being alwayes the Bishops conclusion, wherein strayed he from the issue? But nowe come you ruffling in with Nine newe issues for aduauntage, not one of them all béeing the verie issue and state of the question in controuersie, and yet you crie the Bishop draweth nothing nigh the marke.
True in déede master Stapleton, he draweth nothing neare the markes that you haue set vp, for the nigher hee shoulde drawe to them, he shoulde drawe the further from the question betwéene master Feckenham and him, as you doe of purpose in all these your markes, to deceyue, and begule the simple Reader, that thinkes ye meane good truth, when ye rte so often on the question, and runne so farre from the same.
For ensample, was this pray you good master Stapleton, (to vse your owne phase) the issue and question betwéene them, whether these Kings acknowledged, or not acknowledged the highe Priest? is true, and the Byshoppe demeth not, that they did agnise the highe Priest, euerie one of them.
But followeth it thereon, that they agnised him to bee their supreme heade or gouernour? This woulde require to bée prooued with some better Logycke.
As for these examples, argue all the contrary, that though the Prins agnised alway one to be the chiefe Priest, and also agnised all other inferiour Priestes, Leuites, Porters, Singers, in theyr offices: yet all those, highe and lowe, whatsoeuer, acknowledged agayne the supreme gouernement of commaunding, appoynting, ordring, directing, and ouerseeing them, to doe all their duties dutifully: to appertayne not to themselues, but to theyr soueraigne Princes.
And the Princes (as theyr seuerall examples witnesse) tooke it vppon them, in commaunding, appoynting, placing, and displacing, all and euery one, yea the highest Priest himselfe.
And therefore where ye say to the Bishop: pray you good M. Horne bring forth that king, that did not agnise one supreme heade and chiefe iudge in all causes ecclesiasticall among the Iewes, meane the highe Priest, wherein lyeth all our chiefe question.
Yee haue not yet done it, nor neuer shall doe it.
And ye coulde shewe anie, it were not worth the shewing.
For ye shoulde not shewe it in anie good King, as beeing an open breache of Gods lawe giuen to him by Moses, as this your doings are an open breache of Christ and his Churches lawe, and giuen to vs in the newe Testament.
The Bishop hath done it euidently that ye require, and the scripture is manifest in all these Kings ensamples.
Nor they were any wicked Kings, nor breakers of Gods law giuen by Moses, or any other.
But euen Moses and all the rest, were mainteiners of Gods law giuen to them, and therfore are worth the shewing.
Your conclusion that our doings are an open breache of Christ and his Churches lawe, giuen to vs in the new Testament, maye well ouerpasse without aunswere, dismissing it to your common place of slaunders, not onely of vs, but of Christ and his Churche, and his newe Testament also: till ye shewe in what place of the newe Testiment, Christ and his Church (whom ye ioyne togither in this law making) did make and giue vs this law, that either our godly Christian Princes should not haue this supreme gouernment ouer their dominions, or that your Pope should haue it ouer all the vniuersall Churche.
And when ye haue proued this, proue also this your first new marke, to be the verie state and issue here in question betwene the Bishop and master Feckenham, or else agnise with shame your selfe, that ye runne at randon, loosely and altogither vnfruitfully, haue employed yours and your Readers labour, for all (so lyke a Faulconer) ye crie marke, marke, neuer so muche.
Your first false marke béeing thus reared vppe, yée sette vppe a seconde, muche lesse lyke the issue betwéene them, but much more lyke the malicious slaunders among you, saying: Againe, what president haue ye shewed of any good King among the Iewes, that with his laitie, altered and abandoned the vsuall Religion a thousande yeares and vpwarde customably from age to age receyued and embraced: and that the high Priest, and the whole clergie gainsaying all such alterations? If ye haue not shewed this, ye haue strayed farre from the marke.
Whether this be the marke or no, or whether maister Stapleton of purpose straggle from it, the conference of the issue wyth this, will soone declare, there is no néede to fette the highe Priestes iudgement as in a doubtfull matter.
Euery childe maye sée not onely howe farre they differ, but also what an heape of slaunders on a plumpe, he burdeneth like an vngracious subiect, his most gracious soueraigne withall.
As for the Quéenes Maiesties most godly doings, are very well confirmed by these examples.
And in proufe thereof, the Bishop euer kept him closely to hys marke, that the supreme gouernment which hir Maiestie taketh on hir, is none other, but such as they before did take on them.
Hir highnesse hath abandoned olde inueterate errors, crept in besides, and contrary to the worde of God: she saw the ensample in these godly Kings before hir, whose doings therein she followed.
Hir highnesse hath by the aduice and instruction of hir godly learned Clergie, reformed religion according to Gods word, although the Popish clergie were negligent and gainesayde the same: she sawe the ensample in these kings before hir, how by their godly learned prophets aduice, and instructions, according to Gods word, they reformed religion, although the Priests Leuits were negligent or withstood the same.
And this hitteth home the marke, Any such gouernment, syth both their supreme gouernments be so like.
And therfore in that you charge hir maiestie otherwise, is nothing eare the marke, but is your owne reprochfull and very trayterou slaunder.
The ioly number of a thousande yeares and vpwarde, of your vsuall religion, is but your common vaunte, and what if sayde your outfacing lie also, to deceyue the simple with a countenance of antiquitie, the noueltie and late hatching whereof, is dayly the more ye striue, the more discouered, to be nothing so auncient as ye pretende, of a thousande yeares and vpwarde.
Of which number the most part (the originals béeing well boulted out) may come backe againe halfe a thousande yeares and more downwarde with shame ynoughe.
But sée master Stapleton, ye haue hoysted vp your Religion so hie, that it staggreth againe, and higher for falling downeright ye can not get it.
It hath béene ye say the vsuall Religion a thousande yeares and vpwarde, that is a fayre tyme master Stapleton, God saue it.
But what meane ye by this indefinite terme vpwarde? Meane you it hath continued a thousande yeares and a little more? Alacke Master Stapleton am sorie for it, and for your paynes taking till your armes ake to lyft it vp so highe, and yet it commes too too short to be any true Religion.
For if it be the true Religion of Iesus Christe, whie say yee not boldely man, it is the vsuall Religion of fifteene hundreth yeares and vpwarde? But eyther your armes are too shorte, or your heart fayles you, to lifte it vpwarde so highe, for then the worde of GOD woulde soone controll you, and beate it downe agayne.
And therefore you are contente with a lower sayle, to crake that your Religion is yet a thousande yeares olde and vpwarde.
But as that is a false crake, so is it also, a vayne crake and serues not the turne, yea admitting it were so old as ye boast, yeares and vpward, yet ought it of all godly Princes to be remooued and pulled downe againe, except it be the Religion of fiftene hundreth yeares and vpwarde.
Eamsi Angelus docuerit aliud Euangelium quàm quod accepistis anahema sit.
Althoughe an Aungell from heauen should teache any other doctrine than you haue receyued, let him be accursed.
The Religion that the Quéenes Maiestie hath set forth (thankes be to God therefore) is the religion of
yeares and vpward, and therfore good reason that yours giue place to his senior, ye popish later base born religion of your Romish church, to th first most auncient true religion, of that Alpha Omega Iesus Christ himself.
Master Stap. hauing now set vp these two false markes, like to one being out of his way, that after he is once ouer his shooes in the myre, careth not howe he benyre himselfe, but running deeper through thicke and thinne, cryeth this is the way, to haue other to followe him: so rusheth on master Stapleton still further from the issue, and yet taketh euerye thing in his way, to bée hys marke and directorie.
Setting vp the perticuler factes of those Princes, that chalenge and take vppon them this supreme gouernement: that the selfe same factes must be founde in the ensamples of the olde testament, or else hée sayth, the Bishop strayeth from the marke.
VVhat euidence haue ye brought forth (sayth he) to shew that in the olde lawe, anye King exacted of the Clergie In verbo Sacerdoti, that they shoulde make none Ecclesiasticall lawe without his consent, as King Henrie did of the clergie of Englande.
Is this the marke master Stap. betwene the Bishop and master Feckenham, to proue in their supreme gouerments euerye selfe same perticuler fact, yea the circumstances about or concerning the fact to be all one, in them that clayme this gouernment nowe, and those that claymed it then: since bothe the states, the times, yea all the ceremonies of religion of the Iewes then, and ours nowe, are nothing like? and trow ye then the princes perticuler doings, must be like, and euen the same, and euidence must be giuen out of the one for euery fact of the other, or else their supreme authorities be not alike? The issue betweene them, is not so straight laced, but requireth onely any such gouernment, some such gouernment, yea he it, al suche gouernment to, meane not all suche actions in the gouernment, but the supreme directing, gouernance, authoritie, or powre, are proued both alike in either princes estate, so well ouer eccl. persons in all their functions then, or now, as ouer the temporall in theirs.
For by this rule, wheras that most famous prince king Henry the eight, did sweare also to his obedience, all his temporall, subiects in ciuill causes, as other Princes likewise haue done and do: it would be harde to allege an euidence thereof out of the old Testament, and yet their supreme gouernments therin, were not therefore vnlike.
As for the ministring of the othe, is but a circumstance to confirme the matter, and not the matter itselfe.
And if king Henry were (by the obstinate and craftie malice of his popishe clergi then,) constrayned for his more assurance, to take an othe or promise of them on the honestie of their priesthoode (which God wt, was but a small holde, as it went then in the moste of them) and that no king of those ancient yeres, mentioned in the olde testament, béeing not moued by the wickednesse or mistrust of his clergy, tooke the like othe or promise of their priestes honestie, or fayth of their priesthood then: what is this to or from the matter, why their supreme authorities shoulde not be alike in bothe? Do not you also say for your side, that the highe Priest had suche supreme gouernment then, as your Pope othe chalenge now our all eccl. causes? nd dothe ot your Pope nowe exacte of all his clergie, in verbo acerdotij, by the worde of their priesthoode, that they shall make no eccl. law without his consent? May we not then returne your owne words on your selfe? VVhat euidence can you bring foorth, to shew that in the olde lawe any highe Priest exacted this of the clergie vnder him? And if ye can not (as ye can not) dothe not then this your wyle reason and newe marke, ouerturne the false clayme that your Pope claymeth, of such supreme gouernment now, as the high Priest had then? But his clayme is false, his gouernment nothing like.
For the high priest then, tooke not vpon him to make eccl. lawes, as doth now your Pope: but only obserued such eccl. lawes, as God had made to his hande, till time of the Pharisies corruption, who not content with Gods lawes, had deuised besides, many fond lawes of their own inuentions, when there wanted amo~g them this kingly authoritie.
To the which, so long as it continued, the high priest al other obeyed, receyuing and obseruing such eccl. constitutions, as their godly princes made vnto them.
So did Aaron first receiue the eccl. co~stitutions of Moses.
So after him did alre residue admit the eccl. constitutions of Dauid, the rest of the foresaid princes: their priests made none of the~ selues without the Princes consent.
But the princes ordined diuers eccl. orders, partly with the aduise and consent, partly without, yea agaynst the wil co~sent of their clergy now then: and yet those godly princes exacted of them, euen as they were true priests (as the stories of Iosaphat and Ezechias mention, how they charged their priests, euen in that they were the Lords priests, which is all one with that you alleage in verbo sacerdotij) that they should do suche things as they appoynted them to do.
And is not this good and authenticall euidence for king Henries doings? but that the priests appoynted any suche ordinance without their princes consents, will be harde for you to bring the like, or any uidence at all for your Popes exacting.
And if, as ye conclude herevpon, this exacting to make no eccl. law without his consent, be to make the ciuil magistrate the supreme iudge for the final determinatio~ of causes ecclesiasticall: then your Pope hauing no such euidence for him, by this your marke, is no supreme iudge for suche finall determination: but it latly proueth agaynst you, that the Princes should be the supreme iudges therein.
And if the exacting of consent, importe suche supreme authoritie as héere ye confesse: then, whereas not onely these ancient kings, but also the ancient christian Emperors, in the confirming of your Pope, exacted, that none shoulde be a lawfull Pope, to whome they gaue not their consent: it argueth that those Emperours were the supreme Iudges, for the finall determination of the Popes ecclesiasticall election.
Which afterwarde, when ye come to the handling therof, ye renie: affirming that although his consent was necessarie to be required, yet it argued no suche supreme iudgement in the matter.
And thus you care not, may ye for the time shuffle out an answere, howe falsly or how contrary ye counterblast your false.
The nexte marke is yet further wyde from the issue, and more fonde than any of the other, for abandoning his Pope, and generall Councels.
VVhat can ye bring foorthe (sayth he) out of the olde Testament to aide and relieue your doings, who haue abandoned, not onely the Pope but generall Councels also, and that by playne acte of Parliament.
And what can you bring foorth, M. Sta. (to returne your wise demaunde on your selfe) for your pope his councels, out of the olde Testament? can ye finde your pope and his cardinals in councel there assembled? Uerily, then might ye haue béen much bolder than ye were right now, in your sacond marke, to limit your crake within a thousande yeres and vpwarde.
But thereby might ye soone haue marred the popes clayme fro~ Peter: so, that ye wan in ye hundrethes, léese agayne in the shire, and put your winning in your eye well inough, and yet sée neuer the worsse.
But ye will replie, that ye can bring proofe out of the olde Testament, how they acknowledged their highe Priest.
But what is this to the purpose, except ye proue their high priest, to haue had the same authoritie that your Pope doth clayme? For otherwise, so say we, our godly Princes do acknowledge their godly byshops, nor do abandon, but reuerence them.
Neuerthelesse, if those their byshops be wicked, they may remoue, depriue, or as ye cal it, abandon the~, or otherwise punish them accordingly.
Thus did king Salomon depriue or abandon Abiathar the high Priest.
And so if ye lyken your Pope to the Iewes highe Priest, then hath the byshop brought foorth profe out of the olde Testament, to confirme our Princes abandoning of your Pope: but muche more (if we consider these godly kings examples) the foresayde idolatrous priestes, suche as in déede al the Popishe priestes bée.
And also in reiecting suche councels as the Prophet, agaynst the naughtie priestes in hys time, speaketh of, Inite consilium, dissipabitur: Enter into counsell, and it shall be defeated.
But ye will say they are not like to your cou~cels.
Yet were they alike, then is proofe brought foorth euen by the olde Testament, agaynst your councels.
And wherin are they not alike, béeing both aduersus Dominum, Christum eius, agaynst the Lorde, and agaynst his annoynted? Sauing that herein they are not like in déede: those olde councels of the wicked priests, yea the councels of Caiphas, Annas, the high Priests, the Scribes, and Phariseis, that assembled so often agaynst Christ and his Apostles, were not halfe so craftie, malicious, and violent, as your Popes generall councels are.
Where, sauing the bare title of generalitie, is nothing but partialitie, violence, and bondage, and are nothing lesse than generall, as shall be further noted, where ye giue occasion further to speake thereon.
Now to that ye say the Quéene hath abandoned general councels and that by acte of Parliament, it is but your generall lie.
And your selfe very fondly without furder councell in your next wordes confute your owne tale.
For, going about to alleage such motines, as cause you to say that the Quéene hath abandoned generall cou~cels, and that by plaine acte of parliament: say this (say you) partely for a certaine clawse of the acte of parliament, that for the determination of any thing to be adiudged to be heresie, resteth onely in the authoritie of the canonicall Scriptures, and in the first foure generall councels, other councels generall, wherin any thing is declared heresie by expresse wordes of Scripture.
Is this the clause that moueth you M. Stapl. to say the acte of parliament abandoneth generall councels? this clause doth quite the contrarie, most plainly admitting acknowleging the authoritie, not onely of the first fowre generall councels, but also of all such other, as grounde them selues on the authoritie of the canonicall Scriptures.
Now what a reason call ye this: The acte of Parliament admitteth the determinations of the fower generall councels, and other councels generall: Ergo, generall councels be abandoned by acte of parliament? it admitteth them.
Ergo, it abandoneth them? Had not your braines admitted somewhat ouermuch, which abandoned all counsell and reason when ye framed this reason M. Stapleton? for by the like reason your selfe do abandon your Pope and generall councels also, bicause ye do admitte them.
Do ye not see therefore how fondly ye reason, and how falsly ye say, that the acte of parliament abandoneth generall councels, when it admitteth and receiueth generall councels, and reiecteth so litle any one true generall councell, that it admitteth also the determination of anything to be adiudged heresie by any generall councell, that the said councel can so proue to be heresie, by the worde of God? If the acte of Parliament attributeth thus muche to all generall councels, doth it abandon them? and will you require it shoulde acknowledge them further, than euen the godly generall councels themselues, in determinations of Heresies would be admitted? They alwayes layde before them, as their leuell and ruler the holy Scriptures.
And thinke ye they layde them forth for a cipher in Algorisme, as the Pope vseth them in his counsels? Or rather as Constantine the great in the Nicene counsell sayde: In disputationibus rerum diuinarum a fidei, in quibus tame~ habent sanctissimi spiritus doctrinam praescriptam, Euangelici enim Apostolics libri, nec non antiquissimoru~ prophetarum oracula planè instruunt nos quid de voluntate dei sentiendum nobis sit.
Nothing is more vnworthie than. &c. in disputations of diuine matters, and matters of fayth, wherein they haue yet prescribed to them the doctrine of the holy ghost, for the Euangelistes and Apostles Bookes, and also the Oracles of the most auncient Prophetes doe plainely instruct vs, what wee ought to thinke concerning the will of God.
Athanasius one of the same counsell, sayth: Quae in Synodo Nina patribus secundum diuinas Scripturas exposi sit fides suffuiens est, ad omnem omnis impietatis destructionem, ad confirmationem piae in Christo fidei.
That fayth is sufficient to all destruction of all wickednesse, and to the confirmation of a Godly fayth in Christ, whiche fayth was expounded of the fathers in the Nicene councell according to the diuine Scriptures.
And of this generall counsels authoritie, sayth saint Augustine, Nec ego Nicenum, nec tu debes Ariminense tan{que} praeiudicaturus proferre concilium, ne{que} ego huius authoritate, ne{que} tu illius detineberis, scripturarum authoritatibus. &c. Neither ought to alleage the Nicene counsell as giuing any forestalled iudgment, nor thou oughtest to alleage the cou~sel at Ariminu~, neither should be deteyned by the authoritie of this, nor thou of that, let the matter be tried by the authorities of the scriptures, &c.
And in this point S. Aug. is so earnest, that he woulde admitte no doctrine not proued by the Scriptures, but calleth it plaine fabling.
Ecce singere extra Euangelium est fabulari, For behold it is but fabling to faine ought besides the Gospell.
Neither herein doth S. Augustine thinke he iniured any councel, Ne{que} enim (saith he) quoru~lbet disputatione, &c. Neither ought we so to counte the disputations of any men what soeuer, how catholike or laudable soeuer thei be, as we ought to counte the Canonicall scriptures, in so much that might not (their honour which is due to those men, saued) improue or refuse any thing in their writinges· &c.
And writing to Paulina of the credite to be giuen to the Scripture: Alijs vero testibus, &c.
As for any other witnesses (saith he) or testimonies, whereby thou arte moued to beleue ought to be: it is lawfull for thee to beleeue it or not to beleeue it.
And so saith S. Herome, Quod scripturae sacr authoritatem non habet, eadem facilitate contemnitur qua recipitur: That that hath not authoritie of the holy Scripture, is as easily dispised as receyued.
So saith Chrysostome, Nullis omnino credendum nisi dicant vel faciant quae conuenientia sunt. scripturis sanctis.
Thou must beleue none, without they say or do those things, that are agreeable to the Scriptures.
If any thing be spoken without the Scripture, the knowledge of the hearers halteth, nowe graunting, now staggering, now and then detesting the talke as vayne, now and then as probable receyuing it.
But wheras the scripture is, there the testimonie of Gods voice commeth forth, both confirming the talke of the speaker, and confirming the minde of the hearer.
Let him reade the onely woorde, and on this commaundement let the christian religion meditate, and out of this scripture he shall finde the rules of all doctrine, to flowe, and to spring from hence, and hither to returne what soeuer the Churches discipline doth conteyne.
So saith Cyrill, Necessarium nobis est diuinas sequi liter as, in nullo ab earum prascripto discodere.
It is necessrie for vs to follow the diuine writinges and to swerue in nothing from their prescript rule.
And these Fathers, so all the Doctours be plaine, not to allow, much lesse to determine any doctrine, not onely contrarie but also besides the worde of God.
Nor the Auncient doctours onely, but also diuerse of the popish writers affirme, that neither the Churche, the Bishops, the Pope, nor any prouincial or generall cou~cel, hath powre to determine any doctrine to be true or false, otherwise than onely by the authoritie of the Scriptures, to declare them so to be.
So saith Thomas of Aquine, In doctrina Christs Apostolorum, &c.
In the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, all truth of faith is sufficiently layde forth.
Howbeit, to beat downe the errours of heretikes and of peruerse men, certaine opinions of faith ought many times to be declared.
And of the same minde also is your great captaine Frier Alphonsus de Castro, who attributing farre more to the popish Church and the Pope, than he ought to do, yet in this point after long disputation and argumentes on the matter, he concludeth: Nullo ergo modo, &c.
It can by no meanes therefore be, that the church may make any new article of faith, but that, the which before was the true faith and yet was hidde from vs, the churche by hir censure maketh, that it may be knowne vnto vs. Whereuppon appeareth, that my Lord Abbate did miserably erre, who expounding the chapter that beginneth Cm Christus, which is had in the booke of the Decretall epistles in the title de Hereticis, saith that the Pope can make a newe article of the faithe.
But he must be borne withall, being ignorant, nor well weighing of what thing he spake, this onely see must be laide in his dish, that he Iudged beyond the slipper: for it is not the office of Canonistes to Iudge of heresie or of faith, but the office of Diuines to whom Gods lawe is committed.
The Canonistes partes are to descant of the Popes lawe.
Looke they to it therefore, least while they couet to sit on both stooles, the taile come to grounde, as is the Prouerbe.
Thus sharpely concludeth Alphonsus against my Lord Abbate, and all popish Canonistes that would intermedle with writing in Diuinitie (I knowe not whether you Master Stapleton, were any such or n, but many of your site are euen such as he speaketh of) that woulde studie bothe the Popes lawes, and Gods lawes togither, and so lay them both in the duste.
Christi Behal? VVhat felowship is there betwene Christ and Belial? Thus writeth he, that neither the Pope, nor his nor the Church, can determine faith or hereie without the worde of God.
When you shall conferre the false doctrine, ye shall finde out the errour.
For the onely holy Scripture is the rule of the truthe, from the which whatsoeuer differeth, or doth contrarie, it is darnell and errour, in what countenaunce soeuer outwarde it come forthe.
For he that is not with me, is against me saith Christe.
Herevppon the Apostles and Disciples in the primitiue Churche, did dayly search the Scriptures whether they were so or no.
For oft time it commeth to passe, that that is iudged errour, which is not errour, and contrarie wise.
So Christe was Iudged a transgressour of the lawe, but if ye conferre him with the Scripture, you shall see he agreeth best therewith.
On the contrary, the traditions of the Phariseys seemed good, which not withsta~ding Christ conferring with the Scripture, plainly sheweth they are contrarie to the Scripture.
And therefore Dauid in all that octonarie desireth nothing els, but to be directed by the worde of God.
And the same Ferus in the eleuenth chap. of Matthew.
Baculus arundneus est quicquid extra verbum des traditur, &c. VVhat soeuer is giuen without the worde of God is a rodde of a reede.
For it is al onely the worde of God, which we may safely leane vppon, in so much that from hence thou mayst see what frowarde deceyuers they be, that for the worde of God would onely set foorth vnto vs their dreames, that is a rodde of a reede, Hereuppon the true Apostles gloried most of all on this, that they deliuered nothing but the woord of God, so saith Peter: Not following vnlearned bles, we make knowne to you the powre and presence of our Lord Iesus Christe, so Paule doth glory that he receyued not the Gospell of men, but by the reuelation of Iesus Christe.
Whereon he inferreth, if therefore any preache any other thing, let him be accursed.
As though he shoulde say· we haue preached the woorde of God, whereto ye may safely leane· accursed therefore be he, that for the certayne worde of God, bringeth a rodde of a reede, that is to say, mannes feigninges.
Thus hitherto agrée euen these Papists with the auncient Fathers, that nothing may be decided to be true or false, neither by Church, Councell, Pope, or any Man, nor any Angell, with out the authoritie of Gods worde, so to iudge and confirme the same.
But (say you) by this rule it will be harde to conuince many frowarde and obstinate Heretikes to be Heretikes, yea of such as by the foresaid fower first and many other Councels generall, are condemned for Heretikes.
As Dauid saide of the wicked, Illic trepidauerunt timore vbi non erat timor, They trembled there for feare, where no feare was: And as Esay saith, Possedit timor hypocritas.
Feare hath taken holde on the hypocrites: So are you M. Stapl afrayde of your owne shadowes.
For, except those frowarde and obstinate heetikes be your selues, that feare the iudgement of that cutting two edged sworde, to beate downe your traditions: no godly Christian neede to feare, or flee from the determination of the Scripture, or thinke it insufficient to detect and dtermine all Hereies.
Yet (say you) it wilbe harde to conuince there with many froward obstinate heretikes· As who shuld say, it would be easir to co~uince them, being so froward and obstinate with out the Scripture, and not rather a great deale harder.
Is it likelier that their frowarde obstinacie, will yelde to the authoritie of mans worde, that will not yelde to the authoritie of Gods woorde? but be it harde or ofte, what is that to the matter, if it will conuince their Heresies, be the Heretikes neuer so obstinate? This is inough to the purpose, that there is no hereie defended neuer so frowardly, of any obstinate heretike but the worde is able to conuince it to be an hereie.
Yea as Chrysostome saith, Nullo modo agnoscitur &c. them that are willing, to know which is the true church of Christ (from heretikes Churches) it is knowne by no meanes. modo per scripturas: but all onely by the scriptures.
And where ye make exceptio~ of such as were condemned for heretikes by the first fwre generall Councels: it is most euident, that as in all those Councels, the worde of God (as their line and squyre) was layde foorth amongst them: so they conuinced all thoe heretikes by the same.
Your common obiection hereto is of the worde [undefined span alphabet] which ye say in the expresse scriptures can not be found, but what saith S. Augustine to this: Quidest enim [undefined span alphabet] nisi eusdem{que} substantiae quid est inquam [undefined span alphabet] nisi ego pater vnum sumus? sed nunc nec ego Nicenum &c. VVhat is this worde [undefined span alphabet] but of one the same substance, what is say [undefined span alphabet] but and my father are one? but now neither ought to alleage the Councell of Nice, neither oughtest thou to alleage (as to giue fore iudgement) the councel of Aiminum, neyther should be withhelde by the authoritie of this, nor thou of that, but by the authoritie of the Scriptures, &c.
Thus doth S. Augustine both replie to you, that euen those Heretikes were confuted onely by the expresse Scripture: and also that for the Iudgement of Heresies, the authoritie of the Scripture is to be preferred, not onely before the prouinciall Councell at Ariminum, but euen before the first generall councell at Nice.
Neyther did S. Augustine declare their doctrine to be an heresie, bicause it was so determined by the generall councell, but bicause it was determined by the authoritie of the Scriptures.
And following this rule we are sure we can not erre.
For this is (as Dauid saith) Lucerna mes verbum tuum domine lumen semitis me is, Thy worde Lord is a candle to my feete and a light to my pathes.
On the contrary with out this light not onely the priuate fathers, but euen the councels, yea the generall councels, where they determined ought not grounded on the Scriptures, so litle could espie the heresies of others, that they erred foule them selues.
omitte the councell of Carthage wherein S. Cyprian was, how it erred in determining heretikes to be rebaptized.
The councell of Laodicea (whiche though otherwise was a godly councell) yet erred it farre, in disallowing and enioyning penaunce, for those that maried the second time.
And to speake only of generall councels, euen the first Nicene councell, how greatly was it like to haue erred in forbidding priests mariages, and the matter was alreadie passed by all the Bishops voices, had not one father Paphnutius bene, that made them retract their errour.
Which they did, not for any authoritie in him, being but one Bishop against so many Bishops, but moued by the authoritie of Gods worde that be alleaged, and from which they swarued.
And as they ha like to haue erred herein, so erred they in déede, in condemning those souldiours, who hauing once professed the faith of Christ, are prest for souldiours afterwardes.
Which is contrary to the rule of S. Iohn the baptist, that allowed the life of souldiours as a lawfull calling.
Neither doth Christ in the Centuri, nor S. Paule in Cornelius, in Publius, or any other captaines or souldiours, with whom he had to do, and by whose industrie he was often saued from daunger, and whome he likewise helped, did euer condemne the vocation of a souldiour vnder his Prince, as a calling not agreable to christianitie.
Likewise the cou~cel of Calcedo~, did wel in condemning Eutiches, but in forbidding mariage to Monkes, they erred from the expresse worde of God, that sayth: Mariage is honorable among all men, and that euery man might take a wyfe to auoyde fornication, and suche wickednesse not to be named, as monks since that restraint haue fallen into.
And to bring euen a Monkes, or an Abbots testimonie of your owne side, Panormitane sayth: Concilium errare potest, sicut alias errauit super casa matrimon contrahendi inter raptam raptorem, quando dictum Hironimi fuit postea toti concilio praelatum: councell may erre, as otherwise it erred concerning a cause of matrimonie betweene the partie rauished, the rasher, when as the saying of Hierome was afterwarde preferred before an whole councell.
And if ye referre this to a Prouinciall councell, the generall rule taken from S. Augustine will conuince you, that not onely Prouinciall councels are corrected by generall, but also psa plaenaria saepe prora posteriribus emendantur: oftentimes euen the former generall councels are amended of the latter councels.
But how soeuer this rule was true in S. Augustines dayes, since that time the latter generall councels haue ben worsse than the former, and so from worsse to worsse, are not onely become starke nought, but nothing general at al.
And therefore it is not onely lawfull to abandon them, but we are bounde so to do: as our Sauiour Christ warneth vs: Cauete vobis ab hominibus quontam tradent vos in concihabulis suis: Take heede to your selues of men, bicause they will betray you in their councels.
Suche councels did S. Paule abandon, when Fesus offred him to go vp to Ierusalem, and there to be tryed in the assemblie of the highe Priestes.
So Athanasius abandoned the councels at Lyre, Smirna, and Ephesus· So Maximus abandoned the Councell at Antioche.
And so we abandoned the Popes violent councels at Rome and Trident, that we might say with Dauid, Non consed consilio cum non introbo, odi ecclesim maligatium, cum impijs non edebo: haue not sitten in the counsell of vanitie, will not enter in with wicked doers, haue hated the Churche of the malignant, and will not sitte with the wicked.
but no generall Councels, wherein all things are tryed to be truthe or heresies, by the touche of the worde of God, and not by the Popes, the councels or any creatures dcree besides.
Omnis homo mendax, euery man is a lyer, and the worde of God is onely the truthe of doctrine.
And therefore in all Councels we must crie with the Prophet, Adlgem, ad testimonium Let them rnne to the lawe (of God) to the testimonie (of his worde) quod si on dxerint ixta verbum hoc, non ert eis
If the Councell declare any thing to be heresie, not according to the worde of God: the morning light, the of righteousnesse shall not shine on them, but they shall erre in the shadowe of death.
But sayth Ambrose, vs erare non possis, followe the pture, that thou mayest not erre.
And if the Councell do not follow them, we are made free from following, yea, licened to abandon and accurse those Councels by your owne Canons.
quis proht vob quod a Domino est, rurss impert fieri quod Dominus prohibet, exerabilis sit ab omnibus qui dilnt Deum: If any body forbid you that that is commanded of the Lorde, and agayne, commaunde that thing to be done, that the Lorde hath forbidden, lt him be accursed of all that loue the Lorde.
And your Abbote Panormitane willeth vs so to estéeme of your Councels without the scripture, that plus credendum vel simpli lco toti simul con: we muste more beleeue, euen a simple lay man alleaging the scripture, than all the whole Councell togither.
And your famous doctor Iohn Gerso Chauncelour of the vniuersitie of Paris, sayth, Prima verits stat, &c. this truthe standeth first, to weete, that any simple man beeing not authorized, may be so excellently learned in holy writ, that we muste more beleeue his assertion in a case of doctrine, than the Popes declaration: bicause it is euident, that we must more beleeue the Gospell, than the Pope.
Neither sayth he thus for the Pope alone, but euen for your Councels, yea for generall Councels, in sacris. &c. VVe must more beleeue an excellent learned man in the scriptures and alleaging the catholike authoritie, than we muste beleeue euen a generall Councell.
Thus by your owne doctors, yea by the Pope him selfe, that sayth, no proofe oughte to be admitted agaynst the Scripture, we may and muste abandon your Councels, wherein many things besides, and many thinges expressely agaynst the Scripture, are determined for truthe, and the expresse truthe of the scripture is condemned for heresie.
And therefore where ye say, we renounce them onely for this cause, bicause they grounde not them selues on the authoritie of the Scriptures: ye shewe a good cause to cleare vs of all heresies and errors, and shewe sufficient cause withall, why we admitte not your Councels nowe: your obstinate frowarde heresies to be suche, that ye can not aouche for them, nor defende them, by the holy Scriptures.
The authoritie whereof, if those your Councels doe aditte, as did the olde generall Councels, then the clause in the Act of Parliame~t doth no more abandon your Councels, than it reiecteth those foure firste, or any other, that grounde their proues thereon.
But ye haue some better reason belike, why ye set vp this fourth mark of abandoning the Pope and his councels, to be exemplified in the olde Testament.
Partly, and most of all (say you) say it for an other clause in the Acte of Parliament, enacting that no foreigne prince spirituall or temporall, shall haue any authoritie or superioritie in this realme, in any spirituall cause.
Either your fingers itche (master Stapl.) at this clause wherwith ye be pidling so often, before ye come to the proper place where this is handled more at large.
Or else ye do vse the figure of anticipation so mutch, and so impertinently, to puffe vp your counterblast withall.
But were it the chiefest cause why ye set vp this marke, bicause we reiecte all foraigne authoritie: then hath the Bishop hit this marke also at the full, euen in all these examples.
Excepte you can on the other side proue, that these godly Princes admitted in their dominions, the authoritie of any foraigne Prelate ouer them.
Of which, till you shal be able to bring profe, the commaunding and directing of their owne priestes (as is sayde before) yea euen of the highest Priest of all: is argument sufficient to inferre, that they admitted not any other straunge Priest ouer them (all straunge Priests then béeing heathen Idolaters) and therefore this clause of foraigne prelates, is also by the Bishop, out of the olde Testament fully proued.
But say you, The Popes authoritie ecclesiasticall is no more foraigne to this Realme, than the Catholike faythe is foraygne.
will beare ye witnesse, but ye shoulde proue it, and not say so onely.
Neuerthelesse, be it not foraigne, then is he not excluded by that clause, nor ye néede so storme thereat, that it should be the cause moste of all, why ye haue sayde all this, and nowe ye lyke it vvell inough, saying: And yet mighte the Pope reforme vs well inough for any thing before rehearsed.
Why rehearsed ye this clause then, and found most fault therwith, since those words hinder nothing his clayme? Sauing that (say you) he is by expresse words of the statute otherwise excluded.
How chaunce your quarell then, M. Stap. is not at that exclusion? But wilily ye sawe well inough, that he is exempted, euen in that he is a foraigne powre.
And had his name not bene exempted, yet the clause that before tkled ye so muche (though now ye would make so light thereat) did fully exclude your Pope, bicause he is a foraygne power.
Or elsefull fondly ye quarell moste at that, wherat ye had no cause.
Yes, say you, there is a cause why mislike this clause agaynst foraigne authoritie.
For then pray you if any generall Councel be made to reforme our misbeleefe, if we wil not receiue it, who shall force vs? And so ye see we be at libertie to receiue or not receiue any generall Councell.
And yet might the Pope reforme vs well inoughe for any thing before rehearsed.
Now surely M. St. and for any thing heere rehearsed by you, the matter is well holpe vp, and full clerkly haue ye answered your owne obiection· For first, where ye say: If any generall Councell be made to reforme our misbeleefe: Your obiection hangeth altogither on your accustomed presupposall, threaping this kindnesse on vs, that hauing reected your Pope, we must néedes be in misbelefe: and so reason forward, petitione princ that we muste be reformed therin.
Where otherwise, denying first this your presupposall, vrging the contrary, that the misbeléefe were on your party, in admitting the popes claime, al other his errors: then must ye begin a little higher to proue vs in misbeléefe, or else ye ca~ go no further, the fat is in ye fire, al your trim deuised inco~uenience agaynst this clause of the act, is dasht.
But bicause it were great pitie, that so good an heades inuention, in forecasting so great a peril, should not be herd throughout, let vs winke at your misbeleefe, in déeming misbeleefe in vs, and suffer you to tel on your tale, misbeleuing now with you that we are in misbeleefe, what followeth? VVe must be reformed, say you.
If any general Cou~cel be made to reforme our misbeleefe, if we will not receiue it, who shal force vs? And so ye see we be at libertie, to receiue or not receiue any general Councell.
Your argument, M. St. after your wo~ted maner, sta~deth al on ifs: If we be in misbeléefe, we must be reformed: if a general Cou~cel be made to reforme vs, we ought to receiue it: if we wil not receiue it, who shal force vs? if we wil not be forced, we be at libertie: if we be at libertie, we may reiect it: if we reiect it, we continue in misbeléefe: if we continue in misbeleefe, we shall be condemned.
One if, as is aforesayd, for an Oliuer to his Rouland, set against his first if, we be not in misbeleefe, had turned off al the other ifs.
But hauing admitted, we were in misbeléefe: is there none other remedie, M. St. but néedes a generall Councel must be called for vs? are we so obstinate, or is there none other meanes? yes, thankes be to God, where we haue bene in déede in misbeléefe, we haue bene reformed by our godly Princes, and that without a generall Councell.
Which speake not to the disprayse or dispising of generall Councels (although when they were better kepte than they be nowe, seldome they haue had good sequele, as the auncient fathers complayne on them) but speake agaynst the Popishe Councels, nothing lesse than generall nowe, and nothing lesse than reforming any errours, but violently so maynteining them, that true generall Councels (suche as in the olde tyme reformed errours) can not nowe be summoned.
And the Pope feareth, hindreth, and stoppeth by all his practises nothing more, than a very frée and generall Councell, suche as the foure first generall Councels were.
Of which sorte admitting there wer any called now, admitting also we were in arror, since that Councell would by the onely worde of God (for so did the auncient generall Councels) conuince our errour, we mighte well be reformed thereby, euen by these clauses that ye alleage.
For suche a Councell, where our Prelates them selues· aswell as any other of Christendome, mighte fréely debate the matter, were no forayne power to vs, or to any other Realme in Christendome: since euery Christian Realme shoulde haue his frée powre and libertie therein alike, to proue or improue by the worde of God.
And the clause of the statute abandoneth not, but admitteth and receiueth all such Councels either past or to come, that shall with suche fréedome, by Gods worde, conuince vs of any heresie or error that we misbeléeue vpon.
To say therefore, that by these clauses of the Acte, we set our selues at libertie, to reiect simply all generall Councels, it is but the libertie of your slaunderous tong, disposed to bestowe a liberall lye vpon vs.
No, M. Stap. we exempte not our selues from the authoritie and determination of any suche general Councels· But as we are ready to admit them with all Christian reuerence: so we hartily pray to God, once to sende suche an one, as by the infallible worde of God, might frankly and truely determine, whether our Princes we, or your Pope and you, mainteine these heresies, errors, and misbeléefe, that ye say we do.
The drift of your argument is this: there must be one to force vs: wherby ye meane your Pope.
Wherein ye rightly conclude in déede for his parte, that he is a forcer, that is (to speake playne English) a violent Tyrant, perforce to extorte of men, to yéelde to his partiall Councels.
But euen for this cause also we worthily reiecte hym and his force, with his enforced conuenticles, as no generall or frée Councels, nor orderly called, wherwith he hath by the fourme of olde Councels no more to doe, than other Bishops haue.
But now where ye say, yet might the Pope reforme vs well inough, for any thing before rehearsed.
Whether the Pope mighte reforme vs or no or howe he might do it, by any his owne authoritie ouer vs, or otherwise, is not yet M. Stapl. séene.
But what the Pope hath done, is manyfest: How he hath not reformed, but deformed, not only vs heretofore, and other places, but euen his owne Court, and him selfe also.
Let him first reforme him selfe, his Cardinals, his whores, his Stewes, his simonie, his ambition, his pride, his tyrannie, with other his innumerable abhominations, in life and doctrine (who by his clayme from Christ and Peter, should be an ensample and paterne of all godly reformation) and the~ let him moue the question, how we may be reformed.
This were a more formall waye for him, and for you also, M. Stap. (sithe you will néedes bée writing) to write to him hereof, ment ye to haue your countrey reformed in déede, not deformed by him.
And whe~ he hath reformed himself in al these things the~ write you ouer to your countreymen vnreformed, that the Pope might reforme vs well inough: for otherwise we can not but thinke he woulde reforme vs ill inough, that can not, or will not once reforme him selfe.
But think set ye to long a day, to write ouer to vs of his reformation.
Ye might tary M. Sta. til the Kalends of Gréece, or euer ye sée the Kalotes of Rome reformed by him, or any vice or error besides.
Well, say you, and yet he might reforme vs wel inough, for any thing before rehearsed.
ye not sée M. Stap. how fondly ye haue answered al your fode warbling? for if he might still reforme vs, for all those clauses rehearsed: why rehearsed ye them, since they were not agaynst him? why haue ye made suche a doe agaynst them? that by them we abandon him his councels since he and they bée in statu quo, in the state we were before for all them? Why do ye frame your argument on your iffs, of the inconuenience of our libertie thereon, if for all that we be no more at libertie fro~ him, than we were before? how were they ouershot that put those wordes in the acte that were to so small a purpose? or els how hath M. St. ouer shotte him selfe that hath traueled thus earnestly to reason against those clauses as most of all against the Pope, and when all is rehesed in them, are neither to or fro against him? The fifte false marke that ye set vp is this.
Now what can ye showe that mere lay men should enioy ecclesiasticall liuings as vsually they do among you.
This is partly one of the vsuall lies and sclaunders among you, to terme our Clergie mere lay bicause we be not of your Romish stampe, oyled, clipt, nor shaued.
But what is this to the question or issue of the state of supreme gouernment, if any such mere lay men haue crept into any ecclesiasticall liuings? pray you were not suche bothe men and boyes vnder your Pope also that enioyed ecclesiasticall liuings, and that with dispensation, and were no ecclesiasticall persons, otherwise than as ye call them studentes or clerks, and yet many of them no great clearks neither, but great ruffians not a few, yea some hauing abbeys, cardinalships, and bishopricks to the ricks as ye termed it before, they had, yet they were not ouer spirituall pastours.
But ye will say, they were not meere lay men· for at the least they had receyued, if not Benet Collet, yet Primam tonsuum.
As though the giuing them a notche in the head with a paire of made them the more spiritual or ecclesiasticall.
But doth not Florobellus confesse, that the Pope committit etiam mero laico, commiteth spirituall things vnto meere lay men? But what manner of spirituall persons the Pope bestowed his ecclesiasticall liuings vppon, Bernard writing euen to the Pope him selfe, doth partly declare.
Out of all the worlde there flocke vnto Rome ambitious men, couetous, Simoniakes, Church robbers, keepers of co~cubines, committers of incest, and monsters like men, and that by the Apostolicall authoritie to obteine or retayne ecclesiasticall promotions.
Thus wrote Barnarde of the holy spirituall company of those in his time that receiued and enioyed ecclesiasticall liuinges, euen of the Popes holy handes, foure hundreth yeres agoe.
And trow ye then, they haue not bene bestowed farre worsse since that time? He sayde of them in his time: Ipsa quo{que} ecclesiastica dignitatis officia· &c.
The ecclesiasticall offices also of dignitie are gone into a filthy lucre, and into an occupation of darkenesse, neither is there sought in them any health of soules, but riot of riches, for this they are clipped, for this they haunt Churches, they celebrate Masses, they sing Psalmes, for Bishoprickes, Archdeaconries, Abbeys and other dignities they striue at this day impudently, to waste the reuenues of the Churches, in vses of superfluitie and vanitie.
It remayneth that the ma~ of sinne be reueled, the childe of perditio~, not onely the day Diuel, but also the nooneday Diuell, who is not onely transformed into an Angell of light, but is extolled aboue al that is called God, &c.
Thus writeth he of your Pope, for bestowing his liuings so well.
But alacke Bernardus non vidit omnia, Bernard neuer sawe the horrible abuses that haue bene since, such liuings bestowed on Catamies to the maintena~ce of Sodomitrie.
But to let such buggishe abuses passe, except ye giue furder occasion: to speake of that that Kawline co~plaineth vpon, taking occasion of the tempter, taking vp Christ and setting him on the pinnacle of the Temple: In qua ostendit, &c. Wherein (saith he) he shewed that pride should destroy the Church of God, and the desire of honour, euen as now we see many, to flie vppon the pinnacle of the Churche, without the winges of science and life, and therefore the Diuell caried them.
And a litle after he faithe: Then the learned did slie, now the ignorant and children flie, like to chickens that will immediatly haue a combe so soone as they are out of the shell, these are noble men that wil be mytred and made Bishops being children and vnlearned.
For the Diuell doth many things that God would not do.
It is tolde, how that a certayne Germane hauing a very vgglie visage, would haue obtayned of the Pope a certaine benefice beyng vacant, but fearing he should not haue accesse to the Pope, neither would he reueale it to any body els, least he should be defeated of the benefice: came vnto the gates of the Popes palaice, and strongly rapping thereat, when the porter chaing with him, demaunded who it was that beate on the gates so mightely: the vggly Priest answered, am the Diuell, go tell the Pope that will speake with him, or else will enter perforce.
The porter trembling and astonnied, ranne and declared all to the Pope.
The Pope all trembling, open (quod he) the dore, or els he will enter, all we can not shutte him out.
VVhen he was let in, he came to the Popes presence, that trembled for feare: and fell downe at his feete, saying, most holy Father am not the Diuell, but bicause to gette my benefice, should not haue entered in the name of God, camme vnto you in the name of the Diuell, the Pope hearing this, quickly gaue him what soeuer he demanded.
VVhereby it appeareth that many are caried vppon the pinnacle of the Temple, more in the Diuels name than in the name of God.
Thus saith a famouse Monke and Preacher of your side, for the good enioying of ecclesiasticall liuings vsually among you.
This is a spiritualtie in the Diuels name, yet much better wereit, to be in the name of God a meee lay man: according as your owne Canons confesse: that oftentimes lay men are better than Bishops, yea your Bishops are no better than Dogs, Rauens, Wolues and Asses.
But you wil replie that these were abuses, true in déede, so they were.
Howbeit they were neuer better vsed, but euer worsse and worsse.
Come now to those that were counted no auses among you, but allowed: what say you by your ay brethren, among your holy ones of religion? Yea all the Monks that were in the old time, were counted ay· What say ye by the Templers, and after them the Knights of the Roades, and Prussia? but to let go them, and other brethren.
If it were demaunded, whether your Priests, Byshops, Caroinals, yea your Pope him self, with al his ecclesiasticall liuings, were any thing else than meere laye, and cleane without all spiritualnesse, concerning Gods spirite, thinke it would come to a Qu potest, and be a question disputable, whether his Holinesse, for al his triple crowne, and other ecclesiastical liuings titles, were any Byshop, or any member of Christs Church or no, euen by your ecclesiastical Canons, of which one beginneth: No~ omne episcopi sunt episcopi, al Byshops are not Bishops. &c.
Likewise Bernard the Canonist saith Spiritualis gladius ex leui causa non tantum per alios. &c. the spirituall Sworde, mouing and nourishing warres of a light cause, not only by other but also by it selfe, contrary to right, is become a souldiers Sword.
Erasmus saith, the Popes them selues are rather the successors of such as Iulius Caesar, of Alexander, Xerxes, Croesus, and of mightie theeues, than the Apostles successors.
And that there are none so pernicious enemies to the Churche as the wicked Popes, that suffer in silence Christe to growe out of knowledge, and tie him to gainefull lawes, and deflowre him with wrested interpretations, and murder him with their pestilent life.
Call ye these spirituall byshops, or rather as Christ said, théeues and robbers, painted sepulchers, rauening wolues, or as he called Iudas the Deuill him selfe? For why, beeing thus degenerate from the office of a Bishop, should they haue the name of bishops? as their owne law saith.
Si repriueris nec nome~ habere mereris, It thou want the thing· thou deseruest not the name.
And as Christe him selfe doth say, If the salte haue lost his saltnesse what shalbe seasoned therwith, it is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out to be troden downe of men: These are the spirituall Pastors of the popish Church, yeathe Popes them selues being worsse than lay men, and yet will be Lordes of all ecclesiasticall liuings, lay mens liuings too.
But will reserue this matter till ye be disposed to commune furder thereon, for they touch néerer the ouerthrows of your Popes claime, more decipher the hauiour of his Clergie, than they come néere the issue of the Princes gouernment.
The sixte marke that ye set vp is this: VVhat good induction can ye bring from the doings of the Kinges of the old lawe, to iustifie that Princes now may make Bishops by letters Patents, and that for such and so long time as should please them, as either for terme of yeres, monethes, weekes or dayes.
What an impudent and too too shamefull a sclaunderer you may be marked to be, appeareth by this marke M. St.
If Bishops haue their letters patents from the Prince, for their Bishoprike, had they them not also fro~ Princes, euen in the most popishe time? but that they are made for suche termes as ye write, you wilfully belie your Soueraigne.
The Prince in deede at all times, if they do not their dutie (and so shalbe thought vnworthie) may orderly remoue, inhibite, or punish them.
And of this the Bishop hath alleaged good proofe in the old Testament.
And yet if there were no proofe of it there, what matter can ye make thereon, that your Popes did not practise? who licenced, deposed, restrayned, limited, and that for such and so long time, as should please them.
As Florobellus saithe of the Pope, Item facere potest Praelatum ad tempus, He can also make a Prelate for a time.
And can ye finde such bulles of leade from the doings of the high Priest of the olde lawe? If ye can not, this marke ouerturnes your Popes supremacie, more than it commeth any thing nere the Quéenes.
VVhat good motiue can ye gather by their regiment, that they did visit Bishops and Priestes, and by their lawes restrayned them to excercise any iurisdiction ouer their flockes, to visit their slockes, to reforme them, to order or correct them without their especiall authoritie and commission thereunto, yea to restrayne them by an inhibition from preaching, which yee confese to be the peculiar function of the Clergie, exempted from all superioritie of the Prince.
For the former (so farre as ye say true) the Bishop hath gathered good motiues by their regiment, that they did visite Bishops and Priestes, and by their lawes restrained them, to exercise any iurisdiction ouer their flockes, to visit their flockes, to refourme to order and correct them, without their especiall commission therevnto, for what else was their ordeyning and allowing them, their commaunding, ordering, appointing and directing them? Except ye meane hereby (for ye spake it very subtlely) that the Bishops could do none of those functions, that belonged to their office, after they were appointed therto by the Prince, but that for euery thing they must haue a speciall commission: and than it is a captiouse sclaunder, the Prince doth not so.
But what belongeth to the Prince herein, and what to the Bishop, in either of their Iurisdictions: is to be considered in the fourth booke.
Sauing that still ye will augme~t your counterblast, by the way of preuention.
Your other parte of this marke, is a manifest sclaunder.
The Prince restrayneth no Bishop nor preacher with any simple inhibition from his office of preaching, but Secundum quid, inhibiting your popish seducers, from preaching their traditions and erroneous doctrines, such false Prophetes as Christ biddeth vs beware of.
If ye would preach the onely truthe, ye might haue good leaue to preache it.
Now, to stoppe the mouthes of false Idolatrouse Priestes, the Bishop in these examples hath brought good proofe hereof: no preaching is simplie forbidden, but Papistes, sectaries, and other of noughtie or suspected life or doctrine, and therefore where in the margine ye bidd your reader Note, here is nothing for him to note, but your notoriese lie, and your notable argument that ye make thereon: Preaching is the peculiar function of the Clergie exempted from the Prince: Ergo, The Prince hath not authoritie to restrayne a noughtie preacher, nor to inhibite him from preaching false doctrine.
Proue your argument a little better M. Stapleton, and then bidde vs note it, els is there litle to note in it, but much to note in you.
For your Eight marke say you: VVhat? thinke ye that ye can persuade vs also that Bishops and Priestes payed their first fruites and tenthes to their Princes, yea and that both in one yeare, as they did for a while in Kinge Henries dayes? Verely Ioseph would not suffer the very heathen Priests (which onely had the bare names of Priests) to paie either tythes or fines to Pharao their Prince, yea rather he founde them in time of famine vppon the common store.
This marke Master Stapleten, of paying first fruites and tenthes to the Prince, is bothe wide from the Bishops marke, and mere frinolouse.
For supposing they payde none, yet this supreme gouernement still remayned entiere and whole to the Prince: nor the paying it to the Prince, maketh him supreme gouernour any whitte the more.
It was an order taken, ye know, in the time of your Popes superstition, and that not long since neither, vnder pretence of helping the Church in hir warres against the Saracens, but in very déede to enriche the Popes coafers, although he claymed it, not by any title of Supremacie, but as the keper of the Churches hutche.
And since by continuance grew to an ordinarie custome, as a fée vnto him.
And afterwarde (his vsurpation here being remoued) this was also thought good, to be better and more profitably bestowed on our owne naturall liege, and true supreme gouernour within our owne realme, than on a foreyne vsurper, to mainteyne his whores and pompe, and to empouerish the realme, and beat vs with our owne goods.
And had it bene otherwise disposed, or remitted, the Prince not withstanding had bene full supreme gouernour.
But is it so haynouse a matter now for a Prince to receyue tenths or first fruites? did not pray you, euen by your Popes dispe~sations and bulles, Princes receyue them diuerse times before? and if they may receyue them with his bulles, why may they not receyue them (being giuen by order of the owners) euen without his bulles also? Now, sith ye can make no good argument on the ordinarie paying of tenthes or first fruites, to proue your Popes, nor to improue the Princes supremacie, thinke ye it a good reason to argue, from an extraordinarie facte on some occasion or consideration, to subuerte an ordinarie authoritie? You say they paide both in one yere to King Henrie.
Were ye not disposed to wrangle and misconster euery facte odiously, ye woulde not vrge your reason thus M. Stapleton.
For admitte ought were amisse therein by ouersight or euer the inconuenience were espied and amended, as after ye graunt it was; which was eue~ the next yéere following: what is this to the impayring of his supreme authoritie? if their receyuing of the tenthes and first fruites be allowable as euen your Popes haue allowed the same.
What ca~ye make of the double receipt? sauing that he receiued more than he should that yeare of dutie haue receyued, if ye make the worst of it.
And yet thereby it followeth, that he might haue receyued them, as he afterwarde did, and as the Prince now receyueth them.
But haue ye neuer redde of the Popes dubbling, trebling, quadrupling, and extreme excessiue encreasing of payments vpo~ payments, not one yere but euery yere, with continuall and vnsatiable polling of the clergie in times past? But this coulde ye not remember.
Your remembraunce serues ye like the hornes of a snayle, ye can stretche it out, and pull it in as it pleaseth you.
But the Chronicles that ye pretende to haue read, and quote so fast, cry out of the Popes vnsatiable dropsie, and infinite practises to get golde and siluer.
And where findes he suche priestly supremacie in all the olde Testament? The argument wherewith you confirme your marke agaynst the Princes receiuing therof, is yet more fonde and faultie.
Ioseph would not suffer the heathen Priests to pay either tithes or fines.
Ergo, The Christian Clergie muste not suffer themselues to paye tenthes or firste fruites to their Christian Princes.
This argument is more Heathenish than christianlike (M. Stapl.) or student like either, but good inoughe for the popish Clergie to grounde them selues vppon.
Thinke ye the doings of Ioseph in dealing with those heathen Idolaters, to be a fit rule to leel Christian Princes duties, towardes their Priests and people? or do ye thinke that Ioseph did giue this immunitie to the Priestes, more than to the people, to mainteyne those Priestes the better, bicause they were Priests, hauing onely the bare name of Priests (as ye say well therein) and so being false Priestes, and setters out of Idolatrie, that they should haue more immunities, liberties and wealth than others had? you will make Ioseph belike a very holy Patriarke.
But perchance ye haue espied a greater affinitie betwene those Egiptian Priests, and your romish Priestes than euery body was aware of.
And therefore ye reason substantially from their prerogatiues vnto yours.
Is it bicause ye fetche your shauen crownes from them, or at least that they had shorne heads as you haue? as witnesseth Alexander ab Alexa~dro, Apud Aegiptios qui sacra ministra~t sacerdotes capite rasi sunt.
The priests among the Egiptians that minister the holy sacrifices are shauen on the head.
Or is it bicause the most of your masking trinkets came from thence? or is it bicause of your Egiptiacall darkenesse and ignorance that ye kept all people in? or is it bicause all your religion lay in mysticall figures, and as they dispising ordinary letters, had their Hierogliphicall mysteries and signes, wherby they set foorth their meaninges: so you dispising Gods worde, and all good letters, your whole religion consisteth in mysteries, signes and gestures? or is it bicause the Egiptian priests Idolatrie, and the Popishe priests Idolatrie, is the grossest of all others, and the most bestiall? or is it bicause, as Rauistus Textor telleth, of the likenesse betwéen your religious Heremites, Anachor, Friers: and their priestes called Sarabaytae? of whom he sayth, Habitabant in foraminibus petrarum, induti porcorm boum pellibus, cincti funsbus, discalciati, sanguine cruentati, cauerni demum exeuntes papertatem abstmentiam predicabant, barbam spectante populo sibi perellebant, nummis{que} tali astu commeto adeptis, remeabant in suas speluncas, in summa laetitia furtim dapibus epulabantur.
They dwelled in the holes of rockes (like your ankers and recluses) clad with hogges skins and oxe hides (like your heremites) girte with cordes and barefoote (like your friers) besprent with bloud (lyke your Spanish whippers) comming abrode out of their dens they preached pouertie, and abstinence (like your limitors) they pulled away their beards in the sight of the people (like your popish shauelings) and by this craft and deuise getting money, they returned to their dens and in great mirthe they priuily made good cheere.
So like, the one almost in euery iote, is to the other.
Or is it bicause your Ladies chaplaines maiden priests, were so like the single priests of Isis? Or is it bicause your Nunnes were so like their women priests? or is it for that your priests haue claymed such authoritie aboue their princes, to take fro~ them their estates, and realmes, yea and their liues at their pleasures, as dyd the Ethiopian priests at Mere: of whome sayth Diodorus Siculus, Adeò superstitione impleuerunt hominu~ animos, vt no~nunquam misso nuncio, necem reg Aethiops demandare~t, nullo detractate, at mandatu~ issionemue abnegane.
Superstition did so muche fill the mindes of men, that the priests sending a messenger, would oftentimes commaund the king of Ethiopia to be killed, and nobody forslacked his co~maundement, nor refused his bidding Euen a right popish supremacie, M. St.
And thus they handled at their commaundement christian Princes, and the superstitions people were so bewitched, that none durst foresacke or refuse (euen agaynst their naturall Princes) to satisfie the tyrannie and commaundement of the Pope.
great many causes more mighte be suspected, why ye pretende so muche for your immunities, the priuileges of the heathe~ priests, they are so like vnto your popish priesthoode, but spare the reader.
Neuerthelesse, what cause soeuer moueth you to write so fauorably for the Egiptian Priests, none of these causes, or any other maintenance of Idolaters moued Ioseph: nor that any other suche lyke priesthoode to come, shoulde take hereat any suche prerogatiue, of béeing exempt from all fines to their princes.
The reason that moued Ioseph is apparant in the text.
He tooke the fift part of the peoples fruites, bicause before, they helde the~ not of their king: but the priests liuing was altogither of the kings gift finding.
And therfore they payed no portion to the king, but the king allowed the~ al the portio~ they had.
But this, yt al that they had to liue vpo~ was of ye kings gift, you quite forgat (which argueth their subiectio~ to him) ye reaso~ vpo~ their priuiledge.
Where ye shld note withal, that al those other their priuiledges liuings, came fro~ depe~ded on the king.
And the~ sée how fit a marke therby ye ca~ set vp, against the Princes gouernme~t ouer priests.
Your Ninth and last marke is yet more fond and confused than all the rest besides, wherin ye demaund of the Bishop, saying: Are ye able (suppose ye) to name any one king that wrote him selfe supreme head of the Iewishe Churche, and that in all causes aswell spiritual as temporall, and that caused an othe to the priestes and people (the nobilitie onely exempted) to be tendred, that they in conscience did so beleeue, and that in a woman prince to, yea and that vnder payne of premunire and playne treason too? Me thinkes ye play huddle now in the latter end, M. St. sixe or seuen markes togither in one: For the title of supreme head, for receyuing the othe, for the persons receyuing it, the persons exempted, the maner of receyuing it, the Princes person, and the penaltie of the refusall.
All these matters on a plumpe for haste, come in one liuerie, with the cognisance of your Ninth marke: how neere the issue betwéene the Bishop and M. Feckenham, remit to the view of others.
To all these demaundes, bicause ye are in hast, and therfore thrust them out on an heape togither, that the one might be a cloake to the other, will briefly answere them as they lye.
To your first demaunde, for the Title, thinke ye this a good argument: No king of the Iewes wrote this title of supreme head or gouernour: Ergo, No king of the Iewes was so? By the same argument, no king of Englande before king Henrie wrote him selfe, Defender of the faythe, neither any king of the Iewes wrote that tytle: Ergo, None of them were defenders of the faythe.
And by the same argument, your holy Father myghte léese a ioly Uicarige, that he claymeth from Christ and Peter, for neither of them wrote suche titles as he doth: nor the highe Priest in the olde Testament wrote any suche stile as he dothe.
But this is a vaine argument, if you can proue, not the title, so muche an the matter, the thing and effecte of the title to come from them to him: no man will stande with you in the stile, but graunt your Pope his clayme.
This can you not do, and therfore your Popetytle is but vaine.
But this, for the Princes supreme gouernment, the Bishop hath named the Princes in the olde Testament, and fully proued it: that in matter, thing and effect, they tooke vppon them this supreme gouernance, that the Quéenes Maiestie iustly claymeth now.
And this béeing proued, as before: till ye can improue this, what babble ye of the title? and yet since ye can bring no sufficient proofe of your Popes title neither, why maketh this argument more agaynst the Prince, than it doth agaynst the Pope? Your second quarell is at the othe, but the content therof (as is proued) béeing true, why ought they not to sweare therto: yea thoughe there were in the olde Testament no such ensample of an othe ministred by the Prince to hys subiects? And yet we read how Iosias swore al his subiects to the Lord.
But ye wil say, this othe is not for the Prince to sweare them to Gods religion, but to his estate.
If his estate be dutiful by gods religio~, is he not therby also sworn thervnto? And why then, may not the Prince for his more assurance, make an especiall othe thereof, so well as a generall? But was it lawfull for your Pope to sweare them to his vndue supremacie, and is it not lawfull for the prince in a matter so due vnto him? If you stil vrge, a playne manyfest ensample to be shewed you, where in expresse wordes suche an othe was then required: pray you (and you will not deale partially M. Stap·) shewe you another example, where the highe Priest of the Iewes, required such an othe of the Clergie, as your Pope dyd minister to those vnder him.
To that ye stande on the tendring the othe to the Priestes and the people, and to aggrauate the matter, as partiall, say, the Nobilitie be exempted: partely is fonde, and partely false.
For, the Nobilitie, or any other, in certayne offices are not exempted.
But see the proude orgulous harte of this Priest, howe he picketh quarels agaynst the Noibilitie, bicause heerein they haue any prerogatiue ouer his priestly order.
But he maketh a matter in that the othe is, that they in conscience did so beleeue, as thoughe they coulde sweare therto, and can not beleeue it in their consciences.
Belike master Stapleton your popishe Priestes make good othe, and haue good consciences and beléefes, that can sweare to a thing, and haue no conscience: or can haue conscience, and not beléeue it so to be as ye sweare.
It is to be feared that some of your order haue so done.
Whether you haue done so or no, will not say, for knowe not your dealing, nor am ouer curious to search out your olde reckonings.
But thinke some of your good masters are not all in cleane life thereof.
Your outcrie at a womans Prince to haue thys Tytle, yea and that (say you) in a woman Prince to: sheweth your impudent spite agaynst your most gracious soueraigne, and withall, your impudent follie.
If a Prince, Master Stap. and why not a woman Prince to? Will ye graunt hir to be a Prince, and take from hir the duty, that these ensamples shew, doth belong vnto a prince? Therefore, eyther ye muste denie that a woman may be a prince, or else graunt this authoritie, yea to a woman prince to.
And doth not the Scripture commende, yea a woman Prince to, to suppresse Idolaters and tyraunts, to gouerne and iudge Gods people? And why may not now a woman Prince to, deliuer vs (as the Quéenes Maiestie hath done) from the yoke of a greater tyrant, and all his Idolaters to? and punish to suche obstinate and trayterous resisters of hir godly power, as you and your sect are to? yea and that vnder paine of premunire and plaine reason to? These are the Nine markes which master Stapleton setteth newe vp.
Of which howe wise soone be, howe slaunderous other some, and howe wide all be from the ue in question: remitte to the indifferent Readers iudgement.
For mine owne part, as sawe the shamelesse dealing of this student, studying with all his endeuour oelude the Bishops ensamples, and to deceyue the Reader with these tryfles: so was halfe ashamed to haue answered them any thing, being altogither vnworthie of any aunswere, knowing that to the wise, folly detectes it selfe.
But least any one shoulde be deceyue by this false ayme giuer, haue somewhat more largely shewed his dealing in these markes, than otherwise would.
And yet as the impudencie of this man may further moue occasion, hereafter hée may perhappes heare more than he or his fellowes would that all the worlde shoulde sée.
Onely nowe it sufficeth to haue shewed the insufficiencie of his argumentes, and to haue cleared from his cauillations, these ensamples of the Bishops, recorded in the old testament.
Wherof the Bishop mencioned not one, that proued not Master Feckenhams demaunde and issue: Any such supreme gouernment, as hath the Queenes maiestie.
And therfore M. Stapletons conclusion, is like the residue of his Nine markes, if it be not rather most fonde of all.
And sauing his rhetoricke, rayling, scoffes, and his vaine triumphing before the victorie, is nothing else but wordes of course.
Master Horne (sayth he) your manifolde vntruthes are deciphered and vnbuckeled, ye are espied, ye are espied, say, well ynough, that ye come not by a thousande yardes and more nigh the marke.
Your Bow is to weake, your armes to feeble, to shoote with any your commendation at this mark: yea if ye were as good an Archer, as were that famous Robin Hoode, or little Iohn.
VVell, shift your Bowe, or at the least wise your String.
Let the olde Testament go, and proceede to your other proofes, wherein wee will nowe see if you can shoote any streighter.
For hitherto ye haue shotte all awrie, and as a man maye say, lyke a blynde man.
See nowe to your selfe from hencefoorth that yee open your eyes, and that yee haue a good eye, and a good ayme to the marke we haue set before you.
If not, bee you assured wee will make no curtesie eftsoones to put you in remembrance.
For hitherto yee haue nothing prooued that Princes ought, whiche ye promised to proue, or that they may take vppon them suche gouernement, as haue layde before you, and suche as ye must in euery part iustifie, if eyther ye will M. Feckenham shall take the othe, or that ye entende to proue your selfe a true man of your worde.
This were a hard matter for you to proue your selfe to be Master Stapleton, a true man of your worde, hauing nowe béene taken tardie in your wordes with so many open lies.
And euen here with no lesse impudencie, ye would haue the Bishop in euery part to iustifie, not such issue as he ioyned in with master Feckenham, but such as you in euery part do falsifie.
Did the Bishop promise to master Feckenham, to proue that Princes ought or maye take vppon them such gouernment as you haue layde before him? Or did master Feckenham request any suche proufe? or not rather, Any such gouernment as the Queenes maiestie doth clay me and take vpon hir.
This is the right marke that they haue set before them, and not these markes that (say you) we haue set before you.
But ye néede not assure vs hereof master Stapleton, we will beleue you without assurance, that ye know little curtesie, and can make lesse, nor ye will make any if ye coulde.
Little curtesie (except butcherly curtesie) haue we felt of your stiffenecked and frowarde generation, and lesse we looke for, and none we craue at your vncurteous vnmercifull hands, although more mercie and curtesie be shewed to you.
Yet though ye assure vs of no curtesie, yée might and should assure vs of truth and honestie: of which if we can haue no assuraunce of you, be ye assured againe, master Stapleton ye shall get as little credite, as we shall get little curtesie.
But to winne you better credite: in your vaine triumphant conclusion, ye knit vp al your Nine marks with Robin Whood and little Iohn, lacking but one of your Popes Courtisanes, and some Louaine Franciscan, to haue played Frier Lucke, and mayde Marian, and so to haue made vp the full messe.
Might not a man say for (O M. Horne) Master Stap. these toyes are full vnsitting and nought to the purpose to or fro.
And for al ye cry he shootes awrie lyke a blinde man, thoughe a blinde man can not sée to shoote, yet could a béetle blindman both heare, and thinke small wisdome, in suche great boast, and well perceyue, that the onely turning of master Stapleton, for master Horne, would hitte you so little a wrie, euen with your owne wordes, that there néedes no further aunswere.
NOwe where the Bishop alleaged out of the olde testament all these foresayde ensamples: and master Feck. vnder the pretence of Christes gospell, restrayning himselfe to the new Testament, goeth about thereby, to clude and shake of all the Bishops ensamples of the olde Testament: The Bishop proueth this to be the very shift and practise of the Donatistes, denying that Princes ought to entermeddle in ecclesiasticall matters, as now ye Papists denie the same.
Who when they were vrged by the learned fathers Saint Augustine and other, with suche like ensamples as the Bishop hath alleaged out of the olde testament, they reiected them, and would haue all examples restrayned to the newe testament, as here doth master Feckenham, which the Bishop sheweth to haue bene (as Saint Augustine calleth it) An odious and wicked guile of the Donatistes: and thereon concludeth, that eyther he must shunne suche heriticall shiftes, or else, that following the very error, defence, shift and paterne of the Donatists, he bewrayeth him selfe therein to be a couert Donatist.
The effect of master Stapletons Counterblast to this, is deuided into sixe partes.
The first, is an inuectiue against the order of the Bishops writing.
The second, is a clearing of master Feckenham to be no heretike.
The thirde, is a returning of his charge of heresies to vs.
The fourth, an enumeration and conference of diuerse heresies with oure doctrine.
The fift, a reuersing to vs of the crime wherwith master Feckenham is charged to follow the Donatists, in diuerse pointes resembling vs to them, and them to vs.
The sixt and last, a remouing of those motiues, whereby the Bishop charged M. Feckenham to play the Donatists part.
In the first part, or euer he enter into the matter, he maketh as it were a Preface agaynst the Bishops dealing, which is twofolde: the former, for procéeding in his matters out of order.
Hither good Reader (sayth Master Stapleton) Master Horne althoughe vntruely, yet hath hee somewhat orderly proceeded.
But in that which followeth vntill we come to the.
leafe, beside most impudent and shamefull lyes, wherewith he woulde deface master Feckenham, he prosecuteth his matter so confusedly and vnorderly, leaping in and out cannot tell howe, nor whether: that verily thinke that his wittes were not his owne, being perchaunce encombred with some his domesticall affayres at home, that he could not gather the~ togither, or that he the lesse passed, what an hodge potch he made of his doings, thinking which is like, that his fellowes Protestantes woulde take all thinges in good gree, knowing that poore master Feckenham was shutre vp close ynough from all aunswering.
And thinking that no Catholike else would take vpon him to answere to his lewd booke.
To that ye beginne with, master Stapleton, to chalenge the Bishop for vntruth, yea, most impudent and shamelesse lies: till ye name them, and so proue them, the best answere thereto, is to giue it a wispe, and place it in your common places of scoldes blacke rhetorike, and so let it alone.
As for the Bishops vnorderly proceding, (howbeit ye confesse that hitherto he hath somewhat orderlike proceded) in that which foloweth, ye say he prosecuteth his matters so confusedly. &c. that you thinke his wittes were not his owne.
Were not your wittes ouermuch your owne, M. Stap. you woulde neuer wittingly haue let your witte cast forth such vnwittie and vnorderly speaches to your better.
But will say somewhat yet more gentlier of you: that verily think herein your wts were altogither your owne, and therfore ye are the more to be borne withall.
Otherwise, if your wittes had taken the aduice of some other of your confederates wittes, they woulde perchaunce haue counselled you more wittily, not to accuse any of such fowle confusion, disorder, leaping in and out, and making an hodge potch: and not tell at al wherein he confoundeth or disordreth his matter.
And they woulde peraduenture withall haue aduised you, to marke this rule your selfe, and to beware that you alleage euery thing in his proper place, not to wrappe vp in a clutter so many things vnder one, nor to make one thing to séeme so many.
Not to preuent your matter so oft before it come, nor to repeate it so often being ast, all to encrease your volume.
Many other things about your co~mon places they would perhaps haue tolde you, if ye had taken some of their wits to counsel and not to much haue trusted on your owne, they would at the least haue charged you, not to chalenge another for wit, (your self therin being nothing comparable in al wise mens iudgements, euen of your own side that know both him and you) least while ye stande so much on witte, ye shewe your selfe not so wise as wittie, not yet so wittie as your selfe wéene ye bée, or your friendes and for my part woulde wishe ye were, so that ye employed it better than ye do.
The coniectures that ye gather of his disorder, that he was encombred with some his domesticall affayres at home, that he thought his fellowes protestants would take all things in good gree.
That M. Feckenham was shut vp close ynough from answering.
That he thought no Catholike else woulde take vpon him to answere his lewde booke: All these are nothing else but the lewde imaginations which that wittie pate of yours hath maliciously conceyued M. Stay.
The thirde quarrell is: That the Bishoppe procéedeth not nowe to the newe Testament.
had thought, Master Horne (say you) that from the olde Testament, yee woulde haue gone to the newe Testament: and would haue laboured to haue established your matters thereby: belike the worlde goeth verie harde with you in that behalfe, that yee doe not so: sauing that here and there yee iumble in a testimonye or two, can not tell howe, but howe vnhandesomelye and from the purpose, yea agaynste youre owne selfe, that woe well, and ye shall anon heare of it also.
Yea, well sayde Master Stapleton, and tell him so to, let him heare of it throughly, both here and there to, for so you shall the better encrease your Counterblast.
But will ye tell it him anon in verie déede? Then pray you, where, and howe, master Stapleton, will you tell it him? Where? euen here and there, where he iumbleth in a testimonie or two, can not tell howe.
Can ye not tell how master Stapleton he alleageth them? then thinke ye will answere them ye can not tell how, full vnhandsomly and from the purpose, can ye tell what? Well, had thought master Stapleton, your wits being your owne, they had bene more circumspect than perceiue they be.
And that your memory could haue made one lye, to haue hanged better to another.
For howe hanges thys togither: ye will answere him, where here and there he iumbleth in a testimonie or two, out of the newe Testament: and that ye say: had thought master Horne, from the old Testament, ye would haue gone to the newe Testament, and would haue laboured to haue established your matters therby, belike the worlde goeth very harde with you in that behalfe, that ye do not so? When your selfe euen in the next words confesse, that he dothe so out of the new Testament also.
Heere and there (say you) he iumbleth in a testimony or two.
Wherfore doth he this, but to labour to establish his matters therby? Tushe say you, he dothe it but heere and there a testimonie or two.
Had it bene but one testimonie, M. Stap. it had bene inough to proue you a lyer: nor the truthe, nor force of the truth, consisteth in numbers of testimonies, one true testimonie were inough, had he no more.
But ye confesse, he had a testimonie or two, yea and that here and there a testimonie or two, and thinke, when ye cast your account, there will be founde more than thrée or foure, so agayne proue your selfe a lyer.
Howsoeuer he iumble them in, M. St. beware you they tu~ble not out your cause, for the iumbling in of the~, hath proued you already to haue mu~bled vp a lye, a contrtion to your owne tals.
But ye say, he did it, ye can not tell howe.
And therfore as sayde before, ye coulde not tel how ye answered, nor how ye contraried your selfe.
For howsoeuer he did it, he did therin go from the old testament to the new testament, which you both denie graunt, ye can neither tell how, nor where, nor what.
And therfore to conclude with your owne words, belike the world goeth very hard with you in that behalfe.
For shame, M. Sta. vpbraide not their wits vnto others, so much ouerthte your own.
The seconde part is the clearing of M. Feckenham to be no heretike, consisting on two parcels, the one altogither on rayling and scornes.
In the meane while (say you) it is worthe the labour, well to consider the excellent pregnant witte, and great skill of this man, who hath in the former treatise of master Feckenham, espied out (which surely the wisest and beste learned of all the vvorlde, trowe, besides master Horne, vvould neuer haue espied, suche a speciall grace the man hathe giuen him of his master the Diuell, of meere malice, ioyned vvith like follie) that M. Feckenham is an heretike and a Donatist.
Whosoeuer be the Donatist, euery reader may sée, how M. St. sheweth him selfe a playne scoffing Lucianist, vaunting his wit, and despising all others, like a perte Pharisée, in the meane season, answering nothing to the matter.
And therfore let this go to his proper common place.
The other parcell is to cléere M. Fe. by occasion of that the bishop saide, he bewrayed his secrete heresies.
But yet (sayth he) M. Feck. is somewhat beholding to him, that he sayth M. Fe. hath bewrayed his secret heresies: wherin he sayth for the most part truely, for if there be any heresie at all in this matter, surmised vpon him, as certenly there is none, it is so secret and priuie, that Argus him selfe with al his eyes shall neuer espie it, no nor M. Horne him selfe, let hym prye neuer so narrowly.
Were it euen so secret as ye deuise master Stapl. yet béeing secret, then it is: contrary to that ye affirme (as certenly there is none) whereas certenly there is one, and muste néedes be, if it be secrete.
Yea and be it a greate deale more secrete than ye wéene, thoughe Argus wyth all his eyes coulde not espie it, yet there is an espier, euen he that saw the Pharisies thoughts, and sercheth the reines, and from whom no secrets are hid: he that séeth al your secret practises conspiracies, euen he séeth all your secrete heresies.
Tush say you with the wicked, the Lord séeth not.
But, he that made the eye, shall he not sé? Yes, M. Sta. he séeth them, and hath so detected them, that there néed no Argus eyes.
The bishop séeth them, and sets them out, that all the world may sée stare vpon them: Yea thanks be giuen to the opener of all secrets, this Donatisticall dealing in reiecting the princes authoritie in eccl. matters, and M. Feck. refusal of the examples of the olde testament: if there were no body else to reueale the same, not onely M. Feck him selfe hath ope~ly bewrayed, but M. Dorman also, and other your complices.
Although therfore ye thinke ye be not espied, bicause ye daunce in a net, and play boopéepe, séest me, séest me not: yet this your dealing bothe bewrayes it selfe, and is dayly more and more made apparant by others, to the view of all mens eyes.
The thirde part of this answere is a retorting of this crime of heresies vnto vs. VVherfore on the other side (saith he) M. Horne and his fellowes, and his masters Luthers and Caluines heresies, are no secret nor simple heresies, but so manifolde and so open, that they haue no way or shift to saue their good name and honestie, blotted and blemished for euer (without repe~ta~ce) for the obstinate maintenance of the same.
VVherof many were many hundreth yeres since condemned, partly by the holy fathers, partly by generall Councels.
Nothing of this béeing hitherto proued, but barely auouched, it may stande (M. Stap.) for words of course, till ye bring some profe therof.
As for that ye adde in distinct letters, howe the Byshop sayth: The Donatistes are the Catholikes ancestors: ye depraue the bishops words to aggrauate the matter: he spake the quite contrarie, that the Donatistes were rather ye Catholikes enimies, who rising agaynst them, yet clothed the~ selues with the name of catholikes, as do you like vnto the~, neither of ye both, papists nor Donatistes, being catholike, otherwise tha~ as told ye before, of your catholike hostesse at Oxeforde: a catholike woman, that is to say, a common queane.
The bishop saide, that herein M. Feck. was a Donatist, and so he proueth him, till you shall improue it.
In which chalenge he strayeth not from the butt, of the princes supreme gouernment.
And hauing occasion therin, to note his like subtile dealing, to elude all the examples of the olde Testame~t, he chargeth him therwith, goeth no further, as you do, shooting so wide fro~ the marke without any eye or aime therto, which right now in your ruffe ye called vpo~ so hastily, and now so soone your selfe haue so farre forgotten, that where ye should couch you only to this matter, wherin M. Feck. not impertinently is burdened, and you are hired to cleare him: ye let go the clearing of him, snatch occasion thereat, to charge vs agayn with a nu~ber of other heresies.
Good sir (say you) may it please you fauorably to heare, you and your masters honorable pedegree, and of their worthy feates and prowesse.
You haue heard of them before perhaps, and that by me.
But suche thinges as may edifie the Catholike, and can neuer be answered by the Heretike, Decies repetta placebunt.
How should your booke, M. St. arise to so faire a volume, but by such vaine extrauagant tenfolde repetitions.
But ye say, ye will repeate them so often, bicause they may edifie the catholike, and can neuer be answered by the heretike.
Whosoeuer be the catholike, it is to be feared some of them will detecte your selfe, to be the heretike that ye meane we be.
To that ye say, we can not answere them, thoughe we haue heard of them before, and that by me, say you: this is but your fonde vaunting of your selfe, and of your paltrie workes, M. Stap.
All which is besides the matter here in question, and therfore deserueth not the answering.
Howbeit, for the most parte, as it is obiected often and full péeuishly, by other likewise of your side: so is it answered agayn on our part, as yet remaynes vnanswered vnto of you.
Neuerthelesse, bicause either the importunitie of your extréeme craking, might séeme to enforce a furder answere: or else your gentle mockery, and buxome entreatie, might not seeme worthie to be reiected, saying so curteously, good sir may it please you fauourably to heare you and your maisters honorable pedegree.
Go to therefore M. St. though it be altogither impertinent, let vs heare a Gods name what ye haue to charge vs with, and we will sée, how we can answere thereto: and shall we say as you saide before? sée ye lie not, for it ye do, be ye assured we will make no curtesie eftsoones to put ye in remembrance.
Though ye spake those wordes to him, of straying from the marke, and here your selfe stray so farre therefrom.
To come therefore to the fourth parte, which is a rerecharge to vs, of a number of auncient heresies.
How say you then (saith M. Stapl.) to the great heretike Aerius the Arian, that said there was no difference betweene Priest and Bishop, betweene him that fasted and that did not fast, and that the sacrifice for the dead was fruitlesse? Howe say you to Iouinian that denied virginitie to haue any excellencie aboue Matrimonie or any speciall rewarde at Gods handes? to the Arians that denied the miracles done at Saints tombes to be true Miracles, and that the Martyres can not cast out the Diuels, and relieue them that be possessed? To the Bogomiles that said the Diuels sate at the Saints tombes and did wonders there, to illude and deceyue the people, to cause the people to worship them? To Berengarius condemned in diuerse Councels, first for denying of the Real presence in the Sacrament of the Altare, and then for denying the Transubstantiation? To the Paulicians, that said these woordes of Christ, take, eate, this is my bodie, are not to be vnderstanded of his bodie, or the bread and wine vsed at the celebration of our Lordes maundie, but of the holy Scriptures· which the priestes should take at Christes hande, and deliuer and distribute to the people? To Claudius and Vigilantius, that denied the inuocation of Saintes, and enueighed against the blessed reliques, and the vse of lightes and other ceremonies of the Church? To the Massilians and other heretikes, saying that concupiscence as a sinne remaineth in vs after holy baptisine? And bicause ye shall not say, suppresse, conceale, or obscure, the chiefe and most notable persons of your auncestrie: how say ye to the Emperours Philippicus, Leo, Constantinus, condemned with their adherentes by the seuenth general Councel at Nice, that villayned by defacing, breaking and burning, the images of all the holy hallowes of Christ, and Christes to? to whome for your more honour and glorie adioyne the Emperour Iulianus the Apostata.
VVho, as ye do in your bookes and pulpits, cried out vppon the Christians.
ye wretched men, that worship the wood of the Crosse, setting vp the signe of it vppon your foreheads and dores: you therefore that are of the wisest sorte, are worthy to be hated, and the residue to be pitied, that treading after your steppes come to such a kinde of wretchednesse? To the Pelagians affirming that children not Baptised shalbe saued? and yet are your Maisters in this point worse than the Pelagians, aswell for that some of them haue saide, that some infantes though vnbaptized shalbe damned, and some other though vnbaptized shalbe saued.
And some of them especially Caluine and other Sacramentaries say, that they shall come without Baptisme to the kingdome of heauen: which the Pelagians durst not say, but that they should haue the life euerlasting, putting a difference, but peeuishlie, betwixt these two.
And if ye thinke the race of your worthie generation is not fetched high inough, we wil mount higher, and as high as may be, euen to Simon Magus him selfe.
Of whome Marcion and Manicheus, and after long and honorable succession your Patriarches, Luther and Caluine, haue learned their goodly doctrine against free will.
Yea to touche the very fundation and wellspring of this your new Gospell, which altogether is grou~ded vpon Iustification without good works, in that also ye draw very nigh to the said Simon Magus.
In all this, here is nothing els, but the heaping vp, of an impertinent, slaunderous, and maliciouse rable, partely of Heretikes, partely of no Heretikes, some of them falsely belied, most of them falsely applied, eyther they defending no such things, or some of these us Heresies, nor any of their Heresies mainteyned of vs.
First for the Arianisme of Aerius with whom M. Stapleton beginneth, would God the Papistes had not as much, defaced the glory of Christ, as did the Ariaus, but he findeth no faulte with them therefore.
First that Aerius said, there was no difference betweene Priest and Bishop, and ye ae (M. Stapleton) how say we to him? What soeuer we say to him, we haue first to say to you, that sauing the reuerence of your Priesthood, there is no difference betweene you and a lier, to obiect Aerius herein to vs: Whereas (ye know well inough) our Church doth acknowledge in the ministerie, a difference of Deacon and Elder, from a Bishop, although not according to your Popish orders.
For as neyther Epiphanius, nor yet Augugustine (quoted by you) speaketh there of any sacrificing Priest, so he neuer knewe any such Pontificall prelates as your Popishe Churche bréedeth.
And yet of those that were euen then in Epiphanius time, and of their difference from the Elders or Priestes, if ye know not how it came: Hierome that liued in the same age will tell you, or if ye haue not redde him, your owne Canons will tell ye what he saithe.
dem est ergo Presbyter qui Episcopus antequam Diabols studia, &c.
An Elder or Priest therefore is the same that a Bishop, and before that the studies of the Diuell were made in Religion, and that the people saide holde of Paule, of Apollo, of Cephas, the Churches were gouerned by the common Counsell of the Elders, but after that euery one did accompt those to be his, and not to be Christes, whome he had Baptized, in all the worlde, it was decreed, that one of the Elders being chosen, should be placed aboue the rest: to whom all the care or charge of the Church should belong, and the seede of scismes be taken away.
Sicut ergo Presbyteri, as therefore the Elders know that they by the custome of the church, are subiect to him, that is set ouer them: so let the Bishops know, that they, more by custome, than by the truth of the Lordes dispe~sation, are greater than the Elders.
This was the iudgement of the auncient Fathers, yet were they no Arians, nor Aerians therefore.
Yea Peter Lombarde the maister of the sentences, citing also Isidorus to witnesse, saith: Apud vetere idem Episcopi Presbyter fuerunt.
Among the auncient Fathers, Bishops and Elders were all one.
And againe alleaging the Apostle S. Paule, he saith, Qualis autem· &c.
But what manner an Elder ought to be chosen, the Apostle writing to Timothie declareth, where by the name of Bishop he signifieth an Elder.
And anon after: Cum{que} omnes, and when all of them (he meaneth his false seue~ orders) are spirituall and holy, yet the Canons account only two orders to be excelling holie, that is to say, Deaconship and Eldership.
Bicause the primitiue Churche is redde to haue these alone, and we haue the Apostles commaundement of these alone, for the Apostles in euery Citie ordeined Bishops and Elders.
Neyther the Master only writeth thus, but almost all your schoolemen, yea though they be them selues of the contrarie opinion, yet they write this was the auncient opinion.
And so Durandus, though he make a difference betwéene the power of Iurisdiction, the power of order, yet he sheweth that both the Scripture, S. Hierome maketh no differe~ce, but only the custome institution of the Church.
saith: With the Bishops and the Deacons, by them vnderstanding the Elders, sith in one citie as in Philippos, many Bishops ought not to be.
he saith, Looke to your selues and to all the flocke in which the holy ghost hath placed you to be Bishops.
And he spoke vnto them of the onely citie of Ephesus.
Where he saith for this cause haue left thee at Crete, that thou shouldest correct those things that want, ordeine Elders through out the cities, eue~ as haue apointed to thee, if any be blamelesse the husba~d of one wife.
And streight he setteth vnder it, a B. must be blamelesse.
And who~ before he named an Elder, he calleth now a Bishop.
to Timothie, Dispise not (saith he) the grace of God which is giuen to thee through the imposition of the handes of an Elder, that is to say of a Bishop.
S. Paule called him selfe an Elder, when he was the Bishop that ordeined him.
Thus far more at large Dura~dus, concluding at le~gth, Sic ergo.
Thus therfore saith S. Hierome, that a Bishop and an Elder.
Olim fueru~t nomin synonym, &c. were in the old time diuerse names betokening one thing indiffere~tly, and also of one administration· bicause the Churches were ruled by the commune Counsell of the Priestes.
But for the remedie of a scisme, least each one drawing the Churche after him, should breake hir: it was ordeyned that one should be aboue the rest, et quad nome~, &c.
And so far forth as stretcheth to the name, that he onely should be called Bishop, and that so farre as stretcheth to the administration of some Sacraments and Sacramentals, they should be reserued to him by the custome co~stitutio~ of the Church.
Dist. cap. legimu in Esa. super epistolam ad Tit. recitatur Dist.
Olim presbyter &c. Consuetudo aut institutio Ecclesiae potest dare Iurisdictinem sed non potestatem ordinis aut consecrationis, quare. &c.
He therefore that counteth this erroneouse or perilous, let him impute this to Hierome, out of whose saying in the fore alleaged chapter, Legimus in Esa. the foresaide authorities are take~.
VVhere also he putteth an exa~ple, That it is of a Bishop in respect of priests, as of an Archdeacon in respect of Deacons: vnlesse the Deacons choose one among them selues whom they call Archdeacon &c.
In the end Dura~dus reco~ciling Hierome saith: and the authorities alleaged by Hierome withstande it not, bicause according the name and the truth of the thing, euery Bishop is an Elder: and on the other parte, so farre as stretcheth to the name, euery Elder hauing cure, may be called a Bishop, as superattendent on other, although the consecratio~ of a Bishop, or of the chiefe Priest, be larger than of a simple Priest or Elder: but peraduenture in the pimitiue Churche they made not such force in the difference of names as they do now.
And therfore they called a Bishop euery one that had a cure.
And will ye compt him or them Aerians too? And this also doth your institution in Coaine Councell confesse, on est tamen putandum.
VVe must not for all this thinke, that he ordeined Bishops another order from Priests, for in the Primitiue church Bishops and Priests were all one.
The which the Epistles of Peter and Paule the Apostles, S. Hierome alo and almost all the au~cient ecclesiastical writers do witnesse.
And chiefly that place of the first Epistle of S. Peter the ist chapter, is euident to declare this.
For when Peter had said, The Elders that are amo~g you, also an Elder with you beseech, which am also a witnesse of the passions of Christ, and pataker of the glory to come that shalbe reuealed: He ioyned vnder it, Feede or guide the slocke of Christ that is among you, and ouersee it, not by compulsion, but willingly, according to God.
VVherein it is spoke~ more expresly in the Greeke, [undefined span alphabet], that is to say, Superattendent, from whence also the name of Bishop is drawne.
VVherefore Priesthood is esteemed the highest order in the Churche.
In the meane time, no bodie is ignorant, that this order is distinguished againe, by a certayne order of offices and dignities.
Thus do your Schoolemen and Diuines witnesse: First, that in the Substance, Order, or Character as they terme it, there is no difference betweene a Priest and a Bishop.
Secondly, that the difference is but of Accidents and circumstances, as degrées of dignitie, Iurisdiction, Honour, &c. Thirdly, that in the Primitiue Church, this difference was not knowne, but they were méerely all one and the same.
Fourthly, that this difference was taken vp by custome, consent, and ordinance of the Uniuersall Church when it once began to be dispersed in al the world.
Fiftly, that it was done for the auayding of factions and sectes that grewe in the time of the ministers equalitie euen anon after the Primitiue Churche, and some of them in the Apostles time.
But quite contrary to this Iudgement of your Diuines, are all your Canonistes, your Diuines make seuen orders.
Et in hoc saith Angelus de clauisio, concordant co~muniter theologs.
On this the diuines agree commonly, but the Canonists holde, that there are nine orders according to nine Hierarchies, that is to wite, the first notch or psalmist, and the order of a Bishop, and that the first notch is an order, the text is in C. cum contingit ibi do.
Anto. canonist de quali. or. similiter quod Episcopatus est ordo quod imprimatur Caracter indiio meo facit inconuincibiliter, tex. in C.
de ordinatis ab Episcopo &c. sic secundum Canonist as erunt nouem ordines.
And so according to the canonistes there shalbe nine orders.
Great ado your Scoolemen and Canonistes make about this, in so much that Aerius heresie will draw verie néere to one of you, light on which side it shall.
But your selfe may holde on both sides M. Stapleton, being both a Bachelour in the one, and a student in the other.
As for vs, ye do falsly burden vs. Our doing is apparant therein, acknowleging all due obedience and reuerence to our Bishops.
But as for your Popishe Clergie, there is in déede litle differe~ce in this point or none, which barrell is better herring, B. or Priest, both starke nought, or rather neither of them eyther true Priest or B. by S. Paules description.
Secondly, you obiect that Aerius said there was no difference betwene him that fasted and him that did not fast: wherein also as in the other, your conscience (haue ye any) knoweth, that ye wittingly slaunder vs, and babling of fast, do lie as faste as a dogge doth trotte.
For we allowe Bbb. ij. and commende fasting as godly, exhorte all men thereto as néedefull.
Onely we inueigh agaynst the superstitions of the Popish fastes, that binde fasting to necessarie and superstitious lawes, to difference of dayes and meates, wherin the kingdome of God consisteth not, that ascribe a merite to their fast, and make it a matter of conscience and religion.
Such errours we disalowe, and if this be heresie, the Apostles, and the chiefest of all the auncient fathers, were heretikes also, who made concerning conscience, no difference of meates, or of dayes for their mmates, in their fasting.
Montanus the heretike, sayth Apollonius, was the first qui docuit nupias solus qui orum leges primus imposuit.
That taught the dissolution of mariages, and first of all appoynted lawes of fasting.
For before it was frée to fast as they woulde.
As Ireneus (blaming Pope Uictor for his pertinacie, in being the authour of such a schisme, for diuersitie of vsing the feast of Easter) doth witnesse Non solum. &c.
Not onely (sayth he) the controuersie is mooued of Easter day, but also of the very forme of fastinges.
For certaine do thinke that fast shoulde be kept but onely one day, other two dayes, other more.
Yea many fast fortie dayes, but so that they recken the day accompting the howers of the day the night togither.
The which varietie of keping their fast, began not first now, nor in our times, but long before vs, of them (as deeme) who not retayning simplie, that which was deliuered from the beginning, haue afterwarde fallen into another custome, either by negligence or by folly.
Socrates writing further of this diuersitic not onely of fasting times, but of the meates also, saith on this wise.
Sed etia~ ciboru~. &c. but of the meates also they haue not the like abstinence, for some altogither abstain from liuing creatures.
Other of liuing creatures eat only fishes· some with fishes do eat foules also, saying that these (after Moses) haue their substance of the water.
Some will eate onely drie bread, some not so much as that, some fasting vntill nine a clocke, are refreshed without any difference of meates.
And bicause there is no auncient recorde found therin, thinke the Apostles left this to the mind of euery man, that euery man might do that that is good neither by feare, nor by necessitie.
In which testimonies are to be noted: first the frée libertie for euery Churche to fast as they thought good, without any feare of conscience, or any necessitie enforcing them therto.
Seco~dly, that this libertie, was both in the time of fasting, and in the meate, without any difference of fishe or fleshe.
Thirdly, that this was the order of the Apostles, and the primitiue church.
Fourthly, that they which began to alter this custome, and to binde them selues to dayes or meates, swarued from the beginning by negligence or folly.
But after Montanus the heretike began first to prescribe lawes to fasting, many superstitions ensued: Some began to haue scruple in eating flesh, as Bishop Spiridions weary ghest, before whome when he set a piece of porke on a fasting day, his ghest refused to eate therof, Christianum se profitente, bicause he was a Christia~.
To who~, quoth Spiridion, propterea magis refutare non debes: Euen bicause thou art a Christian, thou oughtest the more not to refuse it.
For all things are cleane to them that be cleane, as the vvorde of God hath taught.
But for al this, after Montanus lawes, superstition began to grow so faste, that euen Hierome, a great co~mender of fasting, was fayne to exhort them to moderation, yea, to crie out theron: Tantum tibi. &c. Appoynt vnto thy selfe such a measure of thy fasting, as thou canst beare.
Let thy fastings be pure, chast, simple moderate, not superstitious.
VVhat auayleth not to tast of oile, and to seeke for dayntie meates, and harde to come by, puddings, pepper nuttes, the fruites of palmes, meale, hony, craknels, all the trimming of the gardens is tossed, that we should not feede on common bread.
And thus, while we seeke delicates, we are drawne quite from the kingdome of God.
Yea, besides this, heare say of some, that co~trarie to the rule and nature of men, wil drinke no water, nor eate bread, but delicates, suppings, and chopped pot herbes, and the iuice of Beetes, nor will not suppe it in a cuppe, but in a shell.
Phie for shame, Blushe we not at these toyes? do not these superstitions irke vs? If Hierome cried out thus in his dayes of such superstitions fastings, and yet be no heretike, are we heretikes that crie out of the popishe superstitions, a thousande partes more toyishe than in Hieromes time, and a thousande times more delicate knacks founde out to fast forsooth withall? But as the saying is, shewe me not the meate, but shew me the man.
Looke vpon your chief fasters, your popish chaplaynes, your religious monkes and Abbots, what gorbelly paunches, what fat chéekes, what riche noses and highe faces, your stalfed fasters had? they shewed well what porrige they loued, in so muche that Aerius made not so little difference betwéene a Priest and a Bishop, as euery man made lesse difference betwéene a Monke and a burstenbelly churle.
Euen Chawcer that describeth a Monke, doth giue him this prayse, He looked not like a forepyned ghost, fat swanne he loued best of any rost.
Suche were those that euen by profession prete~ded to be chiefest fasters, when they had filled them selues till they swet agayne, with all daintie viandes, then they cried hold belly hold, quantu~ patimur pro amore Christi, what paines we suffer for Christes sake.
And yet bicause they eate no fleshe, no not an egge on a fasting day, excepte it were in Aduent, the inwards, tripes, and trullibubbes, for that was no fleshe, we muste vnderstande: they were holy catholike fasters.
And bicause we reiect these foolish toyes, and superstitious fastes of these bellygod Epicures, they crie out vpon vs, we are Heretikes, we are Aerians, we make no difference betweene him that fasteth, and that fasteth not.
But as héerein ye slaunder vs, so ye béelie Aerius also, and that euen by the iudgement of your great champion Alfonsus de Castro, who alleaging S. Augustine to witnesse, sayth: Non dicit. &c.
He sayth not that he quite contemned fasting, but he ascribeth this vnto him, onely that he shoulde say, certayne appoynted fastings are not to bee obserued but eche one should fast when he woulde, least he should seeme to be vnder the lawe.
Aerius therfore speaketh not agaynst fasting, but onely agaynst the lawes of fasting, by no maner meanes admitting, that the Churche can binde vs to fast, bicause, although fasting be healthfull and profitable to the soule, yet vvill he not that any should be constrayned.
Thus sayth Alfonsus of Aerius opinion for fasting, and not as you say, master Stapleton, that he made no dyfference betvveene him that fasted, and that fasted not.
Whereas Aerius made a great difference, and Alfonsus cleareth him of that you accuse him.
But howsoeuer Alfonsus in the other poynt (wherin you let him go frée) accuseth Aerius by S. Augustines testimonie: if he altogither contemned all maner of fasting ordeyned by the Churche, then are we cleared from béeing charged with him, for we refuse onely the superstitious necessitis of the Popishe Churches lawes.
As for the true Churche of Christe, if vpon any occasion, some lawes of fasting should be made by hir, toll vs where we haue sayd, we would contemne them.
Yea, it is apparant we yéelde obediently to those lawes of fasting ordeyned by the Quéenes Maiestie, and hir realme, the Churche of Englande: whiche be not superstitious fastes, nor binding the minde of the faster with any necessitie of conscience, but made for the necessitie and policie of the Realme, and state of our countrey.
And if the whole Church of Christ, ordeine like lawes for fasting, we shewe hereby how little we would with Aerius despise the same: but we with the word of God, and with the true Church of Christ in the Apostles times, in the Primatiue age, and in the auncient fathers dayes: reiect all suche superstitions in fastes, as the Popishe lawes and customes burden the Churche withall.
And thus dothe euen S. Augustine (that noteth Aerius) writing to Casulanus agaynst one Urbicus in Rome, who would haue it obserued for a lawe, and made a foolish booke theron, that men should fast on Saterday and other dayes, saying that Peter did so, (whom he calleth) as the papistes do, the head of the Apostles, the porter of heauen, and the foundation of the Church) when he conuicted Simon Magus.
Augustine improueth this tale, by Peters concorde with all his fellow Disciples, that vsed no suche faste.
And after long prouing and improuing, he concludeth thus: Si autem quontam huic quantum potus, &c.
But (bicause thinke haue answered this as sufficiently as could) if ye aske my sentence hereon: reuoluing it in my minde, do see that in the Euangelicall and Apostolicall writings, and in the whole instrument that is called the new Testament, fasting is co~maunded.
But on what dayes we shoulde not fast, and on what dayes we should fast, finde it not defined by the commaundement of the Lorde, or of the Apostles.
And by this, deeme that fasting agreeth fitter, not in deede to obtayne righteousnesse, which fayth obteineth, wherein is the beautie inwarde of the kings daughter.
&c. Howbeit in this fast or dinner on the Saterday, nothing seemeth to me heerein to be kepte more safely and quietly, than that he which eateth, dispise not him that eateth not, nor he which eateth not, dispise not him which eateth.
For neither if we eate, we shall abounde, neither shall we want if we do not eate.
That is to say, while we keepe companie with those among whome we liue (and with whome we liue to God) without offence taking in these things: For as for that the Apostle saythe is true, it is ill for the man that eateth through offence, so is it ill for the man, that by offence doth fast. &c.
Thus farre saint Augustine agaynst the precise appointing of fast on the Saterday, in whose time it was frée for euery Church to vse hir owne custome.
Yea, as he concludeth with aunswere of Ambrose hereon: VVhen am at Millaine fast not on the Saterday, when am at Rome, fast on the Saterday.
And to what Church ye come keepe the order thereof if ye will neither giue, nor take offence.
Thus we sée, first how the fastes of the Church of Rome, were no such lawe to all other Churches, to receyue from hir their order or dayes of fasting, or else they had bene Aerians: for then had both S. Augustine Ambrose to, béene Aerians by master Stapletons rule, and by the Popes obtrusion of his Churches fastes, to all other Churches nowe.
But the Church of Millayne euen vnder his nose, besydes those of Affrick, were at that time of contrarie orders.
Secondly, as it was of Saterdayes fast, so was it also for Fridayes fast, or any other daies or day, as appeareth by Saint Augustines generall rule, in appealing to the Scripture, and there finding no day at all appoynted.
As he sayth afterward againe, Sed quoniam no~ inenimus &c.
But bicause we finde not (as haue rehearsed aboue) in the Euangelicall and Apostolicall writings, which properly perteyne to the reuealing of the newe Testament, that on any certaine dayes it is euidently commaunded we should keepe fastes. &c. Thirdly, that what dayes soeuer they did kéepe fast, they did it not as any meritorious act, to obteyne righteousnesse thereby.
For this was the difference that the Papists put, betwene him that fasted and that fasted not, which is a thousand partes worse heresie than was that of Aerius.
aske none other witnesse herein, than euen one of your owne side, Frier Ferus, who inueying agaynst the Phariseys for ascribing righteousnesse to their sacrifices and ceremonies: But wee (sayth he) do all things preposterously, placing righteousnesse in these things, which of themselues are neither good nor bad: neglecting those things wherein true righteousnesse consisteth.
For from hence followeth, first, that we make to our selues a greater conscience of the transgression of the Churches or Monkishe decrees, than of the transgression of the diuine precepts.
Secondly, hereon it commeth, that we easily iudge other that obserue not the same, as here did the disciples of Iohn.
VVhen Paule notwithstanding teacheth: let no man iudge you in meate or in drinke, or by reason of a feast day. &c. Item, he that eateth not, let him not iudge him that eateth. &c.
To conclude, it is farre an other thing to doe the worke, than to put a trust in the worke.
It is good to fast and to keepe the Churches decrees, but to put a trust in them, is not only not good, but wicked.
For this cause therfore Christ required not fasting, other bodily obseruations, he exacted not of those that are his, or prescribed ought at all of these things, not that he iudged such things of the~selues to be euill or vnlawfull, but that they should not all thither againe, that is to were, to a trust of workes, from whiche he woulde haue them most farre.
The which surely had chau~ced, if he had exacted any such thing of those that are his, as nowe we perceyne is committed in the Churches constitutions.
For euen as sone as euer these co~stitutions began to be giuen, men began also therwith to trust in them.
And so by little little we haue degenerate from true godlinesse, into a kinde of Pharisaical righteousnesse, or rather into a shew of righteousnesse, the which is more cleare than that it can be denyed.
And afterwarde complayning further of the Popishe fastes and other abuses, he sayth: His similes sunt pleri{que} nostrum. &c.
The most of our men are like vnto these (he meaneth the Phareseys) that iudge they keepe the lawes then, when they follow externally the letter of the law, when they do nothing lesse, as appeareth by them that are ydle on the feast dayes, and giue themselues to ryot, neglecting those thinges that are perteyning to the Sabaoth.
Of those also that thinke they fast, when they eate but once a day, but so daintilye, and they so glutte themselues, that they feele no hunger all day long.
On the contrarie, they iudge not him to fast, but to transgresse the commaundement, that compelled by pouertie, necessitie, or labour, doth eate but sparingly often tymes a day.
And a little after: These thinges doe flatly fight with the doctrine of Christ.
For first it impugneth the fayth, secondly charitie, which two Christ did chiefly touch.
For this cause therefore he doeth so often blame them.
But if we marke our selues, we shall see our selues to be euen the most culpable in the same thinges.
For commonly our righteousnesse is set most in outwarde thinges.
damne not outwarde thinges, for who hauing his right wittes woulde or coulde so do? But say they suffice not to saluation.
And as sayd a litle before, of the precept of keeping the Sabaoth, two things are commaunded.
First, the bodies rest, secondly and principally, the rest of the old man from his workes: so say now, euery precept requireth two thinges, that is to wete, the outwarde worke, the heart, that principally, which Christ declared inough.
But wee neglecting that which is principally exacted, do stick onely in the externall things.
The same may say of the ecclesiastical co~stitutions, they giue not holinesse but shewe it further it, as for ensample, true religion consisteth not in this, that thou shouldst weare, this or that habit, but in this, that if thou be dead to the world, thou liue to god: to this point, outward things do also not a litle further thee: so the true worship of god is, if that in spirite and truth thou worship the father.
The same also is to be said of fasting, co~fession, prayer.
But we neglecting these things which are most necessarie, do please our selues about the outwarde things onely.
Thus sayth Ferus of your Popishe fast, conteyning farre worse errors than Aerius not putting of difference, but belike he shalbe an Aerian to.
The third thing M. St. obiecteth to vs out of Aerius, is that he sayd the sacrifice for the dead was fruitlesse.
If you were not also dead and fruitlesse, for any trouth in you Master Stapleton, ye would neuer make such a lying sacrifice of your Priestes lippes for shame.
As though Aerius were counted an Heretike, for denying the propiciatorie sacrifice (as ye call it) of the Masse, which ye say is auaylable and meritorious, not onely for the liuing, but also for the deade, to deliuer them from the fayned paynes of purgatorie.
Whereas if he had affirmed at that time any such thing, he should himself haue bene counted a straunge and new monstrous Heretike.
For as then, nor long after, neither your pardons and indulgences, nor your trentals and Diriges, neyther your satissactions nor your oblations, neither your Masse of Requiem, nor your soule Priestes to sing or say it, were extant or deuised.
Errours in déede there were about the dead, both then and long before, and suche as after gaue occasion to these your gainfull deuises.
And if Aerius had denyed such errours, or such errours had then bene practised, he had béene no Heretike for denying them, but rather such Heretikes as had mainteyned them.
Which the godly fathers did not, but acknowledged and knew of no other place, eyther of ioy or torment after this lyfe but onely of heauen and hell.
thirde place (sayth Saint Augustine, that writeth of thys Aerius) Penitus ignoramus, VVe are vtterly ignorant of, nor we can finde any such in the scriptures.
And yet must Saint Augustine néedes haue knowne and acknowledged such a thirde place of deliueraunce of the deade, if he had ment of prayer and oblation for theyr deliuerance as you do meane.
But he flatly denieth the knowing of any such place: it followeth then, that wryting thus of Aerius, either he was in the same Heresie, denying any place for the dead to be holpen out of, (and wherto then should such praier serue, or oblation for deliuering them out of a place of torment, since there were no such place of torment) so he confirmed Aerius his saying: or else he must runne yet into a greater error and absurditie, that the deade being in one of these two places heauen or hell, they were there holpen by such prayers and oblations.
But for those that are in hell, the scripture is flatte, their worme shall neuer die, their fire is vnquenchable and euerlasting, the riche Glutton coulde not get from thence, nor finde any neuer so little ease from his torments.
And this knewe saint Augustine well ynough, that sayth: Duae quippe habitationes, vna in igne aeterno, altera in regno aeterno.
There are two dwellings the one in fire eternall, the other in the Kingdome eternall.
And againe: Scitote vos. &c. Knowe ye, that when the soule is parted fro~ the bodie, streightwayes either it is for his good deedes placed in paradise, or else certainly for his sinnes, cast headlong into hell fire, choose nowe that you like, either to reioyce euerlastingly with the Saints, without ende to be tormented with the wicked.
This was the foule and great errour of Origene, Saint Augustine was not infected therewith, nor any godly father of his time, muche lesse Epiphanius, that was an earnest condemner of Origene.
Although the Papists be not cleare of this errour, that say they haue deliuered, and can deliuer soules euen out of hell, as they tell howe Pope Oregorie deliuered Traian an infidell Prince: and howe his mother (condemned and tormented in hell fire for hir whoordome) was deliuered from thence by him through a trentall of Masses.
Nowe as for the soules that on the other side be in heauen, the other place: thinke Saint Augustine was neuer so farre ouershotte, to say or thinke that such prayers coulde ease or deliuer them from paynes, that were in the ioyes of heauen.
We shall the better perceyue this, if we marke the errours that many of the Grecians and Egiptians, had at that time about the dead, yea euen those sayth Epiphanius, Qui primas sib ferre videntur. &c.
That among certaine exercisers of godlinesse in Egipt, seemed to beare the chiefest sway, and also of those in Thebaida and other Regions, that denied the resurrection of the bodie, Et Graeci quidam. &c.
And certaine Grecians there were that vtterly denied the resurrection.
On the other part there were some that grau~ted it, but with very fond and straunge opinions, that partly they had receiued of the heathen Philosophers, partly they had deuised of the~ selues.
For this hath bene alwayes one of the deuils chiefe practises, to abuse and deceyue the liuing by the dead.
affirme, by worshipping the pictures of the deade, sprang all Idolatrie, and therefore the Deuill stryued so muche for the bodie of Moses, as diuerse learned fathers note thereon.
And of all errours, the most auncient are those that haue sprong about the deade.
As with the Saduces among the Iewes before Christes comming, by other among the Corinthians in S. Paules time baptising ouer the deade, and these aboue sayd Heresies in the east Church.
As likewise in the west, by thrusting the communion bread into the mouthes of the dead, by conceyuing opinions of their estate such as they had learned out of Plato and Uirgill, of their paynes and torments, of their ease deliuerance whom they loued and wished well vnto, of whom sayth Saint August.
Humana quadam beneuolentia mihi falli videntur, and as euen Epiphanius sayth, Quum vero tales via vera discesserint, veritatem dei ad fabulas conuerterint: VVhen such men swarued from the true way, and conuerted the truth of God into fables, Such as Origens conceytes and allegoryes were, such as the morals of Oregorie are full of, suche as the Heretikes fathered of the Apostles names, Saint Peters Gospell, Saint Thomas Gospell, Nichodemus Gospell. &c.
Then no marueyle, if not onely the Heretikes had ill opinions of thedeade, but also some of the godly and learned fathers in this behalfe, were eyther somewhat deceyued, ouercuriously searching and affirming, that they knewe not, or caryed to muche away with the sway of the peoples abuses.
Yea and by his leaue, though he were an excellent and godly wryter, yet in this poynte Epiphanius somewhat ouershotte himselfe.
Althoughe speake it not to accuse him, nor to excuse Aerius, for no doubt as Aerius was an open Artian, that denyed the diuinitie of oure Sauiour Christe: so conertly he shotte herein agaynst the resurrection with the foresayde Heretykes, as appeareth by Epiphanius his confutation of him.
Who not onely confuteth him, but also sheweth why at that time they vsed suche an order for the deade, whiche in the latter ende of the Booke, shewing the diuerse rytes of the Christians in his Countrey then, he expoundeth what it was: In his autem qui vita defuncti sunt, ex nomine memorias faciunt, orationes ad deum perficientes ac cultus diuinos mysteriorum dispensationes.
But as concerning those which are deade, they make memorials by name, while they make their prayers to God and diuine worship and dispensing of the mysteries.
That is, in their publike prayers of the diuine seruice, and receyuing the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, they made a thankefull memoriall of suche as were departed in the fayth of Christ, giuing God prayse and thankes for them, to confirme the fayth of the lyuing in the hope of the deades resurrection.
Now, that they ment not by these doings, any such deliuerance out of paynes of Purgatorie, or any such other thing as the Papistes dreame of, and woulde deceyue the people withall: Epiphanius himselfe doeth plainely declare, not to muche regarding what the Heretyke did pretende, as what hée mente to destroy the hope of the Resurrection, and béeing an Artian to abase the prefection of Christe: Postea verò (sayeth hée) de co quòd proferantur nomina defunctorum. &c.
But afterwarde, concerning that the names of those that are departed this life, ae brought foorth, what can be more profitable than this, what more commodious than this, and what more worthie admiration? that these that are present, beleue that they which are departed do liue, and are not none, but they are, and are liuing with the Lorde.
Whereby it appeareth that those prayers, were principally to confirme the hope of the immortalitie of the soule, and the bodies resurrection: and rather confute the Heresie of Pope Iohn.
than confirme any Popish Masse or Dirige for the deade.
Notwithstanding, for that that followeth, Epiphanius is not altogither excusable, though to be borne withall, more than you beare with him for rending the picture of Christ, and not suffering so much as an Image on painted cloth, no not of Christ himselfe, to stande in the Church, although it serued but for the vse of a vayle.
What would he haue done trow you, if he had come into one of your Churches, all to be dashed with Images, not onely painted on cloathes, but carued in wood and stone? no doubt he would haue broken them all to fitters, and haue cryed out on your open Idolatrie.
And so, had he seene what horrible errours and superstitions, your Church mainteyneth about the dead, and that his wordes should after haue giuen occasion, to pretende in his name a defence of suche superstition: vndoubtedly hee woulde haue tolde you to your faces, that you wrested his wordes, and abused him, and were farre worse your selues than euer Aerius was: and woulde (as did Saint August.)
haue reuoked such wordes, as whereby ye shoulde haue picked any such occasion.
But he foresawe not this, as he saw the other.
But rather (as ye say afterwarde of Nicephorus) was caried away in the sway of the common errour, and so defended that which ye nowe pretende to boulster your errours by.
As for any authoritie for this vsage, such as it was, Epiphanius alleageth none at al, out of the word of God: yea, and that was more fonde in the doing, he sayth, they prayed for the Patriarkes, Prophetes, Apostles, and Euangelistes.
Wherin ye will graunt, am sure, M. St. both your selfe and your Church doth swarue from him.
And your owne Popes Decrée sayth, Iniuriam facit martyri, qui orat pro martyre he doth iniurie to a martyr, that prayeth for a martyr.
But wherefore (saith he) made they this prayer for the sainctes already in heauen? for soothe to separate Christ from the order of men, by the honor they gaue him, that he excelled all creatures, were they neuer so holy.
Which though it be most true, and withall confuteth your adoration of Saincts departed, yet their reason héerein was very fonde, that therefore they should pray for them that were already in perfect blisse and glory.
And as fond was it to pray for those that died in their sinnes, agaynst whom the scripture is playne and plat: and hereto accordeth the best of the learned fathers, as haue declared before of S. Aug. who~ ye quote with Epiphanius.
If therfore Epiphanius ment more than thankes giuing to God, for his mercies to the saincts, in sauing them, praysing God for his iustice to the wicked in condemning them, and withall to confirme in the liuing the hope of the resurrection of the dead: then is Epiphanius not onely contrary to the Scripture, and S. Aug. but also to him selfe, and to the best of all the fathers besides, whose traditions is the onely argument that Epiphanius pretendeth.
Ciprian (who also admitteth the memorials oblations of thanks giuing for the faythfull martyrs departed) yet in this poynt of doctrine to pray for any departed, as to helpe them by their prayers, or that they be in case to néede find suche helpe, he vtterly denieth.
Quando istin excessum fuerit, &c. when we are departed out of this life, there is now no place for repentaunce, no desire of satisfaction, lyfe is either loste heere, or gotten heere by the vvorship of God, and the fruite of fayth, eternall saluation is prouided for: neither is any body hindred, either by his sinnes or his yeres, that therby he might the lesse come to the obteyning of saluation.
To him that is abiding in this worlde repentance is neuer to late.
&c. Athanasius likewise, Animae nobis profectae vbi quomodo sint. &c. VVhere the soules departed from vs, are, and how they be, is a straunge and horrible question, and hid fro~ men: for God hath not suffred any to returne from thence, which should declare it.
Notwithstanding out of the scripture we learne, that the soules of sinners be in hell, and the soules of the iust be in Paradise.
The iudgement of S. Hierome is very playne, and inserted among your Popishe decrées; In praesenti siculo. &c. VVhyle we are in this present worlde, either by prayers or by counsels, vve may one be helped of another: but when we shall come before the iudgement seate of Christ, neither Iob, nor Daniell, nor Noe can doe ought for any body, but euery one shall beare his owne burden.
And agayne, he that while he liueth in this body, shall not haue obtayned the forgiuenesse of sinnes, and so shal depart out of hys life, perisheth vnto God, and endeth his beeing, although to him selfe he be in paynes.
He that hathe nt washed away his sinnes (sayth Chrisostome) in this present lyfe, shall not afterwarde finde any consolation.
For in hell, saythe he, who shall prayse thee? and vvorthily sayde, for this is the time of cares and conflictes, and wrastlinges, as for that is the tyme of crowninges, of retributions, and rewardinges.
And agayne, If thou arte made any mans enimie, bee reconciled before thou come to iudgement.
Dispatche all thinges heere, that without griefe thou mayest beholde the iudgement seate.
VVhyle we are heere, we haue notable hopes, but so sone as euer we shall be departed from hence, it lyeth not in vs afterwarde to repente, nor to washe away the faultes vve haue committed.
After the ende of this life, there are no occasions of good workes, as wrastlers haue then no occasion of getting the garlande when the wrestlings are finished.
And as Theophilacte saythe: after thys lye there is no tyme, eyther of repenting, or of vvishing.
All which sayings, if they be true, it followeth there is no place of purging and helping them, that are already dead in their sinnes: since the sules so departed can not repent, but there is no forgiuenesse without repentance: since at occasions of their deliuery are past, yea, they be past wishing any goodnesse to them selues, that is to say, they vtterly dispayre of al mercy, knowing, that wishing booteth not, muche lesse the wishing of others for them: as Theophilact a little before sayde of the foolishe Uirgins: The vertues of my neighboure will hardly suffice for his owne defence, so farre off is it from helping me.
Thus are all these Doctors contrarie to Epiphanius héerein, if Epiphanius were to be expeunded as you woulde haue him.
And will ye make all these Aerians too? But to all these your vsage is, to clap downe as many or more Doctors of the contrary opinion, yea to bring euen these that haue rcited, to witnesse the quite contrary.
In which doing, thinking to discredite vs, ye not onely lese credit your selfe, by wresting them, but also ye diminishe their credite (haue they any with you) that make them speake contrary to them selues.
True it is, that euery one of these fathers, as they had theyr faultes and errours, so they bare muche also, in these matters of dead men, with the common sway, althoughe S. Augustine and Chrisostome, more than the rest, do often times chide the people, for vsing about the dead, suche fonde abuses, as at that tyme they did.
Chrisostome telleth howe they woulde strippe their armes, make them bloudie, teare their heare, scratche their faces, and weare blacke apparell, and hire mourners.
All whiche he greatly blameth: and althoughe they pretended custome for them, saying: Consuetudinem quero, &c. consuetudinem requiro, &c.
Yet doth not Chrisostome allow their sayings, but calleth it, pessimam consuetudinem, a most wicked custome, ineptias, toyes, suche as he was ashamed of, hypocrisie and such as long ago ought to haue bene driuen cleane away.
Thus earnestly writeth Chrisostome against the abuses about the dead.
And also for that opinion, that euen then in his dayes was a common and constant opinion among the people, euen as it is yet among al papists, that the soules of diuers do walke after their death, and mone them selues to vs aliue, to be holpen by our prayers.
Which, how false an opinion it is, appeareth by Chrisostome.
Shall be persuaded (sayth he) bicause thou hast heard the diuels often times crie, am the soule of suche an one? but this saying comes also of the diuels fraude and disceite, for it is not the soule of the departed, which sayth these things, but the diuell that feygneth these things to deceiue the hearers. &c.
These things are to be counted but olde wiues, or rather dotardes tales, and toyes for children: for the soule beeing separate from the body, can not wander in these regions.
As for the soules of the iuste, they are in the handes of God.
The soules likewise of the Infantes, for they haue not sinned.
But the soules of sinners are caried away euen staight after their departure, the which is made playne by Lazarus and Diues. &c.
And by many places of the scripture it may be proued, that the soules of iust men after their death, do not wander heere For bothe Steuen sayde, Receiue my spirite, and Paule desired to be loosed and to be with Christe.
And also in another place the Lorde sayth, this day shal they take thysoule from thee.
The soule therfore when it is once gone from the body, can not wander heere amongest vs.
And the Scripture saith also of the Pattiarche, he was put to his father and died in a good age.
But that also neither the soules of the sinners can abide here, thou maist harken what the riche man saith, and marke what he craueth and can not get it, if the soules of men might be co~uersant here, he would haue come him selfe as he desired, and haue warned his kinsmen of Hell torments.
Out of which place it appeareth also plainly, that the soules after their departure from the bodie, are carried away to a certaine place, from whence at their will they can not get, but do there abide, expecting that terrible day of iudgement.
These wordes of Chrysostome well weighed, inferre fower things: First, that there be no moe estates of the dead than twoo, the iust and the wicked, and so there are none to be purged
Secondly, that there be be but two places also, Heauen and Hell, so the purging place called purgatory is excluded.
Thirdly, that the soules once departed from their bodies, come forthwith to one of these two places, and there tary continually till the day of dome, without wandring here on the earth: and so purgatorie is againe excluded.
Fourthly, that all appearings of any, that say they are the sules of such and such, &c. are the Diuels fraudes, old wines fables, fooles tales, childrens toyes, and so againe, not onely the opinion of purgatorie is improued, but also al the Popish reuelatio~s thereof, proued to haue bene the Diuels illusio~s.
note it now only to shew, that this errour (though nothing like to that it hath since) was so crope~ into the Church then, that Chrysostome was faine thus sharply to co~fute it.
S. Augustine also rebuketh other errours cropen in by custome about the dead.
know (saith he) that there are many worshippers of sepulchers, and of pictures.
know there are many which most riottously drinke ouer the dead, and making banquets to the corses, burie them selues vppon the buried, and these their gluttonnies and dronkennesse, they accoumpt for Religion.
These and such like wicked customes and errours about the dead, gréeued S. Augustine, wherefore he deuised with the godly Bishop.
Though therefore Epiphanius allowed the praying for the dead and other ceremonies there aboutes, that euen the popish Church doth not vse, and pretende custome for him neuer so muche: yet none of these fathers are of his iudgement herein.
Nor his argument, from custome beyond the worde of God, bindeth vs: but that rather we may follow S. Augustins rule, Magis veritatem quàm consuetudinem sequi debemus.
VVe ought rather to follow the truth than the custome.
Yea, although al these Doctours had bene contrarie hereto, the Scripture being so plaine therein.
Epiphanius argument therefore, is very meane to force any Heresie of denying this erroneouse custome.
And yet is not Aerius excused, bicause he withall couertly (as appeareth by Epiphanius proues) denied the Resurrection, els, had their bene no furder meaning in those wordes, than that Prayer or Sacrifice was fruitlesse for the dead, it had bene so litle any Heresie, that Epiphanius was rather in an errour thereof, by yelding to corrupted custome, as haue proued by the Fathers to whose tradition he appealeth: and by S. Augustine, that also noteth this thing in Aerius.
Howbeit speake it not, to deface the worthie commendation of Epiphanius, but do as you do, when ye talke with him for Images.
Although might note in him furder, not only his too bitter co~tention with Chrysostome, but also that he is not all sounde for doctrine, no not in euery point of the Trinitie: not that lay it to him as any Heresie, but as an errour: no marueyle then though he were deceyued herein, and you also M. Stapleton that ground on him, to slaunder vs with Aerius heresie, which was against the resurrection, and that the dead Sunt nulli, are none, and are resolued to nothing.
haue bene the longer in answering you to Aerius, bicause ye vrge it so much, and triumphe in so vaine and false a matter.
How say you to louinian that denied virginitie to haue any excellencie aboue Matrimonie or any speciall rewarde at Gods handes? Or euer say any thing to Iouinian, answere to you M. Stapleton.
If you should receyue such rewarde at Gods handes, as your slaunderouse and lying toung deserueth, thinke your virginitie (presupposing that ye were so good a virgin Priest as ye pretende, although will not sweare for you) would at that great daie of rewarde stande ye in litle stéede.
Your selfe know well inough, that although we attribute to the honorable state of Mariage, that reuerence and libertie among all men, that Christ and his Apostle S. Paule biddeth: yet, do we not deface or dispise, but esteeme honorable also, the excellent gift of continencie.
Yea confesse with the Apostle that in him that hath the gift thereof, it is, in those respects that the Apostle mentioneth, more excellent than Matrimonie.
Bicause such are more frée to tranaile, in the preaching and ministerie of Gods worde, with lesse trouble, care and charge, chiefly in time of persecution.
But not for any excellencie of virginitie it selfe, as an holier vertue, deseruing heauen, which you call a speciall reward at Gods hands, meaning thereby a merite or deserte of a greater glory in heauen than Matrimonie.
This fonde presumption of merites we disalowe, and would haue ye say with Gregorie your Pope: Let them know that virginitie so excelleth mariage, that the vnmaried extoll not the~selues aboue those that be maried.
You your popish Priests do not thus, but in that ye be vnmaried ye preferre your selues aboue the maried, craking of excelle~ce and special reward aboue others, as did ye boasting Pharisée.
And God wote are so far fro~ that virginitie which ye crake of, that not onely ye burne within with most filthie lustes of your pampred bodies and vnmortified fleshe, and so by reason of the scruple of your vowe, haue your consciences marked with an whote Iron, and yet virginitie, as your selues (to your owne greater condemnation without your greater repentance) testifie, is quite loste, being polluted in the assent of the minde.
But what speake of the minde? which would commit to God, to iudge vppon, sauing that all the world crieth out of your fornications, adulteries, incestes, sodomitrie, the crie whereof is ascended vnto heauen.
Your owne bookes swarme in exclaiming it, and almost euery Cronicler noteth it.
But what néede notes of Chronicles, when your licences and dispensations for your Priestes concubines, your open mainteyning of courtezanes, stewes and harlotrie, are so appara~t, that ye can not denie it? Would God yet ye could blushe, and be at the least ashamed of it.
But why wishe shame, in so shamelesse maiden Priestes, if ye can be maydens, that neither haue maidenhed nor shamefastnesse in you? are ye not those Locustes that S. Iohn saith, should come out of the bottomlesse pitte, hauing on their heads as it were crownes like vnto golde, and their faces were as it had bene the faces of men, and they had heare as the heares of women, that is to say, a shew and countenance of maydenly virginitie, hauing notwithstanding tayles like Scorpions.
did not for nought so commonly vse this sentence: that where the Fathers, not without great consideration at the first, forbad Priests to marry, and to keepe them selues single: they should now not without a greater cause, suffer them to marrie.
In the which wordes, he not onely noteth the popish Priestes abominations, but also that this forbidding of marriage is not of any commaundement of Christ, but merely of mens prohibition: but such prohibition, as were much better reuoked, euen by the best learned Popes opinion (as the writers of his life do note) that euer satte in that sate.
Of the same iudgement was Erasmus, who seing the abhominable life of the popish Priests, abosing the simple vnder the ne of virginitie· Mu &c. Many causes (faith he) persuade a change of the lawe of single life in ecclesiasticall persons.
And when your Sorbonistes of Paris stamped hereat and wrote against him, boasting as you de of the excellencie of virginitie shining in holines: Erasmus answered them: Qui tractnt, &c.
They that lay those that medle with the diuine mysteries and the administration of the heauenly worde, chastitie doth most become them, they say true and godly, and allow their iudgement very well: but they do consider, what the thing it selfe requireth: consider· what the imbeilitie of men requireth.
Many discommodities (I graunt) might follow, if wiues were permitted vnto Priestes, but such discommodities as either the Church, or the carefulnesse of Princes, might easilie with certaine constitutions remedie.
But now in so corrupt manners of men, their most silthie single life hath farre more greuous discommodities.
Would to God so many as are priests would turne their minde to cleannesse.
Thus saide Erasmus of your birginly Priesthood not onely with wh, but euen with S. Paule, we say: it is better marry than to lie in such wicked burnings and viciouse liuing.
Yea although the partie had neuer so much vowed virginitie before, yet if he could not keepe his vowe but burne in lust, it were farre better for him to marry, and his mariage (as S. Angustine saith) is perfect matrimonie.
And not whoredome as you your Papistes slaunderously do terine it· But no meruaile if ye slau~der our Matrimonie, that not onely liue your selues in such wicked demeanour, he such stalions as the Prophete cried out of, that neighed after their neighbours wines, rather than with the honest care of Matrimonie, ye would haue any of your own: since, as ye defiled others eddes, so ye accoumpt and write of all matrimonie as a polluted state.
For so saith Durandus, and so ye say all: Matrimonium tollis puritatem, maculat corpus, Matrimony taketh away cleannesse, and deileth the bodie.
Whereas the Scripture calleth it, Cubile impollutum, An vndefiled bedde, and an honorable estate.
And yet for simple fornication it is a common question moued among you, whether it be a mortall sinne or no.
So fauourable ye are to wickednesse, and so harde to Matrimonie.
To liue in Matrimonie, is with Papistes to liue after the eash.
Which what is it els with S. Paule but to liue in sinne, to offende God, to deserue death? secundam carnem vixerit moriemini, If ye liue after the flesh ye shall die.
They that are in the flesh can not please God.
And therefore they reason that Priests may not liue in Matrimonie.
But to sorsweare Matrimonie, to liue a single life, how soeuer he liue it, Si non caste caue, If not chastely yet closely.
This with Papistes is virginitie, this is an excellent life, this at Gods handes deserues a speciall rewarde.
This hypocrisie, of fained virginitie, this defacing and destling of honorable matrimonie, bicause we crie out vpon, we are
Bicause we reprehends your forced single life, that compelleth Priestes not to marrie, whether they will or no, whether they haue or no, the gifte of virginitie, which is not of them selues, but a gift, and that of God, and that a rare gifte, as Christ saith, and as experience hath proued, a most rare gifte among your votaries: we are therefore Iouinians.
Bicause we preferre marriage before such vncleane virginitie, as the honorable, necessarie and vndefiled meanes to auoide fornication: Bicause we say virginitie (I meane not Popish virginitie, but true virginitie) is in it selfe no such vertue, as you make it, of especiall rewarde, but in respect of auoiding some hinderances: as also Matrimonie, in respects of auoyding greater cuils, therefore we are Iouinians, and make them both alike.
But what say we herein, that euen your Schoolemen say not· Durandus aforesatde, vppon this selfe same question whether virginitie be to be preferred before matrimonie.
Aliquod est &c. Something is good in it selfe, something accidentally or inrespect of another thing, that is, bicause it remoueth an euill or inconuenient thing.
After the firste sorte, meate is good to the bodie.
VVee must say therefore that virginitie is not good after the first sorte, but after the seconde: which appeareth three wayes.
First, thus: to abstaine from that that is conuenient in it selfe and good, can not of it selfe be good.
But by virginitie we abstaine from Matrimonie, which of it selfe is good: therefore virginitie of it selfe is not good.
which woordes (omitting his contradiction to his owne tale) he maketh in it selfe Matrimonie to be better than Uirginitie.
But what stande on Durandus, when all your Priestes (incurring therein worse contradiction) make Matrimonie a Sacrament, but Uirginitie they make none? If therefore we be louinians, be not you louinians to? rather, per syncopen, be ye not louinians as good virgin maydens as euer Iupiter was? But to supplie that wantes in you, ye presse vs with S. Hieroms authoritie.
To whome though might fully answere ye, with the learned censure of Eramus on that S. Hieromes against yet for your furder satisfiyng your de will referre ye to excellent learned father, and euen fellow student with S. Hierome, one also that had written against
Whereby ye may sée how farre S. Hierome ouershotte him selfe &.
(saith Ruffinus to Hisrom speaking of Iouinian) did first set vpo~ this worke, and peraduenture being compelled.
And no meruaile if he wauered at the first yet should not occasion there at be snatched, of derogating from the Christians, but rather the profite of amendement be sought for.
If you had writen those things vnto him, should ye not haue giuen both greater grace and edifiyng, either vnto him· hauing his beginnings in the feare of God, or els vnto others being readers thereof: than now the same your inuectiues do giue more griefe and confusion to all that feare? which both in you do shew a most foule lust of back byting and in me a of answering.
For, as haue said, in your bookes wrttten against you be founde now to affirme the selfe ame things, with which ye reproued him· Howbeit now ye are fallen so farre, that ye affirme, the filthes of mariage ca not be washed away, no not with the blond of martyrdome. &c.
And after this againe saith Ruffinus on S. Hierome, besides this we haue shewed; that it is this mans fashion to derogate all good men and this point he taketh to be somwhat, if he may repreende a wie men and those that haue any name in earning· haue shewed also how vnworthly he hath rayled on the Ministers and Priestes of Christ.
No he hath not spared the Mokes, no nor the virgins whom he hath praised, nor the continent· yea infamed with his foue ibels the estate and degree of &c.
And so Russinus telleth, how vnworthily he defaced S. Ambrose whome before he placed among the Prophets postles, and afterward placeth them among those that teach strage things, neither did nor new writers, Martyr nor other.
All this M. St. ou of not to detect the Fathers but only to shew how weake your argument is, in vs, and that with for this article of ourman (for, his other matters sette S. Hierome calleth him vp therefore, declaring rather his owne impotencie (though otherwise; being a very godly Saim, and a notable learned Father) than herein confuteth his aduersarie.
Your thirde demaund, is to what we say to the rians, that denied the miracles done at the saincts tombes to be true miracles, and that the cannot cast out the diuils, and relieue them that be possessed.
And to the Bogomiles, that saide the diuels sate at the saincts tombe, and dyd wonders there, to illude and the people, to cause the people to worship them.
We denie not, M. Sta. with the Arians or the power of Christ his wondrous workes, at the of the the: bicause we denie the feigned of your and images now, Betwéene which their then, was as much difference it betweene miracles and false illusions, betweene the sincere worship of God, open Idolatrie.
So that this, as the other, is your false slaunder also.
And if ye make al and who, though they did at that time wrought his to confirme the fayth among the yet would they not make any ordinary prescript of miracles, nor by miracles measure true or false doctrine, nor asscribe any holinesse to the or places, nor such miracles to be of the martyrs doings, nor to be done for their deseuings, nor the or the martyres them selues, to honored with spirituall worship: Then will make S. Cyril, and other godly fathers to be Arians and also. (sayth S. Aug.)
Let not the worship of dead men, be religion to vs.
For if they haue liued well· they are not so to be accompted, they would seeke such but they woulde haue to be of who vs· they reioyce that we are made) of
They are therfore to be honored for imitation, they are not to be worshipped for religion.
you worship them for religion, dedicate temple to them, offer knéele, pray vnto them, and make these great poyntes of religion.
The angell of God in no case woulde suffer any suche kinde of worship to be done vnto him, but forad S. Iohn to do it.
Peter would not suffer Cornelius, nor Paule and Barnaas the Lyaconis this to worship the~.
Which if they refused beeing alme, thinke ye they desire you to worship them béeing dead? in deede so do your popish saincts.
Francis the author of the begging Friers, as your legend telleth, releysed on a and lauged greatly, and beeing demaunded the cause of his laugher, he answered, it was, bicause should after his death be worshipped for a sainct.
And in many your other saincts, ye tel s, how they appeared to suche or suche a Priest, Fier, Monke, or commaunding this or that ceremonie, church, prayer, feast, or holyday, to be made in their honor.
This did not the true saincts and good angels of God require, nor the Churche of God yéelde vnto them: as sayth S. do we builde Churches to them, for they would not so be honored of vs.
VVe neither call the holy martyrs, Gods, no yet vse we to worship them.
rather we prayse them with high honours, that they haue stoutly foughte and the sinceritie of the aythe, in so muched at they their owne life, and the of death they preuayled in great daungers, and were of suche strengthe, that they woulde rayse vp, as it were, of their life.
And therefore it is not vnworthy, yea rather it is also necssarie, to honour them with perpetual prayses, which are glorious by so noble deees.
As for other kinde than this, of praysng them for their vertues, Cyril none to the Christians, sayth· To worshippe dead otherwise· is the propertie of heathen
Nowe where ye measure and saincts by miracles, S. sayth, fieri Christianum, non sanctum. &c.
It is possible that a Christian by signes and vvonders may be made famous, but he can not be made a Saincte by them, if he vse intemperat and rough (Such an one as your Chronicles write that Augustine the Italian was, which came hither from nothing like this S. Augustine of Affrike: suche an other proude and sharpe sainct, as was you S. Thomas of whse shrine and miracles your legendes babble muche.)
Temperatis &c. say the S. Augustine, but by temperate and softe demeanour· we beleeue that a man may well be made bothe a saincte, and perfecte, and a man of God, yea without the efficacie of miracles.
And so sayth Cyrill on S. Iohn the Baptist, in that he wrought no myracles: in aliquo derogat sanctitate &c. Neither doth this in any pointe derogate from his holynesse· than there not a greater, as our Sauiour dothe
For to myracles addeth no holynesse or to a man, sihe it serueth aswell for the ill and reprobate, as the Lorde wit nesseth: haue not we (sayd the Hypocrites) Lorde, caste out diuels in thy name? And therefore sayth Chrisostome to suche as in his required myracles, and asked why they had not myracles, so well the olde time, Si fidelis e.
If arte faythfull, as thou oughtest to be, if thou louest Chryst· as he oughte to be loued, thou needest no myracles, for myracles are giuen to those that are vnbeleeuers.
M. Stap. that your Churche is an vnbeléeing Churche, since it so vaunteth of myracles, and that of such myracles, as either are plaine illusions of wicked spirits, working, strongly in the children of vnbeleee, to deayne them still in errour: or else are nothing but mayfest forgeies, and iugglings, suche in very déede as the and the christians then withall.
But that your are not saundered there with now, report me to those your Images that could sweate, roll their eyes· moue their handes, turne rounde aboute, sense the Church, walke vp and downe the aultare, speake, wéepe, laugh, frowne, and do) many other pretie miraculous knackes.
Of which all the worlde now seeth the marueytous legerdemaine, the best of your srt, are either forced with shame, to confesse the abuses, or else to est out the matter with scoffes, as sir Thomas Mooin in his booke of pilgrimages and myracles doth.
But none durst crake of them so impudently as doe you, comparing your false myracles, to the auncient true miracles, calling vs Arians and a though we denyed those, when we onely denie yours, at the which if not the Deuill himselfe, yet his ministers sate, if not at saintestombes, yet at your Zoolatrous shrines, to illude, yea to robbe and spoyle the simple people, to derke your gorgious shrines and Images, but chiefly to enriche your es.
The Martyres reioyce not when they are honoured with that money· for which the poore doe weepe.
VVhat vertue of iustice is that to rewarde the deade and spoyle the liuing? &c. what maner of men then be they, that spoyle men, and make buyldings of What woulde Chrysostome haue sayde, had he séene with what rapine your Popishe shrines were decked nothing like the reuere~t tombes of those holy Martyrs, which yet they worshipped not, nor the Martyrs in the~, what true myracles were wrought at them· nd therefore Chrysostome wath, Ne aendas cinres of the es bodies, nor the imbe of the fl reliques, and all their bones, which in time co~sumed, but open the eyes of thy sayth, and see the with power.
And in such sort sayth saint Augustine· Honoramus sanè memorias martyrum tan{que} sanctorum ho Des.
VVe honour in dede the memorie of the martyrs· as the holy men of God: Not (as he sayth afterwarde) as the heathen doe, that to their Gods buyde Churches, and erect aultars, ordeyne Priestes, and make sacrifices.
But wee (sayth he) doe not buyde Churches to our Martyrs, as though they were Gods, but make memories of them, as deade men whose soules do liue with God, neyther doe we erect altars there, whereon we might sacrifice to Martyrs, but we offer Sacrifice to the one God, both of the Martyrs, and of vs.
At the which Sacrifice the men of god which in the acknowledging of him, haue ouercome the worlde, are in their place and order named, but not of the Priest that sacrificeth, although he sacrifice in the memorie of them, bicause he is Gods Priest, not theirs.
But the sacrifice is the bodie of Christ, which is not offered to them, bicause they are this same bodie.
Which saying of Saint Augustine, as it confoundeth your grosse opinion of this spirituall sacrifice that next ye lay to our charge: (for he sayth the sacrifice is that bodie of Christ, the which they them selues be also, that is, the mysticall bodie, and not his naturall bodie) so it sheweth what a difference betweene those olde tombes of true Martyrs, and your Saints shrines there is.
You builded and dedicated Churches to them, so did not they.
Your schooemen say they haue numina, and therefore ought to be worshipped, so did not they.
You ordeyned Priestes vnto them, and besides Priestes, you instituted Monkes, Nunnes, Friers and Chanons to them, so did not they.
You worshipped them with diuine honour, so did not they: and yet ye call vs by the name of those Heretikes, that reiected theyr Martyrs miracles and memories, bicause we reiect your illusions and Idolatries.
Now as you thus meruelously slaunder vs, so are yée eyther deceyued your selfe, or would deceyue others vnder Saint Ambrose name, where as the booke ye cite (whiche also Alfonsus standeth much vpon) is none of Ambrose his workes, but some fayned forgers in his name, as Erasmus very well doth proue.
If ye will know the very minde of S. Amb. turne to his commentarie on the first to the Rom. where he saith: quanta agritudo, &c. VVhat a great griefe, what a great folly is it, for those to call themselues wise men, to their owne damnation, among whom the deade can do more than the liuing, and the deade are of better power than those that are aliue, These are Ambrose his owne wordes making flatly agaynst you.
But whosoeuer those Sermons be that ye quote, they touch not vs, as is declared.
We yelde to the olde Martyrs, so much as these fathers require.
We only denie to yours, that you require, and woulde extort, to enriche your selues, and delude the people, neyther sparing to belie vs, nor the fathers, and face vs out with false cardes in their names.
But letting go your forgeries of the fathers, what say ye once againe to Frier Ferus herein? Uulgus hominum. &c.
The common people (sayth hée) esteemeth Saintes by myracles and counteth him the greater, that hath done more myracles, but they erre manifestly that so iudge: myracles are in deede (to vse Saint Paules wordes) the operation of great workes, the gift of the holy ghost.
But hereon they are not onely esteemed Saints, else the blessed virgin Iohn Baptist were of all saints the least, that are read to haue wrought no myracle.
Moreouer, oftentimes myracles are giuen to the euill, for many shall say in that day, Lorde, Lorde, haue wee not cast out Deuilles in thy name, and shall say to them, haue not knowne you, &c.
And thus will Christe say of your myracles, master Stapleton, and therefore let him be a Bogomile with you also.
Concerning Berengarius, bicause your slaunder both of him and vs, in the controuersie of the sacrament, is confuted by the learned trauayles of those, that fully haue answered all your cauillations therin: wil now passe it ouer, as vn worthie further answere.
Only bid you looke to it your selues, that charge him with heresie: least yt renfation that your Pope co~pelled him to make, sauer not (as euen your glosse theron doth warne) of a greater heresie than you lay to him.
Where ye aske vs what we say to the Paulicians, that sayde, these wordes of Christe, Take eae this is my body, are not to be vnderstanded of his bodie, or the bread wine vsed at the celebration of our Lords maundie, but of the holy scriptures, which the Priest should take at Christes handes, and deliuer and distribute to the people.
answere, let the truth of this obiection to vs, be a measure, on Gods name, to all the rest: and as men finde you true or false herein, so estéeme you in the other.
For my part, scarce can tell what wordes should vse vnto you, vnlesse ye will giue me leaue to vse your owne, that except ye had a face harder than any horne, M. St. yea harder than any yron staple, except the deuill at your backe prompted lyes vnto you (for these be your owne termes) you woulde neuer for very shame charge vs herewith.
Your selfe knowe (saue that ye are hyred as Balaam was, to speake cursed slaunders contrary to your conscience) that we hold no such opinion: but affirme euen the at contrary.
That those words of Christ, take eate this is my bodie, are to be vnderstanded both of his bodie, and of the bread and wine also.
Both which you say the Paulicians denie, and we confesse and beleue both.
Only, the question on the former part betwene you and vs, is of the maner of the bodies presence, which we with ye fathers, say is sacramitall spiritual: you say, with ye Capernaits, is natural carnal.
As for ye other part, of the bread wine, you come a great deale nearer the Paulicians than we.
The Paulicians (say you) did say, these wordes of Christ, take, eat, this is my body, are not to be vndersta~ded of bread wine, And you say also these words are not to be vnderstanded of bread and wine, for there is no bread wine there to vnderstand the~ vpo~.
But we say ye contrary to you both, they are vnderstanded both of bread and wine.
And so Christ plainly speaketh, calling further the wine, (to be vnderstoode the better, contrary to you and the Paulicians) the fruite of the Grape, and the bread which we breake, sayth Saint Paule, not the fleshe which we do asticare, as you say, champe and chawe it, gnashing the bones, and the bloud running about the teeth, as ye caused Berengarius to confesse.
This is a grosser Heresie than that of the Paulicians, and yet are you nearer the Paulicians to than we.
But what should make you obiect this heresie to vs? there is no cause, that can see, except ye enuie at this, that at the ministration of the Sacrament, the holy scriptures are read, that the people may vnderstande the true institution of it, and celebrate the Lordes death till he come.
And that in your sacrament of the altar (as ye call it) there is no holye scriptures read, that the people may vnderstande, but onely the wordes are mumbled vp to your selues, that the people neither heare nor know them.
And if you say yet, be ye not like the Paulicians herein: it may well be, for ye be rather like Magicians, murmuring vp a charme, than like Paulicians, or any bodie else know.
Where next ye demaunde what we say to Claudius and Vigilantius, that denyed the inuocation of Saints, the blessed Reliques, and the vse of lightes, and other ceremonies in the Church.
First, to Claudius aunswere, that can say no more than Alphonsus doth.
For he reckoneth vp one Claudius, and nameth another Iuo Carnotensis, cited out of Thomas Walden, which Iuo he confesseth he had not séene.
You father it on an other called Ionas, whome also confesse, haue not séene, nor am greatly curious to searche him out.
For, if he denied those thinges, or any of them, no otherwise than we do, it will be hard for you to proue him therefore an Heretike.
As for Uigilantius opinions on these things, are manifest in Saint Hieroms inuectiues, and conteyne no Heresie that can perceyue.
He misliked greatly and spoke against diuerse abuses, betweene whom and saint Hierome thereaboutes, fell out foule language.
But letting him chide with his aduersarie, let vs go to the matter.
The scripture acknowledgeth no kind of inuocation but only of God: Laudabilem inuocabo dominum. &c.
will make (sayth Dauid) inuocation on the Lorde that is to be prayed, and shall be safe from mine enimies, In tribulatione mea inucabo dominum, ad deum meum claabo. &c.
In my trouble will make inuocation vpon the Lord, and will crie vnto my God.
Inuocabit is me iuetis, saith god, Call vpon me and ye shall liue, The Lorde is riche to all that call vpon him, sayth S. Paule.
VVho so euer calleth on the name of the Lord shall be saued.
Thus sayth the scripture all ouer, for the inuocation of God.
As for any other inuocation, the Scripture admitteth none, no not of the holy Patriarkes.
For thou art our father (sayth the Prophete Esay) as for Abraham knewe not vs, and Israell is ignorant of vs, thou God art our father and redeemer.
No doubt Abraham was, and is a good a Saint, and much better, than many in your Popes Calender (of whome some are doubted to be Deuil in hell, that are inuocated for Saints in heauen) yea Abraham is called Pater omnium crdentium, The father of all the faythfull, and yet in this poynt of inuocation, Abraham is no father at all, Tu deus pater noster, onely God is our father, Abraham is not inuocated, yea, he is by name excepted, and that as ignorant of vs· If Abraham then the father of the Saints, haue no priuelege, yea léese his priuelege of fatherhoode in this behalfe of inuocation: what shall we thinke of all the children of Abraham, the Saints of God that haue succéeded him, that they are to be inuocated? or not rather conclude thereon, if inuocation be not to be made to Abraham, then inuocation is to be made to no Saint, but all and onely vnto God.
And the reason is this: God is a iealous God of his glorie, and will not communicate any part thereof with any other.
But the greatest glory that we can giue to God, is in our trouble to inuocate him.
Call vpon me in the day of trouble, and wil heare thee, and thou shalt glorifie me, sayth God.
The schoolemen confesse that inuocation est virtus latriae, is the vertue of diuine honour.
Inuocation is therefore to bée made to none but God.
And if you knew or weighed M. St. howe great a thing Inuocation were, ye woulde neuer for feare of God, or shame of your selfe, ascribe it to anye creature.
nuocas deum (sayth S. Aug.) quando in te vocas deum.
Hoc est enim inuocare, illum in vocare, quodam modo eum in domum cordis tui inuitare.
Thou inuocatest god, or callest vpon God, when thou callest God vpon thee, for this it is to inuocate, to call him into thee, as it were to inuite him into the house of thy heart: but none ought to dwell in our hearts besides God, none can search the heart reynes but only god, our hearts ought to be onely Gods seat, for we are the temple of none but of God: inuocation therfore (being the sacrifice of the heart, Sacrificium deo spiritus tribulatus cor contritum. &c.
troubled spirit is a sacrifice to God, neither will he dispise a bruised heart) ought to be ascribed to none but to god, yt saith, Praebe fili cor tuu~ mihi, my son yeld me thy heart.
Moreouer as Chrisostome sayth, cum oramus deo colloquimur, VVhen we pray, we speake to God.
And so S. Aug. Oratio tua locutio est ad du~, Thy prayer is a speaking with God.
VVhen we pray, we our selues do speake with god.
Cum deo loquitur, &c. Prayer speaketh to God, talketh with the iudge. &c.
To conclude, al the doctors, yea the schoolemen the~selues, praier to be directed only to god. oratio (saith Hugo) est piae me~tis humilis ad deu~ conuersio, fide. spe, charitate subnixa.
Praier is the conuersion of a godly humble mind to god, grounded on faith, hope and charitie.
And in the name of the~ all, Summa Angelica sayth, accipitur proprie oratio. &c. Praier taken properly is the ascending of our minde to god. &c. and so taken, it is diuersly defined.
Vt patet per Ho. in summa ti. de poenis. lo. An. in cle. vnica de rel· ve. san. VVhervpon after Aug. in lib. de verbis domini: Praier is a certaine petition: And in an other place, prayer is a godly affection of the mind directed to god. &c.
prayer is the mounting vp of the mind to god. &c.
Or according to Raymunde, Praier is an heaping vp of words, tending to God, to obteyne somwhat. &c. By all which sayings, appeareth the definition of praier, that except it be made to God, it is no true praier.
Ergo, inuocation must be made to God, which except it be, it is no true praier.
Inuocatio~ therfore vnto saints, angels, or any creature besides God, is neither true nor godly.
To the confirmation whereof, Christ teaching his disciples to pray directeth them onely to God, saying.
Our father which art in heauen. &c. which prayer ought to be the greu~d and paterne of all prayer, to pray to him whome we may call our father whiche art in heauen, whiche terme is competent to none but God.
The aungels call themselues our fellowe seruants, not our father.
The Saintes may be called our brethren, not our father.
The blessed Uirgin, our sister, not our father, Yea though ye should call hir our mother (wherin ye should derogate from the Church of Christ) or our Ladie (as without any warrant of y^ scripture ye do salute hir, and with diuerse other names inuocate hir) yet syth by no meanes ye can call hir our father, you ought not therefore to inuocate or pray vnto hir, or to any angell, saint or creature, but only pray to god, that only is our heauenly father.
Saint Augustine and all the doctor agrée, that the fountaine of inuocation is faith, according to the scripture, Quomodo inuocabun in quem non crediderunt? Howe can they make inuocation to any vpon whom they haue not beleued? By which rule, if ye admitte inuocation to saints, we must then beleue on saints: but we must beleue on none but god, we must thereore inuocate none but God.
Neyther here can ye slippe the coller with your stely distinction, of calling for helpe, and calling for intercession, alleaging that ye pray to Saints, as but to intercessors, mediators, or spokesmen for you, saying only to them, pro nobis, pray for vs, inercede pro nobu, go betweene vs and God: But to God ye say, Miserere nostrs, a nobis, protege nos, liber a nos. Haue mercie vpon vs, giue vnto vs, helpe vs, defende vs, deliuer vs, &c: For howsoeuer ye make your praiers, ye graunt ye inuocate, which by the nature of prayer, by the forme prescribed of Christ, by the beliefe to be affied on him to whome soeuer ye pray, sheweth still your prayers to be Idolatrous.
In deede this shift is a stale shift, but as S. Ambrose calleth it, it is a wretched shift.
They are woont (sayth he) to vse a wretched excuse: saying, that euen as we come to a King by his noble men, so through righteous men we may haue accesse to God.
Go to, is there any so madde, and so forgetfull of his health, that he will ascribe the honour of the King vnto the noble man? when if any man shall bee founde to haue so much as medled herein, they haue worthily bene condemned for traytours.
And yet these men thinke not them guiltie, which giue to a creature the honour of Gods name, and forsaking the Lorde, worship their fellowe seruants: as though the matter were the more, bicause they serued God.
For we come to the king through his tribunes and noble men, for this cause, euen bicause the King is a man, and he knoweth not to whom he ought to commit the rule of the common weale.
But to come vnto God, from whome nothing is hid, (for he knoweth the merites of all men) we haue no neede to fee any intreater to speake for vs, but wee haue neede of a deuout minde.
For wheresoeuer any such intreater shall haue spoken for vs, God will giue no aunswere at all.
What can be playner spoken than this master Stapleton, against the inuocation of Saintes, admitting them no further, than euen as intercessours? Wherein he not only confuteth your distinction as a wretched shift of helps, and intercession, taketh away your common similitude, and sheweth that intercession of any man, be he neuer so iust, not onely dothe vs no good at all, but also hindreth the matter, offendeth and abaseth God, and maketh all those playne traytors to God, that vse it.
But to be euen with him, M. St. for calling you traytors, call you him agayne heretike, call him a Vigilant an for it.
But then must ye make Chrisostome a Uigilantian with him, that is euen as earnest agaynst this shifte of intercession as he For writing vpon the woma~ of Canaan, calling vpon Christ for hir daughters health, he arth: me. &c. Haue mercy vpon me: Beholde the phisosophical minde of the woman, saying, haue mercy vpon me.
haue not (sayth she) a conscience of good workes, nor a trust to godly lyfe, to mercy flee, to the calme hauen of those that sinne, to mercy flee, where iudgement ceasseth, where vnspeakable saluation is.
Tell me, thou woman: how art thou so bolde, sithe thou arte a sinner and wicked, to come vnto God? know, sayth she, what will do.
Behold the womans wisdome, she requireth not Iames, she besecheth not Iohn, she goeth not to Peter, nor regardeth the company of the Apostles.
She sought not a mediator, but in place of all them, she tooke repentance to be hir companion, which repentance filled the roome of an Aduocate, and so she went vnto the chiefe fountayne.
For this cause (sayth she) he came downe from heauen, for this cause he was incarnate, and made man, and dare speake vnto him.
Aboue in the heauens, the Cherubins dread him, the Seraphins feare him, and heere beneath, euen a common woman sayth vnto him, haue mercy vpon me.
very bare saying, but conteyning euen the mightinesse of saluation, haue mercy vpon me.
For thys (sayth she) thou camest, for this cause thou took est fleshe, for thys cause thou wast made euen that which am.
wonderfull matter, aboue is trembling, beneath is confidence, haue mercy vpon me.
haue no neede of a mediatour, haue mercy vpon me.
VVhat hast thou neede of? mercie seeke, sayth she, &c. haue mercie vpon me.
If my daughter were dead, she shoulde not suffer such things, for then vvould haue deliuered hir bodie into the bosome of the earth, and in processe of time, should haue forgotten these euilles, and my griefe vvoulde haue paused· &c. Marke the philosophie of the woman, behold hir noble courage, she went not to soothsayers, shee called not wise men, she sought not charms to tie about hir, she fetched not those orceresse women, that vse to prouoke Diuels, and augment the ore vvith theyr enchauntmentes.
Shee lette go all suche falsehoodes of the Diuell: shee contemned all purgings, and shee came vnto the healthefull porte of oure soules. &c.
The iudge commeth to thee, flee thou to God, the Iudge doth call for thee, doe thou inuocate God, whiche is on thy syde.
Is he farre from thee, that thou shouldest goe to any place for him? God is not included in place, but he is always euen present at hand: euen he that is not shut vp in place, is holden yet by faith.
For if thou wilt enquire a man, and demaund what he doth, thou shalt heare, he sleepeth, or he is not at leysure· or in deede euen his seruant vvill disdayne to answere thee.
But vnto God there is no nede of any of these things.
But wheresoeuer thou shalt be, or wheresoeuer thou shalt inuocate him, he hereth thee: ther nedes no porter, ther needes no mediatour, there needes no seruant: but say thou, Haue mercie vpon me, and by and by God will be present, yea whyle thou yet speakest he sayeth, here am. &c.
And like wise on the same storie in an other place, Mauult nostram. &c. God had leauer haue our own prayer which are guiltie, than the prayer of other for vs.
There is no neede of patrons before God, nor nede of gadding vp and down to flatter other.
But although thou art alone, and haste no patrone, and prayest by thy selfe, yet shalt thou certainly obtain thy request: for God doth not so easily graunt, when other pray for vs, as when our selues do pray, yea though we be replenished with many euils.
And to conclude he saith, Haecigitur scientes. &c. Knowing therfore these thinges, let vs euermore flee to God, who is both willing and able to deliuer vs of oure grieues.
But as for men, if at any tyme we shoulde entreate them, it behoueth first to meete with the porters, to moue their parasites and iesters, and oftentymes to goe along way about: but in God there is no suche matter, he is intreated without mediator, without money, without cost he graunteth our prayers.
Now although we sée by the Scripture, and by these fathers, being yet therfore no Heretikes) that we néede not, nor oughte to seeke so muche as any intercessoures (by whiche terme ye woulde shifte off all the matter, saying ye make them no helpers, but intercessors only:) yet herein your shifte is not so miserable, as your lie is manifest.
Your Primers can witnesse againste you, youre Antiphonaes, your Grayles, your Massebookes, Hyuals, Legendes, Portasses. &c. Haue ye forgotten this hymne to the blessed virgine Marie? Virgo singularis inter omnes mitis, nos culpa solutos sac et castos, vita~ prfta pura~, iter para tutu~, vt videntes Iesum, semper collaetemur.
thou virgin singular among also meke: make vs loose from sinne, make vs meeke and chast: giue vs a pure lyfe and make our iourney safe: that beholding Iesus, we may alwayes ioy.
Do ye not pray in your primer to S. Iohn and the virgin Mary.
inuocate thee also with Marie the mother of the same our sauiour, that thou wouldest vouchsafto giue me thy helpe with hir, you two precious stones, heauenly Marye, Iohn, you two lightes from God, shining before God, with your rayes, driue away the cloudes of my sinnes? Doe ye not there pray to S. Christofer? thou martyr Christofer with the godlie honor of our Sauiour, make thou vs in mind to deserue the loue of God, Christ hath promised, that what thou askest thou haste obtained, giue vnto the sory people those things, that at thy death thou askedst, giue thou comfort to vs, and take away the grief of our mynde, make thou the accompt of the iudge to be milde to all men? Pray ye not to S. George on horsebacke: George the noble martyr, prayse and glory becommeth thee, &c. we beseeche thee with the bottome of our hart, that our sinnes being washed away, we may be ioyned with al the faithfull citizens of heauen? Pray ye not to the.
virgins: you eleuen thousande maidens, Lilies of glorious virginitie, and Roses of martyrdome, defende you me in my life, giuing to me your helpe, and in my death shew your selues vnto me, in bringing euerlasting comforte? Do ye not pray to the virgin Mary: Exaudi me, salua me, custodi me, Heare me, saue me, keepe me? Do not ye pray to the Apostles, blessed Apostles of God, loose me from my sinnes, defende me from the paynes of hell, and deliuer me from the power of darknesse, and bring me to the euerlasting kingdome Do ye not pray to all the virgins, beseech you all holy virgins helpe me, that may haue of hart good will, of body health, humilitie, chastitie, and after the course of this lyfe, the felowshippe of euerlasting blisse.
Do ye not pray to all the hée saincts and she saincts, euen where ye mention their intercession: all you hee and shee sainctes of God, beseeche you, and make supplication to you, succour me, haue mercy vpon me mercifully, and pray for me instantly, that by your intercession, a pure conscience, a compunction of harte, and a laudable consummation of euerlasting lyfe, may be giuen me of God, that throughe your merites may come to the countrey of euerlasting blisse? Dyd ye neuer say this prayer in your Primer: moste noble, moste excellent, and euer glorious Virgin, &c. Lady my Queene, and Lady of all creatures, whiche forsakest none, dyspysest none, nor leauest anye desolate, that wyth a good and pure hearte, humbly and deuoutly runneth to thee: despise me not for my moste greeuous sinnes, forsake me not for myne innumerable iniquities, nor for the hardnesse and vnclennesse of my harte caste me not away, from the face of thy grace and loue, but for thy moste greate mercie, and moste sweete pitie heare mee, putting firme confidence in thy mercy, and succour mee most holy and most glorious virgin Marie in all my tribulations, griefes and necessities, and also giue me councell and helpe in all my woorkes, and deliuer mee from all mine enimies, visible and inuisible, giue me vertue strength agaynst the temptations and deuises of the worlde, the fleshe, and the deuill. &c.
And in my last dayes be vnto me my helper, and comforter, and deliuer my soule, and the soule of my Father and of my mother, of my brothers and my sisters, of my parentes, my friendes, and my benfactours, and of all faithfull both liuing and dead, from the mist of eternall death, he helping thee whom thou hast borne, Iesus Christ thy sonne.
Prayed ye not to S. Erasmus, Receyue me S. Erasmus, into thy holy fayth and grace, and conserue me from all euill by these eight dayes, and giue vnto me, that may passe them ouer with a right fayth, and with all prosperitie vnto the ende of my life, and that ought of mine enimies will, preuaile not agaynst me, to thee, to thy prayse and honour, to me, to my consolation and grace, to thee S. Erasmus doe commende my body and my soule, all that are ioyned vnto in confession, and prayer, or consanguinitie, and all my doi that may liue with all prosperitie, peace and ioy now and for euer.
Ye haue in the Primer, a notable prayer to the blessed virgin, Aue domina sancta Maria &c. Haile Lady S. Marie, mother of God, Queene of heauen, port of Paradise, Ladie of the world, eternall light, Empresse of hell. &c. Ouer the head of this prayer, is set in red letters: Quicun{que} oratione~ seque~tem deuotè dixerit, promeretur quadraginta millia annorum indulgentiarum, per tot dies videbit beatam virginem ante die~ exitus sui, per quot annos continuauerit: VVhosoeuer sayth this prayer following deuoutly, shall haue fortie thousand yeares of pardon, and for so many dayes as he hath continued yeres, he shall see the blessed virgin before the day of his departure.
Likewise ouer the head of the prayer to the virgin Marie, called Aue rosa sine spiis. &c. Haile rose without thornes. &c. is printed in red letters in English: This prayer shewed our Ladie to a deuoute person, saying, that this golden prayer is the most swetest and acceptablest to me.
And in hir appearing she had this salutation and prayer written with letters of gold in hir brest.
How say ye to these prayers inuacatio~s M. St. is here nothing but Ora pro nobis? do they make saints only intercessours as ye now would beare the simple in hande, the prayers to them were nothing els but to desire them to be our intercessours? is this the comming betwene vs God, not rather the placing them in Gods seat? what left they out that they fully ascribed not vnto them· could they do any greater blasphemie to God and defacing to his Saints than this? but perhaps ye wil say, this was done in the time of too grosse ignorance and idolatrie.
Now things are more opened, the people pray not after so grosse a ma~ner.
Who were they M. St. that taught them thus to pray, was it we or you? whose plackardes pardons of sinnes are prefixed to entise tickle the people to say these prayers, ours or yours? Ha M. St. for shame yet at the length blushe at the reading of them.
All godly will tremble with horrour, to heare and sée how they blasphemed God vnwittingly, being deceiued by such blinde leaders of the blinde, the thick rymine of whose ignorance is not yet taken away fro~ the eies of a great many.
promise you M. St. this Primer (since tooke in hande to answere you) sounde deuoutly occupied in the Church, of a priuy friend of yours, dare say, had you séene it in his hands, ye would not haue taken it from him, but haue commended his Idolatrie.
And shall we thinke that in your late time of Quéene Maries raigne your selfe vsed any better Primer? Haue ye not in your English Latine primer, printed An.
by the assignes of Iohn Waylande, (all other primers forbidden to be printed) in your Mattins to the virgin Marie: Thou art the dore of the heauenly king.
Since a virgin life doth bring, ye redeemed people reioyse and sing? And againe, gloriouse mother &c. we besech thee of thy pitie, to haue vs in remembrance, and to make meanes for vs vnto Christ, that we being supported by thy help, may deserue to obtaine the kingdome of heauen.
Heree pretende hir to be but a meane maker, yet ye ascribe supporting and helpe of saluation to hir, and to your selues most arrogantly deserte of heauen.
Archangel Michael come for to succour the people of God, and shall giue thee prayse in the presence of Angels: Versicle: In thy holy temple shall to thee pray: Answere: And thy blessed name confesse alway: and yet who knoweth not, that Dauid ascribeth those wordes onely to God? Do ye not say in the prime: Wee do praise thee, and do pray thee, mother of God most mercifull: that thou entend, vs to defend, from death that is most sorowfull.
The dolorouse passion of Gods swete mother, bring vs to the blisse of almightie God the father.
What doctrine call ye this M. St. that omitting the passion of Christ we be saued by the passion of the virgin Marie? In the
virgin Mary most gracious, mother of mercie incomparable, from our enimie defend thou vs, and in the houre of death be fauorable.
And in the ninth houre, euen in a prayer to Christ: That he would giue all those that remember hir compassion, prosperouse life and euerlasting glorie, for hir sake, which wordes, for hir sake, in the middle of the prayer are (as the principall wordes thereof) onely set out in redde letters, and all the rest in blacke.
In the euensong: Hayle starre of the sea most radiant, mother of God most glorious, a pure virgine alway perseuerant, gate of heauen most gorgious, thou wast saluted with great humilitie, when Gabriell sayd Aue Maria, establish vs in peace and tra~quillitie, and change the name of sinfull Eua.
Lose the prisoners from captiuitie, vnto the blinde giue sight againe, deliuer vs from our malignitie, to the ende we may some grace attaine.
Shew thy selfe to be a mother, so that he accept our petition, which for our sake before all other, was content to be thy Sonne.
blessed Ladie, singuler virgin, in perfect meekenesse all other exceeding, deliuer vs from bondage of sinne, and make vs meeke and chast in liuing, make vs euer pure life to ensue, guide vs euer vppon our iourney, that we beholding the face of Iesu, may ioy with him in heauen alway.
Item, Holie mother succour the miserable, comforte the weake sprited, giue courage to the desperate.
In the complene, Mother of God we do glorifie thee, for thou are she that bore Christ, preserue all that glorifie thee.
Item, thou meeke mother haue mercie therefore, on wretches for whome thou haddest this paine, seing thy Sonne that vine cluster pressed sore.
And from the pestilence of death eternall, keepe vs, by voyding the feende infernall, and ioyne vs with them that renowned shal be, with eternall life seing the deitie.
Item, Haile queene of mercie, our life, our sweetnes, our hope, all hayle vnto thee do we crie, which are banished children of Eua, vnto thee do we sigh, weeping and wayling in this vale of lamentation, come of therefore our patronesse, cast vppon vs those pitifull ees of thine, and after this our banishment, shewe vnto vs the blessed fruite of thy wombe Iesus.
Item, In the heauenly habitation, where the fruite of thy wombe euerlasting we may behold through thy deseruing in ioy without limitation.
And in the prayers following: Reioyce spouse of God most deere, for as the light of the day cleere, commeth from the Sunne most radiant, euen so doest thou cause questionlesse, the worlde to florish in quietnesse through thy grace abundant.
These were the prayers that you said your selues, and taught the people to pray, in the dayes of your late tyranny M. St. and what point of inuocation is here omitted, that ye can deuise to giue to God, that ye haue not yelded to the Saintes, correcting so little the old Primer that is a great deale worse, if worse can be? And dare that impudent face of yours (to returne your termes on your selfe) still beare vs in hand ye made them but only intercessours, and all is but Ora pro nobis? haue onely hitherto master St. set ye learn your Primer, or rather to vnlearne it.
Ye haue a for the nonce of this matter, called the prayers and salutations of the blessed virgin: before which are these verse.
Euery day let this prayer be song vnto S. Marie, and you shall be saued.
The first prayer is this: Exads. &c. blessed queene of Heauen hear vs, receiue our praises that singing we offer to thee, in tend to our prayer, succor vs celebrating thy praise, reach thy hand of co~solatio~ to vs that inuocate thee, and vouchsafe to be present here with them that desire thee· &c. we co~sider the greatnesse of thy godlinesse, and to thee with sure confidence do we flee, to thee we crie lifting vp our ha~ds from the depth of iniquitie, heare thou our prayer, and deliuer thou vs from the snares of sinnes, make thou vs beeing clensed from all oure sinnes, in thy praises to bee founde woorthy, purifie thou our hearts, wherin we may worthily heape vp the remembra~ce of thee: water thou our hearts with the dew of thy sweetnesse, that the drink of bitternes which soup in may vanish away.
Let our minds defiled with the gall of sinnes, be moistned with the streame of thy goodnes. &c.
Let thy loue root in vs, and expel fro~ vs, the custome of vices and offences.
Let it lighte~ our soules, and pull away the heauie multitude of euils, let it mollifie our hardned harts, let it vouchsafe in them to make for it a worthie habitation: that thou Ladie of heauen mayst possesse the cloysters of oure breast, and with thy holie *goddeshed* maist enco~passe them, giue vnto our mindes continually to thinke on those things that are pleasing to thee, to our lips to speak those things that please thee, so that our senses and our tong in doing thee seruice, may please thee: that the fleshe and spirite remaine alvvays vnder thy protection, to thee holie Mother of God be prayse and glory and thankesgeuing, let the congregation of aintes glory in thee.
What a blasphemous prayer is this M. St. and yet the second and thirde passeth it.
Venice &c. Come you that desire the heauenly glory, and let vs praise the Empresse of heauen.
Let vs magnifie the most blessed Marie virgin, and giue glory vnto hir.
Let vs embrace her steppes in humilitie, and poure out our humble prayers vnto hir.
Let vs lift vp to hir the eies of our minde, and put firme hope in hir, for she is the saluation and medicine, the swete renowne and healthfull refuge to them that put their trust in hir, she is the mother of mercie and godlinese, the mercifull and most godly comforter of the miserable, for she defendeth all those that serue hir, from all aduersities, and enricheth them with the crowne of glory.
In the third prayer: Thou our most mercifull mother, clense vs from our dayly sinnes, &c. thou ate our true hope and consolation, thou arte the sweete refection of our minde, thou art our saluation and medicine, heare vs thy serua~ts that trust in thee.
What sacrifice shal we offer to thee Ladie? with what praises can we worship thee? what thanks can we, can our basenesse, giue thee? or what honour can we do to thee, with what deuocion shal we serue thee? which by thy only chastitie hast found the entra~ce of helth, &c. despie not vs that put our trust in thee.
VVee trust in thee, and thee our aide we inuocate, &c.
Thou with Christ possessest the imperiall honor, &c. Cast thy godly eies on vs, and search the inwarde partes of our harts, &c.
VVithout thee euery soule is as an vnfruitfull tree worthy to be rooted vp, and to be cast into the wasting fire.
Our soule lusteth after thee thou noble mother of God when wilt thou visit it? come lady and sometimes visite thy seruants least our vertue aint, &c.
Our soule is wihered and made baren bicause we haue not deserued to haue thy grace.
Come mother come, and moysten it, that it may somtimes bring forth fruit, that it may be fruitful being bedewed with thy grace and bring forth pleasant fruite to thee.
prayer: VVhom God and thou the inuincible mother of God wilt vouchsafe to help, they shall endure.
Ladie heare the sighes of thy seruants, and hasten to help them that trust in thee.
Looke downe from thy high trone of heauen, where thou raignest with thy so~ne, &c.
Of al wretches he is most wretch, that neglecteth to get thy grace, &c. he is iust indeede and worthy the felowship of the iust, that deserueth in his seruice to please thee, he shall not be confounded in the last iudgement, when he shall see his Lady the iudges mother, and shall see thee with him iudging him.
He shall cast his eyes on thee, and he shall not tre~ble, for thou wilt not forget him, &c.
In all our grieues let vs runne to the loue of thee, &c.
Haile prayse of the continent, vertue and strength of the maried, mother of the fatherlesse, succour of widdowes, haile firme and vnmoueable hope of all the faithful, hayle myrth and ioy of Christians, &c. behold we co~mend body and soule to thee, yea all the gouernance of our whole life, we co~mende into thy holy ha~ds, we offer our selues to serue thee, dispise not our oblations, &c.
Be present with vs lady, as we trust in thee, that art the remedie of all euill, &c. that thou being our guide we may come streight to heauen.
Now M. St. is all this neither, nothing els but Ora pro nobis? well, could yet bring more, more horrible stuffe tha~ this.
Yea it were infinite to tedious, to rake out those most blasphmous prayers, that all your other bookes haue.
Your self could neuer abide the reading for shame, nor the godly susteyne y^ hearing for horrour, to see God so blasphemed, spoiled of al his honor, of yt which he is a ielouse God wil co~municate no part therof to other.
Only (to swéeten your lips withal) ye shal heare a few stories out of your legende, other your holy bookes, what ye ascribe to saints.
And first to begin euen at the intercession that ye say the Saints make for vs, chiefly the virgine Marie, whom ye make farre more mercifull than Christ.
To proue this, ye tell vs: That a certaine wicked sinner going about his sinne, by the way (as his manner was to salute hir Image with an Aue) beholding the Image of the virgin, and hir sonne in hir armes, he saw that the bloud distilled from the childe, as it did from his woundes on the Crosse.
VVhich when he saw, being astonied thereat he said: ladie who hath done this? to whome the virgin answered.
And she would haue wiped and stanched the bloud, but she could not.
To whom ({quod} the sinner) mother of mercie make intercession for me.
She answered to him, You sinners call mee the mother of mercie, ye make me the mother of miserie and sorow.
And he said, not so most godly ladie· but remember that thou art the aduocate of sinners, and make intercession for me.
And the mother said: most godly sonne, for the loue of me be merciful to this sinner.
And hir sonne said to hir: No mother, nor thou oughtest to be grieued in that heare thee not.
For prayed once my father, if it were possible to saue ma~kind some other way, and take from me the cup of my passion, and he would not heare me.
And she sayd, my son, remember that cherished thee with motherly loue, and fed thee with my papps, forgiue then this sinner.
mother ({quod} the sonne) will shew that by good right am not bound to heare thee.
VVe plead not right ({quod} the mother) but flie to mercie, and therefore for thy mercies sake, be mercifull to this sinner.
To whom hir sonne said, prayde my father twice, that if it were possible the cup should parte from me, and he heard me not.
To whom his mother answered: my sonne, remember my trauailes and paines, that haue susteyned with thee, and giue me this sinner.
Mother quoth the Sonne be not vexed, bicause will not heare thee, but remember that prayed thrice, and was not hearde.
VVith that the mother set downe hir Sonne, and would haue fallen downe to his feete.
VVhich hir Sonne seing, saide vnto hir: what is that ye will doe Mother? will (quoth she) lie before thy feete with this sinner so long, till thou graunt him pardon.
God forbid this mother (quoth the sonne) for it is ordayned in the diuine lawe, that the sonne ought to honour his mother, and iustice concludeth, that the lawgiuer fulfill himself the law.
Then sith am thy sonne, and thou my mother, will honour thee in this sinner, and for thy sake forgiue him al his sinnes, and in toke~ of peace betwene him and me, let him come and kysse my wounds, and so the sinner healed all the wounds of Chryst with his kisse.
How say you M. Stapleton, was not this propre stuffe to be printed, euen for information to Preachers to instruct the people, with almost so manie blasphemies as there bee lines, besides the ridiculousnesse of the whole tale? But tell it for your conceytes of hir intercession, making hir a great deale more mercifull than Chryst.
The like tale within a Sermon or two after, or rather a more fonde tale he telleth of an vnthrift that hauing wasted his goods, gaue himselfe to the diuell for riches.
Of whome the diuell required, that he should renie the highest, and so he did.
To whom the diuell aunswered that his worke was yet vnperfecte, excepte he renounced the mother of the highest: for it is she that doth vs most harme.
For looke whome the sonne by iustice destroyeth, the mother by mercie and pardon doth saue.
VVhiche the yong man hearing, he was sore adrad and troubled aboue measure, and answered he woulde neuer doe it.
To whome the Coniurer sayde: you haue denied the Creator, stick not man to denie the Creature: no (quoth he) that will neuer doe, had rather alway begge my breade.
The yong man retourning, came by a chapell, where was the picture of the blessed Virgin, holding hir childe in hir armes: and he began to inuocate hir with all his heart, and by the merites of hir, repented earnestly, calling instantly vpon the Virgin Marie, for he durst not call vppon the highest, whom he had denied.
VVith that, he hearde the mother speake to hir sonne in hir armes, saying: my most sweete Sonne be mercifull to this man.
To whom hir Sonne would not speake one worde, but writhed his face from hir.
And when againe she besought hir Sonne for him, he turned his backe to his mother, and said he hath renied me, what shall doe to him? when she saw this, she set downe the childe on the altare, and fell at his feet, saying: beseech thee sonne, that for me thou wilt forgiue him: and streight the infant lift vp his mother, and sayde: mother, coulde neuer denie thee any thing, beholde for thy sake, forgiue him all.
Thus ye made the mother farre more mercyfull and louing than Christe, and that forgiuenesse of sinnes is in hir name, and for hir sake.
And made the people by these tales beléeue, that it was a more heynous offence to denye the blessed Uirgin, than it was to renounce oure Sauioure Christe.
The same authour telleth yet a more fonde and wicked tale.
How S. Dominike on a night saw Christe standing in the ayre, shaking in his hand three speares against the world, and his mother ranne hastily againste him, and demaunded him what he would doe, and he sayd to hir: All the worlde is full of vices, of pride, of luxurie, and of auarice, and therfore will destroye them with these three speares, then the blessed virgin fell downe at his feete· and sayd: Deare sonne, haue pitie. and tarrie thy iustice by thy mercie.
And Iesus Christ sayd to hir: Seest thou not howe many vvrongs and iniuries they haue done to mee? And she answered, Son attemper thy wrathe, and tarie a little, haue a true seruaunt, and a noble fighter against the vices, he shal runne ouer all, and vanquishe the worlde, and subdue them vnder thy seignorie, and shall giue him an other seruaunt into his helpe, that shall fighte as hee dothe.
And oure Lorde her sonne sayde, am appeased, and receyue thy prayer.
But woulde see vvhome thou wilte sende in so greate offence.
And so the tale telleth, howe she fette and presented vnto him Saincte Dominicke and S. Frauncis, and howe Christe praysed them.
And thus once the worlde was saued by hir, and hir two champions.
On the other syde of the leafe, as a confirmation to this, is declared howe an other tyme, a deuout Ladies chaplein, called sir William, dyd see Christe sitte in his throne, and on his right hand an angell standing with a trumpet, whom Christe with a cleere voyce, in the hearyng of all the armie of heauen, bad blowe.
And when he had blovven, the blast was so mightie, that all the worlde shooke, as it had bene a leafe on a tree, to whome Christe sayde the seconde tyme, Blovve, and he blevve as before.
But the Virgin Mary mother of mercie, knovvyng that yf he blevve agayne, all the vvorlde vvere ended, (the other Sainctes being all husht) shee starte vp, and fell at hir Sonnes feete, and besoughte him vvith muche adoe to deferre his sentence, and spare the worlde.
To vvhome Christe aunsvvered, Mother, all the vvorlde is sette on wickednesse, and doe so prouoke me vvith their sinnes, that neither ought to suspende my sentence, nor spare man.
Sith not only the laitie, but the clergie also, yea the Monkes haue vtterly corrupted theyr vvayes, and offende me from day to daye.
And then sayde his mother, My deare son spare them, though not for those wicked ones, yet at the least for my frends sakes: and so Christ vvas pleased once againe.
An other tyme the matter wente so harde, that the Uirgin Maries image fell a sweating so fast in the Church, that all the people maruelled.
And the cause was this, The sonne of Marie had euen stretched oute his arme, to strike the vvorld, and if his mother had not run the quicklier, and stayed his arme, the vvorlde had bene destroyed ere novve.
This is the intercession that youre Church ascribeth to hir M. Stapleton, makyng hir a greate deale more prone to mercie, than Christ the fountain of mercie, and mercie it selfe, by these youre wicked and blasphemous fables.
But what said I· should haue said by these your holy histories and deuoute sermons.
But sée withall what true doctrine ye teache, that the sainctes do pray for the deferring of the kingdome of God, where Christe teacheth vs to pray, that he would vouchsafe to hasten his kingdom, saying, Let thy kingdome come: And willeth the godlie to lift vp their heads when they shall heare of the signes thereof: and sayth, that vnlesse God should shorten those dayes, no fleshe should be saued: and he will cut them off, for the electes sake.
And the Martirs slaine for the worde of God, doe long still for his co~ming, and crie: How long Lord, which art holie and true, wilt thou not iudge the worlde, and reuenge oure bloud, of those that dwell in the earth.
And there were giuen to them white garmentes, and they were bidde rest a whyle, till the number of theyr felow seruants and brethren were fulfilled, that should be slayne likewise.
And the spirite and the spouse sayth come, and he that heareth, let him say, Come. &c.
And your Church saith (As an harlot that is afrayde of the husbands comming) come not.
And ye tell vs that the blessed Uirgin hath nowe thrée tymes stayed backe his arme, and wil not lette him come.
You haue hitherto ascribed verie muche, and much more than ought to be ascribed to a creature, but do ye go no further? ye pretende that the death of Christ is auaylable: but no further than the blessed virgin doth obtain it at his ha~d by hir mercie.
What a tale is that ye tel vs, euen where as ye mention the bloud of Christe? howe a certains noughtie religious man, vsing notwithsta~ding to say an hundreth Aue Maries euery day, the deuils brought him béeing dead in his sinnes before Christ to be iudged.
With that came the blessed virgin and offred the papers, wherein the Aue Maries wer written, desiring Christ to go to iudgeme~t once again.
The deuils seeing that, brought all the bookes of his sinnes, and when the balance was peysed, his sinnes did ouerwey the Auies, which séeing, the virgin besought Christ, saying: Thou art my sonne, the bloud that thou hast, thou hast of me, pray thee giue me one droppe thereof.
To whome (quoth Christ) mother am not able to denie it thee, then Marie put in the ballance the droppe of bloud togither with hir merits, and then that part weyed downe to the grounde: so that the deuils went crying away.
Our Ladie is too mercifull to Christians, we euer fayle where she medleth with vs. Ladie it is not good contending with thee.
What a derogation is this to Chist? And where ye graunt most to the bloud of Christ, where ye would salue the matter with intercession, euen there ye say, not that he will vouchsafe to graunt hir petition, but that he is not able to gainesay it, yea that it is not lawfull for him to denie it, For (sayth Cardinall Uigerius) Dixit Salomon.
&c. Salomon sayd to his mother, aske mother what you will, for it is not lawfull for me, to turne away my face from hir that bare me.
VVhat shall wee thinke other than this, the Lorde Iesus Christ to say to his mother, who is farre wiser and iuster than Salomon? And his reason is this, Salomons mother had midwiues, nources, bearers of the child and instructours: but Marie was all this hir selfe, and so Christ is more bounde to his mother, than Salomon to Bethsabée.
And therefore if we will worship Christ, wée must first go to his mother.
For as sayth Iacobus de Voragine: as Eue was in the middest betweene the serpent and the man, so Marie making our reconciliation, is in the midst betwene God and man.
What a dubble blasphemie is this? First that our reconciliation is made by any other than Christ, of whom the Apostle sayth: If when we were yet enimies, we were reconciled to God, by the death of his sonne: much more, seeing we are reconciled, we shall be preserued by his life, nor yet onely so, but also glorying in God, through our Lorde Iesus Christ, by whome we haue nowe obteyned reconciliation.
Secondly, that we haue any other mediatour than Christ, wher as the apostle sayth: Unus deui. &c.
There is one God and one mediatour of God and man, the man Christe Iesus, neyther will your shift serue you to cloake youre blasphemie, that ye make hir a mediatour of intercession: for lo here, he maketh hir a mediatour, of making the attonement and reconciliation betwene mankinde and God, which as it is our very redemption, so is it the proper office of Christ alone.
He is ou peace, whiche hath made one of both, hath broken downe the wall that was a stop betweene vs, and also hath done away through his flesh the cause of hatred, that is to say, the lawe of commaundements, conteyned in the lawe written, for to make of twaine one new man in himselfe, so making peace: and to reconcile both vnto God, in one bodie through his Crosse, and slue hatred thereby.
For through him we both haue an open way, in one spirite vnto the father.
Nes per mediatorem Christum reconciliamur deo. VVe are reconciled to God by Christ being the mediator.
What blasphemie then is this in you, to spoyle Christ hereof, and giue it to the virgine Marie, and make hir as much the instrument and meane of our reconciliation, as Eue was the instrument and meane of our perdition.
But in this entrance of our perdition, though both Adam Eue were culpable, and both (being one flesh) are comprehended vnder the name of one, and that of Adam the husband, as the Apostle sayth, Death reigned from Adam to Moses, eue~ ouer them also that sinned not with like tra~sgression as did Adam, which is the similitude of him that is to come: Yet afterward S. Paule noting the meane, by whome properly the sinne entred first, affirmeth that Adam was not deceyued, but the woman was deceyued, and was in transgression.
If then ye make the like proportion of our reconciliation fro~ Adam to Christ, from Eue to ye virgin: then as Eue properly was the very originall and cause of the transgression, though Adam (being the assenter) bare the name therof: then properly the virgin is the very original, cause of our reconciliation, and Christ is but an assenter, so beares but the name thereof.
What a wicked doctrine is this M. S.· and is this now nothing els but ora pro nobis? Might not Christ rather say ora pro nobis to hir, syth ye giue hir all, him a bare name only? Now to the confirming of this blasphemous doctrine, commeth in another of hir Chaplayues, crying, foemina super omma. &c. woman that art aboue all things, and blessed of all things, the fore elect and most worthie vessell, framed of the first artificer, the treasorie of the diuine giftes, god hath chosen forechosen thee, that God and man might dwell nine Monethes in thy tabernacle.
dare boldly say, that euen for the Virgin conceyued in Gods minde, many thousande yeares before shee was borne, mankinde was preserued in his beeing.
For it is euident that for their first transgression, Adam and Eue deserued not onely death, but euen the vtter rooting them out to nothing.
And the diuine vengeance which knoweth not the accepting of persons, as it left not vnpunished the aungels offence, so woulde it not haue left vnpunished mankindes offence: but our first parents were preserued, that they were not consumed to nothing, for the chiefest reuerence that he had to the virgin, for he loued hir aboue all creatures that should be created, and not vnited vnto God.
The reason is, that this Mayden was in the loynes of Adam, as concerning the sede.
And the power of bringing forth the mayden, was imprinted in the first father, tyll shee were in deede brought foorth.
But of hir Iesus ought to be borne, who was in Adam onely, after his bodily substance, to be brought forth of the virgin, and of none other: God therefore did spare oure first parentes, nor consumed them to nothing, bicause that so shee had not beene borne, and by consequence Iesus neyther, nor God had put on flesh.
Therefore by this noble creature, God did saue our first parentes from the transgression: and Noe from the floud: and Abraham from the slaughter of the Kinges: Isaac from Ismaell: Iacob from Esau: the Iewish people from Aegypt, from Pharaos hande, from the redde Sea, from the force of dyuerse Kinges and Tyrauntes, from Nabuchodonozor, and from the captiuitie of Babilon: Dauid from the Lion, from Goliah and from Saule.
And to conclude, all the fauourings, and deliuerances made in the olde testament, doubt not but God did them, for the loue of this mayden, and for the worship of hir, whom God had from without beginning foreordeyned to be set aboue all his workes.
outragious blasphemie where is Christ? How agréeth this with S. Paules doctrine, that Christ is the image of the inuisible god, the first begotten of all creatures, for by him were all things created, things that are in heauen, things that are in earth, things visible, things inuisible, whether they be Maiestie or Lordship, either rule or power, al things are created by him and in him, be is before all things, and in him all things haue their being, and he is the head of the bodie, that is to wit, of the congregation, he is the beginning and first begotten, that in all thinges he might haue the preheminence, for it pleased the father that in him all fulnesse should dwell, and by him to reconcile all things to him selfe, and to set at peace by him, through the bloud of his Crosse, both things in heauen, and things in earth.
Here is no mencion at all of hir, but all of him (master Stapleton) for whome all things were made.
But euen these properties of Christ, this blasphemous doctour applieth to hir, and sayth: your Church doth so.
For a little before he sayth: Sed hoc loco. &c.
But in this place is to be asked whether the blessed virgin were brought forth before all creatures? For of hir sayth the Church that saying.
From the beginning and before the worlde was made, and againe in the Epistle of this solemnitie, the Virgine is brought in saying that sentence.
The Lord hath possessed me from the beginning of his wayes before he made any thing, euen from the beginning, from euerlasting was ordeyned, and from of olde before the earth was made, as yet the depthes were not, and was alreadie begotten, as yet the fountaynes flowed not with water, nor as yet the mountaynes in their great compasse were setled, before all the hilles was begotten.
VVhich wordes doe seeme so to sounde, that she was brought forth, before the bringing forth of any other thing.
Who is he that knoweth not that these wordes are spoken of the eternall sonne of God begotten before all ages, and is euen one wyth that S. Iohn sayth, In the beginning was the worde? and yet bicause it is spoken in the feminine gender, vnder the name of the eternall wisedome of God, he most ignoranly and Idolatrously transferreth it to the virgin Marie.
Neyther he alone, but he sayth your Church doth so, so that all your whole Church is a blasphentous Church.
And thus ye ascribe the promise of the blessed seede, to the blessed virgine saying, not it, but shee shall tread downe the serpents heade So where Dauid sayth, Non est qui se abscondat alore None can hide him from his heate: ye say none can hide him from hir heate.
Likewise where the wisedome of God sayth: In the welbeloued Citie gaue he me rest, in Hierusalem was my power.
Iacobus de Udragine, applieth it to hir, saying, Primo pater. &c.
in Hierusalem was my power: for she is made so mightie, that she can help vs in life, in death, and after death.
&c. Againe where Christe sayth, am exalted like a Palme tree aboute the bankes, and as a rose Palme in Hierico, as a fayre Oliue tree in a pleasant fielde, that ascribeth he to hir, saying: Sunt enim quidam. &c.
There are some Saints, who when they are prayed vnto, follow the information of their conscience, and therefore often tymes they will not pray to God for vs, bicause they haue a conscience, that they are not worthie to be heard.
Other Saintes there are, that when they are prayed vnto, they follow the streightnesse of Gods righteousnesse.
And therefore if they be desired, and knowe that this is not fitte for Gods iustice, they dare not aske: but the blessed Virgin, neither looketh to conscience, nor to iustice, but to mercie.
As who should say, let them keepe their consciences to themselues that lust, and let them that will, loke to Gods iustice: will alwayes hold me to mercie, and for this so excellent Modestie shee sayth of hir selfe.
Yea you say shée hath such excéeding and excelling mercie, that not onely it passeth all the Saints, but that, illud quod dicitur.
The mercie of a man is towarde his neighbour, but the mercie of the Lorde is ouer all flesh.
Thus ye robbe God of his glory to adourne hir, attributing all to hir.
And say that the father hath written in hir his power, where Christ sayth contrarie, all povver is giuen me of my father in heauen and earth.
&c. that the sonne hath vvritten in hir his vvisedome: that the holy ghost hath vvritten in hir his goodnesse and mercie.
Againe, the father hath made hir his Treasorer, vvhereby shee hath conquered the Deuill, and povvreth into cur mindes diuine knovvledge.
Shee is Chauncellour to the holy ghost, shee is Porter of Paradise.
For shee is the doore, by the vvhich vve enter into Paradise, vvhich by Eue vvas shutte, and by hir is opened.
Ipsa enim est quae nos suis meritis in atrium principis introducit.
For it is shee that by hir merits bringeth vs into the porch of the Prince.
Damsell, that was the doore keeper (the blessed virgine calleth hirselfe an handemayde or Damsell) let in Peter into the Princes porche, Ipsa nan{que} virgo.
For euen the virgin is the vvindovv vvherby God beholdeth vs vvith the eie of mercie.
The Virgin Marie is the throne of mercy, grace and glorie: she is the Sunne to the iust, the Moone to the Saints, the faithful vvitnesse to sinners, the aduocate of mankinde, the drop that softneth all hardnesse.
There vvere three things that once vvere hard: God, that receyued none to mercie: Death that svvalovved vp all to hell: the Deuill that enraged vvith enmitie.
But the Virgin Marie so mollified God, that he receiued all men to mercie.
She so trodde death vnder foote, that novve he can not take avvay the Saints.
Shee ouercame the Deuill that he can novve· deceyue none, but him that lust to be deceyued: that novv shee may say forsake you not, but as a drop abyde vvith you, bicause my odour abydeth vvith you, vvherevvith haue mollifyed God, haue troden dovvne death, haue ouercome the Deuill.
This is one droppe of hir grace, master Stap. but what can ye ascribe more to al the droppes of the bloud of Christ.
To conclude ye make hir all in all, Shee lenseth vs from our sinnes· shee lightneth vs from ignorance, she strengthneth vs from our infirmities.
Et per ipsam virg. &c. and by the blessed virgin Marie.
Euery man euen as by a gate, ascendeth to heauen.
By these immoderate prayses, or rather outragious blasphemies, Master Stapleton, ye stirred the people (quite neglecting Christ) to inuocate the Uirgine Marie.
And ye exemplifie it by fables to confirme the people therein.
Ye tell vs how an Abbot and his holy Couent sayling in a tempest: one called on Saint Nicholas, an other on Saint Andrewe, and euerie one vppon his peculier Patrone (but none called vpo~ God) the Abbot chod them all, and bad them call on the mother of mercie.
Ye tell vs of many other, that being vexed with spirites, haue sought manye remedies, nowe holy water, nowe one thing, nowe another, yea they haue called vpon Christ, vpon the Trinitie, and haue had so little helpe, that they haue rather bene much worse: onely, when they were taught to lift vp their handes, and crie, Saint Marie helpe me: then forthwith the spirite hath fled away all afrayde, as he had beene smitten with a stone, and sayde the cursed deuill enter into his mouth, that hath taught thee that: and so being vanquished, neuer came againe.
Ye tell vs a noble Storie of a Spanish woman called Lucie, to whome for saluting the virgin Marie, the virgin, at the deliuerance of hir childe, came and was the midwife, and at the Christning the Godmother and Christ the Godfather, and the childe was named after the Godmother, and called Marianus.
And how at hir Churching, Christ himselfe sang Masse, and how at the offertorie, Lucie was preferred to go and offer and kisse the Priestes hande before the virgine Marie, and what honour the Uirgin gaue hir aboue hir selfe, saying, This is your day of Churching now, was churched long ago.
Ye tell vs of a Strumpet, that all hir life did no good work, saue that she would say an Aue Marie, and heare a Masse on Saterday (which ye call our Ladies day, as Sunday is called the Lordes day) and on hir death bed this harlot sayde, Ladie Queene and mother, though did neuer any good, yet trust to thy mercie, and to thee commende my spirite.
And when the fiends would haue taken hir soule, the mother of mercie tooke hir soule from them, saying, do ye not knowe that shee saluted me dayly, and euery Saterday heard a Masse, and at hir death commended hir soule to me? And when they alleaged hir sinnes, tell you (quoth shée) that soule was neuer damned that serued mee, and commended it selfe to me, and so she draue them away and caryed the soule with hir.
Ye tell vs of a knight that neuer did other good, but at morning and Euening say an Aue Marie, and by the grace of the Virgin he was saued.
And hereon ye conclude a rule, Quod orandum sit, &c.
That at the poynt of death we must pray, mother of grace, mother of mercie, defende thou vs from the enimie, and keepe vs in the hower of death.
It is impossible hee should perish, syth by the vertue of the Aue Marie, the worlde was renued.
And that Redempturus deus genus humanu vniuersum precium contulit in Mariam: sine ea nihil possumu, sine ea miseri sumus, sine ea factum est nihil.
God going about to redeeme mankinde, conferred al the price therof vpon Mary.
VVithout hir we ca~ do nothing, without hir we are wretches, without hir nothing was made.
To conclude, ye make hir to be all in all.
And as Albertus Magnus in his booke of hir prayses, saith: Est autem opus, &c.
The booke of the beginning of the Lordes incarnation, describing the mysterie of our redemption, to the prayse, honour and glorie of the most glorious, and alonly, truly, honorable aboue euery Creature, the virgin mother of God.
By the most speciall confidence of whole helpe, we take this worke in hande.
And in the mercie of hir, euen as in the most firme anchore of our hope, we looke for the ende of the perfourmance, and the rewarde of the labour.
VVho is the moouer of the wil, the cause of the worke, and the beholder of the intention.
Thus blasphemously ascribeth Albertus, all these things to hir, euen in the Preface of his booke.
But what excéeding more blasphemies he filleth his volume withall, were infinite to recite.
Looke your selfe M. St. if with shame ye can sustaine to reade them.
Neither is all this, the errours of priuate men, but the dooing of all your whole Church.
For, euen in the solemnities of your Masse, haue ye not in the Sequences of our Ladies Masses (as ye cal them) Aue terrarum domina, &c. Haile ladie of the earth, holy queene of heaue~, let the heauens and all the company of saincts bring forth melodie to thee, the la~ds, the floudes, the woods, and groaues resound, &c. By thee mother, we craue that the childrens sinnes be abolished, and we be all brought to the euerlasting ioyes of Paradise.
Againe, Seda nobis bella, Appease thou warres, hayle, starre of the seas, thou mother giue to vs the true peace, giue vs help, changing the name of Eue. Driue away our euils, drawing vs without bitternesse, forgiue vs our crimes, aske al good things, let the Sonne and the Father be giuen by thee mother, &c. that which Eue hath taken away, thou only, mother, giuest.
Through thee, the people recouer their former lost strength, thou art the gate of the high King, by the which gate we enter into the court.
And againe: The ladie of the world &c. is the cause of our saluation, the gate of life.
Againe: Pray euery man to hir in euery houre, and call thou vppon hir defence.
Sing, sing, Aue Maria, with the force of thy harte· with thy voice, with thy vow, &c.
And in the third reason that ye giue, why ye dedicate the Saterday to hir, as the Sonday to the Lord: ye say in redde letters, Tertia ratio est, &c.
The third reason is, bicause the Saterday is the gate and entra~ce to the Sonday, but the Sonday is the day of rest, and betokeneth eternall life.
VVherevpon when we be in the grace of our Ladie, we are as it were in the gate of Paradise.
Therefore, bicause euen she is to vs the gate to the kingdome of heauen, which is figured by the Sonday, we keepe for the solemnitie of hir, the Seuenth day, which goeth before the Sonday.
Thus doth your whole Church (yea and that in your holy Masse booke) ascribe to hir euen as much as any of the other.
What say ye now to all this M. Stap. haue ye any shifte of descant to runne vnto, any distinction behinde to alleage, any figge leafe to couer your shame, that all this kinde of inuocation may be thought no Idolatrie to a creature, nor blasphemie to God? well, if all this will not serue, giue me pray you occasion hereafter, to shew yet furder many mo farre worse abhominations than all these.
But thinke you be ashamed alreadie, and will confesse, that there are at the least some abuses.
But what soeuer you will graunt, dare say some of your side (that would neuer haue beleeued such wickednesse to haue bene wrought, such doctrine to haue bene taught and printed) will hereafter haue more regarde of their owne soules health, than to beléeue such false Prophets as you.
For, how will ye spare to deceyue them, that spared not to blasphenie God? If ye say it was not generall, haue shewed you in many of your owne confessions, yea euen in the Masse booke, that it was the publike seruice of your Churche.
If ye say it was reformed in the later times: haue shewed ye, euen your last Primers and Masse bookes, set foorth and authorized in Queene Maries reigne, to conteyne as Idolatrouse and blasphemouse prayers as did the other.
If ye say it was but Intercession and meditation: haue shewed ye, that it was not onely helpe, mercie, grace and euerlasting lyfe, but euen as muche that ye ascribed to the mother of Christ, as for your liues ye can deuise to giue to Christ, yea and that many times ye giue much more to hir than to him.
If ye say now, that one breakes no square, all this is but to one, and that to the Mother of God: Although this were to vile an excuse, for any Christian eares to heare, and the question is, whether any besides God is to be inuocated: yet not withstanding, it is euen as false, as all your other excuses.
For ye haue not so stinted, ye haue not onely inuocated other besides, and that not onely as intercessours, with Orate pronobis: but ascribed helpe to them also.
Yea there is not almost one Saint mencioned in the whole Legende, to whome ye attribute not some or other proper vertue, wherein ye inuocate him or hir, not onely to be an Intercessour and Aduocate, but to be an helper, patrone, defender, deliuerer, and the giuer of it.
Yea as it is declared in the life of S. Peter, euen as the Heathen did make menne their Goddes, you make likewise the Saintes your Gods.
Do ye not tell vs, how in the time of S. Cornelius the Pope: Greekes stale away the bodies of the Apostles Peter and Paule, but the Diuels that were in the Idols, were constrayned by the diuine vertue of God.
And cried, and sayde, ye men of Rome succour hastely your Gods, which be stolen fro~ you.
This ye say, they cried being constrained therto by the diuine powre.
And thus as ye make them Gods to go before you, helpe you in euery thing, so ye inuocate them, and giue them godheads.
If now Vigilantius were liuing, should crie out of your blasphemouse inuocation, should he be an heretike therfore? yea surely should he with you M. Stapl. and all that speake against you.
But pray you, let S. Augustine be his companion in this heresie.
Non ad creaturam (saith he) debemu tendere, sed ad ipsum creatorem, de quo si aliud quàm oportet, ac sese res habeat, nobis persuadetur, perniciosissimo errore decipimur.
VVee ought not to go to a creature, but euen to the verie creator, of whome, if we persuade our selues any other thing, than the truth is, we are deceyued with a most perniciouse errour.
This is his iudgement of all these your wicked fables.
As for the assertion that we holde against you, that we haue to God no other aduocate to call vppon, but our Sauiour Iesus Christ, would he haue called vs Heretikes, or Scismatikes, thinke you, or Uigilantians therefore? no saith he, Iesum Christum iustum ipsum &c. Wee haue euen Iesus Christ him selfe the aduocate to the Father, he is the propitiation of our sinnes, he that hath helde this hath made no heresie, he that hath helde this hath made no Scisme.
So that we are here cleared of heresie, and the Scisme and Heresie lighteth on your selfe Master Stapleton.
As for your fonde distinction, S. Augustine reiecteth, of intercession betwéene God and vs, as false, and no true Religion.
Religat nos religio (saithe he) vni omnipotenti ·Deo, quia intermentem nostram, &c. Religion is that, that bindeth vs to the onely almightie God.
Bicause, betweene our minde, with the which we vnderstande the Father, and the truth, that is the light by the which we vnderstande him, there is no creature put betweene.
thus confuteth your distinction of intercession, so would he haue your foolishe dotage on Saintes corrected, in thinking you did them honour in seruing them, when they reioyce if we serue onely God, and are offended, that ye should ascribe suche honour and seruice as ye did vnto them.
Non libenter They take it not (sayth he) in good parte, yea they know it is not lawfull to giue it to any but to God, Cui vni fas esse nouerunt, To whom onely they knovve it is lavvful.
And therfore those Saints that ye write, appeared to such and suche Heremites, Monkes, or Nunes, and woulde thus and thus be honored, fasted for, prayed vnto, serued and called vpon, were but either the deuils illusions in their names, or your owne inuentions: and he would haue counelled you in this maner: No~ ergo creaturae puius creator serutamus, euanscamus in cogitationibus nostris, Let vs not rather serue a creature than the Creator, lest we vanish away in our own imaginations, as in these fables you haue giuen to a creature, more than to the Creator.
Neyther the excellencie of the creature can excuse you, that bicause she is so excelle~t a creature, ye may make supplications to hir, although ye might so do to none besides: No sayth S. Aug. Uni deo, semper, in omnibus, nulli autem quantum ut excellenti creaturae supplicandum.
VVee muste make supplication to God only, and that alwayes, and in all things, but to no creature neuer so muche excellent.
But since ye would before haue proued vs heretikes by Epiphanius: let vs sée if nowe ye will stande to Epiphanius iudgement, in the inuocation euen of the virgin Marie.
For euen then began this erroure, by the seducing of false and ignorant priestes, and the superstitious people, to take roote, so that in déede ye may vaunt of antiquitie of this errour, but other than a wicked errour, be it neuer so olde, neyther you can make it now, nor Epiphanius tooke it then other wise.
He calleth it follie, superstition, blasphemie, furie, madnesse, the worship that certain women gaue hir in his tyme: and yet was it not the hundreth part so much, as the Papists in our tyme haue giuen to hir. Reuera sanctum: &c.
In deede (sayth he) the bodie of Marie was holye, but God it was not.
The Virgin was a Virgin in deede and honorable, but she was not giuen to vs to be worshipped, but hir selfe worshipped him that was borne of hir, who came to hir from heauen out of his fathers bosome.
And for this cause dothe the Gospell arme vs, telling that whiche the Lorde spake, woman, what haue to do with thee, mine houre is not yet come, least any should thinke, the holy virgin to be more excellent, he calleth hir woman, as it were, prophecying suche thinges, as by reason of sectes shoulde come to passe on the earth.
Least that any bodye maruelling too muche at the holy Virgin, slippe into this heresie, and these dotages.
For, all the handling of thys heresie, is but a mockerie, and as a man maye saye, an olde wyues tale.
For what Scripture hathe euer declared, whiche of the Prophetes commaunded man to be worshipped? muche lesse a woman, shee is in deede an excellent vessell, but a woman: and nothing chaunged from hir nature.
Shee is honorable in honoure, bothe in vnderstanding and sense, euen as are the bodies of the Sainctes.
And if to hir glorifying should haue sayde somewhat more, euen as Helias a virgin from his mother, and so still remayning, was translated, and sawe not deathe: euen as Iohn that leaned on the Lordes breast, whome Iesus loued: euen as sainct Thecla.
Yea Marie is yet more honorable, for the dispensation of the mysterie: wherewith shee was made woorthie: But neither Helias is to be worshipped, althoughe he be yet alyue: neither is Iohn to be worshipped, althoughe by his prayers he obtayned his wonderfull sleepe, or rather hee obtayned grace of God: Nor yet Thecla, neyther any Saynct is worshipped.
For the auncient errour shall not master vs, that leauing the lyuing God, wee shoulde worshippe those thinges that are made of hym.
For they worshipped and honoured the Creature more than the Creator, and became fooles.
If he wyll not haue Angels to be adored, howe muche more will he not haue hir, whiche was engendred of Anne, which was giuen to Anne of Ioachim, which by their prayers, and all their diligence, according to the promise to hir father and mother was giuen, yet was she not engendred beyonde the nature of men, but as all are of the seede of a man, and the wombe of a woman.
For it is vnpossible for any to bee engendred on earth, beyonde the nature of man.
Only it was sitting for him: nature gaue place to him alone: he, as the work master, and hauing powre of the matter, fourmed him self of the Virgin, as it were of the earth.
VVho beeing God the word, discended fro~ heauen· and put on flesh of the Virgin Mary, but not that the Virgin shoulde be worshipped, not that he would make hir a God, nor that we should offer in the name of hir, &c. he suffred hir not to giue baptisme, nor to blesse the disciples, he bad hir not rule in the earthe, but onely that she shoulde haue hir sanctification, and bee made worthy of his kingdome.
From whe~ce then commeth agayne to vs the round Dragon, that wrappeth him self on a heape? fro whe~ce are these Councels renewed for any cause? Let Mary be had in honor: let be worshipped the father, the sonne, and the holy ghost let no man worship Mary.
This mysterie is due to God, the Angels receiue not suche glorifying.
Let the thinges euill written, he rased cleane oute of the hearte of those that are deceyued, let the luste of the tree be taken out of their eyes, let it tourne to the Lorde that framed it, let Eue vvith Adam feare God, that shee maye vvorshippe him onely, least shee be ledde by the Serpentes voyce.
But let hir abyde stedfast in Gods commaundement, eate not of the tree.
Let no body eate of the errour that is for sainct Mary.
For thoughe the tree bee fayre, yet it is not to be eaten: althoughe Mary bee moste fayre, and holy, and honorable, yet is she not to be adored.
But these Arabicke women worshipping Mary, do renue again the mixture to Fortune, and prepare a table to the Diuell, not to God, as it is written, they are fedde with the meat of wickednesse.
And agayne, And their women do boult flowre, and their children gather stickes to make cakes kneaded with oyle to the Q. of heaue~.
Let suche women be put to silence by Hieremie, and let them not trouble the worlde, let them not saye, wee honour the queene of heauen. &c.
Thus sayth Epiphanius, and muche more, neither for hir only, though chiefly for hir, but in generall for all the Saintes.
It is not mete to woorshippe the Sainctes beyonde comelynesse, but it is meete to honour the Lorde of them, let the errour therfore ceasse of those that be seduced.
Nowe if ye say vnto me, all this is spoken againste the worship of offring to hir, and sacrifising to hir, not for inuocation of hir: first this shift is false M. Sta. for Inuocation in déede is the chiefest worship that we can giue, not of the lips so much as of the heart, farre aboue any outwarde sacrifice of the bodie, and therefore to be muche more giuen to God alone, as S. Aug. reasoneth.
Sicut orantes. &c. Euen as, when wee praye and prayse, wee directe signifying vowes vnto God, when we offer the verie thinges in our heart, the whiche we signifie: so sacrifycing, we know that no visible sacrifice ought to be offred to any other than to him, to whom we our selues ought to be an inuisible sacrifice.
As therfore no bodily sacrifice may be directed to any but to God, so knew Epiphanius, that all spirituall sacrifice is onely due to God.
And therefore he so little ascribeth it to hir, or any other, that bothe in the beginning of his treaiise, and in the ende, he maketh his inuocations onely to God.
But let vs now clearely speake of the heresie it selfe, and inuocating God, as we will adioyne confutation agaynst it. &c.
Let vs proceede to that onely heresie, which is yet vntouched, inuocating God that he would helpe vs. &c.
Thus ye sée to whome he ascribeth inuocation, not to hir of whom he writeth, or to any other saincte, but alonely to God.
This shifte fayleth therefore, in saying he writeth onely agaynst offring and sacrificing to hir.
But setting all this aside, haue not you, beséeche you, offred and sacrificed to hir? pray you turne back agayne to those your prayers, whiche haue cited, that playnely confesse the facts, and glorie therein.
Neither coulde they tell, by what meanes they shoulde worshippe hir inoughe.
But if it yrke ye to turne to that, whiche was so yrkesome to reade before: will shwe you, yet once more, so playne a testimonie, that all the shiftes of Proteus can not turne it away.
Iacobus de Uoragine sayth: Secundo est regina coeli. &c. Secondly, she is the Queene of heauen.
Let vs sacrifice to the queene of heauen, and let vs powre out drinke offrings to hir, and let vs make cakes, as we and our fathers haue done, and were filled with bread, and it was well with vs, and we sawe no euill: but since that time that we haue ceassed to sacrifice to hir, we wante all things, we are consumed with famine and sworde.
But as it is sayde in the ecclesiasticall stories, there was a threefolde distinction of the thinges that were offred to God, for either they were an offering of beastes, and that was called sacrifice: or it was of a dry thing, as of flowre, bread, or suche like, and that was called oblation: or else it was of moyst things, that is to wit, of wine, or oyle, and that was called drinke offeringes.
First, the sacrifice, when it is sayde, let vs sacrifice: the drinke offering, when it is sayde, let vs poure out drinke offeringes: the oblation, when it followeth, let vs make cakes.
But to the queene of heauen we ought to sacrifice oure bodies, by the mortifying of vices: to poure out our moyst hartes, by the compassion of teares: and to exhibite cakes, that is, quiet consciences, by our inwarde purification.
What greater sacrifice can be giuen than this, M. Stap. euen to God? can we do any more to him, than as the Apostle exhorteth vs. Obsecro vos. &c.
beseeche you brethren by the mercies of God, that ye giue vp your bodies a liuing sacrifice: holy and acceptable to God, which is your reasonable worshippe of him? And haue not you vnreasonably héere giuen all this worshippe to hir? This passeth, M. Stapl. the saying of a Masse, and yet ye haue diuers Masses of hir also, euen as well as ye had of the Trinitie, or of the Holy Ghost, wherof ye haue heard some of the Sequences.
But to sée this testimonie, (I omit here how iumpe ye play those Idolaters partes, measuring religion by the belly, and tell vs what trouble and scarcitie hathe bene since massing was lefte, and what a plentifull worlde it was, when the Masse was vp) note it chiefly, to shewe, both how wickedly and howe fondely ye alleage their sacrificing for the proofe of yours, which is bothe condemned flatly of God by the Prophet Hieremie, for he alleageth it not, that we should followe it, or confirme ought vpon it, but abhorre it: and also Epiphanius crieth out vpon it, and vpon them that made an argument therfrom, to defende their doings, and calleth them wicked, and yet do you (as did they) fette argumentes from thence, to confirme your worshippe of hir, and both of you, making hir Quéene of heaue~.
But besides this worship of sacrifice, as Epiphanius sayth also, she is not Queene of heauen, so he sayth, God would not haue hir rule in the earth neither.
And you quite contrary, call hir ruler, lady, Quéene, Empresse therof.
And so it followeth euen in ye next words of the author cited, Tertiò, est Domina mundi. &c. Thirdly, she is the Queene of the world, and therefore all other mediators set aside, it shal be lawfull to appeale to hir, as to the Lady and Empresse, if any man be greeued of the diuell, or of a tyrant, or of the flesh, or of the iustice of God.
And thus ye are flat agaynst Epiphanius, his saying béeing as directly agaynst you, as agaynst those in his time.
Which proueth you (all your shifts notwithstanding) to be starke heretikes your selues in inuocation, that obiect heresie in inuocation to vs. Yea, whether you be more blasphemous heretikes, than euer they were, or no, let the reader iudge.
But fro~ what iudgement will not you appeale, that will appeale, euen fro~ the iust iudgement of God him selfe, to the virgin Mary? can not read, that thse heretikes in Epiphanius time, durst euer attribute halfe so muche vnto hir. Clere your selues, M. S. of these heretical blasphemo{us} inuocatio~s, the~ proue vs heretikes for denying the same.
Nowe if your inuocation were grosse, much more were your abuses in Reliques, lights, and ceremonies.
In which the chiefest part of your religion did consist, as ye made the simple people beléeue.
First, to your blessed reliques answer, that christia~ religio~, nor ye worship of god, nor our beléefe, nor our saluatio~, nor remissio~ of our sins, nor any such vertue lieth in cloues, in sticks, in bones or stones.
Which if it did, as your Lege~ds tel how miraculously they wroght outward, how vertuously inward, to those yt honored the~ with crouching, knéeling, kissing· or bearing the~ about, and hurt the~ that co~te~ned the~, then would they do much harme now to those yt set not by the~.
We sée yet many of your blessed reliques exta~t, they neither do vs good nor harm.
They can neither blesse nor curse, nor they worke any miracles now.
If ye say we want faith, al consisted in the beléeuer, ye make a plain witcherie of the~, blasphemie to God.
But ye shew how ye abused those that beléeued you, making them beléeue the Moone was made of a gréene chéese, as they say: but were those blessed relikes so good as the chéese paring? Were they not such as euen Erasmus said: Yea, dothe this also pertayne to fayth, to kisse a rotten peece of leather, and filthy linnen rags, &c. Especially since it may be, that the shoe which they force vs to kisse, may not be S. Thomases, but some butchers, or some bawdes shoe.
Or (as Chaucers pardoner bewrayed them, euen at that time that they were in greatest price) the olde rotten bones of some Iewes shpe.
Frequenter audiuiè doctis, saythe Erasmus, haue often times herd say, of learned men, that went to Hierusalem, and probable it is, that the certayntie at this day is not knowne, where Hierusalem in the olde tyme dyd stande.
For euen see it doubted of the learned, whether Rome should haue bene there, or no, where it is nowe shewed to bee.
Sainct Hierome that lyued in that countrey, reckoning vp certayne things, which at this day are shewed there to straungers, sayth it is reported, and they say so.
VVhat shall we thinke nowe, after so many incursions, so many mutations of humaine matters, that in a thousand yeres and more are wont to chaunce, of which sort, Veronica, the piller of Salomon, the chaire of Peter, and his sepulchre, which are shewed at Rome, are sayde to be? Shal we now beléeue your Lege~d, better than Erasmus: but that also is so vncertayne, that ye can not tell whether ye haue many of the saincts right bodies, or no: so by your own false doctrine, ye can not tell whether ye commit Idolatrie, or no.
One of your Churches sayth: We haue such a saincts body scalp, arme, leg, or hucklebone.
That is not so, saith an other church, we haue it.
Nay, sayth the thirde, neither of ye both haue it, but we.
Héere the one partie or the other say not true, yet al work miracles after their miraculous maner.
But will ye know the truth, they were false harlots al, deceiued ye séely soules, that now (God be praysed) vndersta~d the knacks of S. Wenefrids néedle, the renewing of the bloud of Nayles, the filth of S. Fra~cis bréeches, &c.
They were so blessed, that as your great champion, frier Alfonsus sayth, where he defendeth them: your blessed cou~cell of Laterane vnder your blessep Pope Innocent the thirde, was fayne to make this prouiso for them, that is put in your decrées.
Cum ex eo. &c. Seeing that the Christian religion is defaced, and may be defaced in time to come, vpon this, that certayne do set out to sale the Saints Reliques, and euery where shew them foorth: we haue ordeined by this present decree, that fro~ hence foorth the olde Reliques shal in no case be shewed without a cause (that is to say, without a péece of money to sée them) nor shall be set foorth to sale, and that suche as shall be found out of newe, no man presume to worshippe them, till they shall be allowed by the authoritie of the Bishop of Rome that is to say, till they haue payed their fées to him, for before, they be so litle blessed, that they be not worshipfull) and as for Prelates, they shall not suffer those that come, for to worship at their Churches, to be deceyued by sundry feigned forgeries and false teachings, as for lucre sake it is accustomed to be done in most places.
This decréed your Pope and your Councell M. Stapl. against your blessed reliques.
Were not here your Pope and his whole Councell heretikes also? you were best to say so.
For this saying proueth your Prelates, Priests, Pardoners, to haue bene false teachers, and deceyuers of the people for Lucre: and the people hauing bene deceyued by them, to haue committed Idolatrie: and the Reliques, that we were borne in hand were blessed things, as ye call them, to haue bene faigned forgeries and false teachings: not in one place, or in some places, but in most places, that is, all ouer your Churche: and that not once or twise, by a scape: but of custome, which how long time it prescribeth, search you.
This was the generall state of your vniuersall Church (for vniuersall comprehendeth the most parte) concerning your blessed reliques, euen by the Popes owne definitiue sentence, and all his councell, which, oft times you boast, can not erre.
But though the Pope co~fesse thus much, as could not for shame denie so manifest a matter: yet he knew what he did wel inough, when he made this statute.
For what losses so euer other poore Priests and Pardoners should féele, he made sure for him selfe to get thereby, not so much by retayning the old reliques in estimation, that then, as stale and common, began to decaie: as to relieue the Churches hutch (whereof he saith he is the coaferer) by authorising newe blessed reliques.
But though he gayned much by this deuice, yet much water goeth by the mill, that the miller knoweth not of.
And many miriades of blessed reliques more more encreased, and neuer fette the Popes blessing from Rome, for their warrant, so blessedly they multiplied, but had this Popes decrie bene plainly ment, or truly kept: bothe old and new, and all your blessed reliques, had bene banished from all blessednesse and worship, long agoe: as nothing but lies and forgeries, inuented to enrich your selues, with the spoyle of the peoples Idolatrie.
graunt, ye haue some antiquitie to pretende for Reliques, not onely of S. Hieromes time, but somewhat before also: that with greate reuerence conserued the bodies of the glorious Martyrs.
But trowe you, they worshipped, knéeled, crept, and offred to them? and yet some might, yea some did ouershoote themselues herein euen then.
But did the learned Fathers allow it? Doth not euen S. Hierom (of whome Alphonsus saithe, Qui duriu pugnare solet, that was wonte to fight more harde and bitterly) say to Uigilantius, Quis enim insanum caput aliquando martyres adorauit: For who, thou frantike head, hath at any time worshipped the Martyres? He telleth how they translated them honorably, as noble martyres, but they worshipped them not.
And where other began to attribute an opinion of vertue to their vestiments, Chrysestome (if the worke be his) greatly blameth them.
Other there be (saith he) that would shew them selues to men, to be more holy: and tie and hang about them a parte of their hem or heares.
wickednesse, they would shew a greater holinesse in their garme~ts, than in the body of Christ.
He which is not healed feeding on his bodie, would be saued by the holinesse of his garment.
In so much that he trusteth in the vestiment of man, which despayreth in Gods mercie.
Yea? what did Paule? did not he giue his napkins, that the sicke might be helped? yes, before those men had the knowlege of God: and the reason was, that by those mens health, the power of God, might be knowne.
For, after we haue knowne the power of God, whereto is it necessarie that we should know the power of man? No (saith he) as shewed before: Neattenda cinerem, &c. Regarde not the asshes of the saincts bodies, nor the Imbers of the Reliques of the flesh, and all their boanes that in time are consumed.
Yea your owne feigned Epistle in the name of Clement saith, Nothing is more wicked and vnthankefull, than to receyue a benefite of God, and to giue thankes to stockes and stones.
S. Augustine telleth of Hypocrites in his dayes, that caried about with them Reliques for sale.
Other fell the members and bones of Martyrs, if yet they be Martyrs: other extoll their hems and gardes, &c.
Thus there is some antiquitie to be pretended for Reliques, and that they were worshipped also, but not of the godly and learned Fathers: but of wicked and supersticious hypocrites.
Against whome, they cried out, but what would they haue saide, had they séene the playne Idolatrie to your forged Reliques.
Of the which euen the defenders of them haue cried out, and co~fessed their abhominations.
For, besides your Pope, your Councell of Coleyn euen in defending them, saith: Hi tamen, &c. Notwithstanding here (which we can not denie) the gouernours of the Churche did after a meruailous fashion sleepe out the matter.
But in our age (and that through the slouth of the parishe Priestes, we can not denie it but that we erred.
And againe, Expositae sunt passim, &c. Reliques are euery where set forth for gaine, and those vncertayne Reliques, and perhaps herevppon occasion was giuen, not to a fewe being yet but elie Christians, of putting confidence rather in Sainctes bones, than in the liuing God, which ought not to haue bene done.
And thus do your own Pope, Councels and writers condemne your selues, for the horrible abuses of these your blessed Reliques, and therefore we may worthely reiect them.
To your Lightes answere, true it is the Churche in the time of S. Hierome, lo~g before, vsed Lights.
But as he witnesseth himself, they vsed the~ for their necessitie in their Morning and Euening prayers: which first sprang of this, that the Churche in time of persecution, assembled as they might closely in caues, in cellars, and other priuy places, comming togither very early in the morning, and very late in the euening, yea in the dead of the night, to inuocate God, to heare his worde, and participate the Lords supper, so that lights were necessarie for them.
After the time of persecution, kéeping still those howres of prayer, they likewise serued for their vse, till by litle litle, as other things, they also began eue~ about S. Hieromes time, to be abused.
And not long after about Gregories time, to be kept light euen in the broade day, and to be set in golde~ candlestickes, which the former fathers counted and called heathen customes.
For the Heathen vsed lampes burning day night, and tapers before their Idols on their aulters, besides their torche lights euen as the Papists vsed.
But you wil say, not they onely vsed lights, but God also ordeyned lightes to be vsed in the Temple.
Indéede if ye could proue vs to be bounde to the ceremonies of the olde lawe, or that Christ had renewed them, and not rather abrogated them, nor ordayned any other like them in their places: then should ye say something to the matter.
But what néede ye labour to reduce the lawe, since ye are not ashamed to confesse it came from the Heathen vsage.
Polygrane confesseth and braggeth of it, that all your candles on Candlemasse day came from the wicked and old superstition of the Ethnikes.
For the historiographers tell, that the heathen Romaines had a custome, that alwaies at the fift yeare in the moneth of February, they kept the feast of going about the clensing, with torches and lightes in the honour of Februa the mother of Mars, whom they tooke for the God of battayle.
And also in the same moneth, the Romaine women with the like worship of candels, kept the memorie of Proserpina: whome (being rauished of Pluto the God of hell) they feigne that hir mother Ceres sought hir eue~ to mount Aetna.
VVhich superstition was first of the Grecians, bicause of a most grieuous pestilence in the yeare of health.
But afterwarde of Sergius Byshop of Rome (who first chaunged his name, for the deformitie thereof, being called Os Porci, Swines face, or Hogges snout) it was turned into a common religion, as also the feast of all the Gods, was dedicate to all Saints.
that the Christian people should make memorials, not so much of Februa, and Proserpine, as of Christ and Marie.
Iacobus de Uoragine agréeth somwhat herewith, though herein he agrée little to himself, and least of all to the truth, besides his impudent Idolatrie to the Uirgine Marie, quite forgetting Christ, and ascribing all the honour of your candels vnto hir.
Quod Simeon lumen Christum vocauit, ideo consuetudo inoleuit in Ecclesia, vt hodie lumina deferamus.
Bicause Simeon called Christ a light, therefore grewe the custome of the Church, that on this day we carie lightes.
For euen as this day Marie, Ioseph, Simeon and Anna did after the order of Procession, carie a light in the Church: so do we after the order of Procession, carie Candles light vnto the Church.
As this is a most euident and grosse lie, for neyther then, nor long after, they knewe what Procession mnt: nor caried any light in the Temple, which had bene quite beyond Gods commaundement: nor any such doing is in the scripture, but onely that this blinde authour followed to much the pictures in the Primer, or the Masse booke, that painte out the midwife, or Ioseph holding a Taper: so it neyther agréeth with the other common opinion, nor yet with himselfe.
But we must note (saith he) that there is a triple reason of this obseruance aud custome, the one a literall, the other a spirituall, the thirde a morall.
The literall reason this, for bicause the Romaynes in the olde time did celebrate three feastes with lightes, the First in the honour of Proserpina, the Seconde in the honour of Februa, the Third in the honor of all the Court of hell· &c. to appease them and induce them to mercie, that they would more mildely punishe the soules of their friendes departed.
But bicause it is a hard matter to forsake things accustomed, the Romaynes after they receyued the sayth of Christ, did yet also kepe these feasts of lightes in Februarie.
Pope Gregorie therefore did chaunge this feast into the honour of the mother of light.
That in hir honour we should beare lightes, that bare vnto vs the true light.
Nor that now it shoulde bee made to Februa the mother of the God of battell: but to the honour of the mother of the GOD of peace.
That it should not nowe be to the honour of the court of Deuils, but to the honour of the Queene of all Angels, and worthily was this translation made.
The Romaynes did therefore honour Proserpina, that so she might obtaine grace of hir husbande.
They honored the Deuils that punished the soules, to encline them to mercie.
But these three things we receyue of the mother of God, that is to wit, grace, mercie, and victorie.
And therefore the Church singeth, Marie mother of grace, mother of mercie.
For shee gyueth grace to the lyuing, and therefore is called the mother of grace.
And to the deade obteyneth mercie, and therefore it followeth, mother of mercie.
And to the vniuersall Church shee obteyneth victorie of their enimyes, and therefore it followeth, defende thou vs from the enimie. &c.
Thus sayeth Iacobus de Uoragine of the originall of your feast of lightes.
That it was but a chaungeling of the Infidels, hatched of your Pope, on this grounde, that it was harde to forsake an olde Heathen custome.
But thinking to chaunge these lightes to the better, haue yée not blasphemed God, euen by his Saints, as yll or worse, than they did by theyr Idols.
Your Legende disagréeth from thys latter deuise of Proserpina. &c.
And sayeth, This feast is called Candlemasse, and is made in remembraunce of the offering that oure Ladie offered in the Temple as sayde is.
And eueryeche beareth this day a Candle of VVaxe, vvhiche representeth oure Lorde Iesu Christ.
And yet in effecte no better, for as this mysterie was not vnderstoode, so was it not regarded.
And therefore your Legend telleth vs a full worthie storie, that euen in hir honour of hir lights, Christ himselfe sang Masse to his mother.
VVee reade an ensample (sayth your Legende) of a noble Ladie, vvhiche had a great deuotion in the blessed Virgin Marie, and shee had a Chappell in the vvhiche, shee did do say Masse of our Ladie dayly by hir Chaplaine.
It happened that the day of the Purification of our Ladie, hir Chaplaine vvas out, so that the Ladie might that daye haue no Masse, and she durst not go to another Church, bicause shee had giuen hir mantell to a poore man for the loue of our Ladie.
She vvas much sorovvfull bicause shee might not heare Masse.
And for to make hir deuotio~, she went into the Chappell, and tofore the aultar she kneeled dovvne for to make hir prayers to our Ladie, and anon shee fel a slepe.
In vvhich, shee had a vision, and hir seemed that she vvas in a Church, and savve come into the Churche a great companie of Virgins, tofore vvhom shee favve come a right noble Virgin crowned right preciously, and when they were all set eche in order, came a companie of yong men, which sat dovvne eche after other in order like the other: after entred one that bare a burthen of Candles, and departed them to them aboue first, and so to ech of them by order he gaue one, and at last came this man to this Ladie aforesayd, and gaue to hir also a Candle of vvax.
The vvich Ladie savv also come a Priest, a Deacon and a Subdeacon, all reuested going to the aultar, as for to say Masse.
And hir seemed that S. Laurence, and S. Vincent vvere Deacon and Subdeacon Iesu Christ the Priest, and two angels bearing tofore them Candles: and two yong angels began the introit the Masse: and all the co~panie of the virgins soong the Masse.
And when the Masse was soong vnto the offring, hir semed that thick virgin so crowned, went tofore, and after, all the other followed, and offered to the Priest (kneeling much deuoutly) their Candles.
And when the Priest taried for this Ladie, that shee shoulde also haue commen to the offring: the glorious Queene of Virgins sent to hir, to say that she was not curteous to make the Priest so long to arie for hir.
And the Ladie answered, that the Priest should proceede in his Masse forth, for she would keepe hir Candle and not offer it.
The thirde time, the Queene sayde to the Messenger, go and pray hir that shee come and offer hir Candle, or else take it from hir by force.
The Messenger came to this Ladie, and bicause in no wise shee woulde not come and offer vp hir Candle, he set hande on the Candle that the Ladie helde, drew fast.
And so long he drewe and haled, that the Candle brake in two peeces, and the one halfe abode still in the hand of the Ladie aforesayde, which anon awooke and came to hir selfe, and found the peece of the Candle in hir hande, whereof she much marueyled, and thanked our Lorde and the glorious Virgin Marie deuoutly, which had suffered hir that day not to be without Masse.
And all the dayes of hir life after, shee kept that peece of that Candle muche preciously like an holy relique.
And all they that were touched therwith, were guarished and healed of their maladies and sicknesse.
Thus worde for worde, sayth your golden Legende, in the honour of your Candles.
And is not here a golden· péece of worke, for a waxen péece of Candle? Here is, loe, one of your blessed Reliques that before ye spake of, but it was gotten with hard hold, hale and pull, not all they coulde get it out of hir fingers, neither the Aungel coulde pull it away, nor our Ladie was obeyed any whitte, yea Christ the poore Masse Priest was caused to tarie, and coulde not go foorth with his Masse.
If this then be true, as it must needes be, being written in so holy a golden Legende, (where forsth is no lie) neyther was it a dreame, for the Candles end was in hir hande, to make mencion of hir holde fast: Is not this a foyle to Christ, to his mother, and all the Saints in heauen, that a Candles ende was thus wroong from them all? Well howsoeuer that was, will ye say, this sheweth a further originall of Candles: euen Christ, his Aungels, and Saints in heauen, do vse them at their Masses.
But if they haue no Masses in heauen, and if they haue no Candles in heauen, then leauing these childish and impudent lyes for very shame, of Candles originall: ye were best to stande to the former deuising of them, from the heathen custome, and returne to your Popes chaunge at Rome.
Now after these Romishe Pagan customes aforesayde, were taken vp in Christendome, they began in Spain, and after in other Countreys, to fall after a coniuring maner to hallow Pascall light with exorcismes.
But vppon what simple reasons, Alphonsus declareth in the defence thereof.
Concerning the halowing of lights· will onely birng (saith he) the decree of the fourth Toletane Cou~cell.
At certaine Churches a Candle and a Taper, are not hallowed at their Vigils, and they enquire of vs why we hallow them? VVe hallow them solemnly that we may receyue the glorious mysterie (that came at the time of this auowed night) by the blessing of the hallowed Candle.
And bicause this obseruation is commended in many Countreyes, and Kingdomes of Spaine, it is fit that for the vnitie of peace, it should also be kept in the French Churches.
Neither shall any escape vnpunished, but be vnder the fathers rules, that contemneth this.
Thus we sée the originall and créeping vp of your lights to depende on men.
Wherevppon, though Alphonsus crie out most bitterly, calling vs coniurers and enchauners of the people from the truth of the fayth, bicause we set not by them, but call such superstitious maner of halowing lights, to be the verie coniuring in déede, as euen their names of exorcismes doth import: yet is he faine to confesse, that Talis ceres benedictionem omiere, no~ sit contra fidem: The omitting the hallowing of suche a Taper is not agaynst the fayth.
And if it be not agaynst the fayth to omitte them, then are not we Heretikes for omitting them, especially in so iust considerations, of so great supersition and horrible abuses, as of late time more and more they haue growne vnto, being at their best, but constitutions of men, and growne at the length to a very plaine coniuring, that an holy Candle coulde driue away lightning, and tempests, yea the Deuill and all it coulde: that such mysteryes, suche vertue, such confidence, suche seruice of God, such forgiuenesse of sinnes, consisted in burning a Candle, in setting vp a Lampe, in offering a Taper, in mainteyning a light before an Image, or bearing it in Procession.
Do ye not say in your hallowing of them at Masse? Benedic Domine Iesu Christe hanc creaturam. &c. Blesse Lord Iesu Christ this creature of wax Candle, at our supplication, and powre into it an heauenly blessing, by the vertue of the holy Crosse, that thou which hast giuen it to mans vse to repell darkenesse, it may receyue by the signe of thy holy Crosse, suche strength and blessing, that in whatsoeuer places being lighted it bee put, the Deuill may depart thence, and tremble and flie awaye pale, with all his ministers, oute of those houses, nor presume to disquiet them any more.
That these Candles prepared to the vse of men, and to the health of their bodies their soules, either on land or water, by the inuocatio~ of thy holy name, by intercession of S. Mary alway virgin whose feasts are this day deuoutly celebrated &c.
And in the thirde praier, that thou vouchsafe to blesse, hallow and kindle them· with the light of the heauenly blessing: that we by offering them to our God, may deserue to be kindled with the holy fyre of thy most swete brightnesse, and to be presented in the holy temple of thy glorie.
All these vertues and many more ye ascribe to your Candles.
Neither do ye (as here ye pretend) offer them vp onely to God, but to the Saints also, chiefly to the Uirgin Marie, which as it was so common, that it cannot be denied: so to co~firme the same, your Legend telleth vs a tale of one, that neuer did good déed in his life, but that he offred a Taper to the virgin Mary.
And whe~ he died he was of Christ co~demned, the deuils had alreadie gotte~ his soule.
Then came the virgin Mary, put the Taper in his hande, had him shift with the deuils so well as he could, the soule hauing gotten the Taper, stood therwith at his defence, euer whe~ the deuils came nere him, he oyned one in the face, hit another here, another there, so lustily he laid about him, yt he droue with the Taper all ye deuils away.
So notable a force ye ascribed to a Candle offred to the blessed virgin, and made the simple people beleue what ye would, by these outward Ca~dles, in the darke night mist of error: hauing put out, and hidden vnder a bushel, the true holy Candle, the light of our féete, lanterne to our steps, the blessed worde of God, that shoulde haue shewed Christ vnto vs, the verye light of the world, that came to giue light to those that sit in darknesse in the shadow of death.
Which spirituall light of Christ, and the glorious beames of his Gospell, the dimme eies of your soule cannot abide to looke vpo~. Qui male agit odit luce~. &c.
He that doth yll (saith Christ, our true light) hateth the light, co~meth not to the light, least his works shuld be reproued.
Syth therfore, euen as the Owle flieth the light, you slie the word of god: all these other lights are but mere vnfruitfull workes of darknesse, lulling the people a sleepe with these your dreaming fables.
Yet these fables were let forth in the mother tong, yt euery man might vndersta~d them, but in no case, the true ca~dle might shine vnto them.
In stéed whereof ye set vp a Candle before the deuil.
For the godly christians are not taught by Christ, his Apostles, nor the learned auncient fathers, to set vp any suche Candles before Christ, which Lactantius calleth plaine madnesse.
Candles in the Church so well as in other places we allowe and vse, as did Saint Hierome.
And therfore, where ye obiect Uigilantius to vs, we returne euen Hieromes wordes to you.
But we light not waxe Candles at broade day light, as thou slaunderest vs in vaine: but with this comfort, to mitigate the nightes darkenesse, to keepe vs awake at the light, least we should sleepe in darkenesse, beeing blinde with thee.
And thus Saint Hierome maketh euen you master Stapleton, and your Church, that haue them in the cleare day light, and that to such blind and Idolatrous endes: both Uigilantians and Dormantians to.
Nowe to Ceremonies: answere, that such as be decent, laudable, and to edifying, and may set forth Gods glorie, we refuse them not.
We reiect (I graunt) and that in good considerations, the rable of such heathen and Iewish ceremonies, that you laded the spouse of Christ withall.
We are frée from the yoke of the lawe, much lesse néede we tye vs to the bondage of Paganisme.
And fro~ one of these, the most of your ceremonies were deriued.
Saint Augustine complayned in his time (and he liued euen in the time of Uigilantius) That they oppressed the Church, which God had set free, with such slauish burdens, that the state of the Iewes was more tollerable, who though they knewe not the time of their libertie; yet were they but vnder the burthens of the lawe, aud not vnder the presumptions of men.
Thus speaketh Saint Augustine of Ceremonies, euen where he mitigateth the matter, and beareth with them so much as he coulde.
But what woulde he haue thought and sayde, had he séene such an infinite number, as haue crept in since his tune, obtruded with such seueritie vrged with such necessitie, estéemed with such opinion of holinesse, as nothing more: yea preferred before the knowledge and expresse commaundements of God, beeing nothing but the traditions and inuentions of men? If ye obiect Uigilantius to vs as an Heretike, for improuing such ceremonies, and the abuses of them: why call ye not Christ M. St. a starke Heretike also? for he obiected euen the same matter to the Scribes, Pharisies High Priects, that they worshipped God with the traditions of men, and therefore saith, vanum olunt me.
They woorship me in vaine: he charged them that they ouer burdened ye people with such loade of Ceremonies, whereas his yoke was light and easie, and reproued them, that for those their ceremonies, they neglected and transgressed the commandements of God.
warrant ye, they said, as you say by vs, that he was a ranke Heretike, and accursed, and excommunicated him, and all that helde with him.
And do you speake any better (of his Ministers meane not) but euen of his worde it selfe, in respect of your ceremonies than did they? omitte as now to tell how ye haue defaced his worde, how many things ye preferre aboue it, onely will note this, how sawcely in the defence of your ceremonies and your other errours, contrary to the Scripture, ye exalte your selues aboue Gods worde.
Pigghius (who might for his writing be called Hogghius wel inough) one of your chiefest porkelings, in his defence of the inuocatio~ of Saincts, against the worde of God: He groyneth out this saying: Ego certè maiore ratione, &c. Truly will with greater reason denie thee, the authoritie of all the Scriptures than that thou shalt call me into doubte, the beliefe and authoritie of the catholike Church, since that vnto me the Scriptures haue no authoritie, but all onely of the Churche.
What a wicked and swynish saying is this, of a proude Popish borepigge, against the euerlasting worde of God, that it hath no authoritie at all from God the author of it, but all from man, all from the Churche of Rome, for that is the Catholike Church that he meaneth, the Pope, his College of Cardinals, and his assemblies of Priests, for this they call the oecumenicall and representatiue Church.
All the authoritie that the worde of God hath, it hath it from them alone.
Which if it were true, then indéede, as he saithe, by better reason he may denie all the Scriptures, than so much as call into doubt the beléefe and authoritie of the popish Bishops and Priests.
Why may they not then adde too, and take from, and make what and as many Ceremonies as they please, and good reason to? But since it is no reason that the worde of God should be thus trod vnder the foote of man: that Gods worde should giue place to mans worde: that Gods worde should haue all his authoritie of the worde of Priests, and none at all of God: that the Wiues worde should controll, checke mate, and chks vp hir husbandes worde: that the wife may speake and appointe as much as she thinkes good, and the husbande which hath but a few wordes to say, can not be heard: that the wiues worde should beare the streake, and giue authoritie to the husbandes worde, according to the common saying, As the good man saith so say we, but as the goodwife saith so it must be: if this be no good reason, nor any reason, but cleane against all reason: then may we replie to Pigghius and you M. St. that with better reason· all your Churches authoritie and beleefe, ought net onely to be called in doubte· whether it agrée to Gods worde or no, but also ought to depend wholy and onely on the authoritie of Gods worde.
And rather than the authoritie of the worde of God should be called into doubte, much lesse denied, as wickedly he presumeth to speake, it were much better reason that he were cast into the sea, as Christ saith, and in sléede of a milstone, that all his ceremonies were hanged aboute his necke, all such blasphemous swine, as this Pigghius, were caried hedlo~g into the sea with him Yea saith Christ, Heauen and earth shall passe, but my worde shall not passe.
If your Catholike Church M. St. were the true wife and spouse of the Sonne of God, she would with all lowlinesse, humilitie reuerence, here regarde obey Christ hir husbandes worde.
And be content to be commaunded by it, not to countermaunde it, not to thinke it were not of force, vnlesse she gaue authoritie thereunto, not to adde or diminishe to or from it, not to commaunde one thing when he commaundes another, not to compell the children and houshold of the faith to obserue hir worde more than hir husbandes, not to haue twentie commaundements for hir husbandes tenne, not to vse other fashions and customes than hir husband bids hir, yea such as he forbids hir, not to haue all the wordes and hir husbande not one worde, yea to shut vp his mouthe and not to heare his worde: these are impudent whores and bolde strumpets fashions, a godly Christian matrone, a vertuouse and faithfull spouse, would neuer do thus.
But since your Church doth thus, call hir catholike so fast as ye lust, she is nothing else but a common catholike queane, and not the humble and faithfull spouse of Christ.
And your selues that defende hir, haue good reason indéede to defende your Mother: but such Mother such children, that to holde with their mother dispise their Father, and make hir worde to giue authoritie to his, and say that with better reason they may denie the authoritie of their Fathers worde, than so much as make a doubte of the beleefe and authoritie of their mother.
Yea that is a good ladde warrant him and a well taught childe, that will helpe the Mother to beate the Father, is he not worthie his Mothers blessing for his labour? but suche bastarde rebelles shalbe sure of the Fathers curse.
For indéede they are not his Children: Ues ex patre vestro Diabolo estis.
Qui ex Deo est verba Dei audit, propterea vos non auditis quia ex Deo non estis.
He that is of God heareth the worde of God, therefore you heare it not, bicause yeare not of God.
The true children of God aboue all, other thinges, yea more than Father, mother, wife, children, fréendes, yea than their owne life, loue God, and the hearing of his woorde.
Thus do all the shéepe of Christ, meae vcem meam audiunt.
My sheepe heare my voice: As the Father hath bidden them, Hunc audite, &c.
This is my welbeloued Sonne, in whom am delighted, heare him, that is to say, Leuell all your faith and life by the onely authoritie of his worde: Who onely knoweth the Fathers will, and in whom all the treasures of his fathers glorie are couched: Who is the wisedome of God, the truth, the way, the life, and the worde it selfe.
The Sonne which is in the fathers bosome, he hath declared it.
Auditus autem per verbum Dei, But hearing commeth (not by the Mothers authoritie) but by the worde of God.
Thus did the godly children vnto God, whome we call Fathers vnto vs, both before, in Uigilantius time.
Let vs follow none, (saith Origen) and if we will follow any, Iesus Christ is set forth vnto vs to follow, the Actes of the Apostles are described, and we acknowledge the doyngs of the Prophets out of the holy volumes, that is the firme example, that is the ounde purpose, which who so desireth to follow, goeth safe.
Thus also saith Cyprian, both for Gods worde, for your Mothers ceremonies: The Heretike saith let nothing be deuised of newe, besides that which is by tradition deliuered.
From whence came this tradition? came it from the authoritie of the Lorde, and of his Gospell, or came it from the commandements of the Apostles, and their Epistles? for indeede that those things which are written ought to be done, God witnesseth, and setteth forth to Iesus of Nauee, saying, let not the booke of this law departe out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou obserue all things that are written.
Likewise the Lorde sending his Apostles, commandeth that the nations be baptized, and taught to obserue all those things that he commaunded.
If therefore it be commaunded in the Gospell, or in the Apostles Epistles, or be contayned in the Acts. &c.
VVhat an obstinacie is this, or what a presumption, to preferre an humane tradition before Gods ordinance.
Nor to consider, that God taketh indignation and wrath, so often as an humaine tradition looseth, goeth beyonde the commaundements of God, as he cryeth by his Prophet Esay, and sayth, this people honoreth me with their lippes, but their hart is separate fro~ me: they worship me in vayne, whyle they teache the co~maundements and doctrines of men.
The Lorde also in the Gospell, blaming likewise, and reprouing, putteth foorth and sayth, ye haue reiected Gods commaundement, to establishe your tradition.
Of whiche commaundement S. Paule beeing mindefull, dothe likewise warne and instructe, aying: if anye teache otherwise, and contenteth not him selfe with the wordes of our Lorde Iesus Christ, and his doctrine· he is pufte vp with blockishnesse, hauing skill of nothing.
From suche an one we ought for to departe. &c.
And in the same Epistle he sayth further: But if so be, moste deare brother, the feare of God be before vs, if the tenor of fayth preuayle, if we keepe Christes co~maundements, if we maynteyne the holynesse of his espouse incorrupte and inuiolate: if these wordes of the Lorde sticke faste in oure vnderstanding, and in oure hartes whiche he sayde: thinke ye that when the sonne of man shall come, he shall finde fayth in the earthe? Bicause then, we bee the faythfull souldiours of God, bicause we wage vnder him, with faythe and sincere religion, let vs with a faythfull manhoode keepe hys campe committed to vs of God.
Nor the custome that crepte in among some, oughte to hinder vs, that the truthe mighte the lesse preuayle and vanquishe.
Knowing that the truthe saythe, as it is written in Esdras: The truth florisheth and preuayleth for euer. &c.
If we returne to the head and originall of Gods tradition, mans errour ceaseth.
And beholde the reason of the heauenly sacraments, what obscuritie soeuer lurked vnder the miste and cloude of darknesse, it is opened with the light of the truthe.
If a conduite of water, whiche before dyd slowe plentyfully and largely, do sodaynely fayle: do we not go to the spring, there to knowe the reason why it fayleth? whether by the encreasing of the vaynes it be dryed in the head: or else flowing from thence whole and full, it stoppe in the middle course.
And if it come to passe, by reason the pype is broke: or if it soke vp the water, whereby the streame can not still keepe on his course continually: the pype beeing repayred and amended, the water is fette agayne as plentyfully, and as holesomely, as it springeth from the fountayne.
VVhich thing now also the Priestes of God ought to doe, keeping the commaundements of God.
That if so bee the truth stagger, and wauer in any poynt, let vs then returne backe to the Lords, and his Gospels original, and the Apostles tradition.
And from whence bothe the order and originall arose, from thence let the reason of our doing arise.
Marke this generall rule of S. Cyprian, M. Sta. and pray you set all your ceremonies vnto it, and ye shall tell me another tale, and say with Hilarie, they are well taken away.
Omnem plantationem, &c. Euery plant which is not of my fathers setting, is to be pulled vp, that is to say, the tradition of man is to be rooted out, by the loue whereof, they transgressed the commaundementes of the Lawe.
And therefore are they blynde leaders of the blynde, promising the waye of eternall lyfe, which them selues can not see, and so beeing blinde them selues, and guides of the blynde, they tumble into the ditche togither.
Suche Pharisies are you, M. St. with your blynde ceremonies, and suche Chrisostome (if the worke be hys) calleth you and all other, that sande so muche on ceremonies.
They enlarge their owne sayinges by the obseruations of dayes, as thoughe it were euen the Phariseis broade gardes, and in their preaching they shewe them continually to the people, as thoughe they were the full keeping of the Lawe, and the getting of their saluation.
Suche were they of whome Christe sayde, they worship me in vayne, teaching the doctrines and commaundementes of men.
The large hemmes of their garmentes, he calleth the magnificall extolling of their commandements.
For when they prayse those trifing and superstitious obseruations of their owne righteousnesse, as though they were excellent, and very much pleasing God: then do they set out the hemmes of their garments.
If saye, it is to be doubted, whether this be Chrisostomes owne opinion of ceremonies, or no, in likenyng them to the Pharifeis hemmes: ye shall heare euen his owne opinion.
It appeareth heerevpon, that many thinges were of newe broughte in by the priestes, and althoughe Moyses wyth a greate terrour hadde threatned them, that they shoulde neither adde too, nor take awaye anything, ye shall not, saythe hee, adde any thyng to the worde that speake to you thys daye, nor take therefrom: yet for all thys had they brought in very many new thinges, suche as were those, not to eate meate with vnwashed handes, to rince their cuppes and brasen vessell, and to washe themselues.
And whereas they oughte in processe of tyme to haue contemned suche obseruations, they tyed them selues to more and greater.
VVhich thing came to so gret wickednesse, that their precepts were more kept, than were the commaundements of God.
In so muche that now they seemed worthily to be reprehe~ded, that did neglect their obseruations.
In which doings, they committed a double fault, for bothe the bringing in it selfe of the newe thinges, was no small crime: and in that they sharpely punished the contemner of their obseruations, hauing no regarde of the commaundementes of God, they became thrall to greeuous offences.
So right in euery poynt thefe doings of the Phariseis, hit on the thumbes, and liuely portray out your popish Priestes doings.
M. St. that oppressed the church of Christ with the like, and superstitious ceremonies than euer the Phariseis did.
Nowe where they pretended, as you do, that they receiued these ceremonies of their auncestors: Although (sayth Chrisostome) he make no mention of their Elders, yet in accusing these, he so dasheth downe those, that he sheweth euen that to be a double fault, first in that they obeyed not God, then that they did them for bicause of men, as though he shoulde say, tell you euen this destroyeth you, bicause in euery thing ye will obey your elders: whiche is one of your greatest reasons (M. St.) for your ceremonies Here if ye say for all this proportion betwéene your doings and theirs, yet are not we so straightly bounde from the fathers traditions as they, bicause the Iewes otherwise had ynowe commaunded them, and verie fewe in the newe Testament are left to vs Christians: Chriso stome telleth you, that Christes Disciples ought to keepe the doctrine of God, not of men.
For otherwise, Christ blaming the Pharisers for kéeping the doctrine of men, if he had suffered his Disciples to kéepe any doctrine of men, they woulde haue replyed that wherein he reprehended them, hée himselfe was culpable.
If nowe the Disciples bée bounde to this rule, are not your Priestes also? Yea are not all Christians bound thereto, not to worship God with doctrines of men? As for the doctrine of Christ, to be euen as full, yea and much fuller than was theirs, for all it hath not your ceremonies.
For the Gospell conteyneth all things both present and to come, the honor of God, godlinesse, faith, yea al things are shutte vp togither in the worde of Preaching. &c.
For euen as the cryer proclaymeth to all that be at the assemblie, euen so (sayeth hée) doe wee publikely preache.
After this sorte, that we adde nothing, but preach onely those things, whiche wee haue hearde, for that is the vertue of the cryer, to prosecute all things truely that he is trusted with, not to put to, nor alter, nor take away anie thing.
Whiche is so haynous a faulte, that from hence as Saint Ambrose sayeth, the Deuill gat the first holde, when our first mother Eue did but a little alter in telling the wordes of God to the serpent.
Whervpon, we learne (sayth he) that we ought to ioyne nothing to the commaundement no not to make vs the more warie.
For if thou puttest too, or drawest away any thing, it appeareth to be a kinde of transgression of the commaundement.
And that the pure and simple forme of the commaundement is to be kepte: vve muste followe the fashion of witnesse bearing.
Commonly a witnesse, while he putteth too some thing of his owne de uising, to the manner of the deedes doing: he stayneth with a peece of a lie, the whole credite of the witnesse.
For heere at the first shewe what offence hath it, that the woman added, Nor ye shall touche any whitte of it? for God had not sayde, ye shall not touche, but ye shall not eate.
But for all that, heereon came the beginning of the fall.
For the wordes that shee added, eyther shee added them as superfluous, or adding them of hir owne, shee thought that the commandement of God was but halfe perfecte, (as you speake of Gods worde, and the infancie of Christes Churche, in the primitiue state therof, while it was yet without your additions.)
The treatise therfore of this present lecture teacheth vs, that we ought not to withdraw any thing from the commaundements of God, nor adde thereto.
For if Iohn gaue iudgement on this writing, If any, sayth he, shal adde to these things, God shall adde to him the plagues that are written in this booke, and if any man shall minishe of the wordes of this booke of this prophesie, God shall take away his parte out of the booke of life: howe muche more muste no man withdrawe from Gods commaundements.
This sayth S. Ambrose to all your vnwritten verities, and loades of ceremonies, all beyonde, and many agaynst the worde and commaundement of God.
Therefore may safely, for al doctrine, say with S. Aug. (if it be his sente~ce) VVhatsoeuer ye heere alleaged out of the scriptures, let that sauour well vnto you, whatsoeuer is besides the scripture, flye it, least ye wander in a cloude.
Lt vs not make (saythe he) religion of oure owne fantasies, for what truth soeuer it be, it is better than all that we can deuise after our will, who soeuer be the deuyser, howe wyse, howe holye, howe greate soeuer he were.
We muste despise him, as S. Augustine saythe on this versicle.
Effusus est contemptus super principes. &c. VVhye were they contemned? bicause they declared an other thing: who are contemned? those that are accursed.
For whosoeuer shall declare any other thing than that ye haue receyued, let him be accursed. &c.
Are they Princes? are they learned? are they great? are they precious stones? VVhat wilte thou call them more? are they Angels? and yet if it were an Angel from heauen, that should declare ought vnto you besides that ye haue receyued, let hym be accursed.
And are your Priests or Pope more priuileged héerein than are the heauenly Angels? if he be a Prince, as he pretendeth by his crownes: if he be learned, as he sayth his brest is the closet of all learning (thoughe indéede many Popes haue béene as simple Clerkes, as euen the simplest minister in all Englande, whose lacke of learning so often ye rayle vpo~:) if he were neuer so great, as he calleth him selfe, Pontificem maximum, the greatest Byshop: were he a precious stone him selfe, as in his Pontificalibs he is all to be dashte with precious stones.
Yea, were he an angell that came from heauen, as he is but a man that came from earth: yet for all this, if your Pope make ceremonies, and establish them for necessary doctrine of religion, besides the word of God: then is euen he, all you that so maynteyne them, before God accursed, and so to be counted as accursed, howe faste soeuer wyth Booke, Bell, and Candle, he curse other, that forsake him and his accursed ceremonies.
And haue not we then good cause to refuse them, séeme they ueuer so plausible? But as S. Augustine sayth of mans doctrine: The saying of man seemeth to haue reason for it (as the Papistes alleage many goodly reasons for them) tyll it be layde to the diuine knowledge: but when the lye (that is, mans doctrine, omnis hom mendax: euery man is alyer) shall approche to the truthe, it is deuoured, and perisheth euen as towe layde to the fyre.
And all the opinions of falshoode, which now are called Idols, bycause they be feigned and forged, shall be vtterly wasted away.
And this is their verye destruction, that as Gamaliell sayde they be not of God Demaunde of them this question, for their doctrines: An ex Deo sint, an ex hominibus, whether they be of God, or of men.
and ye shall pose them, as Chryst posed the Phariseis.
For euen as Ise melteth at the rayes of the cleare sunne, so these ceremonies waste away, and léese their estimation, whersoeuer the word of God beginneth to take place: and are maynteyned, onely where the worde of God is kepte in hucker mucker, and the people in ignoraunce, beléeuing these ceremonies to be of as muche, yea of muche more force, than the worde of God.
And therfore as Eckius, Piggis, Cingius, Peresus, Canus, Fisher, Petru a S, Cocleu, Catharinus, Hosius, Alphonsus, &c. before you: so all you stande nowe with vs stifely at this baye, that they are euen as necessarie to saluation as the word of God.
And if ye let goe this tackling, all come downe on anheape.
Whiche Alfonsus foreéeing, or euer he woulde make his booke, as he termes it, agaynst heresies.
Iaciendum est solidissimum fundamentum. &c. VVe muste laye (saythe he) a moste sounde foundation, wherewith we muste hereafter moste often defende our selues agaynst heretikes, as with a moste sure bulwarck, that the traditions and difinitions of the vniuersal church in those thinges that pertayne to faythe, althoughe the euident scripture fayle for the proofe of them, are of no lesse authoritie than the holy Scripture it selfe.
The authoritie of these most approued men by so many ages, should suffice to me, although had by no former reason conuicted it.
Let vs therfore say, that the Churche muste be obeyed in all things, that are to be beleeued, or to be done, although the authoritie of scripture want.
Thus do you estéeme and stoutly stande to the defence of your ceremonies, quite contrarie to all the foresaide au~cient fathers, that giue, as we do, all especiall prerogatiue to the only scriptures.
You were best therfore, to call them heretikes Uigilantia~s with vs, for so your Sorbonists played with Erasmus.
Though he allowed many of your popishe ceremonies, and durst not speake open mouthed agaynst any of them, for it had beene to hotte for him, since he dyd but touche them ful softly, and yet they cried out vpon him, a Uigilantian, an Aerian, an heretike, as héere you doe.
sore adde ye knowe, is soone broken: and they are tender ware, and dayntie to be delte withall, the least worde in the worlde agaynst them, will make a maruellous heretike.
Erasmus had but sayde: Quo magis haeremus. &c. Howe muche more we cleaue to bodily ceremonies, so muche the more wee encline to Iudaisme.
And dyd but wyshe on thys wyse: Opto omnes esse tales.
wishe that all men were suche, that they mighte not muche neede bodily ceremonies, or not giue so much vnto them.
prescribe to my Disciples, nought of these things: eate this meate, abstayne from that, now rest, now labour, be clad thus, touch not this, handle not that: if were their master, they shoulde not once learne to trust in these bodily thinges, least they shoulde remayne weake alwayes.
He sayde but thus, and lesse he coulde not well say, and say any thing: but Lorde what sturre the Sorbonistes made at the matter, and howe they all to be heretiked hym, Aerian, Aetian, Iouinian, Uigilantian. &c.
So that he was fayne for feare so muche as he mighte, to sette a good collour on these your ceremonies, and when he had salued the matter as well as he coulde: what sayde he then in this retractation for them? Iudaismun appello on Iudaicam impietatem: call them Iudaisme not Iudaicall impietie.
And yet for al his excuses and commendations he was fayne to say: Quanquam si Ecclesia tribuitur, &c.
Although, if that be attributed to the Church, what so euer is prescribed of the Bishops, or is done in the churches: there are many co~stitutions of Bishops, of the which, not with out cause, all men make a publike complainte.
There are many ceremonies in certaine Churches, the which ye may call either to no purpose, or els foolish, or else superstitious, for commonly either some idle Deane, or els some other meane man like him, hath deuised them.
Oft times some old wife (giuing monie therefore) obteyneth that this or that be done, now than certaine creepe in, or if not so, they breake in, euen by the violence of the co~mon peoples custome.
He should therefore not speake wickedly, that should say, the libertie of the Christian people is burdened with such constitutions and ceremonies, especially when among them there are not a fewe, that do no good at all to godlinesse, but either to lucre or ambition.
Thus was Erasmus (euen where he defendeth your ceremonies) constrained to confesse.
In obseruing these (saith he) although they were ordayned to godlinesse, the minde of many Christians is Iewishe, either while they rest there, neglecting those things that are of the spirit, or els, while with a preposterous Iudgement they attribute more to those outwarde things, then to true godlinesse, which is settled in the affections.
But euen as the hardnesse of the Iewes was to be kept in, with so many prescriptions, as it were with boundes: so charitie waxing colde in Christians, caused that the Bishops prescribed many things, not vnlike the Iewishe prescriptions, although to be kept with an vnlike minde.
For they are as it were certaine wagons, wherein the infancie of little children is brought vnto the spirite.
For ensample, the people is bid to bow their knees, or their heads to God.
By this ceremonie, the people is warned to submit their soule to God: this helpe, he that is perfect, neede not, who submitteth his minde to God in what state soeuer his bodie be.
And although that such as this the bodies comely gesture of knéeling (which is not a ceremonie inue~ted of your Bishops, but taught vs in Gods word, by Christ and his Apostles manner of prayer) we not onely vse, but also diuerse of your Churches, Ceremonies be not refused of vs, but kept: yet are they vsed farre otherwise than your prelates vrged them, or your people kept them, reposing in them as Erasmus saith: Proram puppim Sanctimoniae, The whole stay of Religion.
Tali hominu~ genere quoniam, &c. Bicause (saith he) saw the worlde full of such kinde of men now and then call them backe to the studies of true godlinesse, from the admiration of ceremonies.
But to admonish to trust to ceremonies, neither thought it necessary nor safe.
Of the worde of trusting let other looke to it, vnto me, to whom this worde to trust soundeth to leane principally vnto, it soundeth hardly to trust to the workes of men, and to trust to Ceremonies.
Neither finde these voices either in the diuine writings, or in the writings of godly men.
Thus hardly was Erasmus driue~ to his defence about your Ceremonies, by the Facultie of the Diuines of Paris, that vrged the necessitie, vertue, and confidence in them.
In the ende of all which conflictes, as he saith to them, so say to you M. Stap.
Of all these so many propositions, what is done that shoareth vp Christian Religion? that the people should beleeue, a Monkes cowle was auailable to heale diseases? that passing ouer Christe, we should with petitions sollicite the Saincts? That very many should runne to Hierusalem, leauing their wiues and childre~, and thinke that a meruaylous kinde of godlinesse is therein? that we should thinke all the constitutions of men to binde vs on paine of hell fire? That we should put the chiefest parte of Religion in the choyse of meates? that in the Churches no decking should seeme to much, but eue~ excesse also should pertaine to the honour of God? that to what Ceremonies ye lust, very much should be attributed? that boyes and wenches for triflings causes, so sone as euer they repent them of their estate, dispising their parents, should runne to Mo~kes or Nonnes? that no man but a Diuine should talke of Christ or of the holy Scriptures? that in Sainctes we should put very much confidence? that we should know euill men not to be indeede in the Churche, but to be of the Churche? that we should beleue the Church to be marueylously trimmed, with an exceeding and wonderfull strange varietie of seruices and vestiments? that lawyers should be comly appareled? that we should kisse the shoe soles, and the shoes of saincts? that nothing at all of the Popes institutions should be released, although great profite should moue it? that they that are dying should obites? that mans mortuaries may be made, that in them we should repose very much trust, other matters of this sorte? But Christian godlinesse is placed herein, that we should loue God with al our hart, and our neighbour as our selues.
That in Christ we should put the summe of our hope: that we should frame our manners our life, after the doctrine and exa~ple of him, after the rule of the Scriptures.
Fro~ the which whosoeuer calleth vs away, by any manner of means, they do rather leade vs into the dau~ger of Paganisme.
Thus much Erasmus (so far as he durst, so truly, that you nor all the world can denie the~) escried the wickednesse of your popish Ceremonies: which bicause we refuse on these so good co~sideratio~s, ye cal vs Heretikes.
But whether we in not admitting them, or you in vrging maintayning them, be rather Heretikes, let the Reader discerne Iudge.
You aske vs next, what we say to the Messalians and other Heretikes, saying concupiscence as a sinne remayneth in vs after holy Baptisme.
To your other namelesse Heretikes, when ye name the childe, we shall tell you what we say vnto them.
To the Messalians, saying sinne remaines in vs after holy Baptisme: answere, that euen your selfe do shewe by your continuall lust of lying, that concupiscence after holy Baptisme, is yet a fowle sinne in you.
Otherwise ye would not still so lust to lie both on vs, the Fathers, and the Heretikes also.
Ye cite S. Augustine to declare the Messalians errour, and so he truly doth, telling how they say, that in Baptisme our sinnes are taken away, as a raer taketh heare away, leauing the stoompes vntaken away.
If ye obiect this vnto vs, your selfe beareth witnesse against you, that ye sander vs.
For we fréely coufesse, that by Baptisme, the forgiuenesse of all our sinnes, stoomps all, past or to come, is sealed vp vnto vs. So that they are all washt away, but as S. Augustine saith of Originall sinne him selfe.
Not that it is not, but that is nor imputed.
So that hereby you will make S. Augustine him selfe a Messalian, that writeth against the Messalians.
And may say to you, your iolie porkling Pigghius, maketh of S. Augustine litle better accompte.
Furthermore (saith he) this seemeth to me euidently false, in that he saith, carnall concupiscence, the which is in our flesh, sighting against the lawe of our minde, to be properly and truly sinne in those which are not Baptized.
The which should be forgiuen in Baptisme, that it should be sinne no more: and yet not withstanding should remaine, the gilt of it being taken away.
S. Augustine, that very groynishly he saith, Ut autem haec ipsa vis concupiscibilis, &c.
But that this very force of concupiscence should properly be sinne, a faulte, iniquitie, odious of it selfe to God and execrable, and placing in his wrath, indignation or displeasure: it seemeth to me to be spoken most absurdely· nor no lesse absurdly, that the selfe same should remaine, and not be also abhominable to God, if at any time it were so.
Thus hoggishly someth Pigghius against S. Augustine, for making Concupiscence and Original sinne, to be verily sinne, euen before Baptisme: misconstruing S. Augustine in saying it is not sinne after baptisme.
expoundeth himself, that it is not sinne then, in that respect that it is not imputed, but forgiuen: where before it was sinne in it selfe and in imputation also, being not yet forgiuen.
Nowe where he sayth this is most absurde, to say that it was sinne before, and it still remayneth after baptisme, the same that it was before baptisme, and that it is not abhominable, sinne after baptisme, if it were so before, putting the case it were so before: It followeth then, that eyther you confesse master Stap. with Saint August.
that it is still in it selfe sinne after baptisme, though not sinne by imputation: or else that ye say with Pihius that it is neyther sinne in it selfe, nor by imputation, neyther after, nor before.
If ye say with Saint Augustine: you incurre that, which Pigghius calleth the most absurditie, and yet incurre you a greater, making Saint Augustine a Messalian to, that purposely wrote agaynst them, yea and your selfe a Messalian with vs also, agréeing with vs therein, and yet therein wryting agaynst vs.
If ye say with Pigghius, thinking to escape absurditie in being agaynst Saint Augustine, (which notwithstanding is absurditie inough, to be agaynst him whom ye pretende to follow) you incurre manifest falshood in being against the truth: yea and more absurditie to, then any yet rehearsed.
For, whether is it more absurde, to impute sinne to him that hath none: or to forgiue him his sinne, that yet in déede hath sinne, and of mercie not to impute it to him, as though he had not that he hath, which is no absurditie at all· For although where sinne is, it may be not imputed, yea as Dauid sayth this is blessednesse: Beatu vir, cu dominus non imputauit peccatum.
Blessed is the man whose sinnes the Lorde hath not imputed to him.
Yet can there not be imputation of sinne, where there is in déed no sinne at all: as Pigghius most absurdly sayth.
Groyne you nowe with Pigghius, that it is neyther sinne after nor before, and we will take Saint Augustines great absurditie on vs, to defende that it is in it selfe verie sinne and damnable sinne before baptisme, and remayneth still in his nature verie sinne, but not damnable, bicause it is not imputed after baptisme.
And now let vs see, whether you with Pigghius, or we with S. Aug. shall come nearer to the Messalians Heresie.
Your Capitaine Pigghius saith, that originall sinne is in deede no sinne at all in infants before nor after baptisme.
Againe you·say, the childe that is not baptised shall be condemned: But his sinnes, which are the cause of his condemnation, are not taken away by baptisme, for how can it take away that that is not? Ergo, ye make the infant to be neuer the better for baptisme.
Nowe what was the saying of the olde Heretike Adelphius vnto the godly Bishop Flauianus? Os venenum {quod} celauit euomuit, at{que} dixit nullam quidem vtilitatem ex sancto baptismate baptisatis accedere.
His mouth cast out all the venome which it hid, and sayde, there commeth no profite at all by holy baptisme, to those that are baptised.
And hath Pigghius parbreaked vp agayne this olde poyson of the Messalians, and you haue lapped vp this Pigges most filthie vomite? But woulde to God this went no further, and that ye were not herein worse poysoned than euer the Messalians were, and that it were not directly agaynst God himselfe, and quite disanulling the death and blodshed of Iesus Christe.
For, whereas the infant (sayth Pigghius) hath no sinne in him, and yet God cendemneth him if he be not baptized: then doth GOD condemne him that a innocent from sinne, God condemneth where no offence nor transgression is.
Nowe doth this agrée with the iustice of God, to condemne an infant for no sinne, or for a bare name of sin, or for another mans sin, it selfe being nothing culpable thereof: for, all this Pigghius sayth.
But God is ust and righteous in all his doinges: then is the infant borne in very sinne, and hath but the rewarde of sinne if he bée condemned.
And by sinne, and verie sinne, not a name of sinne, came death into the worlde, and so hath ouerrunne all men, for as muche as all haue sinned.
Againe ye say, that the death of Christ taketh away only the originall sinne of Infants baptized, as for other sinnes after baptisme, our selues must make satisfaction for them.
But originall sinne sayth Pigghius, is in déede no sinne, for all it is called sinne, as my writing is called my hande, bicause my hande wrote it, but it is not in deede my hande: The death of Christ therefore taketh away the onely bare name of a thing.
And so our satisfactions do not onely more than the death of Christ, but in very déede our satisfactions do all, and the death of Christ doth nothing.
And thus as ye ascribe to the vertue of his death a bare name, so make ye him a redemer in bare name, and make an Idoll of the bare name of Iesus, and take away the purport and effect thereof: giuing him baptisme, that ye call Primam gratiam to take away a bare name of sinne, but not to take away that which ye call sinne in déede.
This is the doctrine master Stapleton of your doctours, and if ye agrée with them, of yours.
Who are now the Messalians? who deface baptisme? who blaspheme God? who disanull and make of none effect the death of Christ, and all the benefite of washing vs from our sinnes, so fully in baptisme represented and exhibited vnto vs, Pigghius or S. Augustine, you or we? For shame M. Stap. leaue your lying: nay rather, for shame learne to knowe, shoulde say the righteousnesse of God, and the benefit he hath wrought by Christe? But howe shoulde ye knowe this, when yée knowe not your selues? ye féele not your owne corruption, ye acknowledge not your sinnes, but make them no sinnes, ye vnderstande not yet your principles and rudimentes of Christianitie, and perceyue not what Baptisme is, which ye receyue being infantes, and nowe taking on you to be writers, Doctours, and teachers of other: ye had more néed go to a yong scholler againe, and learne your Cathechisme better, to know what ye were deliuered from, and what remayneth in you.
Is it any maruayle though ye haue such a number of other errours, that haue as it were thus sucked error from your infancies? he can neuer be good reader that can not spell, nor good Gramarian that neuer learned hys rules, but often breake Priscians head, and so do you breake Christes, so much as lyeth in you.
If your vnskill be not of malice, learne to knowe your selues, that before baptisme ye were children of wrath, old Adam, a lumpe and Masse of verie sinne in déede, that that is borne of the flesh is flesh.
And that all euen the thoughts and affections of the fleshe, are very enemities agaynst God.
And that this leauen of sinne, hath sowred the whole dough.
That we are not sicke, but Mortui in delictis: Starke dead in wickednesse and sinnes, that all are thus, The Scripture (sayth S. Paule) hath shut vp all vnder sinne.
There is not one hath done good no not one.
Yea Dauid himself confesseth his mother co~ceiued him in sin.
Where he accuseth not his mother for an harlot, or himself of bastardie, or ye act of matrimonie to be sinful.
But that euen the masse substance of himselfe conceyued, was corrupt with sin, bicause they were sinners of whose seede he came.
For such as is the tree, such fruite it bringeth forth, we cannot (saith Christ) haue grapes of thornes, nor figges of briers.
By one man sin entred into the world, by sin death, so death passed through all, bicause al haue sinned.
Thus plainly as ye may sée that originall sinne and concupiscence is very sinne before baptisme: so learne of the Apostle to know what sill remaineth in you after baptisme.
For ye are not better than he that sayde, know that in me, that is, in my flesh there dwelleth no good thing: he knewe no pure naturall qualities remayning in his flesh as your schoolemen say they know in theirs.
And thinke ye he mitigated the matter, or was ashamed to confesse that it was euen sinne in him after Baptisme? Nay, he not onely calleth it peccatum, sinne, But inhabitans peccatum, sinne inhabiting, corpus peccatu~, the body of sinne, lege~ peccati, the law of sinne, legem rebellante~, a rebelling law.
(and is rebellio~ no sin with you?) fighting agaynst the spirit of God in him, yea leading him captiue, insomuch that, thereby he sayth he was solde vnder sin? yea it is the very body of death, vpon which he stil cried out, Miserum me quis liber abit a corpore mortis huiu.
Vvretch that am who shal deliuer me from the body of this death.
Dare you M. St. (bicause Pigghius and other popish flatterers tell ye it is no sinne) so exalt your selfe aboue the holy Apostle S. Paule, to thinke it is no sinne at all in you, that he confessed to be so great and grieuous a sinne in him? Now, and there were no other place in the scripture to proue it sinne, but euen this, were not this plaine ynough, that the Apostle sayth, Nescteba~ concupiscentiam esse peccati, nisi lex dixisset non concupisces.
had not knowne co~cupiscence to be sinne, but that the law said thou shalt not lust.
Wherin he nameth it not onely sinne, (for that ye count no sufficient argument, but say it is so named, for that it commes of sinne and disposeth and inclines to sinne, therefore is called improperly by the name of sin) but the Apostle addeth a strong reason to proue it sinne in very déed, bicause by the flat commaundement of God it is forbidden, therefore it is a transgession of Gods commaundement and displeasing God, for otherwise, God would not by his law forbid it.
Which expresse law against concupiscence, when S. Paule regarded better, than it appeareth you dothe then co~fessed it to be sin, which before he knew not by ignorance of ye law.
Although your ignorance be of wilfull malice that will neither know Gods law, nor your owne transgression of it, nor all these euident confessions of the Apostle, obiect S. Aug. against the Messalians to vs, and yet are you both agreeing with the Messalians, and flat agaynst S. August your selues.
write more plaine than this, Sicut coecitas cordis, &c. Eue~ as the blindnesse of te hart is both sinne, wherewith we beleue not in God, and the punishment of sinne, wherwith a prowde heat is punished with worthie correction, the cause of sinne, when ought is committed by the errour of a blinde heart: so concupiscence of the flesh, against the which the good spirite doth lust, is both sin, bicause there is in it a disobedience, against the rule of the mind, and the punishment of sinne, bicause it is giuen for the deseruings of the disobeyer, and the cause of sinne, by the defection of the consenter, or the contagion of him that is borne.
In which wordes as he plainely speaketh both of the state of the birth before baptisme, and of the consent, defection, and deseruings after baptisme: so he maketh concupiscence not to be sinne it selfe onely, but also the punishment and the cause of sinne.
S. Hierom doth not onely call it sinne, but least ye shoulde dally about the name, he sayth: Habitans in sua carne peccatum, hoc est vitia corporis desideria voluptatis. &c.
But if my outwarde man do that he would not, and worke that whiche he hateth: hee sheweth the commaundement to bee good, and that he worketh not that which is euill, but sinne inhabiting in his flesh, that is the vices of the bodie, and desires of pleasure, the whiche for the posteritie and ofspring, is euen grafted in mennes bodyes.
Thus maketh he concupiscence not sinne inhabiting onely, but euen verye vice it selfe engrafted in vs, speaking not onely on himselfe, but euen on Saint Paule also.
And are you better ord all these? What procéedeth this vpon, but plaine arrogancie, ioyned with obstinacy, to conceale your shame and flatter your selues, in your sinfull burning lusts? which rather than ye would with humilitie acknowledge and confesse, ye spare not so to exalt your selues, that ye deface the glorie of God: so to vaunte your pra naturalia, your frée will and merits, that ye quite take away euen the death of Iesus Christ, and to establishe your owne righteousnesse, ye disdaine to be subiect to the righteousnesse of God: and making vs beleue we had no sin at all while we were infants newly regenerate, to deceyue our selues, and to haue no more truth in vs than is in you.
Go now Master Stapleton and boast that we be Messalians, or rather clere your selues of their Heresies, besides that, ye be not onely Messalians, but Missalians, or Massalians, which is a great deale worser Heresie.
And bicause (say you) ye shall not say suppresse, conceale, or obscure the chiefe and most notable persons of your auncestrie: how say ye to the Emperors, Philippicus, Leo, Co~stantinus, co~demned with their adherents by the
generall Cou~cell at Nice, that villained by defacing breaking and burning, the Images of all the holy Hallowes of Christ Christs too.
If your guiltie conscience M. Stap. do misgiue you, that ye haue hitherto charged vs falsly, and haue suppressed, concealed and obscured our true auncestours, and in stead therof haue obiected Heretikes: it were some token of grace and repentance in you, that ye say yet now at the length, ye will not suppresse, conceale, or obscure the chiefe and notable persons of our auncestrie.
Where ye aske vs what we say to these thrée Emperors, Philippicus, Leo Constantinus that ye say villained Images: whatsoeuer we say to them Master Stapelton, some good fellowe perhaps will say this to you, that if they bée suche most notable persons, ye might haue spared such villainous language, except it be naturall to you to vse villaynes Rhetoricke on chiefe Princes and most notable personages.
But will not meddle with your well nurtured termes, onely desire you, as ye pretend, not suppresie, conceale, nor obscure indeede, the chiefe and most notable persons of our auncestrie, whereby ye meane the auncient Emperors.
If ye will not in very déed, how chaunce ye name but these thrée for taking away of Images? why suppresse ye ye names of the Emperors Ualens Theodosius, that made a plaine decrée agaynst all maner of Imagrie, of all the holy Hallowes of Christ, as ye call them, Christes to? and yet your seuenth generall Councell condemned the~ not, yea your selfe (as after shal appéere) do highly co~mend them.
What ment ye to suppresse the name of Carolus Magnus, commended likewise highly euen by your selfe? and yet he abolished all Images also? Why name ye Philippicus, Leo Constantinus onely? and tell not of all the other Emperors before these, after these, euen til the time of Theodorus Lascaris that yelded to your Pope herein at Lions Councell, therfore the Gréekes depriued and expelled him for his labour.
Syth then so many chief and most notable persons of the auncient Emperors (of which your self graunt some to be as godly as notable, being before that Cou~cell were not condemned by it, being as ye say, our au~cestors herein are altogither quite suppressed concealed obscured: is not this very partiall and vnfaithfull dealing in reiecting our honourable pedegree, M. St? But see you will neuer leaue your lying.
Nowe where ye say these thrée Emperors were condemned by the seuenth generall Councell at Nice.
True in déede they were so, euen as you condemned all Godly Princes at your last Trident Councell, that abolishe your Idolatrie.
What maner a Councell it was, and what maner of reasons they haue in it, for the setting vp of Images, thinke your selfe was halfe ashamed to shewe, but muche more afrayed to note, by whoe authoritie thys Councell was called and ordred, which had béene perteyning to the issue betwéene the Bishop Master Feck.
But we shall see more thereof when we come thereto.
Ye are very straight laced For defacing and burning the Images of all Hallowes, of Christ, and of Christes Images, and this ye call villanie, But ye make no boanes to deface and burne as villaynes and herelikes the very all Hallowes in déede of Christ, his true and liuely Images and members, this is no villanie with you at all.
But euen your owne bookes, yea your owne Pope (if Clement were a Pope, and if the worke were his) condemneth you.
For what doe you herein otherwise th did the Heathen· If whom he writeth thus: That Serpent also is woont to alleage such woordes as this, we worship visible Images to the honour of the inuisible God, but this is most certainely false: for if in deede yee will worship the Image of God, yee shoulde in doing of good deedes vnto man, worship the verie Image of God, for in euery man is the Image of God.
His similitude is in no other things but there, where is a benigne and pure minde.
If ye will therefore honour truely the Image of God, wee open to you that whiche is the truth, that yee doe well to man whiche is the Image of God, giue honour and reuerence to him, giue meate to the hungrie, and to the thirstie drinke, to the naked cloathing, succour to the sicke, harborough to the straunger, minister to him that is in prison such things as hee needeth.
And this is that which in deede shall be counted giuen to God.
These things do so much redounde to the honor of Gods Image, that he which doth them not, is thought to do villanie to Gods Image.
VVhatkin worship then of God is this, to gad vp and downe after stonie and wodden shapes, to worship the~ as though they were godheads, being vaine figures and without life, and dispise man in whome is the very Image of God.
But knowe ye for certaintie, that he that committeth murther, or whoredome, yea whatsoeuer he doth to hurte or iniurie men, in all these thinges is the Image of God violated, &c. vnderstande ye therefore that this is the Diuels suggestion lurking in you, which persuadeth you ye may seeme godly while ye worship vnsensible thinges, and not to seeme vngodly, while ye hurt both sensible and reasonable creatures.
Thus saith your Pope not onely to the Heathen then, but also to you, vsing the same Heathen fashions now, standing so much on the defacing burning and villaning Gods Images as ye call them of woode stone: And your selues burne, deace and villaine, the very Images of God, either not knowing the true Images of God, but taking dead pictures for his Image, or wittingly reiecte your Popes aduertisement, and do contrary to your consciences.
But as ye thus deface Gods very Image, so deface ye God him selfe.
Ye stande much vppon his pretended Image, and yet ye regarde not him, his worde nor his commaundement.
Ye honour ye say his Image, and dishonour him selfe.
omit the foresaid dishonoringes of him in your inuocation, in iustifiyng your wicked concupiscence from beyng sinne, &c. ye dishonour him euen in the Images that ye made of him, to honour him by.
Was not this a dishonour of God, to picture him out like a Creature, like a sinner, like a corruptible man, like an old greybearded Father, yea like a monster with three faces in one head, as the eathen pictured Ianus with two faces, or Gerion with thrée bodies, or Cerberus with three heads? what was dishonour to God if this were not? to set out any picturs of God, yea after the portrature of man, whose bodie though it is, Formae praestamissim, Of a most comely shape, is yet so vnsitting for God, that S. Augustine calleth it Sacrilege.
Yea God sende it all not out, that ye mainteyne a foule Heresie of the Trinitie therein.
But how cunningly soeuer ye shall cleere your: selfe thereof, a great dishonoring of God it was.
lie can not be an honour to him that is truth and a spirite, and will be worshipped in spirite and truth, not in a bodely Figure, and that a false figure too? if the picture of God be not a lye, when sawe ye God at any time? if ye neuer sawe him, ye go by blinde ghess.
Yea, if he him selfe, euen for this purpose, when he would most shew him selfe, would yet shewe no bodily figure, least any should Worship him by any bodily Fiigure: will you presume to make after your fantaies, a bodly forme or rather deformitie of him? how can this be but a lie, a dishonour, an Idolatrie, and presunpteouse rebellion against Gods purpose and expresse commaundement? Euen as Iob saith: Currit impuis contra Deum extent collo, The wicked runneth against God euen with a stretched out necke.
Thus as you deface God, pretending his honour: so deface ye those Saincts that ye call al hallowes, euen vnder the pretence of honoring them, and their Images For if it be not honour to God, to honour him by a picture: thinke you it is than an honour to his Saincts, to be honored by pictures? and if his Saincts themselues refused honour, will they haue their pictures honored? Your shifte that ye make of unlearned and lay mennes bookes, neither will any thing auaile you, nor your selues vse it otherwyse than for a shifte.
For ye vsed them not as remembrancers, but ye honored them as helpers.
Now, if a learned man may not knéele, créepe, crouche, offer, and praye to his booke, thoughe the booke were of the Saintes lyues neuer so muche, yea thoughe it were Gods booke, (Moyses honoured not the verie Tables writen with the finger of God) by what priuiledge then may the Lay and vnlearned person, honoure, knéele, offer and praye vnto their bookes: yea admitting the case, that Images were the Idiotes bookes, as ye call them.
But God wote they are verie Idiots, that haue no other, but suche bookes.
And you most Idiotes of all (I am afrayde) that make suche Idiotes reasons.
The Idolatry that ye made the people to commit was to manifest.
The tales that your Legendes tell of the workes of Images, are tootoo shamefull M. Stapleton.
Ye tell vs, howe the picture of the Uirgin Marie was Bawde to Beatrice a Nonne the space of the xv. yere, while she played the common strumpet.
Ye tell vs that at Spire, (Ubi adoratur Imago Sancta dei genetricis quae ad sanctu~ Bernardum tribus vicibus locuta est, &c.
Where the Image of the holy mother of God is adored, which spake three times to S. Bernarde,) boy gaue hir childe a piece of bread criyng Pu Pu, and the Image of Christ embraced the boye, and saide Pu pu pe, noli flere, post tridum mecum papabis.
Whine not, and three daies hence, thou shalt eat pappe with me.
Another time, how the Image of Christ came down out his mothers armes playde with an abbots childe.
Another time when the arme of his Image of stone was broken, how bloud gushed out, and the stone Image of his Mother seing the bloud, rent hir garmentes and ornamentes of stone about hir, rente the Iuels about hir necke, and made naked hir brest vnto the pappes, for the reproch and iniurie that was done to hir babie.
Another time, when Auinion was besieged, they got hir Image vpon the gate, putting their confidence in hir, and when one standing behind hir was shot at, Imago genu erexit, &c.
The Image lift vp hir knee, and receyued the stroke of the arrow, &c. and it sticketh yet in hir thigh.
Ye tell vs how on a time, Quidam pictor Diabolum cum cornibus, &c.
certaine painter painted the diuel with hornes and other members, so vgglie as he could, but the Image of the Virgin Marie he painted so faire as he could, whereat the Diuell being angrie, brake the scaffold while he was painting hir Image.
Mox Imago pussimae virginis, pictori manuu~ porrexit, eum ne caderet firmiter retinuit, sic{que} eum daemone custodiuit.
VVith that the Image of the most godly Virgin caught the painter by the hande, and helde him fast from falling, and so it saued him from the Diuell.
Ye tell vs of a Churche set on fyre by lightning, but when it came néere to the Image: Quasi expauescens, omnino intactam reliquit. &c.
The fyre as afrayde of it, lefte it vntouched: yea a bunche of Pecocks fethers, leaning to the Image of wood, escaped vnburnt also.
And this miracle (sayth he) was done to shewe, quòd sibi seruentes, ab igne aeterno liberare faciliter possit: That she can easily deliuer from hell fyre those that serue hir Howebeit, at Wilsdean hir picture escaped not the fyre so scotte free, but that the one halfe was burned, euen with the neglige~ce of the candles that were set about hir.
But to salue thys blemishe, the remnaunt of the blocke wrought as greate miracles, as any of the other.
For when the Priest had sent to London the residue of the Image that was saued from the fire, to be peeced out by the Caruer: after he coulde not make the olde and the newe to frame well togither, he cast the olde picture behinde the stall, and made another lyke it.
The Priest, when he came to sée the picture, where is my wife, quothe he: to whome the Paynter shewed the picture that he had newe made lyke the other.
No, quothe the Priest, thou lyest, this is an other, this is not my wife.
No, no husbande, quoth the olde Image, that is not I: am héere hidden and caste behinde the stall.
This was a famous miracle, and his wife deserued to be caried home agayne with solemne processio~.
It were infinite to tell the tales of your Roodes that spake, that nodded, that sweatte, that bledde, that embraced and kissed those that came to them: with a number of such like forgeries, to make the people beléeue, not onely the Saincts, but euen the very pictures of them had a force and influence of grace and helpe in them.
And so the Roode of grace, our Lady of grace, our Lady of pitie. &c. had their names.
omitte your other Saincts pictures, yea some of those whome ye worshipped, that God knowes were séely Sainctes, and your selues doubte whether euer they were honest men and women, or no.
Yea of those that were neither men nor women, meane not Angels, whom ye honored in pictures of winged and fethered men, but of S. Sunday, of S. Sauiour, of S. Crosses, &c. Neither God, nor Angell, nor man, nor woman, of whome ye might say, as the Priest sayde, when he byd his beades on Sunday: Good friends, ye shall haue this wéeke the feast of S. Epiphanie, but whether it be hee Sainct or shée sainct.
Of these Saincts you had pictures, you had Churches, ye had Pilgrimages, ye had offringes, and yet were there no suche persons at all, but as the heathen had the pictures of Iustice other vertues, worshipping them also, as Lactantius vpbraydeth to them: Quid nobis inaem Iustitiam depingi, VVhy paynte ye out vnto vs bare Iustice? can ye excuse this also of manyfest Idolatrie? Thinke you that your seconde Nicen councell woulde not lykewyse haue condemned you euen for very shame, as tootoo grosse Idolaters? What sayth Alfonsus your owne champion, writing of purpose in the defence of Images, in handling the fact of king Ezechias, for destroying the Brasen Serpent? the Christian people (sayth he) were nowe as prone to Idolatrie, as the people of Israell were then, nor coulde be called otherwise from theyr errour: Then, if Images were broken in peeces, would beleeue, that they ought wo thily to be broken.
This is the iudgement of Alfonsus vpon all your Alhallowes Images, and Christes too.
But heereto adioyning this false assumption: But the Christian people are not nowe so prone to Idolatrie as were the Iewes, he concludeth: there is no suche vrgent cause why Images oughte to be broken, as there was then.
But if he had acknowledged the manyfest truth, and had looked no further, than in his owne countrey, of S. Iames picture of Compostella, that (as they say) can moue and stirre his head by frowning, or looking cheerefully, and other proper knackes: and had he séene the great Idolatrie committed therto, and how the people flocked tro~ al parts thither: he should then haue seene as great, if not a great deale greater idolatrie, among those that professe the name of christianitie, than euer was to the Brasen Serpent among the Iewes, and that (as he would excuse the Popishe idolatrie) it was not one or two deceyued by a certayne simplicitie, but that it was more than an hundreth, yea than an hu~dreth thousand, that were so deceyued by a certayne fraude of your priestes, that no preaching or teaching coulde serue to remoue their Idolatrie, so long as ye let the Images stande.
Which not onely ye did, but teached and preached suche fables, as more encreased your gaynes, and the simple peoples Idolatrie.
And therfore, euen by Alpho~sus reason, your Alhallowes Images are worthy to be defaced broken in fitters by Christian Princes, as by Ezechias the Brasen Serpent was.
Nowe to the further improofe of Alphonsus his false assumption, that Christians are not so prone to Idolatrie as the Iewes: wil not presse ye with Erasmus testimonies, nor yet with Sir Thomas More, but euen as did before with your owne councell of Colleyns complaynts, of the wickednesse vsed about your Images.
But, sithe muche abuse hath also by little and little crept in, about the worshippe of Images, that the Images also of those thinges haue beene brought into the Churche, whiche haue no testiminie of the Scripture, or of approued authors: That many carued Images beyonde measure, with great sumptuousnesse and coste, were sette vp so faste in Churches, as thoughe heerein a great parte of godlinesse consisted, the poore people of Christ being in the meane while neglected, which are the liuely Images of Christe.
Furthermore, that we beholde the Images so paynted, and expressed, that they seemed to bee forged, not after the fourme of Christian honestie, but after the enticementes of the vanitie of the worlde.
To conclude, that the rude people was suffred to worshippe the Images, with a certayne truste reposed in them, the which is not altogither free fro~ Idolatry, so that they can not be excused of Idolatry, that haue chosen to them selues any Image to be worshipped, and that either for the fairenesse therof, or the foulnesse, or the newnesse, or the oldnesse, beleeuing that Image to haue some vertue, yea or some godhead or diuinitie more than the rest.
Thus do your owne mouthes co~demne your selues, that not of trifling points, nor of any extraordinary chance, but of open and ordinary Idolatrie.
omitte suche casualties of Idolatrie, as are obiected in Biga salutis, if the people should worship the diuell for God in any forme, in any reuelation, or in the consecrate hoste, which ye made the people worship (since the diuel can tra~sforme him selfe to any such shape, yea of an angell of light) whether ye peoples worship be Idolatrie or no.
wil rather detecte your more grosse idolatrie, althoughe that, of your honoring the cake were grosse inough.
Neither can it be but manyfest idolatrie, sithe there is no proportion betwéene the body of Christ, and suche a likenesse, whereas in euery Image a right and true portrature is to be required.
But into that Idolatrie will not nowe enter: onely will come to your next obiection of the crosse.
To the whiche ye committed most open idolatrie, not only worshipping with cappe knée, with crouching, knéeling, knocking, blessing, kissing gréeting, and praying vnto, but ascribing the merite of saluation to suche your worship of the crosse.
Ye tell vs how a théefe, that continuing an arrant théefe all the dayes of his life.
He saide one Pater noster before the crucifix, and so he was saued.
And therefore saith Discipulus: Christo valdè placet cum quis orat prtereundo Crucifixum in publica strata, vnum Pater noster, vnum Aue Maria.
VVhen one passing by in the open streete, saythe one Pater noster, and one Aue Mary, Christe is highely pleased.
But not content with this Idolatrie, ye make humble prayers vnto it, as though it had life and soule, as though it were God it selfe.
Crux cunctis astris. &c. Crosse more cleare than all the starres, famous to the worlde, very louing vnto men, whiche onely wast worthy to beare the price of the worlde, saue this present company, gathered togither this day in thy prayses.
Thus prayed you to the crosse in your olde primer.
Haue you neuer sayd this prayer to the crosse? Crux benedicta. &c. blessed Crosse, bicause the Sauiour of the worlde did hang on thee, and the king of Angels triu~phed on thee, adore thee, prayse thee, blesse thee, with all my senses, be thou our consolation in our trouble.
pray thee holy crosse, by the omnipotent God, that thou wilt deliuer, and pull me, out of all my necessities and greeues, and defende me from the wrath of God, and from the vengeaunce of all my enemies, and from sodayne death, and from all shame, perill, and blasphemie, and from all sinnes, wherewith mans frayltie may sinne agaynst God.
beseeche thee holy crosse, by the loue of Iesus Christe our Lorde, who hath exalted thee maruellously, aboue all thinges earthly, that thou wilte protecte and defende me from the Diuell, and from all daungers and euils of minde and body.
Lo, master Stap. what gallant Rhethorike is hre to the Crosse.
And as with these idolatrous prayers ye worshipped the picture of the Crosse, so with the like or worse, ye worshipped the picture of the face of Christe, which yet by the auncient describers thereof, was nothing like his face.
Neither can ye say, ye prayed not to it, but vnto Christe, whom the face in the cloath represented: for euen vnto the paynted face it selfe ye prayed, in this Rime dogrell: Salue sancta facies nostri Redemptoris, in qua nitet species diuini splendoris, impressa panniculo niuei candoris, dataque Ueronicae signum ob amoris, salue decus saculi speculum sanctorum, quòd videre cupiunt spiritus Coelorum, nos ab omni macula purga vitiorum, at{que} nos consortio iung beatorum.
Salue nostra gloria in hac vita dura, labili fragili cito transitura, nos perduc ad patriam foelix figura, ad videndum faciem quae est Christi pura· &c. Ye can not say héere, ye spake this to Christe him selfe, or to the very face of Christe, but your prayer is euen to the very figure or paterne of the face in the linnen cloth, and ye desire that paynted face, to exalt vs to the very face it selfe.
The lyke Idolatrous prayer and adoration ye make to the fiue wou~ds, Salue vulnus dextrae manus, &c. God speede, wounde of the right hande, &c adore thee, honour thee, require thee, beseeche thee, that a wretche nowe dying.
Hayle thou right hande wounde of Christe, thou whiche waste pearced with a moste harde nayle. &c. VVe adore thee, wounde, to thee we encline our head, as to a moste sweete fountayne, by thee let it be giuen, that we may ouercome our enimies, and reioyce in the laste day.
God speede wounde of the righte foote, &c. God speede wounde of the lefte foote.
What foolishe prayers, and beastly Idolatrie was this, master Stapleto~, and yet were these prayers counted suche notable stuffe, that they are enfraunchised with great priuiledges and pardons.
Ye haue a goodly rubrike that sayth: Fuit quaedam foemina solitaria reclusa, &c.
There was a certayne woman that was solitarie, and a recluse, which desiring to know the number of the woundes of Chryst, prayed God to reueale it to hir.
At the length, beeing heard, God sayde vnto hir· The woundes of my body were so many, as if thou wouldest honor the~ with worship, thou must say euery day throughout the yeare, xv. Pater nosters, &. xv. Aue Maries, and so thou shalt salute worshipfully euery one of my woundes.
And he that shall say this prayer one yeare, shall deliuer. xv. soules of his kinne out of Purgatorie, and. xv. lyuing shall be confirmed iust and in goodstate, and he himselfe shall obtaine grace and knowledge of perfection.
And he shall see my most holy bodie. xv. dayes before his death, &c.
And with my welbeloued mother Marie, will come to him before his death.
To all that say this prayer, betweene the Eleuation, and the third Agnus dei, are giuen by Pope Boniface two thousande yeares of pardon, at the intreatie of Philip the French king.
An infinite number of lesser pardons prefixed to your prayers omitte, howe Pope Iohn.
giues a hundreth dayes of Pardon, to him that sayth, Salue plaga lateris. &c.
Cardinals added euery one fortie dayes more a piece, and howe by Bull they were confirmed.
These were but paltrie pardons in respect of those in your Primer, wherein among other is this more frankly giuen.
VVhosoeuer being in the state of grace, shall say these seuen prayers following deuoutly, with seuen Pater nosters, and seuen Aue Maries, before the Image of pitie: Hee shall deserue seuen and fiftie thousand yeares of pardon.
The which were graunted of three Popes, that is to wee of Saint Gregorie, fourtene thousand yeares: Secondly of Pope Nicholas the fift, fourtene thousand yeres, in the yere of the Lorde.
Thirdly of Pope Sixtus the fourth, who composed the fourth and the fift little prayers of these Suffrages following,
yeres, and hath dubled these pardons, in the yeare of our Lorde.
Whether was this more wicked Idolatrie, or foolish lies M. Stap? what say you here euen to your owne Popes, doth not your Primar make them very Heretikes teaching a doctrine of so manie thousande yeares pardon after the day of Dome? Howe muche differeth this from the fowle errour of Origen? Or did they thinke the worlde should continue so long, or euer the day of Dome shall come, which Christe and his Apostles then sayde, was so néere at hande, and your Popes since that tyme haue stretched it out so many thousande yeres to come? or to what torment shoulde the soule goe, when his pardon shoulde be expired? For, be the day neuer so long, at the lengthe (ye saye) commeth Euensong.
Shoulde the soule at the ende of those seuen and fiftie thousand yeares of pardon, go from heauen to hell? For Purgatorie lasteth, ye saye, but tyll Domes day.
Or vsed your Primer, Numero finto pro infino, a determinate number for an vndeterminate number· But whye then dyd your Popes one after an other, encrease the number, and so straightly limitte it? and yet by your leaue your Primer missed one thousande years in the accompte.
For promising seuen and fiftie thousande, it reckoneth vp but stre and fiftie thousande.
And thoughe one in a thousande breake no square, as they saye: yet a thousande yeares is somewhat, master Stapleton, it is little more, ye wotte, than one thousande and a halfe, since Chryst was borne.
But goe to man, since your Popes are so liberall to pardon for so many thousandes, ye shall not say, we will sticke to pardon them for one thousande backe agayne.
woulde counte this but one of your Arithmeticall scapes (as ye obiecte to the Byshoppe) but that your Primer is full, if not of suche misreckoninges, yet of suche lauishe summes.
Pope Iohn the twelf the (say the one of your Rubrikes) hathe graunted to all that saye this prayer for the dead: Auete omnes fideles. &c: passing throughe the Churche yarde, so many yeares of Pardon, as bodies be buried therein since is was a Churchyarde.
By whiche rule in Paules Churchyarde, a man might easily get a nemscu· of yeares of pardon.
Phie M. St. this is too grosse and shamefull deceyuing of the people.
Whether it he your Popes faulte (as they can not be excused, sith it is decréed, sealed confirmed by them, and their full Chapters of Cardinals, which ye say in such authenticall doings can not erre) or whose faultes so euer they were, in your Primers and prayer bookes, they are solemnly set out in redde letters, to egge the people to pray vnto your Images.
But ye will say swarue fro~ my purpose, some of these prayers were not vnto Images.
This writing that followeth was written at Rome, in the Chappell of S. Marie at Hierusalem in the Temple.
VVhilom S. Gregorie the Pope did celebrate Masse in the citie of Rome, and when he came to the consecration, the Lorde appeared to him in this Figure that is here painted.
VVherevpon he being moued of compassion, graunted to all that did beholde such a picture, and with making curtesie, and deuoutly saying fiue Pater Nosters, and fiue Aue Maries: fouretene thousand yeares of pardon.
And besides this xij. Popes his successours haue graunted euery one of them fiue hundred yeeres of pardon, the summe of the whole pardon is twenty thousand yeeres.
And as ye gaue these liberall pardons for the beholding of the picture of Christ, so for looking on the Crosse, yea the Nayles, whippes, roddes, ropes, and other instraments, where with he was put to death, and for the saluting worshipping of them ye offer no smal pardons also, of the which in one booke haue two Rubrikes.
The one to this noble prayer, Crucem coronam spneam, claos{que} diram{que} lanceam, deuote veneremur: Acetum fel virgam{que} spum spo~giam, igiter veneremur: Uele laternam nobilens, pellicanum calcem, Arundines pungente tunicam inconsuilem, sortes columna~ stabilem, fnes vigentes, flagella fustes innumerabiles, enses latronum horribles, denarios ter denos, manus cdentes dissimiles, cultellos duros forcipes, vreos menos serpentes, scalam malleum, sepulchrum lumen candelabrum, corde recolamus.
To sturre vs vp to say this foolishe and wicked prayer to worship all these things, is prefixed this Rubrike.
Quicun{que} hac arm, &c. Who soeuer shall beholde these armes of our Lord Iesus Christ, and say deuoutly this prayer: sixe thousand yeeres of pardon are graunted him of S. Peter the Apostle, and of thirtie Popes after him, if he be with out deadly sinne and in charitie.
The second Rubrike in the same booke on these verses: Lance Crux claus, tua pertuls corde &c: is this: Quicunque arma Domini, &c. VVho soeuer shall looke deuoutly vpon the weapons of our Lord Iesus Christ, and shall deuoutly say this prayer, he shall haue of his sinnes beyng truly confessed and repenting of them, sixe thousand, seuen hundred, and fiue yeeres of pardons of S. Peter the Apostle graunted him, and graunted of.
How agreeth this with the former M. Stapleton, or did S. Peter giue this pardon twis, and augment the summe bicause of the excellencie of those verses? But these are trifles to the thirde that followeth.
Crux, coronae, spinae, flagellis, clauis, lanciae, marcellae, spongae, laqueae, columpilae, vesti purpuriae, aundinae, honorem impendamus.
This is good Latine warrant ye, and as good as the matter euery whit: and so good, that, saith the Rubrike ouer it, VVho soeuer say this Orison here following, shall haue great grace of almighty God, and sixe thousand thousande and threescore and ten yeeres of very pardon.
Sitte downe Master Stapleton, sith ye pretende to be so perfect an Arithmetrician, and cast your accountes, and ye shall sée a fayre muster of pardons to comforte your sprites with all.
Feare not (man) the Diuell so long as these last, and many thousandes more there are besides, but these are easily gotten, euen for worshipping the Iewes Ropes, Halters, Hammers, Riues, Swordes, their Fistes, yea their spettle and all.
But if ye be ashamed and thinke scorne to worship these thinges, as in déede ye may well be ashamed of them: yet haue suche holy Reliques for you to worship, that ye can hardely finde any higher.
But tell ye you must take vp your hand and blisse you at the sight of them, and so they worke meruailes as your holy bookes recorde.
And that not for the Images of all Hallowes, but of Christes Image, or rather of him selfe, that ye should know euen the iuste length of him, as they pretende.
Among the good prayers aforesaide, is this Rubrike: Qui cupit cognoscere longitudinem, &c.
He that desireth to know the length of Christ being God, let him take this line here drawne forth, twoo and thirtie times measured, which line was brought out of the Citie of Constantinople, in a certaine Grosse of Golde.
VVhiche line who soeuer in the day doth deuoutly looke vppon, and say the Antiphona with a Collect, and shall signe him thrise with the signe of the holy Crosse, he shall not that daye die any suddayne death, nor be vexed with Diuell, nor with any tempest, nor any euill nor any Creature shall hurte him.
And this line was brought by an Angell to King Charles the great.
This is a fayre grace M. Stapl. for looking vppon and worshipping a line of the length of Christ.
But haue another length and Rubrike, that hath more Iolie promises to stirre vs vp to worship it.
Which sayeth: This Crosse fiftene times measured, is the length of our Lorde Iesu Christe, and that day ye looke thereon, blesse ye therewith.
There shall no wicked spirite haue power to hurt you: nor thunder, ne lightning, sleeping ne waking shall not hurt you: nor winde nor blasting, on lande nor on water shall not hurt you: nor in battayle ye shall not be ouercome with your enimies, bodely, ne ghostly: nor die no shamefull death, nor suddayne death, nor of the pestilence, nor in water be drowned, nor in fire be brente: and if yee be in deadly sinne, ye shall not die therein: and you shall increase in worldly goodes: nor ye shall not die of woundes, nor of stroake, nor without confession: nor ye shal not be combred with no fiendes: and if a woman haue this Crosse, and lay it on hir wo~be when she traueleth with childe, she shall soone be deliuered, and the childe shall haue Christendome, and the mother purification of holy Church.
S. Ciriake, and S. Iulite desired this gifte of almightie God, and he graunted them, as it is registred in Rome, at S. Iohn Lateranence.
Here are many moe fayre graces if all were true.
But some of them your Papistes them selues haue ounde starke lies.
And some of them, as that he shall not be combred with no fiende, &c.
thinke may well be true, as you will graunt dare say, resoluing them by your Equipollences, on which ye stande so much in your fourth booke.
As for the assurance of the truth of these lengthes, that, remit to you M. St. to reconcile them togither: how the one came fro~ Constantinople, the other fro~ Rome: how the one was grau~ted of God to S. Ciriake, and S. Iulite: the other brought by an Angell to king Charles the great, and yet as appeareth by the prayer, it came first to S. Ciriake, and S. Iulite too.
With other such circumstances as arise in the conference of them.
Onely note the lengths them selues, and pray you M. St. (if ye haue as good skill in Geometrie, as in Arithmetike) to measure these two lengths, the one. xxxij. the other.
xv. times as they require, and see how properly they will agree.
thinke ye shall finde them differing, little lacking the length of both Crosses ioyned togither.
So that the one (light on which it shall) must needes be a very lie, and haue no vertue in it at all, but those that worship it be Idolaters, worshipping a false thing.
If ye replie an inche breakes no square: although it breake no square, yet it breakes le~gth M. St. neither ought ye to misse one inche in this matter, wherein ye pretende is such vertues, and so exactly take vpon ye to describe euen the iumpe length, and say it came from God, and his Angell brought it, knew not the Angell the iumpe length, or would he not giue it truly, and would haue it so precisely worshipped? surely then he was no good Angell.
But the difference is more tha~ an inch M. St. or.
And would ye haue Christ cut shorter by the head, to make your le~gths euen? were it not better that a great many such liers as you hop edlesse before? which of these two shall we beléeue M. Stapleton? or is it not best, by your counsell, to let them both goe in the irrops name, and all their forged vertues with them, than for gréedinesse of their gaye promises, endanger to lose bodie and soule by worshipping a lie, and committing foule Idolatrie? Well let them goe for me, if ye he agreed thereto, M. Stap.
But yet ye haue one excuse as ye thinke to mitigate the matter, that how soeuer they missed in the Figure, eyther of the Crosse, or the Crucifixe, of the which some was long, some was shorte: this hindred not the peoples deuoute meditation thereon.
Although M. Stapleton this nothing excuse the former manifest lie, where ye misse of the le~gth, that so iustly ye pretende to set out, and yet ascribe the vertue to the iust length, saying, Per virtutem gloriosa longitudnis tuae.
By the vertue of thy glorious length: yet to come to your meditations, that ye teach vs do come to vs, by the beholding the Crucifixe: If these were as fonde, as the other worship Idolatrouse, what shall we then iudge of the residue? Three things (saith Discipulus) we must consider, firste, that Christ hanges downe his necke on his shoulder, to kisse you (and herevppon your Capochini Friers hang their heads a wrie, bicause the Crucifixe is so set forth).
Secondly, the Crucifixe hath both his handes stretched abroad, to embrace you.
Thirdly, his feete are both fastned to the Crosse, to betoken that he will not starte from you.
Suche toyes ye imagine the Crucifixe to represent vnto vs, and thereout gather your mysticall significations, that a man might looke thereon till his eyes stare, and neuer thinke on kissing, colling, or any such things.
Thus did ye mocke and deceyue the simple people, and made them besides Idolaters very Idiotes indeede with these your Idiotes bookes.
But the Booke of God that setteth out to the eyes of our faith, the death and benefites of Iesus Christe, ye quite lefte out, and would not suffer that Crucifixe to be looked vppon.
Wherein they should haue séene and learned to know most fully Christ Crucified, without any daunger of Idolatrie at all.
Now if ye say all this hitherto inferreth not yet Idolatry, so lo~g as ye giue not to the Crosse, the very worship that is due to God, but reserue that still to him alone, which ye call Latriam, and giue to the Crosse Duliam, and Hyperduliam, although this shifte be fully by others alreadie confuted: yet admitting the same, it so litle shifteth your manifest Idolatrie, that it proueth ye liers on your own heads, and Idolaters euen by your owne distinction.
Sith, not onely ye gaue Latriam the Crosse, but also defende that it may be giuen thereto.
Chiefly Thomas of Aquine your great schoolemaster, yea M. Doctour Saunders himself one of your chiefest Louaine writers, in his especiall treatise of the defence of Images, ca~ scarce tell what to defende herein.
For firste he saythe, we defende it for the more probable, that the same degree of hononr is not due to the Image of Christe, of our Ladie or of other Sainctes, whiche is due to Christ, our Ladie, and to other Saincts them selues.
But there is a certayne proper honour, due to a good remembraunce or monument.
But in the ende conclusio~ of his whole booke, one while he defendeth Thomas, and graunteth the figure of the thing, to haue the same honour done to it, that is done to the thing it selfe: and saith the worship that is done to Christ, is done to his purple coate also.
Then fleeth he touche againe from that, saying that the Church neuer taught, nor doth teach, that the Image of Christ, must be adoured with the honour due to God.
But after that flying as fast from Thomas, If Thomas (saith he) haue bene deceyued in this question, it is an errour in Philosophie and not in Diuinitie.
pray you M. Stapleton if you may be so bolde, pull him by the léeue, and desire him to be ware how he speaketh against Aristotle and his Metaphysikes.
What? is Aristotles Metaphysikes no good Diuinitie with him? if the Sorbonistes heare this, it is to be feared they will condemne him for an Heretike, as they serued Ramus.
Now when M. Saunders hath thus startle too and fro, in docke out netle (for belike he was neled with this question) notwithstanding (saith he) put it for an vndoubted truthe, that all Images be honored in the Churche, with an inferiour honour to that which is due to the first samplars, and principall paterns.
And yet by and by quite contrarie to this, he saithe: For whether, in any case, the honour of the Image may be the same with the honour of his truth or no, neyther will, nor can, nor am perfectly able throughly to discusse.
And yet before he determined it Doctour like, and saide, put it for an vndoubted truth that Images haue inferiour honour.
But in conclusion, when he shoulde defende the Papistes from the perill of Idolatrie, and fully determine how farre Images may be honoured without Idolatrie, he concludes they must be honored with such honour, as is giuen without furder curious discussing, whether any more may be giuen them or no.
And telleth vs that howe muche is dewe to the Image, we neede not care.
When all this while, this was the chiefest thing in this pointe cared for, and that he him selfe so muche hath laboured in, and one while denies, another while grauntes: one while determines, another while saithe he will not, can not, nor is able to determine: thus standing in doubt, and yet putting vs out of doubte: and all this adoe is onely for this question, how much or how little honour should be giuen to Images, least we committe Idolatrie to them, by giuing the worship of Latria after his owne distinction: and after all this adoe, to lap vp the doubte with saying, VVee neede not care how much is dewe, and we must honour Images with such honour as is giuen, with out furder curiouse discussing, whether any more may be giuen or no: what is this but to open a gap to all Idolatrie? But if M. D. Sau~d. may thus ridde his handes of this matter, by bidding the people not care how much worship they giue to Images, whereto then should we care for this your shift of these three kindes of worships, sith it is not to be cared how much worship be giuen them? Thus ordered you the simple people then, bidding them honour, worship, cappe, knéele, offer, pray vnto, trust vppon, and care not how much they gaue to the Image.
And this carelesse Idolatrie M. Stapleton would you and your complices bring vs againe vnto.
Neyther are these things (as M. Sanders pretendes to mitigate the matter) Quiddities subtilties imagined of Thomas, a few Schoolemen only: but all your Schoolemen for the most part, handle and tosse this question to and fro, hauing occasion by the excéeding great· Idolatrie committed in the meane while by the people.
Yea not onely the Schoolemen helde their opinions: but the Friers as fast preached the like worship, and cited the famous Scoolemen for them.
The Crosse of Christe may be worshipped with the worship of Latria (which ye call Diuine worship) bicause the Crosse besprent with the bloude of Christ, is the very Image of the Crucifix spredde thereon: and the Image of it also, is euery wood that is formed after the fashion of a Crosse.
And thus he not onely proueth, that the Crosse whiche Christ dyed on, but euery other Crosse, yea euery péere of wood formed lyke a Crosse, is to be worshipped, and that with diuine honour.
Although other make a great difference of worship betwéene the Crosse that Chryst died on, and other Crosses.
Cardinal Uigeriu maketh this a principal argume~t, to haue touched the bled of Christ.
And wrote theron, béeing desired of ye College of Cardinals Bishops, at what time as the great Turke for a token of friendship had sent to the Pope (as he telleth) the speare head that wounded Christ, kéeping still the coate of Christ with him in Turkey: Herevpon arose a question among al the Prelats, whether the Coate or the Speare head were more precious, and worthy greater honor.
Uigerius reasoneth muche of Christes shirte, hauing touched his sweate and his of the Nayles that perced his handes: and the other instruments, postes, cordes, roddes; &c. and woulde haue them worshipped more, as they touched him more néere, or more principall partes of Christ.
By which rule he mighte make the stones holy Reliques, that he trode vpon, and why not, since your foresayde prayers confesse, that euen the handes of the Iewes that sote him, and the spettle that they spit on his face are holy Reliques, and to be worshipped with diuine honour also, bicause they touched Christe: if thys kinde of reasoning were good diuinitie.
The Image of Christ is not to be worshipped with the worship of Latria: The Image of the virgin Mary, with the worship of Hyperdulia: the Images of other with the worship of Dulia.
Attributing that worship to the Image of euery thing in his degrée, that you attribute to the thing it self.
And the reason is, as he sayth: Cum stabu coram Imaginibu. &c. VVhen thou standest before the most holy Images of Christ and the virgin Mary, thou oughtest to thinke that there is the blessed Trinitie, and Christ, with Mary, whiche see thee vnder the eyes of the Image, and heare thee vnder the Images eares, and loue thee vnder the Images hearte, and speake with thee vnder the mouth of the Images, not according to the artificiall essence of the Image, but according to the imaginatiue therof, or the diuinitie of the Trinitie, most blessed and present.
And that there is suche a powre in this sighte, hearing, vnderstanding, loue, and so of the other, as the most blessed Mary hath reuealed: that if infinite worldes with all their power shoulde see· thee, heare, loue, vnderstande, and conserue thee: they should not do so much vnto thee, as is done vnto thee by the representing of such an Image, &c. Therfore, before such Images, as beeing ordeyned by the diuine ordinaunce of the Church, and of the holy fathers, and the especiall ordinance of Angels, represent high things beyonde other creatures: thou oughtest to behaue thy selfe with all reuerence, and feare, and al fayth, and loue, euen as if the diuine things represented, were there present.
Neither do ye make them bare representations, but that euen in the Images, the things them selues represented, are.
Yea sayth Alanus: Tota Trinit as beata, per essentia~, praesentiam, potentiam est in a aequaliter, quantum est ex parte deitatis, no~ ex parte operis, &c.
The whole blessed Trinitie is in the Image by essence, by presence, and by power, equally, so farre foorth as in respect of the deitie, not in respect of the worke.
And by such a maner that is, in respect of the deitie, with the Ideaes or formes imagined, the virgin Mary is in such an Image, according to hir whole life, hir nature, hir grace and hir glory, most really, most truely, and most principally, by reason of hir Idea, or imagined forme and diuine part, which is infinitely greater (after Albertus Aug.) tha~ is hir creature it selfe.
Therfore the most mercyful Mary shal alway be present, most really in such an Image, not by bodily presence, but by diuine presence, according to Dionisius and Boëce.
And this is the maner of worshipping the Images of saincts, and of worshipping by signification the Image of the Lord Iesus Christ, which is now whole, euen the selfe same thing in his Image.
Therfore in these Images, thou oughtest to beleue, that the Lady Mary doth there see thee heare thee, loue thee, and prouoke thee to all goodnesse.
Thus say your subtil Scholemen with their ideities; essencies, realities, diuinalities, quiddities, qualities, and such other Sim suttle title tumtatleies: the effect wherof is this, that the Images must haue the same honor, that the things should haue which they represent be Images of.
Wherby not speaking of the manifest idolatrie co~mitted to saincts their images: but only of the image of Christ, to who~ ye say the same honor is due, that is due to Christ him self: But to Christ him self this honor is due, not only alexternall worship of the body; but inuocatio~, faith, trust, hope, ascribing al our help saluatio~, tha~ks giuing. &c. al which ye co~prehend vnder Latria, as due to be re~dred to Christ: the image therfore, besides ye bodily worship, must be inuocated, beléeued, trusted hoped in: al our help, saluatio~, tha~ksgiuing, must be ascribed to ye image of Christ, so wel as to himselfe.
How can ye excuse this, M. Stap. from shamefull idolatrie, euen by your owne distinction.
Was it now any maruel, if the people (that knew not these scholepoynts, were not acquaynted with these distintio~s, but we~t plainly to work, doing al the worship they could deuife, more would they haue done, coulde they haue deuised more:) gaue Duliam, Hyperduliam, Latriam.
all that ye can els inuent to Images: since your Scholemen, euen by the distinctions that they would couer and shift off the matter withal, confesse as grosse idolatrie ought to be done, as the people did co~mit to images? neither did your preachers blame the~, but cite the scholeme~, incite the people, setting the~ more a gogge.
Yea your selues from Louayne sende vs ouer a licence, not to care how much honour is due vnto them, nor curiously to discusse, whether any more may be giuen them than is giuen: when so muche, bothe of the learned vnlearned was giue~, as more though ye would, ye can not deuise to giue, for ye gaue no more but all.
Nowe where we crie out vpon this, as apparant Idolatrie: you crie out agayne vpon vs for heretikes, and liken vs to Iulianus the Apostata, writing agaynst the Christians, for the Crosse of Chryst.
But lyke renegate Apostataes your selues, it is not we, but you that renie, forsake and deface, the vertue, effecte, and merites of his deathe, that dyed vpon the Crosse.
Who offred him selfe a full, propiciatorie, euerlasting, and perfecte sacrifice of redemption, and attonement, once for all our sinnes before or after Baptisme.
And you in his place, offer the Crosse, and other his Images, to be thus worshipped of the ignorant people.
Affirming that, Hoc modo (vt Dominus Iesus reueauit cuidam deuoto) poterit venire in breui ad amorem timorem perfectum coelestium By this meanes (as the Lord Iesus reuealed to a certayne deuoute man) he might in shorte tyme, come to a perfecte loue, and feare of heauenly things.
But in the meane time, the people sticking in visible and earthly thinges, fell without all feare or loue of Gods truthe, euen to a perfection of Idolatrie.
Beléeuing too muche in such faygned reuelations, and reiecting the word of God, wherein Christ hath, not to a certayne deuoute man, but to all the worlde, reuealed the expresse will of his heauenly father, in playne words, forbidding the worshippe of all Images, yea of all creatures, as heathen and wicked Idolatrie.
But ye still crye, that your Images are not Idols, as the heathens Images were, and therefore your worshippe of them is not Idolatrie, as was theirs.
The which thoughe other more at large haue improued, and haue somewhat touched it before, yet bicause at the very instant of the writing hereof, there came to my hands a paper, by a certen friend of youres (whome spare to name) wherein was conteyned (as he affirmed) suche reasons as were vnanswerable, to proue that your Images are nothing like the Heathen Idols.
Although, perusing the same by Doctor Saunders foresayde booke of Images, it séemeth to be drawen from his collections, of the differences betwéene Idols and Images, and so by some other already may be full answered: yet thought it not amisse, euen héere to set it downe, and sée, by this whiche already is spoken, howe easily or hardly it is to be answered vnto.
The differences betweene the Idols of the Gentiles, and our Images, sayth this Papistes paper.
First, some kinde of Idols, had no truthe at all in nature, but were feigned monsters: all our Images haue that essentiall truthe extant in the world, which they represent.
answere: first, for some of their Idols ye say truth.
Secondly, for all your Images ye make a loude lye.
As for ensample, the Image of S. Sunday pictured like a man, with all kinde of about him, as though he had bene Iohn of all craftes.
Wheras, for the béeing of any suche man, there was no suche essentiall truth at all extant in the worlde that it represented.
And yet for your Images this is a generall rule, that you must most firmly beléeue, Quod qualem imaginem vides ad extra oculo corporali, lem Christus habet similitudinem aed infra, secundum esse diuinale Ideale.
That, what maner of Image thou seest outwarde with thy corporal eye, Christ hath the same similitude inwarde, according to his diuine beeing, and conceyued forme.
And the like he sayth of the Uirgin: deò habeatur Imago Mariae virginis pulchra, quoniam turpis Imago (teste Maximo) non est vera Imago Mariae, sed falsa.
Cum ipsa Maria sit totius pulchritudinis, decoris, amoris, regina, domina.
Let a fayre Image be had of the virgin Mary, bicause a foule Image (as Maximus witnesseth) is not the true Image of Mary, but a false Image, sith Mary is the Queene and Lady of fayrenesse, comlynesse and loue.
And M. Saunders concluding this poynt, saythe: For looke what proportion is betweene thing and thing, the same proportion is betweene signe and signe of those things.
By which rule of leueling the Image according to ye essential truth extant in the worlde of the partie represented by the Image: as many other Saincts, yea Christes, and the blessed Uirgins maye be proued Idols, being pictured amisse, and swaruing from their truth represented: so by no meanes can ye defende your consecrate cake, your three faced picture of God the father, your winged and feathered Aungels, your pictures of Saint Sauiour, and Saint Sunday, from being manifest Idols.
And therefore betweene these some Images of yours, and those some Idols of theirs, there is no difference in this first point.
Secondly, all their Idols were without truth concerning fayth and religion: All our Images conteyne such a truth as belongeth to Christes fayth and religion.
answere: No Images belong to the truth of Christes fayth religion.
As for religion, all the religion that Christ ordeyned, was without Images.
Images in diuerse places are forbidden to be worshipped, Custodie vos simulacris.
And they are in no place bidden to be worshipped.
As for fayth, Fides ex auditu, auditus aute~ per verbum dei.
Faith co~meth by hearing, hearing by the worde of God.
But the worship of Images is without the word of god, yea (as is alreadie shewed by your schoolemen) it is but of the Churches ordina~ce: but no faith can be with out Gods worde: the worship then of Images is without the truth of Christs faith religion: so likewise in this
point they differ not from the worship of the heathen Idols.
Thirdly, sacrifice was done to their Idols, not so to oure Images, but onely to God.
answere: first, in that ye made such sacrifice to God, as God neuer ordeyned, and made more dayly renuing of sacrifices to him, not contented with the only sacrifice that he made once for all: therein ye committed plaine Idolatrie, and your massing sacrifice was the Idoll.
Secondly, where ye say, ye made sacrifice onely to God: haue proued alreadie, in plaine confession of your selues, that ye made sacrifice to the blessed virgin also.
Thirdly, that ye say, they made sacrifice to their Idols, so do not you: If sacrifice bée the worship of Latria, then so doe you, by your owne tales.
but what matter maketh this, whe~ ye sacrificed to them, of whome the Images were the pictures: and what differed that from the Heathens doing, that sacrificed to Iupiter, before the Image of Iupiter, or honored him by sacrifice in his Image? whiche thinges you did also, and therefore without any difference héerein, bothe theirs and your Images are Idols.
Fourthly, their Images belonged many times to very wicked men: our Images which we worship, belong alwayes to blessed Saincts.
Not alwayes, M. St. to blessed Saincts, except ye iumble God his Saincts togither.
Yea some of those that ye worship for blessed Saincts, are doubted of your selues to be da~ned spirites: belike they were little better than wicked me~.
But, how blessed saincts some of the~ were who~ ye worshipped, read eue~ your own writer, sir Thomas Mores works of Images pilgrimages, ye shall sée little difference betwéene theirs yours, except yours were the worsse, euen in that simulata sanctitas est duplex iniquita, Their counterfeit sainctship made them double hypocrites.
Fourthly, some of the Gentils professed the~selues to adore the vnsensible wood and stone: we do not professe or teache any such thing, but rather the contrarie.
answere, if some of the Gentiles did teach this among them: many, those that are counted your chiefest scholemen, do euen the same, both professing teaching to adore the very vnsensible wood of the crosse, that with the same honor that ye adore Christe him selfe: and all bicause he dyed thereon, and bicause it was besprent with his bloud.
Neither do you it for the forme sake, as nowe and then ye would shift of the matter (which neuerthelesse, God wot, is but a poore shift, to saue you from Idolatrie, for why should ye worship a figure, more than a substance?) but euen the very wodden peeces, as ye beare vs in hand, of the crosse, ye worship, many other vnsensible substances, nailes, ropes, pillers, thornes. &c.
As for your grosse worshipping of vnsensible wood, stone, mettal, and payntings: none is so vnsensible, that he knoweth it not.
And therfore in this poynt there is no difference: if there be, it is, that your worship was the more vnsensible of the twayne.
Sixthly· other of the Gentiles thoughte a certayne substaunce of God to lye priuie in the Idol: we make our Images onely remembraunces of holy things, and not to contayne any Godhead.
answere: First, that ye make them only remembrances of holy things, is a manyfest vntruthe.
For besides the reme~brances, ye adde worshippings to them: but to reme~ber only a thing, is not withal to worship a thing.
Seco~dly, you lye, in that ye ascribed many helpes to Images, many miracles to be done by them, and that life, bloud, motion, speaking, vertue, pitie, grace, and power was in them, as is alreadie playnely shewed by the ensamples of Discipulus, by the stories of your Legendes, and by the doctrine of your Scholewriters.
All which is farre more, than onely a remembraunce of holy things.
If ye say ye ascribe this, not to the materiall stockes or stones, or to the forme and Image, but to the power and grace of God in them: sith the power and grace of God, is a certayne substance of God: what differeth this also from that ye say of the Gentiles, they thought a certayne substaunce of God to lye priuie therein, and do not you think euen the same? yea, and that the very essentiall Idea of God, and his very Diuinitie and Godhead, lyethand is, wholly, really, principally, and infinitely, and that not so much by his power, but by his grace, and his glory also in Images, as haue shewed ye out of Alanus, citing the Schoolemen for it: and which of the Gentiles went so farre? in this pointe therefore ye agrée with the Heathens Idolles, or rather ye go beyonde them.
Seuenthly, the wisest of the Gentils, adored by the Image of Iuno or of Vulcanus, vnreasonable creatures, as the earth or the fire, and by them certayne Gods who gouerned those Creatures: we adore, by our Images, no vnreasonable creature, but onely blessed soules, and one God their maker.
answere: first, by this your confession, that ye adore blessed soules by Images, and as ye saide before in the fourth point, our ages which we worship· belong alwayes to blesled Saincts, since both ye worship them, and by them worship Sainct: ye proue your seine liers, in saying in your fifte point, we make them onely remembrances of holy things.
And so your points being not truely knitte togither, but tagged with lies, to trausse vp your Images, to make them not séeme Idols? ye worship not onely God and blessed soules, but euen the Diuell, for he is the Father of lies.
Secondly, to that ye say, we adore by our Images no vnreasonable creature: ye are confuted by your adoration of the Crosse, as is before alleaged, vnlesse ye can proue the Crosse to be a reasonable creature.
Which except ye can do, this also is a manifest vutruth, aappeareth by this argument: The crosse ye Christ died on is an vnreasonable creature: But by other Crosses, ye worshipped the Crosse that Christ died on, as Images of it: Ergo, By your Images ye worshipped an vnreasonable creature.
Which is contrary to that ye say, by our Images we worship no vnreasonable creature.
Thirdly, where ye say ye worship only blessed soules and one God their maker: if ye meane by soules, the more principall and the immortall parte of man, as ye séeme to meane, and is commonly taken: then is this an other lie, for ye worship the bodies also of diuerse, yea and sundrie partes of their bodies, armes, sculles, legges, &c. whiche are no soules.
Or how soeuer, for parte or whole, ye take it: ye escape not a lie, bicause, besides your pretended worship of God, and confessed worship of the blessed soules: ye worship Angels also which are neither soules nor God.
Fourthly, to the doing of the Gentiles in this pointe of worshipping certaine Gods, who gouerned those creatures fire or earth· whereby they worshipped them: euen the selfe same thing do you, not only in your reliques, which are vnreasonable Creatures, but for other vnreasonable creatures also that serue to our vse, as fire, earth, seas, prisen, fetters, corne, barrennesse, fruitfulnesse, agues, pestilence, botches, &c. ye gaue to the Saincts a gouernance of the~.
Yea, for cattle, pigges, horses, shéepe, ye ascribed to the Saincts a protection of the~, as your Legende is ful of such patrones for sundrie things.
If ye say, ye called the~ not Gods: haue proued that also, euen by your Legende.
If ye say, ye gaue not them the principal gouernme~t of these things, nor that which they had, they had it not of them selues, but of God, that gaue the~ such a grace gouernance: what say you herein, that eue~ the Heathe~s do not say? that al that the particuler gouerna~ces of their petit Gods, co~meth oue summo, fro~ the great Iupiter, or Primo motore, from the first moouer, and so likewise herein, your Images are not different fro~ ye Heathe~s Idols.
Eightly, The Diuel ruled their Idols, the same Diuels feare our Images which are set vp in a right Faith.
answere: first, this in one sense is truly saide, he feareth those your Images which are set vp in a right faith: but none of your Images, are set vp in a right faith: he feareth therefore none of your Images.
right faith is grounded (as is sayd) on Gods worde: Gods worde· biddes not Images to be set vp to be worshipped: therefore your Images that are set vp to be worshipped, are not set vp in a right Faith.
Secondly, that the Diuell feareth your Images: if ye meane he feareth your Images should be taken away, ye say true.
If ye meane they make him afrayde to see them, or to come nigh them: ye say vntrue, for both he came nigh them, and was in them, and ruled them.
But he feared them as he did Holywater, and as he did feare the great bell in the steple when he satte vppon it.
But these are but childishe bugges to feare the simple people with all.
The birdes berayed them, wormes eate them, the spiders made cobwbs in them, and is the Deuill afrayde of them? the Diuell he is as soone M. Stapl.
Excuse this Idolatrie, that haue shewed was committed to them, and then tell vs he feareth them.
Which, except ye ca~ do, euen as he ruled the Heathe~ Idols: so that he ruled yours, his very practises declared.
He feareth not deceipt, iuggling knackes, craftie co~ueigha~ces, forgeries, feigned miracles: but rather is the ruler of them.
But many of your Images, yea the most famous Images, that could sweat, frowne, smile, nod, moue, goe, speake, &c. were wrought by such craftie legerdemaines: as the vices and deuices of them, haue since bene openly séene, at the pulling downe of the~.
Which argueth that the Diuell feared them not, but ruled them, as he did the Heathens Idols.
Ninthly, The Diuels mainteyned their Idols, the same couet to throw downe our Images.
answere: this is in effect, all one with the other.
VVhom they feare, they hate: whome they hate, they wishe to perish.
But (as is shewed) he feared them not, but delighted in the~.
Ergo, he hated them not, nor coneted to throw them downe, but mainteyneth them, with all his might and mayne, with all his crafte and illusions, and maketh such sturre against the worde of God, and the setters forth thereof, for them: that neither the Priests of Baal made the like against the Prophets, nor Alexander the Coppersmith against Paule, and other Heathen Idolaters against the Christian martyrs: as your Pope, and you his Priests do, against the Gaspel and the Protestants, to mainteyne the worship of your Images.
And to say the truth ye haue greater losse, by the decay of the worship of them, than euer the Coppersmith (which had gaines for making the Images of Diana) had losse by S. Paule for speaking against them.
Infinite was the gaines that came toombling in by your Images.
And all this fat is in the fire, by throwing them downe: If then Images mainteyned such filthie lucre, their maintenance must néedes be of the Diuell.
And God by his worde is the very ouerthrowe of them, as he was before of the Heathen Idols.
Tenthly, to be shorte, their Idols were dedicated by Infidels, to an Heathenish purpose: our Images be dedicated to a verteouse intent.
Therefore our Images being so farre different from the heathenish Idols, are iniuriously called Idols.
answere: First, this common argument of good or verteouse intent, is not sufficient for to make a difference herein.
Especially, the Heathen euen in worshipping their Idols, hauing likewise as good an intent and verteouse, (as téemed vnto them) as your good verteouse intent séemeth vnto you.
They thought they did well, and so do you: this verteouse intent, as it serueth you both, so it serueth all Idolaters.
But you ought to make a distinctio~ of good in déede, good in apparance, els ye are more vnskilfull than the Heathen, that made a difference betwéene, Reuera bonum, that quod videtur bonum, That that is good in deede, and that that seemeth good.
This distinction herein, ought you to haue made: not stande on the intent, which was in the~, as good as yours, as they thought: for they purposed not to do ill, but good, though they did ill and not good.
And why? bicause they did not order their purpose, by Gods purpose, yea by Gods commaundement, not onely in the worship of Images, which he statly forbiddeth, but euen in the worship of God himselfe.
We must not doe that which séemeth good in our owne eyes: but that which God hath commaunded, wée shoulde do, and in no poynt swarue therefrom.
If we doe swarue, the heathens good intent will no more beare vs out, than it did the heathen, no more than it did Saule, or Uza, no more than it shal do those that Christ saith, shall kil the Prophetes of God, and thinke they do God good seruice.
All these are a like in good intent and vertuons purpose, but not in good matter nor vertuous cause.
Wherein, you fayling togither with them, your intent maketh so little difference of your Images, fro~ their Idols, that it maketh them more alike.
And therefore the conclusion, for any of these tenne poynts alleaged, may well be inferred: your Images are not iniuriously called Idols.
Thus much, to answere one of your muttring Libels, that ye scatter among the simple people, whining that we slaunder you with the terme of Idols for Images.
By this little, let them iudge whether we slaunder you or no for Idolaters: and whether they be Idols or no: and howe faint and faigned shiftes ye make to finde out difference betwene their Images and yours.
Wherein also ye would bleare the simple, for who denieth, but that there is a difference of the one from the other? but not such as may make eyther the one or the other no Idoll.
If they were no such Idols, they were as yll, if not worse, but were they not so yll, yet yée proue not them no Idols for all this.
Well, you haue spoken of the difference, and nowe might I, if had not béene ouerlong already, requite your tenne differences, more than with twice tenne likenesses of your Images and theirs, to proue them Idols both.
But you will say, all this is an outroad, neither properly your matter.
Be it so for once, if you will, although in déede it be not, but is directly to your quarrell of Images.
Yet to draw nearer to your charge of Iulianus the Apostata for the Crosse.
If ye affirme that in Iulianus time the Christians worshipped the Crosse: then, as he slaundered those Christians, so doe you slaunder them.
Helene, that ye say founde out the Crosse, worshipped it not.
Epiphanius that saw the picture of Christ in a place proue to be worshipped, rent it in péeces.
Cyrillus that aunswereth this slaunder of Iulianus, obiecting to them that they worshipped the Crosse, doth he graunt that they worshipped it? He sayth no suche thing, he onely mencioneth, how they had it as a memoriall of Christs death, and to moue them to thinke of mortifying themselues.
And where had they it, in their Churches? had they Roodlofts to set it in? set they it on an aultar? had it any sensing to it? créeping, knéeling, capping, crouching, praying, offering to it? if there had bene any such matters, we should by some of your side, haue heard of it ere nowe.
No M. St. there was no such Idolatrie then, as your Romish Church hath nowe, farre passing the Idolatrie euen of the Emperor Iulianus.
He was an open enimie to Christ, for his sake, to his Crosse, to all that was his, but you are priuie enimies and hypocrites, that vnder the pretence of friendship and honour, as it were with Herodes pretensed worship, Iudas kisse, salute Christ his Crosse, rob him of the price that he paid vpon the Crosse, spoyle him of his glorie, bereue him of his people.
Thus do you that pretend such worship of the Crosse.
Which Iudas trecherie and manifest Idolatrie, onely bicause we escrie: you crie out vpon vs, that we be like Iulianus the Apostata, your selues being worse than he.
We remoue these abuses from the wodden Crosse, that Christ himself might be glorified, and we with S. Paule might truly say, Absit mihi gloriari, nisi in cruce domini nostr Iesu Christi, God forbid should glorie, but in the Crosse of our Lord Iesus Christ: that is, in the merits victorie of his death passion, not in ye wood that he was crucified vpo~.
Which notwithstanding we hate not, but we speak against the confidence that you put therin, the worship that ye make therto, the lies and fables that ye forge thereon.
Erasmus saith, the Crosse is so growne among you, hath so many peeces, that if al were put togither, a whole ship would not beare it, yet when Christ suffred it was but one mans burthen.
So iolily haue you multiplied it since, by your lying Arithmetike.
Now, all those péeces, by your doctrines, must haue diuine honour: yea to all your Images, we must not care, how much honor we giue, yet all this notwithstanding, there is no Idolatrie co~mitted, we yt speak against it, are heretiks apostataes, you forsoth are good holy catholiks Ye aske vs next, what we say to the Pelagians, affirming that children not baptised shall be saued.
aunswere, if you had any regarde of your saluation M. St. ye would not still thus wittingly staine your conscience with slaunderous and notorious vntruthes.
We denie not baptisme to infants, either as the Pelagians did, nor at all.
Nor we make it to no purpose as did they, that helde the infants were not borne in sinne: and that original sinne was properly no sin.
But we say with Dauid the infant is conceyued in sinne, and borne in iniquitie.
And that this originall sinne, is both his owne sinne, and verie sinne.
And that he must be regenerate, or else he cannot be saued, and that this regeneration is especially wrought from about by the spirit of God, which Christ adioyneth to the water.
And that the water is the outward signe ordeyned of Christ, as necessarie to seale vp vnto our faithes, Gods spirituall adoption regeneration.
Onely, we denie such absolute necessitie of this outward signe, that god which ordeyned it to be the ordinarie signe, is necessarily tied therevnto, as you Papists affirme.
And there vpon presumptuously determine, that no christian infants can be saued, except they haue the outwarde signe also, and so ye bury them out of the ordinarie buriall of Christians as damned.
This hard and hastie iudgement we reiect and confute, euen with your owne schole Doctours: that make thrée kindes of baptisme, Fluminis, flaminis, sanguinis, Of water, which is ordinarie: of the spirite, as where the ordinarie baptisme by water fayleth: and of bloud, that is to wete, by Martyrdome.
Moreouer baptisme succéedeth circumcision, but the faithfull Iewes, did not iudge their children condemned, that died before the day appoynted for circumcision, but rested in such cases on Gods promise to Abraham.
Vt sim deus tuus seminis tui post te, That might be thy God, and the God of thy seede after thee.
And if he be likewise now our God, that are the spirituall séede of Abraham and true Israelites, is he not also the God of our séede so well as of theirs? whie shall we then measure his grace or mercy (which is both ordinarie, and extraordinarie, and aboue all his workes) by his ordinarie signe? Chiefely when Christ the authour of Baptisme, and into whome by baptisme we bée not onely initiate, but incorporate, testifying that hee whiche beleeueth and is baptised shall be saued: reuersed not his sentence so hardly as you do: He that is not baptised shall bée damned: but, he that beleueth not shall be damned.
So that the apprehension of saluation, is ascribed of Christ to fayth.
Which fayth, the outwarde sign of baptisme sealeth vp vnto vs.
As Saint Paule reasoneth of Abraham, in the fourth to the Romaynes.
Beatus vir cui non imputit. &c. Blessed is the man to whome the Lorde imputeth no sinne.
Came this blessednesse then, vpo~ the circumcised, or vpon the vncircumcised? VVe say verily, how that fayth was reckoned to Abraham for righteousnesse.
Howe was it reckoned in the time of circumcision, or in the time before he was circumcised? not in the time of circumcision, but in the time he was yet vncircumcised.
And he receyued the signe of circumcision, as a seale of righteousnesse, whiche is by fayth, whiche fayth he had yet being vncircumcised, that he should be the father of all them that beleeue, thoughe they bee not circumcised.
And as Saint Paule reasoned thus, and Saint Stephen likewise maketh the same reason agaynst the Iewes, that tyed saluation to the Sacrament of circumcision: so do wée vse the selfe same reason agaynst you, holding the errour of the necessitie of the outwarde signe of baptisme, that the Iewes held of the signe of circumcision, saying that all were damned that were vncircumcised, as you say, all are damned that are not baptised in water.
Thus are you become very Iewes and Phariseys, that vpbrayd to vs that we be Pelagians.
Your Maisters are in this poynt worse than the Pelagians, as well for that some of them haue sayde, that some infants though vnbaptised shall bee damned, and some other though vnbaptised shall be saued.
What meane ye to recken thus by sommes, M. Stap? Were those some worse than the Pelagians, that sayde, some though vnbaptised shall be damned? how much the~ are you worse than they, who say all that be vnbaptised shall be damned? And if you may say all such shall be damned, may not we say some such shall be damned? as though all includeth not some, and so your selues are worse than the Pelagians were.
And trow, it is yet somewhat surer, or at the least lesse daunger, to say some vnbaptised shall be damned, than to affirme it on all.
And do ye thinke, this is so heynous a matter to affirme it on some? pray you, howe say ye by the Turkes, Iewes, and Heathens infants vnbaptised, may we not say it of some of them, if we let ours passe? Now, if this be so sore a saying, belike you holde opinion, that none of their infants though vnbaptised shall bee damned: and if ye do so, whie sounde ye fault with vs before, for saying some vnbaptised shall be saued? If we may neyther say some vnbaptised shall be saued, nor yet some vnbaptised shall be damned, what will ye haue vs say Master Stap? But looke howe your owne sayings hang togither.
All vnbaptised shall bee damned, and yet all vnbaptised shall bee saued.
For what doe ye else say in condemning vs, for saying, some not baptised shal be damned· the contradictorie whereof must néedes be this, all not baptised shall be saued.
And so by your co~tradiction to vs, ye speake flat contraries to your selfe immediatly togither.
As for that you reprehende some of vs, for saying, some vnbaptised shall be damned, and some vnbaptised shall be saued: neither is there betwéene these sayings any repugnancie, both may be true well ynoughe: neither is there anyflashood in either saying.
For, as it is true to say, some vncir cumcised were damned: so is it true to say, some vnbaptised shall be damned.
And as some vncircumcised in the fleshe, were saued: so some vnbaptised in water, shall be saued.
For, circumcision then was that to the~, that baptisme is now to vs.
Thus, as these some, that say either of these sayings or both, of some vnbaptised, said nothing but the euident truth: so your warbling thereat sheweth not onely your falshood, but your enuy to be so spiteful, yt whatsoeuer we say, ye will controll it be it true or false, onely bicause we say it.
Yea although your self say the same, much more to ye same effect.
But howsoeuer ye contrary your self cannot tell what ye say: yet so that ye say somwhat against vs, be it true or false, good or bad, wise or fond, all is wisely, well, and truly sayde.
Thus hath pride sotted your affectio~ on your selues, enuie blinded your iudgement on vs.
And some of them (say you) especially Caluine and other sacramentaries say, that they shall come without baptisme to the Kingdome of heauen, which the Pelagians durst not say, but that they should haue the life euerlasting, putting a difference, but peeuishly, betwixt these two.
In déede it was a very peeuish putting of a difference betwixt comming to the kingdome of heauen, and to euerlasting life, but pray you M. Stap, do not your selfe, and that euen here ful peeuishly, put this self same peeuish difference: ye say, that some of vs say, that infants vnbaptised shall bee saued.
And some of them (say you, as though it were another maner of matter and farre more heynous) specially Caluine and other Sacramentaries say, that they shall come without baptisme to the kingdom of heaue~.
What difference is there betwene these sayings, they shall bee saued, and they shall come to the kingdom of heaue~? Is not this as peeuish a difference, as betwene the co~ming to the kingdome of heauen, the hauing euerlasting life? what differeth either of these fro~ being saued· If ye say, ye make the difference betwene those that be vnbaptised, those that be without baptisme, this is as peeuishe as the other, if not more peeuishe of the twaine.
Now, if there be no difference betwene these sayings, some though vnbaptised shalbe saued, that they shal come without baptisme to the kingdom of heauen: is not this the~ most peeuishly put of you, to say some of them say thus, some of them, especially Caluine and other Sacramentaries (for so ye please to terme vs) say thus? and yet all these sommes, speciall sommes, and other sommes, agrée in one some, without any some or other speciall or not speciall difference at all, sauing in bare wordes.
Doe yée not herein shew your selues as peuishe as the Pelagians? For what did Caluine especially, or the other, in saying they should come to the Kingdome of heauen, more than the other before did say, that they should be saued? But that ye would shew a difference that ye haue of speciall spite to Caluine, more than to any other.
Are ye able to proue this difference, that some shall be saued, not come to the kingdome of heauen· or that any shal come to the kingdom of heauen, not be saued? haue neuer read this difference before M. St.
And therefore it soundeth like a very peeuishe difference in mine eares.
haue heard and read of your peeuish differences, betwene Lymbus patrum, and heauen, but what is that to this difference? for if they shall be saued, they shall come to the kingdome of heauen.
Yea, you tell vs that those that be in your Purgatorie, which besides the continuance ye say, differeth little or nothing from hell, yet say you, they shall all be saued that are there, that is to say, they shall come from thence to the kingdome of heauen.
haue heard likewise on the other part, howe ye say there is a difference betwéene being damned, and being in hell: but God wote a peeuishe difference also, feigned of Plato and Uirgill, and that ye shall finde master Stap. if euer ye come togither.
But God saue the childe as they say, the worst wishe you master Stap. is that ye neuer féele that difference.
But that God in time giue you grace, to repent these your peeuish and fonde striuings agaynst his truth, and malicious slaunderings of his ministers.
And so master Stapleton, ye shall finde no difference betwixt the being saued, and the comming to the kingdome of heauen.
Nowe where ye say, ye will mount higher, to fetche the race of our generation, euen to Simon Magus, to Marcion and Manicheus of whom Luther and Caluine haue learned theyr doctrine agaynst free will.
Ye did well master Stapleton, to mount higher betimes, for if ye had gone but one ynch lower, when ye obiected Pelaganisme to vs for Baptisme, ye had plunged into Pelagianisme your selfe, euen in your free will, as we shall sée when we come thereto.
But no maruaile if your malice maketh you willing and free to slaunder vs, with the opinions of Simon Magus, Marcion, and Manes in fréewill: ye were soddenly mounted vp so high, like a Buzzarde, that your eyes could not discerne the great difference betwene those Heretikes false fables, and the true doctrine of Luther and Caluine thereon.
They ascribed all things to a fatall enforcing necessitie procéeding from diuers good and bad Gods as they sayde.
And looke you to it in the honouring of your Saints as haue shewed, that you make not more Gods that they did, besides your other errours.
And what is this Heresie of theirs, like the godly doctrine taught by Luther Caluin, out of the worde of God, against your frée wil, making your selues as it were Gods with Simo~ Magus, to mount vp to heaue~ at your own free will pleasure? But had ye mounted a litle higher, the~ should ye in déede haue found out, of whom Luther and Caluine learned their doctrine against free will: eue~ of the holy Apostle S. Paule, that confessed he had no such freewill, to do good or ill at his choyse, no not being regenerate.
In respect whereof, he had indéede a wil to do good, according to the inward man: but by reason of the outwardman, this will was hindred, so not free but vnperfect, as he saith of him selfe, enim quod lex, &c.
For we know that the law is spiritual, but am carnal, sold vnder sinne, bicause wot not what do.
For what would do, that do not, but what hate, that do.
If do now that which would not, graunt to the law that it is good.
So then now, it is not that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me.
For know that in me, that is to say, in my flesh, dwelleth no good thing.
To will is present with me, but finde no meanes to performe that which is good.
For do not that good thing, which would: but that euil do I, which would not.
Finally, if do that which would not, then it is not that do it, but sinne that dwelleth in me, doth it.
finde then by the lawe, that when would do good, euill is present with me.
delight in the lawe of God concerning the inwarde man: but finde another lawe in my me~bers, rebelling against the lawe of my minde, and subduing me vnto the law of sinne, which is in my members.
wretched man that am, who shall deliuer me fro~ this bodie of death? thanke God, through Iesus Christ our Lorde.
So then, may selfe in my minde serue the lawe of God, and in my flesh the lawe of sinne.
Lo M. St. this is all the will that S. Paule felt confessed to be in him selfe, while he liued, euen in respecte of the inward man.
If then the will of the Saincts of God be thus hindred by the flesh, that it can not freely will nor worke: what shall we thinke of the will of the fleshly man? forsoth saithe S. Paule, Animalis homo non percipit a quae sunt spiritus Dei, The fleshly man vnderstandeth not those things, that are of the spirite of God, for they are follie to him, neither can he perceyue them, bicause they are examined spiritually.
But what will hath man in that, whereof he hath no perceyuing? Yea, is he not rather altogither vnwilling, to that, which séemeth follie to him? and for this cause, the flesh striueth and rebelleth against the spirite.
He hath therefore no will to any goodnesse at all.
Where are then those Pura naturalia, the pure naturall qualities of inclination, conuersion, and wil in man of himselfe, to moue God with all, that you and your Schoolemen crake so much vppon? The question here, is this, whereas our first parentes before their fall, had in them selues free will to haue sinned, or to haue not sinned, and misusing them selues their free will to sinne, lost them selues and their free will to haue not sinned also: whether, after this corruption of mans nature, it hath yet free will will to good, or not to sinne, as it had before it fell.
To this question, if ye had (as said) mounted so high as the Apostle: he would haue answered you, that we were dead in sinne.
Cum mortui essetis in delictis peccatis: When ye were dead in offences and sinnes: but a dead thing hath no will at all: When therefore we were dead to sinne, we had no will at all to goodnesse.
He would haue answered you that we are not able of our selues, to think any good thought at all: but if we haue a will to any good thing, we must néedes thinke some thought thereon: we are not therefore of our selues sufficient to haue a will to any good thing.
And if we haue any good will, this co~meth not of our selues, but of God: not of old Adam, but of new Adam: it is not a naturall vertue of man, but a supernaturall gifte of god.
Deus est enim qui operaturn vobis velle perficere pro bona voluntate.
It is God that worketh in you both to will to performe it, according to his good will.
If then it be Gods gift, Quid gloriaris quasi non acceperis? why boastest thou (O proud Papist) as though thou receiuedest it not of God, but thou hadst it of thine owne, to moue God as thou saist, Ex congruo ex parte liber arbitij, of congruitie, to deserue heauen for thy workes in consideration of thy free will.
you may sée how S. Paule woulde haue pulled downe, this surmounting pride of yours.
But, had ye soonke by him neuer so frée, and mounted vp to Christ, he would haue tolde you in playne speach, that ye were but thornes, briers, ill trées of your selues, on which no grapes, nor nor any good fruite can be gathered.
That ye were but flesh, and that nothing but fleshe could come of fleshe, and that flesh and bloud reuealeth not Christ.
He would for your frée will, say vnto you, as he said to the craking Phariseis· Uox ex patre Diabolo estis, desideria patris vestr vultis facere.
You are of your father the Diuel, and your will is to do the lusts of your father.
This is all the free will that he ascribeth to man of him selfe.
And if he haue any better will, it is not but of him that saith, Sine me nihil potestis facere, without me ye can do nothing.
We can not do, nor will, ought that good is without him.
Yea we are (before he giue vs a will thereto) so vnwilling, that we are euen drawne thereto, Nemo venit ad me nisi pater meus traxerit em: No man co~meth to me (saith Christ) vnlesse my father draw him.
Omnia traham ad meips, will draw all things to me.
We came not the~ of our own free will if we were drawne to him.
grau~t, our vnwillingnes is changed to an obedient willingnesse, to a frée will also.
We are frée, in respect of deliuerie fro~ ye chaines of darknes bondage of sinne: vs filiu liber auerit vere liberi eris: If the sonne make you free then are ye free in deede: but this is the fréedome of ye spirit, the spirit helpeth our infirmities, which infirmities yet hinder the fréedome of this will, euen in the Saincts of God, as noted in Sainct Paules complaint before.
Yea euen Christ our Sauiour who tooke our infirmities without sinne, in his agonie to his Father sayde, Non sicut ego vol sed sicut vis, Not as will, but as thou wilt, subduing his owne will for our ensample, to his fathers will, and will you wilfull Papistes crake of your free will? But if ye let passe Christ also, as ye vse to do, and fetching a furder race of all mankinds, mounting so highe as Adam the first man of all: you should there haue founde in déede this your frée will.
But there ye should haue séene it lost againe, and in his loines, all our free willes with all, and him selfe and vs also.
Sauing that a second Adam hath founde vs, quickened vs, and made vs free againe, of his free mercie, not of our freewill workes.
So that what we haue now either in will or worke, to do any thing acceptable to his most blessed will and pleasure: the same in déede is in vs, bicause his spirite is in vs, but not of vs, but of him, bringing forth in vs, Uelle perficere, Both to will and to worke, as fruites of his holy spirite within vs.
And if this agrée with the pestiferous Fables and lies of Simon Magus, Marcion, and Manes: then ye haue mounted faire and well.
If not, had ye mounted farre higher than they write Simon Magus did, yea than euer Lucifer did, yet as Simon Magus fell downe and brake his necke, as Lucifer was throwen downe to hell fire: so must you M. Stapleton with shame come downe againe, for feare ye be hurled downe with them.
Now, if as ye rashly mounted vp, ye will orderly come downe, through out all ages, as it were by steppes, ye may descende by this doctrine, euen to your owne time againe.
But pray you M. Stapleton in your comming downe, let Pelagius be your host.
What, ma~, drinke with him at least, one free draught of his erroneous doctrine.
He is a free companion, and will let ye drinke at will, freely, and he hath pleasannt licour well swéetned with pure naturall drugges, and brewed with strong spices of your owne habilitie, perfection, and merites, delectable to the palace of mans selfeloue.
But swéete soppes must haue sowre sawce, they say· This pleasaunt errour, is but a sugred poyson, and as ill on the other parte, as Sno~ Magus fatall necessitie was, if not a great deale worse.
But ye will come neere vs, and touche (ye say) the very foundation and well spring of this your newe Gospell, which altogither is grounded vpon Iustification without good workes.
In that also ye drawe very nighe to the sayde Simon Magus.
Do we drawe nighe him, M. St? God sende grace you draw not with him, and that many of your works, yea euen of your good works, and suche as ye ascribe iustification vnto, be not suche as Simon Magus and his disciples workes were.
We grounde not vpon iustification without good workes, you grounde vpon lyes without good consciences, that thus do slaunder vs. Iustification in déede may well be without your good workes, yea, it can not be with them.
The good workes that God commaundeth, iustification bringeth foorth, and therfore it can not be without them, bicause they be the necessarie fruites of Iustification, we seuer not them therfore from Iustification, but discerne them from the Acte of God in iustifying.
Not to make our selues our owne iustifiers, in whole, or in parte.
We discerne the~ from the causes of our iustification, and ascribe the causes to the loue, fauor, and mercies of God the father, for Christ his sonnes sake, by the sanctification of his holy spirite.
We discerne our workes from the merite and deserte of iustification, muche more from the merite of our saluation, and say, it is onely wrought by his merites, and giuen to vs gratis, freely.
All haue sinned (sayth S. Paule) and wante the glory of God, but they are iustified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Iesu Christ, whom God hath appoynted to be the reconciliatio~, through fayth by his bloud comming betweene.
Which worde freely, is contrary to merite, and excludeth it, as S. Paule reasoneth.
ex gratia iam non ex operibus, alioquin gratia non est gratia.
If it come of grace, then commeth it not of workes, otherwyse grace is not grace.
That is to say, it is not frée fauour, but bound fauour, as deserued or bought As Barnard said, No~ est quo gratia intre, vbi iam meritu~ occupauit.
VVhere merite hath taken vp the rowme, there is no place for grace to enter And so S. Aug Haec est electio gratia. &c.
This is the electio~ of grace, bicause all good merites of man are preuented.
For if it were giuen by any good merites: then were it not giuen free, but rendred as ought.
And by this meanes, it is not by a true name called grace, where reward is.
As the same Apostle sayth, it is not imputed according to grace, but according to duetie, but if that it be true grace, that is to saye, freely giuen, it findeth nought in man, to whom it may be worthily owing.
Infinite are the places that may be cited out of the fathers, and many are by others at large collected in this behalfe: yea, haue shewed you Thomas his iudgement alredy therin, who is the prince of al your scholeme~.
For merite of works therfore in iustification, we are of S. Paules minde.
Arbitramur hominem iustificari fide abs{que} operibus legis: we suppose that man is iustified by fayth without the works of the law.
Thus, in the poynt of iustification, workes are excluded, as he sayde immediately before: VVhere is then thy boasting? it is excluded.
By what lawe, of workes? no, but by the lawe of fayth.
Althoughe our workes are not at all excluded, in respect of the fruites of those that are already iustified.
His workemanshippe, created in Iesu Christ in good workes, which God hath prepared that we shoulde walke in them.
But before this workemanshippe of Iustification, we were but very enimies.
And therefore, as sainct Augustine saith: Quae merita bona tu~c habere poter amus, quando Deum non diligebamus? VVhat good merites could we then haue, when as yet we loued not God? VVithout fayth it is impossible to please God.
Nowe, this fayth, (which lykewise is not of vs, but is the gifte of God) we discerne from workes: bicause it hath relation to the onely mercies of God, promised in Christ vnto vs. Which promises, fayth catching holde vpon, is the only meanes and instrume~t that God hath giuen vs, to receiue the frée offer of his grace, and to applie to vs forgiuenesse of our sinnes.
And so stedfastly beléening the same, we are iustified, by God onely, as the efficient and actiue worker: by Christ onely, as the formall cause, in whome our righteousnesse consisteth: and by faythe onely, as the instrument giuen of God vnto vs, wherby we receiue the same.
Quid enim dicit scriptura? For what sayth the scripture? Abraham beleeued God, and it vvas imputed to hym for righteousnesse.
But to him that worketh, rewarde is not imputed according to grace, but according to duetie.
But vnto him that worketh not, but beleeueth in him that iustifieth the vvycked, his faythe is imputed to righteousnesse, according to the purpose of the grace of God.
And this is that we say, fayth onely iustifieth, that is, fayth is the onely eye that séeth, the onely hande that catcheth holde vpon, the onely meanes whereby we receiue, the onely instrument wherewith we applye to our selues the mercies of God, pardoning our sinnes, by not imputation: The fauour and grace of God, offered in Christe vnto vs, by imputation, of his righteousnesse, workes and merites, and not of ours: but the father accepting his as ours, bicause we are incorporated into him, depend by faith on him, in whom the father is onely well pleased, and this is our Iustification.
Which is so sealed vp in vs, by the spirite of God, sanctifying vs to do all true good workes, that by the shining of them, God is glorified, the fleshe subdued, the spirite quickned, our consciences appeased, our fayth assured, our liues bettred, our fruites yéelded, our duties discharged, our neighbours helped, the godly reioyced, the weake confirmed, the mouthes of the enimies stopped, Gods commaundement obeyed practised, and the workes of the diuell, manyfest euill, or hypocriticall, detected, abandoned, and destroyed.
Not that these thinges be perfectly done, but that we striue to perfection by them: not that we are cleane dead to sinne, as the Monkes boasted, but that we dye dayly, as S· Paule sayth, and still mortifie the olde man.
Not that we fulfill al the law of God, or supererogate more, as the Papistes vaunt, but that fighting continually with Sathan, with the worlde, with fleshe and bloud, all our workes are vnperfect.
Muche lesse, that by our good workes, we satisfie for our ill workes.
But that when we haue all done, we are vnprofitable seruaunts, for any satisfaction.
For howe can any vnperfect goodnesse (which notwithstanding is not ours, and so we can not boast thereon, Si accepisti, quid gloriaris, if thou hast receyued it, why boastest thou?) make satisfaction for perfect wickednesse.
Least of all, that for any worke we can do, or for any trouble we can suffer, that we should merite ye fruitio~ of God, the most perfect thing of all.
Non sunt condignae passiones huius te~poris ad futura~ glria~ quae reuelabitur in nobis.
The afflictio~s of this life are not answerable to the glory to come, that shall be reuealed in vs.
But that all the goodnesse of our good works, all the rewarde of them, is of him, that fréely for Christes sake, accepteth them: and for his sake will crowne them, bicause we be Christes, and Christ is his, and he is all in al in vs.
This is our doctrine of good works, M. Sta. descerning our owne workes from the fruites of the spirite of God, working in those, whome he hath iustified, holynesse and righteousnesse, all the dayes of their life, till tyme glorifie them.
And thus in déede set we foorth the doctrine of iustificatio~ without all workes, be they neuer so good, yea without our selues too, in whom this iustification is wrought.
Co~fessing God to be all in all, and our selues the workmanship of his ha~ds.
And this was the grou~d, the fou~dation, and welspring, not of our new Gospell, as ye terme it, but of the new Testament, and ancient Gospell of Iesus Christ.
Upon which foundation we béeing grounded: farewell al your merites, your supererogatorie more tha~ merites, your masses, your traditions, your ceremonies, reliques, Images, myracles, inuocations, vowes, purgatorie, al this bagge baggage, what soeuer your other not written verities, or rather false forgeries, which (béeing not subiect to Gods righteousnes) ye haue soght before me~, to iustifie yourselues withal.
Thus much, M. St. to the heresies ye charge vs with, for This shall suffice (ye say) at this present, to make open to all the worlde, that they are no secret nor petit heresies, that ye and your fellowes mainteyne.
What we mainteine, M. St. is in déede not secret hyd, (as your mysteries secret conspiracies are) but as Christ saide of his doctrine, is dayly taught openly in the temple, is proclaymed on the house toppe, the corner stone is not caste aside in a hole of our builders, but is made the head stone of the buylding.
The people maye sée it, and sée by it (as thankes be to God they do more and more full sore agaynst your willes) neither al the puffes of your counterblast can blow the light of this holy candle out.
In déede suche as was layde to S. Paules charge, is this heresie of ours.
It is soone sayde, to call it heresie, as ye haue done al this while, but it would cumber you to proue it heresie, as yet ye haue not done.
Ye haue héere layde many things vnto vs, where either we defende not any suche thing at all, nor any suche like thing.
And your selues for the moste parte defende them, or the like, or else a contrarie as ill or worsse.
As for such doctrine as we in déede defende, except your slaunderous rayling, ye haue brought not one worde agaynst it, to proue any one heresie or errour, aperte or priuie.
Neuerthelesse, bicause of your instant crying, and importune craking, haue answered a great deale further, than either the principal issue about ye princes supremacie, or the volume could well suffer, or than minded or néeded to haue done.
For, to say truth, ye haue not, nor ye can, obiect any thing, that your masters haue not obiected before, and is not answered already by others, chiefly by that Reuerende father in Christ, the Byshop of Sarisburie, whome you so often snatche and snurre at, and not you alone, but al the packe of you, as at him whome God hath raysed vp, as a singuler Iuell and instrument to open confute all your falshoods.
Yet since your impudencie is so extreme, still to crie out vpon vs, as though nothing were done or speke~ in the matter, saying: Come foorth once, and cleare your selfe of this onely obiection, if you can, beeing so often pressed therwith.
If you maynteine olde condemned heresies, what are ye lesse than heretikes them selues? if you maynteyne them not, or if they be not heresies that you maynteyne, cleare your selfe if you be able.
assure you master Horne, you and all your fellowes will neuer bee able to auoyde this one onely obiection. &c.
Since ye thus still crie and call vpon vs, as though non had answered to these obiectio~s, haue therfore thus much at your earnest entreatie, digressed thus farre from the principall question, to satisfie, if playne truthe (for Rhethorike leaue to you and other) may satisfie your importunitie: and fedde withal your vayne humor, that where ye haue made and translated many braue bookes, to the which your margine oftentimes sendeth vs, to put vs in remembraunce what a ioly writer you be, and thinke you muste néedes be answered, or else al is marred, and then ye might say with the Soluters dawe, oleum operam perdidi, haue loste all my cost and labour, if no man should regarde my workes: ye still crie out therefore to be answered, and bidde vs come foorth and we dare, as though it were Golias: and yet any one poore séelie stone of our Dauids bagge, will make you, M. Stap. so tottle vp your héeles, that we may safely cutte off your head, the Pope, euen with your owne weapon, for all these your cries and crakes.
But like a lustie champion, as though ye had made a sufficient conquest, ye say ye wil forbeare at this time to speake of the residue of our noble progenitours.
Coragiously sayde, M. St. when ye haue done the worste ye can, and spit out all your poyson, then tell vs ye wil forbeare vs. Wel then, at the length, tha~ks be to God, ye haue done with our ancestors, as ye cal the~: haue ben answered as ye haue heard.
Now let others in gods name iudge of vs both, as they shal find ye falshood or veritie of these matters.
May it nowe please you (M. Sta.) to giue me leaue a while to runne at rando~ the same race that you haue done, and to vse your owne words: Good sir may it please you, fauorably to heare your and your masters honorable pedegree, and of their worthy feates and prowesse.
First, what say you to the Phariseis, that seuered them selues from all the people in their strange apparell, in their fastings, prayers, and other poynts of hypocrisie, described out by Christ, in so much that they preferred them selues aboue al men, so were counted, as in who~ religion did only or most consist: so like in euery poynt to your Monkes and Friers, deuided fro~ other men by their rules profession, and estéemed called onely or chiefly religious men? VVhat say ye agayne to the Phariseis, that kept the key of knowledge among them selues, and would neither them selues enter in, nor suffer other to enter, but rather be blind guides and leaders of the blinde: so like to your Prelates and you pretending to be the pastors of the people, and kéepers of the worde of God, but so to kéepe it, that not only ye kept the people from it, but for the most part your Priests were ignoraunt of it, and blinder guides of the blinde then euer the Phariseis were.
VVhat say ye agayne to the Phariseis, that brought traditions into the Church, besides the worde of God, and transgressed the worde of God for their traditions sake? Wherin, for one tradition of the Phariseis so brought in: the Papistes haue brought in a score at the least, and if shoulde say, an hundreth, spake within my bounds.
VVhat say ye to the same Phariseis, that defended a ma~ might do all that the law commaundeth, and obteine iustification, and heauen therby? But héere the Papistes go beyonde them, that say, we not onely may do all, but more than all that euer God commaunded, workes of counsel, of voluntarie, of supererogatio~, like to the Foxe, with more than a thousand wiles, in co~parison of the poore catte: but the Phariseis herein were nothing stored like the Papists.
What say ye to the Saduces, that sayde: we haue powre frée will to do good or badde? What say ye to the Esseni, that liued in woods and solitary places, and eate onely rootes and herbes, counting all righteousnesse to consist in streight rules of life: although herein, you be but counterfeits to them, and do them iniuiurie in this comparison to you, whose Friers, Monkes, Heremites, and Anachores, were nothing comparable but méere Pharisaicall hypocrites.
What say ye euen to Simon Magus your selfe, with whom you charge vs? that first began to mingle the Iewish and heathen ceremonies with Christianitie.
What say ye agayne to Simon Magus, that would haue made sales of the giftes of the holy ghost, as the Pope maketh sale of his Indulgences graces? What say ye agayn to Simon Magus, that came to Rome, and there was honored as God? as the Pope not like Gods viar, as he pretende, but like God him self, is there honored, and claimeth here in earth to haue the power of God, according as Simon Magus named him selfe the power of God.
What say ye once againe to Simon Magus and all his ofspring that mainteyned filthie fornication, as the Pope doth stewes, courteianes and Concubines? What say ye to the Heretikes called Sethiani? Of whome saith S. Augustine, Multa de principatibu potestatibus vanssima
They faigne many moste vaine thinges of principalities and powers: according as do your fabling bookes, of the celestiall Hierarchies, in the name of Dinisius and other like.
What say ye to the Carpocratians? that to mainteine their wicked liues false opinions, did say that Iesus taught those things to his Disciples and Apostles aparte from his written worde, and deliuered them by tradition to be kept: as the Pope and all the Papistes say for defence of traditions and vnwritten verities (as they call them) besides the written worde of Christ.
What say ye to the Cainites that made inuocation vnto Angels? but the Papistes made inucation not only to Angels, but to dead men and women also, yea and to thinges vnsensible.
What say ye to the Theodotians? that would take from and put to the worde of God, and that they had authoritie to correct thse things that were not well, and saide they were therein wiser than the holy Ghost: as do the Papists adde to the worde of God their traditions, and suppresse and iminish the authoritie of Gods worde, saying, their Church is of greater authoritie by them, and they haue furder knowledge of Gods spirite than is contined in the written worde of God.
What say ye to the Basilidians, that to their Disciples commaunded ue yéeres silence: as your Monkes, Friers, Heremites, Anahores, &c. enioyned to their nouices silence at certaine times, and did all by beckes and noddes, and if a worde were spoken, all their perfection were marde.
What say ye moreouer to the Basilidians? that painted and carued the Image of Christ and worshipped it.
As haue shewed the Papists did, what kinde of worship socuer ye would excuse the matter withall.
What say ye to the Cerdoniaus? that reiected the ensamples of the old Testament: as you M. St. and M. Dorman in this controuersie of supremacie do.
What say you to Montanus? that first appointed lawes of fasting, which before were frée, as is shewed already in the Article thereon.
That said the holy Ghost taught him more, and better, greater things than Christ taught in the Gospell: as your Papistes say for their vnwritten verities and workes of supererogation.
Ascribing a greater perfection to such voluntarie workes, than to the workes expressed and commaunded in the worde of God.
What say ye againe to the Montanistes? that abrogated the authoritie of Gods wrde: as haue shewed ye in Pigghius and Alphonsus that the Papistes do.
What say ye againe to the Montanistes? that boasted much of mysteries, but nothing so many nor so mystie, as the Papists were.
That said to accuse and condemne themselues to be sinners, was to sclaunder them selues, as the Papists that can not abide the Letanie, for saying so often, Lorde haue mercy vppon vs miserable sinners, and for saying Amen to the curses recited against the wicked.
Besides that haue shewed alreadie, how they iustifie them selues with puritie of nature, with fréewill, with preparatiue workes, meritorious, more than mritorious, workes of perfectio~, What say ye to the same Montanistes? that vnder the pretence of offerings craftely gathered and extorted of the people great summes of monie.
But not the hundreth parte that the popish Priests offrings brought in.
What say ye againe to the Montanistes? with whom the Prophicie of Priscilla and aximilla were in greater honour, than the holy Gospels of Iesus Christe: as likewise the blinde Prophecies of the Papistes, to the which they giue more credite, than to the true Prophets, that haue set forth Gods worde.
What say ye once againe to Montanus? that taught the dissoluing contemning of Matrimnie for religio~ sake: in all which thing how nere your Papists follow Montanus steppes, is very apparant to the easie conferrer.
What say ye to the Tessarescedecatitae? which vsed and alleaged forged bookes in the Apostles names, called Apocrypha: as the Papistes make Canonicall the bookes so called, besides that they alleage and set out their S. Thomas gospell.
The fables of Lazarn, the birth, life, death, and assumption of the blessed virgin, and many such other counterfaite bookes, to establishe their Masse, Purgatorie, Reliques, Traditions, and other such errours by them.
What say you to the Seueriani of Seuerus? that saide a wench called Phlumene was enspired with the holy ghost to foretel things to come, to whom declaring his dreames burnings of his minde, she would warne him secretly as it were of things to come, and that she should sée phantasies come vnto hir in the likenesse of a childe, which childe appering would now and then say he were Christ, now and then S. Paule, that the spirite told hir such things as she told the people, that she wrought such miracles, of which this was the chiefe: that she woulde put a great loafe into a glasse hauing a narrow mouth, and with the tippe of hir fingars take it out againe vnbroake~, that she eate nothing els but that, as sent hir from God.
Compare these things with the Popish practises in their visions, trances, and miracles of their she incts.
S. Bridgits Reuelations, the trances of the holy mayde in Kente, the Pell of Fraunce, the she saint that Sir Thomas More telleth of in his booke of Pilgrimages, and sée how much they differ.
What say you to the Taciani? that would admitte none into their rules and orders, were they men or women, that renounced not Mariage: as none may be admitted to the Popish orders or rules of their religions, that haue not vowed not to marie.
What say you to the Alogiani, that as is saide before stood vppon vnwritten verities, and reiected the written worde of God? What say ye to the Angelici, that bowed them selues downe in the worship of Angels? What say ye to the Apostolici which most arrogantly called them selues by this name (as do your Popes call the~ selues Apostolicall) and they receiue not into their communion, those that vse wiues (as your Papistes will admitte no married Priests to consecrate at their Masse) nor they receiued any that professe any proprietie of their goods (as your Monkes and Friers do ptende) of whome saith S. Augustine, Quales habet Ecclesia Monachos Clericos plurimos: Such as the Church hath many Mo~kes Clerkes, No meruayle then if your Monkes and Priests do so now, for the Heresie of your Apostolical (as ye cal it, but in déede apostaticall Church herein) is of faire antiquitie.
What say you to the Manichaei, with whom ere while ye falsely charged vs? They forbid (as S. Augustine saithe) mariage, so much as in them lieth.
They saide, that by chastitie, Prayers and Psalmes, they purged their liues sent them to heauen.
They craked of false Abstine~cie and Continencie to deceyue the simple.
They boasted that they forsooke all things for God, and did arrogate to them selues all the blessings mencioned in the Gospell.
They added and tooke from the Scriptures so much as they pleased, pretending they had bene or might be corrupted, and preferred the bookes called Apocrypha.
They said the promise of Iesus Christ, concerning the holy ghost the comforter, was fulfilled in their Archmanichée: as the Papists besides all the other aforesayde, say the same promise of the holy ghost, is fulfilled in their Arch prelate the Pope.
And as Manicheus called himselfe the Apostle of Iesu Christ, so your Pope in his Bulles prefixeth the authoritie Apostolicall of Peter and Paule.
Moreouer they reiected flesh, egges and milke, which the Papists on certaine dayes, they reiected also the proprietie of goodes, as due the begging Friers.
What say ye to the Hierachitae, that likewise as these would receyue none into their societie but vnmaried men and women? Such were also your Aerians, whome falsly you obiect to vs, being more like to them your selues, admitting none but suche as were continent, as renounced the worlde, and would possesse nothing of their owne.
What say ye to the Psalliani and Euchitae? that were all giuen to mumbling vp of prayers, and sayde that Monkes ought not to labour to get their liuing, and therefore they professed themselues to be Monkes, bicause they woulde do no worke but pray.
Whom Erasmus in his defence against the Sorbonists, being appeached onely for saying, Christu in orando damnat multiloquum.
Christ doth condemne much babling in prayer) likeneth the Papists vnto: Deni{que} Psalliani siue Euchitae. &c.
To conclude, the Psalliani or Euchitae haue augmented the beadroll of Heretikes, who lyuing in idlenesse, dispatched vp an heape of psalmes, with a marueylous rolling of the tongue.
What say ye to the Pattalorinchitae? which did so giue themselues to silence, that at suche times as they thought they must holde their peace, they would lay their fingers on their nose and lippes, least they should speak a worde: as noted before of the Basilidians, both whome herein your religious men resembled.
What say ye to the Aquarij, which mingled water with wine in the Sacrament, as all the Papist do? What say you to the barefoote Heretikes, that walked vp and downe barefoote, and woulde weare no shooes, like the barefoote Friers.
What say you to the Priscillianists? that had this rule among them, Iura periura secretum prodere nol. Sweare and forsweare, bewray not the secrete: not onely like the dissembling Papistes practise among vs, that will sweare and forsweare themselues to the Prince with false hollow heartes in truth· and yet in falshood trustie to their confederates, nor will bewray their secrete conspiracies: but also like the rule of your Pope, and all his perfect faythfull ones, Nulla ides tenenda Haereticis.
No fayth must be kept to Heretikes, as ye call vs.
But syth ye protest to be so vnfaythfull, you might call them fooles to, that would beléeue, either any open or dissembling Papist.
What say ye againe to the Priscillianists? that say men are tyed to the destinie of the starres, and that our bodie is composed, according to the twelue Signes of heauen, placing (as those doe that are called the Mathematikes) a Ram to rule the heade, a Bull in the necke, Twinnes in the shoulders, a Crabbe in the breast: and so running throughe the other Signes by name, they discende vnto the soales of the feete, which they allotte to Fishes, which of the Astrologians is called the last signe.
Vppon these and such other fabulous, vayne, and sacrilegious thinges, which were to long to prosecute is this Heresie compounded.
Nowe if this be so heynous an Heresie, as Saint Augustine maketh it, all your Popishe Churche are infected with it.
And woulde wishe all good Christians to beware, howe farre they beléeue the blinde Prophecies of many Almanackes, that fill the Papistes braynes with hopes and murmurings, and feare the sielie people wyth doubtfull expectations.
All which by Saint Augustines iudgement is but Heresies, But God graunt say I, it tende to nothing else.
What say to the Acephali? that sayde women may be shée Deacons (such as were your Nonnes.)
What say ye againe to the Priscillianistes? that those whome they coulde perswade to their sect, they parted the man from his wife, agaynst the wiues will: and parted the wife from the husbande, agaynst the husbandes will.
And that although they refused not the canonicall scripture, yet they ioyned there with the Bookes called Apocrypha, counting them likewise of authoritie: and in the canonicall scriptures whatsoeuer ouerturneth their errour, they turne it into allegoricall senses.
What say ye to the Messaliani, with whom ye burthen vs? but howe neare your selues drawe to them, appeareth in that they spent their life in Monkishe ydle praying, sléeping and eating: not so like the foresayde Euchitae, as lyke the Papists.
They craked that they sawe reuelations, and fled from all handie craftes and labour, and buylded themselues Celles and Oratories, and Euening and Morning with many lights and Caudles burning gathered togither, and deceyued themselues with long praiers, told straunge fables of purging of soules.
Epiphanius confuting them, imputeth all this to a fonde and naughtie zeale, wherewith they were so blinded, that they durst attempt such thinges contrarie to the holy Scripture.
This Heresie so encreased in euerie place, that the fathers had much a doo to oote them oute, yea diuerse Monasteries were faine to bée burned vp, that were infected herewith.
And yet all the Popishe Abbeys, had euen the selfe same lubberly deuotion, and all the other errours, superstitions, and fables, if not an infinite number of worse, and therefore no maruayle if God haue rooted vp, and do most iustly destroy the dennes of such auncient and so pernicious Heretikes.
In this point notwithstanding the Papists are contrary to the Messalians: who sayde, there are manie Gods, and yet doe worship but one GOD almightie.
But the Papistes will say, there is but one GOD almightie, and yet giue such worship, as is onely due to him, to many besides.
Of which contraries, it is hard to iudge, which barrell is better herring.
What say ye to the Aëtians? that sayd, for a man to lie with a woman without matrimonie, was no more a sinne, than to picke his eare, so that he were of their religion: and doth your Pope make much more of the matter? so that ye be a Catholike, and pay a fee for a whore, whiche is yet somewhat more than to picke his eare, for by such filthie gaynes the Pope did picke their purses.
What say you to the Theophroniani? that trauayled chiefly in Aristotles Categories, interpretation of wordes and propositions, in subtile and absurde disputations, in curious scanning of names and wordes in the scripture: like for all the worlde to your Thomists, Scotists, Dcamists, Sorbonists, and all the sects of schoolemen, making of Aristotles Philosophie, good diuinitie: being altogither occupied in curious and subtile quiddities.
What say ye to the Aërians your selues, with whome ye charged vs so fast? that as the other abouesayd Heretikes, admitted none to their communion, but such as were continent, without wiues, and forsooke the worlde, and had no proprietie of their goodes: as all your Cloysterers pretended.
What say ye to the Colliridiani? or Ladies Chaplaynes (as ye terme your Priestes) that worshipped and offred sacrifice vnto hir: as the Papists doing the same or more, is shewed sufficiently.
What say ye to the Anthropomorphitae, that helde, that God had forme and partes like a man? if ye say you beleus not so, whie then doe you (contrarie to your beliefe) picture out God in such a fashion? and so by your owne rules, the figure not béeing like the truth, it implieth an Idoll as is confessed.
Yea, are ye not like herein to those Heretikes, that S. Augustine noteth to make triformem deum, a threeformed God? whereby if those Monkes were by ignorance deceyued, how much more were many thousands deceyued by such pictures, taking God in déede to be euen such an one, as he was portrayed out in the Image, Ye haue called vs Pelagians, and worse then Pelagians.
But do ye not say we are worse bicause you like them well ynough, but for the name sake onely? Else, what say you to the Pelagians errours? The Pelagians helde for originall sinne, that it can not be sinne, that is in infants, for bicause infants want will: but sinne cannot be where will doth want: Ergo, it is no sinne.
And is not this the Papists saying Uoluntas est sedes pecc: VVill is the feate of sinne: but infants haue not will, nor liberum voluntatis arbitrium: The ree arbitrement of will: infants therefore haue no sinne.
For it cannot haue the nature of sinne that wanteth these.
The Pelagians sayd, that sinne can not infect, corrupt, chaunge, nor be in the nature and substance of man.
And is not this the very selfe same saying of Pigghius? As for frée will, did not the Pelagians say, that if there remaine by nature no free will in man· then all exhortation, preaching, and the law of God is commaunded in vaine? And that the taking away of freewill, taketh away the studie and care of Godly life? And doth not Pigghius say euen the same, that we are not, nor can bee bounde to any lawe of God, to keepe the commaundements, where we haue not facultie, freewill, and might, to satisfie and fulfill those things that are commaunded: and that this doctrine of grace, destroyeth all good woorkes, as taking awaye free election and will? Did not the Pelagians say that the law of God is easie to be fulfilled, and all the commaundements of God are possible to be kept? And do not all Papistes defende the selfe same doctrine, yea and say they can do more? As for grace, the Pelagians graunted a first grace of God in our creation, euen before any merits, likewise, a seconde grace of preaching, whereby God sendeth his worde vnto vs, and either of these come without any merit or occasion in vs.
But the third grace of God, to heare his worde, beleeue, and follow it, is preuented by our owne preparatiues, dispositions, of seeking, asking, and knocking, and not to resist grace when it commeth, is in our selues, in our owne nature from the creatio~ of vs: and doth not Alpho~sus say ye same, although many Papists be farre worse, say that the first grace all, commeth Propter praeuisa opera, For works that God foresaw? Of predestination, the Pelagians say, that the number of the elect, may be encreased or diminished, and that God hath no determinate number.
That God hath predestinate them, that he foresaw should deserue it, by their workes.
That the predestinate can be, or can not be saued: and leese or keepe at their voluntarie, the graces of God giuen vnto them.
And that the doctrine of predestination is not profitable to bee preached.
And what poynt is there of all these, that the Papists do not openly defende.
The Pelagians sayde of iustification, that althe Prophets, Apostles and Saincts of the old and new Testament were saued for their vertuous life.
The Pelagians sayde of sayth, if thou beleuest thou shalt be saued, the one of these twaine is commaunded, the other is offred.
That which is commaunded is in mans power, that which is offred is in the power of God.
haue sayd, that a man can be without sinne, if he will, not as some men slaunder me, without the grace of God, the whiche so muche as to thinke is very sacrilege, but simplie, that hee can if hee will, so that wee vnderstande it with the grace of God.
And this affirme, he that can one day abstaine from sinne, he can abstaine also another day.
And hee that can abstaine two dayes, can abstaine three dayes.
And he that can three, can thirtie, and so by order can abstaine three hundreth, and three thousande when he will.
All this sayde Pelagius, and do not the Papistes likewise say, that it lyeth in theyr frée will to abstayne or not abstayne, ioyning with their will the grace of GOD to helpe them? And althoughe you confesse (as ye cannot choose) that euerie man is a sinner: yet for mortall or deadely sinne, you say: that euerie man can liue cleane without doing any deadly sinne all his life long, and that to holde the contrary is an errour and an Heresie.
Where likewise ye falsely obiect vnto vs, the saying of the Messalians, for that we say concupiscence is sinne after baptisme: The affirming that concupiscence is no sinne, is the very saying of the Pelagian, that reasoned thus as Pigghius doth, concupiscence is naturall, Ergo, it is no sinne.
In all these poynts, besides many other, what say you (M. St.) to the Pelagians? But trust you will say no hurt vnto the~, that are your elde friends and alies.
omit the Donatists; and their bandes, till your selfe come vnto them.
What say you to the Eutichians? that said the humanitie of Christ glorified, by reason of the personall union had also the properties of the diuinity, to be in infinit places at once, to haue no lineament, part, quantitie, forme, or circumscription.
Which heresie no simple nor smal heresie, Theodoretus calleth the defe~der of it: Eranistes or Polymorphus as though it were made of sundry coloured patches, like a beggars cloake, an Heresie botched vp of all Heresies togither.
And what say ye to your doctrine of transsubstantiation, if it be euen this Heretikes doctrine, his principall argument to mainteyne the Entichians heresie withall: and the co~trary (by taking away of tra~substantiation) be the true Catholikes doctrine, to defend the veritie of Christs bodie agaynst the Eutichians heresie· in proufe hereof, what say ye to ye heretik Cranistes his argume~t, reasoning thus? Eue~ as therfore the signes of the bodie the bloud, are other things in deed (that is to wit the norishme~t of the sedes, bread wine) before the Priests inuocation: but after the inuocation, they are chaunged and are made other things, (that is to wte, the bodie and bloud of Christ it selfe:) euen so the bodie of the Lord after the assumption, is chau~ged into a diuine substance.
Thus sayth this beggerly patched Heretike to defende this heresie.
But what replieth the true catholike to him again? Thou art taken (sayth he) with the nettes that thou hast knit thy selfe, for, as for the mysticall signes, they go not from their nature, after the sanctification, for they remaine in the same substance, figure, and forme, and can be seene and felt, euen as they could before the sanctification.
This was then the Catholikes doctrine agaynst all transubstantiation, as the very argument and piller for the Heretike, to mainteyne all his diuerse coloured patches of Heresies withall.
VVhat say you nowe master Stapleton, to all this crewe of Heretikes? Is not here a fayre pedegree of you and your Masters honourable progenitors? And yet there are many mo behinde, that (as ye call for them hereafter) will come forth also, and shewe their faces: In the meane season, to borrow your owne wordes, till pay you againe, If you, Master Stapleton, mainteyne olde condemned Heresies, what are ye lesse than Heretikes your selues? And what is the doctrine of Poperie, but a misshapen lumpe of sowre dough, leauened and hotchpotched vp togither, of a number of olde condemned Heresies? a good and catholike doctrine warrant you, Master Stapleton.
Nowe (say you comming to your fift part) as haue proued you and your companions open and notable Heretikes, so shall straight way purge M. Feck. to be no Donatist.
As ye haue proued the one, so you will purge the other: but ye haue not hitherto proued the one, nor any one iote of it, nor haue alleaged any thing but slaunders, and your bare sayings, after your acing maner without any proues at all.
Neuerthelesse, let vs sée, how ye will purge the other.
But now M. Hoe (say you) beware your selfe, least this iniuste accusation against M. Feckenham and the Catholikes, whom ye co~pare to the Donatistes causelesse, most iustly and truly redownde vppon you and your fellowes heddes.
Is this (M. Stapleton) his purgation to charge another? yet if your vaine so serueth you, that ye will néedes charge vs, it had bene your dutie, first to haue cléered him, and then to haue charged vs.
But go to, we must follow still your peruerse order, especially ith ye giu so faire a warning piece, saying: Beware say, for suppose, will laye more pregnant matter in this behalfe, to your and their charge, than ye haue or possibly can do, to M. Feckenham or any other Catholike, whereof dare make any indifferent reader Iudge.
True indéede (M. Stapl.) without supposall, ye hue an head as it were a counting house, full of pregnant matter, such as these your and crakes, with other your common places of sclaunderouse raylingare: wherein ye excell all your com, wherein for my parte will not contende with you, but onely sette it that (as ye say) euery indifferent reader, whom you dare make your Iudge, may beholde, Iudge, and cod, your pregnancie therein.
And if ye haue any pregnant matter charge vs, as ye vaunt, it shall suffi me aftr my hy manner, (not contending who hath more pregnant matter, wherein ye graunt ye may be charged by vs, in some pregnant matter,) to discharge our selues of the charge if we can, and againe if we can also, to returne the charge on your neckes, or els let it stande for me indifferent, to whome the readers indifferent iudgement shall awarde it, whether you haue more pregnant matter to charge vs, or we haue more and more true matters to recharge you, and discharge our selues, in this heresie of the Donatistes.
They were all (ye say) called first Donatistes, but as they first fell from the Church Catholike, so fell they afterwarde from their own Church and maister, into an horrible diuision of the Maximianists, Circumcellions, Rogatists, Circenses others.
liuely paterne of the sectes sprong from your Apostle Luther, as in their pedegree in the Apologie of Staphilus, euery man may see.
Euery man may see M. St. that he is a good cocksre witnesse of your side, and therefore it is pregnantly done of you to sende vs to him, but sauing your reuerence M. Stapleton haue heard say ere this, that two false harlots neede no broker.
Your argument is vicious diuerse waies, but chiefly it standeth of your common fallacion, non causa vt causa: so doth the most of this your pregnant matter.
For els, by the like argument, yè might make another liuely paterne, from Christes own wordes: Necesse est vt Scandala veniant, It is necessarie that offences come.
And Christ him selfe (as Simeon saide of him) is, Positus multis in ruina, Placed to many to their ruine.
And so he calleth him selfe a stombling stone: and his ghospell (as saith S. Paule) is to the Iewes an offence, and follie to the Gentiles.
What a number of Heresies sprang vp, euen in the Apostles time, through false Apostles? of whom saith S. Ihon, They went out from vs, but of vs they were not.
Doth not S. Augustine (describing the Church of Christ) confesse, Hreses de illa exirunt tanquam sarmenta inutilia de vitè precisa, ipsa autem manet in radice sua.
All Heresies went out of the Church as vnprofitable boughs cut of from the vine, but it selfe remayneth still in the roote thereof.
Ye should discerne betwene the sower of the wheate, and the sower of the darnell, M. St. and then your argument were aunswered.
Although it be also a sclanderous lie, to Father those sectes on the gospell, or from Luther, that are rather deriued from Popish errours, with which they more agrée, as sprong out of suche superstitions and ignorance, as you had noseled them withall.
But if ye will fetch, in this point, an argument from the how forgatte you the plentifull sectes of your false Friers? all sprange first from Francis and Dominike, but what swarmes full, not of the Friers onely, who as Chaer telleth came driuinge like bées out of Sathanas tayle, but of the diuerse sectes of them, that haue sproug out since, the one no more like the other then an Apple is like an Oyster, and all agreing togither like catt in a tter.
Ye might haue tolde vs of Peter Lombarde, of Thomas, of Scotus, &c.
And of the sectes sprong out of their loynes, deuided so bitterly among them selues, with great and artakinges, and that in no small pointe of ye might haue made a fitter comparisn to the
Suche pregnant a your first charge is, such is your second charge.
The Donatistes (say you) would sometime crake bragge of their multitude, and bring it as an argument that the truth was on their side, as doth your Apologie· which being restrained by the Emperours lawes, and dayly diminishing· the~ they cried, the truth resteth with the few elected and chosen persons, then cried they, little flocke feare not, as ye did, when ye were as yet but in corners, rotten barnes, and luskie lanes.
If these be good arguments (M. Stapl·) to prue a Donatist, to crake and bragge of multitude, to bring it as an argument that the truth is on their side: then are all Papistes Donatistes and we For it is your crake, almost your onely vau~t, of of greatest multitudes of people: asking vs in co~tempt where our Church was, when for the most parte (ye saide) all is urs, as the Diuell saide when he looked in at the as telleth the olde by worde.
And if nowe it hath Go, by the preaching of his lessed· word he proed) after generall defection, so to detect the man of sinne, and to chaine vp Satha~, that he should not so much dectine the world, but that we may and erace the glad and true tidinges of our saluation: we do not crake nor bragge thereof.
Reioyse in the Lord we may, praysing God, that he hath reuealed these things to the simple: and to lifte vp our heads Christ biddeth vs, when the haruest waxeth ripe and great, praying him to sende more workemen into his haruest, to reape the sheane with ioy, the seede whereof we sowed before in teares.
As for craking of multitudes, it is proper to your Churche M. St. we make no argument to or fro thereon.
And if on the other parte, in the time of persecution, whe~ iniquitie had the vpper hand, we comforted our selues with this consolation of Christ, Feare not little flocke, and the truth resteth with the fee eleed and chosen persons: If ye scoffe at these wordes, and hevpon inferre vs to be Donatistes, bicause they saide the same: by this argument, ye wil oue the author of them Iesus Christ him self to be a Donatist to.
Only, ye should haue proued, that we applied them falsely as the Donatistes did, or elsye proue nothing.
Ye say we crid thus when we were as yet but in corners, rotten barnes, lusky lanes.
Were you neuer in corners, rotten barnes, luskie lanes M. Stapl? will not say for what purposes, but God forgiue ye and do, but thinke ye werenot there for Religion.
And though it seemeth by these your lusty crakes, where ye are nn at Louaine, that ye would be thought no hedgeréeper· nor uedropper (as of your broode, are peaking here in lusy lanes, and lurking in corners, and yet they court the~ selues no more Donatistes than you): Notwithsta~ding it appeareth, for all your crakes bragges, ye haue not that stout courage fr your rase, but that ye like Louaine better than M. ging, and had rather blow your like lytorer in a lusky lane, or hide your head the corner of an old otten barne, rather than warme your selfe with a aggot a a ake in Smithfielde, suche as was the crueltie of your Popish tyrannie to those that constantly abode the terrible brunt therof.
And although other giuing place to your furie, either of their owne infirmitie, or that God preserued them to a better oportunitie, did then flée or hide them selues: what dyd they héerein, that Chryst gaue them not licence, example, and commaundement so to do? Ye might aswell obiect this, to those Saincts of God, of whome S. Paule telleth, that they wente about in the wildernesse, of whome the worlde was vnworthy.
Why say ye not, Elias lurked in lusky lanes, when he sted the face of Iesabell? Why say ye not, that Athanasius crepte into corners, when he hidde him selfe seue~ yeres in a Cesterne, an harder harborough than a rotten barne? For shame M. Stap. learne to make a difference betwéene the perfecution, and the cause of it: or else this were an easie argument to make all Donatistes, yea your selues also.
And would to God all corners, rotten barnes, and luskie lanes, were wel ransacked, some luskes (I think) would appeare in their likenesse, whom ye would be loth should be founde out, M. Stapleton.
Thirdly ye say, The donatistes, when they could not iustifie their owne doctrine, nor disproue the Catholikes doctrine, leauing the doctrine, fell to rayling, agaynst the vitious life of the Catholikes.
In this poynt, who be Donatistes, referre me to Luthers and Caluines bookes, especially to M. Iewell, and to your owne Apologie.
Ye nede not, M. Stap. referre your selfe so farre, referre your selfe to your selfe a Gods name, yea, go no further than this your Counterblast.
warrant ye, you blow such a blast héerein, that ye maye well encounter master D. Harding, master D. Saders, M. Dorman, M. Marshall, or any other of your writers, thoughe they haue all godly giftes in this poynt, yet this your Rhel horicall grace of rayling, goeth so farre beyonde them all, that they are scarse worthy to cary the wispe after you, M. Stap.
Onely at this maruell, that like the wiseman, when he tolde how many were in the companie, he neuer reckoned him selfe, that you hauing so pregnant a vayne héerein, do still forget your selfe.
But belike it is for this cause, that as ye surmount all your companie: so ye goe beyonde the Donatistes also, who (as ye saye) rayled onely agaynst the vitious lyues.
But you, where ye finde no vitious life to rayle agaynst the Protestantes, fall to slaundering and reuiling, euen their godly and vertuous liues.
Fourthly ye say, The Donatistes refused the ope~ knowne catholike Churche, and sayde, the Church remayned onely in those that were of their side, in certaine corners of Afrike.
And sing not you the like song, preferring your Geneua VVittenberge, before the whole Churche beside? The Donatistes (as you say M. St.) tied the Churche to Affrike, and wrested the scripture for it, forsaking the open knowne catholike Church in déede.
But you shoulde haue proued your popish Church to be that open knowne catholike Church now, which they refused then.
If ye saye, you proue that, bicause they refused the church of Rome then, your church is the church of Rome now: if ye vndersta~d the church for the co~gregation of the faythful, ye vtter a double vntruth.
For not only the co~gregation then at Rome, but of al the world besides: and agayne your church or congregation of Rome now, is nothing the same, or lyke the same, in religion, that it was then.
If ye meane by the church of Rome, the Citie of Rome, and the Popes chayre there: then ye proue your selues to be Donatistes, that tye the churche of Christ (dispersed euery where) to the seate of Rome, as they did vnto Aphrike.
And if ye meane by the open knowne catholike Churche, the multitude of people acknowledging your Popes sate at Rome: then agayne are ye Donatists by your second poynt, in craking of multitude, depending on Rome a corner in Italie: as ye saye, the Donatistes craked of their multitude, depe~ding on their corners in Affrike.
As for vs, we depende neither vpon Geneua, nor VVittenberge, nor tye the Church of Christ vnto them, nor preferre them, either before the whole catholike church, or any parte thereof: nor referre men vnto them, for the triall of the Church, or to any other place else: but allow them, and all and singuler other places, where the worde of God is sincerely set footh: where Idolatrie, errours, superstition are abolished.
We to the mountaynes, as Chrysostome expoundeth it, Qu sunt Christiani conferant se ad scriptura, They that are Christia~s, let them get them to the scriptures.
And why not to Rome, Ierusalem, and suche other mountaynes, but onely to the scriptures? Bicause, saith he, since that heresie hath possessed the Churches there ca~ be no triall of true christianitie, nor refuge of Christians, that would trie out the truthe of fayth, but the deuine scriptures.
Before, it coulde haue bene knowne diuers wayes, whiche was the Church, which was Gentilitie.
But nowe there is none other wayes to know, which is in deede the very church of Christ, but all onely by the Scriptures.
If they therefore set foorthe the Scriptures, we acknowledge them to be of the Church of Christ.
Let Rome doe this, and we will as gladly acknowledge Rome to be of the Churche of Chryst, as either Wittenberge or Genua· Yea as Hierome sayth, which is also put in the Popes owne decrées, Eugbium, Constantinople, Rhegium, Alexandrie, Thebes, Guarmatia, or any other place, if it professe the truthe with Geneua and Wittenberge.
For on this consideration (sayth S. Augustine, the Churche is holy and catholike, (not bicause it dependeth on Rome, or any other place, nor of any multitude obedient to Rome, bothe whiche are Donatisticall) but, quia recte credit in Deu~, bicause it beleeueth rightly on God.
This is our song, M. Stap. of Geneua, VVittenberge, Affrica, yea, and of Rome too.
And if you can sing any better note, giue you good leaue for me, onely would wish you (howsoeuer ye sing) to leaue your flat lying tune in saying Fifthly say you: The Donatistes corrupted the fathers bookes wonderfully, and were so impudent in alleaging them, that in their publique conference at Carthage, they pressed muche vpon Optatus wordes, and layde him foorth as an author making for the~, who yet wrote expresly against them, and in all his writinges condemned them.
Is not this, pray you, the vsuall practise of your Apostles, Luther and Caluine of M. Iewell and your owne too in this booke? as trust we haue, and shal make it most euident.
And heere let M, Dawes beare you companie too, in the craftie and false handling of his own deare brothers Sleidans story, where he leaueth out Alexander Farnesius Oration to the Emperour, wherin he sheweth the Protestants dissentions.
If this be an argument to proue a Donatist, belike your Popes, Boniface and Innocent, learned it of them, so impudently, in the publique conference, and Councel at Carthage, to alleage, lay foorthe, and presse muche vpon the Nicene Councell, as making for their superioritie: though all the true Copies therof condemned them, as impudent corrupters of the fathers Decrées.
What fathers bookes, and Councels haue these Popes successors spared since to falsefie, chalenging authoritie ouer all fathers and Councels, to do with the~ as they please? And as the Popes own sonnes, this is not onely the vsuall, but the chiefe, and almoste the onely practise of all Popish writers, in the alleaging of the fathers, euen as the diuel alleaged the Psalmes to Christ.
Neither do you onely corrupte the fathers bookes, but father on them whole bookes of your owne deuisings, falsified in the fathers names: as Erasmus exactly obseruing, hath founde out many suche euident corruptions.
As for vs (thankes be to God) ye name not one father corrupted by Luther, Caluine, the Bishop of Sarum, or of Wint. nor of any other as yet.
Onely ye finde faulte with M. Dawes, for omitting an Oration in Sleydan, no auncient father, but a late Hystoriographer.
knowe not his consideration in good sooth M. St. if did, would answere you.
But he is a liues man, and can answere you him selfe.
Your argument is very fond, to inferre a Donatist herevpon, yea, be it that we were culpable in this behalfe, as it is but your flaunderous lye: and yet, be it further, that it were any argument to proue a Donatist, not onely the parties whome ye name, haue proued your good masters Donatistes, but your selfe would proue your selfe to be as great a Donatist as the best.
Sixthly ye say: The Donatistes to get some credit to their doctrine, prete~ded many false visions and miracles, and they thought that God spake to Donatus from heauen, and doth not M. Foxe in his dunghill of stinking martyrs pretily followe them therein, trowe you? So clenly, M. St. your thethorike procéedeth from those swéete lippes of yours.
Ye chale~ge M. Foxe with vnsauery termes, ye proue or improue nothing agaynst him.
Onely ye scoffe at Luthers visions: and tell vs a tale of a man in Hungarie (I can not tell where nor whome) feigning him selfe to be dead, and pretending to be raysed agayne to life, to confirme the doctrine of the Gospell, but in conclusion was found to be dead in déede.
Hath not (say you) the like practise ben attempted of late in Hungarie, to authorise the new Gospel, by pretending to restore life to an holy brother, feigning him selfe to be dead, and by the greate prouidence of God, founde to be deade in deede? What witnesse of this, M. St? Forsooth aske your fellow if ye lie.
warrant ye he wil say, all is true, and who shall proue him a lyer, that the partie would so haue faigned him selfe to be dead, or would by such toyes, go about to co~firme the Gospell of Chryst? whome whispered he in the care, while he was on liue, that he ment any such matter? Wel, the partie is dead, ye say: then say I, it is easie for a false varlet (thereby to deface the Gospell) to deuise a lie by a dead body, or so suborite or bribe another to witnesse a lye.
For the partie (ye say) is dead, us Le morde a dead Lion (they say) bytes not.
But if he be dead, (presupposing there were any such thing in déede) God sende grace there were no false packing to murther him amo~g you, then to say so by him: haue heard of such Popish shifts ere now.
But howe soeuer the matter were, yea graunt it had bene so, that some noughtie fellowe had attempted suche a wickednesse, is the same to be obiected to the Protestantes, or the Gospell of Christe to be defaced therby? or not rather the more to be confirmed therby, that God abhorreth suche false meanes to set out his truth, and destroyeth suche dissemblers, as he did Ananias and Saphira: and wil haue his truth simply and playnely set foorth, as (thankes be to God therfore) it is in many places, and with good successe and encrease he blesseth it.
No, no, M. St. and that ye know full wel, we vse no such false visions, or feigned miracles, to further Gods truth: no, we seeke no visions or miracles at all, but séeke the truth it selfe.
It is the practise of your Church, to co~me~de your false doctrine vnto the simple, by pretending many false visions and miracles.
What haue ye else for purgatorie, but a number of reuelations, that were shewed forsooth to such or such a Monke or Frier? what else for deuising all the sectes of Friers and Nonnes, but such and such a reuelation? What haue ye for your Ladies Psalter, for hir Rosarie, for hir feast dayes, for the inuocation of Saincts, for the most of al your tru~perie in the Masse Diriges, for Reliques, shrines and pilgrimages, for worshipping this or that sainct departed, but your feigned reuelations, your false visions and miracles· Looke your Legends who shall, your paltry Friers postils, your Louanian scholemen, looke who shall on Marulus reuelatio~s, on Tundalus visions, on S. Bridgets reuelations, on the miracles of the blessed Uirgin set out in Latine and Englishe. &c.
He shall finde for this poynt such stuffe, that both his eares will glowe to reade it.
And these practises are not deuised by vs agaynst you in the name of a dead man: but they are set out in print, and published by your selues in good sad earnest, to deceiue the simple withall.
If therefore this be an argument to proue Donatistes by, then as it cleareth vs, that seeke no suche meanes, so it proueth you to be Donatistes, that in thus many poyntes of your religion stande so muche thereon.
Seuenthly say you, Did not the Donatistes preferre and more esteeme one National erronious Councel in Aphrica, than the great and generall Councell at Nice: keepe not ye also this trade, preferring your forged conuocation libell, before the generall Councell of Trident.
And this is set out with a Marginall note: They preferre a Nationall Councell, before the Generall.
As for forged Libels is but your forged lye, master Sta. if we preferre a Nationall Councell, before your Generall: no maruell, the legge of a larke is to be preferred before the body of a Kyte.
If ye crake of Generalitie, for the multitude: once agayne you make your selfe a craking Donatiste, althoughe in déede, there were no suche Generall assemblies, at your Trident Councell, as ye bragge vpon.
If meane, for the frée libertie and order of it: it was not onely Nationall of Italians in Italy, as the Donatistes was of Aphricans in Aphrica, but also more partiall, violent, and nothing but tongtyed bondage and compulsion, farre worse than was the Donatistes.
Eightly say you, The Donatistes sayde, that all the world was in an Apostacie before the comming of their Apostle Donatus: and is not Luther the same man to you, that Donatus was to them? We estéeme Luther as a notable organ of God, to detect your falshoods and open his truth: although we graunte he were not without his infirmities: but what dothe that excuse your apostacie, or argue him to be a Donatist? Yea, though he had sayd such words now as then Donatus falsly sayde.
Mght not an vniuersall apostacie haue bene since, or be nowe, bicause there was none suche then? and yet Luther charged not al the world, but al your popish Church with this Apostacie.
And what dothe he therein, that is not manifest? what said he, that the Apostle S. Paule foresayde not, there should come a defection before ye co~ming of christ? what said he, that eue~ at your last Trident councel (that ye craked on last) the Frenche Legate did not openly say to your Prelates faces? Verily we must euen of necessitie co~fesse this (quoth he) whether it hath bene perchau~ce by mans infirmitie, or by some neglige~ce of the Prelats of the church, or else by their preposterous godlinesse, if should name no greeuouser thing, that there hath crept into the Church very many things, worthy to be abolished, abrogated or restrayned.
Yea, what saide he, that euen your Pope hath not confessed? VVe know (saith Pope Adrian to the Princes of Germanie, in his Cpistle, wherin he chiefly inueigheth agaynst Luther) that euen in this holy seate, many abhominable things there haue bene already now certayne yeres, abuses in spirituall matters, excesses in co~maundements, to conclude, all things haue bene changed into peruersitie: not it is maruell, if the sicknes haue descended fro~ the head into the members, from the chief byshops into the inferiour Prelates: all we, that is to say, the eccl· Prelates, haue erred euery one in his owne wayes, nor there hath bene any this long while the which dyd good, no not one.
This general apostacie (loe) your owne Pope confesseth, both for him selfe, for his predecessors, for al other Prelates and Priests vnder him, and for al the Church besides.
And weye these words wel, M. St. for they serue agaynst you in many matters touched before, chiefly whether the Pope al his Prelates, yea al the visible state of the Church may erre, or no.
But ye were best make this Pope a Donatist too To the author of the harboroughe ye are answered by other, as heare say.
Ninthly, say you, The Donatists being charged and pressed to shew the beginning and continuance of their doctrine, and the ordinarie succession of their Bishops, were so encombred, that they coulde neuer make any conuenient aunswere.
And are not you pray you with your fellowes Protestant Bishops fast in the same myre? If not, aunswere then to my third demaunde in the fortresse annexed to Sainct Bede.
This is Satis proimperio, More than inough, for your authoritie, Master Stapleton, to commaunde our Bishops to aunswere your vaine demaundes, and pelting bookes, or else they must be Donatists.
But euen so played the Donatists with the godly Bishops then, as you play now with ours.
Your humour is all on vaine glorie, to set oute and vaunt your owne workes.
But it is a signe ye lacke good neighbours at Louaine.
For, one of them, not your selfe, should haue commended to vs your Demaundes, Fortresses, and Translations.
But your selfe must be faine sée, to put vs in minde of them, for your brethren séeke theyr owne glorie likewise in their writings.
And why then shoulde not you séeke yours as well as they? But for my part, as haue not youre noble Fortresse, so thinke your Demaunde be not worthie the séeking for, much lesse the aunswering.
pray you pardon me, if thinke amisse: for measure it by many other Demaunds of this your Counterblast.
As for the beginning of our doctrine, is alreadie shewed, euen he that is the beginning the ending, the Alpha and Omega, he began our doctrine, and hath euer continued and preserued it.
We say with Chrysostome (as is before sayd) Ad montes, Let vs flee to the mountaines, that is to the scripture: we say with Saint Cyprian, Ad fontein, Let vs go to the fountaine, that is to the Scripture: we say with the Prophetes, Ad legem testimentum, To the lawe and testimonie, that is, to the Scripture: we say with him that is the beginning himselfe, venite ad come vnto me and we admit onely that, Quod suit ab initio, reiecting that doctrine of which we may say, Non suit sic ab initio, It was not so at the beginning, this ye say the Donatistes being charged and pressed could not do: but we shewe you here the very beginning of all our doctrine.
Now if a man should demaunde of you, to shew the beginning of all your doctrines, aske you, as Christ teacheth vs to demaunde of you, the originals, is it of God, or is it of men: then are you for a great many of them, bemyred fast with the Donatistes, and can not tell how they came vp, sauing that they crept in by custome, and many retayned of the old superstitions of the Pagans, little or nothing turquesed: but none of them al came vp otherwise than by me~, none were set foorth of God in his holy word.
And so againe ye are Donatists, or worse than they, and the worse, in that (as the French Kings Embassadour aforesaide, tolde your Trident Fathers) ye hold fast with tooth nayle all things that ye haue receiued of long custome.
But the old fathers tell you, from whom ye father your customes: We must not follow the customes of man, but the truth of God.
Yea your old Popes them selues, Felix, Gregory, Nicholas, Leo, can tell you, that all customes should giue place to the Scriptures, for Christe said not he was custome, but the way, the truth and the life.
That we should not goe one Iote from the Apostles institutions.
That such ill customes are no lesse to be auoided than a pestilent infection, which except it be taken out the soner, the wicked will take holde of it, as dutie of priuileges.
And that such transgressions and presumptions being not forthwith suppressed, will be reuerenced for lawes and celebrated like priuileges for euer.
Here is the comming vp and beginning of the most of your doctrines, and therefore what hable ye of your Bishops, since your Bishops them selues say thus of your long customes beginning and continuance of them? As for the ordinary succession that ye crake of, ye haue neyther succession of Bishops nor Bishops at all, according to the beginning and the Apostles orders.
Which as it is now twice alreadie proued, so is it easie to see, by conference of the Apostles rules and principles of a Bishop, with your Popishe Bishops orders quite contrarie thereunto.
Where therefore ye crake and bragge so often of succession (although it be nothing in the person succéeding, except it be in the doctrine succeeding also) yet euen for the person ye neither can alleage any ordinarie succession but degenerate succession, nor ye haue any certaintie of that beginning thereof, that ye pretende, no not of the Bishop of Romes beginning and succession from Peter, whiche not onely examined by the infallible Scripture, will so encomber you, that ye can neuer make any conuenient answere therevnto, but be fast in the same myre that ye say the Donatistes were.
Tenthly ye say, The Donatistes finding fault with Constantine, Theodosius, and other Catholike princes, ranne for succour to Iulianus the renegate, and highly commended him: and doth not M. Iewell pray you, take for his president against the Popes primacie Constantius the Arrian, against Images Philippicus, Leo, Constantinus and such like detestable Heretikes by generall Councels condemned? do not your selfe play the like parte in the Emperour Emanuel as ye call him, and in other as we shall hereafter declare? By this rule should Hosius, Staphilus, M. Harding, M. Dorman, and your selfe also be Donatistes: that take argumentes from your aduersaries, yea from Heathen men.
And thus might ye haue fitte it very well: The Donatistes finding faulte with Constantine, Theodosius, and other Catholike Princes, ranne for succour to Iulianus the renegate and highly commended him: And doth not M. Stapleton, M. Harding, and other popish Priestes, finding fault with their most Christian and naturall soueraigne Ladie, unne ouer to Louaine, and to Rome, to a foraigne Apostaticall vsurper and highly commende him? this had bene a fitter and truer proportio~ M. St. of the twaine.
And what do you herein, that your graunde Captaine the Pope him selfe did not? Pope Boniface ran to the cruell and detestable tyrant Phocas, that most trayterously had murdred his naturall Emperour: and first obtayd of him this title of Primacie, that neuer any godly or lawfull Prince did graunt before this traytour Phocas, one vsurper to another vsurper, a good beginning of so good a claime.
Againe, did not Pope Gregorie the third stirre vp all Italie to rebell against the Emperour? and he and after him Pope Zacharie ran fro~ their naturall Prince, to the Princes of Fraunce, Germanie, and Italie, highly commending them, that mainteyned them selues against their soueraigne Lord and Emperour, and after that bereued him of the Empire of Rome also? did not Pope Stephan teach the nobles of Fraunce to forsake their liege King, and to run to Pepin an vsuper, whom you highly commende as one of your chiefest Patrones? Did not Pope Leo the fourth run from the true and lawfull Emperour, to his Tygerlike vnnaturall mother Irene the vsurper, whom he highly commended for maintayning Images? and do not you M. St. euen here for the same only cause, runne vnto, and highly commende hir hir Councell, crying out of the lawfull Emperours, calling them detestable and condemned Heretikes, bicause they abolished the worship of Images? but reserue the examining of these Donatisticall doings, and the trayterouse practises of your later Popes, to your seuerall counterblastes thereon.
In the meane season by this it appereth who be more Donatistes, we, that alleage an example (by writing) of those Emperours, were they as ill or worse than ye call them: or your Popes, that runne in déede fro~ their naturall Princes, to detestable murderers, and trayterous vsurpers.
Thu had ye fitte your co~parison, ye should liuely haue shewed, who had bene the very Donatists: the Protestants or the Papists.
Nowe who are pray you Donatists, for the defacing and ouerthrowing of aultars, for villayning the Chrisme, and the holy sacrament of the aultar? whiche they cast vnto dogges: whiche straight wayes by the ordinance of God, fell vpon them, and being therein Gods ministers, made them feele the smart of their impietie.
It were a tragicall narrtion, to open the great and incredible crueltie that the Donatists vsed towarde the Catholikes, especially their horrible rauishment of religious Nunnes.
And yet were they nothing so outragious, as your Hugenotes haue bene of late in Fraunce and the beggerly Guets in Flaunders, namely about Tourney.
First here master Stapleton, ye shewe your selfe a Donatist, after your first note, in corrupting the fathers wordes, as though those holy Uirgins, were suche Nunnes as your popish Church mainteyned.
Againe ye corrupt Optatus wordes, in telling vs of the sacrament of the aultar, as though there haged in his time such a God in a Pire ouer the aultare: or as though there were then any such altare: to make the people conceyue by your tale telling a great antiquitie, in your later vpstarted olatrie and superstition.
And this ye do in seuerall letters, as though they were the proper wordes of Optat, wherein ye shew your selfe a Donatist Secondly, it is not alike to compare the rooting vp of Idolatrie, and abolishing of naughtie superstitious customes (which euen your Popes, as haue shewed before, allow not) to the naughtie doing of the Donatists, for the outrages of souldiou, if any such were.
And put case there were any such (as doubt, to slaunder the Gospell ye aggrauate many lies, will make a mountaine of a molehill) yet me thin ye shoul remember that if crueltie be a rule of a Donatist, your selues that shewe farre passing crueltie and horrible outrages to the poore Hugenotes and beggerly Guets, as ye terme them, (hauing made them beggers, and made as many beggerly Papists to) suche is the papists loue to their owne side, but chiefly their immortall hatred to the Protestants, murthering them by heapes, burning, sacking, tormenting, yea euen the Carcases of the deade, and sowing salt on the grounde for spite, with infinite other vnnaturall and vnspeakable cruelties besides your secrete practises.
But hem quoth sir Harry, harpe no more on that string, for then were you Papists double and treble Donatists.
Although ye were worse than Donatists herein also, that so much peruerted, altred, abused, prophaned hypocritically, all those things that ye mention.
And abused with so much filthie abhomination euen those your religious Nunnes, that many of your side were ashamed complayned thereon, and therefore God hath iustly rooted them out· Twelfthly say you.
The Donatists sayd of the Catholikes: Ill portant multorm imperatorum saer.
They bring vs many of the Emperours letters, we bring them the only Gospels.
And is not this the voyce of all Protestants whatsoeuer? onely Scripture, onely the Gospell, onely the worde of God? and for the first part, what is more common in the mouthes of the Germaine Lutherans, of the French Caluinists, and now of the Flemish Guets, than this complaint, that we presse them with the Emperors diets, with the Kings proclamations, and with the Princes placards? to the which they obey as much as the Donatists, when they haue power to resist.
Remitting your rayling Rhetorike (Master Stapleton) to your common places: your argument is very fonde and faultie.
First, if this be a simple and generall proufe of Donatists, to say we bring the onely Gospels, you will make Christ a Donatist to, for he brought the onely Gospels.
And his Disciples and Apostles Donatist, for they brought the onely Gospels, and sayde they knewe nothing but Iesus Christ crucified, they deliuered no other thing than that they had receyued, and accursed him that should bring any thing besides this onely Gospell.
Ye will make the fathers Cyprian, Chrysostome, Ambrose, Hierome, Augustine, &c. become Donatists: that will vs in all trialles of any point of doctrine, to bring the onely Scripture, the onely Gospels, the onely worde of God? Againe, for the other part, if this were a proufe of a Catholike, to bring, imperatorum sacra, the letters of many Emperours, and to complaine hereon, the token of a Donatist: then was Athanasius diuerse other godly Bishops Donatists also, the Arrians Catholikes.
And your selfe with M. Feck. alleage the complaints of Athanasius, belike to proue him a Donatist.
This therfore (M. St.) thus simply set forth maketh but a simple argument.
Ye should either proue, that we do bring the onely Gospell, and complaine of your Princes diets, Proclamations, placards, after the maner that the Donatists did, or else ye proue nothing but your selfe a malicious slaunderer.
We bring the onely Gospels to you, as Christ his Disciples and the holy fathers brought them to vs, and yet bring we not the Gospell so alone, that we bring not also the fathers writing thereon, we also bring both Princes diets, Proclamations and placards, so farre forth as they mainteyne, set forth and agrée with the doctrine of the onely Gospels.
Otherwise, can ye wyte Athanasius, if he complayned when he were pressed wyth them? Can ye wyte the poore Protestants in Germanie, Fraunce, Flaunders, if they so much as complaine that ye presse them wrongfully, euen as your selfe in plaine wordes confesse tht ye presse them in déede, with the Emperors diets, with the kings Proclamations, and with the Princes placardes? Neuerthelesse, if ye pressed them lawfully, and as Constantinus pressed the Donatists, warrant ye no Protestant would once complaine thereon.
But ye presse oppresse them, with nothing but mere violence to maintaine your errours, besides and against the worde of God.
And to this purpose, your selues play the right partes of the Donatists, for as the Donatists peruerted and wrested the scriptures, to shake the authority of princes fro~ themselues, which otherwise they admitted so farre as pleased them: so do the popishe priests peruert and wrest the scriptures, to reiect the Emperors and other Christian princes authoritie ouer them, and vpbraid vs saying, Ill porant multoru~ imperatorum sacra, They bring many of the Emperors letters, that is, we presse them with the authoritie of princes, when we require that ye giue as much and no more authoritie vnto Princes, than the onely worde of God doth warrant them.
But you will giue them no more, nor yet their sacra, their diets, proclamations, or placarts, than shall serue your turne.
And thus your selues are most Donatists in this poynt.
Your last comparison, is of the Donatists murdring of others and of themselues, and yet canonizing of suche for Sainctes and Martyrs.
This comparison ye stretched out with large outroades, nothing agaynst the Bishop, nor to the matter, and in déede nothing but extréeme rayling and scoffing agaynst master Foxes booke, to whome remitt the quarels that you lay vnto him, who is able at the full to aunswere them.
As for me will aunswere, onely to the comparison for murthering and canonizing, wherein the Papists excell all other.
If ye had master Stapleton alleaged the Monke that poysoned himselfe, to poyson his prince: the Pope that to poyson his welthie Cardinals dronke him selfe of the wrong Bottell: had ye tolde that men said of the death of the two late Cardinalles in Englande: or howe good a medicine for the heade ache your Popishe Priestes haue made of the Sacrament of the aultare as ye term it: and what Princes they haue poysoned therewith: If ye had tolde of your Italian perfumes and Spanishe figges for the pippe: ye might well master tapleton, haue confirmed your comparisons from the Donatists murders.
But what néede such prini tokens in so open a matter? Your hate charitie, to heape burning coales on your aduersaries heas too many haue felt, and all the world doth knowe.
For murther, the Donatists be nothing comparable, nor yet Baraba the Iew, nor nere a théefe in Newgate, to the bldthirstie Papists.
Ye say Saint Augustine sayth of the Donatists viueb ant vt latrones, moreba~tur vt circumcliones, honorabantur vt martyres.
They liued like robbers, they died lyke Circumcelions (meaning they fiue themselues) they were honoured as martyrs.
True in déede master Stapleton, and ye put me in remembrance of another saying, that went in thrée parts to, trowe it was of an honest man of your religion, of whom it was sayd, vt vulpes, regnabat vt Leo, moriebatur vt canis: He entred like a Foxe, he reigned like a Lion, he died like a dogge.
And yet ye count him one of Gods holy vicars.
And pray ye call to minde another common saying, that went also on three partes, euen of your Popish canonzed Saincts, that some were worshipped a Saincts in heauen, that liued full wickedly here in earth, and are now tormented with Diuels in hell: this did men say master Stap. an they were Papists that sayde so to.
Ye tll vs of the Montanists that worshipped one Alexander for a worshipfull martyr, though he suffred for no matter of religion, but for mischieuous murther.
What is this to the Donatists master Stapleton? or that which ye tell vs of the Manichees worshipping the day of their master Manes death.
The worship of dead men good or bad, or the kéeping of solemne dayes as in the honour of them, is proper to you popish not to vs.
We kepe a memoriall graunt, but of these onely whome we are most infallibly assured that they be the blessed Sainctes of GOD. Howbeit, we worship not them, nor the day for them, nor them by the day: wée worshippe onely GOD in spirite and truth, as Christ hath taught vs.
But you that so worshippe deade men, will yée worship none for Martyrs, but those that dyed for matters of Religion? Whie worshipped ye then, and that with such high worship to, your solemne Saint Thomas Becket, that dyed for no matter of Religion at all? But eyther for his obstinacie agaynste his liege Lorde, and agaynst all the Barons Spirituall and Temporall of the Realme: or if ye colour it neuer so fayre, yet was it but in mainteyning his honour, and the priuileges of the Clergie, and that contrarie to the auncient custome of the Realme: except yée will graunt that the Popishe Religion doeth consiste herein.
Whiche if ye bée ashamed to confesse, vpbrayde not then for shame false Martyrs vnto vs, nor yet the Canonising of wicked Sainctes.
It redoundeth on your selfe, on your Legende, on your Popes, and on your Pope holy Saincts.
Whome, by this rule, you make both Donatists, Montanists, Manicheans, or what soeuer Heretikes ye can obiect besides.
As for all these Comparisons hitherto, betwéene the Protestantes, and the Donatists, wherein ye thinke ye haue be stowed great cunning, there is not poy that is not violently wrested, to make it séeme to touch vs: and not one poynt, that (being returned on your selues) doeth not rightly and fully hitte you home againe.
And therefore, for my part am content, as you concluding say you be.
To ende this talke with the whole conference, leauing it to the indifferent Reader to consider, whether the (Popishe) Catholikes, or the Protestants, drawe nearer to the Donatists.
To come newe at length to the sixt and last parte of this Chapter, which consistes in reming such motiues, as the Bishop alleageth, to burthe Master Feckenham with the practise of the Donatists.
Let vs then (sayth master Stapleton) proceede foorth, and consider vpon what good motiues ye charge master Feckenham to be a Donatist, whiche are to say truth, none other but falsehoode and follie.
But, as ye surmise, the one is bicause hee craftily and by a subtile shifte, refuseth the prooues of the olde Testament, as the Donatists did.
The other, bicause hee with the sayde Donatists should auouch, that secuer Prince haue not to meddle in matters of Religion, or causes ecclesiasticall: nor to punishe any man for such causes.
These two motiues (ye say Master Stapleton) are to say the truth none other but falsehoode and follie.
In déede they are the wors, by comming through so false a marchantes handes as yours.
For shame either tell the wordes as they e, at least the true and full effect of them: or neuer sette them out in a distinct letter, sy you so often, but euer falsly, vpbrayde the Bishop hereof.
Else all the follie and falsehoode will proue to be in your selfe, and not in the Bishops motiues.
The Bishop spke not of Princes medling or punishing for Ecclesiasticall as though the Donatists simpli denied that, an graunted Princes yet so much, as to meddle or punishe for your Ecclesiasticall causes, that is to say to be your executioners therin, as though the Emperors other Christian Princes more vpon them at that time.
But the Bishop tolde how the godly fathers craued aide assistance of the magistrats and rulers, to reforme them, to reduce them to the vitie of the church, to represse their heresies, with their au thoritie godly lawes made for that purpose, to whome it belonged of duetie, and whose especiall seruice of Christ is, to see, care, and prouide, that their subiects be gouerned, defended, and mainteyned, in the true and syncere religion of Christ, without all errours, superstitions and heresies.
This is that the Bishop wrote, and to proue this he alleageth Saint Augustine.
This did the Donatists then denie vnto them, and this do now the Papists denie: and ye come sneaking in and tell vs, the Bishoppes motiue was this, In charging Master Feckenham to followe the Donatists: by cause hee with the Donatistes, shoulde auouche, that seculer Princes haue not to meddle in matters of Religion or causes Ecclesiasticall, nor to punishe anie man for suche causes.
As though the controuersie had bne for anie kinde of medling, or punishing: whiche you, sming to graunt to Princes, to bée your seruaunts and droyles in suche ecclesiasticall causes, and so farre as you assigne them, might therefore séeme not to play the Donatists, when ye play their partes so liuely as can bée, and so subtilly, that the Donatistes were but Babes vnto you: in séeming to giue them some medling or punishing in Ecclesiasticall causes.
but if they meddle with or punishe you, or anie other, otherwise than ye commaunde and restrayne them, you so little then suffer them to meddle in Ecclesiasticall matters, that with solemne curses ye debarre them from medling in anie temporall and ciuill matters too, so farre ye passe the Donatists.
For shame master Stapleton, tell your tale plainely, that we may sée whether M. Feckenham played the Donatistes part or no: or else your doubling wyll declare your selfe to be a Donatist also for companie.
But let vs sée how ye aunswere these motiues euen as your selfe propounde them.
The one is (say you) bicause he craftily and by a subtile shifte, refuseth the proues of the old Testament, as the Donatistes did.
Your Stale Iestes M. Stapleton of a fine blast of a horne· of a oule slawe, of a blinde betell blunte shifte, ouer passe them.
When M. Feckenham (ye say) offereth to yelde, if ye can proue this regiment, either by the order that Christ left behinde him in the new Testament, either by the Doctours, either by Councels, or els by the continuall practise of any one Churche, thinke you M. Horne, that this is not a large and an ample offer? The largenesse of this offer is not here in questio~ M. St. the offer is large and ample inough· taken of the Bishop at his handes, and proued vnto him at his owne demaunde.
It remaineth then that he stande to his promise, and yelde to the truth, or else he sheweth that he minded to offer more, than he purposed to perfourme.
Onely now it is examined, why here he specifieth the new Testament, and quite leaueth out the old Testament· This doing, in this pointe, saith the B. smelleth of a Donatist.
Nay say you, There is not so much as any co~iecture, to gather this vppon, yea the old Testament is not by this offer excluded but verely included.
For if the new Testament, which rehearseth many things out of the old, haue any thing out of the old Testament, that make for this regiment: if any Doctour old or new, if any Councell haue any thing out of the old Testament that serue for this regiment, then is Master Feckenham concluded, yea by his owne graunt.
For so the Doctour or Councell hath it, he is satisfied according to his demaunde.
VVhereby it followeth, he doth not refuse, but rather allowe and affirme the proufes of the old Testament.
It might in déede follow M. Sta. but it doth not alwayes followe· man may refuse manifest proufes of the old Testament and yet graunt such things besides, that he may be concluded yea by his owne graunt· And so is M. Feckenham here concluded as graunting the newe Testament, the Councels, and Fathers.
For since al these alleage he proufes of the old Testament: he is forced by conclusio~ of necessarie consequence, to graunt also to the old Testament.
Except he be as peeuish as the Donatistes, that granted thus much also and yet refused the manifest proufes and examples of the old Testament.
Although their own péeuishnesse conuinced the~, but still they stoode on the bare wordes as you do, and refused inclusiue proufes followed they neuer so necessarily.
And so did your selfe before require the Bare title of this supremacie to be shewed in the exa~ples of the old Testament, el you reiect the exa~ples, agrée they neuer so much in matter.
But now contrary, ye say, M. Feckenham doth allow and affirme the proufes of the old Testament, bicause they may be included in those pointes that he alleageth, but he would be loath they should be included, as thankes be to God they be: and so, Uolens, uolens, beyonde his expectation, is enforced with them.
But what is this to excuse him more tha~ the Donatists, if he had not of set purpose slonke from the manifest proufe examples of the old Testament? for otherwise, he might as soone haue expresly named the old Testament, as he expresly named the new.
And so should he haue gone directly simply to worke, not indirectly with a Circumqua{que}, haue referred the old Testament to such inclusions, as you here would shake off the matter withall: chiefly since the old Testament, hauing no included but expresse proufes, is so expresly vrged of vs.
And yet if he would haue included the old Testament, (as you say) vnder the name of the new Testament, why specifieth he the one so plaine, not the other at all? if he did it for breuitie, he might most briefly haue saide, the Scriptures: which worde had comprehended included both, so had he shewed, that he allowed the proufes of the old Testament also.
Ueritas non querit angulos: The truth seekes no inclusiue corners, goe plainly man to worke for very shame.
For yet, for all your inclusions here to colour the matter: in other places where this is not layde vnto your charge, both your selfe and M. Dorman, quite excludeth the examples of the old Testament from the new, as not fit paterns for Princes to followe.
Doing herein (what pretences so euer you here include) euen as M. Feckenham dothe, and the Donatistes did before.
And that Master Feckenham did no other, but euen of purpose conceale the old Testamentes examples, as foreseing that they made against him: will aske no better witnesse than your owne selfe Master Stapleton that by all these couerte inclusions go aboute to excuse him.
But when ye can not make any good excuse: in conclusion, yea in your next wordes, ye bewray all the matter, ye could hold it no lenger for your life, blabbe it wist and out it must.
And surely (say you) wise men vse not greatly to shew that maketh against them, but most for them.
Holde your hande from the booke M. St. ye neuer saide truer worde in all your life.
Ye hitte the pricke there in déede, and tell the very cause why he concealed the name of the old Testament and shewed it not in his large and ample offer.
Bicause (say you) wise men surely, vse not greatly to shew that maketh against them, but most for them: but M. Feckenham surely is a wise man: Ergo, he sheweth not in his offer the name of the old Testament bicause the proufes thereof make against him, but onely put the name of the new Testament, bicause he thought that made moste for him.
True, Master Stapl. thus do the children of this world (beyng wiser in their generations than the childre~ of light) not shewe· as ye say, but conceale the truthe of God, bicause they sée, it maketh agaynst them.
But herein M. St. for all your iolie witte and wisedome, that ye vaunte vppon so often, your wisdome ouershot it selfe.
Surely ye did not like one of these wise men, but rather like one of the wise men of Gotham, God turning your wisedome into folly, that confesse those examples and proufes to make against M. Feckenham, or at least wise that he so feared, and therefore he sheweth not the name of the old Testament, but concealeth it.
And thus, while your drift is to proue that he shifteth not off those proufes and examples, you confesse that he of very purpose, (not minding, as ye saide before, to include them, but to exclude them) leaueth them out and sheweth them not, but shifteth them of, and that of a shamefull purpose, only bicause they make against him.
Where if he had any sparke of truth and conscience, he would not hide that in Gods worde that maketh against him.
But perceyuing that those prouses make against him, would withall perceiue him self to be in a manifest errour, and neuer let worldly wisedome so ouercome him, that he should be ashamed openly to confesse, that he striueth against the truth.
And you M. Stapleton had ye any grace, confessing the truth to be against him, (except ye be a very Manichee, that set the old Testament against the newe,) would perceyue, that if the old were against him, then the newe were also against him: and would euen here, hurle away the penne, that should defende such a shifter off, and hider of the truthe, against your conscience.
So farre would ye be from this impudencie to write that he affirmeth and comprehendeth that, which of wisedome as ye call, it he purposely concealeth: and that he alloweth that, which he hides as making against him.
Whiche is no point of wisedome M. Stapleton but rather of starke follie, and méere contradiction to it selfe, and to all your former excuses.
And thus speaking of wise men, to shewe your selfe in the number: ye speake against him, whome ye are hyred and labour to defende: ye speake against your selfe, yea against your cause and all.
So doth God make them shew their owne shame, that wittingly will be hyred with Balaam to resist his open truth.
The wise men are confounded (sayth the Lord) they shal be astonied and taken for lo, they haue cast out the word of the Lorde, what wisdome can be among them.
And so hath God here infatuate M. St. that whe~ he hath bewrayed the very cause why M. Feck. shewed not in his offer, the name of the old Testame~t, so wel as of the new, to be, bicause he thought it made agaynst him, therefore did like a wise man, to leaue it out: he concludeth most fodly, euen the quite contrarie.
VVherfore (sayth he) it is incredible that M. Feck should once imagine any suche sifting or shifting, as ye dreame of, hauing wonne his purpose agaynst you, euen by the very olde Testament, as we haue declared.
By your owne declaration, M. Stap. (all your inclusiue shifts for him not withstanding) ye haue declared the quite contrarie: That he wisely (as he thought) left it out as agaynst him, which (when ye haue sayde all that ye can to salue the matter) is in very déede nothing else but sifting and shifting, and that full shamefull too.
Now where ye vrge your conclusion further, saying: And therefore it is spoken but in your dreame, when ye say, ye haue therby with maruellous force shaken M. Feck. holde, which surely is so forcible, as will not beate downe a very paper wall.
And maruell were it, if ye should so batter his holde, when that these your great Canno~s come not nigh his holde by one thousande miles.
Haue ye measured the myles, that ye recken them so iumpe, M. Stap? else it is possible ye might be deceyued.
For if the proues of the olde Testament be agaynst master Feckenhams cause (as you haue confessed) there is no doubt but they would shake and beate it downe al to fitters, if they were bent and shot agaynst his holde were it neuer so strong: which in déede is nothing else but the very paper walles ye speake of, as your M. D. Harding, while he was a Protestant, called Purgatorie.
And therfore M. Feck· more worldly wise than you his defender: like an olde beaten souldiour, knowing they were against him, or at least so fearing, mistrusting withal his paper walled holde durst not abide the battrie of those great Ca~nons, the proofes and examples of the olde testament, and therefore, as ye confessed before, would not shew that which made agaynst him, but purposely left it out, wherin how wisely soeuer he did, your selfe, thinke, spake and wrote all these follies contradictions in your dreames, which, had ye béene well awake, ye would neuer (I déeme) haue confessed for very shame.
For master Feck. is so farre from this suspition, that he him selfe bringeth in agaynst you· many and good testimonies of the olde law (as fol. and.
by the force whereof onely he may be thought to haue shaken and ouerthrowen to your rotten weake holde, vnderpropped with your Sampsons postes, as mightie as Bulrushes.
If the proofes and examples of the olde Testament séeme to you as mightie as bulrushes, howe mightie then did M. Feckenham thinke your cause? much weaker belike than withered grasse, that perceyuing these bulrushes were agaynst it, durst not abyde the brunte and pushe of them, but like a wise man, that is to say, like a subtill Donatist, paste them ouer in silence.
But as therein (laboring to shewe master Feckenham to be a wise man) ye shewed your selfe not to be all the wisest: so haerein (going aboute to cleare him of refusing the olde Testament, and so to be no Denatist) ye not onely your selfe with him refuse these proofes, like the Donatistes, but worsse than the Donatistes, call the proofes of the olde Testament in contempt, as mightie as Bulrushes.
So did Golias accompte the mighte and slingstones of Dauid, to giue as small a stroke as a fillip, or as your bulrushes, master Stapleton, but yet the little stone of Dauid rushed him top side turny.
So did Holofernes captaynes esteeme the Bethulians, saying, these mise are come out of their holes and dare prouoke vs to fight with them.
But suche a God is God, that by the weake things of the worlde he confoundes the mightie, and euen with his bulrushes ouerturueth all your bulwarkes.
Ye thinke, M. St. it is incredible that Feck coulde be a Donatist, bicause he bringeth in many good testmonies of the olde law, as fol.
by the force wherof onely he may be thought to haue shaken, and ouerthrowne too, our rotten weake holde. &c.
He may (as ye say) be thought so, M. St. of some of your side.
But the question might be demaunded, what he hath done, and not what he may be thought to haue done.
But how many, ye durst not tel for shame, nor ye goodnesse of the~ to proue the Popes supremacie, but wisely also let them alone, say he may be thought by them to proue the Popes title, whereas they make nothing for it, nor against the Princes gouernment any thing at al.
But what is all this to ye purpose, to cleare M. Feck of a Donatist? if it be incredible that he is a Donatist, which refuseth all these proofes out of the old Testament, bicause he admitteth other proofes, suche as he thinks make for his purpose: then is it incredible to beléeue, that the Donatistes them selues were Donatistes, which is not onely incredible, but impossible.
Did not the Donatistes for their Churche in the corners of Afrike cite the Canticles other places in the olde Testament, they sayde they were many and good also, notwithstanding they refused these proofes examples of princes gouernment.
And yet no ma~ thought it incredible nor impossible, that they should still be Donatistes.
So, is it nothing incredible nor impossible, but that, for all your testimonies fro~ Aarons priesthood ceremonies, which ye alleage out of the olde testame~t, that bind vs not: and yet refusing the manifest proofes examples of Princes, that binde vs: ye may, for all this, be Donatistes still.
But perceyue (say you) by your good Logike, your law and like diuinitie, silence maketh a deniall, and bicause M. Feckenham maketh no mention in this place of the matter to be proued by the olde Testament, therefore he subtilly refuseth the prooues thereof.
What néede many wordes master Stapleton, your selfe haue confessed that this making no me~tion of the matter to be proued by the olde Testaments ensamples: was a wise mans part, bicause they were against him.
What it is in lawe, (which is your profession) to play suche wise mens partes: commit to the Lawyers.
But in diuinitie (Master Stapleton) of which ye say ye are now a student, if you studie till your braynes ake, ye shall finde this wisedome, that concealeth the truth, which maketh agaynst it, to be nothing lesse than a subtill refusall, which is the fayrest name ye can couer the Donatists errour withall.
But ye should rather (say you) me thinke, induce the contrarie, and that he consenteth to you for the olde Testament: Quia qui tacet consentire videtur: (as the olde saying is) for hee that holdeth his peace, seemeth to consent: and so yee might haue better forced vppon him that all was yours, presupposing that you had prooued the matter by the olde Testament.
Do ye leaue your Logike, Lawe, and Diuinitie, so soone, and fall to prouerbes master Stapleton, and olde sayings? In déede it is an olde saying, that he that holdeth his peace, seemeth to consent: But yet this (seemeth) proueth not that he doth consent.
man may refuse some things, and bicause he refuseth them, will not aunswere them.
man may (seeing a thing against him) of purpose hide it in silence, and so, thinking to slippe the coller, he subtilly refuseth it.
man may play coll vnder Candlestick, séest me, séest me not: and who is so blind as he that seeth will not sée? man may lay his hande on his mouth, mumbudget, whust, not a word for a thousand pound, least he open a gappe, and rippe vp a matter against him selfe.
And what doth he héere, graunt it or refuse it? doth he not of set purpose subtilly refuse it, and thinks him selfe no smal foole, yea, perhaps a great wise ma~, in so refusing it? and God wot, a full simple man is he that perceiueth not this to be a playn refusal.
If leauing Logike, law and diuinity, ye runne for succour to old sayings: These are no new sayings, M. St.
thinke ye haue heard also of another homely olde saying: VVhen the rayne raynes and the goose winkes, little wottes the gosling what the goose thinkes.
And a full séely gosing would ye make your selfe, M. St. if, séeing how M. Feck. as subtil as a gooe winkes at these matters, will not of purpose sée them, when he is so pressed vrged with these exa~ples proues, that as it were they raine vpon him: ye thinke not that this is a refusall of them, but perhaps ye wil say, ye be wiser than the gosing, and that ye perceiued as muche as did the winking goose, when ye sayd, he seemeth to consent that holdeth his peace, for ye tell not what he seemeth to consent vnto.
He seemeth in deede to consent vnto this, that they be against him as ye say, and for this cause like your wise man, he purposely refuseth them, in burying them in silence, so muche as lyeth in him, euen as the Donatistes did.
Now that neither logike, lawe, diuinitie, olde sayings, nor yet the wise mans shifte, will serue to cleare master Feck. from béeing a Donatist: master Stap. will once more (for an olde grudge) haue a ing at vs, and to see if he can fasten any thing on vs, be sayth: But you will needes driue your reason another way.
Let vs see then, what we Catholikes can saye to you for your Apologie by the like drifte.
You and your Colleges seeing themselues arged with many heresies, to wipe away that blot, if it be possible, and for your better purgation, take vpon you, to shew your whole, full and entire beleefe.
And thervpon you recite the articles of the common Creede.
But now good sir, aske you a question, what if by chaunce you had omitted any one of them, would ye gladly be measured by this rule· ye measure M. Feck. by? would ye be content, that the catholikes should lay to your charge, that ye subtilly refuse that article, that ye haue foreslowne to rehearse? If ye would not, then must say to you with Christ: Quod ibi non vis fieri, alteri non facias.
Do you not to another, that ye would not haue done to your selfe.
If ye say that ye are content to stande to the very same law, as if ye be a reasonable and a constant man you must needes say: Lo then good sir, you haue concluded your selfe, and al your co~panions plaine heretikes, for the refusall of the articles, Conceyued of the holy Ghost, which ye omit in the rehearsall of your Creede, which article, am assured, ye finde not there.
Then further, seeing the Archeheretike Eutiches, and before him Apollinarius in the reciting of the co~mon creede ranne in a maner the same race, you following them at the heeles· as fast as may be, pretermitting also these words: Incarnatus est de spiritu sancto, here might we euen by your own rule and example, crie out vpon you all as Apollinarians and Eutichians, and that with more colourable matter, than you haue, either to make M. Feck. a Donatist, or that your Apologie hath to make the worthy and learned Cardinall Hosius, a Swenkfeldian: wherin your rhethorike is altogither as good, as is this yours heere agaynst master Feckenham.
To let rhethorike go, M. St. with your law logike, wil only come to your questio~, then to your illatio~ ye inferre theron Your demaund standeth on this presupposall.
VVhat if we, by chaunce, haue omitted any article of the common creede? would we be charged, that we subtilly refused that article? This similitude, M. St. is nothing alike, fro~ any article, either by chance (as ye say) omitted, or not required, or not in question at al, or not pertine~t to the purpose issue in ha~d, but graunted agréed vpon of bothe parties, without any co~trouersie: to a thing not by chance, but of purpose omitted, as your selfe haue confessed, M. Feck. did omit the proofes of the old testament, bicause he was a wise, otherwise called a subtill man: he béeing so much vrged of his aduersarie therwith: the matter chiefly in questio~ properly belonging to the purpose issue in hand: yea, him self making a chalege to be tried by the scriptures, fathers, councels practise: to strike off before hand (as it were a debarre) the one halfe of ye same scripture, or rather ye part therof, that setteth it out most plainly: to do al this, only bicause it maketh against him: what can this be thought else but subtill refusing and shifting off, as did the Donatistes? and to liken the other chance vnto this, which (all the world may sée, eue~ by your owne confession) is most vnlike, what is this but another shamefull kinde of shifting off also? Thus you sée, that ye can rightly lay no such thing to our charge, although, as ye say, by chaunce, some article of the common Creede had bene by vs forslowne.
We refuse not the rule of Christ, in this or any other behalf: neither do we so to you, as you haue done to vs: but require you rather to do so to vs, as we haue done to you.
But then, ye say, we conclude our selues and al our companions plaine heretikes.
And how so, M. St? for that (say you) in the apologie in the reciting of the co~mo~ creede ye omit these words, incarnatus est de spiritu sancto, conceyued of the holy ghost.
First formast, M. St. this assertion of yours, is a wilful lye, not a scape forslowne or ouershot by chance: if ye haue séene the Apologie your selfe, as dare say, ye haue done, narrowly pried for the matter, think ye haue espied more than your master could espie, or thought worthy to be noted.
For where as ye tell vs, both in your text, and in your margine for fayling, that the Apology reciteth the common creede: this is most euident false.
And your M. D. Harding him selfe, dare say, if he he a liues man, will say ye erre fowly therin, who findeth a péeuish fault with Thapologie, euen for this, that it reciteth not the common creede.
But can ye say your common creede, M. St? For it may be (to conster it to the best) that this your errour is rather of ignorance.
thinke ye say your common Creede in Latin oftner than in Englishe, for in Englishe ye reke not howe fewe can say it, and yet ye hitte it truer in Englishe, than in Latin.
But you that reprehende the byshop and other for Grammer, in englishing of wordes so exactly, pray you, by what newe founde figure of Grammer, do ye englishe, Incarnatus est de spiritu sancto, He was conceyued by the holy Ghost? In good sooth, M. Stap. ye were héere somewhat co~ceyued amisse your selfe.
And this was a greater ouershotte than any of your common petit quarels, besides this foyle most of all, that ye can not perfectly say the common Creede, nor write it rightly in your booke, that almost eche plow boy can say without the booke.
Ye tell vs Thapologie reciting the common Créede, omitteth Incarnatus est de spiritu sancto, whereas those wordes are not in the common Creede.
The wordes of the common Creede are these, Qui conceptus est de spiritu sancto, with whiche agréeth Damasus Creede, and not Qui incarnatus est de spiritu sancto.
Thus haue all the bookes that haue séene, and yet haue looked a good many, to see if any write it as you do, whereby mighte the rather holde you excused.
The wordes that you recite are the words of the Nicene creede, which ye haue put in your Masse.
But belike ye sing Masse oftner than ye say the co~mon Créede, so tooke that which ye commonly vsed, to be the common creede, Well, say you, howsoeuer it be, ye haue héere omitted both incarnatus and conceptus too· And therfore by your own rule and example, heere might we crie out vpon you all, as Apollinarians and Eutichians.
In déede M. Sta· no man can let ye to crie out and crow out, that we be, what soeuer it please you to crie out vpon vs.
But howe well and truely ye may crie it out, that is another matter.
For, by the same rule and example, you might crie out also vppon Ireneus, that omitteth this article in his Créede.
Ye might crie out of Tertullian, that likewise omitteth it.
Ye might crie out vppon S. Ambrose, and S. Augustine, that are said to haue compiled the himne Te 'Deum.
Ye might crie out vppon Athanasius Creede Quicun{que} vult: And vppon diuerse other, that omitte this Article of the conception of Christ by the holy ghost.
But looke you to it whether any of their Heresies touch your or no, euen in maintenance of their hereticall doctrine.
You stretch the rule to farre and to generally (M. Stap.) euery forflowne omission by chaunce, as your selfe say, where no speciall occasion is giuen, is not a subtile refusall: Nor so M. Feckenham is charged, your selfe haue shewed he did it wittingly, yea wisely as you say, and he thought to omitte that that he is chiefly charged withall, bicause it made against him.
If the fathers, and the Apologie did thus in their omission: then hardly lay it to their charges, and therein ye shall do but well.
For otherwise, as you would retorte this on vs: see how sone, and how sore it might be retorned on you, yea and that in the selfe same place where of very purpose ye say the common creede, and say to the Bishop in your forth booke about the number of the articles, that ye will bring him to his Catechisme, which vnlesse ye thought your selfe a cumming student in Diuinitie, and specially well traueled in your abe, ye woulde not else take vpon you to teache a Bishop.
In déede your Bishops were verie blinde, but thankes be to God our Bishops are no such blinde guides, that they should néede to learne their Catechisme of you.
But let vs sée how do ye teache him when ye come euen to the common creede, how ye number the Articles, (although concerning your quarell at the number of the articles) wil answere (God willing in his proper place.
The first article then is (say you) beleue in God.
And here proceding to other Articles, ye leaue quite out these wordes, his onely sonne our Lorde.
Why do ye thus M. Stapleton? do ye not beléeue that Iesus Christ is the sonne of God, and that he is the onely sonne of God, and that he is our Lorde? Looke well to this geare M. St. here is first, after the manner of your accounting, thrée articles omitted, and one of them such a speciall point, as we charge you with, that ye take away his Lordship, now ye take away his sonneship too.
Will ye say this was ouerhipped by chaunce or forslowne? well be although, euen in saying the common Creede, suche a forslowne scape might deserue a yerking in a yong scholler, but more shamefull it is in a Diuine, yea in such a Diuine as will take vpon him to teach a Bishop.
But why not? would not the sow take vppon hir, to teach Minerua? but let vs sée your furder teaching.
The sixte, beleeue that he was conceyued of the holy ghost.
The seuenth, that he was borne of the virgine Mary.
Here once againe, ye omitte these wordes, crucified, dead, and buried: conteyning also (after your reckening) thrée other articles, and ye leaue them cleane out.
Whether it be, that ye cannot say the Créede perfectly, which were a foule blotte: or which is worse, that ye purposely leaue them out, like the wise men, that vse not greatly to shewe that, that maketh against them.
For, the popishe doctrine is so flatte diuerse wayes, against the death of Christ: that it quite taketh away the vertue and effect therof.
And therefore the Papistes séeke to be saued, by so many meanes besides.
But whether ye leaue it out for this, or any other priuier cause or open: remitte it to your owne purgation, and to other mens coniectures.
And the twelfth, that he shall come to iudge the quicke and the deade.
Thus againe haue ye left out an other Article, that hee sitteth at the right hand of God the father almightie.
Which is also materiall, in the controuersie betwene vs of your transubstantiation, whiche errour as it cleane confuteth, so it argueth you to be the very Eutichians, your selues, as is alreadie proued out of Theodoretus.
More things are to be noted about this your dealing in in the common Crede, only nowe note, but these your shamefull omissions, and that not once, nor twice, but thrice: and that in principall matters in controuersie, and all in reciting euen the common Creede, which almost euery childe with vs of any discretion (thankes be to God) can say without booke, and you master Stapleton, a shorne priest, a Bacheler of law, a student in diuinitie, a writer of Louaine, a translator of bookes, a doctours proctour, a defender of a quondam Abbot, one that not onely will teache and controll all other, but crake that ye will bring a Bishop to his Cathechisme, and teache him his Créede, and cannot say the common Creede aright your selfe, but make so many scapes: surely, and ye were a boy againe in Winchester schole, ye were well worthie so many lashes, as ye haue left out wordes, and as well layde on, as the wordes are weightie and materiall.
Ye may escape the lashes nowe ye be adultus, but and ye were a doltus to, ye can not escape the shame.
On the other part, if ye say ye left these articles out of purpose, and not of such truandly ignorance, euen where of purpose ye went aboute to leaue out no article, and yet left oute so manye: howe was not then your witting purpose, euen a wilfull refusall of those articles? Whereby, howe many herelies ye bewrappe your selfe withall, well nigh euery man may perceyue and iudge.
And thus with too narrow sitting of small matters in other men, for the defence of M. Feckenham: ye haue not onely not hurte the~, nor helped him any thing, but brought your selfe into the same and greater briers than he was in, and can not ridde your handes of them, either without blemishe of many Heresies, for wilfull omitting such weighty matters, and that so nere points in controuersie, forseing that those articles were against your errours: or els (not to presse ye so sore, yet at the least to impute all to ignorance or retchelesse foreslouth) it is a foule fault in so great a student, and the greater foyle, the more ye take vppon you to controll the Apologie of so many excellent learned and famous men, and will teache the Bishop his Catechisme and your selfe can not your Créede.
If M. Feckenham heare of this his defenders foyle, he will perchaunce of pitie or charitie pray for you, and haue you in his Pater noster, that God would make ye a better scholler, or a wiser man: but, and he would followe mine aduice, ye shoulde neuer come into his Créede, since ye can not say your owne.
Now M. Stapl. crie out and yell vppon vs, that we be Heretikes, so loude as ye can, if for very shame ye can open your mouth at all.
Ye say ye ca~ do it to vs, that with more colourable matter than (we) haue, either to make M. Feckenham a Donatiste or that (our) Apologie hath to make that worthie and learned cardinall Hosius a Swenkfeldian.
thinke so euen in déede M. St. that ye may crie out vppon vs with more colourable matter.
For other matter than colourable, to crie out vppon vs for Heretikes, haue ye none.
But since it is but your painted colours, and not any matter at all in déede, the more ye crie out, the more ye shew your shame.
Cardinall Hosius, whome ye so much commende, the matter wherwith he is charged to be a Swenkfeldian, or worse than a Swe~kfeldian, is no colourable matter, but apparant, confessed by him selfe.
And if ye make M. Feckenhams case to be such as his, ye haue well helpen him vp M. St. then is this no colourable matter, that he is charged with, to be herein a Donatiste: but a very plaine and true matter.
And then is his case worse than it was before· when he of set purpose (thinking to play a wisemans parte) left out the old Testaments proufes, and therein shewed him selfe a Donatiste: doth also with Hosius deface and blaspheme both old and newe Testament, and therein shewe him selfe a Swenkfeldian also.
And thus the furder ye wade to saue M. Feckenham your client from the spotte of one Heresie, ye not onely helpe him nothing therein, but go nere to drawe him into an other.
It is best therefore M. Stapleton both for him and for your self, let him craule out him selfe so well as he can: for ye do hetherto but hinder him, and bemyre your selfe.
Which when at length belike ye beginne to perceyue: Neither (say you) do we greatly passe how the Donatistes in this point demeaned them selues, and whether they openly or priuily shunned proufes brought and deduced out of the old Testament.
Ye should haue told vs thus much before M. St. and not al this while to haue laboured so earnestly in and out with all these shiftes, onely for obiecting this practise of the Donatists to M. Feckenha~, to remoue the Bishops motiues, which now ye sée ye can not do: you say, ye greatly passe not how the Donatists in this point demeaned them selues.
And am euen of the same opinion also that ye greatly passe not of it.
But if ye tooke the Donatistes to be Heretikes in déede, and had not a certaine affinitie with them: ye would not thus after all your sturre, relent to the accusation, say, ye passe not how the Donatistes in this point demeaned them selues, since you be charged with their demeanour in this point.
Which, what is it els, than to say, ye paste not in this pointe, whether ye be Donatistes or no.
If ye had a good zeale to the truth, or your conscience were cléere of this crime: ye would rather haue saide with Hierome, Errare possum, Hereticus esse nolo.
As therefore ye confessed right now, that all your defence hitherto hath bene but colourable matter: so now ye care not in this pointe, whether ye be culpable or no.
Yea you go about to defende and cléere the Donatistes, and to post off this accusation to the Manichées.
For what meane ye els to say? In deede the Manichees denied the Authoritie of the bookes of the old law and Testament, which reade not of the Donatistes.
Yea in the very same booke and chapter by you alleaged, Petilian him selfe, taketh his proufe against the Catholikes out of the old Testament, which you know could serue him in litle steede, if he him selfe did reiect such kinde of Euidences.
This nowe shall suffice for this branche, to purge M. Feckenham that he is no Donatist, or Heretike otherwise.
How well all this suffiseth to M. Feckenh. purgation, either of the Donatistes heresie, or rather of blemishing him with other Heresies, and how good a compurgatour you haue bene, or rather a partaker of his Heresies: we must both referre to the Reader (M. Stapleton) as iudge in his co~science, to cast or aquitte M. Feckenha~ herein.
Ye thinke by cleering the Donatistes of this obiection, ye haue cléered withall M. Feckenham.
But while ye go aboute to cléere them, ye accuse S. Augustine that is their accuser, who saith, they did refuse the proufes of the old Testament.
And you say ye haue not redde it, had ye redde S. Augustine or so much as the wordes taken out of him that the Bishop citeth, and you take vppon you to answere vnto for Master Feckenhams defence, how could ye not haue redde it? but ye would slippe off the matter vnder the colour of the Manicheans refusall, bicause the Donatistes did not refuse it as they did, therefore they did not refuse it at all, whereas the Manichées did simplie and vtterly refuse the old Testament, which the Donatistes did not, but refused it like such wise men as the Papistes, when they thinke it maketh against them· and admit vrge it when they thinke it maketh for them, thus did they, and thus do you: and therfore for this handling of the old Testament ye be like the Donatistes.
But for your handling of the newe Testament ye be like the Manichées, of whome S. Augustine saith, Ipsis{que} nou Testaments, &c.
And they so reade the sentences of the new Testament, as though they had bene falsified, that what they lust they take from thence, and what they like not they reiect, and as though they contained not all the truth, they preferred many bookes that were Apocrypha: And saide that in their Archemanichee the promise of the Lorde Iesus Christ was fulfilled, wherevppon in his letters he called him selfe the Apostle of Iesus Christe, bicause Iesus Christe promised to sende him, and sente in him Iesus Christe.
Whiche how nere it toucheth your Popes practise, looke you to it, and cléere him of it M. Stapleton, els ye will not onely proue Donatistes am afrayde, but also Manicheans.
Thus muche then for the former motiue that the B. had to charge M. Feckenham with the Donatistes.
And if this suffise (as you say) for this branche to purge M. Feckenham, content is pleased, and so am I, let it suffise in Gods blessed name, commit it to the readers iudgement.
Concerning the other (say you) besides your falshood, your great follie doth also shew it selfe too, aswell as in the other, to imagine him to be a Donatiste.
And to thinke or say as you say they did, that Ciuill Magistrates haue not to do with Religion, nor may not punishe the transgressours of the same.
Master Feckenham saith no such thing, and suppose he thinketh no such thing.
And furder dare be bold to say that there is not so much as a light coniecture to be grounded thereof, by any of M. Feckenhams words, vnlesse M. Horne become suddenly so subtile, that he thinketh no difference to say, the Prince should not punishe an honest true man in steede of a theefe, and to say he should not punishe a theefe: or to say there is no difference betwixt all thinges and nothing.
For though M. Feckenham and all other Catholikes do denie, the ciuill Princes supreme gouernment in all causes Ecclesiasticall, yet doth not M. Feckenham nor any Catholike denie but that ciuill Princes may deale in some matters Ecclesiasticall, as Aduocates and Defenders of the Churche, namely in punishing of Heretikes, by sharpe lawes.
Vnto the whiche lawes, Heretikes are by the Church first giuen vp, and deliuered, by open excommunication and condemnation.
Here first as ye did in the other motiue, so againe ye charge the Bishop with falshood and folly, but take héede M. Stapleton the falshood and follie light not on your owne pate, as it did in the other.
Whether it be follie in you or crafte, let other déeme: certainely falshood it is, that when ye come to the setting downe of the Bishops wordes in a distincte letter, ye dare not for both eares on your head, set downe the full wordes of the Bishop, nor of S. Augustine, nor yet of the Donatistes, whereby it might haue bene knowne, what the Donatistes attributed or denied to Princes, and how néere, or how farre, ye had come vnto, or diffred from them.
Thus durst ye not do, and thus should ye haue done, which argueth your owne falsehood.
But ye turne the catte into the panne, and say, that the Donatistes saide, Ciuill magistrates haue not to do with religion, nor may not punishe the transgressours of the same, but (say you) M. Fecke~ham saith no such thing and you suppose he thinketh no such thing, and furder ye dare be bolde to say there is not so much as a light coniecture to be grounded thereof by any of M. Feckenhams wordes, and hereon you conclude him to be no Donatiste.
Now since ye will be thus bolde for M. Feckenham as to enter into his thought, ye should not haue bene afrayde with the Byshop, to haue set downe his playne written wordes, or so muche as the full content therof.
Did ye feare they would bite ye? in déede they woulde haue shewed you to haue bene a Donatist, they would haue shewed howe ye haue altered the Donatistes refusall, and S. Augustines complaynt on them, to make it séeme you were none.
Ye saye M. Feckenham and you graunt, Princes may deale with matters ecclesiasticall.
Haue not your selfe confessed, that they ranne for succour to Iulianus the Apostata, and highly commended him? And ye knowe in Cecilians controuersie, that they refused not the Emperours dealing, till he delte still agaynst them, and therfore, as you say, you do not, no more did they simply denie, that princes might deale in matters of religion.
Ye should therfore haue adioyned the wordes that the Byshop reciteth out of S. Augustine, howe, and after what manner they denied their dealing in matters of religion, and punishment of heretikes.
Whether they denyed it as you d, that they should not dealing as supreme gouernours, as punishers by their owne authoritie, yea or no, for this you denie.
Now that Princes had and tke vpon them, and oughte to haue this kinde of dealing, the Bishop proued out of S. Augstine, that magistrates and rulers ught to reforme the~, to reduce them to the vnitie of the Church, and to represse their heresies with their authoritie and godly lawes made for that purpose, to who~ it belonged of duetie, and whose speciall seruice to Christ, is to see, care and prouide, that their subiectes be gouerned and maynteined in the true and sincere religion of Christ, without all errors, superstitions and heresies.
This was the maner of the Princes dealing then with religion, and this you now denie to Princes, to deale on this wise· And on this fashion saide the Donatistes.
The seculer Princes haue not to deale in matters of religion or causes eccl.
That God committeth not the teaching of his people to kings, but to Prophets.
Christ sent not souldiors, but fishers, to bring in, and further his religion.
Pretending the ordering and disposing of all eccl. causes to be in the Clergie, and by the Clergie they ment them selues.
As you do likewise when ye say, heretikes· are by the Churche giuen vp, and deliuered.
By the Churche, that is, say you, onely by vs that are the Priests.
Heretikes ye say are first giuen vp by the Churche, vnto the ciuill Princes sharpe lawes: do ye not héere make your selues onely the Churche? Yea do ye not make these two distincte members, the Church that giueth them vp, and the Prince, to whose sharpe lawes the partie condemned is giuen vp, and so exclde the Prince from the Church, as no member at all therof? And héerein ye agrée, or rather are worsse than they.
So that still the similitude holdeth, betwéene M. Feckenham and the Donatists, bothe of them refusing the olde Testament for the proofe of Princes supreme gouernement.
Yea although the Donatists had gone further than the Papistes do, where in déede the Papists go further than did the Donatistes, what soeuer liberalitie ye pretende to giue Princes to deale in religion, wherin ye dare be bolde, ye say.
But yet for all that M. St. be not ouer bolde, in allowing Princes a dealing in religion, for feare your friendes (that allow not Princes so muche as to talke of religion) count your boldnesse, to procéede of Bayards blindnesse.
Although your self espying by by your ouer hardie and hastie boldnesse, step backe agayn, and so qualifie this your bolde graunt of Princes dealing in some eccl. matters, that in conclusion, ye say as the Donatistes saide, or rather giue Princes lesse than they did, either making them the enrichers of your coafers, whiche ye terme by the name of aduocates or defenders of the Church, or else the executioners of your crueltie, and to deale not one ioe further.
Which béeing no ecclesiasticall matters at all (excepte to defende or put a man to death be an eccl. matter) your bold graunt, that they should deale in some eccl. matters, is so cunningly resolued, that whe~ all co~mes to al, they shal deale in none at all, but onely be the defenders or executioners of them that are the onely dealers ther with.
Thus do ye play in words mockholiday with Christian princes.
Do ye think (M. St.) that Christian princes did nothing else, nor had any other authoritie but this, in punishing the Donatistes in S. Augustines time? the wordes of S. Augustine are agaynst you, the story of Cecilians cause dothe confute you, yea, euen the ning refusall of the Donatistes sheweth the plain
And thinke you if princes had at that time no fher authoritie to punishe the Donatistes, than ye limit princes now, that the Donatists would haue refused and cried out vpon the Emperors authoritie therein, if they had béene but the onely executours of the fathers iudgementes? Naye, they woulde then haue cryed, that the fathers, as principall, had had nought to doe therein, and that the Princes were misruled by the fathers, and that the fathers had made the Princes their executioners: Thus no doubte would they, and néedes muste they haue cried, if they woulde haue cried out at all; presupposing Princes had then no more to doe in matters of religion· than the fathers woulde permitte, appoynt, and allowe them, as you order Princes nowe.
But the Donatistes cryed not out so, nor in déede they could, but they cried out chiefly agaynst the authoritie of the Princes: it argth then the Prince had the chiefe authoritie, to st foorth the true religion, and to suppress theirs, all other heresies, and not the fathers and Byshops· Nowe what difference is tere betweene your crie and the Dies? VVhy? say you, is there no difference betweene al things, and nothing.
For who sayth the Prince hath, or maye haue the doing of all thing? obiecte it to them that say so.
We say, the Prince hath vnder God the supreme gouernement ouer all things ecclesiasticall.
That is to say, to ouersée and direct, that all thinges be duetifully done by them, to whom they belong.
Nowe in this behalfe, you giue the Prince not so muche as any something, but bare nothing, vnder a name of something.
Whether then it be something, or it be nothing, ye still are lyke the Donatistes about this matter in euery thing.
Is there no difference (say you) to say the Prince shoulde not punishe an honest true man stead of a thiefe, and to say, he should not punishe a Yes for soothe, M. Stap. there is a great difference.
But dothe this example also make any thing agaynst the Princes supreme authoritie, in dealing in ecclesiastical matters? Go too then, let this stande for an example.
As the Prince, though the right of his authoritie stretche not so farre, that he should punishe an honest true man, in steede of a thiefe, yet, to punishe a thiefe, he hath authoritie: so although the right of the christian Princes authoritie stretch not so far, that he should punish a true and faythful Christian in stéede of a false théeishe Christian: thiefe in this behalfe is he that followeth not the doctrine of Christ, of whom he saith, Omnes qui venerunt ant me fures sunt, latrones· All that came before me were theeues and robbers, bicause they rob God of his glory) yet to punishe the very thiefe he hath authoritie.
Nowe, M. Stapl. by what authoritie dothe the Prince punishe the thiefe, dothe he not punishe him by his owne supreme authoritie next to God? you will saye, he punisheth him by his lawes.
But who maketh the lawe forcible, doth not (next vnder God) the Princes supreme authoritie? Yea, what though the Prince him selfe sat not on him, nor pronounced the sentence, nor executed the punishement of the thiefe, yet is not all this done, by theirs, to whome these offices appertayne, but by the Princes supreme authoritie.
The Prince is not the Iudges executioner, but the Iudge and the officer are the Princes.
If then your similitude holde, euen there where it shoulde principally holde, and in the matter in controuersie betwéene vs, then that authoritie, that the Prince hath to punishe spirituall theeues, Idolaters, heretikes, false Prophetes. &c. is next vnder God, his owne supreme authoritie.
And though he him selfe pronounce not the sentence on the heretike, nor execute the punishment of him, yet is it done by his supreme authoritie: Nor the Prince is the Clergies executioner, but the Clergie therin and the officers, are rather the Princes executioners.
Thus ye sée howe your owne similitude directly and playuely applied, maketh cleane agaynst you.
Now for the testimoies that the byshop citeth out of S. Aug. to open and confue the practises of the Donatistes, which should hau shewe how like your doing had bene to theirs: as though ye heard not on that ide, or as though ye would counterfeit the wise man your selfe, that vseth not greatly to shew that that maketh agaynst him, ye quite omit them, saying: As for S. Augustines testimonies they nothing touche M. Feck. and therfore we will say nothing to them, but keepe our accustomable tale with you.
Ye do wel to call your answere a tale, for ye haue hitherto tolde a faire tale, and a well told tale, and therfore pray ye, M. Stap. tell on your tale, till ye haue redde vs out this worthy chapter.
And sée that the residue of your tale be accustomable (as say) to this ye haue hitherto tolde vs. The.
THe Bishop (for that M. Feck. with the Donatists) refuseth the proues of the olde Testament or Princes supreme gouernment) ioyneth with Saint Aug. agaynst the Donatists and the Papists, alleaging out of S. Augus. many sentences: first, to proue this to be the verie dutie and speciall seruice of Princes vnto God, to haue an especiall care, diligence and ouersight, to see Gods lawes and true Religion set forth and kept, and to punish and remoue all things to the contrary.
Secondly, to confute this refusall of the Donatists and Papists, besides the foresayde proues and examples, hée alleageth ote of Saint Augustine the examples of the King of Niniue, of Darius, of Nabuchodonozor and others: prouing thereby, that the Histories and testimonies cited out of the olde Testament, are partly figures, and partly Prophecies of the power, dutie and seruice, that Kings shoulde owe and performe in like sort, to the furtheruce of Christes religion, in the time of the newe Testament.
First he laboureth to restraine all the testimonies of Saint Augustine, onely to punishing of Heretikes.
Secondly he laboreth to proue that these testimonies make agaynst vs. Thirdly he goeth about once againe, by the Bishops illation on these testimonies, to clere master Fecenham of the crime that the Bishop charged him with, for refusing the examples of the olde testament.
First he gathereth a contract and summe of all these testimonies, to the which he yeldeth.
Secondly, he sheweth that this was his olde and former opinion.
And first of all he sayth: o, now haue we mo testimonies out of Saint August.
to proue that, for the which he hath alleaged many things out of S. Aug. already, and the which no man denieth.
For what else proueth all this out of S. Aug. bothe nowe and before alleaged, but that christian Princes ought to make lawes and constitutions (euen as M. Horne him selfe expoundeth it. fol.
b) for the furtherance of Christes religion? Are ye afrayde M. Stap. to be oppressed with the number of testimonies? What man, and your cause be good, the mo the merier they say: but bicause your cause is noughte, the fewer belike with you the better fare: althoughe by your leaue ye make a pretie lye in the beginning, to say that he alleageth these testimonies of S. Augustine, to proue that, for the whiche he hathe alleaged many thinges out of S. Augustine already.
For, the abouesayde allegations were directed to detecte the Donatistes, in refusing the Princes authoritie, and the examples of the olde Testament, and to sée howe like to theirs, your dealings to Princes, and your refusall of the same examples were.
But these testimonies present, are to confirme the Princes authoritie, and the examples of the olde Testament, for Princes, agaynst both Donatistes and Papistes deniall of their authoritie, and refusall of thexamples.
But let this passe, sithe whatsoeuer those or these be, ye say no man denieth them.
For what else (say you) proueth all this out of S. Aug. bothe nowe and before alleaged, but that Princes oughte to make lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes religion? this thing no Catholike deieth.
Meane ye playne dealing and speake ye in good sadnesse St? dothe no Catholike denie, nor no man denie, that Princes may make lawes for the furtheraunce of Christes religion How chaunce then you runne from the obedience of your own naturall most gratious soueraigne, that maketh so godly lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes religion? denie that she hath authoritie to make any lawes and co~stitutions in that behalfe, but that she must onely be obedient to your Popes and his Priests lawes and constitutions? And for this matter, ye compile the moste of your works.
And now ye say, no ma~ nor catholike denieth it.
By this rule you be no catholikes, that ye crake so much of.
Nay ye be no men neither, for it is moste euident that ye chiefly denie this thing.
And your selfe in your Preface, make it to be the moste principall controuersie of all other, and most to be denied.
If ye be a true Catholike, and a true man, deale playnly, For no doubt, ye meane that there is a padde in the srawe.
Ye haue a knacke in your budget, whereby ye thinke ye may well graunt this, whiche for shame in open wordes ye dare not denie but graunte.
And yet ye thinke we shall haue no more holde by your graunte, than he that holdeth a wette Ele by the tayle.
For in the ende, ye come in with suche a qualification: as all the worlde may perceiue a flatte deniall thereof.
And yet at the firste blushe, no man woulde thinke, but that the matter betwéene vs and you were full concluded.
We say, all the authoritie that the Quéene hath is onely to this ende in effecte, that she oughte thereby to make lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes religion.
This (say you) no man denieth, but that they oughte to make lawes and co~stitutions, for the furtherance of Christes religion.
Héere you agrée with vs, to a simple playne dealing mans iudgement.
But what will your good masters at Louaine, and your friendes with vs say to you, when they shall heare of this graunt? they wil affirme with one voyce that they vtterly denie it, and aske ye, howe ye haue defended master Feckenhams quarell.
Tushe will you say to them, holde your peace sirs, all is wel inough, there was no remedie but must néedes grasit to S. Augustines words, they were so manyfest, and so pressed, that there was no helpe but to graunt it, yea and to beare downe the matter that no bodie denied it.
But haue such a distinction for it, that they shalbe neuer the néere, for all my graunt.
Did ye neuer réede (may ye say to them) the practise of Arrius? that whe~ he was so vrged, that he could not denie it: he yelded to the true beleuers, and wrote also, as haue done, deposing that he beléeued as he had written: but when his co~plices herefore exposulated with him, he declared to them, that for all the shewe of his grant in wordes, in déede he had graunted nothing.
He saide, he beleeued as he had written, and looke here quoth he (pulling a paper out of his bosome contayning his Heresie) this is the writing to the which referred my wordes.
And so may you say to your friendes M. Stap. true in déede haue graunted, that both you denie not this, that the Quéene ought to make lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes Religion.
And if ye marke it, all this matter lies in this worde furtherance.
told not as yet how farre nor how much, nor how litle, this furtherance stretcheth.
Do ye not know that euery thing, that ye any whitte, be it neuer so little, is yet a furtherance? and euery thing yekes quoth the wrenne when she pist in the sea, as the old Prouerbe faith: and euen as much furtherance in this matter (as you shall sée me bring it aboute) haue graunted Princes, and ye know as good neuer a whit as neuer the better.
They shalbe neuer the better for this my graunt, no more than when made them like the Heathen Princes.
Onely now, being pressed, it standeth me vppon, to alter my wordes, and giue them a Title of furderance for a clawe, but so cunningly handled, that they can go no furder than we allow them.
And so may ye turne this furtherance to their hindrance, as you shall perceyue anon will you say.
In the meane season, ye enter solemnly into your seconde parcell, to confirme this your straunge graunt, that might otherwise séeme newes to your fréendes and to vs, saying: And for my parte M. Horne, that you may not thinke haue now bene first so aduised vppon sight of your booke, haue forced that argument with many examples of godly Emperours and Princes in my Dedicatorie Epistle to the Queenes Maiestie, before the translated historie of the venerable Bede.
It seemeth ye want good neighbours M. St. at Louaine, that thus are driuen to set out your worthie volumes.
But belike they take you, if ye haue saide as much there as ye haue done here, to be a false dissembler, pretending in cloked wordes a furderance, and in déede minding none but rather an empayring of their estate: and so perhappes ye may go beyonde them all.
And thinking eatly to defeate vs, suppose that your fréendes will like well of this daliance, and that we poore soules can not see how trimme ye daunce naked in a nette.
Yes M. Stapleton thankes be to God our eyes be not so dimme, but we may sée this disobedience, yea all the worlde may see it.
And no man could espie it except it were declared, your selfe will open your falshood, ye can not kéepe your owne councell, but by and by bewray al your former graunt of making lawes and constitutions and all the Princes furtherance therein, in conclusion to come to nothing, or as good as nothing, or rather worse, if worse may be, than nothing.
Augustines wordes force nothing els but that Christian Princes may make lawes to punishe Heretikes, and ought to fortifie the Decrees of the Priestes with the execution of the secular power, when obstinate Heretikes will not otherwise obey.
Lo Masters mine, may ye say, to your fellowes M. Stapleton, now ye neede not feare that graunted ouer much to Princes, when denied not but that they might and ought to make lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes religion, and yet is nothing lost from our Popes religio~ by this graunt, yea thus it serueth our turne very well say you.
In deede M. Stapleton if ye can bring all your iolie mightie graunt to this: if ye can thus quickly hwite a post to a puddingpricke: will say also with you, ye haue turned it so well, that ye haue made it serue your turne very well.
And that so well, that God wote, of all these lawes· constitutions, and furtherance here is nothing left at al, the qualifying of your graunt hath taken it cleane away.
For, if should replie, that though ye haue taken away the making of lawes and constitutions, for the setting forth of Christes religion, yet haue ye left to Princes, lawes for punishing Heretikes, if they see any Bishops or Priestes that be teachers of false doctrine, they may call them before them, they may examine them, and if they finde them suche, they may by their lawes depose them, or otherwise punishe them: Fye, no no, will you replie, ye are quite deceyued man, Gods forode, that shoulde haue graunted Princes to make lawes, for punishing Heretikes on that fashion, then as good haue graunted all vnto them.
Nay (will you say) ye should haue marked what followed, and how cunningly and warily limited their making of lawes.
saide they ought to fortefie the decrees of the Priestes.
Which argueth that the Priestes, not the Princes, must make in very déede all the lawes of punishment.
And (wte ye well) if they make them, they be no babes, they can tell on which side their bread is buttred, they will so make them, that they will kéepe them selues harmelesse, be ye sure.
But softe M. Stapleton, saide ye not the Prince muste make lawes· yes, but the Priestes must decree them, say you, then a Gos name let the Prince make them, when the Priestes haue decreed them.
In there ye went beyonde me an ace, M. Stapleton.
But go to, yet the Princes (ye say) ought to fortifie the decree that is to say, they must establish and giue force by their royall authoritie, vnto that the Priestes haus decreed to be conuenient, and otherwise it is not of force.
Nay, in any case (will you say) beware that, meane not so, but thus declare my meaning furder, they shall fortifie the Priestes decree, with the execution of the seculer power, that is to say, by their riches, armies, swordes, and might, they shall put to death, or fight against, such as we Priests (that be the Churche, shall decree and appoint them, being seculer.
what is all this? this is nothing (in plain Englishe) but to make Princes your very butchers, tormentours, and slaughtermen.
Nay (say you) they shall not do thus much neither, when they will, but if ye marke, saide in the ende for fayling, when obstinate Heretikes will not otherwise obey, then wil we assigne Princes to hamper them.
Nowe forsoth gramercie horse, that ye can not, or will not do your selues, that ye thrust to Princes to be your drudges therein, are they not well holpen vp by this your liberall offer? they are much beholding to you for so large a charter.
The texte of your graunt gaue much, but your glosse takes all away againe.
But Maledicta glassa· (say I) qu corrumpit textum: all be shrewd be that glosse, that corruptes the text, so long as ye limite your text with such a glose, ye may giue your graunt to what Princes ye shall, a faire catche they shall haue thereof.
They ought (saith your graunt) to deale in Ecclesiasticall matters, and make lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes religion.
That is to wete (saith your glosse) to let the Priestes make all decrees, and they with their swordes, villes, bowes, and gunnes, to lay on, and strike, onely when the Priests bid them, and those onely whome the Priestes appoint to be slaine.
Now forsoth and forsoth M. St. this is a proper dealing of Princes in Ecclesiasticall causes, and a goodly kinde of making lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes religion.
Well whatsoeuer it be, this is all they are like to haue of you, and yet will ye kéepe touche with them in your graunt to.
But thinke ye M. St. was this all that princes ought to do? and nothing else but to punish heretikes on this fashion? nothing else, say you, for that was in deede the very occasion why S. Aug. wrote all this.
a M. St. then perceyue S. Aug· wrote something more, than ye would perticulerly answere vnto.
Well say you, what soeuer he wrote, this was the very occasion whie he wrote it, to make lawes for punishing Heretikes, and nothing else.
How M. St? to make the Emperor that then was, none other dealer in their punishment, than your Pope maketh the Emperour now? or than your Prelates made Q. Marie of late your executioner, and the Nobilitie your droyles, whome soeuer ye determine to prick, by your exco~munication condemnation? what fooles were the Donatists then, to crie out vpon the Emperour? This were like the furie of the angrie Dogge, that being bitte with a stone, wreaketh his anger vpon the stone, and not on him that hurled it.
What fellon is offended with the executioner, or layeth his death to the beheaders charge, when the Prince commaundeth to behead him: but to the Prince? But in this case you are the Princes, that are the Priests, and the Prince is but, as it were the stone in your bande, is but the executioner of your sentence.
Why should the Donatists then haue blamed the Prince, except the Prince then had beene, not the Priestes instrument, but euen the principall in making lawes of punishment for them? And so did Saint August.
He decréed not lawes, for the Emperour to put in execution, but desired the Emperour to reforms them, by suche sharpe lawes as séemed best to himselfe.
And although this were the verie occasion (as ye say) why Saint Augustine wrote all this, Yea, though it were the onely occasion to, of writing all that he wrote: what is that to this purpose? For whatsoeuer the occasion were, the occasion is not vrged, but the wordes that he wrote.
The occasion of Saint Augustines wryting (ye saye) was the punishing of the Donatists.
And yet woulde Saint Augustine so haue written, thoughe they had béene other Heretikes.
Whie? bycause hys prooues are generall, whatsoeuer were the occasion.
And yet his occasion was not onely aboute the punishing of the Donatists, for the Donatists denyed more than hys authoritie in punishing them, they denyed hys authoritie to ette foorth the true Religion, and to ouersee that it bee in all estates duely preserued.
This sayde they, was committed to Fishers, not to Souldiours, to Prophets, not to Kinges, as you nowe saye the lyke, it was committed to the Apostles and Priestes, not to Kings.
This was another verie occasion also, and many other besydes might be, whie Saint Augustine wrote all this.
But what is this All this that ye speake vppon? pray ye tell vs at least the summe of all this that saint Augustine wrote.
And then shall we sée, if it be all none other, but lawes, of punishment for Heretikes, that he layde and ment, or no.
And whether you haue hitherto truly sayde and ment or no, all your falsehoode will then appeare.
Let vs here therefore resume some of those Testimonies of Saint Augustine.
God dothe inspire (sayth he) into Kinges, that they shoulde procure, the commaundement of the Lorde to be performed or kept in their Kingdoms.
Is this onely master Stapleton for punishing of Heretikes? Againe, In that hee is also a King, hee serueth in making lawes of conuenient force, for to commaunde iust things, and to forbidde the contrarie.
Is this onely ment of lawes to punishe Heretikes? Againe, The Ensample of the King of Niniue that it apperteyned to the Kinges charge, that the Niniuites shoulde pacifie Gods wrath.
Was thys onely mente of making lawes, for punishing Heretikes? What Heretikes were in Niniue? Heathen Idolaters there were store, but of Heretikes we read none.
And who made the decree of their fasting and repentance? not the Prophete: he onely denounced the wrath and iustice of God: nor highe Priest of Aarons order was there any among them, that the Scripture mencioneth.
Idolatrous Priestes no doubt they had more than ynowe, but the lawe of that Ecclesiasticall discipline, was not set out by them, but by the King.
Generally to conclude, Saint Augustine sayth: that the auncient actes of the godly Kinges, mencioned in the Propheticall Bookes, were figures of the lyke factes to bee done by the godlye Princes, in the tyme of the newe Testament.
Were nowe these theyr doynges and auncient actes, nothing else but lawes and constitutions, for punishing Hereykes, and false teachers? Were all the constitutions and doyngs of Moyses, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Iosaphat, Ezechias, Iosias, and others, nothing else Master Stapleton, but this? good GOD, that euer any that shoulde professe the studie of diuinitie, shoulde be founde so false and shamelesse, not onely thus to dallie with Princes, but also to delude the fathers and the Scriptures, and all to enfringe and takeaway the Princes interest and authoritie.
Nowe that ye haue thus in your first part brought the matter about, giuing a graunt in wordes, and expounding the wordes, haue taken away the graunt againe: ye enter into your seconde part, to set a fresh on vs, as ye did in your former Chapter, would make these testimonies of S. Aug. to serue against vs, which ye go about two maner of ways.
First, hauing nowe abridged the princes authoritie to nothing else, but to make lawes to punish Heretikes, ye crie out vpon vs that we be the heretikes, and that they must punish vs· Secondly, ye woulde proue that we be the Heretikes, to be punished, for denying euen this title to Princes of punishing Heretikes.
And for the first part ye say: But nowe that master Horne may not vtterly leese all his labour herein, let vs see howe these matters do truely and trimly serue agaynst his deare brethren and master Foxes holy Martyrs.
Here is all made sure on euery side, euery way preuented, least the poore elie Protestants shoulde escape your violence, by any starting hole.
First, you your selues our enemies, will onely haue the making of the decrées and lawes, what shall be true religion, what shall be false.
Secondly, the Prince shall haue nothing to doe in examining the matter betwéene vs, who haue in déede the true religion, who haue the false: but they must beléeue before hand, that that which you shall say against vs, is al and only true, and all that we replie is starke false.
Thirdly, the Prince must not condemne vs, but you our enemies and accusers, must sit vppon vs and condemne vs. Fourthly, the Prince must, as you bid him, put vs to death, and for more assuraunce to catche vs, ye giue him this libertie, that he may make any lawe to attache vs, to emprison vs, to heade, hang, or burne vs. Prouided alway, that this lawe be nothing else but for punishment, and that of those that you appoint, and will crie ou vpon for heretikes, and to deale no further.
Here is all things made sure against the poore protestantes.
Who séeth not, that euen as shéepe appointed to the slaughter, they must néedes die, if you but please to bid the prince to kill them, they must néedes be heretikes, if once you call them so And now that ye haue brought your matters to this passe, let vs sée how ye cry out against vs. VVe say with S. Aug. (say you) that princes may punish wicked deprauers of religion.
maister St. that ye woulde stande to your word say as S. Aug· did.
But it may be, ye will say it with S. August.
but will ye also meane it with S. Augustine, for there is litle trust to your saying without your meaning.
Ensample right now, of your last graunt, wherein you spared not to belie S. Aug. if ye meane with S. Aug. plainly, that Princes may punish wicked deprauers of religion, as did the Emperour in S. Augustines time: there is then yet good hope of equitie, that you shall not be your owne Iudges, and our condemners to.
But the Prince shall appoint delegates vprightly betwéene vs both, yea the matter maye come to be hearde and discussed before the prince himselfe, and to bée iudged of him, who are in the right, who are in the wrong: for thus did the Emperour in S. Augustines time, and S. Augustine lyked well of it, but of all things you cannot abide this, and yet ye boast for fashion sa, that ye saye with S. August.
But ye adde withall at the harde héeles thereof, And we further saye that you are those.
Whereby ye signifie howe farre ye will allowe their punishing.
And that the prince and all must be ruled by your bare saying, for ye alleage no reason or argument to preue it, but onely auouch it, saying: And wee further saye that you are those.
As though your bare so saying, were full proofe of the matter, and reason good inough, to cause the prince to punish vs.
But if the Prince take that ye haue graunted hym, to punishe the wicked deprauers of religion, as Saint Augustine sayeth he ought, and the Emperour then did: then so fast as you shall saye that wee are those, we will also, not saye onelye, but prooue, that you are those.
And a righteous Prince will punishe as he séeth prooues, and not as he heareth onely sayings.
Nowe therfore if ye will say with S. Augustine thus, tell on your tale hardilye, and we feare not your malice.
VVe say with Saint Augustine (say you) that Christian Princes maye make a decree, ye of death, as did Nabuchodonozor against the blasphemers of God, and carefully prouide that God and his Sacraments be not lightly contemned.
This is well sayde of you master Stapleton, and euen the same with tongue and heart say we, and haue proued it alreadie with many ensamples.
But you say it from the teeth outwarde, howe chaunce else that ye sayde not thus much before? Yea howe chaunce ye sayde that Saint Augustine ment no more but of their lawes for punishing Heretikes? Here are lawes for blasphemers also.
And though euery Heretike be a blasphemer, yet is not euery blasphemer an Heretike.
And ye knowe Nabuchodonozors lawe was not of Heretikes, but of Heathen blasphemers.
And yet besides the l. of their punishing, howe chaunce ye forgot also this part of their authoritie, carefully to prouide that God and ic Sacraments be not lightly contemned? Is all this carefull prouiding, nothing else but punishing Heretykes? yes master Stapleton it importeth muche more, and euen as muche as we ascribe to Princes, and as the Quéenes Maiestie taketh on hir.
And nowe that yee haue once againe graunted thus muche to Princes: spare not a Gods name to charge vs with the worst ye can, onelye stande you to your tackling, as we wyll stande to ours.
VVe say (say you) you are as great blasphemers as euer the Church of Christ had.
How proue ye that M. Stap. say we? why say you, we say so, and that is proufe good ynough for vs.
In déede it is proufe good ynough for you, yea the best proufe that ye haue.
For bad ye any better knowe ye woulde not spare to lay it in our dishe.
But remember master Stapleton, that yee haue giuen the Prince that authoritie of punishing blasphemers, that Saint Augustine gaue to the Emperour in his time.
That is to wete, not to punish he wottes not what, but by his authoritie eyther to appoynt Delegates, or himselfe to sit and here the tryall, and iudge who are the blasphemers, and who are not.
So that nowe your saying we be, will not serue yuo in stéed, vnlesse ye proue your saying.
Else might we put it to a double post, and say passe to you, you are greater blasphemers, yea the greatest blasphemers, that euer the Churche of Christ had.
And to proue it not onely on you, but euen of your head also, your holy father the Pope: whose blessed lippes can they blaspheme trow you? praye ye remember who sayde, he woulde eate Porke despetto de do, euen in dispite of GOD.
But let this blasphemous Porkeling go, and say you on master Stapleton.
VVe say (say you) you be they that haue contemned Christes sacraments, making of seuen two, and vsing those two after such a sort, that the olde prouerbe may (the more is the pittie) in a maner take place, as good neuer a whitte as neuer the better.
Here is still nothing but we say, to aunswere therefore we say, with we say: we say agayne, that you are those Sophisters that by the arte of multiplication, whereof ye spake in your Preface, haue learned muche more comning than had the scholler of Oxeforde that woulde make thrée egges of two, you will make seuen of two, and comming out with your fiue egges (as the Preuerbe also sayth) euery one of them are rotten: making of two Sacraments seuen.
But fiue of them are of your owne hatching, Cocks, egges without yolkes, no sacraments at all.
And two of them, the one, baptisme fowly prophaned, the other hurled quite away, and an Idoll (euen by your owne definition of an Idoll) put in place.
This lay we to your charge, proue vs lyers and ye can.
And to that ye say we contemne Christs Sacraments, we briefly say againe ye say vntruth, except ye can proue we do so.
VVe say further (say you) that not onely the generall Councell of Trent, but that the whole Churche hath condemned your opinions, by generall and nationall Councels many hundreth yeares since.
VVe say further also, that as your Councell of Trent, so did the Priests, the Lawyers, Scribes, and Pharises, assemble togither held a councell against Christ in his absence, and Caiphas gaue iudgement on him, that one man (meaning Christ) should die for the people.
And so hath your Trident Councell in their absence condemned Christ in his members.
The residue of your saying is but your lying vaunt of the whole Church, where in deede ye meane but the popish Church· ye crake of many hundred yeares, but ye tel not howe many they be, nor what is condemned, nor by who~, nor where, nor when, nor what Councell generall nor prouinciall, but carie away the matter in generalities.
But we say to you againe in generall speach, that not onely Generall and Nationall Councels haue condemned many of your doctrines many hundreth yeares since: but euen Christ him selfe and his Apostles, yea some of your owne Popes, yea some of your owne selues, habentes cauterizatam conscientiam, hauing their consciences marked with a hote iron haue condemned them.
And all this, partly hath bene alredy sufficiently, and partly shall be further prooued in particulars, as we descende thereto.
And if we go no further than the present matter and issue in hande, concerning the Princes authoritie: yea, euen with your owne mouth, or euer we haue done, ye shall yet more than once againe condemne this your owne saying, that the Princes gouernement in ecclesiasticall matters stretcheth no further, than to make lawes and constitutions to punishe heretikes.
Nowe, when ye haue thus with bare sayings, charged vs to be heretikes, ye woulde charme the Prince also in putting him in remembrance, that his dutie stretcheth not now, to stande in examining all this that ye lay to vs, nor to iudge therevpon, whether it be true or false, but on the credit of your bare honesties and words, to make forthwith some sharpe lawes of attaching, hanging, sacking, drowning, or burning vs, for condemned Heretikes, bicause you haue so called To this purpose therefore say you: And that Christian Emperours, christian Princes, as well in other countries as in Englande, especially the noble and worthie king Henry the fifte, haue made sharpe lawes, yea of death against Heresies.
VVe do not nor neuer did disalowe these their doyngs, as repugnant either to the olde or newe Testament.
VVhy then call you for this respect the Catholikes, popishe Donatistes? The Bishop called them M. St. not with Bare sayings as you haue here called vs, deprauers, blasphemers, and condemned Heretikes.
But the hath so proued his sayings, that, as ye haue hearde, all your improuinges were to no purpose, but to bring M. Feckenham more in the mire, and to proue him a greater Donatiste and your selfe also in his defence.
Ye say ye do not, nor neuer did disalowe, as repugnant to the old or new Testament, Christian Emperours and Princes doings, nor king Henry the fifte his sharpe lawes, yea of death against herefies.
If ye do not so disalowe them as repugnant, then be they conformable.
But how chance then your selfe excusing M. Feckenham, saide he omitted them bicause they made against him? if they make against him, they are repugnant to him.
And if you disalowe them not as repugnant, then are you repugnant to him, and to your owne excuse for him.
Yea, what repugnancie your wordes present do implie, or what doubtfull vnderstanding ye meane, in saying, we do not, nor neuer did, leaue to your owne expounding, whether ye meane ye did neuer, or euer, or sometimes disalowe them: and in adding, as repugnant, whether ye meane ye disalow them in other senses or
But interprete your owne sayinges as ye lust, if ye say to conster them to the beste, ye disalowe them not as repugnant, that is, ye allow them as agréeable in those doings of Princes in the olde Testament· then, as King salomon displaced Abiathar the high Priest, so may the Emperour displace the Pope, and other Princes their Bishops, when they be vnworthie of their roumes and offices.
But, besides the punishing of false teachers and Heretikes by their lawes, that ye allowe in the Princes of the old Testament, for Princes vnder the newe Testament to do the like, did they nothing els? made they no other lawes and constitutions ecclesiasticall? or do ye allow them onely for their lawes in punishments, and disalow them for all other lawes and constitutions that they made? Well, what soeuer you allow or disallow, God allowed them and liked well of them.
And therefore to all Christian Princes, they ought to be paternes to do the like, not only in zeale of punishment of heretikes, abolishing Herefi, superstitio~s, Idolatries, and all errours: but also in setting forth the true and sincere religion of Christes gospell, and ouerséeing that the Prelates and Pastours, the Nobilitie, the Magistrates, the people and all subiects what soeuer, do euery one their dutie, in receyuing and aduauncing the same.
But this ye vtterly disalowe in Princes, if they go one inche furder, than lawes of punishment of those, whom ye giue vp to them to punish, and the defence of your persons and goodes, making Princes either your waighting garde, or els your slaughtermen: and there is al, say you, that in these matters Princes haue to deale.
And for this respect, we not onely call you, but proue you popish Donatistes.
Nowe that by crying out vppon vs, you thinke ye haue fully cléered your selfe, ye enter into your other point, to burden vs with this crime of the Donatistes, euen to denie that little which you graunt vnto Princes.
Which surely were a cunning poin do, to proue that we denie with the Donatistes, that which we affirme against the Donatistes and you too.
First, we affirme that it appertayneth to the Princes supreme authoritie next vnder God, by the aduise of their godly and learned estates, to make lawes and constitutions, to punish Heretikes, ismatikes, erronious teachers, and to abolishe all their false doctrines.
And also to make lawes and constitutions for the setting forth of all true doctrine, and to appointe godly learned setters out thereof.
This say we before hande: if now you can make vs beléeue we holde the co~trary to this, that were worth the séeing.
But will ye know M. Horne (say you) who be in this point in very deede the doltish diuelish Donatistes? hearken on well, and ye shall heare.
On to M. Stapleton hitherto we heare nothing but your blacke Rhetorike not worthe the hearing, which remitting to your common place thereon, tell on your tale and we will hearken.
The Donatistes as S. Augustine reporteth saide it was free to beleeue or not to beleeue, and that faithe should not be forced.
VVas not this pray you the common song among the Lutherans in Germanie and Englande at their beginning? was not this your Apostles Luthers opinion, that no man should be compelled to the faith? and as there are many dissentions, diuisions, Scismes, betwixte you the Sacramentaries, and the Lutherans: so are you deuided also in this point.
For your Master Caluine writeth that a ma~ may lawfully and by Gods lawe be put to death for heresie, as he practised him selfe also, burning Seetus the Arian at Geneua.
Sée how your selfe beyng blinded with pure enuie M. Stapleton, while ye studie with all bitternesse of termes to deface vs to the simple, to all wise me~ ye cléere acquite vs of the crime ye obiect against vs. Ye say we are Sacramentaries and that Caluine is our Maister.
Ye say furder, that our Maister Caluine writeth, that a man may lawfully and by Gods lawe be put to death for Heresie.
aske ye here, if this were the opinion of the Donatistes? if they then saide the contrarie to vs, and we to them, then haue your selfe discharged vs of this crime, that euen contrarie to your conscience and wittingly, ye sclaunder vs with.
Which is so euident a matter, that euery man hereafter may iustly take you for a common lying sclaunderer.
Do not your selfe also complaine in many places euen of this counterblast, that we would haue the Prince execute more seueritie towardes you, and that we séeke your bloud, and such other thinges? wherein, although in that matter ye sclaunder vs, yet euen your sclaundering purgeth vs in this matter.
And do ye not say here present, we are deuided in this pointe? and so againe ye cléere vs of this crime.
But (say you) all Luthers schollers in Germanie are not so forewarde.
know not all Luthers schollers, for my parte, M. Stapleton· and ghesse you know them not all, neither.
But suppose, (as ye say) all be not so forwarde: yet if they be forwarde, they are againe discharged of this your lying crime.
Yet say you, this was Luthers opinion, and their common song in the beginning.
If slaundering were not your common song M. Stapleton ye would neuer sing thus purposely out of tune.
It is well knowne the reuerence and obedience that Luther teacheth subiects to yeld to their Princes euen to the death.
But wilfully ye peruert and wrest his wordes: he spake not of fayth simply, among professed Christians: but of some doubtes of faith.
He saide, they should not be onely forced without outwarde violence, but rather with persuasion and argumentes if it might be: if not, then the Magistrate might lawfully punishe the obstinate, for his errour or Heresie.
So he declared of Muncer and other Heretikes (séeing their peruersenesse) that the Magistrate might lawfully punish him and his adherents, yea that he ought so to do, and thereto he vehemently excited them.
This was Luthers opinion, and what fault finde you therewith.
In déede agaynst those that are Infidels, Turkes, Iewes, Heathen, or any any other not professed Christians, he sayd Christians ought not (béeing not prouoked by them) to set on their realmes, and prouoke them, onely of purpose, by force of armes, to make them become Christians.
And in this behalfe, he spake muche agaynst the foule abuses of the Pope, in his Croyses and practises aboute the Turkish warres.
But what is this to this purpose in hande? yea what is all this, either of Luther or Caluine (if there were suche diuision in this poynte betweene them, as you, like a makebate, would set, where none is) to the matter in question.
The question is, whether the Prince may punishe heretikes, and that by death.
But the Donatistes denied this, bicause (they beeing apparant heretikes) perceiued it made against them, you shoulde likewise haue proued, that Luther and Caluine, and that we were heretikes, or else it toucheth vs not at all.
For, would ye haue the Prince put to death the faythful Christian? Luther Caluine might wel (ye know) and ought to speake agaynst that.
They sawe the violent practises of you Papistes, in murthering and deuouring the poore shéepe of Christ, and can ye wite them if they co~playned therof? Ye shoulde haue first proued vs to be the heretikes.
Ye haue done so in deede, M. St. after the Popish maner, that is to say, ye haue called vs heretikes, and starke heretikes, and condemned heretikes ofte inoughe, and if that will do it.
And ye haue tolde euen right now, that ye say, we be heretikes, al to nought, with we say, and we say, on the head of it.
These sayings we haue hearde, as ye bad vs harken, but we haue hearde neuer a proofe.
Nowe what muste the Prince héere do? he not examine and searche out bothe our proofes: and punish, not the faythfull be léeuer, but whome he findeth to be the heretike? And thus, if ye wil néedes haue death the punishment, in Gods name euen death be it.
thinke ye will not be halfe so hastie: no, ye had rather (I dare say) kéepe ye still at Louayne.
Héere entreth M. St. agayne into an inuectiue agaynst M. Foxes booke.
For that booke, and the bishop of Sarisburies, are his chiefest eyesores, so that blame him the lesse, that he startleth so often at them: as all his companions and masters do besides.
For, the one for their practises, and the other for their errours, haue almost marde all their estimation with their friends.
But his by matters will not answere, only to the question now in argument.
Yea (sayth he) some of your holy martyres auouche, that the King can make no lawe to punishe any maner of crime by death, and that al suche lawes are contrarie to the Gospel.
Where finde ye this master Stapleton? this is (you will saye) an article layde vnto him that he defended.
Yea, but are you sure, master Stapleton, that he in déede defended this, as it is héere set out: and that it is not rather altogither deuised for malice, or peruerted misconstrued, as many other haue béene? the false witnesses wrested the sayings of Christ, that he should denie tribute to Cesar, that he went about to destroy the temple, &c. Yea, the title let on his crosse (if the Priestes might haue had their will) should not haue béene writte~ as it was.
The like wresting of his sayings vsed the Iewes with S. Steuen.
And in the primitiue Churche, were many articles obiected to the poore Martyres, of refusing obedience to magistrates, of licencious lyfe, of vnnaturall commixtures, of murdring and eating children.
And euen suche malicious misconstrued articles, the Papistes deuise on the Protestants: that in the meane while are gagged, nor suffred once to speake and declare their innocencie.
But blessed are you (sayth Christ) when men reuile you, and speake all euill on you for my name sake.
But you say, this is no slaunder, it is of master Foxes owne setting foorth.
graunt, M. St. he is the chronicler, setteth downe that he findeth.
Doth that argue that he acknowlegeth for true, euery such article as he setteth downe? nay, he maketh often exception to the contrarie, that many of suche articles are falsly obiected, which neuerthelesse he setteth downe.
Yea, but there is moe thinges layde vnto him than this.
By whome, M. Stap? Forsoothe euen by sir Thomas More.
Yet is this iniustly done of you master Stapleton, to charge all Protestantes with his opinion in this poynt, when they manyfestly mainteine the contrarye.
We deale not so, with you, we burden not your whole Churche (where ye openly defende the contrarie) with the seuerall iudgement of euery writer: much lesse of euery obscure author, and suche an one, as of whome we haue nothing but heresay: and that such heresay, as his aduersaries loue to reporte, and wrest, to make it odious to the hearer: this is not vpright dealing.
But yet for al this, ye can not héere vpon fasten that whiche so fayne ye would, that therfore he is a Donatist.
The Donatistes denied to Princes the punishment of heretikes, and would haue beleefe free, This man denieth neither of these.
First, his quarel was not of faith alone, but as ye tell it, for any maner of crime to be punished by death, and yet it followes no more hereon, that he woulde haue faith free, to beléeue what eche man woulde: then he woulde haue it· frée for any manner of cryme, to doe what eche man woulde.
Secondly, thoughe he denie the punishment by death, yet he denieth not, but there· graunteth, that Princes might make lawes of other kind; of punishement, which if he graunt them, your selfe cleare him of béeing a Donatist.
But leauing him ye tell vs of greater businesse concerning sir Iohn Oldecastle, who~ ye rattle vp with a susurrauit, calling him traytor and detestable Donatist.
And nowe (say you) all the weight resteth to proue this substantially to you, and to master Foxe.
And to stoppe all your froward quarellings, and accustomable elusions against our proofes.
VVell, will bring you (as thinke) a substantiall and ineuitable proofe, that is master Foxe him selfe, and no worsse man.
Héere is a lustie crake M. Stap. to bumbaste the matter withall, out of doubt we shall héere haue some great foyle.
But let vs sée what all this haynous matter is.
Forsoothe M. Foxe setteth downe the articles, that the Papistes haue composed to be sir Iohn Oldecastles articles, the tenth article whereof is this.
That manslaughter, either by warre, or by any pretended lawe of iustice, or for any temporall cause or spirituall reuelation, is expressely contrary to the new Testament, which is the lawe of grace and mercie.
Why, M. Stap. is this your substantiall and ineuitable proofe, that is, master Foxe him selfe, and no worsse man? this is none of master Foxes saying nor opinion, he dothe but write· playne and plat what soeuer articles it pleased his enimies your auncestors to deuise, in the name of Sir Iohn Oldecastles articles.
Lo thus he writeth (say you) of this worthy Champion, and that euen in his owne huge martyrologe, who doubteth but to the great exalting and amplification of this noble worke and of his noble holy martyr.
The worthy prayse of this noble worke in déede, and of this noble and holy martyr, are no whit blemished by these your sco raylings, M. St. but what kinde of argument call ye this? he reciteth this article among the rest, and therfore out of doubt he alloweth it, and sets it out to hys great exalting and amplification.
By this argument your selfe allowe the article too, for ye haue héere also recited it.
But what would ye haue sayde if he had subtracted it? and the one of the twayne he must haue done, either haue left it out, or set it out as he founde it.
But howe chaunce you lefte out that, whiche in many places of his worke M. Foxe noteth, of the Papists corrupting of those martyrs articles: yet (which is in déede to his great exalting and amplification he setteth them downe, euen as he founde them.
For, the thing, to any indifferent reader, will easily shewe it selfe.
Were this article his or not his, it proues not him a Donatist.
First, the Donatistes allowed manslaughter, thoughe vnlawfully done, as your selfe haue proued before of the Circumcelions.
But héere ye graunte that he vtterly disalloweth all manslaughter, and so ye cleare him héerein of béeing a Donatist.
Agayne the Donatistes vtterly reiected (as your selfe say) all the Princes authoritie, and all punishement in false religion.
Contrarywise Sir Iohn Oldecastle allowed their authoritie, yea ouer the Pope and his Prelates, to punishe them for their false religion.
And thoughe he disallowed manslaughter, yet can ye not gather, that he allowed no punishment for false religion.
Onlesse (as ye shewed in the dayes of your late crueltie) there be no punishement with you but manslaughter.
Whereby we maye more iustely gather that he acknowledged their authoritie, in willing Princes to punishe, thoughe not by deathe: than you can any way gather héereon, that he vtterly denied all kinde of punishement.
And if ye would deface his martyrdome for this, or cou~t it Donatisticall, of the same minde was euen sir Thomas More him selfe your owne mery martyr (whome ye cited to witnesse a fewe lynes before) as appeareth in his Vtopia, although more couertly, yet he quite disaloweth manslaughter, and deuiseth other punishments in stead thereof.
Is he therefore a Donatiste? And pray you, what was all the auncient order in banishing heretikes, was it death? or were they Donatistes then, bicause they allowed not punishment by death? So was S. Augustine a Donatiste also, whome ye cite agaynst the Donatistes.
For it was long or euer he came to this opinion, that the Donatistes might be slayne, and vpon what considerations, wil shew you out of that learned clarke Erasmus, who for this matter also, had great conflict with your Sorbonistes.
denie (saythe he) that euer readde that Byshoppes sholude haue stirred vp Kinges to kyll Heretikes.
For, this is not to warne Princes in generall, but to appoynte oute vnto them a kynde of punishement.
But speake in my reprehension, not of these tymes, but of Sainct Augustine, and the Byshoppes of his age.
For, nowe certayne Abbotes and Byshoppes thinke it a moste acceptable sacrifice to God, if they may kyll a great many with their owne sworde, and their owne hande.
And to confesse the truthe, in that they tell howe Sainct Augustine was first of that opinion, that he denied the Emperoures power to be called vpon, but when he sawe the heresie succeeded, he changed his mynde: euen so is it as true that wrote.
But then had they to do with Donatistes, that were more than heretikes, who moste pernitiously raysed vp a schisme of the whole Churche, and had Circumcelions, bothe a madde and fierce kinde of men, whiche murthered with swordes, maymed with Sythes, and with Lyme mingled with Vinegar put oute the eyes of the true beleeuers.
And what coulde the Emperour do, but chastise suche, that deserued any punishement whatsoeuer, although they had helde no hereticall errour besides? and yet notwithanding euen agaynst these, the punishement of death was so little defired, that euen S. Augustine did withstande the Shiriffe, when he sent out a sharper edict, fearing that he should kill any.
And so broughte to passe, that a more milde edicte was set foorth.
For as then, all the Emperours punishment consisted in a forfeit of money, in taking away their goods fro~ the Donatistes churches, giuing the~ to the churches of the true beleuers.
And if the bishops could not be corrected by any remedie, they were banished, but of killing there was no mention at al.
And therfore against Pelagius, there was neuer any motion of crauing the Emperors aide, bicause he did not on this sort trouble the tra~quilitie of the co~mon weale, yea and that is more (by the entreatie of the Bishop) they which had payed their forfeiture, had their money giuen the~ agayne: and their bishops reteyned their dignitie still in their Churches, if they would change their opinio~s So great was the lenitie of those daies towards heretikes, and that such heretikes to.
There are many kindes of punishing, besides the punishment of death.
Very farre in deede are they from this lenitie, which now a dayes for euery word that either is strange to them, or not vnderstoode, they crie foorthwith, to the fyre, to the fyre.
Heere therefore betweene these deuines and me thereis no dissention but this, that they considering what a great plague of religion it is, that the church should be deuided into such factio~s, seeme more enclined to slaughter.
On the other side am more slow, considering wherto the parable of the Lord, wherto the most holy mens interpretations, wherto the lenitie and mildnesse of the ancient Bishops, and of the Emperours, against heretikes calleth vs: then also thinking on this, howe nowe and then mens affections mingle them selues in this businesse, and how often suche remedies fall out otherwise: last of all that sometymes the truthe is doubtfull, and nowe and then it hapneth that he is in errour himselfe, that layeth the heresie to an others charge many times neither partie vndersta~deth other, and they agree in matter whyle they iarre in wordes. neither dothe S. Hierome speake rashely in the dialogue agaynst the Luciferians (vnder the person of the true beleeuer) after this maner: no body (saythe he) can take vpon him Christes victorie, no body can iudge of men before the daye of iudgement: if the Churche be nowe clensed, whye reserue we the clensing to the Lorde? there is a waye that to men seemeth righte, but the endes of it leade euen to the bottome of hell.
In this errour of iudgement, what certayne sentence can there be? &c. VVhat Hierome ment by these wordes, is cleare to the learned.
Truely they haue hitherto so moued me, that am of opinion, that we oughte not to come to the laste remedie, before all meanes be tryed.
Least perchaunce (either through a corrupt iudgement) the innocent, or at the least he that might be recouered, do perish: or else euen that which is right be condemned for euer.
Thus muche and a great deale more writeth Erasmus on this matter.
But by this, first we sée Erasmus iudgement, and yet is he not counted a Donatiste.
Secondly, he so describeth the Donatistes, that these two witnesses of Iesu Christe (which moste paciently tooke their death, nor inuaded any others lyfe) be fully cleared of this cri Thirdly, he so setteth the Donatistes out, that beyonde all the former comparisons, the Papistes of all other rome néerest them, in cruell bloudsucking, in prouoking, and setting vpon other that prouoks them not, in farre more cruell tormentes than of swordes, sythes, lime, and vinegar, yea, they haue lefte no vnnaturall cruelties, nor mischieuous trecheries vndeuised and vnpractised.
Fourthly, he sheweth (agaynst this popishe tyrannie) euen where they will not suffer the examination of the truthe, howe contrarie it is to the fathers and auncient Byshops, whome they crake to succéede.
Fifthly, where you M. Stap. falsely cite S. Augustine agaynst vs, Erasmus truely iteth him agaynst you, shewing what clemencie the Emperours vsed euen to manyfest heretikes, and what crueltie you practise agaynst the true beléeuers.
In times past (saith Erasmus) the Ecclesiasticall mildnesse did mitigate the seueritie of Princes.
And now the crueltie of certaine Monkes, except it were mitigated by the mildnesse of Princes, would burst out into more than the Scithians vnmercifull rage.
Thus we séethese two that ye ayte at, are not alone, they shall haue good companie, if they be Donatistes, for disallowing manslaughter.
But now, what if these twoo reiected it not at all, but onely shewed the exact difference betwéene the old lawe, or man politike lawes, and the Gospell.
Will you denie that the Gospell (that is to say the glad tidings of reconciliation, forgiuenesse, and saluation wrought by Iesus Christ) is the lawe of grace and full of mercie? thinke M. St. ye will not denie this, for shame.
Then should ye consider, that the Gospell (in it selfe) killeth not, but laboureth to sae, it sendeth killing to the lawe: the exercise, threates, and external punishment whereof, is not altogither taken away by the Gospell, but is forcible to the transgressours.
Nor the Gospell taketh away ciuill or polytike lawes from Princes, nor the sworde to execute them on the euil doers.
And yet is there a manifest distinction betiéene the one and the other, and so are euen your Sorbonists driuen to yéeld to Erasmus: Quamuis Euangelium, &c.
Although the Gospell do not expresly and plainly shew, that Heretikes should be burned: yet the lawes ciuill (which are conformed to the law naturall) which the Gospell doth not abrogate, do decree that they should be put to death and burned.
So that neither be such lawes comprehended in the Gospell, nor otherwise allowed than indirectly, that is to say, for the importunitie of the wicked.
But what sense soeuer ye make of their wordes, ye can not proue them Donatists.
And yet if thus much also were graunted you, doth this either charge vs that we be Donatists, not allowing them therein, if they had any such opinion· or doth it cléere you? Nay, it once againe proueth you more Donatists.
For in very déede the Denatistes refused not simplie, that the Prince should punish heretikes, no nor by death neither, if he would haue held with them, and at their bare instigations haue punished the true beleuers by death: they would haue then allowed it, set him more on, yea, haue layed to their owne hands, and haue thought they had done God good seruice too, so that he would haue maintayned them.
And do not you euen so? what els maketh ye crie vpon ye Princes beyond the seas, with all kinde of torments to destroy the Protestants? If Princes would aduise them selues or euer they beléeued you so lightly, and would not destroy their subiects, till they had sit in iudgmt heard discussed both parties causes throughly: ye would not be halfe so hastie.
Ye would then crie to the contrarie, that you must only be iudges, they must onely beleue you, strike onely them whom you shall bidde them strike.
Contrarywise, where the Princes (espying your falshood) forsake your errours, and sette out euen very milde lawes against you: then ye change your coppie, and crie out, euery thing is extreme crueltie, ye are too too sore handled and oppressed, then ye extoll beyonde the moone, lenitie and sufferance, and winche like a gald horse at the least thing that toucheth you.
And thus euery way do you still shew your selues, to be the very Donatistes.
Now that ye haue, as you conceyue with your selfe, giuen vs so great a foyle: ye enter into your thirde parte saying.
VVe may now proceede to the remnant of your booke, sauing that this in no wise must be ouerhipped, that euen by your owne wordes here ye purge M. Feckenham, from this crime ye laide vnto him euen now, for refusing the proufe taken out of the old Testament.
Now for God (M. St.) since hitherto ye haue cléered him so sclenderly, that ye haue more bewrapped him, and your selfe also in this crime, let nothing in any case be forgotten, or ouerhipped, that any wayes may helpe the matter forwarde for hitherto it rather hath gone backward, but now there is good hope, M. Feckenham shall take a good purgation, euen of the Bishops owne making, that you M. Stap. will minister to him which wil so worke vpon him, make him haue so good a stoole, that he shalbe clerely purged of this crime of Donatistes. to then M. Stapl, and let vs sée how apothecarylike you can minister the same.
For if as ye say (say you) the order gouernment that Christ left behind in the Gospell new Testament, is the order, rule gouernment in ecclesiastical causes, practised by the Kings of the old Testament, then will it follow that M. Feckenham yelding to the gouernment of the new, doth not exclude but ather comprehende the gouernment of the old Testament also, both being especially, as ye say, all one.
Is this the purgation M. St. that ye will minister to M. Feckenham, would to God ye could make him receyue an brooke this sentence, if you would take it also, warrent ye it would so purge you of your old leuen sowre dough, that ye should no more be Donatists nor Papistes neither if ye receyue and well digest this little sentence.
The order and gouernment that Christ left behinde in the new Testament is the order rule and gouernment in Ecclesiasticall causes practised by the kinges of the old Testament: For then giue ye Princes that, that ye haue all this while denied the~.
But do ye thinke M. Feckenham will wittingly and willingly receiue this sentence, that which in déede followeth necessarily thereon? The sentence is true, but M. Feck. for all that may be a lier and you another.
For warrant you M. Feck. granteth this no urder, than (as the Donatists) he may temper it to make it seeme to serue his turne.
Why? say you, if he grant the on, he doth not exclude but rather comprehende the other.
Nay M. St. M. Feck co~prehe~des it not, but shoonnes it, as agaynst him by your owne confession.
But the olde, being comprehended by the newe, Master Feckenham is contrarie wise, by force of argument, graunting the newe enforced by the olde.
Not that he comprehendeth it, but is comprehended of it, and driuen to yeelde thereto of his aduersarie, by conclusion of reasoning, the one including the other.
But rather than he will do this voluntarily, he will rather exclude them both, the olde and the newe testament also, and as he hath done, burne them both togither.
THe Bishop in this diuision, first, gathereth his full conclusion of all these testimonies into this argument: What gouernment, order, and dutifulnesse so euer belonging to any, God hath prefigured and promised before hande, by his Prophetes in the holy scriptures of the olde Testament, to be performed by Christ, those of his Kingdom: that is the gouernment, order and dutifulnesse, set forth and required in the Gospell or new testament.
But that faythfull Emperours, Kinges, and Rulers, ought of dutie, as belonging to their office, to claime and take vpon them the gouernment, authoritie, power, care, and seruice of God the Lorde in matters of Religion, or causes Ecclesiasticall, was an order and dutifulnesse for them, prefigured and forepromised of God by his Prophetes, in the Scriptures of the olde Testament, as Saint Augustine hath sufficiently witnessed: Ergo: Christian Emperors, Kings, and Rulers, owe of dutie as belonging to their office, to clayme and take vpon them the gouernment, authoritie, power, care, and seruice of God their Lorde, in matters of Religion or spirituall ecclesiasticall causes: is the gouernment, order and dutifulnesse setforth and required in the Gospell or new Testament.
The Bishop hauing thusfully concluded these Testimonies, he yet confirmeth them further with more authorities of the Prophete Esay, with Lyra his exposition therevpon, and the example of Constantine for proufe of the same.
At this master Stapleton, first carpeth by certaine marginall notes, or euer he blowe vp the Chapter of his Counterblast thereto.
The minor of the Bishops conclusion for the Princes gouernment, authoritie, power, care, &c. he grau~teth, but not such supreme gouernment (sayth he) as the othe prescribeth.
He graunteth also Saint Augustine to witnesse this the Princes gouernment, but no such large and supreme gouernment as we attribute now to them.
Againe, he graunteth this supreme gouernment is in causes ecclesiasticall· but not in all causes ecclesiasticall.
And so graunting that the Bishop concludeth well in some such thing, you conclude not (sayth he) in all things and causes, and therefore you conclude nothing agaynst vs. Lastly, he graunteth all the Bishops testimonies concerning Constantine, but he denieth that it maketh any thing for vs. Nowe after these marginall notes prefixed, he entreth into his Chapter: pretending to open the weakenesse of the Bishops conclusion, and of other his proues oute of holie Scripture.
And first, his aunswere to this diuision he deuideth in thrée partes: First, he graunteth all that the Bishop hath sayde, but denieth that it is sufficient.
Secondly, he quarrelleth about this, that the Bishop calleth the Emperour Constantine, a Bishop, as Eusebius nameth him.
Now to the first parte, to sée whether all these grauntes make sufficiently for vs, and conclude against him yea or no.
Now ye may conclude (sayth master Stapleton) that there is some regiment that Princes may take vpon them in causes Ecclesiasticall.
Thankes be giuen to God (master Stapleton) that yet now at the length, contrary to all your felowes, to all your owne wranglings hitherto, the force of the truth hath enforced you to yelde thus much to the B. ye graunt Now that Princes haue some regiment in ecclesiasticall causes, which hitherto (except the making a law of burning or punishing be an eccl. cause ye haue altogither denied vnto Princes.
But what is this some regiment that ye graunt the~ now? for neither we graunt them al regiment but some regiment also, that is to say a supreme regiment.
And you also denie not in your marginall note, that they may take vpon the~ in ecclesiastical matters supreme gouernme~t, authority, power, care, but not (say you) such supreme gouernment as the othe prescribeth, so that here, we both agrée of supreme gouernment, but the kinde of supreme gouernment is denied.
And to specifie your meaning herein, how large a kind ye graunt or denie, ye adde he should haue concluded in all things and causes, else he concludeth not agaynst you, signifying that you deny to them a supreme gouernment in all things causes ecclesiastical: but ye graunt them a supreme gouernment, authoritie, power, and care in things and causes ecclesiasticall.
First M. Stap. this is but a iangling and shifting quarell in wordes, about things and causes ecclesiasticall, and all things and causes ecclesiasticall.
For not onely the Bishop when he speaketh so indefinitely vnderstandeth all, but also it is an ordinarie speach, allowed in Logike in all things that be naturall or necessarie, where the indefinite is counted as much as the vniuersall.
As to say, a man is a reasonable creature, or man is mortall, is as much as precisely to say, all men and euery man is reasonable and mortall.
And the saying in the next diuision, he came to fulfill the lawe, and the Prophetes, is all one with this, he came to fulfill all the lawe, and all the Prophetes.
And likewise this, giue vnto God, that belongeth to God, and to Caesar, that belongeth to Caesar, is as much to say as this, giue vnto God all that belongeth to God, &c. and euen your selfe doe commonly speake thus indefinitely, ecclesiasticall matters, when ye meane all ecclesiasticall matters, though now when ye be thus iuen to graunt the effect of the matter, yet would ye find some shift of descant to frustrate all the matter, and say.
If ye meane of such regiment as ye prete~d (where ye know well ynough none other is ment) ye make your reckoning without your host, as a man may say, and conclude before ye haue brought any proufe that they ought or may take vpon them such gouernment.
Whether this some regiment be such regime~t, or such gouernment (for thus M. St. ye loue in termes to dally) though the Bishop hath proued it sufficiently, and you haue graunted it, standing onely like a daintie Nicie besetter, on this quaint poynt, in things, not in all things: yea whether this Nice restraint, defeate the full proufe of the question in controuersie betwene master Feckenham and the Bishop, shal appeare (M. St.) by calling them ath coram, to recken better with their host, that is, (as you haue like a thriftie tapster called vpon so oft before, though still ye brought in false reckonings to set before them, and mark the issue, that they condiscended vpon, that is to wee, Any such gouernme~t in ecclesiastical causes.
Lo here the demaund of the hoste himselfe, be requireth but, any such gouernme~t, and that without putting in, all, in the reckoning.
Where therfore ye grau~t ye B. hath proued it in some eccl. causes, which satisfieth the demaund of any ecclesiast. causes euen according to your owne wrangling ye confesse the Bishop hath concluded the very issue that was concluded vpon.
Thus master St. euen by your owne reckoning, the reckoned with his host, at the full, and hath payed and satisfied that he promised, and M. Feckenham required.
But nowe looke you, what reckoning you will make to your friendes, that haue here brought your selfe so farre in the lashe, that taking vpon you to impugne the Princes gouernment in ecclesiasticall causes, ye haue graunted and yelded to it.
How will your credite holde with your friends? yea how will your reckoning hold with it self? here ye haue grau~ted some regime~t, yea supreme gouernment, though not such supreme gouernment in ecclesiasticall causes.
In the last Chap. ye would graunt the~ nothing but punishment of those whom you had condemned, which is no ecclesiastical matter at all, to hang or burne a man.
And yet ye gaue them no regiment, much lesse supreme regiment, therein neyther.
For you would haue al the appointing who~ he shal punish, the prince hath nothing else to do, but to execute him whom you deliuer vp vnto him, which agréeth nothing with this yt now ye haue grau~ted, least of all with yt ye further grau~t, saying: For though graunt you all your examples ye haue alleaged, and that the doings of the olde Testament were figures of the new, and the saying of Esay that kings should be nourishing fathers to the Church, and all things else that ye here alleage: yet all will not reach home, no not Constantine the great his example.
How agréeth this graunt (master Stap.) with all that ye haue done all this while? Why haue ye denied the Bishops ensamples heretofore of Moyses, Iosue, Dauid &c. and made such a long and earnest a do in the matter to be grau~ted at length? Did ye stand in it then, to dilate your booke? or do ye graunt it now, to bragge of your skill? or did ye resist the truth then, contrary to your conscience, repent ye now? or be ye forced to grau~t with some colour, that ye cannot for shame in plaine speach denie? howsoeuer it be, many odde reckonings will fall out in your account against your selfe, although you neuer ecken with your host for the matter.
Ye graunt the saying of Esay also, that Kings shoulde be nourishing fathers to the Church, and all things else that the Bishop here alleageth, yet will not all reach home, no not Constantine the great his example.
VVill not all this reach home Master Stap. to proue the issue, that euen your selfe do confesse the Bishop hath alreadie proued? For that is the home that it ought reach vnto, by master Feckenhams demaund.
But go to, measure it with a true yerde master Stap. and ye shall see it fayre and easily, without any stretching at al, reach euen as full home as you besides can require, euen for the supreme gouernment of all maner ecclesiasticall causes, looke what ye recken most vppon, and that is euen the féeding with the worde, vnder which the Sacraments also are comprehended, not that he is the Minister of the worde and Sacraments (as you captiously gybe and cauill) for that belongeth not to supreme gouernment.
But that he is so the supreme gouernour in ouerséeing the consecration and deliuerie of the true foode, wherewith the people of God ought to be fedde: that euen he ouerséeth the féeder himselfe.
And for this cause, the King is called of the Prophete, the nourishing father, and Quéenes are named Nourses, that although the ministerie of féeding pertaine to the ministers, yet the prouision for the foode, the ouersight that the children of God be duely fedde, with the right milke, with the true bread and water of lyfe, belongeth to the Princes.
And therefore haue they the name of nourses, not to nourishe them in ciuill matters and corporall fde onely: but as in ciuil, so in acte verbi, in the milke of the worde of God also.
Is this only the cherishing of the good childe, by giuing landes, reuenewes, maintenaunce, and lyuing to the Churche? Is this onely the displing of the frowarde child, or as ye call it the punishing of the heretike.
No M. Stapleton Lyra his exposition and yours doe not agrée.
He sayth they are nourses, what to doe? to feede, whom? the faithfull ones, wherewith? with the milke of the worde, whose worde? euen the worde and sacraments of God.
Wherof sith the ministery and execution belongeth not vnto them, but to the ministers: it followeth necessarily thervpon, that the prouision, direction, appointment, care, and ouersight, which is the supreme gouernement, belongeth to them.
And this is that which Lyr confesseth the B. vrgeth of Constantine, that he was such another nourse, as did kepe, defend, maintaine, vpholde, and feede the pore faithfull ones of Christ, yea caried them in his bosome, as it were, and procured them to be fedde, did set forth proclamations not only against false religion, but also to set forth, to exhort, and allure, vnto the Christian faith, caused not only the Idolatrous religion to bee suppressed, but caused also on the other parte the true knowledge and religion of Christ to bee brought in and planted among his people, and did not only make lawes for punishing heretikes and Idolaters, but also reformed all manner abuses about Gods seruice.
Thus sayth the Bishop out of Eusebius, did Constantine play the nourses part.
Nowe what saye you to all this M. Stapleton? All this of Constantine (say you) is graunted and maketh nothing for you.
Whether it maketh for vs or no, we will not contende.
But it maketh for the matter, and being graunted, it maketh vp the matter.
For and ye will graunt thus much from your heart inwarde, which ye nowe graunt from the téeth outwarde, by compulsion of the manifest truth: ye might come home well ynough with a wannion, and bestow your wit and trauell better, than thus to graunt vnto, and yet with pieuishnesse to wythstande the manifest truth of the matter.
The Quéenes Maiesties othe requireth no more of you to giue to hir, than here ye graunt to giue to Constantine, to set foorth Christes religion, to make lawes and constitutions, not only of punishment, but of reformation of all maner abuses about Gods seruice, to prouide that the Church be fed with Gods worde, and in all pointes aboue sayde shewe her selfe a very nource of the Church, committed to hir gouernement, as the childe is to the nourse.
What one thing ecclesiasticall is not here comprehended? or can ye shewe cause, why she ought not to haue the same authoritie in hir dominions, as well as Constantine (to whome ye graunt it) had in his? if ye saye she doth not this, but the contrarie: this is but your wicked slaunder M. Stapleton.
Hir right is one thing, and whether she dischargeth well the same or no, is another thing.
Graunt hir hir right, as you doe to Constantine, and then spare not to improue, what ye can proue amisse.
Nowe, hauing graunted thus much, which in dede concludeth vp all the matter, least he shoulde vtterly be discrdited of all his friendes, he goeth about so much as he can, in wrangling of wordes, to defeate once againe all his former graunt, according to his practise in the Chapter before.
For, where the Bishop by the example of Constantyne, proueth the Prince to be herein not only a nourse to the people, but also to bee appoynted vnto them of God, as it were the common or vniuersall Byshop, as Eusebius testifieth of Constantine, and Constantine to other Byshops calleth himselfe a Byshop, signifying his carefull ouersight ouer all his people, in setting forth Gods true religion: Maister Stapleton first snappeth at thys worde Byshoppe, secondlye hée challengeth the Byshoppe for curtalling Eusebius sentence.
And when Eusebius (sayeth he) calleth hym as it were a common or vniuersall Byshoppe: suppose yee meane not, that hee was a Byshop in deede.
For your selfe confesse, that Princes Bishops offices are farre distincted and disseuered, that the one ought not to break into the office of the other.
The Bishops meaning is euident master Stap. and so are his words.
But your meaning is to brabble, to tickle in the Readers heade a suspition, that he confounded these offices.
Is there no difference betwéene these sayings, he was as it were a Bishop, and he was a Bishop in dede? Yes M. St. and ye were not a very wrangler in dede, ye might perceyue by these wordes as it were he plainly ment, (and as it were spake it, that he was no B. in deede.
And what though he were no Bishop in dede, in the function and office of a Bishops ministerie? no more was he also a nourse in deede, nor the people were suckling babes in deede, nor the worde of God is milke in deede: yet, as these things be not falsly spoken, but being borowed speaches, in their senses import not onely a true, but a more excellent vnderstanding than the bare wordes vsually betoken: so the Emperour being named to be as it were a common or vniuersall Bishop, and yet in deede, being no Bishop, it argueth that he had this name, bicause of his common and vniuersall gouernment ouersight and care ouer all Bishops and causes Ecclesiasticall.
This shift therefore, to slinke away from the manifest meaning of the wordes, by threaping on the Bishop this kindnesse, that he shoulde meane to proue him a very Bishop in dede, is a very meane shift, though it haue in dede a shrewde meaning Master Stapleton.
And if you did so meane (say you) Eusebius himself would soone confounde you, if you reherse Constantines whole sentence that he spake to the Bishops.
What a good year meane ye M. St. ye vrge this meaning further than néedes, that the B. should meane to make the Emperor a Bishop in ye Bishoply ministerie, therfore curtalled as ye call it Eusebius sentences.
If Eusebius sentence (set it downe as whole as ye list) confound them yt meane to confound these offices: it will neuer soone or late confound the B. the popish Bishops it may rather confounde, for they confounde their offices, turning Bishops not as it were into lay men but into lay men in deede.
What the Bishops wordes do meane is most playne to a man of meane witte, that list not to Iangle about nothing, neither the wordes importe any such meaning, nor this is any thing in question, the ministeriall office, but the supreme gouernment, which are two farre different things.
But since that to no purpose, ye chalenge the B. for curtalling Eusebius words: let vs behold how you do set them downe.
For thus (say you) he saith to the Bishops, Vos quidem eorum quae intus sunt in Ecclesia agenda, ego vero eorum qua extra sunt Episcopus Deo sum constitutu.
You are Bishops (saith he) of those thinges that are to be done within the Church, am Bishop of outwarde thinges: which answere of his may satisfie any reasonable man, for all that ye bring in here of Constantine, or all that ye shall afterwarde bring in, which declareth him no supreme Iudge or chiefe determiner of causes Ecclesiasticall, but rather the contrarie, and that he was the ouerseer in ciuill matters.
And the most that may be enferred hereof is, that he had the procuration and execution of Churche matters, which am assured all Catholikes will graunt.
Ye would faine sée M. Stapl. reuoke your graunt and it could be cleanly conueyde, or so to limite it, that it might not appéere ye haue granted that, that all your fellowes denie.
Neuerthelesse fuli pretely ye compasse the matter, to defeate all these most plaine not wordes but doings of Constantine, by shoouing at this name B. shop in the Emperour, which in any case ye ca~ not abide.
And therefore, as who though B. went aboute to confounde the offices of a Bishop and of a Prince, and thereto had concealed Eusebius words: ye solemnly take on yn to set them out both in Latine and in English.
But tell me by that false faith of yours M. Stapleton, why ye haue not translated the wordes aright in English, that ye haue set downe in Latine? did ye sée in déede they made nothing for you, but rather much against you? is the English of intus in Ecclesia, within the Church? And the English of eorum quae extra, Outward ciuill things or matters? or, Ego vero, &c. Episcopus 'Deo sum constitut.
am a Bishop? what is manifest corruption of plaine wordes, and euident sense, if this be not? this is past cutting of the tayle M. St. or slitting his nose, and paring his eares, to dresse it like a perfect curtall, but euen to cutte both buttockes and heade away, and make it a carrion karkasse, this translating is trans ordanem in déede.
But the wordes of Constantine the sense are plaine: You (saith he speaking to the spirituall pastours) are Bishops of those thinges that in the Churche are to be done within or inwardly.
But am appointed of God a Bishop of those things that are forthout, or outwardly.
As who should say your Bishoply office in Gods Churche, is in the ministeris of those things that worke inwardly, that perce the heart, enter into the soule, cleaue the thoughtes in sunder, and properly belong to the inwarde man: the liuely worde of God.
My Bishoply office in Gods Churche, is distinguished from this, and is in things without, that is, in the outwarde setting forth, and publique direction of Gods worde, to be duly taught by you.
Thus both their offices were in Gods Church, the matter and groundworke of both their Bishoprikes, was Gods true religion.
But the doing of the one was pertayning to the inwarde man, the doing of the other to the outwarde man.
And this is the very distinctio~ that Constantine maketh which (being not falsely translated, as you do, and so misunderstoode) may satisfie as ye say any reasonable man.
But your vnderstanding is very vnreasonable, to vnderstand by inward things, things ecclesiasticall, and by outward things, only ciuill things, in déede they be out, and quite out of the consideration of the Churche.
But wherefore then called he him selfe a Bishop also with them, yea an vniuersall Bishop, as Eusebius termeth him, but to declare that his ouersighte was in the same matter that was theirs? the matter was Gods truth and Religion in bothe, the manner was outwarde or inwarde, as eithers Bishoprike required.
Otherwise, if he had meant onely of ciuill matters as you expounde, he had bene no more a Bishop thereby, than the very Soldane or great Turke, or any other Heathen Prince, that ouersee their ciuill matters very circumspectly.
And so as ye did in your fourth Chapter, ye make Constantine (for all these notable things in him, that your selfe before haue graunted) no better than an infidell Prince in this behalfe.
But the ciuill gouernement (ye say also) reacheth no furder than the peoples quietnesse, wealth, abundance and prosperouse maintenance, that these thinges are common as well to the heathen as to the Christian gouernment.
Thinke ye M. Stapleton these Fathers meant no furder gouernment, nor in other matters than these, when they called Constantine an vniuersall Bishop? and that Constantine measured his office no furder, when he called him selfe by the name of a Bishop· for shame M. Stapleton deface not to Christian a Prince, after so Turkish a manner, nor thereto so manifestly falsifie your authour, nor abuse your reader with such a shamelesse impudence.
Well say you, And the moste that may be inferred thereof is, that he had the procuration and execution of Churche matters, which am assured all Catholikes will graunt.
May we be assured M. Stapleton on your worde, that all your popish Catholikes will graunt euen thus much? For verily feare they will graunt it no furder than it pleaseth them.
And where ye are so readie to assure vs of others graunts, what assurance haue we had alreadie of all your owne liberall graunts.
when ye were disposed to wrangle, as now againe ye do? for how agreeth this euen with your former graunt, that Princes might make lawes and constitutions for the furtherance of Christes religion, that Princes might take some regiment vppon them in Ecclesiasticall causes.
yea, might do as much as all these ensamples specifie: and that now ye make, the most to be but the procuration and execution of Church matters? Although, what ye meane by these wordes ye tell not, would ye haue them onely the Churches (that is, as you meane by the Churche, onely the Priests) proctours and executioners? now truly ye limite them a full faire office.
But thinke ye the name of B. and vniuersall B. did importe nothing els? was that the most that may be inferred thereof? and yet that is more than onely to be their executioner, (as ye said before) to be, as ye adde here to it, their proctour also.
Yea, it is much more than not to meddle in Church matters at all.
But as ye falsly expounded Eusebius before, so here ye controlle and falsefie your owne saying, affirming that the most which may be enferred hereof is, that he had the procuration and execution of Church matters.
If this be either the most or ought at all, then your former exposition of ciuill ouersight, was at the least a false corruption of you.
But and ye marke it well, ye shall finde (and neuer goe to the moste for the matter) that this title and other the doings of this noble Christian Emperour, comprehended much more thn either to be a Priestes proctour, or executioner in Churche matters, yea to betoken in very déede a chiefe and supreme gouernour.
Your thirde parte of this diuision is altogither an impertinent quarell of Images chalenging the Bishop of an vntruth and therefore (besides that is saide alreadie sufficiently, on the same argument) is answered in his proper place.
THe Bishop hauing thus fully proued that the ensamples and prophecies of the old Testament, were figures to be perfourmed in the new: entreth into the confirmatio~ therof by the newe Testament.
And first, in this diuision proueth by two allegations of our Sauiour Christ, that this authoritie of Princes in the olde Testament, is confirmed by Christ to christian Princes in the newe.
But the Princes authoritie in the olde Testament, stretcheth not onely to ciuill matters, but also to the ouersight, mayntenance, setting foorth, and furtherance of religion, and matters ecclesiasticall.
Ergo, Christ hath confirmed in the newe Testament, that christian Princes power stretcheth not onely to ciuill matters, but also to the ouersighte, mayntenance, setting foorth, and furthera~ce of religion, and matters ecclesiastical.
The minor is proued already, by these foresayde examples of the olde Testament.
The maior the Bishop proueth by two testimonies of Iesus Christ.
that he came to accomplishe the lawe and the Prophetes.
where he commaunded all men to giue that vnto Cesar, that belonged to Cesar, and bounded the Princes authoritie by the worde of God.
To the minor master Stap. sayth not one worde, neither in his marginall notes, nor Counterblast.
Belike, that he relenteth to it, according to his owne rule: Qui tacet consre videtu, he that holdes his peace seemeth to consent.
The maior likewise he graunteth, in saying: Master Horne goeth yet needlesly forward to proue that Christ did not destroy the rule of Princes in Church causes, figured in the olde lawe.
Whervpon, till M. St. shall denie one of these two propositions, the conclusion foloweth of necessarie consequence against him.
Onely, M. St. thinketh it inough for him to euerturne all the argument, if he denie the proues of the maior graunting to the other proofe, and ther vpon bendeth all his answere against this sentence, Giue vnto Cesar that belongeth vnto Cesar.
But this no whit hindreth the argument, so long as he graunteth the other proofe, yea thoughe he denied that also, so long as he graunteth the maior it selfe, to the confirmation whereof, bothe these allegations were broughte foorth.
And nowe at the length (sayth M. St.) catcheth he one testimonie out of the newe Testament to proue his saying: which is, giue vnto Cesar, that belongeth vnto him.
VVhich place nothing at all serueth his turne, but rather destroyeth, will not say any figure of the olde Testament, but master Hornes foolishe figuratiue diuinitie.
feare me, master Stapleton, that you which vpbrayde others for foolishe figuratiue diuinitie, will euen in this diuision shewe, not the wysest diuinitie in Louayne: had almoste sayde also, your owne more than foolishe diuinitie, without any figure at all.
The Byshop héere togither citeth two testimonies out of the newe Testament, and you come in, saying.
Now at the length catcheth he one testimonie out of the newe Testament to proue his saying.
But to winke at this false diuinitie, with what wise diuinitie do ye improue this one testimonie? For it is so farre off (say you) that of this place master Horne maye make any grounde for the ecclesiasticall authoritie of Princes, that it dothe not as much as inferre that we ought to pay so muche as tribute to our Princes, but only that we may pay it.
Surely M. Stap. this is a trim diuinitie, and as trim logike as diuinitie.
Christ commaundeth vs, saying, giue that vnto Cesar, that belongeth vnto Cesar: Ergo, we may, but we ought not to giue it him.
Where haue ye founde this new logike and diuinitie M. Stap? Is it Louayne stuffe? a would haue thought this reason better of the twayne, that if we ought not then, of righte we neither mighte nor shoulde giue vnto euery body, that belongeth to them, and so denie to the Prince that belongeth to him.
But this we may not, nor should do, but to giue him and all men their duetie, therfore we ought to do it.
But stil sée how ye wrap your words in contradiction.
Ye graunt that this sentence, Giue vnto Cesar that belongeth vnto Cesar, doth not destroy any figure of the olde Testament, if it do not destroy it, then it confirmeth it, and ratifieth to the Prince, that belonged to the Prince, and that the Prince had in the olde Testament: but the Prince had then authoritie in ecclesiasticall matters, as ye confessed in the two laste diuisions: Ergo, by this sentence the same authoritie is nowe confirmed.
How then say ye héere, it maketh no grounde for the authoritie of Princes in ecclesiasticall matters? since their authoritie was a figure, and this sentence ye say doth not destroy it, but nowe you haue made this sentence destroy the figure quite.
For that duetie that belonged to Princes before, stoode not on a may bawe, it lay not in the subiectes choyse to choose, whether they woulde yéelde the Prince that belonged to him, or no, as thoughe they mighte if they woulde, they néede not if they list, but they must and ought of necessarie duety and obedie~ce haue yéelded to the Prince whatsoeuer to him belonged, in the time of that figure of the olde Testament.
And this sentence, say you, hath not destroyed the figure, Ergo, This sentence now bindeth and confirmeth it, with as great duetie and necessitie, and not lesse.
But say you, this sentence dothe not so much as inferre that we oughte to paye so muche as tribute to our Princes: Ergo, This sentence hath destroyed the figure, set vs at libertie, in that the figure bounde vs.
And thus not onely ye speake quite contrarie to your selfe, and to all reason: but besides with your good diuinitie, haue taken away al humanitie.
For what pollicie can consist in any sure estate, if their subiectes be not bounde of duetis, but at their pleasures may, or may not, yéelde their dueties to their soueraigne Lordes? The Pope in déede dispenseth at his pleasure with subiectes othes and homages, to denie that duetie to their naturall Princes, that be longeth to them.
But this is a case reserued to him selfe, except ye can shew your legacie latere.
And yet this your licenciousnesse to subiectes is more than his dispensation.
But what good motiue hath moued you héere vnto? howe do ye confirme it, that this sentence importeth not their duetie, but their voluntarie in rendring the Prince his owne? For the question (say you) was framed of the captious Iewes, not whether they ought, but whether they might pay any tribute to Cesar.
Héere, M. Stap. ye shewe your selfe yet more captious than those Iewes.
Is this any necessarie cause of sequence, the Iewes propounded their question, not whether they ought, but whether they might pay tribute to their Prince, or no: Ergo, Christ answering flatly, and generally, commaunding them to pay all duetie to their Prince, that appertayneth to him, muste be vnderstoode, not that they ought, but that they might pay it? Which argument though followe nothing at all, let vs yet go onwarde with M. St. and so sée how he proues it.
Cesar was then an externall and an infidell Prince: Ergo, the question of the captious Iewes for paying him tribute, was not whether they ought, but whether they might paye tribute, or no.
Ye had néede make this argument more perfect, M. St. but to graunt ye, they propounded it as captiously as you can frame it, will you as captiously theron conclude, that we must vnder stand the answere of Christ, to co~teine no more than theyr captious question propounded? You should proue that Christes sentence inferreth no more, than that they might pay tribute: and you like a captious sophister, runne to the captious Iewes, that their sentence inferred no more.
But kin will créepe sée where it can not go.
But whether ye reason fro~ their question, or Christes answere, are these sufficient reasonable reasons M. St? Bicause their prince was an externall or an infidell prince, were they not therfore his lawfull subiects? Was not the Emperour of Rome the Prince of many other Countreyes besides? all which in the naturall situation of the prouinces were externall to him, might they therfore haue reasoned that their obedience and tributes were not of duetie to be payde? No Master Stap. they considered that though their countrey were externall, yet bicause they were vnder his gouernment, their policies and his were but one Monarchie, and therefore he was not to be counted an externall prince vnto them, no more than other princes, that haue in their possession diuerse Countries, and Realmes vnder their signiorie.
But yet say you, there remayneth a greater matter, he was an Infidell: Ergo, they might, but they ought not to haue payed him tribute.
But pray you master Stapleton, what was Nabuchodonozor any other (when he subdued Zedechias and the Iewes) than an Infidell Prince? And yet was it not lawfull for Zedechias to denie him his Tribute.
Mardocheus, Tobie, Daniell, Esdras, and other godly fathers, had no skill of this Diuinitie, that they might, but not that they ought haue payed theyr duties to Cyrus, Ahasuerus, Darius, and other Princes, bicause they were Infidels.
Ioseph and Marie traueyled with all obedience to pay theyr taxe to Augusus Cesar, as of dutie: although they knew well ynough that he was an Infidell.
page duplicate] page duplicate] But to returne to master Sta. he proueth his consequence ab absurdo.
For if (sayth he) M. Horne will say these words importe a precise necessitie, he shall haue muche ado to excuse the Italians, Frenchmen, Spaniardes, and our nation whiche many hundreth yeres since, haue payed no tribute vnto Cesar.
If these words giue vnto Cesar that belongeth to Cesar, be to be vnderstoode that he ought to haue it, the~ the Italia~s Frenchmen, Spaniards Englishmen, all which nations haue payde tribute to Cesar, ought still to pay it.
But these natio~s haue payde no tribute to Cesar, many hundreth yeres, nor ought now to pay any to him: Ergo, The words of Christ importe no necessitie nor are to be vnderstoode that they ought, but that they might.
For the minor will not examine, how many, or howe few hundreth yeres it is, since the Italians payde tribute to the Empire.
And by what meanes, whose practises they haue lefte off paying it: may be better shewed hereafter.
Onely for our nation, we haue good cardes to shewe, howe the Romanes them selues haue remitted their tribute, and all their Empire ouer vs.
The maior of this argume~t foloweth not, the folly wherof consisteth, in the wilfull misconstruing this word Cesar.
Wherby Christ meaneth not onely the Emperour or state Imperiall but he simply meaneth the Prince, whosoeuer he were.
As like wise sayth S. Paule generally (thoughe at the same time the Christians, to whome he wrote, were vnder an externall and Infidell Prince) Cui tributum, tributum. &c. Pay tribute to him, to whome tribute is due.
And so Christ, thoughe he answere them with their owne worde, yet thereon he teacheth a generall doctrine, not to them alone, but to all Subiectes, towardes all Princes, whome he comprehendeth by the name of Cesar, whome they had named to him.
And not onely all mens duetie to their Prince, but all mens duetie to God, and not the Iewes duetie to God alone.
And therefore, although he confuted their particuler caption, yet his answere was generall to them, and all other, both then and for euer.
And so he spake generally· not, giue this penie, nor giue tribute onely, but giue that (what soeuer it be) vnto Cesar that belongeth vnto Cesar, and that vnto God that belongeth vnto God whatsoeuer it be: reasoning on this.
Euery man not only may haue, but ought to haue that that is belonging to him.
Which includeth withal ye perticuler that your selues testifie, this belongeth vnto Cesar, ye ought therfore of good right giue it him, as his owne, and not ye may giue it him.
This is the euident reason and doctrine of our Sauioure Christ, that euery one ought to haue his owne.
From the which, howe farre this doctrine of M. Stap. swarueth, besides the danger of it, that we may lawfully (if we please) giue euery one his owne, but we be not bounde of precise necessitie, nor oughte so to doe: let euery body iudge, as he shall sée occasion, what inconuenience mighte quickly bréede béereon.
But master Stap. thinking that he hath sufficiently proued the former parte of Christes sentence to importe no more than he beareth vs in hande: on the other parte he endeuoreth to set on the Byshop, chalenging him to haue lefte out that parte therof, that is concerning our duetie to God.
But pray you M. Horne (sayth he) why haue ye defalked and curtalled Chrystes answere: why haue yee not set foorth his whole and entire sentence: Giue to Cesar that belongeth to Cesar, and to God that belongeth to God? which later clause, am assured, doth muche more take away a supreme regiment in all causes ecclesiasticall, than necessarily by force of any wordes binde vs to pay, yea any tribute to our Prince.
This quarell, M. St. is an euident vntruthe, for the Byshop hath not left out the other part of the sente~ce, but mentioned it in the next words immediatly following.
Admonishing notwithstanding al princes and people, that Cesars authoritie is not infinite, or without limits, (for such authoritie belongeth only to the king of al kings) but bounded and circumscribed within the boundes assigned in Gods worde.
Which words of the bishop, not only make playn relation vnto, but also comprehende the sentence folowing, quae dei deo, and giuing vnto God that perteineth to God.
And this limitation youre selfe anon afterwarde confesse, that the Byshop specifieth, though héere ye denie it according to the maner of your quarelling disposition.
But whereto M. Stap. moue ye this quarell? This latter clause am assured (say you) dothe muche more take away a supreme regiment in causes ecclesiasticall, than necessarily, by force of any words binde vs to pay, yea any tribute to our Prince.
Are ye so well assured héereof, M. Stap? but by your leaue, for all ye be so well assured, if this sentence muste be vnderstoode of may, and not of ought, then perchance it may neither take away that supremacie that belongeth to the Prince, nor that supremacie may hinder our duetie to God.
Yea what if this same may, or might, and ought not, may become an argument for all popish traytors agaynst their Princes, teaching subiectes that they may giue them their dueties, but they ought not? For am assured on the other side, that the Priestes and Byshops to their Princes, yea the Byshop of Rome him selfe to the Emperoures, as you vnderstande Cesar, haue yéeded their seruice, obedie~ce, yea and their tributes also ere this, howe soeuer since they haue wrong them selues from that olde obedience that they ought to Cesar.
And if to subtracte this, ye may thus dally on the former clause, why may not all Papistes for the later clause of the sentence to vpholde their honour of Images, their inuocation of Saincts, their owne traditions, and vnwritten verities, against Gods expresse worde and commandement, alleage for them that they may giue to God that, that belongeth to God, but not that they ought, as bounde thereto necessarily by force of any wordes? For this am sure of also, that these wordes of Christ do make no more mencion of dutie toward the one parte of the sentence, than to the other, the one comprehendeth not may, and the other ought: but though the dutie to God be greater, and more excellent than the dutie towarde the Prince, yea and boundeth it (as the Bishop saide) yet dutie belongeth vnto hothe, and both ought to haue it.
And we be not here licenced, but flatly co~maunded to giue that that is dutie to eyther partie.
The wordes are manifest [undefined span alphabet], Reddite, Render you that vnto Caesar that is Caesars, and that that is Gods to God.
So that if reddite Caesari quae sunt Caesaris, be no more but this, ye may giue vnto Cesar those things that are Cesar, then may reddite Deo qu sunt Dei, be also by as good Latine, ye may giue to God those things that are Gods.
What figuratiue diuinitie, yea what figuratiue Grammer call ye this? wherof ye crake so much, and finde such fault in others, and can not sée in your selfe, how your Diuinitie either marres your Grammer, or your Gra~mer your Diuinitie.
And yet both must go for excellent good, for why you are assured of the matter that the imperatine mode is in the one clause no more than the potentiall, commanding to do, is no more but to say ye may do: though in the other clause, it retaineth still his force.
Besides this good Diuinitie, that we be not necessarily, by force of any wordes bounde to pay, yea any tribute to our Princes, and so may denie them both that, and all duties else, as do the Papists when they be disposed to refuse their lawfull obedience to their soueraignes, as you your Louanistes do.
Did euer any of the ancient Diuines, giue this libertie to subiects against their Princes, or thus expounde these wordes, and not rather al with one, co~sent, yea your popish writers hereo~ also, so many as haue read, gather here vpo~ a necessary dutie of al subiects obedie~ce, tributes, honor al other prehemine~ces belo~ging to Princes? chiey on this sente~ce, write of purpose vpon this co~mon place, of subiects dutiful obedience to their magistrates: you make so light a matter of it, yt ye say it bindeth vs not so much, as to pay any tribute at al vnto the~.
But that all the world may sée how falsely ye wrest the wordes of Christ, ye shal sée some of the fathers iudgments on these words, giue vnto Cesar that that is Cesars: that they inferre not that they may giue, but that they ought to giue them.
Tertullian an ancient Father saith: Alius est denarius que~ Csari debeo, &c.
It is an other penie that owe to Cesar, that pertaineth to him, wherof it was the~ moued, that is to say, a tributarie penie due to be paide of tributarie, not of free me~.
pray ye M. St. what is yt English of Debeo of debitus? Origen likewise an au~cie~t Father saith: In te~pore ergo Christi, &c.
In the time therefore of Christ, when they were commanded to giue tribute to the Romaines, there was a thought cou~sel amo~g the Iewes, Utru~ deberent, whether they ought that were Gods people his portion, to giue Princes tribute, or rather take armes for their libertie, except they were suffred to liue as they lusted.
And the story telleth that one Iudas a Galilean, of whom Luke mencioneth in the Actes of the Apostles, drawing away the multitude of the Iewes, taught, No~ oportere, they ought not to giue tribute to Cesar, call Cesar Lord.
But he that was at that time the tetrarch hastned to perswade the people, that they should regard the present state, not wilfully take armes against the stronger.
And truly the worde of this present gospel, not in deede manifestly, yet it shewes these things.
But he that diligently co~sidereth the sense of the present wordes, shal finde this, yea eue~ in this place.
For the Phariseis had not had occasion (being willing to take Christ in his speach, sending their disciples with the Herodia~s) to aske him whether it were lawfull to giue Cesar tribute or no, if it had bene manifest amo~gst them, that they ought not to giue it, that there had bene an agreement of all their willes, that they should not giue it. &c.
Thus we sée that the question they moued to Christ, was whether they ought to pay tribute or no.
And yt Iudas Oalileus a mouer of conspiracie, a rebellious traytour, M. St. an English renegate, a like mouer of seditio~: are of one opinio~, y^ tribute ought not to be payde.
But Christ was of a co~trarie opinio~. all true subiects ought to follow Christes opinio~, that tribute ought to be be paide.
When they shewed Christ a penie, and Christ asked whose inscriptio~ it was, and they said it was Cesars.
He answered that they ought to render vnto Cesar the things that are Cesars, and that they ought not to defraude him of those things that are his owne, vnder the occasio~ of godlines.
And likewise the same Origen saith, Some thinke it simply spoke~ of our Sauiour, render to Cesar that is Cesars, that is to say, Tributu~ reddite quod debetis, render the tribute that ye owe, Quis enimostru~ de tributis reddendis Caesari co~tradicit? for who gainesaith it that tributes ought to be payd to Cesar? Forsoth that doth M. Stapl. saying they might but they ought not.
Hilary likewise an auncient Father saith: Igitur an violaret, &c.
Therefore they trie him, whether on the condition of the question propounded, he would violate the worldly power.
An videlicet reddi tributum Caesari oportet, whether tribute ought to be rendred to Cesar, &c.
And when they sayd it was Cesars, he said, Caesari reddenda esse, &c.
The things that are Cesars, ought to be rendred to Cesar.
And againe, whe~ he decreeth that the things that are Cesars ought to be rendred to him: Likewise Basilius Magnus, VVhen they had said Cesars, he replied, render, &c. wherein we be manifestly taught, that those are bounde to the tribute of Cesar: with whom the monie of Cesar is founde, &c. Likewise Chrysostome: That the things that are Cesars ought to to be rendred to him: Likewise S. Ambrose, Et tu si vis. &c.
And thou if thou wilt not be bounde or thrall to Caesar, haue thou not those things that are of the world, but if thou hast the riches of the world thou art bound to Caesar.
If thou wilt owe nothing to the earthly King, forsake all things and follow Christe.
And before, decerne ye well what thinges ought to be rendred to Caesar.
But bicause the Manichei vse openly to blaspheme Iohn, let them heare euen the Lord Iesus Christ, Hoc stipendium iubente reddi Caesari, Commaunding (not, permitting) this stipende to be rendred to Caesar.
And on these woordes of S. Paule to the Romaines, Omnis anima, Let euery soule be subiect to the higher powers.
Si quis ergo: If therfore any body thinke, that bicause he is a Christian, he ought not to render taxe or tribute, or that honour ought not to be giuen due to those powers that care for these things: he falleth in a great errour.
But that meane ought to be kept which God him selfe prescribeth, that we should giue vnto Caesar the things that are Caesars, and to God the things that are of God.
Likewise Theophilactus: Arbitrati se, &c. Thinking they should smooth him with prayses, they flatter him, that being milked, he should say, Non deberi Caesari tributum, Tribute ought not to be payde to Caesar, and therevpon they might take him as a seditious man and mouing the people against Caesar, and therefore they bring the Herodians with them that were the kings men, to apprehende him, as a sturrer of new things.
Thou regardest not, say they, the person of any man, that speakest nothing to get the fauour of Herode and Pilate.
Ought we to be both tributarie to men, and to giue them taxe, as wel as to giue taxe to God, or shall we giue to God onely, or els to Caesar also? this they spake (as sayde) that he should say that tribute ought not to be giuen to Caesar, &c.
Thus we sée againe their question whether they ought, or no.
But Iesus by this coyne that was figured in the Image of Cesar· Persuadet illis debere Caesari, Perswadeth the~ that those things are owing to Cesar, that are his, (that is) those that haue his Image.
Both in corporal and in outward things we must obey the king, but in inwarde things and spirituall, onely God.
Thus al these ancient Fathers are flat against ye M. St. and expound this saying, not that they might, but that they ought, and that we ought to obey our Princes.
And thus do your owne popish writers although partiall to your Pope yet herein reproue you.
Render, &c. bicause to render that that is due, is good and iust.
And all the popish Postilles, that haue séene, Poligra, Ferus, Hofmeister, Ryard. &c. affirme on these wordes, that tribute ought to begiuen to Cesar, and obedience ought to be giuen to Princes.
And none of them that can yet finde, founde out this fine conceyte, that they may, but not that they ought to do it.
Now on their side, ye stretch so far the other words, giue that vnto God that belongeth to God, that as though they were cleane contrary to the former, ye say: they take away a supreme regime~t, but sée how while ye would séeme so knuckle déepe in Diuinitie, ye quite take away your Popes chalenge all.
For if it take away a supreme regiment, how doth your Pope chalenge a supremacie? in déede ye spake truer than ye wist, for such a supremacie as he claimeth, is onely due to Christ, God Man: to no simple Creature, Prince, Prelate, or any other.
Wherfore he ought not to vsurpe it, but giue it vnto the owner.
The supremacie that is due to godly Princes, is neither such as the Pope claimeth, nor is derogatorie, in any Iote, from the dutie that is to be yéelded to God.
But is the ministerie appointed by God, to gouerne and direct according to Gods worde, the boundes of Gods Church that God hath limited to his rule and ouersight.
And therefore that which you alleage out of Hosius of Spaine, S. Ambrose that vsed euen these wordes, Et quae Dei Deo, against the Arian Emperour Constantius, and Ualentinian the yonger, are quite besides the purpose.
Th Queenes maiestie taketh not on hir, nor claymeth any such absolute supremacie and dealings as they twayne vsurped, It is but your common sclaunder.
But sith ye onely touche it saying, whose wordes we shall haue an occasion hereafter to reherse, will therfore with you referre the examining thereof to that your occasio~ of rehersal, only here note this your folly contradictio~ in citing these fathers allegations.
If this sentence be onely to be restrayned to the Iewes bare demaund: if it meddle only with Tiberius Cesar then Emperour, and stretch no furder: If it determine nothing but money: If it inferre no necessitie or dutie but only giue licence: how then did these Fathers alleage vrge this sentence against these Princes? and how do you alleage them against the Bishop? do ye not sée how ye speake against your selfe? but forbeare you till ye come to your appointed place.
Although furder here might admonish you, since ye reherse here no wordes of those authours, but referr yourselfe to another fitter occasion: not to stande dalying in so often preuentions and rehersalls, and all to no purpose, but onely to encrease your volume.
Much lesse, to triumphe therevppon, till ye haue sette downe some proufe, either of them, or of other to confute the Bishop: for els ye do but triumphe before the victorie, and such commonly in the ende do lse the victorie.
For hitherto ye haue alleaged nothing against the Bishops allegation, and yet say you: This ill happe hath M. Horne euen with his first authoritie of the newe Testament extraordinarily and impertinently can not tel how chopped in, to cause the leaues and his booke and his lies to make the more muster and shewe.
This was an happie happe for you M. Sta. (to ruffle in your Rhetorike) that it happed the B. to haue so ill an hap by alleaging this sentence, for hereby ye haue shewed first your truth honestie.
That where the Bishop citeth two plaine sentences out of the new Testament together, to co~firme his assertio~, you say he alleageth here but one.
Where the Bishop citeth this of Cesar the later of the twaine, you quite omitting the other, say: this is his first authoritie of the new Testament.
Good happe haue you M. St. to haue chopped in two lies so round togither, to make the more muster of lies in your booke, but happie man happy dole they say.
With the like happinesse haue ye founde out this grammar rule, that Reddite is ye may giue.
But chiefly this happie new Diuinitie to refuse your Princes lawfull authoritie, that necessarily by force of any wordes, ye be not bounde to pay so much as any tribute to your Prince.
All these happes was it your hap, first to finde out.
And therefore all your side haue good cause M. St. to count ye an happie man.
But M. St. not content withall these happes, stormeth yet against the Bishop for adioyning these wordes: Admonishing not withstanding all Princes people, that Cesars authoritie is not infinite or without limites (for such authoritie belongeth only to the King of all Kinges) but bounded and circumscribed within the boundes assigned in Gods worde.
This M. St. calleth, a foolish and a friuolous admonition without any cause or ground, grounded on M. Hornes fantasticall imagination, and not vpon Christ, as he surmiseth.
a foolish and a friuolous admonition? a groundlesse fantasticall Imagination, to say that the Princes authoritie is not infinite, but circu~scribed within the boundes assigned in Gods worde? what would ye haue had ye Bishop to say? that it had bene infinite without any boundes, such as onely belongeth to God? but how would ye then haue triumphed at the matter? and in déede ye had had good cause.
Where now ye haue none, but that ye be disposed to quarel at euery thing, be it neuer so well spoken.
Neyther was it without cause or grounde, syth the wordes that immediately are ioyned so togither, make an expresse limitation, that the former part of the sentence, is bounded with the later parte: that the Prince ought to haue such due belonging to him, as hindreth not ye yéelding of that due that belongeth to God.
And therfore the Bishops admonition was not onely godly and true, but grounded on Christes wordes, yea and comprehendeth them also, and was no lesse necessarie for the Bishop to haue vsed, both for that it maketh a distinction, of that supremacie that your Pope chalengeth, intruding and incroching on those things that are only due to God, and not suffring his authoritie to be limitted by Gods worde, and woulde rule Gods worde, and go beyonde the boundes thereof: And also for that, to the ignorant simple of your side, ye slau~der the B. and other setters forth of gods word, yea the Quéenes maiestie her self to take on hir, and we to yelde to hir, such an absolute and indefinite authoritie, as taketh from god, from his word, from his ministers, that authoritie that belongeth vnto them.
Which syth it is your vsuall lying and malicious slaunder, to sturre offence to the simple, to bring the Prince and Preachers in obloquie, and the authoritie in suspition and hatred, it was not a friuolous fantasticall imagination, as your fantasticall braine imagineth, but a most necessarie cause for ye B. to haue giuen that admonition, to shew what authority we allow in ye prince, the Prince taketh on hir, agréeable to that, that Christ co~mau~ds to render.
VVho willeth that to be giuen to Caesar that is Caesars and to God that is Gods: but determineth expresseth nothing that is to be giuen to Caesar, but onely payment of money.
And yet if we consider, as haue sayde, what was the question demaunded, it doth not determine that neither, thoughe the thing it selfe be most true.
Doth this M. St. determine nothing but money, yea not so much as that neither? whie, what doth it determine then? nothing (say you) if we consider, as haue sayde, what was the question demaunded.
In déede M. Stap. if we considered as you haue sayde, it would be a very meane determination of any thing.
And yet if you would better haue considered, euen that you haue sayde, ye shoulde haue found this your saying, to haue bene sayde without your considering cappe.
For then ye tolde vs, that thoughe it forced not that we ought to pay tribute, yet it forced that we might pay it, which inforceth yet somewhat more than bare nothing.
And euen héere present ye say, that Christ determineth expresseth nothing that is to be giuen to Cesar, but onely payme~t of money.
And by by ye say, it doth not determine that neither.
And so ye tell vs it dothe determine nothing, and yet it determines something, and that something it doth determine, and yet it dothe not determine it.
If we consider it, as you haue sayde it, howe would ye haue vs consider it, master Stap. when your selfe so inconsiderately haue saide suche contradictions? Besides this, as repugnant as the rest, before ye sayd, his wordes imported onely that they might, which is not to will a thing to be done, but to permit or licence that a thing may be done, or may not be done.
And héere ye playnly say, he willeth that to be giuen to Cesar that is Cesars, and to God that is Gods.
But Christes willing a thing to be done, is his commaundement that it be done: and not a licence that may or may not be done.
It lieth not in our will, that we may if we liste, giue God that that is Gods, but we must and ought so to doe, bicause it is Gods will.
And so likewise for the Princes duetie, he hath willed that he shoulde haue that belongeth to him, yea your selfe say, it is moste true, and therein ye say truely: and it is most iust and reason by all lawes (except your Popishe lawes) that euery man haue that is his, and then muche more the Prince to haue that that is his: no body ought to take away anothers right and due, muche lesse his Princes: then if it be most true, most reasonable and iust, and Christes will, was not this most true, iust, and reasonable will of Christ, a sufficient determination, that the Prince shoulde haue all that belonged to him, but that he might haue it, if it pleased his subiectes to giue it him? Nay, it was not so muche, say you, no not for so much as his owne money, yea he determined nothing at all.
What a straunge answere of Christ had this béene to the Iewes demaunde, or rather a daliance to haue determined nothing at all? but this is your moste false and fantasticall imagination, M. St.
For vpon their particuler demaunde Christ giueth a determinate and generall doctrine, that all Princes shoulde haue, not onely money or tribute, (as they moued their question) but all things else that belong vnto the~, as likewise God, to haue althings belonging to God, and yet their demau~de mentioned not God at all.
But Christes answere determined that, and more than they demaunded.
And therfore he answered then not agayne, that it was lawfull to giue tribute to Cesar, but gaue them flat commaundement, for all things not only belonging to Cesar, but to Good also, bicause they pretended to be exempted from the Emperours subiection and taxes, béeing Gods peculier people, as the Popish prelats claym to be exempted from the gouernement and tribute of their Princes, bicause they be (as they pretende) the spiritualtie.
The residue of M. St. answere is nothing but wordes of course, and slaunderous bye quarels.
First that this admonition of the bishop serueth him, and his brethren for many and necessarie purposes to rule and master their Princes by at their pleasure.
That as often as their doings lyke them not they may freely disobey, and say it is not Gods worde, wherof the interpretation they referre to them selues.
Héerein M. St. you measure vs by your selues, none séeketh another in the ouen, they say, that hath not hidde him selfe in the Ouen before.
This that ye clatter agaynst vs, is the common practise of the Pope and his Prelates, so they vse Princes, and so they vse the worde of God.
So long as the Gréeke Emperours enriched the Popes, and suffred them to set vp Idolatrie, your Popes lyked well of them, but when they beganne to pull downe Images, then your Popes rebelled agaynst them, add stirred vp Pepia and Charles the great to inuade the Empire.
So long as the Frenche Emperours endowed and defended the Popes seigniories, they were the Popes chiefe and white sonnes.
But so soone as they beganne to chalenge their righte in Italie, then your Popes fearing the Frenche power, berefte agayne the Frenche Emperoures of it, and gaue it to the Germane Princes.
But euen in Germanie, as any Princes woulde clayme their righte and interest of his estate, to be Emperoure in déede of Rome, as he is called in name, then the Popes did excommunicate him, and stirred his people to rebellion agaynst him.
And thus likewyse in Englande: so long as king Iohn withstoode the Pope, and his Byshops practises, he was excommunicated, and his kingdome giuen to the Frenche kings sonne, and the Dolphin willed to inade Englande.
But when king Iohn had made him selfe the Popes vassalle, and to holde the kingdome in Capite of the Pope, he was absolued, and the Dolphin forbidden and accursed.
So long as king Henry the eight wrote agaynst Luther, he had a golden Rose sent him, and was entituled, Defendour of the faythe.
But when he in déede began to defende the fayth· and abolish the corrupter of the fayth and his corrupte Idolatrie, then he was excommunicate with booke, bel candle: and al Princes that the Pope might moue, were set against him.
And this practise he vsed with other christian Princes, calling one his eldest sonne, another the most Christian king, another the Catholike king· &c. With suche clawes to master and rule Princes by, at his pleasure.
But as often as any Princes doings like him not, then to cause their subiectes to disobey them, and renounce their othes of allegeance.
And wherto else serueth all this your present wrangling and wresting of this text, Reddite Caesars quae sunt Caesaris: but to this purpose, that béeing not necessarily bounde by force of any wordes to pay, yea any tribute to our Prince, and that it standeth onely on a case of licence or possibility, we may if we please, it is lawfull if we do it, but we ough not, we be not bounde, it is not a precise necessitie of subiectes.
What is a gappe to all disobedience and rebellion, if this be not? and yet he obiecteth this to vs.
No M. Stap. it is your owne, we acknowledge it to be a commaunde ment, due, and necessarie, that the Prince haue all thinges that belongeth to him, and what belongeth, in this controuersie, is proued out of the olde Testament, which Christ héere confirmeth, and limiteth it by the duetie giuen also to God, putting no meane of Pope nor Prelate betwéene God and the Prince, as you do.
And this limitation ye can not denie to be good and godly, for all your scoffing at it, to limitte the Princes authoritie by Gods worde.
Which we do, not to disobey our Prince, but rather to giue to our Prince hir owne, knowing which is hirs, which is Gods, least we should with you intermingle these dueties that Christ hath seuered, as your Pope vsurpeth bothe Cesars and Gods also, bicause he will not haue his power measured by Gods worde, but will rule the worde of God, and referreth the interpretation thereof to him selfe.
To lay it to vs, is but a manyfest slaunder.
And this is a greater matter of all on your side, than the refusall of a cappe or a surplesse (wherat ye quarell) in some Protestantes on the other side, which dothe nothing abase, but rather (in comparison) shew the more your stubborne disobedience in all poyntes to your Princes authoritie, besides your abusing of Gods worde, wherof ye say we make a very welshmans hose.
Or but yet do you, M. St. and a great deale worsse too, but ye were best to crie, stoppe the théefe by another, for feare ye be espied to be the théefe your selfe.
But pray you how do ye proue that we or the Byshop so vse Gods worde? For (say you) we playnely say that this kinde of supremacie is directly agaynst Gods holy worde.
Is this an argument M. St. that we abuse the worde of God, bicause you playnly say, this supremacie is directly agaynst Gods worde? In déede heare ye say it, and saye it playnely, and as playne as ye can saye it, and that very often too, and make it a sufficient cause, saying: For we playnly say: But ye shoulde once at the least proue it as playnly withall, and not so often tell vs that ye playnely say so, and then we shoulde playnely sée, and say also with you, that ye vsed playne dealing, as well as playne sayings.
IN this diuision the Byshop procéedeth further with other testimonies out of the Apostles, with the fathers expositions therevpon.
Chrisostome stretcheth this obedience to euery kinde of Ecclesiasticall person, so well as lay person.
And maketh the obiecte or matter wherein the Princes gouernement is exercised, to be for the furthering and aduauncing of all vertuous actions, the correcting and repressing of all vices: and that not onely in all matters of the seconde Table, betwéene man and man: but of all matters in the first table, betwéene God man, so well as of the other.
stretching the duetie of Princes, not onely to honestie of life, but also to godlinesse.
Wherby Sainct Augustine meaneth, the chiefe or proper worship, seruice, and religion of God.
Shewing at large by Sainct Augustine, (who reasoning on the thirtéenth to the Rom. confuteth the Donatistes héerein) that Princes haue authoritie for the furtherance and setting foorth of true religion, and suppressing of all heresies, schismes, and other ecclesiasticall abuses: so well as the furtheraunce and setting foorth of ciuill iustice, and the punishement of morall vices.
First, gathering a contraction of the Byshops allegations, he graunteth vnto them, and proueth that he and the Protestantes agrée héerevpon.
Secondly, he pincheth and restrayneth his graunt, and endeuoreth to proue contradiction in the Protestantes.
Thirdly, he entreth into the answere of certayne wordes and testimonies by the Byshop alleaged.
Fourthly, he replieth on the bishop with other allegations out of Chrysostome, and theron frameth an argument on them, for his Priestes superioritie.
The residue of his answere to S. Augustine he passeth ouer in wordes of course.
In the first sayth M. Stapleton: Heere is nothing, M. Horne.
The effect of your processe is, Princes haue authoritie to mainteine, praise, and further the vertues of the first table, and to suppresse the co~trarie, wherein onely consisteth the true religion and spiritual seruice that is due from man to God And that he hath authoritie herein not only in the vertues or vices bidden or forbidden in the second table of Gods co~maundementes, wherein are conteyned the duties that one ma~ oweth to another.
This is grau~ted M. Horn both of the Catholikes, and of the soberer sort of the Protestantes (for Carolostadius, Pelargus, Struthius, with the whole rable of th' Anabaptistes denie it) that Princes haue authoritie both to further the obseruation, and to punishe the breache of Gods co~maundements, as well in the first table, as in the seconde, that is, as well in suche actions as concerne our duetie to God himselfe, as in the duetie of one man to another.
This were meetely well sayde M. St. that héere agayne thus liberally ye grau~t, if it made any gret matter what ye graunted or denied.
The bishop you should soone agrée sauing for your instabilitie, that after you haue made your large graunts, ye still reuoke the~ againe with some pelting distinction or qualification of them.
Princes haue authoritie both to maynteine, praise further the obseruation, and to suppresse and punish the breach of Gods co~mandements, aswel in the first table, as in the seconde that is, aswell in suche actions as concerne our duty to God himselfe (wherin onely consisteth the true religion and spirituall seruice) as in the duetie of one man to another.
But thus wel haue Princes authoritie to mainteine further, or to suppresse and punish in actions of the duety of one man to another conteyned in the second table: that no suche actions be exempted from their authoritie, but they ought to prayse, maynteine, and further al such actio~s as are bidden, and suppresse and punish al such actions as are forbidden, and that to do with moste great care, diligence, and ouersight, yea supreme authoritie also vnder God therin: Ergo, They may do so, by like righte, in all the actions of the first table, concerning the true religion and spirituall seruice of God.
Or else this (aswell) that ye put in twyce togither for more confirmation, commeth an ace behinde, and is belike as muche to say, as not as well, the quite contrarie to aswell.
Thus if ye stande to your owne words that the Princes authoritie is aswell in the one as in the other: they sufficiently importe all that we demaunde, and are as muche as this, The Prince is supreme gouernour, not onely in all temporall· but also in all ecclesiasticall causes.
And therefore where ye say that they be Anabaptistes that denie it, ye conclude all the Papistes to be Anabaptistes, for they denie it.
And your selfe are in the table also, that haue pute oute this your Counterblast, chiefly to ouerturne it.
Although, when ye be pressed, ye oftentimes graunte that whiche ouerturnes your selfe.
Neither dothe your distinction helpe· ye, to the which ye runne for succour euen to your enimies.
But all this is (say you) as not onely the Catholike wryters, but Melancthon him selfe, and Caluine doe expound: Quod ad externam disciplinam attinet: As muche as appertayneth to externall discipline.
And the Magistrate is the keeper and defender of bothe Tables, saythe Melancthon, but agayne he addeth.
Quod ad externos mores attinet: As muche as belongeth to externall maners, behauiour and demeanour.
Ye promise héere agayne to agrée with Caluine and Melancthon in all this, whiche ye haue graunted, that the Prince hathe authoritie as well in the firste Table, as in the seconde, this onely excepted as they excepte.
So long as appertayneth to outwarde discipline and outwarde maners.
But al Ecclesiastical causes and orders for setting foorth religion, are either outwarde disciplines or outwarde rites, maners, behauiours, or demeanoures, (for as for inwarde actions or thoughtes the Prince meddleth not withall, but God alone: the minister onely pronounceth Gods threats or promises for them·) Ergo, Euen by this your own distinction ye confesse once agayne the Princes supremacie in all eccl. causes.
Neither dothe your reason folowing helpe ye any thing at all.
For (say you) in the first Table are co~teined many offences and breaches, of the which the prince ca~ not iudge, much lesse are by him punishable: As are all such crimes which properly belong to the court of conscience, to wee, misbelefe in God, mistrust in his mercie, contempt of his co~mandements, presumption of our selues, incredulitie and such like.
VVhich all are offences against the first table, that is, against the loue that we owe to God.
Contrarywise, true beleefe, confidence in God, the feare of God, and such like, are the vertues of the first table, and of these Melancthon truly saith, Haec sunt opera prime tabulae, These are the vertues of the first table.
All this M. St. that ye speake, is beside the question, concerning such crimes or vertues of the first table properly belonging to the courte of Conscience.
What néede ye stande so long descanting on the first table? as though in the seco~d table many such vices were not lurking in the hart of ma~, for which the Prince also can make no lawe.
For, he can not compel his subiects to beare no hate nor wrath in their hartes: nor to lust or desire in their harts vnlawfully their neighboures wife and goodes: nor to loue another as them selues.
All which are of the second table, properly also belonging to the court of conscience.
You might as well haue added these of the second, as the other of the first table, but then had your falshood bene espied, going aboute by this meanes to reuoke all your graunt for the first table, that because the Prince cannot punish such inwarde and peculiar breaches: therefore he can not iudge vpon the doctrine and open causes, and so ye simply conclude: The punishing, correcting, or iudging of these, appertaine nothing to the auctoritie of the Prince, or to any his lawes, but onely are iudged, corrected and punished, by the speciall sworde, of excommunicatio~, of binding of sinnes, and enbarring the vse of holy Sacramentes, by the order and auctoritie of the Priest onely and spirituall Magistrate.
Ye might M. St. as well conclude this of the second table also, and quite debar the Prince of all dealing in either table, bicause the inwarde action of either table, the Prince can not punish, so defeate all your graunt which before ye confessed, that the furthering or punishing for both the tables as well of the first as of the second belongeth to the Princes aucthoritie, Quod ad externam disciplinam mores attinet: So far as belongeth to outwarde discipline and manners.
And now ye say the quite contrary, he can not punishe nor Iudge the offences of the first table, if ye meane· the open offences thereof he can do it by your own limitacion, Quod ad externam disciplinam mores attinet.
And so you make a fallacion, secundum quid ad simpliciter except ye meane (as your reason pretendeth) properly as yet belonging to the courte of conscience betwene God him.
Then, whether it be in the first, or in the second table: the Prince in déede can not iudge or punish the secrete offence, no nor properly the minister but so God alone.
The minister doth but pronou~ce Gods sentence: and the Magistrate punisheth it, be it in the first or seco~d table, come it once to ye breach of external tes discipline, as your selfe do limite their aucthoritie, there in haue promised to agrée with Caluin and Melancthon.
But as in this your first parte ye haue graunted so much as suffiseth all the matter, besides the referring your selfe to Caluins and Melancthons iudgement: so in your second parte, ye wrest and wrangle about your graunt, and labour to proue contradiction in the~, though in déede you can finde none, and yet (would ye looke on your selfe) ye should finde an heape of fowle manifest contradictions, besides those foresaide euen in this present chapter.
Againe (say you) whereas, the chiefe vertue of the first table is to beleeue in God, to know him, and to haue the true faith of him and in him, in Externall regiment (as to punish open blasphemie, to make lawes against Heretikes, to honour and maintayne the true seruice of God) Princes especially Christians, ought to furder aide, and mayntaine the same: but to iudge of it, and to determine, which is the true faith in God, how and after what manner he ought to be serued, what doctrine ought to be published in that behalfe, the Prince hath no aucthoritie or power at all.
Sée how ye first pinche and wrest your former graunt M. Stapl. and inconclusion take it quite away.
Before ye saide, Christian Princes had the regiment in externall matters, now ye come in with externall regiment.
Right now, the Prince had authoritie to further and punish, ouer the one table as well as the other: and now, he cannot determine so much as which table is which.
Right now, he had authoritie, Quoad externos mores as much as belongeth to externall manners: now, he must not iudge how or after what manner God ought to be serued.
Right now, he had Externam disciplinam, the outward discipline: now, to know what doctrine or discipline ought to be published, he hath no authoritie or power at all.
This géere hangeth trimly togither, and haue we not gotten a faire graunt? we thought as the Papistes had wont to say, we had God in the Ambry, but, the Diuell see was in the Horologe.
Now after he hath renoked his graunt he beginneth to quarrell with the Protestants, with whome before he said, he and all his felowship would agrée, and first he beginneth to proue contradiction in Melancthon.
Melancthon saith, that Princes ought to looke vnto true doctrine, to correct the Churches when the Bishops falle of their dutie, yea and to consider the doctrine it selfe.
Againe, the same Melancthon saith, they must make no newe doctrines in the Churche, neither institute any worships.
Ergo, Melancthon either recanteth as better aduised, or writeth playne contraries to him selfe.
How hath malice blinded you St? can ye sée no lesser difference than contrarie, betwéene looking to the olde and coynyng newe, betwéene considering and instituting worships? Surely, then can ye neuer consider, nor well looke vnto (not the truth) but euen your owne follie, that dreame of recanting and contradictions in other, hauing your selfe scarse written a line before, wherein so plainly ye contraried your owne wordes, in recanting your former graunt.
Thus, as in vaine ye séeke for co~tradiction in Mela~ctho~s wordes, so as fondly do ye conclude thereon your purpose.
Mela~cthon would not haue Princes make new doctrines and worships of God, nor haue the functions of both Magistrates spirituall and temporall to be confounded: Ergo, he taketh away all auctoritie from Princes in iudging and determining of doctrine.
But what dealing call ye this M. St? that in translating Melancthons sentences, ye both falsely wrest them, add of your own vnto them.
Where Melancthon saith, Nec instituant cultus, Neither let them institute (or appoynt of new) any worshipping of God, you translate it neither appoint any worshipping of God.
As though they might not appoint that true worship of God, that God hath appointed him selfe to be worshipped by.
Where Melancthon speaketh only of appointing other new deuised worships, such as the Popish worships are.
Likewise speaking of the functions, ye clappe in of your owne these wordes (of bothe Magistrates) calling the ministers magistrates, whiche wordes Melancthon hath not.
And thus ye loue ale to tell your fale falsly.
And as you thus deale with Melancthon, so fro~ him ye runne to M. Nowell, and say: Yea, M. Nowell him selfe with a great stomacke biddeth vs shew where they denie that godly and learned Priestes might iudge according to the sinceritie of doctrine.
As though whe~ the Prince and his successours are made supreme gouernours without any limitacion, it fall not often out, that the Bishop be he neuer so learned or godly, shall not once be admitted to iudge of true doctrine except the doctrine please the Prince.
Ye will neuer leaue your falsehood M. Stap. sayth that Princes made supreme gouernours without any limitation? Who saith the Bishop be he neuer so godly or learned, shall not once be admitted to iudge of true doctrine, except the doctrine please the Prince? there any that saith so, or doth so, except your Pope He in déed chalengeth a supreme gouernaunce without limits, in as large and ple as belongeth vnto Christ.
He will suffer no doctrine but that which pleaseth him, and he will be the onely chiefe Iudge thereof.
This is not the gouernance that we ascribe to Princes, but such as is limitted by Gods worde, such as stretcheth not further tha the of their dominions, suche as suffreth godly and learned Priestes according to Gods worde, to iudge of the synceritie of doctrine, for this you confesse that master Nowell sayth, and therefore ye confesse your selfe to be a lyer, and to speake contrari, when ye bring in th the Protestants, to acknowledge a limitation, and say, we make a gouernement without any lymitation.
Neither is any contradiction in master Nowels saying to be anie more gathered, than of Melancthon wordes: Princes are supreme gouernours, Ergo, Prelates may not iudge of true doctrine.
Which is as wie a sequele as the other agaynst Melancthon.
Ye might wel conclude it against your Pope, that chalengeth such as absolute that all the iudgement of doctrine shoulde to him to iudge according as he please bot quite besides, and quite contrarie to Gods worde.
As though (say you) there had not bene a statute made declaring and enacting the Queenes maiestie, yea hir highnesse successours (without exception or limitation of godly and vngdly, and yet trowe no Bishops) to be the supreme gouernour in all things and causes as well spirituall as temporall.
The statute declareth hir highnesse supreme gouernment· without limiting it vnder the Bishops gouernment.
Ergo, the Bishops can not iudge of true doctrine, and the Princes gouernment is without all limitation.
As though their were no difference betwéene supreme gouernment, and euery other gouernment, or betwéene gouernment and iudgement.
And as though the statute not it selfe, what kinde of supreme gouernment is ylded in all things and causes Ecclesiasticall, nothing debarring the Bishops and ministers of their iudgement and ministerie, but rather ouerséeing them to giue their iudgement and administration rightly.
As though you master Horne (say you) had not written, that in both tables the Prince hath authoritie to erect· and correct, to farther and restraine, to allow and punish, the vertue and vices thereto apperteyning.
As though your selfe M. Stapl. had not written also, and graunted the same euen right now, and that not for your selfe onely, but for all your followes besides, to agree with Melancthon and Caluin therein.
Or as though (say you) the gouernour in all causes, is not also a iudge in all causes· Or as though M. St. his gouernment or iudgment were any preiudice to the gouernment or iudgement that belongeth to the Pastours office.
Or as though (say you) it were not commonly so taken and vnderstanded of a thousand in England, which haue taken the othe to their great domnaion, but if they repent.
Or as though not rather on the contrarie, it were not your so wilfull and malitious mistaking of it, with a peuish obstinacie to withstande the manifest truth, that refuse the othe of your dutifull obedience, to your great damnation in deede, but if yee repent betymes.
And thus still aunswering your As though, with another as though: ye can finde no contradiction nor absurditie neyther in Melancthon, Caluin, Master Nowell, nor the Bishops sayings herein.
As though· your selfe the meane time were clere aboorde, and not in euery one of your quarels, either mst fonde and absurde, or quite contrarie to your owne sayings and graunts made so late before.
You therefore master Horne· which talke so confusely and generally of the Princes authoritie in both tables, do yet say nothing nor proue nothing this generall and absolute authoritie in all things and causes, as lustily without exception the othe expresseth, and therefore ye bring indeed nothing to proue your principall purpose, to the which all your proues shoulde be directed.
For generall and confuse talke of the princes authoritie, you belie the Bishop master Stap. he made so plaine and flatte a limitation that you coulde not abide it· it is your Pope that chalengeth such a general and absolute authoritie, and your selfe that talke of the Princes authoritie confusely, to deface Princes, as confounding and intermedling· in the office and authoritie prteyning to the clergie, whiche the othe requireth not, further than such supreme authoritie, as ouerseth, careth, prouideth for, directeth, and gouerneth all matter persons Ecclesiasticall and temporal, so well in matters of the first table, as in the seconde, that is to say, so well in all spirituall or ecclesiasticall matters, as temporall.
So farre as perteynes to externall discipline, and belongs to externall behauiour.
And this is not onely the issue in question, but also (as is proued) comprehe~deth the othe and principall purpose, whervpon ye call so fast, to haue all the proues directed therto, as the Bishop here hath done, and your selfe hath graunted the same.
Your third part is a quarelling at the sentence of s. Paule cited by the B. Tim.
that kings and rulers are ordeyned of God for these two purposes, that their people mighte liue a peaceable lyfe, throughe their gouernment, both in godlinesse, and in honestie, comprehending in these two wordes, whatsoeuer is commaunded in the first or second table.
Here as ye sée hath the Bishop cited once againe another sentence oute of the new testament: how fitly to the matter, how effectuall to the purpose, we shall sée anon.
Onely now note it to shew your former vntruth M. St. saying the Bishop onely cited a sentence or two out of the new testament besides your frowarde blindnesse the more to be noted herein.
For as there ye could not, or would not sée this sentence, as other that you omit likewise: so here ye note particulerly nothing so much as this onely sentence, yea you will not let escape the aduantage (as you conceyued) of one word, yet the word, and al, when al is done, maketh cleane against you.
For where, in citing this sentence, the B. (by the way of a parenthesis) alleged S. Augustines interpretation for the worde godlinesse, to import the true and chief or proper worship of God: M. Stap. obiecteth falsehood and vntrue reporte, or at least mistaking of S. Augustine.
And concludeth thereon a generall so aptly and truely ye alleage your doctours.
Alacke master Stap. that ye shoulde be driuen to these thiftes, that finding no iust matter wherein to improue the Bishop, ye runne to such trifling quarels as this: As though the Bishop had some great foyle by Saint Augustines wordes, or they had bene so darke and mysticall, that they coulde not lightly haue béene vnderstood.
Saint Augustines wordes are these: Sed loquemar de hominis sapientia, &c.
But we wil speake of the wisedome of man, howbeit of true wisedome, that is according to God the true chiefe worship of him, which in one word is in Greke called [undefined span alphabet] VVhich name our men (as we haue alreadie declared) willing also to interprete it in one woorde, called it godlinesse.
VVhen godlinesse among the Greekes is more vsually called [undefined span alphabet], but [undefined span alphabet], bycause it can not perfitely be interpreted in one woorde, is interpreted better in two woordes, so that it is rather called Gods worship.
Thus farre S. Augustine: and what is here that swerueth from the B. saying? That S. Augustine interpreteth godlynesse the true worship of God.
Which as it is true in both wordes (for what signifieth [undefined span alphabet] but ageed, iust, lawfull, and godly worshippe) so S. Augustine vnderstode it in both wordes, although the one in vsuall speach want a proper Latine name, as hath the other.
And likewise in our Englishe tongue, while we would expresse Gods worship, which is two wordes after the Latine, and woulde terme it in one worde, we call it Godlynesse, as S. Augustine telleth howe the Latines called it Pietas.
True it is that S. Paule vseth the worde [undefined span alphabet] which the Bishop denieth not.
Neyther haue ye anye more fault to finde with his, than with S. Augustines, or any others tra~slation calling it godlynesse.
If ye be so angry that the Bishop shoulde say it meaneth Gods seruice, why be ye not angry with your selfe? Do ye not sée how like a blynde hobbe about the house (as ye merily terme it) ye rp your selfe vpon the scnce? for did not your selfe both in the beginning of this Chap. tell vs, that in the first table consisted the true religion and spiritual seruice that is due from man to God? And also euen in this your further finding fault, ye confesse, that by their peaceable gouernement we might with more quiet attende to Gods seruice: and that this was S. Paules only meaning, and no further: which were it so, yet thereby then ement, not onely godlinesse of lyfe, but also Gods seruice as your self interpret it, yet ye blame the Bishop for saying S. Augustine interpretes it.
But the Bishop not only proued this to be S. Augustines minde by this sentence alone, but by sentences afterward, all which it pleased you to let alone, and go sneaking by them, and come peaking in with this.
Howbeit, euen in this to satisfie ye further, ye shal sée that this is not only S. Augustines exposition, by this worde Godlynesse, to vnderstande Gods seruice and true religion: but the exposition of other fathers also.
Chrysostome vnderstandeth this woorde Godlynesse so largely, that it comprehendeth al truh offaith, doctrine, religion integitie of life also.
Omne inquit dogma. &c. Euery opinion (saith he) is made perfect not onely with godlynesse, but also with integritie of life.
or godlinesse is also to be sought for in that part.
For, what auayleth it, if keping the godlynesse of faith, thou art wicked in workes.
That in peace, in tranquilitie of minde, and quietly we myght serue God the Lorde. &c.
That therefore these things might bee kept, quietnesse is necessary, that acceptable obedience might bee rendred vnto God.
So Haio, Pietas st ulius religio onipotentis des. &c. Godlynesse is the worship and religion of almightie God.
Cum omni pietate castitate, with all godlynesse and chastitie, id est, ultu, religione, integritate fides, that is to say, the worship, and religion, and integritie of fayth.
And Lyra himselfe, In omni pietate, id est, cultu dei debite, In all godlynesse, that is to say, in the dutfull worship of God.
So likewyse Hygh the Carinall, In omni pietate, in cultu religione diuina· In all godlynesse, that is, in the worship and diuine religion.
Et integritate fides, hac duo sunt necessaria, vt fides interior seruetur incorrpta, cultiu exterior diuin in omnibus teneatur.
And in chastitie, that is, in the integritie of faith, these two are necessarie, that the inwarde ayth shoulde be kept incorrupted· and that the outwarde worship should be holden in all diuine things.
This sufficeth to cléere the Bishop of wresting the signification of the worde Godlynesse, affirming it to meane the true, chiefe, or proper worship of God, contrarie to your péeuishe wresting, although therein ye contrarie your owne selfe, confessing also that it meaneth Gods seruice, and yet ye quarrell thereat in the Bishop, saying: As though Princes hauing charge therof, should also haue authoritie to appoint such worship.
If ye meane by appointing such absolute authoritie as your Pope vsurpeth: that the appointment, of what he please to appoynt for a worship and seruice of God, belongeth to him: it is but your ordinarie surised slaunder, and is the proper doing of your Pope.
If ye meane a charge to appoint or commaund, that the only true religion which God hath appointed, be set forth, and by the ministers of God obserued: It is playne, ye S. Paule and al these fathers ment no lesse.
Nay say you, S. Paule speaketh here of no such, or of any authoritie at all in Princes, but only that by their peaceable gouerme~t, we might with the more quiet attende to Gods seruice.
What, M. St? speaketh S. Paule there of no authoritie at all in Princes? saith he not in most plaine wordes: for kings and all men that be in authoritie? Haue those that be in authoritie, no authoritie at all? What a saying is this, and yet sée how your selfe confute your selfe.
Going about to embarre their authority, ye say, he me~ioned their peaceable gouernme~t· He did so in déede M. St.
But what gouernment, or what peaceable estate of gouernment had they, if they had no authoritie at all.
It sée meth that while ye to saye somewhat against their authoritie, )) ye neyt, regarde nor can tell what ye say of them, nor of the Apostles eyther, to maintayne your false quarrell.
Now, as ye further procéede, so still ye bring your selfe more in the briers.
But will yee knowe (say you) M. Hone, why thapostles both Saint Peter and Saint Paule so earnestly taught at that time obedience to Princes? Ha, go to then M. St. belike they tauht obedience to Princes, more earnestly than your Popishe Prelates haue taught or pract sed since that time, or than your selfe haue her taught vs, not ouer earnestly, but God wote full senderly, or rather by all shifts and fetches of your wits, haue sought to deface and impunt their authoritie.
Yea· howe woulde ye make Saint Paule agrée to himselfe? To say that he speaketh there of no authoritie at all in Princes, and yet that here he taught obedience to Princes so earnestlye.
What obedience taught he, if he taught not their authoritie at all? What earnestnesse vsed he then therein? but let vs sée (as ye would haue vs) what was the cause of the Apostles earnestnesse.
In the beginning of the Church some Christians were of this opinion, that, for that they were Christian men, they were exempted from the lawes of the Infidell Princes, and were not bounde to pay them any tribute, or otherwise to obey them.
To represse and reforme this wrong iudgeme~t of theirs, the Apostles Peter and Paule by you named, diligently employed themselues.
And was this a wrong opinion and iudgement M. Stapleton, and with such earnestnesse and diligence employed of the Apostles Peter and Paule to be repressed and reformed, that Christians, for that they were Christian men, were exempted from the lawes of the Infidell Princes, and were not bound to pay them any tribute, or otherwise to obey them? What a right opinion and iudgement then was this of him, that affirmed not only the same of Infidell Princes, but of Christian Princes to? that we be not bounde by force of anye wordes of Christes sentence (which as latly commaundeth vs, as any of these the Apostles sentences doe) to obey or paye so much as tribute to our Christian Princes? Doe ye not knowe who this was that helde this wrong opinion M. Stapleton? Well, who soeuer it was, thinke be must with shame saye that of him selfe which he spake of another, that eyther hee recanteth as better aduised, or else writeth playne contrary to himselfe.
VVhose sayings can not implye your pretensed gouernment, vnlesse ye will say that Nero the wicked and heathenishe Emperour, was in his time the supreme head of all the Church of Christ, throughout the Empire, as well in causes spirituall as temporall.
As before (M. Stapleton) you captiously restrained Christes generall commaundement of obedience to Princes, only to the Emperour: so doe ye here againe, besides, that ye sticke also in the person, abusing his office, and let the dutie of his office go.
Whereas S. Paule writeth generally, not only for those then present, but for all kinges or any other in authoritie both then and from thenceforth for euer.
And so doe all the Expositours gather a generall rule, for all Christians towards their christian Princes, although Nero and other princes then, were wicked and Heathenishe infidels.
Yet in the duetie of their estate, to the which God had called them, they ought neither to haue bene wicked nor Heathenish Infidels, but godly and faithfll defenders and setters forth of Christ his true religio~.
To reason therfore from such persons abuses, therevpon to denie from all princes the dutie of their lawfull authoritie: is as naughtie an argument, as Nero himselfe was naughtie.
And Chrysostome flatly confuteth this cauill of the Princes person, Ne{que} enin de quouis. &c.
For neyther speake now (sayth he) of any one of the Princes, but of the matter itselfe.
And againe, Propterea non dicit, non enim princeps est. &c. VVherefore hee sayth not, there is no Prince but of God, but he disputeth of the matter it selfe, saying there is no power but of God.
The powers that are, they are from God· As when any wise man sayth, that the woman is knit of God vnto the man: he sayth no other thing, tha~ that God hath ordeyned mariage, not that euery man, how so euer he dwelleth togither with a woman, is ioyned vnto him of God, for, we see many dwelling togither in euill, not according to the lawes of mariage, which yet notwithstanding we impute not vnto God.
This cauillation therefore (how naughtie soeuer the Prince were) restraineth not the Apostles meaning which tendeth to the office and not to the person, least of all to those present persons then liuing.
For were they neuer so wicked, other were good, that knew the dutie of their estate gouernment, exercising it both in the direction of vertues punishment of vices, as well of the first as of the seconde table, this your self haue confessed to be the dutie of Princes, and why had it not bene Neroes duetie to? And praye you what lacketh this of all ecclesiasticall causes, the vertues and vices of the first and seconde table? But ye thinke to escape with this your common exception, saying: And yet in temporall and ciuill matters graunt we ought to be subiect not only to Christians, but euen to infidels also being our Princes, without anye exception of Apostle, Euangelist, Prophete, Priest, or Monke, as ye alleage out of Chrysostome.
And doe you thinke thus in déede M. St. as ye saye? and shall we haue any better holde of you in your graunt once again, be it euen but for temporall ciuil matters? And yet this fayleth much of that ye graunted before, of the first as well as of ye second table.
Be Princes ye Clergies superiors now? Before ye sayds that Princes should take to much vpon them to thinke themselues ecclesiasticall persons superiors, speaking simply of superiours without your distinction of ciuill and temporall or spirituall and ecclesiasticall matters.
It is not vnknown to you that the Pope in no case can abide, no not for ciuill and temporall matters, to be subiect to any Christian Prince or Emperour, but contendeth euen therein also to be the farre superiour: and weareth thrée crownes where the Emperour weareth but one: and that one he hath set on turned off with his foote, and made him kisse his foote, and troad vpon him with his foote, and as his page to holde his stirrop to his foote: and claimes to giue or take awaye his estate.
And you say here (for all estates of the clergie,) VVe ought to be subiect not onely to Christians, but euen to Infidels also being our Princes, without any exception of Apostle, Euangelist, Prophete, Priest, or Monke.
What? and is your Pope none of these Maister Stapleton? an Apostle he is not without a pseudo: nor he calles himselfe an Apostle, but Apostolicall.
Much lesse he is an Euangelist, and least a Prophete, except a lying Prophete.
Sometimes in déede he hath bene a Monke, but is there any Pope not a priest? If he be a Priest, then ought he by your owne confession, to be subiect to the Emperour, and in refusing this subiection, what can ye make of him, but, as your selfe to your Prince: so he to his Prince, a very rebell and vsurper against his prince.
If ye say the Emperour is not his prince: why is he then named the Emperor of Rome, is not ye name of an Emperor, ye name of ye chiefest Principalitie? And then if he be Emperor or king of the Romaines, howe ought not the Pope (being a Romaine, or dwelling at Rome within this Princes kingdome or Empyre be subiect to this king or Emperour at the least (as ye say) in temporall and ciuill matters? Doe ye thinke to escape, in saying, VVe ought to be subiect to our Princes without exception, but he ought not? had thought ye had spoken of all Christiana, and had simply mnt as Chrysostome did (to whome ye referre your selfe) who speaketh in generall of euery man fuer, or whosoeuer thou art, which wordes ye dissemble and omit.
So that if your Pope be of calling, and he be no more a Priest than Pope Ioane, he a soule, be he a bodye: he ought by your owne graunt to subiect to the Emperour of Rome in these matters, not the Emperour to be subiect vnto him.
Whiche the Pope shall vnderstande, owe for his in and for all his ciuill and temporall matters, you woulde bring him to hys olde obedience the Emperour, as he hath bene: thinke he will sall thanke Maister Stapleton for your labour.
But all this subiection (saye you) is but graunted in temporall and ciuill matters.
Doth Saint Paule (Maister Stapleton) alleage this distinction, or Chrysostome, to who~ ye reforro your selfe? no M. St. they make no such restraint, but stretch this obedience, as to al ecclesiastical persons, so principally to all ecl· matters, to the setting forth Gods religon· And so Pauledoth call the Prince Gods minister· And Chrysostome sayth, Neque enim ista subiectio pitatem subuertit, for neyther this subiectio~ ouerturneth godynesse.
And vpon these words, He is the minister of God, a reuenger to him that doth euil: He saith, Againe, least thou shouldst start back, hearing of punishment, correction, and the sword: he mentioneth againe that the Prince fulfilleth the lawe of God, for what though the Prince himselfe know it not? yet God hath so formed and ordeined it.
If therfore either he punish or aduance, he is the minister of God, maintaining vertue, abolishing wickednesse, euen bicause God would haue it so.
By what reason repugnest thou in striuing against him, that bringeth such good things, and goeth before thee, and prepareth a way for thy affaires? for many there are, which at the first exercised vertue for respect of the magistrate, but at the length they cleaued thervnto euen for the feare of God.
For things to come do not so moue the grosser sort, as present things.
He therfore that prepareth the minds of many both with feare and honor, that they may be made fitter for the worde of doctrine, is worthily called the minister of God.
In which words he plainly sheweth that the Princes ministery, wherby he is called Gods minister, consisteth in making vs fit apt receiuers of the word of doctrine, which the minister teacheth, the Prince by punishing or rewarding goeth before, prepareth a waye, and bringeth to vs, making vs apt to receyue, either for feare loue this benefit by his ministrie.
In which work as ye Apostles Preachers, for the vttera~ce of ye word of doctrine, are called the workers togither with God: so the Prince in preparing this way to the worde, making vs apt to it, is likewise said of Chrysostom, that he worketh togither with the will of God.
Wherin as we must not repgne against ye prince, so this obedience that we owe vnto him, is not only in temporall and ciuill matters: but in making vs apt for the worde of doctrine, in which all eccl. matters are comprehended.
Now after M. St. hath thus stoode quarrelling in vain wt the B. allegations, he fourthly entreth into a reply vpon the B. wt other allegations collected out of ye same father Chrysost. thero~ frameth an argument against ye Princes superiority.
In ye forhed wherof he prefixeth this marginal note, ye Priesthode is aboue a kingdom, which note as it is true in ye sense that Chrysost. vnderstandeth it: so maketh it nothing that he is abou him in ye supreme gouernment directio~ of all eccl. causes, which is ye present questio~, ye thing that M. calleth so oste~ at other times vpo~.
But now saith M. St. As contrariwise the Prince himselfe is for ecclesiasticall spirituall causes, subiect to his spiritual ruler.
The boundes of a Kingdome, and of Priesthoode (sayth Chrysostome) are not all one: this Kingdome passeth the other: this King is not knowne by visible things, neither hath his estimation, for precious stones he glistreth withall, or for his gay golden glistring apparel.
The other King hath the ordring of those worldly things: the authoritie of Priesthood commeth from heauen.
VVhatsoeuer thou shalt binde vpon earth, shall be bounde in heaue.
To the King those things that are here in the worlde are committed, but to me celestiall things are committed: VVhen say, to mee, vnderstande to a Priest.
The bodies are co~mitted to the King, the soules to the priest.
The King pardoneth the faultes of the bodie, the Priest pardoneth the faultes of the soule.
The King forceth, the Priest exhorteth, the one by necessitie, the other by giuing councel: the one hath visible armour, the other spirituall.
This principalitie is the greater, and therefore the King doth put his heade vnder the Priestes handes.
And euery where in the olde scripture Priestes did annoynt the Kings.
Among all other bookes of the said Chrysostome, his booke de sacerdotio, is freighted with a number of like and more notable sentences, for the Priestes superioritie aboue the Prince.
For the other sentences in Chrysostome, can not directly aunswere them master Stapleton, till ye set them downe.
thinke they will all come in the ende, to the effect of this sentence here, so often by all yourside alleaged.
Ye cite Chrysostome, as though it were at the full.
Where in déede ye cut off both the heade the middle, and taile of his sentence, whereby (considering the occasion and purpose of his wordes) we might sée that they shoulde not be wrested from his meaning.
Chrysostome vpon these wordes of the Prophet Esay, Factum est anno quo mortus est Ozias rex.
It came to passe in the yere that king Ozias died: after a Preface made of Priestes mariage, taking occasion of the Prophet Esays wife: telleth of Ozias presumption, Uerum hic Ozias, &c. but this Ozias, when he was a crowned King, bicause he was iust, waxed hawtie in minde, and conceyuing a greater courage than was for his estate, entred into the temple.
And what sayth Esay? He entred into the holy of holies, and sayde will offer incense.
He being a King, vsurpeth the principalitie of the priesthood.
And so Chrysostome procéedeth in the sentence cited by you, Alij sunt termini: The boundes of a kingdome, of a priesthood are not al one. &c.
Which sentence ye truly cite, til ye come to these wordes: VVhen say, to me, vnderstand a priest.
And there ye strike of words of Chrysostam, than ye cited.
Partly, for that ye could not abide to heare of any vices or discommendation in priests, therfore ye cull out only that, which soundeth to their praise dignitie.
Partly, for that this would haue made the purpose of Chrysost, playner, reprouing them that diserne not, betwene the office, the perso~.
At which fault your self so late did stu~ble in princes, not discerning between Neroes vices, a princes office.
As in Chrysostoms time, same despised the office of a priest, bicause of the faults of diuerse priests.
The wordes of Chrysostome (folowing those you cite) are these: Therefore when thou seest an vnworthie priest, slaunder not the priesthod.
For thou oughtest not to co~demne the things, but him that euill vseth a good thing.
Syth Iudas also was a traytor, howbeit, for this the order Apostolical is not accused, but the mind of him.
Neither is it the fault of the priesthood, but of the euill mind.
And thou therfore blame not the priesthod, but the priest, that vseth euill a good thing.
For if one dispute with thee, and say, seest thou yonder Christian answere thou: but speak not to thee of the persons, but of the things, or else, how many phisitions haue bene made slaughtermen, haue giuen poisons for remedies? And yet dispise not the arte, but him that euill vseth the arte.
How many shipme~ haue guided euill their ships? yet is not the arte of sayling euill, but the mind of them.
If the Christian man be wicked, accuse not thou the profession the priesthood, but him that euill vseth a good thing.
These are Chrysostomes wordes, which you omit, and then followeth as you recite, Reg corpora &c.
The bodies are co~mitted to the king and so forth, as ye say, til ye come to the knitting vp of the sentence with Ozias, which again you omit.
But that king going beyond his bounds, and passing the measure of the kingdom, atte~pted to adde somwhat more, and entred into the temple, willing with authoritie to offer incense.
VVhat therfore sayth the priest? It is not lawfull for thee Ozias, to offer incense.
Behold libertie: behold a mind that knoweth not bo~dage: behold a tong touching the heauens: behold liberty that cannot be restrained: behold the body of a ma~, the mind of an angel: behold one that goeth on the grou~d, is co~uersant in heaue~.
Tel not me it is a kingdom, where is the transgression of lawes.
It is not lawful for thee (O king) to offer ince~se.
It is not lawful for thee to come into the holy of holies.
Thou passest thy bou~ds: thou sekest things not grau~ted to thee, therfore shalt leese the things thou hast receiued.
It is not lawful for thee to offer ince~se: but this is giuen vnto the priests.
This is not thine, but this is mine: haue vsurped on me thy purple? vsurpe not thou my priesthod.
It is not lawful for thee to offer ince~s but only for the sons of Aaro~.
By this, it plainly appeareth wherevpon Chrysost. speaketh, to wete, of the seuerall functions of the spirituall pastor and the prince and that it is not lawfull for the prince to intrude himself into the office of the diuine minister.
He may not more take vpo~ him to administer the diuine sacraments of christ his church now, although he be the prince (to the which not with standing you admitted wome~) tha~ might Ozias sacrifice then.
For as then God had appoynted who should sacrifice, so hath he apointed who should now minister his sacrame~ts.
Now if ye had shewed that the supreme gouernment ouer ecclesiasticall causes, the ouersight and direction of the setting forth of Gods true religion, the abolishing of false religion, and the deposing of Idolatrous Priestes, that obsinately mainteyne errours, agaynst the expresse worde of God, be the like doing to this fact of Ozias: if ye had proued that the Prince hath euer done or doth, or claymeth to do the like fact to this of Ozias, in ministring the sacrament: then had you alleaged this sentence to some purpose, else maketh it nothing to the purpose, but maketh agaynst your popish mid wiues, they rather play the part of Ozias: It maketh not agaynst ye Q. Maiestie, but most of all against your Pope himselfe, that thinketh he playth the high priests part, and is so farre therfrom, that none is more like than he to this vsurper, entring into the holyest place, and vsurping the priesthood, the sacrifice, the power and the honour that belongeth onely to Iesus Christe himselfe.
As for the office of the true minister of God (which neyther your Pope nor you his shaelings ar) is in déede as Chrysostom sayth both a distinct function from the princes, and hath other boundes, and also we graunt surmounteth farre the boundes of the Princes office, in respect of his spirituall ministerie, of administring the sacraments, of preaching the glad tydings of saluation, of denouncing to the obstinate sinners, the threates of Gods wrath and vengeance: to the penitent, the most comfortable promises of Gods mercie fauour: whose sentence being rightly applyed in earth, God hath promised to ratifie the same in heauen.
And for this cause doth Chrysost· so highly extoll this priesthood, referring all his prayses to the dignitie of his ministerie, in respect whereof, the Princes ministeris is but outwarde and earthly, medling nothing with the administration of this high function, but onely with the supreme charge, ouersight, and gouernment, to sée that the Priest do not abuse this so excellent and spiritual ministerie, but exercise rightly the same according to Gods worde.
Who, so doing, the Prince so well as any other Christian, obeyeth his preaching ministerie, submitteth his head (as Chrysosome saith) vnder the ministers handes, as to Gods messenger, steward, and dispenser of his heauenly mysteries.
But if the Priest be not such an one as Chrysostome describeth: if he do not denounce Gods promises, threaes, nor his worde at all, but as Christ saith of the naughtie seruant, striketh his fellow seruants, and subtraceth their spirituall foode of Gods worde from them, would poyson the~ with such erroniouse foode as he would giue them, besides and contrarie to the worde of God: if he will not be centent with his owne boundes, but will vsurpe also the dignitie that is not due vnto him, but belongeth to the Prince: shall the Prince suffer this at his handes, him selfe to be spoyled of his authoritie and royall estate, and his subiectes pilled of their goods, yea both he and al his subiects, by such a false vsurper tirant Priest, to be robbed and spoiled of their soules foode saluation? Here hath the Prince authoritie to suppresse such wicked Balamites, such counterfaites, such Antichrists what soeuer they be, and to place in their places true and godly ministers, such as Chrysostome here speakes of.
Fro~ which kinde of ministerie your Pope M. St who is your great high Priest, all the inferiour rable of Priests that depende on him, are so farre different: that Chrysostoms sente~ce not only maketh nothing for you, but is cleane against you.
For first, take your owne words, that you cite out of Chrysostome, lay them to your Pope Prelates, and sée how they agrée togither.
This king (saith Chrysstome of the minister or Priest) is not knowne by visible things, neither hath his estimatio~ for preciouse stones he glistereth with all, or for his gay golden ghstering apparell.
Contrarywise your Pope and his prelates (to get the more estimation thereby of the people) are not onely knowen by visible things, but set out them selues, and all their ceremonies to the vttermost, in gay golden glistering apparell, with most gorgeous ouches of siluer, of golde, of pearles, and precious stones.
Againe, this Prieste saith to the King, haue not vsurped thy purple: contrarywise, the Pope hath vsurped Emperours purple, the Emperours Diademe, the Emperours throne, the Emperours Empire and all.
Againe, ye tell vs out of Chrysostome, that the bodies are committed to the King, the soules to the Priest: the King pardoneth the faultes of the bodie, the Priest pardoneth the faultes of the soule: the King forceth, the Priest exhorteth: the one by necessitie, the other by giuing counsell: the one hath visible armour, the other spirituall: he warreth against the barbarous, warre against the Diuell: Contrarywise the Pope warreth against Christ, and with the Diuell, as his generall vicar and Licuetenant, and taketh not onely vppon him the Emperours parte, by warring against the barbarous Turkes and Saracens, but also the Diuels parte by warring against the Saincts truth of God, and that with more horrible treasons, murders, and villanies, than euer was practised among the barbarous.
And entermedleth with faultes of the bodie as whoredome and fornication, not onely bodily to punish them: but also beastly for filthie lucre to maintaine them, and condemneth in Gods ministers godly and honorable wedlocke: which besides the other is a manifest argument, that he is a Priest of no such kinde as Chrysostome here co~mendeth.
For had you M. St. looked better euen in the same Homelie, but the leafe before: ye should haue seene what a notable commendation he maketh of the mariage of Priestes vppon the prophetes wordes, Vidi dominum, &c.
saw the Lorde sitting in an high hrone, &c. Quis hac loquitur, &c. VVho (saith he) spake these thinges? Esay that beholdet of the celestiall Scraphins, which had to deale with mariage, and yet extinguished not grace.
You haue harkened to the Prophet, and you haue heard the Prophet this day.
Go thou out and lasuph thy sonne, neyther must we ouerpasse these thinges.
Yea? had the Prophet a sonne? if he had a sonne, he had a wife also, that thou mayst vnderstande that mariages are not euill, but whooredome is euill.
But so often as we talke with any of the vulgare people saying, why liuest thou not well? wherefore expressest thou not perfect manners? how can (say they) except should go from my wife, except should bid my children farewell, except should bidde my businesse adieu? VVherfore canst thou not? doth matrimonie hinder thee? a wife is giuen thee for an helper, not to lay a snare for thee.
Had not the Prophet a wife? neither did wedlocke hinder the grace of the spirite, and yet he kepte companie togither with his wife, and was a Prophet neuerthelesse.
Had not Moses a wife? and yet he brake the rocke, he changed the ayre, he talked with God, he stayde the diuine wrathe.
Had not Abraham a wife? and yet he was made a father of Nations, and of the Churche: for he got his sonne Isaac, and he was to him a matter of notable affayres.
Did he not offer his Sonne, the fruit of his mariage? was he not a father, and withall a louer of God? might not he see him selfe a sacrificer to be made of his owne bowels? a sacrificer say and a father withall: nature to be ouercome, godlinesse to ouercome: his bowels to be troden downe, his godly deedes to surmount: the father to be cast downe, and the louer of God to be crowned: hast thou not seene the whole ma~, both a louer of his son and of God? was matrimonie here an hindra~ce? but what saist thou to the mother of the Machabees? Was she not a wife? added she not seuen sonnes to the felowship of the saincts? did she not see them crowned with martyrdom· did she not stand by as a looker vppon, and not aint in hir minde? stoode she not by exhorting euery one of them, and being the mother of the martyrs, suffred selfe seuen martirdoms? for while they were tormented she receyued the stroke.
Neither yet without affections beheld she he things that were done.
She was the mother, and the violence done to nature, declared hir proper vertue.
But what say we to Peter, the maine piller of the Church, that veheme~t louer of Christ: he that in speach was vnlearned, conquerour of Rhethoritia~s: he that was vnskilfull, stopped the philosophers mouthes: he that dissolued the Greeke wisdome, no otherwise tha~ the webbe of spiders: he that trauailed through the world, cast the net into the sea and fished the world? but what saith the Gospell? Iesus entred vnto Peters wiues mother, being sicke of a feuer.
VVhere a wiues mother is, there is a wife, and there is wedlocke.
But what say we to Philip, had he not foure daughters? but where soure daughters were, there was both a wife and matrimonie.
But what then doth Christ? he was indeede borne of a virgin, but he came to a mariage, and brought his gift with him.
They haue (saith she) no wine, and he turned water into wine, with virginitie honoring mariage: commending with his gift the thing that was done, that thou shouldest not abhorre mariage· but shouldest hate whooredome.
For at my perill behoofe the saluation, although thou shalt wed a wife.
Looke to thy selfe, a woman if shee be good, is an helper to thee &c.
All this more saith Chrysostome, in the co~mendation of the ministers mariage, euen in the same Homelie cited by you M. St. which estate of mariage to be ioyned in, sith the Pope his Priests can not abide, and alleage such impediments as here Chrysostome confuteth: it is an euident argument (by the way) that they nothing lesse than such Priests as Chrysostome ascribeth this spirituall kingdome of the ministerie of Gods worde and Sacraments vnto. and where Chrysostome (as your selfe haue cited him) saith that the Princeforceth the Priest exhorteth: the one by necessitie, the other by giuing counsell: the one hath visible armour, the other spirituall: Contrarywise, your Pope not only exhorteth, but extorteth and forceth too not only by counsell, but by necessine extreme violence.
Not only pretending spirituall armour, such as he calleth his curses with booke, bell, and candle: but also with visible armour, muironed about (where he rideth, or on mens backes is caried) with a gard of Swartrutters Switchers, with gunnes, Harquebushes, partesans, glayues, and weapons, as if it were Iudas with his armed bande to take our Sauiour Christ.
And he claymeth thriurisoiction of oth the swords, wresting thert the wordes of the Disciple: Ece gladi hic: Beholde heere are two swordes: to the temporall and visible armour, so well as to the spiritual: Wherevpon Eonifacius the eight, did not onely hang seuen keyes at his girdle, in token of his spirituall power: but girte him selfe also with a sworde, in token of his temporall power.
These Prelates the refore are not such kinde of Priests as Chrysostome speaketh of.
Neither not this, as a fault in this or that person, but as errours defended and maynteined by them, for the aduauncement of their naughtie Priesthoode.
What maketh then this sentence of the excellencie of the Priestes ministerie, for the ministerie of the Popes Priesthoode, that is all the quit contrarie? Suche false Priestes therefore the Prince hath authoritie to remoue them, and to place such Priests as Chrysostome speaketh of, and so to bowe his head vnder their hands, that is, to oey their ministerie, which is no derogation to the matter in hande of the Princes supreme gouernement.
Thus muche M. Stap. to your sentence alleaged out of Chrysostome, vpon the which you and all your side do harpe so often, and yet (beeing well considered) it not onely makes nothing for you, but muche agaynst you.
Nowe to your argument that ye gather héere vpon, saying: Nowe then M. Horne, frame you suche an argument.
The Priest is the Princes superiour in some causes ecclesiasticall: Ergo, The Prince is not the Priestes superiour in all causes ecclesiasticall.
The antecedent is clearely proued out of the words of Chrysostome before alleaged.
The Priest is superiour to the Prince in remission of sinnes by Chrysostome· but remission of sinnes is a cause ecclesiastical or spirituall: Ergo, The Priest is the Princes superiour in some causes ecclesiasticall or spirituall.
To this argument béeing thus framed (vpon the which M. Stap greatly triumpheth,) answere, it hath thrée fallations in it for fayling.
The first, in this worde superiour, béeing vnderstoode two ways, either in respect of the ministerie or function, or in respect of the publique ouersight, ordering and direction.
The Priest is superiour to the Prince, in respect of his ministerie or function.
But this worde superiour, béeing thus vnderstoode in the conclusion, for superioritie onely in the ministerie or function, concludeth nothing agaynst the Princes superioritie, which is only the publike ouersight, ordering and direction, that this superiour ministerie and function be not abused.
Now if the word superiour be not thus vnderstoode, but simply to be the superiour: or in the later sense, that is to say, the Priest is superiour in the publike ouersight, ordering and direction, that the office be duely administred by the minister: then is this maior false, for the Priest is not thus the Princes superiour.
The second fallation is in the words remission of sinnes.
If he meane thereby the ouersighte to sée suche remission be duely made by the Priest: then is the maior also false.
If he means by remission of sinnes, the action of remitting them, or the function of the office, in pronouncing them remitted: then is the maior true, but the minor false: For so remission of sins is not a cause ecclesiasticall, but an action or function ecclesiasticall.
Wheron ariseth the third fallation of these words ecclesiasticall cause Which the statute and the title mentioning, that the Prince hath supremacie in all ecclesiasticall causes, he wilfully wresteth, as though all actions and functions eccl. were yéelded to the Princes supremacie.
Where neither the Prince requireth, nor the statute title yéeldeth any such supremacie in the actions, but onely a supremacie in the causes, not to do them, but to sée them rightly done.
And thus by resolutio~ of these words, it appeareth how the Priest in one sense, as Chrysostome sayth, is superiour to the Prince, not only in this one thing of remission of sinnes: But in al other actions of his dutie, and the Prince is farre inferiour to him: and yet the Prince in the other sense of the general direction, and publike ouersight, is in this and all other causes eccl. superiour to the Priest, and the Priest farre inferiour vnto him.
And so the superioritie of the Priest hindreth nothing the supremacie of the Prince.
Master St. (hauing now as he thinketh by this mightie argument wonne the fielde, and quite confounded the Byshop) setteth out as a tropham or monument of his historie this marginall note.
Euidently proued by S. Chrysostome, the Prince not to be the supreme gouernour in causes ecclesiasticall.
And crieth out for ioy: Which being most true, what thing ca~ you co~clude of al ye haue or shal say to win your purpose, or that ye heere presently say? And thus on the triumph of this argument, M. St. reiecteth all that the B. hath said as insufficie~t, would returne vpon him the sentence of S. Augustine against the Donatists, that the Byshop cited agaynst M. Feck.
Wherein he bringeth nothing a freshe, that is not before declared and answered vnto, besides vayne words of course, worthy no other answere, than to be returned vpon the~ selues, to who~ they properly appertayne: who in deede denie both Chryst the head, and Christ the body, that is, his catholike Church.
And that as the Donatistes secte was condemned by Constantine, Honorius, and other Emperours, the highe kings of Christendome.
So haue they withall condemned you master Stapl. that followe the Donatistes, and so may and ought all christian Princes, the Emperour nowe (whose highe kingdomes, besides a bare name in any matter of Christianitie, ye make nothing) to pull downe suche vsurpers of their highe kingdomes, and set vp true and godly ministers in their places: to whome they might and ought to submitte their heades, vnder their spirituall ministerie.
To the whiche sorte (as is shewed playnely out of Chrisostome) your Popishe Priesthoode is cleane contrarie.
And therefore to returne your wordes vpon your selfe: Ye are they that cutte in sunder the vnitie and peace of Christes Churche, and rebell agaynst the promises of his Gospell.
Which Gospell ye can not abyde should come to light, and therefore the highe kinges of Christendome should remoue and condemne you.
Whiche is a better argumente than yours, M. Stap. and is sufficient to inferre the supremacie of these highe Kings and Princes.
THe Bishop in his diuision prosecuting still the wordes of S. Paule Rom.
proueth further out of Chrysostome and Eusebius, that as the Prince is Gods minister: so this ministerie consisteth not onely in ciuill and temporall, but also in the well ordering of the Church matters, and their diligent rule and care therein.
The Prince (as Chrysostome sayth) prepareth the mindes of many to be made more appliable to the doctrine of the worde, and is the great lighte and true preacher and setter foorth of true godlynesse, as Eusebius sayth: Ergo, His ministerie consisteth as well in ecclesiasticall as ciuill causes.
The antecedent Eusebius proueth by the example of Constantine, that his ministerie stretched to the setting foorth of godlynesse to al countreyes, and that he preached God, and not onely ciuil lawes by his Imperiall decrees and Proclamations.
And this he confirmeth by Constantines own confession, that he taughte by his ministerie the religion and lawe of God: that therby he caused the encrease of the true fayth.
And by the same put away and euerthrewe all the euils that pressed the worlde.
But the world in Constantines time was pressed with diuers schismes, errours, heresies, false religions, and many ecclesiasticall abuses and superstitions, besides the heathen Idolatrie: Ergo, His ministerie stretched not onely ouer temporall causes, but also ecclesiasticall.
It belongeth to the Prince as well, if not more than the other.
And so the Bishops argument followeth héerevpon, that the Apostles sentence (the Prince is Gods minister) argueth the Princes charge and gouernement, in all maner causes ecclesiasticall, so well as temporall.
These proues of the Byshop béeing so euident, M. Stap. answereth they are all insufficient, saying: see ye not (master Horne) come as yet neere the matter.
answere, who is so blinde as he that seeth and will not see? Were ye not of the number of those, of whome Chryst sayth, came to iudgeme~t into this worlde, that those that see not, shoulde see, and those that see shoulde be made blind: Ye might then both clearely see, that he both co~meth neere the matter, and satisfieth it at large.
Excepte ye be as blinde of the matter also, as ye pretende to be of these the Byshops proufes.
But if ye woulde haue followed your owne counsell, euer to haue set before your eyes the state of the question in issue betwéene them: ye shoulde well by this time haue seene, that the Byshop digressed nothing fro~ it.
And that your selfe of self will or malice, will not looke aright theron, but cleane awrie, stil starting aside and swaruing fro~ the marke for the nonce, to picke occasions wheron to wrangle.
For, wherfore pray you do ye not see, that the Bishop commeth not neere the matter? see not (say you) that Constantine changed religion, plucked downe Altares, deposed Byshops, &c.
But that he was diligent in defending the olde and former faythe of the Christians.
Whatsoeuer you see or see not in Constantine, master Stapl. all the world may see false dealing in you: and how lyke an vnnaturall subiecte, to your naturall Prince ye be.
As thoughe ye sawe that the Quéenes highnesse had changed religion, excepte ye meane false religion, and that ye might haue seene in Constantine also.
He changed the heathen religion of the Paynims, and abolished it, with all their Altares, Byshops, Priestes and temples, and set foorth the true religion of Iesus Christe.
He chaunged likewise and abolished suche superstitions, Idolatries, schismes, errours and heresies, as troubled the Churche of Christe in his time.
Which you might easily haue seene in Constantines owne wordes by the Byshop cited, That he put away and ouerthre we all the euils that pressed the worlde.
If you say, ye can not yet see that he ment all spirituall and ecclesiasticall euils, so well as temporall: put on a payre of spectacles, master Stapl that are not dymmed with affection, and then shall ye see, that of suche kinde as the good thinges were, whiche he set foorth, of suche kinde were the contrarie euils, that he put away and ouerthrew: but the good things that he set foorthe, were true godlynesse, decrees of God, the religion of the moste holy law, the most blessed fayth. &c.
All whiche are matters moste spirituall and ecclesiasticall: Ergo all the euils that he abolished, were so well spirituall and ecclesiasticall as ciuill and temporall matters.
If ye say, yet ye see nothing but that he was diligent in defending the olde and former fayth of the Christians.
True in deede, neither can ye see any other thing in the Quéenes Maiestie, nor any authoritie is giuen héereby to Princes, than as Constantine was, to bee diligente in defending the olde and former fayth of the Christians, founded by Christ and taught by his Apostles.
And if any other since that time, haue brought in any things besides that old and former fayth, to remoue the same, and reduce vs to the olde and former fayth of the Christians.
For as Tertullian sayth: That is of the Lorde, and that is truthe, that was before deliuered, but that which afterward was thrust in, is bothe strange and false.
And so sayth Constantine, bothe called agayne mankind (taught by my ministerie) to the religion of the most holy lawe, and also caused the moste blessed fayth should encrease grow vnder a better gouernor.
Nowe séeing that many poynts of the Popish fayth and doctrine haue cropen in since that time, and manie of later yeres, besides and contrarie to the olde and former fayth of the Cheistians, taught by Christ, and left vs written by the finger of the holy ghost, sealed and confirmed by so many myracles, to endure to the worlds end, and neuer to be altered, added vnto, or taken from: all suche nouelties besides or contrarie to the olde and former fayth, hathe the Q. highnes (god be tha~ked therfore) remoued, as Co~sta~tine did, and all Princes ought to do: and hath called vs agayne to the religion of the most holy lawe, as a most diligent defender of the olde and former fayth, from the Popishe corruptions in faith that haue sprong vp since.
And as Consta~tine deposed such Bishops as obstinately mainteined those later errours, and not the olde and former fayth (except on their repentance submission they were by him restored) so hath our most gracious souer aigne, deposed such Popish Bishops and Pastors, as obstinately defended and mainteined their later errours.
Wherin she hath shewed hir selfe, a moste diligent defender and recouerer, of the oldest and formost fayth of the Christians.
Thus as hir doings swarue not héerein from Constantines· (as you pretende) so hath she no lesse right and authoritie in hir dominion, than Constantine had in his, and all Princes ought to haue in theirs: béeing all (as S. Paule sayth) Gods ministers in this behalfe.
To the which sente~ce of S. Paule, with Chrysostomes and Eusebius iudgement theron, full coldely, ye say: If S. Paule call the ciuill Magistrate a minister, bicause through feare he constrayneth the wicked to embrace the godly doctrine, as by your saying S. Chrysostome construeth it, we are well content therwith.
Now well ye be content therwith, as your obstinate refusal of this the Princes ministerie, the stormes counterblastes ye rayse agayn~st it, do declare: so also, that ye be not halfe pleased with Chrysostomes construction theron (how well soeuer ye would seeme to be contented) appeareth in this your pinching wringing of Chrysostomes sentence by ye Bishop cited.
For neither the Bishop cited him as you say he doth, neither you cite Chrysostome fully nor rightly, whiche argueth ye are not very well contented therwith, Chrysostome sheweth not, that ye prince is called ye minister of God, onely bicause through feare he constrayneth the wicked to embrace the godly doctrine, but also he speaketh of honoring co~mending, or aduancing, whereby he prepareth mens mindes to be the more apte to receyue the worde of doctrine.
Which phrase of Chrysostome, the worde of doctrine, ye could not also abide, least ye should haue ouerturned thereby, all those points of doctrine, that are not contained in the worde of God, whiche neuerthelesse ye terme godly doctrine, though God in his worde hath not allowed the same, but are the traditions and commaundements of men.
And thus making what doctrine it liketh you godly or vngodly, and reseruing to your selues the authoritie thereof, ye say, ye are well content that the ciuill magistrate be a minister, bicause through feare he co~strayneth, that is to say, ye make him serue your turne, to hang, to draw, to burne, to racke, to banish, to emprison, and to force men to embrace what doctrine you appoint and tell him, is godly doctrine.
And that this is his setting forth of Christes true religion, that this is his preaching the same with his imperiall decrees and proclamations.
But if once he take vppon him carefully to examine by the worde of God, whether those doctrines and that religion that ye pretende to be godly, and the old and former faith, be so or no: and finding them cleane contrary, he remoue them, by force co~straine his subiects to embrace the doctrine of Gods worde, and so prepare them to receyue the truth, by punishing the wicked and obstinate seducers, by placing in their roumes, and honoring the godly setters forth of the worde of doctrine: then in no case ye are well content therewith, but raile at, and sclaunder the doings of such a Prince, and deuise al the trecheries that ye can to his destruction.
Neuerthelesse would ye well consider what here once againe M. St. you haue grau~ted, That the best ministerie and seruice of the great Constantine rested in the setting foorth of Gods true religion: Then if the setting forth thereof, be the Princes best ministery and seruice: may he not Iudge of his best ministery and seruice? yea how shall he set forth that, whereof he shall not iudge? Of other partes of his ministerie he may iudge, and may he not Iudge of his beste ministerie? are the setting forth of ciuill lawes, properly a part of his office, bicause they be a good parte of his ministerie, is the setting forth of true religion, being the best parte (as ye are content to call it) no parte at al thereof? or not rather if it be his best ministerie, it is the best part of his office also.
And seing the setting forth of true religio~ is not properly a ciuill matter, but distinct therefrom: then doth the beste parte of the Princes office consist in the ministerie of an ecclesiasticall matter, and that of such an one, as containes the ouersight of all other matters ecclesiasticall.
For as in true religion they are or ought to be all co~teyned, so in the setting forth of the~ is co~tained their ouersight direction.
For how can he well set forth any thing, that he ouereeth not, nor directeth? which ouersight and direction being the supreme gouernment that the Quéenes Maiestie only claymeth and we ascribe vnto hir: how haue ye not graunted withall (M. St.) that this supremacie ouer all causes Ecclesiasticall, aboue all other things belongeth to hir Maiestie? But, for all this that he him selfe hath graunted, or the Bishop hath inferred, saith M. Stapleton: Neither this that ye here alleage out of place, nor al the residue which ye reherse of this Co~stantine (with whose doings ye furnish hereafter sixe full leaues) can importe this superioritie, as we shall there more at large specifie.
This is alleaged out of place ye say M. St. for Constantine.
But who seeth not, that this is but a pelting quarrel? the Bishop on good consideration order declareth, both by Chrysostoms exposition, Constantines example, how this sentence of S. Paule, that the Prince is Gods minister, stretcheth not only to his ministerie, in ciuil, but also in causes Ecclesiastical.
It is no meruaile M. Stap. if it séeme out of place with you, for all is alleaged out of place, that hauing any place displaceth your assertion.
And thus pretending it is alleaged out of place: ye passe it ouer, post vs offil an other time, when ye wil declare it more at large, ad Calendas Graecas, when ye shall haue more leasure.
But sir, had ye any leasure at this time, ye might better haue satisfied your Reader, to haue fully answered here, to that is here obiected, and not thus to dallie off the matter till another time.
But there is no remedie, the reader must haue pacie~ce, and waite your furder leasure.
Neuerthelesse, when ye shall (M. St. vouchsafe to méete againe, to common furder of Constantines doings, pray ye do not, as hitherto ye haue done in other answears, telling the reader ye will specifie it more at large in such a place hereafter, when ye come to the answering of that place, ye tell him againe, that ye specified that more at large before, and so sende your Reader from hence thither, and from thence againe hither, to trotte vp and down, he satisfied in neither place.
Howbeit, this is a good readie answere for you, for by this shift, one answere serueth both places.
Neuerthelesse what néede any more large specifying either hers or there? For ye tell vs roundly to make a shorte tale of the matter that all is to shorte.
Neither this, say you· that is here alleaged, neither al the residue, which ye reherse of Constantine, (with whose doings ye furnish hereafter six ful leaues) ca~ import this superioritie.
This is in déede a round answere and a shorte, and if it were withall as true· ye néede not M. Stapleton promise to specifi it more at large hereafter, but belike ye thought this answere was to short, and therefore ye do well to referre the Bishop furder.
As for the Bishops present allegation out of Constantine, fully importeth this superioritie, that the ministerie of the Prince hath to set forth Ecclesiasticall causes so well as Temporall, or rather much more, in so muche as it is the Princes best ministerie, to set forth by his decrees the true religion, the lawe of God, and the most holy faith, and to remoue and punish all euils, that trouble the worlde, such as chiefly are errours, Heresies, Schismes, superstitio~s, abuses, false or wicked pastors, &c. all which is euident by Constantines owne auouching.
And pray you M. St. marke all these things a little more aduisedly, tell me then what wanteth of the issue in question betwene these parties, that the Prince hath supreme gouernment, so well in Ecclesiasticall causes, as in Temporall.
And whether these be facings without proufe or halfe proufe in the world, as ye say: or rather these be not your to to impudent facings and bracings, without any proufe or half proufe or any iote of proufe in the world, but say only it importeth it not, neither tel· how nor why: and say it is here alleaged out of place: and ye will specifie it there more a large: and so shift it off here vnanswered: and there say here ye haue answered to it: and neither here nor there meddle furder withit.
Doth (this trow) you importe a full sufficient answere? The.
WHereas the Bishop on S. Paules sentence declared before, out of Eusebius, commending Constantine, that the Princes best ministerie consisteth in setting forth all true Religion, and abolishing all false doctrine and errours: in this Diuision he confirmeth the same with the iudgement of another later Ecclesiasticall historier, Nicephorus, whom the Papists set out for Catholike: Comparing in these things, these two Emperours, the one with the other, Paleologus with Constantine, commending this Emperour of Gréece aboue al other things, for this his rule and dealing in reforming religion, as did Constantine.
For which cause, as Constantine called it his best ministerie, so Nicephorus calleth it, a vertue among all other belonging to an Emperour, and most seemely for his imperiall dignitie.
which what it is, and wherein this ministerie doth chiefly consist, the Bishop gathereth togither diuerse sentences, out of the Preface of Nicephorus to the Emperour, in his commendation, for his zeale, his defence, his chiefe authoritie, his gouernaunce, his restoring, his clensing, his establishing, his setting forth of true religion, and pulling downe the contrarie: whereby Nicephorus (protesting that he speaketh nothing for fanor, or statterie) declareth his iudgement to agrée with Eusebius on Saint Paules sentence, that the Princes supreme gouernment in these things, is his best ministerie, and most properly belonging to hys charge and office.
To this allegation of Nicephorus Master Stapleton deuideth his Counterblast into two windes.
The former blast procéedeth altogither out of his stinking breath of rayling Rhetorike, to deface not onely the Bishop his aduersarie, the Bishop of Sarum, and the Homelies set forth agaynst Idolatrie, chalenging them for lyes and forgeries: but also to deface the authoritie of Nicephorus and the Emperour, whome he affyrmeth to be wicked and wretched Heretikes.
In the other blast, admitting the authoritie of Nicephorus, he bloweth as fast to ouercome the force of the Bishops allegations, as insufficient to proue hys purpose.
In his first part, to get the more credite for plaine and true dealing with his Reader, and to blemish the Bishop with suspition of cloked dissembling, he promiseth, saying: But first, we will dissipate and discusse the mist that master Horne hath cast before thine eyes, where indéede none was, for the Bishop most clearely set downe the wordes of Nicephorus.
Master Stapleton himselfe of purpose rayseth a miste, whereby not onely he dimmeth the Readers eyes, but also wandreth in his owne mist vp and downe, slunbling at many impertinent matters, and al besides the purpose.
For whereto else serueth all that he discourseth about the Greians Heresie of the holy Ghostes procéeding, or the Councell of Lions, of Michaell Palelogus that agréed with the Latins therein, of the recians reuolt, of the malicious spite of the Gréeke Bishoppes, of the denying Michaell his buriall, what néede all these declarations? Which if the Bishop had set forth, as he had nothing thereby opened the matter, so had he giuen occasion to Master Stapleton of iust reproouing him for straying of purpose from the marke, and dalying in vayne circumstaunces.
And nowe that he hath not stoode in anye suche long and fodings off of the matter, master Stapleton sayeth he casteth mistes.
And thus which way soeuer the Bishop take· Master Stapleton woulde finde an occasion to picke a quarrell.
And pretending to dissipate and discuse a myste, in the fayre and cleare Sunne shyne, hée rayseth suche a smoke, that blundering foorth he wotteth not well whether, he stuibleth hee can not tell on whome, and falleth into a bitter innectiue at the authour of the Homelie· agaynst Idolatrie, onely vpon this occasion, that he chaunced on the name of Michaell Paleologus.
Wherein he playeth, as heard once of a opishe Priest in Cambrige that in his Sermon naming Abraham in his discourse, to dissipate and discusse all mystes, as he pretended, but most likely to stretche out his matter, beganne to tell what manner a man Abraham was, and hauing named his sonne, beganne to tell of Isaac, and so of Iacob, and on a rowe of all the twelue Patriarkes, and of Egypte, of the lande of promiss, of the wildernesse, and waded so farre that he had quyte loste himselfe in the Wildernesse, and his theame be beganne withall.
After whiche sorte fareth Master Stapleton, bicause the Bishoppe mentioned Michaell Paleologus, herevppon he entreth into an exclamation agaynste the Authour of the Apologie.
All whiche though it be a plaine digression from the Bishoppes aunswere, and the issue in question, beeing aboute Images and Idolatrie: yet such is his importunitie, we muste followe master Stapleton, not whether the cause requireth, but whether hys ydle brayne pleaseth to runne at randon.
Otherwise, the principall parte of this Counterblast beeing reiected to hys common place of other impertine~t bibblebables: he would crie oute that hée were not aunswered in suche a weightie matter.
And yet when all is done, as it is nothing to the present purpose, so is it to no effect in any other matter at all.
The one, that the Homelie wrongfully named Theodorus Lascaris, for Michaell Paleologus.
The other, for a decree of Ualence and agaynst Images.
For the former, what Authours the Authour of that Homilie followed, knowe not, howe be it he nameth not Theodorus Lascaris, as you say, master Stapleton, but onely Theodorus, neyther this missing of the Emperours name (to him that woulde haue regarded the matter conteyned in the Homelie) mighte bee thought worthie so great an outcrye, excepte it were to you master Stapleton, that still vse to stumble at a sirawe and leape ouer a blocke, lyke to the Phareseys, that Excolantes culicem Camelum glutiebant, VVere stiffled with a gatte, and yet swallowed a Camell.
Neyther was this so great an ouersight, sythe Theodorus and Michaell were both of one tyme.
The one expelled the other, and both still reteyned the name of Emperour.
For as Uolaterane sayeth, Michaeligitur Paleologus. &c. Michaell Paleologus therefore at the same tyme inuaded the Empyre, whiche two moste noble houses of Constantinople, that is to saye, the house of the Lascarie, and the house of the Paleologie, the one decayed, the other lyfte vppe hir heade.
Theodorus Lascaris being thus expelled from the Citie of Constantinople, yet raigned he still at Adrianople as the Emperour of Gréece.
And it is not vnlikely, the occasion of his exile to haue bene about Images, so well as other matters.
Syth the Gréeke and Latine Church haue stryued aboute the controuersie of Images nothing more, and none so hotte.
For which matter chiefely, the Pope rebelled from his alleageance, and raysed all the diuision of the Empire in the Church of Christ, that hath bene the chiefe decay and ruine thereof, which onely sprang of the question of Images.
And yet sayth master Stapleton, giuing vs no other warrantiss thereof, than this his bare worde for Images: VVhich had customably continued in the Greeke Church many hundreth yeares before, and so reuerently afterwardes continued, euen till Constantinople was taken by the great Turke, and yet this good Antiquarie and Chronographer, will needes haue the Grcians aboue seuen hundreth yeares togyther, to haue beene Iconomachees, that is, Image breakers.
Are ye not ashamed, master Stapleton, to speake suche vntruthes euen where your selfe chalenge other of lyes? For, the authour of the Homelies noteth not here, nor herevpon, the dealing against Images all that space, nor nameth any Iconomachees nor medleth any thing there with those.
yeares that customably continued till Constantinople was taken by the Turke.
But onely of those yeares that customably continued from the primitiue Church, till the time of the Empresse Irene.
These things were done in the Church about the yeare of our Lorde
Note here pray you in this processe of the storie, that in the Churches of Asia and Grece, there were no Images publikely, by the space of.
yeares, and there is no doubt but the primitiue Churche next the Apostles tymes was most pure.
Now where the words and meaning of the Homilie are most plaine, and so true withal, that ye could not gainsay it, nor your Maister D. Harding coulde improue any point of B. Iewels chalenge, about the same article: ye wittingly wrest the wordes of the Homilie to the.
yeares preceding the taking of Constantinople by the great Turke, chalenging the Homilie to alleage the Gretians to haue bene Iconomaches all that while, thinking to fasten as ye call it a notorious lie on the Homilie.
But the Homilies truth is manifest, and the lye lighteth on your selfe, besides your rashnes to affirme without the booke on your owne fingers, that for many hundreth yeres before, Images customably continued in the Greke Church? and so reuerently afterwardes continued euen till Constantinople was taken by the great Turke.
For the which, though it would go harde with you to put you to your profe, and to let it hang in suspence of a lye till ye haus confirmed it: yet letting it passe, onely demaunde, that if your Images haue such great force as your Legendes pretende, howe chaunce they kept the Citie and their worshippers no better from the Turkes? can they do no morethan the dumbe Idols that the Prophet speaketh of? Habent gladium securim in manu se autem de bello latroibus non liberant, they haue a sword and an axe in their hand, but they deliuer not themselues from warre and from theues.
Or rather (if it be as ye say) were the Grecians not deliuered ouer to those enimies, as for their other vices, so chiefly for that their Idolatrie, as the children of Israell for the like were ledde captiue into Babylon? The other thing that Maister Stapleton noteth in the Homelie is this.
Many other shamefull lies are there (saith he) to disgrace, deface, and destroy the Images of Christ his Saintes, especially one, wheras he sayth that the Emperor Valence and Theodosius made a proclamation, that no man shoulde paint or carue the crosse of Christ.
VVheras the Proclamation neither is, nor was, to restrayne all vse of the crosse, but that it should not be painted or carued vpon the grou~d.
VVhich these good Emperours, not Valens (for he was the valiant captaine and defendr of the Arians) but Valentinianus and Theodosius, did of great godly reucre~ce that they had to the crosse, enact.
And yet as grosse, as soul, as loud a lying fetch as this is, M. Iewell walketh euen in the verye same steppes, putting Valens for Valentinian: and alleaging this edict, as general against al Images of the crosse.
You take vpon you lustily M. Stapl. to chalenge in your brode language both the Homilie, the B. of Sarum· But it is your maner, there is no shift, ye must be borne withall, chiefly in this your extrauagant by quarrel.
Otherwise if ye had co~sidered more indifferently ye homilies the B. allegatio~, no doubt you would haue tempered your pen with more sobrietie, ye chalenge either of them for two lies in this allegation, the one, for putting the name of Valens for Valentinian, the other for citing that simply that was conditionall.
which though it were as ye pretend, yet neither of these the B. or the Homilies author, are to be charged wt any lie herin: who haue both faithfully set downe their author Petrus Crinitus, (except ye will dally also about the Printers escape, that for Crinitus put Erinilus, placing E. for C. and l. for t.) and quoted the place, and cited his wordes.
Which to your better contentation, least ye shoulde saye any thing is not fullye satisfied, will set downe the whole ad verbum.
But it pleaseth mee to declare the woordes out of the Imperiall bookes, whereby the whole maye bee knowen, for bicause both Valens and Theodosius Emperours, did wryte on this wyse vnto their Gouernour the Pretour, Sith that we haue a diligent care in all thinges, concerning the religion of the high Godheade, wee will suffer no bodye to carue, or ingraue, or paint, the signe of our Sauiour Christ eyther in colours, stone, or other matter, but whatsoeuer signe is founde, wee commaunde it to bee taken awaye, punishing them with most grieuous punishment, whosoeuer shall attempt the contrary to our decrees and commaundement.
In the which saying, if perhappes any man require an authour, let hym reade the Decrees and Edictes of the Emperors, which of the most learned men Tribunianus, Bassilides, Theophilus, Dioscorus, and other, are collected by Satira in the reigne of this most noble Emperour Iustinian.
Thus ye sée Crinitus worde (whome onely and truly they alledge) howe simply he citeth it, and also in Ualens name.
If ye be so heinously offended at the matter, go and picke your quarrell against Crinitus, from whome they haue it, chalenge him, not them therefore.
warrant you Crinitus being a Papist, had it bene otherwise, woulde not haue set it downe so simplye agaynst you: and being so famous a Lawyer among you, referring the Reader to the Edict it selfe, woulde not sette it downe otherwise than he had simply reade it, howsoeuer your later false· Iuggling (as is more likelye of the twayne) hath thrust in suche condicionalles, of the grounde, to make it séeme done of more Idolatrie, and not to take awaye all occasion of Idolatrie.
But howsoeuer it were, both the Bishoppe and the Homilie bring their warrantise with them, to cleare them of making any lyes therein, and euer the lyes doe light vppon your selfe.
As for that ye snatch occasion hereon, to digresse further into one of your inuectiue common places, against the Booke of Homilies, and commends vnto vs your Homilies of Bede and others: neyther is this a proper time and place of the triall of ours nowe, neyther it appeareth yee can finde anye point of false doctrine in them.
Which no doubt you woulde not haue spared to haue noted, that woulde quarrell at suche petit matters as ye doe: neither doe vtterlyd discemmende the Homilies of the venerable Bede, although otherwise he smatcth of many corruptions of his corupted time.
But whatsoeuer his or others were, that ye boast of so haue bene redde in the Church by you, what praye you was the Church the better by the reading of that, whereof they had no vnderstanding, what was reade? as they haue in the Homilies now set forth vnto them.
But it is more than hie tune M. Stapleton, that for shame at the length ye remember your selfe, your matter, your aduersarie, and your Reader.
And not thus to run at randon, and wander for the nonce in mistes, hauing promised to dissiptae and discusse the myst that M. Horne hath cast before the Readers eyes.
Here is hitherto no myst at all of the Bishop.
At least wise ye haue myst it, and not discussed it, or medled any thing at all with the Bishops sayings to or fro.
Go to therefore M. St. haue the B. reised any mist, let vs see howe your counterblast will blow away and dissipate the same.
Yes say you, M. Horne calleth ignorantly Emanuell, him who~ he should call Andronicus.
And here, to shew your cunning, ye enter into those Emperors pedegrées.
Why M. St. is this so sore a myst to haue mist the Emperors name? were all these circu~quaques for this matter, to haue foyled the B. for mistaking a name by ignoraunce? which were it so as ye would haue it, what preiudice is here done to the matter? for what soeuer this Emperors name was, whom Nicephorus doth commende, it greatly forth not, but the matter forceth.
The author setteth forth in this Emperor, such vertues, that as Langus noteth, ought to be in euery good Christian Emperor.
What mist was therfore in the matter cast before the readers eyes, if by ignora~ce he had misnamed y^ man? Neither could you (if enuy against the B. and pride of your selfe pricked you not) vpbraide this mistaking of the name to the Bishop, for vnclerkly or vnfaythfull handling as ye do: except ye will do the like to the most, and most famous Hystoriographers, that haue written therevpon.
For the same authour Uolaterane (whom ye quote) being a Papist, and imputing all their decay to their often for saking of the Pope, sayth of the Hystoriers of these Emperors, that almost all the writers do err in the most part of things, take Caloiohannes for Andronicus the yonger, and so confounde all things, reckoning vp.
famous Gréeke wryters, that do all disagrée among themselues in the Treatise of the Emperours.
No marueyle then if the Bishop might mistake the name of one, without any hys rebuke of vnclerklinesse and ignorance, least of all, of ani vnfaythfulnesse, or casting of mistes for the matter to the eies of any indifferent Reader, except to the eyes bleared wyth malice, of suche a counterblasting Momus, as is master Stapleton.
Neuerthelesse to his further satisfying and contentation (if any thing may content him) he might well haue séene the Bishop discharged, and to haue followed good reason and authoritie, in alleaging this Emperour by the name of Emanuell Paleologus, and not Andronicus Paleologus, had master Stapleton, eyther beene so cunning as he maketh himselfe, or would haue delt iustly, to haue accused them of mistes, vnclerklinesse, ignorance, vnfaythfulnesse, (being famous wryters of his owne side) that haue so named him, and so set it cut in print, and that not by a scape, but of purpose, in setting out of the storie, and are allowed and authorised.
Whose iudgement the Bishop following, the blame (if any blame be) lighteth on them, and not on him.
For as the Bishop nameth him Emamuell, so also doth the volume of Nicephorus printed at Basill by Io. Oporinus, and Heruagius, Anno domini Mense Martio, which print is set forth (least you should reiect it) Cum priulegio Rom. vegù Ferdinandi Fracrum regis Hemi.
perused likewise and approued by the Doctors of the faculties of Sorbon and of Louaine, translated and set forth by Io. Langus, and commended as a worthie worke to the Emperour Ferdenande by his honourable, learned, faythfull and beloued Counceller and Hystoriographer· Wolfangus Lazius, if all this will be able to content you.
Io. Langus, in his Preface Dedicatorie to Ferdinandus hath these wordes.
purpose not here to rehearse otherwyse of your Maiestyes vertues, both for that haue to small habilitie for so great a woorke, and better it were not to speake at all of a matter of weight, than not to bee able to prosecute it, as the worthinesse of it requireth.
And also for that Nicephorus in hys Preface, when hee consecrateth the trauayle of thys Hystorie to Emanuell Paleologus the Emperoure of Constantinople, (for so beeing mooued by coniectures take him to bee) he liuely expresseth as it were in a Glasse, the moste of those selfe same vertues.
Besides this, where Nicephorus in the beginning of his Preface Dedicatorie, doth call the Emperour to whome he dedicateth his woorke, Pricipem omnium Christianissimum at{que} humanissimum, moste Christian and moste curteous Prince: Herevppon Iohn Langus maketh his first marginall note, Uidetur is esse Emanuel Paleologus: This Prince seemeth to bee Emanuell Paleologus.
And after that in the same Preface, he addeth another note thereof, Emanuels nato praedones Turcae Constantinopoli eiecti sunt: VVhen Emanuell was borne the Turkishe spoylers were driuen out of Constantinople.
And againe, Imperatoris Emanuelis infanti: The infancie of Emanuell the Emperour.
Successor eius in Imperio Constantinopolitan Emanuel filius: His successour in the Empire of Constantinople was Emanuell his sonne.
Diuini numinis erga Emanuelem gratia fauor: The grace and fauour of the diuine Godheade towardes Emanuell.
Tribuntur Emanueli praecipue Imperatoriae virtutes: The chiefe vertues of an Emperour are ascribed to Emanuell.
Eam videlicet Constantinopolim per Emanuelem Christiani retinuerunt: The Christians helde it (that is to say Constantinople) by Emanuell.
Dedicatur Ecclesiastica hystoria Imperatori Emanueli, veluti corona capiti cius imponitur.
The Ecclesiasticall hystorie is dedicated to the Emperour Emanuell, and is set on his head as it were a crowne.
Nowe master Stapleton might not all these notes vpon the Preface made by Langus a learned Papist, moue the Bishoppe to name the Emperour, Emanuell Paleologus, and cleare the Bishoppe of vnfaythfull dealing and raysing of mystes? And if he were deceyued, he was deceyued, for that he gaue to muche credite to suche famous Papistes, as Lazius and Langus, the Doctours of the faculties of Sorbone and of Louayne, that take vppon them Censoriam potestatem, To haue the authoritie of Censors, in allowing and approouing the moste of all youre Bookes.
If therefore ye blame the Bishoppe for this, (except ye will shewe your selfe ouer partiall) ye must needes condemne all these for the same.
Nowe master Stapleton hauing (as he thinketh) about this name, gotten a great triumphe, pretending to driue awaye the myste, and cleare the coastes, doing nothing him selfe but trampling in the duste, and raysing vaine smokes aboute bare names, letting the matter alone vnaunswered, the more to dimme the Readers eyes: telleth vs howe this Andronicus the elder, sonne to Michaell, after hys fathers death, summoned a Councell of the Gretians, wherein hee and they anulled and reuoked that hys Father had done at the Councell at Lions, namelye concerning the proceeding of the holy Ghoste, and for the whiche Nicephorus Maister Hornes Authour, beeing also carryed awaye wyth the common errour, as with an huge raging tempest, dothe so highly aduaunce this Andronicus.
And so withall ye see vppon howe good a man, and vpon howe good a cause, master Horne hath buylded his newe supremacie to plucke downe the Popes olde supremacie.
For the infringing whereof, the wicked working of wretched Heretikes is with him, here and else where, as we shall in place conuenient shew, a goodly and a godly President, as it is also with maister lewell for to mainteyne the verye same quarrell, as haue at large in my returne agaynst hys fourth article declared.
What yée haue there declared at large or at briefe, (Master Stapleton) is not our matter, nor haue it to sée, and recke not to looke, for déeme it by this: If iudge amisse, GOD forgiue me.
Onely herein all the worlde maye sée, what a iollie bragger ye bée.
Ye are euer telling vs of youre Forresle, youre Translations, your Replies, your turnes and returnes, besydes thys your Counterblast, nothing muste bée forgotten of all your clerkly Pamphletes.
If yée wante good neighbours, ye will not spare to commende them to vs your selfe.
As for mée, will for this once, returne your returne emptie to your selfe, and aunswere onelye your presente quarrels.
The effecte whereof is to deface the Bishops allegation, as grounded vppon the doyngs of an Heretike, and auouched oute of the sayings of an erronious authour.
And to this purpose, first ye threape vpon the Reader: the Prince to haue beene Andromens the elder, and not Emanuell.
And yet for all ye woulde make it so cleare a case: ye sée the Doctours doubt (as they say) and all your owne Doctours, and that the chiefe in iudgement.
Secondly, ye woulde make the facte and doings that are commended by Nicephorus in this Emperour, to be about the anulling and reuoking of that Michaell had done at the Councell of Lions, namely concerning the procéeding of the holy ghost, wheras all your Doctors abouesaid, name it chiefly to be for expelling of the Turkes, and preseruing of the Christians in Constantinople, besides his other vertues.
For the which cause not onely Nicephorus so highlye commendeth him, but also Lazius, Langus, and all your foresayde Sorbonistes and Louanians.
And yet you (to make the Emparor and the matter odious) say, that it was the denying of the proceeding of the holy ghost, for ye which Niceph. doth so highly aduaunce this Andronicus.
Wherein as ye slaunder them both, so, thirdly, doe ye great wrong to Nicephorus, to slaunder him with so great an hereste, and saye that he was caried away with the common error, as with an huge raging tempest.
But doubt it will rather séene M. Stapleton, your selfe were caried awaye with so huge a raging tempest, eyther of the heate of some cholericke passion, or some melancholicke enuie, so cankered against the Bishop and the truth of his cause, that it maketh you freat and rage euen against Nicephorus also.
For and ye were not caried away in the huge raging tempest of such a sustian fume, a man might then be the bolder to pull you by the sléee, and gently demaunde if ye finde any thing in this Nicephorus, wherefore ye shoulde so sore chalenge him of this heresie, or wherefore he shoulde so highly commende this Emperour for this heresie: thinke ye woulde be better aduised, and mollifie this sharpe chalenge of heresie in Nicephorus.
Many superstitions and fabulous tales there be found, of manye thinges in Nicephorus, graunt, but for my owne part, finde not that any euer noted him of heresie in this point.
And thinke my opinion therein to be more true than yours, for proofe whereof, will be reported by such witnesses, as thinke you will not except against, euen by your Colledge of Dies in Louaine.
Who affirme in their censure vpon this authour, that, Pa solum religiosa com endat &c. Nicephorus co~mendeth only godly and religious things, Nicepho historia ecclesia yois mand &c. not only the ecclesiastical historie of faith and religion may be printed, but with much and publike profite of the Church.
This coulde not haue bene true, but an euident, false lie if that the author as you saye, had so highly aduaunced the Emperour for restoring and maintaining of that heresie.
Moreouer in the verie title of the boke priuileged by the Emperour Ferdinand, he is entituled with this Epithete, scriptor verè catholicus· a writer Catholike indeede: and so likewise by that name of a Catholike writer he is highly comme~ded to the Emperor Ferdinande, both by Lazius a catholike, and Langus a catholike, (as you accept the name of catholike who tra~slated him out of Greke into Latine, at the said Emperors commaundeme~t.
Who also in plain speach to the Emperor, affirmeth, Volumen Nicephori de vera syncera{que} pietate conscriptum esse, the volume of Nicephorus is writte~ eue~ of true sincere godlines.
But what néede we cite all these against you? when that herein ye co~troll your self in your fourth boke of this counterblast, for although ye there saye he is no Papist, nor a Latine, but a Grecian, infected also wt their schisme, yet notwithsta~ding ye grau~t he is in al other things catholike, thus ye mollifie ye matter with ye name of scisme, dally with Nicephor there, which is yet somewhat gentler than to make him an heretike, an high aduancer of heresies, as here ye do.
And there yée promised to stande to his arbitrement about you Popes praises, why then so storme ye at him here, for his iudgement in the Princes praises? But still sée we must beare with you, so must al your doctors, especially sith ye be here caried awaye in so huge a raging tempest of your furie against the allegations of Nicephorus here cited by ye B.
And good cause ye had to kick and winch thereat, for they rub ye a litle on the gall, and therefore you not onely slaunder Nicephorus being the author, but fourthly also, and wherevpon you chiefly stande, most ye reuile the Emperour, calling his doinges, wicked working, and his person a wretched heretike, whom, notwithstanding this your railing, not onely Nicephorus commendeth for a most godly Prince, but also La~gus in his owne preface, and his other notes to the Preface of Nicephorus, giuing him as great a praise: saying he was an Emperour flourishing in all vertues and many ornamentes.
Againe, An Emperour begotten by the verye prouidence of God.
Againe, Godlynesse and religion was from the beginning of his Empire his greatest care.
And that to him were giuen, the chiefest vertues of an Emperour· Againe, In this Emperour being absolute almost in all vertues and ornamentes, is portrayed apaterne of a most excellent Prince.
Againe, This was the Emperours chiefe prayse that he attayned all the whole vertues of the best auncient Princes.
And that the Emperours godlynesse and religion is commended chiefly among his other vertues.
Thus doth your catholike La~gus in his notes vpo~ Nicephor preface set him out, co~trary to that you say was a wicked worker and wretched heretike.
But wherto in ye end do you so reuile this emperor? forsoth euen to this end, by him not only to deface ye B. allegation, but also to dashe dawne the Princes supreme gouernment, as though it consisted altogither or chiefly herevpon.
For so you make your conclusion of this part, saying: And, thus withall ye see vpon how good ama~ vpon how good a cause, M. Horne buildeth his new supremacie to plucke downe the Popes old supremacie.
As for the newnesse of this supremacie, and likewise the oldnesse of your Popes supremacie, is nowe (M. Stapleton) no co~uenient place to discusse: it hath partly ben touched before, shal God willing be examined more herafter.
In the mean seaso~, good leaue haue ye to crake of old vpbraid new, at your pleasure, so long as you bring no new but old rotte~ proues therof, though here ye alledge neither new nor old at al, you wil neuer perceiue leaue your old fashio~s, ye threap on ye B. yt he buildeth this supremacy on this emperor.
No M. St. the B. buildeth on no such grou~ds, but on ye word of God.
It is you yt build the Popes supremacie on me~s donatio~s, the most of your Popish doctrines traditio~s of me~s inue~tio~s.
The grounde of the Bishops argument, as ye haue hearde, was out of Gods worde, that the Prince is Gods minister: only he shewed it out of S. Augustine and Chrysostome, and exemplified it by the example of Constantine, wherein this ministerie doth chiefly consist.
With whome sith Nicephorus doth so agrée in the description of a Princes chiefe ministerie: were Nicephorus otherwise an heretike, or were he not, in this he sheweth himselfe none: and were it Andronicus or Emanuell: and were he an hereticke in that point, or were he sounde: the Bishop medleth not withall, nor groundeth or buildeth vpon him.
Onely he setteth forth Nicephor{us} iudgeme~t, either what this Prince was, or what he ought to be.
And proueth ye the things which he comme~deth him for, (whether he deserued such commendation or no, let other examine) are the principall pointes of a Princes chiefe ministerie.
And what hath the B. done here, that your Catholike Langus doth not? commending this Emperor to Ferdinandus, likening Ferdinandus vnto him, saying of him, that either he was, Sicut um. &c.
Such another as our historier depainteth him out in his ornaments, in the moste part of all vertue to bee worshipped, most like your Maiestie: or else in the person of him, declaring that he ought to be such an one as he described (which is the maner of some Philosophers, and also of Historiographers, composing orations and bookes of great Princes) he hath confirmed so many and so great ornamentes of your Maiestie, foreseeing as it were euen then in his minde, that his worke hereafter being turned into Latine, shoulde at length be published vnder that Princes name, whom he in Greke had most truly adorned with his prayse.
If it were lawful thus for your Langus to apply these Emperors prayses to the Emperor Ferdinand, may not the Bishop apply them in general, as a paterne of all good Princes duties? and therfore, where ye scoffe at this, calling it in scorne a goodly and godly president: setting your mokes aside, maye well aunswere with Langus, whatsoeuer the Emperours iudgement, or the Emperours life were, or the author also of these commendations: these vertues so highly co~mended, are both a goodly and godly president, for all Princes to set before them.
Thus much therefore to the former winde of your counterblast.
Now to the later, which after all these long discourses, draweth somewhat néerer to the matter, in admitting the authour Nicephorus his testimonies, and the Emperours doings, and answering to the Bishops allegations thereon.
The effect whereof, is to improue all that is alleaged, as insufficient to inferre this supremacie.
Firste, prsupposing this Prince to be Andronicus, all doing about to be the reuoking of Michels yelding to the Pope at the Councell at Lions: he to proue, that, not but the Priestes (though wicked) had the chiefe uperioritie.
Secondly, he against the gathering and sorting of the Bishops
And fourthly here vpon, he maketh his triumph and thanks for the victorie.
But now M. Horne what if these hereticall doyngs do nothing releeue your cause, nor necessarily induce the chiefe superioritie in all causes, and perchaunce in no cause Ecclesiasticall, concerning the finall discussing and determination of the same? verily without any perchaunce, it is most plainly and certainely true, it doth not.
For euen in this Schismaticall councell, and hereticall fynagog, the Bishops played the chiefe parte, and they gaue the finall though a wrong and a wicked iudgement VVho also shewed their superioritie, though vngodly vppon this mans Father, in that they would not suffer him to be enterred Princelike: them selues much more worthy to haue bene cast after their decease, to the Dogges and Rauens, vppon durtie doonghill.
What those Priests were worthie, we haue your worthie iudgement M. Stapleton, whereby we perceiue your Priests can erre, although they be Massemongers, and by your former sayings, Reuerent worshippers of Images too.
But all will not helpe, they are adiudged to be cast on a drtje doonghill, to be deuoured of Dogges and Raues, bicause they would not suffer· Michael Paleologus their Emperour (who notwithstanding intruded him selfe by violence) to be enterred Prince like.
What then are those Priests much more worthy that would not suffer their liuing Princes to vse their princely authoritie? what are those Popes more worthie· that haue not onely not suffred their predecessours, to be enorted Pope like, but haue pulled them out of the ground againe, and hacked and mangled them? What are those prelates worthie that haue caused the Priestes and the people to renounce their obedience to their sworne Princes? thinke ye will not say these should be· call out on durtie doonghils: and yet their faulte is as much as the other: it is to be feared least they shalbe cast out into vtter darkenesse· But ye do a little to much charge the Gréeke Priestes, with the whole burden of this crime.
It was not onely they as Uolaterane saith, but it was the whole nation, as Baptist Egnatius writeth, as is also noted in Laugus his margine, Ex qua tuntam nuidiam· &c. VVherevppon he gotte so great enuie of the Greeke notion, that neither they performed the obsequies of the dead, also denied him the place of his Sepulchre.
But you applie it onely vnto the Priestes, that their superioritie might the more appeare.
For which purpose you direct all your tale, to sette foorth their superioritie, euen in such as ye call wicked and hereticall doings: whereas the Princes claime is not for any such superioritie in wicked doings, but onely in Godly and Christian causes.
Ye driue all the matter to of the holy Ghosts proceeding, and to Andronicus cealing therein, against the dealing of his Father.
In thus do the last editions of Nicephorus, Printed at Paris,
(whether truely or no, is doubtfull to say) referre al to Andronicus, and euer in the place of Emael, put Andronicus: and for driing away of the Turkes, put in the anulling of the doings at Lions Councell.
Which sentence soeuer be the truer, either the former which the Bishop followed, or the later which you follow: yet ca~ you not go so round away with the matter, but that euen Michael which yéelded to the Pope, mangre all his Priestes, and made them perforce while he liued to acknowledge the Pope, shewed therein a superioritie uer them, which thinke ye will not call a tirany, gaue it ouer to the Pope.
And his sonne in doing the contrarie (euen in the Councell ye mention) sheweth also a supreme dealing therein.
And that supreme dealing that you most stiffly denie to Princes, to wte, the calling of Councels, the Patriarch did it not, but the Prince, as your selfe ha confessed before, that he after his Fathers death, sumoned a Councell of the Grecians.
And so sayeth Langus in the Margine of the Preface.
Imperatori istius ductu, &c. By the guydance of this Emperour in the Councell, the Easterne Bishops contrarie to the Westerne, decreed, that the holy Ghost proceeded onely from the Father.
But not long after by his Nephewe Iohn Paleologus being Emperour, in the Synode at Florence holden in the yeere of the Lorde,
the Grecians accorded to the determination of the Latines, in so much that they professed the holy Ghost to proceede from the Father and the Sonne, when they were perswaded, that the Latines beleeued God the Father to be the onely cause of the Sonne, and of the holy Ghost, and that they accursed the being of twoo beginnings, or two causes in the consubstantiall Trinitie.
Which sentnce, as it sheweth the to be called by the so it sheweth the cause of the Gréekes diision the in this aboute which, here and in your make so much a do, to haue bene rather of misunderstanding the one of the other, than any such as ye here often charge them, aunder Niphorus, reite this Prince, and afterwardes vs also.
And withall it sheweth, that this controursie was not so much tho matter betweene them, as was the reenting vnto the Popes obedience, which the Greeke Church could neuer abide, and to say the sooth, they of all other had chiefe cause· for the Pope was the chiefe ruine their Empir.
In this Councell, the Prince hath this point of supremace, that he sumoned and guided it· which M· Stapleton espying, dareth not fully affirme· that thi doing maketh atly againste the Princes supremacie, but he cometh fintly in, with, what, do you
And what if shalt we haue larkes· what id· phie on Deuill with his shifting if thou be the of God.
And what if it do not necessarily enduce the chiefe supe in all causes? And what if it did not necessarily, if it did it, what is here the necessitie to or fro the matter? and what if it did some necessarili though not all? Yet ye see here is somwhat gotten to helpe the matter for warde.
Ye graunt this doing argueth a supremacie in some Ecclesiacall causes although not necessarilie.
But stpping backe againe, ye· say: And in no Eccsiasticall concerning the discussing and determincion of the same.
Well, and what if this also were graunted you, that concerning the finall discussing and determination, he had supremacie in no cause ecclesiasticall, yet might it followe that in all other poynts (except the finall discussing and determination he had the supremacie.
Verily (say you, waxing somewhat bolder) without any perchance it is most playnly and certaynly true, it dothe not.
For (say you) euen in this schmaticall councell and hereticall synagoge the Byshops played the chiefe part· and they gaue the finall, thoughé a wrong and wicked iudgement.
And verily then (without any perchaunce either your selfe do make a foule lye, or else bothe in calling the Councell, and giuing the finall sentence also, the Prince had the superioritie.
lynes before, ye granted, that he othe summoned the Councell, and also that he and they anulled and reuoked that hys father had done at the Councell at Lions.
Lo heere, in the annulling and reuoking, which was the finall discussing and determination· ye bothe ioyne hi with them, and place him before them.
And thu vnawares, whyle ye speake agaynst the truthe, ye wotte not what, or care not howe ye wrappe your selfe in contradictions, and make your selfe a lyer.
Your seconde parcell is onely agaynst the order of the sentences collected by the Byshop, asking him what honor he hath got for al his cratie cooping or cunning· and smoth oyning, combining, and incorporating a number of Nicephorus sentences togither For all these wordes you vse to outscoffe the mater, and quarell at the placing of them vnorderly.
But all this whyle ye answere not one worde to any one worde in them, and yet set you downe your marginall note with a solemne outrie.
what a craftie Cooper and smothe Ioyner is master Horne.
But sée how handsomely it falleth out, and how orderly, euen where ye talke of order· For where ye haue set downe this your marginall exclamation, at the comming to his second parte, saying: what honor haue ye go: for all your craftie cooping, &c. Ye set it downe for haste in the matter before answered, concerning the schismaticall Councel, and the bishops dealing therin, doing as the story telleth of Doctor Shawe in his sermon of the prayse of king Richarde the thirde, that or euer the king was come to the sermon, had already sayde his parte, that he should haue sayde at his comming, and so with shame inough, out of place, and out of time, repeated the same.
But you may say, thankes be to God, inke and paper can not blushe, and although thinke you can do as little your self, yet a Gods name, let it passe, be it but the Printers misplacing of the note, although it fell out ill fauordly, to light euen there, where ye reprehende the Byshop for ill ioyning togither of his sente~ces, and your booke ioyneth your marginal notes, all besides your matter.
Now hauing thus stoode trifling in reprehending the order of the bishops collection of Nicephorus sentences, bicause he setteth them downe togither, béeing not so set togither, but here there dispersed, in the great long Preface of Nicephorus: where the Reader now at the length should looke that M. Stap. should come to answere some poynt materiall of all the bishops allegations: as though he had fully answered them all (hauing sayde not so much as Buffe vnto any one sentence alleaged) he repeateth his former vaunt full lustily, saying: What honor haue you, say, wonne by this or by the whole thing it self? little or nothing, furthering your cause, and yet otherwise playne schismaticall, and hereticall.
For the which your handsome and holy dealing, the author of the foresaide Homilie, and you, yea M. Iewell too, are worthy exceeding thanks.
Is not héere a proper answere, thus to iest out the matter with scoffes, crakes raylings? Surely, M. St. what honor soeuer the bishop hath wonne by this, or not wonne (as he looketh for none at your ha~ds, your tha~ks ye may reserue for your friends) you win much shame to your selfe your cause, thus shamefully to umble vp the matter, all onely with out facing it.
Ye say the B. hath patched vp a number of Nicephorus sentences togither.
Why do ye not ip a sunder those patches' If he hath vsed craftie cooping cunning, smoothe ioyning, combining, and incorporating, it were your part to vnhoope the~, to dissolue the~, to answere them.
Tush say you, what néede that? they are al little or nothing furthering your cause.
Now, M. Sta? thinke then they might be the easelier answered, not so to skip ouer them like whip Sir Iohn at his morrow Masie.
But til you answere something to the~, an vpright iudge will déeme them much to further our cause.
Although it is somewhat that ye grau~t, yt yet a litle they further our cause: think by that ye reader hath wayed the~ better, he shal sée they so hinder your cause, that ye thought it the best way to let them all alone.
And that the Reader may the better beholde bothe your dealing, and the Byshops allegations, so iudge how much or howe little they further the matter, and whether they might haue bene thought worthy the answering: as the Byshoppe hathe gathered them, so will set them downe.
Who hath glorified God more, and shewed more feruent zeale (sayth Nicephorus to the Emperour towardes him in pure religion, without fayning, than thou hast done? Who hath with suche feruent zeale sought after the most sincere fayth muche indaungered, or clensed agayne the holy table? When thou sawest our true religion brought into perill with newe deuises, brought in by counterfeite and naughtie doctrines, thou diddest defende it moste paynefully and wisely, thou diddest shewe thy selfe, to be the mightie, supreme, and very holy anchor and staye in so horrible wauering and errour, in matters beginning to faynte, and to perishe as it were with shipwracke.
Thou arte the guyde of the profession of our fayth.
Thou haste restored the Catholike and vniuersall Church (beeing troubled with new matters or opinions) to the olde state.
Thou hast banished from the Church all vnlawfull and impure doctrine.
Thou hast clensed agayne with the worde of truthe, the Temple, from choppers and chaungers of the diuine doctrine, and from hereticall deprauers thereof.
Thou haste bene set on fyre with a godly zeale for the diuine Table.
That which was pulled downe, thou haste made vp agayne, and haste made the same whole and sounde agayne, with a conuenient knitting togither of all the partes and members.
(To be shorte, thou haste, saythe Nicephorus to the Emperour) established true religion and godlynesse with spirituall butresses, namely the doctrine and rules of the auncient fathers.
These are the Bishops allegations out of Nicephorus, for this Princes dealing in ecclesiastical matters.
Wherin are comprehended (as eche man may sée) all the chiefe ecclesiasticall causes.
The true religion, the sincere fayth, the diuine doctrine, godlynesse, making constitutions, the fathers rules, the catholike vniuersal church.
Neither ascribeth he to the Prince herein, a power Lega~tine fro~ Priest, Byshop, Patriarke, or Pope: muche lesse to be their onely executioner: but vnder God he giueth him a supreme gouernement, in calling him, not onely the defender, but the mightie, supreme, and very holy anchor and stay, the guyde, the restorer, the clenser, the establisher, the entrencher and maker vp of all these things.
On the contrarie: the puller downe, and banisher of newe deuises, counterfeit, naughtie, vnlawfull, and impure doctrines, of horrible errors, and heretical deprauers.
And this, his chief dealing herein, to be most seemely for him, and chiefly belonging to his princely office.
Dothe all this M. Stap. little or nothing further our cause? if it doe not, then it lyttle or nothing hindreth yours.
Why graunte ye not then vnto it? if ye graunte but thus muche, we wil vrge you little or nothing further: for what is not héere conteined, that is either conteined in the issue betwéene the Bishop and M. Feck: or in the othe of the O. Maiesties supremacie, that ye refuse to take? But as light as would séeme to make of this, it pincheth you, and ye dare not grau~t, nor answere any sentence therof.
Onely ye giue a snatche at a worde, and bayte at the bishops marginal note vpo~ these former allegatio~s.
Wherin ye play like Alciates dogge, at whom when one hurled a stone, he let go him fro~ whom the stone came, wreaked his anger on the stone.
So set you vpon the marginall note, that in déede hitteth you a good souse, but the allegations from whe~ce the marginal note doth come, ye let alone, and fal to tugging of the note.
Only (as saide) ye snatche at a word, as though all the weight of the marginall note were setched only from thence, and not from all these sentences, But (say you) M. Home will not so leese his long allegation out of Nicephorus.
He hath placed a note in the margine, sufficient trow) to conclude his principall purpose.
But where findeth Horne the same in his text? for soothe of this, that Nicephorus calleth the Emperour, the mightie, supreme, and very holy anchor, and stay in so horrible wauering, &c. of the worde supreme anchor, he concludeth a supremacie.
Coulde that craftie Cooper of thys allegation, informe you no better, master Horne? was he no better seene in Grammer, or in the profession of a schole master, than thus foully and fondely to misse the true interpretation of the Latine worde? for what other is suprema anchora in good Englishe, than the laste anchor, the laste refuge, the extreme holde, and staye to rest vpon? As suprema verba, doe signifie the laste wordes of a man in hys laste wyll: as summa dies, the laste daye, supremum iudicium, the laste iudgement: with a number of lyke Phrases.
So suprema anchora is the laste anchor, signifying the laste holde and staye, as in the perill of tempeste the laste refuge is to caste anchor.
In suche a sense Nicephorus calleth this Emperour the laste, the mightie, and the holy anchor or stay in so horrible wauering and errour.
Signifying that nowe by him they were stayed from the storme of schisme, as from a storme in the sea, by casting the anchor, the shippe is stayed.
But by the metaphore of an anchor, to conclude a supremacie: is as wyse, as by the Metaphore of a Cowe to conclude a Saddle.
For as well dothe a saddle fitte a Cowe, as the qualitie of an anchor resemble a supremacie.
But by suche beggerly shiftes a barren cause muste be vpholded.
First all is saide by the way of amplification to extoll the Emperour: as in the same sentence he calleth him the sixt element, reaching aboue Aristotels fifte body, ouer the foure elementes with suche lyke: Then all is but a Metaphore: which were it true, proueth not nor concludeth, but expresseth and lightneth a truth.
Thirdly, the Metaphore is ill translated, and last of all, worsse applied.
sirra, M. St. héere is a whot sturre and highe wordes.
man would thinke all is nowe answered to the full, and yet when all co~mes to all, héere is nothing of all this a do, agaynst any one sentence of the Byshops allegations.
But the poore marginall note, and one poore séelie worde, of all these long allegations, shall abye for this geare.
First ye say M. Stapl. that M. Horne will not so leese his long allegation out of Nicephorus.
But it appeareth, he may lee or finde them all, for any thing ye wil answere to them.
Ye slinke for the nonce to the marginall note, which is this: The Princes supremacie in repayring religion decayed.
This is in deede (say you) a ioly marginal note, but where findeth M. Horne the same in his texte? forsoothe of this, that Nicephorus calleth the Emperour the mightie, supreme and very holy anchor and stay, in so horrible wauering of the worde supreme anchor, he concludeth a supremacie.
Is there nothing, M. Stap. in all these allegations, that ye coulde sée, wherfore the Bishop set downe his marginal note, of the Princes supremacie in repayring religion decayed, but onely this sentence? yea onely that worde? do not all the other sentences importe as muche as this? that he is the guyde of the profession of our fayth: the restorer of the catholike and vniuersall Church: the banisher from the Church of all vnlawful and impure doctrine: the clenser of the temple with the worde of truth, fro~ choppers and changers of the diuine doctrine, and from hereticall deprauers thereof.
That he is the entrencher of true religion, with mightie defences: That he is the establisher of the doctrine, and maker of constitutions for the same: that he is the maker vp agayne, the maker whole and sounde agayne of al that was pulled downe.
Might not all this to an indifferent reader, be thought sufficient, to answere the marginal note, and comprehende in all poyntes as muche as the note? yea though ye quite set aside the sentence and word wherat ye wrangle? And yet with M. Stap. this one sentence must beare the weight of all that the bishop alleaged, the mightie, supreme, and very holy anchor and stay in so horrible wauering.
But go to, let it do so, presuppose that the bishop alleaged no more but this one sentence: or that all the other little or nothing further the cause.
Yet dothe this onely sentence fully comprehende as muche as this marginall note conteneth.
(Yea set also aside the word supreme, that master St. quarell is at) that in so horrible wauering and errour, in matters beginning to faynte, and to perishe as it were with shipwracke, the Prince is the mightie and very holy anker, or stay, Sacris simul prophanis, both in holy and prophane matters.
Doth not this mightie stay, onely or chiefly vnder God, of the Prince, for al kinde of persons, agaynst errors, playnely argue a soueraigne helping power, or supremacie in repayring of religion beeing decayed? But M. Stapl. letting goe all this, girdeth onely at this worde supreme, bicause the byshop translated suprema anchora not the laste anchor, but supreme anchor.
Héere first he falleth out with a Cooper, can not tell whome for missinforming the byshop.
As though the interpretatio~ of supremus were so high a poynte, that the byshop muste be taught of some· Grammarian or scholemaster, the English therof.
And bicause it is not englished in good Englishe, full scholemaster like, he taketh vpon him to expounde the same.
For, what other is (sayth he) suprema anchora, in good English, than the laste anchor, the laste refuge, the extreme holde and stay to rest vpon.
Be it euen as you would haue it, M. Stap.
And thankes be to God, that when you haue nothing to say agaynst the bishops allegation: this is your last anchor, your last refuge and extreme stay to rest vpon, to finde faulte with the byshops englishe, for not good english.
Though héere neither you can proue any false englishing (which is common with you) and when you haue all done, supremus is bothe laste, and chiefe, and which way soeuer ye conster it, supremus is supreme, take it howe you list.
Although in the very proper deruation of the worde, supremus comming of supra, signifieth the chiefe or hyest.
And that it is called laste, is but accessorie and improperly spoken (for properly, vltimus is last, or extre by reason that the last things, as added, for the most part vppermost, and the last doings are commonly the chiefest.
But what neede contention here de laua caprina, of a matter of nothing? It were more fitte ye had reserued this your earnest answere, to some earnest matter.
But as they say, In refrigidissima feru, in fentissima friges.
In the coldest matters you be boyling hote, and in the hottest matters you be key colde.
To auoyde therfore contention, as ye ought not to controll the Bishops English, being not false: so am for my parte, content to admit your English, and thinke so will the Bishop to.
For (setting aside your quareling) it coth not hi, but all in the ende commeth to one effect.
You say it signifieth the last anchor, the last refuge, the extreme holde, and stay to rest vpon.
Uery well sayde M. St. is not that the chiefe, which we must flée vnto, holde, stay, and rest vpon, when all other helpes do fayl? And so ye graunt the Prince vnder God to be the chiefest refuge and stay, both to the lay and Clergie, in all wrings of doctrine, and err of Religion· Is not this now asmuch, as the Bishops note contained, the Princes supremacie in restoring Religion decayed? You exemplifi the matter thus.
As suprema verba, do signifie the last wordes of a man in his last will: as dies, the last day: supremum iudicium· the last iudgement· with a number of the like phrases· True in déede M. St. but ye should withall remember, uen in these examples, that the last will is the chiefest will, and al the other former willes giue place to the last will.
And the last day is the chiefest day, and by a speciall prerogatiue called Dies Doni, the day of the Lorde, and Dies magnus· the great day.
And the last iudgement, is the chiefest iudgement, when all iudges shall be iudged: and therefore God the father hath onely giuen it to Christ, bicase he is simply the chiefest of all.
And here in earth also he is the chiefest iudge, that is last appealed vnto.
Thus M. St. your owne phrases, fitte the Bishop well.
And as it doth in these, so in this present phrase, Suprema anchora, say you, Is the last anchor, signifying the last hold stay, as in the perill of te~pest, the last refuge is to cast anchor.
And is not this then also the chiefest refuge and stay? In such a sense (say you) Nicephorus calleth his Emperour the last, the mightie the holy anchor, or stay so in horrible wauering and errour, signifying that now by him they were stayed, from the storine of schisme, as from a storme in the sea, by casting the anchor, the shippe is stayed.
This is in dée M. St. the meaning of Nicephorus.
And do ye not sée what chiefe dealing it giueth aboue all other only to the Prince, in the storme of a schisme or errour, or other ecclesiasticall matter, wauering? is not the anchor in a storme the chiefest and most principall stay? doth any thing stay the ship more or better than an anchor? or is there any other ordinarie stay therof? Then, by your own expositio~, ye Prince is made here, the chiefe, the principal, the only stay in such cases, which fully co~cludeth all the matter, notwithsta~ding al your scoffes, therfore where ye co~clude, saying.
But by the metaphore of an anchor to conclude a supremacie, is as wise, as by the metaphore of a Cow, to conclude a Saddle.
For aswell doth a saddle fit a Cow, as the qualitie of an anchor resemble supremacie.
But by such beggerly shiftes a barren cause must be vpholded.
Ye haue sadled the Cow M. St. ha~dsomly, ye are the fittest ma~ that sée, to ride vpo~ hir, for this co~clusion sheweth you as wise a ma~, according to ye old saying, as euer spurred a Cow for admitting ye metaphore of an anchor, no further than your selfe haue sayed, that as by it the ship is stayed fro~ stormes in the seas, so by the Prince, all the people are stayed fro~ Schisme wauering errours, in religion: if the anchor be the chiefest stay next to Gods help in ye one, is not the Prince the chiefest stay next to Gods helpe in the other? although therfore, ye elie the B. to say he concluded only therevpon (for before ye sayde he concluded on the worde.
Suprema. which he did not neither, but on all the whole allegacions altogither) yet holdeth this conclusion, euen by your owne sayings better row, than you will holde on your sadled Cowes backe as fit a rider as ye be, except ye sit the faster, that the Cow cast not a calfe as bigge as M. St. As for the B. shifts what they are, what beggerly shifts they are, euery reader will soone iudge, yt seeth how you shift off the matter.
Ye answere nothing to any sente~ce of the B. allegatio~s: ye runne at randon to other lim flamtales: ye finde fault at other thours about other matters: ye picke quarrels about bare names: ye snatch at the marginal note, let go the matter: ye defa~t about the only word supremus, more like beggerly Pedantie, than a grammarlike scholemaster: all but to raise mistes cou~terblasts, pretending to dissipate discusse mistes, al but to cary the reader fro~ the flat round answering of the yet are al these no beggerly shifts of yours.
In déede M. St. these are no co~mon beggers shifts, these are shifts than al men vse, or tha~ euery ma~ ca~ see, they are belike borowed of ye beggerly friers of Louaine, but from whe~ce soeuer ye haue them, the cause is both beggerly barraine, that in stéede of good plaine answering, seketh such shifte of shiftes, but hold your peace the begger, it is a bad sacke that can abide no clouting.
with these shiftes: you gather them vp in a briefe recapitulacion, to excuse the matter.
First, all is sayd by the way of amplification to extoll, the Emperour (as in the same sentence he calleth him the sixt Element, reaching aboue Aristotels fifte bodie, ouer the foure Elements with such like.)
As though this amplifying of his estate, were any argument for you to depresse the same.
And sith (as him self protesteth) he meant no flatterie, this amplification, meaneth yet a truth of his excelle~cie, and supreme estate.
Otherwise, he could not well haue so called him, although he sayeth not altogither as you say, neither: for he micioeth not Aristotle at all, nor any his fift body, nor speaketh of the foure Elements, but he saith, Et vt ille ab vtra{que}, &c.
And that he receyuing from both of them (speaking of godlinesse and slicitie) that which was proper to them both, might make perfect, to all men a newe, and in very deede a maruelous co~moditie and helpe, to woe, a certaine stable firmament, and (as might call it) a sixt and an eternall Element, in diuine matters beginning to slyde perishing by shipwracke, offering thee the great, supreme, and in deede the holy Anchor, of so horrible a wauering, and errour, both in holy and in prophane matters.
That in thee they might represent a sownde stabilitie, to others also that are with thee.
This being the amplification of Nicephorus which is in déede a great amplification: it sheweth that he meant to co~mende him very highly for his supreme dealing in religion, not as M. St. would haue it, any thing to abase the same, which is quite contrarie to the authours meaning.
But then (saieth M. Stap.) all is but a metaphore, which were it true, proueth not nor concludeth, but exprefleth and lighteneth a truth: Thirdly, the metaphore is ill translated, and last of all, worse applied.
For the tra~slation (M. St.) it is answered before, thanks be to God ye can not proue it false.
And yet (not to co~tend) yours is admitted, and maketh against you too, ue~ by your owne tale.
But what hindreth this, that this worde anchor is but a metaphore? doth a metaphore being a true metaphore, proue nothing, but lighten a truth? doth not a true thing proue a truth, be it metaphore or what soeuer it be, be it true? as for a metaphore, doth it not proue the thing that it is resembled vnto? Christ is called bread, a vine, a stone, a Lion, a way, a dore, a sheperde: do not these metaphors proue and conclude in him, the reasons and proportions wherefore he is so called? do we not by these metaphors co~clude, that he is our norisher, our life, our stabilitie, our strength, our guide and defence, our onely meanes and entrance into heauen? The Emperour is called here the chief Anchor.
What the~? we go not about to proue him an Anchor.
But euen as your selfe expounde it we proue him by the metaphore of an Anchor, to be a stay: and so being the chiefe Anchor, it proueth and concludeth that he is the chiefe stay.
And this is ynough, that that it proueth thus much.
As for the Anchor take it to your selfe, and get an Asse to your Cowe, to carie it.
Neuertheles, if this were also remitted to you, that being a metaphore, it prooueth not, nor concludeth, but expresseth and lightneth a truth.
What this the matter? So the truth therby be expressed and lightned, although the Bishop thereby, concluded not his matter, but onely lightned and expressed the truth thereof.
Were not this ynoughe at least to stoppe your brabling and rayling agaynst him? Except ye be of Imbres and Membres disposition, that of purpose will resist the truth, and not expresse but suppresse, not lighten but obscure the same, as the Phariseys did, and you Papistes after them haue done, and labour still to do.
But ye cannot oppresse the truth for euer, yeaeuen your striuing agaynst it, shall the more (agaynst your willes) expresse and lighten the truth.
Last of all (say you) it is worse applied, but so long as ye shewe, neither howe, where, nor whie: a man might aunswere you, a shorte horse is soone curryed.
And when you applie your minde to aunswere more substantially, will take paynes to replie, and curie your answere more smoothly.
As for the rest of your Counterblast, it is but the blowing vp of the victorie before ye haue it.
It aunswereth nothing to the matter, but is a crake of your triumph, that ye wene ye haue gotten, much good do it you, master Stapleton.
Nowe whereas (say you) in the beginning of your matter, the substance of your proues hereafter standing in stories, yt haue demeaned your selfe so clerkly skilfully here, the reader may hereof haue a taste: and by the way of preuention and anticipation, haue also a certaine preiudiciall vnderstanding, what he shall looke for at your handes in the residue.
VVherefore God be thanked, that at the beginning hath so deciphered you, whereby we may so much the more, yea the boldlier without any feare of all your antiquitie herfater to be shewed, cheerefully proceede on.
Thou séest here a iolie triumph (gentle Reader) and doubt not, but thou séest what a great gaine he hath wonne.
Do but call for his cardes, warrant you, he will be ashamed to shew them.
But alas good man, giue him leaue, he must crake of somthing to comfort himselfe withall, and set a fayre viser, on an yll fauoured visage to outface the matter, when nothing else will helpe it.
But God be thanked, indéede, that hath thus deciphered his noughtie reckonings, and sophisticall summes, filled vp with bare Ciphers in Algorisme, that furnished a place in steade of an aunswere, and were in déede no aunswere, nor anie iust accompt, but as they say, he that reckens without his hoste, must recken twice.
But a Gods name (as master Stapleton cryeth) let vs cheerefully proceede on.
We are almost at an ende of this first booke of his.
AS the Bishop hitherto on the wordes of Saint Pauls Rom.
calling the Prince Gods minister, hath by the fathers Chrysostome and S. Augustine, and by these Ecclesiastical historiographers Eusebius Nicephorus, about these two Emperours, shewed sufficiently how farre this ministerie stretcheth, and wherein it chiefly consisteth: so concluding this for the other testimonie of S. Paule alleaged, he sheweth the endes and boundes of the Princes gouernment, not onely to stretch to the conseruation of ciuill peace outwarde tranquillity, but also to the maintenance and preseruing of Gods true religion.
To the confirmation of this sentence of the Apostle, he citeth Chrysost. co~cluding hereon, that these two parts and notes of a princes gouernme~t, are so knit togither, that ye one cannot be without the other, therfore both are necessary to be required in a prince.
And that thus, the auncient Christian Princes did consider of their duties, he citeth out of Cyrill, the testimonies of the Emperours, Theodosius and Ualentinian.
Master Stapletons aunswere to this chiefly standeth in thrée poyntes.
First, he querelleth with the Bishop, for calling these Emperors, Christian Emperours.
Secondly, he yeldeth to the Bishope allegation of Saint Paule and Chrysostome, as rather for him, than against him, thereto trauayleth in bringing forth ensamples.
Thirdely, to the testimonies of Ualentinian and Theodosius, he replyeth with other testimonies of the sayde Emperours.
All the first part is friuolous and to no effect, nor aunswering the argument of the Bishops conclusion, which is this.
All Christian princes notable and godly doings, that are necessarily belonging to their office, are paterns for other Princes to beholde and do their dutie to their subiects by.
But these and such like Princes, are by the ecclesiastical writers commended for their notable doings in the maintenance and furtherance of Christian religion, as doings necessarily perteyning to their office: Ergo, they are paterns, examples, and glasses for other Christian Princes to beholde, and to learne thereby to do their dutie to their subiects, in the maintenance and furtherance of Christian Religion.
To this master Stap. sayth neuer a worde, but falleth a rayling on the Bishop for calling this Emperour, Christian Emperour.
And first, in his sume he sweareth by God, that he he will not feare the Bishops conclusion, syth the antecedent was so naught.
And shall we nowe M. Horne (sayth he) your antecedent matter beeing so naught greatly feare the consequent, and conclusion ye will hereof inferre? Nay pardie.
Well sworne master Stapleton, ye can not sweare by a greater.
But if one of your companie would do so much for me, as to remember you but with a good phillip, that your foreheade smarted withall, ye woulde not thus lightly take the name of God in vaine, but it was done (in this your beginning ex abrupto, and shall we, &c.) to shewe your bolde manhoode.
Shall we feare (say you) the Bishops conclusion his antecedent being so naught? nay perdie.
No, in no wyse, M. Stapl. feare it not: but stande to it euen as you did to the other, that is to say, take your héeles and runne quite away from it.
And be it naught, or be it good, aunswere not a worde thereto.
But onely wrangle aboute some bye worde or other, finding play with the Reader aboute other matters, and thn euen as you aunswered the antecedent: so shall ye shewe your selfe constant in aunswering the conclusion.
For what else is all your first part (where, if ye feare not the Bishops consequent, ye should denie it, and shew some reason thereof, or distinguish the same, or else ye graunt it) but a bare shifting off to other matters? as this, bicause the Bishop called the Emperour (on Nicephorus his commenmendation) a Christian Emperour, an example, a spectacle, a glasse for other, as one that refourmed Religion to the purenesse thereof: This (say you) in suche a personage as yee counterfey, can not bee but a deadlye and a mortall sinne.
Herevppon ye snatche occasion to fling at master Foxes bóoke of Martyrs once againe, about M. Doctor VVesalian, of whome ye say ye spake before.
Here againe ye come to your former Qu (like the Pharisey) despising the Bishop as one that is farre from the knowledge of Bishop White and Bishop Gardiner, these are Reuerend fathers with you, as for the bishop nowe, is a verye poore sielie Clerke, and howe mete to occupie such a roume, ye leaue it to others discrete and vpright iudgement.
There is no doubt M. Stapleton, but that ye meane some discrete and vpright iudges, to iudge this matter of both their learnings, ye shewe your selfe so vpright betwéene them.
But what shall those discrete men iudge of, your vprightnesse and discretion in aunswering? For what is anye of these things to the purpose? although (setting aside this your impudent outfacing) what? man, it was well knowen what mightie great Clerkes the better of these twaine, Bishop Gardiner and Bishop VVhite were, either for law or for versifying, either for a Sophister, or a schoolemaister.
And yet in these pointes were they neither in primis, secundis, nor in ertijs.
As for any déepe knowledge of Diuinitie, or of ecclesiastical stories, which had bene fitter for a Bishop trow, Iwis, it was not so great but that a meaner man than the Bishop that now is, might hasarde a comparison with the~.
speake it not to the dispraise of their learning, woulde God, such as it was, they had emploiedit better to the glory of God the giuer, and the edifying of his Church, in setting forth his Gospell, as they ought to haue done.
For this is ye chiefest thing in a bishop, although the other are also necessarie, and, as ye say, among other, this the knowledge of ecclesiastical stories, which ye vpbraide to the bishop, as a verie poore sielie clarke in them.
But thus much your impudencie driueth me to saye, that neither of your two Reuerend Fathers, haue taken a quarter of the studious trauel in this point, that the B. that now is hath done, and hath shewed more fruite thereof, than euer they did, Scripture as they saye, maketh mention of all thrée, let your discrete and vpright men, or any other searche and iudge who lyst.
But wherfore in conclusion is all this adoe? forsooth the Bishop (on Nicephorus wordes) commendeth him, for a Christian Emperour, and sayth he, was a spectacle and glasse for others, and as one that reformed religion to the purenesse thereof, this can not be a venial but a deadly and mortall sinne, saith M. Stapleton.
Whosoeuer be the discrete iudge, you are no mercifull iudge M. Stapl.
there is no pardon with you but present death see well, woulde at least ye were an vpright iudge, to iudge vprightly of the matter.
Ye haue condemned the B. for saying an Ecclesiasticall writer commendeth him for a Christian Emperour, but what will you say to the same writer, if he will call him the most Christian Emperour? is not this warra~t inough for the B? he calleth him an exa~ple, a glasse, or a spectacle for others.
What if not onely Nicephorus say the same, a great deale more, but Langus your catholike Clerke say euen the same also, and commend him like wise for a paterne and mirror to the Emperour Ferdinande? But Lorde what a stirre is here, for that the B. spake of reforming religion to the purenesse thereof? Here is the Bishop and Maister Foxe chalenged both of them for heretikes, more than any of their felowes.
Here is Maister Stapleton disposed to haue his tongue roll, as though it had not walked and run at large before.
And then (sayth he) that may a little roll in your rayling Rhetoricke, wherein ye vniustly rore out against M. Feckenham, may not for much better cause and grounde say to you, than you did to him, to make him a Donatist, M. Horne? Let your friends now weigh with aduisement, what was the erroneous opinion of the Grecians against the holy ghost, and let them compare your opinion and guilefull defences thereof to theirs, and they must needes clap you on the backe, and say to you Patrisas (if there be any vpright iudgement in them) deeming you so like your great graundsiers the Grecians, as though they had spyt you out of their mouth.
Howe iustly or vniustly, the Bishop proued Master Feck. of set purpose to followe the steps of the Donatistes, is alreadie declared at large, and also howe teatly you haue excused him, and brought him and your selfe further into the selfe same briers: But howe vnftlye and vniustly here, ye woulde returne the Bishops words vpon himselfe, chalenging him to denie (as the Grecians did) the procéeding of the holy ghost from the father and the sonne: is not only manifest to the contrary, to all that knowe, and often heare, in publike place, the profession of his faith, to argue you to be a wilfull malicious lier, Abhominatio est domino labia mendacia, lying lips are abhominable to the Lorde: but also the Bishops wordsminister no occasion, to gather any such surmise vpon.
Which sheweth you to be a captious wrangling sophister, for the Bishop doth not flatly say, he was such an one as reformed religion to the purenesse therof, which you make him here to say, but he sayd, Nicephorus in his Preface before his ecclesiasticall storie doth compare Emanuel Paleologus the Emperour to Constantine, for that he did so nearely imitate his duetifulnesse in ruling, procuring and reforming religion to the purenesse thereof, in whiche wordes the Bishoppe sayeth, that Nicephorus commendeth him for this.
And this haue proued at large that Nicephorus doth so, which is the Bishoppes full discharge.
How be it this you wil not sée, but make it the bishoppes flatte assertion.
Which yet notwithstanding were it so, no man, except hée were sette on gogge of pure malyce, woulde wrest this sentence of the Bishoppe, to anye other matter, than to the present controuersie, of the Princes dutie and dealing in ecclesiasticall matters, and not to euery other opinion or vice, which was either in the Emperor, or in Nicephorus, or else in al ye Gretians.
And woulde ye but limit your selfe to the boundes of the question as the bishop doth: ye coulde not haue made this false extravagant chalenge.
And ye shoulde haue séene that not onely the bishop had discharged himself: but that, so farre forth as this controuersie stretcheth, both the Emperour, Nicephorus, and also all the Gretians (whatsoeuer they were in other pointes) in this controuersie of the Princes supreme gouernement, it appeareth, they were of a sounde and true opinion, although you call it schismaticall and hereticall, whatsoeuer be against the Primacie of your Pope, but till you prooue it so to be, no wyse man will be moued with your bare so calling it.
If you nowe denie that Nicephorus was of this opinion, besides the Bishops allegations that haue prooued it sufficiently: The same Preface of Nicephorus is full of other proues.
First, Nicephorus dedicateth his ecclesiasticall hystorie to this Emperour, not onely to haue his publike protection: but also to haue the Emperors censure and iudgeme~t, whether it were sounde doctrine, agréeable to Gods worde, and méete to be set out among Christian people, or no.
But chiefly (sayeth he) if anything shoulde not haue bene declared of mee in this woorke: that your myldenesse woulde pardon mee, and by the sharpenesse of your iudgement, you woulde clense my historie, eyther by adding to, or taking therefrom.
For whatsoeuer your iudgement shall more exactlye correct: that shall bee accounted both to mee and to all other, thankefull and sure.
Forbicause that, of all other which haue bene, vnto thee it hath chiefly happened, by the readynesse and quickenesse of nature, through the gift of God, to perceyue and finde out suche thynges.
And bycause thon knowest, both to reason and dispute wyth a iust moderation, and also hast skill to expound diuine matters with feare.
And bicause thou canst excellently conceiue in thy minde, and with an eloquent mouth declare that which thou thinkest good.
And moreouer canst in a maner giue such iudgement thereon, that one thing may bee throughly knowne from the other.
Neyther is there any founde so malapert or rash, that after thy correction and iudgement, will abyde to set his hande vnto thy writing· &c.
And the like sentence he hath towardes the ende of the Preface.
Thus besides his authoritie, such an excellent iudgement in determining and deciding diuine and ecclesiasticall matters, Nicephorus ascribeth to this Prince and commendeth him for: euen as you woulde do to the Pope, or any of your most reuerend holy fathers.
All which you cleane denie to Princes, to haue any medling, knowledge, iudgement, or determination in them: but rather commende Princes for ignorance, and woulde haue them onely meddle with iudging merecuill matters.
But Nicephorus, euen where the Bishop left in citing his allegations (which were sufficient to any man, except to such a brabler as you) sayth to the Emperour.
Moreouer thou hast (with a feruent order) made more sincere and purer than golde, the priestly vnction, which sounded of a certaine corruption.
And also both by setting out a law, and thy letters: thou hast taught a continencie of maners, and contempt of money, by meanes whereof, the priestly ministery of the common weale is become holy, the which in former tymes by little and little, through a corruption of discipline and maners, was defiled and depraued.
(And here noteth Langus in the Margin: Reformati Ecclesiae, The reformation of the Church.)
And thou conceyuing alwayes some more notable matter hast adorned the forme, and state, and Image of the Church, most beautifully polishing it vnto the primitiue example.
These things doth Nicephorus, ouer the Priestes, the Bishops, and the whole Church, acknowledge in this Emperour, for their reformation as he saith, so nere as could to the primatiue Church.
Which notwithstanding, as it was not true, in this errour: so was it not (I graunt also) in diuerse other corruptions, agréeing some of them with the dregges of Poperie.
Yet for all this, he that sayth Nicephorus sayth so, neither lieth on him, nor therevpon fauoueth their errours.
And he that sayth so in this poynt of the princes supreme dealing, and deliuering of the Grecians from that Thraldom to the Pope, into the which Michaell perforce had brought them: shall not onely say true in saying Nicephorus sayth so: but also that therein, Nicephorus or any other, so saying, sayth therein most true, he reformed religion to the purenesse thereof.
But nowe that master Stapleton will haue the Bishop clapped on the back, for an Heretike against the holy ghost, for shewing onely Nicephorus wordes, who shall clappe on the backe, Lazius, Langus, and all the doctours of Paris and Louaine, for setting out, allowing and approuing this authour to be verie Catholike in all poynts, not making any exception of Heresie at all? If there be any vpright iudgement in your selfe master St. let vs see you roll in your rayling rhetorike, and rore agaynst them.
Go clap them on the backe and say patrisas, and ye dare.
Ye might so be clapped your selfe by the héeles, or haue a fagot clapped on your shoulders if ye did, to teach you to kéepe your clattering clapper better in your heade.
Your second part is somwhat better directed to the allegation of the Bishop out of S. Paule with Chrysostomes and Cyrils iudgement therevpon.
Which you say is needelesse, and farre from the matter, &c.
That prosperitie of the common welth and true religion springeth from good regiment or Magistrates, which we denie not (say you) and that the decay of religion destroyeth or deadly weakeneth the other which is also true.
ye graunt these to be true, master Stapleton, bowe chaunce in your marginall notes, and store of vntruthes, ye quarell so sore thereat.
There ye say, there is no such words in Saint Paule and say: This would be noted how ye racke S. Paule, he nameth not religion at all, he doth not attribute religion to the rule and gouernment of the ciuill Magistrate, but peace and tranllitie onely in godlynesse.
Thus ye chalenge the Bishop there for falsehoode nd racking.
How truly shall appeare in the aunswere to your bederoll of vntruthes.
For here ye denie it not, but say it is rue, all that the Bishop hath sayd thereon, and graunt the as not preiudiciall to your cause.
But marke M. Stap. what here ye graunt, and confesse to be true.
That prosperitie of the common welth, and true religion, springeth from the good regiment of Magistrates.
If this be so as ye say: then the Princes regiment and direction in both these next vnder God (is simplie the principall:) is the fountaine of them both.
And as the ouersight, direction and chiefe authoritie of setting forth the one, so the ouersight, direction, and the chief authoritie, of setting forth ye other, floweth from the Prince, if either of those do spring from him.
For howe can that spring from him, whiche ye neyther make to bée deriued by anie meanes from him, nor he to haue any direction or gouernement off, nor anie taste, rellishe, care, or edling therewith, as nothing belonging to him.
Is this to be a spring or fountaine of it? Which syth ye graunte vnto the Prince (whether wittingly, or vnaduisedly, knowe not: nor by what cautele ye de to off the matter) it is simplie to esta the Bishops and to your cause, and your craftes, with your owne plaie words, that here ye say, it is true, and ye will not denie it, the prosperitie of the common weale, and true religion, springeth from the good regiment of Magistrates.
Whervpon it foloweth, that not only true religion belongeth to their regiment, out their regiment being a spring thereof, hath a superioritie, and the heade as it were, in direction and setting forth true Religion among their subiects, as the spring hath a superioritie, and is the heade, in casting forth pure water into the brokes or riuers.
Thus ye sée (master Stapleton) that the Bishops allegation is so necessarie and near to the matter, that both it concludeth the question in hande: and your selfe in the end, are ayne, or of force driuen, to yelde thereto in this poynt.
And vpon this, dependeth the other poynt, which ye graunt also to be true.
That the decay of Religion destroyeth, or deadly weakeneth the other.
Wherein ye say wel Master Stapleton, if ye graunt it to the purpose wherefore it is alleaged, that these two thinges, prosperitie and religion, are necessarily be combined in a Prince, whose regiment ye haue graed to be a spring, from whence both of these doe come.
For so, not onely Saint Paule and Chrysostome expounding him, Cyrill also meaneth: but euen Nicephorus, the authour last mentioned, in the sayde Prince doth commende: that felicitie, and the true worship of GOD were so knite in him, that godlynesse by hir force had drawne felicitie to hi, or rather GOD had ioyned and tempered them togither, to the ende, that by the helpe of bothe these, hee might become both in deede a marueylous helpe and succour, and also a steadie stay, and firmament, as it were, to diuine Ecclesiasticall matters beginning to fall away.
And to this purpose are these two so ioyned togither, in the Prince, that (as the Bishop sayeth, and you doe not gainesay th same) The wante of the one, (especially of religion) destroyth or deadly weakeneth the other.
Sith now therfore the B. and you agrée that these point are true, (and howe nere eyther of these doe comprehende the matter in controuersie, is apparant) wherefore doe you in néedelesse examples, and farre from the matter, spende the time to prooue that which neither the Bishop nor you enye? As the vtter ruine (say you) of the Empyre of Greece proceeding from the manifolde heresies, especially that whereof we haue discoursed, doth to well and to plainly testifie.
And therefore wold wishe you and maister Foxe, with others, but you two aboue all others, with good aduisement to note, that as the wicked Iewes that crucified Christ about the holy time of Easter, were at the verye same time or thereabout, besieged of the Romaines, and shortlye after brought to such desolation, and to such miserable wretched state, as in a maner is incredible, sauing that beside the foreseeing and foresaying therof by Christ, there is extant at this day a true faithful report· eue~ so your dearlings the Grecia~s, whose error, but not alone, but accompanied with some other, that you at this day stoutly defend, yet especially rested in this heresie against the holy ghost, that ye terme with an vnclean an impure mouth, pure religion, were in their chiefe citie of Constantinople, in the time of Constantinus sonne to Iohn, nephew to Andronicus your Emanuels father, euen about VVhitfontide (at which time the Catholike Church in true and syncere fayth, concerning the holye ghost, keepeth a solemne festiuall day of the holy ghost, sodenlye by the wicked Turkes besieged, and shortly after the Citie and the whole Greeke Empire came into the Turkes handes and possession.
VVherein God seemeth as before to the Iewes, so afterwardes to the Grecians, as it were with pointing and notifying it with his finger, to shew and to notifie vnto all the worlde the cause of the finall destruction aswell of the one as of the other people.
What is all this to the purpose M. Stapleton? what maketh this against the Bishoppes matter, or to further yours, except to lengthen your tale? although it séemeth that your tale is false, neyther you agrée with your selfe therein, it is false, bicause at that time the great Turke, besieged and wonne the Empire of Gréece, the Grecians had forsaken this heresie, yea, and that more is, acknowledged the Popes supremacie (wherein the question lyeth whether in so doing they fell into another or no) for after their agréement at Lions councell by Michaell Paleologus, and their reuolt agayne vnder Andronicus the elder: Iohn the sonne of Emanuell nephewe to Andronicus the yonger, whom before ye mentioned, came to the councell at Florence, that was called in spits of Basill councell, and agréed with Pope Eugenius, whome Basill Councell had deposed, and so continued in agréement with the Pope, till in Constantinus reigne, brother to this Iohn, the Turke besieged and ouercame them.
And so your tale is false, that say, they rested in this opinion till their captiuitie.
Whereas, a good while before, they had quite forsaken it: after they fully vnderstoode the Latines opinion theron, which before they did not.
Secondly, ye agrée not with your owne tale, for both in your Preface, and hereafter in many places, ye ascribe the captiuitie of them, chiefly to their not acknowledging of the Pope: and so doth Uolaterane, which is as false as the other.
For at that time they were fully agréed with him.
And here (as one that had forgotten his former tale) you ascribe the chiefe cause of their captiuitie, to the heresie against the holy ghost, and so make your proportion betwéene the Iewes bondage at Easter, and theirs at Whitsontide, at what time is celebrated the solemne feast of the holy ghost.
And thereon, ye take vppon you (as though ye were of Gods secrete counsayle) to tell vs howe God poynted out the matter wyth hys finger.
But where to is all this so farre fetched about? how is it brought into the purpose? For M. St. will haue nothing here that is nedelesse and farre from the matter, forsooth this must be presupposed, that the Grecians are the B· dearlings· and that the Bishop is of the same opinion, bicause he alleged Nicephorus, as is before said.
And her vpon he maketh his marginall note, a good aduert sement for M. Horne, to consider the cause of the destruction of Constantinople.
Where, by this rule, he may saye it is a good note for Langus, for Lazius, for the Sorbonistes of Paris, for his owne Doctors, and good maisters at Louaine (where he professeth himselfe a student in Diuinitie) to beware the same, for they haue commended Nicephorus to all the worlde, and they allowe his doctrine for pure religion in all pointes, not excepting this, and therforeal the Papists be belike the Grecians dearlings, and denie the proceeding of the holye ghost from the father and the sonne, so is it a fitter admonition for the Popish catholikes, than for the B. or any other Protestant, whose faith in this point, and all other concerning the holy ghost, the Papistes can not blemish.
And yet by your leaue M. St. the Papistes be not very sounde in all pointes concerning the holy ghost, as shall shewe you further when you require the same, and therefore they had more néede of the twayne, to beware of this ensample.
But since M. Stapl. will so faine haue this cause considered, of the Grecians captiuitie, graunt him, this their errour might worthily be noted, a sufficient cause, or any oter errour, or naughtinesse of life, might well deserue the heauy hande of God, and the scourge of such a tyrant as the Turke.
But, whatsoeuer they or we (to whome God be mercifull) at Gods handes doe deserue: not entering into Gods iudgement, but speaking of men, the most likely and chiefest cause of this Empires decay, is euen the verye Pope him selfe, his ambitious treacherie, first spoyled and diuided the Empire into twaine, and made all the West part forsake their sworne obedience.
And hath also so spoyled this part of the Empyre in the west, that besides the bare title of the Empire of Rome, the Emperour God wote, hath little or nothing, the Pope in effect hath all.
And where the Emperor of Rome had wont to be Lorde to the Bishop of Rome, and to other Bishops besides: The Bishop of Rome is nowe Lorde to the Emperour of Rome, and to all other Princes besides, and to attaine to his triple diademe ouer all Princes, he hath neuer ceased to stirre and moue such garboyles, as all Christendome hath lost, onely the Pope hath woon therby, and the barbarous nations haue ouerrunne all Europe, Asia, and Affricke.
No maruayle then if at the length, Christian Princes powers being diuided and weakened with continuall warre, and chiefly set on or maintained by ye Pope, especially against ye Grecians: the Turks at the last haue ouercome ye Empire, being destitute of forrein ayde, and of themselues, giuen to wanton effeminatenesse.
Although thus much may iustly note, they euer well ynough defended and maintained them selues, till they acknowledged obedience to the Pope, who was the first cause of their ruine.
Which done, they neuer throue after, but were in short time besieged clean ouercome.
When they had once giuen their soules captiue to the tirannie of the Pope, their bodies not long after became thrall to the slauerie of the Turke.
Which séemeth rather to be Gods iust plague vnto them, wherein (to vse your owne wordes) as it were, with pointing and notifying with his finger, he sheweth to all the worlde, to beware of these two aduersaries, the spirituall enimie the Pope, and the bodilie enimie the Turke.
Thus M. Stapleton, your néedlesse admonition toucheth your selfe and your Pope, nearer than ye were a wist.
Neuerthelesse, not so content, making as though you had (as in déede ye haue) ouershotte your selfe, you pretende to drawe nearer home.
But what speake of Greece (say you) wee neede not to run to so farre yeares or countries, the case toucheth vs much nearer: the Realme of Boheme, and of late yeares of Fraunce and Scotlande, the noble Countrie of Germanie, with some other that neede not name, be too too liuely and pregnant examples, of this your true, but needelesse and impertinent admonition.
How needelesse or impertinent the Bishops admonition was, is séene already euen by your owne graunt thereto.
But how needelesse in déede, impertinent altogither, are these your vaine admonitions, which ye cal, a returne: euery body may sée.
And how fitly they returne with a recumbe~tibus vpon your owne side: and how you controll your self for running to farre: and yet ye runne at randon furder about the Countries, to Boheme, Frau~ce, Scotland, Germanie, and other namelesse countries, to make them examples of your marginall note, Heresies the destruction of common weales.
But thanks be to God, none of their co~mon weales are destroyed, it is but your maliciouse slaunder on them.
And if they haue bene troubled or weakened, the Papistes practises haue euer bene the chiefe originals thereof, what soeuer ye pretende, (to deface the Gospell) by calling all doctrine Heresie, be it neuer so pure and holy, if it be not by your popish Church allowed: calling all countries and co~mon weales destroyed, how soeuer they florish in prosperitie, peace and godlinesse: if they refuse the Egiptian bondage of your spirituall Pharao the Pope.
But why mention you not all that parte of Hungarie, that acknowledging obedience to your Pope, neuerthelesse were ouercome and conquered of the Turkes? why forget ye your mightie bulwarke and holy knights of the Rhodes? wisse they were the Popes champions, and yet his blessing could not saue them fro~ the Turkish bondage.
You say there is some other place that ye néede not name, what meane ye thereby? Rome it selfe? that so many times hath bene sacked, destroyed and lefte waste, and at this day the olde Citie, for the most parte, not inhabited, except of owles and vermine in the ruines thereof, and the new Citie deftled (besides Idolatrie and superstition) with most notorious filthy fornication and stewes of courtizans, your Pope him selfe beyng the vicar of bawdes in maintayning his estate by such filthy lucre.
And this is counted among you, the most holy common weale, yea such a mirrour to all other: that those Cities whiche conforme them selues to this common weale of Rome, can neyther erre, nor be in daunger of destruction.
But euen so sayde Sodom and Gomor, till their destruction came sodaynly vpon them.
M. Stapl. hauing thus puffed vp his counterblast with these discourses in both his foresaide parts, descendeth now to the thirde.
And now might here breake of (sayeth he) from this, and go further forth, sauing that cannot suffer you to bleare the readers eyes, as though the Emperours Theodosius, or Valentinianus sayings or doings should serue any thing for your pretensed primacie.
In déede, M. Stapleton it is more than highe time, that you had broken off long or this, except you would or could haue answered· better to the purpose, and not to haue driuen your counterblast furder forth, with such heapes of digressions, needelesse to the matter, but not needelesse to your purpose, to bleare the readers eyes, when otherwise· you néeded a materiall answers.
But here (such is your zeale) ye can not suffer the Bishop to bleare the readers eyes.
This zeale M. Stapleton were co~mendable in you, if you ment good soothe, or the Bishop had bleared the readers eyes, and not simply and plainly set downe the truth, that euen the bleared eyes (if they were not cleane blinded with ouermuch affection) might well beholde it.
But it is rather to be feared, that as ye played before, pretending to dissipate and discusse mistes (where in déede none was) ye raysed mistes and caste cloudes, least the reader should haue espied the matter as it was: so here, though the readers eyes were cleere, ye would bleare and dimme them, and if he were bleare eyed any whit before, ye would soone mende the matter and make him starke blinde.
For euen as ye there did, so eftsones do you here.
The Bishops alleaging of these Emperours, stayeth you fro~ breaking off, and from going further foorth· ye can not suffer the Bishop to bleare the readers eyes.
And yet to any thing that the Bishop out of these Emperours alleageth (what soeuer the matter meane) ye answere not one worde.
Except this be an answere (as they say) to sette the Hares head against the Goose iublettes, to set one allegation against another.
If the Bishop hath bleared the readers eyes, he cited as long an allegation as yours, shewe then where he bleared them.
But false or true, say something to it, or to some piece of it, and not thus slinke away without any answere at all, to the whole, or any parte thereof.
What shall the reader iudge (if he can see any thing) but that the Bishop goeth plainely to worke, and it is you that would bleare his eyes, and put them out, if ye could, to kéepe the reader still in ignorance and wilfull blindenesse.
If the Bishops allegation be such as deserueth no answere: at the least ye might haue sayde so.
Howbeit, that you should not so bleare the readers eyes, and that the reader should sée both the Bishops plaine dealing, and the playne truth of the matter, and how fully it proueth the Bishops purpose, and the Princes dutie, care, charge, and supreme gouernment ouer matters Ecclesiasticall: will set downe not onely so much as the Bishop alleaged, but the whole Epistle.
Firste, hauing shewed, that the suretie of the common weale dependeth vppon Gods religion, and what a great kindred and societie is betwixt these twayne, true Religion, and Iustice: ith therfore we (sayeth the Emperour) are constituted of God to be the Kinges, and are the knitting togither or ioynture of godlinesse and prosperitie in the subiects, we keepe the societie of these twayne, neuer to be sundred: and so farre forth as by our foresight we procure peace vnto our subiectes, we minister vnto the augmenting of the common weale, but, as we might say, being seruaunts to our subiects in all things, that they may liue godly, and be of a religiouse conuersation as it becommeth godly ones.
VVe garnish the common weale with honor, hauing care (as it is conuenient) of them both, (that is peace and true religion) for it cannot be, that diligently prouiding for the one, we should not care in like sorte, also for the other.
But we trauaile earnestly in this thing aboue the rest, that the Ecclesiasticall state may remayne sure, both in such sort, as is seemely for Gods honor, and fitte for our times, that it may continue in tranquillitie by common consent without variance, that it may be quiet through agreement in Ecclesiasticall matters, that the godly religion may be preserued vnreproueable, and that the life of such as are chosen into the Clergie, and the great Priesthode, may be cleere from all faulte.
Thus doth the Emperour protest of the guidance, care charge that he thought belonged to his hie office, not onely in prouiding, ordering, directing publike peace and iustice but also as much, or rather much more, most of all, godlinesse, true religio~, Ecclesiastical matters, and Ecclesiastical persons, to liue blamelesse in their spirituall vocations, so well as the laytie to liue in peace and iustice.
And that in al these points the Prince is the knitting togither iointur of the one, so well as of the other.
Which flatly argueth, that the direction and preseruing of both causes persons, next vnder God, doth appertaine to his gouernment, being both knit alike to his authoritie.
What false dealing? what blearing of eyes hath the Bishop here vsed? hauing faithfully set downe the Emperours owne wordes, which as they fully shew Theodosius his minde: so they fully proue the present question, conclude the Princes supreme authoritie, so well in Ecclesiasticall matters, as in temporall.
To all this master Stap. thought best to answere not one worde, but to let it goe, telling vs, that the Emperours sayings or doings, serue nothing for our pretensed primacie: and that this is wandring in an ob scure generalitie.
If this be sufficient answere to the bishops allegation, let others iudge.
Ye complayne it is obscure, it may perchaunce so appeare to your eyes, bleared with affection, or rather blinded with wilfulnesse.
So is the Gospell obscure to those that would not sée, and the sauour of death to those that perish.
Euery body saue you, and suche as are bleared by you, may easily sée a farre off the playnnesse of these proues.
Nowe where ye say, he wandreth in an obscure generalitie, wherof can not be enforced any certayne particularitie of the principall question: Otherwhiles, M. St. ye co~playne of particularities, require the B. to proue generalities, or else ye crie, it commeth shorte.
Héere the Bishop hauing proued this generalitie, by your owne confession, nowe you quarell at generalities.
perceiue nothing will content a froward brabbler, but any other that liste not to quarell, will soone perceiue that this generalitie that ye complayne of, bothe comprehendeth the particulars, also satisfieth that, that ye call so often for, to proue a supreme gouerneme~t ouer all ecclesiastical matters in general, which fully answereth euen to the othe likewise.
Neuerthelesse, sith you would slip away by wandring about particulars: This Epistle of the Emperour sheweth his supreme direction and gouernment euen in particulars, and that principall particulars also.
This Epistle béeing directed from the foresaide Emperours to Cyrillus, a chiefe ecclesiasticall Prelate, and Patriarche of Alexandria, after the Emperours (as is before sayde) haue declared, this their generall care and gouernment· so well ouer ecclesiasticall matters as temporall: But when (say they to Cyril) we vnderstoode, both by our loue to God, and our mynd louing hys truthe, that these thinges mighte bee obteyned in those that are godly, wee haue nowe often thought it very necessarie, by reason of those thinges that haue happened luckyly, to haue a Synode moste deare vnto God, of those moste holy Bishoppes whiche bee euery where, &c.
And so shewing the cause of their delaye, and the necessitie of the Ecclesiasticall matters: they commaunde Cyrill, with other Bishoppes, not to fayle, bu be readie at Ephesus, at Whytsontide nexte following.
For (saye they) the Copies of the same Synode are already sente out from oure Maiesties to the bishoppes beloued in GOD, throughout all the Metropolitane Cities, that thys beeing doone, bothe the trouble, whiche hathe happened on these controuersies be dislolued, according to the ecclesiasticall rules, and those thinges corrected that are vnseemely committed.
And that godlynesse maye be, towardes God, and profitable establishement to publique matters.
Neither let any thyng be seuerally innouate, in any matter of any person, before the holy Synode, and the common sentence of it to come.
And we are fully persuaded, that euery one of the Priestes moste deare to God, both forbicause of the ecclesiasticall and publique matters, beeing throughly moued by this our sanction or Edict: will spedyly make haste towardes this councell, with diligent endeuour, and to their habilities consulte vpon these matters, being so necessarie, and apperteining to the good pleasure of God.
As for vs, we hauing muche care of these things, wil suffer no man lightly to be wanting, neither shall he haue any excuse before God, or before vs if any out of hande do not diligently appeare at the foresayde tyme, in the place determined &c.
Thus euen in thys Epistle, in particularities also, doth Theodosius shewe his supreme authoritie.
But you will say, these are not principall particulars, the principall particulars are to dispute vpon the questions, to resolue the doubtes, to debate the matter, and to indge and determine which parte is the truthe thereof.
These partes (say you) are the principall, these partes belong not to the Prince, but to the Priestes.
That these thinges, master Sta belong to those, that for their function haue the knowledge and profession of them, no man denieth, no more than that lawyers shoulde haue the lyke debating, trying, and determining the truthe, of any doubte in the lawe.
But this, nothing hindreth the Princes supreme authoritie and gouernement in his lawes, no more dothe it in the debating, trying, and determining doubtes in any ecclesiasticall matters (in the discussing wherof, the Prince is ignoraunt) debarre his supreme authoritie and gouernment, in all suche cases debated or defined.
These doings therfore though they be the principall in respect of the examining of suche doubtes, yet in respects of the ordering, directing, disposing, setting them out, and maynteyning them; the Princes dooinges are farre more principall particulars.
As when a doubte in the lawe aryseth, to call all the Lawyers togither, highe and lowe what estate soeuer they bee off, to appoynte them the place and tyme of meeting, where, and when, to directe and order their assemblie, and what they haue iudged to be the lawe therein, to ratifie and allowe it, to sette it foorthe, and maynteyne it, this dooing theweth the Prince to be the supreme gouernour in all Laive matters: thoughe he neyther debate nor determine the truthe thereof.
Sithe therefore Theodosius dyd thus muche, as this that is héere shewed, and as that, héereafter (to whiche ye referre your selfe) shall further declare: this is inoughe to argue hys supreme gouernement in all Ecclesiasticall matters, euen by these particulars.
If all this proue no supremacie, why graunt ye not thus muche to Princes nowe, that ye sée these Emperours had then? howe chaunce your Pope wyll neither suffer the Emperours nowe to summon a Councell, to cite and call the Bishops togither, to assigne them a place whereto they shal resort and kéepe their Councell, to appoynte the time to méete and begin their Councell in? Howe chaunce your Pope will not suffer Princes in their seuerall dominions to haue the like synodes, but will do all, either generall or Prouinciall, by him selfe, or by his Legates· Forsoothe when he dothe it, then it is a principall matter, it argueth his supremacie, and therefore none can do it but he.
But nowe, when examples are founde and alleaged, that Christian Princes had wonte to doe it: Ergo, They were supreme then belike therein.
Nay, then it argueth no supremacie, then it is no principal matter, nor any eccl. matter at al.
Thus you play mockhalliday with vs, and boe péepe, as though we were children, it is, and is not.
When the Pope dothe it, then it argueth a supremacie, when the Prince dothe it, then it argueth none.
And why so? for sooth, then the case is altered.
Thus do you dally out the matter, and when any substantiall proufe is brought agaynst you, either ye giue it suche a mocke as this, or leape cleane ouer it, as though ye sawe it not, or in stéede of answere to that that is propounded, propounde your selfe an other allegation, which is, claum clauo pellere, to driue out one nayle by another.
For to the allegation out of the Emperours Theodosius and Ualentinianus Epistle, ye answere nothing, but set a péece of another letter of Ualentinian to Theodosius in the téethe of it.
VVe, sayth Valentinian to the Emperour Theodosius, (say you) ought to defende the fayth which we receyued of our auncestors, with all competent deuotion, and in this our tyme preserue vnblemished the worthy reuerence due to the blessed Apostle sainct Peter, so that the moste blessed Bishop of the Citie of Rome, to whome antiquitie hath giuen the principalitie of Priesthoode aboue all other, may (O moste blessed father and honorable Emperour) haue place and libertie, to giue iudgement in suche matters as concerne fayth and Priestes.
And for this cause the bishop of Co~stantinople hathe according to solemne order of Councels by his Libel, appealed vnto him.
And this is writte~ (M. Horne) to Theodosius him selfe, by a co~mon letter of Valentinian.
And the Empresses Placidia Eudoxia, which Placidia writeth also a particular letter to hir said sonne Theodosius, and altogither in the same sense.
Héere ye clap vp a marginall note, The Popes supremacie Proued by the Emperour Valentinian, alleaged by M. Horne.
Herke~ good M. Horne, giue good aduertiseme~t: walk not and wander as ye do here, alleaging this Emperour, in an obscure generalitie, wherof cannot be enforced any particularitie of the principall question.
shewe you by your owne Emperour, by playne words the Popes supremacie, the practise withall of appeales fro~ Constantinople to Rome.
Héere is a ioly face of this matter, M. St.
But yet héere is not one worde to answere the bishops allegation, but to co~mend your owne, that ye set against it: and so thinke ye answere it, bicause it is of the same Emperour Ualentinian, whom the bishop alleaged.
But such answere as it is, sithe ye can make no other, we muste take it, or none at your handes.
Neuerthelesse, since ye so crake, that ye walke not and wander not in obscure generalities, but go playnly and particulerly to worke: if ye ment as ye say, how chaunce ye open not any of the necessary particuler circumstances of the matter, whervpon the Emperour wrote, whiche might haue made this matter plaine, would haue shewed what, and wherin they co~mended the B. of Rome, and what authoritie belonged to the Emperour.
Yea if you had but set downe a little more largely, the selfe same Epistles that ye cite: the matter had beene a great deale more cleare.
Ye say also, ye go truely to worke, and yet you falsly translate, euen those very words that ye cyte, and so cutte them off, ere ye come to the periode: that, that which shoulde haue shewed the matter, to haue béene about a particular controuersie of the fayth then risn, might séeme to be generally spoken of all controuersies.
And therfore ye leaue out these wordes: For the controuersie of the faith that is sprong vp: And where the wordes of your allegation are, Locum habeat ac facultatm, de fide sacerdotibus iudicare, that he may haue place, and leaue or facultie, to iudge of the fayth, and of the Priests: you captiously and falsly translate it, that he may haue place and libertie to giue iudgement in suche matters as concerne fayth and Priestes.
This subtile translation in generall ye vse, to make it appeare, that the Bishop of Rome hath a generall authoritie, to be the chiefe Iudge to decide all doubtes in matters of fayth, and to be the chiefe Iudge of all Priestes, where your texte inferreth no suche thing.
Likewise where the Emperour sayth, of the Bishop of the Citie of Rome: to whome antiquitie hath yeelded the principalitie of Priesthoode aboue all others: ye conclude that by playne wordes is shewed the Popes supremacie, and so sette vp your Marginall note, The Popes supremacie proued by the Emperour Valentinian.
Where in your letter are no suche playne wordes of supremacie, nor any proufe thereof at all.
Do you thinke that the Emperour acknowledged that supremacie, which your Pope nowe chalengeth and vsurpeth, not onely ouer all Priestes but ouer all Kinges and Emperours also? No master Stapleton, it is euident, by the dealing of these Emperours, and that euen in this matter, that the Pope, ad no suche supremacie, but the Emperour dyd those thinges then, that your Pope dothe clayme nowe: as further shall appeare, in the proper treatise therof.
Your Pope nowe woulde be lothe to be suche an humble L, and fall downe to the Egles féete, as the Pope dyd then to the Emperour, whiche nowe ye make the Emperour doe to the Popes féete.
For why, ye may ay, empora mutantur, nos mutamur in illis, the tymes are changed, and we are changed in them.
All the playne wordes and proues ye crake of, for this supremacie are these, that the Emperour sayth, antiquitie gaue hym the principalitie of Priesthoode.
But there is a greate difference betwéene the principalitie of Priesthoode, and supreme head or chiefe gouernour of Priesthoode, or that all Priesthoode is deriued out of the Popes Priesthoode, as diuers of your wryters affirme, that Christe made Peter onely a Priest, and all the other Apostles had their Priesthoode from him, and so all other from the Bishop of Rome, whome they call hys Successoure.
But as they erre in the office of Priesthoode (wherof God willing we shall speake hereafter) so whatsoeuer the office of their Priesthood was, their saying is manyfest alse.
For if Peter were a man as he confessed hym selfe to be S. Paule sayth, he had not hys authoritie of men, but immediatly of God, and Peter gaue him nothing, neither yet Iames nor Iohn.
And here, if might spurre you a question, bicause master Heskins setteth oute his Parliament, so solemnelie before his boke in pictures for the nonce, making s. Iames the first that sayde Masse, wherin he followeth the co~mon opinion of the Papistes: demaunde (if Peter was made the first priest, al other fro~ him) how s. Iames could say ye first masse that was said? was Peter made Priest without singing or saying his first masse, or any masse at al? then belike Peter was no masse priest, pope hath not principalitie of priesthood fro~ Peter, nor any priesthod at all from him, for Peters was no massing Priesthoode, suche as the Popes is, and pretendeth to be the principall of that order.
But at your leysure answere this, onely nowe note, that there is a great difference betwéene the principalitie of Priesthoode, and the supremacie of all the Churche of Christe, which is your conclusion, and that that your Pope chalengeth.
And yet suche principalitie or excellencie of Priesthoode, as it was, it neither came from God, nor from Peter, for any thing that either is playnely alleaged, or proued héere, but rather the playne wordes are to the contrarie, that this principalitie was yéelded and giuen to the Bishop of the Citie of Rome, by men, for so sayth the Emperour, antiquit as contulit, antiquitie gaue it.
Béeing partly moued with the opinion that Peter was bishop there, and partly for that Rome was the auncient and moste famous Citie of the Empire, as appeareth in the nexte Epistle of Placidia, by you mentioned, who calleth it, Ciuitatem antiquam, the auncient Citie, and the Citie that is the Lady of all the Emperours Cities.
And therefore it became them to conserue the reuerence therof.
For which considerations, that antiquitie gaue to it the principalitie, and to the bishop therof.
Which principalitie of priesthoode, or bishoph, was not aboue, but vnder the principalitie of the Emperours estate, as appeareth euen by these Epistles cited by you.
For first in the Epistle whereout ye take your allegation, Ualentinianus telleth, howe when he came to Rome, was (sayth he) bothe of the Romane Bishop, and also of other that were with him, gathered togither out of diuers prouinces, entreated to write to your mildnesse (saith Ualentinian to Theodosius, of the fayth, which beeing the preseruer of all faythfull soules, is sayd to be troubled, which fayth, beeing deliuered vs fro~ our Elders, we ought to defend with al co~pete~t deuotio~, in our times to co~serue vnblemished the dignitie of the reuerence proper to the blessed Apostle Peter, so that the most blessed B. of the citie of Rome, to whom antiquitie hath giuen a principalitie of Priesthood aboue all others, may (O most blessed Lorde, Father, and honorable Emperour) haue place and facultie to iudge of the faith of the Priests, and for this cause according to the solemnitie of Councels the Bishop of Constantinople hath appealed to him by his Libels, for the contention that is sprong vp of the faith, to him therefore (requesting and adiuring me by our common sauing health) denied not to grau~t thus much, as to moue my petition to your mildenesse, that the foresaid Priest (meaning the Bishop of Rome) all the other Priestes being also gathered togither through all the worlde, within Italy (all other former iudgement set aside) may with diligent triall, searching all the matter that is in controuersie, from the beginning, giue such sentence thereon, as the faith and the reason of the true diuinitie shall require.
For in our times, the frowardnesse of multitudes ought not to preuayle against religion, since hitherto the faith hath bene conserued stedfast.
And to the more perfect instruction of your worthinesse, we haue also directed the gestes whereby your godlinesse may know the desires and outcries of them all.
Which if ye had withall sette downe, it wold haue dashed your Marginall note and conclusion of the Popes supremacie.
It would haue shewed that this principalitie of priesthoode, was so vnder the Princes principalitie, that the Pope was faine to labour to Ualetinian, and the Empresses also, to write to Theodosius, that he might haue place leaue to iudge the matter.
And that the place of iudging it, might be in Italie, and the Bishop of Rome might giue sentence, not as he him selfe should please, but conditionally as the truth should require, and that thus he would admit the Bishop of Constantinoples appeale to take place, and so he sendeth all the gestes of the matter for the Emperour to peruse and know them, and to graunt their petitions and desires.
In all whiche things though there were a principalitie of the Priestes and Bishops and chiefly of the Bishop of the chiefe emperiall Citie, olde Rome, so farre as appertayneth to the debating, discussing, and iudging the doubtes in controuersie: yet so farre as appertayneth to the licencing thereto, the commaunding, directing, ordering, setting out, and maintayning euen of the same Synodicall iudgements, of the Bishop of Rome or any other: the supreme principalitie belonged to the Emperours.
And this appeareth yet furder by the other Epistles, that ye mention.
In the next Epistle of the Empresse Placidia, to Theodosius the Emperour hir Sonne, for the Bishops of Rome and of Constantinople: after she hath shewed with what teares the Bishop of Rome moued hir to write, she sheweth how all thinges were done vnorderly at Ephesus, against Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople, bicause (sayeth she) he sent a libell to the Apostolicall seate, and to all the Bishops of these parties, by those which were in the Councell, directed from the moste Reuerende Bishop of Rome.
VVho are accustomed (O moste holy Lorde my Sonne and Reuerent Emperour) to be put according to the Decrees of Nicene Councell: and for this cause, let your mildenesse (withstanding so great troubles) commaunde the truth of the Religion of the Catholike faith, to be kepte vndefiled.
And so ascribing a principall prerogatiue to the Bishop of Rome, she desireth the Emperor, that the iudgement of the matter may be sent ouer to him.
Which sheweth that the Bishop of Romes principalitie was vnderneath the Emperours.
Likewise in the next Epistle of Eudoxia to Theodosius, after she hath praysed the Emperour, saying: It is knowne vnto all men, that your mildenesse hath a care and earnest heedefulnesse of Christians, and of the Catholike faith, in so much that you would commaunde nothing at all to be done to the iniurie of it.
And after she hath shewed how the Bishop of Rome besought hir in the foresaide matter, to derect hir letters to the Emperour: saluting you (sayth she) desire right, that your tranquilitie would vouchsafe to haue care to the letters, and those things that are ill done ye would commaunde them to be amended, vntill that all things that also already are determined, be altogither reuoked, the cause of the faith and Christian religion that is moued, in a Councell gathered togither in the partes of Italy, may be fetched out.
For it is written that all this contention raysed, commeth from hence that the Bishop Flauianus might be remoued from the Ecclesiasticall dealings.
Thus do these Empresses write for Flauianus Bishop of Constantinople, and for the Bishop of Rome.
Wherein though they ascribe the dealings to the Councell and to the Bishop of Rome, yet the licence and authoritie to do any thing, or to stay any thing, they al ascribe to the Emperour.
And as they ascribe this, in these Epistles vnto him (which argueth his supreme gouernement in all these matters) so the Emperour in the answeres to these Epistles, that are immediatly set downe to those by you cited, acknowledgeth and claymes his supreme authoritie therein.
In the answere to the first, from whence ye bring your allegation for the Popes primacie, he saith: The Emperour Theodosius to my Lord Valentinian Emperour.
In the beginning of your letters, it is signified by your Maiestie both that your mildenesse came to Rome, and that a petition was offered vp to you, by Leo the most reuerende Patriarche.
As concerning your safe returne to the Citie of Rome (O my Lorde, my moste holy Sonne, and honorable Emperour,) we render thankes accordingly to the diuine Maiestie, but as concerning those things which the foresaide most reuerende man hath spoken, it is already declared vnto him more plainly and fully (as we suppose) and he knoweth that we swarue in no parte from the Religion of our fathers, and the tradition of our auncetours.
We will, no other thing, than the fathers sacraments deliuered as by succession to keepe them inuiolably.
For this cause therefore, hauing knowledge that certaine persons with hurtfull noueltie trouble the most holy Churches, we haue decreed a Synod to be holden at Ephesus.
VVhereas, in the presence of the most reuerend Bishops, with much libertie, and with sounde truth, both the vnworthie were remoued from their Priesthood, and those that were iudged to be worthy were receyued.
VVe therefore know nothing committed of them, contrary to the rules of faith, or iustice.
Therefore all the contention was examined of the holy Councell, Flauianus which was founde giltie of hurtfull newfanglednesse, hath receiued his dew, and he being remoued, all peace and concorde remaineth in the Churches, and nothing but truth doth florish.
Thus the dealing and determining of the controuersie, remayning Synodically to the Priests and Bishops, the decreing of the Councell, the assigning of the time and place thereto, the giuing them in charge to boulte out the truth, the receyuing intelligence from them of their iudgements, the allowing and ratifying their determination, belonged to Theodosius.
And in respect of this his supreme doing, though at other times he extoll the Bishop of Rome: yet here he onely calleth him, but, most reuerende Patriarche, and most reuerend man, as he calleth other Bishops.
Theodosius to my Ladie Placidia the honorable Empresse: our highnesse vnderstandeth by the letters of your mildenesse, what the most reuerende patriarch Leo hath desired of your highnesse.
To these your letters we declare, that concerning those things whiche are spoken of the most reuerende Bishop, we haue written often times alreadie more fully and more at large, by which writing it is without doubt manifest, that we haue defined or decreed or vnderstoode nothing besides the fayth of the fathers, or the diuine opinions, or the definitions of the most reuerende Bishops, which were gathered togither in the Citie of Nice, vnder Constantine of godly memorie: or of late were gathered togither at Ephesus by our precept.
But this onely we commaunded to be ordeyned, that all persons, which by noisome hurtfulnesse troubled the holy Churches, should worthily be remoued. &c.
Thus doth the Emperour commaunde the Councell to be holden.
He giueth a generall charge to the Bishops to ordeyne that that they ordeyned, to wete, the expulsion or deposition of perturbers of the Church whatsoeuer they were, and in what matter ecclesiasticall soeuer they were.
And when the Bishops had according to the Emperours commaundement ordeynes this decrée, and in their synodicall discussing of the matter, found out Flauianus (though therein they did him wrong) to be culpable hereof: then the Emperor peruseth, ratifieth and confirmeth the same their synodicall iudgement, and sayth, he defined and decreed it himselfe, bicause he approued and confirmed their definition and decrée.
Which is a manifest argument of Thodosius supreme authoritie, ouer all the Bishops debatings and determinings of their ecclesiasticall constitutions.
To the same effect is the other Epistle to Eudoxia.
Wherin he telleth the Empresse flatly, that since these things were alreadie decreed, it was not possible to determine of the matter any more.
In which deniall of suffring the matter to be tryed any further, he sheweth also his supreme authoritie of debarring and frustrating any appeales to Rome, that you make so great accompt vpon.
The Emperour will not onely not suffer it to take place, and to infringe the Councels and his owne doing: but sayth it is impossible to procéede on the matter alreadie determined.
And thus he reiecteth Flauianus appeale from the Epheine Councell to the Bishop of Rome.
Which Councell notwithstanding should also haue bene held by the Emperours leaue and appoyntment.
But he would not allow it, although Pope Lee laboured to him, and to Ualentinian Emperors, to Eudoria and Placidia Empresses neuer so much therefore.
Lo M. St. here are the generalities and the particularities also.
Hearken good M. Stap. and giue good aduertisement therto, since ye will not vtter it your selfe, and yet woulde haue vs listen to you.
You say ye wander not in obscure generalities, but ye go to worke plainly, truly, and particularly.
And yet of all this ye speake not one word.
Ye would neither answer the Bishops allegation, but set another agaynst it, which is no plaine nor true kinde of aunswering: neither yet for that you alleage, ye alleage it either plainely or truely or particularly, as ye pretende.
But cull out a piece of that, that séemeth to set forth your cause, by extolling the Bishop of Rome, and when the matter is plainly, truly, and particularly sifted out, it neither proueth any supremacie for him: and in all poynts, sheweth the Princes supremacie against you.
But ye are the more to be borne withall, for thinke ye read not the whole particulars, but either as your commo~ places led you, or the title prefixed tickled you, that saith In qua quo{que} Romani Pontifici authoritas comndatur, VVherein also the authoritie of the Bishop of Rome is commended.
And so gréedily ye snatched at that sentence, and let go all the residue.
But, call ye this plainly, truly, and particularly going to worke, master Stapleton? The.
THe Bishop hauing hitherto as master Feck required in his issue, proued by the Scriptures both by the olde testament and the newe, and by some such Doctours as haue written thereon, and also (which was more than M. Feck. requested) by the ecclesiasticall writers, Nicephorus, and by some of those Emperors whom they commend for most godly, proued the like gouernment in Church causes as the Queenes Maiestie taketh vpon hir of dutie to belong to ciuill magistrates: he concludeth ther vpo~, by these two parts of the request so satisfied, that they may and ought to take the same vpon them.
Which done, he promiseth to enter into the other twaine, to proue the same by the continuall practise of like gouernment in some one part of Christendome, and by the generall Councels.
To this answereth St. Hitherto ye haue not brought any one thing to the substa~tial proufe of your purpose, worth a good straw, neither Scripture, nor Doctor nor Emperour.
This is a short aunswere indéede, as if Iacke Strawe had made it, and not a student of diuinitie.
Such was the iudgement of Esops dunghill Cocke when he found the precious stone.
Haue ye done nothing master Stapleton but scraped strawes? though you estéeme better of your owne doings, wherevpon (as it were an other Chaunticlere) ye crwe and crake so often: yet set not so little by the doings of other men, and thse that are farre your betters.
But what are the Bishops proues the lesse worth, for this your strawish iudgement.
Your bolt M. St. is soone shotte, but a raylers tongue is they say no slaunder.
Let others iudge, that haue more iudgement, what the Bishops proues amount vnto.
And let them iudge euen by this your Counterblast, that ye haue blowne out agaynst these proues, to ouerturne them.
Which, had they bene as light as a strawe, ye might haue easily done, and neuer haue puffed vp such a stormie Counterblast.
But let them iudge what your Counterblast hath done, and whether ye haue blown away so much as one straw bredth from the matter, one proufe of al the Bishops proufes.
But least should also be like to you, remit ye iudgement of the whole to other: yea, in Gods name, to any of your owne side, that with any indifferencie will examine both.
Ye quarell further, at the least to blemish the Bishop with suspition of heresie, saying: Among your foure Emperors by you named, ye haue iugled in one that was a starke Heretike, but as subtilly as yee thought ye had handled the matter, ye haue not so crastily conueyde your galles, but that you are espied.
Ye haue told vs of this often inough (master Stapleton) if that would helpe you, though ye tolde it not so Iuglerlike as now, although with as much bitternesse of gall, as euer y^ Iugler or sorcerer Simo~ Magus had.
For, were he Heretike or were he not, (as it is a question, by Saint Augustines definition of an Heretike) yet in that point that the Bishop cited him, ye can proue him no Heretike.
But whatsoeuer he were, the B. is clearely discharged, to your owne shame and to all your doctors of Louaine, where ye learne your good diuinitie.
And this is al that ye haue to say to the Bishops proues hitherto.
Now, to that he promiseth to enter into the residue, there is yet one thing, yt (after all your raylings) ye co~mend him for.
Yet for one thing (say you) are ye here to be commended, that now you woulde seeme to frame vs a certaine fixed state of the matter to be debated vpo~, and to the which you would seeme to direct your proufes, that ye will bring.
And therein you deale with vs better than hitherto ye haue done, seeming to seke by dark generalities, as it were corners, to lusk lurk in.
Neither yet here walk ye so plainly and truly as you would seeme, but in great darknesse, with a sconce of dimme light, that the readers should not haue the clere view sight of the right way ye should walk in, who~ with this your darke sconce ye lead far awry.
For thus you frame vs the state of the questio~ These are but wordes M. Stap. to spend time and fil paper.
Ye tell vs before hand the Bishop will do so.
It séemeth he mindeth it not, euen by your owne confession, prefixing a state of ye matter to be debated vpo~, to direct his proues vnto.
This is not the way of one that would luke or lurke with darke sconces in corners, nor the hitherto hath gone thus to work, it is one of your ordinarie slaunders, his proues are euident, name one that is not directed to the issue set betwene him M. Feck. that fully proueth it not, but that sconce of your own hath left no corner vnsought, to usk and lurke in, and to lead the Reader about the bush, as besides this, your common place of impertinent matters, will (for the most part) declare.
THe B. hauing proued his issue by the two forsaid parts, the scriptures, the Doctors, being entred into the other twaine, the Councels the practise: since the issue requireth the proofe, of Any such gouernement as the maiestie now taketh vpon hir: the B. first expresseth hir Maiesties gouernment, theron, according to the issue, maketh his generall state, to leuell his proues vnto, ye B. words are these: The gouernement that the Q. Maiestie most iustly taketh vpon hir in ecclesiasticall causes, is the guiding, caring, prouiding, ordering, and ayding the ecclesiasticall state, within hir dominions, to the furtherance, maintenance, and setting foorth of true religion, vnitie, and quietnesse of Christes Church, ouerseeing, visiting, refourming, restrayning, amending, and correcting all maner persons, with all maner errors, superstitions, heresies, schismes, abuses, offences, contemptes and enormities, in or about Christes religion whatsoeuer.
This same authoritie, rule, and gouernement was practised in the catholyke Church by the most Christian kings and Emperours, approued, confirmed, commended by the best Councels both generall and Nationall.
The effect of M. Stapletons aunswere to this, is all against the state of the question, that the Bishop here setteth downe, and is diuided chiefly into thrée pointes.
In the first he chalengeth the bishop to alter the state of the question in hande, and setteth himselfe downe another state, to the which he woulde haue the Bishop direct his prooues.
Secondly, he trauayleth to show, that the Bishop concealed two clauses of the statute, that should chiefly haue expressed the state and what inconuenience may insue thereby.
Thirdly, he alleageth the excuses of the Papists, for refusing the othe.
In his first part, being deducted into these two members, to quarell at the Bishops state, and to set vp his own: for the former, thus sayth M. Stapleton.
Here is a state framed of you M. Horne, but fane square from the question in hande.
For the question is not nowe betwene M. Feckenham and you, whether the Prince may visit, reforme and correct all maner of persons, for all maner of heresies and schismes, and offences in Christian religion, which perchance in some sense might somwhat be borne withall, if ye meane by this visitation, the outward execution of the Church lawes and decrees, confirmed by the ciuill magistrate, roborated with hisedicts, and executed with his sword.
For in such sort many Emperors Princes, haue fortified stre~gthned the decrees of Bishops made in Councels both general National, as we shall in the processe see.
And this in christian Princes is not denied but co~mended.
What the state of the question in hande is, the reader hath often hearde.
How be it, such is your importunitie, that ye will neuer leaue your olde warbling.
But for the full satisfying of the Reader berein, let him once againe resort to the issue that M. Feck requireth of the bishop to direct all hys foure meanes vnto, wherin he would be satisfied.
VVhen your L. shall be able by any of these foure meanes, to make proofe vnto me, that any Emperour or Empresse, King or Queene, may claime or take vpon them any such gouernment in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes: shall herein yeelde. &c.
This then is the state of the question betwéen the~: whether any Prince may take vpon him any such gouernment in spirituall or ecclesiasticall causes, as the Queenes Maiestie doth.
Now wheresoeuer the B. proueth anything by the foure fore said meanes, that any Prince hath taken vpon him any such gouernement, as doth the Queenes Maiestie in causes ecclesiasticall: there the bishop kéepeth himselfe to the state of the question in hande, and satisfieth M. Fecknams issue.
What the bishop hath done in the two foresaide meanes, is euident by that that is past, let others iudge thereon.
Here, the B. entring into the other two meanes, prefixeth this issue againe before him to leuell his proues by.
The issue is now, that by any of these two meanes remayning, he shall proue that anye Prince may claime or take vpon him any such gouernment as the Queenes Maiestie in Ecclesiasticall matters doth.
And where the B. by any of these two meanes, shall proue that any Princes haue taken pon them, any such gouernment in ecclesiasticall matters, as the Q. Maiestie doth: there ye B. digresseth nothing from his question, also satisfieth M. Feck· demaunde.
This then being the state of the question betwéene them, the proofe of any such gouernment in ecclesiasticall causes: the B. first setteth here down the particulars that plainly declare, what gouernment this is that the Q. Maiestie taketh on hir, wherto he must direct his proues.
What is that gouernment, in what particulars consisteth it, that the Q. maiestie taketh on hir? Which when here the B. doth specifie, in the last Chapter M. Stapl. himselfe commended the bishop for his orderly going to worke therein, and now crieth out, here is a state framed farre square from the question in had: whether it be so or no, whether it be not plain dealing of the B. and plain warbling of M. St. let any man be indifferent iudge betwéene them.
But M. Stapl. sayth: the question is not nowe betweene M. Feck. and you whether the Prince may visite, reforme and correct all maner of persons for all maner of schismes, heresies and offences in Christian religion.
True in déede M. St. the question is not nowe whether the Prince may doe these things that you rehearse or no, but the question that is nowe in hand, being deducted out of ye words of the issue, (any such gouernment) demaundeth first, what kinde of gouernment that is, that the Q. maiestie doth claime and take vpon hir? to the which question the B. aunswereth: the gouernment that hir highnesse taketh on hir is such and such. &c.
And so the state of the question is knowne, what kinde of gouernment the B. must proue.
And looke where he proueth any such gouernment, there M. Feckenhams request is aunswered.
And if he can not prooue any such, then M. Feckenham may complaine that he is not satisfied.
And, as he is bounde to performe his promise of thankfull yéelding: so haue you no cause to warble at this the B. diligent enumeration of those particularities of the principal question, least, both ye should wander in an obscure generalitie, also co~trarie your late vaunt, that ye go to worke plainly, truly, and particularly.
But sée your falshoode, how chaunce ye set not downe the Bishops wordes as he spake them, but abridge them, of thrée parts of them and more, crying: Here is a state framed farre square from the question in hande? Here is a false subtiltie of you M. St. farre square from any truth, in hand, or out of hande.
The gouernment that the Q. Maiestie moste iustly taketh vpon hir in eccles. causes, is the guiding, caring, prouiding, ordering, directing, and ayding the ecclesiasticall state within hir dominions, to the furtherance, maintenance, and setting forth of true religion, vnitie, and quietnesse of Christes Church: ouerseeing, visiting, refourming, restrayning, amending and correcting all maner persons, with all maner errours, superstitions, heresies, schismes abuses, offences, contemptes, and enormities, in or about Christes religion whatsoeuer.
In place of all these wordes, euery one béeing materiall to shewe the particular things, wherein hir gouernment consisteth, that she claymeth: you onely for all these, set downe these wordes, The Prince may visite, reforme, and correcte, all maner of persons, for all maner of heresies, schisines, and offences, in Christian religion.
As though the Bishops particular words, specifying the poynts of hir gouernme~t, conteined no more but this.
Neuerthelesse, had the bishop specified no more, but these words that ye thus contracte: yet had he not swarued from the issue betweene them, (Any suche gouernment:) nor from the direct answering to the question, declaring any suche gouernment, chiefly the chiefe poynts therof, that the Quéenes maiestie claymeth, and you refuse to yéelde vnto hir.
For euen these particularities that you set out, ye will not graunte without an exception, and that is, in effecte, vtterly to denie them, althoughe in daliaunce of spéeche saying in some sense) ye would onely séeme to mollifie them.
For what else meane these your words? VVhich perchaunce in some sense, might somewhat be borne withall, if ye meane by this visitation and reformation the outwarde execution of the Churche lawes and decrees, confirmed by the ciuill magistrate, roborated with his edicts, and executed with his sworde: for in suche sorte many Emperours and Princes haue fortified and strengthened, the decrees of Byshops made in Councels bothe generall and nationall, as we shall in the processe see.
And this in Christian Princes is not denied but commended.
Christian Princes haue héere gotten afaire catche by this your graunt and commendation, to become your seruants, your souldiours, your slaughtermen, only executing with their swords, that you with your authoritie decrée and appoint vnto them.
Ye graunt the~ to visite, reforme, and correct all maner of persons, for al maner of heresies, schismes, and offences in Christian religion.
This is inough, M. St. for your part, to grau~t the Prince thus much.
Nay soft ye (say you) graunt this but with a perchaunce.
What? doth so waightie a matter hang by so rotten a thread? Nay, graunt not this perchau~ce neither, say you, but in some condition.
This goeth hard with Princes (M. St. to stand at this smal reuersion.
But go to, let vs see, how many Princes visite, reforme, and correct, all maner persons, heresies, schismes and offences? What is the condition ye wil make? Forsooth the condition is this: looke what maner lawes and decrees the Priests will make, the Prince shall only confirme them by outwarde execution of them.
Looke what maner persons the priests do say are heretikes, chismatikes, and offenders, the Prince shall execute them with the sworde and kill them.
Looke what maner religion, doctrine and doings, the Priests and Bishops shall in their Councels both generall and nationall, decr to be heresie, schisme, and offence: the Prince shal roborate, fortifie, and stre~gthen them.
And this is the only sense (sayth M. St. that meane, that they should visite, reforme, and correct all maner persons, heresies, schismes, and offences in Christian religion.
this sense, and this graunte, are quite contrarie the one to the other.
The Prince shall visite, reforme and correct all maner of persons, heresies, schismes, and offences: that is to say, he shall not visite, reforme, nor correct, any maner of person, for any maner of all these things, but the Priest shall do it, and he shall onely be the Priestes slaue and executioner.
Well, sayth M. Stap. be it as be may, construe it as ye will, this is the onely some sense that we may graunt it in, and in none other sense.
And this in Christian Princes is not denied, but commended.
Is not héere a proper graunt to Princes? and is not master Stap. to be commended for this some sense of christian Princes gouernment? But who is so senselesse, that he seeth not in this sense, that the Prince hath no gouernement at all, but is made a very slaue to the Popish priests authoritie.
And in this some sense, coulde master Stapl. finde in his heart to acknowledge a gouernement to the Queenes maiestie, and yet not without a perchaunce neither.
But without perchaunce master Stap. your sense sheweth, what good harte ye beare hir Maiestie, and all other christian Princes.
Now that M. Stap. hath thus chalenged the state which the bishop framed, and yet graunteth with a perchaunce thereto in some sense, which sense is as you haue heard: he taketh vpon him to set downe the true state of the question in hande: and prefixeth these words in his margine: The state of the question: and so procéedeth, saying: But the question is here nowe, whether the Prince or lay magistrate, may of him selfe, and of his own princely authoritie, without any higher eccl. power in the Church, within or without the Realme, visite, reforme, and correct, and haue all maner of gouernment and authoritie in all things, causes eccl. or no.
As whether the Prince may by his own supreme authoritie, depose and set vp Bishops and priests, make iniunctions of doctrine, prescribe order of Gods seruice, enact matters of religio~, approue and disproue articles of the faith, take order for administration of Sacraments, commaund or put to silence Preachers, determine doctrine, exco~municate and absolue with such like, which al are causes eccl. and al apperteyning not to the inferiour ministerie (which you grau~t to Priests and Bishops only) but to the supreme iurisdiction and gouernment, which you do annexe to the Prince only.
This say, is the state of the question, now present.
For the present question betweene you and M. Feck. is grounded vpon the othe comprised in the statute: which statute emplieth and concludeth all these particulars, had thought (séeing your earnestnesse, M. St. when ye came to me~tioning the statute that we should haue herd all these things (that ye haue thus as it were on your fingers endes particularly named) expressed in the statute.
But whe~ al co~meth to al, ye knit vp the matter with this: which statute implyeth concludeth al these particulars.
But sée, you employ your selfe (like your self) stil to false co~clusions.
And such as your co~clusions are, such are your proues.
You pretende here (after ye haue controlled the B.) to set down the true state of the questio~.
But as ye played in the beginning, so ye holde out rubbers euen to the ending.
Ye are stil the same man, that cried out of short wide shoting, hauing set vp new markes of your owne making, by this doing, both to defeate the bishops profes, also to deceiue ye reader.
Ye would fayne driue all to the othe, and make the othe the present question.
And why so? bicause (say you) the present question is grounded on the othe.
True in déede, bothe the present question, and all other questions about this controuersie, and the issue also agréed vpon betwéene these parties: is grounded (as ye say) vpon the oth.
And bicause ye present question is grounded theron, it is a good argument against you, that the oth is not the~ the present questio~, bicause the present questio~ is grou~ded theron, a question is not grounded on it selfe.
Ye shoulde haue marked, that though ye originall be of the othe, yet both the issue, the present questio~ in ha~d, being by degrées deducted from thence, make nowe an other state.
To the which, to this issue, if the bishop satisfie, ye can not iustly chale~ge him any further.
As for that state of the question that you set downe, and the particulars thereof, that ye say are implyed and concluded in the statute, that all those things are apperteining not to the inferiour, but to the supreme iurisdiction and gouernment, that ye say we annexe to the Prince only: al these are your most manifest vntruthes slanders, nor ye can finde them either specified, emplyed, concluded, comprised, or any wayes to be ment in the othe, or in the statute, or in any parte therof.
Neither the othe or the statute giue, al maner of gouernment and authoritie in all things and causes ecclesiasticall to the Prince: but ascribe to the Prince the supreme gouernment and authoritie in al things and causes ecclesiasticall.
True it is, that supreme gouernement is aboue ouer them, but yet the one is not the other, supreme gouernment is not all maner of gouernment.
Neither bothe the othe, or the statute, either in wordes, or effect of wordes, ascribe to this the Princes supreme gouernment, the making of Priests, and Bishops, the making iniunctions of doctrine, the determining of doctrin, the approuing or disprouing articles of the faith, excommunicating and absoluing, the preaching of the worde, and the administration of Sacramentes.
Where fynde ye any of these things so muche as to be gathered out of the othe or statute? Why say you, they all appertaine not to the inferiour ministerie (whiche ye graunt to Priests and Bishops only) but to the supreme iurisdiction and gouernement, which you doe annexe to the Prince only.
In déede, these thinges you make to appertayne to youre Pope, to whome ye giue such supreme iurisdiction and gouernement, as annexeth all this to his papal authoritie.
But ye doe wickedly herein, and iniurie to our sauiour Christe, to whom only such supreme iurisdiction and gouernment belongeth, and vnder whome, the inferiour ministers maye do these things, not as they please, but as he hathe prescribed them.
The Iurisdiction and authoritie appertaineth onely to ministers, bishops, or priestes, as ye call them.
To whome herein we doe not (as ye sclaunder vs) graunt only an Inferiour ministerie, but euen an higher ministerie, than wée giue to Princes.
In their spirituall ministration they are higher ministers: but in gouerning them, ouerséeing them, directing, punishing, maynteyning, placing, or displacing them, as they shall do their dueties well or yll: the Prince therein is higher than they, and his gouernement vnder God is supreme and chiefe in all suche causes, as belongeth to the Ecclesiasticall persons, or any other in his territories.
This is that the statute ascribeth, and the othe requireth farre from youre malicious and sclaunderous slate of the question that you haue here deuised.
Whiche (as ye say the truthe therein) the Bishop proueth not, for it is no part for him to proue.
Yea and proueth the full contentes of the Othe also, to the whyche ye woulde so fayne driue the question nowe in hande.
After ye haue thus sette vp a false and wrong state, and quarelled at the verie state of the question in hande, playnly and truely set downe by the Bishop: ye enter into your second part, wherin prefixing an other marginal note, Master Hornes dissembling falsehood: ye chalenge the B. to omit two clauses of the statute, the one at the beginning therof, the other at the ende.
That no foraine person shall haue any maner of authoritie in any spirituall cause within this realme.
By whiche wordes is flatly excluded (saye you) all the authoritie of the whole bodie of the Catholike Churche without the realme, as in a place more conuenient towardes the ende of the laste booke, it shall by Gods grace be euidently proued.
If that be a place more conuenient, why doe ye anticipate it here not so conueniently? where it appertayneth not to the question in hand.
The Bishop now medleth not with that parcell that excludeth all foraine authoritie, but onely with that parte that expresseth what manner of authoritie it is, that the Quéenes Maiestie taketh vpon hir.
And this the Bishop playnely and faithefully dothe, not here intermedlyng with other pointes of the statute.
But where that conuenient occasion is, there ye shall sée the Bishop touch that, that here ye call for.
And there a Gods name answere hym if ye can.
But your fingers itched, ye coulde not holde youre hande, but néedes ye muste euen nowe haue a fling thereat for a farewell.
Althoughe therein ye proprely ouertourne youre selfe, and yet to make somewhat of the matter, yée playe all the false playe yée can.
For where the Statute mencioneth onely anye forraine persone to haue no authoritie, you conclude, that it excludeth all the authoritie of the whole bodye of the Catholike Churche withoute the Realme.
Where as there the Statute mencioneth not the catholike Churche at all.
And besides, who séeth not a great difference betwéene these twayne, any persons authoritie, and the whole bodies authoritie? And who séeth not withall, that if England be a parcell and membre of the whole bodie of the Catholike Churche of Christe, and all the membres make one vnited bodie: then neither is the whole bodie foraine to the members thereof, nor the particular membres foraine to the whole bodie? Nor in déede any parte of this mysticall bodie is excluded.
But in that respect that one countreyman is foraine to an other, suche foraine authoritie of any foraine person, is thereby excluded.
But in regarde of the bodye of the Catholike churche, (if ye meane Christes holie Catholike Churche) there is neyther Iew nor Gréeke, Scythian, nor Barbarian, nor any forayne Countreyman: we are no straungers and forainers, but Citizens of the Saintes and of the householde of God, and all compacte in Christe, nor any is excluded oute of this Churche (if he be in, and of this Churche) bycause he is not forayne.
And where ye saye, the whole bodie of the Churche without the Realme, youre wordes implie a contradiction to themselues.
For if the realme be a parcell of the bodie of the churche, whiche perchaunce you will denye: or if the realme be a parcell of the bodie of the Churche, whyche you wyll not denie: then that which is without the realme, is not the whole bodie, as ye call it.
But lettyng this goe, what is that authoritie, be it of the most part, or be it (as you sa) of the whole bodie of the Churche without the realme, that ye would haue the realme allowe? If it be the verie Catholike church of Christe, then is it also the wyfe and spouse of Christ, and hath no authoritie to make any faith doctrine, or religion, besides that hir husband hath appointed: neyther England, Fraunce, Germanie, Italy, Spayne, or any other parte, or all the whole bodie of this spouse, hath authoritie to doe it.
And looke what parte doth not this, or presumeth to doe otherwise, becommeth foraine, and as foraine is cut off, euen as a rotten and putrified member seuered from the bodie.
Euery braunche (sayth Christ,) that beareth not fruite in me, my father will cut it away.
But if this authoritie be for such ecclesiastical discipline, as Christ hath giuen therof no expresse co~maundement: then euery seuerall part may receyue or not receyue the same, and yet is not estranged or made forrain from the whole corps of Christendome, yea though the most parte of the churche besides, authorised and vsed the same.
But euery particular Churche hath in it selfe authoritie to establish orderly, suche disciplines as shall be thought best and fittest for their estate: and yet is there no diuision or schisme from the whole, thereby.
But sith ye referre your selfe to a more conuenient place, where ye say it shall by Gods grace be euidently proued, it is not much conuenient to stand any more hereon, sith it is here but accessorie, and ye confesse your self that ye doe not, but ye will hereafter, by Gods grace proue it euidently.
But doubt me of two things, the one of your euident prouing therof, the other, that ye will doe the same by the grace of God, the dooing wherof, is agaynst the grace of God.
The other clause (saye you) you omitte, at the ende of the statute, whiche is this: That all maner superiorities that haue or may lawfully be exercised, for the visitation of persons ecclesiasticall, and correcting all maner of errours, heresies and offences, shall be for euer vnited to the crowne of the realme of England: wherin is employed, that if (which God forbid) a Turke or any heretike whatsoeuer, shoulde come to the Crowne of Englande, by vertue of this statute, and of the othe, all maner superioritie in visiting and correcting ecclesiasticall persons in all maner matters, shoulde be vnited vnto him.
Yea and euery subiecte should sweare that in his conscience he beleeueth so.
Is this a part also M. Sta. of the question in hand, for the omission of a part wherof ye haue so sharply reuiled the Bishop for a false dissembler? Is there no difference betwéene the kind of gouernment it self, or the particulars therof, the perpetual vniting of that gouernment· and the same particulars to the crowne, or any other suche clauses for the prefering of it? If the Bishop concealed any parte of that gouernme~t that the Quenes maiestie taketh on hir: then might ye haue sée ned to haue had some cause, to haue thus quarelled at ye B. but then ye shuld haue set down what clauses of any point of gouernme~t in ecclesiast matters, yt the Quéene claimeth ye Bish. omitted.
But this neither ye do, nor ye can do, but run about the bushe, picking quarels, that he let not downe other clauses also, that be no parcel of the question in hande.
The question is not nowe aboute the vniting to the crowne the supremacie that hir highnesse claimeth, but what that supremacie is, and what are the pointes, wherin it consisteth that are to be vnited.
The thing it selfe is one thing, the vniting of the thing is an other thing.
The B. hath to set down the thing it self for his leuel, for so ye question of the issue, demau~deth to proue any such gouernment as the Queene taketh on hir, If now the B. tell what kinde of gouernme~t it is, enter into his proues, to leuel the~ therto: doth not the B. deale playnly and truly? and do you any other tha~ kéepe your wonted wrnggling, which way soeuer the had go to worke? For if, when he vniteth himselfe only to his matter, he ca~not satisfie your brabbling quarels, but euen there, (suche is your impudencie) ye chyde bycause he straggleth not from his question: If he had vnited any thing else vnto it, and spoke~ of this vniting also, as now ye would haue him do: then woulde ye as faste haue cryed out on the other side, that he shot wyde, and set vp new states of the question in hande.
And thus woulde nothing stop your mouth, ye loue of lyfe to wrangle.
But all these quarels are but your starting holes pretending to fynde fault with the Bishop, where indéed your quarell is at an other matter, to caste (for a farewell at the ende of this your booke) a boane for the reader to gnawe vpon, to breede a suspition in his head of a greate inconuenience, and so to bring him in a misliking of the state.
At least to leaue him striken in the head with a doubtfull scruple of the squrle therof: As who should say cracke me this nutt, and there an end, answere me to this inconuenience that may followe hereon.
If a Turke (say you) or any heretike whatsoeuer, shoulde come to the Crown of England; by vertue of this statute, and of the Othe, all manner superioritie in visiting and correcting Ecclesiasticall persons in all maner matters, shoulde be vnited to him.
You haue a mischeuous meaning M. St. al the world may sée, but that ye dare not vtter it without an if.
But (thanks be to God) they be no Turks, nor any heretikes whatsoeuer, that ye shoot at, and refuse to obey.
God graunte all be whome ye wish in place: as for your Pope, whom ye would giue this supremacie vnto, as he is no whit better than any heretike whatsoeuer, so is he a more perillous enimie than the Turke.
worsse than he, can not be feared, excepte will put your case of the Diuell himselfe.
And shall we leaue ye certayntie of a present good state, for doubt of an ill to come? or for feare of a worse, runne to the worste of all? Thankes be to God the Quéenes Maiestie, whome God of his mercifull fauour hath placed to reigne ouer vs, and to enioye this supremacie, is neyther Turke, nor heretike, but a moste excellent and blessed christian Quéene, a moste syncere defender of the true faith of Christe, a most godlye nourse and mother of Gods people.
God for his mercyes sake, vouchesafe to blesse and long continue hir ouer vs, maugre all your spites.
But go to, will ye say, stande not the state present.
It is good for hereafter to forecast the worse· What if this should happen (as God forbid) that a Turke or an heretike should come to the crowne of England? Since there is no remedie with you M. Stapleton, but we must néedes answer this your wicked presupposall: for myne owne parte, will answere you thus.
First, there is a great difference betwene a Turke and an heretike, of both whome confusedly ye put your case· Turke is an open enimie to Christes religion, professing Mahomet that seducers lawe.
An heretike pretendeth to be a christian, but agréeth not with the truth of Christes doctrine, so that there might be a more lykelyhod of the one than of the other.
For this realme being Christian, and withall (God thanked therefore) so farre from any danger of the Turke (betwene whome and vs, bothe by lande and water lie many Nations) that yet of the twayne, the heretikes, of whiche there be many and subtile ortes, and all pretending to be membres of the Catholike Churche of Christ, were more lily to obtaine that whiche you presuppose.
Nowe if a Turke (a God forbad) shoulde come to the crowne: most lykely he coulde not get it, but by tyramicall vsurpation, as he doth other Countreys and then your question is aunswered for him, that of right neither this authoritie, nor any other vnited to the Crowne it selfe, is due vnto him.
Neyther wil he, if he be a Turke in religion (althoughe woulde take the Crowne, neyther coulor be, if he woulde, take withall this Christian kynde of Supremacie vpon hym, whiche is the subuersion of his false and Religion.
he would not take, any sue kynde of Regiment, as you your selfe allow to Christian Princes, and vnite vnto their crownes.
As for an heretike, might easilyer crepe in, to the obtayning the crowne of England, (which also God forbid) for no throne, chaire, or citie, place, or people, haue any warrant against this presupposall· The holie temple of Hierusalem became a denne of théeues, and their priests moste wicked murderers of Iesu Christ.
And in the seate. of Dauid sat many idolaters, yea farre mo bad than good.
Besides, that no natio~ is exempted fro~ this threat, Propter peccata populi regnare facit hypocritam, For the sinnes of the people, God maketh the hypocrite to reigne· So that nothing is impossible.
Our sinnes are such as may deserue, or Gods trial may be suche, as he may proue vs with affliction vnder a Turke, or heretike, or any other tyrant or vsurper.
But what is all this to the purpose? Shal not lawfull and godlie Christian Princes, (as Gods blessed name be praysed therefore, he hath so blessed Englande presently, with suche a moste happie Princesse, for all his moste gracious and rare gifts shyning in hir, that we maye iustly saye, Non taler fec omni nationi, he hath doone the lyke in our dayes to no christian nation: speak it not to flatter hir, or to blemish any other estate, but to glorifie God for hir, to confirme vs our allegiance, and to confounde your disobedience to hi highnesse) shal not, say, such Godly princes vnite ma sure to them and their heires, all such lawfull authoritie, as belongeth vnto their estate, bicause it may be abused by other Princes hereafter? If ye saye, it is not their lawfull authoritie, nor belongeth vnto them of ryghte: That woulde beproued fyrst, Maister Stapleton: for otherwyse, thys youre presupposall, toucheth as well their authoritie ouer temporall matters, as ouer spirituall.
If the one may be vnited bycause it is ryghte, why maye not the other béeyng ryghte als, be lykewyse vnited, withoute thys vayne castyng beyonde the MWue, to let goe a certentie of present righte, for feare of an vncertayne daunger of some inconuenience to come? And yet if any suche chau~ce should come, ye should alwaies consider a difference, betwéene a Princes authoritie, and a Princes tyrannie: betwéene his duetie, and hys doing, whether he be Turke, Iewe, Heretike, Heathen, or whatsoeuer he be, or whatsoeuer he do, he oughte to be a faithfull Christian Prince, and he ought to do nothing, but that a christian Prince may lawfully do.
Neither do any godly lawes giue the Prince that nowe is, or euer shall be, any other authoritie than lawfull authoritie.
And as for this clause of the statute, euen your selfe do confesse that it giueth none other superioritie, to be vnited to the crowne of the Prince, whatsoeuer the Prince be, or shall be, or may be, but to do that that is lawfull, and that that he oughte to do.
That all maner superiorities that haue or may lawfully be exercised for the visitation of persons ecclesiasticall.
And correcting all maner of errours, heresies, and offences, shall be foreuer vnited to the Crowne of the Realme of Englande.
These wordes ye sée vnite no other authoritie, but suche as may lawfully be exercised, and so lawfully it vniteth to the Crowne, the correction of errours, heresies, and offences, not the maintenaunce of errours, heresies, and offences.
Nowe, if ye thinke the Turke would thus do, ye thinke better of him than can conceiue, and make me to thinke worsse of you than thought.
If ye thinke the Turke (as is moste likely) would not do these things that the statute yéeldeth to the Prince, that is to say, he would vsurpe that superioritie that may not be lawfully· exercised, he woulde mainteine errours, heresies, and offences, he would set out the Alcaron and worship of Mahomet, and suppresse and beate downe the Testament and worship of Iesu Christ: th the statute toucheth him not, nor he the statute, no any othe is héere required, and your inconuenient presupposall is put foorth in vayne.
For the statute yéeldeth not all correction simply: but correction of errours, heresies, and off ences, that he exercise it lawfully, which the Turke will not do, nor can do, béeing an ope~ enimie to Christes true religio~.
And therfore where ye say on this clause of the statute: wherin is implied, that if a Turke, or any heretike whatsoeuer should come to the Crowne of Englande, by vertue of this statute, and of the othe, all maner superioritie in visiting and correcting eccl. persons in all maner matters shoulde be vnited vnto him.
This is your excéeding falshod to the truthe, and too much iniurie to the statute, and playne trechery to the crowne, to say that the statute implieth this doing of the Turke, or this swearing and beleeuing so in him.
For the statute implieth nothing, but that belongeth to a very christian Prince.
The statute implyeth no suche absolute superioritie of correcting ecclesiastical persons in al maner matters.
This is (to borrowe a worde of your owne rhethorike) too too Turkishly and spitefully put in of you, to make it appeare great inconuenience.
Where the wordes that ye cite of the statute, speake of correcting all maner of errours, heresies, and offences.
And is there no differe~ce trow you, betwéene the correcting of all maner of errours, heresies, and offences, the correcting al maner matters? The one no ma~ wil denie to be godly, to punish the euil.
The other is so large in deede, that if a Turk, or an heretike, had the doing therof, he might punish vertues in stéede of vices, truth in place of falshood, and say that he punished some maner matters, except truth and vertue be no matter with you, as it appeareth by this your presuppesall, and your false implying on the statute, that ye make it no great matter, either what become of Gods true religion, or of the Crowne of Englande.
It séemeth ye care not greatle, whether a Turke or any heretike whatsoeuer had the Crowne of Englande, or the Crowne of any other Realme, so that your Pope might kéepe his triple Crowne, and you the dignitie of your shauen Crowne.
Which to mainteine in honor, what daunger heretofore ye haue brought the Realme in, other can tell, and Englande hath felt the popish practises, to bring this Realme in bondage, the crowne therof to strangers.
And on condition, that this clause of superioritie were annexed, not to the Prince, but to the pope: M. St. could like it wel, and would spende to haue it so, the best peny in his pouch.
Although a more perilous enimie to Christ and Christes church, than is the pope, is neither Turke, or any other heretike, or archheretike whatsoeuer: that would not care if the mot royal crowne of Englande and most christian Realme, were on a fishpoole, bicause it hath reiected his superioritie: and to shew his good will thert, he hath abandoned it with his great curse, to any that will come, Christian, Heathen, Turke, Iewe, heretike, or whatsoeuer he be, that will either destroy it, or reduce it to his captiuitie, farre more dangerous to the soule, than is the Grecians bodily slauery to the Turke.
But all this M. Stap. will vtterly denie, that there were any suche bodage, if that this clause were vnited to the Popes triple Crowne.
Go to M. St. were this also graunted you: will not your owne deuised inconuenience as well come to passe, the pope hauing it for eur vnited vnto him, as if the Prince had it? What if there were an heretike Pope? what if there were a Pope, not only by his natiue countrey a Turke, but also one that practiseth priuie conspiracies leagues, yea reasons with the Turke against christian Princes, in all mischiefe of life, yea and errours of fayth also, were worsse than the Turke, and that the Turkes erroneous Alkaron, speaketh yet more reuerently of Iesus Christ, than doth the pope, that pretendes to be his vicar? What if there were a Iew pope, or one that would cause Christians to receiue Iudaise, yea to crue Christ agayne? What if there were a heathen Pope, or one that caused as grosse Idolatrie to be vsed, as dyd the Paynims, and beléeued as much of heauen or hell, of God or the diuell, of the bodies resurrection or of the soules immortalitie, as the Epicures or the Saduces dyd.
What if there were a whoremaster Pope, yea a whore Pope, a Sodomiticall Pope, a Iudas Pope, a Neronian Pope, an Antichrist Pope, and suche a Pope, as hath done more for the diuels kingdome, than eue~ the deuill him selfe could haue done? If this clause were for euer vnited vnto the Pope: how should we do then master St? pray you helpe vs héere at a pinche out of the briers.
If ye shall denie there can come any suche Popes: shewe why there may not come suche hereafter, as well as there hath gone suche heretofore.
If ye denie there hath bene any such Popes heretofore, and put me to my profes: wel, then must proue it, and God willing so will I, when ye shall bid me.
But if beforehand, ye thinke shal be able to do it, and you wil preuent me with a shift of descant, that though they were such ill Popes, yet, in respect they were popes, they were none of al these things, but in respect they were me~ (for so ye afterward excuse y^ matter, to which distinctio~ there you shall be answered God willing) yet here admitting also this distinction: why may not replie, that what soeuer the person shall be that shall haue hereafter the crowne of this realme, the statute and the lawe respecteth not the man that shall haue it, but the estate and authoritie that shall haue, and entendeth not that he is a man, but that he is a king: and so medling not with his vices and affections, setteth out his duetie and office, what he oughte to do, what maner of man he ought to be, in this respect he hath this authoritie.
And so euery way your wicked and malicious presupposall is answered, simply, but truely trust, howsoeuer other woulde answere it better, or (as better deserueth) giue it no answere at all.
Nowe hauing cast foorth your presupposition, as a snaring bayte, to bréede a scruple of some marueylous inconuenience: and after your false maner of concluding, hauing inferred that of the statute, that it implyeth not: ye begin to buskle vp your feathers and crow, saying: This kinde of regiment therefore, so large and ample, am right well assured ye haue not proued, nor neuer shall be able to proue in the auncient Church, while ye liue.
In déede for that kinde of regiment master Stapleton, that you inferre, and would as a mae set vp: it is a Papal, or Turkish regiment: and that the Bishop shall neuer be able to proue it, bolde well with you, nor be goeth about to proue it, but to improue it.
But that kinde of regiment that he here setteth downe of the Quéenes Maiestie, that will he proue, and hath alreadie proued it, for al this your Thrasonicall crake, which commit to muster in your common place thereon.
And let this his fellowe go with it for companie.
VVhen say (say you) this kinde of regiment, walke not in confuse and generall wordes as ye doe, but restrayne my selfe, to the foresayde perticulers nowe rehersed, and to that platforme, that haue alreadie drawne to your hande, and vnto the which master Feckenham must pray you to referre and applie your euidences, otherwise, as he hath, so may he, or any man else (the chiefe poynts of all, being as yet on your side improued) still refuse the othe.
For the which doings, neither you nor any man else, can iustly be grieued with him.
You maye saye, like a lustie Gentleman, what ye please master Stapleton.
say this kinde of regiment, and that kinde of regiment, and tell vs of your walkes, of your restrayntes, of your platformes that ye haue drawne, but these are but néedelesse vauntes.
Tell vs of that regiment that is in question, walke there a Gods name, restraine your selfe to that, be contente with the platforme that is alreadie drawne to your handes: otherwise master Feckenham, and all other, will sée that ye doe but brabble.
And as ye would drawe the Bishop to driue his proues thither, whether he is not bounde to referre them: so ye doe not onely deceyue the Reader, but offer wrong also euen to master Feckenham, whome ye take in hande to defende, and here ye make him such a childe, that he knewe not how to frame his issue, nor wherein he would be resolued But M. Feckenham (if ye defende him thus) may bi you meddle with your Fortresses, and let him alone with his cause.
And if the Bishop haue not in these two meanes, satisfied the demaund of his issue, then tell master Feckenham, that he may still refuse the othe.
But if the Bishop haue proued by any of these two poynts, the Scriptures, or the Doctours, master Feckenhams issue that he desired to be proued, that is, any such gouernment as the Queenes Maiestietaketh on hir in ecclesiasticall causes: then can not maister Fecken. iustly refuse the othe, but must vvith heartie thanks yelde therevnto, as he hath promised by wryting to the Bishop, or else he shall be holden as an vniust man, and as obstinate a wrangling Papist, as you shewe your selfe to be.
Which wilfull refusall, though it be a griefe to all the godly affected, that beholde your frowarde blindnesse, yet shall it be the lesse griefe vnto them, when they sée that neyther truth nor honestie will reclaime you.
Here, after the vaunts of your selfe, and the excusing of master Feckenham, ye enter into your thirde part, of excusing all the Papists, calling it in your margine: reasonable defence of the Catholikes for refusing the othe.
This reasonable defence hath two partes, the one, the excuse of the Papists: the other, the accusing of the Bishop.
As neither with vs (master Horne) ought you, or any man else, be grieued for declaring the truth in this poynt, as if we were discontented subiects or repining against the obedience we owe to our gracious Prince and countrey.
No man is grieued with you, master Stapleton (as ye pretende) for declaring the truth in this poynt, or any other, but onely for your not declaring the truth, but concealing the truth, and outfacing the matter with false countenances of the truth in this poynt and in so manie other.
Where in yée shew your selfe not onely discontented subiectes, but in heart verie rebellions, nor repining onely with discontented stomackes, but with open sayings, writings, and other seditions attemptes agaynst the obedience ye owe to our gracious Prince and Countrey.
Ye call hir gracious, but God defende hir gracious person from your vngracious practises, and from all such Iudas kisses of hollow hearted flattring Papistes.
For, howe vngraclously ye minde hir highnesse and your Countrey: all that heare your sugred wordesnowe, speaking as though that butter would not melt in your mealy mouth, and read your common place withall, collected of your most shamefull and notorious slaunders, that ye rayse vpon so gracious a prince and your natiue Countrey: would meruayle how that dubble tongue of yours coulde speake such contraries.
But ye are a Merchant for the nonce, ye studie Louaine diuinitie, that is to say, to beare fire in one hand, water in another, to laugh in ones face, and strike him with a dagger to the heart, as Ioab did with Abner and Amasa.
But let vs sée how trimly ye cloke this geare.
dare say neuer a Frier in Louaine can play the sinoother hypocrite.
For besides (say you) that we ought absolutely to obey God more than man and preferre the truth (which our sauiour him selfe protesteth to be, encouraging all the faythfull to professe the truth, and giuing them to wit, that in defending that, they defende Christ himselfe) before all other worldly respectes whatsoeuer.
What a godly pretence of zeale is here to God? were it not for pure loue they heare to God, master Stapleton promiseth for them, as theyr spokes man, they would obey their Prince.
Nowe surely this séemeth to procéede of an holy zeale.
But what is that they meane here by this absolute obedience to God? God may be absolutely obeyed, and the Prince also next to God conditionally be obeyed, as the chiefe setter foorth of Gods absolute obedience.
God in his holie worde neuer spake any thing against obedience to the Prince, whereby any Hypocrite might pretende a scruple of disobeying God, if next vnder God, he obeyed his Prince, but God in his worde commaundeth vs so to obey him.
What meane they then to alleage God for theyr disobedience? Forsooth here is a mystery, ye must vnderstande by God, the Pope, for so he is called, Dominus deus noster Papa, Our Lorde God the Pope· and their obedience to the Prince herein, is flatte agaynst this Gods obedience.
And bicause master Stapleton and his fellowes, are priests of this Gods making, they must therefore disobey theyr Prince.
So Thomas Becked died for Gods cause, and what was that? forsooth the franchisies of the Popes Church.
For all, that is for the Pope, and Popery, and the Popish priests honours, is only for God, for Christ, and for the truth, when it is for the Deuill as soone, as indéede it is for him the Authour of all such hypocriticall disobedience, and for their owne filthie lucre.
But God is a good God, he must beare the name of all· The Papistes being thus (by theyr Attourney master Stapleton) excused of theyr Disobedience: least this shoulde not be thought sufficient.
There is yet behinde one other proper waye of excusing themselues, and that is to fall in accusing the Bishop, that therby the papists may be thought the more excusable.
Beside all this say (sayth master Stapleton) whosoeuer will but indifferently consider the matter, shall see that M. Horne himselfe in specifying here at large the Queenes Maiesties gouernment by the statute intended, doth no lesse in effect abridge the same by dissembing silence, than the Catholikes doe by open and plaine contradiction.
Ye charge the B. here with abridging the Queenes Maiesties gouernement by dissembling silence.
This is your former quarrell, M. Stap. yet could ye hitherto proue nothing omitted, concerning the verie gouernment it selfe, and therefore ye wrangled about other clauses of debarring the gouernement from any foreine person, and of vniting the gouernment to the crowne of Englande, which bicause the B. set not downe as parcels of the gouernment, which ech man séeth are none, ye chalenge him of dissembling silence, and do as one that either hath nothing else to saye, or that this is some such notable triumph, that ye thought good to end your first booke therewith, as it were a gyrde to the Bishop, and a pricke fastened in the Readers minde to cause him mislyke of the Bishops dealing, and suspect the whole cause thereby.
This indéede were somewhat oratorlyke, if it were not so apparant an vntruth, that euery body might behold the falshood therof, the malice of you, and the impertinencie of the quarrell.
But as you thereby are able (crie it out as fast and as lowde as ye will) to proue nothing in word or déede against the Bishop, and therefore run to byous quarrels of silence and abridging in effect: so your selfe while ye would excuse your selfe, as not discontented nor repining subiectes accuse your selfe without any dissembling at all.
And are not ashamed to confesse, that ye withstande hir Maiesties gouernment by open and plaine contradiction.
Though therefore your accusation of the Bishop be to any indifferent man to consider the matter, no excuse of your disobedience: yet any that shall indifferently consider the matter, yea, though he were som what partiall on your side, sith so openly and plainely ye dare open your contradiction thereto, will holde you altogither vnexcusable, and iudge you on your owne mouth.
But let vs sée why ye are thus importune with the Bishop to accuse him so often, nowe in the ende of this booke, whether ye haue any newe matter to lay to his charge, that ye haue not yet vttred, how truly ye accuse him.
For (say you) whereas the statute and the othe (to the which all must sweare) expresseth a supreme gouernment in all things and causes without exception: M. Horne taking vpon him to specifie the particulars of this generall decree, and amplifying that little which he giueth to the Queenes Maiestie, with copie of wordes full statutelike, he leaueth yet out, and by that leauing out, taketh from the meaning of the statute the principall cause ecclesiasticall· And what is that you aske, forsooth, iudgement, determining, and approuing of doctrine, which is true and good, and which is otherwise.
For what is more necessarie in the Church, than that the supreme gouernour thereof shoulde haue power in all doubtes and controuersies to decide the truth, and to make an ende of questioning? this in the statute, by M. Hornes silence is not comprised.
And yet who doubteth that of all things and causes ecclesiasticall, this is absolutely the chiefest.
Why M. St. are ye nowe of a contrarie opinion to that (if ye be remembred) that ye were before? for then ye reasoned, that omission and silence was no deniall, but concluded the contrarie, Qui tcet consentire videtur, for he that holdeth his peace, seemeth to consent.
For there ye defend your client, here ye oppugne your aduersarie.
And belike ye haue some priuiledge from Rome, euer to turne the matter so, as may best serue your turne.
But and it were not for this your priuiledge, surely woulde further aske ye howe chaunce so soone ye haue forgotten your late vaunt, and euen in this leafe wherin ye crake, that ye walke not in generall wordes, but restrayne your selfe to particulars: now stande quarrelling about the generall words of the statute, and mocke the B. for particulars: if ye shal laye forth your priuiledge to doe this, when ye thinke ye may get some aduauntage thereby: yet thinke your priuiledge stretcheth not, both to wrest the state of the question in hande, and of the issue, to the statute: and to wrest and bele the statute as ye please, and thereof to gather what false conclusion ye lyst.
For first, ye do the Bishop wrong, th Maister Feckenham hath set vp his issue to be prooued, Anye suche gouernement in Ecclesiasticall causes, to driue the bishop from thence, to the wordes of the statute that expresse it, in all ecclesiasticall causes.
For by this issue betwéene them, though the Bishop in euery Prince continually alleage not ensamples in euery Ecclesiasticall cause, but nowe and then in all, nowe and then in some (for your Popes daily encroched on Princes, and at length got the mst of all,) yet hath the Bishop proued and satisfied the vertue of this issue, Any such gouernment in ecclesiasticall causes.
Howbeit, ye do him further wrong, to chalenge him here for leauing out any poynt of gouernment, in any Ecclesiasticall cause, that euen the statute giueth hir maiestie, that is to say, supreme gouernement in all things and causes.
Doth not the bishop set downe this M. St? hath he not specified euen the same wordes oftentimes already? and doth not his particular specifications co~teine as much here also? say you, he leaueth out the principall cause ecclesiasticall and most necessarie, meete and conuenient for a supreme gouernor Ecclesiasticall.
Soft M. St. stay here, or euer we demaund what this cause should be.
demaunde only now why ye say supreme gouernour Ecclesiasticall? is this your honestie in handling the statute? doth ye Quéene take vpon hir to be a supreme gouernor Ecclesiasticall? or doth ye statute giue this title to hir maiestie, supreme gouernor Ecclesiasticall? the statute saith supreme gouernor in all Ecclesiastical causes· And is there no differe~ce betwene an ecclesiastical gouernor, a gouernor in eccles. causes? but you vse this your false captious speach, to make yt people beleue the sla~der yt ye raise on hir Maiesty, as though she toke vpon hir to bean ecclesiasticall person, to be a B. and a minister of the worde sacraments, and by hir chiefe gouernme~t ouer bishops, chalenged to be a chief or head bishop of Bishops, like vnto your Pope.
And so hauing raised vp this slau~der on the Quenes maiestie the statute, ye chalenge the Bishop for omitting a principall ecclesiastical cause.
But what is that, you aske, forsooth iudgement (say you) determining, and approuing of doctrine, which is true and good, and which is otherwise.
Here againe M. Stapl. ye speake as captiously, for, if by this iudgement ye meane an authoritie aboue the doctrine of Gods worde (as all your side maintaineth) that the word of God receyueth his authoritie of the Churches iudgement· (which Church ye call the Priestes) and is authenticall, bicause they haue ratified it so to be, otherwise it were not true nor good: then in déede as the Bishop hath set downe no such iudgement, determining, or approuing of doctrine, neyther so coulde he haue done, for the Quéenes Maiestie keth no such supreme gouernement vpon hir, nor such supreme gouernement is due to any other than to God alone, who hath by Iesus Christ his sonne already fully determined in his holy worde, what doctrine is good and true· And what doctrine soeuer is besides that, is neyther true nor good, whosoeuer take vpon him to iudge, determine, and approue the same, be it eyther your Pope, or your Church neuer so much, yea, were it an angell from heauen must helde accursed.
But if ye meane by iudging, determining, and approuing of doctrine, such authority as only acknowledgeth, giueth testimonie, admitteth, alloweth, setteth forth, and strengthneth the doctrine of Christes onely worde, not a ruler ouer it, but as seruant vnto it, and the reiecting or abolishing of all other doctrine, against or besides that word then hath the bishop not left out this ecclesiasticall cause in the statute, though not iudging in that maner, that the ecclesiasticall gouernour, Bishop or Minister doth, in his sermons, or debating thereon, but for so much, as belongeth to a supreme gouernour.
The gouernment that the Queenes Maiestie most iustly taketh on hir in ecclesiasticall causes, is the guiding, caring, prouiding, ordering, directing, and ayding the eccl. state, within hir dominions, to the furtherance, maintenance, and setting foorth of true religion, buitie and quietnesse of Christes Church, visiting, reforming, restrayning, amending, and correcting, all maner persons, with all maner errours, superstitions, heresies, schises, abuses, offences, contempts, and enormities, in or about Christes religion, whatsoeuer.
Marke these words a little better M. Stap. and trust you shall sée it was you, that ouershot your selfe, and lefte out good attention, béeing caried away in a cocke brayne ume, with too hastie a preiudice.
And that the bishop left out héere no part of such iudgement, determination, and approuing of doctrine, which is true and good, which is otherwise, as belongeth to suche a supreme gouernour, as groundeth himselfe on Gods iudgement· determining, and approbation.
What do ye thinke? is true religion no good doctrine with you? If it be, the bishop hath not omitted it.
Can he care and prouide for it, direct and set it foorth, without iudgement? without the determining of it to be good and true? without the approbation of it? On the other side, are errours and heresies no false nor naughtie doctrine with you? if they be, then the bishop named them, and thinke ye the visiting, reforming, restrayning, amending, and correcting, can be without a iudgement and determination agaynst them? Then sithe he in playne spéeche ascribeth all this to the Prince, which fully answereth all this that ye call for, (if as sayd, ye vnderstande this iudgement, determining, and approuing a right) ye shewe what a very continuall wrangler ye be, where no cause at all is giuen.
But incontinent ye declare what ye meane by this iudgement of doctrine.
For what say you is more necessarie in the Churche, than that the supreme gouernour therof, shoulde haue power in all doubtes and controuersies to decide the truthe: and to make an ende of questioning.
This in the statute by master Hornes silence is not comprised.
this kinde of iudgement is not mentioned by the Bishop· but it is moste falsly mentioned by you.
For where ye say, this in the statute moste maliciously ye slaunder the statute, for this in the statute is neither named, comprised, or can be gathered thereon.
Neither the Quéenes Maiestie claymeth or taketh on hir this kinde of iudgement.
It is due onely to Gods worde, and your Pope and popishe Churche violently snatcheth it from Gods worde, chalenging it to them selues euen aboue Gods worde it selfe, although they agrée not héerein togither.
For the popishe Churche will be aboue the Pope in thys poynt of iudgement, maugre his bearde, and yet they graunt the Pope to be their supreme gouernour ecclesiasticall.
Though they will not relent to him this supreme iudgement, but giue it to the Churches iudgement.
And therefore they be of a contrarie iudgement to you, that say, this poynt is moste necessarie, meete, and conuenient for a supreme gouernour ecclesiastical.
By which poynt you wil make your Pope either no supreme gouernour eccl. ouer you, or spoyle him of a most necessarie, meete and couenient poynt of the supreme gouernment that ye giue him, but these are your iarres, agrée as ye wil (like cats in a glitter) about the~.
This popish churches or papall iudgement the Q. Maiestie taketh not vpon hir, nor the statute ascribeth it vnto hir, and therefore the B. had nought to do therewith.
Yet haue we one thing more, which after a couple of your slau~ders that answere not, but referre to your common place thereon, ye charge the Bishop once more for this omission.
Agayne (say you) preaching the worde, administration of the sacraments, bynding and loosing· are they not things and causes eccl? How then are they heere omitted by you master Horne? or how make you the supreme gouernment in all causes to rest vpon the Queenes Maiestie, if these causes haue no place there? What should a man vse many words with suche a brabler? who though he haue nought to say, yet will neuer le saying, of that which is nought to purpose.
Ye have beene often inough, and fully inoughe, answered to this master St. if the Quéenes Maiestie taketh not these thinges vpon hir, then the B. omitteth not any thing, that hir highnesse taketh on hir, in omitting these things.
Neither doth the· sratute yéelde vnto hir the doing of them.
It giueth a supreme gouernme~t in al these things to the Q. Maiestie.
And so these causes haue place there, so farre as is néedful to a supreme gouernour But from a supreme gouernour, which consisteth in caring for, ordering, directing prouiding, guyding, maynteining, setting foorth: to the executing doing, preaching and administring of those things: is as farre from any good conclusion, as you your matter are farre from truthe and honestie.
Neuerthelesse, such is your great co~fidence in this your Counterblast, as though ye had so puft vp the falshood therof, that no man could espie it: ye lustely blowe vp the last blast of this your first booke, saying: VVhich is nowe better appeale to all good consciences, playnly to maynteine the truthe, than dissemblingly to vphold a falsshod? playnly to refuse the othe, so generally conceiued: than generally to sweare to it, beeing not generally meaned· But nowe let vs see, how M. Horne wyll direct his proufes to the scope appoynted.
Why may not you appeale to all good consciences, M. Stap. as well as that mayden Priest of yours, that mighte bidde his maydenhead Goodmorrowe, and haue as good a conscience for your owne parte, as he for his parte had a maydenhead.
And to shew your good conscience for a farewell while ye shake handes, at the very parting ye lash· out a couple of slaunderous vntruthes togither.
Ye haue not many words to speake, and therfore ye huddle them vp.
You say the othe is conceiued so generally, that it giueth to the Prince your foresayde absolute power of determining all doubts and controuersies of preaching the worde, administration of the sacraments, bynding and loosing.
This lie to lappe vp all in the ende, was worthe a whetstone M. Stapl. and his fellowe that iutteth with him chéeke by chéeke, is as good as he: That the othe generally conceyued is not generally meaned.
But set aside your malitious meaning to wrest the othe: and the othe is playne and all one, bothe in wordes and meaning.
But howe soeuer the othe were not so generally conceiued, your meaning is playnely to refuse the othe.
And therefore héere in the ende for a remembraunce to all the rest, you must néedes strike vp the stroke with ala lia, and desperatly without al dissembling for the, matter vpholde a falshoode with falshoodes, euen to the laste breathe.
And the latter ende of that man is worsse than the beginning.
The answere to foure Chapters in Doctor Saunders seconde booke of the visible Monarchie of the Churche, concerning the question here in hande of a Christian Princes supreme gouernment in Ecclesiasticall causes.
First, of the difference of both povvers, the ciuill and Ecclesiastical, in the original, in the vse, and in the end of eyther.
Secondly, vvhether the Prince be the Supreme gouernour immediatly vnder Christ.
Thirdly, vvhether the Prince may iudge and define of ecclesiasticall matters.
Fourthly, whether Bishops maye depose Princes from their estate, and take from the realme their povver of electing their Prince, if they differ in religion from their Bishops.
VVhich foure chapters thought good here to answere vnto, both bicause he is the last writer, and chiefest novve of accompte among the aduersaries.
And these chapters aboue al other in his volume, both draw neerest to the question of the Princes estate, and shew vvithall, the full drift of the Papists, not only striuing agaynst the Princes supremacie, but into vvhat extreme slauerie they vvould reduce all Christian Kinges and kingdomes.
The argument of the fyrst Chapter of the difference betweene the Ciuile and Ecclesiasticall Magistrate, in the originall, in the vse, and in the ende of bothe.
MAster Saunders firste beginning with the original, lconfesseth, that both powers are of God, but not both immediatly from God the ciuile power he granteth to be of God but by the lawe of Nations, or the consent of people and other meanes of mans wit put betweene.
But streight he correcteth himselfe, that some thing in the ciuill authoritie was reuealed immediatly from God, yea, Per multa in lege Mosaica diuinitus instituta suerunt, verie manie things (pertaining to the ciuill power) were in Moses law ordeyned of God.
thinke therfore, it is agreed vpon, among all men, that the royal imperial power which at this day is exercised in the church in euery cause, wherof it is not otherwise disposed in the new testament, is to be holden of the law of nations, or of lawe ciuil.
To this answer: First, this in part is true, but in part so false, that himself confutes himself, making exceptio~ of diuers things in the ciuill power, that sproong immediatly fro~ God, neither were those things as he falsly saithe, Circa res terrenas.
about earthly matters but about ecclesiasticall matters in ye law of Moyses.
And although their ceremonial causes and iudicials, pertayning to ecclesiasticall matters in the ciuil power, be taken away with the ceremoniall and indiciall lawe of the Iewes, yet the ciuil power hath like authoritie, in the like causes ecclesiastical of the new testame~t, as is shewed out of S. Aug. against M. St. ye Donatistes.
Secondly, where he sayeth all the ciuil power nowe of christian kings and Emperors is all of the law of nations, or ciuil, except in cases otherwise disposed in the new testament.
answer this may well be graunted, and yet the ciuil power hath authoritie ouer ecclesiasticall persons, in causes ecclesiastical: for so, not only in the old testament, but also in the newe Testament it is playnly disposed.
Thirdly, to this diuision of the original of both these estates, that the ecclesiastical is from God immediatly, the ciuil by other meanes: answere, this distinction faileth, both by his own tale, saying: Ciuilis deo plerun{que} est per media quaedam, the ciuil power is oftentimes from God by certain meanes.
If it be oftentimes by certaine meanes, then it is not alwayes, and but accidentall, not of the nature of the estate, for so it is also immediatly from God.
And the like accident falleth out likewise of the ecclesiastical estate, that although the power be immediatly from God, yet many causes in it called Ecclesiastical, be also Per media quadam humani ingenij interposita, by certain meanes of mans wit put betwene.
For this cause (sayth M. Sand.) the ciuil power among the heathen that know not god, is found to be the same that is extant with faithful kings, although Christ wold not haue such power in the ministers of his kingdom, for he said: the Princes of the nations rule ouer them, and they that are iuniors exercise power ouer them, so shall it not be among you.
answere, first Maister Saunders, this is a like slander to M. Stapletons. fo.
The ciuil power is not found to be the same in heathen Princes that knowe not God, and in Christian Princes yt know God, there is a very great difference betwene these so different estates, wherin the one acknowledgeth all his power to be of God, and hath it described and limited by Gods word, the other takes it al for hu main naturall, not so much as knowing God by your own confession, from whome the originall of it springeth.
Secondly, to that you saye, suche power is debarred by Christe from his ministers: If yée meane by suche power, suche power as is among the Heathen, suche is not onely debarred from them, but from christian Princes too: If ye meane suche power as Christian Princes haue, is debarred from the ministers of Christ, then say ye true.
But howe then dothe youre Pope chalenge and vsurpe, bothe suche and the same also? Yea, your selfe afterwarde reason moste earnestly thoroughout all the fourth chapter following, that the ministers of Christe may haue it: Wherin ye speak cleane contrary both to Christ, and to your self.
Thirdly, note this eyther youre grosse ignoraunce, or your impudent falshood, in altering the wordes of Christe.
He sayth not they that are iuniors, or yongers, the Texte is [undefined span alphabet] they that are great, whiche are cleane contrarie.
If M. Stapleton were your aduersarie, he would rattle ye vp (Master Saunders) for so foule a scape.
Nowe to fortifie a difference betwéene the Ecclesiastical power and the Ciuill, he vrgeth that: the spiritual kingdom of Christ is in this worlde, but not of this worlde, as for the earthly kingdome is bothe in, and of this world: but the ecclesiasticall power is the spirituall kingdome of Christ, therfore there is a difference, but the spirituall kingdom of Christ excelleth all worldly kingdomes, therfore they are stark fooles that in any ecclesiasticall thing to be administred preferre the earthly kings before the pastors of the Churche.
If there be any follie, it is to striue for that that is not in controuersie.
We graunt a difference betwixt both powers and kingdomes, althoughe a question is to be moued, what he meaneth here by ecclesiasticall power.
If he take it as the Papistes do, we denie that ecclesiasticall power to be the spiritual kingdome of Christ.
For their ecclesiasticall power is ouermuch not in the worlde, but of the worlde also.
If he meane by ecclesiasticall power, the spirituall kingdome of Christ, as he in his word hath ordeyned the fame: although there be a difference betwene the power in the kingdom, and the kingdome in the which the power is, yet we graunt this gladly, that no wise man will preferre the earthly kings in any spiritual thing to be administred, before the pastors of the churche.
But this is nothing againste the earthly kings preferment ouer the spirituall pastor, to ouersée him rightly and spiritually to administer his spirituall things, in the ministration whereof, all earthly kings oughte to giue place vnto him, which we did neuer denie.
And sith there is no comparison betwene Christ the sonne of God, who is also God himself, and a creature of the law natural or ciuill, neither is there any comparison betwixt the power ecclesiastical, which is wholly giue vnto vs by only Christ the mediator, the power royall, which either altogether, or almost altogether is not ordeined of God, but by the lawe of nations or ciuill: for although God hath reuealed fro~ heauen, that belongeth to the power royall, if notwithstandyng that pertained not to eternall saluation which is hid in Christ, but to contein peace among men, that is to be reckned, to be reuealed no otherwise than to be a certain declaration which he had grafted in vs by Nature, or else euen necessitie ought to haue wroong out of vs, or profite according to the seedes of nature ought to haue brought to light.
answere, first we graunt, that the ecclesiastical power (not as the Papists stretche it, but as it is giuen vnto vs by only Christ the mediator, is farre superior without all comparison, than the royal power of Princes.
Howbeit, this hindreth not, but as the ministers are mediators thereof to vs, the royall power of Princes hath againe an other superior gouernment, to ouersée that there be no other ecclesiasticall power exercised by ye mediation of the Minister, than Christ the only mediator hath ordeyned.
And to remoue all popish oysting in giuing vs quid pro quo, whiche when the royall power hath done, it submitteth it selfe to the true power ecclesiasticall as not hauing a superioritie of all ecclesiasticall matters to exercise or doe them: but hauing a superioritie in all ecclesiastical matters to ouersée them rightly don and exercised.
And this distinction of of and In, M. Sanders him selfe vsed immediatly before, and vseth againe in the fourth chapter folowing: which also is a common distinction, and therfore maye well vse it, bycause it not onely expresseth the manner of the Princes Supremacie, but also detecteth the Papistes common fallatin, as thoughe by the name of Supreme gouernour, the Queenes Maiestie tooke vppon hir the gouernement Ecclesiasticall, when shée onely taketh vpon hir (that is due vnto hir) a gouernement in causes ecclesiasticall.
Secondly, answere, that although there be no comparison betwene these two powers: yet is the royall power farre aboue that which here he makes it, that nothing belonging to this power, hath bn reuealed from heauen pertaining to eternal saluation hid in Christ, but only to matters that conserue peace among men, springing of the seedes of nature, either for profite or necessitie.
Herein he saith in dede, as St. doth, but this is no lesse manifest vntruth, than shamefull slau~der to all christian princes estates.
The Scripture is euident to the contrarie, as well in Gods institution of the royall power, as in all the examples of godly Princes commended in the Scripture, not so much for their worldly policie, Iustice, peace and naturall giftes, as for matters pertaining to eternall saluation, both hidde in Christe, and reuealed in Christe also.
And let these things (sayth he) be spoken for the originall of either power.
The seconde point of difference he maketh in the vse and office, saying: But so farre as belongeth to the vse and office of those thynges, wee knovve that distinction to bee obserued in them, that he which had the full power ecclesiasticall, might also haue had in gouernyng the people of God, vvithoute any especiall consecration, as happened in Noe, in Melchizedech, in Abraham, in Moyses, in Helie, and in Samuel, and in the Machabees.
Howebeit, it was not onlyke sorte true, that hee vvhiche eyther by the Lawe of Nations, the Ciuil, was kyng (whiche is the firste degree of honour in this kynde) shoulde streightway haue also the power Ecclesiasticall, except that right had ben giuen vnto him by especiall consecration.
Yée confonnde your owne tale, Maister Saunders, and speake contraries.
Before ye sayde (speakyng of the Ciuil power of faythfull Kinges) Christus talem in sui regni Ministris esse noluerit, Christe in the Ministers of his his kingdome woulde haue no suche power.
Now ye say, He that hadde the one power, had (vvithout any especiall consecration) the other also.
And hereto yée ite these holye Fathers Noe, Melchizedech, Abraham, Moyses, Hlie, Samuel, and the Machabees.
Were none of these, Ministers in the kingdome of Chryste? Besydes this ye confonde your distinction, heaping vp confusedly these wytnesses, of the whych but one serueth proprely to the purpose, of the former part of youre distinction, for the Priestes to haue had the Ciuil power: nd that is Helie, to whome proprely the Ecclesiasticall power belonged, being the high Priest, and likewise had the Ciuil power, béeing the Iudge also.
But yet this was not without some especiall consecration or appoyntment of God thervnto.
For else, eyther it had ben ordinarie to his predecessours, or he had vsurped it, sithe none was Iudge among the Israelites (all the whyle that the Ciuil power was directed by that kinde of gouernement) but those that were by especiall calling appointed of God thereto.
As for the other, were of dyuerse tymes and sortes.
The holye Patriarkes, Noe, Melchizedech, and Abraham, hadde graunte also, bothe powers, Ecclesiasticall and Ciuil.
But at that tyme before the lawe, when bothe estates pertayned to them, by their birthrighte.
And this maketh rather for the Ciuill magistrate to haue had the ecclesiastical power, than for the Ecclesiastical magistrate to haue had the ciuill power.
For, the gouernment descending to them by reason of their birthright, was a naturall or ciuill gouernment, as your selfe before confessed, saying: Eenim vt pater infilium. &c.
For as the father hath a certain power ouer his sonne, the grandsier ouer his nephew, and so foorth, the elder ouer the yonger, this verily god hath wrought by the lawe naturall, while by the maner and order of my birth, he declareth him to be my superiour, which either ministred the cause why should be borne, or else is ioyned in some kindred with him by whome was borne.
And so these Patriarkes by birthright, hauing ye ciuil power, by the law of Nature, as ye confesse, had not the ciuil power, bycause they had the Ecclesiasticall, but rather had the Ecclesiasticall power, bycause they had Ciuile power by natural righte, till these two offices were by the Lawe of Moyses seuered.
As for Moyses and the Machabees, were indeed of the tribe of Leui.
Moyses had power in bothe estates, but béeing before the Ecclesiasticall power, was lotted to the tribe of Leui, and béeing the lawemaker, in appoynting it to the race of his brother Aaron: his example maketh agayne for the Ciuile Magistrate, rather to haue hadde the gouernement in Ecclesiasticall matters, than the Ecclesiasticall in the Ciuill.
The Machabees by an extraordinarie vocation had the Ciuile power.
As for Samuell was also of the tribe of Leui, but ye~t no Prieue, althoughe a Prophet, and the Iudge also, but by especiall calling of God thereto.
Nowe all these estates béeyng thus diuers, bothe in sortes and tymes, hee confoundeth together to enforce his obseruation, that the Priestes ordinarylye maye deale in the Princes office, but in no case the Prince maye deale with any thing belonging to the Priests, and yet his owne examples make agaynst him.
But what especiall consecration had Dauid, had Salomon, had Ezechias, &c. to gouerne the Priests in their ecclesiasticall matters? We reade of no especiall consecration, other than the dutie of their royall power.
But wherto tendeth all this? forsooth priests may deale with Princes, and take the Ciuil power vpon them ordinarily, but Princes in no case may deale with Priests.
Herevpon (say you) when Ozias woulde haue offred incense vpon the altar of incense, Azarias the Priest wente in after him, and with him the Priestes of the Lorde resisted the king, and sayde: It is not thy office Ozia, to offer incense to the Lorde, but it is the office of the Priests, that is to say, of the sonnes of Aaron, that are consecrated to suche mysterie.
The example of Ozias is often rged of himselfe, and al his fellowes, howbeit it is méere impertinent flaundederous.
The Prince taketh not vpon hir (as Ozias woulde haue done) the power, nor office, nor administration ecclesiasticall.
But suche power as Ozias did well take vpon him (while he was a good king) in ouerséeing the Priestes do their dueties, and not him selfe intruding into the doing of their duties.
But of this exa~ple we haue heard somwhat already in answering master Stapleton, and we shal haue more agayne in M. Saunders fourth Chapter, and therfore reserue my selfe to the larger answere of it.
To this he addeth an Item of Iosaphat, saying, Item{que}, &c.
And also Iosaphat the king of Iuda distinguishing both powers, sayde to the Leuites and the Priests: Amarias the Priest and your Bishop, stil gouerne in those things that perteine to God.
Moreouer Zabadias the sonne of Ismaell, who is the captayne in the house of Iuda, shal be ouer those workes that perteyne to the office of the king.
Beholde other thinges perteyne to the office of the Bishop, and other to the the kinges office.
This we haue beholden alreadie in Master Stapletons obiection of the same, and there may you M. Saunders beholde the answere.
And thus, muche agayne for the vse of both these powers.
Of the ende of both powers (not the last but the middle ende) that the ciuill power toucheth nought but this lyfe, Christ saith: Feare not the~ that kil the body, but they can not kill the soule.
And agayne, the Apostle willeth vs to pray for kings, those that are in authoritie, that we may hue a quiet and peaceable life.
quiet life therefore is the last ende of the ciuill power, dwelling without the Churche.
But of that which is in the Church it is not the last, but yet the proper ende it is.
VVhyle in the meane time the eccl. power belongeth to the lyfe to come, as Christ hath sayde, whatsoeuer ye lose on earth, shall be loosed in heauen.
To this distinction of the endes of these powers answere, it is false: not only the laste ende (as he graunteth) but the meaner endes also of the ciuill power in the church of Christ, stretche further than this lyfe.
appeale to all the doings of the godly Kings, Iudges, and ciuill magistrates described in the scripture.
appeale to Constantine the great, that thought religion to be the chiefe ende of hys gouernment.
Yea, appeale to the places, that euen héere M. Sanders citeth for his purpose· manifestly wresting mayming that of S. Paule to Timothie.
For he sayth not onely, Ut quietam tranquillam vitam agaus.
That we may leade a quiet and peaceable life, and there endeth: but he addeth further withall, in omni pietate honestate, in all godlynesse honestie.
In which two words, chiefly al godlinesse, what is included, is at large declared against master Stapleton.
But before this place, M. Sanders citeth the testimonie of Christ, that the prince can do no more but kill the body.
answere, Christe makes not the proper ende of the Princes power, to kill the body, but rather (as you said before out of S. Paule) to saue it.
To kill it, is an accidentall tude of his power, yet Iwisse, Christ spake not there onlye of ciuil Princes, but as muche agaynst the tyrannie of the highe Priests, or any other that woulde persecute the ministers of Christ to death, as your Pope you his chaplaynes do.
But pray you M. Sand. may not an ill Prince wrest his authoritie to destroy the soule also, with maynteyning Idolatrie false religion? In déede he can not kill the soule, for properly it can not be killed.
But that kind of killing that the soule may suffer, which is sinne, and damnation the rewarde of sinne) with the one, striken of the deuil by malice, and wounded of him selfe by errour: with theother, striken of God by Iustice, and deserued of him selfe by sinne) may not the ill Prince make his power be a meane therto? and may not an ill priest on this wise kill the soule as wel and sooner than he? wot what your pope Pius.
was wont to say, Mal medci corpus, imperiti sacerdotes animam ocîdunt.
Ill Phisitions kil the body, but vnskilfull Priests kill the soule.
You say your power stretcheth to the life to come.
In déede Sand. the true eccl. power stretcheth to the life to come, feare me yours doth stretch to life (as ye say) but not to come, but onely to the present life of the body: but, to death, of body and soule, both nowe and to come for euer.
Besides al this, appeale euen to your owne selfe, M. Sand. that affirme the ciuil power in the church of Christ, to stretch to farre further more proper endes tha~ this life: for in your fourth chapter folowing ye haue this quotation: Christianrum regna leularia non sunt.
Moreouer the kingdomes of the faythfll Princes, whose people feare· God, are not altogither earthly or worldly, for in that parte that they haue beleeued in Chryst, they haue, as it were lefte to be of the worlde, and haue begonne to be members of the eternall kingdome.
For although the outwarde face of thinges, which is founde in kingdomes meere secular, be in a Christian kingdome: Yet sithe the spirite of man is farre the moste excellent parte of him, and the whole spirite acknowledgeth Christ his king and onely Lorde, see nothing why Christian kingdomes ought not to be rather iudged spirituall, according to their better parte, than earthly.
And this is the cause why now so long since, those which gouerned the people of God were wont to be anointed of his ministers, no otherwise than were the Prophetes and Priests.
For euen the kings them selues also are after a sort· partakers of the spiritual ministerie, whe~ they are anoynted.
Not that they shoulde do those thinges that are committed to the onely priestes hereto orderly consecrated, but that those thinges whiche other kinges referre to a prophane and worldly ende, these kinges shoulde nowe remember, that they ought to directe to an holy ende.
For when they them selues are meere spirituall, it is fitte that they shoulde wyll, that all their thinges shoulde also be accounted as it were spirituall.
Loe, M. Saunders, in these wordes ye confesse farre other proper endes, and farre other estates also, in the ciuill power of Christian Princes, than this lyfe of the body, and the quiet tranquillitie therof.
And therfore what néede further witnesse, when your selfe are not onely contrarie to your selfe, but also beare witnesse agaynst your selfe? Now whe~ M. Sanders hath thus prosecuted these three differences of these two estates, he collecteth his conclusion, saying: But if the ecclesiasticall power differ from the ciuill, in the originall in the vse, and in the ende: and so well the beginning of the ecclesiasticall power, as the vse and ende is farre the more worthy: shall they not of wise men be iudged mad, which either confounde these powers or else woulde haue the royall, that is to say, the ciuill power, to be superiour to the ecclesiasticall? Howe madly for so wise a man, ye haue proued these differences, let wise men iudge (M. Saunders) and howe badly, if not madly, ye make your conclusions agaynst vs, let wise men also iudge.
For we neither confounde these powers, nor giue bothe to the Prince, nor make the Ciuill power simply superiour to the ecclesiastical power, although we giue the prince a superiour power, in respect of the ouerséeing that the eccl. power (whiche in the administration therof is higher, although not in the direction and maynteining therof) be not abused by the ecclesiasticall person.
Nowe M. Saunders hauing sayde thus muche of these three differe~ces, setteth downe a long sentence out of Chrisostome, wherein he extolleth the Priestly power, aboue the Kinges power, which notwithstanding, is nothing agaynst this superioritie that we attribute to Princes, although the office and administration of the ecclesiasticall power, be graunted to be neuer so muche superiour, and this is answered vnto sufficiently already in M. St. Yet bicause we haue hereafter to deale at large with M. Stapleton on the same sentence of Chrysostome: referre it to the proper and more fitter consideration of it.
And thus much hath M. Sanders for these thrée differences, which he sayth he speaketh agaynst thrée errours.
The first errour is of them that say the royall power in a christian Prince, is higher than any ecclesiasticall power, which opinion the Englishe Protestantes defende.
The seconde errour is of them, that extende the power royall, to certayne causes ecclesiasticall, to be knowne and iudged by the kings law.
To conclude the thirde is of them that thinke a christian Prince, at the least in all ciuill businesse, and in his owne realme, alwayes and without all exception, to be greater tha~ any ecclesiastical Magistrate, nor that for any sin that he shall commit in the Church of God, he can be remoued from the administration of the kingdome.
answere, neither these conclusions are sufficiently proued on these foresayd proues hitherto, nor some of them at all before mentioned.
As the deposing of the Prince, which is another question, and héere as madly thrust in, as maliciously and trayterously ment.
Neither any of these conclusions touche the English Protestants, for they defend none suche as you haue héere set downe.
Else in steade of M. Saunders, ye deserue to be rather called M. Slaunders.
No Christian king in his kingdome is the supreme gouernour in ecclesiasticall causes, immediatly vnder Christ.
IN this Chapter, as commonly else where, M. Saunders rhethorically dothe hide his methode, howbeit for perspicuitie sake.
will deuide this Chapter into three partes· The first is his arguments why he thinketh the Prince can not be this gouernour.
The seconde is the reasons why he thinketh vs heerein deceyued.
The thirde is the menes to dissuade vs from the acknowledging of it, by the euent and euill successe that hath ensued thereon.
And first for the first parte, his argumentes are of two sortes, the one, definitione, from the definition of a gouernour: the other, dignitate, from the greater dignitie of Priesthood, bring the argument, by comparing the dignitie of bothe these estates, from the olde testament to the Newe.
He that may be called a supreme head or chief gouernour, hath of necessitie the power of doing all those things, which can be wrought by the inferiours to the magistrates of that congregatio~, by their office, or by any charge, belo~ging properly to the same co~gregation.
He that chieftayne in an armie, hath not only the Imperial power ouer al Tribunes, and Centurions, but besides may lawfully chale~ge to himself to occupie the Tribunes place· or to be captayne ouer an hundreth, if at any tyme he shall thinke it meete for him selfe to do it.
He that can gouerne a whole common weale, can if he will, knowe of euery meane man, and not onely sustayne the turne, and fulfill the offices of the Prince of them all, but also of his Maior, or of the inferiour Iudges.
He that is a Bishoppe hathe power of baptising, and of shutting the Churche dores, and of distributing the Churches treasure, although those thinges are wonte to be done of the inferiour ministers.
To this definition, and these examples, answere, the definition is false, the examples are insufficient.
Fyrste, for the definitio~ it is not true of euery supreme gouernour, that he can or oughte to worke and execute all those things and duties, that euery one of his inferiours can or ought to worke and execute.
For the gouernment of thinges is one thing, and the execution of thinges gouerned is another thing.
Yea, these two are relatiua, and can not be confounded the one with the other, although they haue respecte the one to the other: for so, the gouernour shoulde become the person gouerned.
For although we admitte these thrée, yet we may obiecte a great many moe examples, in which this difinition holdes not.
Set aside the doing of all dyle and vnséemely offices, for a farre more meane estate than a Prince to doe, of which he hath neither knowledge, nor it were tollerable he should them: pray ye M. Sand. howe could a king ruling in his own realme, be his own ligire Embassadour in another realme? Wil ye say, he might make a deputie at home, and be Embassadour to his deputie abroade, and so the deputie to the king, shall be the king, and the king the deputie to the king, that is the kings deputie? But perchaunce ye will admitte this absurditie, bicause ye will not go from your worde, and say, well, the king may be so and he wil.
Here what if one should do with you, as heard once M. Feckenham tel the tale of a gentlema~, that defended, mustard was good with all meate.
One sayd nay, it was nought with this meate, another with that, but looke what any coulde recken vp: he still affirmed his saying, that mustard was good with euery meate, were it neuer so vnsauery a sauce therto.
Nowe when euery man had reckoned what he liste, at length quoth his owne man, that wayted on him: pray you master, and is a messe mustard good with a messe of milke? Ha (quoth his master)· thou haste marde all, thou shouldest haue heldae thy peace.
Nowe if master Feckenham that tolde this tale, shoulde deale thus with you, M. Sanders, that as lustily affirme the king may lawfully do any thing, that any of his subiectes may lawfully d, as the Gentleman sayd, mustard was good with al meate· If M. Feckenham would say: sir, and can the king do all that euen his owne wife, or any other mans wife, daughter or mayde, in things perteyning to their duties and offices can and ought to doe? Especially, sithe your selfe in prosecuting this argument, vrge the example of a woman.
All the women in his kingdome are his subiects, so well as the men.
He hath a supreme gouernment ouer all persons in all causes, can he therfore do their duties? and yet he can haue the supreme gouernment to maynteine all lawes of matrimonie, and to punishe all whordomes, and yet not like euery somoner, or other executioner of their punishements.
If ye say a woman may be no inferiour gouernour.
That is false, a wife hath inferiour gouernment in hir housholde, and many women haue had inferiour gouernments vnder kings in common weales, as the Lady regentes in Flaunders, &c.
But what if she were not an vndergouernour, yet if she be a subiect gouerned, the words of your definition co~prehend hir, saying: chiefe gouernour hath of necessitie the power of doing all those thinges, which may be wrought of the inferiours to the magistrates of that congregation by their office, or by any charge belonging properly to the same congregation.
But you will say perhaps, that women are of an other kinde, so that the king can not do al their offices.
As likewise for the ecclesiastical gouernment, the Apostles might not lawfully do all those things, that the widdowes chosen to serue in the congregation, mighte and ought to do: nor the ciuill magistrate of those congregations might or ought to do them.
Then will M. Feckenham presse you that your definition is false, a gouernour can not do all things that belongeth to a subiect.
If ye say, a woman is not a subiecte, that is false.
If ye say she is not a subiect in respect she is a woman, that is false also, for both men and women are subiectes to their gouernours.
If ye say she is not a subiecte in respect she is a wife: although graunt, the worde wife, hath an other relation than to the king (to wife vnto hir husbande:) yet what auayleth this, sithe many offices haue many other relations also, the sonne to his father, the seruant to his master, the scholler to his scholemaster, and yet all these be subiects to the Prince, although the Prince can not deale in all their seuerall offices.
But you thinke to salue all the matter with this exception.
say not that he which is endowed with chiefest power, should straight wayes haue the knowledge of euery lesser office, for this perteyneth to the fact and not to the right.
Neither say I, it is alwayes comely that he should execute the inferiour offyce by him selfe, but say there is no lawe to let him, no power wants, whereby the chiefe magistrate shoulde not do those things, which the inferiours in the same common weale are wonte to doe.
Go to, go to, M. Saunders, ye will still be like the gentleman, that would fayne haue eaten his worde if he durst for shame.
Ye come in pretily, and beginne to make some exceptions already: you admitte he may wante knowledge of many things perteyning not to his office, yea and that it is vncomely, he should do them.
And in déede M. Saunders if you be thinke ye of euery subiectes doings, ye shall finde many vncomely and vnreuerent things, for so highe an estate to do, and many things that he knowes no more howe to do them him selfe, than that Cooke that would put mustarde into his milke to season it.
What? and may the Prince do those things him self that are so vile, and wherof he hath no knowledge? He may, say you, and he will, what righte or lawe may let him? If ye talke (M. Saunders) of a wilfull foole, that will caste him selfe and his kingdome away: if ye talke of a tyraunt, whose will is lawe, that sayth as the Pope doth: Sic volo, sic iubeo, stet pro ratione voluntas: that is another matter.
But if ye talke of a king, and of a lawfull power, then say, his will and power, oughte to be restrayned by lawe, to do nothing vnskilfully nor vncomely for his estate.
graunt he may abase him selfe to some inferiour kinde of offices to do them: but not to all, no not by the right of his royall estate.
And yet by his gouernment all those thinges are done, that are orderly done.
Although he him selfe may not do them, though he would.
Do ye not remember S. Paules similitude (so ofte~ vsed by your selfe M. Saunders) of a co~mon weale resembled to our body? The head (ye say often) gouerneth all the parts and me~bers, but the head it selfe doth not nor can not do al, that al the parts members do.
We stande not, we go not, we sit not on our heads, our head reacheth not, nor ca~ reach euery thing that our hande can reache doth.
Nor the head doth or can do the office of the shouloers, back or belly, yet ye graunt the head hath supreme gouernment ouer al these parts, deuiseth lawes, orders, diets, prouisio~s, helpes for all the parts and actions in the parts of all the body.
Thus ye sée not only by similitudes examples (in which might be infinite agaynst your th exa~ples) but also by good reason, your definition of a supreme gouernour faileth, he may be a lawful supreme gouernour, yet can not do al ye offices of his inferiours.
Yea it were vnlawful for him to attempt many such things, and yet his lawfull supreme gouernme~t euen ouer all those things, that he him selfe can not do, nor ought to do, is no whit therby empayred.
And therfore this is a false principle, to builde, as ye do, thereon.
Nowe this béeing thus playnly proued a false groundeworke, let vs sée howe ye procéede to frame your argument on it.
VVhich things beeing thus foretouched, adde vnto them that the supreme head or gouernour of any Church, is the supreme magistrate of that co~mon weale, which no man hauing his right minde will denie.
Therfore if the king may rightly and worthily be named the supreme head or gouernour of that Churche, as nowe this good whyle is done in Englande: the same king shall also necessarily haue the facultie of working all those things, which of that magistrate, of that Churche may be wrought, otherwyse he is not the gouernour of that Church, in respecte it is a Church.
But in euery christian kingdome there are and ought to be many, that shoulde preache the worde of God, to the faythfull, that shoulde baptise in the name of the father, and of the sonne, of the holy ghost, the nations co~uerted: that should remitte sinnes, that shoulde make the sacrament of thanksgiuing distribute it: therfore he that is the supreme gouernour of any Church, ought to be endowed with such power, that no law should let, wherby he might the lesse fulfil do al these things.
But a secular king although he be a christian, can not do these things by the force of his royall power, else a woman also might bothe teache in the Churche, and also remitte sinnes, and baptise orderly and solemnly, and minister the sacrament of thankesgiuing.
For sithe bothe by the lawe of nations it is receyued, that a woman may be admitted to the gouernment of a kingdome, and in Moses lawe it is written, when a man shall dye without a sonne, the enheritance shall passe to the daughter: but a kingdome commeth among many nations in the name of enherita~ce: And sithe Debora the Prophetesse iudged the people of Israell, and also Athalia and Alexandra haue reigned in Iurie, it appeareth playnly that the kingly right appertayneth no lesse to women than to men.
VVhich also is to be sayde of children, bicause according to the Apostle, the heire though he be a childe is Lorde of all.
And Ioas began to raygne, when he was seuen yere olde: and Iosias reigned at the eight yere of his age.
But a childe for the defecte of iudgement, a woman for the imbecillitie of hir kinde, is not admitted to the preaching of Gods worde, or to the solemne administration of the Sacraments: permit not (sayth the Apostle) a woman to teache.
For it is a shame for a woman to speake in the Churche, and the same Apostle sayth, that the heire being a childe, diffreth nothing from a seruant.
But it is not the ecclesiasticall custome, that he which remayneth yet a seruaunt, shoulde be a minister of the Churche.
Sith therefore in the right of a kingdome, the cause is all one of a man, of a woman, and of a childe: but of like causes there is like, and all one iudgement: but neither childe nor woman, and therevpon neither man also (that is nothing else but king) can do those things in his kingdome, which of other ministers of the churche of God are necessarily to be done: therfore it commeth to passe, that neither the same king can rightly be called the supreme gouernour and head of the Church wherin he liueth.
All this long argument standeth stil on the foresayd principle that a supreme head or gouernour must be such a person as may do all the actions of all the offices, belonging to all the parties gouerned.
But this is a false principle, as alredy is manifestly declared, therfore al this long driuen argument is to no purpose.
The Prince for all this may stil be the supreme head or gouernour, ouer all Ecclesiastical persons, so well as temporall, in all their ecclesiasticall causes so well as in temporall, although he himselfe can not exercise all ecclesiasticall functions, nor doe himselfe all the ecclesiasticall actions of all ecclesiastical persons.
For else he might also be debarred of all supremacie, ouer all ciuill and temporall persons, in all their ciuill and temporall causes, bicause he can not himselfe exercise all the ciuil and temporall offices, nor do himselfe all the ciuill and temporall actions, of all the ciuill and temporall persons neyther.
And so shoulde cleane be debarred from supremacie in either power, nor haue any supreme gouernment at all.
Nowe taking this your false principle pro confesso· after your wonted maner, ye would driue vs to an absurditie, as ye suppose, by bringing in more examples of a woman, and a chyld, reasoning thus: pari, from the like.
woman and a child may be as well a supreme gouernor as may a man, and hath as good right thereto.
But a woman or a childe can not be a supreme gouernour in causes Ecclesiasticall: Ergo, man can not be a supreme gouernour neither, in causes Ecclesiasticall.
For to this conclusion the force of bothe the promisses, naturally driueth the argument.
know ye clap in a paire of parenthesis, saying in your co~clusion: neither a man also (that is nothing else but a king:) But sith these wr des ar neither in the maior nor the minor: ye co~clusion is plain· that a man can not be a Supreme gouernor in causes Ecclesiasticall.
And pray ye then tell me, who shall be the supreme gouernour in ecclesiasticall causes, if neyther man, woman, nor chyld may be? wherby are not only excluded ciuill Princes, but youre Popes are debarred from it, Pope Ioane and Pope Iohn also.
For if they vse that order in the election, to haue a Cardinall féele that all be safe, yf the Uersicle be sayde, Testiculos habet, howe can the quyre meryly syng in the responce Deo gratias? If hée be founde to bée a man, he can not be supreme gouernoure.
Maister Saunders therefore muste néedes mende thys argumente, or else the Popes, for whome he writes this boke wyl con him small thanks, except that they be Eunuches.
But Master Saunders not marking the sequele of hys conclusion, fortifieth the parts of his argument.
To confirme the maior, woman and a childe may be as wel a supreme gouernour as a man: he citeth the lawe, Num.
But these proues are superfluous, sith the controuersie is not on the maior, but on the minor.
Which minor is the point in controuersie, and denied of vs: that a woman or a childe can not be a supreme gouernour in causes ecclesiastical.
To confirme this minor, for a woman, he alleageth that she can not be admitted to preache the woorde of God, remit sinnes, nor baptize orderly and solemnely, nor administer the Lordes Supper, bothe for the imbecillitie of hir kinde, and for Saint Paules prohibition of teaching in the Church.
For a chyld, he lykewise can not do the same things, as well for defect of iudgement in his nonage, as for Sainte Paules witnesse that he differs not from a seruant.
But the Churches vse is not for seruantes, to doe these things: and so, not for children to do them.
Here for confirmation of his minor, master Sanders russ to his false former principle: that if the woman the chyld be supreme gouernors in these things, then muste they be able themselues to do these things.
But they cannot do these thinges themselues: Ergo, they can haue no supreme gouernme~t in them.
But this reason is alreadie taken away, and therfore al this argume~t falles.
We graunt it is true that neither women, nor children can do these things.
And therfore the Papistes are to blame that suffer women to bapatize, and to saye or sing in theyr quyres theyr ordinarie seruice, and reade the Lessons.
Wee graunte them also, that no men neyther, but suche as bée lawfully called therevnto, maye themselues exercise and do these things: but doth this fellow they may not therfore haue a gouernment ouer those that doo them in their orderly doing of them? if this were true, then take away all their gouernement ouer all lay persons, and all ciuil causes too.
For neyther women can nor ought them selues to do all that men béeing their subiects can and ought to doo.
Will ye haue a woman weare a mans apparell? it is flat forbidden by Gods worde.
Will ye haue a Quéene fight hir self in a battaile, and breake a speare as a king may do? In déed some mannish women as the Quéene of Amazons, Thomyris, Semiramis and other haue so doone, but it is not sitting.
And by your owne reason, the imbecillitie of theyr kynde doth cléere them.
And a number of such other things may be reckoned vp.
Shall we now saye, the Quéene is not supreme gouernour ouer these persons and causes, bicause hir selfe can not doe them.
Likewyse for a king that is a chylde, you know he can not fight in battell himselfe, neyther can he himselfe sit in iudgement, and debate rights and wrongs in ciuil doubtes, manie mo things can he himselfe not doe, euen bicause as ye say, he hath a defect in iudgeme~t.
Hath he therfore in these ciuill and temporall thyngs no supreme gouernment? Thus ye sée still your examples faile, yea they make cleane agaynst you: for as a supreme gouernor may wel be a supreme gouernor, in those things that he himself can not do: so a christe~ princes supreme gouernme~t ouer al ecclesiastical persons, in al ecclesiastical causes, is nowhit hindred, although the prince, he or she, yong or old, can not do the functions ecclesiastical, nor be an ecclesiast. person.
The second argument is, (that he so often, and al the Papists vse) of the excellencie of the minister in his ministration aboue the Prince.
To this he citeth the saying of Saint Paule: Let men esteeme vs as ministers of Christ, and dispensers of his mysteries.
And here is againe alledged the storie of ziae, that presumed to offer incense, and was punished with eaprie.
The effect of all the argument he knitteth vp thus: Siergo minister.
If therfore the minister of the Church of Christ, exercise a greater and more diuine ministerie than the king, or any other prince: howe is the king the Supreme heade of that churche, wherein he seeth certaine ministers greater than himselfe? answere, this is a fallation, secundum quid ad simpliciter.
We graunt, in the respect of his ministerie, the minister is aboue all Princes.
But this pertayneth to the actions and function of the minister, and not to the ouersight and direction, that all those actions and functions be orderly done.
Nowe this béeing but a common argument, Master Saunders vrgeth it further by comparison of eyther estate, the Prince and the Priest, from the olde Testament, to the newe, saying: Ac nimirum illud. &c.
And thys namely seeme to take by my right, the authoritie of any Christian king in his christian kingdom, is not greater than was in tymes paste the authoritie of any Iewishe kyng among the people of the Iewes, for if the Citie of God to whyche Chryste of his owne name, hathe giuen a newe name, maye verily bee the more woorthie, but can not be inferiour to the Churche of the Iewes· Surely then it followeth, that a christian king ouer his christian kingdome, can not obtaine more power than a kyng of the Hebrue nation did obteyne among the Hebrwes.
For howe muche the more any Common weale is subiecte too their earthly Kyng, the authoritie of that common weae is so muche the lesse.
But the authoritie of the Churche of Christe is not lesse than the authoritie of the Synagoge of the Iewes, bycause in the churche of Christe those thinges were fulfilled to the verie image of the things, whiche in the Synagoge of the Iewes were scarce figured by the naked shadowes.
As the truthe in deede in greater than the image, so againe, the image is greater than the shadowe: but this is euident, that the authoritie in times past of the only king, is lesser than the authoritie of his christian kingdome, or of hys Bishops.
But if it be so, then the christian king, which is both lesse than the church, and the bishops of his kingdom, cannot be immediatly vnder Christ, the head of the churche.
This argument is intricate, and full of many inuersed cringle crangles, to shewe a face of déepe and subtill knowledge, beyonde the simple mans capacitie: whyche kynd of reasonyng, is more suspicious than to edifying.
The effecte of the argument standeth all on this: The greater authoritie is giuen to a christian king, the lesser haue the Priestes and the churche.
But the priestes and the churche haue not lesse authoritie, but aboue a christian king.
To the Maior, that the greater authoritie is giuen to a christian king, the lesser haue the priests and the churche: he sayeth nothing.
And yet some what is to be sayde thereto, it is not so cléere as he makes it.
For sith eyther of these thrée, haue their authorities in dyuers considerations: the Priests authoritie may be greater than the kings authoritie in one respecte, that is, of his diuine actions and ministerie: and yet in an other, of the gouernement and publike direction, the kinges authoritie is greater than his.
And so, althoughe the Churches authoritie in one respecte, be greater than bothe the Kings and the Priestes, as they are bothe but membres and children of the Churche: yet in regarde that the one is a Pastour, and the other a gouernour, and both of them Fathers and guyders as it were vnto the church, their authorities againe are greater than the Churches.
And this also sheweth the falshood of the Minor, that the Priestes and the Churche haue not lesse authoritie, but are aboue the prince.
Which is not true, but in suche respectes, as nothing hinder the supreme gouernement that we giue the prince.
But Maister Saunders to confirme this to bée simply true, the prince to be inferior to the Priests and people, will proue it by his comparison of the state of the olde and newe Testament.
And first he will haue the state of the olde Testament in the Churches gouernement, to be a figure of the newe.
But in the estate of the old Testament, the Prince was vnder the priest and the people.
To the maior, we graunte him, the gouernment of the Church in the old testament, to be a figure of the churches gouernment in the new testame~t.
And remember this well, that here M. Saunders buyldes vpon.
For if he himselfe shal be found to swarue from it afterwarde, when he findeth it shall make agaynst hym, then let him blame himselfe, and let vs note bothe inconstancie and cantradiction in him, who playeth the snayle, puttyng in and out his hornes, and will say, and eate his worde, as he thinketh best to his aduantage.
And this is the fashions of them all, in the examples of the old testament, as we haue séene the practise of M. Feckenham M. Stapleton, which is a subtile, false, and vnstedfast kind of dealing.
But go to we denie the minor, that in the state of the olde testament, the Prince was otherwise (than in the foresayde respects) inferiour to the Priest and people.
It remaineth (sayth he) that we proue the king of the Hebrue nation, to haue ben lesse than his nation, and his Bishop.
VVho shall bee a better iudge in this cause than euen God himselfe? For he entreating of sacrifices for sinne committed by ignorance, distinguisheth foure sortes of men.
For either the anoynted priest sinneth, or the people, or the Prince, or the priuate person.
Of these foure sortes, the anoynted Prieste helde the firste place, the people of Israell the seconde place, the Prince the third place, the priuate man the last place If the Prieste that is anoynted shall haue sinned, making the people to offende, he shall offer for his sinne, an vnspotted 'Bullocke without blemishe, vnto the Lorde.
But if all the people of Israell shall haue doone of ignorance that whiche is contrarie to the commaundement of the Lorde, and shall afterwarde vnderstande their sinne, the people shall offer a Bullocke for their sinne.
If the Prince shall haue sinned, and among many thinges shall doe ought by ignorance, that is forbidden by the Lawe of the Lorde, and shall afterwarde vnderstande his sinne, he shall offer for an offering to the Lorde, from among the she Goates an he Goate vnspotted.
But if any soule of the people of the lande shall haue sinned through ignorance, hee shall offer a shee Goate vnspotted.
Loe foure sacrifices, whereof the moste worthy is the Bullocke, whiche is offered as well for the Prieste as for all the people.
The hee Goate is but of the nexte worthynesse, the which the King offered.
Therefore, euen as the Prince is prefered before the priuate man, so al the people is preferred before the Prince, but the anoynted Prieste is preferred before them both.
This argument is taken from the Sacrifices for sinnes in the olde Testament, and is nothing pertayning to gouernment, and therfore can infer no necessarie but wrested conclusion therevnto.
Nowe as this matter is nothing to the present purpose: so his argumentes thereon, argue the greater follie, the more nicely he standeth on them.
He driueth the~ to infer a superioritie by two reasons, the one of the more worthy Sacrifice, the other of the order placing the discription of these Sacrifices.
Of the Sacrifice he reasoneth on the more worthy beast, as thus: He that offered the more worthy beast, was the more worthy in authoritie: But the highe Prieste and the people offered a more worthe beaste than dyd the Prince: Ergo, the highe Priest and the people were more worthy in authoritie than the Prince.
The Maior he taketh for graunted, after his manner· The Minor he proueth thus.
Bullocke is a more worthie beast than a Goate, But the highe Priest and the people offered a Bullocke, the Prince but a Goate.
aunswere to this worthy, if not rather beastly argument, made from a Bullocke, as remember once a Papiste sayde in Cambridge of a righte worthie Doctor of hys owne Popishe Church, his name (quoth he) is Doctor Bullocke, but per contractionem, it maye be Doctor Blocke, and so this is a Bullockishe argument, but per contractionem, it is a very blockishe argument, and farre more fitte for Doctour Bullock, tha~ for Doctor Sanders to haue made, except that he be made Bullatus Doctor.
graunt there was great differences to be obserued in the thinges offered, howe beit the worthynesse of the Sacrifice laye not in the things offered, but euery Sacrifice had this or that kynd of matter appointed to be offered, as the wisdome of God thoughte fittest to expresse the nature of that sinne, or propitiation whereof it was a Sacrifice.
Lyon is counted a more worthy beast than a Bullocke, and yet was it counted an vncleane beast.
In the second chapter going before this alledged, God saith of flower and Corne offered, which is not so worthy a thing as is a beast, it is the most holy of the offerings of the Lorde made by fire.
In the thirde Chapter he saithe, if he offer a Lambe for his oblation: and afterwarde he sayth, and if his offerings be a Goate.
But what shall we conclude hereon, for the more worthynesse of the Persons authoritie that offered all these and other more different things? But nowe if a Bullocke be the moste worthy beast, dyd not many Kings many times, offer many Bullockes? Did not also the high Priests offer other things for themselues, besides bullockes? in the.
a bullocke and ram was offered for Aaron and his sonnes, but here the bullocke is still placed before the ram, as a more worthie beast by maister Saunders reason.
But in the ninth chapter he sayth, And in the.
daye Moyses called Aaron and his sonnes, and the elders of Israel, and then he said to Aaron take thee a yong calfe for a sinne offering, and a ram for a burnte offering, both without blemishe, and bring them before the Lorde, and vnto the Children of Israel, saying, take ye an hee Goate for a sinne offering, and a Calfe and a Lambe, both of a yeare olde without blemishe for a burnt offering, also a Bullocke and a ram for a peace offering.
here is a yong calfe preferred before a bullocke, for the Priests sin offering: and a ram before a Calfe, yea, a bullocke and a ram for the people, and but a yong calfe and a ram for the high Priest: and so the people (by this reason) shoulde be more worthie than the high Priest, and equall at the least they are made, euen in this place that M. Saunders so narrowly examineth, for the Priest and the people offer a bullocke both of them.
Now if the dignitie of the beast sacrificed, will not inferre the dignitie of the man offering the sacrifice: yet wil master Saunders enforce his argument furder, from the dignitie of the place, in the order of naming eche persons sacrifyce, as thus: He that is former placed, is former in dignitie, and hee that is placed later, is inferior in dignitie.
But the priest annointed held the first place, the people of Israel the second place, the Prince the thirde place, the priuate man the last place.
Ergo, the Prince is inferior in dignitie to the Priest and the people, and onely superior to the priuate man.
answere, this is as meane, if not a worser argumente than the other, from the former place in recitall, to the former place in dignitie.
Maister Saunders owne order of his page duplicate] page duplicate] page duplicate] page duplicate] booke in this selfe same treatise, confuteth himselfe.
In his seconde booke, the Princes authoritie: in his thirde booke, the Priests authoritie: shall wee vgehim herevpon, that he ment to giue the people superior authoritie to Princes, and Princes superior authoritie vnto Priests? he will saye be ment it not, and that he confutes it, neither can we iustlye gather anye argumente of a former authoritie, from a former placing of the persons or theyr names, whiche maye nowe and then bée placed the beste in the laste place, or the best in the middle place, so well as in the firste place, and yet kepe a good and decent order.
And if Maister Saunders may reason thus in hys defence for placing the Priest laste, why will not hys owne answere confute hys owne argument, that here hée maketh of the Priest named in the firste place? These argumentes now being thus weake and childishe to inferre any necessarie conseque~ce of superior authoritie: M. Saunders laboureth to strengthen the~ with the authorities of witnesses.
Althoughe before hande, in so playne a matter, what néede witnesses, or what coulde all the witnesses in the worlde doe, to make these good consequences? not that wée contemne these witnesses, nor yet altogether denye the matter, (as wée haue diuers tymes affyrmed) that the high Priestes office then, and all the Priestes vnder hym, and that all the Bishoppes and Ministers nowe, in respecte of theyr diuine Ministerie of the worde and Sacramentes, are to bée preferred, as hauyng in dignitie a moste highe office before all other persons, and so their office maye well bée placed before the Princes office.
But this, as it nothing hindreth· in other respectes, a superior office of the Prince ouer them: so to enforce the dignitie of the Priestes office by these blde reasons, is rather to blemishe it and bring it in contempte.
VVherevpon Philo that of these matters (as one that was a Iewe) was of necessitie moste cunning: it was fit (sayth he) that the Prince bee preferred before the priuate man, yea euen in the Sacrifice, as likewise the people before the Prince, syth the whole is greater than parte thereof.
But the Bishop to bee made equall to the people, in taking awaye and obtayning pardon of sinnes.
But this honour is counted to the Bishop not for hym selfe, but bicause he is the Minister of the people, making the vowes and prayers publikly to be performed in the name of all the nation· The firste witnesse here is Philo Iudeus, of whome sée no necessitie Maister Saunders that he shoulde bée moste cunning in these matters, neyther thinke that he was most cunning in them, althoughe that he were a Iewe, and a notable learned man.
And yet herein, exception might be made against him, being rather a well liker of our Christian Religion than a professor of it, or one that sheweth to haue anye great cunning in it.
Writing so manye bookes little or nothing of our Christian fayth: saue in his booke de vita theoretica, where he commendes it, and calleth it Diuinam Philosophiam, diuine Philosophie, and saythe among other commendations of the Christians (as thoughe himselfe were none) habent autem etiam disputationes quasdam et interpretationes veterum viro rum, qui et authores ipsius [undefined span alphabet] extiterunt.
But they haue also certaine dsiputations and interpretations of auncient men, who were also the authours of that heresie or secte, whereby Philo writing on this wise of the Christia~s howe euer he fauoured them, thinke hée was not the cunningest in our Religion.
Neither doe you ascribe that vnto hym, but saye he was most cunning in these matters, meaning these Iewish Sacrifices.
But and he were not cunning in the faith of Christ, he could not haue verie muche cunning in those sacrifices, that were all referred to Christ.
But was not that cunning that he had too muche? driuing all the mysteries in gods word, to Cabalistical Platonical numbers and figures, to allegoricall and morall senses, being himself so great a Platonie, that it grewe to a prouerbe, [undefined span alphabet], either Plato imitateth Philo, or Philo imitateth Plato, so that, in cunning allegori he was cunning, and yet not so cunning as Origen, who likeneth herein the priest to the sense of godlynesse and Religion, and the Prince vnto the force of reason.
But into what errors he ran by these conceits, is manifest, although he were a farre more cunning Christian, than it should appeare that euer Philo was.
speake not this in their dispraise, or altogether to reiecte their allegories, which may be admitted so farre forth, as they be sober and godly, and not contrarie to the plaine texte, although they differ from the simple meaning of it.
But althoughe they may delight and edisie, they proue nothing of necessitie, therefore are not to be brought in controuersies, whosoeur the authors be, the writers of the holy Scripture onely excepted.
But let vs admit Philoes allegorie, what are you (Maister Saunders) therby, eue~ one whit the nerer of your purpose, if not the furder from it? the Prince is here affirmed to be inferior to all the people.
Howbeit, not simply inferior: but as he is a parte of the whole, and a particular member of the body politike: if ye stretch this so generally, that he hath not againe a superiour power, not onely ouer euery other part, but also ouer all the parts: ye may quickly make a madde politike body· If ye loke but of your owne example of a natural body (so often cited) do ye not say the head rules all the body? and what say you by your owne head, maister Saunders? it séemeth by the heade strong opinion of these your reasons, that it rules all your bodye to muche oute of square.
Although it be but one part of you, yet hath it the supreme gouernement of all your partes.
But now what maketh it for the superioritie of the B. or rather maketh it it not inferior, withall marreth al your first booke against the authoritie of the people? Philo sayth not that the B. is aboue the people, but the B. is made equall to the people, as who should say, of himself being but a man, he is not equall, but inferior, but is made equall to the~, being made a Prince.
Now, if the Prince haue a supreme gouernment of all the people, for al that he is but a man and a particular member, being a parte vnder the whole, as likewise is the B. and so vnder the people to: yet as this man is aboue all the people, in regarde that he is made a Prince, so is he aboue the B. to, that also of a priuate man is made a B. whereby (as Philo saythe) he is made but equall to the people, whereas the Prince is made aboue the people.
How answere ye herein to Philo Maister Saunders? Howbeit (say you) that he saith the may be made equall to the people, this in deede is to bee vnderstoode, to haue so come to passe in the thing offred, for both offred a Bullocke.
Why M. Saunders, and did ye not before in your Bullockishe reason, make the thing offred, to be an argument of the authoritie of the offerer? the better thing offered, to argue the better authoritie in the offerer, the worser thing the worser authoritie? and why then not (by the like reason) the like thing to proue the like authoritie? But ye wrests your author Philo.
He saith not they are equall in re immolata in the thing offred: for that the text saith plaine ynough, but he saith: the B. was made equall to them in the explation and obtaining forgiuenesse of sinnes.
Wherein he sheweth in déede the proper meaning of God, in ordayning these things to be offered, not to distiguishe thereby the difference of authorities in the persons offering, but rather to shewe the difference of their sinnes, and the obtaining pardon for the~.
Of which difference of sinnes and the difference of the offerings for them, the.
Now bicause the sinnes of the Priest (although one by ignora~ce, which is a harder case in a Priest than any other, bicause his title professeth skil and learning giue greater offence than the sinnes of other, therefore the Priests sinnes are reckoned first, as an original from whose offence, other mens offences spring.
And so saith the texte, if the annoynted Priest shall sinne making the people to offend, for bycause (sayth Lira your owne commentar) the sinne of the Priest is occasion of sinning to the people.
Where to he alledgeth Gregorie, when the pastor goeth by the broke~ ches it fals oute that the flocke followeth to their hedong downefall.
What is this firste place nowe Maister Saunders to argue the Priests authoritie and worthinesse, or rather his infirmitie and vnworthinesse? Neither is the thing offred by the Priest appoynted to be a bullocke, to declare anye authoritie in him: but (as Lyra saith) a Bullocke or a Calfe, in remembraunce of the molten calfe or bullock which Aaron erected Exod.
What is this againe for his authoritie? but rather to lay his shame before him, that as the beast was slaine, so he deserued to be slaine, for offending by the like beast.
And so referring the sacrifice of the beast to Christs sacrifice, that as the innocent beaste was slaine, so the innocent Messias should be slaine, the Sacrifice wherof (thus prefigured in the beast, offered and beleued in the person offring) should turne the deserued slaughter from him, and be the propitiation for his sinnes.
And bicause all the peoples sinnes, are great, and the greater the greater multitude, for the commonnesse of the error in an vniuersall ignorance, as in the Popishe Church, lesseneth not the error but makes it greater: (although they defende that the Churche can haue no vniuersall ignorance or common error, contrarie to this manifest texte of scripture) yet bicause it sprang of the Priests, that coulde not pretend ignoraunce so well as the people mighte, therefore the peoples sinne is placed nexte after the Priestes, and is called a sinne of ignoraunce, whiche was not sayde of the Priestes sinne.
all the people of the sonnes of Israell (sayth the text) shall be ignoraunt, and for lacke of knowledge, doe any thing that is contrarie to the co~maundement of the Lord.
On which words the glosse interlineth, of ignorance not of knowledge as the Priestes, wherevpon Peter saith knowe ye did it by ignoraunce, but the priestes sinned of knowledge, seyng all things fore tolde in the scriptures, and therefore sinned more heighnously.
But yet bicause the peoples offence was in the same thing that Aarons was, therefore the people also offered a Calfe or Bullocke, in remembrance (sayth Lyra) of the molten Calfe wherein the people sinned Exodus.
and hereto he citeth Hesichius: manifestum. &c. it is manifest that he meaneth the sinne of the people and the Priest to bee all one, and therefore in bothe of them he ordayned the same sacrifice.
And here withall were to be noted (if the order were note worthie) that he placeth the people before the Priest, euen where ye text placeth the Priest before the people.
And therefore neither Lira, Hesichius, nor the Popishe Glosse were so precise in the order, as Maister Saunders is.
But what makes it matter whether he name the Priest before the people or the people, before the Priest? what hath either Priest or people here to boast of dignitie? but rather bée ashamed of their greater sinnes, the more they are placed one before an other.
And these causes (had Philo bene of necessitie so cunning in these matters, as Maister Saunders sayth he was) he woulde haue alledged.
Yea, had hée béen no cunninger herein, than euen ye necessarie vnderstanding of the place enforceth, he woulde not haue wrested it to superioritie.
Howbeit all Maister Saunders cunning, can not make Philo to serue his purpose, although he would neuer so faine wreste and wring him to it.
For althoughe Philo vncunningly wreste it vnto dignitie, yet that dignitie that he maketh the Priest to haue, is but equall to the peoples dignitie, and yet not for his owne sake neyther, but bicause he is the peoples minister.
Whiche Maister Saunders foreséeyng, wée woulde obiecte, hée preuenteth vs saying: But thou wilt say that Philo addeth, that that honour is yelded to the B. not for him selfe but bicause he is the Minister of the people.
graunt it is so, neither was Philo deceiued in that, that he iudged the B. to be the peoples minister, but that which was was not reuealed to Philo being a Iewe, we Christians oughte not to be ignorant of it, to wit, that he was not onely the peoples minister, but also gods minister and moreouer the figure of Christ.
In graunting this M. Saunders, ye graunt also contraries to your owne tale.
Before, Philo was of necessitie most cunning in these matters while ye thought his cunning woulde make for the Priests aduancement.
Put now that his cunning makes against the Priests aduancement· and maketh the B. but equall to the people, nowe Philo is not cunning in these matters, now Philo is a Iewe and no Christia~, now it was not reuealed vnto him, that the high Priest was gods minister, or a figure of Christe.
Cunning is a faire thing sée, and surely you haue great cunning (M. Sau~ders) in these matters, that can handle them so cunningly, one priest for an other Priests preferment.
But will euery man (maister Saunders) count this cunning, that is so broade before, and so extreme on either parte, that right nowe Philo was not onely cunning but most cunning in these matters, and now on a sodaine he is so farre from cunning in them, that he toke not the high Priest to be gods minister.
This was a verye grosse opinion for so learned a man, and declareth that he is lepte from moste cunning to no cunning at all.
Thinke ye Philo knew not thus much, Maister Saunders? verely thinke yt he was a great deale cunninger the~ so, and that hée was fully persuaded Aaron the high Priest was gods minister.
But to inferre such a superioritie on the word ministerie, as debarreth the Princes supremacie, (which you would doe) take that Philo was not halfe so cunning.
But what cunning soeuer Philo had: we Christians ye saye ought not to be ignorant of it (to wit) that he was not only the peoples Minister, but also gods Minister, and moreouer the figure of Christ.
For this also is signified, when he is not onely called Priest, but [undefined span alphabet], that is, the annoynted priest.
For Christ being named of annoynting, would haue his ministers called annoynted.
VVherevpon is spoken that of Dauid, touche not mine annoynted.
For if Moyses, as the seruaunt in the house of God, that is, in the Iewishe people, were faithfull in the witnesse of those things that were to bee spoken: truely sith the other Priests descending from the stocke of Aaron, kepte the lawe of Moyses, euen they also were seruauntes in the house of God and of Christ, to witnesse those things that were to be spoken.
But they were seruauntes not onely of the people, but muche more of Christ.
VVhereupon God sayth to Moyses: the Leuites are mine, am the Lorde, and vnto Ieremie, will multiplie the seede of Dauid my seruaunte and the Leuites my Ministers.
Who denyeth that the Leuites and Priests were gods Ministers, and his seruauntes, and his annoynted? wée are not ignoraunte, (thankes be to God) of this, althoughe many of them were ignoraunt of this their office and dutie, and your selfe shewe no small ignoraunce, to tell vs that he would haue his ministers called annoynted, bycause his name [undefined span alphabet] signifyeth annoynted.
As though Christ were annoynted with suche externall oyntment, as Aaron and the high Priests were: or as though Christes Ministers shoulde be annoynted with such externall oyntment: or as though the Popishe Priests greasie annoynting, were deriued of Christes annoynting, which was onely spirituall, Oleo letitiae prae consortibus, with the oyle of gladnesse aboue his fellowes, or as thoughe the ministers of Christ were onely Christians, and were onely annoynted with this spirituall oile of the comforter, and not al true Christians, that are members of Christ, of whome they take this name: or as though any of these things, the faythfull seruice and the externall annoynting then of ye Priests, and the spirituall annointing now of all Christians, hynder the Princes superioritie.
These are such things M, Saunders, that where ye say, we ought not to be ignorant that the high priest was Christs Minister then, you that professe to be much more his Ministers now, ought to be ashamed that ye are so ignorant of them.
And sée againe how in this impertinent vaunting of your selues, ye shew in your last sentence cited, the follie of your former argument, on the order of placing the name, to infer the greater authoritie.
Is not here the sede of Dauid, that is, the royall stocke, placed before the Leuites, euen where he calleth them his ministers? And thus Maister Saunders vnawares hath mard his former argument.
But still he procéedeth saying: Euen as therfore the Bishops in that they vvere ministers of the Synagog, ought to haue been lesse tha the people to who~ they ministred, so in that they vvere the ministers of Christ, and of him placed ouer the Synagog, they vvere also greater than the Synagog.
For sith Christ vvas the true Lord as well of the Synagog as of the Church: it vvas lavvfull for him to do vvith his ovvne, that vvhich seemed good to him, and to make a faithfull seruaunt ouer his house.
Neither onely the Lord himselfe, but also he vvhom the Lord placeth ouer his familie, is greater then the same familie.
No man denieth you (Maister Saunders) that the function of his office is greater.
But as this hindreth not our matter, so these texts furder not yours, although ye wrest ye sayings of the new testament to the olde, to enforce then.
We grau~t ye, the Lord can do vvith his houshold as he vvill.
Put that he vvill doe as you vvill, and as you saye he doth, proue that, and there an ende.
In the meane time, note here againe your owne confession, that the Bishops in that they be ministers to the people, are lesse than the people: which is more than Philo sayde, with whome ye founde fault bicause hée made them equall, which as it declareth in you another contradiction, so it argueth lacke of due consideration euen in the high Prieste dignitie, that ye would so faine extoll, and yet bicause ye can not haue your owne minde, ye pettithely dashe it downe.
For althoughe the Bishop minister to the people, he is not therin their inferior, but rather in dede their superior.
The Prince ministreth to them also, and yet euen in his ministration he is superior to them, and in that they both minister to the people, they are gods ministers both of them.
Yea the Bishop ministreth to the king the worde and sacraments of God, yet is he not therin lesser, but superior to him.
The king againe ministreth to the Bishop the maintenance and direction of him, in ouerseing the Byshoppe doe his duetie, and yet he is not therein lesse than he, but his superior.
VVherefore (saith M. Saunders) the annointed priest (as the minister of Christ) is placed in the first place before the people, vvhile in the meane season the king standes belovv in the third place, nor in the reason of sacrificing, differs muche from the priuate man.
You couet stil the higher place (M. Sau~ders) like a proude Pharisee, and dispise the Prince as though he were a Publican.
But his cause shall be iustified and he exalted, and you shall be brought downe with shame, and goe home condemned.
Yea, your owne mouth hath condemned you already, placing the seede of Dauid before the Leuits and yet ye haue neuer dene with babling of your former placing.
Now when Philo will not serue: to confirme this argumente better, ye runne to Iosephus, who was no more a Christian than was Philo, and had muche lesse cunning in diuinitie than Philo, althoughe a more notable historiographer.
But alacke it is a poore helpe ye haue of him but let vs sée it as it is.
VVherevpon Iosephus hathe lefte thus written vpon the same matters.
The Princes also when they Sacrificed for sinne, doe offer the same things that the common people doe, onely this is the difference that they bring for offering a bull and an hee Goate, by words Iosephus signifies, that priuate men brought a cowe and not a bull, a she goate and nota he goate to offring.
What is this to the purpose Maister Saunders? if the argument be good as you make it, it will make still against your selfe, he that brought to offring, debilius animal minus dignum the weaker beast and leste worthie, is him selfe the lesse worthie.
Were this true, as it is false and foolishe, let vs pray ye viewe what either partie brought to offering.
The Priest brings vitulum, a calfe or yong bullocke, the king brings taurum, a bull.
praye ye nowe, which of these twaine haue brought the weaker and lesse worthie beast? is a calfe in your iudgement stronger than a bull, or a bull weaker than a calfe? surely then ye haue a weake iudgement.
If ye say, a bull is not so muche worthe as a calfe, althoughe then our butchers woulde rather bye bulles of you than calues, yet woulde they deme you but for a calfe in so selling them, and for so telling them.
So that by this rule, the king bringing to offering the stronger and more worthie beast, should be of greater authoritie than the Priest, yea the priuate man also shoulde bée of greater authoritie than the high Priest.
For a cowe althoughe it be not so strong as a bull, yet is she stronger than a calfe, and féedes the calfe and is the calues damme.
If ye say, this is a grosse reasoning for diuine matters, it is so in déede Maister Saunders, and am ashamed suche reasons shoulde be vsed, but are they not your owne? And doe ye not as grossely apply Christs parable of a shepherd and his shéepe? truely knowe not your person Maister Saunders, whether ye be such another forepined ghost as Bishop Boner was, or no, that reasoning of the mysteries of the Lordes supper, compared the sacrament to a good fat Capon.
But these your reasons, for your Popes superioritie, of a bull and a bullocke, of a cow and a calfe, of a strong stalfed and iustie beast, of a leane and weake vnworthie beast, of the first the second and the third place, are not onely more grosse and homely stuffe than Bishop Boners Capon, but a great deale more fonde reason than was his.
Yet will not Maister Saunders giue ouer this reason thus, but alledgeth more authors for it, Theodoretus and Procopius, saying: But Theodoretus vpon the same matter vseth these words.
He teacheth how great the dignitie of the Priesthode is, which he maketh equall to the people.
But the Prince that shall haue transgressed any lawe, he commaundeth him to offer, not a calfe, but an he goate or a goate of a yeare olde: so farre off is he from the Priestly dignitie to whom the bodily gouernment is co~mitted.
Last of all, Procopius Gazeus on the same place writeth thus: Herevpon we may gather· that the Priest is more honorable than the Prince, yea the people to shine in greater dignitie than the Prince.
VVherfore in the olde time certayne Kings adorned themselues with the Priestly dignitie.
If therfore the Prince be as wel inferior to the people as to the Priest, as he that after eyther of them is reckoned vp in the laste place and offers the weake and lesse worthye beast, howe can he be esteemed the head of the Church immediatly vnder Christ, who hath as well the Christian people as the Byshoppes Christes Ministers, betweene him and Christ? How this superioritie eyther of all the Churche, or of the Ministers of Christ, may well consist, and yet hinder not the supremacie of the Prince, beyng in other respectes, both ouer the Ministers and the people: is diuers tymes before declared, and therefore néedlesse to bée repeated, excepte we should followe this vayne of Maister Saunders in repeating so often one thing, and that so meane an argument, that he might rather be ashamed once to haue penned, than thus with these fathers sclender sente~ces to haue bolster it.
And yet he ca~ not driue it to his purpose, for still the priest is made but equall at the moste vnto the people for which M. Saunders shooke of Philo before, as a Iew and no Christian, and here he citeth Christians, yet make they no better for him than Philo did.
But sith the people are again vnder ye prince and the Priest at the most is but equall to the people thow so euer his ministration be the more honorable, yet it argueth that he is vnder the Princes supreme gouernment, so well as are the people.
And therefore for all these argumentes, nothing yet is brought to the contrarie out of the olde testament, that the Bishops (notwithstanding al the excellencie of their diuine ministerie) were not still vnder the supreme gouernement of their Princes.
Let vs now sée and ye haue any better argument.
Besides this without al contradiction the Apostle saith: That which is lesse is blessed of the better.
But Aaron stretching out his hand to the people, blessed the people: therfore Aaron was greater then the people.
This argumente (M. Saunders) is yet more handsome and truer, than you other grosse and wrested argument was, Neither denie we anye partes or the conclusion of it.
For first, it concludeth nothing with or against the Prince, but against the people.
Secondly, it is altogether drawne from the action of the ministers functio~, which we confesse belongeth not to the Prince.
But to conclude simply a superioritie in the person thervpon, were a presumptuous conclusion both against S. Paules meaning, and against God himselfe, to make our selues better tha~ god bicause we blesse him, For we saye to God: Benedicimus tibi, we blesse thee, we praise, &c. all ye workes of the Lord blesse ye the Lord. &c. Ye muste make therfore your distinction of blessing, and shew in what solemne action and signification, the high priest blessed them.
This done, we grau~t you, that the high priest was therin the better, whiche nothing hindreth the Princes supreme gouernement.
But now M. Saunders hauing espied where a king likewise blesseth the people, hath a shift also for this, saying.
But if thou saist, Salomon blessed the Synagog of Israel, and therfore was greater than the synagog: Salomon was greater than the synagog without al contradictio~, for the scripture can not be broken, that saith, the lesser is blessed of the better.
But Salomon sustayned a dubble personage, the one of a king, the other of a Prophete.
But as he was a Prophet, he was the more notable minister of Christ, than for his kingly dignitie, and by this reason was greater than they to whom he prophecied, and so he blessed the people not by his royall, but by his propheticall office.
But the priests, not by an other office, but by the priestly office, blessed both all the people, and much more the king that is inferior to all the people.
Here first let vs note, that M. Sau~ders himselfe twise placeth the king and his office, before the prophet his office.
Salomon (saith he) sustained a duble personage, the one of a king the other of a prophete, and againe he saith, and so he blessed the people, not by the kingly office, but by the propheticall office.
If then his former reason be good, ye king is to be preferred before the Prophet.
But now to his answere to the obiection of Salomo~, which is in déede but a very shift, and the commo~ shift of M. Harding, Dorma~, Stapleto~ and al the residue.
But howsoeuer they dodge out with it, it wil not serue M. Sau~ders at this time.
For although it be true, that Salomon had also the gift of prophesie, yet Salomon did not this as Prophet, but as King.
And in his blessing expressely prayeth for the raigne of his posteritie.
Neither neede M. Saunders run to this shift, for euen Lyra saith: et Benedixit. &c. and he blessed al the congregation, not with that blessing that pertained to the priestly office, but by wishing good things vnto the people, and rendring thanks to God for his good gifts receaued, saying: blessed be the Lord God. &c.
And in the ende of the Chapter, the people blesse him also, but this declareth not their superioritie, although the kings solemne action declares him their better in his royall office, for ye establishing whereof he prayeth.
The like shifte ye make for Moyses and Dauid, that they were also prophetes.
he was in dede Dauids superior, and he had béen among the prophetes too, whereof the prouerbe arose, num et Saul inter Prophetas, is Saule also among the Prophetes? But trow ye he blessed him as a Prophete? and yet in blessing him, although he himselfe were accursed, he foretold the truth, that Dauid shoulde doe great things.
yea he blessed two tribes and a halfe, of Rube~, Gad, and Manasses.
If ye except that he was a prophete too, what say ye to Iehu that blessed Iehonadab, and yet no prophet? to Raguel that blessed Tobias, and yet no prophete? to Ozias the gouernour of Lethulia, and Achior the Ammanite that blessed Iudith, and yet no Prophetes, nor all of them superiors? and therefore this argumente serueth not to inferre gouernement, neither alwayes to inferre superioritie, neither is this shifte alwayes true, that all ye blesse are priests or prophetes.
Althoughe in priests (whome Saint Paule speaketh of) it argue a superioritie of their function, as before is graunted.
But Maister Saunders hauing gotten hold on this word blessing, as though he had founde a newe vaine, procéedeth, saying.
And truely when God had rather haue had his people to haue bene blessed of the priests of the Leuiticall kinde, and of the prophetes, than to haue bene gouerned of a king: yet the people asked a King against the will of God, which petition God in dede permitted to be fulfilled, howbeit he sawe it dyd tend to the contempt of his name: whervpo~ he said to Samuel, they haue not cast thee away but me, that should not raigne ouer them.
For although God raigned ouer his people, euen when the kings gouerned them: yet he had seemed to raigne in better signification and plainer, if the people had obeyed any prophet or priest, or Leuite.
Now that Maister Saunders former proues will fadge no better, he séeketh oute all the wayes he can, to deface the royall estate of a Kyngs authoritie, in comparison of his Priests gouernment.
He sayth God had rather haue had his people ben blessed of the priests and the prophets, tha~ gouerned of kings: dispitefully making these two to be me~braopposita, contraries the one to other.
The gouernment of kings· and the blessing of Priestes and Prophets.
As though the people were berefte of the Priestes and Prophetes blessings bicause not they, but kings did gouerne them.
But if the people had still the Priestes and Prophets blessings, when Kings gouerned them so well as before, then is this opposition no lesse false than malicious.
And that they had stil the Priests and Prophets blessing, is apparant.
But what meanes M. Saunders to name onely their blessings· did the Priestes and Prophetes nought but blesse? would he by so swéete a name reuoke vs to the Popes blessings? but he telleth vs else where that the Pope hath cur· sed vs: and no maruell, for the chiefest parte of his power lyeth in cursing.
But he loueth cursing, and his cursing shall light vpon himselfe, and God dothe turne his cursings into blessings.
But troweth he, the Priests Prophets then, did curse and ban as the Pope dothe nowe, by cause the kings were the supreme gouernours· or that the supreme gouernment belonged first to them, and from them was translated to the Kings? Howbeit M. Saunders sayth not so, but ye the priestes and prophets blessed the people.
But what is that to gouernement? the controuersie is of the priestes gouernement, and the question here is driuen to this, whether God had rather haue hadde the priestes and the prophetes to gouerne the Israelites, than the kings.
Nowe M. Saunders, although this be his onely meaning, dothe not put, nor dare put, the question thus, as in plain speach he ought to do.
For knowing that the state then of the Churches gouernement, was not so much of the priestes and prophetes, as of other ciuil Magistrates called ye Iudges, it had the~ appeared he had said little to his purpose.
But as though all the state before of the kings had ben of the priestes and prophets, he couereth his falsehoode with this fair mantell of the priests and prophets Blessinges, and mentioneth not their gouernemente, whyche is the thing hee shooteth at· Whereas, all that time from Iosue the firste Iudge, to Saule the fyrste King, among so many Iudges, we reade but of one Prieste whiche was Helie, of one Prophete which was Samuel, that gouerned the Church of God And yet these neither gouerned it in respect of priesthood or prophecying, or blessing, but in respecte of that ciuill authoritie whereby they were called Iudges.
Thus that estate that he pretendes maketh the more for him, maketh as much against him as the state of Kings that followed.
For whether God had rather haue had the one or the other, it still proueth God had rather haue had the ciuil Magistrate, were he iudge or king, to be the supreme gouernor, although at that time the supreme gouernment hapned (whiche it seldome dyd) to a person ecclesiasticall.
But God altered this estate, and brought it to Kings.
Neyther dare saye, as Master Saunders very boldly saythe, that God had rather haue had the other estate.
For if he wold, he myght haue kepte it still, Voluntati eius quis resistit, who resisteth his will? but it pleased God the state should bée altered, and so it was.
graunt he was, vnderstanding it not so grossely as Master Saunders séemes to doe, but like a Diuine, so as we admit in God no perturbation nor change of mynde, for God had purposed the chaunge before, and liked well of his forepurpose.
But his displeasure was agaynste the sinne of the people, who distrusting of Gods sufficient helpe in the former estate, inordinately dyd craue a King, and not that hée eyther mislyked the estate of a King, or thoughte it the worsser gouernement: but rather commendeth the gouernement of a King, as an estate so highe, that God hadde reserued that vnto himselfe, and woulde suffer them to haue but Iudges, vntill that they importunately desired to haue a king, béeing such a supreme kynd of gouernement, as they before had onely giuen to God, and nowe they wold needes haue some person among them visibly to haue the same, as other nations had.
And for this cause saithe God to Samuell, they haue not cast away thee, but mee.
And as Samuell vpbrayded them: ye sayde vnto me, not so, but a king shall raygne ouer vs, when the Lorde your God raigned ouer you.
And so witnesseth Lyra, that the estate of a king is the best estate.
But the reason of their sinne was this, Quia deus. &c. Bycause God had chosen the people of Israel to be especial and peculiar to him before all other peoples, according to that is sayde Deut.
The Lord thy God hath chosen thee to bee his peculier people, therefore he would be the immediate king of that people.
VVherefore hee also gaue them a Lawe in Mounte Sinai, by himselfe (that is) by an Angell speaking in his person, and not by man as mediatour.
For whiche purpose, hee woulde that the men whiche were the gouernours of that people, shoulde bee ordeyned immediately from hymselfe, as his Vicars, and not as Kings or Lordes.
As it appeareth in Moses and Iosue, and the Iudges following, of whome is mentioned in the Booke of Iudges, God raysed vp suche or suche a Iudge.
Therefore the Chyldren of Israell dyd contrarie to the ordinaunce of God, desiring a mortall man to be king ouer them, ith the Lord had alwayes retayned this to himselfe, and always gouerned and best protected them, to the peoples profit, so long as they were good subiects: and stil had so done, if the people had stoode in that good subiection to the Lorde.
By these sayings, the firste argument appeareth, that if the gouernement of a king bee the beste gouernemente, it followes that the gouernemente is better, to haue GOD to bee the King immediately, howe muche God is better than man.
And therefore to aske againste this ordinaunce, is not good, but yll.
In these wordes of Lyra, he doth not deminishe the state of a kings authoritie, in comparison of the former estate of the Iudges authoritie aboue, or better than it: but extolles the kings authoritie so far aboue the Iudges authoritie, that God reserued it only to himselfe, so that this high estate of a king ouer Gods people, is not as M. Saunders falsly sayde before from God by other meanes betwene· but immediately from God, and aboue all other representeth him, and long it was ere God woulde suffer any to represent him in this estate, it was so high that God kept it to himselfe, and was offended that his people contented not themselues wyth their other inferior Magistrates, as were the Iudges, which M. Saunders extolles aboue the Kings estate.
The Iudges graunt were as Lyra sayth immediatly from God also, and his Uicars in his Church aboue al others in their times.
And here bycause one or two of them next before this alteration were ecclesiasticall persons, the one a Prieste the other a Prophete, M. Saunders triumpheth· and commends their estate in representing God, to be so high and excellent.
But either he was very rechlesse or wilful blind, that would loke no further in this estate of the Iudges, but to these two when as so many Iudges went before, but he thoughte not beste to thinke on them, bycause they were no priestes nor prophetes.
And yet as Lyra saythe, they were the immediate Vicars of God, and so aboue all the priestes and prophetes at their times, being no ecclesiastical Magistrates.
This argument therefore is false, and all that followes thereon in M. Saunders saying.
For neyther any hauing his right wit did euer doubte, but that the prieste of God dothe more in gouernement expresse and represent his God, whose prieste hee is called, than the king, whose name is rather referred vnto the people that hee ruleth, than to the God vnder whome he is.
This is spoke~ more like an heathen than like a Christian, M. Sanders, that ye priest represe~teth his God whose priest he is called, howbeit think you are not so out of your right wit, but that ye think, dij gntium daemonia sunt, the gods of the gentiles are but diuels.
And that ye thinke there is but one God, and but one sort of those that are is priests.
But how these priests that are of the Popishe stampe, represent God, maye be called in question: if rather it be not out of question, that both their life, their doctrine, and their order, hath no resemblance of him, but rather of Baal and Baceus, rather of Antechrist and Sathan, than of God.
As for their gouernment, least of all dothe represent him.
The Turke raigneth not with suche cruell tyrannie as the Pope and his inquisitors doe. Godly Ministers represent him graunt, and that better than kings, but not in the visible and externall gouernmente, but in the spirituall gouernement of administring Gods worde and sacraments.
God therefore had raigned, if any priest or prophete raigned, but the priest or the prophete being cast off yea euen the gouernement of God, to whome that priest or prophet obeyed, is vnderstood to be cast off.
Speaking thus indefinitely of any priest or prophete that God raigned when they raigned, God was cast off when they were cast off: ye bothe wreste the Scripture, and stretch it to farre, that was onely spoken to Samuell: and also hereby woulde make the state of the Iewes to haue bene then beste, when it was worste.
For when was the state of the Iewes worsse, than in the times mentioned in the bookes of the Machabées? when the euil high priests had gotte~ the ciuil gouernement? and represented God in the gouernemente, (whose priests they beare the name to be) as much as Caiphas and Anna did, that put Christe himselfe to deathe.
But ye say: Moreouer the King would leade the people to Idolatrie, but the high priests and prophetes, sacrificed duely to the Lorde God in the only Temple of Salomon.
Ye shoulde descerne (M. Saunders) betwixt the state and office of the king, and the faultes or personall vices of the king.
For, al kings dyd not lead the people to Idolatrie, some lead the people out of Idolatrie.
Neyther were al the high priests cleare of Idolatrie, no not Aaron the first high priest of al· Did not he lead al the people into foule Idolatrie, and that of a small occasion? But howe is this your saying true, that they Sacrifised duely to God, in the only Temple of Salomon? what? man, ye forget your selfe, howe coulde they Sacrifice only there, duely, or vnduely, before the Temple it selfe was builte, or Salomon was yet borne? and yet there had passed thirtene high Priess from Aaron to Abiathar, or euer the Temple was builte.
And in the meane time, were all the priestes, or the high priestes eyther, cleare from Idolatrie? very muche Idolatrie was vsed before the state of kings among them.
If the priestes hadde then that supreme gouernement, which ye pretende: howe chaunce they let it not, but rather let it alone? which if it were not as yll, was the nexte dore by to leading to Idolatrie.
As for the priestes that were after the Temple was builte, till it was firste destroyed, that is, from Sadocke the highe prieste, vntill Iosedech that was caryed captiue into Babylon, al which time, we haue little mention of the high priestes, for their restrainte or speaking againste Idolatrie.
But we haue many outeries of the prophetes, against Idolaters, yea against the priestes highe and lowe, as abetters to Idolatrie.
And how good soeuer you make them, Ieremie makes them all in his time starke naught, and they agayne went about to procure his death for his laboure.
But as for the highe priestes that followed after the temple was reedified, many of them were euill.
Eliasib the high prieste transgressed the lawe, in ioyning affinitie with the heathen enimie of the Iewes Tobias, and building a lodging for him in the temple, whiche was the defyling of it.
Iohn the high priest killed Iesus his brother in the temple, while they straue ambitiously for the Priesthoode.
After whome Iaddi and Manasses contending for it, when Manasses was chased awaye by Nehemias, for marrying the daughter of the wicked heathen Sanballat: he erected another temple in the Mount Garrizin.
Notiong after, Onias the sonne of Simon was so couetons (as Iosephus saythe) that by denying the tribute payde before, the Temple and all Iury was indanger.
After whome succéeded Iosephus with no lesse bryberie of the heathen Prince, than extortion and pylling of the people.
Next to whome (or as some saye, after Onias) succéeded Iesus or Iason, after muche hurly burly betwixte Simon and Onias, the one appeaching the other to be a Traytor, till this Iason stept in betwene them, and by vnlawfull meanes obtayned to be the high prieste, by giuing a hundreth and sixtie talents of siluer, and eightie talents of rente, and a hundreth and fiftie talentes to sette vp suche exercises among the Iewes, as were among the heathen Grecians, and contrarie to the Lawe of God.
After whome succéeded Menelans, who being sent of Iason to Antiochus, betrayeth Iason.
And offering thrée hundreth talents of siluer more than Iason did, he got the high priesthoode by bryberie to himselfe, bysides that he was a Sacrilegious théefe, and murtherer.
But Menelaus, not paying the excessiue summes, that he promised, was faine to take his héeles and runne away, and left his brother Lysimachus priest in his steade, that for his wickednesse and cruell tyranni, was slaine in a tumulte that he himselfe had raysed.
After whom, partly by reason of these monstrous traitors, partly by reason of the tyrant Antiochus rage and persecution: the temple lay waste, was destroyed these time.
yeares ther was no priest at al, neither better nor orsse to guie
Machabes recouered Hierusale~, whose brother Ionathes, after him Simo~, Simons son Hircanus, were made both Princes high priests also who, althogh they were good me~, yet were they made high Priests by the heathen Monarke, vnder whome they gouerned, and were more like to valiant Captaines (as the necessitie of the tyme was driuen vnto) rather than like to learned priestes or Byshoppes.
In whose time, an other Onias claiming the high Priesthoode, builded in Aegipt a Temple, like to the Temple at Hierusalem to sacrifice in.
And at which time sprang vp the sectes of the Sadues the Pharisies, and the Esseni, when the residue of the high priestes, Aristobulus, Hircanus. &c. fell to knocking one another, partly for the priesthoode, partely for the kingdome, till Herode being a stranger got the kingdome from them.
And they bought and sold the high priesthoode, kept it by courses, being cleane degenerate from the Law of God, except some odde man amongst the rest were iust, as Zacharie the Father of Iohn Baptist, the most part were euill, and waxed worsse and worsse, till they had put Christe to death, and afterwarde destroyed themselues, and all their Countrey too.
And yet see howe impudently M. Saunders vauntes and crakes of the priests, in comparison of the Princes, where the euill Princes hauing led the people (and that through the councell of euill priestes) into Idolatrie and to captiuitie: the high priests led them to the murther of Iesus Christe, to the vtter ouerthrowe of their estate, and to the cleane casting them off from God, saue that we hope some remnant shal be saued.
Iudge now whether of these were worsse, eyther the Priestes or Princes.
But Master Saunders (to shewe himselfe not partiall for his priestes) bringeth forth for witnesse, one that he ascribes this high priesthoode vnto, which is Pope Gregorie, saying: VVherevpon saith Gregorie entreating of this request of a king: worthily complaineth the L. that he is cast off, worthely he graunteth the royal dignitie, being offended.
For truely so greate was the iniquitie of the crauers, that sihe they desired that wherby they should go from God, it might be permitted by the iudgment of God to be forbidden (perchance it would be better read to be allovved or approued) it could not· And againe, for those that liued vnder the spirituall gouernment, to desire a king: vvhat is it else, than to reioyce, to turne the same spirituall prelacie into secular gouernment? This testimonie of Gregorie (Maister Saunders) co~mes a little out of place, belike it shoulde haue béene set before, when ye spoke of Samuels gouernment, of the peoples desiring a king, and of gods offence therewith.
For here thys Vnde Gregorius, vvherevpn Gregorie) hangeth vpon your last matter, of the Priests sacrificing onely in the temple as though it were tyed on with points, howbeit it hanges not so il on the residue, as M. Saunders scarce can make it hang together with it self.
For he not onely correctes the sentence, saying, prohiberi to be prohibited, should better be read probari, or approbari, to be allovved or approued: but also he corrects it with a cleane contrarie exposition.
For, to be prohibited is not to be allovved or approued, and to be allovved or approued, is not to be prohibited.
And so, while he himselfe can not tell what to make of the sentence, and woulde expounde it cleane contrarie: what should we make of it? as for the displeasure of God, wee haue shewed alreadye, by a large and plaine sentence out of Lyra (which is for his life a more cocke sure papist, than eue~ this Pope Gregorie was) ye it was not bicause the kings estate was worse or more inferior than the state of the Iudges was, but bicause the kings estate, being higher, and so high, that God reserued it to himselfe: they distrusted the former estate as inferior, and desired a visible king among them.
So that this, which you wold draw to the dispraise, maketh in deede more to the praise of a kings estate.
Neither do we denie Gregories sentence, in respect of the spirituall prelacie: but the question nowe is of the outwarde gouernment, of Priests or Princes.
Which Gregorie not onely acknowledged with most humble obedience, calling the Emperour, and kings of Italy, his Lords soueraignes, and lowly bowed himselfe vnto them: but also that more is, so much detested the claime that the Pope makes now, that he calleth the vser of it a fore runner of Antichrist.
And where ye haue this shift, that he condemnes such titles of vniuersal Prelacie, in the sea of other Bishoppes, but not of his owne: this is a false shifte, he condemnes it in hys owne Bishopricke of Rome, so well as in anye other.
For where Eulogius the Patriarke of Alexandria had saluted him with suche stiles, he answereth: Ecce in praefatione, &c. Beholde in the preface of the Epistle, the which you directed vnto me, who forbad it, ye thought to set in the word of a proud calling, naming me vniuersall Pope, the which beseeche you that your most curteous holinesse wil no more do so.
Bicause, that which is giue~ to another more tha~ reao~ requireth, is subtracted from your selues.
seeke not to be aduaunced in titles but in maners.
Neither counte that, honour, wherein know my brethren leese their honour.
For my honour is the honour of the vniuersall Churche.
The~ am honored, whe~ to euery particular person, the honor that is due vnto him is not denyed.
For if your holynesse call me vniuersall Pope, he denyeth himselfe to be, in that he calleth me vniuersall, but God forbid this.
Let those wordes goe that puffe vp truth and wounde charitie.
Thus sayth Gregorie, and this is cited euen in your owne decrées, not onely about the word Vniuersall Pope, but vpon these titles, Princeps Sacerdotu~ vel summus sacerdos, the chief of the priests or the chiefe or high priest, or any other such titles.
So farre was this Pope Gregorie then, from the pride of the late Pope Gregories that haue bene since, for he both acknowledged himselfe to be but equall to other Bishoppes, and him selfe and all other Byshops to be vnder their naturall Princes.
The testimonie therefore of Pope Gregorie, is but wrested, to vrge suche superioritie of Byshoppes, as shoulde de their Princes supreme gouernmente.
Now M. Saunders hauing thus as he thinketh fully confyrmed his proues, for ye superioritie of Priests in the olde Testamente abou Kings, gathereth altogether and knites vp hys conclusion, saying: VVherefore sithe the institution of Priests proceeded, from the good wyll of God and from his free mercie: but God graunted not the dignitie of a king but in his anger, at the peoples petition: lesser consideration is worthily had of the king than of the people, both bicause he is made king onely for the peoples cause, and also onely at the peoples petition.
But the Priests, although they be made for the peoples cause, yet neither onely for the peoples cause, but muche more for the honour of Christe.
Neither onelye at the petition of the people were they made, but rather of the free mercie of God, and that for that eternall predestination of God, whiche was ordayned aboute oure saluation, in the tyme appoynted to be brought to effect.
Ye make your comparison and your conclusion hang illoredly together Maister Saunders, your comparison is of the Princes and the Priests estate: and ye conclude, that therefore lesse consideration is worthily to be had of the king than of the people.
How chaunce ye say not of the king than, of the Priests? but belike ye thoughte that that was oute of controuersie: the Priests were so farre aboue the people, that much lesse consideration is to be had of the people than of the priests.
But maister Saunders, your beast sacrificed said not so, nor your authors Philo and Iosephus: but sayde, he was made equall to the people.
But say you, the king was made for the peoples cause.
graunt ye maister Saunders, and was not the priest so too? yea doe not your selfe say, he was made for the peoples cause also? if this then argue an inferiorship (as in déede it doth) in respecte of the ende: doth it not argue the priest to be inferior too, and lesser consideration to be had of him than of the people, that is to say, of the Church of God? But saye you, the King vvas made onely for the peoples cause, and the priest was made for the honor of Christ also, for the eternall predestination of God, vvhich vvas ordained about saluation, in time appoynted to be broughte to effect: And pray ye Maister Saunders, was not this another cause of making the King also? dyd not his estate make to the honour of Christe, and represent Christ, so well as the Priestes estate? was not he called Christus Domini, The Lordes annoynted, so well as the Priest? yea and better to then, by your leaue.
For Christ was not onely figured in the kings estate, so well as in the Priests: but also toke his humanitie of the race of the kings, and not of the Priests, and so is called the sonne of Dauid, not the sonne of Aaron, the king of the Ievves, not the priest of the Ievves And though in respect of his priesthoode, he was the onely sacrifice of our redemption, whereby our sinnes are taken away, Christus mortuus est pro peccatis nostris, Christ dyed for our sinnes: yet notwithstanding, resurrexit pro iustificatione nostra, he rose for ou ustification, by his kingdome, by his power, by his victorie, by his resurrection, by his ascention, by his sitting at ye right hand of his father, in al which, his kingdome is contained, so that it comprehendeth both our Predestinatio~, and our saluation too.
And therefore, we are taught by Christ to saye, let thy kingdome come, and not, let thy priesthoode come.
And not onely all our estate in this life, and the life to come, but all the grace, and mercie, and iustice, and power, and glory of God is attributed, not so muche to the priesthoode, as to the kingdome of Christ.
But ye saye God was angrie with the peoples request when he made the kings estate.
graunt you Maister Saunders, and tolde ye the reason before out of Lyra, and the texte is plaine, bicause God him selfe was king vnto them, which doth not abase, but so much the more aduaunce it.
But now when Maister Saunders hath thus extolled the Priests gouernme~t of the old Testame~t, he abaseth the~ again by comparison of Bishops of the newe Testament, saying.
Sith therefore the Bishops of the Churche of Christ are of no lesse dignitie than vvere in times past the Leuitical priests, yea rather sith the Apostle, treating of the Ministers of the nevve Testament, conferring them with the olde Leuites, sayth, that they ministred death, and the letter that killed, but these minister the spirit which quickneth, and righteousnesse and therfore the ministers of the nevve Testament are more vvorthie than the olde Leuites, vvhat maner of king shal vve thinke him to bee, vvhiche contemning the ministers of the nevve Testamente, calleth himselfe the supreme head of his Christian kingdome, and that immediatly vnder Christ? This comparison (Maister Saunders) of the ministers of the olde and nevve Testament rightly vnderstood, wée acknowledge.
The nevve is more vvorthy than the olde, but the vvorthinesse and glory of the nevv ministration that saint Paule speakes on, is spirituall and not outvvard glory.
For although the ministers of the olde Testament had outwarde glory, and some of them by especiall calling, had the visible, supreme and ciuill gouernement, although seldome: yet the ministers of the nue testament are by Christ (as your owne selfe haue confessed) flatly forbidden it, Vos autem non sic, but you shall not be so.
And therefore, where ye woulde haue them of no lesse dignitie (meaning of outvvard glory and gouernment, or else your example holdes not) they are of farre lesse dignitie therein, notwithstanding in a spirituall and invvarde glory, they are againe of a farre greater dignitie than the olde.
Which spirituall dignitie, if any King shoulde contemne? you might then well demaunde, vvhat maner of king he were: and we woulde answere you, hée were a wicked King but as these are two distinct dignities, the spirituall dignitie of the minister, and the visible supremacie of the King, so may they be, and are with vs, well and godly vsed both of them.
Where, both the Prince hath the outward dignitie of supreme head or gouernour vnder Christ: and yet the ministers spirituall dignitie is not onely no whit contemned, but hath his honor yelded due vnto him.
For if he acknowledge not the Ministers of Christe ouer him, he can not be blessed of them.
VVherevpon, neither can he be pertaker of the sanctifying spirite, whose ministers they are.
We graunt (Maister Saunders) that the Prince humbly receiueth their blessing, and is partaker of the holy spirite of God, whose ministers they are in these actions.
Wherein the Prince acknowledgeth them to represent God, and is vnder them.
But what hindreth this, that in other respectes, they againe are vnder him, and he their supreme gouernour? but Maister Saunders procéedeth saying: Dauid cryeth: and nowe ye kings vnderstande, and be ye learned ye that iudge the earth, apprehend discipline, least the Lorde waxe wroth, and ye perishe oute of the right waye.
But if kings must be learned, then so farre forth, they must be vnder.
For he that is learned, is learned of some maister, and is scholler to him of whome he is learned, the disciple is not aboue his maister, but in that thing that he learneth of his maister, of necessitie he is inferior.
That kings ought to be learned we gladly confesse, and are glad that you confesse it, althoughe againste your wylls, for ye would rather haue them altogither vnlearned, whom ye haue so long detained in blindnesse.
But why woulde ye haue them nowe learned? forsothe, bicause you would onely be their maisters, and so they shoulde be still your vnderlings, not onely in learning suche ill lessons as you woulde teache them, but vnder pretence of teachers, to be their gouernours too.
True it is, in that the teacher teacheth, he is aboue, and in that the learner learneth he is vnder. ut the teacher is not aboue, nor the learner vnder, in other things.
Thoughe Moyses learned of Iethro, yet in gouernement Moyses was aboue him.
Thoughe Dauid learned of Nathan, yet in gouernement he was aboue him.
Thoughe Ozias learned of Iudith, yet in gouernement he was aboue hir.
And so all princes that are taughte of their schole maisters, their scholemaister maye be the better in learning, but he is the worser in authoritie.
And thoughe he be the maister in knowledge, yet he makes euen his knowledge wherby he is maister, to serue the Prince also.
Yea although the Prince be not his maister in learning, yet in all causes of learning, the Prince hath a generall supreme gouernement, to sée by his lawes euery kinde of learning maintayned in his order, to forbid naughtie artes to be learned: to appoint such suche an order methode to be taught or learned, as learned men enforme him, is good and easie to the attaining of learning: to appaynt scholes and learned scholemaisters for learning: and to giue them lawes, statutes, and stipendes, for the maintenance of learning: all this may the Prince doe by his supreme authoritie, ouer all learned persons, and in all causes of learning, althoughe he himselfe be altogether vnlearned, and can not one letter on the booke.
Althoughe woulde to God all Princes were learned, not as the Papistes woulde haue them, but as Dauid, was and exhorteth all Princes to bée.
And thus, as thys sentence makes nothing in the worlde for him, so hys example thereon makes verye muche againste him.
But for all thys argumente be thus simple, he wyll lode vs with further proues, saying.
Sithe therefore it is sayde to the Apostles: Go teache ye all nations, and sith vnder the names of nations, the kings of them are comprehended: and Byshops and Priests haue succeeded the Apostles in the office of teaching: truely in the offyce of teachyng the Byshoppe is greater than his king: so farre is it off, that the king can be the Bishops hed in all things causes.
VVhich title notwithstanding is not onely of these men giuen to a king, but also by publique decree of late in Englande, giun vnto a Queene.
To reason fro~ teaching to gouerning, is no good teaching M. Sau~ders.
If ye teach this doctrine, the~ your Pope should haue little gouernment, for God wot he teacheth little, being often times vnlearned, and alwayes to proud to teache.
If ye say he teacheth by others: so ca~ a prince too.
And though he could himselfe teache, and would also teach the truth, and not suppresse it: yet sith ye say, he succedes the Apostles but in the office of teaching, he is no furder superior than he teacheth, by your owne reckoning.
Neither would this superioritie be denyed him, of any that he ought to teache, if he in dde succeded the Apostles.
But if the succession of the Apostles consist in teaching as here ye confesse: then hath not the Pope to crake muche of succeeding Peter and Paule, that teacheth not as Peter and Paule did, as woulde to God he did and all priests or Bishops else.
Whiche if they did and taught truely, this woulde augment and not diminishe the Princes supreme authoritie, yea and the Quéenes too, Maister Saunders, for in gouernement before ye made a King Quéene alone.
Esai foretolde that kings shoulde bee the nourishers of the Church of Christe, and casting dovvne their countenance to the earth shall vvorship hir, and streight he adioyneth: thou shalt knovv that am the Lord, for this verely is the signe that the Lord raigneth in vs, if vve yelde so much vnto his church, that the Ministers of Christe are greater than any King or Queene.
As this sentence is placed both withoute all order and coherencie: so the reason is very sclender, and standes on this, that the Priests are the Churche that Esai here speakes on, which as it is appara~t false, so it is not to this purpose.
For, the supreme gouernment of a godly Prince, giueth not onely an honour to the Churche, but to the Priests also, and yet his supremacie safe.
But sée how this sentence hits him, as the rest.
For, if kings and Quéenes be likened to Nourses, and Nourses haue charge not onely of féeding, but also of gouerning: then do Kings Quéenes both féede the Church, although not by teching, yet by causing the truth to be taught, and gouerne the Church also.
And if by the Church is chiefly ment the priestes, then the same kind of Princes feeding and gouerning like to Nourses, stretcheth to priestes also, and so the similitude makes against him.
His other argument, of dispensing Gods mysteries and Sacramentes to the king, is diuers times alreadie aunswered vnto, and therefore as superfluous passe it ouer.
And thus farre for his argumentes of his Priestes superioritie.
Nowe secondly to the reasons he sheweth why he thinkes vs deceyued.
But thus in this case deceiueth many, that they see the king is a Christian and gouerneth Christians.
For they knowe not, or at least will not know, what difference it is, whether a man goueren a Christian, bycause hee is a man, or bycause hee is a Christian.
The king indeed gouerneth Christian men, but not bycause they are Christians, but bycause they are men.
And bycause the Byshoppes also themselues are men, the kings also in part are aboue Byshops.
The which hereby goeth cleare away, if wee consider Christian kings, not onely to gouerne Christian men, but euen alike oftentimes Iewes, now and then Moores and Tartars, for this onely that they are kings.
But Byshops gouerne Christians, so as they can gouerne no other, as they are Byshoppes.
Sith therefore the gouernement of the king pertaineth to all men alike, but Byshops principalitie is reached to onely Christians: and sith the state of our Christianitie excelleth the humaine nature that is in vs, with what sence is he endued, that preerreth the gouernoure of our bodily and fleshely nature, before the prieste that watcheth for our soules, and that either loseth our sinnes, if wee make worthie fruites of repentance, or bindeth them, if we beare about an impenitent heart? For the Ministers binding and loosing, is an other question.
Let vs nowe kepe vs to this, of the Princes supreme gouernment.
We are deceyued (you say) for lacke of considering this difference, that the king. gouerneth Christians, not as Christians, but as men and we thinke you ar deceyued your selfe, M. Saunders, and would others for not considering this difference in the king him selfe, in who~ we ought to consider, not onely that he is a king but also a Christian king.
In that he is a king he geuerneth a his subjects (as ye say) a like, (so farre as the likenesse, or of their sates will permit) whether they be Christian, Iewes, Turkes, Mores, aitars, Ethniks or whatsoeuer religio~ they be of, not in respecte of their religions, nor in ye they are neither, but in respect they are his
For, ther are other men also that are none of his subjectes. ra euery man in that he is a man, is no subiect to another man, but frée.
Neither in that he is a christian. (to speake preperly of the abstracte) he is vnder any other than Christe, in whom there is no difference of countrey, state, degrée, or person, as your selfe afterwarde co~fesse in the
How· beit, as the king himselfe is of the Christian religion, and a Christian king of a christian kingdome (as al kings kingdomes ought to be, although they be not:) so hath he an other charge and gouernement of his christian subiectes farre aboue that they be naturall men, or this or that cru~trey me~, euen that they be christians committed to his gouernment.
And therefore this charge was giuen the king of Gods people, in his institution Dute.
That he should haue Gods worde alwayes with him, and make religion the chiefe end of his gouernement.
And this your selfe haue graunted alreadie. pag. excepte ye will contrary your selfe, as ye often doe.
But this case is too apparant, that a christian Prince regardeth further than the body, or than the naturall or polytike man.
For being a christian Prince, he regardeth them as christian subiectes, and not alike to such subiectes as are Heathen, Turkes, and Tartars, which is a shameful sclander.
For as the christian Prince hath a speciall regarde to his christian subiectes, before his Infidell subiects: so they being subiects of vnlike condition, he gouerns them nothing a like.
The one being out of the houshold of fayth, although in the housholde of his kingdome: The other being of bothe the housholdes, and therefore the faythfull Prince hath fuller authoritie ouer them, as wel for the religion of their soules, as for their goodes and bodies.
But (saye you) the Byshoppe bath respecte only to the soule.
But doth this hinder the Princes superioriue, that hath respect to soule and bodie too? The argumentes of Constantine, Theodosius, and Constantius, are somewhat touched alreadie, and reserue the further handling of the~, to the practise and treatise of the stories.
part of this chapter is a dissuasio~ from the Princes supreme gouernment, by the successe thereof.
Wherin first he begins with the most famous Prince King Henrie the.
the Queenes Matesties father, the noblest and moste fortunate king, that euer bare crowne in England.
now when his soule is crouned in the kingdome of heauen with eternal glorie, his body with honor interred in his Sepulcher, his immortal fame yet fresh liuing, in the memorie mouthes of al nations: sée these spitefull Papistes will leaue off, with more than villanous reproches, moste traiterously to rayle vpo~ him.
Saying, that he first called himself the Chief head of the Church of England Ireland immediately vnder Christ, Besides that, he was neuer the happier, but much more vnhappie.
The cou~terfeting of the money, and the pilling of his subiects. wicked Papistes, past all shame and grace.
Howe truely dyd the Apostle Iude prophecie of you, that ulers, and blaspheme hem that authoritie.
Was King Henrie the eight a pyller of his subiecte· vnder whom his subiectes lyued in suche prosperitie and abundance, in renoune and glorie, when all their dradde them, for theoble conduct gouernment of such a Prince, as all things considered, we finde not the like in all the ancient histories? Did he pill them, that delyuered the~ from the greatest piller and spoiler of them, fro~ al his insatiable Caterpillers, that had pilled the Prince, the S. biectes, and all the Realme, and had gotten almoste, all the goodes and lndes into their clutches, yea, their bodies and soules also? Did he pill the realme, that brought the greatest ryches into the Realme (the Gospell of Chryste, and Christian libertie) that euer the Realme could haue? Ye quarel at ye basenesse of the money.
Hath ther not bin worsse money in times past in Englande? They saye that we had money of lether, haue not the most of other Princes brasen coyne? But sée you haue a brasen face, and a fonde malicious head.
Is the Princes coine counterfet with you? and if it had bene a great deale worsse than it was, can ye call it adulterate or forged? No Saunders, (for here must néedes leaue out Master) such Traytors as you be, are counterfeiters of money, howbeit you are farre worsse traytors, and forge a naughtie coine, in the steade of Gods word, to giue the people trifling traditions of your owne stampe, and take good money for them.
What meane ye by this, ye wiuelesse and shamelesse generation, ye dispisers and defilers of Matrimonie, wold ye haue had him haue liued like you? ye caused him in deede vnwittingly, while hée ignorantly obeyed your Pope, to liue wyth his brothers wife.
Whiche when he knewe, he adhorred and forsoke, as flatte againste Gods worde: Thou shalte not vncouer the secretes thy brothers wife.
And yet the Pope (contrarie to Gods expresse lawe, and the lawe of nature) dispensed with it, and you Papistes maynteine it tooth and nayle, as a lawful maryage.
This in déede was his greatest misfortune, to haue taken hir so long (through too much credite of false Papistes) to be his lawfull wife, whiche was not his wife at all, and yet both the parties ignorantly offended.
for his firste true and lawfull wife: we maye saye indéede he had misfortune in hir too, that he so muche credited the sclanderous vndermining Papists, that neuer stinted to procure hir dath, for ye hatred of the gospel that she professed.
And so at length most subtilly wrought it made hir a sweet sacrifice to God and a most holy martyr.
No misfortune, but mosie happi hap to hir, to sustaine so sclaunderdus a death, in so innocent a cause, the misfortune was the king hir husbandes, to be so beguiled by such false Papistes.
And yet to vs, this maryage was most fortunate, which God so blessed with such a fruit, as neuer the like did spring in Englande.
As for all King Heuries other wiues (saue one) were as as vertuous, chast, godly Quéenes, as any Christian kyng coulde haue.
And yet the default of that one, is not to be imputed vnto him, which to die, is more than cankred malice.
Lest of al, ought it to be ascribed to the euent of his supreme gouernment.
Shoulde M. colsfolly be ascribed to Dauid? yea, shoulde a mans owne faults be accounted for the euent of his vertues? should misfortunes following, be déemed the effectes of godlynesse going before? But you denie all this, that this was godly, to become this supreme gouernour, and say king Henrie tooke it first vpon him.
When we come to the practise of christian Kings before king Henrie: ye shall finde it contrarie, and ye shall finde by that, that is alreadie sayde to Master Stapleton, that in the olde Testament Dauid, Salomon, Iosaphat. &c. toke vpon them this supreme gouernement in their kindomes, that king Henrie dyd.
Ye say he was neuer the happier but the more vnhappier after he tooke it on him.
Whereas he neuer prospered better, than after he had expelled the Popes vsurped authoritie.
For euen then began he indéed to raigne and rule other, where before he bore the name of a king, and was ruled by other, the Pope, his Prelates and Priestes hearing all the
Besides the happiest happe of all the knowledge of God, that by his supreme gouernement, then beganne to florishe.
Nowe after his rayling on king Henrie, he descendeth to king Edward the sixte, saying: And he beeing deade, God by a maruellous manner shewed vnto all the world, how litle this Ecclesiasticall Primacie and high calling, was agreeable to kings.
For Henrie the eight being deade, Edwarde his sonne a childe almost nine yere old, succeeded in his kingdome.
If wee loke to the right that this childe had in the kingdome, hee was no lesse king than his father was.
But if we turne our eyes vnto the state of the church, verily there is a great difference, whether it be gouerned of a childe, or of a man of perfecte age.
Sée the insaciable malice of these Papistes, not onely against the lyuing, but the deade, and that against their late most gratious soueraignes.
It suffiseth not to haue thus co~tumeliously railed on the Quéenes Maiesties father of blessed memorie, but also to deface hir Maiesties brother, that most vertuous Prince, king Edwarde, saying, he toke vpon him this Ecclesiasticall Primacie, as though he or his father toke vpon him, any ecclesiastical primacie, bicause they toke vpon them a supreme gouernement in all ecclesiasticall matters.
But will he spare for spite to sclaunder them, that presumeth to wrest and misconster Gods heauenly prouidence, in calling king Edward to the kingdome, while he was yet a child? He graunteth he was as ful king as his father was.
Then say I, he had al the right and authoritie that his father had.
But sayth he, there is a great difference betwéene the right of a kingdome and the state of the Church, whether it be gouerned of a child, or of a man of perfect age.
As though we talked not (M. Sau~ders) of such a kingdome as were the Churche also, or as though a kingdome (consider it howe ye will) require not likewise to be gouerned of one of perfecte age Or as though ther be not also a great differe~ce, betwene the right of authoritie belonging to the person, be he child, or ma~: and the personal gouerning of him.
But let vs heare M. Saunders arguments against a child.
He maketh exception against a child for two reasons, first the example of Christe, secondly the saying of S. Paule Cal.
For if euen Christ toke not on him the gouernment of the Church, before he attained to thirtie yeres of age, how much lesse would he, that the Church should be gouerned of a child.
yeares of age, was in his personal exercise of the ecclesiasticall functio~, wherto a mature age is requisite.
But the kings Supremacie requireth no such personall exercise of ecclesiasticall function, but is cleane another matter: therfore this example of Christes age is impertinent.
Secondly we grau~t the Churche shoulde not be gouerned of a childe, in that respecte he is a childe, in which consideration he is no king, as you distinguished before betwene a man and a christia~ ma~, and ye must so againe distinguishe betwéene his nature and his person, or his person and his office.
Nowe, in regarde of his office, the defecte of his nature is supplyed by those, that represent him in his office, and they béeing men of graue yeares and knowledge, you can not iustly say, the gouernement is committed to a childe.
Moreouer a childe so long as hee is a little one, liueth vnder Tutors and gouernours, and so the Supreme Heade of the Churche, needeth another superior Head to gouerne and rule him, and that not so muche by chaunce or fortune, as by imbecillitie of his proper nature, and the necessitie of the thing it selfe.
Howe can he therefore be the Supreme Head of the Church, that liueth vnder an other head? Ercept M. Saunders were bent pienishly to warble, he would not reason thus, knowing well inough, that those of rier yeres which gouerne the kings person in his nonage, be not his head, and he a member or subiecte vnder them: but they representing him, he and they are but one in office, and their gouernemente is not properly theirs, but is the kings owne gouernemente.
And so the head hath no head ouer him but onely Iesus Christ.
But M. Saunders foreseeing that by this reason, he might make the childe no king at all of his kingdome (which he before confessed, that king Edwarde was as full king as his father) he preuenteth the obiection, and séeketh a scape to shifte it.
For if ye say by the same reason he is not king of his kingdome neither, bicause he is compelled to gouerne that also by others: the answere is easie, it is no maruell if the lawe of man, which placeth children ouer kingdomes by force of succession, be founde imperfecte.
But it were greatly to be marueled if the lawe of Christ also, whereby he placeth pastors ouer his Church, coulde be accused in anie parte of imperfection.
For as Moses lawe brought nothing to perfection, so on the contrarie, the lawe of Christ lefte nothing vnperfect, as whome it became to fulfill all righteousnesse.
Therefore there shall bee none, much lesse anie chiefe head in the Churche of Christe, the which by nature, can not doe the office of an ecclesiastical head.
But a childe can neither teach, nor baptize, nor by anie meanes assoile the harder questions of the Gospell.
The answere (M. Saunders, as ye say) is easie, but is it a good answere? it were an easie matter to answere, if such easie answeres may serue, that ye may say what ye will (and contrarie your selfe too) when ye finde an inconuenience.
And such an inconuenience, as wipes away all your former reasons.
Neither can ye sufficiently aunswere it, that if your reason hold, of the defecte of the kings nonage while he is a chylde: he may then be no gouernor at all, no not in Temporall matters neither, bycause therein he is gouerned of others also, in that he is but yet a chylde, and so in his kingdome shoulde become no gouernour at all.
But for an easie answere to this, ye saye: this is a defecte in the lawe of man.
Why M. Saunders, doye nowe make this the lawe of man, that a chylde myght be a King? sayde ye not before (and that more truely) it was gods lawe, Numeri.
and cited for examples Ioas and Iosias? and againe, doe ye saye, this is an imperfection in the lawe, that is an imperfection in the person? nay Maister Saunders the lawe of succession was good and perfecte.
Neither your sentence that ye cite of S. Paule, the lawe brought nothing to perfection, serues to this purpose.
Neither was the fault in the law, but in the defecte of the obseruer.
But saint Paule speakes there of the morall law, and of iustification, which the lawe of God giuen by Moyses could not bring to perfection, confuting an other error which the Phariseis, the Pelagians, and the Papistes holde.
But what is this to the present purpose? Saint Paule complaineth not of the imperfection of the politike lw of the Iewes, therfore this is manifestly wrested: Ye obiect yt Christs law is perfect, as though S. Paules law Gal.
cited by your selfe, for the kingdome of a child, be not also the law of Christ: and as for Christs law for the pastors of his Church· we accuse it not to be imperfecte, and yet in the pastors themselues there is no perfection, althoughe Christes law for them be most perfect.
But what answereth this the purpose? The Prince takes not the pastorall office on him, nor to doe the office of an ecclesiasticall head, as ye terme it, nor to teache, or baptise, or astoyle the hard questions of the Gospell, either in his noneage or in his full age, either childe or man.
But to deuise sclaunders, is with you an easie answere.
Nowe vpon these argumentes against the supremacie of king Edward, he knits vp his conclusion of the euent, saying: therefore sith God, after not the best man, calling him selfe the heade of the Churche, did substitute a childe: euen by the things themselues he admonished vs, that that honour did not rightly agree to the father, that was so euill applied to his sonne.
The more ye still vnreuerently carpe at king Henry, calling him not the best ma~, the more ye shew your cankred stomak M. Saunders, that your selfe are one of the worst kind of me~, whose malice no not death ca~ satiate.
But ye more it redoundeth to the praise of that moste noble and vertuous king, being holde~ for so much the better man, of all good men, how much the worse man, such wicked men as you esteeme him ab illaudatis vituperari laudabile est, it is commendable to be dscommended of discommendable men.
Your interpretatio~ of a child succéeding him, hath neither charitie nor truth, neither can you frame anye good argumente on it, but rather on the contrarie.
Where God so blessed the raigne of the childe, that in so shorte a time, so long rooted superstitions Idolatries were abolished, and the word of God so truely and fréely set forth: it argueth that God not onely liked the title of the father, but also confirmed it in the sonne, shewed well that ye childhood of his person, was no impediment to the authoritie of his office, as you maliciously woulde wrest it.
After Kyng Edwarde ye come to Queene Marie, saying: Moreouer, when men neither thus awaked, and the childe after the sixth yeare of his gouernement beyng deade, God placed a woman ouer the kingdome of Englande, who also ought to haue bene furder from gouerning the Church than a childe, for euen the kinde, whiche at the laste, displeased not in a childe, so displeased the holy Ghost in a woman (so farre as pertaineth to the gouernment of the Church) that he in whom Christ spake, doubted not to write, permitte not a woman to teach in the Church.
If you recken the yeares of King Edwardes raigne, to inferre, by the taking of him awaye so soone, Gods misliking of his gouernement: as you still shewe your malicious and ouer saucie constructions of gods iudgementes: so ye bewray withall the foudnesse of your argumentes.
Did not Quéene Marie raigne a shorter while than hée? and why note ye not the yeares of hir raigne also? but this you ouerpasse in sylence, and turne your argumente to hir kynde, in that shee was a woman, to argue Gods displeasure for the Princes gouernemente of the Churche, but ye alleage nothyng that ye alledged not before, oute of Sainte Paule: permitte not a vvoman to teache in the Churche, neyther to vsurpe authoritie ouer the man, but to bee in sylence.
Trow you Maister Saunders this is to bée stretched to gouernemente, that no woman maye haue anye authoritie to gouerne a man? if ye construe it thus, howe will ye make your former saying good? that the ryghte of a kingdome pertayneth no lesse to vvomen than to men, alledging the examples of Debora, Athalia, and Alexandra and the lawe Num.
ye muste néedes therefore confesse, that he speaketh there no otherwyse, than ée dothe
of women not simply, but of suche women as are wiues.
Neyther of all authoritie, but of authoritie ouer the husbande.
Neyther of all speaking, exhorting or commaunding: but of the publique ministerie of preaching.
And thus doth your owne Cardinall Caietane, expounde it, Docere, supple publice. &c. neque dominari, directe hoc respicit vxores, to teach, to wite publikly. &c. neither to rule, this is directly spoke~ of vviues.
And so Catharinus: hic locus manifeste de coniugata intelligitur. &c.
This place manifestlye is vnderstoode of a vvife, in the same sence vvherein it is read in another place, let vvomen holde their peace in the Churches, for it is not permitted to them to speake, but to bee subiecte euen as the lavve saith.
But by the vvaye vvee muste bevvare, that iniurie be done to none.
Although by no meanes it be the office of anye vvoman to teache, notvvythstanding if anye vvoman bee endued vvith singular grace of God (for God is free from all lavve) that coulde bee able to doe these thyngs vvhen it shoulde bee thought meete, shee vvere not to be hindred, chiefelye hauing the gifte of prophecie, but it vvere lavvfull for hir to speake freelye.
As is read of Olda and Debora that iudged the people of Israell, as is apparant in the booke of the iudges.
Doth not the Apostle also warne, that the former holde his peace, if it be reuealed to another? For we know that that glorious, and one of the most deere sposes of Christ, Saint Katherine of Senes taught in times pae, and hath made sermons yea euen in the publique consistoe of the Pope, although she toke not vpon hir these things but with good leaue of Christs owne vica, who best knewe in to be the true spirite of God, and the feruencie of charitie to be giuen hir to edifie the Churche in those troublous tymes, when the scisme raigned. &c.
Thus farre and furder saith this Popishe Bishop, whereby it appereth, that the Papists the~ selues vnderstande not this sentence of Saint Paule, for a simple debarre to all women, no not to preache in the open Churche, if neede so required, so that she haue the Popes leaue.
And can the Pope giue leaue in a time of scisme to maintaine his factio~, when two or thrée Popes striue for the triple diademe, and to Saint hir for hir labour? And shall it not be lawfull for a Christian Quéene (not attempting hir selfe to preache) to set forth, by the authoritie due to all princes, suche lawes whereby gods truth maye be preached, by those that are lawfully called therevnto? may not a Quéen by vertue of hir royall office, in the open assemblye of hir owne subiects, speake, exhort, persuade, and commaunde hir people, being also the Church of Christ, to abolish al errors, and receiue the onely truth of God? was it lawfull for the Empresse Irene, to publishe hir decrees in the Churche, for the erecting of Images, against the worde of God? and is it not lawfull for the Quéenes Maiestie, by publique decrées to pull them downe, and forbid the worship of them, according to gods worde? this sentence therefore euen by theyr owne witnesse is but wrested, to debarre a womans gouernment of the Church.
But Maister Saunders procéeding on his argument for Quéene Marie, saith: To the same purpose it came, that the greate goodnesse of God called such a Queene to the rule of the kingdome, that both sawe this selfe same thing, and confessed it.
For Queene Marie not onely toke not this proude title of the head of the Church, but also when she was admonished of others· that she would be like hir father, she brought forth most weightie reasons, why she ought not to do it.
VVhervpon, she chiefely exhorting therto, that title was omitted, and the proper honour restored to the successors of Peter.
If the title (as ye saye M. Saunders) be proude, Quéene Marie had done wel to leaue it, but your Pope not ouer wel to take it, howbeit this title, as King Henry, and King Edwarde before toke it, was no proude title, but a title of their charge and duetie.
And therefore she ought to haue retained it, nor did well in leauing it, and rendring it to a foraigne prelate, that had nought to do therwith.
And in who~ in deede it is both a proude, and an Antichristian title, both spoyling Christian Princes of their principall office in their particular estates: and also bereauing Christ of his glory ouer his vniuersall Churche.
Neither can he claime it as successor of Peter: Peter neuer hauing the possessio~ of it.
And what waightie reasons soeuer she persuaded hir selfe withall, to shake it off, she taking the kingdome on hir, the waight and burden lay still on hir charge before God.
And if your reason be ought of the effect and sequele of this hir refusall, into what extréeme miserie was this Realme broughte in so shorte a time, by ye Legates spoyling, by the Prelats burning, by the Italians pilling, by the Frenchme~s winning, by the Spaniardes oppressing, and by gods diuine Iustice scourging the Realme with strange diseases, droughts, waters, dearthes, to conclude the Quéene hir selfe and crowne impouerished, all the Realme in daunger of perpetuall thraldome and vtter vndoyng, if God of his infinite mercie had not deliuered vs from it, and yet sée if these Papistes, that can so narrowly spie, and proll at euery note in king Henry, and kings Edwards dayes, can in Quéene Maries dayes, espie anye one of these great beames, that were such apparante tokens of gods wrath, that all men sawe and felt what euents succeeded the refusall of this title, and the yéelding it to the Pope, nerehand the cleane subuersion of this Realme, if we may iudge by sequels.
Now after Quéene Marie, he comes to the Quéenes Maiestie, that now (God be praised) most prosperously raigneth ouer vs.
But vvhen very many giuen to heresies vvere offended at this notable modestie of the Queene, neither vvould they yet vnderstande his Counsell in gouerning his Churche: God brought to passe that Marie of happie memorie being dead, the kingdome of England should deuolue to such a vvoman, as novve vvriteth hir selfe: The supreme gouernesse in all matters and causes asvvell ecclesiasticall as secular.
That yet so at the length, by the successe it selfe, men of hard harte and obstinate necke, mighte marke, hovv euill king Henry tooke this office vpon him, the vvhiche of his heire and successour could not duely and orderly be fulfilled.
For to whom it is not permitted to teach, vvhich is the most necessarie office of an ecclesiasticall Head: hovv shal she performe those greater offices, that are occupied in the chastisement and correction of them, that ought to teache the people? or shall she vvhich is vnvvorthie that she should hir selfe teache publiquely in the lovvest degree, moderate and reprehend vvith lavvful authoritie, other publique teachers in the highest degree? or if she can not lavvfully reprehend them, shall she yet be lavvfully supreme gouernesse of the Church? omit here the things that in these yeares, vvhich are last passed, haue bene (I knovv not hovv vncomely) done and preached in Englande, vnder such supreme heads of the Church.
Another time, if God vvill, vvill handle them particularly, hovve greatly both from the lavve of God, and from the sentence of the auncient Churche, and from righte reason, that state of a common vveale is farre, in vvhiche any king arrogateth to himselfe, the office and name of the supreme head of the Church.
Is your part so false and weake of proues (Maister Saunders) that it can win no credite, but by discrediting of ours with sclaunders? and yet we woulde pardon this in you, ascribing it either to some passion of choler against your aduersaries, or to blinde affection of your selues, that ye call verie manie of vs, giuen to heresies, hard harted, and obstinate necked, which are termes fitter to muster in M. Stapletons co~mon places, than to stuffe vp M. doctor Saunders volumes: howe they redownde vpon your selues, let other iudge· that will reade and view of both.
But if we forgiue you this, for our parts, shal we stil suffer you to raile vpo~, sclander the Lordes annoynted, saying: she arrogateth to hir selfe the office and name of the supreme Head of the Church, speaking at randon withoute limitation of the Churche, as the Pope doth arrogate to himselfe, and taketh on hir to be an ecclesiasticall head and publique teacher of other that should teach hir? these are too too infamous sclau~ders of hir Maiestie, that claimeth no such title, nor attempteth any such thing.
What supreme gouernement is ascribed to hir highnesse, we haue tolde you a thousand times, but sée ye will not vnderstand it, bicause ye would of set purpose sclander it.
But to knit vp your argument of the euent and sequele of the Quéenes Maiesties raigne: ye say, many things haue bin done and preached in England, ye cannot tell hovv vnsemely. thinke euen the same M. Saunders: ye can not tell howe ndede.
But howe vnseemely a thing is this for one of your rofession, to chalenge ye cannot tell what nor howe? ye set owne nothing, but vnder a pretence of sparing vs, to bréede et a furder sclaunderous suspition, ye threat vs that ye will serue the~ til a furder leisure, yt is to say, ad Kalendas graecas, til shall first know them, and then be able to proue them, in the meane seaso~, ye take the wisest way, to say such ther are, but what they are, ye cannot now tell, ye wil learne the~ out, and tell vs another time, but tell the worste ye canne, ye shal neuer be able to tell, of any fals doctrine preached and by the Prince approued to be preached, nor of anye wicked facte, allowed by publike authoritie to be done.
No Maister Saunders in all the Quéenes Maiesties raigne, ye can neuer be able to proue any suche things, but in the raigne of your Popes, we can proue many such things: as whordome committed and maintained: murder done and maintained, Idolatry vsed and maintained, and infinite errors preached and maintained by publique authoritie among the Papists.
As for ye Quéenes maiesties raigne that now is, if the euent and sequele may make an argument, God hath so blessed it (maugre all your spites and practises) that no Realme christian hath florished like, nor Englande more at anye tyme.
The Lord be praised for it, and for his mercie sake long continue it, that hath giuen so goodly a token, of his well liking hir Maiesties supreme gouernment.
The argument is, that Princes can not iudge nor define in causes Ecclesiasticall.
OF those errors that are about the povver of kings and magistrats the seco~d error is of the~ that thinke kings are not in dede the chief heads of the Churches in vvhich they raigne but in certaine causes Ecclesiastiall to bee euen as vvorthie members as Bishops· for although in one certaine thing (as in the office of teaching) they preferre Bishops before kings, yet partly in another Ecclesiasticall matter (as in deposing a Byshop from his seat, or in moderating any synode, they preferre kings before Bishops, partly they vvill haue it free for kings, that almoste in euery ecclesiasticall matter they may knowe and decerne as Iudges.
Of the confutation of whiche errour, this is the reason, that should shewe in euery cause of the ecclesiastical lawe, that is to be knowne and iudged, Kinges to be so muche in the place of priuate men, that this trial can not of the ecclesiasticall Iudges be committed vnto them, Although denie not, but that of some facte that perteyneth to the eccl. lawe, the knowledge may be committed to Kinges and Magistrates.
But before the eccl. cause be known, the king may orderly intermeddle his authoritie, to that ende that a quiet place may be graunted, where the Bishops should iudge.
And also that the Bishops may be called at a certayne day to that place.
And that in the meane season, whyle the ecclesiasticall cause is knowne, the publique peace, yea euen in the assembly of Priestes may be conserued.
To conclude, after the cause knowne and iudged of the Pristes, the king either by the sworde that he beareth not in vayne, or by some other bodily punishment may correct him, if any man shall refuse to obey the Priestes sentence.
Therefore we denie not, but that bothe before and about, and after the Bishoply iudgement, there are some partes of kinges, but in the office of iudging, kings can do more than can priuate men.
For either of them can bothe giue counsell, and shewe what they thinke good: but neither of them can define, what the diuine or eccl. lawe declareth in that matter.
VVhiche thing thus declared, let vs nowe come to the proofe of the matter it selfe.
All this then either néedeth none or little answere (M. Saunders) béeing barely anouched without any proofe, to the whiche ye are not yet come, but onely declare what ye will denie or graunt to Princes.
Your graunt we take, and sée ye go not from it.
But will all your fellowes, yea wyll your Pope him selfe graunt so muche, that the Emperour shall by his authoritie appoynt the certayne place and day where and when the Bishops shal holde their Councels? It was wont to be so in the olde time.
But will your Pope suffer this nowe, and that kinges shall do the lyke in their kingdomes? Nay M. Sauders, he will mislike of this, and say, ye graunt too large a thong of another mans leather: howesoeuer you would by qualification, eate your graunt agayne, cleane contrarying your selfe, ascribing no more to Princes than to priuate men.
And yet agayn you graunt, that bothe of them may giue counsell, and shewe what they thinke good in ecclesiasticall matters, although they can not determine them.
Goe to master Saunders, till you bring your proofes, we will take this graunte also of your liberalitie, that Princes may giue counsell and shewe what they thinke good.
good manie of your side will not graunt so muche, nor you but for a countenaunce sake neither.
Althoughe yée doe them open iniurie, to compare them qualle (beeing publique estates) to priuate menne.
As for your determination of Gods law, what you meane thereby, when yée shewe your meaning playner, we will aunswere to it.
Master Saunders proofes in this Chapter kéepe this order, first he alleageth the reasons for his partie.
Those things that are of God, man can not dispose them otherwyse, than if God gyue vnto them suche authoritie· but the causes of faythe chiefly of all other are of GOD, bycause faythe is the moste necessarie gyfte of GOD, that no man can obtayne to him selfe by any force, either of nature or arte: the causes therefore of fayth can not be iudged of other than of them, to whome God hath giuen that power.
aunswere, the partes of thys argument be true, the conclusion noughte, for there is more in the conclusion than in the premisses· The conclusion shoulde haue Therefore can not dispose the causes of fayth otherwyse, than if God giue them suche authoritie.
Howebeit, we simply denie not M. Saunders conclusion: but would haue him distinguish what he meanes by iudgeing.
he meane disposing causes of fayth otherwise than God hath already in his word disposed them, (or else his argumente hathe no sense nor sequele:) then the conclusion, as it is not proued, so is it apparant false.
Neyther giue we suche iudgement to Princes, or to any other creature, for suche power God hath giuen to none.
Althoughe the Popishe priestes falsly clayme suche power, to dispose matters of fayth otherwyse, than God disposed them.
But master will proue hys, conclusion on thi wyse: But God hath giuen suche power to certayne men, and not at large to all Christian people.
The antecedent he proues from Saincte Paule, Ephesians the fourth.
For God hathe ordeyned, some Apostles, other Prophets, other Euangelistes, other Pastors, and Teachers, to the ediying of his mysticall body, whiche is the Churche.
But other hee made as it were sheepe and lambes, that they shoulde bee edifyed by their pastors and teachers, and too whome their pastors shoulde attende, that they should not be caried awaye with euerie blaste of doctrine by the subtiltie of man.
If he meane by iudgeing. eaching with sounde iudgement, it is true, and this senence well applyed: but if he meane as his principall roposition was, whereon all dependes.
As for thys sentence, roues no suche iudgement giuen to any of these persons, but rather confutes it, as not to edifie, but to destroy, and to be caried away by the subtiltie of men with euery blast of doctrine if men might dispose otherwise of fayth than God him selfe hath dispoed.
Nowe vpon this sentence of S. Paule for Pastors, be reasoneth thus: But Pastors only iudge what is fit or not fit for the sheepe.
For, to conclude that sheepe are indued with equal power to Pastors, this were nothing else, but to take away the differe~ce that Christ hath set betweene the Pastors and the sheepe, and the thinges that he hath distinguyshed, to mingle and confounde them.
Kinges therefore and Magistrates, if they be counted sheepe in the floke of Christ (as in deede sheepe they are) iudge not togither with the Pastors.
Pastors do onely iudge what is fit or not fit for the sheepe.
But Princes are not Pastors, but sheepe of the flocke of Christ.
Ergo, Princes do not iudge what is fit or not fit for them, The maior he proueth thus.
To conclude that the sheepe haue equall power with Pastors, is nothing else, but to mingle and confounde and take away the difference that Christ hath set betweene the Pastors and the sheepe.
But if Princes should iudge, the sheepe should haue equall power.
Ergo, For Princes to iudge were to mingle, confound, and take away the difference that Christ hath set betweene the Pastors and the sheepe.
First, to the maior answere, he siftes the similitude of a shepherde and shéepe too narrowe.
For although in some resemblaunces it holde, yet is it not simply true, that the Pastor onely iudgeth what is fitte or not fitte for this kinde of sheepe.
He him selfe confesseth before, and after agayne confesseth, that the priuate man or Princes may giue counsell and priuate iudgement.
And S. Paule speaking not of the pastor, but of the spiritual man, that is, of the sheepe of God, sayth: Spiritualis omnia iudicat, the spiritual man iudgeth all thinges.
And Christe biddes the people beware of false prophets, which can not be without iudgement.
Neyther is this sufficient proofe of the maior that he alleageth: to contende that the sheepe hath equal power, is to confounde Christes distinction.
But this wée denie, that héereby the sheepe is made to haue equall power.
For, the iudgement of the pastor is one thing, and the power of the pastor is another, althoughe it oughte to haue iudgement concurring with it.
Neither ascribe wée iudgement alike to the pastors and the sheepe, although in this spirituall kinde of sheepe, some of them haue more sounde and perfect iudgement than their pastors.
To the minor, answere, it is not simply true neyther, for in one sense, not onely the pastors them selues are lyke wyse sheepe, but also the Princes them selues are pastors.
In the former sense, euery faythfull Christian is a sheepe vder Christe, the onely shepehearde, and must heare his voyce.
And so the Prieste is a shéepe also, or else he shall neuer be in the folde of the Churche, nor placed at the righte hande of Christe.
In the other sense, not onely the Prince is suche a Pastor as Homer calleth Agaemnon, and rules and féedes the body (and so the Priestes are his sheepe, as well as other subiectes:) but also in protection setting foorth of Gods worde throughout his Dominions: he is their pastor too, in appoynting the pastors to féede the sheepe onely in Gods pastures.
And in this sense we ascribe supreme Pastorship vnto him, ouer the Priest also.
Althoughe in the ministerie of the worde and Sacramentes, the Prieste agayne is his superiour pastor, and the Prince is but his sheepe.
But if they be counted as Pastors: aske whence they proue it that Christe gaue them suche power? for what haue they that they haue not receiued? but Christ, as he tooke not awaye or diminished the auncient power of kinges, graunted by the lawe of Nations, so neither annexed he vnto them a newe power of feeding his sheepe.
Moreouer, the auncient power of kinges, althoughe it be of God, yet is it of him by the meane of the lawe of Nations, and the Ciuill, and not by any especiall and chiefe constitution of the Gospell, as is before declared.
If therefore Kinges and polytike Magistrates haue any power in causes of faythe, either they receiued it from the lawe naturall, of Nations and of the Ciuill, or of the lawe of God, that is reuealed to the Churche.
But (to beginne with the later member firste) by the lawe of God, that is reuealed to the Churche, no suche thing is graunted to kinges.
For nothing else is reuealed in the newe Testament concerning Princes, than that that is Cesars shoulde be giuen to Cesar, that tributes shoulde be payde, that kings should be prayed for, that bothe the King and the gouernours sent from him should be obeyed, and finally, that al power proceedeth fro~ God, that euery Magistrate beares not the sworde in vaine, but in that matter, is to be acknowledged to be Gods minister.
Moreouer none of these places do bid the king by name dispose of the Churche of Christ, or in causes of fayth to arrogate ought to him self.
The argument in briefe is thus: If princes be counted as pastors, they haue suche power giuen them.
answere, firste to the maior, rightly vnderstoode it is true, that if princes may be counted as pastors, the authoritie is giuen them.
But it is truely to be vnder stoode by distinction of pastorall authoritie.
Secondly, to the minor, that Princes haue no pastorall authoritie giuen them, it is false.
If any were giuen them, it was giuen them, either by the lawe of Nations, or by the Ciuill, or by Christ in the new Testament: But it is giuen them by neither of these three: Ergo, they haue none giuen them.
Bycause he leaueth oute the olde Testament, whiche he confessed hym selfe before, was a figure of the pastorship of the new Testament, here he leaues out the old Testament quite.
Which had he named as he ought to haue done, he should both haue séene Princes to haue bene ordeyned immediately of God, as Moyses, Iosue, all the Iudges, Saule, Dauid, and Salomon: and not by the meane of the lawe of Nations, nor the lawe Ciuill comming betweene.
And he should haue ounde that the Prince of Gods people is appoynted, namely to be a pastor or shepheard vnto them.
Moses spake to the Lorde, saying: Let the Lorde God of the spirite of all fleshe, appoynt a man ouer the congregation, who maye go oute and in before them, and leade them out and in, that the congregation of the Lorde be not as sheepe without a Pastor.
All the Tribes of Israell came to Dauid vnto Hebron, and sayde thus: Beholde we are thy bones and thy fleshe, and in times past when Saule was our king, thou leddest Israell in and out, and the Lorde hath sayde vnto thee, thou shalt feed my people Israel.
In which words Dauid was made their pastor or shepherd, which was rese~bled before in his kéeping of natural shéepe, as he confesseth of him self.
He chose Dauid also his seruant, and toke him away fro~ the sheepe foldes, as he was following the Ewes great with yong ones, he tooke him that he might leade Iacob his people, Israel his inheritance.
So he fed the~ with a faythfull and true heart and ruled the~ prudently with al his power: Which worde of féeding belonging to a pastor, God ascribeth also to al the Iudges, saying· VVhen commaunded the Iudges to feede my people.
And the Lorde sayde vnto thee, thou shalt feede my people of Israell. and be the prince. &c.
booke of the Kings, whe~ Micheas described in his vision the kings destruction, he sayth: saw Israel dispersed on the mountaynes, as sheepe without a pastor, and the Lorde sayde, these haue no master.
&c. By these and many other places it appeareth that God appoynted the Prince to be a pastor in his office: but his office (as is proued at large before) stretchet to the setting oorthe the lawe of God, and gouernement of the priests so well as the laytie: therefore his pastorshippe stretcheth so farre also, although not to the taking vpon him the office of the spirituall pastor.
For, not only by the lawe of Nations, and Ciuill, a politike pastorshippe is committed to the Prince: but also a Christian pastorshippe to a christian Prince, euen in the newe Testament also.
Which as it is comprehended in these sentences that M. Saunders here sets down, so are there more sentences that declare the Princes pastorship.
But sayth he, none of these do bidde the king by name to dispose of the Church of Christ, or in causes of fayth, arrogate ought to him selfe.
This is a wrong conclusion, M. Saunders, from iudgement pastorship to inferre disposing arrogating.
As for arrogating neither the Prince nor the Priest ought to do it, nor the Prince attemptes it, althoughe the Priestes haue and do attempte it.
Likewyse for disposing, if you meane as ye sayde before, disposing otherwyse than Christ hath done: your Priestes do so, but they ought not to do so.
The Prince can not do it, nor he dothe it, nor claymes to doe it, nor it is ascribed vnto him.
Yea, thoughe you meane by disposing, no alteration: yet is this an harde phrase, to say that Princes or priestes either, dispose of the Churche of Christe, but rather dispose of matters in the Church of Christ.
And this as the Priest may doe in his vocation, so may the Prince in his estate.
Which though it be not expressed by name, but comprehended in the newe Testament: yet is it euen by name expressed in the olde Testament in diuers places, of the disposing of Church matters by Moyses, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Iosaphat, Ezechias. &c.
And since your selfe confesse, the one gouernment is a figure of the other.
And that the gouernment before Christ, he neither brake it nor diminished it: it followeth, that the~ he left it entire and confirmed it.
And therfore although the Princes disposing of Churche matters be not by name expressed, yet is it by your reaso~, necessarilie comprehended, and so you answere your selfe.
Now after he hath thus (as he supposeth) debarred Princes from all warrant oute of the law of God and the newe Testament: he examineth the other lawes, saying: Except therefore by the lawe of nature, the law of nations or the lawe ciuill such power be permitted too the king, it is cleare, that he hath no power at all ouer these things: But certaine it is, that those lawes cannot giue to the king any power ouer things, that are not subiect to those lawes.
For no law can establishe ought, either of other things, or persons, or actions, than those things that fall vnder the compasse of it.
But Ecclesiasticall matters do infinitly excede the power of the lawe of Nature, of nations, and the ciuill.
For of these three the law of nature is the first and greatest.
But neither that (sith it bega~ in the earth) can decree ought vpon the mysteries of Christe, which draw their originall from heauen onely.
For, that may speake nothing of the force of nature being yet entire, truely after that the nature of all mankynd by the sinne of Adam was corrupted, and death entring by one man passed into al: it can not be, that from that infected originall, any good thing shoulde come forth.
For an ill tree can not bring forth good fruites, neither doth the fleshely man (such as we all be, by nature) perceiue those things that are of the spirite of God.
All this labor is a néede not (M. Saunders) to run (for confirmation of a Christian doctrine) from the law of God to the lawe of nature and the lawe of man, we vse not so to doe Neither desire we anye doctrine to be admitted, that is not proued by the lawe of God reuealed in his worde vnto vs, it is you the Papists that stand on such proues and grounds, not we.
Howbeit, you do iniurie to the law of nature, to measure it altogether by the corruption of our nature.
For, howsoeuer we be degenerate from it, the law of nature remaineth in it selfe both good and perfect, and is called likewise the law of God.
Neither can thinke that euery ecclesiasticall thing (as ecclesiasticall things are commonly vnderstoode) is infinitely aboue the power of the law of nature.
By which reason many petit matters, would be farre aboue great principles.
Yea many great Ecclesiasticall matters doe fall within the compasse of the lawe of nature.
It is true yt you say of the corruption of our nature, that by the fall of Adam sin hath infected the Masse of all mankinde.
An ill tree can not bring forth good fruite and that the fleshely man perceiueth not the things that are of the spirit of God.
All this is true, but is it not as much against a Priest as a Prince? for ye Priest in that he is a man is borne in sinne, and dyeth by death the reward of sinne, nor ca~ bring forth any good fruites, nor perceiue the things of the spirit of God.
And the prince, in that he is a Christia~, is washed from his sinne.
The sting of death hath no power ouer him, but is a passage to eternall life.
He is a good tree and bringeth good fruits, and is become a spirituall man, perceiuing and working the things that are of the spirite of God, and that perchaunce a great deale better than many a good Priest, and without all doubt, farre more spirituall than any Popishe Priest.
And therefore that ye speake of the corruption of nature, is nothing to the purpose, excepte it be to confute your errors of pura naturalia, fréewill, preparatiue workes. &c.
But Maister Saunders drist is this, that onely the Priests are spirituall men.
and so may onely Iudge of spiritual things, and Princes are but naturall, fleshely and sinnefull men, and so can giue no Iudgement of spirituall matters.
But howe vntrue this is, how presumptuous on his partie, and iniurions to all Christian Princes: and how contrary to his owne selfe, that faith else where, Christian Princes are spirituall: thinke anye that haue but meane Iudgement, may easily Iudge it.
But Maister Saunders procéedeth saying: But to Iudge of Ecclesiasticall matters is no small good thyng but one of the chiefest that Christe hath gyuen vnto his Church: bycause he hath gyuen the power of feeding, of losyng and bynding to his Apostles, that is, to the chiefest Magistrates of hys Churche, euen as the greatest gifte, VVhich gifte they coulde neuer well exercise but wyth Iudgement eyther goyng before or goyng with it.
For he that shall binde nothing but that that shoulde be bounde, and shall lose nothing but that that shoulde be losed, must of necessitie before hande deliberate and decree, that this is to bee bounde, and that is to bee losed.
But to decree suche a thing to bee done, or not to be done, in Christian Religion, this is euen that that we call, to Iudge in matters of Faith.
Syth therfore a power so heauenly and notable, can not spring oute of the beginnings of our corrupte nature: it followeth, that it commeth onely of the free mercie of God.
But that mercie of God is made manifest vnder the time of the new Testament, partlye by the lawe written, partly not written: but neyther waye anye povver is gyuen to Kyngs in Ecclesiasticall causes.
This argume~t (M. Sau~ders) is like the hopping of a reu~d, that from the law of the new Testament, went about to infirme it by the lawe of nature, and so fetching a circumquaque, commeth in again with this conclusion, that it is not by the law of the newe Testament.
So that where we thought we had procéeded urder, wée are nowe where wée were before.
We graunt, that to iudge aright of Ecclesiasticall matters, is a great gift of God, but that ye iudgeme~t of ecclesiasticall matters is onelie to be restrained to binding and losing (as you here define, what you meane by iudging in matters of faith) this is a manifest falsehood.
True it is, that binding and losing can not rightly be withoute iudgement, nor withoute right iudgement (and therefore your Pope and you doe erre so often herein) both binding that that should be losed, and losing that that should be bound, errante claue, as ye terme it, your key erring: and erring also not onely in things to be bounde or losed, but in the power it selfe of binding losing too.
Yet notwithstanding binding and losing, and the iudgement requisite in binding and losing, are two distinct and seueral things: and iudgement reacheth furder to other things also, euen in the Priest himselfe, besides the Princes iudgement.
And therefore as this definition of iudgement in matters of faith, is preposterously brought in (for ye oughte before to haue defined, what ye ment by iudgemente) so is it false, for other matters of faithe require iudgement besides binding and losing.
Now where you say, this power commeth not of the principles of our corrupt nature, but of the free mercie of God: you say truth: But that ye adde, the mercie of God is made manifest vnder the time of the newe testament, partlye by the law written, partly not written: is spoken ambiguously.
For, that Princes iudged in matters of faith was also made manifest in the olde Testament, but that Princes haue power to binde and lose, we graunt is neither manifest nor couert, neither in the olde or newe.
As for the newe lawe to be deuided into written and not written: is another error and impertinent to this question.
Your vnwritten lawe of the new Testament we stand not vpon.
But to affirme that by neither way written or vnwritten, no power is giuen to kings in Ecclesiasticall matters: that we denie, and your self haue rather confuted it, tha~ hither to confirmed it.
But to confirme it, ye bring out this reason: Neither were thene at the beginning any Christian Kings to whom Christ shoulde haue committed any power, nor the Apostles gaue any rule, according where vnto the kings should iudge of Ecclesiasticall causes.
That there were no Christian kings then, is not materiall.
For by this rule, they should be no defenders of the faith neither, bicause Princes were not the~ defenders of it.
But yt the Apostles gaue no rule whereby they should iudge, is false.
For whosoeuer should iudge, shuld iudge by gods word, and this rule Christ and his Apostles gaue in generall.
But that Princes mighte iudge, is both proued from the olde Testament, and by the text that M. Saunders himselfe citeth out of the new, yea by that he saith immediatly.
For if any man say kings are appointed iudges in a cause of the faith, only bicause by Baptisme they are made spiritual me~, who iudge all things, and the spirites do trie those things that are of God: this in dede graunt to be true in the kynde and maner of the priuate, but not of the publique iudgement.
For it is another thing, when thou art a member of the Catholike Church, nor preferrest thy selfe before thy pastours, what is necessarie for thee priuately to Iudge (and this the vnction teacheth) and another thing to take vpon thee power to teache others, and to prescribe to thy Pastors what they ought to do or teache, when thou art not called to the publique ministerie of the Church as Aaron was.
We know there is a difference betwéen priuate and publique Iudgement.
But that this place of S. Paule, The spirituall man Iudgeth all things, is only to be vnderstoode of prinate Iudgement: is but the priuate iudgement of M. Saunders.
But it is well that he graunteth priuate iudgement to euery Christian man.
Neither is it any reason then, it shuld be debarred irom any Christian Princes, neither is it anye reason that the Prince (although in his priuate Iudgement·) rightly iudging a matter of faithe to be true, shoulde not approue set forth ye same publiquely, by his princely authoritie.
For a Prince is not only a priuate man, but a publique man also, not that he may doe all things of his owne priuate or publique Iudgement, nor take vpon him the publique ministerie of the pastour in teaching, being not called, as Aaron was: for this is not ascribed to the Prince, bicause he giueth a publique Iudgement in respect he is a publique person: but his Iudgement is a publique approbation and establishing of that, that is alreadie by others Iudgement· iudged, to whome the discussing appertaineth.
In which discussing, althoughe the godly learned clergie (being called as Aaron was) haue the greatest skill and charge of Iudgement: yet the lay men, suche as are also learned and godly, haue a publique Iudgement too.
Or else, why saith Panormitane, we shoulde more beleue a lay man alleaging scripture, than the whole councell besides? but nowe the truth being once founde out, by these learned Iudgements: the Princes publique Iudgement, as it called them together, as it gaue them their charge, so it prescribeth what the pastors ought to doe and teache therin, without any preiudice to the spirituall pastors Iudgement in the function of his doing and teaching.
Now hauing thus set downe his owne assertions, he will enter on the other part, to confute our obiections.
And first he alleageth this reason of the protestantes: In all the olde Testamente we sée gouernors and Kings both to haue prescribed to the priests what they ought to doe in ecclesiasticall matters, and also to haue remoued them fro~ the ministerie that haue negligently done their dutie.
To this obiecton M. Saunders answere is this, that this reason holdes not from the olde Testament to the new.
If this came so to passe in the olde Testament (saith he) yet no reason shuld compell, that the same shuld be so in the new Testament, sith the reason of the eccl. gouernment is changed.
And are you changed too M. Saunders, that saide before after say, make all your booke of it, that ye ecclesiastical kind of gouernment hath bene alwayes one, and that is, a vible Monarchie, euen from Adam to Pope Pius·
and said, that if the gouernement be changed, the Churche must needes be changed to: and made the gouernement of the olde Testament, to be a figure of ye new.
But now that you are beaten with your owne arguments, you say they hold not by reason the ecclesiasticall gouernment is changed.
But see Maister Sau~ders you woulde deale with vs, as the riche man dealt with his poore neighbor, When ye poore ma~ complained saying, beseeche your worship be good vnto me, for my Cowe hath goared your Bull.
What hath he? (quoth the riche ma~) tell thée plaine thou shalt pay for him then.
cry you mercy sir (quoth the poore ma~) should haue said, your bull hath goared my cowe, tushe quoth the rich ma~, the case is altered, that it is another matter.
And so perceiue M. Sau~ders it is with you, when the Priest is said to haue any authoritie in the olde Testament, marke that (say you) that maketh for vs, and why so? bicause ye olde Testament is a figure of the new, ye gouernement (& ye marke it) was for the priest, but ye gouernment must not alter, the states must be a like, and all this geare.
But now sir it is proued the kings gouernement was aboue the priests.
Is it so? say you, that is another maner of matter, tush, the~ the case is altered.
If this came to passe in the olde Testament, yet no reason shoulde compell that the same should be so in the new Testament, fith the reason of the ecclesiasticall gouernement is changed.
But as the prouerbe sayth, ye case is altered, but ye matter is where it was.
What a mockerie is this in so waightie and plaine a matter? But let vs heare your reasons Maister Saunders.
Nor without cause (say you) for the Synagog of the Iewes, although it co~tained in it som true Israelits iust me~, yet both it was, was called a earthly rather tha~ a heue~ly kingdo~e in so much that Augustine doubteth whether in the olde Testament the kingdome of heauen be euer named or no, much lesse that it is promised for rewarde.
For those things that were done did signifie in dede diuine things (and so the lawe it selfe was also spirituall) but the things themselues were not in themselues so diuine as our things are, in so much that the Apostle teacheth, that the glorie of the Synagoge was no glory at all, in respect of the excellente glorye of that Ministerie, whiche nowe is exercised in the Church by the Ministers of the newe Testament, not in the letter, but in the spirite.
Therfore sith the people of God consisteth of a bodie and a soule or spirite, the carnall part obtained the principalitie in the olde people, and was ordained to signifie spirituall things.
VVhervpo~, as mount Synai, the kindled fire, the whirlewind, the darknesse, the storme, and sounde of the trumpet, and voyce of the words, was onely of the earth and carnall: so nowe all things are spirituall and internall.
There raigned the seruile feare of God, and the bodily sworde: but here is moste deare loue, and the spirituall sworde: they abuse therfore the holy Scriptures, that for those things that were done of the Kings in the olde Testamente: thinke now also that the kingdome of heauen (which is the Church) should be subiect to earthly kings.
This answere why the gouernement is changed, is a depressing of their estate in compariso~ of ours: that theirs was more earthly, ours more spirituall which, as in part we denie not, yet repute not theirs so grossely as here he makes it: yet is this comparison plainely wrested, to inferre alteration of gouernement thervpon, from the Princes ouer the Priests then, to the Priests ouer the Princes nowe.
For this alteration maketh the olde, not to prefigure the newe: but to destroy it, as no comparison but a cleane contrarietie.
But the true comparison being such, as the one estate prefigured the other: the excellencie is in the difference of this aboue that, retaining still the same estate of gouernment, so that, if those godly Princes, did so well order their gouernement in those causes, that in comparison were but earthly, and not so deuine as ours: then muche more shoulde our Christian Princes, order their gouernment better, in much more excellent ecclesiasticall matters.
But M. Saunders turneth all, (as though the King and the Prieste were compared togither) that the kings gouernement was but earthly then, and the priestes gouernement now is spiritual.
Wheras the co~parison is of ye things gouerned, and not of the gouernors.
And yet to compare those with these gouernors, those earthly Princes were not so litle spirituall then, but these spirituall Priestes are ten times more earthly, grosse, and carnall nowe.
What S. Augustine douteth remember not, but we without doubting know now, that the kingdome of heauen was promised then to them, so well as nowe to vs, and they without doubting hoped for it, and vndoubtedly did receiue it, and do enioy it.
The comparison of glorie that Saint Paule maketh, that theirs was nothing to ours, is true But he speaketh not thereof, comparing visible glories, the one with the other, such as the ministerie of the Popishe Church settes for the it selfe withall: For in such outwarde glorie, the olde Lawe passed the new, the Pharisies passed Christe, the Heatheus passed the Christians, both in the Apostles time, and long while after, till the glorious ministerie of the Pope hath far excelled them all.
The examples of the glorie and terror in Mount Synai, of the seruile feare, of the bodily sword, are iumbled togither disorderly, and are compared to spirituall resemblances or contraries, in the Gospell.
But as they take not away the Christian Magistrates bodily sword nor glorie, so meddle they not with alteration of Princes gouernement ouer Ministers in causes ecclesiasticall, therefore are méere impertinent.
But if all these shiftes will not serue, then saith M. Saunders, sée the inconueniences.
Othervvise if the state of the olde kings shall be drawne to the time of the newe Testament, shall not the state of the Byshops of the Leuiticall tribe, by the same reason be drawne to our time also? lette there be therefore one tribe appointed to the outwarde Priesthoode, let there be one Temple in the world, let there be but one Byshop, and let bloud sacrifices be restored.
But if thou confesest these things are made voyde, wherefore grauntest thou not also, that those things are voide that kings haue done about diuine matters· are only the doings of kings eternal, nor could they be changed, so farre as pertained to the disposing of holy things? What could or what could not be done (M. Saunders) we stande not vpon, but what is, or what is not done, is the question And that the state of the ciuill gouernement is not altered, your sel haue often graunted, that the gouernment still was one, that the one was a figure of the other, that Christe toke not away, nor diminished the Princes authoritie.
As for the Leuiticall Law of the Priests, the scripture is plaine in many places, that it is cleane dissolued, you cannot therefore make these alike, except you wil become a Iewe.
And so it seemeth by this your wicked reason, you had rather renounce the Priesthoode sacrifice of Christe, bring in againe the priesthoode sacrifice of the olde law, than you woulde giue Princes authoritie ouer Priestes in the newe lawe.
But now that M. Sanders hath thus answered the Protestantes argument, from the gouernement in the olde law, by saying the case is altered, and the gouernment changed: he preuenteth the Protestans replie, setteth downe an other obiection in their name.
If those things that were done in the old lawe, are not to be drawne to the time of the newe Testament, wherefore flee the Papists for the primacie of the B. of Rome, to the example of one Leuiticall Byshop: and also for the outwarde sacrifice, to the olde sacrifices.
For althogh it be true that you Papists (as you terme your self) do flée to ye exa~ples of ye Leuiticall Bishops sacrifices, for your Pope Masse: yet do not we in suche an indefinite generalitie, drawe these things that were done in the old law, in the time of the new Testament.
But restrain our selues to the present matter, bring examples therof, out of the old Testament, to proue ye like authoritie in the time of the new.
Aug. doth, your self do the same, it is not derogatorie to the office of Christ, as are the other examples that you do stée vnto.
Neither do we make our obiection so, as allowing it to be lauful for you to flée to ye one: why may not we likewise alledge ye other? for your refuge is altogither vnlawful.
As for our obiection we make it thus: that if you make exception against our examples of Princes, bicause they were so in ye old law, are not dissolued in the new: with what face can you bring exa~ples for your Pope your Masse out of ye old law, which for the points of external sacrificing priesthood, external sacrifices, is cleane abrogated? thus the Protestants obiectio~ is good.
But let vs nowe sée, what you answere there vnto.
VVhat soeuer (say you) was excellent perfect in the old law, that worthily we graunt, ought to be much more in the church of God.
For the state of the church is much more tha~ the state of the Synagog.
But externally to sacrifice vnto god is a perfect thing, therfore it was not only receiued in Moses lawe, but also in the lawe of nature being better.
And that the people of God shuld be gouerned vnder one Byshop, is a point of perfection, for so both controuersies were ended, peace was conserued in the people of God.
But the maner of the sacrifices, by the bloud of beastes external fire, was imperfect those things therfore being reiected that were of imperfection, we saye well, that those thinges are to be retained which in times past belonged to perfection, not indede those in the same kinde and order, but in a higher.
The argument is thus: VVhat soeuer in the old law was perfect, ought to be retained.
But the external sacrifice, but one B. to gouerne, was perfecte, Ergo, externall sacrifice and one B. to gouerne, is to be retained.
Here M. Saunders, first we deny the maior, for neither euery thing, although it were then more perfecte, did still abyde or is yet to be retained: neither your own former sayings agrée here vnto.
You said erewhile, the state before the kings wae more perfecte, and yet that state abode not then, nor holdeth nowe.
And euen here in this argument, you call the state before Moses Law, a state of a better nature, neuerthelesse that state aboade not still, nor abydeth nowe: and ye knowe that the Iudiciall lawe of the Iewes, if they had yet a polytike gouernement, might still remaine among them.
But the Leuiticall and ceremoniall lawe, might in no wise remaine among them.
And yet am sure you will not say, the Iudiciall lawe was the more perfecte, and better than the Ceremoniall was.
Your rule therefore that you builde vpon, is not so perfect and generall as you make it.
To the minor likewise we deny it, whiche consistes in pointes the one, for that which you make perfecte, the other vnperfect.
You make perfect the outwarde Sacrifice, and the gouernement of one Leuiticall Byshop.
But neither of these were perfect, as S. Paule at large to the Hebrues proueth.
Yea, yourselfe M. Saunders doe proue it, and confute your selfe.
The outvvarde sacrifice (say you) vvas a perfect thing, and yet before you called outvvarde things earthly, carnall, corporall, and vnperfecte, and perfecte things, onely inward and spirituall: and that the state of the olde lawe shoulde be chaunged, bycause all thinges were outvvarde and earthly with them, and so they were vnperfecte.
But you thinke to excuse the master with this shift, not that the sacrifices were vnperfect but the manner of sacrificing vvas vnperfecte, bycause they were done by the bloude of beastes, and by outwarde fire.
Why M. Saunders, what is this outwarde manner of sacrificing, but the outward sacrificing it selfe? except you meane the matter sacrificed, whiche was muche more vnperfect, so that neyther in manner nor mater it was perfecte.
But all their outwarde sacrifices were by outwarde shedding of bloude, and burning vvith outwarde fire: No perfection then consisted in those outwarde sacrifices.
And therefore God oftentimes reiecteth them, and preferred obedience and the inwarde sacrifice of the heart before them, euen in that time that God appointed them to be vsed.
Well, say you, yet the people to be gouerned by one Byshop was a point of perfection.
And why dare you not say it was perfection, you shoulde proue this, yt it was a perfect thing.
But then s. Paule wold soone proue you a lyer.
Yea, you woulde proue your selfe a Iewe, and one that denyeth the perfection of Chrystes Byshoprike.
But saye you: the succession of Byshoppes according to fleshe and bloude was vnperfecte.
And nothing else vnperfecte M. Saunders? if you hadde more perfectly marked S. Paule, you shoulde haue founde their Byshoprike altogither vnperfect, and therefore taken altogither away.
But yet say you: Those things therefore of imperfection being cast away, we say well that these things are to be retayned, whiche in times past belonged to perfection, not those things in the same kinde and order, but in a higher sorte.
We graunt you this M. Saunders, in respecte of the morall lawe, whiche belonging to perfection (althoughe man coulde not by reason of his imperfection atteine thereto) remaineth still the same thing, in an other kind of order.
And if ye talke also of the high Byshoprike referred to Christe: one bishoprik likewise remaineth in a higher kind of order, neyther so is sacrifice taken awaye.
For, as we haue one Prieste for euer which is Christ: so we haue one propitiatorie sacrifice, which is the death of Christ.
But if you say this is not still done outwardly as it had wont to be: answere it néede not, bycause it was effectuall once for euer, whiche argueth the perfection of it, for to be done dayly argueth imperfection: neyther lyeth the perfection and excellencie in the outvvardnesse, but as your selfe before and after confesse, the more spiritual, the more excellent: but spiritual sacrifices we haue, and therefore the other outvvarde of the Iewes are gone, as those that were vnperfect, and with the outwarde sacrifices, is the outward priesthood gone also.
But still blundring on with your false principles, you goe forward, to proue that you haue taken the best, left the wor in the priesthoode and sacrifices of the Iewes: saying, For the high B. in the state of the Gospell, is not borne after the propagation of the fleshe, but is elected according to the giftes of spirituall grace.
And our sacrifices consist not in shedding of the bloud of beastes, but in reme~bring the bloud of the immaculate Lambe, and in dayly setting forth after an vnbloudie manner, the substance of the Lambe.
And so that which was spiritual perfecte in the lavv, vve haue not lost· but that vvhich was vnperfect and carnal we haue not kept.
You coine Maximies M. Sanders, speake as one th might kéepe and leaue what he liste, standing still on you former presupposall, that to haue one visible Byshop ouerall Gods people, is a pointe of perfection, and to haue outwarde sacrifices, is also a point of perfection.
But neither of these yet proued, which shuld haue firste bene done, and then might haue entred your comparison, whether those or the were better.
You preferre your Pope, bycause he hath high Byshoprike (as you cal it) not by byrth, but by election, according to the giftes of spirituall grace: but as the election of the Pope verie often hath falne out with so small giftes of spiritual grace, yt al y^ grace was either in the gifts of brybi money, of canuased factions, or of geuing cufes and dealing of harde blowes for it: so the obtayning the highe Byshoprike of the Iewes that descended by byrth, was many times farre the better.
As for sacrifices, where you saye, yours consist not in shedding the bloude of beastes, wha auayleth it, hauing imbrued your mouthes with the bloud of Christ? for if as you pretende you drinke his very bloude, owe are you not bloudsuckers, and your sacrifice worsse than was the Iewes.
Besides the cruell sacrifices that you dayly make, in shedding the bloude of men and Saintes of God, a farre worsse sacrifice than shedding the bloude of beastes.
For, of that, for the time, God was the appointer, but of this the Deuill is the authour, that was an homicide from the beginning.
But you say your sacrifice of Chryste is not bloudie.
If it be of bloude, howe is it not bloudie? if it be not bloudie, owe is it of bloude? It is (say you) in a remembrance of the mmaculate Lambe.
Woulde you stande to this, Maister Saunders, then indéede it were not bloudie, for the rememrance of bloud is not bloud it selfe.
But straight ways you onfute your selfe, and come in with setting forthe the substance of the Lambe.
Whereas Chryste sayde not, his Disiples shoulde sette forthe his substance, but they shoulde et forth his death.
But the death of Chryste is one thing, nd the substance of Christe another thing.
Neither dothe Christe make the Sacrament of his bodie, a sacrifice of his odie, muche lesse maketh he two sacrifices of himselfe, the ne done once for all, the other dayly done: the one for himselfe to exhibite, the other for them to exhibite: the ne bloudie, the other vnbloudie.
These are the sacrifices of our Popes making, prophaning derogaing from the saifice of Iesus Christe, and therfore worsse than the Iewes crifices, that were the figure of it, and for the time were ood.
Now such as is your sacrifice, suche muste needes your crificing priesthoode be.
You haue not therefore as you ake, for your sacrifice and Priesthoode, retained the betr, but haue deuised the worsse, and suche as are starke aught.
As for the other part of the minor, for the estate of Princes aue bene imperfecte, and therfore abolished: you labour proue two wayes.
The one admitting the Prince haue bene greater than the Prieste, in procuring ecclesiasticall matters, what a great imperfection, for diuer causes it had bene: the other by flat denyall, that the Princes were the greater, in administring those thinges that pertained to ecl. matters.
These are subtill spéeches, M. Saunders, and maye be doubtfully vnderstoode.
As thoughe we ment, the Prince were a more principall executer or doer of those thinges.
Whereas we plainely affirme that in the Ministeriall procuration, the Priest was the highest.
But in respect of ouerseeing that euen the highest Priest shoulde doe his duetie: therein we say, the Prince was greater than he.
And that is proued by the first obiection, that your self, M. Saunders, propounde of the Protesntes: neyther doe you denie the truth of the obiection, but shake it of, in saying, the gouernement now is changed, that it was then vnperfect.
Else why do you accuse it of imperfection, if it were then as you wold haue it nowe, the Prieste to be greater than the Prince? and so in chalenging it of imperfection, you grau~t the thing.
Neyther do we deny that ye state of those Princes, was not in all things perfect.
(Althoughe your selfe haue graunted the state of a Monarchie to be a perfect state) but yet the state thereof was in his kinde more perfecte than was the Priesthoode: both bycause it was ouer the Priesthoode, as is obiected, and you haue graunted, and bycause that the Princes estate, althoughe it be taken from Iewes, yet it remayneth still entier with vs, whiche the Priesthoode doth not, nor can do.
First esay you, bycause Priesthoode was more auncient than the kingly right.
For the receiuing of Priests was partly receiued from the beginning, vnder the lawe naturall, yea, before the floude, when as yet there were no kings: partely it had the superioritie certaine ages after Moses, according to the lawe giuen by him, when as yet among Gods people no king was extant, but howe much more auncient a thing is in religion, it is worthily counted so much more the worthier.
This argumente standeth on Antiquitie, whiche beyng drawne from the word of God, and truely applied, maketh a good argume~t.
And would to God you would alwayes make gods word the ground of your Antiquitie, which would sone decipher manie Popishe errors, pretending great Antiquitie, to be but late vpstarts.
But to reason from Antiquitie, in things that are antiquate and outgrowne, to retaine them still being lawfully displaced: and that more is, to reason from Antiquitie to worthinesse: maye be an anciente, but not ouerworthie reason.
For, by this rle, an olde caste coate may be better than a new.
And although you restraine your selfe vnto antiquitie in Religio~, what helpeth this? sith the bloodie sacrifice of a shéepe, as pleading Antiquitie from Abel, might by this reason become a more worthie worship of God, than Baptisme or the Lords Supper.
Yea circumcision and the Passouer should haue bene better Sacramentes than ours, bicause they wore more auncient.
If you your selfe Maister Saunders, had béene auncient, many woulde haue thoughte you had doated, but nowe they will thinke you were to yong a diuine when you made this reason of antiquitie.
But let goe your reason, is your matter true? is Priesthoode of more antiquitie? you say it is euen from the beginning vnder the lawe of nature.
Were it so M. Saunders, said you not in the first Chap. of this seconde booke, that the Ciuil power sprang euen of the law of nature also, wherby the father is superior to his sonne, the vncle to the cosin, the senior to the Iunior? is not this as auncient as Priesthode yea we read of no creation of Priesthoode so auncient.
But you saye, there were no Kings, as thoughe we contended on the name, were he called King.
As for ye gouernors, for certaine ages after Moyses, before the kings, trow you they were al priests? Nay, you shall finde but one priest among them all· And yet you carie awaye the matter so smooth as thoughe they were all priests and saye, the creation of priesthood according to the law of Moyses.
You meane know the common cited place for the Iudges determination in litigious doubts, Deut.
But Moyses there expressely nameth the Iudge, besides the high priest.
And to make you see how ye confute your owne error, in taking this iudge to haue onely or chiefely béen the high priest marke your owne saying: that the state of gouernement from Moyses to the kings, was according to Moyses lawe.
But all that while, of so many Iudges there was but one priest, therefore eyther it was not according to Moyses lawe, or else Moyses law ment not onely nor chiefely the Priests.
And trow you, Moyses law was broken of discerning difficulties all this while, and after the kings beganne to gouerne? thinke you dare not say it was, nor accuse for ye breach of Moyses law, so many godly Princes.
If not, then the discerning of those difficulties, is impertinently alleaged against the Princes superioritie.
And thus not onely your reason from Antiquitie, ut also your matter for antiquitie, against the state of Princes, faileth.
Moreouer (saye you) the Priesthoode was altogether necessarie, that the fygure shoulde at no time fayle.
VVhen notwithstandyng the same people of God myght so haue wa~ted a king, that God complayned that he himself was cast off, when Samuel his Leuite beyng neglected, an earthly king was demaunded.
Priesthood (you say) at no time could be spared, so well as a kings estate.
And why so? bicause it prefigured and admonished Christes eternall priesthoode.
But was there nothing to be prefigured and admonished concerning Christe, but his eternall Priesthood? hath he not an eternall kingdome too? or was not it necessarie to be prefigured admonished, as his priesthood So that by this rule, Kings, or (that is all one in effect wie kings) Princes ouer gods people were euen as necessarie as priests.
But say you gods people might so well haue wanted kings, that God complained he was cast off, when (Samuel his leuite neglected) an earthly king was demanded.
Here is nothing left out ye may seme to make for the defacing of the state of kings.
And yet that which he bringeth against it (as is alreadie shewed) doth the more commend the state therof, and although they might haue wanted the state of a king yet could they neuer want the state of a Ciuil gouernor, no more than they coulde haue wanted priesthoode.
Howbeit, we say not, they might haue wanted priesthood or did want it.
For they alwayes had priests among them, good or bad.
But they alwayes had not priests their gouernors, but very seldome, and that extraordinarily, till the Priest Hircanus was king and priest together.
Besides this (saith M. Saunders) the king was graunted of God, at the peoples petition, to goe out before the people to warre, but not to administer ecclesiasticall matters, for God had prouided for them alreadie by his leuites and priests.
Is there nothing maye be reckoned vp (M. Saunders) besides these twaine, goyng out to warre before the people, and administring ecclesiasticall matters? in déede these two are not very agréeable, although your Popes Prelats iumble them together.
As for the administring eccl. matters, was and is the Priests office, not the Princes.
But besides this, there are manie moe things appointed to the Prince, than to go out before the people to warre.
For if there were no more, what should he do at home in time of peace? breake peace, and still go out to warre? Ha M. Saunders there are other things than warfare, for a Prince in peace to loke vnto, and ye could hit them.
Moreouer (saith he) the Iewes might ascribe to the power of the king, the diuision of the people, the Apostacie of the kingdome of Samaria, and the Captiuitie of Babilon.
VVhervpon they beyng returned from the captiuitie, did not againe chose vnto them a king, that shoulde be counted greater than the Bishoppe, but a Captaine, that shoulde rule no lesse in prophane matters, than in holy things the Bishop shoulde be are the principalitie.
To ascribe the diuision of the people, the Apostacie of Samaria, and the Captiuitie of Babilon, to the kingly power: if it be not of wilfull malice, is of great lacke eyther of skill or consideration, and is a fallacion ab accidenti.
By the like reason, we might accuse the Iewes priesthood, bicause some of them were loyterers, some of them Idolaters, some of them ambitious, yea the most of them, in Christs time and his Apostles, the extremest enemies of the Gospell.
What: shall we ascribe all this to the priesthood? No, nor to any parte therof, but to the naughtinesse of the Priests that abused their priesthood, euen as much, if not muche more than did those kings abuse their kingly power.
The kingdome was lightly neuer worse gouerned, tha~ whe~ Helie being a Priest had the gouernance of it.
And although Samuel himselfe were good and holy, yet his sonnes were wicked whome he made gouernours.
But in the stocke of the Machabées, when the priests ruled all, or the moste, till the approching of Iesus Christ, and so till the dissolution of that state, what a number of wicked Imps were there? you can scarce fet the lyke paterns, excepte you rake hell, or serche the Popes bedroll and his Cardinals, for wicked gouernment.
But (saith M. Saunders) the Iewes after their retre from Captiuitie, did no more chose a king that shuld be counted greater than the Bishop.
Ha, go to then (M. Sau~ders) the king was counted greater than the Byshop before their Captiuitie.
Yea but say you, they chose no more kings ofter their returne.
As thoughe (M. Saunders) after their returne, the matter lay in them, to haue a king or no, and not rather in these kings that had subdued them: who althoughe they appointed or suffered petit rulers ouer them, yet woulde they not suffer them to haue a king.
But whyle they had kings, we reason of those kinges authoritie.
But what reason haue you else, for this is a very slender one.
But this (say you) in this kinde, will make my principall reason, that Christ when he was in this worlde, and fulfilled the whole law and all righteousnesse, yet notwithstanding he would in thinges ecclesiasticall, onely that the Priest, and by no meanes that the earthly king should gouerne.
This were a principall reason in déede, if you could proue this (M. Saunders) but as yet you haue not proued it, and thinke it will be harder than you wéene, for you to doe.
Now to proue it, you reason thus: For he openly refused to administer an earthly kingdome, and therfore fled when he sawe the people go about to make him a king.
And he denied that he was ordeyned to be a deuider betweene the brethren.
But if so be that after the perfecte reason and minde of Moses lawe, it had at least beene comely, either the Churche or the Bishop to be gouerned of an earthly King, Christ would not haue left that thing vnfulfilled.
For it was no harde matter for him to haue administred a earthly kingdome for some very little time, the which when he did not, neither yet omitted he any thing that can iustly be desired to the perfect gouernement of his Churche: It hath neuer beene at any time, or yet is, of any perfection, that an earthly king shoulde arrogate to him selfe any power in ecclesiasticall matters, besides this, that with his sworde he shoulde defende and fight for that whiche is defined by the Prieste· sentences.
And is this necessarie in the Churche (M. Saunders) that the Prince may do thus much with his sworde? But pray you where dyd Christ thus muche, as to fight for the Priests decrees with a sworde? If your reason be good you muste shewe this, or else, why reason you from the factes of Christe, whyle he was héere on earth? if you can shewe, as you promised, that Christe woulde that the Priest, and by no meanes the prince shuld gouerne in eccl. matters: this were to the purpose.
But this you shew not, but would windelace it in with a bought, that if Christ would haue had Princes gouerne in ecclesiasticall matters, he woulde haue bene a Prince him selfe, but he would neuer be a Prince, and yet if he had would, he might: therefore he woulde not haue Princes meddle in matters of his Church, sithe he woulde not mele in matters pertayning to their gouernement.
If this were a good reason, might reuerse it thus, that sithe be medled in their matters, when he had tribute to be paide to Cesar, when he bad his Disciples not feare them that kill the body, when he called Herode Foxe, when he tolde Pilate he had no power but that was giuen him from aboue: therefore they agayne might meddle in his matters, bicause he medled in theirs.
But ye say, Christ tooke not a kingdome vpon him, nor woulde deuide lands, yet he tooke vpon him all things necessarie for his Churches gouernment: what shoulde you conclude hereon? Ergo, the Princes gouernment is not necessarie in Church causes? is this the direct co~clusion? Nay M. Saund. either the co~clusion takes away the Princes gouernme~t fro~ the Church of Christ, or else (which it doth in déed) it hitteth your Pope, if you marke it well, who pretending to follow Christ, taketh an earthly kingdome vpon him, and deuideth landes, which Christ refused to do.
The argument is thus: Christ did al that was necessary, but Christ did not take vpo~ him a kingdome: Ergo, he thought it not necessary.
This is flat agaynst the Pope, but nothing agaynst christian Princes.
The co~clusio~ is good, for it was not necessary for Christ in his person, yet for christian Princes it might wel be necessarie.
It is necessarie for christian Princes (as your selfe co~fesse) to vse the te~poral sword, in the churches defence, and yet Christ him selfe did neuer vse it.
Except you wil say, he vsed it after a sort, when with a materiall whip outwarde viole~ce, he draue the byers sellers out of the temple.
But then replie, that herein he exercised for the while, eue~ the office of a Magistrate, shewed not onely his owne zeale power of his kingdome, but also a paterne to al Magistrates Princes, with what zeale power they shld exercise their authoritie, in reforming abuses in ye church of God.
Although Christ him self did not personally handle the sworde, as they personally may do Neither yet did Christ all those thinges, that his ministers did ought to do.
It is necessarie for the ministers to baptise, yet Christ him selfe (that we read of did neuer baptise any, he could haue don it, if he had thought it necessarie.
What? shal we say wt M. Sand he did al yt was necessary, but he did not baptise, Ergo, to baptise is not necessarie? This therefore is a wrong principle, that Christe must haue done euery thing personally him selfe, that is necessarie to be done in his Church.
True it is, that if Christe neither did it, nor taught it to be done, by him self, nor by his Apostles, but would the contrarie, as M. Sand sayth: then the argument were good, so it confuteth a nu~ber of Popish traditions, that were neither done nor taught by Christ nor his Apostles, but rather yt contrary.
But as for this gouernment of Princes (as M. Sanders him selfe confesseth) was practised in the olde lawe, whiche lawe gaue the Prince his charge therin.
And Christ testieth, yt he came not to breake the lawe, but to fulfill it.
And althoughe he became not a Prince him self (which might haue seemed to haue made or the Popes purpose) but rather condemneth it in his ministers: yet both he him self his Apostles, obeyed the Prince then ruling, which now the Pope denieth statly to do.
But ye say, Christ his Apostles obeyed them not in eccl. matters.
both bicause Christ him selfe was the law maker, his Apostles were the first teachers of it, Princes then were Infidels.
But to reason now from the like state in ye princes that now are christia~, to giue in all things like authoritie to Bishops paors with Christ and his Apostles, is as farre from reason on the other side.
Neither yet do we debarre from Bishops and Pastors that superioritie ouer Princes, that is giuen by Christe and his Apostles to them and their successours, of the administration of spirituall and ecclesiastical things: neither do we (as M. Saunders sayth) giue the gouernement of the Churche of Christe to an earthly Prince.
For bothe the Prince is Christian, and not earthly in this respect, as M. Saunders him selfe confesseth: neither bathe he the gouernement of the Churche, which is dispersed in many kingdomes, but is a gouernour of a parte therof, or of some particular Churche.
Nowe when M. Saunders hath thus proued (as he thinketh) the imperfection of the olde lawe, saying: And thu should these thinges be, if in the olde time the kinges of the Iewes had exercised any chiefe power in ecclesiasticall matters and ouer the Bishops.
He turneth him selfe on the other side, to the flat deniall of this, which in the answere to our first obiection he flatly graunted, and fled then to thy shifte, that the case was altered.
But nowe (sayth he) neither is it true, that the Kinges of the Iewes were counted greater than the Priestes of the Leuiticall kinde, in administring those thinges that pertayned to ecclesiasticall matters: whiche by peece meale will not be greeed to shewe.
It will not greeue you to tell a lye, M. Saunders, but to tell the truthe it woulde be a greefe vnto you.
Where dyd we say, that the Kings of the Iewes were counted greater than the Priests, in administring those thinges that pertayned to ecclesiasticall matters? But go too, let vs sée what peecemeale proues you bring.
And firste (saye you) Moyses commaunded, that after the King was sette in the seate of hys kingdome, hee shoulde wryte oute for him selfe in a volume another cope of this lawe· taking the copie of the Priestes of the euiticall Tribe.
But if not onely other, but the king also him selfe muste go to the Priests for writing out of the lawe, how was the king the prince in interpreting the lawe, the copie whereof he was compelled to craue of other? was he not herein admonished, that he should remember that the priests were his superiours in those things that pertayned to the law? for as euery Magistrate crauing the sworde of the king, receiuing it, doth in so doing declare the king in the right of the sword, to be greater than him selfe: after the same sorte is it, when the king receyueth of the Pristes the copie of the diuine law.
Is this the copie of your piece meale proues M. Sand? he that should take a copie of your argumentes might per haps haue néede, but God wot shoulde finde full slender stuffe in them.
This argument is copied out of Stapleton, and your other collectors, and is already answered.
Which if it were good, bycause the Prince taketh the copie of the lawe from the Priest, therefore in the gouernment of matters pertayning to the lawe, the Priest is aboue the Prince: then is the Register aboue the Chauncelor the Bishop, then is the Clarke aboue the Stewarde, and the Prince, bicause he hath the kéeping of the recordes.
And this is a more like example than that you bring in, of a Magistrate crauing and receyuing the sworde of the king: for in this example the King hath not onely the kéeping of the sworde, but al the authoritie of and lawfull exercise of the sworde vnder God, dependeth on him, and suche as he will giue it vnto.
Wherfore he acknowleageth rightly the King to be his greater.
But in the lawe of God, where the kinges gouernement is appoynted to him, and by that appoyntment of God, he hath interest in matters of the lawe of God, by his kingly office, and therefore must haue the lawe of God about him, to directe his giuerment: and hath not this interest authorie giuen him of the Priest, as the subiect hathe the authoritie and exercise of the sworde giuen him of the king: doth this argue a like, that the Priest is superiour, bicause he muste haue the kéeping of the lawe, and the king, that he may be sure he hath a true copie of Gods lawe, muste haue it of the Priest? Dothe the keeping argue the greater authoritie· The king must haue ye crowne of the kéeper of the crowne, and the seale of the keeper of the seale, is the keeper therefore the greater? Nay it rather argueth (althoughe in looking too, that those thinges be well kepte, and truely declared, they haue a more especiall charge in their offices) yet are they rather inferiours, in that they haue (for the kings behoofe) the kéeping and deliuery of them.
And so the priest hathe an especiall charge of keeping and deliuering to the Prince the lawe of God, bicause of his especiall vocation in the studie, profession, and administration of it.
Whiche argueth more cunning and learning, of duetie to be looked for at his handes, than at the Princes.
And therefore we ascribe not, (as you saye) greater principalitie to Princes in the interpreting of the lawe of God.
But to the Prince is committed a superiour charge of gouerning all persons, to ouersee that the lawe of God be rightly interpreted and administred.
And for this cause the Prince oughte to haue the copie of the lawe, not him selfe to interprete it, and whereto then? to lye idly by him? no, to gouerne him selfe and all his subiectes by the prescription of it.
After this he alleageth the examples of Moyses, Samuell, Iosue, Dauid, Salomon, Constantius, and Theodosius.
In Moyses and Samuell, he hathe nothing that is not common.
To Iosue, Dauid, and Salomon, he vseth Stapletons answeres, and there is answered.
The examples of Constantius and Theodosius, are somewhat already answered, and shall be further God willing, when we come to the practise.
That Christian Princes may be deposed from their estates by the Bishops, and their kingdomes giuen to other, when their gouernment hurteth the truth of the faith and the soules health whereto they are ordayned.
Chapter M. Sau~ders kepeth no perfect method, and therfore we must follow him as he procéedeth.
First he maketh two kinds of men the earthly man, and the heauenly man, and so likewise two kingdoms the one earthly the other heauenly.
The earthly kingdome choseth their king by humaine consent as Nimrod. &c.
Of the heauenly kingdom that Christ hath in the earth, Christ is the king.
Who although by the worthinesse of his nature, he be king of all men, yet is he called onely the king of the faithfull.
Who comming into the world, as he hath not taken away the former nature of ma~ but renued it, so hath he not destroyed the earthly kingdome, but amended it.
Here vpon he concludeth, that earthly kings may be made Citizens of gods Church, and vse all their olde right and most free gouernement, in all those causes that diishe not the faith and Religion of Christ.
They maye appoint at their pleasure lawfull punishments for malefactors, and freely do al other thing, that by the law Naturall, Nationall, Ciuil, or Mnicipall shall be allowed.
To all this, as we agree with M. Saunders: (and therfore gather bt a briefe co~tct therof) so let this by the way be noted, yt he giueth Princes most free Principaliue, thoe causes that not the faith and Religion of Christ.
But to place good Bishops and pastors in gods Churche, to remoue euill Bishops and pastors from gods Church, pu Idolatrie out of gods Gods Church, to set forth suh seruice as is to edifie gods church, to co~mand ye word of God to be read in the vulgar tongue, to reforme Ecclesiasticall abuses, to punishe whordoms, to allow (as honorable) matrimonie in all men, to call councels, to commaund the Sacraments to be vsed as Christ ordeined the~, to ouersée al estates degrées of persons in gods Church to do in al things to the glory of God, to the publique preseruation of the Church, to the faithful administratio~ of their particular callings, doth not diminishe the faith and Religio~ of Christ: Therfore Christian Princes haue most free principalitie, yt is to say supreme gouernment, in al these eccl. so wel as in ciuil causes.
Now yt he hath granted to Princes thus much, which co~prehendeth all the question: he declareth on the other side, what he exempteth from the Bishops: but so subtily, that vnder pretence of debarring them, from hauing authoritie in those things that he ascribeth to the Princes principalitie, he both reuoketh his former graunt to Princes, and conueyeth all those things vnto the Bishops.
Neither Pastors of the Church (saith he) doe intermeddle their authoritie in those things, saue nowe and then to admonishe them and giue the~ faithfull counsell, neither doe we defend, all dominions and kingdomes, to be giuen by gods lawe euery where and in all things, to be subiect to the pastors of the Church, but in those causes onely which would hinder the faith and Christian saluation, except they were partly forbidden, as diuorces, vsuries, and such other sinnes, which the natio~s committe without punishment: partly commaunded, as giuing of almes, the defence of neighbours and chiefly of the poore, the fortifying of the Church of Christ, and Christian Religion, and to conclude, all other things which the lawe of God commandeth and prescribeth as necessarie to saluation.
In these wordes Maister Saunders speaketh cleane contraries, the Princes haue the moste frée principalitie, in all causes that diminishe not the faith and Religion of Christe, and the Bishops doe onely admonishe and giue councel: and yet he ascribeth all to the Bishops, both to punishe all that would hinder the faith, and Christian saluation and to fortifie all that would furder it.
What is not here againe giuen to the Bishoppes, and what is not here againe taken from the Princes, yea their Kingdomes and all in some places, and nothing left for Princes? for what else meaneth he by this? we defend not all dominions and kingdomes to be giuen by gods lawe euery where and in all things to be subiecte to the pastors of the Church.
As who should say some are subiect to them by the law of God, where the lawe of God is flat to the contrarie, that no kingdomes are subiect vnto them.
But as Maister Saunders contrarie to gods law maketh some kingdomes subiect in all things vnto Bishops, so maketh he all kingdomes subiect vnto them, in matters of diuorces, vsuries, and such other sinnes (saith he) as the nations commit without punishment.
Which, as it is a sclaunder to Christian Princes, as mainteining such sinnes, which rather they punishe, and Popishe Prelates both permit and commit without punishment of them: so he ascribeth these punishmentes to the Popishe Prelates, for nothing but for aduauntage, as also the gyuing of Almes, defence of neighbours, and chiefely of the poore.
As thoughe that Princes did not, or could not doe these things, but the Priestes, who by suche fetches, gat all things into their clutches.
Maister Sau~ders hauing thus séemed at the first to yelde vnto Princes great authoritie, and streight to take away all againe from them, and giue it vnto themselues, least Princes might worthily thinke themselues abused, he mitigateth the matter with this reason.
Neither ought it seeme strange to anye man that kings in these matters should obey Christ, for this standeth the~ chiefly vpon, sith otherwise they cannot get eternall life.
As thoughe your Pope Maister Stapleton and you hys riests were Christ.
Good reason it is they shuld obey Christ, otherwise (as you say most truely therein) they cannot get eternall life.
But sith you are not Christ, this reason holdeth not.
But you will say you be Christs, and represent Christ.
Wold to God you were M. Saunders and not rather tichristes.
For if you were Chrittes, you woulde oey your Prince.
And not haue the Prince (in authoritie of gouernement) obey you, whom you ought to obey, since a Christian Prince is Christs also, and in authoritie gouernment, immediatly to Christians representeth Christ.
Thinke you that Princes can not get eternall life, excepte they obey your Pope? so you tel them in dede, make mane Princes afraid therof, by which meanes you haue gotte~ their gouernement from the~.
And thus prtending the name of Christ, you saye: VVen therefore we say, that earthly kings ought to be vnder Christes ministers, we say onely this, that they no otherwise can be saued, neither receiued of Christian people to a kingdome, or oughte to be suffred in the administration of a kingdome, than they both doe and pretermit those things, that the lawe of Christ commaundeth to be done and pretermitted.
If you meane the obedience to the ministers of Christ, no furder than this, to doe and those things that he law of Christ commaundeth to be done and pretermitted: the~ were the controuersie at an end, for this obedience was never denied.
But before you went furer, and would hau the Prince to doe and prete those things that the lawe of the Pope and his Priests would haue done and pretermitted.
you repe, they be of Christ their is the of Christ this would be proued.
M. Saunders, for it is of the chiefest pointes in controusie.
As for Christs lawe, we graunt, that excepte the Prince obey it, he can not be saued.
But, that he which in any one poynt, doth any thing, which Christs lawe commaundeth nt, or any thing, that Christs lawe commaundeth is not to be receiued people to a kingdome or bing receiued, ought not to be tred in the administration of a kingdome: is a perilou doctrine.
For who should th be a king, or who shoulde no be turned oute of his kingdome? For, who offendeth not herein (chiefely expounding the law of Christ as your selues ed in what daunger and thralome to you should kings become? so that it were better be a begger and beg his bread than be a Christian king and rule and be ruled on this wise, if these your rules were true.
But now to helpe the matter you will expound what ye meane by the aw of Christ.
But what the lawe of Christ is, and what it commaundeth.
can no where better be knowne, than oute of their mouth, to whom the sauiour said: Go teache you all nations, and he that hereth you hereth me, he that dispiseth you dispiseth me.
For there neuer want in the Churche, those that eoy the legacie for Christ, God exhorting as it were by them.
For euen as other men so well as earthly kings, are reconciled to Christ by his ministers, and by Christ to God: so they ought not onely to be vnder God, as they were before, but also to Christ, yea and now to his ministers too, for in vaine doth doth he subiect himselfe to Christ that refuseth to obey Christs ministers.
This is true M. Saunders, in the true ministers of Christ, that the Prince ought to obey them in their ministerie, euen as dispensers of the mysteries of Christ and as representers of Christ also.
And true it is, they can or oughte best to tell what is the lawe of God.
But yet are they not so to be heard or obeyed, as they do not represent Christ, or tell their owne awe for the law of Christ.
Wherein the Christian Prince ath an ouersight euer them, and is againe the chiefe miniter and representer of Christ, And as he obeyed them in the ne, so muste they obey him in the other, or else they teache ot the law of Christ aright.
Moreouer (saith M. Saunders) it is not inough for a Chritian king to do those things that priuate men are wont to do xcept also he doe those things that properly belong to the ffice and dige of a Prince.
Euery man ought to serue the ord and walke worthily in that vocation, wherin he is called.
rte thou called in the state of Matrimonie? serue God, not onely as a man, but also as an husband.
Art thou called in the state of a king, thou must serue as thou art a king, and not onely as thou art a man.
But the offices of kings are other, and the offices of priuate me~ are other.
VVhervpo~ saith Augustin elega~tly: The king serueth otherwise bicause he is a ma~, otherwise bicause he is a king.
Bicause he is a man, he serueth him in liuing faithfully.
But bicause he is a king he serueth with making (by conuenient force) lawes, commau~ding iust things forbidding the contrarie.
Euen as Ezechias serued, destroying the Temples of Idols, the high places that were builded contrarie to the co~maundementes of God.
Euen as Iosias serued, he also doing the like things.
Euen as the king of the Niniuites serued, compelling all the citie to appease the Lorde.
Euen as Darius serued, giuing the Idol to the power of Daniel to breake it, and casting his enemies to the Lions.
Euen as Nabuchodonozor serued, in forbidding by a terrible lawe, all men placed in his kingdome, from blaspheming God.
In this therfore kings do serue the Lord, in so much as they be kings, whe they do those things to serue him, which none can do but this we grau~t you (M. Saunders) kings haue another more excellent peculiar seruice of God, in yt they be kings, than haue other priuate men.
But as this maketh nothing against our assertio~, or ye kings estate, but more commendeth it: so it both ouerturneth your principall questio~, for ye kings authoritie in ecl. matters, co~futeth yt you haue said before, in defacing the kings estate, also cleane beateth you fro~ that, which you driue your present drift vnto, of deposing kings.
First, you said before, that kings in that they are kings gouerne all me~ alike, so well Iewes, Mores, Tartars as Christians, haue as equall gouernment ouer ye one as the other.
Here you confesse that kings, in that they are kings, haue especiall seruice of God, and you specifie this their seruice such examples, as declare a farre more excellent seruice, is the gouernment of Turkes, of Mores, and Tartars.
Secondly, this especiall seruice, consisting in such thinges as these examples containe, it argueth the Princes seruice, not onely to intermeddle in eccl. matters, but to haue the supreme gouernme~t of them, and to haue authoritie to reforme eccl. abuses, and to make Lawes to prohibite things contrarie to the Lawe of God, and to commaunde thinges commaunded in Gods lawe, whiche before you ascribed to Byshops, and toke from kings.
Thirdly, if none can do these things but kings, howe dare you take them from kings, and kings from them? how dare you giue them to Priestes? howe dare you giue Priestes authoritie to depose kings? when rather hereby kings haue authoritie to depose priestes, and none can do these thinges but kings, by this your sentence cited out of Augustine.
These things (say you) thus ordered, it shal novv be made plaine, vvith hovve great equitie vve defende, that Christian kings vvhiche gouerne Christian people, ought to be vnder the ministers of Christ, at the least, in those things that appertain to faith and religion.
Yea vnder the paine of losing their kingdome, if fyrst vve shall propounde this one thing.
Hytherto then by your plaine confession, this is not plaine for it, but rather plaine againste it, that kings muste loose their kingdomes, if they be not vnder the Priestes, in thinges pertaining to faithe and religion, that is to saye, (to make it plaine excepte they beléeue, and do as you will haue them, you will plainely turne them out of their kingdomes.
Indaede this is a plaine waye, if you can doe it, as you haue attempted it.
But it is an vnnaturall and a traytorous waye, and of all other farthest from such ways as those should vse, that professe themselues to be Christes Uiars, and Gods Ministers.
Christe neuer vsed it, nor Peter, nor Paule, nor any of the Apostles, and yet were they vnder Princes, that were not vnder them in things that pertaine to faith and religion.
But you will proue this with great equitie, if first you shall propounde one thing.
Goe to, propounde it M. Saunders, and let vs sée the greatnesse of your equitie.
First (say you) both the lavve Diuine and naturall equitie teacheth manifestly, that no other king ought of Christians, of their ovvne accorde, to be called to administer the right of a kingdome, than he vvhich is himself a Christian.
or this is that vvhich the Lord saide by Moses to the Israelites: VVhen thou shalt saye, vvill place a king ouer me, as haue all other nations round about, thou shalt ordeine him vvhom the lord thy God shall choose among the number of thy brethren, neither mayste thou make a King of an other nation, that is not thy brother.
But by brother vve vnderstande, him that a faithfull one, and a Christian.
And although Christians in times past vvere compelled to obey Ethnike Emperours, yet vvoulde they neuer haue committed this, to haue voluntarily called any such men, to the administration of the Empire.
For vvho could suffer it, that the members of Christ, should place ouer them a limme of the Deuil? Verily Iouianus, vvhen after the death of Iulianus, he was saluted Augustus and Caesar, can not (quoth he) sithe am a Christian, gouerne the armie of Iulian, that is infected with the precepts of the pestiferous doctrine.
The~ the souldiors answered, that they wer not stra~gers from the Christian religion.
But if there ought to be so great a likenesse coherencie betwene the head the members, that a christian Emperor wold gouerne no souldiors but christians: how much more vnequal vncomly is it, that the Christian souldiors of their owne voluntarie, should call vnto gouernment an heathen, or heretical man? For what is this else, but to cast themselues in danger of losing their faith.
Al this againe we graunt you M. Sand. so long as you restrain your self to voluntarie election.
And sée that in al your proues examples you kepe your selfe thereto, for else you straggle fro~ your own demau~des.
But how many Princes in Christendome haue you yt be chosen in that sort, of so fr voluntarie choice as you speake of, or not rather their kingdomes belong vnto them, by claime of right succession, or otherwise? And shall these be debarred ye right of their enheritance, for pretence of religion? Well goe to then, what if we say, such such a Prince is a papist, a mainteiner of false religion, differing fro~ Gods truth our profession, therefore we wil not haue him to be our king, although by law he haue good title to it, yea, be in reall possession of it? Wil you allowe this our refusall M. Sand.
If you wil not, then you breake this your own rule, that you would so faine haue graunted to you.
Notwithstanding, where free election is be had, ther your rule is most true.
Let Protestants there choose Protestants, Papistes there chose Papists hardyly, so the one shal the lesse encomber the other.
But where men can not do as they would, there they must do as they may, so nere as theya~, choose whom they think fittest.
But if it lie not in them thus volu~tarily to chose, they must take their lot, perchance of the worsse, praye to God to amend that is amisse, receiue their duetiful Prince with good loyal hearts, yea, though he be an enimie to the Gospel, beséeching God to conuert him, or to mollifie him, to beco~me enclinable, at the least to be no persecuter of ye truth, so praying, for his successe in goodnesse, obey him in truth, dissent from him in ull, but rebel against him in nothing, co~mit ye rest to God that sente him.
And this me thinketh is a better rule of the twaine, than that he hauing right, should wrongfully be refused.
The example that you bring of Iouianus is not alike.
For there is a difference betwéene Princes refusing to be gouernors, and the peoples refusing to be subiectes.
If you can shwe, that the Christian souldiors of Iulianus, as this Iouianus one of Iulians chiefest Captaines, and the Christian souldiors vnder his band, renounced their obedience to Iulan, or woulde not goe to warre against the Persians, and fight vnder his conduct, but reuolt from him, bycause hee was reuolted from God: then you shoulde shew something to the purpose.
But this you can not shew, yea, we can shewe the contrarie, that so long as Iulian raigned, Iouian woulde neuer rebell, nor forsake his obedience, althoughe his Prince were an Apostata, and renied the faithe of Christe.
If you replye that Iouian id forsake his souldiorship in Iulians time.
True it is, that eing a Captaine uer a thousande, when Iulian made a lw for Souldiors: that either they shoulde sacrifice, or for sake their Souldiorship: Iouian chose rather to lse his girdle (which was the ornan nt of his knighthoode) than to obey the wicked prcepts of the Emperor.
Howbeit herein renou~ced not his obedience to his Princes estate, but rather expressed his obedience, in obeying the penaltie of his lawe.
And when the Emperour for necessitie of the warre, chose him againe: he refused not to become againe his soulviour.
Your example therefore of Iouian, maketh cleane against your purpose.
This one petition being thus demaunded, whiche we graunt vnto you in frée elections, although you aske but one demaunde, yet nowe on this you will encroch an other, and set downe the figure of
in your margine, as a seconde demaunde, saying: But the lavve of God, vvhich commaundeth none should be placed ouer Christians, but a Christian: the same lavve commaundeth, that none other should of Catholike people be receiued to the gouernement of a kingdome, but a Catholike.
For he that is a Catholike, althoughe in vvorde he call himselfe, notvvithstanding he hath lefte of to be a liuely me~ber of the Church of Christ.
You aske but one petition M. Saunders, and we haue graunted it, but will you therevpon aske more? nay, then it is time to stop you.
You spake before of a Christian, and now you demaunde the same of a Catholike.
What do you mean hereby? do you make a difference betwéene a Christian and a Catholike? But howe chaunce you saye not, as you sayde before, a Papist? For thinke by Catholike, you meane a Papist, but this we haue gramited you alreadie.
Lette a Papist in free election, if he will needes, chose a Papist: Qui descit sordescat adhuc He that is filthie, let him be filthie stil, and let a Turke choose a Tuke, sithe he will choose no better.
Yet then, let a Protestant choose a Protestant, by your own rule.
But that he that is no Catholike, that is to saye, as you expounde it, no Papist, is no liuely member of the Church of Christ: This is an other question M. Saunders, and you desired to propounde but one and will you now haue so many? You sayde it shoulde appeare vvith hovve great equitie you woulde defende your cause and will you nowe offer greate iniurie to so many Christian Princes, bothe in the East Church, in the Weast, in the South, and in the North, that are no such Cathokes, that is to say, no Papistes, and therefore be no liuely members of Christes Church? Nay M. Saunders, this must not be graunted, there is no equitie in it, excepte you be able to proue it.
For you knowe that the title of Catholike, is not onely called in question, whether it belong to you or no: but also in your sense thereof, for a Papist, it is so sore battered, that it will rather fal out, that the Catholike is no liuely member of Christes Church, tha~ that the Protestante or Gospeller (as you call vs) is none.
VVhiche thinges sithe they are thus, this is moreouer to be added.
Although that any vvhen he vvas first made king, was a Christian and a Catholike, if notvvithstanding aftervvarde he become an Apostata, or an Heretike, good reason requireth that he shoulde be remoued, from the administration of a kingdome among the Catholike people.
They saye the Deuill (M. Saunders) if we giue him an inche, will take an ell, and so playe you.
You demaunde one thing, and woulde take a number, yea, and snatch at all.
If you were not impudent, you would not still encroch.
Firste you desired that you might propounde one thing of greate equitie, and you woulde make all plaine, that Princes mighte be deposed.
Then you desire a seconde thing, for this second, clap downe two togither.
That the same lavve shoulde be also for the Catholikes, that vvas for the Christians.
This also is graunted, to the whiche you adde, that he that is no Catholike, is no liuely member of the Church of Christ.
And although this, in the true sense of Catholike, is likewise granted, yet in your sense of a Catholike, it is starke false and denyed.
and say, moreouer this must be added, that a Christian king being become an Apostata or an heretike, shoulde be deposed.
And this you will haue graunted you also, and al vnder the name of one thing, and this that you adde laste of all, is in déede the thing it selfe that you should proue.
But you worke a wise waye, first demaunde it maye be grau~ted you, and then promise that you wil proue it.
What M. Sanders, haue you gone to Rome to learne that knacke that the Proctour taught his client in the chancellors court? who when a Maiden in sute of contract came to him for cou~sell, he being before hande féed on the otherpartis, graunte (quoth be to her) thou madest him such a promisse, but aske him who is his witnesse.
Nowe when the simple Mayden was thus enstructed: graunt quothe she to the Iudge, made him such a promisse, but who is his witnesse.
The question is, whether a Prince erring in fayth, shoulde be deposed? We denie it.
You will proue it, but on this condition, that we wil graunt you this, that he should be deposed, and then you will proue it, that he should be deposed.
But and if we will graunt you this, you may easily proue it, or rather you néed not proue it at all, for we do proue it for you.
Either Maister Saunders, you thinke· great follie in vs, or this is greate follie in you, to make such propositions to proue the matter, that are the matter it selfe.
This is beyonde the fallation called petitio principij, it is petitio totius, the request, not of a principle, but of altogither.
There is no equitie at all in these proues, for all the great equitie that you promised.
Not that the Apostacie or heresie of the king shoulde be bolstered or allowed, but earnestly improued and rebuked, if it be Apostacie and heresie indéede, and not as you call heresie and Apostacie, the forsaking of your heresies, and receiuing the Gospell of Christe.
But in this your case of Apostacie, howe euer the Prince be worthie to be deposed: the deposition lyeth not in any subiect, or any foreyne, but in God that placed that Prince, and in suche meanes as he séeth good to chastice suche Apostataes withall, eyther of the whole bodie of the Realme, or otherwise: but those are extraordinarie cases, there can be no ordinarie rule of all Princes deposition, as you woulde here haue graunted, excepte the state of the Princes be thereafter, as it is in some Countries, of which sort ours is not.
And therefore to coyne such rules for vs (although our Prince, God be praysed, be not in this case of heresie and Apostacie, saue in your malicious and erroneous conceyte) is euen the Trumpet and warning piece to your trayterous confederates, to pull downe the Prince, and sette vp all Rebellion.
And a means to kéepe all Princes at the becke of the Priestes, for feare they charge them with Apostacie and heresie, and so straight wayes depose them.
But what reason haue you for this hampering of them? For (say you) a faithfull Prince and a godly, is a matter of such mome~t, that neither an vnfaithful, should be placed ouer the faithfull, neither an Apostata shoulde remaine the Prince of the faithfull.
What ought to be, how it ought to be brought about to be, are two things M. Saunders· Prince ought to be faithfull and Godly, and so to be, is (as you say) a matter of great moment.
Neither ought an vnfaithfull Prince to be voluntarily placed of the faithfull ouer the~.
Neither ought a Prince to be a renegate, neither ought such a renegate Prince (in the demerite of his facte) to remaine a Prince ouer the faithfull.
But howesoeuer these things ought, or ought not to be in him: that the Byshops ought depose him, that God hath set vp: that the faithfull people ought to renounce their allegeance, and rebell againste him, that God hath placed ouer them, they haue orderly sworne their homage vnto him: think M. Sand. you can not proue that these things ought to be.
Neither are these cases alike, that you umble togither, of an vnfaithful man, not to be chosen Prince and of a faithful man being chosen Prince by the faithful, bicause he beco~mes vnfaithful· not to be obeyed.
For in ye one case, ye faithful are free fro~ the vnfaithful, if they are bound, it is not to him, but rather to kéepe them fre from him.
In the other case, the faithfull haue bounde themselues before hande to the king that was faithfull, who afterwarde becommeth vnfaithfull.
Whiche bonde if it were conditionall, and the Prince of his own voluntarie so bounde expressely to them, and they interchangeablie bound of their voluntaries, expresly to renounce him, becomming vnfaithfull: Then thinke they might, so it were with one consent of those that chose him, refuse him with better reason.
But where (as it is commonly) the Prince being a faithfull, hath his claime by some kinde of right, whome the people electe without such indenting, on good hope of continuance in his faithfulnesse, or rather being moued with his right, yelde· him obedience, and binde themselues by othe to become his subiectes, there althoughe their soules and consciences be still free to God in religion, yet are their bodies, their goods, yea, and their consciences to, in respect of his estate and their duties, so firmely bounde to remaine loyall and faithfull to the Princes authoritie, that though he become vnfaithfull in the faith of his religion, yet may not they become vnfaithfull, in the faythe of their allegeance.
The Fable of Esopes orse, when he straue with the Hart, can tell you, that there was a difference in the horsses estate, before he gaue the ma~ an enterest to ride vpon him: and after that the man had bridled and sadled him, and was set on his backe, and rode him.
Might the horse then, when he was wéerie with chacing the hart, compell the man to alight, and take off the saddle, and pull the bridle out of his mouthe, and let him goe at libertie? Nay softe, as ye sayde right nowe, the case is altered.
It muste be then as the man will, and not as the horse wyll.
Well may the horse like a stubborne Iade, beginne to fling and winche, assaying to cast the man, and recouer his libertie: but the man with his spurres will tame him well inoughe, and nowe and then an ill ryder spoyleth many a good horse.
Not that he allowed any Princes tyrannie, but that he disalowed all subiectes rebellion.
And so in Samue is declaration, he telleth of many iniuries that kinges shall doe vnto their subiectes, as to take their wyues, their daughters, and their goodes from them, and to giue them where it lykeeh them.
Not that kinges ought to do thus, or that God or his Prophet alloweth their so doing.
But that they which were frée before, and might haue chosen, should then not be frée, and could not choose, but suffer euen iniuries at their hands.
Neither could they, nor their Priestes depose their Princes, although many of them became Apostataes and tyra~ts.
Yet those Apostataes and tyrants continued stil their princes, till God him selfe by some extraordinarie meanes remoued them.
But (say you) there groweth no lesse daunger to the subiects from him, who after he is placed in the royall Throne, falleth to heresie: than from him that was an heretike before he was made king.
graunt you this, M. Saunders: and the case maye be suche, that there may growe farre more daunger too.
But daungers must be cut off as we may, and not as we list.
If we can vndoe Gordias his knotte, we may not play Alexanders parte, and drawe out the sworde, and strike it in wayne.
The knotte of a subiectes obedience is an harder knotte, but by this remedie it might be soone vntied.
And yet peraduenture tye our selues faster in greater bondage, if the Princes vsed not Alexanders vntying, and cutte off suche traytors heades from their shoulders, that would cut off him, béeing the head, from gouerning them, béeing but members of the body.
But howe proue you your consequence, M. Saunders? And truely (say you) if the Apostle tooke it in euill parte that the Christians shoulde go to lawe before nsidell Magistrates, that were ordeyned before hande by publike lawe: howe muche more vnworthy would he haue taken it, if they shoulde either of their voluntaire haue placed ouer them an Infidell, or haue suffred an obstinate heretike to haue raigned ouer them: for howe can they worshippe him as their king without haynous sinne, to whom they ought not to say so much as God speede, least they should be partakers of his euil workes? or is it not a greater matter to obey an heretike, than to salute him? These two places are wrested (M. Saunders) and the Scripture abused, to make them serue for subiects deposing princes, and refusing of their obedience.
S. Paule rebuketh the Corinthians, for that they beeing Christians contended in law for trifles, and chose heathen Arbitrers and Iudges, rather than Christians, and this in déedé was blame worthy, bicause not onely they had frée choyce, but men also among themselues, that could with more quietnesse and lesse reproche, haue taken vp those matters.
But doth S. Paule bidde them in no matters, appeale to heathen Iudges, or beeing called of heathen Magistrates to their iudgementes, to refuse them, yea to refuse to come vnto them, and to renounce them as incompetent Magistrates and Iudges, bicause they were not Christians, and to attempt to disobey them, or to depose them? At this you should proue (M. Sanders) if you will directly apply, and not wrest this place to your purpose.
The contrarie he both taught others, and him selfe practised.
For he himselfe obeyed the authoritie of the heathen and wicked Magistrates.
He refused not to come before the iudgement seates of Felix, Druslla his wife, of Festus, of Agrippa Bernice his sister.
Yea he reioyced that he came before the~, saying: Aboue all things wherof am accused of the Iewes, counte my selfe happie, king Agrippa, that this· day shall pleade my cause before thee.
Likewise he appealed to the wicked Nero his iudgement and presence, when Festus offred him to go to Jerusalem, be iudged before him there.
He answered: stand at Cesars iudgeme~t seate, where it behoueth me to be iudged.
And as he appealed to him, so he obediently was iudged of him, neuer refused the Princes iudgement as inconuenient, bicause he him selfe was a christian, those princes were heathen: but bicause they were princes, he was a subiect· he obeyed their iudgements euen to death.
And as he did him selfe· so exhorted he all other to the like obedience, that also for conscience sake, althoughe those princes had little conscience, were Infidels, yet he acknowledged the~ to haue their power fro~ God, to be his ministers, the resistance against the~, to be against God him selfe.
So farre was S. Paul fro~ attempting or exhorting, or thinking to depose the~.
Nay he rather praied for them, wisheth other to pray.
The like we may say for al ye Apostles of Christ, whom Christ foretolde that they should come before kings princes, but he forewarned the~ not to refuse to come before them.
This place therfore is manifestly wrested of you M. San.
And that you shuld not suspect my iudgeme~t, appeale here in euen to the iudgement of your owne side.
Lyra writing on this place, maketh this obiection: Sed istud Apostoli dictum. &c.
But this saying of the Apostle seemeth to be co~trarie to that which is said·
Be ye subiect to euery creature of ma~ for God, whether it be to the king, as to the chiefe, or to rulers as sent of him. &c. to the which is to be said, that the Apostle forbiddeth not this, that the faithfull being placed vnder vnfaithful princes, shuld not apeare before them, when they are called: for this were co~trarie to the subiectio~ that is due to princes.
But he forbiddeth, that volu~tarily they make not recourse to vnfaythfull Iudges in those matters, that may be determined by the faythfull.
Yea Catharinus that wresteth this place also to the Priestes prerogatiue, yet durst he not goe thus farre as you, M. Saunders, but maketh playne exception agaynst you, saying: Insuper annotandum, &c. Moreouer wee muste note, that the iudgementes of the vnfaythfull, are not heere refused, sithe they also haue their power from God.
Neither forbiddeth it that they should not obey their rulers, when they call them into lawe, or shoulde the leste be vnder their iurisdiction.
But onely it forbiddeth this, that they shoulde not of their owne accorde appeale and come to them, as before whome to pleade, sithe they haue them selues a better power giuen them heereto of God.
Thus by the iudgement of your owne side, this place serueth nothing for refusing the obedience of Princes, although they were Infidels, Apostataes, or Heretikes, as (thankes be giuen to God) the protestant Princes are not, agaynst whome ye shoote these trayterous bookes, but are true christians, faithful christian Princes.
As for the other sentence maketh lesse to your purpose· For he speaketh not there of princes, but of false teachers· as for princes, by S. Paules doctrine· aforesayde, wi whome S. Iohn agréeth, they should bothe be saluted, worshipped, and prayed for, that God would spéede and pr per them in their gouernementes.
And this (as ye say) more then to salute them.
But sithe we are bounde to the greater (to vse your owne reason) muche lesse may debarre the lesser from them, and not so muche as say, speeds them, or giue them nce God morrowe.
Which as· is besides all ciuilitie (that you say Christ taketh not awa so were it wilfully to prouoke the Princes indignation· Abimelech was but an Heathen prince, and yet Abra dwelte with him, made a league with him, and gaue him a present, and toke a present of him.
Pharao was an heathen Prince, and yet Ioseph behaued himselfe most reuerently vnto him, and became a moste faithfull stewarde ouer his countrey.
Ahasuerus was a heathen Prince, and yet both Mardocheus honored him, and preserued his life from traiters, and Hester was maried vnto him.
Benadad the king of Syria was an heathen Prince, and yet Naaman his captaine, after he was clensed from his leprie, and was become a faithfull beleuer in God, forsoke not his obedience to his heathe~ Prince, and where he moued a scruple of suffring his Idolatrous Prince to leane vpo~ him, the Prophet had him depart in peace, he had him not reuolt fro~ his Princes obedience.
Darius was an heathen Prince, yet Daniel sayde vnto him, king, God saue thy life for euer.
Agrippa was an heathen Prince, and yet S. Paule both saluted him, and wished him euen as himselfe, except his bondes.
This therfore is not to be stretched vnto Princes but to be take~, as it is spoken, against false teachers, as both the text is plaine, euen the Popish writers to so vnderstand it, althoughe they misvnderstand who the false teachers be.
But who they be, S. Ihon describeth by this note, Euery one that goeth from abideth not in the doctrin of Christ, hath not God.
He that abideth in the doctrine he hath the father and the sonne: if any come vnto you bring not this doctrine, receiue him not into the house, neither say God spede vnto him.
For that saith God spede, communicateth with his euill workes.
But this is apparant that ye Papists haue made the doctrine of Christ insufficient, and brought in other doctrine besides the scripture of God: they therfore are these false teachers, yt S. Iohn so straightly forbiddeth vs to communicate withall.
If then God spede may not be saide vnto the false teachers (yt is to say, we may not approue their doctrine, nor be familiar with them:) the~ must the Popish teachers companie be auoided, yt are here so plain described.
And it were to be wished· this were some what more straightly loked vnto tha~ it is· God graunt yt bearing to much with Papists, bearing the~ company, yea and bearing the~ out also, do not only spice vs with their false doctrin (he that toucheth pitch, saith the wise ma~, shalbe defiled with it) make vs partakers of their euill workes: but also prouoke the heauie wrath of God vpon vs, make the Papists whom we beare so much withall, become the very cutters of our throates.
For tell you, their faith will serue them, they haue a ruled case for it, Nulla sides tene~da haereticis, no faith must be kept with heretiks, as they accou~t vs to be.
But learned once this rule in mine Accidence, oelix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautu~.
Happie is he who~ other mens harms do make to beware.
Let vs not thinke but they can loke as faire, thinke as foule, in England as in Fraunce, deale as horribly, if (as God forbid) they could get their oportunitie.
Which to compasse the sooner, this good teacher M. Saunders setteth forth this doctrine, to sturre the people to rebel depose their soueraigne, hereto wresteth these places of the scripture, to make them seme to serue his purpose, where both (being better considered) make cleane against it.
The matter (saith he) is nowe brought to this point, that an hereticall king must be remoued from his kingdome, that he obteyneth ouer Christians.
But how he hath brought the matter to this point, with what proues not worth a point: doubt not, but euery reader wil easilie sée, nor any subiect be moued to remoue his naturall Prince, for any thing yet alleaged, yea although (as he surmiseth) his Prince were in déede an heretike.
But M. Saund. presupposing that he hath cléerely, proued ye Prince must nedes be deposed will now proue that the deposing of him belongeth to the Bishop.
And bicause (saith he) the crime for the which he must be remoued, is co~mitted against the faith: a little before it is abundantly proued, that those causes shuld not be iudged of the people, which is gouerned like sheepe, but of the pastors, whose dutie is to discerne betwen the cleane vncleane, and whose lippes do therfore kepe knowledge, that the people should require the lawe of the Lorde out of their mouth, verily it belongeth chiefely to the Bishops, both to pronounce euen the king himself an heretike, or otherwise an Apostata, also to declare that his subiects fro~ thence forth are free fro~ giuing all obedience vnto him, that they ought to endeuor themselues, that another out of hand be chosen in his roome.
Euen a fit sentence for so fit Bishops to pronounce.
Finde you me this in the law of the Lord, (M. Saunders) that the priests should kepe this know ledge? and yet better kepe it than vtter it, to make the Proclamation of rebellion.
Is this the law, the people must fetch from the priests mouth? well, this lawe made some of them be hanged at Durham not long ago, as all such lawlesse and rebell Priests deserue.
No, M. Saunders, ye finde not this fraiteros office appointed to the Priests in gods lawe.
Out of their mouth in deede the law of God must procéede, their lippes must kepe it, they must discerne betwene the cleane and vncleane.
Although this be but here spoke~ Metaphorically, for that was a bodily cleanneste vncleannesse discerning who was a Leper who was none.
But stretch it hardily to the soule, admit also he finde the soule of the king infected with spiritual Leprie, must be therefore pronounce him to be no king? nay, trow, the priest serued not Ozias so.
Must the Priest depose him? must be assoile his subiectes fro~ their sworne obedience· must he bid the~ chose another· where find you this M. Saund· in what law? in Robin Hoodes lawe, or Iack strawes law? surely it is some rebels lawe, for in gods law you can not shew it that Priests should do such things.
No? say you: It is a matter of faith, who should deale therein but ye Priests? Is this a matter of faith, M. Saunders, to sturre the people to violate their Faith? cannot the Faith be kept to God, except we breake our Faith to the Prince? you aske, who should do it rather tha~ the Bishop? where of all other he should least do it, to say truth, none should do it.
But if any will attempt rebellion, Popish Priests, sée, are readiest, and here M. Saunders offereth himselfe and his fellowes.
But in gods word, we finde no such office for Priests or for any other, we sée there no such example, saue of Corah, Dathan, and Abiron, of Absolon, Ioab, Achitophel, and Abiathar, and suche other traytors, whom God punished accordingly.
Godly Priests rebuked euil Princes, but they neuer offred them this iniurie.
But if the subiects (saith M. Saunders) loke not in this matter to their duetie, then it belongeth to the pastors, by what meanes so euer they can, to prouide, that he that sittes in the chaire of pestilence, should not raigne in the Church of God· Yea there M. Saunders there lo, if neuer a Captaine for traitors can be found among subiectes, the Priestes will be their Captaines, and will rebell alone, if none other will besides.
Do the Prince but once displease the Priests, then his royall throne, wherin God hath set him, is the Chaire of pestilence and the Priests will prouide another king, and that by all whatsoeuer meanes they ca~, they wil attempt al waye possible, by practises, conspiracies, whisperings, murmurings, railings, blind prophecies, curses, treacheries, seditions, treasons, rebellions, murders, sorceries, pysonings, to conclude, by what meanes soeuer they can, (for these be his owne words) to depose the Lords annoynted, and to set another of their confederacie, for all these meanes they practise, haue practised, do practise, and therfore now they may pleade practise for the~.
If this doctrine be not the chai of pestilence then out of doubt it is eue~ the pestilence itsel All the deinls in hell can not deuise to the sclauerie and confusion of al· kings, and to the maintenance of the Popes ranie, sitting in y^ very chaire of pestilence, a more pestilent doctrin tha~ this is.
Now as though this wer so clre a case that it were not to be so much as once spoke against: What (saith he) is not the matter thus? what? do not pastors vvatch for soules as vvell of kings, as of the~ that obey kings? Yes that they do (M. Saunders) as it appeareth by youre tale, they vvatch for soules and bodies, and goods also, chiefly of kings.
The Deuill vvatcheth not (as Peter saithe) more narrowly, seeking vvhome he maye deuoure, than doe your Pastors kepe bothe vvatche and warde, to deuoure bothe kings and subiectes, and to rule all wordly kingdomes.
Then (say yeu) it is their duetie to let slip naught of those things, that they knowe are profitable for the soule health.
This indéede is their duetie (M. Saunders) whiche consisteth in preaching Gods worde.
But this they can let slip well inough, howbeit the matter now in hand, is a worldly kingdome, and that they will not let slippe in any wise, least they should let slip those thinges, that they knovve are profitable to the bodies health.
But vvho seeth not (say you) that it abhorreth altogither from the soules health, that he should be suffered to raigne ouer the faithfull, that is himselfe vnfaithfull? must not then also of necessitie, the people become vnfaithfull? There is no necessitie M. Saunders, but it is a shrewde likelyhoode.
But firmum fundamentum Dei stat. &c. the foundation of God standeth sure, hauing this seale, God knovveth vvho are his, and God will preserue those that are his, from assenting to such Princes vnfaithfulnesse.
Howeeit, the swaye of the people, turne to much after the swaye of the Prince, whiche is a perilous case, as we sée where po, pishe Princes raigne, and it is a iust plague of God, propter eccata populi. &c. God maketh the Hypocrite to raigne for the peoples offences.
But againe, where the Prince doth fauour and set forth the Gospell of Iesus Christ, there redoundeth much commoditie to the people, by the Godly Princes gouernment.
But vvhen (saith M. Saunders) Ieroboam the king of Saaria, erected tvvo Idols in Dan and Bethel, vve knovve that herevpon almost ten whole Tribes fell into Idolatrie, and by litle and litle cast off the faith of one God.
Shal he therfore be worthy the name of a man, that shall affirme a wicked king ought not to be compelled to depose himselfe from his Magistracie? Can you make this conclusion on this example, M. Sand? then are you worthy the name, not of a man, but of a cunning man, wil not say of a traytor.
But what can not you make, quodlibet ex quolibet, what you please, of what you liste, to serue your turne withall? Ieroboam we graunt did make the people fal to Idolatrie.
But did any Priest or Prophete, taking occasion herevpon, rebell, or prouoke other to rebell against him, or did any of them depose him, or sought to set vp an other? if you finde this, you finde somewhat for your purpose, if not, the example maketh cleane against you.
The Prophets indéed rebuked the king, and that sharply, spake against his Idolatrie, and tolde him how God would cut off his kingdome.
Yet they themselues attempted not to cut it off, but peaceably obediently liued vnder his gouernment.
Yea, this deposing of a Prince, whome God set vp, was so far from any subiectes authoritie, that it was not lawful for Roboam, to whom the kingdome before appertained, to attempt to recouer it by law of Armes, but he and his people by Gods especial commaundement, were bidden go home againe.
So much this example maketh against you, and yet you are so impudent to alleadge it.
And that herevpon the king muste not onely be deposed of other, but by other be compelled to depose himselfe, and that he which shal not affirme this, and that on this example of Ieroboam, is not vvorthy the name of a man.
But he that will not play the rancke traytor, and wrest the examples of the scripture for him, that make cleane against him, hath no ma~hood in him, nor is worthy ye name of a ma~ with M. Sand.
And now as though he had brought an inuincible proofe, he procéedeth, saying: But if he must needs be deposed, at least for heresie, hovv shall that controuersie be iudged, without the knowledge of the doctors of the Church? who only of their office, haue the ordinarie lawful power to loke to the flocke, in the whiche the holy Ghost hath placed the~ to guide the Church of God.
But the pastors doctors of the church, could not be Iudges of any king, except the king in that thing, were lesse inferior to the~.
For neither the equal hath power ouer the equal, neither the inferior ouer the superior.
VVorthily therfore we affirme, that al christia~ kings, in those things that appertaine to matters of faith, are so vnder bishops priests· that when offending obstinately against the christia~ religion· they shall perseuer after one two rebukings: bothe they maye, and they ought for that cause, to be by the Byshops sentence deposed from the gouernement that they holde ouer the Christians.
your argument is this, if the Prince must needes be deposed, he must be deposed by the Bishops priestes.
This reason hangeth all on this presupposall, yt he hath so fully proued this, that ye Prince nowe in all post hast must nedes be deposed· And yet we haue hitherto heard no such proues, yt should enforce any suche necessitie, but rather necessarie, for ye bishops, priests, or any other subiects behalfe, to let him remaine still vndeposed, for them, although he were an heretike.
If nedes he must not be deposed: the must not ye bishops priests attempt to depose him.
Howbeit ther is no necessitie in ye co~sequence, yt if he must nedes be deposed that for heresie, yt ye bishops priests must depose hi. Yes, saith M. Sa~. for how shal that co~trouersie be iudged without the~, what thogh that co~trouersie could not be iudged without the~ M. Sand. must they therefore be deposers of him fro~ his estate, bicause they iudge of the doctrine he professeth? must they iudge of his Diademe, bicause they iudge of his religio~? but what if they the~selues haue corrupt iudgements therein? trow you priests bishops haue not had so ere now? yes, eue~ this sentence of s. Paule that here you cite for ye Bishops and Priestes authoritie giueth a plaine warning of it.
knowe (saithe he) that after my departure, shall come among you rauening VVolues, not sparing the flocke, there shall rise vp men from among your selues, speaking peruerse thinges to dravve Disciples after them.
But (say you) saint Paule saith they must looke to the flocke, so much the more, in vvhiche the holy ghost hath placed them to guide the church of God.
True in déed they must so do But what if they be blind the~selues, how loke they to it then? And did Christ neuer talke of blind guides? you post off yt, to the Phariseis Iewish Bishops.
But if you were not more blind tha~ they, you would sée a great difference betwéene loking to the flocke, guiding the Church of God by teaching true doctrine, taking heede vnto, and discerning of false doctrines and teachers, preching the worde of God with learned iudgement: and betwéene the clayming of authoritie to depose Kings and Princes fro~ their royal estates.
Whie, say you, if they be Iudges, they are aboue them, and neither equall nor inferior.
They may be equal, and aboue them too, in learned Iudgement, and also in ye dispensation of their misteries: yet in publike authoritie far inferior.
And therfore your conclusion secu~dum quid ad simpliciter, faileth: that bicause they are inferior in one thing to Bishops, they be in al thinges, or in this thing inferior.
Yea, say you, they are so vnder Bishops and Priestes, that when offending obstinately againste the Christian religion, they shall perfeuer after one or two rebukings, the Bishoppes may and ought to depose them from their gouernment ouer Christians.
This is a great inferiorship, M. Sand. to be so much vnder them.
For by this rule, if a Prince (as co~monly Popishe Princes doe) shoulde kepe a Paramour· a Popishe Byshop may depose him.
But they wil not be ouer hastie, to reproue the Prince for that, which they vse themselues, neither cou~t they it an offence against christia~ religion, yet in ye christia~ religion is forbidden, so is against it, especially to defend it, mainteing it as the Papistes do.
But if he do wrong to any of his subiectes, wil not amende his wrong, after a B. hath once or twise giue~ him warning of it: then by this rule the B. maye straighte depose him.
And in déede so they haue done, would do, if the wrong touch them, if their lands and goods were diminished, then by by it is against ye Christia~ religion, it is plaine heresie, except by the seconde admonition, it be restored with a recumbentibus: the king must be in al the hast deposed, there is no remedie nor further respit, for not only the Bishops may, but plat plaine they ought to doe it.
Is not here a kingdome brought to a goodly state? But he wil say, he meaneth by offences against the Christian religion, matters of faith.
But what helpeth this? for, as whe~ the Lion proclaimed, yt al horned beasts shuld auoyd out of the wood, although the Foxes pricked eares were no horns, neyther néeded he haue gone, ye he wisely foresaw, yt this was but a drifte to picke a quarel, therefore he hied him out of the wood.
For since al lay in the Lions interpretatio~, what if the Lion had said, his prick eares had bin horns, or as sharp as hornes? surely then the Fox had dronke for it.
And if the Byshops may haue the like authoritie, to bid the Prince be packing out of his realme, if he offend the christian religion: what will it boote the Prince (if the Bishops be disposed to picke a quarel against him) to saye, he offendeth not againste the Christian religion, but rather defendeth the true religion of Christ, against the corruptions of it? and in déede so he doth, but what auayleth eyther his excuse, or the truth of the matter, if the Bishops shall say it is heresie, and against the christian faith, the Bishops that so say, shal be the Iudges, whether it be so or no? were not the king as good get him out of his kingdome at the first, or else they will depose him set him out with a heaue ho? But that Bishops may thus hamper Princes as they list, where find we authoritie or example in the scripture? yes saith M. Saunders: For God, which at the firste so seuered the heauenly kingdome from the earthly kingdome, that he suffered the kings of the earth, to come togither against the Lorde, and againste his anoynted, and thereby notably declared his power, while by the base things of the worlde (thatis) by the pouertie of the Apostles, and the tormentes of the Martyrs, he ouercame the mightie things the same God within a while after, did so ioin togither his heauenly kingdome, with the earthly kingdome, that there also he might shewe no lesse, both power and mercie: while some kings voluntarily made themselues subiect to the pore Ministers of Christ: But other refusing at the first to be made subiects vnto the~, yet by the spirituall power of the~, were either afterwarde conuerted to repentance, or else vvere hurled downe from the high degree of the Empire they possessed that euery waye it should be true that God reuealed to Daniel: In the dayes of those kingdomes, the God of heauen shall rayse vp a kingdome, which shall neuer be destroyed, his kingdome shall not be giuen to an other people, but it shall frush, and consume al kingdomes, and it shall stande for euer.
This truely is the kingdome of heauen, or the power of the Church of God.
It is euen so M. Sand· and therefore not suche a worldly kingdome, as your Pope vsurpeth, you proule for him to mainteine: but the heauenly kingdome of Christe, and the power of God, which is his Gospell, shall frush and consume your kingdome with the other.
Nay (say you) they did indéed once iarre, but now they agrée, the heauenly and the earthly kingdome, are conioyned togither.
Agréement is a good hearing, M. Sand· but what meane you by this coniunctio~ that the one is become the other, and not still distinguished from it? or that your Pope may be king, and his Byshoppes Princes of bothe? nay M. Sand. you finde not that agréement and coniunction.
For Christ hath put such a barre betwene them, that his spiritual Ministers, can not haue earthly kingdomes, nor that earthly kings, shoulde in the estate of their earthly kingdomes, beco~me subiecte in such wise to his spirituall Ministers: otherwise than to yelde their obedience to their spirituall ministerie, representing the power mercie of God vnto them.
But not to resigne their crownes vnto them, not to be troden vnder their feete, not to be deposed of them, and driuen out of their earthly kingdomes.
The spirituall kingdome of Christ it selfe, (much lesse the spirituall ministers of that kingdome) dealeth not with earthly kings in such a fashion, which is not to agrée or ioyne wyth them, but to conspice against them.
You tel vs of some kings, that haue voluntarily yeelded the~ selues subiectes, some that were compelled and driuen out of their kingdomes, but was this done (as you saye) by the pouertie of the Apostles, and the tormentes of the Martyrs? True it is that by these base things, God ouercame ye mightie things of the world.
But trow you yt they by their pouertie deposed kings, by their suffering torme~ts, draue the~ out of their realme? that were a harde matter.
But name the Apostle, name the martyr, name ye king, name the kingdome you can.
No, you can not· But you shal finde the centrarie, for if they were in pouertie, then were they not rycher than kings: if they suffered tormentes, the~ they put not me~ to torme~ts they were torme~ted, not torme~ters, sufferers, not doers of the~.
Neither suffered they as malefactors, for co~spiring against kings, for going about to haue deposed kings fro~ their kingdomes.
Are you not ashamed, your Popes being rycher tha~ kings, crueller than tirante, to tel how God ouercame the mighte of the worlde, and increased his spirituall kingdome? this was Gods doing, not mans, and by cleane contrarie meanes to your doings, and to cleane contrarie purposes, not to storish in an earthly kingdome, or to dispossesse kings, as al your drifte doth tende.
But you haue examples hereof, howe you broughte kings to this thraldome, but for shame ye durst not name the~, ye stories were so tragical.
But now, this being co~trarie to Christes prohibition, he propou~neth an obiection himselfe in our behalfe, answereth it.
Thou vvilt say, do therefore By· hoppes and Pastors of the shepe of Christ, rule temporal kingdomes? properly indeed, and of it selfe, in no vvise.
But thus do Byshops rule temporal kingdomes, if so be such kingdomes do submit themselues to the Christian faith.
For euen in this, that Christian kings and nations do desire the faith Sacraments of Christ, they promise heerein, that they vvill neither gouerne, nor obey any earthly gouernment, further than the Christian faith and religion may suffer.
If therefore either the gouernement of the king, or the peoples obedience, begin to svvarue othervvayes, either they may be deposed from their gouernment, or most iustly excluded from the povver of choosing a king, by the force of the couert, or expressed couena~t, which at the beginning they made vvith the Church of Christe.
For vvhat soeuer is so much of the nature of the thing that is done, that if by chaunce mention vvas made thereof at the beginning, it can not othervvise agree, than by that one vvaye: vvhich although it were not expressed betvvene the bargain makers, yet is it holden for expressed: bicause it was necessarily contained in the nature of that that was done.
man saith to a vvoman: take thee to my vvise: she againe making answere, take thee to my husbande: But that they shall liue togither, euen till death, although this expresly is not vttered in the couenant, notwithstanding it is so contained in the nature of the thing, that it is necessarily vnder stood.
After the same maner it is, when either the king, or any priuat man, is made a member of the church by faith baptisme.
For euen in that, that he renounceth the worlde the pomps thereof, verily he promiseth, that he will neuer abuse the power of his earthly kingdome, againste the faithe and church of Christ.
And if so be he shall do it, he wil not refuse but that he may be depriued of the right of his kingdome.
Softe, M. Sand· we must interrupt you, or els we ca~not so co~ueniently answere you.
To your question anon, now to your argument, and your theren.
The obrection you made, was this: whether Bishops and Pastors of the sheepe of Christ, may rule temporall kingdomes? You answere: properly, and of it selfe, in no wise.
But as those kingdomes do subiect them selues to the Christian sayth.
This is a proper elusion M. Saunders, thinke you to escape thus? is it all one to subiecte their kingdomes toe Christian fayth, and to subiect their kingdomes to the Bishops? Good it is that the fayth should beare the héefe rule.
But the obiection was, whether the Bishops should, or no? and therfore this inction serueth not.
For Christ simply, without this or y^ respect debareth al his spi ritual ministers fro~ ruling of te~poral kingdomes.
Who knoweth not, that properly and of their owne nature, temporall kingdomes should not be ruled of spirituall pastors, but of te~poral king? None is so simple, to moue such a fond obiectio~.
But the obiection is, whether the one be coincident to the other.
Whether a Bishop to who~ properly by his Bishoply office, kingdome belongeth not, may take vpon him the gouernment of a kingdome, that properly by his kingly office belo~geth to a king.
And you say, properly he can not, say muche vnproperly.
But properly or vnproperly, Christ hath clea debarred it, Vos autem non But you shall not do so.
These words strike dead, master Sand· therfore your vnproper distinctio~ may go pike him.
But (say you) when they subiected them to the Christian fayth, the kings promised no longer to raygne, the people promised to obey no power further, than the christian fayth wil suffer: therefore if the kings power, or the peoples obedience swarue from this promise· the king may be deposed, and the people can choose no other ll good promises (so as we may) are to be kept iniolate, master Saunders, especially the promise made to Christ, to kéepe his fayth and religion incorrupted.
And would to God, all men did kéepe it, chiefly the Popishe Byshops, that haue in so many poyntes, swarued from the fayth, and corrupted Christes religion, yet haue made their promise to keepe it so well as others.
And if they shoulde be deposed for breaking their promise, your Pope should be deposed first, to begin withal, and all his Prelates Priestes should followe.
And althoughe it were to be wyshed they were in déede all deposed and those onely that repent them, admitted, and reformed to the true ministerie yet can not the like be wished for in Princes, that they likewise breaking their promises, shoulde be deposed by their Bishops.
For, althoughe we haue in Gods worde, an euident example for the Prince to depose the Bishoppe vpon his demerites, as Salomon deposed Abiathar: yet haue we not the like example for the Bishop to depose the Prince.
For in ye authoritie of deposing, the Prince is higher than the Bishop.
Although it is not to be wished, ye Princes should attempt without great and euident proofe, to depose any.
As for the Bishop to take vpon him to depose his Prince, béeing his sworne subiecte, is bothe agaynst his owne fayth and homage, and further than his authoritie reacheth.
The Bishops and Priests had great iniurie offred them of king Saule, yet they neuer cursed him, nor attempted to depose him.
No, Dauid (although he were him selfe also the Lords anoynted) would neuer oppugne Saule, or rebel agaynst him, but only stode at his defence, and when he had Saule in his daunger, he would neither kill him, nor take him, nor depose him, but let him go, and committed his quarell to the Lorde, bicause Saule was not onely likewise the Lordes annoynted, but then in lawfull possession of the crowne.
And therefoe Dauid woulde neuer take it from him, althoughe he had good title to it.
Muche lesse may the Bishops, (that haue no title to it) attempte to pull downe their Prince.
They may, yea they oughte to exhorte their Prince, hauing broken his promise, and rebuk him, and lay before him the terrible threates of God they may pray for him· but they can not lay handes vpon him, nor curse him, nor reuile him, nor take armes agaynst him, nor inite other to rebellion, to forsake him, and to set vpon him, beeing their Liege and Soueraigne.
am not ignoraunt, that Princes haue bene deposed of their subiects in diuers cou~treys, and diuers times in Englande.
And the like casualtie may chaunce in euery age and kingdome vnto princes.
But for those things, by what title they were done, God knoweth, will not descant nowe, but this affirme in generall, that in respect of the people, those things were more defcto, than de ure· although in respecte of Gods iustice, or of the Princes chastisement, that ad deserued (before God) so muche and more, it was de ure too.
But the subiects can neuer iustifie such deedes to be done, howe euer they be borne out when they be done, nor such extraordinary deedes past, may be drawne to ordinarie examples of deedes to come, but be spectacles for princes in beholding suche tragedies past, to learne for the present to umble them selues, and to leuell their life to come the better.
And althgh many of these deposings of princes, haue ot come so by the vce of their vnnatural subiects, as by the practises of the Popish bishops: as the ensamples of king Iohn in Englande, of Childerike in Fraunce, the Henries and other in Germanie, and in other countreys, do testifie: yet were these dealings of thse Bishops not allowable, but detestable, ye though it were graunted that those prince ha deserued them, broke~ their faith and promise· Which (if it were a good faith promise) was no doubt an euill breace of it, an God will take the vengeance of it, it belongeth not is the people, nor to the Bishops.
He sayth not, my Bishops shall, but will render it.
Yea but (sayt M. the Prince himselfe hathe made a promise, to raigne no longer, than the fayth and religion of Christ alloweth.
aunswere if he ma this pryse; it is a good promyse, and he is bou in conscience to stand ther.
But what if wickedly breake his promise, shall the Bishope rebell· and breake their promise too? is there no remedie, but pellere, to driue out one mischiefe with another· Nay saith S. Paule· Non faciamus malum, vt inde eueniatbnu~, Let vs not do euill that good may come of i· Let vs notbell against the Prince, that the Prince may be reformed.
If the Bishops do so, they heape Ist damnation vpo~ themselues.
Were the Prince in déede such a one as the Bishops pretend, (if it be not rather their malicious pretence) as God hath giuen them no such violent meanes to reforme him, which were to make him rather worse than better, and to bring all in a broyle, and themselues (besides their sin) in daunger· so God hath giuen the~ another meane, if they could see it, of preaching his word vnto the Prince, which is another maner of sword, and more fitte for them to fight withall, than to pull the temporall sworde oute of the Princes hands.
In dede so did Cardinall Columne, when the Pope said he woulde pull of his Cardinals hatte, he soul the Pope word, if he pulled off his Cardinals hatto, he would put on a helmet, and pull downe his triple Crowne.
These Prelates haue little skill of the spirituall swrde, although they crake of it, and of S. Petrs keyes, but they neither know how to vse them, nor what they be, that thinke they consist in deposing Princes and fighting against them.
But M. Saunders, not seyng the of his owne Bishops faith and promise· beginneth narrowly to exmine the faith promise of Princes· Go to th; let vs sée what he layeth to ye Princes charge.
He made promise (saith he) that he would be no longer king, tha~ he faith of Christ.
And the people promised to suffer them, furd han the faith of Christ.
they this promise· M. Saunders? Baptism (say you) where they promised to renounce the world, and the pompes therof In dede Saunders they made this promise· their Bapti· to enounce th orld and the pomp this, suppose you an your Bishops also.
How you haue kept it, not onely God you in your conscience know: but all the world séeth how you haue broken it.
And if your deposing lay on that promise in Baptisme, surely ye shoulde all be deposed out question.
But am sure, you wil make exception for your worldly kingdomes, pompes, and dignities, that here you write for· and kepe: that you will not renounce them, for all that promi, and will say, there is nt, not but the ambitious mind in getting and keping of them.
Whh am although you still retaine, with infinite other pen yet not willingly depose your selu from those worldly: promotions, deposed fro them.
And can you make these exceptions, excuses and distinctions, for the retaining of yours your Bis poralties, and will not allow them in the Prince, for the retaining, of yours are cessorie· vnto yours? is partiall and dealyng with Prin M.
But how prue you, that Prines promised to their kingdome, if they should forsake the faith and that the their promised to nounce their· rebell their Prince shoulde might forsake the (say you) is contaied in of the thing that is promised.
And here you speake somewhat darkly, like a lawyer, quote vs vp lawe out of Pomponius in your margin, and to make the matter plainer, you bring in the ensample of a contract in mariage, betwen the man and the woma~: the man saith, take thee to my wife, the woman saith, and take thee to my husband.
In these wordes here is no naming of continuance and ye this contract it is comprehended· Your law rol, and your ensample are good, M. Sau~ders, but your is all.
For in the nature of the promise at Baptisme: of authoritie, or obedience, is either named hended.
There is, graunte a contract made for thefrmei of all their liues, to kepe the faith of Christ, and this all their liues they ought to kepe.
But that they promised either nounce their owne estates, or their Princes estates, for the breach of this contract: that is neither spoken nor thought vpon in baptisme, nor is contained in the nature of it.
For Christ, nor the compacte with him, brakes not the Ciuill and poe state, of mens gouernment or obedience but rather it.
As for Kings, are not ommonly king at their Baptisme, nor are made kings by Baptisme, (except you speake of spiritual kings, as they are mysticall members of Christ.)
and now and then, he that is a king, was a priuate persons chrde, and no man knew at his Baptisme, that uer he should become a king: as for the· had least all, any suche intention: howe could thn of renouncing a kingdome, be entended in his promise at Baptisme? and muche lesse on the subiecte behalts: for if in their promise at Baptisme, should be entended the condition of refusing obedience to their Prince then daid be a thing, that neither lyeth in their power to performe (for all subiectes can not for sake their obedience, and they woulde neuer so aine) neither if they would and could, they should refuse it.
It is not (as Dottor Story, farre vnlike a lawyer, and farre more vnlike a Christian, said at his subis choice and power to forsake his Princes obedience and his countrey, and goe whether he lyst, to liue under what Prince he fansieth: for by this anes, all policics may be soone dissolued, and subiects were euen as good rebell against their Princes, as goe their way from them, and forsake their subiection to them: They made no suche promise at Baptisme, to forsake their Princes authoritie· though should beme an infidel: To forsake his and all others infidelitie, not to obey him, or any other, in his this they promised, but not to forsake him in his authoritie: but rather their authoritie, being an ordinance of d, and their obedience to their magistrates, whatsoeuer they b, beyng also gods commaundement, they are by their Baptisme, not to forsake it.
Princes also, all subiects are u~d in baptisme, to renounce all other sinne, as long as they liue to cleaue to al other vertues, this is directly comprehended in their couenant.
If now the Prince or the people after Baptisme, shall forsake any vertue, clean to any n, they be therfore deposed from their estates? who should not the be deposed? Let vs take your owne example of mariage, The ma~ saith to the woma~, take thee to my wife, the woma~ saith to the ma~, take thee to my husband: here is (say you) no menction made of co~tinuing togither till death and yet it comprehended.
In dede M. Saunders in these words yt you cite, it is not me~tioned, but both in yours and our order of marying, eue~ those words also be by name expressed, till death vs depart: God hath expressed them saying: who~ god hath ioyned, let not man separate.
But there are other wordes also, not entended onely, but expressed, as these, whiche the man promiseth, that he will loue the woman comfort hir, honor kepe hir. &c. the woman likewise to the man, that shée wyll loue, cheryshe, honour obey him.
These things eyther do promise to kepe to other, these things belong to ye nature of y^ contract also. disobey hir husband, or not, honour him, as she hath promised and ought to do: if agains the man loue not hir, or cherishe hir not, as he hath also promised and ought to doe: neither onely brackes fall ou betwéene them, but also he ise coutinueth the man forsake the other, the promise mae in the contract is and yet they are (in the contract made betwene them) bound to as a of those vertues, as to that No, they are not und ther, forsake the one thi other
In which case they may forsake· they may be conciled, and continue together.
ut (you in this case of swaruing from the the subiect and the Prince may not continue together· the man and the woma~ are by their contract in mariage, knit inseparably togither, (especially as the Papists mae the contract, that it is neuer vndone, for any vice, no not for whordome, although they graunt, there may be in nne, but déede a separation:) so the Prince and the ubiect, being contracted togither in the polycie of a the one faithfull gouernement, the promising faithfull obedience, notwithstanding all their vices, that fall out afterwards betwene them, may not be ieane parted a sunder, the Prince from his authoritio; the suiect from his obedienc, but till their liues endes, most together· and as the priest an not but, by your owne makes againste you.
But now ay n, and moue your question, M. Saunders.
aske (say you) if this by name, should come in questio~, whether this shoulde, not necessarily be aunswered to that King, which would become a Christian? Let it be, that King Lucius come to Blessed Eleutherius the Pope, yea or else king Clodoueus to Blessed Remigius, and desire them selues to be admitted into the societie of the Christian people.
But let vs suppose, that the Blessed Eleutherius or Remigius answere to eyther of them: we are glad (most deere Sonne) that thou desirest to be made a Citizen of the kingdome of heauen, but this thou oughtest to knowe for certaintie, that the case is not ke in the kingdome of heauen, as it is in the worlde.
For in the Church, thou must liue so, that thou make captiue thy vnderstanding to the obedience of aith.
But thou, how greater thou arte in the world, maist so much the more hurt the Churche of God, thou shalt abuse the right of thy sworde, to the defence of heretikes, contrarie to the Catholike faithe.
No otherwise therfore maist thou haue entrie into the Church, than if thou shalte promise, that thou wilt persist in that sah, and defende that Church, with all thy force, which being receiued from the Apostles, is continued by the succession of Bishops vntill this daye, and dispersed throughe oute all the world.
But if it shall chance thou doest otherwise, thou shalt not refuse, but shalt go from the right of thy kingdome, and promise to lead a priuate life: here if the King Lucius make answere: am ready to acknowledge the Christia~ faith, but neither promise that will defend with my sword, the Catholike faith neither will (for whatsoeuer shall do) giue ouer the righte of my kingdome.
Can the Bishop to this man thus affected, minister the Sacrament of Baptisme, and deliuer the sacrament of thanksgiuing? can he therfore be a member of Christ, that will not submit his Scepter vnto Christ, and refuseth to serue him? Your example and your question hang not together, M. Saunders to your last question, answere, that he can not be a member of Christe, that will not submit his Scepter vnto Christ, and refuseth to serue him.
But what is this question to your former question, of submitting himselfe to the Byshop to depose him? there is greater difference, betwixte Christs Scepter, and the Bishops Crosier, than betwéene the Kings Crowne and the Bishops Miter.
But to come to your examples which drawe somewhat nerer to your purpose.
First, trow you, that these two examples, of King Lucius and Clodoue, will answere al thse and serue for all Kings? suppose they will not· For these kings receiued Baptisme, being of lawfull yeares, and ight haue made a voluntarie graunt, to all that you prsuppose, your Bishops would haue demau~ed of the~, so might haue snarled themselues in their briers and bondage.
But yeuta~ not presuppose ye like of infants, especially of those infantes, whose parents were Christ Princes before, who are baptized long before they are kings.
And althoughe they might order y^ child, as ill as they ordered y^ other, yt rawly came to Christe~dome: yet would not the parentes being alreade Christened, bring their Children in such bondage.
Neither could they demand it of a childe, which was not a king, nor perchaunce borne to a kingdome, but gat it afterwarde by prowesse.
For although Clodouen was Baptized by Remigius: yet was not Lucius baptized by Eleutherius, but either by the two preachers which Eleutherius sent, or as it rather appéereth, by ye content of Eleutherius letters, King Lucius was himselfe a Christian before, therfore Eleutherius sent them not as Legates, nor sent any such conditions by them, nor any lawes or ceremonies of the Church of Rome, but referreth y^ King to the word of God, and was so farre from taking vpon him to be gods Uiar, ouer the King his kingdome: that in plain words be yeldeth that authoritie title to King Lucius.
And as for Clodoueus, though he call Remigius his patrone author of the discipline and Religio~, bicause he baptized him in structed him therin: yet as for any such couenant or condition, not to admit him to the faith of Christ, except he woulde sweare before hand, that if he would not defend the Bishops their faith, he shoulde forsake his kingdome, and promise to leade a priuate life: Remigius conditioned no such thing, no more than Elentherins before had done to Lucius.
For when Clodoneus being an infidel, and yet hauing a Christian wise which made him somhat more enclinable: being in battaile against the Almaines, making his vowe to Christ in his distresse, to receiue the Christia~ faith, if he should get the victorie: which being obtained, and he returned home with triumph, willing to receiue the faith of Christ: his wise made hast to Remigius ye Bishop of Remes Lxhorting him (saith onius) forthwith to come to the Court, that while he wauered yet in suspence, he would open to him the way of truth, that leadeth to God: for (she said) she feared, least his minde puffed vp with prosperitie, while he knoweth not the giuer of these things, he should contemne him.
For things that fall oute as we would haue them, fall out of our minde likewise, in continuance of ryme, more easilie than those things, that fall out otherwise than we would.
The Bishop hasteneth to obey the admonishing of the Religious woman.
He presenteth himself to the sight of the King, that nowe a prettie while had aboade his co~ming.
The faith is declared by the Bishop, the meanes of beleuing is taught.
The King also acknowledging the faith, deuoutly promiseth that he wl serue one God.
As for the peeres of his Realme armie, he will proue his opinion, which what it is of this matter, he affirmeth, that so muche more denoutly they wold submit their neckes to Christ, how much more they should see the~selues to be prouoked with intreaties, rather tha~ with terrors.
The condition pleaseth, a publike calling forth of the people is made by the Kings co~maundement, to whom the King maketh an oratio~, persuadeth ye people to receiue the faith of Christ, moueth them to submit their neckes to Christ, the priest reioyceth, that the King not yet baptized, is beco~e an Apostle of his owne natio~ so the King is baptised.
What condition is here made by the Bishoppe vnto the King, of giuing ouer his realme, deposing himselfe? which might haue done more hart tha~ good.
In what counant did the people here binde themselues, to looe the liberti of chosing their King, or promise to forsake their King, if their King forsake the faith? here was no such bondage red, ther to the King by the Bishop, and the King thought good to offer none such to the people, but with gentle persuasions to allre them.
So that these presupposals of these Bishops speaches vnto these Princes, are vtterly false, and forged, onely to driue in the readers heads, a surmise of seme suche conditionall admission to the Christian faith, in these elde Princes dayes, whiche was nothing so nor so.
And yet by these colourable presupposals, he enforceth his matter with a question, aying: Can the Bishop to this man thus affected minister the sacrament of Baptisme and giue the sacrament of thanksgiuing? Why, M. Sau~ders, here was no such condition moued, yet Remigius gaue Clodoneus the sacrament of Baptisme· In deede the sacrament of that kgiuing, he gaue not then vnto hym, neyther was it necessarie till he were instructed in the mysterie of it.
And therefore this is as fondly added in this case, to the Sacrament of Baptisme, as your case of Baptisme is craftily and maliciosly deuised, to bring Princes in bondage vnto Bishoppes.
But this King, thoughe he and his people submitted their neckes to Christe, yet did he not thus submit himselfe and his people to the Bishoppe.
The long promiseth to one God, but not to eyther the Bishop of Remes, or the Bishop of Rome· These knackes and conditions of bondage, for Princes to promise and weare obedience to the Pope and to his Bishops, yea to sweare to depose themselues and become puate men, if they forscke this consrained obedience: is of later times, as the Popes power and tirannie hath growne, and hath to Christian Princes, great hulie but ls in manye Christian kingdomes.
But yet it neuer went thus for as it now should do· if M. Saunders might haue hie minde, for it was neuer vrged in their Christdome before.
This pasieth ye slauerie of the Spanish Inquisitio~, that no Prince nor people shuld be christened, except they swere to these exceptio~s.
In the olde time when the Prophetes anoynted kinges, they tolde them of the blessings of God to come vpon them, and their posteritie to sitte in their seate after them, and that God woulde buylde them an house to continue, if they serued him, and walked faythfully in his wayes.
And if they should do the contrarie, howe God woulde rende the kingdome from them, and giue it to another.
Of suche promises and threates that the Prophetes tolde the kinges, we reade, and of the promises that the kinges made agayne to God, we reade: but that any Prophet compounded with the king before, that he shoulde renounce his kingdome, or that any king tooke either their circumcision or their kingdome on suche condition, or that the king reuolting from his promise, either voluntarily, or by compulsion deposed him selfe, or was deposed of the Bishop, Priest, or Prophet of God: these thinges can not shewe vs, but these thinges ye shoulde shewe vs, if ye will make good your sayings, and directly proue your purpose.
You tell vs heere a tale of a tubbe, in the name of these kinges Bishops, that they neuer dyd, nor (I thinke) dyd euer thinke of any such deuises.
But go too, let vs nowe presuppose with M. Saunders, euen as he imagineth.
The Bishop sayth: VVe are glad (most deare sonne) that thou desirest to be made a citizen of the kingdome of heauen, but this thou oughtest to knowe for certayntie, that the case is not like in the kingdome of heauen, as it is in the worlde, for in the Churche thou muste liue so, that thou make captine thy vnderstanding to the obedience of fayth.
But thou how greater thou art in the worlde, mayest so muche the more hurte the Churche of God, if thou shalte abuse the righte of thy sworde, to the defence of heretikes, contrarie to the Catholike fayth.
No otherwise therefore thou mayest haue entrie into the Churche, than if thou shalt promise, that thou wilte persist in that fayth, and defende that Churche, with all thy force, which beeing receiued from the Apostles, is continued by the successio~ of Bishops vntil this day, dispersed through out all the world.
But if it shall chaunce thou doest otherwise, thou shalt not refuse, but shalte go from the right of thy kingdome, and promise to leade a priuate life.
M. Saunders nowe presupposeth that the king (hearing the Bishop thus beginne to indent with him) will beginne his answere to the Bishop thus: am ready to acknowledge the Christian fayth.
Why, M. Sand. is not this inough? if the Bishop séeke something else besides the acknowledging of the Christian fayth: Surely he neither séeketh the glory of God, nor the Princes saluation, nor ye encrease of Christendome, but his owne sucre authoritie.
Well, the Bishop will haue him graunt to all the residue of his conditions, or else he will not baptise him.
But neither promise, that will with my sworde defende the Catholike fayth, neither will (for whatsoeuer shall do) giue ouer the right of my kingdome.
Ye tel the kings tale parcially, M. San· you should make it flatly to denie that, whiche the Bishop exacted of him to do.
Which was, to promise to defend, not the faith but that faith, that Church, &c.
Which the king denieth, to make promise vnto the Bishop on suche condition.
Yea? saith M. Sand. saucely steppeth in for the B. can the B. to this man thus affected, minister the sacrament of baptisme? &c.
if the bishop be not worse affected him selfe than this man is? for you graunt your selfe, that he is wel affected towards the christia~ faith would acknowledge it, which is al one with defending it.
And if the bishop be not content with this promise, hath not ye king good cause to suspect him? he telleth him of bondes conditions to be made, to renounce the right of his kingdome, if he pere not in that faith with al his force, if he defe~d not that church, that was receiued from the Apostles, continued by successio~ of B. till this day and dispersed throughout all the world.
May not here the king (as it is likely, by M. Sand. tale, he hath witte wisedome inough) begin to smel a rat, think with him selfe: what should he meane to put this differce? freely offered to receiue the Christian fayth, and he wyll not take this offer, but wyll haue me receiue that faith, and that Churche, that (he sayth) was from the Apostles, and is continued by succession of Bishops till this day, and is dispersed throughout all the worlde.
Why, and is not this the christian fayth, and the christian Churche? If it be, offered my selfe to it before, but he refaseth my offer.
Then surely this is not that fayth and Church, that he meaneth.
And why should he rather haue me bounde to the Apostles, (if they were Christes Apostles than to Iesus Christ him selfe? shal be baptised in their names? why should binde my selfe to Bishops succestors which what they haue ben, how ill, or how welsome of them haue succeeded their predecessors, knowe not, nor will sweare for the~.
And why shoulde then sweare vnto them, rather than vnto the fayth of Christ, who is the chiefe Bishop of our soules? And why should binde my selfe to Church dispersed throughout all the worlde? What meaneth he by this? the greatest and mightiest multitude? or the lyttle flocke of Christ scattered in euery Nation? or be it greate or little, why should he bind me more to men, than vnto Iesus Christ? And why requireth he to these things, (as if it were, euen to Christe him selfe, and to the fayth of him) the defence of all my force, and what meaneth he by this force? that shall for all these thinges, gather all my power, and make sharpe warre, where, and when he co~maundes me? and that shal oblige my selfe to al these conditions, on the forfeyture of my kingdome, and depose my selfe from my ght, become a priuate man, and leaue the office charge yt God hath called me vnto, for leauing of these things.
Yea that if should not wilfully do otherwise, but if should chaunce to do otherwise.
And what if he would threape vpon me, that chaunced to do otherwise? Surely, surely, this is not playne dealing with me, nor any good meaning to me.
He seekes not my saluation, but my kingdome, that thus would snarle me, and is not content that fréely offer to acknowledge the Christian fayth.
What if the King would cast all these coniectures, master Saunders? trow you he hathe not good occasion ministred? yea, what if the King héere vpon, béeing thus refused of the Bishop, examined these thinges throughly? shoulde he not finde foule holes in your coate? tell you, it would touche you to the quicke.
And perhaps it had béene better for the Bishop to haue taken the kinges frée offer, and without suche conditions to haue giuen him his baptisme: for else he might haue it of some other Bishops hands, that had learned of Christ, not to breake the broosed reede, nor to quenche the smoking flaxe, nor to caste off, by suche indentinges, this godly disposed Prince, but with all humilitie and diligence, to receiue, instruct, baptise him, yea and bewray all your Popishe iuglinges.
And what had ye gotten then, by these your proude conditions? hathe not your pride and couetousnesse made you make a faire market, and loose so riche a pray? But nowe let vs yet admitte your presupposall further.
The Bishop refuseth, except on these conditions, to admitte him.
The king séeth there is no remedie, he receyueth these conditions.
What is his dutie nowe to do, but with all his force to persist and defende them· What is that? for sooth, that fayth and Church, which beeing receyued from the Apostles, is continued by the succession of Bishops, vntill this day, and dispersed throughout all the worlde.
Nowe sithe this is his charge, and he is bounde to obserue it with all his force, on forfeyture of his kingdome: is it not reason, that he examine and boulte out, which this fayth and Churche is.
Especially since he heareth that there is great co~trouersie about these matters, and that there are both wise, learned, famous men of both sides.
Yea? sayth he, if the case be not cleare, that am so strayghtly bounde in, it standes me vpon, to looke to this geare better, and to heare bothe parties say what they can, that may know and be sure, that keepe my promise, and not to forfayt my bonde.
What now (for his better assurance) shal the prince do? must he not here, call bothe the parties before him, say to the Bishop that tooke thi promise of him? Lorde, you remember what promise you made me make vnto you, or euer you would baptise me.
And nowe heare say, the oyntes that you made me promise, to defende with all my force, and to persist therein, are litigious.
You holde them one way, and your aduerfaries another way: you say, your fayth and Church, is that faith and Church, that was receiued of the Apostles, for howesoeuer the succession of Bishops haue helde it, and whersoeuer it hath bene dispersed, the receipte of the Apostles from Christ himselfe, perceiue, is the first and principal condition, that promised to persist in, and to defende withall my force.
The other twayne must both depende on this chiefly minde therfore to kpe this, the other as they shal agrée hereto.
But here your aduersaries, on the other pt, and offer to proue it, that your faith and Church is not that faith and Church that the Apostles receiued and deliuered, but a faith and Church egenerate, and swarnedfromit.
And therefore if you will not be youre selues the cause, make me breake the promise that ye made me take: ye muste cléere your selues of that· your aduersaries obiect against you, and confute them.
And you she Bishops aduersaries, on the other side, must bring foorthe youre prooues, and defences of youre faythe and Churche, and shewe good reason, why should not impugne your fayth and churche, and defende theirs agaynst you.
And héere for equall dealing betweene you bothe, béeing parties playntife or defendaunt, neither of you your selues shall be your owne, or your aduersaries Iudge (for the one were partialitie, the other iniurie) neither (whom the matter, bothe for my office, and for my promise and forfeyture, toucheth nearest) will be your Iudge, but an indifferent hearer of bothe parties.
And bicause you bothe admitte the Scriptures to be Gods worde, and both the Apostles fayth, and the Apostles Church, is manifestly recorded in the Scriptures, and Christ also willeth vs to search the Scriptures, for they beare recorde of him: the matter shall be determined by the Scriptures.
Both of your faihes and Churches shall be leueled by that platforme, that shall be there apparantly expressed.
And as the Scripture shall strike the stroke betwéene you, will minister rightly, to saue my promise.
And will deende wth all my force, that fayth and Churche, that finde in déede receyued from the Apostles, and will extirpate with all my force, that faith and Churche that is degenerate from it.
What if the King saye thus, master Saunders? trowe you the Bishop hearing this (whiche notwithstanding is but righte and reason, and the King euen of the Bishop enforced thereto) will he accepte the offer? No, master Saundess, the Bishoppe will crie oute, and so will you, that the matter shall not goe thus, and that the King may not doe this, howsoeuer it stande him vpon.
But you will appeale from him, vnto your selues, as Iudges.
Whiche when the King shall heare, will not iudge this a madde appeale? and suspecte your cause the worsse? and thinke that you playnely woulde abuse him? And so, to kéepe his promise made vnto you, turne his force iustly agaynst you? Haue you not heere made a rodde for your owne tayle, if the Prince be but indifferent, and not too muche, either of simplicitie or dastardie abused by you? And thus by the righteous iudgement of God, your owne tyrannie is the cause of your owne plague: and that by the seife meanes, whereby you woulde vniustly haue hampered the Prince, he hathe iustly hampered you.
pray God all Christian Princes woulde once take these iuste occasions, to examine well, but euen those dueties and tyties that you put vnto them, and woulde but minister iustice to you, euen as you ha forced them thereto.
And thus muche, M. Saunders, for your presupposed examples, betwéene these Kings and Bishops· Let vs nowe beholde howe you procéede vpon them.
How therfore said the Lord in Daniel? kingdome, and power, and the mighte of kingdome, that is vnder all the heauen shall be giuen to the people of the Saincts of the Hyest.
VVhose kingdome is an euerlasting kingdome, and all Kings or powers shal serue and obey him.
Howe saide the Lorde (as it is in Esay) vnto his Churche? The sonnes of straungers shall buylde thy walles, and the Kinges of them shal minister vnto thee, and their sonnes that haue broughte thee lowe, shal come and bowe them selues to thee, and all those that spake euill of thee, shall worshippe the steppes of thy feete.
Howe shall the worde of Christe be true, wherein hee sayde too· his Disciples, hee that despyseth you, despyseth mee, or that that hee sayde too Peter: Thou arte Peter, and vppon thys Rocke wyll buylde· my Churche, and the ga, of Hell shall not preuayle agaynst it.
You are a waster, Master Saunders, to make suche lauishe of youre prooues so impertinently, or rather, you are wrester too applye them so falsely.
For the Kyng that héere refuseth the Bishoppes conditions: offereth hym selfe moste freely too all obedience that is héere mentioned, in offering himselfe to acknowledge the Christian saythe.
As for the Lordes sentence in Daniel· prophecying of the immortal glorie, that after the iudgeme~t of Christ, shal be giuen to the Saintes of the most highest, and of the obedie~ce to Christes euerlasting kingdome: these are other matters, are so wrested of you to the state of this lyfe, that it will breede you some suspition of being a Millenarie heretike, except you say you ment it spiritually.
But howsoeuer you meane it, you doe great iniurie to kings, and shew no lesse arrogancie in your selues to applie that vnto you, that is spoken of the Saincts of the highest.
This kingdom and power, that he speaketh of, is theirs, yea kings, so well as any other be partakers of it, and you claime it allonly to your Priestly and Bishoply power: whereas it is rather to be doubted, that ye shall haue no parts at all therof.
But your portion in the kingdome of proude Lucifer, that not onely apply this to your selues: but also the glorie and kingdome due to Christe, of the obedience to whiche, Daniell playnely speaketh, and you wrest it to the obedience of your Bishoppes.
As for this obedience to Christe, the king did offer to yelde it, in offering to acknowledge the Christian fayth.
And you to helpe your bishop and to dismay the king, make the bishops demaunde suche a necessarie thing, that you aske, howe dyd the Lorde speake in Daniell, except kinges should offer to renounce their kingdomes vnto priestes? What, master Saunders, waxe you so sawcie with God, to argue him of a lye, but the saying of God is true, and you are lyers, and the king may still keepe his kingdome from your Clutches.
Your seconde texte is a couple of textes, out of Esay, but no lesse wrested than the other, to make Princes stoupe to Prelates, and kisse the grounde they goe vpon, to giue Bishops Kings treures and dominions, and make kings to waite on Priestes.
In déee on this wife your Pope did proudly wrest the Scripture, when he troad on the Emperors necke, when he turned downe hi Disdeme with his foote, when he made him daunce attendance and blowe his nailes at his gate, when he made him hold his lurrop, whe~ he made him leade his horse, when he made him kisse hys gowtie, should say his golden toa.
But this was more than Neroes pride, is most farre from gods liking, from Christs humilitie, from the Apostles steppes, and cleane from the Prophetes meaning.
The Prophet speaketh of much honor and riches to be giuen, but to whom? tibi, thee.
Who was this, the Priest or Bishope haue you any moe shée Bishops, or Pope Ioanes yet, M. Saunders? for the wordes of the Prophet begin thus: Surge, splendida esto.
No, M. Saunders it was euen the wife of Christ, the Church of God, whome he calleth Sion, that the Prophet speaketh vnto.
These texts therfore being spoken to the Churche, that is, to all the faithfull people, of whom kings themselues are part so well as any other: it is malapartly dne of you Maister Saunders, to ascribe it only to your Bishops.
Howbeit, this arrogating the name of the Church to your selues is not so sacis, but your missunderstanding of this description in a literall sense, being spoken of a mysticall estate, is no lesse grosse than full of errors.
The whole chapter hath many suche proises, of shyning, of glory, of glittering, of riches, of waters, of Camels, of coltes, of golde, of frank insence, of shepe, of ramines, of does, of ships, of buildings, of walles, of gates, of beeches, of Pines, of boxe, of sucking, of milke, of brasse, of stones, of Iron, of light, of the Sunne, of the Moone, of plantes, of trées, such other worldly things, whereby be discribeth the beautie and florishing estate of the Charche, according to the manner of the Hebrewes phrases, and the capacitie of the Iewes, that were moued by suche worldly things Nowe commeth Maister Saunders, and picketh me out two sentences, and sets them togither, being in the text a sunder: That the sonnes of strangers shall build vp thy walles Kings shall serue thee.
And to this he addeth the other sentence in the same Chap.
And the sonnes of them that afflicted thee, shall come to thee humbly, and shall bowe themselues euen to the plantes of thy feete, eue~ all they that dispised thee, and call thee the citie of the Lorde, Sion of the holy Israell.
Had you set the sentence downe thus farre, you had marred al, Maister Saunders· For then you had bewrayed your wresting of this vnto ye Bishops.
And had you set downe all the chapter, you had shewed suche inconueniences in vnderstanding this glory of the Church and seruice of Princes in the literall sense, and after a worldly fashion: that you must néedes haue confessed all these things, to haue other spirituall meanings.
Which the Iewes not marking, in these and such like prophecies, of the kingdome of the Messias, and the glory of Sion, but taking the same in the bare sense of the words, as you doe, were so sotted on a worldly glory kingdome, that they quite dispised the pouertie of Christ, and to this day dispise it: looking for a Messias that (as they sansie) shall raigne in al worldly pompe, and subdue all kingdomes and people to him, and therefore they scrape vp money so fast to helpe him.
And so you Papists in these prophecies of the kingdom of Christ, and the glory of his Church, haue as grosse vnderstanding as the Iewes: and dispising the simplicitie of the Gospell, nor beholdyng the spirituall ornamentes of the spouse of Christ: thinke the worship of God lyeth in suche outwarde glory.
And hearing of obedience seruice of Kings to Christ and to his Church: thinke it consistes in this, that Kings muste sweare to you to renounce their kingdomes, and holde them of the Pope, and be obedient to him, and he his Prelats must florishe in all worldly pompe and ryches.
Is not this the Iewes error vp and downe? howbeit in oppressing of Kings you are worse than the Iewes, and in seing honor here, verie Cerinthia~s, and shall neuer haue it else where, excepte you forsake your errors.
he that dispiseth you dispiseth me: as it maketh nothing for you, being nothing suche as those were, who~ Christ did sende, so being vnderstood of those that are in deede sent of Christe, is nothing to this purpose.
We graunt that no godly ministers ought to be dispised.
But as they ought not in their calling, to be dispised of the Prince, so no more ought the Prince to be dispised of them, much lesse to be troden vnder their féete, and their kingdomes to be taken from them, as your Popes haue vsed them, and you woulde haue the~ here be spoiled.
Wherby it appéereth, yt you are not such as Christ doth sende, but are of Sathans sending, to bréede contempts, seditio~s, treasons against Princes, to maintain your pride and carnall pleasures, of whome Saint Iude did prophecie, that defiling your fleshe you despise authoritie, ryle on the Maiestie of your Soueraignes.
of Christ saying to Peter, Thou art Peter, and vpon this rocke will build my Churche, and the gates of hell shall not preuaile againste it, is altogether besides the matter.
It is your chiefe place wrested for your Popes vsurpatio~, but sée not how it is brought in here against ye Princes authoritie, except you will make a kings estate to be the gates of hell.
But as the Princes estate is the ordinaunce of God, so rather thinke the attempte to depose the Prince, to be, if not the gates of hell· yet one of the readiest wayes to hell, as we haue example of Core, Dathan, and Abiron, that went not by the gate, nor by the posterne, but were swallowed vp and toombled in quicke to hell.
And although the rebellious Papists go not downe that wayes, yet shall they be sure to come to hell, and thinke rebellion be one of the broadest gates that hell hath, for Papists on a plompe to enter.
Nowe that M. Samders hath (as he thinketh) with thes texts, confirmed the Bishops refusall of Baptising the king, he will admitte the Bishop will Baptise him, and see what inconuenience shall ensue.
For (saith he) if the Bishop will baptise him, whom he heareth by name, saying, that he will not submit his Diademe to Christ, or, that is all one, he not will make his kingdom subiect to the ministers of Christ, euen in the cause of faith: where is that obedience of faith, which the Apostles were sent to procure in all nations? is it meete that he which denounceth, that he will not want his empire for no fault at all, should notwithstanding be armed with the name of a Christian, and with the sacramentes of Christ, to lay the greater ambushments against his Church? for who doubteth, that there is greater daunger of the domesticall, than of the foraigne enemie.
Surely M. Saunders, am of your opinio~ in this last sente~ce.
Out of doubt, there is greater dau~ger of the domesticall, than of the foraigne enimie.
We sée ye appara~t experience in your Pope, that is so much the more perilous enimie to the Christia~ faith, as he prete~deth to be the Uicar of Christ, the seruant of the serua~ts of God a father of fathers in Christes Church (for so his name Papa, signifieth) is in dede a robber of Christs glory, a hider of Christs Gospell, a setter vp of his owne decrees, a spoyler of all kings and kingdomes, a begniler of the people vnder a shew of holinesse, an Angel of darknesse shyning like an Angell of light, a rauening wolfe in a shéepes clothing, a child of perdition himself, and pretending to saue other from perdition, the man of sin, calling himself a God.
There is greater dau~ger of such a puppet of ye deuill, thus disguised like a God, than is of the heathen, tha~ is of the Iewes, than is of Mahomet, than is of the greate Turke, than is of the Deuill hymselfe.
And the like greater daunger is of all dissemblyng Papistes in the Courtes and Realmes of protestant Princes, than is of open Papists apparant enemies.
beseech God, they may be loked vnto, remoued fro~ such places, yt there may be lesse danger of the~.
As for this Prince and Byshop that M. Saunders maketh his presupposals vpon, there is farre greater daunger to the Church of God in this Byshop, than in this Prince.
For first the Prince, not of compulsion, but of his owne voluntarie, not of crafte or malice, or any other sinister affection, but of good hearte and méere deuotion (for so king Lucius and Clodoueus did) commeth to the Byshop to be baptized, and humbly offereth to acknowledge the faithe of Christe.
What danger is here towarde the Church of Christ by this good Princes offer, or not rather gret benefite to the Church of Christe, to haue so mightie a Realme as Englande or Fraunce to become Christian, by this offer? why is not this offer taken? for sooth, the B. refuseth it.
Is not here a great iniurie offered to Christs Church, by this B? but whie doth the B. thus? bycause the Prince will not promise obedience to the Prelates, and to renounce his kingdome, if he swarue from his obedience to them.
Is this a sufficient cause, for want of obedience to the Prieste, to defeate Chryste of his obedience? Nay (say you) he made an exception that he vvoulde not submit his Diademe to Christ.
By your leaue M. Saunders, there you say not true.
Loke on your own presupposall once again, yea, on the words you made the Prince to speake, whiche althoughe they were of your owne deuising, for you neuer, suppose, heard or read of Prince desirous to be baptized, that spake on that fashion, you do but tell the Princes tale to your aduantage: yet finde you no such wordes, in the wordes that you speake for him, yea, he speaketh the contrarie, in offering to acknowledge the faith of Christ.
But (say you) he would not submit his Diademe make his kingdome subiecte in the cause of faithe, to the Ministers of Christ, and that is all one vvyth denying to submit his Diademe to Christ.
Yea, Master Sanders? were it admitted, ye were ministers of Christ, is Christ you al one? the submissio~ to Christ to his ministers al one? Backare M. Sa. there is a great difference.
And yet Chryst requireth no submission of Diademes or subiection of kingdoms, in such sort vnto him, that he wold haue kings resigne them vp to him, and he woulde take them: no, he neuer vsed that practise.
He might haue had such kingdomes, if he had list, but he refused them, as your selfe before haue confessed.
Althoughe your Pope will haue kings resigne their kingdomes vnto him, and he will take them, and ruffle in greater pompe, than any king vseth to doe. Whiche argueth playnely that he is not Christes minister.
And therefore the king hardyly may refuse his vnlawfull demaunde, that he woulde in the name of Christ extort, as Christes officer, which his master Christe both refused himselfe, and forbad in his ministers.
And therefore the Prince dothe Chryste no iniurie, bycause he will not bring his kingdome thrall to a false Prieste, pretending to be Christes Minister, béeing indéede the Minister of the tempter, that offereth worldly kingdomes.
But (say you) hee muste make his kingdome subiecte to them, in the cause of faith.
As though the cause of faith were hindered, if the King made not his kingdome subiecte to the Priestes? where as this were the reddiest way, bothe to destroye the kingdome and the faith? No (Master Saunders) the faithe of Chryste was neuer more sincere, than when the Ministers of Chryst were obedient subiectes to their kings.
And the cause of faythe was neuer more weakened and corrupted, than sithe Priestes haue wrong themselues out of their kings subiections, and that the Popes haue made the Kings sweare obedience vnto them.
But Maister Saunders whines at this, crying out: vvhere is the obedience of faith, that Christ sent his Apostles to procure in all the vvorlde? You do well (Master Saunders) to aske vvhere it is? for surely it is not with you, nor in all your Popishe kingdome, except here and there lurking, and dare not shewe hir head, for feare your Popishe Inquisitors, woulde gette hir by the polle.
The obedience of fayth was frée, when Priests were subiectes: and since Priestes became Princes, they haue taken hir captiue, and exiled hir, and done all that they coulde to haue killed hir.
But she is escaped your hands, and requicouereth that libertie, that the Apostles procured in all nations for hir.
And she doth so much the better, bicause she rereth not worldly subiection of Princes, but letteth Princes kéepe the estate of their kingdomes: and requireth not onely obedience to hir, in a more spirituall submission.
Whiche the more Princes yelde vnto hir, they bring not their kindomes into more slauerie, but into more libertie, renowne and honour.
So that truste shortely, they will bring the Pope and his proude Prelates, to their olde obedience againe.
Whie (saye you) this is to arme Princes agaynste the Church.
Nay Master Saunders, it is rather to strengthen the Church, to let Princes haue that armor that is due vnto them.
What? (say you) to lette them doe vvhat they vvill, and for nothing they shall doe, to saye they vvill not leaue their Empire? No bodie Master Saunders, giueth Princes authoritie to do what they will.
The authoritie that is giuen them, is onely to doe good.
Their vvill must not be what they will, but what Lawe vvill.
It is not with them, as it is wyth your Pope: Sic volo, sic Iubeo, stet pro ratione voluntas.
Thus vvill, and thus commaunde, my vvyll shall stande in steade of reason.
The Law is not wyth them in scrinio pectoris, in the cofer of the brest, as your Pope sayth it is in his.
graunt, there are Princes that doe thus, but that is not their dutie: Neither do Princes make a profession (as you say) that for nothing they will giue ouer their authoritie, nor it is required of them, nor presupposed.
But their duetie in their offic is required, and it is presupposed they will continue therein.
Which if they do not, but breake promise, shall the subiectes depose them, or the Byshops depriue them? by whiche rule they may quickly set vpon ye Prince, for any enormitie in ciuil matters too, for he promised to minister iustice to al me~: but he promised to none, to giue vp his crowne, if he did not.
Yea, though he had made them some suche expresse promise also, and brake it: yet coulde no Byshop, nor any other priuate person, attempte to depose him, for the breach thereof, but commit the vengeance to God.
But this Prince that here is presupposed, offereth inough vnto the Bishop, which if he refuse, not the Prince, but the Byshop endamageth the Church of Christ.
Nowe Master Saunders, presupposing in this supposall, that he hath clearely euicted the case, where the Byshop by expresse wordes maketh this condition with the king: he will pursue his victorie that he thinketh he hath gotten, and proue that the king hath promised, and is bounde euen as muche, where the Byshoppe at his baptisme saithe no suche wordes vnto him.
But if so be (saith he) all men vvill confesse, that no Byshop can giue baptisme, vvithout great sinne, to that king, vvhom he seeth so proude: then truely although the Byshop by negligence, or forgetfulnesse, shall say nothing hereof vnto the king, notvvithstanding suche is the obedience that the king himselfe giueth vnto the Gospell of Christe, vvhen he maketh himselfe a member of him, and desireth of him to be saued, that vvill hee, nill hee, this promise is contained in that facte, that he shall minister vnto Christ, and to the Church of Christe, either in making lavves for it, or in taking armes for it, or in giuing his life for his brethren, and much more in yelding or giuing vp his kingdome for his saluation.
If any man come to me (saith Christ) and hate not his father and mother, and vvife and children, and brethren and sisters, yea, and his life also, he can not be my disciple.
But any kingdome ought not be deerer to a king, than his ovvn life.
Therfore sith euery Christian ought to giue his life for Christe: hovve muche more ought any king rather to hate his kingdome, than that he shoulde forsake Christ.
But and if any man that commeth to Christ, thinke vvith himselfe otherwise than thus, he doth nothing but deceiue himselfe.
For in that that Christ hath set this lavve in his Gospell, that no man shoulde come to him, that is to say, enter into his Church, but he that should be readie rather to forsake al the goods of this vvorld, tha~ leaue the faith of Christ: then in that that any Christian king is made a Christian, he promiseth not only to fosake his kingdome, but his life also, rather than hee shoulde bring offence to his brethren.
If therefore the same king shall so sinne against the Christian faithe, that by no meanes he vvill be amended: he may by the ministers of Christ be depriued of his kingdome.
Not that all temporall kingdomes, are vnder the ministers of Christe: but bycause the kingdomes of all Christian Princes, by the nature of the thing that is done, are made subiecte to them, so ofte as it is expedient for the saluation of the people, that the kingdomes should either this vvay, or that vvay, be translated.
Here is a faire tale M. Saunders, but a foule conclusion.
The drift of all, is this, Byshops maye translate kingdomes either this vvaye or that vvaye, as they shall thinke expedient for the peoples saluation Howe say you M. Saunders, is not this your conclusion? you make exception that all kingdoms be not vnder you· as though some were, as indéede you haue gotten too many vnder you.
Where Christe saith, you shall haue none vnder you, but you will néedes haue some.
Yea, by this rule you wil haue al christian kingdomes vnder you.
For howe are they not vnder you, if they maye be translated this vvay, or that vvay, and giuen to this man or to that man, as ofte as you shall thinke it expedient? are not you then the Kings of Kings, when you may depose and sette vp Kings, and alter cleane topsie turuie) which you call translating) the state of euery kingdome, at your pleasures? Indéede Master Saunders, the Byshop sayde not thus muche before to the King that woulde be baptized.
Well, say you, it was but his negligence, or forgetfulnesse.
And what if he sayde nothing heereof? yet he ment it, yea, and the Kyng himselfe promised it.
Where finde you that Master Saunders? Yes (say you) he promysed that and more too, vvhen he made himselfe a member of Chryste, and desired of Chryste to be saued.
For in that doing (vvill he, nill he) this promise is contained, that hee shall minister to Christe, and to the Churche of Chryste, eyther in making Lavves for it, or in taking Armes for it, or in giuing his life for his brethren, and muche more, giuing vp his kingdome for their saluation.
And yet, goe to, we graunte you all this, the King promised thus muche, but not, vvill he, nill he, in spite of his bearde: he did it vvillingly, in offering to acknovvledge the faythe of Chryste, wherein he promised to minister to Chryste, and to the Church of Christ, as you say.
But whether you be Christ or no, thinke the King will make no question.
But perhaps he may moue the questio~, whether you be the Church, yea, any parte of the Churche of Christ, or no.
And if he finde you to be (whiche doubte me, will be an harde matter to persuade the king, if it be wel examined:) well then, the King shall minister vnto you.
But howe shal he minister? as your slaue, and be at commaundemente? thinke (Maister Saunders) you can not picke that out of his promise.
Nay your selfe expounde the contrarie, saying, that he shall make Lavves for the Churche.
If you then bée the Churche (as ye pretende to be) he muste make Lavves for you.
But the Lavve maker to any body (by your owne saying, and by good reason) is aboue the parties, for whome he maketh Lavves, and therefore the king, not onely in the ruling of you, but euen in his ministring vnto you, is aboue you.
Nowe if he finde you not to be of the Churche: then muste he make lavves, and minister iustice againste you, for vsurping that title, and deceiuing of his people.
But (say you) he must giue his life for his brethren, much more his kingdome for their saluation.
You say well (Master Sanders) he ought to doe so, if the forsaking his kingdome or his life, woulde be his brethrens saluation.
But you put a hard case, and not commonly séene, for thinke the peoples getting of saluation, lyeth not vpon the kings losing his life or kingdome, but onely vpon Iesus Chryste.
If you speake of other accidentes and occasions: twentie to one, the people are oftener in more danger by the kings death or deposition, than by his life or gouernemente, excepte he be a very tyrant, and indéede his life and gouernement may doe much hurte, and it were better he were fayre buried, or did resigne, than he should gouerne Gods people.
But God knoweth best what he hath to doe, and can take him awaye when he will, or can suffer him to scourge and exercise his people wyth affliction.
The chaffe and stubble wyll burne with fyre, but the Golde is purifyed, the electe are tryed, and are not damned by his tyrannie, nor they consent vnto his wickednesse, nor yet they reuolt from his obedience, nor rebell and depose him, but possesse their soules in pacience, and crye to God to succor them.
Nowe as it falleth out thus in the worste case that you can put, that no Byshop, nor other subiecte may depose his Soueraign: so in a good Prince no such thing is to be feared.
And since it is to men vncertaine, how the king will proue, they iudge and hope the best, bycause they knowe not the worst, and extorte no such promise of him.
Much lesse ought they to make a rule, that he shall resigne or suffer death, whe~ the people will haue him, and say, his life or gouernmente hinders their saluation: or when the Byshops shall say, it is hurtfull to them: then at the Byshops so saying, the king must either lose his kingdome, or his life: this is a hard case, M. Saunders, for poore kings, and trowe you, this is contained in their promise? Well (say you) Christ saide, if any man come to me and hate not his father, his mother, his vvife, his children, yea, his life for me, he can not be my Disciple, much more then must he hate his kingdome, and be readie to leaue his kingdome, and all the good in the vvorlde for Christe, or else hee is no Christian.
You say true, M. Sanders, he must forsake and hate al for Christes sake.
But that he must do this for your Byshoppes sakes, when they will say, it is expedient he should so do: that finde not in the words of Christe, and yet muste you beware howe you expounde that saying.
For he is bound also, to loue and to kéepe to the vttermost, all these thinges, in their kindes, not to renounce nor hate the~, except they hinder him from Christ, whom he must prefer before al things.
But this loue to Christe in principall, maye stande togither with these loues wel inough.
Neither is he any more bounde to resigne his kingdome, than to resigne his vvife into the Priestes hands.
Nor if he abuse his kingdome, the Prieste can no more turne him out of it, than he can, if he abuse his goods and his vvife, turne him not of his dores, and take his goodes and his vvife from him, and kéepe hir himself, or giue hir vnto an other.
This can not the Byshop do, although the Prince and euerie man be bounde to lose al for Christes cause.
Yea, the Byshop is bounde hereto as well as any other.
And God knowes how some of them kepe this bonde, and yet wil not they léese one halfpennie for Christes sake, howsoeuer they breake it.
But the kingdome is a oule moate in their eye, and therefore the King, poore soule, must lose all, and they must take it from him.
Moreouer the kingdomes of faithfull Princes, whose people feare God, are not altogether earthly or worldlye.
For in that part that they haue beleued in Christ, they haue as it were lefte to be of this worlde, and haue begonne to be members of the eternall kingdome, for although the outwarde face of things, which is founde in kingdomes meere secular, be in a Christian kingdome: yet sith the spirite of man is farre the more excellent parte of hym, and the whole spirite acknowledgeth Christ his King and onely Lorde: see nothing, why Christian kingdomes ought not rather to be Iudged spirituall, according to their better part, than earthly.
And this is the cause why nowe long since, those which gouerned the people of God were wont to be annoynted of his Ministers no otherwise than were the Prophetes and Priestes.
For euen the Kings them selues also are after a sort partakers of the spirituall Ministerie when they are annoynted: not that they should do those things that are committed to the onely Priestes herevnto orderly consecrated, but that those things, which other Kings referre to a prophane and worldly ende, these Kings should now remember, that they oughte to directe to an holye ende.
For when they themselues are made spirituall, it is fitte they should will, that all their things should be counted as it were spirituall.
But nowe are spirituall things, so vnder the Church of Christ that the Church may freely dispose and decree of them, to the profite of the whole mysticall body.
Syth therefore the people of Israell woulde needes desire a King to be giuen them: Samuel by the commaundement of God, toke a cruse of oyle, and powred it vpon the heade of Saule, and kissed him, and sayd, beholde God annoynteth thee, to be the Prince ouer his inheritaunce.
VVhich to me seemeth to signifie, euen as though it had bene sayde, except the Lord annoynted thee to be the Prince, thou couldest not rightly and orderly be the Prince ouer hys people, whiche hee hathe chosen, and reserued out of all the worlde to be as it were peculiar to hymselfe.
For in that that is gods, no man can take power to him selfe without Gods permission.
But God anoynted Saul to be the Prince not by himselfe but by Samuel his minister: wherfore whosoeuer ruleth ouer the Christian people (which is no lesse acceptable to God, than was the people of the Iewes) hee, besides the right, which he receyueth of God by the consent of the people, ought also to acknowledge his power to be of Christe by his Ministers, if so be that he be suche an one that worshippeth the Fayth of Christe.
VVherevpon to thys day all Christian kingdomes are annoynted of some Christian Bishop or some other Minister of God, referring therein their principalitie not onely to the people, and so vnto God, but that moreouer by the Priests of Christ, they referre it vnto Christ, whose Ministers they are.
Thou oughtest to marke stedfastly, the Kingly power not onely to bee giuen to thee, to the gouernement of the worlde, but to be giuen thee chiefly for the succour of the Churche, that in suppressing naughtie attemptes, thou shouldest bothe defende those things, that are well decreed, and restore the true peace, to those things that are troubled.
If Maister Saunders woulde goe plainely to woorke, and make his argumentes shorte and formall, and woulde rather shewe his Logike than his Rethorike: the truth or falsehoode woulde appéere the sooner, the reader perhappes mighte be the lesse delyghted, but withoute perhappes, hee shoulde be lesse beguyled, and the aunswere mighte bée the clearer and the shorter.
ll this long argument in effect is this: All spirituall things are so vnder the Church of Christ, that the Church may freely dispose and decree of them to the prosite of the whole mysticall body.
Ergo, all Christian Kings and Kingdomes are so vnder the Church of Christ, that she maye freely dispose and decree of them, to the prosite of the whole mysticall body.
To proue Christian Kyngs and Kyngdomes spirituall, that bycause the better parte of them is spirituall, therefore hée seeth nothyng why they oughte not to bee rather iudged spirituall.
Yea Kings were woe to bee annoynted no otherwyse than Prophetes and Priestes, not to doe theyr actions, but to referre all theyr affayres to holy and spirituall dedes.
Now? how chance you coulde not seeit before, when you made the Christian Princes ciuill power, to be no better than the Turkes, or Tartars, to stretch no furder tha~ to the body a quiet lyfe? haue you now espied not onely the endes wherevnto they rule, but the estate also itselfe, by reason of the better parte to be spirituall? what hath made you see so cléerely nowe? forsooth now is now, and then was then.
You were pleading then, that the Christian Princes ciuill estate, was so farre different and vnlike, that Princes might not meddle in spirituall matters, and therfore then was fitte oportunitie, to denie that Christian Princes Ciuill power, had any spirituall thing in it.
But nowe we are in another argument, that Priestes maye order and dispose Kingdomes, and depose Kings as they shall thinke expedient: and to proue this· we must saye they be in the Churches power, and to proue that, wee must saye they are spirituall· and so, spirituall men may deale with spirituall thyngs.
And for this reason, we can sée no cause nowe, but that Christian Kingdomes are spirituall that we spirituall men, which are the Church, might haue the disposing of them.
Well then see also (Maister Saunders) that for aduantage you can, and you can not see.
But who seeth not, that hath any indifferent eyes, that this is but legerdemain, and that you speake flat contraries in one thing, although you turne your tale to other purposes? But let go that you saw not before, let vs loke what you see in Princes now.
And why so? not bicause they doe the spirituall actions of the Priests, but bicause of their better part, that is, of the spirite of God, and bicause of the end wherto they driue al their things, to become as it were spirituall.
Why then M. Saunders your eyes mighte serue you (if your hart could serue you) to see this withall, that although the Prince can not do the spirituall actions of spirituall persons, yet this hindreth not, that he may notwithstanding be a gouernor ouer ecclesiasticall persons, in causes ecclesiasticall and maye ouersee them both.
And if you can see the one and not the other, surely your sight is partiall.
But newe M. Saunders loking another way, will haue Princes no furder spirituall, than in that they are vnder the Church.
And here, making the Maior the Minor, the former the later, by a figure called Hysteron proteron, the carte before the horse: he will proue, that all spirituall things are so much vnder the Churche of Christ, that the Church may freely dispose and decree of them, to the profite of the whole mysticall body: and so, Kings and Kingdomes, (as is sayde before) beyng spirituall things, are so muche vnder the Churche of Christ, that she may freely, to the profit of the whole mysticall body, dispose and decree of Kings and kingdomes.
For although in certaine things it be true, to wit, in such things as are left to the disposition of the Church, that is, to order and dispose such things, as of their nature are indifferent, to the profite of the whole mysticall body, or any part thereof, (for these things, are called spirituall things, not properly, in their owne nature, but as in spirituall causes the spirituall persons vse them) and yet all this is not so freely lefte to the Churches disposition, that some principall persons in the Church (as the Prince, or the Pastors) haue not the chiefest stroke in the disposition of them.
For if they were so free, that euery member in the Churche shoulde haue his nay or yea in disposing of the~, when would they be disposed? And if at length they were, it would peraduenture fall out in the end, so little to the profite of the whole mysticall body, that it woulde be rather the hinderaunce and disquieting of it.
But besides these spiritual thinges, there are a great many other, of whiche, some in déede are méere spirituall as the worde of God, the Sacramentes of Christ, the Articles of fayth, the Commaundementes of life, and all suche thinges as God hathe either expressed in his worde, or is necessarily conteyued in it.
These thinges béeing spiritual, are not so vnder the churche of Christ, that the churche may freely dispose and decree of them.
But they statly dispose and decree of the churche, and the churche can not alter nor swarue one iote from them.
Whiche if she shoulde, she shoulde not profite hir selfe, (for she is the whole mysticall body but destroy hir selfe, and dissolue the whole body, and euery part therof.
And such as these things are, is the estate of a King and kingdome, whiche althoughe it be not so méere a spirituall thing, but so farre foorthe spirituall as your selfe confesse: yet bicause it is the ordinaunce of God, and God hath in his worde set foorthe the office of a King, and declareth that the setting vp and pulling downe of Kinges, and the alterations of kingdomes, belongeth to him selfe, and neuer gaue that authoritie to his Churche, muche lesse to his Ministers, to set vp and depose Kinges, and alter kingdomes: Kinges therefore and their kingdomes, no more than other spirituall thinges, are not so vnder the churche of Christe, that she maye freely dispose and decree of them, to the profite of the whole mysticall body.
Neither hathe the whole mysticall body any more thraldome, or lesse fredome, that Kings and kingdomes are not so vnder hir, or that she maye not freely dispose and decree of them, as she shall thinke moste profitable to the whole mysticall body: than she hathe more thraldome, or lesse freedome, bicause she can not alter nor dispose the other spirituall things.
Yea in this case, the Churche léeseth lesse libertie than in the other, for the freedome of the Churche· béeing a mysticall body, is cleane another matter pertayning to the conscience, and is a mysticall freedome, from the tyrannie of Sathan, from the cursse of the lawe, from the bondage of sinne, from ceremonies, and humayne constitutions: and not from obedience to kinges, and to haue superioritie ouer them, and libertie to depose them, and to translate their kingdomes.
Whiche freedome and superioritie is not spirituall, but carnall and worldly.
And if the Churche had it, she woulde not onely bring kinges and kingdomes, but euen hir selfe in bondage, and therefore Christe hathe barred it.
Whiche freedome, bicause the Popishe Churche aspireth vnto, and claymeth, and holdeth ouer· kinges and kingdomes: she is not the true Church of Christ, that they boast of, but rather a Iewishe Synagoge, dreaming vpon an earthly Messias, or rather a Persian or Turkishe Temple, that measureth the freedome and dignitie of Gods Church, by the pompe and mighte of the worlde, to depose kings, and dispose of their kingdomes at their pleasures.
But to proue that kings and kingdomes pertayne not to the free disposition of the Church, but of God: will desire no better prooues nor example than euen M. Saunders heere brings foorthe.
Sithe therefore (sayth he) the· people of Israell would needes desire a king to be giuen the~, Samuel by the commaundement of God, tooke a cruse of oyle, and powred it vpon the head of Saule, and kissed him· and sayde: beholde God anoyteth thee, to be the Prince ouer his Inheritaunce which to me seemeth to signifie, as though it had bene sayde, except the Lorde anoynted thee to be the Prince, thou couldest not rightly and orderly be the Prince ouer his people, whiche he hathe chosen and reserued out of all the worlde to be, as it were, peculiar to him selfe.
For in that that is Gods, no man can take power to him selfe, without Gods permission.
If this be true that héere you say, M. Saunders (as it is moste true) if Samuels words do so sounde in your eares, as though he had sayde, Saule coulde not be king ouer Gods people, except the Lorde anoynted him: If the Lorde reserue this prerogatiue to him selfe, to appoynt Princes, and giue kingdomes where he onely pleaseth: howe then is this true, that kings and kingdomes are so vnder the Churche that she may freely dispose decree of the~ as she pleaseth? Although the Church be the Lordes spouse and wyfe, yet is she not hir selfe the Lorde, nor the Lorde is ruled by hir, but she by the Lorde, neither hathe he giuen hir this prerogatiue, but as you héere confesse, it is a thing belonging onely to him.
And therefore by your owne confession, Kinges and kingdomes are not so vnder the Church, that she may dispose and decree as she thinketh good of them.
And as your owne witnesse thus beateth your selfe, in your owne example: So to consider this example further.
Saule was appoynted King of God, and thoughe at the firste he was a good King, yet afterwarde he became bothe a tyrant in lyfe, and an Apostata in doctrine, by which occasion he was a great offence to the Churche of God.
What nowe? did the Churche of God saye, she had suche freedome ouer him and his kingdome, that she might freely dispose and decree thereof as should be profitable for the whole· mysticall body.
Surely to the Churches iudgement, it appeared more profitable, if this ill Kyng hadde béene deposed, and some other godly man placed in hys steede, muche more if Dauid hadde beene placed· whom GOD likewyse had anoynted to be their King.
Dyd the Churche this? No, coulde they haue done this? No, they had no suche fréedome, but they let Saule alone, and committed the case to God, who, at his good oportunitie, as he onely sent the king, so he only tooke him away, and sent them another.
For onely God transposeth kingdomes, and not the Churche, as he him selfe testifieth (who is the best Iudge we can appeale vnto) saying: Per me Reges regnant, Kinges rule by me, and not by my Churche.
And so confesseth Daniel: He chaungeth times and ages, he translateth kingdomes, and establisheth them.
His Church therefore hathe not the free disposition of them.
But sayth master Saunders: God anoynted Saule to be the Prince, not by him selfe, but by his Minister: wherefore whosoeuer ruleth ouer the Christian people (whiche is no lesse acceptable to God than was the people of the Iewes) he besides the right that he receyued by the consent of the people, ought also to acknowledge his power, to be of Christe by his Ministers, if so be that he be suche an one, as worshippeth the fayth of Christe.
VVherevpon to this day, all christian Kinges are anoynted of some christian Bishop, or some other minister of God, referring therein their principalitie, not onely to the people, and so vnto God: But referre it besides, by the Ministers of Christe, to Christe, whose Ministers they are.
Your argument is this: The King is anoynted of God.
But this is done by the ministerie of Gods Prophetes or Ministers: Ergo, Not onelie God, but his Ministers haue the free disposing and decreeing of Kings and kingdomes.
Your conclusion is not in so playne English, but colourably you fetche the matter about the bushe, saying: therefore they muste referre their principalitie, not onely to the people, and so to God: but referre it besides by the ministers of Christ, to Christ, whose ministers they are.
What néede this nice daliaunce and circumquaques, M. Saunders? that almoste men can scarse tell what you meane, but that you meane some fal shode.
If you meane, they shoulde referre it to the Ministers of Christ: that is an vntruth.
If you meane, they must refee it so to Christe by his Ministers, that it takes the authoritie of the Ministers: that is another vntruthe.
If you meane, it muste be referred to Christe, that worketh it by the ministerie of his Ministers (howbeit there is no suche necessitie neither, in the making of Kinges, althoughe it be orderly and ordinarily done by their ministerie yet what serueth this to the purpose? Speake playnely man, and say: the king is made king by the Bishops: Ergo, the Bishops may dispose and decree of him and his kingdome, and may depose him, and giue the kingdome to another, as they shall thinke good· For this is your playne drifte.
But we denie your argument, for by the like you mighte make euery mans baptisme and sayth to hang of the free disposition, decreeing and alteration of the Minister, sithe these things are receyued by the Minister, but the force of them dependes not on the minister.
And much lesse that bicause suche a Bishop crowned the King, therefore he may rule the King, and haue free disposition to decree what the King shall doe, and whether he shall continue King or no.
No, M. Saund. and if he had the authoritie to make the King: yet the King beeing made, it followeth not, that he may marre him too.
But the moste that you can make of the Minister in the Kings Coronation· is but, Causa sine qua non, that he can not well be made without him, and yet in very déede, it is not so muche, and therefore this is but a slender argument.
But sée, how you runne héere craftily from the Church, to the Bishop your argument was of the Church, and your conclusion is of the Bishop.
Wherby you meane that your Prelates only are of the church· Which as it is most false, so is it rather to be examined, whether you be any ministers or parts of the churche at al if you speake of the churche of Christ.
For (as was shewed before) neither the church· nor the spirituall Ministers of Christ· did euer take vpon them, this deposing of kings, and disposing of kingdomes that you chalenge.
Samuel whome you cite, had béene a gouernour by an extraordinary calling, béeing the laste Iudge before the Kings, but after he had· anoynted and declared Saule to be king he neuer tooke vpon him, the publike gouernment of the kingdome.
And though God sent him to tell Saule, how God would cast him off, and though also God had him anoynt another: yet would he not mede in the gouernme~t, nor depose Saule, nor incite Dauid or the people to depose him, althoughe God had caste him cleane off, but onely mourned for him.
If you can shewe any example of the contrarie, am sure we shall heare it, but as yet we heare of none.
You tell vs of an elegante sentence of Pope Leo, to the Emperour Leo.
But as there is no greate elegancie in it, so it maketh nothing to this purpose: and the purpose that it maketh for, is rather for the Princes gouernment in ecclesiasticall, causes than agaynst it.
Howbeit to alleage a Pope, for the vsurpation of the Pope, is to muche partialitie, besides that Leo is to be burdened with oule crimes in this matter, for his practises agaynst the Emperour, as we shall God willing see hereafter.
But M. Sanders, to proue that the ministerie of the minister, argueth he hathe authoritie to dispose of the King and his kingdome, procéedeth thus.
But that the gouernment of a christian king oughte to be referred to Christ, it hathe flowed from nothing, but from the mysterie of the incarnation of Christe, that all Christian kinges shoulde acknowledge the humayne nature of Christe, to be aboue their principalitie, and therefore should vnderstande, that they are inferiour to the Ministers of Christe, in those thinges that pertayne to the fayth of Christ, or to eternall lyfe.
To what purpose otherwyse belongeth, that solemne anoynting and consecrating of Kings, which is wonte to be done by the Priestes of Christ? Greater (saythe Chrysostome) is the principalitie of the Priest, than of the King.
Therefore the King submitteth his head to the hande of the Priest.
And euery where in the olde Testamente, the Priestes anoynted the Kinges.
And truely if the people of God differ from all people, by the gifte of fayth, and as the Priestes are the Ministers of setting foorthe the faythe: so the blessing and consecration of the Priestes, that they giue to the Kinges, is an especill token, whereby the mysterie of the Incarnation of Christe, and the principalitie of his Ministers in dispensing that mysterie is acknowledged.
M. Saunders still beates vpon his former argumente, and driues his reason thus: If the anoynting of the king hath a mysterie of his obedience to the Incarnation and humanitie of Christ: then the King must vnderstande that he is inferior to the Ministers of Christ, in those things that pertayne to the faith of Christ, or to eternall life, bicause they are the Ministers in dispensing that mysterie.
But the solemne anoynting consecrating of kings, which is wont to be done by the Priests of Christe, serueth to no other purpose, than to declare the obedience of Kinges to the Incarnation and humanitie of Christ: Ergo, The King must vnderstand, that he is inferior to the Ministers of Christ, in those things that pertayne to the fayth of Christ, or to eternall life, bicause they are the Ministers in dispensing that mysterie.
First in this conclusion héere is nothing pertaining to the present purpose, yt the Ministers of Christ may depose Kings, and dispose their kingdomes· which is ye thing that should be concluded.
There is a great differe~te betwéene those things that ayne to the faythe of Christe, to eternall life, to the dispensati of the mysterie of Christes Incarnation and humayne nature: and the gouerning of a kingdome.
In the dispensation· of the one, we graunt the king to be inferiour to the Ministers of Christ.
But in the dispensation of the other, the Ministers of Christ are inferiour to the king.
So that this conclusion is not to the purpose· And although this answere is sufficient to this argument: yet let vs sée his handling the partes thereof.
And first, we dene the sequele of the maior, that if the kinges annoynting hath a mysterie of his obedience, to the incarnation and humaine nature of Christe, that then the king is inferiour to the minister of Christe, in those things that pertaine to the faithe of Christe, and to eternall life, bicause he is the minister in dispensing that mysterie.
For this is no good reason: he is the Minister wherby the thing is done: Ergo, he is the superior in the thing that is done· We mighte better reason on the contrarie: he is the Minister: Ergo· in that respecte he is the inferiour, for ministration is a seruice.
Howebeit we denie not the superioritie of his ministerie, but the noughtinesse of this argument.
For by this reason, sée howe hys argument beates him selfe and his Pope.
The Pope is ordinarily consecrated of a Cardinall or a Bishop: Ergo, the Pope is inferiour· to the Cardinals and Bishops in mtters of faithe and eternall life· bicause the Cardinals or Bishops are the Ministers in dispe~sing that mysterie.
Will the Pope allowe of this? and yet this is master Saunders reason, yea it is the Popes owne reason.
He came in lyke a Foxe, and ruled lyke a Lyon, and dyed lyke a dagge) vsed this selfe same arguments, from whom master· Sanders borroweth it: that the Pope dothe consecrate the Emperour: Ergo, the Pope is to the Emperour: that Bishops do consecrate Kings, Ergo, Bishops are superior to kings.
Which argume~t as it is nought, so eue~ the antecedent may be called in question.
For it is not long that Popes haue consecrated Emperors, neither alwayes haue Kings bene consecrated of Priests and Bishops, so that it is not simply so necessary a thing that a King is not king if he be not consecrated of them.
But as in Matrimonie it is a godly and comely order, that, althoughe the mariage be made in their betrouthing (as you said before, when the ma~ sayd to the woman, take thee to my wife, and the woman to the man, take thee to my husbande) yet for the auoyding of offence: for the more reuerence and estimatio~ of the estate, for the better calling vpo~ God to blesse it, it is done solemnoly the in temple, in the presence of the congregation, by the ministerie, prayers, and blessing of the minister: The like and greater solemnitie is in a Princes consecration, for the auoyding of offences, for the greater reuere~ce and estimation, and for the more effectuall calling vpon God for his blessing of the Kings royall estate, althoughe he were full and lawfull King before.
And so the King giueth the date of hys reigne not from his Coronation, but from the beginning of his calling to his regime~t.
And at his coronation, as the Bishop hathe his peculiar office, so diuerse other peeres haue theirs likewise, requisite to the celebration thereof.
But none of them do therevpon claime, to be the Princes superior, althoughe one giue him his sworde, another giue him his Scepter, another giue him the Ball, another giue him the Crowne, to whome the kéeping of thse things belong.
And why shoulde the Bishop more than all these, claime to be his superior, bicause he doth consecrate the King? but the ensample is euident to the contrarie.
For euen at the Kings coronation, the Bishops, so well as any other subiectes, doe their homage, receiue their temporalies from the Prince, for all their consecration of him, and therefore they can no more dispose of the Kings temporalities, and depose him fro~ them, than any of the other subiects can.
And thus much M. Saunders to the Maior of your argument.
To the Minor answere, that whether the annoynting of the King, signifie any other thing, besides the Kings obedience, to the incarnation and humaine nature of Christe: it makes no matter.
For this it signifieth not, that the Kyng should be obedient, to the disposition of the humaine minister of Christ, which is the question nowe in hande.
And yet whether it signifie this mysterie, that you say it onely doth, or no: may be called into question.
For if it hath such a significatio~, it is a very darke mysterie.
And me thinks it might more easilye signifie other things.
For oyle sometimes signifieth mercie, sometimes plentie, sometimes remedie against poyson, sometimes it is referred to the Priesthoode, sometimes, to the kingdome of Christ, somtimes to the mysticall members of Christ, as they are Kings Priests with him: so that the anoynting with oyle (which espetially was vsed to Priests and Kings, who therefore are called the sons of oyle) is applyed to sundry significations, and not onely to the incarnation and humaine nature of Christe.
And yet is there no suche necessitie of anoynting Christian Kings, as was of the Iewishe Kings.
For they had commaundement so to doe, and it was a ceremoniall figure of diuerse things in Christ.
Which commaundement and ceremonies, Christian Princes are not bound vnto.
It is cropen vp of a custome ca~not tel how, to imitate the Iewes herein.
But as for the nature of a Kings estate, he is neuer a whit the lesse King, if he wante the anoynting with oyle, and as the Papistes superstitiouslie doe vse it, it were muche better away.
But the Papistes make a great matter of anoynting Kings with oyle, yea, sayth Maister Saunders, they were wont to be annoynted no otherwise than were the Prophetes and Priestes: as thoughe they shoulde be so anoynted still.
And true it is in one sense, that they shoulde no other wise be so annoynted still, that is to say, neyther of them shoulde be anoynted.
No? say you, should not the Priestes be annoynted· We are.
In deede you be, Maister Saunders, and all your order.
But the Apostles and Disciples of Christe were not, and therefore your order is differing from theirs, and all godly ministers should differ from yours, be ye shorne, or be ye anoynted.
But if it be true that you say kings should be no otherwise anoynted than you: howe chaunce then ye are anoynted otherwise than kings, as your glosse doth reason: that vpon the King is powred oile, but vpon ye Bishop is powred Chrisme.
Kings are anoynted on the righte shoulder, but Byshops and Priestes are annoynted vpon their heads: but the heade is better than the shoulder, and Chrisme is better than oyle: Ergo, Bishops and Priests are superior vnto Kings.
Were not they which anoynted their pamphlets with such greasie argumentes, to perch vp their balde crownes, aboue the imperiall crownes of their natural Soueraignes, worthy by ye Princes commaundemente to be well anoynted with vnguentum baculinum, to make them acknowledge their due subiection, if they rather deserue not sharper instice? but let vs procéede vnto M. Saunders other arguments.
Let vs put the case, that Christ himselfe is at this day conuersant in the earth, as he was conuersant in times paste.
Can any man doubt, but in that he is man, al Christian kings, ought to be vnder his gouernment both in all eccl. and in those secular causes, that may promote the cause of the Chruche: for he shall raigne in the house of Iacob for euer and there shal be no ende of his kingdomes.
If therefore earthly Kings are parte of the house of Iacob, Christ shall raigne ouer them, and shall subdue their Kingdomes to hys spirituall Kingdome.
But whatsoeuer power was necessarye vnto Christe to eternall saluation, he transformed the externall and and visible ministerie thereof vnto the Apostles, when he said, as my father hath sent me so send you.
The Apostles therefore and their successors, doe no lesse rule in spiritual causes ouer Christian Kings, so far as the visible Ministerie, than Christ himselfe is in truth ouer them so farre as the holy power of his humaine nature.
VVherevpon sayth Epiphanius: Christ hath giuen a kingdome to those that are placed vnder him, that it should not be sayde, he proceedeth from little things to greater.
The throne of Christ abideth, and of his kingdome there is no ende, and he sitteth vpon the throne of Dauid, so that he hath translated the kingdome of Dauid together with the Bishoprike, and hath giuen it vnto his seruaunts, that is, to the Bishops of the Catholike Church.
Beholde so well the priestly as the Kingly power, is communicated to the pastors of the Churche of Christe, that by that meanes, Christ shoulde be declared, to raigne for euer, yea, euen as a spirituall and heauenly man.
And this truelye dothe that annoynting testifie that the Kings receyue of Priests.
The argument is thus: If Christ himselfe were conuersant in earth, in his humaine nature, as he hath bene: he shoulde haue ouer all Christian kings, all eccl. and secular power, in those things that might promote the Church.
But Christ hath giuen to his ministers in the visible ministerie, all the power necessarie to saluation ouer Christian kings, that belongeth to himselfe in his humaine nature.
Ergo, he hath giuen his Ministers in the visible ministerie, all ecclesiasticall and secular power in those things that maye promote the Church.
First this argument standeth vpon another presupposal, which as it is no lesse false than the other: so is it more impossible, being flat contrarie to the worte of God, and to the will of Christ.
He puttes a case that Christ woulde come againe, and in his humaine nature be conuersant vpon the earth as he was from his natiuitie till his death.
Good Lord M. Sau~ders is your cause so bad and false, that you are still driuen to these shiftes, to put the cases, of false and forged presupposals? if your cause were good it woulde stand of it selfe, you might go plainely to worke, and neuer reason vpon suche deuised cases, as you knowe and beleue shall neuer be true, except you be a Millenarie indéede, (as you gaue before a shrewde suspition of that heresie) to think Christ shall come againe, and here for a thousand yeares in all worldly might and glorie, raigne in the earth, and then go dwell in heauen.
But perhaps you wil say, what? wil you let me to put what case lyft? when ye sky falles, they say, we shal haue Larkes.
True, M. Saunders, we can not let you, to put what case you lyst, be it neuer so absurde and repugnant to the truth.
But is this the rediest way to boult out the truth, to put the case of an euident vntruth, and to imagine that to come that neuer shall be, to inferre that vsurpation of your Priestes, that is, and ought not to be? But sée howe sone your argument is ouerturned.
For if your case be not admitted, then is all your labour loste, and you haue wonne nothing for your Priestes.
But the Scripture is manifest, that this shall neuer come to passe.
And that the heauens containe Christ, til the day of Iudgement, he is neither here nor there, in his humaine nature, as Christe himselfe hath testified.
Which as it dasheth this your case yée put: so it confuteth an other chiefe errour of yours, that affirme yée haue the humaine nature of Christe, closed vp in a boxe, and that yée eate him vp, or kéepe him vp, till he waxe mouldie, and then you burne him vp.
Is this the best honor you can affoorde to Christe, being conuersant heere in earth in his humaine nature? If it be true that you say he is present, how chance yée serue him thus? is it bycause he appeareth not in his likenesse, but looketh rather like a wafer? if it were Christe indéede: howsoeuer he loked, can you finde in your hearts thus to order him? But you will saye: that is an other matter, answere to this presupposal.
We speake nowe of Christ appearing in his owne likenesse.
How say you, if he were conuersant in earth as he was, shoulde hee not ouer Christian Kings haue superioritie, in temporall causes so vvell as in ecclesiasticall, that might promote his Churche? answere, if this were admitted to be true, that Christ againe were conuersant on the earth, Christian Kings ought (no doubt) to giue him all superioritie, and be vnder him in all ecclesiasticall and temporall causes, that might promote his Churche, acknowledging all the power they haue to procéede from him.
But that Christ, if he were againe on the earth, woulde raigne ouer Kings, and in his humaine nature rule Kings in their secular causes, or that he woulde thinke this a way to promote the Church, or that he would depose Princes, and make their subiectes reuolt from their obedience, or that he woulde cease their kingdomes into his handes, and make Kings to kisse his féete, to leade his Horsse, to holde his sturrops, or that he would weare thrée Crownes, and Princely roabes of gold frette with perle and stone, or that he would kepe suche a princely porte and pompe, as passed all other Princes: which things your Pope, pretending to be his Uicar in the absence of his humaine nature, doth: this would be harde for you to proue M. Saunders, although your case were graunted, that Christ personally in his humaine nature vvere conuersant in earth againe.
For if he would haue had any of these thinges, he might haue had them when he was here on earth, as your selfe confessed in the Chapter going before saying: This in this kinde vvill speake, as the chiefest argument, that Christe vvhile he vvas here in earth, and fulfilled all the lavve and all righteousnesse: notwithstanding he would gouern eccl. matters only, as a Priest, and by no means as an earthly King.
For he openly refused to administer an earthly kingdome, therfore fled, when he saw the people go about to do this thing, that they might make him a king, he denied that he was appointed a deuider betwene the brethre~.
Are not these your own wordes M. Sand? knowe you wrest them to an other purpose, whiche there is answered vnto.
But howe serue they not here against your selfe· trow you Christe is now become of an other mynde, than he was when he was here on earth? if he be still of the same mind, then would he not take vpon him, if he were here againe on earth, the estate of an earthly King, nor gouerne in secular causes.
But trowe you, your Pope pretending to be his Uicar, would suffer this, seese the temporalties he possesseth, the kingdomes he hath gotten, the honor that is giuen him, or any thing else, that in eccl. secular causes (vnder pretence of the Churches promotion, he vsurpeth ouer all kings Christian? no, he would rather handle Christ worsse (if he could lay hands vpon him) then euer did the Iewes, he wold not onely crucifie Christe againe, but burne him cleane to ashes for an hereike, rather then he would lose this honor, or any iote thereof.
But and if Christe were here againe, conuersant on earth in his humaine nature, woulde he suffer the Popes intollerable pride and errours? would he allowe him to abuse his name, as thoughe he were his deputie and Uicar generall? trow not.
Not that thinke he séeth it not, or suffers it not, or hath not, by his prouident iustice, ordeined, that Sathan should set vp such an Antichrist, to delude strongly the Children of vnbeleefe, and to exercise vnder the Crosse of Christ his litle elected flocke.
But that, if Christe should so come as he here supposeth, surely woulde thinke the cause of his co~ming to be, euen to destroy spiritu oris eius with the breath of his mouth) this man of sin, not to mainteine him in his pompe, muche lesse himselfe to take the like vpon him.
Not that Christe is not a king ouer the house of Iacob, not that his kingdome is not eternal, as the Angel said to Marie, not that he should not subdue al earthly kingdoms to his spiritual kingdome: but that his kingdome is spiritual not earthly, the subduing of earthly kingdomes, is with a sword that conquereth the soule of man, that is, the word of God, with a force from aboue, subduing the will of man, that is, the spirite grace of God: and not such a subduing of their kingdomes, that it dissolueth their polycies estates, or deposeth their kings, maketh the people take Armes, and exerciseth· in secular causes, an earthly Kings authoritie.
M. Saunders pretendeth this is to promote the Churche of Christ, but suche promotion confoundes deuotion, and hath poysoned the Church of God, as they say a voyce was heard, what time Constantine (although falsly) is supposed to haue endowed the Church with such royall honor: Hodie venenum intrauit in ecclesn, This day entered poyson into the Church.
But Christ hath flatly forbidden it, and tolde his Disciples when they asked such promotion, that they knewe not what they asked.
But afterwarde, they knewe and founde the saying of Christ to be true, that their promotion lay in their affliction, and not in their kingly honor.
And thus we sée the falsehood of the maior forged vpon this fained presupposall, whiche is not to be graunted, and yet if it were graunted it would fall out, to the vtter ruine of the Pope all his Prelates.
Such ill lucke hath M. Sand stil to light on such examples, as he co~ceineth to make for him, but being a litle better examined, make most of al against him.
Now to the minor: that Christ hath giuen to his Ministers in the visible ministerie, all the povver necessarie to saluation, that he should haue himselfe in his humaine nature.
Where find you this M. Sand? thinke it will be ouer hard a matter for you to proue, that all the povver necessarie to saluatio~ that he shoulde haue himselfe in his humaine nature, in the visible ministerie: he hath giue~ it al to his ministers.
Al power (saith Christe) is giuen to me in heauen and in earth: this is spoken in respecte of his humaine nature: but trowe you he gaue this prerogatiue to his Apostles? you alledge Iohn.
But trowe you, this is to be stretched to the visible ministerie of al things belonging to his humaine nature? His mediation belongeth to ye ministerie of his humanitie, so wel as to his Diuinitie: hath he giuen the~ the office of his mediatio~? The propiciatorie sacrifice of his owne bodie belonged to the visible ministerie of his humaine nature: gaue he this power to the Disciples, that their bodies also in suffering deathe, shoulde be propiciatoris sacrifices? The ordeining of Sacraments was in the visible ministerie, belonging not only to Christes Diuinitie, but also to his humanitie, gaue he this power to his Disciples to make Sacramentes? Christe therefore gaue not his Ministers all the povver, in the visible ministerie, necessarie to saluation, that belonged to him in his humaine nature, but reserued many things peculiar to himselfe.
Althoughe all the power they haue, he gaue it the~, yet all the power he hath· he gaue them not.
He gaue them power in preaching the worde, in binding and losing, in administring the Sacramentes.
And yet is there a great difference betwéene that power that is proper of ones owne, and that whiche is legantine and representeth but an others: betwéene that, that is simple and absolute, and that that is bounded and conditionall: betwéene that that is principall, that that is but ministeriall.
All whiche distinctions are your owne Scholemens, and therefore these powers are nothing like, and yet are they so farre vnlike from such princely power of earthly honor, as you imagine, that they are rather cleane against it, both in Christ, and in his ministers too.
And this your own glosse out of your own Pope Gregorie might haue taught you: Sicut misit me paer.
Idest, ad passiones. &c As my father sent me, that is to say, to troubles and afflictio~s, so send you to suffer persecution, not to raigne like Kings, rule kingdomes.
And therfore sith this sentence of Christ is true, that he sent them as he was sent, he was not sente in his humaine nature to depose kings, nor to dispose of their kingdomes, nor to gouerne them: therefore his Disciples were not sent thereto.
But the Pope saith he is sent therto, and takes it vpon him: therefore he is neither minister of Christ, nor successor of his Disciples: but his Disciple that hath offered him worldly kingdomes, if he would fal downe and worship him, as he hath done, and so hath gotten his kingdomes.
As for the sentence of Epiphani, writing againste the Nazarei, although as he hath culled it out, it séemeth to giue the Priestes the power of Kings: yet this is neither the meaning nor the wordes of Epiphanius.
Epiphanius whole sentence is this: Our Lorde Iesus Christe is therefore a Prieste for euer, according to the order of Melchizedech, and also a King, according to the order from aboue, that hee mighte translate the Priesthoode togither vvith the lavve.
He is of the seede of Dauid, bycause he came of Marie, sitting in the throne for euer, and of his kingdome thereis no ende.
For novve it behoued him to translate the order, bothe of the Priesthoode, and of the kingdome.
For his kingdome is not of the vvorld, as hee saide in the Gospell to Pontius Pilate, my kingdome is not of this vvorld.
For sith Christe by hidde speaches fulfilleth all things· the matters declared of him, came to a certaine full measure.
For he vvhich alvvays raigneth, came not to receiue the encrease of a kingdome but he gaue a kingdome, to those that he hath appointed vnder him, that it should not be said, he proceeded from smal things to greater.
For his throne abideth, and thereis no ende of his kingdome.
So that he hath translated the kingdome of Dauid togither vvith the Priesthoode, and giuen it to his seruantes, that is to the Bishops of the Church.
Wherby it appeareth playn, Epiphanius meaneth not, that Christ hath giuen them an earthly kingdome, which he toke not vpon himselfe, and he flat debarreth from them, nor he euer gaue to his Disciples, nor they euer exercised.
But he meaneth of a spirituall kingdome, which he himself kéepeth euer, and yet he euer communicateth to all his faithfull, but in especiall to the Ministers of the Church, that set forth the mysteries of this heauenly, and not of an earthly kingdome.
This sentence therefore of Epiphanius maketh nothing for Byshops to be depesers of Kings, or disposers and rulers of earthly kingdomes, which is the present question.
VVherefore (saith Saunders) sithe there is a double povver in the Churche, the one spirituall, of vvhich orte, is that of the ministers of Christ, to whom is commaunded that they should teach baptise all nations, but the other is mixt, that is to say, by the beginning thereof secular, howebeit to be now referred to a spirituall end: although in the originall, in the vse, in a certaine middle end, they differ, (as is before declared) yet doe they bothe concurre in one bodie of the Church, and are caryed to one ende of eternall saluation, for the vvhich thinges, they are to be counted one certaine vnder povver ordeined.
For as in Christe, there is neither Ievve nor Greeke, neither bonde nor free, neither male nor female, but they ar al one in Christ.
So in the kingdo~e of god, the powers are not as it were altogither distinguished either of the father ouer the sonne, or of the husbande ouer the vvife, or of the master ouer the serua~t, or of the Prince ouer his subiect, or of the Pastor ouer his sheepe, but al these powers are one in the Church of God.
And among all men take this to be agreed vpon, that all these povvers shall besvvallovved vp of that infinite glorie, that in the life to come, shall be poured on the sonnes of adoption, in so much that there shall be no secular thing in the kingdo~e of God.
And sith the Church of Christ is a certaine liuely Image of the life to come, although there remaine (by reason of the mixte condition of this life) certain differences of these povvers: yet notvvithstanding.
they are so among themselues disposed and placed in their orders, that euen as euery one of them dravveth neare, vnto the life to come, so it ought more and moreto gouerne all the residue.
But it is manifest, that euerie kingly or ciuill povver, is also among them, that are not the me~bers of Christ.
Neither any vvhit lesse appeareth it, that the povver of the Pastors and teachers is placed and appointed in the only Church of God, for the edifying thereof in Iesu Christe.
VVherevpon it is euicted, that the spiritual power of the pastors of the church, dravveth nearer to the state of the life to come, than any other povver, or familie, or earthly co~mon wealth.
For Pastors are placed in the Churche to this purpose, that they shoulde vvatche for our soules, teach, baptise, dispence the mysteries of Christe, giue open sinners vnto Sathan, and in the person of Christe to forgiue them that are sorie for their sinnes, according to the Lorde.
To conclude, that they by their keys should bring so vvel earthly kings, as other me~ into the kingdome of heauen.
Sithe therefore as Christe the Lorde of all, worthily gouerneth so wel the spiritual as the earthly power: and sith the spirituall power floweth not from Christe, but as he is redeemer of mankinde, and that power is properly ordeined and prouided for the getting of eternall life: neither by any meanes can it be saide or thought of a vviseman, that Christe vvoulde haue the earthly povver aboue the spirituall in his Church, vvhich is all led by the spirite, and ought to be lifted aboue all earthly things.
Truely it is necessarie that in the Churche of Christe vvhiche is one, the onely spirituall povver shoulde rule, and that the povver of the father, the husbande, the Lorde, yea, and of the King himselfe shoulde be altogither vnder the povver of the Pastors appointed of Christ, vvhen the matters of the life to come are handled.
Except Master Saunders of vaine glorie, did either delight to much to heare himself, or of subtletie, went about to tyre and wrappe his Readers: he woulde neuer vse so many wordes to so litle purpose.
Muche of this is nothing but that he hath spoken before, and is here in vaine repeated, much of it is cleane besides the matter.
The summe is this, that all estates (as touching spirituall matters) are altogyther vnder the spirituall Pastors.
The effecte of all this long drift, standeth on these two reasons: the one of the difference of ye two powers, to proue the spiritual to be the better: the other of the vnion of bothe powers, to proue the Priestes alone to rule them both.
What he hath tolde vs heretofore of the difference, concerning the original, the vse, and the end of bothe, we haue hearde alreadie, and it is néedelesse to repeat.
And likewise, that all ciuill and kingly povver, is as well out of the Church of God, as in the Church of God, the spirituall power only in the Church, is alredy answered vnto.
And in al these actio~s, that he reckoneth vp, the King is likewise graunted the inferior.
Howbeit here is nothing that the King is inferior, in things belonging to his kingdome.
But what is al this to ye present purpose, that the Priest may depole the King? he reasoneth of the mon of these powers, that they are all one in Christ, that Christ hath both in him, and ruleth both, so well the secular as the spirituall· and this is likewise answered last vnto.
Put that here vpon the power of all estates, is altogether vnder the pastors power: that is not hetherto proued.
And yet we denie not, but that the power of all these estates, Father, Husband, Lorde and King, is vnder the pastors power, but not altogether vnder it.
And so we say that all these powers, yea the pastors and all, are vnder the Kings power, but not altogether vnder it.
All estates are vnder the pastors power, bycause hée teacheth all estates of men, how to liue in their vocations.
All estates are vnder ye Kings power, bycause he ouerséeth, in al estates, the maintenance of the same.
So that (as Master Saunders rightly saith) there is no difference and there is a difference, and there is a mixture of these powers.
There is no difference, in respect that all are partakers of the vnitie in Christ: in regarde wherof, neither Priest nor Prince are better, the one than the other, or the people worse than both, sith all are one in Christ.
There is a difference, in respecte of the order and gouernment of the Church, which is so distinguished in difference of degrées and callings, that as the wife maye not take vpon hir the husbandes office: nor the sonne the fathers, nor the seruant the maisters: so neither the past or maye take vpon him the office of the King: nor the King the office of the pastour.
And there is a mixture, in respect that the pastor directeth, by teaching of all estates, and spareth not the Prince: and that the Prince directeth by gouerning of all estates, and spareth not the pastor.
But this mixte power of entermedling, confoundeth not the one power with the other: neither maye the Prince vsurpe the authoritie due to the pastor, nor the pastor vsurpe the authoritie due to the Prince.
As the one therefore is not confounded and yet medled with the other: so the one hath both inferiorship and superioritie ouer the other, and yet is neither altogether inferior, or altogether superior to the other, as here M. Saunders on ye vnion and mixture, difference no difference of these two powers, concludes, to exalt the pastor to such an absolute superioritie ouer the Princes, yt at their liking misliking, they mighto depose the~.
But now M. Sand. to confirme this, that ye pastor is altogether, in spirituall matters, aboue the Prince, procéedeth saying: For as the fleshely man perceiueth not the things that are of the spirit of God: so neither the fleshly power, gouerneth those things that are of the spirite of God.
For althoughe Kings gouerne the members of Christe, yet notwithstanding they gouerne them not, in respect that they are the ine~bers of Christ, but in that they are yet occupied in secular businesse.
For the members of Christ may want a King, as in times past, almost for three thousand yeares, eue~ fro~ the beginning of the world, vntill the kingdome of Saul, they wanted an earthly King.
But yet the members of Christ neuer wanted some pastor, bicause faith is by hearing, hearing by the word of God.
But those that preached the word of Christ, they were the pastors of the flocke.
The argument is this, That which hath no perceuerance of things that are of the spirit of God, ought to haue no superioritie in things that are of the spirit of God.
But the Princes power hath no perceuerance, of things that are of the spirit of God: How proue you this M. Saunders? The fleshly power hath no perceuerance.
Such as the man is, such is the power: But the Prince is but a fleshly man: Proue this t, M. Saunders.
He which hath only respect to secular busines, is but a fleshly man.
But kings haue onely respect to secular businesse: Proue me this also, M. Saunders.
Although Kings gouerne the members of Christ, yet they gouerne them not in respect that they are members of Christ, Ergo, they gouerne them onely in secular businesse.
If Kings gouerne the~, as me~bers of Christ, then would they neuer haue wanted the gouernement of kings: but almost for
yeares, they wa~ted the kings'gouernme~t vntil Saul came: Ergo, kings gouerne the~ not, in that they are me~bers of Christ.
Is all your drift come to this (M. Saunders) to run from the matter, to ye name of kings? what if neither the name nor estate of kings were before ye time of Saul? was not the people of God alwayes gouerned euen fro~ the beginning with a ciuil or politike Magistrate? cal him King or Prince, or Patriark, or Duke, or Iudge, or what you will, do you inueygh here onely againste Kings? is it the name of King that you beare such spite vnto, to call it, but a fleshly power? as though Sathan hadeuen fleshed you against kings.
For what more grosse or bestiall name, can you giue the gouernment of the Turkes infidels, than here you terme the power persons of Christia~ kings? but al these argume~ts are false M. Saund. the Church of Christ neuer wanted magistrats: ye magistrates were not only themselues (if they were good) the members of Christ (although they had a fleshly part, the old man in the~, as euen the pastors haue also) but they had a speciall charge and regard to their subiects, eue~ in yt they were me~bers of Christ.
Not, that they toke vpon them the office of spirituall pastors, to preach gods word vnto the~, administer the sacraments, except som of them were such persons, as might not only, ouersée it done of others, but might or ought the~selues to do it: as all the Patriarches ordinarilye, till Aarons time, and some of the Priests and Prophets extraordinarily, and very seldome afterwardes chosen therevnto: but this was the duetie of all the Magistrates, which all the good Princes, did principallie looke vnto, howsoeuer other did neglecte or abuse the same.
This therefore (Maister Saunders) is a foule sclaunder, to speake so lewdly on Christian Princes, and also a contradiction to your former saying, that theyr estate was spirituall.
Yea howe doth this agree with your words next following.
VVherefore (say you) sith Kings and pastours, do now come together into one body of the Church, and the powers of the~ before distinguished, oughte nowe to serue one Christe, to wit, eyther of them in their place and order: but most certaine it is, that the spirituall power, which is instituted for the church is knit more nerer with Christe, than the power of earthlye Kings, which is appoynted to defende men in earthly peace, not onely within, but also without the Churche of Christe: see not, but that he hath loste his common sense in iudging gods matters, if any man contende that the spirituall power of the Church is not aboue the earthly power of Kings· What soeuer you see, or see not (M. Saunders) see you haue a great conceite of your selfe: that thus in your conclusion almost of euery argumente, you make all men fooles, doltes, and madde, and out of their wits and to want reason common sense and to be no better than beasts? if they denie that that you affirme.
Whether it come of the contempte of others, or of the pride of your selfe, that makes you to vse these speaches so often, let other wiser Iudge, for we are fooles and madde men in your opinion.
But if you be not blinde in your owne conceite, doe you not see what contraries still you vtter to make the Princes power oth fleshely and spirituall: to stretch to furder endes than bodily peace, yet to stretch no furder? but these are your olde contradictions.
You tell vs of a superioritie, and a superioritie we haue graunted.
Neither haue we so loste our common sense, but that we see your false packing, in charging vs to contende, that the spirituall power of the Churche, is not aboue the earthly power of Princes.
For, neither do we denie the superioritie of the spirituall power of the Churche: neither do we graunt the power of Christian Princes, to be onely an earthly power.
But what is this for the priest to depose the Prince? God be thanked, we haue not so loste our common sense, but that we see you straggle from the question.
But let vs sée if you come any néerer to it.
For if neither parte be ouer the other, howe in one body of the Churche, do bothe powers abide, beeing not vnited: or howe are they vnited, if they yet abide so distinguished, that one can not gouerne the other? or who euer sawe in one body of a liuing creature, two members vtterly distinguished, placed in one place and honor? who hathe seene (except in a monstruous body) the foote made equall to the arme, the thighe to the necke, the legge to the fide? But and if the kingly and spirituall power are not altogither equall members, distinguished onely in number, as two handes, two feete, and two eyes (for those that differ in originall, in vse, and in ende, can neuer be equall) or else they be also thinges vtterly seuered, bicause they be vnited and filled togither in one body of the Churche: we must needes confesse that they differ in the placing of them, and yet they are continued in the compasse of one body.
Héere is Sim Suttle, M. Saunders, of all that euer sée.
man had néede haue more than common sense, that shall vnderstande this geare, althoughe he studie for it, you couet to speake so darkely.
We go playnely to worke, we graunt that the ecclesiastical power, and the polytical power are two distinct powers.
We graunt, that they are ioyned togither in one body of the Churche of Christ.
We graunt also, that the one hathe in some respects, a superioritie, and in other respectes an inferioritie to the other.
We do not confounde them béeing thus ioyned, and yet distinguished) the one in the same or like place with the other.
It is your selues that woulde thus confound them, giuing bothe the powers vnto one person, and confounde one member wyth another, and make a monstrous body.
We attribute not both powers to the Prince, as you do to your Pope.
We affirme that the Prince differeth from the Bishop, the Bishop from the Prince.
We affirme that bothe are members of the mysticall body of the Church of Christ, and bothe rule the other members, and that as me~bers too.
We affirme the Bishops power, in respect of his ministerie, in exhorting and rebuking, is aboue the Princes: and the Princes in respect of his gouernment, in maynteyning punishing, is aboue the Bishops.
So that héere is not one, or the like place and honor geuen to bothe: but bothe haue suche places as are fitte for either.
And thus as the head is superior in one respect, co~cerning iudgement, inuention, and memorie: and the harte is superior in another respect, concerning lyfe and will: so the Bishop may be graunted a superior member in the body of the Church, in one respect, and the Prince superior in another.
What monstrous body is héere, or what confusion or rather not in your owne darke spéeches, instling confounding these things togither, that your Pope might haue both powers in him, but still what is this to the purpose, that Bishops may depose Kings? VVhether of these therfore (say you) shal obtaine the chiefer parts in the body of the Churche? shall not the spirituall power, which is giuen of God himself by Iesus Christ, to that end that it might minister iustice, spirite and life vnto vs? as for the kingly power came in deede fro~ God, but not onely properly by Christ, as he is the Sauior: but also by the sense of the minde conspiring, the will of the people, whether it were faithful or vnfaithful: neither could of it self at any time pertaine vnto heaue~, or minister life vnto hir subiects.
If therfore the chiefe parts in the body of the Church belong to the spirituall power· truely that ought of righte to gouerne and rule the kingly and all earthly power, that is founde in the same body of the Church.
think aboue twentie times we haue graunted you the due superioritie of the true spiritual power.
put to these words due, and true, bicause, neither is your spiritual power, the true spiritual power but rather an earthly and carnall power, and that spiritualnesse that it hathe, is rather from the spirituall power of darknesse, than of the spirite of truthe, and was neuer of God, nor by Christ, nor administreth iustice, spirite, nor lyfe, but iniquitie, sensualitie, and death: nor pertayneth to heauen, but leadeth to hell, meane the spirituall power of the Popishe spiritualtie.
The spirituall power of the Ministers of Christe, graunte dothe all these thinges you speake of, and therefore it hathe a superioritie, but suche as is due vnto it, in the ministration of these aforesayde things, and not to encroche vpon suche superioritie as belongeth to Christian Princes.
But, to stayne the Princes power, you call it earthly, and so it is in some respecte, but it is heauenly in other respects also, bicause it came from God, and it representeth the diuine power of God.
It came from God (you saye) but not by Christe, but by the peoples consent.
Howe true this is, is partly answeres before, and S. Paule sayth, Omnis potestas est Deo, all power is of God.
Is not Christ God? howe then came it not from Christ? And is not this spoken of the wisedome of God, which is Christ, Per me reges regnant, Kings rule by me? You make exception, not by Christ, as sauiour.
Is not Christ aswel a sauiour, in yt he is king, as he is a sauior, in yt he is Priest.
Not that (say you) the Princes power, of it selfe pertaynes to heaue~, or ministreth life.
What it doth of it selfe, we force not, M. Sand. we speake of Christian kinges, representing Christe the sauior.
Not that the Kinges power saueth, no more doth the Priestes power, but onely the power of Christ, yt is both King and Priest: but that by either of these, Christ worketh meanes towardes our saluation. and so bothe pertayne to heauen, and minister life also: the Bishops power, in setting foorthe Gods worde and Sacrame~ts: the Princes power in ouerséeing that both the Bishops and clergie set them foorthe duely, and that the people duetifully recoyue them.
But still what is this to the purpose, for the Bishop to depose Princes, shall we neuer come to our matter agayne? this is a long vagarie.
But go on M. Sand. euen whether you list to wander.
For as in the same body of man all the members ought to obey the commaundement of reason onely of the minde, bicause in the same body is nothing higher than the minde: so also in the Churche, whiche is like a mans body, sithe the spirituall power gouerneth as the minde and reason: all other power that is founde in the Churche besides, ought of necessitie to be subiect to the spirituall power: Ought saye to be subiect, not euery where, nor altogither, but onely in those things that pertaine to the saluation of soules, and to the proper iurisdiction of the Churche.
And haue you spyed this nowe· M. Sanders, that the spirituall power in the churche, is like to the rule of reason in our body, but onely in these things? How then pertayneth it to depose kinges, to dispose, translate, and occupie kingdomes, to cause subiects rebell, which is the proper question héere in hande.
Do these thinges, pertaine to saluation, are these thinges the proper iurisdiction of the Churche· then surely it is a proper Churche, and it hath a proper iurisdiction, or we shall make a proper saluation of oules, and you haue made a proper péece of worke, so properly to proue your argument of the Princes deposition, for the whiche sill rie for some proofe, but you haue belike forgotten it.
For shame M. Saund. come once agayne to your matter: but go to, nowe at the length, you wil drawe neerer to it.
For if the earthly power do iniurie to the spouse of Christ, or do not defende it from the iniurie of other, when it may, or in any thing faynte from iustice and truthe: those that gouerne the church of God, ought to admonish the ciuil Magistrate, that he should decline from euill and do good.
But and if the ciuill Magistrate will not so amende himselfe, they must make haste to other remedies, for it can not be in a wel ordered citie, but that for euery euill that may fall out, there is a remedie prepared.
For remembring at length your idle vagarie, you drawe neerer to your matters, for the Princes deposing.
And héere you presuppose thrée things: either that the Church hath iniurie offred hir by ye Prince: either that the Prince, where he may, defendes hir not from others iniuries: either that he himself faynteth from iustice and truthe.
Héere, say you, what remedie? Those that gouerne the Church of God, ought to admonishe the ciuill Magistrate, that he shoulde decline from euill, and do good For the admonition, it is well and truly sayde, M. Sand. and would to God the Pastors woulde thus do in these your presupposed cases· But héere is no deposition of the Magistrate.
Howbeit craftily euen héere you haue as good as deposed him already.
For you make your selues ose only that gouerne the Church of God: and call the Prince· but the ciuill Magistrate, as thoughe he gouerned not also the Church of God and had nothing to do therwith, but onely with ciuill affaires, and that the Priestes haue all the gouernaunce of Gods Churche.
But as this is false, neither haue you, nor can you proue this, but still reason, petitione principij, taking that for an vndoubted true principle, that is chiefly denied, that you are the onely gouernors of the Church of God.
So nowe, that whiche you presuppose in the Prince, let vs presuppose the like in you.
If you that call your selues the Church· haue at any time done to the Prince: trow you, ye neuer did it? Did your Pope neuer iniurie to the Emperour? did your bishops neuer iniurie to kings? did your spiritualtie neuer iniurie to the laytie? thinke (for shame) you will not denie it.
If you do, you shall haue witnesses inow, of your owne side against you.
Agayne, did your Pope neuer suffer iniurie to be done to Princes, and might haue helped it, and did not? denie it you can for shame.
Moreouer, did your Pope his Clergy neuer saynt from iustice and truth? you dare not séeke to couer it, it is so open and confessed.
What remedie now to amend these things? the gouernors of the Church (say you) must admonish the~ to decline from euill, and do good.
Who are these gouernors of the Churche that ye speake of? our selues, say you.
that you would enter into iudgement with your selues, and admonishe your selues.
But now running headlong in your faults, and wil not heare them tolde of any other, but thinke you do well, he that shal tel you the contrarie, you wil tell him he is an heretike, if he come in your clawes, you will burne him, although he were some of your owne companie (for so you haue serued diuers that haue rebuked your faults errors) yea, you are so sotted on your selues, that you maintein you can not erre: how roughly wil you admonish your selues, how soone shall all the worlde looke for your amendment? Is not this a plaine mockerie with ye world world? is it not more than time for Christian princes, that are in déede ye gouernors of the Churche, to admonishe you? denie not, but you may, yea ought to admonish the Prince also, if he be suche an offender as you imagine.
But that you oughte to be the onely admonishers of them, and not your selues of them to be admonished· you sée the inconuenience.
And yet there is a difference betwéene admonishing and gouerning, and a greater difference betwéene admonishing deposing.
But by little and little you drawe to wards it.
But what and if the Prince (say you) will not amend him selfe? And what (say I) if the Priestes wil not amend the~ selues? we must make hast (say you) to other remedies Yea, but not suche haste (M. S) that you break your snnes: and much lesse such hast, that you breake the ordinaunce of God.
For in such haste is more waste than spéede, the end of it neuer wanteth o.
We graunt you, there are remedies in the Church of God for such inconueniences: but no such remedies, as for the subiect to attempt to depose his Soueraigne, and stirre the people to rebellion.
But if any (say you) beeing admonished, amende not him selfe, we are bidden to denounce him to the Church.
VVho if if he will not heare the Church, is to be accounted as an Ethnike or a publicane.
Are you bidden, M. Sanders, if he be your Prince, to renounce your ciuil polytike obedience that you ought him, yea although he were in déede an Ethnike? if you find this, you come somwhat néerer to ye purpose: else you do not only wrest this, place, which is not spoken of Princes, but also straggle cleane from the matter in question.
But now (say you) if any King not hearing the Church, be permitted to holde and administer his kingdome ouer Christians: who seeth not, all the people, ouer whome that King ruleth, to come into most certaine danger of losing the faith? for that saying is no lesse true than auncient.
After the example of the king, the whole world is framed.
So while only Ieroboam (as sayd before) worshipped two Calues, the one in Bethel, the other in Dan, and appoynted Priestes, not of the sonnes of Leui, but of the basest of the people: This thyng became an offence to tenne Tribes, and for the greatest parte of Israell the faythe peryshed.
The danger and offence is great (we graunt) of Princes thus offending.
But for subiects to depose their Princes, for these dangers or offences: the danger and offence were not remedied but augme~ted.
For what Prince were not then in danger if you would lay these offences to his charge, were he neuer so giltlesse of them? if he neuer so little offended you, ye might say, he did you iniurie, or he suffered other to do it, he helped you not, he foughte not in your quarell, agaynst those Princes, on whome you woulde haue set him.
If he swarued at any time from iustice, or but spoke a worde awrie, yea if he but saynted from those things you woulde haue him do, would not acknowledge yt he so dyd, who you reproued him for it, when you tolde it one to another (for you call your selues the Church then in all poste haste the prince must be cou~ted as an Ethnike, or a publicane, be deposed fro~ his kingdome, the people muste rebell.
In what danger by this doctrine, both the Prince the people stand, your selues also ye teach this dangerous doctrine, is appara~t.
The exa~ple of Ieroboam is a greater case, but as great as it was, neither ye priests nor ye prophets atte~pted to depose Ieroboa~, nor the people rebelled agaynst him, no nor the tribe of Iuda, nor Roboa~ were permitted to war against him, for all this great losse danger that the people receiued by him.
Sithe therefore (say you) the wisdome of God hathe not lefte the Churche of God (whiche is a citie excellently founded, and defenced without a medicine, which it may giue to suche a disease: neither is there any other medicine can helpe, than that which taketh away so euill a king from among the people, and giueth the kingdome to a better man: we muste beleeue, that suche power is graunted at the least to the chiefe Pastor of the Churche, in these wordes: feede my sheepe: and whatsoeuer thou bindest in earth, shall be bounde also in heauen.
So that the chiefe Pastor can not onely excommunicate a wicked king, but also set his subiectes free from al obedience of him.
The wisedome of God (as you say M. Sanders) hathe not lefte the Church of God without medicines for suche diseases.
Gods worde is euen a storehouse of plaisters, as well Co~solidatiues, as Corrosies, for the Ministers of Christs to apply them to any infected members.
But these medicines that are taken out of the worde of God, you despise and reiecte as too base simples, vaunt of your owne compoundes.
There is a medicine in gods word called: In patientia vestra possidebitis animas vestras, shall possesse your soules in patience, when a wicked Prince oth vexe them.
There is another called In fide fundati stabiles, beyng founded in faith and stable.
Another called: Ad te leuaui oculos meos, haue lifted vp mine eyes to thee. &c.
Another, In Domino confido, non timebo quid mihi faciat hom.
put my confidence in the Lorde, will not feare what man can doe vnto me.
Another called, beati qui persecutionem patiuntur propter iustitiam, Blessed are they that suffer persecution for righteousnesse.
And in déede there is such a medicine too, as you sy, vt auferatur de medio populi, that he should be taken from among the people.
But there is but one Phisition, that knoweth the right confection of ye strong purgation, and that is God himselfe.
Ministers of diuerse sortes he hath by whom he giueth this medicine, but neuer read that any godly Bishop or Prieste or faithfull subiecte, did euer minister it to his Soueraigne.
The texte that you cite hereto, is not as you cite it, auferat regem adeo malu~ de medio populi, that may take away so euil a king from among the people: but auferte malum ex vobis ipsis take awaye the euill from among you: not the Prince from among the people.
For that were to take away one euill with another.
And how should this euill be taken awa? Ne commisceamii fomicarijs. &c. be you not mingled together, or kepe no familiaritie with fornicators.
He saith not, depriue him of hys life or liuing, but be not defiled with his wickednesse.
And ye greatest censure that s. Paule speaketh of, is exco~munication, pertaining properly not to the goods and bodies, but to the soules of men.
Neither speaketh he there at all of Princes but of priuate men and equals in the Church of Christ, who~ calleth brethren.
For the Kings and Princes at that time, were Christened.
And he speaketh of such, as they might lawy sun their companie, such as Lyra calleth Ribaldes, or verlets, drunkards, whorehunters, Idolaters: but not such as in the Ciuill polycie they muste néedes obey, nor those that were out of the Church of Christ.
haue written to you (saith he) by an epistle, that you should not intermingle your selues with fornicators: not vtterly from fornicators of this world, or couetous persons, or rauenous, or worshippers of Images, else should ye go out of this world.
But nowe haue written to you that ye intermingle not your selues.
If any which is called a brother be a whoremaister, or couetous person, or a worshipper of Images, or a sclaunderer, or a drunkerd, or a rauener, with suche an one we shoulde not eate meate.
For what haue to do, to iudge them that are without? do not you iudge of them that are within? as for those that are without, God iudgeth.
Nowe saith M. Saunders, that S. Paule speaketh of taking away so euill a King from among the people, and this he setteth downe in distinct letters, as though S. Paule had ment the Priests should depose an euill King from gouerning the people.
Where he speaketh not to the Priestes but to the people, and would haue them shunne the company of suche false brethren as were among them.
But M. Saunders will say, doth not this stretch to a king, so well as to any other, if he be a brother in ye faith of Christ? graunt it doth, in that he is a brother.
And if he be infected with such vices, hée also is so farre forth to be shunned.
But not to be shunned in that he is a Prince and gouernor of the people: muche lesse the people to forsake their obedience to his authoritie, bycause they must forsake their obedience to his vices.
He maye be so shunned priuately, as the publique gouernement be not shunned, he may be iudged of the faithfull, in their courte of conscience, concerning his crime, but he maye not be iudged in their Courte of Consistorie, concerning his worldly power: he maye be taken héede of, but not taken awaye: he maye be euen excommunicated also by the ministers, but not by them deposed: bicause, howsoeuer he deserueth it, yet haue they no authoritie that stretcheth so farre.
But now sir, what and if the Prince be not onely no such malefactor, but goeth about to resorme these malefactours, where as other priuate men, can but shunne their companie, and the ministers of Christ can but excommunicate them, which though it be neuer so great a censure, yet they estéeme it not: and that the Prince will punishe suche malefactors in their goods and bodies, yea and take them awaye from among the people by death, banishmente, prisonment or otherwise, as his office requireth he should do, to whom the sworde is giuen against the malefactor? what now if it fall oute, that the Popishe Priestes be the greatest malefactors in these notorious crimes? what if they be not only priuate whore maisters, but also publike maynteiners of bankes and stewes for whores, and dispisers and restrainers of honorable matrimonie? what if the Popish Priests be so couetous and rauenous, that they haue gotten almoste the wealth of all Christian kingdomes into their fingrings, and are neuer satisfied with deuising naughtie meanes, to picke mens money out of their purses? what if the Popishe Priests be worshippers of Images, and causers of them to be worshipped? what if manye of them be common drunkardes, and all of them drunken with spirituall drunkennesse, which is a great deale worse? what if the Popishe Priestes be sclaunderers of those that be in authoritie, and woulde take the Kings sworde and Scepter oute of his hande, and pull his Diademe off his heade, and plucke his roabe from his backe, and turne hym quite oute of hys throne and Kingdome and byd hym goe shake hys eares, and styrre all hys subiectes to rebellion? what if all these, and an infinite sorte of other horrible crymes, were founde in the Popishe priests themselues? oughte not this rule of Sainte Paule to take place on them, and all Christians to abhorre and shunne them, and all Princes to depose and punishe them.
Nowe, whether the Popishe Priestes be culpable in these crimes or no: thinke the crie of Sodome and Gomorre did not more astende vp to heauen, than the crie of the Popishe Priests abhomination resoundeth in all the earth.
And thus this sentence that Maister Saunders thought to wrest against Princes, if it be well examined, falleth more out against the Priests themselues.
VVe must beleue (sayth he) that this power, to take away the Prince, and giue his Kingdome to a better· is grau~ted at the least to the chief pastor of the Church, in these wordes, feede my sheepe, and whatsoeuer thou bindest in earth shall be bound in heauen also.
In so muche that the chiefe pastor maye not onely excommunicate a wicked King, but also set free his subiectes from all obedience of him.
And finde you this in these two sentences Maister Saunders? we must beleeue it, say you, that this power is giuen at the least to the chiefe pastor, in these wordes.
Howe shall we beleeue it, Maister Saunders, sith these wordes neither say, nor import any such matter, that Peter (to whom they were spoken) is the chief pastor of the Church, neither at the least, nor at the most: least of all, that in these wordes these things are contained.
Christ saith to Peter, feede my shepe· you expounde these wordes, that he gaue him power, to take away Kings from their kingdomes, and to set the people at libertie from their sworne obedience.
This is a proper feeding (M. Saunders to giue them pappe with an hatchet, as they say, to spoyle Kings and st their kingdomes in the vprores of rebellion· Christ not his shepe on th fashion nor we reade that euer Peter them so, but with the worde of God, and with exhortatio~ of obedience vnto Princes.
Peter fead the shéepe of Christ on this wise: Be ye subiect to euery humaine creature, for the Lordes sake, whether to the King as excelling, or to his rulers, as those that are sent of him, to the punishment of malefactors, and to the prayse of them that do well, for so is the will of God.
For doyng well, you stoppe the mouthes of foolishe and ignorant men.
As free, and yet not hauing libertie for a cloake of malice, but as seruantes of God.
Honor all men, loue brotherhood, feare God, honor the King.
Let seruants be subiect to the Lord with feare, not only if they be good and gentle, but if they be froward. &c.
And so he entreth into an exhortation of pacience, vnder wicked gouernors.
This is the féeding that Peter fead the shéepe of Christ withall: neither did huer depose any Magistrate, or set at libertie any subiects, or vsurpe any kingly dominion, but dissuadeth the clergie from it.
As for the other sentence of authorizing Peter to bynde and lose, is so farre from giuing him authoritie, to bynde Princes in bondage and captiuitie, making the~ to lose their kingdomes, and losing their subiectes from their bondage of subiection, setting them at libertie to rebell and chose another: that if Maister Saunders were not too too shamelesse he would neuer thus apply it.
And yet he saith we must beleue it· that in this sentence also, Peter hath this power gyuen him, which neither Christ, nor Peter vsed at any time, but both of them flat denie it.
But why shoulde we beleeue this M. Saunders? For (say you) if whatsoeuer Peter or Peters successor loseth in earth, is also losed in heauen: then verily, when he loseth orderly the faithfull subiects, from the obedience of a wicked King in earth: the subiects are in heauen losed, from the obedience of that King.
Besides, if whatsoeuer Peters successor bindeth in earth, be bound also in heauen: then when soeuer the successor of Peter, rightly and well commaundeth anye King to go from his Magistracie, which (being thus affected) he vniustly holdeth: or co~mau~deth him, by whatsoeuer meanes he can, to hinder another King, that hindreth the faithful people from eternal life, that he should not perishe in doyng wickedly: that King is bounde also in heauen, that is to saye before God and his Angels, to obey the decree of the chiefe Bishop, except he will haue his owne sinnes before God, to be retained and not remitted.
Here is your Sampsons poste, M. Sau~ders, that you, and your Pope builde vpon, for his supremacie that he hath the keyes of heauen and hell vnder his belte, but howe grossely and shamefully this spirituall power of bynding and losing, consisting in preaching the word of God, and pertaining only to the soule of the faithfull beleuer, or the vnfaithfull refuser, is applied to the body goods of men, to be taken from them: is wrested to co~maunding of Kings to get the~ packing from their kingdomes: to bydding of subiectes take armes against their Princes: to bidding of one King, by whatsoeuer meanes he can, by defying fighting, and making warre, by shéeding Christia~ blood, by violating peace, by breaking leagues, by wasting one anothers cou~tries, to molest and persecute one another: that all Princes nations are bound before God and his Angels, to obey his bidding, yea, althoughe he were such a chiefe B. or the successor of Peter, as he craketh, is not: is so horrible shameful a wresting of Christs saying, so euident a contradiction to all other sayings in the scripture, so open a gappe to the dissolution of all estates, to bring all tumult confusion into the world: yea, this binding and losing were such a binding vp of all godlynesse, and the verie losing of the deuill himself: that it is maruaile that euer any Papist professing learning, would be so grosse (in this age of greater learning) thus to expounde it.
Which exposition was neuer heard of by any godly father, till Pope Gregorie.
following him, set all Christendome by the eares about it.
And nowe that all the worlde séeth the follie and wickednesse of it, M. Saunders so unpudently would renue it.
But he hathe a shifting restrainte in this exposition, to salue the matter.
When the Pope (sayth he) duely and orderly loseth the people from their obedience, and when he well and rightly biddeth the king giue ouer his authoritie, the~ either of them are bound to obey his bidding.
True, Maister Saunders when he doth these things duly and orderly well and rightly: the~ it shall be graunted you.
But how can he do that, well and rightly, duely and orderly: that is most euil, and against all dutie, right and order? can a théefe steale well and rightly? can such extreme wickednesse that passeth all priuate thefte, and is the open breach of all due order, be dulie and orderly done? But belike M. Sau~ders thinketh, if the Pope do it in his consistorie, if he haue on his Cope, and do it in his Pontificalibus, if the belles be roong the candels put out: then it is well and rightly, duely and orderly done.
Such toyishe orders vseth the Pope to bleare the simple, as though, when it is done with booke, bell candle, it is done well and rightly, duely and orderly: but before God and his Angels in heauen, and before all wise and godly learned me~ in earth, as these orders are mere ridiculous: so these doyngs are most abhominable.
But nowe let vs heare his reason for this doyng.
For if whatsoeuer power any king hath, he ought to conuert and applie that wholly to the honor of Christ: then he that otherwise doth, shall in the day of doome, render an account of sin, whe~ euen that sword it selfe (which in times paste he hath either drawe~ out against Christ, or else he would not draw for Christ) shall accuse him of disobedience.
If therfore we shall follow reaso~ aright, as the Minister of Christ ought not to co~secrate him for Prince, whom he seeth not to be a Christia~ or a Catholike: so neither ought he, to suffer him to beare gouernme~t any long while ouer Christia~s, who~ by any lawful meanes he ca~ remoue.
For the Lord hath subdued to his minister Ieremie, as wel the kingly persons as their kingdomes, saying: Behold haue put my words in thy mouth, behold haue this day set thee ouer nations, and ouer kingdomes, to roote vp, to destroy, to leese, to scatter, to build and plant.
VVhich wordes fall oute moste aptly on the person of Christe.
But no Catholike doubteth, but from him, they are dayly fulfilled in his Church by his ministers.
That the Prince ought to conuert and apply all his power to the honor of Christ, we graunt.
And if he abuse his sword in drawing it againste Christe, or not defending the sayth of Christ thereby, we graunt likewise, at the day of doome the Prince shall answere for it.
And therefore Princes had nede to be wise and learned, to looke the better vnto it.
Which if they did, they must néedes draw it out against your Pope and you in principall.
But if their sworde (that God gaue vnto them, and they haue missused) shall accuse them: what shall the rust of the gold and riches do, that the Pope hath ill gotten and worse spent? what shall his triple crowne and vsurped title doe, what shal the Crosse keyes do, that he pretends, he hath from Peter, and the sworde from Paule, embrued with so much blood of the Saintes of God? shall not these things muche more accuse the Pope, at that greate daye of reckoning? But how holdeth this conclusion here vpon? If the Prince abuse his sword, shall the Pope wring it from him? surely then the Princes sworde, that the Pope hath thus extorted, and he was forbidden to meddle withall, shall accuse him also.
But Maister Saunders saith, he may take it from him, so that he take it by lawfull meanes: as though a man may doe another wrong, by lawful meanes: as though he may vsurpe by lawfull meanes that, that by no meanes he oughte to doe: as though there can be any meanes lawfull to doe that, that is not lawfull to be done.
But that it is lawfull, he citeth the saying of God to Ieremie, cap.
This sentence is also cited in the Extrauagant of Pope Boniface, and applyed, as here Maister Saunders doth, that the Ministers of God may order kingdomes, as the wordes seme to specifie, according to the letter.
But where did Ieremie rule any nations and kingdomes, roote vp houses, destroy Cities, pull downe buildings, builde and plante newe in their places? thinke, M. Saunders, you can not shewe that euer Ieremie did this, neither can you in suche sense applie it to Christe, on whose person, you say, aptly it falleth out, sithe Christ in his person, literally, did not these thinges neither.
And then can it not serue your turnes, to gouerne Nations kingdomes, to roote vp houses, to destroy kinges and depopulate their Countreys, Townes, and Cities, and to translate at your pleasures the whole estate of Christendome.
Ieremie did neuer thus, nor Christe did euer thus, nor his Ministers did euer thus, and therefore you doing thus, can not bolster your doings from them.
And if you will do this as Ieremie did, and as Christe hath taught, and as his Ministers did, good leaue haue you.
But how dyd they it? God sayth to Ieremie, Behold haue put my words in thy mouthe: wherevpon sayth Lyra: Bicause Ieremie not onely prophecied agaynst the King of Iuda, but also agaynst many other kingdomes, as shall appeare.
Therefore it followeth: Beholde haue set thee. &c. that thou shouldest roote vp, that is, thou shouldest declare in rooting vp, and translating from thence the Inhabiters, &c.
And shouldest buylde and plante, that is, thou shouldest declare the Iewes to be reedified and planted in their owne Countrey.
VVhich was fulfilled in the time of Cyrus, that gaue licence to the people, to returne into their owne Countrey, and reedifie the Temple: And in the time of Artaxerxes, who gaue licence to Nehemias to reedifie the Temple of Ierusalem.
So that this rooting vp was not done by Ieremie, nor this buylding agayne was done in his time: but was long after done by God, and by suche Ministers as God appoynted therevnto, whiche were no Priestes, but Princes.
Howbeit sithe it was Gods ordinaunce, he sayth, Ieremie shoulde do it, bicause Ieremie shoulde foretell it.
And therefore the learned Uatablus expoundes these wordes on this wise: put my worde in thy mouthe, that is, appoynt thee to be a Prophet: beholde, that is, marke those thinges that shall tell thee, that thou shalt threaten my enimies, whome haue planted, placed, confirmed, and buylded in their nations, that will pull them out by captiuities, excepte they repent: and contrarywise, wil builde againe and plante them, whome before destroyed and pulled vp· if they shall acknowledge their sinnes.
And for confirmation héereof, that this whiche he ascribeth to Ieremie, was Gods dooing, and Ieremie but the foreteller of it: he referreth vs, first, to the.
chapter, where God sayth to Ieremie concerning Baruch: Thou shalte say thus vnto him, Thus saithe the Lorde: Beholde, those things that haue edified, wil pul downe, and the thinges that haue planted, wil roote vp, yea al this lande.
chapter: If you abide and inhabite in this lande, wil builde you, and wil not pul you downe, wil plante you, and wil not pul you vp, bicause it repe~teth me of the euil that haue brought vpon you.
Thus we sée that Ieremie was not the doer of any of these thinges, he neuer deposed kinges nor translated kingdomes in all his lyfe, but onely declared to them Gods iudgementes to come vpon them and destroy them, if they repented not, Gods mercifull promises to comforte them if they repented.
Nowe on this fashion (if he will followe Ieremies fashion) shoulde the Pope and his Prelates pull downe, and set vp kinges and kingdomes, not by deposing them from their estates, not by seazing kingdoms into their handes, not by translating the gouernementes thereof, not by making subiects rebell agaynst their Soueraignes, not by setting Princes by the eares togither, not by putting all to fyre, sworde and famine: but by declaring to them the wrathe and plagues of God, but by exhorting them to repentaunce, but by recomforting them with Gods moste mercifull promises, but by preaching, and teaching them the worde of God: and thus onely to pull downe, and sette vp Kinges and kingdomes.
And further than this, the doing of Ieremie stretched not, nor the Ministers of Christ may do.
Now if you applye this sentence spiritually to Christe, and from him to his Ministers, we admitte also your application.
But where dyd Christe thus order worldely kingdomes? Nowe can you then from Christe, father these youre dooinges? Youre Glosse ioyned wyth Lyra, hathe these wordes: Multi bunc locum. &c Many expounde this place on the person of Christe, for Ieremie is interpreted, the highe one of the Lorde, who destroyed the kingdomes of the Diuell, whiche he shewed vnto him on the toppe of the Mountayne: hee destroyed the aduersarie powers, blotting out the handewriting of errour in his Crosse.
Of whome nexte to the hystoricall truthe, it is sayde in a figure: VVherefore did the Nations frette, and the people imagine vayne thinges, the Kinges of the earthe stoode vp, and the Princes came togither in one.
In the place of all these beeing destroyed, loste and pulled downe into hell, the Churche of God is builded vp and planted.
Thus saith your owne Glosse, in applying this sentence from Ieremie to Christe, concerning Christes pulling downe and setting vp of kingdomes.
And on this wyse oughte the Ministers of Christe, to pull downe and set vp kingdomes, that is, with the sworde of Gods worde, to beate down· the power of Sathan, the kingdome of errour, the buylding on the sandes, the workes of sinne, to roote vp vices, and to beate downe (as S. Paule termeth them) all strong holdes resisting the truthe of God, and to set vp the kingdome of Christ, to edifie his Church, to builde vpon the rocke, to plante vertues, and by doctrine and ensample enstruct the faythfull people.
And so dothe youre owne Glosse interprete it: Vt euellas mala, destruas regna Diaboli: That thou shouldest pull vp euils, and destroy the Kingdomes of the Diuell. &c. and shouldest edifie the Churche.
Wherevpon saythe the Glosse: To foure heauie thinges, two ioyfull thynges succeede, for neyther can good thinges be buylded, except the euill thinges be destroyed, neither can the best thinges be planted, excepte the worste thinges be rooted vp.
For euery plante that my heauenly father hathe not planted, shall be pulled vp by the rootes, and that buylding whiche is not buylded on the rocke, but vpon the sandes, is digged vp and destroyed with the worde of God.
But that which the Lorde shall consume with the spirite of his mouthe, that is, all sacrilegious and peruerse doctrine, he shall destroy it for euer, and those things that lifte vp them selues agaynst the kingdome of God, and truste in their wisedome.
VVhiche before God is foolishnesse, he shall scatter and put them downe, that for these the humble thinges mighte be edified.
And in place of the former thinges that are destroyed and pulled vp, those things may be buylded and planted, that are conuenient to the ecclesiastical truth, of whom it is saide, you are the buylding of God, you are the tilth of God.
Héere, M. Sand. euen by your owne glosse, is described, what this building and pulling downe is, that belongeth to the ministers of Christ, so farre vnlike your Popishe buylding, that it sheweth the ouerthrowe and rooting vp of your plantes and buylding, and howe your kingdome shall vtterly be destroyed.
In the ouerthrowing of whiche munitions and buylding the truth of God, the ministers of Christ muste so set themselues agaynst all worldly kingdomes, that fearing not their mighte and tyrannie agaynst the truthe, they ouercome them.
As God sayde to Ieremie: Girde vp thy loynes, and arise, and speake vnto them all those thinges that commaunde thee.
Feare not their faces, for wil make thee not to feare their faces.
For haue made thee this day, a strong citie, and an yron piller, and a brasen wall ouer al the lande, to the Kings of Iuda, and to the Princes therof, and to the Priests, and to the people thereof, and they shall not preuaile, for am with thee, saithe the Lorde, and wil deliuer thee.
If the kinges of Iuda (sayth the Glosse) whiche is interpreted, confession, and the Princes, and Priestes, and people of it, to witte, the Bishops, the Priestes and Deacons, and the vile and vnnoble vulgar people will arise agaynst an holy man: let him haue a strong faithe, and feare not, let him trust in God, and he shall conquere them.
Héere is the conquest of these kingdomes, whereby the true Ministers of God shall ouercome all Kings and Princes, all Bishops, Priestes, and Deacons, and all the people that resist them.
But this is as farre from deposing kings from their estates, from ruling, possessing, and translating earthly kingdomes: as you that séeke after all these things, are farre from Ieremies, from Christes, and from his Ministers conquests.
But (sayth M. Saunders) the Protestantes, who can not suffer, that the fleshe giue place vnto the spirite, or the temporall kingdome to the spirituall (for euery where they fauour too muche the fleshe and the worlde) before all thinges they alleage agaynst vs the saying of Christe, my kingdome is not of this worlde, we muste see therefore, what Christe in those wordes woulde haue vnderstoode, For the Protestantes wrest them hitherto, as thoughe the Ministers of the Church of Christ (which is the kingdom of God) may haue at any time no power ouer Christian Princes, or ouer their earthly kingdomes, and causes subiect to them, bicause the kingdome of Christ himselfe, is not of this worlde.
But in this thing they are too fouly deceyued: For it is another thing· not to be of this worlde: and farre another thing that the Christian kingdome that is in this world, shoulde not be subiect to Christ, and to the Ministers of Christ.
VVhen Christ denieth his kingdome to be of this worlde, either by the name of this world is vnderstoode sinne, and the tyrannie of sinne, and the masse of the reprobate (as the Lorde otherwhere faithe: you are not of the worlde, if you were of the worlde, the world would loue his owne, but haue chosen you out of the worlde) or else by the name of the worlde is vnderstoode, all this visible creature, whereof the faythfull also are parte so long as they liue heere.
If therefore by the worlde we vnderstand darknesse and sinne, and the reprobates of this world: certaine it is, the kingdome of Christ is by no meanes of this world, bicause all the kingdome of Christe is lighte, and darknesse is not in his kingdome, who lightneth euery man comming into this worlde.
But if by the worlde, we meane the visible creatures, and among them comprehe~d the Churche of God: verily denieth not that those creatures are subiect vnto him, or that these temporal kingdomes that beleeue in him, are comprehended vnder his eternall kingdome.
But he denieth that his kingdome is from hence, that is to say taketh his originall of this world as other kingdomes are wonte to do For the kingdome of Christe srang not from the law of nations, as other kingdomes do, but from the diuine and naturall yea and from the supernatural lawe.
VVherevpon Augustine marked, that Christe saide not, my kingdome is not heere, but it is not from hence, for in the worlde it is, but of the orlde it is not, but of heauen.
Héere M. Sand. hauing as he thinketh, confirmed his opinion, will now assay to confute our obiection agaynst it.
And to this purpose, he chooseth out the saying of Christ is Pilate, My kingdome is not of this world.
omit his sclanders, that we can not suffer· that the flesh should giue place to the spirit, that the spiritual Kingdome should rule the temporal, and that we fauour to much the fleshe and the worlde.
All whiche are but méere sclanders, and do fitter serue to reurne vpon the Papists.
But let vs come to his answere of this obiectio~, which graunt is one of our obiections vnto them, althoughe not (as he saythe) the chiefe obiection, but suche an one, as master Sanders with all his shiftes, is not able directly to answer to it.
First, what a worldly kingdome the Pope séeketh and possesseth, is apparant: in so muche that fewe worldly Kingdomes in worldly mighte and glorie are comparable vnto it.
Although (God be praysed) it decayeth dayly notwithstanding al his practises to repayre and vndershore the ruines therof.
Against this his worldly kingdome we obiect, that sithe he pretendes to be the Uicar of Christ, and Christ statly denieth his kingdome to be such a worldly kingdome: if the Pope he his Minister, he can not clayme nor enioy suche a worldly kingdome.
What fetche now can M. Sand. find, or any in all the worlde to elude this playne argument? we must (sayth he) distinguish of this worde, the worlde· which somtime signifieth sne, darknesse, and the reprobate.
In this sense Christes Kingdome is not of the world.
Sometimes the worlde signifieth all visible creatures: and in this sense, it is in the worlde, though it be not of the world, that is, it hathe not his originall of the world, but from God.
But this hindreth not, but that beeing in the world, worldly kingdomes may be subiect to it.
And so we sor not marking these distinctions are fly deceiued.
Whether we be deceyued, or you, M. Sanders, or whether we or you would deceiue others, all the worlde easily may perceiue.
We admitte your distinction, of beeing in the but not of the worlde.
Neyther disallowe we your significations of the worlde, althoughe subtilly you conceale those significations thereof, that it oughte to haue béene further distinguished into.
For the worlde signifieth often times, the glorie, mighte, riches, power, and pleasures of worldly thinges, especially when this worde Kingdome is ioyned to it.
And this is the very natural sense of a worldly kingdome, that is to say, a state in or of the worlde, excelli in these worldly thinges.
Nowe this, which is the very naturall sense, you yde, and runne about the with this and that signification, to carrie the readers aw· from the proper signification of it.
We denie not that the kyngdome of Christe is in this worlde, neyther denie wée that Christian kinges oughte to submitte them selues vnto it.
But we denie that thys kingdome stretcheth to the worldly gouernment and possession of kingdomes or Realmes, to the deposing of Kings, and translating the states of Polycies, whiche is the proper question now in hande.
And to shewe that this sentence of Christe, without all shifting or shuffling, is simply and playnely thus to be vnderstoode: will desire none other (besides S. Augustine whome you cite, and the auncient Fathers) than euen the Papists own iudgements and interpretations on this sentence, My kingdome is not of this worlde, whiche the Glosse expoundeth thus: Quasi decepti estis. &c.
As though he should say, ye are deceiued, for hinder not your gouernment in the worlde.
He seeketh not the temporall gouernment of this worlde. &c.
My kingdome is not from hence, that is to say, so farre as appertaineth to gette these temporall things.
But agaynst this seemeth that which is sayd in the Psalme.
God is the King of all the earth: but he is very God, as he is very man, therefore his kingdome is of this worlde.
VVe must say, that according to the veritie of his diuinitie, all thinges are subiect vnto Christe, notwithstanding so farre as appertayneth to his humanitie, he came not in his first comming to gouerne temporally, but rather to serue suffer.
And so it appeareth, that he sufficiently excludeth that, that was laide to his charge, of vsurping the kingdome of Iewry, bicause there was no question of him, but in that that he was man, and for the present state that he was in, whiche appertayned to his first comming.
Ferus expounding this saying, My kingdome is not of this worlde.
Quasi diceret. &c· As though (sayth he) he shoulde say, graunt (O Pilate) and acknowledge my selfe to be a King, this is euen that that haue done, this is that crime that is laide vnto me.
Howbeit vnderstand this thing aright, am in deede a king, but so, that neither vsurpe not diminish the power of thy Keysar, nor expell any of the Kings or Princes fro~ their power or dominio~s.
And that thou mayst vnderstande the matter it selfe, am not a worldly king, but an heauenly, in whose handes are the hartes of all Kings, although it seeme not so to thee.
My kingdome, that is, my principalitie or administration: or, my kingdome, that is my lawes and rightes: or, my kingdome, that is, my ministers and subiects: is not of this worlde, that is, not of man but of God.
(saith he) am of him made King ouer his holy mount.
To conclude, it is not of this worlde, that is, it is not temporall but eternall, for the world and the lust therof doth passe away.
Besides this, it is not of this world, bycause it is not corporall, but spirituall, and is administred after another sorte, than is a worldly kingdome.
For this is administred with a materiall sword, but my kingdome hath no neede of this sword, for the sword therof is the word of God.
The kingdome of the worlde hath Cities, Towers, Townes, Villages, Armies, Armor: my kingdome requireth onely the harts of men.
The world ruleth the goods and the bodyes, but rule the hartes and the consciences.
The world ruleth with a carnall power, but it yeeldeth to the spirituall: but rule spiritually against sinne, death and hell.
After the same maner almost doth Zacharias speake of the kingdome of Christe: Beholde thy King commeth vnto thee meeke and poore. &c. Howbeit we must marke that he saith not my kingdome is not in this world.
For Christ also is the Lorde of the world, for all things were made by him, all power is giuen to him in heauen and earth, now if the kingdome of Christ be not of this world, then it followeth, that there is yet another worlde.
And therfore although thou seest not the promises of Christ fulfilled in this world, yet despaire not, for there is another world, in the which is fulfilled, whatsoeuer here is not fulfilled.
Againe, bicause the kingdome of Christ is not of this world, we are bidden to pray, let thy kingdome come.
In this first word therefore Christ deliuereth Pilate from all feare, moreouer by this example proueth himselfe, to wit, that he is cleare from desiring the Imperiall or kingly power.
If (saith he) my kingdom were of this world· would not lead vnarmed Disciples about with me, but armed, yea, would haue counsellours, souldiors, armies, &c. who in this my necessitie, should with swerd defende me as their Lord, yea offring themselues to death for me.
Or if coueted a worldly Kingdome, eyther the Angels should defend me from the violence of the Iewes: or rather would haue nede, neither of Angels, nor of men, for my right hand should be able to helpe me. &c.
Of these things therefore Christ concludeth, but nowe my kingdome is not from hence.
Out of which argument persuade thy selfe moste certainly, that my kingdom is not of this world.
VVhatsoeuer thou or thy Emperor hath, it shall for me remaine whole vnto you, desire none of your things, regarde not the glorye and riches of the worlde, that you esteeme for the greatest goods.
These things truely were spoken to Pilate, but they pertaine to vs.
For, if the kingdome of Christ be not from hence, what dost thou Christia~, seke for riches and honors of this world, if the kingdome of Christ be not of this world? Christians therfore ought to haue tribulatio~ in this world while in Christ they haue the peace of conscience, maruell not therfore fro~ whence so many troubles happen to the godly in the world.
And with this word the godly man ought to comfort himselfe in aduersitie, and say, my kingdome is not from hence.
Besides this, if the kingdome of Christe be not from hence, then erre they that set the kingdome of Christe in outwarde things and elementes of the world· &c.
Thus doth your owne frier Ferus expound this sentence, that the kingdome of Christ is not in such power royaltie as worldly kingdomes are, nor diminisheth, deposeth, nor taketh away from kings their kingdomes.
And thus doth Ludolphus gather out of Chrisostome, and other auncient fathers.
He neither had souldiers nor Princes, nor horses, nor burden of mules· nor anye suche thing about him.
But he led this lyfe humble and poore, carying aboute with him.
Accordyng to his diuinitie all things were subiect to Christ, howbeit as touching his humanitie, in his first comming he came not to rule temporally, to raigne, but rather to serue and suffer.
VVherevpon he denieth not that he is a King, but rather graunteth it.
Bicause according to the truth, he was the King of King, but yet to take awaye occasion of escaping.
he tempereth his aunswere saying, that he seeketh not the temporall dominion of this worlde, bycause his Kingdome is not of this world, so farre as toucheth the seeking and hauing these temporal things, and therfore his kingdome was neither against the Iewes nor the Romaines, nor hindred their authoritie, bycause they only regarded an earthly Kingdome, that is, of this worlde.
As thoughe he saide to them, ye are deceyued, hinder not your Empyre in this world, least vainly ye should feare and rage, but come ye to the heauenly kingdome by beleuing, that is not of this worlde, to the which by preaching inuite you.
Christe saide, my Kingdome is not of this world, but yet notwithstanding many Prelates, which are his vicars, seme in their doyng to say the contrarie, in pompes making themselues equall to Princes, or rather exceeding them.
Thus saith agayne your Monke Ludolphus, and withall hitteth your Pope for his more than worldly kingdome.
For whereto else tendeth all this drift, but that the Pope ruling all Christian Kingdomes (pretending a spirituall Kingdome of Christ) might get a carnall kingdome to himselfe? As for Saint Augustine who (you saye) marked, that Christe saide not· my Kingdome is not here, but it is not fro~ hence: if you Maister Stapleton also had marked this in Saint Augustines exposition on thys sentence: Audite Iudei. &c. Heare ye Iewe, and Gentiles, heare thou Circumcised, heare thou vncircumcised, heare ye earthly kingdomes, hinder not your rule in this world: you might haue marked with all, that althoughe his kingdome be here in this worlde: yet is it not onely not of the world· but also not a worldly kingdome nor hindreth their gouernment, which it shuld do, if it might depose and alter them.
Thus we sée S. Augustines minde was not, that the kingdome of Christe dispossesseth Kings or any estates of men of their possessions and temporall goods, wherto M. Saunders applieth him: and also that by S. Augustines, and by his owne Friers Iudgementes, this sentence is aptly obiected of vs, against that kingdome that the Pope claimeth vsurpeth, in the name of the Kingdome of Christ.
Neither can all M. Saunders elusions shift off the force of our obiection.
Neither doth this auaile, that he saith, by the world is ment darknesse, sinne and the reprobate.
True it is, the worlde many times signifieth all these things.
But what helpeth this, when euen the Popish kingdome (as an euident token of reprobation not onely committeth, but maintaineth most abhominable sinnes, and the darknesse of ignorance is their chiefest couer.
Howbeit the pride and tyrannie of the Popes earthly kingdome, was so apparant: that euen themselues crie out vpon it.
And although Christe be borne of the Virgin beyonde the course of nature, yet notwithstanding he is both verie man, was verily borne, and by nature, he ought to be the King and Prince of all, who in things of that kinde, is the first, and onely: like their sentence very well, who teach that Christ, in that he is man, is the true King and Monarch of all mankinde, although his kingdome be not such an one, that he euer mingled himselfe in earthly things, except whereas they might be profitable to a spirituall ende.
As you like verie well of these mens sentence, so you haue heard the iudgement of your owne side to the contrarie, that Christ, as he is man, by his first comming, toke no Monarchie nor Kingdome vpon him, but a spirituall kingdome belonging to his diuinitie.
Althoughe doe not mislike theyr sentence neither, that referre also the kingdome of Christe vnto his humanitie, so that they referre not (as you do) an humaine kingdome to it.
He is very man we graunt, althoughe you, in the doctrine of transubstantiation to confound the veritie of his manhoode, he was also verily borne, and is the only chiefe of al that are borne, and he was borne of the stem of vvorldly Kings also, and he was truely called euen by his parentage the King of the Ievves, but bycause his kingdome consisted not in that, he was not borne to be suche a King.
And this appeareth euen in these wordes following vnto Pilate, after he had denied his kingdome to be of this world: when Pilate replyed, Arte thou then a King? he answered, thou saist that am a King.
Ne tamen. &c. vvhiche notvvithstanding (saithe Ferus) least Pilate should be more offended vvith the name of a King: Christe proceedeth to declare his kingdome more plainely, as thoughe he shoulde say: Pilate, vnderstande thou this for troth, and cast out of thy mynde all suspition, of a vvorldly kingdome, or of tyrannie.
This is the case, vvill not at al denie my spiritual kingdome, vvhether it be before thee, or before Caesar.
Onely knovve thou this thing, that it is not my purpose to inuade any man vvith Armes, or after the manner of other Kings, to raigne pompously: but to erecte and establishe in earth, the Diuine truth.
To this purpose vvas born· and to this purpose came into the vvorlde, that might beare vvitnesse to the truth.
Therfore say came I, therfore was borne, not to fight with the svvorde, but that might teach and declare the truth, and the Gospell, vvhiche is the povver of God to saluation, to all that beleeue.
And as declare the Gospell, so rule by the Gospell in the heartes of the beleeuers, ouer sinne, death, and the Deuill and for sinne vvill giue righteousnesse, for death life, for the Crosse, ioye, for hell vvill giue heauen, these are feofments of my kingdome.
Of these things none can be pertaker, excepte he heare my voyce, and beleeue in his heart.
enrich not mine vvith ryches, vvith cities and other feofme~ts, but by my vvords communicate vnto them ioye, life, peace, and to conclude, heauen it selfe.
But what are these things against the Emperor of Rome? Thus againe we sée that Christe is not such a King, nor his kingdome suche, as you dreame of.
Whiche in the ende, your selfe, contrarie to your selfe confesse, that his kingdome is not suche an one, that he euer mingled himselfe in earthly things.
Then (Master Saunders) those thinges belonged not to his Kingly office, nor to his kingdome.
For in suche things euery King ought not onely to mingle, but chiefly to occupie himselfe.
But strait you haue an exception at hand: that he mingled not himself in earthly things, except whereas they might be profitable to a spirituall ende, and this your selfe before confessed, was the finall ende of all the ciuill power, and that all faythfull Kings, ought to directe all those thinges in their kingdomes, vnto spirituall endes, bicause they themselues are spirituall.
And so what letteth, but that Christe should haue raigned as a worldly King, and gouerned an earthly kingdome? But say you: This kingdome of Christ therfore both came from heauen, tendeth vnto heauen.
For both al povver is giue~ vnto· him, as he vvas man, and died and rose againe, that he shoulde rule ouer the lyuing and the deade, and that he should be set ouer the vvorkes of the handes of God, and that all things should be cast vnder his feete, sheepe and Oxen, and moreouer, the beastes of the fielde: And also Saint Cyrill saith, that euen the wicked in the laste daye shall arise to their punishement for Christe, vvho rose firste, and contained, as man, al men in him self.
Sith therefore earthly Kings administer those things that pertain to sheepe and Oxen and beasts of the fielde: although they remaine Ehnikes and Infidels, yet are they truely vnder Christe the King, as the most vvorthy man· that hath receiued the principalitie ouer all thinges of this vvorlde, not from the earth, but from heauen, and for the same, shall giue an accou~t to him, of their common vveale euil ordered, bycause they referred not their kingdomes to a spirituall ende, that is, to the glorie of one God.
But Christ so far as appertineth to his humaine atu~re, being lesse than Angels, seemeth to me to haue receiued that kingdome (that Adam first should haue administred among all creatures, to the glorie of one God, if he had not falne from grace) and to haue renued it in himselfe, and to haue directed it to a spiritual end, that vvhen all things should be subiect to the Sonne of man, then should the Sonne also be subiecte vnto him, that hath subdued all thinges to him, that God might be all in all.
Sith therefore Christ by his humaine nature is the King of all, he truely directeth al things to a spiritual end, that is, to the glorie of God, for God deserueh glorie, yea, euen in those that are damned, bothe for his povver and for his iustice.
The effecte hereof is this, that God hath giuen to the humain nature of Christ, as to the principal of al his creatures, al povver iudgement, to direct them to a spiritual end, that is to his glorie.
But what is this to the purpose that Christes kingdome is after the fashion of a vvorldly kingdome? he gouerneth all creatures, we graunt, with his power and prouidence, yea, the sheepe, Oxen, and cattail that he speaketh on.
But dothe the kingdome of Christe consiste in these things? Numquid Deo cura de bobus? hath God (saith Sainte Paule) care of Oxen, in ye co~sideration of his heauenly kingdome? He telleth vs, howe all Kings shall answere (for the busing of their kingdomes) vnto Christ at the day of dome, bycause they referre them not to a spirituall ende: But he telleth not howe muche more the Pope shall aunswere for surping kingdomes, and abusing the spirituall kingdome of Christe to vvorldly endes.
But shall this iudgemente of Christ, be in a vvorldly co~sistorie? He telleth vs, how he thinketh that Christe receiued that kingdome that Adam should haue had, had he not falne.
But thinketh he that Christe should haue ruled in an earthly Paradise, or yt Christ came to restore vs to no better kingdome, than Adam was in before he sinned? He telleth vs, Al things shal be made subiect to Christe, and Christe to God, and God shall be all in all.
But thinketh he this kingdome shall be in this worlde and militant Church, while the euimies striue and are not yet al subdued? he telleth vs the glorie and iustice of Christ shineth in the condemnation of them that are damned.
But dothe he thinke, this is a vvorldly glorie, and humaine iustice? it is true, that the glorie and iustice of Christe shal shine ouer the~.
And so shal it in the righteouse condemnation of the Popish Church, that séeketh such a vvorldly kingdome, and calleth it the spiritual kingdome of Christe to cloake their pryde withall.
But what can Master Saunders conclude hereon, for Byshops to possesse kingdoms, to rule Kings, to sette vp, or to depose them? Neither say these thinges (saithe he) to shevve herevpon that povver is ouer the vniuersal vvorld giuen to the Bishops of the Chnrch, as though they in all things are the Ministers and Vicars of Christe, in that he is man: for they haue not receiued the vvhole povver of Christe to administer it, but that part that properly belongeth to beleeuers.
For it vvas sayde vnto the first Pastor, feede not all men, but my sheepe, and to thee giue the keyes, not of all the vvorlde, but of the kingdome of heauen.
Sithe therefore Christe hath receiued a certaine celestiall kingdome, vvhich kingdome vseth also earthly things vnto the glorie of God, and sith out of the things of the vvorld, he hath chosen a certaine societie of men, vvhiche in a certain especial sort, vvorshippeth God in faith and loue: in this onely seconde kynde of things, Christe hath ordeined Pastors to be his Vicars.
You say, that ye say not these things, to shevve that herevpon, povver is giuen to Byshops ouer al the vniuersal world.
But what soeuer you say, your Pope saith contrarie, applying this saying of Christe to himselfe and his successors: all povver is giuen to me in heauen and in earth.
You say, that Byshops haue onely that povver, that properly belongeth to the beleeuers, bycause Christe sayde vnto the firste Pastor, feede, not all men, but my sheepe.
That Peter was the firste Pastor, is another question Master Saunders.
But that the the Apostles had not in charge to go and preach to those that were not beleeuers, yea, to all men, so farre as they could, besides the feeding of them that were beleeuers, and so were become alreadie the shéepe of the folde of Christe, is a manifest vntruth.
For the Apostles had this generall charge, goe ye into all the vvorlde, and preach the Gospell to euery creature.
So that they fedde (besides the faithfull) the Infidels dispersed through out the whole world, for those Christe also calleth his, bycause they shoulde be his shéepe, alias oues babeo. &c.
haue also other sheepe that are not of this folde, those must bring also. &c.
But whereto run you to this so euident falshood? forsooth to proue that the Byshops haue ful power ouer al the beleeuers, in a their earthly possessions, so might haue power to depose Kings, to occupie their king doms sease vpo~ al mens goods that are Christians, bycause they are their Pastors.
And to this purpose is it that you say, Christe hath receiued a certaine celestiall kingdome, vvhiche vseth also all earthly things vnto the glorie of God.
Whiche saying in this sense may well be graunted, the kingdome of Christe vseth all earthly thinges that it vseth, to the glorie of God: but this woulde be proued that the Kingdome of Christe vseth, by the administration of the spirituall ministers thereof, a vvorldly or earthly kingdome, which vse is so far from the glorie of God, that it is contrarie to his celestial kingdome.
Whiche consisteth (as you say) in feeding the sheepe of Christe, in the keyes of Gods worde, and in that especiall sort of vvorshipping God in faith and loue: and not in deposing kings, or gouerning of earthly kingdomes, wherin they can not be (as you terme them) Vicars or deputies of Christ sith Christ the King, neither tooke himselfe such vse of power vpo~ him, flatly forbad the same vnto his Ministers.
Therefore the vvhole kingdome of Christe came from heauen, that is, from the dignitie vvhich is giuen vnto his humaine nature, for the vnion of the Diuine nature.
Neither by any meanes the kingdome of him, drue his originall from the lavve of nations or the ciuile.
For hee refused to be created King, or to deuide the inheritance betwene the brethren, saying: vvho hath made me a Iudge or deuider ouer you? As though he shoulde say: neither the common vveale, neither the Emperor hath made me a Iudge, yet notwithstanding, these brethren thought of such a Iudge.
But in that part that Christe vvas appointed of God to be Iudge, by his incarnation, concerning that, he saide vnto those brethren: bevvare of all couetousnesse.
For he savv that they draue not their inheritance to a spirituall ende, that they might beare the heauenly iudgement of Christe.
This is a shamefull wresting of the Scripture, and inuerting of the manifest doings of our Sauiour.
Here are two other plaine examples of Christ, against Master Saunders, the one of his refusall to be a vvorldly King, the other to be a'vvorldly Iudge.
The former he shifteth off in this sort, Christ would not receiue an earthly kingdom into his hands not bycause he would none of it, but bycause he woulde not take it of their gifte, least it shoulde séeme to come of them.
For his kingdome is of heauen, and notin the originall, from the lavv of nations, or of the ciuile.
As though our disputatio~ were so much of the originall, as of the vse and hauing of it: as though Christe respected nothing but the originall, or as though, if he woulde haue had such a kingdome, he could not haue had it if they had not giuen it him: or as thoughe, euen the first original of earthly kingdomes, came not from God also.
But to confute you with your owne mouthes, will cite once againe Frier Ferus againste you, that alledgeth not onely this cause of the originall, but many other causes directly to this purpose.
Christe fled (saithe he) bycause he receiued not a kingdome of men, but gaue a kingdome vnto men.
He fled, bycause his kingdome is not of this vvorld, it is not carnall, it consisteth not in externall riches, povver, pompe. &c. Yea, he rather came, that he might teach to contemne these things.
But his kingdom is a kingdome of truth, iustice, peace, and eternall life.
For although he gouerne in all the vvorlde, yet hee gouerneth not after the manner of the vvorlde, nor he affecteth suche a kingdome.
He sedde therefore, not bycause he vvoulde not raigne ouer the faithfull, but bycause he deferreth the expresse tokens of reigning for the time to come.
Hee sledde, bycause hee came to minister, not that it shoulde be ministred vnto hym.
Hee fledde, for hee came not to kill Kings, but to preach to Kings the knovvledge of raigning iustly, not to presse the kingdomes of the world vvith tributes and taxes, but that vvhich Kings so vvell as the people vvanted, to giue them giftes of life eternall, out of the treasure of the kingdome of heauen, going about to vanquishe in vvarre, a farre other manner of ennimie, than Tiberius Caesar, and to take an other manner of beaste than Rome, vvhyche at that tyme. vvas Ladie of the Ievves.
Besides this hee fledde, that he vvoulde not giue to the people an occasion of sedition against Caesar, and so vvithall an occasion of sinne and perdition.
For hee that moueth sedition againste the povver (as héere in your writing you M. Sand· do, and your Pope doth in his Bulles against Christian Princes) sinneth and iustly perisheth for it.
VVhich Christe himselfe hath spoken: he that taketh the svvorde, shall perishe vvith the svvorde.
To conclude, he fled, least hee should giue the aduersaries occasion of sclaundering him.
For if they, yea, eue~ vvithout this, perfecuted him as a seditious person, how much more would they haue persecuted him, if he had accepted the kingdome offered of the people.
Thus euen til this day fleeth he fro~ those, that only seeke carnall things in him, bycause no parte of his spiritual giftes loketh on the~, he despiseth them that are occupied about vile bags· to vvit, being giuen to their belly filthinesse.
He only giueth himselfe to them that seeke spirituall things in him, that can say our co~uersation is in heauen.
Not without cause therfore Christ here fled being sought for vnto a kingdome, vvho being sought for vnto deathe, offered himselfe freely.
For first by this, he condemned our pryde, or coueteousnesse, or ambition, or deintinesse.
Secondly, he taught to contemne the glorie of the vvorlde, than the vvhiche nothing is more vaine, and not to feare the aduersitie of the vvorlde, than the vvhiche nothing is more shorte.
Thirdly, he taught heerein, that those things are but small, that in the worlde seeme to be mostegreat.
They thought they had offered Christe a great thing, but he despised it as a litle thing.
Whom he meaneth by this, vve: loke a litle before concerning the~ that offered the kingdome to Christ.
This fact (saith he) declareth what the flesh seeketh in Christ, euen his ovvn Cosins, that is to say, fleshly humaine things.
Christe is set forth before vs, that in him we should seeke the forgiuenesse of sinnes, righteousnesse, eternal life.
But the carnall man seeketh nothing in him but licence, carnall libertie, and the filling of the paunche.
For hee that is of the earth, speaketh and thinketh of earthly thinges, yea, suche is the nature of the fleshe, that it abuseth all the giftes of God, and seeketh farre other things in them, than God woulde.
So the fleshely man in the creatures that are giuen to our vse, and to this that God might be knowne and feared, seeketh no other thing than pleasure.
And when by the~ he ought to be caried vnto the creator, he sticketh in the~, and worshippeth the~, So, in the lawe which was giuen of God, for the knowledge of sinne, the carnall Iewes sought righteoushesse (euen as the Papistes doe) and so nowe also, all those carnall men, that in the power of the sworde, seeke not that that God wil, but only ambition, pryde, &c. yea, and that in these thinges that appertaine to the spirituall gouernement, those carnall Pastors seeke onely honor, ryches, idlenesse, delightes: when as Christ ordeined them to be teachers, guides, Apostles. &c.
For no other cause, than for the edifying of his bodie.
Thus saith Frier Ferus againste his owne fleshely spiritualtie séeking in Christes spirituall kingdome a worldly kingdome, which for these causes abouesaide, and not onely for the originall, (that Maister Saunders here onely mentioneth) he refused to be made a King.
The like shift Maister Saunders vseth to the other place Luc.
of Christs refusall to be a iudge, betwene the brethre~ for the diuision of their inheritance, saying who made me a iudge, or deuider, ouer you? as though he shoulde say, neither the common weale hath made me a iudge, neither the Emperor hath made me a iudge.
As thoughe Christ refused to be their iudge, not for that he would not be such a iudge, ut for that he was not made such a iudge by humaine authoritie.
For of such a iudge (saith he) these brethren thought, whether they thought him to be such a iudge or no, not apparant, Maister Saunders, and if we may go by coniectures probabilities, it rather séemeth the contrarie.
For neicher could they sée any such tokens in him, to haue bin authorised from those that were hen the Magistrats, his words going before do argue they could not conueniently so thinke of him, both ratling vp the Phariseis that had the humaine authoritie: bidding his Disciples not to mistrust what to answere when they shoulde come before the powers Magistrates, which these brethren hearing, might easily conceiue yt Christ himselfe was no such earthly Magistrate.
But to the causes wherfore Christ refused it, that as before) euen of the Papists mouthes themselues.
Hofmeister one of your sloutest champions, hath these words: Truely those things that haue bin spoke~ and heard from the beginning of this Gospel, do ynough declare the kingdom of Christ not to be of this world, neither that he would raigne temporally in the world, sith he taketh not souldiors that ca~ oppugne others, but fisherme~ readier to suffer tha~ to strike.
And so in this place, with most manifest wordes Christ declareth, that he came not for this purpose, to take vpon him the office of a Magistrate, but rather that he might raigne in our harts, so that it might be our hap to come to the eternal goods, whatsoeuer hapned of our tem porall goods.
Therfore when he was interrupted of a certaine Iewe, that he would helpe him in recouering his inheritance: he aunswered, Man, who hath made me a ludge or deuider ouer you? As though he shoulde say, hath not this worlde iudges, that may decide so base controuersies? it is not appointed vnto me, that this or that man shoulde waxe rich by inheritance, but that all men should come to the inheritance of life immortall.
But in these words Christ woulde betoken many things, to wit, that he which hath an Apostolicall office, ought not to be wrapped with prophane and silthie affaires.
For so the Apostle saith otherwhere, No ma~ going to warfare vnder God entangleth himselfe with worldly businesse.
And the Apostles say all at once, it is not meete fo~r vs to leaue the word of God, and attend on the tables.
Christ also by this reprouing woulde declare, that his doctrine taketh not away the Magistrates offices, but rather confirmeth the~.
VVhervpon he saith also else where render to Cesar, that that is Cesars.
And whe~ his Disciples striued for prehemine~ce, he said· the kings of the nations gouerne them, so forth.
VVhereby he declared, that neither he himself, nor his, ought (as they call the~) to be secular iudges: neither did he by this refusing, abolishe the order of the Magistrate, but much more (as we haue said) confirmed it.
Thus far your owne Doctor Hofmeister againste you, that the entent of Christe refusing to be a iudge herein, was chiefely against such vsurpation of worldly Magistracie, as the Pope and his Prelates do exercise.
But (say you) Christ in that he was appoynted of God to be iudge by his incarnation, concerning that parte, he saide vnto them, that they should beware of couetousnes, for he saw that they draue not as yet their inheritance to a spirituall ende, that they might beare the iudgement of Christ.
As who should say, if they had béen Christians he would then haue béen a temporall iudge ouer them, that is to say, if they had done their duetie, he woulde then haue broken his.
No M. Saund· that was not the cause why Christ refused to iudge y^ matter, but bicause he counted it no part of his office, neither was he appointed of God therto, but it belongeth to the Ciuill Magistrate.
As for suche iudgement, as vydding the brethren to beware of couetousnesse, was in dede appointed of God to Christ, of him to al his Ministers, to iudge of vices, in such sort, as by preaching to them their ties, to iudge of all estates, of all things also.
Neither is all on of Ciuil controuersis, or iudging temporal matters ply debarred from the spiritual Minister, nor the vse of temporall things.
But that the kingdome of Christ confises in these things, or that the ministers of Christ be in such Ciill iudgements aboue Kings, or may iudge· Kings, giue their inheritance from them, or if they haue any authoritie too in Ciuil matters, that it is properly by their office, or belo~ging properly to Christes kingdome and that they haue it not fro~ the Prince· is cleane confuted by this example.
Neither can all these shiftes defeate it, much lesse that that followeth in M. Saunders, saying.
Declaring therefore to what ende all things that are in the worlde ought to be rerred: seke (saith he) the kingdome of God, al these things shal be cast vnto you.
VVhere he denyeth not that euen worlldy things pertaine to the kingdome of God: but he would not haue those sought, for themselues, but onely for the kingdome of God.
But the kingdome that beleueth in Christ, it hath left in that parte, to be of the worlde, in which part Christ denied his kingdome to be of this worlde.
VVhatsoeuer (saith S. Augustine) is from henceforth regenerate in Christ, is made a kingdome, not now of the world.
That all things oughte to be referred to the kingdome of God, we graunt, but yt the kingdome of God consiste in all things we denie.
Meate drinke ought to be referred to the kingdom of God, whether ye eate or drink (saith S. Paule) whatsoeuer ye do· do it all to the praise glory of God, but the kingdome of God is not meate and drinke.
Yo say, worldly things pertaine to the Kingdome of God.
Which although it is much better said, than that the kingdome shoulde appertaine to worldly things, as the Papists here would drine it, to the state of a worldly kingdome: yet is it but an improper saying, that worldly things belong to the kingdome of God.
In dede the faithfull (which are the kingdome of God haue them, and they belong vnto them, and they are necessarie and conuenient for them, as meate, drinke, cloath, house, fire, water, proprietie and possession of temporall worldly goods, to each faithfull man in his degree, and also to the ministers of the Church of Christ, that to haue these worldly things belonging to them (according as their giftes and trauailes require) with dubble honor, yet do they not belong vnto them, nor to any of the faithfull, as he is a member of this kingdome but as he is a man and subiect to infirmities, and these giftes of God are made for his vse, so well the ministers as anye others.
But yet there is a difference in the hauing of these worldly things, and the being a Prince in the hauing of the~: for such Princely hauing of them, is expresly forbidden vnto the spirituall minister of Christe, and permitted onely vnto the Ciuill Magistrate.
The Pope and his Prelates will not onely haue them, but they will be kings, and excell kings, in the hauing of them, and will haue them in the name of the Church, and of the kingdome of Christe, and not as from the Prince, to whose authoritie properly, although not to whose proprietie, they belong: for the minister may haue the proprietie of those worldly things so well as another, and perhaps better than many another, more abundance of them too, with which he may do more goodsundry wayes, than diuers other in Gods Church.
But there is a difference betwene starke aring· and starke blind.
Ther are some cormorants that hunt for the spoie, and wold haue the ministers earthly things cleane taken from them, as though they were onely spirituall.
The Papistes on the other side, were not only contt to haue them, but they would (besides their to muche excesse of them) be exempted with priuileges from the Princes authoritie in the hauing of them, and the Pope did clayme not onely a kingdome of them, but that al kinges helde their kingdomes of him.
And this is the thing that we denie the Papistes.
For Christe hathe playne debarred it, and denied his kingdome to be a worldly kingdome.
Yea but (sayth M. Sanders) in that parte that a kingdome beleeueth in Christ, it hath left off to be of this world· We graunt you, M. Sanders, in respecte of the beleefe in Christe and the soule that beleeueth: but yet hathe it not left off to be of this world, in respect of the body, in respect of the ciuill gouernment, in respect of hauing and vsing orderly Gods creatures, in respecte of maynteining our liues, our goodes, our families our countreys: all which earthly thinges, the kingdome of God, that is, the faythfull, may enioy, and haue farre better vse of them than any other, referring them to spirituall endes, howbeit, euery man in his degrée suche earthly thinges as are competent to his estate, and are not debarred from his vse, as the hauing of an earthly kingdome, is from the spirituall Minister.
As for the sentence of S. Augustine, is not to this purpose, but wrested therto, for he speaketh not there of a kingdome, as we héere do, that is to say, of a ciuill power gouerning a Realme, or of a Realme and Polycie gouerned by a King, as thoughe bicause it receiued the fayth Christ, it were not of the worlde, that is, it were not gouerned after a worldly maner.
In whiche sense (as we haue shewed) Christe denied his kingdome to be of the worlde.
For although it be become a faythfull kingdome· yet maynteyneth it still the former state, which is no disslued by the kingdome of Christ, but rather bettered and confirmed.
His words are these: Therefore they were of the world, when they were not of his kingdome, but pertayned to the prince of the worlde, That therfore is of the worlde, whatsoeuer is in deede created of the true God, but is borne of the corrupted and damned stocke of Adam.
But that which is regenerate in Christe, is made a kingdome now not of the worlde, for so God hathe pulled vs out of the power of darknesse, and translated vs into the kingdome of the sonne of his brightnesse.
By whiche sentence it appeareth, he speaketh not of the worlde, in the sense of the mighte and glorie thereof, but in the sense of the power of sinne and Sathan: neyther of a kingdome, in the sense of a Polycie gouerned by a king, but in the sense of the spirituall giftes of Christ.
In whiche sense, euery faythfull man, woman, and childe, is not onely a member of his kingdome, but is a king.
Howbeit he is not a king, in that sense that Christ denied his kingdome to be of the worlde, that is, to be a Magistrate, and gouernour of Gods people: which estate is onely graunted vn Princes, and as flatly ebarred from any ecclesiasticall person, as from any other priuate man.
Sihe therefore we say not, that other kingdomes oughte to be vnder the Ministers of the Church of Christ, than those that already beleeue in Christe, or at any time haue beleeued: truely this is most foolishly obiected to vs, that Bishops haue no power ouer Christian kings and their kingdomes, bicause it is written, the kingdome of Christ (which is committed to his Ministers, for the parte whereby he worketh heere) is not of this world.
For we seeke it not of those kingdomes that are of this worlde, but of those, which althoughe they be in this worlde, yet by fayth in Christe they haue lefte to be of this worlde.
M. Sand· still wrestes of purpose this worde, the worlde, to sinne, and to the state of the vnfaythful.
As though Christ onely ment, My kingdome is not a kingdome of sinne, and such as are the kingdomes of those Princes, ouer whome the Prince of darknesse raygnes.
Whereas the wordes of Christe are playne, that his kingdome is not suche a kingdome, as ruleth in worldly glorie, whether it were of the faithfull kinges, or the vnfaythfull.
For the Iewes that would haue made him a king, dyd not doubte of this, that he would become a tyrant, or an vnfaythfull Prince, they hoped he would be a better Prince vnto them· than he was that then oppressed them: they trusted he woulde gouerne them, as Dauid, Salomon, and other godly princes had done: they reckoned that their Messias shoulde rule in all worldly glorie, as a moste mightie king.
But this opinion Christe denieth, in his fléeing from their offer.
And so he sayde to Pilate, If my kingdome were of this worlde, my ministers would fighte for me, that is, could, not by tyrannie, but by worldly and lawfull power and force maynteine my kingdome.
Neyther did his Disciples when they desired suche preheminence in his kingdome, thinke his kingdome was a kingdome of sinne, or a rule of vnfaithfulnesse: but thought of a very worldly gouernment, shining in all might and glory, which they tooke to be good and lawfull, and him to be most worthy of it.
And this is that that Christ reproueth in them, affirming that neither he nor they shoulde raigne in suche sorte as worldly Princes do, whether they were faithfull or vnfaithfull Princes.
For they obediently submit their earthly kingdomes to his spirituall kingdome, yea and to the ministers of his kingdome too, in thinges belonging to the ministerie of his spirituall kingdome.
But that the Ministers of the spirituall kingdome of Christ, haue suche power ouer any Christian Prince that beléeueth in Christ, that they may take his estate from him, that they the~ selues may rule in his estate, that they may make him holde his estate of them, that they oughte not to be subiect to his estate: this is the thing that M. San. laboreth in, and would bring all kings and their kingdomes vnto, that either haue the faithe of Christe already, or at any tyme haue had it, as Ierusalem, Syria, Gréece, Asia, Egypte, Africa, and diuers other countreys, so well vnder the Turke and Saracens, as all Christian kingdomes in the worlde, to be subiecte to the Popes authoritie, to receyue or forsake their kingdomes at his pleasure.
But this and suche other worldly glory of rulg kingdomes is flatly debarred by Christes saying: My kingdome is not of this worlde: neither all the wisdome of the worlde can conteruayle this sentence, how foolishly soeuer we seeme to M. Sanders to obiect it.
But this is his olde song, all are rooles and doltes with him, that obiecte any thing agaynst the Popes worldly wyse Dominion.
But this foolishnesse we néede not be ashamed of, that is the decrée of Christ, who is the fathers wisedome.
If therefore wee see suche a kingdome, as is dedicated to Christe, thus gouerned, that the King by abuse of the sworde whiche he carrieth, carrie away the Christian Citizens into moste greeuous sinnes, yea into schismes and heresie, if he say Christe is but a creature, if euery where he permitte diuorces, if he affirme vsuries to be lawfull, shall it be a wicked deede, first after one or two admonitions, to remoue this King from the felowship of the faythfull: and then if he yet amende not him selfe, by the helpe of other Princes, to expel him vtterly from the gouernment of his kingdome? If a Christian King were suche an other wicked King, as héere you imagine: you aske if it were a wicked deede thus to order him? answere you, it were a wicked deede.
For and he were ten times more wicked, that excuseth not the Bishops treason, to incite other to expell him.
None of the auncient godly Bishops did euer attempt that treheris agaynst such wicked Princes, were they Arians, Tyrants, or whatsoeuer they were, til the later Popes did set abroche this trayterous practise.
For, a Bishop beeing but a subiect, althoughe he is not bounde to obey the Princes vices, yea he is bounde bothe to disobey the vices, and to reproue the Prince for them, and to terrifie him with the threates of Gods wrathe, althoughe it coste him his life for his labor: yet is he not bounde to rebell, or cause other to rebell, or to practise conspiracies with other agaynst his Prince, wherby effusion of Christian bloud ensueth.
Yea he is bounde to the contrarie, to obey his ciuill gouernment, and not he to abuse his estate also, bicause the Prince abuseth his estate, but to vse all lawfull meanes he can to reforme him, committing the rest to God, who placed him, and whom he representeth in his calling, thoughe he swarue from him in his ruling.
As for the Bishops haue no suche calling to depose him, nor any suche ruling as worldly Princes, good or ill do exercise.
And therfore if they take this vsurpation vpon them, thoughe they oughte not to depose Princes, yet ought Princes to depose them, especially béeing infected with those vices, that M. San. suniseth are in these Princes.
Haue not Popes made schismes, when two or thrée, or foure at once striued for the Papacie? haue not Popes maynteined, Christ is a creature· as Liberius that was an Arian? and a sinfull creature, yea alyer, as Leo the tenthe obiected to Bembus, Quidmibi narras de Christo fabulas? VVhat tellest thou me the fables of Christ? Hath not the Pope not onely permitted diuorces for many other causes than God permitteth, but also by force and agaynst the consent of bothe the parties seuered those that God hathe ioyned, and ioyned those that God hath forbidden to be ioyned? Dothe not the Pope maynteine the greatest vsuries that be, to wit, the Iewes to pill and poll the Christians, and al for his own lucre, besides his most filthy and vnlawfull gayne by fornication? Doth not the Pope by the abuse of the sword keyes that he saith he carrieth, carrie away the Christian citizens into most greeuous sinnes, yea, and say he may carrie away with him at the world to the diuel, no ma~ must be so hardie as to say, sir, why do you thus? Shal it now be a wicked deede, to remoue the Pope from the felowship of the faithful, after one or two admonitions, then if he amend not him selfe, that all Christian Princes helpe to expell him vtterly fro~ the vsurpation of this his worldly kingdome.
But M. Sa. not séeing these vices in his holy father, surmising the worst in Princes, supposeth we will answere his obiection thus: But one wil say, no power is giue~ vnto the Church of punishing or of remouing the kings fro~ their office, therfore if the kings wil not of their own accord be ame~ded, they are altogither to be born withal, neither ca~ any other thing be lawfully attempted agaynst them.
Who they be that preach this, know not, think it but your slaunder.
And yet whosoeso preacheth this, preacheth farre better than you do, whose sermon is all of treason rebellion.
As for vs we preache this, that the preacher or spirituall pastor may in suche extremities, vse a spirituall punishment, of denouncing the sentence of Gods wrath agaynst him.
But to punishe him with bodily punishment, or with expelling him from his kingdome, is no more belonging to the Bishop, than to put him to death.
The state of some kingdomes are such, grau~t that the Princes regiment is but conditional, and he so wel bounde to the electors of him, other péeres or estates in his Signiorie, as they to him, and either parties sworne in his Coronation, not onely to obserue those conditions, but to persecute or remoue the violater of them.
In suche cases, what those Electors, Péeres, Estates may do, howe they may, or may not do it, is an other matter.
But yt eue~ in these estates, the Bishops ca~ do it, do it in that they are Bishops: this we denie (M. Sand) and as yet you haue not proued it.
But doubte not, but that euery necessarie and profitable power is giuen to the Pastor ouer his sheepe, whether they be lambes, or lambes dammes, or rammes, and that to this purpose, that he shoulde strengthen that, that is weake: that he should heale that, that is sicke: that he shoulde binde vp that, that is broken: that he should bring againe that, that is caste away: that he should seeke that, that is loste, so that he rule not with austeritie and power.
You doubt not (M. Sand.) but doubt of this, that euery necessarie and profitable power is giuen to the Pastor ouer his sheepe.
But the Prince is a pastor, and the people are his sheepe.
And yet by your owne confession, the ecclesiasticall power is not giuen to the Prince.
Had you marked this, you mighte haue doubted, that euery necessarie and profitable power, is giuen to the pastor ouer his sheepe.
Agayne, the power of the sworde, and putting to death malefactors, is a necessarie and profitable power.
But the Bishop is a pastor, and the people are his sheepe.
And yet by your own confession, the power of the sworde, and putting to death, is not giuen to the Bishop.
Had you séene this also, you might haue doubted, that euery necessarie and profitable power, is giuen to the Pastor ouer his sheepe.
This lacke of doubting, made you to rashe of déeming, and to pronounce your sentence ouer general.
And as you sée in these two cases a flatte exception, that you wil gladly reuoke: so we muste driue you to graunte the other powers also pertayning to a King, whiche notwithstanding they are necessarie and profitable, are yet not giuen vnto a Bishop, although he be a Pastor.
pray you remember, Vos autem non sic, if it will not make you sicke to remember it.
The duties of good pastors that you cite out of Ezech.
But the Popish pastors are as farre fro~ all these points, much farther, than the Iewishe pastors were, of whome the Lorde co~playneth, saying: VVo be to the pastors of Israel, that feed the~selues: are not he sheepe fed of the shepherds? ye did eate the milk, were clad with the wol· that that was fat, ye killed: but my flock ye fed not· that that was weak, ye stre~gthned not: that that was sick, ye healed not: that that was broke~, ye bou~d not vp: that that was cast away, ye brought not in, that that was lost ye sought not, but ye ruled them with bitternesse, with power.
how this directly toucheth the Pope, and his Prelates, euen the popish enterlined Glosse doth testifie.
This properly is spoken of the pride of Bishops, which shame with their works the dignitie of their name, for humilitie, taking pride: who thinke they haue gotten heauen, and not a burthen.
Whose loytring idlenesse, whose vaine glorious pride, whose bitter tyrannie, more than kingly power was so intollerable, that it was maruell that euer you durst for shame recite this place.
But you thought it serued to your purpose, that you might vnder the name of sheepe punishe driue out Princes at your pleasures.
But this place giueth not Pastors power to weaken them that be strong, to make them sicke that be hole, to breake that that is bound vp, to caste out that that is brought in, to leese that that was sought for, to kil deuour both the fat the leane, both the Prince the people, to rule with biternesse with power: al which by your popes practise is don, by your exposition is defended.
For is not that to rule with bitternesse, if ye expel your Princes fro~ their kingdomes? can ye be any bitterer to them? what earthly power can ye clayme higher, than to seaze vpo~ rule their kingdomes, or to haue the~ rule them after your rules, whom you will appoynt, to olde them in chiefe fro~ you.
This place of Ezechiell giueth you not suche power, but condemneth in Pastors the vsurpation of it.
But what will not impudencie wrest to serue his turne.
Moreouer, to the minde and to reason, power is giuen ouer all the members of the body, insomuche that it biddeth that rotten member to be ut from the body, of the which it may be feared, least it should infect the other members.
But the pastors in the Church are as the minde is in the body of man, as S. Gregorie Nissene hath noted.
answere· First, this is but a similitude, and therefore coninceth nothing, howe ofte soeuer you alleage it.
We graunt that the Pastors are, as it were, the mynde of the Churche, in the reasoning and discussing the fayth of Christ, the word of God, the sacraments and mysteries of Christes Church.
But againe, in the maintenance and setting forth, in the ouersight and publike direction, in the punishement and correction of the trespasses, the Prince is the minde, the reason, and the head also, and a pastor in gods Church too.
But be it the Prince be not the minde and reason, whose place is in the head.
Were the King but as the hart, or as the will whose place is in the harte, yet as the minde dothe but eyther deuise by inuention, or discerne by iudgement, or remember by memorie, and not assent or dissent, like or mislike, choose or refuse, for that belongeth to the will: so the spirituall pastor may deuise holsome remedies, or remember the Prince of them, or discerne in controuersies betwéen this and that, which we denie not.
But the refusall or receiuing, the liking or misliking, the bidding or forbidding, that lyes in the facultie of the Prince.
Not that the Prince hath facultie to will euery thing, no more than the head may deuise euery thing, for both ought to will and deuise onely good things· but that the authoritie to put them in executio~, and willing the members to do them, as it procéedes principally next to God, from y^ wil: so the setting forth of godly Religio~, taught by the persuasio~ of the pastor as the reason in the head, procéedes principally next to God from the Prince, as the will in the hart.
But nowe as M. Saunders hath for stalled the head for the Priest, so if he will not relent the harte to the Prince: yet trust he will be thus good vnto him, to compare him at the least to some principall member in the body, as to ye lightes, the lunges, the lyuer. &c.
If nowe the lightes, the lunges, or the liuer, be infected, by whose infection diuerse others parts of the body would become also infected, will the head therefore, will the minde or reason byd cut them off, and hure the~ out of the bodie, least they infect the other members? were it not an vnreasonable reason that would reason thus, to haue those rotten me~bers cut off fro~ the body, of which remaining it may be feared least they should infect the other members, when the cutting them awaye straight killeth all the members, both head and hart and all? and thus you sée M. Saunders if we shal reason by similitudes, howe they make more for vs, than for you.
But similitudes may delight or lighten a matter, they are not of force to vrge it.
Besides this S. Paule by name doth teach, that power is giuen to the Churche ouer the goods ouer the bodily things of the faithfull.
For he persuadeth the Corinthians, that if they will nedes go to law, they should go to lawe before Christians, and not before Ethnikes.
And bicause it mought be said, there were no publike Magistrates or iudges ordayned among the Christians: he warneth the faithfull that they should appoynt iudges among themselues: and if perhaps there were not wisemen in that kind (which notwithstanding was not likely) yet at the least they should rather appoint contemptible persons, tha~ to go to law before the infidels.
The Church hath power ouer the goods and bodyly things of the faithfull: But the Pastors are the Church: Ergo, the pastors haue power ouer the goods and bodily things of the faithfull.
To the Maior answere, the Churche hath power, but a limited power.
Such power as confoundeth not or taketh away the goods or bodily things of any of the faithfull, which are members of the Church.
Such power as is competent to euery member of the Church, to possesse, to vse, and dispose his owne goods and bodily things, according to his priuate or publike calling.
To the Minor, denie it: the pastors are not the Churche, but members of the Church, and haue power onely ouer such goods and bodily things as belong to the~.
And yet in that power that they haue of the proprietie of their own goods, they may so little spoyle the Prince of his goods or bodily things, that they holde them from the Prince, and haue by him the peaceable possession of them.
For all that power vnder God is from the Prince, to the~ to al other.
Neither the Bishops nor any in the Church, nor all the Church together, hath power to take the Princes goods or his bodyly things fro~ him.
But M. Sau~ders to enforce his argument, citeth the sayof S. Paule.
In that he would haue Christians, go to law (if they will nedes go to law) before Christians, and not before Ethnikes.
Why, M. Saunders are Christian Princes and faithfull Magistrates no better with you than Ethnikes? and are you Priestes onely Christians? for else howe can you apply this to the present purpose? that Priests should haue power ouer the goods of the faithfull: that the faithfull should run for decision of their co~trouersies to the Priests, not to the Princes? that the Bishops may iudge of the Princes goods aod kingdome, and giue it away to another: trow you this was the meaning of S, Paule? But you excuse the matter with this, that they had then no Christian Magistrates.
As though therfore he had bidden such lawe matters to be determined by their pastors.
this was neither the words nor the meaning of him.
For he knewe, the pastors had another power and inough to do therin, although they busied not the~selues in the law matters that fel out among the Christia~s.
Not that s. Paule thought they might haue no power of any bodily things, nor proprietie of temporall goods, or that he thought they mighte in no case be peacemakers in suche brabling matters: but that Saint Paule woulde haue the pleadyng and decision of suche things to be rather belonging ordinaryly, to some faithfull and honest manne, chosen among them selues, than to runne to heathen Iudges.
Which words among themselues, do as it were declare, that he ment such as was of their owne calling, and not their astor· Which is more euident in that he saith, is there no wise man among you? what, not one, that can iudge betwene brother and brother? so that he speaketh in generall, and not onely of the pastor.
Except ye will make the pastor contemptible· it argueth, he ment not this iudge should be the pastor.
So that this place, as it maketh nothing for the power of the Priests ouer the goods and bodily things of the faithfull, so it maketh much here in against them.
For if S. Paule in such matters of goods and bodily things, rather than they should not haue a Christian iudge, woulde haue them chose among themselues euen a contemptible person: how much more now when the Church hath faithfull iudges and Christian Princes, it ought in such controuersies, to run to them for Iustice, rather than to the Priests and Bishoppes, that are of another calling.
Moreouer, least any shoulde say, that the Churche of Christ hath nothing to do with the businesse of this worlde: he sayth expressely, do ye not know that the saintes shall iudge of thys world? and if the world shal be iudged by you, are ye vnworthy to iudge of small things? know ye not that we shall iudge the Angels, how much more worldly things.
Behold the Apostle reasoneth from the spirituall power to the temporall, on this wise: To whom that which is more, is lawfull, to him is lawfull that which is lesse: But we Christians shall iudge of the world, and we shall iudge the renegate Angels and the Deuils themselues, the which commeth by the spirituall power· wherby we be made the sonnes of God, and the coinheritors of Christ: much more therefore may we exercise secular iudgements.
VVherby it appeareth that secular things are both inferior spirituall, and are not estranged from the spirituall power, but may light vnder it, chiefely then, when the matter is in hand of punishing or iudging those men, that are the me~bers of the Church of Christ.
saye not (Master Saunders) that the Churche of Christ hath nothing to doe vvith the businesse of this world, this is but your sclaunder.
We say that the spirituall Ministers of the Churche of Christe, haue not so to do with such vvorldly businesse, that they maye turquise all the vvorlde, and alter the states of vvorldly kingdomes, and occupie them selues about vvorldly affaires, in such vvorldly dominion as you pretende they maye.
He speaketh there of vvorldly matters, and you applye it to all iudgementes, yea, to the iudging of a kingdome· But you replle, he saith the Saints shall iudge the worlde and the Angels, vvhiche are greater thinges than kingdomes, howe muche more then kingdomes, that are lesser things.
Trowe you) Master Saunders (he speaketh there, of such iudging the vvorlde, that they should iudge like chiefe Iusti of realmes and kingdomes, whether this or that Prince shall enioye them, or shall be dispossessed of them? No (M. Saunders) she speaketh of no suche thing.
The worlde shall be iudged in them, as Chrysostome well noteth: Iudicabunt non ipsi iudices. &c.
They shal iudge· not they themselues sitting in iudgeme~t, exacting an accou~t.
God forbid, but they shal co~demne the vvorld, the vvhich signifying he saith, and if in you. &c.
He saith not of you, but in you As who should say, the iust condemnation of these that are the vvorldlings, shall shine in the saluation of you that are the Saints.
This therefore proueth such worldly iudgeme~t as you pretend Secondly you abuse S. Paule, as though in speaking of the Saints, he spake onely of the spirituall Pastors, wheras he speaketh in generall of the whole congregation.
Are Saintes and Christians only Priestes with you? this is both manifest wresting of S. Paule, and shamelesse arrogancie in your selues.
But you say the Churche hath it, by the spirituall povver vvherby vve be made the sonnes of God, and coinheritors of Christe.
But doth this spirituall povver belong onely to Priestes? you say it appeareth hereby, vve maye exercise secular iudgementes, whome meane you by this vve, (Master Saunders) your selues that are the Priestes? But S. Paule speaketh of Christian people, and not of the Pastors only, yea, least of al of the Pastors.
Wherevpon saith Haimo out of Gregorie, on these wordes, choose him that is contemptible.
According to Gregorie, by contemptible persons vvee may vnderstande secular men, hauing the knovvledge of humaine lavves, and in their personages being honorable, who in comparison of them that vnderstand the diuine lawes, and pierce the mysteries of the holy Trinitie, are contemptible and simple, although they be faithful· And according to this sense vvee muste reade it affirmatiuely, bicause suche are to be appointed, vvhiche of the Canons are called, the Sonnes of the Church.
sprake it to your shame, bycause althoughe commaunde it not, you ought to haue done it.
And therefore he commaundeth such to be ordeyned, bycause they that ought to serue on the altare, and meditate Diuine Sermons, and giue the vvorde of preaching to the people, ought to estraunge themselues from secular businesse and iudgements.
The glosse calleth them contemptible, that are not apt to great offices in the Church, as to preach and teach.
And this is an argument that my lord the Pope ought not to appoint Masters of Diuinitie, to be Iudges of temporall things.
To your shame (saith the glosse) that those should examine earthly causes, that haue gotten the vvisedome of outvvarde things.
But those that are enryched vvith spirituall giftes, ought not to be entangled vvith earthly businesse, that vvhile they be not driuen to inferior goods, they may be able to attende on the higher goods.
Hovvebeit this must greatly be cared for, that they that shine in spiritual goods, forsake not vtterly the businesse of their vveake brethre~.
Thus your Papists the~selues are of a contrarie iudgement to you, M. Saunders, (besides all your Popes, and Councels Canons) that the spirituall Pastors should not be these Iudges in secular things, that here Saint Paule speaks on.
To wrest therefore these wordes spoken of any faithfull Christian, only to your Priestes: to wring this sentence from the state of the Churche, then being without any faithfull Magistrate, to the time now, when they haue many, and those not chose~ of the~selues, but ordeyned of the higher Magistrate: to wrythe it from the iudgements and taking vp of their petit quarels, to the deposing or setting vp of Kings, or altering kingdomes: is clean beyond the meaning of S. Paule, an euident violence iniurie to Gods word.
Now vpo~ this sentence thus wrested, you procéed to your argume~t, saying: For their goodes are so muche subiecte to the ecclesiasticall povver, that it is lavvfull for the Churche, of priuate men, to ordeine Magistrates, that should iudge of secular causes, and not only of ecclesiasticall.
But no man can passe more righte to an other, than he hath himselfe.
Therefore the Churche vvhich hath povver to make them Iudges, that vvere priuate men before: hath much more it selfe ouer those secular causes, receiued povver, by the Ministers of God, that as Aaron, are called to the publike mynisterie of Iesu Christ.
For vvhatsoeuer is of Christe, giuen in common to the Christian common vveale, is giuen by them that exercise the Legacie for Christe, and are Stevvards of his mysteries.
VVhatsoeuer is giuen in common of Christ to his Church, he giues it by the Pastors.
But povver to make Magistrates and Iudges, is giuen in co~mon of Christ to his Church: Ergo, it is giuen by his Pastors.
But no man can passe more right to an other, than hee hath himselfe.
The Pastors passe this right, and povver of being Magistrates and Iudges in secular matters to another: Ergo, the Pastors haue right and power of being Magistrates, and iudge themselues in secular matters.
Al these parts co~clusions of these reasons vtterly deny (Master Saunders.)
First the is fall nsample, Christe giues temporall peace, in common to his Churche: he giue· plentie of fruites, and seasonable weather, in common to his Churche: he giues health and strength of bodie, in common to his Church he giues good Magistrates, Kings and Princes, in co~mon to his Church: he giues good lawes, natural, ciuill, and municipall, in common to his Churche: all these are povvers giue~ of Christ in co~mon to the Christia~ common vveale, so well as to any other common vveale not Christian: but they are not giuen by the ministerie of the spirituall Pastors.
Secondly, the minor is also false: that Christ giueth power to his Church, to make Magistrates and Iudges ouer secular matters.
To some Churches indéed he hath giuen this power, and dothe giue it, where they orderly doe choose their owne Magistrate.
But this can not be spoken of the Church indefinitely.
For the Church in most places thereof, hath not the choice of Princes, but God (either by ordinarie succession, or by extraordinarie means) placeth them ouer the Church, and those Princes place the Iudges.
Thirdly, by the Church is not me~t, either the ecclesiastical power, or the Pastors that haue that povver.
For the povver is but Gods gift for the Churches vse and benefite, and the Pastors are but parts and members of the Church.
Fourthly, this is false also, that they can not passe a right, to another that they themselues haue not.
For euen in the dispensation of their mysteries, we maye receiue faythe and grace by their ministerie, and yet they be gracelesse, and haue no faith themselues.
And in the solemnization of Matrimonie, although the Pastor haue no right to the bryde, yet he transferreth the hauing of hir, fro~ hir friends, to the brydegrome: so may they be Ministers in the intronizing a Prince, passing a power fro~ God to him, which yet the~selues haue not, except you will make them Kings.
And thus all your rules are false, and holde not, besides that they be all wrested and cleane from the sense of the sentence cited, and therefore no good argument can be framed on them that that can rightly conclude the present purpose.
But nowe Master Saunders will applye this better, and here in the margine he setteth downe in great letters.
Nota, Note, to sturre vp the Readers attention to note his application.
But novve (saith he) if that nevve Iudges must be made of the Churche, rather than vve shoulde goe to lavve in secular causes before the Infidels, are not nevve Kings also rather to be made of the Churche, than that vve shoulde be compelled to pleade our causes, before hereticall and scismatical Kings? Nowe you beginne handsomely to frame your argument to your purpose, for al this while you did but dallie.
But if the Reader note this matter, as you require him to doe, as he shal finde no consequence in your argument, so shal he finde rancke treason in your conclusion.
If the argument were good, then bycause the Church in Saint Paules time might choose among themselues arbiters, to iudge and take vp their petite matters: therefore they might haue chosen nevv Kings also to gouerne them.
But this coulde they not haue done without treason and rebellion, therefore this argument is false.
Is there no difference (Master Saunders) betwéene the choosing of an vmpier, or an arbiter chosen betwéene two parties of their owne voluntarie, to iudge and descide their priuate controuersie, and the choosing of a supreme publike Magistrate to gouerne their whole estate? Who séeth not that this they might in no wise doe.
And so may any of vs doe also, to auoyd the charges and troubles of the lawe, although we haue Christian Princes and faithfull Iudges too, neither troubling those estates, nor our selues, and saue our money in our purses, and better nourishe charitie in not going to lawe, but taking vp the matter at home among our neyghbours quietly.
May we therefore subtracte our selues, from the Iudgement Seate of the publike Magistrate, when we are called or enforced by lawe thereto? and whye mighte we not, if we might choose a newe King, when we mislyked the olde? No, Master Saunders, this is further from Saint Paules meaning than was the other.
Saint Paule giues not the Corinths leaue nor power, to erecte vp among them selues a publike Magistrate, to flée vnto in their contentions, vtterly to forsake the iudgement seates of the heathen Iudges and Princes that did gouerne them.
Saint Paule speakes of their owne voluntarie taking vp of matters, by some indifferent man among them, to be chosen as Iudge in this or that brawle betwéene them, and woulde not haue them of their owne selfe will, in matters that might be well taken vp among themselues, to runne to Lawe before heathen Magistrates.
Wherein although he disalow the disorderly contention of the one, yet he disaloweth not withall the orderly authoritie of the other, which he confesseth to be giuen of God, and he exhorteth all subiectes to obey, and that for conscience sake, euen the gouernement of the heathen Princes, notwithstanding they were Christians that were subiectes.
Whereas if he had ment otherwise, he hadde not onely contraryed himselfe, but confirmed the sclaunder of the heathen people, that the Christians were Rebelles to their estates.
And he might haue bene accused of sedition, as styrring the people to make nevve Magistrates, whiche for them being subiectes, was aboue their power to doe.
And although this crime was layde to Saint Paules charge, of sowing sedition: yet could they neuer iustly proue it on him, his doings and writings testifyed the contrarie, with what care he labored to kepe the Christians in obedience.
Who otherwise might here vpon haue had great occasion of choosing nevve Princes, pretending they were Christians, and made frée by Christe, and therefore ought not haue suffered themselues to liue in the heathen Princes bondage.
Which fréedome of Christian libertie, least they should haue thus abused, to carnall licenciousnesse, and disturbed the order and quietnesse of their estate: Saint Paule so often and so earnestly exhorteth them vnto obedience.
Neither they did so euer vnderstande this present exhortation, to haue the libertie or power to forsake the heathen Magistrates obedience and iudgements, and to erecte a nevv Magistrate and Iudge to rule among them.
For this had bene the readie pathe to all Rebellion.
And to proue that this is the readiest way to Rebellion, sée howe Master Sau~ders gathereth hereon, that nevve Kings are to be made of the Churche, rather than vve shoulde be compelled to pleade our causes before hereticall and scismaticall Kings.
So that if the Prieste shall say, the King is an heretike or a scismatike: not only the people must so account him, but they muste account him no longer to be their King, they muste not be compelled to appeare in his Courtes and Consistories, they must pleade no cause at all before him or his Iustices, but must forthwith choose a nevv King to be their gouernour.
Howe far this is differing from Saint Paules doctrine, from this sentence, from subiectes obedience, and howe neare to set all the world in an vprore: dout not but if this Nota, that M. Sand. sets it out withal be wel noted, it wil not only bréede in the Readers mindes, a note of suspicion, of priuie conspiracies trayterous packing, but openly shew a manifest proclamatio~ of plain rebellio~.
Now to proue that ye subiects should thus rebel, he sheweth ye dangers yt should ensue, if they should remaine in their obedience.
For certaine it is, that there is more danger of heretical Kings, tha~ is of vnfaithful Iudges.
For vnfaithful Iudges do not iudge, but of matters of this world and that according to the law either of nature, which is alwayes right or ciuil, vvhiche is seldome vvrong.
Moreouer, vvhat if suffered vvrong at the tribunall of a Pagane Iudge? the losse is small, to suffer the spoyle of te~poral goods, vvhich good men beare vvith ioye.
But heretical Kings compel their subiects, casting away the catholike faith, to embrace their heresie, the whiche can not be done vvithout the detriment of eternall saluation.
It is altogither lavvfull to the Churche of Christe, to remoue from his gouernement an heretical, a scismatical, a symoniacal King, and to conclude, to remoue him, that vvill not amende himselfe, and to place another among the Christians in his rome.
This argument is drawne from the danger of suffering the king, is alreadie answered diuers times.
The lawiers woulde briefly say to this, better suffer a mischiefe, than an inconuenience, but were this an inconuenience too, we may not take away one inconuenience with an other greater inconuenience: for ther are conuenient remedies of pacience constancie, against these inconueniences, and not rebellion, althoughe the inconuenience were muche greater than M. Sa~d. makes it.
And yet to aggrauate ye same, he makes co~parison of a King and a Iudge, as though the Iudge represented not the King.
He compareth the daunger of the losse by the one, and by the other: as thoughe the heathen Iudges and Princes dealt not also in cases of Religion.
Who (although they were deceiued herein) yet they conuented people before them for Religion, to driue them from the worship of God, to the worship of their Idols, and laboured by all persuasions and meanes they coulde, to bring them to their Religio~.
And verie many they brought to their Idolatrie, which was more tha~ the losse of temporal goods: eue~ the detriment of eternal saluatio~.
Neither did they vse their iudgeme~ts always according to the lavv of nature or the ciuil: neyther doth the one iudge alvvayes right, considering the great corruption of nature, chiefly in the heathen: neyther did the other sildome wrong, but often wrong among them: neither medled the ciuill Lawe of the Pagans, onely with matters of temporall goodes, and of this vvorlde, but also with matters of the worlde to come, and therefore there was further daunger of the iudgementes of those heathen Princes and vnfaythefull Iudges, than here Maister Saunders woulde séeme to acknowledge there was, mitigating all that he can, the daunger ensuing from them: to aggrauate the greater dau~gers from naughtie Christian Princes.
But he nede not run to these vntruthes, to aggrauate his comparison.
For we denie not, but that if the Prince were such a wicked Prince as he speaketh of, it were in dede very daungerous to the faithfull subiects vnder him, and so muche the more daungerous that he pretendeth to the faithfull, to be a faithfull Prince, and is not.
But what a daungerous doctrine is this, that the people should therfore rebell, and reuolt vnto another.
Might the Christia~ people in ye primitue Church for all the dau~ger of eternall life that they and all the faithfull were in, when the heathen Princes would haue them worship Idols, which is as ill as heresie: when the heretical scismaticall Emperors being Arians, Monothelites. &c. in the ancient time, compelled their subiectes, casting away the Catholike faith, to embrace their heresies, might they remoue the~ from their gouernment, and place another in his roome ouer the Christians? and that yt shoulde streight be heresie, which the B· of Rome should say were heresie, he should be a scismatike that should not consent to him? Yea, he must be deposed for symonie too· by symonie forsooth we must vnderstand, that if the Prince do appoint and inuest a Bishop, then streight he is a simoniake, and must out of hande be depesed.
What a greater dau~ger is here, not onely to Christia~ Princes, but to all the Church of Christ, whose sauegarde is here pretended? But if we reason of dau~gers, the greatest dau~ger of all is of the Pope himselfe his prelates, the more daunger, that Princes people be thus beguiled by them, and yet the king may not meddle with them, although his duetie neuer so much require, he hath good warrant in the scripture remoue them, so haue not they of him, were they neuer good, and were he a great deale worse than M. Saunders makes him.
But Maister Saunders will nowe proue that the Bishops haue warrant out of the scripture for them, and once againe he alleageth the example of King Saul and Samuel.
For if the kingdome of Saul stoode not, euen for this that he obserued not the precept of Samuel, in wayting for him seuen dayes before he sacrificed.
Yea if the Lord cast off Saul that he shuld not be the king, bicause he fulfilled not also another precept of the Lorde declared by the Ministerie of Samuel in killing Agag: if for this disobedience of Saul, while he yet raigned, Samuel was bidden to anoynt Dauid, to be the King of the Iewes: and Samuel did it priuily in Bethleem: Neither after the holy Ghost sent downe from heauen, the spirituall power of the Church can now be lesse, than in times past was in the Synagog: we must now also confesse, that that King, which shall dispise to heare the Lord speaking by the mouth of the highest Bishop, maye so be depriued of the right of his kingdome, that another may in the meane season be of the same Byshop anoynted for King, and that from that day forwarde, he truely shalbe the King whome the Bishop orderly anoynted, or other wise did consecrate, and not he that being armed with a bande of souldiers, occupieth the seate.
For of such the Prophet saith: they haue reigned, and not by me, the which thing is so true, that loathas the sonne of Saul acknowledged that the Kingdome shoulde fall vnto Dauid, after the death of his Father.
And al that were in nede sled vnto Dauid, and he became their Prince, and there were with him as it were foure hundreth men, and when Achimelech the Priest asked Counsell of the Lorde for Dauid, and Saul hauing intelligence thereof, commaunded his seruaunts to fall vpon the Priests of the Lorde: no man durst execute so cruel a commaundement, besides onely Doeg the Idumean.
Firste, that the Pope maye depose a King and set vp another.
Secondly, that the King so deposed by the Pope, is no longer lawfull King nor to be obeyed, but the subiectes ought to go to the other whom the Pope sets vp. Thirdly that althoughe the Pope maye depofe a King: yet no King maye depofe or touch the Pope or his Priests.
For the first point, are alle aged these arguments: The spirituall power is as greate nowe in the Church, since the holy Ghost was sent from heauen, as it was before in the Synagog.
But Kings were then deposed, and other set vp, by the spirituall power: Ergo, Kings may now likewise be deposed by the spirituall power, and other set vp.
But the spirituall power belongeth to the highest Bishop: The Bishop of Rome is the highest Bishop.
Ergo, the Bishop of Rome maye depose Kings and set vp other.
The later argument, which we vtterly denie, and here he proueth not, but taketh for confessed, that there is in earth a highest Bishop ouer all other, and that the Pope is he: is belonging to another controuersie.
The spirituall power is as great nowe, after the holy Ghost was sene from heauen, as it was before in the Synagog.
That the deposing of Kings and sitting vp of other in their steede was not done then in the Synagog by the spirituall power, that is, by the spirituall authoritie of the spirituall pastor.
For proofe hereof, M. Saunders inferreth an instance of Saul and Samuel.
Saul loste his Kingdome bycause he obserued not the precepte of Samuel.
First this facte was not a matter ordinarily belonging to the spirituall power of Samuel, but an especialtie of gods singular appointing.
It was not a thing belo~ging to the Byshops office, to depose Kings and set other in their places, it was but a particular acte done by gods especiall co~maundement, so that it could not, nor was euer drawne into any ordinarie rule of their spirituall power then: and much lesse is any thing belonging to the Bishops spirituall power nowe, which is an ordinarie power, and consisteth in setting forth the word of God, in administring the sacraments of God, and in bynding or losing the conscience of the obstinate or repentant sinner.
Which things sith none of them pertaine to the deposing of a Prince or any other man, from his temporall possessions and worldly estate: it is apparant that this extraordinarie doing of Samuel, was neither the~ nor now ordinarily pertaining to the spirituall power of pastors.
Secondly it is false that Saul lost his kingdome for not obseruing the precepte of Samuel.
For althoughe Samuel pronou~ced it, yet it was the Lords precept, as like wise the other precepts, of which M. Saunders confesseth: that he fulfilled not the precept of the Lorde, declared by the ministerie of Samuel.
So that Samuel was but the Minister of declaring it.
But say you, then muste not the King dispise to heare the Lord speaking by the mouth of the highest Bishop.
We grau~t you M. Sanders the King must not dispise to heare the Lorde speaking by the mouth of any Bishop.
As for any highest B. besides Iesus Christ, we denie.
And the King ought to dispise to here him which claimeth that highest roome.
For it is an euident argument that the Lord speaketh not by such a blasphemous month, as exalteth it selfe into Christes Bishopprike.
As for Samuel tooke not vpon him to be the highest Priest or Bishop, nor was any B. or Priest at al, nor spake any thing at all, that he had not the especiall and expresse commandement of God therto.
Let your Pope and his Bishops shewe the expresse commaundement of God, either especiall or ordinary, that they be bidden to depose Kings and set vp other, or else you wrest this example, and doe no lesse abuse God, than you would abuse Princes by it.
Thirdly, this is false also, that Samuell either deposed Saule, or et vp Dauid.
Concerning Saule, he declared to him, howe his kingdome should not continue, but he deposed him not.
The wordes of Samuell are these: Thou haste do foolishly, that thou haste not obserued the commaundementes of the Lorde thy God, that he commaunded thee.
If thou haddest not done this thing, the Lorde had euen nowe established thy kingdome ouer Israell for euer.
The Lorde hathe soughte him a man according to his heart, and hathe commaunded him, that he shoulde be captayne ouer his people, bicause thou haste not kepte the thinges the Lorde commaunded thee.
Ad as Caietanus a Papist noteth thereon, This commaundement of the Lorde, violated by Saule, was not a commaundement of the lawe, but a particular commaundement declared to Saule by Samuel.
Secondly, he referreth the punishment, not to his remouing of him, but to the dooing of God.
Thirdly, he dothe not (neither in his owne name, nor in Gods) depose him at all from his estate, but telleth him howe his kingdome shall not continue.
Vltrate (saythe he) It shall continue no further after thee.
Bicause his sonne Isboseth raygned not ouer all Israell, neither yet ouer that peaceably, and that for a small time.
And this purpose of God (as Lyra nateth) although it were then declared, by reason of the present demerite of Saule: yet was it the Lordes euerlasting purpose.
It was before ordeined of God, that the kingdome should be giuen to the tribe of Iuda, as appeareth Gene.
But the Pope can not shew the like purpose of God, that suche or such a Prince should nowe be deposed or placed: therefore he dothe but wrest this example.
As for the placing of Dauid: Although (sayth Lyra) this was yet to come, he speaketh notwithstanding, as thoughe it were paste, for the certeintie of the diuine prouidence.
So that yet no acte was ast agaynst Saul, or vnto Dauid, but onely a declaration of Gods purpose to come.
Héere was therefore no deposing of the one, nor placing of the other.
is more destnite, when he saythe: For that thou hast caste off the worde of the Lorde, the Lorde hath caste off thee, that thou shouldest not be king.
And yet he sayth not héere, depose thee· or the Lorde deposeth thée, from thine estate, and fro~ hencefoorth thou shalte neither be king, nor be reputed and taken of the Churche of God for king any longer.
Samuell sayth not thus, nor ment thus, nor Saule vnderstoode him thus, but desired Samuel to returne with him, and worship the Lorde.
And Samuell (repeating his words) sayd: wil not returne with thee, bicause thou hast cast of the comandement of the Lord, the Lorde hath cast off thee.
And Samuell turned to go away, but he caught holde of the skirte of his cloake, and it rent.
And Samuell sayde to him, the Lorde hath rent the kingdome of Israell this day fro~ thee, and hath giuen it to thy neighbour, a better than thou.
And yet in all these so effectuall words, Samuell sayth not héere, In Dei nomine, Amen, &c· In the name of God Amen.
do héere presenly depose thée, and so foorth, as the Pope vseth to do.
No, all this was but a declaration of the time to come, as Lyra saythe: Dicunt autem Hebraei, &c.
Some Hebrnes say, that Samuel then gaue a signe vnto Saule, that he shoulde raigne for him, that shoulde cutte off the hemme of his garment.
VVherevpon Saule seeing the hemme of his garment in Dauids hande: sayde, nowe knowe for certayne that thou shalte raygne.
And so the Glosse titeth Sainct Augustine Iste cui dixit. &c.
This man to whome the Lorde sayde, the Lorde despiseth thee, that thou shouldest not be King of Israell, and the Lorde hathe rent this day the kingdome out of thy hand: ruled fortie yeres, to wite, euen as long as Dauid raigned.
And yet this thing he hearde the first time of his raigne.
Therefore wee vnderstande· it to be spoken to this ende, that none of the stocke of him shoulde raigne.
He rente it (saythe the Glosse) althoughe he reygned fortie yeres afterwarde.
But as then he desrued that the kingdome shoulde be rente from him, and giuen to a better· &c.
Thus these sayinges and doinges of Samuell, were not the reall deposing of Saule from his Royall throne.
For bothe he tooke him selfe still as King, and desired Samuel to honor him before the Elders of his people, and before Israell.
Although (sayth not for my persons sake, yet do this thing for the honor of my royall dignitie.
willing (sayth Lyra) to giue it vnto Saule, so long as he was of God suffred in the kingdome.
Nowe as for Dauid, Samuell in déede anoynted him, and that (as you saye) priuilie.
Whiche argueth agaynst you, that it was no publike acte of making him king, but as it were a preparatiue vnto it, and a priuie forewarning of Gods purpose to come.
Secondly it was a thing of Gods especiall appoynting, or else Samuell would not, nor coulde haue euer done it.
Thirdly (saythe yra) Aduertendum est, &c· VVe muste marke, that Dauid was anoynted to be king, not to this purpose, that he shoulde streighte possesse the kingdome.
But God did suffer Saule in the possession of the kingdome, euen vntill his death.
And thus we sée vpon this acte of the Lorde by Samuell, as well to Saule, as to Dauid· héere was yet no suche deposing of the one, nor setting vp the other, as Master Sanders claymeth héere, reasoning from the example of Samuels dooing to Saule and Dauid: for the Pope to Christian Princes offending, and to set vp others in the places.
The second thing yt he gathereth héerevpon, is this: that the king by the Pope béeing deposed, is now no longer true lawful king· but a playne vsurper, and a wrongful occupier of the kings seae, beeing armed with a bande of souldiers.
but the other that is annoynted, or otherwise consecrated by the Bishop in his place: shall truely from this day forward be the king, and the people ought to go to him, and not obey the other.
First, for the wordes of the Prophet whiche are these: They haue raygned, and not by me.
First these wor are Gods complaynt agaynst the wickednesse of those kinges of Israel· that directed not their gouernment by Gods law: not that they were not kings, but that they were wicked kings.
Not that they were by no meanes ordeyned of God, for potestas est Deo, all power is of God, and God sayth in generall, per reges regnant, Kings rule by me, so well heathen as faythfull kinges· Pilates power was from aboue: These kinges of Israell, Ieroboam, Achab, Iehu. &c. were of Gods ordeyning.
Yeà Iehu, whose house héere God complayned vpon, and sayde, he and his ofspring raigned not by him· were yet notwithstanding made kinges, and raygned by him.
In respecte of their ambition and priuate affections, their raigne was not of him.
In respecte of Gods ordinaunce, of his iustice, of his prouidence, it was not only permitted, but also especially appoynted of him.
As bothe the· texte is and your owne glosse confesseth for Hieroboam the elder, that it was done by Gods will, althoughe it were done also by the peoples sinne, that regarded not the will of God; but llowed their owne selfewil.
And so in some respecte, it was not the worke of God, and yet in other respects, it as the worke of God.
Not that he was ignorant of them, but he acknowledged not their doings.
Secondly, neither the prophet Osee, nor any other prophet, tooke vpon them to depose any of those wicked kinges, but to declare the wrath and vengeance of God to come vpon them.
After which declarations, they did not subtract fro~ them their ciuill obedience, count them from that day forward no longer to be their kings, or exhorted the Church of God to forsake their polytike gouernment: but hauing declared their message from God, they let them alone, till eyther God him selfe did strike the~, or stirred vp by some especiall and extraordinarie meanes, some forren or domestical persecu of them.
Thirdly, this maketh nothing to proue yt those kings, the Pope taketh vpon him to pronou~ce they be no Kings, are no longer Kings: except he will make him selfe God, yea and aboue God too.
For althoughe God say, They gne not by me· yet he calleth them kinges.
But the Pope calleth them vurpers, that raygne not by him.
Secondly he alleageth the acknowledging of Ionathas Saules sonne, the peoples gathering vnto Dauid For Io nathas, it is true, that he acknowledged the kingdome shold be deuolued vnto Dauid after his fathers deathe· And so he saith: Tu regnabis super Israel, Thou shalt raigne ouer Israell, shall be next to thee, and this my father knoweth.
But this inferreth not, that he tooke Dauid then presently to be king, and his faher from that day forwarde no longer to be king, neither reuolted he from the obedience of his father, to Dauids obedience, neither could his father lay this treason to his charge, that he forsooke his due subiection, although most bitterly rated him, and sayde: Thou sonne of the wicked rebellious woman, do not knowe that thou haste chosen the sonne of Isai to thy confusion, to the confusion and shame of thy mother? For as long as the sonne of Isai liueth vpon the earth, thou shalt not be established nor thy kingdome.
Whereon (sayth Caietane) the cause is made manyfest, bicause he was an impediment to the succession of the kingdome, and verily Saule had a true iudgement, as the euent of the matter proued.
And thus the acknowledging of Ionathas proued not Dauids kingdome to be in esse (as they say) but in futuro, not that he was King, but that he should be King.
Nor the confederacie betwéene Dauid and Ionathas, was any conspiracie to depose Saule, or to set vp Dauid, but a confirming of the loue betwéene them and their houses, when God should make him king.
Nowe for the peoples gathering vnto Dauid about the number of,
this was not to assemble a rebellious multitude, to inuade king Saule, to depose him fro~ the crowne to set vp him selfe.
For neither they came for any such purpose, but for their succor, béeing in debt trouble, or otherwise vexed: neither did Dauid send for them, nor incite any to take his part, not proclaimed him selfe to be king, or published the Lords anoynting of him, or euer vsed that multitude that came vnto him for any suche purposes.
And yet the question is moued bothe by Caietanus and Lyranus héerevpon.
The question (saythe Caietanus) atiseth, whether it were lawfull for Dauid to receiue these debters, in the preiudice of the creditors that had lent them? The solution is, that if these men had house, field, or vineyard they are vnderstoode to haue lefte their goodes vnto them.
But if they were vtterly vnable to pay their debts: they were excused for their vnhabilitie, vntill their better habilitie.
For, that Dauid excellently instructed all them that came vnto him, while he aried in that caue, the Psalme restifieth: will prayse the Lorde at all time.
Conteyning (according to the letter) a doctrine giuen there of Dauid vnto the souldiors.
Therfore Dauid receiued not these men in preiudice of their creditors.
And thus as he did not receiue them to the preiudice of any priuate man, so he receiued them not to the preiudice of the king and publike state.
Wheron Lyra moneth the other questio~, saying: In that he became their captain, it seemeth he sinned, in receiuing suche as Abimelech receiued: the needie and vagabounds, assembling the~ vnto him as is contayned, Iud.
VVe muste say, that he gathered them not, to slay the innocent, as did Abimelech to slay his brethren, neither to spoyle the faythfull.
For we reade not that he spoyled the people of Israell.
But he gathered them, to persecute the Infidels, as is contayned afterwarde in many cases.
And to keepe his owne body from the ambushementes of Saule.
The which he mighte do in suche a necessitie, chiefly when he was nowe anoynted king.
By reason whereof, in suche a case, he might prolong the payment of the debtes, and in many the forfeyture is released in the case aforesayde.
Thus sée it was not for that ye people tooke Dauid actually to be king, but for their owne refuge, that they fled to him.
But whatsoeuer their intent was good or ill, Dauid assembled them not to hinder or hurte any priuate or publike person.
And althoughe he receiued them, and vsed them for his defence, whiche he mighte do, béeing in the state he was: yet woulde he neuer suffer them to enter medle in the quarell of his righte to the kingdome, nor yet he him selfe woulde euer take it vpon him, and impugne king Saule, no not when he had him in hys daunger, vntyll the Lorde by other meanes tooke Saule away, and gaue the kingdome in reall possession vnto Dauid.
Before whiche time Dauid neuer called him selfe king, nor the time of his raygne is reckoned, but Saule counted and called, and his raigne reckoned, as king, till his death, and neuer shortned, disturbed, nor once gayne sayd by Dauid for all these folkes assemblies.
When God sent king Saule (as it were of purpose) euen into Dauids handes, and the souldiers moued Dauid to kill him: he would neither him selfe hurt him, nor suffer any other to do it, nor yet take him prisoner, so depose him, or cause him to resigne.
But only cut off priuily a flap of his garment, for a testimonie howe he spared him, yet his heart throbbed, that he had done so muche agaynst him.
His conscience reproued him (sayth Lyra) in that he had done vnreuerently to Saule, who was to be honored so long as he was of God suffred in the kingdome.
certaine remorce of conscience (sayth Caietane) is described in Dauid, in that he had cutoff the skirte of Saules cloake.
For it is the propertie of good mindes, euen there to feare a fault, where faulte is not found.
The reason of his remorce was, bicause the cutting of the cloake was in his proper kinde iniurious.
Howbeit it was without fault, both bicause it was giuen vnto him, by Gods authoritie, to do with Saule that whiche seemed good in Dauids owne eies: and also good reason moued, that Dauid mighte shewe a signe of his beneuolence towardes Saule, by a most euident testimonie conuicting Saule: that yet at the least, Saule might leaue off from so wicked persecution.
But a better testimony he could not shewe, than the skirte of his garment there cut off: the action therfore naturally iniurious, was not done in the forme of an iniurie, but of a necessarie signe, to witnesse the truthe of Dauids right mind to Saule· And this good minde Dauid him selfe expresseth: The Lorde keepe me from doing this thing vnto my Lorde, the Lords anoynted, to lay mine hande on him, for he is the Lords anoynted.
And héere Caietanus giueth this note: He toucheth two reasons.
The one, in that he saith: to my Lorde: The other, To the Lordes anoynted.
But bicause that was the chiefest reason, for that Saule was anoynted of the most highe God, that onely he nameth twyse.
Whereby we sée, he accempted Saule still as his lawfull king, and himselfe to be his dutifull and obedient subiect.
And so he acknowledged him selfe to Saule, when he cried after him, saying: my Lord the king· and when Saule looked behind him, Dauid enelined his face to the earth and bowed himselfe.
And Dauid sayd to Saul: wherefore giuest thou eare to mennes words that say, beholde Dauid seeketh euill against thee.
Beholde this day thine eyes haue seene, that the Lorde hath deliuered thee this day into my hand in the caue, and some badde me kill thee.
But had compassion on thee, and sayd, will not lay my hande on my Maister.
Moreouer (my father) behold, say, the lappe of thy garment in my hande.
For when cut off the lappe of thy garment, killed thee not.
Vnderstande and see that there is no euill nor wickednesse in me, neither haue sinned against thee.
According to the Hebrue (saith Caietane) neither is rebellion in me. &c.
For last of all, he excludeth sinne against Saul: and before, rebellion against the King: and first of all, euill vniuersally.
And vpon these words, The Lord be iudge betwen thee and me: And the Lord auenge me of thee, and let not my hand be on thee.
This he said (saith Lyra) in the zeale of Iustice, and not of reuengement.
For no body ought to take vengeance on his own iniurie, by himself, except it lye vpon him by his office, and euen then it were better that he did it by another.
All these words (saith Caietane) are not of him that wisheth, but foretelleth and expecteth.
For they are, in the Hebrue texte, of the future tence and the indicatiue mode.
So farre is Dauid from wishing any euil vnto the king.
And he so humbleth himselfe vnto him: that he calleth himselfe, in compariso~ of the King, a dead dogge and a flie: Sith am (saith Lyra) of no moment (or nothing worth) in regarde of thee: Thus farre was Dauid fro~ euer attempting to depose King Saul, after Samuel had anoynted him.
And that not onely where Ionathas, but euen where Saul himselfe acknowledged, that Dauid shoulde be Kng after him, saying: and nowe know of a certaintie, that thou shalt raigne and the kingdome of Israel shall be established in thy hand.
But yet he saith not, that he then presently raigned, neither doth he resigne vnto him, but make a couenant and take an othe of Dauid, that when he should raigne, he shoulde not destroy his séede after him, nor take away his name from his fathers house, this, Dauid swore vnto him.
Wherin he acknowledgeth though a state to come, yet no state in present.
For when he might haue killed him, and Abisai would haue killed him he not onely woulde not doe it, nor suffer it to be done.
For who can laye his handes on the Lords anoynted and be giltlesse.
Dauid (sayth Lyra) wold gyue this to the person of him, so long as he was suffered of God in the Kingdome.
Alwayes (sayth Caietane) Dauid had fixed in his harte, and in his mouth the honour of the moste high God, in so muche that he thoughte none innocent, that stretched hys hande vpon the anoynted of God.
As the Lorde lyueth (saith he) either the Lord shall smite him, or his day shall come to dye, or he shall descende into battell and perishe.
The Lorde keepe me from laying my hand vpon the Lords anoynted.
By this (saith Lira) Dauid entended, that by no meanes, he would be the efficient cause of his death, excepte perhaps in defending himselfe, so that he could not otherwise escape.
And when Dauid called to Abner, he challenged him to be worthy of death, for keping the Kings person no better, and when Saul knowing his voice said, is this thy voyce my sonne Dauid? and Dauid sayd, it is my voyce, my Lorde King.
And he sayde, wherefore doth my Lord thus persecute his seruant? for what haue done, or what euil is in my hand? Now therefore beseeche thee, let my Lorde the King heare the wordes of his seruaunt. &c. thus humbleth he himselfe in his purgation, and sayth, the King of Israell is come out to seeke a flie, as one woulde hunte a Partridge in the mountaynes.
So lowly abasing himselfe in comparison of Saul, whome he calleth the King of Israel.
Neyther dissembled he but spake Bona fide, euen as he thought in his hart.
So farre was Dauid from not acknowledging Saul to be still hys soueraigne Lorde and lawfull King, so farre from gathering anye vnlawfull assemblyes againste him, so farre from any priuie conspiracie or open rebellion, so farre from so much as thinking to depose him: that when he had him in his daunger, he woulde not onely not hurt him, nor suffer other to doeit, but gaue him so great honour, as any subiecte can giue his Prince.
How then is not the storie of Saule and Dauid wrested, for a Christian subiect that hath no such authoritie, as Dauid had, to depose, or take armes against his Christian Prince, or to go from the obedience of him, as no longer lawfull Kyng, after the Byshop shall saye, he hathe deposed him, and to obey any other, that the Bishop shal appoint for King? The third thing that Master Saunders inferreth, is this, that althoughe the Pope and his Bishops may doe thus to Princes: yet Princes were very tyrants, if they should doe oughte to them.
And hereto he alleageth, that when the high Priest Achimelech, asked counsell of the Lord for Dauid, Saul hauing intelligence thereof, commaunded his seruants to fall vpon the Priests of the Lord: no man durst execute so cruell a commaundement, besides onely Doeg the Idumean.
For Achimelechs asking counsell of the Lord for Dauid, Wh Dauid fled vnto him: first, the case (Maister Saunders) is not so cléere, but that (as Lyra confesseth) a question is made theron: for there appéereth no such thing in the.
Althoughe Doeg so accused him, and Achimelech standeth not to the deniall thereof, but vpon his innocencie.
Some saye that he lyed, as tale bearers are wont to saye more than is in deede, but the contrary seemeth rather to bee true.
So that this is not so cleare a case, as you make it.
But what is all thys storye to the purpose, or not rather againste you? especially that that followeth, of Saules puttyng the Priestes to death.
Wherein although he dyd a wycked and tyrannous acte, yet it argueth that he had authoritie ouer the Priestes.
Firste, in that he cyted them to come before him.
Secondly, in that they obeyed his citation and came before the King.
Thirdly, in that the high Priest calleth the King his Lord, saying: here am my Lord.
Fourthly, when the King layde treason to his charge, he replyeth not, that he could be no traitor to the King, beyng his superior: but as inferior, pleadeth he was no traytor.
Fiftly, he acknowledgeth both Dauid to be Saules seruaunt, himselfe also, saying: be it farre from mee, let not the King impute any thing vnto his seruaunt, nor to all the house of my father, for thy seruaunt knew nothing of all this, lesse or more.
Wherby it appeareth that the high Priest and all his familie, were vnder the Kings obedience, and so still continued, after that Samuel had declared, how that the Lord had rent his kingdome from him.
As for that the Prince abused his authoritie, to the cruell murdering of innocentes: we graunt it was so detestable, that his souldiors did well, in refusing to execute his wicked commaundement.
We defend no suche authoritie in Princes, nor such obedience in subiectes, as murdereth innocents without all lawe and Iustice, and that after suche a cruell sort, as did the doggishe Doeg, being not content to murder the innocent ministers of God: but besides, to put to the edge of thes worde, all the men and women in their Citie, yea the Children sucking babes also.
You can finde no protestant Prince (M. Saunders) that euer did the like déede.
But Popishe Princes haue not onely done the like, but farre surmounted, both Saul and Doeg, and all other cruel Princes, in such vnnaturall Tragedies.
So fitte all Maister Saunders ensamples serue his purpose, that euerye one maketh cleane against him.
But now (saith he) least any man should thinke, at the least the power of those Kings that sprang from Dauid, to be greater than the spirituall power of the Synagog: let him besides this consider, that Ahias the Silonite, while Salomon was yet aliue, foretolde that Ieroboam should gouerne the ten tribes.
VVhervpon is vnderstood, that either the whole kingdome, or some part therof, may be taken away from a wicked King, by the spirituall power of the Churche.
For what power was in times past, in the Priests and Prophets: the same is now in the pastors and teachers, whose duetie it is so to consulte for the soules health, that they suffer not, by the disobedience and tyrannie of a wicked King, the people of an infinite multitude, to be compelled and drawne to scisme and heresie.
The argument is still as before, from the spirituall power in Priests Prophets then in the Synagog, to the spiritual power of popishe pastors teachers in the Church now.
To this besides the former answere, answere againe: first, the popishe pastors teachers, being false pastors false teachers, except it be from such Priestes Prophetes as were of Baal, Balaam, Bel. &c. can frame no good conclusion.
Secondly, admit they were (which they pretend) true pastors teachers: yet the argument is not true, from any particular especial charge, giue~ vnto some one or two of them, by gods expresse commaundement, to foretell this or that thing to come: to conclude therevpon an ordinarie spirituall power, in all the priests prophets then, and ye like to succéede in the pastors teachers now.
Thirdly, neither any such thing is described or ment by S. Paul Epe.
in the office of pastors teachers now: neither this example of the old testament.
inferreth any such thing done by the priests or prophets then.
The example of he alleaged before, but he thinketh here to frame it better to his purpose.
The prophet Ahias while King Salomon liued, foretold Ieroboam that he should raigne ouer ten Tribes.
Ergo, either the whole kingdome or a part therof, may be taken from a wicked King by the spiritull power, that is, by the pastors and teachers of the Church.
from foretelling the taking away thereof, to the taking away thereof in déede.
The foretelling belonged to that Prophet, to who~ God not onely reuealed it, but commaunded to foretell it.
The taking away therof either in part or in whole, belo~ged only to God, working by his secrete or open Iustice, and to those (as instruments of his wrath) whom he ordained to do it: that is, by Ieroboam and such as rebelled with him.
And, howbeit this fact, when· it was done, was such a specialtie, as can not be drawne to an example, no more than can the attempt of Abraham to kill his sonne: yet was not this facte done in Salomons dayes.
Who all his life long raigned King of the whole kingdome notwithstanding all this Prophecie.
In dede Ieroboam which was a wicked man, lifte vp his hand and rebelled against Salomon, not tarying the Lords oportunitie as Dauid did, but following his owne ambition, he abused the prophetes message.
Who although he tolde him that God woulde giue him ten tribes, yet he tolde him that Salomon shoulde raigne all his life time.
But will take the kingdome (saythe God by the Prophete vnto Ieroboam) oute of his sonnes hande, and will giue tenne Tribes to thee. &c. so that this serueth not Maister Saunders purpose, to dispossesse the presente estate of the Prince lyuing.
Neyther sayth the Prophet, he will doe it: neyther byddeth he Ieroboam to rebel, eyther against Salomon or his sonne, but he sayth, God him selfe would doe it.
To the which sentence and worke of God, Ieroboam ought to haue obeyed.
Which in so much as he did not, he disobeyed God, and was a traytor to his Prince, and deserued death.
Althoughe God by his secrete iustice, so punished Salomons séede, that he confirmed the Kingdome in Ieroboams handes, and made him a lawfull King.
But in all these things here was nothyng done by the Prophete, but the foretelling of Gods purpose.
For otherwyse, had he presumed thus of his owne heade, by reason of the authoritie of hys Propheticall office, whatsoeuer Salomen had deserued, he had for his parte béene but a rayterous Prophete, and so are all those Popishe Pastors and teachers, that teache subiectes to rebell against their Soueraignes, on pretence of these examples.
True Pastors and teachers by thys particular example, maye learne thus muche in generall, to teache Princes to feare God and dreade his Iustice, to beware of Idolatrie and of ioyning themselus in mariage, or in other leages of friendship, wyth the enimyes of gods truth.
Achab for ioyning in friendshippe with Benadab, was punished: and marying the wicked Iesabell did euen ell him selfe to wickednesse.
Yea the good King Iosaphat, for ioyning in league with the wicked King Ochozias Achabs sonne, was reproued sharpely and his ships perished.
These examples and suche other, ought good pastors and reachers to teach their Princes, and to set the wrathe of God before them, howe he will roote vp their houses, and destroye their kingdomes, if they feare not hym.
Thus oughte good teachers by these examples to doe, but not they themselues to depose theyr Princes, or to sette vp other, and stirre the people to rebellion.
To the same purpose pertayneth that Elias anoynted Asael King ouer Syria, and Iehu King ouer Israel, and Elizeus to be Prophet for himself, on that condition, that if any escaped the handes of Asahel, him should Iehu kill: But if any escaped the hands of Iehu, him should Elizeus kill.
If thys ensample pertayne to the same purpose, that doe the other of Samuels anoynting Dauid, and of Ahias foretellyng Ieroboam that he shoulde raygne: then pertayneth it not to your purpose, (Maister Saunders) for Byshoppes to depose Christian Princes, and to make their subiectes rebell againste them.
For the other (as we haue alreadye playnely séene) are but manifestly and shamefully wrested therevnto.
But nowe let vs sée, if thys example of Elias wyll serue your turne any better.
The argument is driuen to both these purposes, the one, for the anoynting of a new king: the other, for punishing of the former king.
For ye anointing of a new king, is alleaged, that Elias anoynted Asael King ouer Syria, and Iehu King ouer Israel, and Elizeus to be the prophet for himselfe.
First answere, as before, these are againe the expresse particular co~ma~deme~ts, of the Lord vnto Elias, giuing him a particular charge, that he should anoyut all these three.
To stretch therfore the Lords particular charge to him, vnto a generall rule, without any expresse co~mandement of Lord thervnto, is a daungerous presumptuous abusing of Gods co~mandement.
For without this especiall charge of God, Elias had no ordinarie authoritie, by vertue of his prophetical office, to haue done any thing herein, as the popish Bishops, without any particular commandement of God, take vpon them to do, by vertue of their Bishoply office.
Secondly answere, that this anointing of these Kyngs, was not ye real inuesting of them, in their royall estate, neither yet done by Elias him selfe, as euen your owne glosse noteth theron.
Vnges Asahel. &c. Thou shalt anoynt Azahel: no otherwise but that he foretold him, that he shoulde be king in time to come.
He anoynted Elizeus no otherwise, than by casting his cloake on him.
The two Kings, neither he by him self, neithor Elizeus his disciple anoynted them, but one of the Prophets was sent to anoynt Iehu.
And this Prophet in déede powred oyle on Iehu his head, and said, Thus saith the Lorde God of Israel, haue anoynted thee King, ouer the people of the Lord of Israel.
Which fact and saying, as the Popish Bishops can not imitate, hauing no suche commission: so the other anoynting of Asael, was but a forewarning, like as the former facte of Ahias was to Ieroboam, and therefore serueth not this purpose, least of all the anoynting of Elizeus, who was no King but a Prophete, and therefore is alleaged cleane oute of place, to inferre the present purpose of anoynting Kings.
But M. Sanders hathe a further fetche in naming Elizeus.
For thereby, as in Elias he thinkes to proue the setting vp of kings: so in Elizeus he would inferre their pulling downe.
For (sayth he) Elias annoynted Asael, Iehu, and Elizeus, on that condition, that if one escaped the handes of Asael, him shoulde Iehu kill: but if any escape the handes of Iehu, him shoulde Elizeus kill.
You falsefie the Scripture (M. Sanders) the words are not, that they shoulde be anoynted on that condition, that they should do these things: but the Lord statly foretelleth, that they shall do these things.
And it shall be, that whosoeuer escapeth from the sworde of Asael, him shall Iehu kill: and he that escapeth the sworde of Iehu, him shall Elizeus kill.
Wherevpon sayth Lyra, that Asaell and Iehu killed many Idolaters of Israell, is inough expressed after in the fourth booke.
But that Elizeus killed any, is not read, but of two and fortie whome he cursed, wherevpon the Beares did teare them.
But sayth Caietane, notwithstanding nothing letteth, but that these thinges were fulfilled, euen as the letter foundeth, althoughe the execution be not written.
So that if this slaughter of Elizeus be ment spiritually, then it serueth not for bodily punishment, whiche is nowe the question.
If it be ment bodily, as was the slaughter made by the Leuites, when they slewe aboue.
for Idolatrie, and as Phinees stabbing with his dagger Zambri and Cozbi for their whoredome: then either of these, béeing particular charges, and especiall commaundementes, can not be stretched to the like example of bodily slaughter, to be committed by the Clergie nowe.
Neyther the popishe Priestes (althoughe they be the chéefest authors of it) will prtende that they will medle therein, but saye with the Priestes that put Christ to death, It is not lawfull for vs to kill any man.
And to this purpose of a figuratiue killing, M. Sand driueth this example.
By which figure (sayth he) what else is signified, than that many powers are set vp, and erected in the Churche of God, that that which is not done by one of them, may be done by another.
Of whiche powers, the laste and chiefest is that whiche belongeth to the Prophets, that is, towards them that are the Pastors and teachers of the Churche of God.
For as the sworde of Elizeus is reckoned in the laste place, as whiche no man can escape, althoughe he escape the sworde of Asaell, or of Iehu: so the censure of the spirituall power can by no meanes be auoyded, althoughe any escape the sworde of the secular power.
For the spirituall power vseth not the bodily or visible sworde, whiche by certayne meanes may be let, but vseth the sworde of the spirite, that passeth throughe all places, and pierceth euen to the soule of him whome it reacheth.
First, M. Sanders, you do more than you can well iustifie, to wring this facte, to this figuratiue signification of this spirituall sworde.
For if Elizeus did strike, or cause to be striken the remna~t of those Idolaters with a bodily sword, as dyd Asael and Iehu, hauing for warrant Gods especiall commaundement therevnto: then is your figure dashed.
But whether he did this or no, you sée the iudgement of Cardinall Caietane, and we sée the examples of the Leuites, of Phinees, and the killing of Agag by Samuel.
And the like of Elias, in killing the Priests of Baal. euen in the Chapter going before.
He brought them to the brooke ison, and killed them there.
Elias (sayth Lyra) killed them by the people, that to this purpose assisted him, or perhaps he killed some of them, with his owne hande, by the zeale of Gods iustice, and so Samuel is read to haue killed Ameleck.
But vnderstanding the killing thus, bicause these especialties are not to be drawne by any ordinary exa~ple in the spiritual pastors: let vs now admit the figure of the spirituall sworde that M. San. driueth this killing vnto.
Do you know what this spiritual sworde is (M. Sand) that you speake on.
Thinke you it is to co~maund others to fight against kings, and to murther their subiects? If it be true (whiche you affirme) that none can escape it, that it pierceth the soule: they might escape this sworde by many meanes, as you say.
So that it is not the exercise of such a sword, nor the bidding of such a sworde to be exercised.
And howe chaunce then your popes do exercise it, you contende héere for it, and alleage all these examples, yet pretend (cleane co~trarie herevnto) the only spiritual sword? Whereas in very déede, ye ought to vse none other, euen as your owne Glosse saith hereon· Nocentes iustitia. &c.
The diuine iustice causeth some offenders to be punished with the edge of the sword, by kings: other it stri keth through with the tongue, by Prophets and Priests.
To punish therfore with the bodily sworde, belongeth onely to Princes their officers, and not to the Pope his Prelats.
Wherfore your Pope both lieth and vsurpeth in clayming both swords: and your selfe confute him, that say, you haue the onely spiritual sword: and also contrarie your selfe, sithe the deposition of Princes from their royall estate, belongeth to the secular, not to the spiritual sword.
Which belongeth to the spirite, is only of the soule, is suche as none can escape.
And therfore your own self co~fute your self, applying ye power of the spiritual pastors, to the deposing of princes fro~ their kingdomes.
For they may well inoughe escape your popes tyrannie, as they do (God be praised for it) better tha~ héeretofore some Princes haue done.
And as for his curses, which also he calleth his spiritual sword, béeing not only nothing like the spiritual sword that God hath appointed, but cleane contrarie thervnto: Princes shal escape them well inough: yea, God himself doth belsse them, as fast as ye pope dothe curse them.
But master Sanders, to proue that they can neuer escape thys sworde, saythe Elizeus sworde is reckoned in the laste place, and the laste he calleth héere the chiefest.
But howe agréeth this, with that he sayde before, of the firste place? There, he woulde proue the Priests authoriti chiefest, bicause he is reckoned in the first place.
And héere he would proue the Priests sworde chiefest, bicause it is reckoned in the laste place.
And if it were reckoned in the middle place then would be haue proued it also the chiefest, bicause that In medio consistit virtus, Vertue consisteth in the middle place.
And thus be the Priest, or any thing belonging to the Priest, reckoned in the first place, in the middle place, or in the last place, that is still an argument with M. Sanders, of the best and chiefest place.
But nowe to proue yet better the force of this sworde, M. Sand. procéedeth, saying: Moreouer to this spiritual sword, the other material sword obeieth, whiche also taketh punishment of him, that setteth him selfe agaynst the spirituall sworde.
For Elias by the sword of the spirite, that is, by his prayers, commaunded the fire to descende from heauen, and consume those captaines of fiftie, that despising the spirituall power of the Prophet, saide vnto him in the name of the earthly power: thou man of God, the king commaundeth thee to descende.
And agayne: thus saith the king, make haste and come downe.
For these Captaynes of fiftie trusted so well in their earthly power, that is, so well in the number of souldiors that were vnder them, as in the authoritie of the King, for whome they were sent on message, and in respect of this power, they despised that spiritual power, that Elias was endued withall, And therefore with mocking saluted him, the man of God.
But when at the worde of Elias the fire came down from heauen, and deuoured those two Captaynes, and their twice fiftie men that were with them: the thirde Captayne of fiftie beeing sent of Ochozias the king, acknowledged the sworde of Elias, and therefore commaunded not him (as the other had done) but besoughte him, and sayde: man of God, dispise not my life, and the lyues of thy seruauntes that are with me.
But what is it, that the Prophet regarded not to obey the kings commaundement, but that he him selfe in that cause was greater than the king, and that he taught, euen by the thinges them selues, the spirituall power of the Church to be greater than the earthly? For neither yet, beeing moste humbly desired of the thirde Captaine of fiftie, he came downe to the king, before the Angell of the Lorde bad him not feare, but go downe.
For he sat in the toppe of a mountaine (that is) in the chiefest place of the Church.
VVhich place the earthly king ughte rather to haue honored for Christ, whose person Elias did beare, tha~ by authoritie to commaunde, that the man of God, leauing his chaire, should come as a subiecte to the king.
For we reade also that Ambrose complayned, that he being a Bishop, stoode among them of the Consistorie.
And said vnto the Emperor: if thou haddest acknowledged me, thou wouldest not see me in this place.
Not that denie the Prophets and Pastors of the Churche to be subiects to the king, so farre as their goodes and bodies: but contende, that their power is not onely equall, but higher than the kings owne iurisdiction is, so often as the soules saluation is in hande.
For neither must we be ignorant of that, that Elias therefore would not obey Ochozias the king, but rather killed his captaynes and his souldiors, bicause the king beeing sicke asked counsell, not of the Lords Prophet, but of Beelzebub the God of Accaron.
If therefore any king fal obstinately into heresie or schisme, the Bishop and Prophet shall not onely not obey him, but also punishe him, not only denying vnto him the spiritual goods· but also in taking away his corporal goods, after a due sort and order.
But it was vnworthy for the person of Elias, for to kill with his owne handes, a hundred and two souldiors of the kinges: and therefore with his onely worde he spake, and fire came downe from heauen, that deuoured those two Captaines of fiftie with their souldiors.
Master Sanders hauing now referred this sworde of Elizeus, to the figure of the spirituall sworde: will proue both that it is aboue the kinges scular power, and also destroyeth them that resiste it.
But firste hys proues for the superioritie of thse swordes, is neyther belonging to this present purpose, nor we contende about it, but willingly graunt the stroke of the worde of God, to be the greater stroke, Elias in that case to be greater than the king also, and the spirituall power to be greater than the earthly power, and that the spirituall power may spiritually punish the resisters of it.
But that the ordinary spirituall power of the Priests or Prophets, may depose the ordinary secular power of Kings Princes: that the pastors spiritual sword, may strike the secular sworde out of the Magistrates hande, to whome it is of God committed: that the spiritual power may of his own nature punish Princes with bodily punishment, and take their state and kingdomes from them, and cause their subiects to rebel agaynst them: This we vtterly denie, and this is the very question.
Now héerto is alleahed the facte of Elias, sitting in the mount, who prayed to God that fire might consume the wicked kings messangers that derided the Prophets, and would by force haue setched him to the king.
To this answere, first, for this king, he resembleth no protestant Prince, but rather the popish Princes, who not onely beeing sicke as Ochozias was, but also in healthe, (as thoughe there were no God in Israell) séeke not to the onely liuing Lorde, to Christ the onely sauiour and mediatour, but to Idols, as Ochozias did to Eeelzebub: and woulde murther the Prophets of God, that reproue them for it, as Elias did.
Secondly, for Elias, he sat not on the toppe of the mountaine, to signifie the chiefest place of the church, which chiefest place he tooke not vpon him.
And do not your selfe ascribe the chiefest place of the Church to the highe Priest or Bishop? Or was the Prophet the~ aboue the chiefe Priest, or intruded he into the high Priests place? or were both in the chiefest place, and so your Pope claymes the chiefest place of the church from both of them? True it is, that in his time Elias was the chiefest instrument that God vsed in the rformation of the Church, yet neither tooke he vpon him the chiefest place of the Churche, nor exalted him selfe aboue the king, nor deposed him, or his father, or any other prince, howe wicked soeuer they were, nor incited other to rebell agaynst them.
And this you should proue that Elias did, or else ye stray from your question.
It is no ensample for vs to followe the like.
Neither did Elias vse it ordinarily in his defence, but vpon especiall occasion God by his iustice defended thus his Prophet, and reuenged the contumelie, wherwith they scorned not onely him, but God, in destroying those wicked deriders after suche a terrible miraculous sorte.
Not for that they were the kings ministers, but for that they assented to the kinges crueltie: and besides (béeing Idolaters) they scorned the power of God in him, in calling him in derision, The man of God.
For so sayth Lyra: Cognouit autem. &c. Elias knewe by reuelation, that in mockage he called him the man of God, and was consenting to the king in the sinne of Idolatry, and in the punishment of Elias, and likewise they that were with him, and that herevpon by the sentence of God they were to be punished: for the which cause he pronounced the diuine sentence.
So that the striker héere was God, Elias onely pronounced the sentence of Gods iustice.
Neither dyd he any thing héerein, but by the especiall motion of God.
He woulde not come downe (as master Saunders therein saythe true) no not at the moste humble entreatie of the thirde Captayne, tyll the Angell of GOD badde hym not feare, but goe downe.
Wherevpon saythe Caietane: Vide, actiones Eliae. &c. See, the actions of Elias are gouerned by the Angels direction in euery poynt, that is to saye, so well his outwarde as his inwarde motions.
Wherby we may sée that he did not this facte by any ordinarie iurisdiction of his Propheticall office, but by the especiall direction of God, whiche can not, nor oughte to be drawne into example, for other to do or wishe the like.
Fourthly, this example to follow Elias héerein, is of all other flatly forbidden to the Disciples of Christ.
For when ye Samaritanes would not receiue Christ into their Citie, Iames and Ion sayde, Lorde, wile thou that we commaunde that fire come downe from heauen, and consume them, euen as Elias did? But Iesus turned about, ad rebuked them, and sayde: ye knowe not of what spirite you are.
For the sonne of man is not come to destroy mens liues, but to saue them.
Nowe this example of the seuere iustice of God, thus desired of them, and they reproued by Christ for desiring the lyke, M. Sanders resumeth for his Bishops authoritie.
Wherby it appeareth, he knoweth not of what spirite Christian Bishops ought to be, and that Popishe Bishops are of another spirite than Christ is of.
For Christ came not to kill Princes, to fire their townes, to burne their people, and depose Kinges from their kingdomes: to whiche drifte all this is spoken.
Ergo, Christian Bishops ought to take away the corporall goodes of Hereticall and Schismatical Princes.
If the conclusion had béene thus: Ergo, they mighte pray that God would take their corporal goods away: it had béene a more likely and a more tollerable conclusion.
Howbeit this also is forbidden, to pray to haue their corporal goodes taken away.
It were their dutie rather to pray, ye they might better vse them, that God woulde either conuert them, or otherwise at his good pleasure, stoppe their tyrannie.
They ought not to pray for the taking away of any mans goodes, much lesse their Soueraignes goods, to who~ your self confesse, that they them selues are subiect, farre as their goods and bodies.
And then be they not ouer the goodes and bodies of their Princes, béeing their subiectes, least of all ought they, either by the~selues or by any other, to take their Princes goods and bodies from them: For that is not a subiects but a traitors and a rebels part.
But saith M. Saunders they may take his bodily goods from their King so they doe it, debito modo ordine, after a due maner and order.
He told vs thus before, but it is cleane beyond all good maer, against al due order, to take away any mannes goods, chiefely the Princes, yea and that the Bishops or priests to do it.
The example of S. Ambrose, complaining that ye Emperor missed him, is cleane against M. Saund that alleageth it for him.
For S. Ambrose tooke not the Emperors goods away, nor deposed him, nor caused other to rebell against him: but for all the Emperors missusage of him, he continued stil in his obedience to the Emperor.
Howbeit he told the Emperor of his dutie, and so should al godly Bishops do, and not attempte to depose their Princes, nor to stirre vp other to depose them.
Let vs now put the case (saith M. Sau~ders) that some man which was a Prince was present with Elias, who hauing receiued the power of the sword, would haue offred himself to vse it for Elias.
Or else let vs put the case, that it is said of Elias vnto him: bycause these souldiors contemne me, and in me God, whose prophete am: rushe thou on them and kill them.
Had now that Prince sinned, if at the word of Elias, he had killed the Kings subiectes? eyther else coulde not an earthly sword haue performed the same thing, that the ministerie of fire did yelde from heauen? Truly with wyse men it makes no matter, what is done of those things, that are of the same waight and moment.
If fire be the more noble element than earthe, yea, or those metals that are digged oute of the earth: see not but that he, who called fyre downe from heauen, which shoulde satisfie his commaundement, muche more coulde haue spoken to a Magistrate bearing the sword, that he should pull out and drawe that sword for him against any King.
Whatsoeuer you see not (Maister Saunders) you make all the world to see that you be of a viperous generation and adders broode, that cannot créepe forward by lying straight, but wynding and crooking in and oute, hether and thether.
Sée howe you sill séeke shiftes whereby to procéede, when by the directe Scripture your cause will not goe forward.
Put case the scripture had sayde thus: Put case Elias had done this: Put case another had done that.
What a warbling is this? If you will alleage the Scripture, take the Scripture directly as it lyes.
Put no more cases to the Scripture, than the Scripture puttes.
Are you wyser than God, or not as false as the olde Serpent, that in tempting Eue, altered the wordes of God? But this argueth, that the Scripture it self fitteth not your turne, except you may turne and alter it as you will.
You pretende it is no matter wyth wise men what is done of those things, that are of the same waight and moment.
As whether these men were kylled by the fire or by the sword, sith they were killed.
But are these punishmentes all one (Maister Saunders) to haue bene striken with the sworde of a man, and to be consumed with fire from God? in déede as you saye, here is death in both, which is the same thing: but are their kindes of death, and punishmentes, of the same waight and moment? When the foure Kings slewe the Sodomites, and when God raigned downe ire and brimstone from heauen to say the Sodomites: when Saul (as Maister Saunders sayde before) killed the Priests, and when God kylled the Priests with fire from heauen: is here nothing in these deathes, but the difference of the more noble element? Surely it séemeth Maister Saunders you haue bene so long in Rome, that you are become Inglese Italia nato, so worldly wyse, that you haue no feare of Gods vengeance, that thus measure it by mannes punishment.
There is a great difference (Maister Saunders) in the waight and moment of these punishmentes, not onely to shewe the heauier wrathe of God, but also to shewe, that althoughe Elias desired it, on suche specialties as is aforesayde: yet the punishment was onely from God, not from Elias, he had not the fire at his commaundemente, but God sento the fire vpon them, which maketh another greater difference of the case, besides other sundry differences, that cleane do alter it.
For it is not likely that Elias woulde euer haue set another Prince, vpon his owne Princes subiectes, or styrre anye rebellion against his Prince, howe sharpely soeuer he rebuked him for hys sinnes.
He neither spared King Achab, nor Quéene Iesabell, nor their sonne Qchozias, but boldly reproued them.
But as for deposing them or mouing other Princes to depose them, or to kill either them or their people: he neuer dyd it, nor euer shewed anye tken of lyking suche doyng, and therefore we oughte not to presuppose any such thing of him.
These things he did, he killed the Priess of Baal, eyther by his bydding them to be killed, or as Lyra sayth, propriamanu, he kylled some of them with his owne hande.
And here he besoughte God take this vengeance on these wicked souldiers, and this he dyd by the stincte of God.
The other, that you put the case for, we finde no suche dede, nor haue any such warrant, and without such warrant from God, they should sauor of treason to the Prince, and so make a great alteration of the case, to serue your purpose, and wreste the Scripture, and therefore are not to be admitted.
Princes of this world see not the power of this spirituall sworde, notwithstanding if at the prayer of Elizeus, God vouchsafe to open their eyes· they shal see moe armies with the B. tha~ with any Emperor.
For behold the mountaine full of horses of firie charets round aboute Elizeus.
But when the King of Israel seeyng the greatnesse of the faine, sware that the heade of Elizeus shoulde not stande vpon him that daye: Elizeus that knewe this othe of the King to be vnlawfull, foreseyng in the spirite, the messenger to be at hande, that shoulde execute the Kings commaundement: he sayde vnto the elders that were with him, knowe ye not how this murtherers sonne hath sent to take away mine heade: take hede therfore, when the messenger co~meth, shut the dore, and set him not enter.
Yea Sanctes Pagninus so expoundes these later woordes, oppresse him in the dore.
By which wordes, not onely the shutting out of the Kings messenger is signified, but also a certayne violence done vnto him.
All which haue broughte to this ende, that mighte shewe that the pastors of the Churche, haue power not onely ouer the soules of the faythfull, but also ouer their bodyes and goods, so often as the soules health maye be promoted thereby.
For we know also, that two beares comming out of the woode, dyd eare in peeces ortie and two of those Children that mocked Elizeus.
VVhereby also is declared, that all the creatures of God aryse, to reuenge their iniuries, whome God hath adorned with spirituall power.
And truely when good Kings wanted, that woulde reuenge the contumely done to the pastors of the Churche, the element of fire and the wilde beasts toke that care on them.
We had before, the example of Elias, and then of Elizeus, and then againe of Elias, and nowe agayne of Elizeus.
The first, that Elizeus had greater power to defende hym, than the Kyng of Syria to oppugne hym.
The seconde, when the Kyng of Israell sente to kill him, he caused the messenger violentlye to be kept oute of the dore.
The thirde, when the children of Bethel mocked him, he cursed them, and straight wild beares destroyed them.
To the first answere, it is impertinent to ye purpose of deposing Princes, or seazing on their te~porall goods kingdomes, or causing their subiectes to reuolte from their obedience.
Elizeus did none of these thinges, neither can this defence of Elizeus without racking, be drawne hereto.
But M. Sand. aith, he bringeth it to this ende, to shevve that the Pastors of the Churche haue povver, not onely ouer the soules of the faithfull, but also ouer their goods bodies.
If you bring it to this ende, M. Sand. then as you bring it about the bushe, and not directly to the question in hande: so here youfoully ouer shoot your selfe.
For this Prince was not a faithfull, but an Infidell Prince, and the enimie of the Prince of Israell.
And therefore inuading with open hostilitie the Princes dominion of Israell: it was lawfull for any Israelite, to do the worste he could to destroye the Syrians armie.
Howbeit, Elizeus gathered no power, nor vseth any worldly violence against this foraine Princes armie, as the Pope doth against foraine Princes, to come vpo~ them with horsses and charets, and with a mightie armie, like to this infidell Prince of Syria, to besiege Christian Princes and the true Israelites, and to destroy the Prophetes of Iesus Christ, that giue Christian Princes warning of the Popish practises.
So that if a figure may be drawne from this historie, to our times: the Pope more resembleth Benedab, than Elizeus.
As for Elizeus, gathered no worldly power, but with stedfast confidence commended himselfe to God, and God protecte him with Millions of Angels.
He had power indéede to defends him, and moe Armies than hath any Emperor, as M. Saunders aith.
But this power was spirituall, and not such as the Pope exerciseth ouer Princes.
Woulde the Pope séeke other power than Elizeus did: then might you M. Sanders put vp your pipes, this controuersie were at an ende, for deposing Princes.
No, M. Saunders, all Princessée, yea, euen those that are blinded with affection towardes him, do sée, that he séeketh hath such power, as Benadab had, and greater worldly power also.
For the maintenance whereof, you here do contende by wryting, as fast as he contends by fighting.
But this was not the power of Elizeus If you will sée a platforme of Elizeus power, looke vpo~ the poore Ministers of the gospel, inuironed round about with your popish armies, horses, charets, in so much that the poore simple man, cryeth out as Elizeus seruant did: Alas master hovve shall vve doe? the Popishe Benadab hath besieged the poore Protestantes with such mightie arues, that all the world would haue thought ere this, they should haue ben cleane swallowed vp.
But God be blessed, poore Elizeus hath moe armies· the poore preachers of the Gospell haue moe Legions of Angels, and moe spirituall fyrie charts and horsmen to assist them, against al that assault them, than that yet they coulde euer preuaile, but are (as was the hoste of Benadab, striken more and more with blindnesse.
For they not blinded, they must néeds sée this mightie worke of God, that all whose eyes God hath opened, doe beholde, and glorifie God, and feare not any more the hoste of this Benadab, for they that be vvith vs are moe, than they that be vvith them.
But sée howe this Captaine of Benadab that is blind himself, wolo so blind vs with him, yt he would make vs beléeue, that euen Benadab himself were Elizeus.
But doth the Pope vse his captiues as Elizeus did, who suffered not them to be killed nor spoyled, but comforted and refreshed them, set them againe at libertie? No, M. Sand. we are not so blind, but we al the world doth sée, that as ye Pope fights with other man of armies, than did Elizeus: so he vseth to his captiues no such mercie, but more tygerly crueltie, than we should finde at the Turks hands, than the Turkes found at ye hands of Tamerlanes the Scithian, tha~ is to be found among the Canibals, that roast men on a spit being killed before, and not rye them at a stake aliue: yea, than a man shal finde among the Sauage Beares and Lyons that woulde quickly deuoure him.
Suche dispyte hath the Pope shewed euen to his owne Cardinalles, where Elizeus shewed this goodnesse to his enimies.
And when he had them in his frée choyce to haue kylled them, he let them goe frée.
Whereas the Pope to kill his being frée, hath violated all safecondui, and broken all othes, bends, promises, faith and honestie.
And is the Pope yet like Elizeus? But how holds this argument? Elizeus had more povver than the hoste of the Syrians: Ergo, Byshoppes haue power to depose Princes.
The second thing that M. Sand· noteth in Elizeus, is the excluding of King Iorams Messanger, that was scute to cut off his head.
This factdrawes somewhat nearer to the purpose in respect of the King, for he was the King of Israel, to whom Elizeus was a subiect: but this again is as far from the purpose, in respecte of the Kings crueltie and Idolatrie, wherein Ioram figureth Popish, not Protestant Princes.
But in respect stl of the present co~trouersie, it is nothing to ye purpose at al for the kings deposing.
For how foloweth this? He bad them kepe the Kings seruant out, that vvould haue come to cut off his head: Ergo, he bad them depose the King from his royal estate.
And here M. Sanders vrgeth the force of Elizeus words.
Sanctes Pagninus (saith he) translateth thus these later words, oppresse him in the dore.
In vvhich vvordes is not only signified, a shutting out of the Kings Messanger, but also a kinde of violence done vnto him.
You néede not run to Pag M. Sanders, our translations confesse as much: premite eum in ostio, reprimite illum in ostio, presse him in the dore, or rather represse him, than oppresse him.
For oppressing draweth nearer to the murthering of him, which was farre from Elizeus meaning, and is nearer to the Popish violence.
But the plaine meaning is, kepe him out of the dores, as ye co~mn translation hath it.
Neither is it material, though he were shut out before he came, or thronging in before y^ were ul shut, he were violently thrust out again.
For this was not done of the~ to resist ye ings authoritie, nor to be done of him shew that he had such powero his goods bodie, yt he might take his goods or his life fro him: but this that was here done, was to preserue himselfe being the Prophete of God, from the Kings vniust violence, and from the hastie furie of the cruell murtherer, whome the King sent to kill him, without all lawe, iustice, or reason, onely vpon the suddain passion of his outrage.
As for the Prophete, he had especiall warrant by Gods especial reucaling, so to bidde them, and therefore the Prophete bid nothing amisse herein.
Yea, he knewe well inough, that althoughe he resisted the Kings messanger, yet he resisted not the King, but euen therein obeyed the King, and did that he would haue had him to do.
For the King immediatly repenting him of his wicked othe and hastie crueltie, came himself (as it séemeth by the text) in all hast after the Messanger, to stay his hande, and to let the Prophet of God alone, acknowledging his offence, and that his punishment was euen the hande of God.
Nowe Elizeus (by reuelation) knowing of all this: what did he in bidding them resiste the Messanger, but euen obey the Kings will? and therefore when he had them kéepe him out, or offer him violence, if ye will néedes so expounde it: he sayth withall, is not the sounde of his masters féete behinde him? and this was the verie cause why he bad them do so.
Let him enter, cuius causa subditur. &c. (saith Lyra) the cause vvhereof is annexed, for beholde the sounde of his Masters feete is after him, for after the departure of the Messanger, Ioram repented, and therefore he followed him to reuoke the precept.
And faith Caitane, That they should boldly resist the Kings messanger, he foretelleth the~, that the King follovved his Messanger, repenting that hee sent him.
And therefore the King follovved the Messanger, bycause he repented that he had commaunded, that Elizeus head shoulde be cut off, for he came to himself againe, and came personally to moue his complaint before Elizeus.
Nowe all this that should haue lightned the master, M. Sand· concealeth, and cuts off this sentence of Elizeus in the middle, taking no further thereof, than he thought he might wreste to séeme to serue his purpose, after such maner as the Deuill cited scripture against Christ.
Whereas the whole sentence set down, and the storye considered, it maketh cleane against him.
Neuerthelesse had Elizeus, on the especiall will and reuealing of God, done otherwise, it had made nothing for him.
The thirde example of Elizeus, maketh least of all to the purpose.
Bycause Elizeus cursed the children that scorned him, and they by Gods iust vengeaunce, were destroyed by Beares: that therfore he euer attempted to depose the King, or sollicited his subiectes to rebel against him.
And yet that whiche Elizeus there did, doing it in the name of the Lorde, and by reuelation of the Lorde, pronouncing the sentence of Gods iustice vpon them (as Lyra saith) can no more be leuelled to an ordinarie rule, than the fire that came downe at the petition of Elias.
Neither dothe the Popish glosse, or Lyra gather thereon, that Byshops might cause their Princes subiectes to be destroyed that mocke them: but they make this a figure of Christe.
In expounding this mystically, Elizeus going vp to Bethell, signifieth Iesus Christe ascending to his Crosse, vvhome the levves mocked, according to the texte of the Gospell.
For the vengeance vvhereof, tvvo Beares came aftervvarde into Iurie, to vvit, Titus and Vespasian, and killed the people fortie yeres after the passion of the Lorde, for reuenge of the contuelie done vnto him.
This figure your owne commentaries make hereon But haue not read, that any maketh it serue for Byshops to depose Princes, but for Princes to depose wicked Byshoppes, that crucifie Christe in his members, and deride the simplicitie of the Gospel.
Who rather than they should remaine vnpunished, God will styrre vp heathen Princes to punishe the~, as he did these Beares, and flashe downe fyre from heauen to destroye al those Priestes, that offer strange fyre to God: and will styrre vp all his creatures, to reuenge the iniuries done to his Saints Ministers, vvhere good Princes want, (as you say) that should reuenge the same.
But then freuible you, ye cruel papists, yt haue done so many outrages to Gods Ministers, and haue shed so much blood of his Saintes, that ye shall neuer flée Gods héauie ve~geance, howsoeuer good kings do vvant.
Though you abuse Kings to be executioners of your cruelties, whose duetie (by your owne confession) were to punish such iniuries.
Whiche if they woulde better looke vnto, and put in practise, they should so litle feare your deposings of them, that they would depose euery one of you.
And thus, as all your examples make nothing for you, so euery one of them maketh so muche againste you, that it séeineth as these Syrians were so blinded, that séeking to take Elizeus, they were ledde they wist not whither, euen into Samaria, and were themselues taken of their enimies: so you seeking to take the Ministers of God, to take ye Christian Princes power from him, to bring all to your holy father Benadab, are so blynded in framing your arguments, yt you blunder on such examples, as still make cleane against you.
But novve after the acceptable time is come, vvherein are many Christian Kings, of vvhom some alvvays obey the Vicars of Christe: there is novve no neede of myracles, or of the ministerie of creatures vvanting reason, sithe there vvante not faithfull Princes, vvhich may performe and execute this.
For sith Zacharie the Prophete of God hath foretolde, that so great a fountain of grace should be opened to al, after the co~ming of Christ, that eue~ ones father mother should thrust him through, vvhom they should vnderstand to speake a lye: hovv muche more at this day, shal there not vvant those, that shall not suffer him to liue, vvhom they shall perceiue, that he vvill not obey the high Priests co~mandement.
For the power of the Ministers of Christ is so much higher, than the povver of the Priests of the Leuitical kind, by how much difference, Iustice, Spirit, life, that we minister, excel da~natio~, the letter, deth, which things the leuitical priests by occasio~ ministred.
If there wanted Christian Kings and faithful Princes the~, and yet the Prophets then deposed not the wicked Princes, nor set vp new Princes, but rather, co~mitted the vengeance to God, that punished Idolaters, by the ministerie of creatures vvanting reason, vvhere there vvanted faithfull Princes to do it: with what face can you (M. Sanders) alledge these examples, for the Pastors deposing of Kings? whiche are so flat arguments against it, that where Christian Kings, and faithfull Princes vvant, to punishe Idolaters and deriders of Gods Ministers, there Christian Pastors should commit the vengeance to God, rather tha~ atte~pt to depose those vnfaithfull Princes, which no faithfull Prophete did.
But now (say you) are many Christia~ Princes, of vvho~ some alwayes obey the Vicar of Christe.
Whether the Pop be Christes, or Sathans Uicar, is an other questio~, M. Sano.
Whether any Christian Kings obey him, is somwhat nearer to the purpose, although not directly to the question here in hande.
But if this be true, that there are many Christian Kings, of whome some alwayes obey the Pope: then are there also many Christian King, of whome some neuer obeye the Pope.
And if they maye be Christian Kings; that neuer obey the Pope, as were the Emperors of Greece, the Christian Kings in Asia, Affrica, and the Northeast partes of Europe, that neuer obeyed him, and yet are Christian Kings: then is not the obedience of the Pope necessarie to christianitie, else, not some, but al Christian kings obey him, he yt obeyed him not, were no Christian King.
But novv (say you) there is no neede of myracles.
Then (say I) there is no need of such examples.
But if you deny the need of myracles, why doth your Churche pleade vpon them, abuse the world so much by them? what? be you become a Bogomile M. Sant? nay then, wilturne you lose to M. Stapl.
But why wil you not stand on myracles now? Nowe (say you) want not faithful Princes, whiche may performe and execute all this.
Then (say I) faithfull Princes haue authoritie to destroy false Pastors, and not false Pastors, no nor true Pastors, to destroy neyther faythfull, nor yet vnfaythfull Princes.
You cite the Prophecie of Zacharie, That so great a fou~taine of grace shoulde be open to all, after the comming of Christe, that euen ones father and mother should thrust him through, vvhome they should vnderstande to speake a lye. Tru, M. Saunders, suche a prophecie there is in déede.
But had your selfe not bene giltie in your conscience, to haue bene one of these lyers that the Prophete speaketh of, you would not thus haue snatched at the sentence, here and ther a piece, like the Egiptian Dogge that M. Stapleton telleth vs of, drinking in Nilus ryuer, and dare not drinke a full draught, for feare he be caught by the lyppes.
And so woulde you be caught by those lying lippes of yours, if you hadde so fully set downe the prophecie, that the Reader might haue perceiued who the lier is.
The wordes are these: In that day there shall be a fountaine opened to the house of Dauid, and to the inhabitants of Hierusalem, for sinne, and for vncleannesse.
And in that daye, saith the Lord of Hostes, vvill cut off the names of the Idols out of the land, they shall no more be remembred.
And vvil cause the Prophetes and the vncleane spirites to depart out of the lande.
And vvhen any shall yet prophecie, his father and his mother that begat him, shall say vnto him, thou shalt not liue, for thou speakest lies in the name of the Lorde.
And his father and his mother that begat him, shall thrust him through, vvhen he prophecieth, and in that daye shal the Prophetes be ashamed euery one of his vision, when he hath prophecied.
Neither shall they weare a rough garment to deceiue, but he shal say, am no Prophet, am a husbandman.
For man taught me to be an herdman, from my youth vp.
And one shall say vnto him, vvhat are these vvoundes in thy handes? then shall he ansvvere, thus vvas vvounded in the house of my friendes.
By this sentence it appeareth, that by this lier, is not ment a Prince, but a false Prophete.
Whereby you can not infer the present question, that Priestes may punishe Princes, but ye contrary, yt Princes may punish priests, may wel be inferred theron.
For by ye fathers mothers thrusting through, is not ment priuate punishment, eche one to kil another, nor yt his thrusting through belongeth to the Priests, who take vpon the~ to be the Prophets themselues, to whose calling killing belo~geth not, but it appertaineth to Kings Quéens, to ciuil Princes Magistrats, that are the fathers mothers.
of gods people, whom of right (as hauing the sword from God) the punishment of false Prophets appertaineth.
But who be these false prophets (M. Saunders) that the Prince shall punishe? First, all they which denie that fountayne of grace, to be the only washing away of sinne and vncleannesse.
Whether your Pope, your Prelats, and you, seke not other things, besides this fountain of grace, for the washing awaye of sin vncleannesse: all the world knoweth, and your owne practise confessions (as is before proued to M. Stapleton) charge you therwith.
Secondly, these false prophets are those that mainteine Idolatrie: which whether the popishe Priests maintaine or no, as it is so apparant, that no figge lease can hyde it, so we haue harde your owne testimonies openly co~fesse it.
Thirdly, the false prophets are they, that teach lyes in the name of the Lorde, which what is it else, but to teache other doctrines, as necessarie to saluation, than Christ and his Apostles taught, their owne traditions and constitutions in the steade of the worde of God.
Howe this also toucheth the Popishe pastors, besides the apparance therof, we haue hard alreadie their owne witnesse.
Fourthly, these false Prophetes were such, that for their blinde, and grosse ignorance they were more fitte to goe to carte than to schole, to holde the plowe than to holde the place of a pastor, suche blinde guides leadyng the blynde, that a Childe scarce seuen yeere olde, can giue more readily a better aunswere of the Christian fayth, than many a Popishe Priest, yea than some Doctors in diuinitie, of twentie yeares continnance coulde haue done.
Fiftly, these false Prophetes were such hipocrits as with counterfeit austeritie with sacke hearecloth, with linsywooie, with long graue disguised prescribed rough garments, haue borne to the simples eyes the counseance of holy fathers and onely religious men.
These (M. Saunders) these are the lyers, these are ye false prophets, that the true Prophet Zatharie here describeth, foretelleth of their destruction: How the fountaine of grace should be opened that you had stopped: howe the death of Christ, not such meanes as you had deuised, should wash away all sinnes and vncleanneste: how your Idolacrie should be pulled downe, the very names of your Idols become odious: How your lyes forgeries should be espied: howe Princes should punishe you eue~ to death: how you should be so athamed of your lyes trumperies, that you should cast of your cowles hyde your markes for shame, say you were neuer Priests, Monkes, nor Friers, but husbandmen· All which how it hath come to passe, all the worlde séeth, and many of your owne side haue confessed, and be ashamed, and cry God mercie, and haue forsaken their superstitious prelaties, and haue chosen rather to liue like husbandmen, than to deceiue the people and abuse gods name with lies any longer.
And if this prophecie haue not wrought this effect in you, but that you remaine yet a shamelesse lying Prophet, and would obstinately naintaine these things: it is a shrewd token you be giuen vp to a reprobate sense, are blynded by gods righteous Iustice, for refusing his mercie, and that godly Princes should runne you through, and execute the seueritie of gods iustice vpon you.
Now all this that detected you to be these lying prophets, and that shewed the Princes authoritie and office to punishe you, as you steightly passe it ouer, so you wreste it cleane to another purpose, as though they shuld be runne through that would not obey the Pope.
For so you apply it, saying: How much more shall there not want at this day, that will not suffer him to liue, whom they shall perceiue will not obey the commaundement of the highest Priest.
And as you put this in distinct letters, so you quote for it, Deut.
This place is often alleaged, and answered alreadie vnto in M. Stapleton, and is so shamefully wrested here by you, that if there were no other argument, euen the wresting of this propheie would argue you to be one of these lying prophetes, that should be runne through for abusing the worde of God.
As thoughe that lawe tooke yet place among vs, that was appointed for that time to the Iewes: or as though those matters betwéene blood and blood, plea and plea, plague and plague, in causes of controuersie among the Iewes, were matters of Religio~ then, or are to be stretched to all matters of faith now: or as though those matters were determined by the onely high priest then, and not by the iudge and Ciuil Magistrate, asking counsel of the Priests, and giuing iudgement by his owne authoritie, make not rather for the obedience to the Ciuill Magistrates, than to the obedience of the Priests: or as though Zacharie prophecying of the state after ye comming of Christ, did meane there should be one chief B. besides Christ, whose commaundement all Princes, all Bishops, al people in Christendome should obey, or else they should be thrust through and killed.
In déede (M. Saunders) Zacharie speaketh a little before of a pastor that shuld come which liuelie discribeth your Pope.
And the Lord (saith Zacharie) said vnto me, take yet vnto thee, the instrument of a foolishe shepherd.
For loe will rayse vp a shepherd in the lande, which shall not looke for the thing that is lost, nor seke the te~der la~bes, nor heale that that is hurt, nor feed that that standeth.
But he shall eate the flesh of the fat, and teare their clawes· in pieces.
Idoll shepherde, that leaueth the flocke, the sworde shall be vpon his arme, and vpon his right eye, his arme shal be cleane dried vp, and his right eye shal be vtterly darkned.
Who exerciseth this tirannie ouer all the people and the Princes too, eating them to the bones yea bones and all, deposing them, destroying them, and pilling their kingdomes with insatiable extorsions, but the Pope· the Popishe glosses ascribe it to Antichrist, but they describe the Popes practises.
pastor in the land, (saith Lyra·) that is, Antichrist to rule therein: that shall not visite the forsaken, that is, he shall do no worke of Godlynesse, but shalbe of greatest crueltie towarde the iust, and therefore he saith: and shall eate the fleshe of the fae, that is, by spoyling of their goods: and teare their clawes, by afflicting and killing them.
Againe what Pastor may better be called in Idol than this Antichrist the Pope? That is called an Idol (saith Lyra) that is worshipped for God, and is not God.
And so shall it be of Antichrist, that shall sitte in the Temple of God, as though he were God.
Pastor and Idol (saith the Glosse) thou arte so wicked, that thou shalt not be called a worshipper of Idols, but shalt be called an Idol, while thou wilt be worshipped of men.
VVho leauest the flock to be denoured of beastes, that the Lorde had alwayes kepte.
This pastor shall therfore arise in Israel, bicause the true pastor had said, will not feede you.
This pastor by another name is called, the abhominatio~ of desolation, that shall sit in the te~ple of God, as though he were God.
Therefore the sworde of the Lord shalbe vpo~ his right arme, and vpo~ his right eye, that the force of him al the boasting of his might, might be dried vp withered away, the knowledge that vnder a false name, he promised to himself, shalbe obsenred with eternall darkenesse.
Here it is apparant, that Zacharie ment your high B. the Pope, but he so little threatneth the~ that obey him not, that he curseth him all the~ that obey him, threatneth the vengeance of God vpon him, to pull downe his tirannie, and to blind him.
But thinke (M. Sand.) that your right eye was blinded also, that sawe not this, or else you blinked at it, and would not sée it.
For this would haue tolde you another maner of matter, than that be should be killed, that obeyed not the Popes commanding and would, hau made you afrayd, least this killing should light both vpon him and you.
But you go on and tell vs, that the authoritie of the ministers of Christe, is so muche greater than the Priestes of the Leuiticall kinde, howe muche iustice, peace, and life, that we do minister, is better than damnation, the letter, and deathe, that the Leuiticall Priests ministred by occasion.
That the authoritie of Christes ministers is greater, we graunte, in suche things as belonge to their ministerie, that are Christes ministers.
But whether it be greater in outwarde glorie, is another matter.
But be it great or lesse, where you thrust your selfe in the number, and say, that we do minister, you are but an intruder, M. Sand.
For neither you, nor any popishe Priestes, are any of Christes ministers, as is already proued, euen by your owne laste allegation out of Zacharie.
And if the ministration of iustice, the spirite and life, be the triall: your contentio~n is héere for sedition and rebellion, contrarie to iustice: for a worldly glory and earthly kingdome, contrarie to the spirite: for deposing, killing and thrusting throughe of all those that wil not obey your Pope, contrarie to life.
And so is your ministration worsse, than the ministration of the Leuiticall Priestes, who (you say) ministred these thinge not of purpose, but by occasion, but you séeke of purpose all occasion, thut you can finde, or snatche at and wrest, to minister matter for the deposing of Princes, for the rebellion of subiects, the murther of all estates, onely to mayntayne the pride and tyrannie of your Pope, aboue all Christian kings kingdomes.
Nowe that none of all these examples and testimonies will fadge no better, we shall haue once agayne the example of Ozias.
And yet (sayth M. Sand. in the Leuiticall Priesthood such heigth of the Ecclesiasticall power is figured, that euen then also we may see, that kings were compelled of Priests, wherby they gaue vp their Magistracie.
For when Ozias was waxen strong, his heart was lifte vp to his destruction, and he neglected the Lorde his God, and entring into the temple of the Lord, he would burne incense vpon the altar of Incense.
The~ Azarias the Bishop, and other Priests that were strong men, entring after him, resisted the king.
And when he notwithstanding, holding the Censor in· his hande, threatned the Priests: straightway a leprie sprang in his forehead, whiche the Priests beholding, they quickly expelled him.
VVhat followed therfore? Ozias dwelte in a house aparte, beeing full of leprie· for the which he was cast out of the house of the Lord.
Moreouer Ioatham his sonne gouerned the house of the king, and iudged the people of the Lorde.
VVho seeth not the bodily casting foorthe of the king oute of the house of the Lorde, clerely to expresse that ecclesiasticall power, whereby kings taking vpon them the offices of Priests, maye be caste out of the kingdome of heauen, by the excommunication of the highest Bishop.
Moreouer, if bicause the king was made a Leper, the administration of the kings house, and the gouernment of all the people, was deuolued vnto the kinges sonne: howe muche more the infection of heresie, which (as S. Augustine saythe) is signified by the leprie, ought to bring to passe, that a Prince beeing driuen to the state of a priuate life, maye be compelled to leaue his house voyde vnto hys successor.
This storie of king Ozias, as it is already cited by M. Stapleton, and was not before forgotten of M. Sanders, so héere and in diuers other places it is recited.
Neither is there any one Popishe writer on this question of Supremacie, but he alleageth this exa~ple.
And as they thus often alleage it, so is it often by vs answered, and in déede it is casie to be answered, for it is not to the purpose, and but their malicious slaunder, to burden the Protestant Princes with it, who take not vpon them to do the offices, belonging to the Bishops and Ministers of Gods word and Sacramentes, as héere Ozias attempted to do.
If you can name any suche Prince, and such things, name them hardly, M. Sand, but proue it withal, else you are but a slaunderer of those that be in authoritie.
But here M. Sand. applies this exa~ple to this, that the highest Bishop may excommunicate such a Prince, and cast him out of heauen.
Whether your Pope be the highest Bishop, or no, is still another question.
But this is out of questio~ (M. Sand.) that he is alwayes more ready to cast a Prince ot of heauen, tha~ to bring him into heauen, and to caste him out of his kingdome too, than to let him enioy it, especially if he deale with him, although he do not as Ozias did, but do the dutie of a godly Christian king.
But who denieth this (M. Sand.) that a godly Bishop may vpon great vrgent occasion, if it shall be necessarie to edifie Gods Church, and there be no other remedie, to flée to this last censure of exco~municatio~ against a wicked king? although you can not inferre any suche necessarie conclusion vpon the allegorie of this example.
But what is this for the expelling him out of his kingdome· and for deposing him from his estate? Can you proue that Azarias and his Priests did handle Ozias thus? For this is the present question, but this you can not finde they dyd, and therfore this example serueth not your purpose.
Well, say you, they vsed a bodily casting out of the king, out of the house of the Lorde.
Trow you (M. Sand.) they tooke him by the héeles, cast him out, or by the head and the shoulders· thrust him out? trow not, that they layde any violent hands vpon him.
They withstoode him, but it followeth how, they saide vnto him, It pertayneth not to thee to burne ince~se vnto the Lord, but to the priests, the sons of Aaron, that are co~secrated to offer incense.
Go foorth of the Sa~ctuary, for thou hast tra~sgressed, thou shalt haue no honor of the Lord God.
This was no resista~ce (M. San.) to blam him for his wickednesse: whe~ he regarded not their sayings, but was wroth wt the~, was eue~ ready to offer the incense, God stroke him wt ye leprie.
So yt it appeareth they laid no viole~t hands on him, but rebuked him, yet in his fury he had done it, had not God him self with his sodayn vengeance stopped him.
If they had béene so disposed (béeing forty valiant men, besides the highe Priest) they might haue wroong the Censor out of his hande, and might haue pulled off the Priestly garments from his backe (for so Iosephus telleth how he came into the Temple) howbeit they resisted him not in suche violent rte.
But say you, when they espied God had once striken him with the leprie, then quickly they thrust him out.
But not with violence (M. Sanders) Non explicatur expulsio, &c. (saythe your Cardinall of Caieta) thrusting him out is not expressed, but the Priests, when they sawe the Leprie, warned the leprous king to go foorth.
Neither néeded he then any great warning, Sed ipse, &c.
For the king himselfe beeing terrified, made haste to get out, bicause he felte foorth with the stroke of the Lorde, so that he was not only moued of the priests, but also moued of him selfe, féeling the of God, to go out of the Temple.
What great violence was here done of the Priests to the King, except their rebuking or warning of him, either before his presumptuous attempt, or after? Did they strike him? No, God stroke him, M. Sanders, and not the Priests, for all they were so many tall fellowes, and had mighte inough to haue striken him.
If your Pope therefore and his Prelates will take this Bishop and his Priests for their example, they muste be (as S. Paule sayth) no strikers, nor fighters, chiefly not not agaynst their Princes: they must be mightie, but not in blowes, but potentes sermone, mightie in the word, to reproue the wickednesse of Princes, and so resist them, as S. Paule sayth, he resisted Peter to his face, not that he buffeted or pmeld him with his fiste aboute the face, as Bishop Boner did his prisoners.
But he resisted him, in spéeche reprehending him, and with such resistance these Priests resisted the king· and all Bishops may and ought to resist all wycked princes: but this is farre from deposing them, or sollicitng other Princes to make warre vpon them, or mouing their subiects to rebell agaynst them.
The king beeing a eper, dwelt in a house apart, til the day of his death, and his sonne gouerned the kings house, and iudged the people of the lande.
What is this (M. Sand) to the Priests deposing of him, that he dwelt aparte? For, beeing a Leper, God in his lawe had so appoynted Leuit.
Neyther dyd the contagion of his disease suffer the administration of his office.
Howbeit neither for his offence, nor for his punishme~t therof, was he deposed fro~ his kingdom, his sonne made king but ye sonne as his fathers deputie· administred ye affaires of his fathers kingdome, so, for al this Ozias continued king euen til the day of his naturall deathe, whiche was a longer time (if your Glosse be true, after this fact, than he had beene king before this fact co~mitted· For (saith your owne glosse) Volunt Hebraei. &c.
The Hebrues will haue it, that this haped in the
But whether this computation be true, or no, it playnly appeareth that he continued king still, and was buried as a king and his sonne began not to raygne til his father were dead.
Which argueth, that for all this haynous facte, which God so maruellously and dreadfully reuenged insomuche that Iosephus Co~mestor, the Glosse, Lyra, and diuers other say, that the terrible earthquake, mentioned in Amos
was done at that present instant, when God stroke the king for attempting this deede) not withstanding he retayned stil his estate, though he could not, for his sicknesse himselfe the office.
So little did God suffer the Priests, or any other to depose hm, howsoeuer the king deserued it, or rather a worsse punishment.
Thus this exa~ple of Ozias, that is so often alleaged, so much triu~phed vpon, as it is meer slanderous so maketh it nothing for the Papists, but cleane co~fues them, playng argueth, that howe feruently soeuer the Ministers of Christe may reproue and rebuke a wicked Prince for his offences, yet be his offences neuer so great, the Bishop hathe no suche authoritie that he may depose his Prince, but muste commit the punishment vnto God.
But nowe of this example of Ozias leprie, we shall haue another argument.
And as Lepers should be discerned of the Priests, whether they be whole or infected: so the iudging of heresie, pertayneth to the onely Priests of God.
Therefore by the manifest testimonie of diuine scripture, it is euicted that an heretike king both may be, and ought to be deposed, least he infect all his subiects, with that kinde of disease.
For he can not seeme to haue his common senses, that will thinke this to be yelded to the infection of the minde, that he graunteth is to be denied to the infection of the body.
Of the corporall leprie it is thus written: whosoeuer shall be infected with any leprie, is seuered at the will of the Priest, all the time that he is a leper and vncleane, he shall dwell alone without the tentes.
All which things, sithe they hapned to the Iewes in a figure, but are written to vs for our learning: the matter must thus be taken, that the cohabitation of them with the faithfull, must be denied to be permitted, that bring strange doctrine, straked as it were with spottes of leprie into the Church.
Nowe if neyther priuate men alone, but also kings were bounde by thys lawe (as the holy scripture testifieth of king Ozias) truely kings also beeing spotted with hereticall wickednesse, are by the iudgement of the Priests, to be driuen bothe from the vse and administration of the kingly power.
The former argument of example, is now drawn to another of a similitude, the leprie béeing compared vnto heresie.
To this argument, first, answer, that although denie not the proportio~ of the similitude, béeing rightly applied, as S. Augustine vseth it, comparing heresie to a leprie, in respecte of the filthe and contagion of it: notwithstanding, where we haue not the expresse vse of the scripture for it, denie that any argument of a similitude made of man, is sufficient force to euicte a controuersie in the schoole of God, And therefore this is a manyfest vntruthe, that by the manyfest testimonie of diuine scripture it is euicted, that an heretike king may and ought to be deposed.
Name that manyfest testimonie, for as yet you haue not, and héere you make but an argument of a similitude.
But neither a similitude, much lesse a collection of your self, to frame an argument from a similitude theron, is a manyfest testimonie of diuine scripture. therfore this is a manyfest false assertion.
This similitude (as you here apply it) is of lesse force, in that you wrest the same similitude to other things, as to auricular confession, and to assoyling fro~ sinnes, and therfore it serues not properly, but is wrested, to deposing of Princes.
Thirdly, answere, if this similitude were admitted of the Priests desce the leprie then, and the Priests discerning heresie nowe: yet commeth it not home inough to depose the Prince, to exclude him fro~ his kingdome.
For the Priest had no such authoritie giuen him uer a leper, to dis him of his goods inheritance.
Only the Priest fou~d out whether it were a leprie, or no, pronounced him a Leper, if he were founde so to be.
Whiche done, the lawe tooke place of such a person, to be excluded from co~panie.
The execution of which law was not done by the Priest, but by the Magistrates and the people, as appeareth Num. And the Lorde spake vnto Moses, saying: Commaund the children of Israel, that they put out of the Host euery leper, and euery one that hath on issue, whosoeuer is defiled by the dead. &c.
So that ye of lepers, was not by ye authoritie of ye priest, but by ye princes authoritie or co~ma~demt, the peoples executio~, only ye priest discerned declared, who was, who was not a
And therefore this law reacheth not so farre, as to the iudgeme~t of deposition, much lesse to the taking away of any ma heritance, least of all of the Princes.
Fourthly, answers to the words that you cite, for the Priests authoritie herein, out of Leuit
VVhosoeuer shal spotted with a Leprie, is seuered at the will of the Priest, all the time that he is a Leper and vncleane, he shall dwell alone without the tents.
This sentence (as you haue set it downe in distinct letters) is not in all that Chapter, nor any other that finde, so that, except you quote some other place, doubte it will proue a lie, and a shamefull abusing of the holy scripture.
If you thinke it be holy, as ye call it, how dare you thus hacke and peruerte it? and where finde you these wordes, separatus est ad arbitrium Sacerdotis, He is separated at the will of the Priest? as though it were at his wi or arbitrement wheras he did but as the law commaunded him, and was prescribed in euery thing, what he should do therin.
Fiftly, answere, this lawe was pertaining to the Iudiciall law of the Israelts.
But the Iudicials in the olde lawe touch not vs, nor be any figures of our Iudiciall lawes, and therefore this is wrested herevnto· Sixtly· answer, the application of S. Paules sentence
Co. is no lesse manifestly wrested· For S. Paule speaketh nothing there of this matter, but of other matters.
ther but Haec autem omnia, Al these things· Haec autem omnia superius sayth Hao· All things aforesayde.
And therefore· do ll to applye this in generall, denie but as or ou or instruction.
But not for our descanting or construction· to make as liste vpon them.
For that both of the literal sense, you would thus must straked
If the matter of Christes parable, of the Cockle growing togither with the wheate.
graunt that we ought to auoyde such cohabitation as may conueniently be auoyded.
But such cohabitatio~, as cannot be auoyded without ye incurring of another greater sinne, must not be denyed.
As the husband to denie chabitation with his wife, though he be faithfull and she an Ifidell yet if she will tarie and dwell with him, he can not put hir away for ir infidelite: Nor likewise can the faithful· woman forsake the man, thoughe he be an Infidell: neyther can the childe denie his naturall obedience to his parentes cohabitation with the~, though he be faithfull and they be Infidels: Neither can the faithfull seruaunt denie his ciuill obedience and cohabitation with his Maister, although his maister be an Infidell, as were the most in S. Paules time, and yet he would haue none denie cohabitation with their maisters, no thoughe they were rough and cruell, besides their infidelitie.
And shal the subiect then denie his politike cohabitation· and ciill obedience to his liege Soueraigne and lawfull Prince, for pretence of diuersitie in religion? Eightly· answere, if you will néedes apply this separation of the Leper to a morall or mysticall signification, yet serueth it not to the deposing of the person from his Cill estate, or to his exelsion from a common weale, but to hys exclusion of morall vertue, or to his expulsion ute of the of grace, from beeing a ber of the mysticall com weale, whiche letteth not, but that he maye remayne
answere, your conclusion that you make for king, so well oh men, fayleth this example of king Ozs. or neither was he deposed by y^ Priest or by any other man, but king· so long as he is of king Ozias, thly, answee, that al this ere admitted maketh nothing against protestant Princes but it maketh much agai~st popish priests.
For if vnto all yt bring into the Church, straunge doctrine, straked as it were with the spots of Lepry, cohabitation must be denied.
Then the Pope and all your popish Priests, being founde to bring into the Church, other doctrine than God hath taught in his holy Scripture, are to lie thrust out of Gods Churche, if worse should not happen vnto you, by the figure (if you will go to figures) of Nadab Abiu, that offred straunge fire before the Lorde, and were consumed with fire from heauen, but beware you of a fire in hell.
And thus much to your figure of the Leprie for deposing Princes, which if we denie, you say (as is your common saying) we haue not our common senses.
But had you had your priuate senses, when you made this argument, you woulde haue béen better aduised, ere euer you had made it common, and had Printed it, but you did but as other had done before, for the argument before was common.
But what doe reason (sayth Maister Saunders) Athalia the Mother of Ochozias murdered all the Kyngly seede, excepte Ioas whome Iosaba had hidde in the house of the Lord.
But in the seuenth yeare, Ioiada the Byshop taking to him Centurions, Captaynes and souldiors, made a couenant with them, and swore them in the house of the Lorde, and shewed vnto them the kings sonne, and gaue the~ in charge what they should doe, and brought out the son of the King, and set the Crowne vpon him, and the testimonie, and made him King anoynted hym.
But Athalia when she sawe the King standing vpon the Tribunall, according to the maner: she cryed out, treason, treason, But Ioiada the high Priest commaunded the Centurions and saide: carie hir out without the boundes of the Temple.
And whosoeuer followeth hi, let him be striken with the sworde.
Ioiada therefore made a couenant betweene the Lorde and the King and betweene the people.
And Ioas dyd that which was right before the Lorde, all the dayes wherein Ioiada the Priest dyd teache hym.
Doe we not here playnely see the whole knowledge of the Kyngs cause, to haue bene belonging towardes one high Priest.
He calleth the souldiors, Iudgeth the Queene that had ruled seuen yeares, to haue raignedvniustly, and commaunded hir both to be deposed and killed, and in hir place dyd substitute Ioas to be King, and subiected hym vnder the Lorde, and placed hym aboue the people.
All which things sithe they were well done, is it not nowe true, according to the sentence of the diuine Scripture, that the Byshop oughte to knowe of the causes of Kings and Emperours, whether they be iuste or vniust.
For what so euer the Byshop in thys kynde doth, whether he define the King to be deposed or to be placed: he is no other than the Angell of the Lord, out of whose lyppes, as well Kyngs as priuate men, oughte to requyre the lawe of the Lorde.
The hygh Priest is as it were a sequester, as betweene the Lorde and the Kyng, so betweene the Kyng and the People.
So whyle one Iudge in the Churche is ordayned, bothe betweene Kings themselues, sturred vp wyth mutuall contentions, and also betweene them and theyr People: infinite occasions of warres and tumults are cutte off, Maister Saunders here firste asketh, what he doth reason? If he can not tell, what he doth reason, surely know not.
But this knowe that it was but a very weake reason, and therefore belyke he was wearie of it, and wyll returne agayne to vrge vs wyth example.
And here to knit vp the olde Testament, he alleageth the example of Ioiada the high Priest, for the kylling of Athalia, and the substitutyng of Ioas to bée King.
But this example, whiche beareth yet a face to come farre nerer to the purpose than any thyng spoken hetherto, notwythstandyng if it be well considered, is as farre from the purpose and as muche wrested vnto it, as the other.
omit that he still kepeth his old practise, in iumbling together diuerse pieces of the scripture, and not to set downe the text as it lyeth, and yet he maketh a distinction of letter, as though it were all the text.
Which and it were not his common vage of the scripture, were the better to be borne withall, and might be imputed to the ters negligence, as it often falleth out, but in so often handling thus of the scripture, it is not tollerable.
First, answere, this pertayneth nothing to the questio~ in hand for the deposing of a King.
Here is an vsurper, that had no righ so the kingdome killed.
And to your owne expositor Lyra saith: vsurpauit sibi regnum Iuda, prius describitur uiusonodi vsurpatio.
She vsurped to hir selfe the kingdome of Iurie, and this kinde of vsurpation is first described.
And the text is plaine that she had no right.
The right Kyng was Ioas, when his brethren were sline.
Therefore here was no deposing of hir. Neyther durst you say that Ioiada deposed hir, but he comaunded hir both to be deposed and killed.
Although for commaundement of deposing hir, you finde no suche thing, for she was not their lawfull gouernour, this therfore serueth not to the purpose of deposing a lawfull Prince, and that for heresie, which was not layde to hir charge, neither was she killed for that cause, but as a traytresse to the Crowne, as a murderer of hir owne bloode, and as a mere vsurper of the kingdome that belonged nothing to hir.
And therfore Ioiada did but as a good and faithfull subiect should do to his liege Lord, and to his heyres after him, and not as one that by his Priestly office, had power ouer the royall estate.
Secondly, aunswere, that the doyngs of Ioiada herein, were vpon such especiall occasions necessities, that it is euill drawne of you to an ordinarie example.
For none of the Priests either did the like, or coulde claime to doe the like to their kings, as Ioiada had done, muche lesse to be drawne to an example for ministers of Christ to follow.
First, Io ada was the vncle by affinitie vnto Ioas, for Ioiada the highe Priests wife, was sister vnto King Dehozias, whose childre~ Athalia being their Grandmother, did murther, saue that Ioas (being a new borne babe) was priuily conueyed away, by his Aunt Iosaba the highe Priestes wife, where he was closely norished in the Temple, till he was sixe or seauen yeares olde.
Good reason had Ioiada to kéepe the yong King his Cousin, and more righte thereto than any other, not by vertue of his Priestly office, but being thus of God sent vnto him, by his wines industrie, for the childes close and safer preseruing in the Temple.
And yet this nourishing a childe and his nourse in the Temple, coulde so litle be drawne to any ordinarie example, that if necessitie had not enforced it, it had not béene allowable.
That the Childe and his Nourse vvere kept in the loft of the Temple of the Lord, vvhere nobodie durst approche, but the Priestes and the Leuites, that kept the holy vessels there layde vp, to the entent they might there the better be hidden.
And althoughe it vvas othervvise vnlavvfull for a vvoman and a childe to be there, yet in such a necessitie it vvas lavvfull.
As Dauid and his men did eate the Priestly breade, being driuen in necessitie, vvhich notvvithstanding othervvise, had bene vnlavvfull for him.
Thus can not this déede of Ioiada for the nourishment of Ioas; be drawne to any ordinarie example.
Neyther durst Ioiada be knowne of this déede, that no doubt had cost him his life, had it bene but suspected.
Whiche argueth he had no ordinarie authoritie to put downe the Princes, no, not this very vsurper, being also a murtherer, and an Idolater.
In al whiche cases, if he had had any ordinarie power and right thereto, be woulde no doubt haue openly professed, and auouched his doing, and not haue kept it so long close, and priuilie watched his oportunitie.
But nowe, the childe being thus by the highe Priest and his wife preserued and nourished, which childe had the onely to the crowne, lay it not him vpon, was it not his dutie, yea his obedience too, bothe that he ought before to his brother in lawe deceassed, and to this his yong nephewe extant, that the childe should haue his right inheritance? and to whome belonged the procurement hereof, rather than to him that had the childe in custodie, besides that he was his vncle? sith no man of any countenance knewe hereof but he, howe should the childe haue gotten his right but by him? But did he make the child King by his priestly authoritie, as though the Priestes had had the interest, to appoint and make such Kings as they pleased? No, but it was the duetie of the one to procure it, and the right of the other to haue it.
And yet that he did not this of himselfe, the text saith plaine: he toke and brought Centurions and Souldiors to him into the Te~ple.
Here consequently (saith Lyra) is discribed the Institutio~ of the true heire, by the carefulnesse of loiada the high priest.
seking to this the assent of the Princes nobles of the kingdome.
So that he sought their assent help, or euer he would detect the Childe vnto them.
And for this present necessitie, he brake the order also of the priests courses that King Dauid had appointed, for the sonnes of Aaron Leui, to minister wéekely, then to giue place to other.
These he stayed for the more number strength, to establish the yong King in his right, so by these extraordinarie meanes, he crowned him king, caused the murtherer and vsurper to be killed.
This fact therfore of Ioiada, can not be drawne to an ordinarie example, except in these points, that euery good subiect, so much as in him lyeth, shoulde preserue the lawfull Kings childre~ and heires, not suffer any other to whom the inheritance belongeth not, to vsurp the crown, but the right and lawful heire thereof to enioy it, to expell al intruders vsurpers, chiefly such ty ants as séeke their vsurpation by execrable murthering, especially suche as against nature destroy their own bloud, and al such as by any other trayterous meanes aspire to the kingdome, and so far forth as they conueniently can, to helpe to restore the lawfull heire therto, as to whom only they owe their homage, and are sworn.
This is al godly subiects, and so all godly Bishops priests duties in euery Christian kingdome.
Thus may this doing of Ioiada be drawne to an ordinary example, which we denie not.
But what is this for Bishops to giue kingdomes from the right heire, to him that hath no clayme therto, but by the Bishops gifte, who giues a large thong of another mans leather, as doth the Pope giue kingdomes fro~ one to another, hauing no more right to giue them, than the other to take them.
Which is not to expel an vsurper, but for one vsurper to set vp an other vsurper, whiche is no more lyke this example, than an apple is like an yster.
Thirdly, answer, for Ioiadaes knowledge of the kings causes, he had them not in respect, he was the high Priest, but in respecte he was the vncle, the guardian, the norisher and protector of the person, béeing a childe: and yet this is spoken by M. without the booke, that after the coronation he had the knowledge of the kings causes Neither yet if he had the knowledge of the~, the king béeing in such estate, somuch beholding to his vncle, a general rule could be made there, or was made among ye Iewes, or can be made among Christia~s, yt either the bishops of any kingdom, much lesse ye B. of Rome for al kingdomes, ought to know the causes of kings Emperors, whether they be iust or vniust.
This generalitie can not iustly be inferred on such a specialtie.
For neither al kings estates like to this kings estate, nor all Bishops estates like to this Bishops estate, as by the causes aforesayd appeareth.
Fourthly, answer, that as here is inferred no ordinary rule, for Bishops to haue knowledge in kings Emperors cau ses, fro~ ye co~trarie, here is inferred an ordinary rule for kings Emperors to haue knowledge of B. causes.
For eue~ at the kings (althogh he wer an infa~t, had no more skil of religio~ tha~ of gouernme~t) ye text saith: they put the crowne vpon him, and gaue him the lawe in his hande.
And so saythe Lyra, the testimonie, that is, the law wherein he was ordeined, ought to studie and meditate, and keepe it, and cause it to be kept.
True it is, that the high Prieste did teach him, and the King did well, so long as he was taught of so godly a father.
And therevpon maye well be inferred that Byshops maye teach Kings that vvhich is right before the Lorde.
But this teaching of the King, inferreth no publike gouernement of the King, which the Pope claimeth, and M. Saunders pleadeth for.
The authoritie of teaching the King, and the authoritie of gouerning the King, are arre different authorities.
That of teaching we graunt to Ioiada, and to al Godly Byshops: not to teach what they will, but that vvhiche is right before the Lord.
And to sée that they do this, the Prince hath the lavve of God giuen into his handes, so well as the crowne set on his head, to shewe, that although the Byshops must teach true doctrine, and Godly exhortatio~, yet must the King haue knowledge to ouersée that it be taught· as well much more than any other matters of his kingdoms.
What shall we say then to the popishe Byshops, which will not giue the lavve of God into the Princes handes, but wring it out of his handes, that he should not knowe it, but blindly followe such false doctrine and naughtie examples, as they woulde teache him? are these Byshops like to the Byshop Ioiada? And if this king fel to Idolatrie, when he wanted this good teacher, how shall that King doe that neuer had suche a teacher? and yet for all this teaching of Ioiada, that was as it were a father to the King: the King notwithstanding, while he continued good, bothe commaunded all the Priestes, and taught them, how they should deale in their oblations, collections, reparations, and other thinges belonging to the Temple.
And Ioas saide to the Priestes, all the siluer of thinges dedicated, that be brought to the house of the Lorde. &c.
Let the Priestes take it vnto them, euery one of his acquaintance, and they shall repayre the broken places of the house, vvheresoeuer any decaye is founde.
yeare of King Ioas the Priestes had not amended that vvhich vvas decayed in the Temple.
Then King Ioas called for Ioiada the Priest, and the other Priests, and saide vnto them.
VVhy repaire ye not the ruines of the Temple? Novv therefore receiue no more money of your acquaintance, except ye deliuer it to repaire the ruines of the Temple.
Thus did the King not only knovv of the Priestes causes, but called them before him, yea, euen his vncle Ioiada the high Priest also, appointed an order vnto them how to bestow their offerings.
And when they were negligent therein, he rebuked the~, reuoked his former ordinance, except on their amendement.
Neither did the Priests, no nor his vncle Ioiada the highe Prieste grudge or grumble hereat, nor sayde that the offerings were theirs, not his, to dispose, nor told him they were his superiors: but as his inferiors, most humbly obeyed his ordinances.
Al vvhich things fithe they vvere vvell done: is not novve true, according to the sense of the diuine Scripture, that we may make a better ordinarie rule heron, for Kings and Emperors to knovve of Byshops causes, than for Byshops to knovve of Kings and Emperors causes? If you replye this was but a money matter: answere yet was this money, oblations and offerings.
But will you graunt Princes thus much, to make ordinances howe all your money offerings shall be vsed, when ye shall gather them, and when not, of whom ye shal take them, and howe ye shall bestowe them: ay, will neuer doe this, for money is the chiefest thing ye shoote at, no penie, no pater noster: all your ecl. causes depende so on money offerings, that as good ye gaue the prince authoritie in al ecclesiastical matters, as let him deale thus with your money offerings, as Ioas did with theirs.
But doth your own glosse expound this no further than to money matters? Ioas (saithe your glosse) both in this name and in this vvorke signifieth Christ, for it is interpreted the strength of the Lorde.
He commaundeth the teachers, that they should take all the money that is offered into the Lordes house of the passers by, to vvit, whatsoeuer spirituall knovvledge or good vvorke is brought into the Lords treasorie, that by the offices of the preachers, it may be bestovved on the repayring of the spirituall Temple, that vvhatsoeuer he shall finde torne by errour, or hurte by Vices, they should repaire least the multitude of hearers should perishe by the doctors negligence· Here this facte of the King is compared to the representation of Christe, and to the ouersight of all eccl. matters.
So that if Kings will account the studie of the Lawe of God, as well to belong vnto them as their crowne, if they will looke vnto, know, and examine the causes of the Byshops and their reuenues, and appoint them orders to repair the ruines of the Lords temple, and sée that the preachers lay out their talents, of spirituall knowledge good workes towards the building: then should kings truely represent Christe, and be indéede the strength of the Lorde, bycause they haue ye Lords power authoritie thervnto.
And thus this example better considered, maketh more for the Kings authoritie ouer the Byshops, than for the Byshops ouer the Kings authoritie.
Fiftly answere, that althoughe a Godly Byshop be a sequester betwéen God the Prince, betwéene the Prince and the people, in prayer, in the Sacramentes, and in preaching: yet· is he not a sequester betwéen God and the Prince, or betwene the Prince the people, in matters of the kingdome, least of all, he may sequester him from his kingdome.
And though he be the Angell of the Lord in his message, if he be a Godly byshop, for otherwise he is the Angell of Satha~: yet is the King the Lordes anoynted, or the Lordes Christe in authoritie: but the Lords Christ in authoritie, is aboue the lordes Angels in message: therefore the King is yet aboue the Byshops.
And although the King so well as the priuate man, ought to require the lavve of the Lord, out of the priestes lippes, yet if the Priest instade of the Lords lavve, will giue his owne lavv, the king ought to rebuke or punish him.
For if the King ought to require it of the B. then as it is the Byshops duetie to yelde it, so is it the Princes duetie and ofce to call vpon him, to sée to it, that the B. faithfully giue it to him, to all the priuate men in his kingdome.
Whiche againe proueth so litle the Byshops authoritie ouer the King, that it playnely proueth the Kings authoritie ouer the B. in requiring of the~ to preach the lavv of God, which is their proper office calling, and not to gouerne Kings, and translate kingdomes.
Sixtly and lastly answere, that if this were graunted to the Pope, which M. Sand. woulde so faine conclude, that one Iudge in the Church should be ordeined betvvene Kings themselues, and them and their peoples, that this one Iudge shoulde be the Pope: where he pretendeth, it woulde cut off infinite occasions of warres and tumults: as this conclusio~ can not be gathered on this example, so this effecte of peace to ensue by this meanes, is but an imagination in M. Sand. opinion, we should finde another manner of effecte thereof, that would be the very welspring of infinite warres and tumults.
And least he shoulde thinke that speake partially against the Pope, as he doth for the Pope, report me to the experience of it, and not to vaine imaginations, what tragedies hath the Pope raysed betwene the Gréeke Germaine Emperors, chiefly to the Henries the
the to Frederike the to Lewis the to the tumults of King Iohn in Engla~d, to ye Popes practises betwene Germanie, Frau~ce, Spaine, for the kingdomes of Cicil Naples, for the Duchie of Apulia Millaine, to the maintenance of the factions in Italy, betwene the Guelphes and Gebellines, the white sect, and the blacke secte, the French Imperials, the Uenetians and the Genowaies, the Florentines and the Pisans, al the states of Italy.
Al which and infinite moe warres and tumults in Christendom, haue ben raysed, nourished abetted, chiefly by this one Iudge the Pope, and yet would M. Sand. haue him to be the onely Iudge and definer, whether any King should be deposed, or be placed.
Were not this the readiest way to set al Princes by the eares? chiefly if he wold change his mynd vpon displeasure, or his successor should fauour an other, or there were two or thrée Popes at once, the~ should al Christendome be in a broyle by the eares togither, and the Pope would clap them on the backe, and win by the spoyle of all countries, and no countrie shoulde haue their lawfull and naturall Prince, but either foraine or periured vsurpers, nor any Prince haue his royall authoritie, but be the Popes Tenants at will.
If the world were come to this passe as it appeareth the Papistes would haue it, were not this a goodly quiet world trow you? But then it were a golde~ world for the Priests, when all men else shoulde finde it a bloudie world, and euery man wer eadie to cut an others throate, and all things runne to hauocke.
But were it admitted that none of these mischieues should ensue, but that al occasions of vvarre and tumults vvould be cut off: yet sith this calling to rule all Christian Kings and kingdomes, is vnlawfull for any Byshop (besides Christe) to haue: what were this peace but as the wicked say, Pax, pax, vbi non est pax, peace, peace, where God saith there is no peace? what were this peace, but the worldes peace, yea, the Diuels peace? where the strong man helde all things in his house in peace, where Antichriste ruled in quiet prospertie, till Christe a stronger than he, woulde come and breake his peace.
Rather than tumults shoulde be cut off, with suche a shamefull peace, and peace bought with suche a wicked condition: it were far better for Princes to striue to the death for the truth against such peace, and to cut off suche an arbiters head, who to maintaine his pryde for worldly peace, would make open warre with Christe.
And thus we sée the effecte would be naught, and yet as naughtie as this peace woulde be, we shoulde not haue it peaceably neyther, if the Pope might set in his foote, take vpon him to depose kings, and translate kingdomes.
But this example of Ioiada giueth him no such authoritie.
M. Saund. hauing now gathered together all the proues examples that he coulde wrest with any colour to his purpose, leaueth the ole Testament, falleth to the like proues and wrestings of the newe Testament: Howe Christe for the saluation of one man, let the deuils drowne two thousande hogges: How Christ draue the buyers and sellers out of the Temple.
How S. Paule gaue the incestous fornicator at Corinth, and Hymene and Alexander, to Sathan: How Peter reproued Ananias and his wife for lying to the holy Ghost, they fell downe dead.
For in all this, here is no king deposed, and therfore they serue not to this question.
But how euery one of them serueth to confute the Papistes, bicause the volume is risen too large alreadie, in these answeres, and chiefly in the answere to Maister Stapleton, am constraned here to breake off stay.
As for that which followeth of the Fathers of the Histories, and how those also are wrested as oulie as these: purpose to reserue (God willing) to another volume.
In the meane time, let vs coniecture the residue by these arguments, the rest of al ye Papists by these two M. Stapleton and M. Saunders, who are nowe their principall writers.
Whereby as we may easily weighe the peise of their stuffe, so we may euidently sée the drite of their malice, Thirsting blood, breathing treasons, practising conspiracies, procuring seditions, blowing out as it were a trumpet to open rebellion, against the Queenes Maiesti, their Natural Soueraigne and our most Gracious Gouernour, against all the states of the Realme, and to make hae of the whole congregation of Christ, and all to maintaine the pride, the tyrannie, the errors and superstitions of the Pope.
But with what weake and selender reasons, how impudently wrested, how shamefully applyed, how vnfitly concluded: All the world may sée, and themselues be ashamed, if they be not past shame: All the children of God may cléerely beholde, and not be afraide but the fullier confirmed in the truth thereby: All Christian Princes may the better perceiue, and the more abhorre the Popishe practises, with all their power represse them, as the vtter ruin of their sstates, and considering their high calling, may zealously loke to the dutie of their authoritie, and as their Titles put them in minde, be in déede most Christian Princes, and earnest defenders of the faith and Church of Christe: And all true subiectes maye sticke the faster in all duetifull obedience to their naturall Princes, detesting the foraigne vsurpation of the Pope, and all the traiterous seducings of these his chaplaines: That Antichrist may haue the ouerthrow, the Prince may haue the regiment, the truth may haue the victorie, the reader may haue the benefite, and God aboue all things may haue for euer the glory, through Iesus Christs our onely Lord and Sauiour.
VVherfore, be ye now aduised ye Kings, be ye learned ye that are Iudges of the erth: serue ye God vvith feare, and reioyce vnto him with reuerence, kysse the sonne leàst he be angrie and so ye perishe from the right vvay, if his vvath be kindled yea but a little, blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
Manie other faultes are escaped in the printing by reason the author vvas not alvvayes present: but they are such as thou maist (gentle reader) thy selfe correct them.

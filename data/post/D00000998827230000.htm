to his highness the lord protector of the commonwealth of england scotland and ireland and the dominions thereunto belonging

may it please your highness

had a while ago an opportunity to meet with a book come abroad in print written to your highness with a declaration to the commonwealth of england by rabbi menasses bn israel
looking upon it easily discovered the scope thereof but made way to upon false grounds and reasons as conceived altogether dissonant to experience and truth
this perswasion was wrought by reason of my having had sometimes occasion to read such authors as hold out unto us the behavior of the jews whilst here formerly residing which seemed to be such as the english nation believed other things of them then profitableness and faithfulness having bought their experience at a very dear rate
upon a meer serious review and consideration this opinion could not but be confirmed whereby the rabbi appears either to be utterly ignorant of our histories though a learned man

or else wittingly pass by and deny that which they clearly and fathfully enough make out unto us
and upon a religious consideration are his motives and arguments the more impertinent especially at this time when we stand least in need of their religion to come amongst us too many having already taken up if not their opinions yet such as border near upon their hold
your highness hath not been so easie to be allured by his great pretences as he might hope and others idly and upon false and presumptuous grounds unworthily surmise taking care lest their reduction might prove dangerous to religion or the wealth and interest of the people
but to detain your highness no longer with needless words what is here written in answer to him and debated calmly which is all can speak in behalf of this treatise humbly lay at your highness feet being ever

your highness's most humble and devoted servant



or the history of the jews whilst here in endland

the jews being a people favoured especially by god and chosen by him above all others on whom to shew his grace and in them on all mankinde have yet in all ages shewn abundance of ingratitude for which several ways and times they have been scourged no sooner were they freed from the egyptian bondage but presently forgetting the mercies received

and the miseries lately suffered they murmure against their deliverer and being settled in the land of promise easily forgetting how they came thither change their god and worship those idols which were not able to deliver the former inhabitants from their invasion

then quarrelling against the dispensations of god

they desire the government of kings under whom whilst they lived partly by their own depraved blindness partly by their princes carnal policies they were still drawn in their religion and manners after the customs of the heathen to whom after some few hundreds of years they were left to be subjected and inthralled

and though after the babylonish captivity they were

not found guilty of so gross idolatry as formerly yet ere long they fell off from the purity of religion and the inwards of it

to that corruption and formality which made way for that mist of error which overspreading their mindes and possessing their spirits kept out that light which in the fulness of time clearly shone amongst them

many have been the ways many the instruments by which god hath plagued their disobedience
the carkasses of the rebellious ones fell in the wildernesse the nations were part preserved to be as thorns in their eyes and goads in their sides and after the death of solomon israel began to be against himself and did not only struggle with esau after some
years from the rooting out of the ten tribes by salmanasser

after many inroads made by the babylonians egyptians and syrians judah is also carried away into captivity the city destroyed the temple burnt and nothing left of the face of a

neither did afflictions from forreign invasions and captivities cease after their reduction though they were not clean removed from their land
for what multitudes were enthralled in their ancient house of bondage one hundred and twenty thousand being reported to have been set at liberty by ptolomy philadelphus at such time as erecting his renowned library at alexandria he sent for the law of god and

interpreters to translate it
how did ptolomy philopator or physcon prophane the temple and gathering many thousands of them together intended by subjecting them to the teeth of elephants to feed his cruel and malitious humor and what they endured from the syrian and asian kingdoms especially

under antiochus epiphanes that vile person the book of maccabees with other histories sufficiently declare besides what tumults broils seditions and slaughters arose through the ambitious transactions of themselves for the priesthood and royal dignity

and the scepter was departed from judah when shiloh came falling out amongst themselves they were subjected to a forreign power called in to help

great pompey had reduced that kingdom to roman obedience aliens were placed over them

herod the great was harassing them with his tyrannies and oppressions when christ came who by the special providence of god escaped his hands whilest they rejected the government of christ they were still under the roman tyrannie maintained partly by herods partly by others sent from rome crucifying the lord of life rejecting the gospel of salvation they were spued up by their own land into all countreys despised by all and hated by most

the destruction of jerusalem foretold by christ some fourty years before whose blood they had charged upon themselves and posterity came to pass in the days of vespasian the emperor by titus his son

who being for the especial sweetness of disposition the love and delight of mankinde was yet their overthrow but that occasioned by their own stubborness
great was the concourse of people at that time out of respect to the season their superstition disarming themselves put a strong weapon in to the hands of the enemy that city came the second time to desolation being consumed with fire together with its ornament the temple some few pillars only left to posterity

to testifie the stateliness of what had been

of the remnant of this people

few were left behinde in their own countrey eleven hundred thousand perished in the siege and ninety seven thousand were taken captives they being scattered abroad in divers countreys yet especially abounded in egypt cyrene and cyprus where after some fifty years continuance they begin to commit outrages in an unheard of manner

here there are butchered by them they eat their flesh besmear themselves with their blood wear their skins saw them asunder cast them to beasts make them kill one another
the emperor trajan wondering and scarce believing such horrid treachery prosecutes them as so many monsters and enemies of mankinde an infinite number are offered up as a parentation

yet still they cannot rest

in his successor adrians days they must up again and try their fortune
that prince had built a new city where their jerusalem stood and called it after himself aelia setting up a sow over the gates thereof in opposition to them giving free liberty to all nations for the exercise of their religion such injuries offered to their superstition as they cannot digest whilst he remains amongst them they murmure being gone break out into open rebellion joyn battel with one of the most expert captains in his time

which brings a bloody victory to the adversary and a fearful slaughter to themselves

those that remained

adrian transports into spain his own countrey and thence or from elsewhere we have nothing considerable of them until the decay of the roman empire

at last it comes to that pass that christians selling for money the jews

buy christians for their slaves which being taken notice of by gregory the great and heraclius the emperor proving their enemy the kings of france and spain are stirred up by him to their conversion or extirpation

under theodebert and theodorick kings of france they enjoyed the most serene times but dagobert joyns with sesebodus of spain to their undoing yea so odious afterwards became they to christians

that some perswading christian princes to the recovery of the holy land out of the hands of their brethren the saracens their goods are presently pointed at as most fit to pay the souldiers wages yea some flew so high to pronounce the only way

to obtain their ancient countrey from the infidels was to take away their lives here as fighting more against the cause by their superstition and cruelties which being suffered made god displeased then the other by their swords and military engines

a stop was given to this heady and rash sentence by the interposition of st bernard and others
but as if such mischief nothing concerned them some of them seated about orleance in the year one thousand sent an ambassage to the prince of babylon

stirring him up against the christians
the ambassador suspected and examined the truth is discovered they are thence run upon and destroyed as monsters of men by the people

not long after they arrive here in this island

about the year first of all admitted by william the conqueror being brought from roan by him
their good welcom in other parts was no cause of their desire to see this country
he had made room enough for them by that hav he had made of the english

nation little good will bare he to it and this was never taken by it as a sign of his contrary disposition
he and all his successors intended to use them to their own advantage dealing with them as spunges suffered them to suck up the english treasure which they then squeeze out into their own coffers
for in his fourth yeer holding a council of his barons he summons up
out of each county

commands them to shew their laws and customs and agree upon that which afterwards was held authentick
here it is provided that the jews setled in the kingdom as the title runs should be under the kings protection that they should not subject themselves to any other without his leave it is declared that they and all theirs are the kings and if any should detain any of their goods he might challenge it as his own

being here thus brought in and settled they lose no time by their great extortion they fill their purses for the treasury and the english treasure up prejudice and against them both which will be shewed in the sequel of our story when mixing the blood of innocents with their sacrifices they made so great impression on the englishmens hearts as scarce ever will be worn out with the strength of time and then never could be satisfied but with their expulsion

indeed in the days of william the second little of transaction occurs in reference to them but what was caused by his own means
that kings scepticism in religion

or rather profaneness did but increase the fury of their superstition
being at roan in normandy he takes upon him for a reward to reduce one who was turned christian to his former ways again but being not able to perform his promise and put to a stand by his young adversary he bids him be gone

out of his presence but keeps half of the money to himself
and here at london he makes a disputation be held betwixt the christians and them
the bishops assemble the king is present promises to pass into the jews cause if clearly conquerors
they are said to have carried away nothing but confusion but this came of it that afterwards they became more confident stiffly affirming themselves not to have been overpowerd with reason but faction

the solency of their carriage in this business wrought grudges in christians

which joyned with the natural enmity to them as jews might have done more if the joy conceived for the kings stability and their own victory had not something allayed the matter and as yet scarce knowing one another there wanted experience of the jews conditions which time produced when growing secure through peace and plenty they easily betrayed themselves

throughout the reign of henry the first we hear nothing of them
as yet they were not so fully setled coming over removing from place to place providing themselves ways of livelyhood and were so active as though they were not many at the first and scarce for a while residing any where but at london yet shortly they wre spread throughout the whole land no town at all considerable but multitudes in it

at the first they had this advantage that through the english peoples ignorance of their manners for the generality and the horridness of them which afterwards appeared they might have opportunity to conceal their malice against the truth
yet at length it is fully discovered when in the year
and the ninth of king stephen all laws of humanity broken

all ingenuity which ought to be shewed by strangers towards them that harbor them in a malitious opposition against the truth and furious despight against jesus christ the saviour of the world in the city of norwich they lay violent hands upon a poor infant which following the example of their ancestors they most cruelly cruefie and murder

what the christians might think hereupon we may easily judge what indignation and implacable hatred might arise and that not only in respect to religion but out of sollicitation for the children of their own bowels who living amongst them might easily be insnared catched and miserably butchered when any childe was missing suspitions and jealousies could not but abound

this they could not be ignorant of and how by this means they digged pits to fall into themselves

notwithstanding having got a taste of christian blood and delighting much in that wretched cruelty seventeen years after and the seventh of king henry the second in the town of glocester they act the former part over again

crucifying another child in like manner in scorn and derision of our saviour and profession
this together with clipping and spoiling the coyn might justly have provoked more then we can read of
no great stir was made about it though such acts were not likely long to be tolerated with more then ordinary patience
yet this king instead of taking such course with them as they might deserve rather strives and bears with such enormities takes away no priviledge but adds unto them
for whereas ever before for the space of
years they had had no burying place allowed them any where but at london and so were constrained to bring all their dead from the most

remote parts hither

he gives them leave upon their petition at the parliament at oxford to purchase ground convenient for their service in all places provided it were without the town walls

in the year
king henry the second dieth

and before this his son whom most unfortunately as it happened he had assumed to the government and made partaker of his kingdom some think this young king to have born no great good will to the jews and that he would have manifested the same had he survived his father
but he dying richard succeeds of that name the first
now the people begun to be very weary of these their guests besides what's said being grievously oppressed with their usury
now also were they reported to do mischief in companies where they came poyson men and women as they had done the wels in germany during the troubles betwixt the emperour and pope
whereupon king richard the day before his coronation

forbids any of them by proclamation or their wives to come within the church or palace during the solemnity
they as yet having not experienced the fury of the people or expecting impunity for their presents they intended to offer approach neer the court gate

whereof the chieftain with divers of his affinity enter
hereupon a christian strikes one of them with his hand bidding him stand further off as the king had commanded whereat others taking occasion as watching for an opportunity lay at them with stones and other things that come to hand whereof ensues the death of some and hurt of many

it happened that one of them being hurt in the tumult

desired to be baptized which he was accordingly but being brought before the king and examined renounced again the christian faith

whereupon the

king looking upon the bishops and demanding what was to be done with him the archbishop of canterbury wisely replied if he will not be a childe of god then let him be a childe of the devil but others would have had him dealt with after another fashion

but the noise of what was done at court presently arrives in the city of london

then the heady multitude having got what they wished presently make to the jews houses but finding them entred and the doors locked some they break open pillage and rifle the houses those that are too strong they set on fire the owners miserably perishing in the flames and those that come forth are unmercifully received on the points of swords and spears by their implacable and furious enemies
tidings hereof being brought to the king he dispatches away rich de glanvill his chief justice and other ministers of state to appease the people but they being little reverenced and their authority as little regarded return again as they came having only ventured their lives to no purpose
this lasted from the noon of one day to two a clock of the next and then the rout broke up inquisition was made for offenders and some executed some houses of christians having also perished and much harm done

this on the morrow draws out a proclamation from the king

to the end the like for the future might be prevented none under great penalties are to hurt or molest a jew
but the king having taken upon him the cross and having crossed the seas into france upon his expedition into the holy land the people take occasion at his absence having the memory of the stirs at london fresh in their minds to satisfie their greedy desires in the jews destruction in divers parts of the realm

yet the occasion was given by themselves

that freedom from molestation which was indulged to them by the king they will not bestow upon one of their own nation
it hapned in lin that one of them turned christian and being for that mortally hated by them they sought occasion to take away his life resolving to kill him where ere they meet him
accordingly meeting him on a time in the streets they sell upon him
he to save his life betakes himself to the next church whither they also pursuing him break it open
hereupon a tumult is raised by the crying out of the christians who earnestly endeavoured to save the convert and with that many of the inhabitants and divers marrnors who were strangers came in unto the rescue
the jews are beaten home to their houses which the sailers out of greediness of gain rob rifle and pillage and setting them on fire get them to their ships hoise up sails and away they go
thus god raises up even strangers who came thither to trade to scourge this crooked and rebellious people

the next place which took the alarum was edmundsbury in suffolk on the of march

and the of the king when they being no less hated for their cruel oppression are set upon by the people plundred and slain
things were sooner composed here by the care of the abbot and the residue of the jews expelled the town never to return thither again
at stamford and at lin also at the same time were great stirs all places desiring nothing more then to be rid of these their guests

but the greatest commotion was at york

when the hand of god severely punished their stubbornness and cruelty there march the
in the same year the people envying the happiness of those towns who so

used them set most violently upon them forcing them for safety to take their heels
hence four or five hundred fly to towers to save themselves where being besieged and seeing little hopes to escape the danger one of their rabbies makes an oration to them exhorting them rather to kill one another then fall into their hands who opposed their law he begins first cuts his wives throat whose name was anna next his childrens then his friends and lastly his own the rest follow his example throwing their slain relations over upon their christians heads
some in another tower hearing what was become of these set the place and themselves on fire calling upon their companions hard by to do the like but these esteeming better of their lives then so offer to yield on condition that for turning christians and being baptized they might have them spared

this is agreed upon and concluded but they coming out were most perfidiously cruelly butchered malice and passion breaking the bounds of faith given
after this massacre the people run to the cathedral get all their bonds and obligations into their hands by which they had bound many a man unto them so unreasonably as if the authors were not of credit which report it it were incredible
but all these a fire being made in the midst of the church they reduce to ashes

now the king was beyond the seas on his way to palestine

but receiving this news hears it with great indignation fretting that his orders being so little observed his authority should be so much infringed as also for that he had received upon his setting forwards great sums of money from the jews wherefore he sends his commands to the bishop of ely to see these insurrections severely punished
the bishop according

to these injunctions marches down to york with a great army but mist his prey the chief actors in the tragedy being fled into scotland upon the rumor of his coming
the magistrates and chief citizens excused themselves as not accessary to the fact which was committed principally by the souldiers who being crossed and gathered together were to pass over to the king and follow him on his expedition and other countrey people which flocked thither from the towns near adjoyning
but the stout bishop would not be satisfied with this put off but fleeced the citizens the multitude being pardoned for that the ringleaders of the rout were fled away
the inhabitants of lin excused themselves laying the matter upon the sailers and had little said unto them

in the sixth year of this kings reign

were justices itinerant sent throughout the land in september
amongst other instructions this is given them in charge to enquire diligently of murthers of jews of the jews pledges goods lands and writings commissioners and places are appointed to inroll all their debts pledges lands rents and possessions and great penalies appointed to the breakers of these orders according to that that they and all theirs are the kings

all this while these several kings bore with them by reason of the profit which redounded to their coffers yet no great damage did they hitherto suffer
but now their actions rendring them more and more obnoxious as well as their religion and having hoarded up abundance of wealth to the undoing of the subject from henceforth they become a prey to the prince as often as his necessities call upon him who knowing where to have supply forces them always by strong hand to

disgorge themselves which provoking them for recruit to double their diligence the people come to pay for it at the last

now had king john succeeded his brother

a prince sufficiently covetous and griping
being in want or at least pretending it in his eleventh year he commands all the jews of both sexes throughout his kingdom to be apprehended imprisons them and inflicts great punishments upon them that they might empty themselves to fill his purse some he commands to have an eye pull'd out one at bristol being more resolute then his fellows stands it out refusing to redeem his liberty at so great a rate as the king required

he to take a speedy and certain way with him as he thought commanded he should every day as long as he refused to submit

have a tooth pull'd out of his head
the poor man had but eight in all stood out seven days then having but one tooth left him to save that agrees to the kings demand and pays the money

by this time their iniquities were grown so high that they were counted a burden to the earth on which they trod no rising no stir but part of it must fall upon them
in the wars betwixt the king and barons the city of london was taken by the barons men who presently breaking in fall upon the jews destroy them as the common plague

and rase their houses down to the ground of the stones of which ludgate was afterwards partly repaired as appeared by an inscription in a stone when the gate was builded the last time

king john after this leaves this life

and his kingdom also to a childe in a sad condition now was lewis the dolphin in england and the royal prerogative in

the hands of the barons yet by the honesty and prudence of the earl of pembrook all things were reduced to a quiet state condition the aliens expelled and peace setled
the jews during his were little molested but in his
year
they did sufficiently smart

is for france and wanting money whither should he betake himself but to their purses he gets the third part of all their movables

and away he goes

what people in the world would not have laid these things to heart and striven by the amendment of their lives to have hindred succeeding plagues but wretched is that people which commits iniquity by a law and whose very principles of religion prompts them to horrid and unlawful actions
they count it no sin but rather the contrary even to commit murder so they can but thereby scoff at and deride the christian profession
some five years after the kings going into france keeping his christmass at westminster seven jews are brought before him by one tolie

and grievously accused
they had gotten a childe at norwich and had circumcised him calling him jeremiah

kept him a year together intending to crucifie him at easter when they should meet together for that purpose
the thing was confessed by them and they thereupon cast into prison abiding there the kings pleasure

now begun this prince to be sore pinched with want
coming to the crown so extream young

he wanted that experience which others might attain who having not so much of their will at first by discipline with years might gather experience
his minions cost him dear he flew to that height in lavishments that at last he was constrained to break up house and betake himself to the monks to take his commons

this could not but turn to the jews cost and disquiet
he so orders the matter

that one abraham found to be a delinquent redeems himself with
marks and aaron protests the king hath since his last being in france taken from him at times
marks besides
of gold given to the queen

in the year
they are grievously fined again paying the fifth part of all their movables
they had committed a murder secretly and the king takes hence occasion to empty their purses imploying geofrey templar

one of his minions in the collection
about this time also they are reported to have done over that at norwich again which they did some
years before circumcising another childe whom they called jurnin who is also destined by them to the cross
but the just god turned the mischief upon their own heads the childe being in time discovered whilest his father heard him crying in the jews house
william de raele the bishop with other of the nobility being inraged for the fact apprehend all that live in the town
the jews pretending the kings protection the bishop answers it belongs not to the king but to the church to judge this matter of circumcision wherefore four of them being drawn at horses tails to the place of execution

receive their reward
at prague also they are said this year to have crucified a christian

and that which shewed their faithfulness sufficiently and procured them hared not in the least degree

was that in the year
at northampton they combined together and that for the destruction of that city which first harboured them preparing to set even the city of london on fir
this could not but enrage much yet having entred such courses as rendred them more then odious they are resolved to go on though

to their own destruction
but what they intended to do to the city they suffer themselves for many of them being taken in the same town where they hatcht their design are themselves reduced to ashes in the time of lent

and this year also were they expelled out of france

by command of king philip who then warred in their ancient countrey

the saracens there expostulating with him for his violence offered to themselves who never injured christ upbraid him with the fostering them in his realm who were his murderers
the cause was religion and he thought all things reflecting upon it were to be removed to stop therefore the saracens mouths this people must quit their habitations

king henry was now about this time beyond the seas

making a visit to his french dominions and there wanting money sends over his brother richard to procure it
the nobility for the most part plainly deny to help him with any but as for the jews they are a sure refuge they are fleeced at all hands and they might thank their purses that here they lived
not long after returning home and having spent an incredible sum of money in his journey and thereby contracted a great debt being put off by his barons he betakes himself again to his never failing treasury he squeezes the jews again and yet having pressed out almost both blood and moisture turns them over unto his brother
he pittying their condition little molests them but upon pawns supplies the king with a great sum of money

but what shall we say to a people that is given up to a reprobate minde and commits iniquity with greediness whom neither fear of god of the laws love unto mankinde nor the dictates of humanity can

bridle and restrain whose blindness is such whose stubborness is so great that no experience can remedy no affliction can lessen they are not yet satisfied with christian blood they will rather venture all then not vent their malice against christian profession
they have another annual tragedy to act and lincoln for this year must be the stage
there in that city in the year
they get a child into their hands of eighteen years of age whom after many cruel whippings scourgings

and tortures they again crucifie and murder in derision of christ a pilate is made before whom he is brought accused and condemned suffering their malice in the same manner as our savior had done before they imitating as near as they can their ancestors in this their horrid and abominable act
being dead the childe is thrown into a well near the hos whre this butchery was committed
the poor woman missing her son and inquiring after him finds he was seen playing last before that door with the jews children and hence upon suspition the well is searched and the body found
the man of the house being apprehended and examined by john lexinton upon promise of pardon confesses the murder acknowledges it to be their custom every year to crucifie a child but very secretly and therefore not easie to be discovered
the king would not suffer the man to live but presently commands his execution when coming to die he accuses most of the jews in england as accessory to the fact it being their custom upon notice given most of them to meet upon such a wicked occasion
in november an hundred two were carried up to the king being hen at westminster thence were commanded to the tower of these afterwards
were hanged the rest remain'd long time in prison
the body of the child

whose name was hugh was honorably buried in the cathedral and he ever after accounted a martyr

about two years after hapned a thing in teuxbury

which perhaps might as well be omitted as spoken of
it chanced there that a jew fell into a jakes on saturday which being their sabboth he would not that day be drawn out for breaking of it
the earl of glocester hearing this news forbids him to be taken out the next on sunday for that neither he said should the christian sabboth be broken by him whereupon the poor man lying there till munday miserably died
of this story have read these verses rimed according to the poetry of that age

christian tende manus solomon ut te de stercore tollam
jew sabatta sancta colo de stercore surgere nolo christian sabatta nostra quidem solomon celebrabis ibidem

in the year
and of this henry the
the

a jew little remembring into what a tickle condition their deserts had brought them wounds a christian within colechurch in the ward of cheap
he is pursued home to his house by the multitude and there slain with whose life yet they would not be satisfied
but going on in their fury they break up and pillage the houses of that nation and kill divers so full were the londoners of prejudice and spight against them that upon all occasions they could not bu discover it
but not onely against their persons do they rage the publike toleration of their religion was also a great offence to them running therefore to their synagogue at the west side of olaves jury where they for the most part lived they utterly destroy it
the

ground being afterwards by the king given away became the seat of friers next of a nobleman then of a merchant and since that of the windmil tavern

but now ere long the sparks of discontent and grudges betwixt the king barons were quite blown up into a flame his lavishments and neglect in administration of justice had subjected him to their plots and combinations and betwixt both parties sprung a more then civil war
the barons had gotten the hearts of the citizens who easily drawn with the promises of freedom and reformation of abuses took their part but the jews loving neither in reality clave to the king sufficiently knowing their own interest in this matter though at other times they could take no warning but by their abominable actions drew still upon themselves one plague at the heels of another
but here they saw on whom they depended what it was that kept them here and what they might expect if the barons should prove victorious

accordingly therefore in the year
they that inhabite in london resolving to do what they may plot the destruction of barons and citizens altogether
but nothing except desolation and misery attending them they are detected hereof almost all slain their houses ransack'd abundance of treasure being therein found scraped up together

but within a while providence had decided the civil quarrel

giving the victory unto the king whereupon a parliament was called and many turned out of their estates being proscribed by law
divers of those disinherited gentlemen being thus and sore repining at their condition betake themselves to the isle of oxholm whither resorts a multitude of the baser sort who rob and rifle the places near adjoyning

and act according to the custom of men carried by necessity and desperation
now lincoln being not far distant is taken and sacked by them wherein not unmindeful of the publique enemy the jews they run to their synagogue which they burn together with their law and many of them in it thinking it even sin if to their other robberies they should not add this of spoiling them who in that place had broken the bounds of all humanity and thereby deserved many deaths

and now we come to the last passage we meet with during the long raign of this king
things seeming to be prettily settled yet clouds begin to gather again
the earl of glocester is unsatisfied with affairs and the efore must up and make way for better fortune by his sword
he comes up to london and gets possession of the city
the jews then their wives and children being sensible of the approaching of their ruine with the popes legat flock into the tower of which they have a part assigned them to defend
but things being after a while composed they also for a while enjoy quietness and security

now began the english liberty from these incroachers to draw on amain for in the year
king edward the first had ascended the throne succeeding his father
their oppressions were now grown so in tollerable that longer they could not be endured the people of england being almost ready to quit their dwellings and leave them their habitations

therefore in the third of the king a parliament is called and in it amongst other things their unreasonable usury is restrained by law and for that they are accounted unworthy of any charitable thought they are ordered to wear plates in their clothes clear to be seen that every one might take notice who they were

but that they cannot get one way they will have another the measure of their iniquities was not yet compleat and therefore they run on still to their own destruction
would any people under the cope of heaven having had so many warnings undergone so many troubles suffered such massacres yet go on as if to make amends and procure themselves safety was to heap guilt upon guilt and adde treachery to violence but in the year
and the sixth of the king they wash

clip and counterfeit his coyn as they had done before in the reign of henry the second
being apprehended they likewise accuse the christians as accessary
at london nigh are executed amongst whom there were three christians many being also put to death in other places

king edward

according to the tenor of their hold here in england and their obnoxiousness to which their actions had reduced them counted all they had his own and for of what was demanded the whole generation scattered through the whole land are shut up in one night where they enjoyed no day until they had fined at his pleasure
the commons now offered to the king the fifth part of their moveables to have them banished

but this prince having this opportunity his predecessors wanted of their vying with one another makes his own markets takes most that is offered and so the jews emptying their purses purchase their continuance a little longer
but vengeance pressed them at their very heels they acting such an horrid murther this year beyond the seas as is scarce to be thought and if not theirs harder to be believed

doubtless the prejudice and antipathy betwixt the english nation and them now was such as would not

admit of any reconciliation and thereupon might divers inconveniences proceed but especially the disagreement of their religion joyned with great perverseness of disposition plunged them into devillish and unheard of wickedness
this year they were generally imprisoned here in england and as we may say as guilty in approbation at least of what their countreymen practised in other parts who at munchen in bavere stabbed a childe throughout his whole body with needles

taking his blood in a bason to use it as the suspition was then in sacrifice for stanching that issue of blood wherewith this people christians know why is continually pestered
these butchers were detected by the drover an old hag taken in the very manner while she was stealing a second for the same purpose
the bodie of the former being found out by her directions the fresh print of infinite wounds filled with gore imploring vengeance as it were with so many watered and blubbred eyes so enrage the multitude that they could not expect the judges sentence but fall immediately upon these jews notwithstanding the princes servants and their chief magistrates earnest endeavors to appease the tumult conveying as many jews as they could into their synagogue which the people burning with fury set on fire and with it burned
jews
but this by way of digression falling out in this year
now to return again to england

the several kings making their markets out of the jews at all occasions the score was to be discharged at the subjects cost
not content to let them rob the countrey by their unmerciful dealings they must also upon their wicked desires give them securitie against justice it self for a little gain
it hapned that in the
year of this king
he being then

in gascoin a certain knight sued a jew for the unjust detaining of a mortgaged manor
the jew shifts off the business and for his discharge produces a protection king henry had granted him that he should never be convented before any magistrate but himself alone

upon this the knight goes over to the king desiring justice against his adversary avoiding the equity of law by such an unreasonable priviledge
the king answers it would not stand with reverence due to the memory of his father to make void that he had granted in this matter but he would indulge him also this priviledge that so he might be even with his adversary that what injury he or any other christian should offer to that man they should not be bound to appear before any but himself alone as long as the jew should stand upon his charter
the knight returns home with this answer and his honest adversary being acquainted with his success was glad to come to what accommodation law would offer no longer insisting upon his former grant

this peoples honesty in this particular is very conspicuous
this man hath an intention to be wicked and must have a priviledge for it
but counting of christians worse then of turks and infidels because more directly opposing them in their way of superstition what they might get any way they counted it their own and honestly enough fear of punishment no conscience bridling their malice

but such like throws of their dishonesty were but still signs of their ensuing death and of that delivery the land was about to make of them it being radicated in the nature of things to unite their spirits and double their diligence against that which is shortly likely to work their ruine
their iniquity being now fully

ripe their time is also already accomplished
king edward is returned out of gascoign

and being honorably received of the clegie and nobilitie holds a parliament at westminster such as was likely to bring nothing but calamity to the jews for whose expulsion so much had been before this time offered
the people in parliment are said to be resolved rather to undo themselves once then be always undoing their religion safety of their children and the kingdom honor and profit which by the imbasing and clipping of its coyn had gone to wrack call upon them and a fifteenth is offered to the king to have them expelled

it seems they did not now overbid for the fifteenth was acceped and an act made august
and the of the king

that upon pain of hanging they their wves and children should before the feast of next ensuing depart the land
some say

they had onely money given them to bear their charges over into france
others say that all goods not moveable with their tallies and obligations being confiscate all other moveables as gold and silver they were licensed to carry over
the number of them when they departed was about
many more then at their first coming an increasing misery to the land where ere they come

by vertue of this injunction

and in obedience to it they prepare for their removal
divers of the richest hie a great ship and therein having put much treasure are carried down the thames towards the mouth of the river beyond quinborough where the master wickedly conspiring with the mariners to rob them of their riches they are advised to go down out of the ship with him and walk upon the sands to take the air
having so done and it being now flowing water

and the fands beginning to be covered the master is drawn up by a cord on but they are then left exposed to be swallowed up of the waves crying out for help they are inhumanely bid to call upon moses for deliverance and perish miserably by the floods
this greediness of gain in the master and mariners was justly rewarded he with others being arraigned and condemned by the justices itinerants and accordingly executed for so vile a fact though little pity was had for the generality of them that perished

being looked upon onely as pursued by the hand of divine justice

now gone they are and the english peoples disquiet with them and never since could they procure licence to return
king henry the third founded an house for those of them that should be converted in his year

which afterwards in the of edward the third was again dissolved and appointed to the keeping of the rolls in which service it continues to this day
king edward the first also cleansing his territories of the jews

as so many locusts had before commanded whilst beyond the seas that the parts of aquitain should likewise be swept of them

thus have proceeded as an historian keeping close to that way according as am informed by our writers
and hereupon am not ignorant that some there are and that not without reason who may deny their assent to what is said concerning their expulsion being induced to believe the contrary by greater authority then this report the oracle of law in his time pronouncing no statute to have been made for their banishment
judge cook in the second part of his institutes upon the statute de judaismo affirms there was none but onely that which was for the taking

avvay their usury upon vvhich they left the land as he conceives being so deprived of their trade or way of life
have not arrived at that height of arrogance as to oppose so great a man especially in his own way but yet shall tender something to consideration as am warranted by history whereby hope shall escape the hazard of being thought to break the bounds of modesty being found onely in that way in which at first set forward
our historians all with joynt consent affirm them to have been actually banished or expelled many of whose words shall first set down and then see onely what they might seem further to hint unto us

matthew of westminster

and approved

author in his flores historiarum at the
year of our lord hath these words aug
judaeoum exasperans multitudo
on the third day of august the exasperating multitude of jews which in times past had lived confidently in divers cities and strong towns is commanded with their wives children and moveables to depart england about the feast of which is set as the utmost limit of their continuance which under pain of hanging they durst not pass the number of whom was thought to be
such a decree had gone out before from the commendable king of england in the parts of aquitain out of which in like maner the jevvs vvere banished
so he
thomas walsingham in his hypodigma neustriae writes thus rex angliaereversus de wasconia

the king of england being returned out of gascoign is solemnly received by the clergy and all the people at london

who the same year expelling all the jews out of england giving them to bear their charges over into france confiscated the rest of their goods and polydor
virgil in his seventeenth book at the
year of christ delivers the matter thus anno deinde qui

then in the year which followed a council was held at westminster in which first of all is debated the ejection of the jews of which there was throughout england a great multitude that so the sheep might be separated from the goats
therefore it is commanded by a publique edict that within a few days all should depart with their goods they obeying the command of the council went divers ways thus far polydor who useh the word concilium for that we call parliament it with other words being as a great

antiquary observes an usual term in ancient authors for that thing
polychonicon lib
cap

saith the jews were put out of england and never came again
stow in his annals writes that this year all the jews were banished this land for which the commons gave a fifteenth
in like manner writes holinshead expresly that they were banished by act of parliament and that a fifteenth was granted to the king to have them expelled that all their goods not moveable were confiscate with their tallies and obligations all their other moveables of gold and silver the king licensed them to convey with them that they could never since obtain a priviledge to return and with these concurreth speed who tels us that the king to purge england whither he was now returned from such corruptions and oppressions as under which it groned and not neglecting therein his particular gain banished the jews out of the realm confiscating all their goods leaving them nothing but

money to bear their charges

others might be brought who testifie the same thing neither is there any historian that know who denies it

now strange it is that all these should be misacquainted and mistaken that those of the near adjoyning times to their departure should so grosly erre and that those who lived in the same time should deliver to posterity so great a falshood
for if any had reported their departure to have been voluntary it might have been found out by some of those who succeeded and had their gatherings from them
matthew of westminster sets down the day the act should be made for their expulsion mentions the time set as the utmost bound of their continuance and withall the penalty or punishment they were to suffer even hanging if found hereafter and that the king had made such adecree before for banishing them the parts of aquitaine a strange thing that he should so grosly erre in so many circumstances
walsingham writes that the king returned home that he was met by the clergy and all the people and that this year they were expelled
polydor

saith it was by parliament by its publike edict and that they obeying its commands departed hinting unto us the end that so the sheep might be separated from the goats
polychyronicon saith they were put out of stow that they were banished out of england holinshead and speed use the same term this last adding also the kings design which was to purge the land from such corruptions and oppressions as under which it groaned and also to fill his own coffers which was done pretty well partly by the confiscating of their goods which all or most mention as also by the fifteenth granted him by the commons to purchase their banishment which some aver

we read that about the year
the commons before offered the king the fifth part of their moveables to expel them and it cannot but be likely they would also desire the same at this parliament for though usury was the main thing under which they groaned yet there were other things they could not but be sensible enough of viz
crucifying of children and their great spight to christian profession with their late spoiling of the coyn
and scarce could this other act against their usury only give them hopes sufficient that thence they would be driven away for as we see before in the third of the king their usury was restrained and bounded and other ways of life they might take up and rather stay here with what they had already got then by departing to lose all as it seems they did though judge cook tels us that there was provision made that no subject should hurt or molest them acknowledging also that the forementioned fifteenth was given

and that too for their expulsion

this reverend lawyer tels us this act de judaismo was made in the
year of the king but a little after the feast of hilary whence these perhaps imperinent thoughts have sometimes come in upon me that if there was no mistake of this year for the third of this king in which formerly we read their usury was restrained then perhaps this same act de judaismo and the other for their banishment might be enacted in several sessions of parliament viz this last the
of august after as matthew of westminster mentions and the record lost the act being omitted in the writings of lawyers as deemed of no use
and for losing of the record am easilyer induced to think it possible because am credibly informed that that of the

act for establishing the use of the book was also missing heretofore and thereupon some escaped that which else had light upon them
and this desire to tender as an excuse for my keeping close to history in which has lyen the work of this relation nothing desirous to impose upon the belief of any or hereby to contradict so worthy an author

thus admitted by william the conqueror about the year
they were expelled in the year
being here some
years longer by five or six then their ancestors were in egypt during which time we may easily see the english nation was as in bondage
and by this history impartially though truly related may that book sufficiently be answered by occasion of which this was written the profit which redounded by them to this nation their saithfulness also being sufficiently discovered upon which grounds the rabbi raises his short discourse
but because it may more clearly appear and the case may be more fully debated we shall descend to his particulars and scan them fully
the author though perhaps learned enough in other histories yet seems either utterly to be ignorant of ours or else wittingly to decline that which he knew would injure his cause sufficiently

in his epistle to his highness the lord protector he desires that all laws may be taken away which stand in force against this innocent people made in times and during the government of kings
but if he please to turn his eye upon what hath been written he may easily see that it was not innocency but the clear contrary that drew out these laws against them and for that he and his think this easier

to be procured since the kingly government is taken away he may know that it was by the kings alone they were kept here so long
the people would gladly have been rid of them an hundred years before they were and desired their expulsion above all things
nay they offered a fifth part of their moveables to have them expelled but king edward only sucking sweet from them and intending to make his markets out of this contention upon their offering more gave them leave to buy their continuance for a little longer
and in the war betwixt henry the third and his barons as is above declared they stood for him conspired the ruine of them and the citizens of london and that more for their own ends then out of any faithfulness to him

in his declaration to the commonwealth of england he acquaints us with the motives of his coming over the first is to obtain free exercise of his religion for his countreymen
here indeed it was anciently granted but what good came of it its the desire of this people to be fishing in troubled waters they may have hopes in this juncture of time to catch proselytes what his own design may be shall not question if we should trust him upon his word it might be unsafe to deal so well with all his followers
their ancestors compassed sea land to make a proselyte and he confesses this to have been the cause of their expulsion formerly out of spain but let us descend unto his second

in this cannot but wonder at the rabbi
its believed that the time of their redemption is near saith he and that they must first be scattered throughout the world
what then therefore if this be true they must first have a seat also in england
why they had a seat here once before for the space of above

years and must they needs come again or else their dispersion as to this place cannot be accomplished

the third motive upon which he came over was for the benefit of our nation which he so much desires that which truly if sincere we cannot but applaud it being a thing not usual for us to be so loved by that people
we cannot but thank him for his affection but must a little question his grounds by and by when coming to his book we shall descend with him to particulars
his fourth motive is no less to be approved of his particular respect to this commonwealth is a motive to his sollicitation for the readmission of his countrymen
he might easilier if he so much love us have leave given him to continue but we cannot but suppose he can scarce promise the like affection in all his brethren and if he should its sooner said then believed
and whereas he commends hospitality and kindeness to strangers so much to our consideration our nation was never unkind or churlish but the jews too much familiarity with it heretofore has put them out of the influence of hospitality

now to come to the book it self
three things he proposes to his highness the lord protector as making a people or desirable amongst all nations viz
profit accruing from them faithfulnessin them and nobility of extraction all which he attributes to the jewish nation
profit indeed is the thing that all kingdoms and states much look after and with good reason for money is the comfort of peace and the sinews of war but such profit is onely desirable as is joyned with glory to god honor to the magistrate and countrey and the safety and prosperity of the subject
upon which grounds if should grant him

the application of profitableness to themselves yet should think it to be purchased with such effects as might accompany it
god ought to be the beginning and the end and religion the way of his worship is principally to be regarded
now toleration of that which is contrary to it or a receiving of them which would endanger it which would not onely be a suffering of superstition to be practised by ooters but be also an occasion to the natives of this miscarriage is scarce to be warranted however there where as yet it is not admitted
there be certain times and seasons which make that at one time dangerous which might at another be admitted with more security
the truth is apt to have not onely fickleness weakness accompanying it but also great differences and dissentions although incorruptible in it self and many though not agreeing in all things yet may be contained within the verge of its necessaries and fundamentals
where the greatest power of religion is there the devil is the busiest sowing tares amongst the wheat and mixing the corn with his cockle
this we must confess is the condition of our countrey at present and fear the jews too well consider it
by so much the more therefore as they may desire to come in doubtless in this respect the state hath as great to deny them

honor and credit is the second thing by which a state ought to rule and according to which order and bound its profit
it was a saying of that renowned lord burleigh

lord treasurer of england when about his charge in the revenue that nothing was fit for a prince that was not also joyned with honor and that he did not like that the treasury should fill like the spleen when the whole body was worse for it
now

what honor it would be to admit them who were once

expelled before of whose worth faithfulness and profitableness we have once experienced in our ancestors cannot determine
but this second rule depends especially upon that which precedes and of this which follows

acknowledge that whilst they were here before much profit redounded to the kings of england from them but in what way hath been declared not from their merchandizing upon which our adversary principally insists
our countrey is not so convenient for that way as others may be and if they should be here admitted again spread once more throughout the land thousands there would be which could not have opportunity to exercise that way through the inconveniences of their habitations
they exercise themselves in that way of life which most suits with their profit and the commodiousness of the place wherein they live
usury was most practised by them here and is still in italy and other parts where they have not such opportunity of trading
but grant that the trade is now enlarged through the discovery of the ast indies by sea and of america as it is enlarged so also more of our inhabitants follow that couse then formerly being sufficient to satisfie for that business so that if the jews be admitted to trade again our merchants must needs be justled by them and what would redound to the state in custom and excise the land being already sufficiently furnished would not compensate the damage of the subject
if many should be suffered to trade this could not be avoided and if not then needs must they betake themselves their number encreasing to some other course of life which might prove no less dangerous they being

noted to be as sucking leaches where ere they come in some way or other
but if they should trade with other countreys rather in way of sale and exportation less profit would the state receive from them

he magnifies the skill his countreymen have in all kinds of merchandize and that is occasioned as he confesses by the oppcrtunity they have being every where dispersed to serve one another
and would not this turn to their own advantage more then to the benefit of their entertainers might they not hereby ingross the trade wholly to themselves and serving one another cheat the natives in their traffick and what would the english be better for their trafficking with their countreymens money who live in spain for larger their banks vvould be more they vvould engross the trading
and if the king of spain savv it profitable for him he vvould so far dispense in the inquisition as to give them no occasion of removing from or keeping this treasure out of his dominions
and vvhat though they have not a countrey to repair to as other strangers and thereby as he alledges are not likely to take avvay their riches can they not transport it as they do he tells us in spain they shortly also expect vve see their messias to come and restore them to the countrey of their ancestors and being aliens they vvould little love the countrey and so do little for it tending by their good vvills to any great advantage

if they be so well received and live so happily all over as he instanceth for illustration of this branch or profit vvhy then are they not content to keep them vvhere they are already it must needs be their ovvn good or ours vvhich they so much desire or for that they must have a synagogue here also not vvilling

but that every place should be blessed with their religion
this he intimates expresly that they might have leave here also to serve god
is it the soil or the air they desire their religion should be seated in why not as well serve god where they are there's something more then this in the business

but by whom is it they are thus received and entertained he confesses the people hate them generally and must this be for nothing in a fixed and established state where factions do not bandy such as they are generally where they live scarce is any grievously hated but there is some notable cause for it
and if the king of denmark hath invited them into his dominions or the duke of savoy or of modina it is for some respect or other perhaps they may be admitted for the same ends our kings formerly so long retained them viz for their own gain though much to the subjects discommodity and trouble

and if they chiefly abound in the turks dominions its no wonder
all the world knows the slavery of his subjects he counting all their goods his own and they made for him not himself for them its no wonder if he care not how they be used how pillaged how oppressed
if he imploys the jews so much in gathering his money he knows them to be fit instruments for his purpose
he knows how to press and squeeze out of them what they have before sucked up
all his subjects leave him their heir at their death no child having any of his fathers estate but what he bestows upon him
there they cannot but be especially kept from risings and insurrections under that government which having so many officers subordinate to one another and the countrey distributed to their charge all insurrections except great indeed may be quickly dashed

the author goes not about to reckon up how many bassa's beglerbegs or sansacks there are of his nation they are exempted he saith from going to war and there's very good reason for it
for their religion the turks account of them worse then of christians not suffering one of them to turn turk till he first be baptized
and when the grand signior dyes what pillaging of them as well as christians uses there to be

after this he reckons what numbers of jews there are in germany poland italy barbary the and how many are preferred to places of great trust and influence still always acknowledging how they are despised of the multitude
if they were profitable to these countreys the contrary whereof is seen for the most part by the grudges of the subject he would scarce from thence necessarily make it follow that their reduction must also be convement for this nation
if they have such experience of them as this land hath had if gone believe they would scarce recal them
the emperor of germany and king of poland have tolerated that which put to the voyce of the people for whose good they are and ought to reign would soon be removed and in poland and those places so odious they are that as once here in england they are distinguished in their habits to be known from the natives being noted also for that practice of usury of which our adversary would clear them

the pope with other princes of italy sucks not little profit from their oppressing of the people he fares well by their extortion and therefore willingly suffers them especially since the reformation of religion out of emulation against the prorestants whom he hates worse then them or the turks themselves as the jew loves turks above christians
the republique

of venice and so that of the tolerates them and they may have particular reason for it
their government is such that those who are merchants are also senators and few but they are found in both these ways who are any thing considerable and therefore what they may hinder them in trade it is supplyed in customs and other duties equally redounding to the profit of all whereas our merchants being fewer in number if the state should be something benefited by their trade and others thereby be something eased they alone would seel the weight of the burthen

but neither in the are they so exceedingly fond of their company though scarce can they with conveniency as things now stand turn them oft divers of their families being matched to them covetousness procuring that which might be abhorred by religion
so are they likewise in portugal intermartied the people being generally weary of their guests
reason of state makes the tolerate all religions but the popish
from whence shall it not presently be concluded that all their neighbors should do the like

and now come to his second thing which he proposes as a motive to receive them and that is their faithfalness and honesty
think might well spare my pams to answer this any further then by what hath been already shewed
how faithful they have been to this english nation et any impartial reader judge
they who shall out of scorn and hatred of our profestion crucisie children lay violent hands on tender infants and that by common practice they who shall clip counterfeit and mangle our coyn shall rise up and butcher with unheard of send ssages to pagans to stir them up against the common

name of christianity wishing with caligula it had but one head poyson fountains and the like shall we count them faithful
they took part indeed with our henry the third against his barons but it is no uncharitableness to judge it done more for their own ends then any faithfulness to the then magistrate
if they have done sometime that which is good in it self yet they have done it with such malicious minds that god hath given them but the reward of wickedness
so in the year
they furnished the poor christians of bohemia with money and munition against their antichristian persecutors

and therefore were quite banished out of bavere quite bereft of all their money and coyn
and lastly banished all the dominions belonging to frederick duke of that province

indignities offer'd to religion in such an horrid way as by the vile butchery of poor innocents upon a cross
can no way come in upon the account of faithfulness and yet this they have ordinarily practised in other parts as well before as since their expulsion
if they may finde an opportunity what their will may be we may gather from that their carriage during the troubles betwixt the emperor and pope when hoping christian religion would have dyed in those wars seeing the state of christendom deeply indangered in these civil broils

they according to their jewish policy seek to thrust it over head and ears in blood poysoning the fountains throughout germany offering like violence to the sacraments as they had used to do before

and we may further see their faithfulness and carriage what it hath been since their expulsion to go no further then to the days of queen elizabeth
in the year
and the ninth of her reign they were expell'd

by pius quintus the then pope

and that even for their horrid and extravagant usuries and oppressions for their combining with thieves and robbers for sorceries or magical charms in winning women to their own and others lusts
and are we not satisfied with that horrid and abominable treason of lopez by whom we have warning enough never to meddle with them more as a people always working mischief to this nation this miscreant taken in by the queen to be her houshold physitian conspires with her spanish enemies for money to work her destruction and promises to poyson her

accordingly for that purpose he brings her a purge but she having by the special providence of god discovered his treachery according to former agreement sends him with it to the lord treasurer burleigh telling him that he stood more in need of physick
upon this he carries it to the old man desirous at least to dispatch one of them but he being too cunning for him demands what he hath there and upon answer a purge telling him he must be a physitian to purge ill humors out of him presently causeth him to be apprehended
being convicted and according to sentence brought to the place of execution he there professed that he loved queen elizabeth as well as jesus christ himself

the argument of their faithfulness as to the rabbi is but very jejune and therefore no wonder if he produce so few examples
first he mentions how faithful they were to the kings of egypt and instanceth in the fidelity of antipater to julius caesar
for the first they knew the power of the ptolomies continually able to crush them and therefore if some stood to them and proved faithful what did they herein but what their own advantage led them to and what the

necessity of their state required
but how faithful were their kings to the babylonian monarchs to whom they did more then promise obedience would they not always take their opportunity to rebel and because he speaks of their fidelity to the romans how came pray the war with vespasian and titus his son even as before zedekiah had rebelled against nebuchadnezzar and that proved the destruction of the city so came it also to pass the last time
it was an opinion strong in those days through the east that jewry should bring forth the monarch of the world in confidence of this

the jews rebel slay the governor put to flight the of syria vespasian is chosen general against them there is chosen emperor and so the roman writers account that saying to be fulfilled and then titus is sent into judaea and finisheth the work begun by his father
how faithful they were in adrians time we shewed before in the introduction how they behaved themselves also in egypt cyrene and cyprus

then the rabbi instanceth some particular places and persons as the jews of bureos who denyed obedience to don pedro de cruel who had killed his brother how many jews were made tutors to noblemens children of samuel alvalensi the jews carriage at the besieging of mantua and in the signory of brasil
these were but a few if twenty times more in comparison of the nature and carriage of the whole nation which how faithful it hath been generally to the people in all places hath already been sufficiently discovered
to insist no more upon these few particulars

the next last two things he instances as arguments of their faithfalness are rather negative then positive therefore can conclude nothing for his purpose when they were banished by ferdinand isabel out of spain

they made no resistance ergo they were faithful how will this rightly follow and when they were thence expelled it was not for any unfaithfulness therefore to prove their fidelity is as good an argument as the former
if they had had opportunity and sufficient warning though they were half a million do not much question what they would have done
and for their praying which he urgeth for an argument of their faithfulness for the commonwealths wherein they live so perhaps they did when they sent to the prince of babylon to stir him up against christendom when they conspired to fire the city of london when they sucked away the sap of the english prosperity by their extortions when they clipped and coyned money and so rather spoiled this commonwealth did they not then also pray for the prosperity of it

as for any cruelty which might be shewed toward them when expelled out of spain and portugal take not upon me to be a patron of it neither of that which might be exercised toward them by our own ntion whilst here residing
many times they have been used most pittifully but generally in all places they might thank themselves for it their carriage here especially was such as upon the least advantage the people would shew their hatred of it

lastly for to meet with objections made against their faithfulness the rabbi endeavors to clear his countrymen from three aspaersions usually cast upon them viz usury killing children and seducing christians to their religion wish they were but aspersions that they might the sooner be wiped off but that will not be by all the skill their nation hath
was not usury with great extortion their continual practice
what it was in england and italy we have

already seen and that it is used by them in germany

he himself confesseth
their principles of religion do not forbid it then to us though amongst themselves
besides he should have done well to declare what they do in poland prussia and other places especially where they cannot have such opportunity of trading

how they have used christian children enough and too much hath been shewn already it is not good any more to stir that puddle

not only do our own authors affirm this but forreign writers testifie the same also to have been done in divers places whose authority to question more then that of manana of the chronicles of the xantes and others vvhich he brings as testimonies of their faithfulness to which particulars we have already answered it's neither ingenuity nor modestie to do it

for their perswading christians to their religion we know it to be the practice as the ambition of all parties to draw as many as they can in safety unto them nay many further venture then stands with their safety
novv for the rabbi to perswade us that this is not their desire especially meeting vvith such as may easily be dravvn aside he cannot but be convinced of its impossibility
this vvas the cause for vvhich they were banished granada and spain by ferdinand and isabel having seduced some noblemen of the kingdom of andaluzie vvhich he confesseth
and for their dravving christians to their religion see the rabbi himself in a book published called the hope of israel sect
where he instanceth those of

his religion vvho attempted to draw even the then pope charls the fifth emperour and francis the first to judaism
see also sect

the third and last motive for their proposed by the rabbi is the nobility of their stock
his modesty in this is the reason he insists no more upon it it being also sufficiently known to all christians
he might as well be even as modest in his other tvvo and whereas he leaves it to others for that it is said let another mans mouth praise thee and not thine own in this respect he might also better have left the other
for faithfulness is a greater thing then outward extraction and to be commended for virtue is a greater honor then for greatness of birth seeing that virtus est vera nobilitas
indeed they are the off spring of faithful abralam to them vvere committed the oracles of god of them which is more their honour as to the flesh came jesus christ but they have cut themselves off by their rebellion against him they are fallen from the truth and thereby have forfeited their former honour
yet it is the earnest desire of all christians to have them engraffed again into the true stock to which cannot conceive their hither can at all conduce and then their company would be more welcome because over and above what would come in upon the score of christian love their principles would be the safer

now by this time by all that hath been said in way of relation and answer hope the case in hand is not far from being cleared abundantly and that it may be seen what these motives amount to which the rabbi hath tendred to consideration
we cannot but see that the jews at all times have so for the most part behaved

themselves as that they have ministred to the christians occasion of dislike and prejudice and that all the slaughters and massacres of them may be laid at their own doors
here in england they first begun to crucifie children and oppress the people before they were injured to speak on or molested they spoiled the coyn in henry the second his days and yet had the priviledge of burying in all places of their abode granted
the first tumult we read of raised against them was at the coronation of richard the first and that was occasioned by themselves offering to come into the kings house notwithstanding a proclamation to the contrary
and the occasion of the tumult at lin was their endeavour to kill a convert their grievous extortion at stamford york and other places drew upon them the inconveniences that followed
after this the people inraged prosecute them as national enemies yet they leave not off their extortions make it their annual practice to crucifie children conspire against city and people still clip and spoil the coyn as very earnest to undo themselves
the several kings getting gain by the bad usage of the subject only take occasion to fleece them for their miscarriages and make their markets out of the contention raised betwixt them and the natives

we see how they have behaved themselves fince their expulsion how mischievous to this nation in particular they had almost been in the treason of lopez
we see how they have been expelled by other princes and states how these princes that still retain them are more carried by their private profit then the good of their subjects who in all places are weary of them and

how these states with whom they live have particular reasons and interests and have that advantage which we by the small number of merchants and want of conveniency of trading cannot obtain

cannot blame them for so earnestly desiring their reduction
this land is another land of goshen a plentiful land and therefore very desirable in this their long and worse then egyptian bondage but the last experience of our ancestors what guests they were and the testimonies of other nations rather may make us rejoyce they are gone then be glad to enjoy their company any further
such is the antipathy in english hearts against these men derived with some memory of their qualities from their ancestors that though it be now more then years since their expulsion yet not at all doth it seem to moderate or be abated an ill sign of their future agreement if ever permitted to meet again
their memory still remains as a patern of mischievous mindes either apt to do or fit to suffer any violence the very name of a jew serving this people as a perfect measure either to notifie the height of impiety in the agent or to sound the depth and bottom of an abject worthless and forlorn condition in any patient
better we cannot express more dealing then thus none but a jew would have done so lower we cannot prize any one of most abject condition then by comparing him to a jew
for so in common speech men use to exaggerate enormous wrongs
this had been enough for a jew to suffer or would not have done so to a jew

and yet further we shall see there's more in this then ordinary if we look back at what's said and turn over the writings of foreign authors for scarce in

any other countrey hath there been within so little time so many enormities committed by them as in this such opposition and implacable malice shewed by any against them as by this people from the coronation of richard the first to their expulsion
this seems to intimate a more then ordinary repugnancy to each other or some greater opportunity they have in this land to be wicked then in other places
and can we conclude they have left their old qualities their hatred against christ and them that worship him their gripings usuries and cruel oppressions may we not judge them to be the same as before and if their actions be not so enormous as formerly is it not for want of opportunity more by restraint then any change of nature

they were not indeed so much to be accused at first when admitted into this island submitting to the laws not concerning religion and acting according to common rules and orders and so without doubt they might do again till time and opportunity broaching their malice it might be too late to wish they had not been received
if they should act such horrid tragedies over again imbruing their hands in the blood of yong and tender infants crucifying them in scorn and derision of our profession it might be easier to wish them gone then honorable to exile them

their faithfulness is sufficiently known say what they will however always to the true interest of this nation and if they should for better terms play false with the state hold intelligence with the enemies thereof counterfeit the coyn clip the money set the cities on fire would not a safe prevention have proved better then a too late remedy these things have been practised and so may again we have small

encouragement if opportunity should be had to hope the contrary

for their religion we have no grounds but to think them as conceited and stubborn in their traditions as great enemies to christ and christians as their ancestors we hear of few that are really and unfeignedly converted
so far is their reduction from affording any hope of their conversion as we may fear the great cause of their so earnest desire to be received is their ambition to draw others to them
since the time they have been bolder to return hither its more then to be feared they have made many proselytes and that if they might with impunity shew themselves and had toleration of their religion and an open way of their worship granted hundreds if not thousands would then appear who now are veiled under the name of christians

now there is opportunity for perverters to stir matter too much disposed for them to work upon such and so many opinions amongst us which have affinity with their tenents as denying christ in reality though not in words by taking away his natures offices and the real history of him there are but few steps betwixt them and that wherein principally the jews dissent from us
what will not people now believe to what will not this prevailing scepticism bring them placing religion in notions and the power thereof rather in being nothing or any thing then something
unto what an height are our quakers and ranters flown who taking away and destroying all foundations make their own fancies and deluded conceptions originals and rules of truth and so being once poysoned are impregnable
its the policy of satan to gild his pills his emissaries now adays representing

things under another notion then that to which they naturally tend and if the jews should at the first not entice formally to their own way yet they too well know the meaning of that saying the truth of which our religion of late hath sadly felt divide regnes

what they would take as an advantage to seduce the same would prove an obstacle to their conversion truth having such sad entertainment in this world as the brats of her enemy if born near her are always accounted to be her progeny
the devil where there is most of truth is always more envious so also most busie and what he worketh of ill and mixeth with it that he makes an occasion also to raise prejudice against to hide it and conceal it
our present divisions would open the door to receive their harm but rather shut it against any counsel or other means for their conversion
though god knows them that are his and will preserve them that belong unto him yet means are to be used to bring about the end and man not daring to pry into the secret counsel of god is bound to take the most likely way to produce an effect desirable

that the jews conversion draws nigh is a greater truth then that their reduction hither would be a means unto it
it is not probable that this people which hath now been blinde for above years should be restored to sight by any but extraordinary power by any work but one miraculous
its a nation that is rather to be born at once and whose conversion will be as the resurrection from the dead
yet there seems other work that is to be done first it is not probable that they who live under at least the turk and pope should be converted before their

downfall
and if a protestant people be to do this great thing by their enterconrse as some may imagine then there are such places where they inhabite already of which though we may not be apt to count so well as of our selves yet at present they are in a more fit condition to perform it

some there are who taking upon them to know that which was hidden from christ himself as man and the holy angels will point us out the year of the fall of antichrist and the jews conversion divers believing that next year viz
will bring these things to pass
but experience may teach us how to rely upon these predictions some who have determined the times already past for these accomplishments being visibly mistaken and what consequence is there in the nature of the thing that there should be just so many years from the birth of christ to the fulfilling of these things as were from the creation to the deluge doth godty himself to numbers of years and always act according to former presidents but as nothing is more deceitfull then account of time so also is it to be feared that men are generally mistaken in the true number of years from the birth of christ being misled by him that was the author of this aea
it was
years according to the vulgar computation before men used this account measuring their times before that from the building of rome the beginning of augustus by the olympiads indictions of constantine the aera of the martyrs and others so that dionysius the monk who first brought up this account being deceived in the quantity of time that then was past is thought by the most learned chronologers to have missed of the just and full number of years
some say he accounted

above twenty too short others finde four years to have been past over others conclude he missed two

mistaking the true distance of the birth of christ from the battel at actium
now if we add but two years more the foundation of the former opinion is quite removed this present year viz
being the
of our lord and so doubtless at least is to be accounted

to conclude if the jews were here setled already and the nation had sufficient experience of their faithfulness and good behaviour there's none that know would be so cruel as to desire their expulsion or if they were so distressed generally as to give them entertainment would amount to an act of charity their extraction might well move to commiseration and more but seeing they are gone and yet have left such a memorial behind them seeing generally they flourish so and live so happily in other places hope to have written thus much can shew no evil will towards them but that one may safely wish at least the good of ones native countrey and yet heartily desire the real and full prosperity of judah

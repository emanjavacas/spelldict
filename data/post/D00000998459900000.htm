Ah moste dere father great are our miseries but greater are our synnes greuous are oure troubles but more greuous are the wickednesses whiche we moste wretched synners haue committed againste thy fatherly goodnes intollerable are the plagues that be layde vpon vs but those thorow oure vnthankefulnes and wicked lyninge (we frely confessed) haue we mooste worthely deserued whiche haue so ofte the very tormentes of hell fyre alas wretches that we are and yet are we compelled euen of necessitie (for vayne is the
helpe that commeth from man yea cursed be he that putteth his truste in man maketh flesh his arme) to fle for soccoure vnto the whome we haue so ofte so greuously offended whose righteousnes notwithsta~+ding in synners whan we beholde we begynne to despayre and too caste awaye all hope but whann we beholde thy mercy setforth in the precious bloude of thy moste dere sonne Christe Iesu oure Lorde we take a good harte vnto vs and setting before our eyes thy moste louinge swete and fatherly promises in hearing vs
for Christes sake we are encouraged to beleue that although our synnes be neuer so great and greuous neuer so abhominable and intollerable we were neuer so wicked and filthy synners yet for thy mercies sake for thy promise sake for thy names sake yea for thy dere christes sake thou wilt mercifully heare vs and graunte vs oure earnest requestes yea and that so muche the more because the matter is not onelye oures but thyne also agayne seynge we come not vnto the to desyre longe lyfe gold and ryches with the wicked wordlynges nor yet to craue at thy hande wealth pleasure bishoprikes and benefices Deanries Prebendes and such other worldly promo+cions with the swinishe and beastlye Epicures whose God their bellye is but oure
humble supplicacion our earnest request oure hartye desyre is onely that thou wilt consyder thyne owne glory the halowinge of thy blessed name the auauncemente off thy glorious kyngdom the accomplyshme~t of thy heaue~ly wil the honour of thy only begotte~ sonne the settingforth of hys holy Gospel the purenes of the Christen religion the syncere preachinge of thy lyuely worde the true administracio~ of thy wholsome sacramentes the saluacion of suche as thy derely beloued sonne hathe boughte
from the tyranny of sathan with the pryce of hys moste precious and dere hart bloud.
These thinges these thinges (o heauenly fa+ther) do we poore wretches craue and begge at thy merciful hande.
These thinges these thinges· euen with sorowfull groninges lame~table teares do we miserable captiues desyre the to consyder and not so to suffer thine aduersaries to triumphe as thoughe there were no God at all no Christe no Gospell no faythe no true religion but whatsoeuer pleaseth the hypocrites to co~maunde thy people to beleue.
Thou callest thy self a ielous God why than doest thou
suffer thy people thy congregacion thy flocke thyne heritage to be thus seduced ledde awaye from the vnto all kynde of spi+ritual fornicacion and abhominable whor+dome by that Antichriste of Rome greate Baal that stoute Nemroth that
fals prophet that beast that whore of Babylon that sonne of perdicion and by hys abhominable adherentes Cardinalles Archebischoppes Bischoppes Suffraganes Archedeacons Deanes Prouostes Prebe~daries Commissaries Parsonnes Vicares Purgatorierakers Priestes Monkes Friers Chanons Nonnes Anckers Anckresses Pardonners Proctors Scri+bes Officialles So~ners Lawers Massemongers
Ma~monistes Epicures Libertes With all the table of hypocrytes that haue receued the beastes which do not hing els than seke how they may esta+blishe their Antichristian kyngdom by suppressinge thy holy worde and leadinge thy people into all kynde of errours and lyes? Thou callest thy self a Lorde and thou sayeste that thou wilt gyue thy glory to none other nor thy prayse vnto grauen howe commeth it than to passe that thou suffrest thy glory so too decaye in the realme of Englande so many to steale awaye thy prayse and by sayenge their idolatrous and deuelishe masses by
ministeringe a sorte of Heythenish and Iewishe by prayenge vntoo sainctes by blottinge oute of the temples thy holy lawe there written according to thy commaundement for the edifyenge of thy people and by settinge vp in the steade therof Idols and Mawmettes contrary
to thy blessed worde? Thou callest thy self a Lyo~ a co~sumi~gfyre vtter destruccio~ vnto thin aduersaries whi suffereth thou tha~ these Antichristes thus to ryse rage agai~st the testame~t of thy most dere sonne to beat doune thy trueth to call thy holy lawe heresy to banishe the preachinge of the Gospel the true of
the Sacramentes to seke the destruccio~ of so many as vnfaynedly loue the and thy blessed worde.
that is to saye thy faithfull congregacion shalbe confounded and broughte to noughte howe cometh it tha~ to passe that the wicked now florish like the grene olyue tree liuing in all wealth pompe and pleasure and thy people whome thou hast sealed with thy holy spirite vnto euerlasting lyfe are moste miserablye entreated some bannised some in pryson some cruellye murthered but all in moste sorowfull miseries and miserable sorowes?
thy flocke from the hande of the wicked shepehardes and that thou thy selfe wilte fede them in moste pleasaunt and swete pastures: ah good God how cometh it tha~ to passe that wher as before thy shepe were with the confortable meate of thy glorious gospel by the ministerie of the godly learned preachers the faithfull shepehardes are driuen awaye and a rable of rauening
wolfes are into the shepefolde which spare not the flocke but cruelly mur+der not ouly their bodies by hanging heading and brenning them but their also by teaching them wicked
Thy moste dere sonne bothe promised prophecied that euery plante whiche thou the heauenly father haste not planted be plucked vp by the rootes but we se it otherwise
For suche plantes as the deuill and hys chaplens had planted were thorowe the diligence and godly zele of thy seruaun+tes kynge Henry the eyghte and kyng Edward the syxte moste blessedly plucked vp and thy holy ordinaunces agayne planted vnto the greate ioye and vnspeakeable conforte of all the faithfull.
But now thorow the tyranny and blynde zele of certayne are thy blessed statutes plucked vp by the rootes and set in agayn are the damnable decrees and crocked constitucions of Antichriste vnto the excedinge greate griefe sorow and pensyuenes of all faithfull Christians.
Ah Lorde God seme these thinges matters of importans before the eyes of thy maiestie? Can these outragious thi~ges be done in earth thou wincke at them in heauen? Arte not thou he that kepeth Israel?
But he neither sleapeth nor slombreth sayeth the Psalmographe that kepeth Israel.
Aryse therfore Lord why sleapest thou? Is thy eare so stopped that thou canste no more heare? And is thy ha~de
so shortened that it can nomore healpe? Lord arise for thy mercies sake helpe vs. Haste the to deliuer vs for thy name sake for great are oure troubles intollerable are oure miseries.
Ah Lorde vouchesafe once again to looke dounefro~ heauen co~syder the lamentable state of the realme off England of the godly inhabitau~tes therof which desyre nothing so greatly as to se thy true honour perfectly setforth thy holy worde truly preached the Christen religion hyghly and thy holy name sanctified praysed magnified commended for euer.
thy blessinge thou gauest to the realme off Englande a man to reygne ouer it vnder whome the churche was purged of many enormities great abuses the true religion began to haue good successe.
And wha~ it was thy godly pleasure too call hym fro~ this vale of misery vnto thy heaue~ly kingdome thou gauest vnto vs his sonne to be
oure Kynge a Prince althoughe yonge in yeares tender in age yet auncieut in the knowledge of the of thy sonne Christ of thy holy worde as another Iosias altogether bent vtterly to wedeout al fals reli+gion supersticio~ hypocrisye papistrie &c. after a moste perfect manner to set vp thy
holy religion to auau~ce the fauourers of thesame vnto the great wo~derful exa~ple of all Christen princes.
But alas for sorow this most goodly godly Impe this moste Christe~ kyng this noble yo~ge Iosias was for oure vnthankefulnes wicked lyuing taken awaye from vs before the tyme vnto our great sorow vnspeakable hartes disease.
Whose death was the beginning is now still the co~tinuau~ce of all our sorowes griefes miseries.
For in the steade of that verteous prince thou haste set to rule ouer vs an woma~ whom nature hath formed
to be in subieccio~ vnto ma~ who~ thou by thyne holy Apostle co~maundest to kepe sile~ce not to speake in the co~gregacio~.
Ah Lord to take away the empire fro~ a ma~ to gyue it vnto a woma~ semeth to be an eui+de~t toke~ of thyne a~ger toward vs English+men.
For by the thou beyng displeased with thy people threatnest to sette wome~ to rule ouer the~ as people vnworthy to haue lawful natural mete gouernors to reign ouer the~.
And verely though we fynd that wome~ somtime bare rule amo~g thy people yet do we rede that suche as ruled were quenes were for the moste part wicked vngodly supersticious geue~ to idolatry to al filthy abhominacio~ as we may se in the histories of quene Iesabel
to iudge anye creature for vnto the alone are the secretes of all hartes knowne but of this are we sure that synce she ruled whyther of her owne disposicton or of the prouocacion of a certayne wylde bore successor
too Ananias that daubed waulle we know not thy vineyarde is vtterly rooted vp and layde waste thy true re+ligion is bannished and popishe supersticion
hath preuayled yea that vnder the coloure of the catholicke churche and the olde auncient fayth whan notwithstanding darkenes is not more contrary to light nor colde vnto heate than their procedinges are co~trary to the trueth of thy holy worde if the practise and doctrine of the true catho+licke churche (we speake of the Patriarches and Prophetes of Christe and hys Apostles and of so many godly people as lyued from Adam vnto the tyme that Anti+christ the bisshop of Rome set vp his kyngdome
and auau~ced hym self aboue all that is called God) might be the iudge go for payment.
For besydes the geuinge of the kyngdome vnto the rule of a woman Lorde we humbly beseche the to co~sider that outragious floudes of moste greuous enormities haue braste in and ouerflowed the realme of Engla~d vnto the vtter
subuersion of thesame except thy merciful goodnes do the shortly helpe.
of that moste Christen kinge Edwarde the we were accordi~g to thy word to fle with oure prayers vnto the alone in all our troubles and necessities as a Lorde ple~tefully ryche for so many as call on the.
But nowe the Antichristiane Preachers teache that we muste also praye to creatures that are dead that they maye pray for vs or els we praye vnto the invayne and oure prayers shal neuer be hearde.
God and man is oure alone mediatoure aduocate and intercessore.
But now the priestes of Baal teach that Mary Iames Peter Ihon Paule Andrew we know not who are also oure mediators aduoca+tes and Intercessoures and that we muste call vppon them in oure troubles and aduersities whan soeuer we will haue to do with the namely if we will haue our matter go forwarde.
precious bloude of oure sauioure Christe is the alone and sufficient Purgatory for the synnes of all them that repe~t beleue.
But now the papistes teache that there is a purging place after this lyfe where the
soules of the faithful shalbe tormented with fyrye tyll eyther they them selfes haue made for all their synnes by suffering dew punishment or els other in this world haue made ame~des for them by prayeng by synging of tre~ talles by goyng on by dealeng monye by the pepes pardons for their redempcion and suche lyke whan the holy scripture contrariwise teacheth that
the faythful so sone as they departe frome this lyfe go streyghtwayes vnto glorye vnfaythful vnto euerlastinge payne damnacion as we maye se in the historie of the ryche glotton and of the poore man Lazarus.
thy sonne and oure alone Sauiour made vpon the aultare of the crosse whan he suf+fered and dyed for vs so sufficient perfect absolute and consummate oblacion and sa+crifice for the synnes of the people that by that one and alone sacrifice grace fauour mercy forgeuenes of synnes euerlastinge lyfe is for euer and euer plentefully obtay+ned of the for so many as repent beleue.
But now a dayes those massemongers are not ashamed to reproue that swete smelling sacrifice of Christe and too saye that it is not so perfect but that they
also muste offer Christ vp againe dayly in their masses for the synnes of the people that their oblacion is a propiciatory sacrifice and of no les vertue strength might and power than the pashon death of Christ than the sacrifice which Christe hym self offered on the altare of the crosse.
Our missale sacrifice saye the massing papistes is propiciatory satisfactory expiatory and necessary.
Ad salutem, bothe for the quicke and for the dead.
The people syn dayly therefore must we offer sacrifice for the synnes of the people dayly in our masses.
What other thinge is this heauenly father tha~ to defye the death of thy sonne to despyse hys moste healthful sacrifice to set at nought his wholsome oblacion too treade vnderfoote the bloude of the euerlasting
Testament and vtterly too deface bothe the kyngdome priesthode of Christ and to erecte and set vp a new kyngdome and priesthode of their owne a new sacrifice and a straunge oblacion inue~ted of the deuel broughte in by Antichriste confyrmed
by suche as haue receaued the beastes marke and frequented vsed and soughte of all that haue their porcion in that lake that burneth with fyre and brymstone excepte they repent and ame~d? Is not Christe an euerlasting priest?
continew from generacion to generacion? Hath he not with one oblacio~ made for euer them that are Are we not made holy by the offering vp of the body of Iesu done once for all? not Christ after he had offered one sacrifice for synnes syt him doun for euer on the right hande of God and from tarieth tyll hys foos be made hys footestoole? Is not Iesus Christ yesterday and to day and thesame continueth foreuer?
What haue we than to do with the massemo~ or with their missal sacrifice? heauenly father suffer vs not to be carryed about with diuers and straunge learninge.
to beate doune the Idolatrous Heathenish altars which Antichrist of Rome ente~+ding to set vp a new priesthoode a strau~ge sacrifice forsynne co~maunded to be buylte vp as though calfes goates shepe suche other brute beastes should be offered again after the priesthoode of Aaron for the synnes of the people and to set in their steade
in some conuenient place a semely table after the examples of Christ to receaue to+gether at it the holy misteries of bodye bloud in reme~brau~ce that Christes body was broke~ his bloud shead for our synnes.
shame not bothe in their priuate talke in their open sermons spitely to call the Lordes table an Oysterborde therefore haue they taken out of the te~ples those semely ta+bles which we folowing the exa~ples of thy derely beloued sonne and of the primatiue church vsed at the ministracion of the holy co~munion they haue broughte in agayne their bloudy bocherly altars vpo~ those
they sacrifice offer daily say thei that is thei kyl slea murderthy dere sonne Christ for the si~nes of the people.
Where no shedding of bloud is there is no remissio~ forgeuenes of synnes.
If thorow their massing sinnes be forgeuen tha~ must the sacrifice that there is offered be the bloud thereof shead.
If the massemo~gers therfore offer Christe vp in their masses a sacrifice vnto God for
the sinnes of the people so foloweth it that they murder kyl Christe yea shed his bloud at their masses so by this mea~s we must nedes co~fesse that bloudy altars are more mete for such bloudy bochers tha~ honest pure tables.
But we are taughte in the holy schriptures that Christe once raysed from deathe dyeth nomore.
For as touchi~g that he dyed he died co~cerni~g sin once.
And as touchinge that he liueth he lyueth vnto the god his father.
If Christ therfore dyeth nomore tha~ do the papistes sacrifice hym nomore.
If they sacrifice him nomore than are they iangling iuglars their masses serue for none other purpose but to kepe the people blyndnes to deface the and death of Christe and to mayntayne their idle and drafsacked bellies in al pompe and honour with the labour of mens handes and with the sweate off poore mens browes so farre is it of that they with their abhominable massing and stincking sacrificing put awaye the synnes eyther of the quicke or of the dead as they make the vnlearned and symple people to beleue.
Ah Lord God and heauenly father if thou were not a God of long sufferinge and of great pacience howe couldeste thou abyd these intollerable iniuries to much detestable blasphemies whiche the wicked papistes committe againste the thy sonne Christ in their idolatrous masses at their aultares?
Heretofore we were taughte to receaue the misreries of the Lordes bodye bloude together accordinge too the ordinaunce of Christe.
But now no communion is had For the popish and vncharitable massemo~ger vtterly abusinge the Lordes soupper
eateth and drincketh vp~ all alone at his idolatrous aultare.
Heretofore we were taughte to receaue the Sacrament of the bodye and bloude of Christ vnder both kyndes according vnto Christes institucion which sayeth: Drinke of this al ye.
And as the holy apostle saieth: So ofte as ye shall eate of this breade and drinke of this cuppe ye shall remember the Lordes death tyll he come.
But nowe the Romish sorcerers co~trary to the ordina~ce and commaundeme~t of thy sonne the master of trueth yea the~self trueth and contrary to the practise vsage of the primatiue churche like theues robbers murtherers cruelly take awaye fro~ thy people the misticall cuppe of Christes bloude for the mayntenaunce of their deuelish decre and minister after their sorte the Sacrament of thankesgeuinge to thy Christians onely vnder one kynde yea and that without the preaching of the Lordes death repe~+taunce fayth amendement of lyfe &c. and so make they it an idle and dumme ceremo+nie altogether vuprofitable and withoute frute whiche beynge rightely ministred is to the faythfull a Sacrament of greate ioye and conforte.
Heretofore we were taughte that the Lordes soupper or breaking of the bread as
the Apostles terme it is a memorial of the body breaking bloud sheading of our Christ that as we outwardly fede of the breade wyne so we inwardly thorow fayth fede of the blessed bodye precious bloude of Iesus Christ our Lord vnto the greate and vnspeakable conforte bothe of soule and bodye.
But nowe the disciples of Antichrist knowing that the whole glory of their kyngdome lygheth in the sals opinion abuse of this Sacrame~t in all their sermons priuate talke labour swyncke sweate and seke all meanes possible with tothe and nayle with hande foote wyth tunge and pe~ne with fyre and faggot with swerde and halter to perswade the people that after they haue whyspered a fewe Latin wordes with one breath ouer the bread and wyne and haue blessed crossed coniured and handled them after their ghostely manner there remayneth nomore breadde and wyne althoughe we bothese fele and taste bread and very wyne yea although the holy scripture after the wordes of consecracio~ called the Sacrame~t bread and wyne but saye they the bread thorowe the vertue of the wordes whiche we holye annoynted reherse is turned into the natu+rall substaunce of Christes bodye and the wyne is chaunged into the naturall bloude
of Christe onely the of breadde and wyne remayninge whan notwithsta~ding the holy scriptures teach vs in diuers places that thy Christ is ascended into hea+uen and sytteth on thy right hande there shall remayne hys humanite tyll he come too iudge the quicke and the dead.
And after these Capernaites haue bored to perswade the people that the Sacramentall breade is the very true naturall corporall substanciall reall and sensi+ble bodye of Christe euen the selfsame that was borne of Mary the virgine lyued vpo~ the earthe was hanged vppon the crosse dyed for vs than exhorte they the people with all reuerence and humilite to knowledge and beleue it too be their Lorde God theyr maker and redemer their Sauiour and defender and so too falle doune before it to honoure and worshippe it to prayse call vpon it to fle vnto it for soccoure and to looke for all good thinges of it as of the very true and euerlastinge God.
By these means (o heauenly father) they bring away thy people thorow vayne fleshly and sophisticall reasons from the honoringe of the thalone true Imortal muisible euerlasting God vnto the worshippig of a pece of yea of a very idol where as thou alone oughtest to haue al the honor glory.
Lorde aryse and lette thyne enemies be scattered let the~ also that hate the flee before the like the smok vanisheth so thou them awaye lyke as waxe melteth at the fyre so let the vugodly perish and be confou~ded that thy people be no seduced ledde fro~ the way of trueth by their subtile and carnall imaginacions but that thei beynge truely taughte may know the too be the alone true God and whome thou hast sent Iesus Christ.
Heretofore we had in the temples whan we came together to praye and to geue tha~kes vnto the all our prayers thankee geuing in the tu~ge that we wherby we receaued great co~forte were much edified.
But now the papistes (which with thy people to be more rude tha~ asses more biynde than more ignorant than dastardes that they mighte make them there ryding fooles and lauggyng stockes) co~trary too the vsage and practise of the primatiue Churche yea contrary to thy commaundeme~t geuen by thyne Apostle which willeth all thinges in the congregacion too be vttered in suche a speache as all might vnderstande and be edified or els silence to be kept haue brought the matter to this that all English seruice dryuen oute of the Churches thei haue stablished their popish
latin seruice which the moste parte of thy people vnderstand nothinge at all.
yet so cruell malicious are the papistes that they enforce and with violence compel thy people to come vnto their Romish superi+cious blasphemous and idolatrous Latin seruice to heare it to reuerence honoure it with their presence and too call it Gods seruice whan they vndersta~d whither Baals priestes that there bleate mu~ble do blesse or curse prayse or blaspheme.
Moste certeyn is this that thy people are altogether without edifienge spende theyr time in vayn return hom agai~ as vnlear+ned ignoraunte as they came thyther.
Heretofore we had redde in oure temples euery sonday and at diuers other tymes a godly and learned homely or sermo~ and certayn chapters oute of the holy Bible in the Englishe tunge that all the people mighte vnderstande what was done or sayde whiche gaue them occasio~ to forsake and to embrace vertue to lyue in thy fayre and diligently to call vpo~ thy blessed name.
But now bothe those godly homiles and confortable chapters haue thyne enemies the papistes ba~nished out of the te~ples vnto the great discomfort of al such as vnfaynedly the and thy blessed worde in the stead of the~ they haue set vp blasphe
mous collacio~s synging rynging pyping sensynge holy water castinge holy breade palmes and candles bearing crosse kneling bread worshipping fyre and rapers halowing with an infinite number of such lyke Heathen ceremonies that the people beyng occupied with suche chyldishe trifles lousye tradicious and beggarly
ceremonies myghte forget the wholsome foode of theyr soules whiche is thy holy and blessed worde.
Heretofore vpon the Sondayes certayne other dayes in the weke we had the Letanye rehersed amonge vs in oure euery one of vs kneling deuoutly and callynge on the for mercy and grace.
heaue~ly father this was setforth in the tyme of thy seruaunte kynge Henry the and continued among vs vntyl the death of that most godly and verteous prynce Edwarde the syxte and a littel after vnto the syngulare and great conforte of all godly and Christen harted people.
But now the subtile and fleshely haue soo bewyiched the Quenes eyes that whatsoeuer her father and her brother moste godly broughte too passe for the of thy glory for the edi+fyeng of thy people that is vtterly subuerted taken for heresye yea and spitefullye
preached agaynste in open sermons so that this godly mooste wholsome Letanye is not onely taken awaye from vs but in the stead thereof we are compelled to go on precession following an Idoll with synginge Ora pro nobis, Salue festa dies, or some other songe vnto the greate sorowe and inwarde harte breakinge of all thy faythfull.
Heretofore thy Sacramentes were so ministred vnto vs that we receaued greate conforte by them.
But nowe they are so ministred of thys spirituall forcerers that they are become dumme and idle ceremonies altogether withoute edyfyeng or profyt.
For besydes that they are ministred in an vnknowentunge howe be they defyled with mens tradicio beggarly ceremonies? vnto the Sacrament of Baptisme they putte Heatenish rites and wicked coniuracions.
For Baals prieste before the chylde canne be baptised bewytcheth the water shutteth the church doore coniureth the deuel out of the poore you~ge Infaunt bespueth the chylde with his vile spitle and stincking slaueringe putteth salt in the~ chyldes mouth smereth it with grea+sye sauer oyle &c.
And withoute these toyes they make the people beleue that the baptisme is nothi~g worth.
is this any other thing than a laughing to scorne of thy dere so~nes institutio~? Do these papistes by adding their beggarly ceremonies anye other thinge than set thy sonne Christe to schole and auaunce theyr owne imaginacio~s aboue the wysedome of the Lorde Christ?
The Sacrament also of thy dere sonnes body bloude howe haue the aduersaries prophanated and defyled?
thy sonne bothe before and after the ministracion of the Sa+crament preached vnto his disciples.
Thy sonne spake the wordes of the institucion openly in that tunge that all the disciples vnderstoode.
The papistes vtter all thinges in a straunge language yea and that so softely that they scace heare the~ selfes.
Thy sonne ministred the Sacramentes without putting on of any disguysed apparel.
The papistes decke them selfes lyke hycke scorner in game players garmentes.
Thy sonne mi+nistred the Sacrament sitting at the table with hys disciples.
The papistes stande at the aultare and geue the bread and wyne to the people kneling.
Thy sonne gaue the Sacrame~tal bread to the disciples in their handes sayeng: Take eate.
The papistes thrust the bread into the people mouthes as they had not so muche witte as to
Thy sonne ministred the Sacrament of hys body and bloude vnder bothe kyndes to hys disciples.
The papistes do minister it to the laye people onely vnder one kynde and like theues steale the other from them and reserue it to themselfes alone.
The papistes vse no breakinge of the bread as Christe and his Apostles and all the primatiue churche did for to declare the of Christes bodye breakinge on the aultare of the crosse for oure redempcion but they putte into the peoples mouthes a littell lighte whyghte waffer cake speaking to them a fewe wordes in Latin whiche they vnderstande not.
Thy sonne did appointe the Sacrame~tall bread to be broken and eaten.
The papistes kepe it whole and hange it vp in the pyxe yea and carrye it about for a pageaunte in their idolatrous popish pompous processions.
Thy sonne instituted the Sacrame~t to be a memortall of hys bodye breakinge and bloude shedding.
The papistes teache that the bread and wyne is turned into the naturall bodye and bloude of Christe God and manne euen the selfesame bodye that was borne of Marye the vyrgine fleshe bloude and bone so that there remayueth neither bread nor wyne although the holy
wyne remaining the doctors of the Christen primatiue churche testefyed the same in their writtinges the Greke church eue~ fro~ the Apostles tyme vnto this daye haue so receaued beleued vtterly deuieng the popish of reason also all the senses of man testefye that there remayne both bread and wyne after the woordes of consecracion as they vse to terme them yea and experience teacheth that if the Sacramentall breadde be longe reserued it will corrupte putrifie moulde styncke and bredefull of wormes and the wyne lykewise will chaunge the colloure and waxe soure.
heauenly father suche corrupcion can not chaunce too thy de sonnes body bloud which is vncorruptible sitteth on thy righthand raygneth with the in glory for euer euer.
This Antichristian doctrine bles+sed Lorde was not knowen in thy holye Churche pope Nicholas pope Innocent pope Vrbane Fryer Thomas and suche other ministers of Sathan partely with their tyrannye and partelye with their sophistrye as their apysshe adherentes doo nowe agayne in thys oure dayes broughte it in and compelled the Christians with fyre and swearde to beleue thys
theyr monstruous opinion for the mayntenau~ce of their bellye kyngdom although it be neuer so muche contrarie too the artikles of oure fayth and too the doctrine of the holy scripture and of all the aunciente writters.
Thy sonne at hys supper willed the Sacramentall bread and wyne too be eaten and droncken for a remembrau~ce off that one and alone sacrifice whiche he offered on the altare of the crosse for the synnes of the people.
The papistes in their ido latrous and abhominable masses make of the Sacrament a propiciatorie expiatory and satisfactory sacrifice for the synnes off the people necessary Ad salute~, affirming that their acte in the masse is of equal price dignitie vertue myghte efficacie and power before the eyes of thy diuine maiestie with the moste healthfull and swete smellyng sacrifice that thy sonne offered on the altare of the crosse wha~ he gaue hi~ self vnto the death for the synnes of the people.
Thy sonne ordayned the Sacramente too be a signe and token of wha~ the godly come together to eate all of one to all of one cuppe.
The papistes make it Sacramente of dissencion discorde and debate.
For if anye will not agree too theyr wycked and confessynge theyr erroure off
transsubstantiatio~ and that the bread and wyne is the very naturall bodye and bloude of Christe God and man and therefore oughte too be vnto worshipped honored and called vppon as the onely true lyuynge and immortall God they falle oute with them they calle them heretykes they persecute them they apprehende them they empresonne burne them without mercy? And as the wicked papistes prophanate and vnhallowe these twoo aforesayde holy Sacramentes so do they lyke fylthye swyne defyle all other misteries that thy sonne hath ordayned with reuere~ce to be vsed in thy church.
An Lorde God and oure heaue~ly father therfore we were taught too the in spirite and truethe and too praye vnto the euery where lyftinge vp pure handes without wrathe or doubtinge.
But nowe the papistes teache vs to praye vnto the and vnto all the co~pany of heauen with boynge and bleatinge in the quyre with playeng on the organs with sayeng ladies psalters on beades with mumblynge ouer certayne prayers in the tunge that we vnderstande not.
Heretofore we were taughte that thou alone forgeuest vs all our whan souer we earnestly repent and turne vnto the,
teache that they also haue power too forgeue synnes and that oure synnes can not be forgeuen excepte we confesse them vnto the prieste with all circumstaunces.
Heretofore we were taught to looke for all saluacion of the thorowe faythe in the bloude of Christe.
But nowe the papistes teache vs to looke for saluacio~ in our owne good workes in the intercession of sainctes in prayers and merites of synneful hypocrites and beastly belligoddes in ceremo+nies in wil workes in tradicious of men in holy bread holy water holy candels holy palmes holy latine seruice idolatrous masses supersticious Diriges trifelinge trentalles popishe fastinges belles beades &c.
Heretofore we were taught to caste out of our temples the Idols and Mawmettes wherwith many spiritual whordome and ra~ne an whoring and to garnish the churche with the holy scriptures that the people might learne to know to feare the.
But now the vngodlye papistes haue brought the matter to this pointe that the sentences of thy blessed lawe are blotted vtterly wyped out of the temples Idols are there placed manifestlye and directly agaynste thy blessed commaundemente which thy enemies call laye me~s Cale~ders
or bokes as though Lorde God the people might soner be brought vnto the knowledge of the by looking on deformed stones than by reading thy holy blessed worde.
Thy sonne our sauiour Christ co~+maundeth vs to searche the scriptures and not to beholde Idols and Mawmettes.
He that is of god saythe he hearethe the word of god.
He sayethe not he that is of god ru~+eth vnto Images seeth what goodnes he ca~ne pycke out of the~.
He sayeth not my shepe hath a delyghte and pleasure too beholde vayne Idols and mahounde lyke Mawmettes.
Thy seruaunt Dauid calleth them blessed that searche thy testimonies and haue a pleasure too studie in thy lawe daye and night.
For thy holy worde is only the boke wherin thy people ought to looke and not dumme Images carued Idolles which are cursed of the in thy holy law yea the makers of them also.
Ah Lorde God they that haue this procured that thy holy worde should be wyped and blotted out of the churches is it not to be thoughte that their names are blotted and out of the of lyfe Yea is it not too be thought that such Antichristes wold gladly haue bothe the thy holy worde yea thy blessed name so blotted wyped out of all mens hartes that thou mightest neuer be
remembred more but that they and theyr deueli decrees might alone raygne rule ruffle and triumphe makyng all men euen from the hyghest to the lowest their miserable captiues wretched bond slaues: It maye right wel be sayde vnto them as our sauiour Christ sayd vnto the wicked styfnecked Iewes: He that is of God heareth the worde of God.
Ye therfore heare it not because ye are not of God.
Again ye beleue not because ye are not of my shepe.
Ah Lord these chyldren of haue forsaken the thalone fountayne of lyuely water they haue dygged to the~ selfs puddels yea dyle dyrtie puddels that are able too holde no water.
They are such people as co~tinually prouoke the vnto anger.
They are lye~g chyl+dre~ yea such chyldre~ as will not heare the law of God.
They say to the preachers loke oute of the scriptures no good lesso~s for vs.
And to the godly lerned they say tel not vs those thinges that are right neither rebuke our wickednes Idolatry but speake vnto vs pleasau~t thi~ges such as we delight too heare.
Tel not vs of gods a~ger iustice iudgeme~t againste the stifnecked idolators but preach vnto vs fals thinges fables lyes saicts liues out of the golde~ lege~d nar+racio~s out of the festiual exa~ples out of patru~,

The propiciatory sacrifice of the masse the receauinge of the Sacramente vnder one kynde contrary to Christes institucion au+riculare confession &c. Treade oute of the waye go out of the pathe awaye with the holy one of Israel from vs.
We can neyther abyde hys word truly prea+ched nor yet his lawes writte~ in our chur+ches.
Oute with the scriptures in wyth the Idols and Mawmettes.
Lord God are not these the Heathen that haue braste into thyne heritage that haue defyled thy holy temple and made Ierusalem an heape of stones? haue mercy on vs Lorde haue mercy on vs.
we were taughte so to bring vp oure chyldren in the principles of Christen religion that whan they should come to be confirmed of the they mighte be able to saye the articles of the fayth the Lordes prayer and the ten commaundeme~+tes and to aunswere to such questions as are contayned in that shorte Catechisme
which was apointed to be learned of euery chylde before he were brought to be co~fyrmed.
But now the papistes saye to such as are witnesses of the chyldes baptisme: Ye are bounde by the order of our mother the holy church to se that this chylde be co~fyrmed soo sone as is possible or assone as ye heare that the bisshop cometh within seue~ myles of this towne without any furder delaye.
Of the thinges contayned in the godly Catechisme for the righte institucio~ of the chylde they make no mencion.
And what is the confyrmacion of the chyldren that is vsed at thys present but playn sorce rye deuelerye wytchcrafte iuglinge leger demayne and all that nought is? The Bisshop mumbleth a fewe latin woordes ouer the chylde charmeth hym crosseth hym smeareth hym with stinckinge popish oyle and tyeth a lynnen bonde about the chyldes necke and sendeth hym home.
Lord God what a confirmacion of the chyldes fayth is this? Yea rather what a delusion ann mocking is this of the godly auncient custome in confirming chyldren?
Heretofore we were taughte too bringe vp oure chyldren in the knowledge of the thy sonne Christ that euen from the very cradles they might be enstructed in thy holye misteries learn to feare the to beleue page duplicate] page duplicate]
in the to love the to pray vnto the to be thanckfull vnto the to frame theyr whol lyffe accordyng to thy blessed that they myght serue the theyr lorde god in holynes ryghteousnes all the dayes of theyr lyfe.
And for thys purpose had we setforthe a godly learned catechisme bothe in latin in Englysse wherin owr longe ones wer moste vertuously brought vp vnto the gre+ate ioy of theyr parentes the singulare con+fort of al godly Christianes the wonderful encrease bothe of thy glory of all godlynes vertue.
But now the wicked Papistes wyche alway deale extremly wythe the ryghteous and take away theyr laboures
haue condemned that Christen Chatechisme as heresye haue procured certayu
Antichristiane articles from the Quene wherin among to many other a streyght co~mandement is geten that children shuld so be brought vp that they myghte learne to healpe the Prieste say masse wych mass is the very fonntayne and heade sprynge off all i~dolatrye and spirituall whordome.
Ah lorde God shy servannts bothe in the olde and newe testament broughte vp theyr chyldren farre other wyse as the hestories

full for euery maue be he Byshoppe Pris+te Deacon Monke Fryer Chauon Here mite or ani other that haue not the gifte of continencye to take vnto hym a ffaythe full yoke fellowe and with her to marrye in thy feare and to possese his owne vessel
in holynes honore as thyne holy apostle saythe to auoyde fornication let every ma~+haue his awne wyffe every woman her awne husbond.
Agayn maryage is honorable amonge all mene and the bedde vnde fyled.
But now the wycked Papistes those lecherous lubers those fyl thy fornicatours these abhominable adulterers those srynckyng Sodemites those
canckred corruptours of maydes wyffs wydowes those debylyshe despisers of all shamefastnes chastite honeste those mo~strous mai~tainers of all lice~tious lyuyng whordome deshoneste C.
and those synnefull synckes of all fylthy lothesome abhominacions haue broughte the godly and lawefull marriage of ministers and their wyues vnto thys poynt that it is now counte~d whordome.
The faythfull housbandes are taken for whoremongers and their honest wyues for whores.
Yea vnto suche an heyghte is their furious madnes and madde furye groune that they againste all right and conscience against all trueth and honestie do not only moste wickedly deuorce them but they also cruelly compell dyuers of the ministers whiche are faynteharted and where as it semeth but tymelinges seruing rather the time (as the manner of the worldlinges is) than maryeng in thy feare to do open penaunce before the people and to confesse (o the to much corrupt manners of this synnefull worlde) that their marriage was no marriage but playn whordome.
And there those fylthye dogges whiche are returned vnto their vomite moste wretchedly couche and knele doune before the people and desyre them to forgeue them and promise that they will neuermore come in their wyfes company but fro~ hensforth lyue like good and catholike men accordinge to the order of their holy priesthoode that is to saye abstayne from honorable wedlocke defyle
them selfes with all kynde of whordome vnclennes and dishonestie.
Ah Lorde God thou commaundest thy priestes in the olde lawe not onely too marrye but thou also appointest them what wyues they should marrye whiche thinge thou woldest not haue done if the marryage of priestes had bene soo vile and detestable a thinge in thy sight as the wicked fylthy papistes make it.
In the newe lawe also the men whome thy welbeloued sonne did chose in this vale of misery to be his disciples and apostles to be the preachers of his glorious Gospell and the administratours of his holy Sacramentes were not fleshely votaries as the papistes are but honest and godly married men lyuinge with their wyues according to thy holy ordinaunce ud bringynge vp their chyldren in thy feare and after the doctrine of thy blessed worde.
Neyther dyd the apostles put awaye their wyues after they were called vnto the ministery as the lyenge papistes for a colour of their synful lyfe do moste falshly fayne but they continued with their wyues louingly faythefully tyll death departed them as we may se in auncient histories and as it may easly be gathered of the manifest woordes of the holy scriptur.
Haue not we power saieth the apostle to lede about a syster to wyfe
as wel as other apostles as the brethren of the lorde and Cephas? Ether only and Barnabas haue not poure this to do: Here is it evident that thapostles of Criste did not o~ly not put away their wyues after the were called vnto the ministerre as the fals Papistes fable but they also led their wyff+es about with them as theye went abrode? preachyng the gospell of crist.
Rede we not that S. peter continued withe his wife vn+tyl her dyeng day and that whan she was ledde vnto the place of execution to suffer deathe for co~fessyng Christe to be God S. Peter her husbond folowed her exhorted her to be stronge in the faythe of Christe sayde vnto her: wyfe reme~ber the Lorde? oh wythe whatforheade dursie Peter have exhorted men to dwel in howse together
withe theyr wyffes accordyng to their knoulege if he contrary to his knowledge had putte awaye his Wythe what face coulde thapostle.
s. Paule haue made me~cion of his wyffe callyng her his faithe full yoke fellowe desyryng her to healpe the wemen whiche laboured withe hime in the gospel if he beyng vnfaythefull had putte awaye his wyffe co~trary to his promise the lawe of God? If thapostles had putte awaye theyr wyffes after they were called vnto the ministery and preachyng of
to wryghte vnto the Corithians that thei ledde theyr wyffes aboute wihe theme? Yea iff thapostles had putte awaye theyr wyffes howe coulde they haue exhorted other men accordyng to the lawe of God to forsake father mother to cleue vnto
theyr wyffes no man to forsake his wife for any cause excepte it befor fornication.
This their for is but a shadowe of the filthye Papistes to blynd the eyes of the simple and ignora~te.
Furthermore all the holy Bishoppes and ministers of the primatiue chirche were marryed mene or at the least were at libertie to marrye if they wolde.
Agayne the Priestes among the Grekes even from thappostles tyme vnto this day haue euer bene at libertie to marrye neytheyr is theyr ministerye theffror the les estemed of the godly whiche are persuaded by the worde of God that wedlocke is honorable
The maryage of Priestes was neuer for bydden in any place.
tyll Antichriste off Rome broughte it to passe partely by the ti+ra~ny of the seculare power and partely by flatteryng wordes grau~tyng Priestes co~cu+bines whoresin stead off their lawefull wyffes who~ for a~ yerely pe~sio~ they may at their pleasure etheyr kepe stil or putte awaye take anewe.
But heauenly father as thy faithful ser+uaunt Paule prophecied longe before soo is it come to passe.
The spirite speaketh eui+dently sayeth he that in the latter dayes some shall departe from the faythe shall geue hede vnto spirites of errour and deue lish doctrine of them whiche speake fals
thorowe hypocrisye and haue their conscie~+ces marked with an yron forbiddinge to marrye.
This prophecye is fulfylled in that Antichriste of Rome and in his whorish generacion.
For they alone forbid marryage which thing neyther Jew nor Turke nor any Iufidel besydes dothe.
Neyther can the papistes thyfte of this prophecye from them vnto certayn which vtterly condemned marryage.
For the holy Apostle prophecieth of such as forbidde marryage and not of them that vtterly caste away condemne marryage as a thing altogether vncleane and vnmete for a Christen man.
They therfore that forbid the marryage of priestes are by the iudgement of the mooste worthy apostle yea of the holy Ghoste de+parted from the saythe and geue hede too the spirites of errour and deuelish doctrine of them whiche speake false thorow hypocrisye and haue their conscience marked with an hote yron be they Popes Cardinalles Bishoppes Emperours Kynges

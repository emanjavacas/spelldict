TO THE KING MAn beinge allianced, both with Heaven, and earthe, is throughe his corporall necessityes constrayned, to conterate, and spende the best time of his Life, in Sleepe, repose: notvvithstanding being resuscitated, erected out of a profounde, deepe somniation, through the best parte of himselfe, vvhich is his Soule, he pursueth, only and favoureth verye soberlye, the most vile and abiecte thinges, the concupiscence, and apetite vvherof, he communicateth, and participate the, vvith brute, and irrationalle beastes.
For man is not only this maske or vizard, and this figurated and articulated Massa in certayne members, vvhich vvith our eyes vve discover and behoulde, vvith our fingers vve may touche and sensiblye feele: but is rather, the virtue, and internalle for me, vvhich effectuateth life in him, vigor, agilitye, and temperature, the same beinge as it vveare, a radiant beame a little sparckle, and parcell, of the Divinitye, transmitted, and descended out of the most gloriouse Empire of Heaven, to effectuate, and bringe to passe in this vvretched vvorlde, in our bodye, a shorte, and breefe ligatione: For vvho is there vvhich doubteth, that the Sou+le, remembringe, and callinge to minde her first originalle, vvoulde not addresse, and endevoure her selfe to lerne, yea and if it vveare possible to relerne, all those thinges, vvhich be honorable vnto her Creator, might also be profitable to all other creatures? for this cause it is, vvhye vve have not our countenances declined tovvardes the earth as the brute beastes, but have them elevated tovvardes Heaven, because through such contemplacione, and by readinge of the true booke of lyfe, vve might dravve therout, and practice on the ordre, and imitate, the constance vvhich the caelestiall corps, doe observe, and one their perpetualle, and profitable agitatione ther+of.
Let vs therfore consider on the Sunne, vvhich is as it vveare a Prince, and moderatoure of all other caelestiall constellations: vvhat doth shee othervvyse effect through her environing rounde of the earth, then light vs, calefye, and vvarme vs, vivisye, administre lyfe vnto vs? but vvhat commoditye, and profite is it vnto vs to searche the sunne on highe have vve not the earth it selfe vvhich vvith our feete vve inculcate, and treade one, and accuse the same to be brute, insen+sible, doth shee refuse, to receave, and conceave, and agayne continuallye, and vvithout cessation superfluouslye procreate, and liberally imparte vnto vs, all that vvhich is necessary, vnto our vesture aliment, and nourture? It vveare also indeede great shame, perfidiousnes, and execrable disloyaltye, and treason for vs, vvhom God hath adorned vvith so livelye, vigorouse, and fruictfull a spirite, that as all thinges vvhich are inanimate, doc travayle, and laboure for our proffite, vve shoulde shevve our selves stupidouse, and involuntary to helpe the one the other in all thinges possible and advaunce them: for as the vvise, and sage men heertofore have sayed, that even as all the mundayne, and terrestrialle thinges, are created for man, and his vse, in like sorte also are men created for God, and the one man for the other.
This consideratio~ most illustriouse, mightye Kinge, hath vrged, and impelled me, after that next vnto your maiestye, have discharged my duty, and function, vvhich vvas ovvinge vnto your Highnes, and that especiallye in curinge of my Lorde, the Earle, of Montpensier and my Lordes of Buhy, of Montigny, to peruse, revolve certayne rescriptiones, and memorialles, vvhich had compiled, and collected together, vvhe~ served the disceased Kinge, as vvell touchinge the manuall operations, as also the comparisone, and conference of the aunciente instruments of Chyrurgerye, vvith the nue inventede, because through the discourse rehearsall of the same, and by the discriptione and defiguratione of the foresayed instrumentes, to demonstrate, vvhat commodity vve might hope, and reape out of the one more then out of the other: All vvhich, havinge accordinge to mye possibillirye, as much as this pitifull time vvoulde permit allovve of finished, have embouldened myselfe, to consecrate, and dedicate the same vnto your most renoumned Maiestye: vvhom supliantlye vvith all humillity desire, requeste, and intreate, benignly to receave it, as a gifte, or present, vvhich is not disagreeing vnto the present time, nether vvill be discommodiouse to your highnes.
For because this Kingdome of Fraunce, is blinded vvith rage, error, through the fatalle censure of the most fearfull God, doth ruinate it selfe, into his ovvne spoyle, of vvhat arte pray (seinge that all other artes doe decrease, vnder this fear of vvarres) might it rather implore co~fort secourse, the~ of Physicke or Chyrurgerye? And vvhat is more Royalle, more magnificall heer on earth, yea and more divine, then to recreate the afflicted, to relevate, consorte the depressed, humbled, and to restore health to all men, vvithout vvhich all dulcor, pleasantnes of our life is nothinge els then amaritude, and Gaule? VVherfore most magnificent, and renoumned Kinge, permit praye and humblye intreate your highnes, that vnder your Heroicall name, this Pamphlet may be published, because throughe the same, as alsoe throughe youre most illustriouse actes, of the vvhich the posteritye, perpetuallye shall not be silent, may be revealed, and knovvne, hovv fayn your Highnes savve this poore Kingedome of Fraunce florishe agayne: vvhich novv seemeth to respire, and in shorte time exsperateth to have an ominouse and happye end of her miseries, and calamityes, through the prudence vvhervvith your Maiesticall valoure, and vigilant valiaunce is accompaniede, and associated.
Youre most humble, and most obedient subiecte, and servitoure GVILLEMEAV.
THere is a common saying, is novv taken for a common proverbe: that all thinges have theire time, theire place, and theire sayson: by vvhich occasion divers, sundry interprises, vvhich indeede of themselves are goode, doe leese their grace, and decorum, onlye because in theire condecent time they vveare not practised, put in vre.
But it is not soe vvith the vtilitye, vvhich the common vvealth expecteth, throughe our industrye, principallye, especiallye, through the studyes of good artes: such fruictes are never importune, nether at anye time out of season, nether abortive: but are at all times very vvellcome, profitable, on vvhat time soever, on vvhat manner, or of vvhome they might be brought: In vvhich facte, the maxime, or proverbe may very truely be spoken of Maximo Fabio, vvhoe sayede, that all intentions, vvhich to the publiqve profite of the commonevvealthe vveare assayede, inte~ded is allvvayes vvell hopede of, to have a good evente, is esteemede to be a happye intente, or praemeditatione: And contrarily those are esteemede infeliciouse, vnfortunate, are of a funestalle, and sorrovvfull event, vvhich are intendede, and attendede, vnto the dammage of the commone vvealthe.
VVherfore neede not doubte, of that vvhich praetende to mayntayne, and publishe into light, shall of any one vvhatsoever, be taken in badde parte, because have conceavede, and publishede the same in time of iarres, and vvarres: For vvhat time might have elected more convenient, propre, more profitable to meditate one this Chyrurgerye, vvhich compraehendeth her operatione, propre Instrumentes, then at this time, Fraunce beinge in all qvarters, in al partes, armed, in vveapons? animated agaynst her ovvne entralles, vve having our ovvne mindes exvlcerated as it vveare, and hardened the one agaynst the other, by vvhich occasione vve to our greate greefe, and sorrovve, must behoulde, at all houres, so manye poore vvounded, mutilatede persons, their corps beinge vvou~ded throughe the rage, and malevolence of their foes, on the vvhich vve are constrayned to imploy our handes, instrumentes to reduce agayne the same to theire former, and accustomed health agayn? Or vvhat might they othervvyse hope, and expecte of me, then that vvhich is accordinge, and agreinge vnto my vocatione, callinge· For as the Poëte sayeth· The Neptunist of windes, of stormes, and of tempest Discoursinnge on the shoare, to his mates can talke best; The Cerialist, of Oxen, Horse, and Plowes The cruell Martialist, of wounds, and of his blowes.
Therfore havinge seene, and also vvith my ovvne handes practized the space of tvventye yeares the operation of Chyrurgerye, in most of the famouse, renoumned Cityes, of Fraunce, the Lovve Countryes, as vvell one greate, as smalle persons, and that vvith such diligence, and methode, that couplinge, and comparinge, the vse of the aunciente Chyrurgians, vvith the practice of the moderne, and latter Chyrurgians, then endevoured my selfe, as much as the disease, the Patient also vvould permit me, to temperate, the rigoure, and severitye of the first Operatours, or Chyrurgians, throughe the supple, and gentle or svveete dexteritye of those vvhich follovved, to assimilate the~ the one vvith the other, supplyinge in the counterchang, of that vvhich vvas vvantinge in the one, through the dexteritye, and industriouse curiositye of the other, reducinge the same vnto the best forme of beinge, alsoe the vvritinges, or scriptions, of the most expertest Chyrurgia~s, of this prese~t time, vvith the vvritinges iudgeme~t of the vvhole, through the controulinge of the vvritinges of the one of the other: So that have intended to make a collection: in forme of a Manuall for my selfe, to opitulate, addresse my memorye, in time of neede, and promptly to effectuate, any manualle, and not vulgare operatione: but the liberalitye throughe the vvhich am so voluntarye, to communicate the same vnto certayne of my goode frendes, vvhoe are studiouse, desiruose of Chyrurgerye, hath precipitated me into this present prodigalitye, of the vvhich suddaynlye retired drevve my selfe backvvarde, blushing as it vveare ashamed, co~sidering the mea~nes therof, as being vnvvorthy to come into light (although notvvithstandinge everye one hath a vayne imaginatione, affectione, vnto the same vvhich is proceded from him) so that omit the hardines vvhich might have had, to publishe the same vnto the printe, coulde verye difficultly contayne my desirouse, covetuouse handes, of that vvhich vvith greate laboure, dilligence, and throughe longe experience had collected together, to have in one mome~t abolished the same, if had not purposed to reserve the same for my ovvne particulare, and peculiare co~modity.
But my foresayed fre~des debellating agaynst my timorous fearfull defensions, through certayn experie~ce of time passed: to vvitt, that my booke of the diseases of the eyes, after certayne dayes he vvas co~mited to the presse, vvas vnto all Chrurgians verye necessarye, profitable: and that my first, seconde Tables of Anatomye, had administred vnto all men such greate service, and promptitude of the Anatomy, and cognisance of the partes of mans bodye: They have in the end resolved me of my doubtfull feare of prodigality, addinge also therbye that this feare of prodigalitye, coulde be dammageable vnto noe man then vnto me, and that it coulde make noe breach into my credite at all.
Throughe these foresayed remonstrations being convicted, persvaded, vnder the pretexte of greate furtherance, vvhich yonger Chyrurgians might heerby reape, and not beinge possible for me anye longer to resiste, the importunitye of certayne sproutes, beginners of Chyrurgerye, vvho vveare of opinione, that this present peece of vvorcke, vvith all the deformityes therof, might be profitable for them, and beinge certifiede, that if by anye means they coulde attayne them into theire handes, they vvoulde commit the same to the printe even such as it vveare.
So that am constrayned to imploy my selfe certayne hovvres of the day, in correcting of the same and a little more imbellishe, and adorne, the same, vvith portrayctures of mans bodye because the same entringe into the vvorlde, might be effected vvith more favoure, credite, vvherof the tvvo first, doe demonstrate all externall partes, as vvell anteriorlye, as posteriorlye, in the other tvvo, all the superficiall Vaynes, are evidently layed ope~ vnto vs, vvhich as little rivers doe runne throughe the face throughe all other externall partes of the bodye extende themselves as vvell behinde as before, because the same beinge of the yong Chyrurgians noted, they vvith lesse dau~ger might open anye of them.
Farther have enriched this vvorcke, vvith divers defigurations of Instruments, not of all Instrumentes, but of those onlye, vvhich esteemed to be most necessarye: For even as the sage, prudent, and vvyse Nature, hath instituted such an ordre, to mans body, that shee vvith fevv partes, can accomplishe, manye great and excellent actions, In like sorte must the Chyrurgiane, an imitatoure, and administre of Nature, endevoure, and constraygne himselfe, vvith fevv Instrumentes to execute, and effecte, manye, greate Operations.
And to speake the playne truth all this greate companye and treasure house of Engines, Molitiones, and of other Chyrurgicall Instrumentes, are more for curiousity, oftentatione, then for anye necessitye, and vse.
am also verye certayne of that vvhich our Hippocrates sayeth, to vvit, that vve ought not to constraygne, or restraygne, the libertye of our corps, and the Operations, vnto the penurye, and deficience of Instrumentes: but much more amplifie, and enrich the same, vnto the commoditye of the bodye, and ease of the Operations: but vvoulde rather exoptate, and desire, that this vanitye, superstitiouse bravadinge of Instrumentes, vveare ruled vvith more religiouse mediocritye.
Also have made, a greate ample Table, or Index, in the end of the Boock, vvherin through Alphabeticall ordre have illustrated, the most notablest, difficultest thinges, vvhich in the inqvisitione might be an impediment, vnto the vnexperte in the arte of Chyrurgerye, in seekinge of their farther commoditye.
And if so be any man obiecte vnto me, that this my discourse, is onlye compilede together of certayne rapsodyes of the antiqve Chyrurgians: vvillingely heere confes, acknovvledge, that in this Treatise, ther is verye little, or nothing at all of myne ovvne Inventione: For am not the man vvhich liveth by an other mans mutuated supellectilles and rather publiqvely confes, that have collected all this out of auncient Chyrurgians, being greate shame for me to be repraehended, and surprised, of a secrete thefte.
For vvhat noveltyes are vnder the Sunne? as the vvyse man sayeth: And as the Comicus sayeth, vvhat shoulde vve novv adayes say, vvhich hath not before bin spoken? But may at all times vvith veritye say, that am not entred into this matter to sovve, and feminate the same in an infertille grovvnde: For have added ther+vnto greate amendmente, and have eradicated, vveeded out all spinosities, thistles, vvherof they vveare replenished vvith greate difficultyes, seqvestringe on the one syde malevole~t herbes, vvhich choacked the good fruictes of the truth, composinge all thinges in good ordre, to adde thervnto cleernes, and facilitye: throughe the vvhich excellent, moderne, aunciente Aucthors may be vnderstoode of those, vvhich can attayn to the klovvledge of noe strange langvages.
Nether have such Personages, out of vvhich have taken anye of their operationes, observed in all their treatises one ordre, perfectlye, and one manner of operatione, but one divers places, and in divers Bookes they have discribed them: vvherfore they are not to be reprehended, vvho vvith a conseqvence, have redacted them together, because they might the easyer be compraehended, and vnderstoode.
And althoughe those vvhich heeretofore have vvritten of Instrume~tes have co~tentede themselves only vvithe the representation, of the simple Figures: In have heer endevoured to present dimensions, and proportiones, theire longitude, and crassitude, and so naturallye, that nether the Chyrurgiane, nor the Smithe vvhich vve cause to compose the same might have anye occasione of hesitatione, or doubte, nether fall into anye erroure, of theire commensuratione appropriatinge vnto everye one of them his name in Greecke, Latin, Frenche, reporte also his ovvne opportunitye, and vsage therof. name in Greecke, Latin, and Frenche, and reporte also his ovvne opportunitye, vsage therof· knovve right vvell, that in this vvorcke ther vvilbe some operations of Chyrurgerye vvantinge, and that it is not vvholye perfect: But assure my selfe, that everye man of a good spirite, iudgement, vvill acknovvledge, that of purpose have omitted the same, and that especiallye because certayne operations, therof are not novv a dayes in vse, practise: as is the manner of inscisione of the skinne of the Heade, vvhich the Greeckes call Pericuphismos Also the extirpatione of vvoemens brestes vvhich hange toe long: of the Cauterizinge of the Liver, and of the Mile: of the extractio~ of a stone out of the blather, because my selfe am not therin instructed: Al vvhich operations, permit to practise the right vvorshipfull Mon^sr.
Collo Chyrurgiane at Paris, a personage so rare therin that all Fraunce hath not his like, vvith all dexterity to effectuate such an operatione: In like sorte also Mr. Pineau, also Chyrurgiane at Paris, vvhich is the resplendente starre of Light vnto all the Anatomistes of these times.
Nether doe doubte, that he vvhich dilligently searcheth this vvorcke, that he shall finde anye diffaulte therin: for doubte vvhether that anye curiouse poeple shoulde accomplishe, the same, seinge the Aucthor himselfe coulde not sufficientlye accomplishe the same: But hope, to receave of the benevolent Reader, some excuse, he notinge, and consideringe, that such operatio~s vvhich are verye titillouse can not at one time be begunne, and also at the same time finished, and that it is sufficiente, vvith greate difficulty rightlye to imprinte the same.
VVherfore if this enterprise seeme alienate, and strange vnto any bodye, and they mocked thervvith, certifye vnto them, that envye noe man, vvhich can meliorize the same: And as touchinge those vvhich seeme not to be in the vvorlde for anye other vse, then to censure, repraehende others vvithout vvillinge yea and being able to effectuate ought the~selves, let them iovise, ioy themselves, of their privileadge, as long as pleaseth them, vvhervvith doe not much molest my selfe.
Othervvyse, have vvritten only for the iunior, yonger Chyrurgians, and not for those, vvhich are vvholye and completlye edoctrinized, and search for nothinge els then for a perfection of all thinges: have not exalted my harte so hight, as those severe censurers vvoulde require, and suffise my selfe vvith my accustomed manner, vvith the behouldinge of the commoditye of the Frenche iunioritye, of that vvhich my small vvitte, could set forthe: onlye desire this one thinge of them, that they vvoulde vouchsafe to meliorize the same, as certaynlye knovve they vvell can, and doe not retayne their ovvne commodity therof.
And it vvilbe a greate ioy, and peasure vnto me that therin they surpasse me: shall very vvell knovve to applye the same to my profite, and commoditye, vvhich they throughe theire great labour, and industrye, have brought forth, nether vvill conceale that vvhich of them shall have learned.
And although it be the opinion of the Sages that vve ought not to lightly, thereveale secretes, of Physicke, vnto the common, vulgare poeple treating of such matters, in theire maternall, motherlye langvage, because it might be esteemed of little vvorth, be of all men little accounted of: And although coulde easily, have vttered, and expressed my intente, in latine, yet rather published the same in our French language: And that first of all, because all annciente Learned men, vvhether they be Greeckes, Arabers, or Latinistes, have vvritten al theire doctrine, and experience in the maternall language.
The primates, and princes of Physicke, Hippopocrates, and his faythfull, and fidele interpreter, commitatoure Galen, Paulus Aegineta Oribasius doe vvitnes of the same.
Avicenna, and Averroes, have also done the same, vvritinge in the Arabiane Langvage.
Celsus and Plinius, the firste and they vvhich have only vvritten in Latine, have alsoe done theire endevoure, and have also disired to imbellishe, and eternize, theire Latine langvage, contrye, through the termes, and theoremes of Physicke.
Farthermore also, by hovv much the more a thinge is more commone soe much the more is it better, and by so much the more may this science of all men be knovvne, lauded, and extolde.
The Physicke of Hippocrates, and of Galen, the Phylosophye, of Plato, and of Aristotle, are they therfore obscured or lesse esteemed of, because they vveare vvrittene of the Auncientes in Latine, and Arabicke langvage? And those vvhich of our time, have vvritten, in French Dutch Italiane, as manye renoumnede me~ have done, vvhoe in all sortes have indevoured, to doe some service to the common vvealthe, hade they heere in committede anye thinge vvorthye of repraehension? they vvhich vvrite in vnknovvne langvages, besydes that they are profitable vnto straungers, and to theire onre native soyle discommodiouse, are assimilated and resembled vnto farmers, vvhich vvould rather till, an other mans feelde, then theire ovvne propre grovvnd, to the greate dishonoure, shame, detrimente, of theire countrye, and inhabitantes.
VVherfor most humblely intreate, and obsecrate all men, to receave gratefully, thanck fullye this my laboure, and divine desire, vvhich have to see the iunior Chyrurgians, vvith all their mindes industriously labouri~g to follovv imitate me: if so be it pleased that any more learned ma~ the~ am vouchsafede to perlegate vvith pleasure, imploye a small of their time in the readinge, of my scriptsons, and vvritinges, most courtiouslye desire the~, that they vvould more vvith good vvill, then vvith a spirite, vvhich to narrovvlye espyeth, to repraehende the faultes, vue circumsplectlye note the defaultes vvhich might be therin: Least that through to greate curiositye, and to seriouse subtilty, that same happen to me, as in times passed, happened to the Philosopher Theodosio, vvho turning over the preceptes of Philosophye vvith his right hande fro~ his Anditors, they vvho vvith theire lefte hande coulde also reach him, throughe malice, and impuritye of spirite, turned, misconstrued the same in badde sorte.
VVhich if so by anye meanes can attayne vnto, and knovve that this my vvorcke, (published throughe the importunitye of the iunioure Chyrurgians) shalbe aggreeable, and acceptable, vnto manye, it vvill then administre courage, vnto me, to pursue, and addresse the remanent of my studyes, vvherin am entred: that is, to medidate, and to publishe for the yonger Chyrurgians, all those thinges, vvherby Gods honoure might be increased, and be profitable, for the common vvealth.
Candidus imperti meliora, vel vtere nostris: Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua.
Some men do reade, to reape some good therof, Others to mocke, and hovvlde therof a soffe, It is more ease heerin to reprehende, Then anye thinge therin, for to amende.
SOmetimes vvith my selfe co~sideringe, in the ballance of my cogitations vveighinge, hovv perrillous, daungerouse an attempte it is (most benevolence, benigne, curtiouse Reader) in these times, and ages, omit ether to vvrite, or divulgate anye vvorcke, but to translate it out of one language into an other.
Yet vvoulde not, nor indeede coulde not partely to satisfye the greate importunitye of certayne vvellvvillers of the Englishe natione, and poeple, but especiallye of my reverente master, vvhoe althoughe noe Englishe man, yet assure thee one vvho throughe certayne acqvayntance of English Captaynes in these Lovvcountryes, doth affect all Englishe men, vvoulde heerby shevv himselfe gratefull not onlye vnto them, but to the vvhole society of our Maiestyes subiectes, by incitatinge, as it vveare compellinge me his poore servant heere vnto, obiectinge vnto me my inconstant levitye, vvhoe havinge receavede so manye, so greate benefites of the poeple, studentes in Englande vvoulde not imparte this excellente, exquisite, and perpolite peece of vvorcke vnto them, seinge that also the Printer, vvas so vvillinge to incitate me heere vnto, heere by alsoe expressinge his affectionated goode vvill both to our most renoumnede Maiestye (vvhome God longe praeserve) and her subiectes.
standinge in a dumpe, beinge vvith these obiections mute, Nesciens quid agerem, aut quo me verterem, not knovving vvher to hide my selfe, at the last as one beinge erectede, and suscitatede out of a svvound, feeblely made this ansvver, that it fitted not nether vvas agreinge to my harshe, rude, and illiterate stile to beginne such a peece, of vvorcke, and being noe Englishe man borne might chaunce (as vvithout doubt have) to take Sissiphus his laboure on me, in not vvritinge goode Englishe.
And vvhich is more, least shoulde attribute any occasion of offence to my most reverent brother vvho beinge a Doctour of Physicke, but an illiterate, ignora~t youth applying my minde vnto Chyrurgerye, might suppose me to be so pratchante, highminded that sought to aequall my selfe vvith him vvho through his affectione he beareth to Englande hath also translatede an excellent booke of Physicke.
But at the last being fully resolved of my doubtes, of the~ persuaded, that it vvould of all men be taken, construede to a goode end, coulde not any longer resist their importunate assaultes on the imbicille vvalles of my ansvvers, but they havinge therin made a breach vvas constrayned to yeelde my selfe a captive, acknovvledge them victors in consentinge to their requestes, by takinge this laboure of Atlas on my shoulders.
Therfore vvoulde not vvillingelye, have that this light inconstancye shoulde be obiected agaynste me, for not impartinge vnto thee (most gentle Reader) these my obliterate lines of this experte, excellente, and perpolite Chyrurgiane Iaqves Gvillaemeau, vvhome for his excellentie of his manuale operations assure thee such a one hath never in Englishe binne tra~slated: Behould novv therfore to shevv my selfe greatefulle for those benefites vvhich vvhilome have receavede in this florishinge, blessed countrye of Englande, both in the Vniversitye, and in the other Cityes therof, heere humblelye praesent vnto thee this my firste attempte, vvho althoughe indeede no Englisheman borne, yet bearinge a true English mans harte vnto our Maiestye endevouringe continuallye to shevv my selfe gratefull vnto her, her subiectes.
And althoughe it be more grosse, impolite, then decent, convenient, to ansvver the fine, scoffing heades, vvittes of these times vvhoe allmost can doe nothinge els then scoffe, mocke, floute, at other mens industryes, and labours, yet pray the (gentle Reader) not to eesteeme them all vayne, indecent, and invtile, for Non cuivis homini contingit adire Corinthum, everye man can not have a nose like a shooing horne, that is everye one hath not such a fertile vvitte as they have for acknovvledge my selfe to have but a barrane, vnfrictefulle grovvnde that ther doth nothinge then Filix innascere agris meis, and hovv is it possible then to reape goode Fruictes therof? And knovve (curtiouse Reader that take it to be a godly thinge to publishe such a peece of vvorcke for the ayde, succoure of all yonge Chyrurgians to operate, vvorcke on ma~s bodye, for vvhat more praeciouse thinge is there on earth then man: and if then vve endevour to praeserve, the health of our bodyes it is then necessarye to have such boockes out of vvhich vve may learne the meanes vvherby vve might doe it, have the more vvillinglye translatede the same into the vulgare Englishe tunge because everye one hath not the gift of langvages, although it be not soe exqvisitelye done as it vveare convenient it shoulde, tamen est laudanda voluntas, have done my best indevoure thervnto, for ther vvher abilitye lacketh, my goodvvill notvvithstandinge is to be receavede, and not to be repugnede, reiected.
Nether shalt thou heere (gentle Reader) have any exquisite methode, nor the flovving stile of Demostlenes, and eloquence of Cicero, but a playn common, and vulgare stile for it vvas not of the Aucthor composed in the firste for such me~ as are experte in these operations, but for the commonaltye, and yonger Chyrurgians, that they heerbye might learne the true operations of Chyrurgerye.
If my boulde audacitye, or audaciouse bouldnes shall administer occasione of offence to any man, recurre to that common refuge, vvhich promiseth remissione to him vvhich giveth his first assaulte.
VVherfore if the learned vvill vouchsafe to reade this my first beginning vvithout envye, or malice agaynst me, shall thincke my industrye verye vvellimployede not to have bestovved all my labour in vayne: but if through the harshnes of my illeterate rude stile they are caused to lay it out of theire handes, sight, yet humblely requeste them to take him vp agayn not for my sake, but for his ovvne, vvhoe although defilede, poluted vvith my impolitede stile, yet they may gather in the garden of his exqvisite vvorckes, as fragrant gillovvfers of Chyrugicall operations (I dare avouch) as any ever vveare in Englishe.
And if ther be anye of Momus his partakers, vvhich doe revile, scoffe, floute me, vvho are soe scrupulouse, praeiudicialle, that vvith noe Physicke they can be cured of their criticall dissease, tell them pray thee (gentle Reader) from me, that it is farre easyer for them to repraehende, then to correct or meliorize, and that they dare not for the best cappe they have take such a thing in hande, least they peradventure shoulde fall into the pitt vvhich for other they had made, for there is an oulde, and inveterate proverbe as remember in Latine Quod tibi fieri non vis, alterine feceris, let them (I say) reade this proverbe trust it vvilbe a purgatio~ for them.
VVhat shall say more? for indeed can say nothinge as the Comicus sayeth quod non fit dictum prius, If therbe anye vvhich vvith their Argus eyes, vvill vue, so narrovvlye princke, and looke, for faultes in this my labour vvithout doubte they shall finde faultes sufficient, but vvoulde request them to leave their eyes at home vvith Lamia, vvhe~ they loock for any faultes heer in, spitt in a boxe, the spittle of quippes, quiddityes, cast them behinde some chest of oblivione that they never may anye more be spoken of, and let them not dispise this my poore farthing, for it may be heerafter shall finde my selfe doinge vvith some other peece of vvorcke more excellent.
If therfor (benevolent Reader) vve finde this vvorcke to be acceptable vnto thee, my master shall thinck his motio~ to have binne blessede and happye, the Printer his irritatione commodiouse, and my labours, and industryes vvell bestovvede, and it shall be as it vveare a Calcar vnto me therafter to imploy my selfe vvith the translatione of some other excellent peece of vvorcke.
If not vvoulde frendly desire such as scoffe heerat, to reade, dilligentlye consider these tvvo verses vvhich the Aucthor reciteth, and are these.
Candidus imperti meliora, vel vtere nostris: Carpere vel noli nostra, vel ede tua.
Thus beinge loath to interrupte thee anye longer vvith vayne, illiterate speeches commit thee to the tuition of God thy Creator, his sonne Ihesu Christe vvho vvith his effused blooredeemed thee, and of the holye ghoste, vvho inspireth thee vvith his spirite, continuallye vvishinge increace of all virtues, and longe lyfe vnto thee.
Thyn as his owne, or els not worthye of vitall breath.
A. M. THE THESAVRARYE, OR STOREHOVSE of Chyrurgerye: wherbye are also added Foure figures, or portrayctures of mans bodye: Two of the which doe demonstrate vnto vs, all the externall partes of the same: and the other tvvo, the most visiblest vaynes fit for phlebotomye, vvhich lye dispearced vnder the skinne Throughe Iaqves Gvillemean of Orleans, Ordinatede Chyrurgiane to the Kinge, and svvorne in his Chastelet at Paris.
WE say in Fraunce for an aunciente, verified proverbe: That it is not sufficie~te enoughe that vve doe anye thinge, but that vve doe the same exquisitlye, profitablelye.
VVhich can not vvith anye convenience be excuted or accomplished, vvithout knovvledge of the causes, vvhich doe leade, and conducte vs, to the perfectione of the effect: So that accordinge to the sayinges of the Philosophers, Science is nothinge els, then the knovvledge of that, vvhich vve have in handes, through his proper causes.
Vnto the vvhich all Artificers must endevoure to attayne: throughe the vvhich Chyrurgerye, although notvvithstanding, vve can not attayne to the knovvledge, cognisance of the presente subiecte, the accidentes therof, throughe such occasions as vve have discribede, the same being as it vveare an inferioure science, and dependinge, on the Naturalle, and Physicall sciences: vve ought notvvithstandinge to knovv at the leaste this poyncte, and to observe, and follovve the same, and that throughe the most sensible, and apparent causes, vvhich are Materialle, and Instrumentalle.
VVhich hath movede me to represent, and as it vveare evidentlye vnto all mens eyes demonstrate, not onlye the materialle, and formalle principles, vvherof our subiecte, of mans bodye, is created, and compilede together, but the Instrumentalles, throughe the vvhich vve as by such meanes mayntayne the same in his naturall healthe, as longe as ther is anye health afore handes, and also agayne restore the same, beinge imbecillede, debilitated, through the combate vvhich vve have agaynst the dissease, or sicknes.
Nether to speake truthe is it a thinge conveniente, and seemlye, that anye greate, or vvorthye Capitayne, shoulde assayle his enimye, before he apparantlye knovve him, and have for his ovvne commoditye, and advantage made electione, and choyse of the place, feelde of co~bate, hath ordrede and alsoe armed his souldiours: noe lesse also, must he besiege anye stronge, and fortified Citye, vvithout first having advertisemente, knovvledge, of the most feebleste place of the same, vvher in storminge his souldiers may leaste of all be endamagede, he havinge sufficiente admunitione, to make a breatch.
In like sorte also vveare it greate temeritye, and rashenes, for anye Chyrurgiane, to take in hande anye operatione, of Chyrurgerye, vvithout first of all considering one the subiecte, one the vvhich he intendeth, and purposeth to operate, or vvorcke, convenientlye to situate, and collocate the same, and being fournishede of all his Instrumentes conveniente for such an operatione, therbye to attayne vnto his pretended intente.
humblye reqveste, the most benevolent, and gentle Reader, to have me excusede, although have not collocatede, them in such numbre, as vvillingelye coulde vvishe and desire had, havinge notvvithstanding causede the same to be representede: but throughe the iniuryes of this most disturbede, molestede time, there are some of the Plates (vnto my greate molestatione, and sorrovve,) lost, and coulde not by anye meanes possible so suddaynlye be agayne pourtrayctede, engraved: the vvhich notvvithstandinge in the nexte editione hope to collocate them.

[leaf motif] The discriptione, and originalle of Chyrurgerye, and what the operatione of Chyrurgerye is.
HAvinge vvith my selfe resolved, and purposed to discribe the operation of Chyrurgerye, first of all it seemed expedie~t vnto me to observe these three necessarye thinges.
Secondlye, hovv, and from vvhence, shee hath participatede and taken her originalle, and beginninge.
Concerninge therfore her beginninge originalle, vnto all me~ is it apparent and vve rightvvell knovve, that the inventione, and findinge out of all artes, and scie~ces vvhatsoever, hath bin by all men in such greate estee~, and admiratione (vvhich Hippocrates in his boocke of auncie~te Physick vvitnesseth) that the inventors or aucthors of the same, have bin extolled even vnto the clovvdes, by the vvhich is vvitnessed, and testi+fyed, this inventione te have bin so perpolite, that it vvas adiudgede to be a thinge impos+sible to be discovered and brought into light, by anye other, the~ throughe some God, or at the least, by such a persone vvhich hath bin infused, vvith divine inspiratione: In soe much therfore, if this may be testyfyede of anye artes vvith aeqvitye and right, it may truelye and bouldlye be sayede of this arte of Chy+rurgerye, the inventors, and aucthors of the vvhich, have bin canonisede, esteemede and extellod as Gods, as for example ther hath bin Apollo, Aesculapius, and Hippocrates, vvhoe have had divine honoure and reverence of all me~.
The tvvo first of these aucthors, have allonelye leerned, that part of Physicke, vvhich through externalle medicame~tes, and by inscisions cured the infirmityes, and diseasses of mens bodyes.
By the vvhich playnlye is to be vnderstoode and iudged, that Physicke at those times vvas not as then inve~ted created, or fovvnde out, vvhe~ that Chyrurgerye, vvas sufficie~tlye practised and knovvne in all places: the vvhich Homer testifyeth and vvitnesseth vnto vs in the seconde booke of his Iliades, vvhere he affirmeth that the sonns of Aesculapius, Podalyrus, and Machaon, in the besieginge of Troye have vvith ther handes handelede and cured manye and diuers vvou~ded perso~s vvithout molestinge or troublinge of themselves vvith anye internalle diseasses or sicknesses, as vvith agues, or vvith the plague, the vvhich notvvithstandinge praedominatede and vexede sore the vvhole hoste or campe of the Greeckes: and conseque~tlye Physick and the vse therof beinge knovvne, and in practise, Chirurgerye vvas verye confusedlye ha~deled amongste Physicke.
But for as much that it is verye difficulte a harde thinge to excell in divers, and sundrye artes, and because it is impossible, the vvorcke of Physicke, Chyrurgerye, and Apothecarye for one man to doe, therfore the arte of Chyrurgerye is secluded and separatede fro~ the other tvvo, havinge alsoe her ovvne professors and practitioners.
The vvhich because that it may berightlye vnderstoode, it is to be noted and ob+served, that in the oulde and auntient times, by Chyrurgerye, the thirde parte Therapeuticae vvas not vnderstoode, even as vvee in these times take it, as consequentlye shalbe shevved: But they vnderstoode by this vvorde Chyrurgerye nothinge els, then that onlye, vvhich throughe the operatione of the ha~des is finishede and brought to passe vvher+fore it is yet manifestlye vvritten by the auncie~t professors, that by Chyrurgians vvas nothinge else vnderstoode then certayne servantes, vvhich in those times vveare callede Chyrurgians, not because they had the perfecte science, or knovvledge of Chyrurgerye, but because they earned there sustenance and livinge through the vvorckinge of ther handes.
Novv to conceave aright vvhat Chyrurgerye is, it is expedie~t and necessarye, that vve asce~de somvvhat higher, and industriouslye seerch trye vvhat Physicke is seinge manifestlye that Chyrurgerye is therof seperated and secluded.
Physick therfore is nothinge else (as Hippocrates in his booke De arte vvitnessethe) then a knovvledge, or science, vvhich teacheth, hovv to cure anye sicknesses to frustraete, and annihilaete there impregnable forces, because of themselves they are incurable.
This Physicke agayne hath sundrye partes, of the vvhich the first is Physiologia, vvhich handelethe and treatethe, of the structure and situatione of mans bodye, vvherin is to be regarded and noted on the seaven vnnaturalle thinges.
The secòde is Hygiena, that is a Nource, and fosterer, or praeserver, of our health, vvhich instructeth, hovv vve shovvlde continuallye preserve our presente health, keepe the sovvnde bodye liber, and free from all diseasses, sicknesses: and this consistethe in sixe vnnaturalle thinges.
The thirde is Pathologia, vvhich treatethe of the cause, and occasione of the sicknesses of the accidentes vnto the same, the vvhich three thinges are agaynste nature.
The fourth is called, Simiotica, and treateth of the demo~stratinge signes or toke~s, not onlye of that vvhich is all readye passed, but alsoe of that vvhich is as yet to come, in respec+te as vvel of sicknesse, as of health.
The fifth is Therapeutica, that is the curinge or sanable parte of Physicke, vvhich instructeth, learneth, hovve to repelle and cure sicknesses, and diseases, restore agayne to former health: This praenominated Therapeutica is redivided and agayne dealed in three partes, the first vvherof is called, Dietetica, vvhich teacheth, hovv to ob+serve a sober good diete: The seco~de parte, Pharmacia, vvhich instructed vs, hovv to compovvnde our medicaments.
And the third part is callede Chirurgia, vvhich cureth or helpethe the affected patients through manualle or handlye operation for Chirurgia hath his derivatione of a Greecke vvorde, and is compovvnded of Cheir vvhich signifyeth a ha~de, and Ergo~ vvhich betokeneth operatione: nether may vve by this vvorde Chirurgia not on lye vnderstande, all operations vvhich are onlye effected by the handes, but most of all and especiallye, all that is done, or may be done one mans bodye tovvarde the curinge of all externall diseases.
And as co~cerninge this vvorde operatione, it is nothinge else, then an artificialle and normaticke applicatione, vvhich is brought to passe, and vvrought by the handes, one mans bodye, vvhervvith the decayed health is reiterated, and agayne restored.
And if vve vveare desirous to knovve vvhat the office, dutye of a true chyrurgiane is, or vvhat his operations are, hovv and in vvhat manner he must vvorke, effecte them, and vvhat conditions are expected, at a chyrurgians ha~des, have discribed them fullye, at large in my generall table, and discriptione of Chirurgerye, vvherfore vvil make in this place noe more me~tione of them.
[leaf motif] Of the prognostication or iudgement of woundes Chap.
IT is certayne that the praedictione, or iudgeme~t of vvou~des, yea alsoe the generalle knovvledge of all disseases, is a thinge most necessarye and expedient for a good Chyrurgiane: therfore Hippocrates alsoe estemed it verye conveniente, profitable, that a Chyrurgiane must excelle in the fore knovvledge of thinges, and be apt redye to give iudgement and his opinione of all disseases, because by that he may attayne, and at chiue vnto greate credite, and fidelitye by all men, and havinge on this manner set forth, and published his knovvledge shalbe irrepraehendable, and of all men admired, soe much the safer, &, vvith more providence finishe his vvorcke, the boulder illustraete the operatione of his arte, and give iudgement ther of vvithout anye scoffe, or checke, and be able to give a true reporte, vvhen that by the aucthoritye of some learnede chyrurgiane, or by the aucthorytye of some Potentate, he shalbe therin imployede, ordayned to reporte his opinione, ether of the vvounded persons life, ordeath, haultnes or criplenes.
Even as alsoe the foresayed Hippocrates sayeth in his Porrhet that the Chirurgiane must ende voure him selfe to have a vvise grave gesture, because that if it soe chaunce as he adiudged it shoulde, he might reape honoure, goodvvil, not onlye of the patient, but alsoo of all the circumstants, and behoulders: Contrarilye if that othervvyse it happened or chaunced then he sayed, and iudged it shoulde, and that his iudgemente fayle him, he shal not onlye of all me~ be hated but alsoe be esteemed as an ignorant, sottishe fellovve.
Beyonde all this Galenus sayeth, and testifyeth vnto vs, that by our vpright, and sincere iudgement, by the frendes Kindrede of the patie~te, althoughe he come to dye, vve shalbe liberated, freede from all badde reportes sclaunders, because that throughe the death vvhich consequentlye follovved, nothinge shalbe alleagede agaynst vs.
And for the givinge of such a perfect, and complete iudgement, it is necessarye for the chyrurgiane not to be ignora~t, vvhich partes of the bodye beinge vvounded, easylye, or dif+ficultlye may be cured, vvhich of the~ are praesent death, and in fine, the tokens hovv to knovve vvhat partes are vvounded or hurte, because that out of ther natures, quallityes, dispositio~s, vve may certaynlye hope, or mistruste of theire health, and safetye.
Such iudgemente therfore ought to be taken, out of the verye beinge, and substance, or essence of the vvou~ded parte, alsoe of the vse, the actione, and situatione of the same, there must alsoe be noted, the proportione, and figure of the same vvounde, and the accidentes or other chaunces, vvhich are incident vnto her, consideringe alsoe the complexione and temperature of the bodye, the sexe, the age, on his handelinge, and trafiqve, ma~ner of livinge, the contrye, the constitutione of the time then praesent, and one the time and season of the yeare.
To conclude, all men that have receaved a greate vvou~de, are ether in daunger of death or in daunger of beinge mutilate.
VVe eesteme and accounte the vvounde to be large, for thre occasions: The firste vvherof is, because that through her latitude, or vvidnesse, circumiacente places, shee hath a threefoulde survayinge and measuringe to vvit, in length, brédthe, and debthe, as some there are vvhich be deepe broadlye carvede: or right overthvvarte or crosse vvyse vvholye perci~ge throughe the principalle muscles of anye parte, by the vvhich alsoe somtimes the bones are hevved cutte quite through, broken, vvher+fore some times they must be stitchte, bound and ligated together: or because that the vaynes, the arteryes, or the sinneus themselves, come to be squised and plettered.
The seco~de, co~cerninge the vvorthynes of the vvounded parte, for although the vvounde be but little, in her meatinge yet notvvithstandinge vve esteeme her to be greate, because that the strengthe and actione, of the vvounded parte or member, is verye necessarye for the vvhole bodye 'and for the vvhole lyfe of man, vvhich parte havinge lefte his naturall vse and actione, it consequentlye follovveth that the personne, must immediatly discease dye, as vve may by experience see that daylye chaunceth in the vvoundes of the Braynes, of the Harte, and in the vvoundes of the Liver.
Thirdelye, because that some vvoundes are of a vvorser nature, dispositione, as beinge venoumede, rebellious, and entermingled vvith some badde and dolorous accidentes, vvhich sometimes farre surpasse excell the vvounde it selfe, as it is evidentlye planlye to be seene in the vvoundes of the Ioynctes, vvhich immediatlye, may fall into a verye exceedinge badde estate, because that those partes and places are circumligatede or clothed vvith verye smalle store of fleshe, beinge onlye decked co verede vvith the Tendones, vvith sinnues, vvith Ligaments, that verye tender, and sensible pellicle Perioflium, by the vvhich these partes or members are in more daunger of fallinge into a convulsione of sinnues, into Phrensye, payne, and inquietude, as much as a farre more greater vvounde in anye other parte of the bodye.
Those vvoundes are accounted incurable vvhich doe happen in the Braynes, or in the ventricle of the same, in the Harte, entra~ce of the stomacke, in the Vena Cava, the entra~ce of the Liver, the backe bone, quite throughe the Lunges, in the small guttes, or entralles, the stomacke, the Kidnies, or in anye greate vaynes, or arteryes about the throate.
But these vvou~des vvhich vvil difficultlye be curede are they by the vvhich the Longes, the Liver, the me~brane of the Brayns the Milte, the Matrix, or vvombe, the blather, anye of the greate guttes, or the Middelriefe, are vvou~ded vvith verye small vvounde.
Alsoe are those vvou~des daungerous, vvheras the greate vaynes, Arteryes, vnder the Emunctoria or arme pittes, in the Hockes or be~dinge of the knees are vvounded: and indeed all vvoundes are suspitious, in all places vvheraboute anye greate Vaynes, or Arteryes are situated placed, because that throughe theire effusione of bloede, the vvounded persone is berefte af all his abilitye forces: the vvoundes of the Secrete partes or privityes, and the vvoundes of the Testicles are alsoe by this reasone verye perillous daungerous, as alsoe are these vvhich happen and chaunce to light betvveene the fingers.
There is alsoe greate heede to be taken one the manner forme of the vvou~de: for those vvou~des vvhich chaunce, or come by crushin+ge, or pletteringe, are farre vvorse, then those, vvhich are onlye hevvede, so that it is much better to be vvou~ded vvith a sharpe edgede or cuttinge svvorde, the~ vvith anye other blunte vveapone vvhich is not sharpe.
The rounde or circle vvoundes are vvorste difficultest to be curede, but the certayneste easyeste to be cured, are those vvhich passe by the le~ngth of the fibres right like a linye or line.
The vvoundes of the Hippe, vvhich are receaved in the membranous muscle, are verye exceedinge daungerous, especiallye if it be a thruste or stabbe,or else vvhe~ the apertione of the same is verye smalle, hath noe issue, but it is soe much the vvorse if it soe chaunce ther be anye fracture or separatione of bones, it be vvhere it vvil in anye place of the hippe: so farre forthe as if the vvounde be in anye internalle parte of the Hippe, about the greate vaynes, then the vvounde is passinge exceedinge daungerous, for there ensuethe out of ha~de some greate inflammatione there vnto, conseque~tlye thereafter a Gangraena, or mortificatione: he that happeneth to receave a vvounde in the foremoste parte of his arme, is alsoe subiecte vnto the same daunger of inflammatione, and mortificatione, and causeth great payne trouble, because that those vvoundes most commonlye are praesente deathe.
Novv as much as belongeth vnto the judgemente opinione, vvhich is to be considered noted out of the accidentes of all vvou~des, Hippocrates teaceth vs: in so much as in the greate badde vvoundes, as are the vvoundes of the Sinues, of the Te~dones, of the Ioynctes, of the bones, little or noe svvellinge or inflammatione at all apperareth, illustratethe it selfe it is a verye evell and badde signe, for vvhye, it signifyethe vnto vs that those humors vvhich consideringe the payne shoulde have assembled, packed the~selves that vvaye have circumcinglede themselves rovvnde aboute the vvou~ded parte, have retracted the~selves into some principalle especiall parte of the bodye.
Those vvoundes in the vvhich there appea+rethe anye svvellinge, or tumefactione verye selden or never fall into any Phrensye, or into co~vulsione of Sinnues, because that the venomous humors, vvhich might, ascende dravve tovvarde the Braynes or into the sinuishe partes of the boddye, have congregate and gatherede the~selves together aboute the vvounde: but if that one the suddayne the svvellinge vvithout anye evidente reason, as in example, in the applyinge of anye remedyes, throughe purgations, or throughe phlebotomisinge or bloode lettinge, came to departe vvith dravve it selfe into some other place and that in such, as are vvounded behinde in there backe bone, that persone is troubled vvith convulsione of synnues, through the vvith dravvinge of the matter, into the sinnuishe partes of the backebone:and the vvounde beinge in the foremost partes of the bodye, and the matter of the svvellinge, asce~dinge vpvvardes, throughe the greate vaynes, tovvarde the Braynes, the patient strayghtvvay fallethe into a madnesse Phrenesye: or if soe be that the matter dravve tovvarde the breste, then ther ensue greate intollerable stitches, or Apostemations, because that those badde humors can not by anye meanes possible be consumed or vvastede, but descende sincke dovvne into the co~cavitye of the breste.
And if that the svvellinge novv departinge be of a verye highe redde colloured, that thervvas store of bloode therin, vvhich is descended suncke dovvne tovvarde the guttes, then it necessarylye co~sequentlye fellovveth that the patiente falleth into the Blodye flyxe, or Dysenterye.
As farre forthe therfore as there procedethe anye convulsione of synnues out of a vvounde, especiallye from anye greate inflammatione, that is a signe of deathe, for therbye vve may playnlye, note, marke that the synnuishe partes of the bodye, must needes be hurte, and that the Braynes are in some, or other passione.
If that into anye vvou~des, vvhich have fiercelye bledde anye Spasmus happen, that is a bad signe.
All thrustes of the sinnues, and Tendones, are verye daungerous, and especiallye, vvhen as the skinne and the fleshe chaunce to shutt together, for therin engenderethe a sharpe corrodinge matter, vvhich resuscitatethe and causethe greate intollerable payne, because she can not by anye meannes get issue, out of the vvhich procedethe follovvethe convulsione of synnues, inflammatione, and a Gangraene, or mortificatione.
In soo much as anye especiall and principalle, or Organicke parte, or anye instrumentalle parte, totallye vvholye is hevved of, and sequestred and separatede from the bodye, it can not by anye meanes be restored and cured, because that the blode, and the vitalle Spirites are vvholye exhalated, throughe the greate vaynes, vvhich are cleane a sunder, and that by the vvhich the cure must be done, and the foregoinge health agayne restorede.
The temperature of the boddye, the time of the yeare, the age the handlinge and trafique, and the manner of the patients livinge, the knovvledge of the co~trye are a greate helpe ayde for the prognosticatione of vvoundes: a childe, or a yongema~, vvhich as yet is grovvth vvil better and vvith more ease be healed or curede, then an aged personne: and a stronge ma~, a greate deale sooner then a feeble, and debile person.
leane and sclender persone, vvilbe curedevvith more facilitye, then a thicke, and grosse lived man.
And a sounde bodye farre sooner, then a sicke and corrupte bodye.
That man vvhich laboureth, easier, then a stillsittinge and idle persone.
soberman, farre sooner, then a bancketter, and one that haunte the hoores.
The most conveniente time of the yeare, to cure heale a vvou~de, is in the fore summere or Vernall time of the yeare, or at the least in such a time, in the vvhich it is nether to hotte nor to coulde, because that extreame heate, or extreame coulde,are the enymyes of all vvoundes, and especiallye the changinge of heate, of coulde, vvherfore alsoe the fore vvinter or Autu~nus, is verye vnprofitable for the same.
In some regions and countryes, the vvoundes are ether easyer, or difficulter to becurede: for at Rome, the vvoundes of the heade are difficulter to be curede, then the vvoundes of the Legges, the vvhich notvvithstandinge at Avignon vve finde cleane contarye.
As farre as the vvounded person keepe and continue his perfecte Sence, and memorye nether gettethe anye agues, vve may then assure our selves, that the vvounde vvil quicklye and easylye be curede.
VVe ought not thetfore to discourage the patiente, althoughe, he have an ague by the greate vvou~de, as longe as the inflammatione is yet before hande, and as longe as there engenderethe anye matter.
But an ague is verye daungerous, vvhe~ she issuethe from a small vvounde and especiallye, vvhen she hath longe continuance, after the inflammatione, and supuratione, or vvhen she incitateth the patient vnto Phrenesye.
VVhen the patient parbrakethe against his vvil, greene galle, or immediatlye vvhen he hath receaved the blovve, or at the time vvhile the inflammatione is as yet duringe, that is alsoe a badde signe, especiallye in these vvhich are vvounded in a synnue, or in annye sinnuishe place: But the parbrakinge, or vomitinge, vvhich commeth by the fre+vvil of the patiente.
is nothinge suspicious, especiallye in those, vvhich are vsed to vomitin+ge, if that a man praesentlye after meales, or after that the inflammatione is come, or the vvounde being in the heade, doe not come to vomite.
The Chyrurgiane must vse greate foresight, in givinge iudgeme~t of the vvoundes of the Heade, for the aunciente Chyrurgians, have alvvayes esteemed the~ doubtfulle suspect, because of other badde accidentes vntil the Fifteenth day, and the moderne and, ionge professors, vntill the hundred the day.
The Iurists, or lavvyers, have constituted and ordayned fifteene dayes, for the iudgement of the vvoundes of the Heade, to knovve of a certayntye, vvhether the patient by occasione of that vvou~de came to dye or not or by reasone of his ovvne faulte, or by any other occasione.
Because therfore, that the yonger Chyrurgiane, shall not be over rashe, in givinge of his iudgement, leaste he come te glyde and falle into anye badde reportes, or in anye repraehensione.
As much as appartayneth vnto me, have knovvne some, vvhich have continued in a verye good estate vnto the thirteenth, fourteenth, or vntill the fifteenth day, and then have fallen into agues, and manye other accidentes, by the vvhich they in the end chau~ced to dye. VVee must alsoe note, that all naughtye and badde, accidents most of all publishe themselves, at the full Moone, more then at other times, because as then all maner of moysture grovveth and increaseth more, then in the decreasinge of the Moone, alsoe more in the sommer, then in the VVinter.
The signes and tokens of the deadlye fractures of the sculle, are agues in the VVinter, before the fourteenthe daye, and in the sommer before the seaventhe day: Item, a naughtye and badde colloure of the vvounde: little matter of the same: mortificatione of that vvhich is inflamed: slimye or viscouse consistence of that vvhich is corrupted: drieth ariditye in the skinne of the heade, as it is in a peece of pouldrede fleshe, vvith a brouvvne, leadishe, and blacke colloure, vvhich signifyeth the beginninge of the corruptinge and putrifyinge of the sculle, vvhich the~ vvaxeth ravve, as vve may see, vvhen it is rotten, and grovvne blacke: vvheras before it vvas even and smoothe.
Finallye vve see therin, a pale, and yellovvishe colloure, to vvitt vvhen the foresayede bone is vvholye corrupted rotten, throughe the purulent matter, vvhich vvas suncke to the grovvnde of the vvounde, and vvas there gathered together.
The patient beginneth to rage, he hath little pimples one his tonge, he getteth alsoe convulsione of synnues, one the contrarye syde of the vvounde: some fal inte an Apoplexia vvheron follevvethe deathe.
The Practitioners of our times, have observed in all vvoundes, vvhether allreadye therin vveare a Paralisis, or els therafter happened thervnto: and onethe contrarye syde a Convulsione, or somtimes also in the vvounded part a Convulsione, and in the other syde a Paralisis, sometimes also in both the partes, ether a Co~vulsione, or Paralisis, and somtimes one each syde ether a Convulsione, or a Paralisis, vvithout the contrarye syde beinge in anye sorte thervvith infected.
The goode signes of healinge, in the fractures of the Heade, after that it is trepanede, or els after that the broke~ parcells of bones, are taken out of the Heade, are these namelye vvhen that the Membrane of the Braynes hath her naturalle colloure, and her naturalle motione stirringe: vvhen the engendringe and grovvinge Fleshe is redde.
VVhen that the patient may easylye turne aboute his Necke, and alsoe easylye vvagge his lovver chavve bone.
But in somuch as the Membrana hath noe stirringe, and is blacke, leadishcolourede, lividouse or vvith anye other badde coloure taynted defylede: Then the patient ragethe, vomiteth exceedinglye, falleth into a Paralysis, or in Spasmo, if that the Fleshe of the vvounde be leadishe colourede the necke the chavvebone bothe of the~ sta~d stiffe all these are verye bad signes.
And vvhe~ the vvoo~de, is at a good estate, the~ beginneth the fleshe of the Membrane, or of the sculle to grovve, and to vvax dubble, and filleth all the voyde places vvith fleshe, that have binne open betvveene the bones, yea somtimes covereth even as it vveare vvith pomgranate Kernells the scull it selfe. [leaf motif]The tokens howe to knowe which partes of the bodye are wounded Cap,
TTe vvoundes most commonlye are knovven by ther first aspecte, alsoe sometimes the place of the vvou~de certifyeth vnto vs, vvhat partes are inter+nallye vvounded: But seinge that it often times chauncethe, that these vvoundes', vvhich to our estimatione be not profounde or deepe, penetrate vnto the inter+nall partes, vve vvil heere therfore recite the signes, by the vvhich vve may knovve, vvhat internall partes, vvithin the bodye aré vvou~ded, because ther by vve may knovve, vvhether the patie~te may be cured of them or not.
If soe be that the Braynes or else ther Membrane is vvou~ded, the~ ther issueth bloode out of ther Noses, vvith some alsoe out at there Eares commonlye ther follovveth a vomitinge of choler: some lye almoste out of the memorye beside the~selves that althoughe you call crye vnto them, they give noe ansvvere: others see~ in ther faces as if they vveare afrighted feared: some turne and vvinde there eyes, this vvay and that vvaye, as if they vveare touched stricken by Gods ha~de, the thirde or the fifth daye most commo~lye they fall into madnes Phrenesie other gette the Spasmu~, before they dye: some there are vvhich plucke the medicame~tes from there Heades, soe that the vvounde commeth to lye bare, vvaxeth coulde.
VVhe~ as the backe bone is hurte, or vvou~ded, the~ beginnethe the patie~t to be feéble lame in his synnes, or else he getteth co~vulsione of synues, vvhich is called Spasmus leeseth the sence of feelinge, somtimes the patie~t can nether retayne his vrine, Sperma, or Stole, but of it selfe departeth from him.
If the Harte be vvou~ded, ther issueth out of the vvounde, greate store of blacke, dence, or thicke bloode, especiallye vvhen the right side of the Harte is hurte: But vvhen the left syde of the Harte is hurte, then issuethe out of the vvounde fine subtile redde bloode the pulse of the patie~t is verye debile feeble, variable, is verye pale coloured in his face: The coulde svveate in all his bodye bursteth out, and hath a verye vnsaverye smelle, eve~ as vve may note in other sicknesses of longe co~tinuance.
His handes and feete beginne to be coulde, out of the vvhich present death ensueth.
VVhe~ the Lunges are hurte, the~ breatheth the patie~t vvith greate difficvltye, divers times reiterateth, dravveth anevve his breath as if he there by sought indevoured to doe him selfe som solace co~forte: he voydeth of ten times through his mouth frothye bloode, throughe the vvou~de fayre, redde, vitalle bloode, vvith peepinge hissinge breathe: he endevoureth for the most parte to lye one his vvou~ded syde: others often times erecte them in ther bed vvith out anye occasione: Some lyinge one the vvounded syde, can speeke, but turninge the~selves one ther sovvnde syde are quite deprived of there speeche: sometimis they are bloesinge in ther faces, sometime cleane pale, and at the last issueth out of the mouth of the vvounde greate quantitye of filthye matter, The signes of a vvounded Liver are these; na~lye that out of there right syde they avoyde a greate qua~titye of bloode: Both sydes of the bodye, are as it vveare plucked tovvarde the backe bone: The patie~t is verye pale in his face as if he vveare halfe deade: His eyes are fallen invvardes, and hath intollerable payne, beinge ignorant throughe his impatientie vvhat he shal doe: he ist best at ease vvhen he lye thone his bellye: he hath a verye prickinge stinginge payne, vvhich dravveth tovvarde his breste, and also toevvarde the sydes of the same.
Heavinge and contractinge his shoulders togeather must he breathe, and somtimes throughe, parbrakinge he avoydethe choller.
Hath a verye violent, fervent pulse, he is easylye ince~sed to ire, sorrovve: somtimes he hath an ashe coloured face, his vrine alsoe so~tymes verye bloodye: his stoels like matter, and dye most co~monlye, vvith the Hickcoughe.
VVhe~ the kidnyes are hurte, then desce~deth as it vveare by degrees co~methe the payne into the flanckes, and soe forvvarde vnto the testicles: the patient can verye difficultlye be released of his vrine, he pisseth bloode, or at the least his vvater is bloodye.
Somtimes his vrine is quite retaynede, by the vvhich occasione, the patie~te beinge extreamlye svvollene dieth.
If the Milte be hurte or vvounded, then the bloode issueth out of the left syde of the pacie~+te, is blak of coloure.
The same syde, alsoe the stomacke beginne to be indurated, harde: the patie~t vvaxeth thirstye the payne retracteth it selfe tovvardes the breste, as in the vvoundes of the Liver.
Novv the VVombe beinge hurte the vvoma~ hathe greate payne in her flanckes, in her Haunches, in her hippes: she avoydeth bloo+de partlye throughe the vvounde, and partlye throughe her privityes, after the vvhich somtimes follovveth a parbrakinge of Cholera Others ca~ not speake: some lye out of memorye others vvhich doe not rage, say that they are troubled vvith greate payne in there sinnues, in ther Eyes: vvhen they dravve tovvarde deathe, they are troubled vvith the same accide~tes, vvhich vve have recited of the Harte.
VVhen the middle reefe or Diaphragma is vvou~ded, the~ are the sydes of the patie~t dravvne, shruncke vpvvardes: they have exceedinge greate violent payne, internallye in the backe bone: they have verye retardate bre+athe, and there issueth out of the vvounde frothye bloode.
The entrance of the stomacke beinge hurte the patiente beginnethe to have the hick vp, avoydeth choller: vvhen as he eateth or drincketh, he casteth it strayghte vvay fro~ him agayne: he hath a smalle, feeble, obscure pulse: he getteth a little coulde svveate, vvith a coolinge of all externalle partes.
The stomacke, that gutte Ieiunum, have hoth of them one manner of token, because that there meate drincke issueth out of the mouth of the vvounde somtimes beinge halfe digested, and altered in Chylum they feele a payne, as if a man vvoulde rente teare there Harte out of there bodyes: they gett hardnesse in ther sydes, so~times alsoe parbraketh the patient Cholera, vpvvards throughe the mouth, his spittle is bloodye: betveen these tvvo is noe other difference, then that the gutt Ieiunu~ hath his place situatione somvvhat lovver then the stomacke.
The bladder bei~ge hurte, vve feele payne, in the flanckes: that parte of his bellye a little aboue his privityes extendethe stretchete it selfe: in steade of vrine the patie~t pisseth bloode, or else the vrine issueth forthe of the vvou~de: the entrance of the stomacke is perturbed out of ordre, vvherfore the vvounded vomite Cholera, or at the least are afflicted vvith the hick cough: they beginne to vvax coulde in handes feete, and consequentlye ensueth death.
[leaf motif] Instructione, how to give a certayne reporte of all woundes whatsoever before the ma+gistrates.
ALl such vvhich before anye magistrates, of anye vvou~ded or sicke personne, vvil are disposed to give reporte instructione, shallby noe mea+nes intrude themselfves, befo+re that of the magistraete they shalbe reques+ted therto, sent for, seinge that most commonlye proferede vvitnesse is repraehe~dable: he that taketh such a thinge in hande ought first of all to visite and see the patient, because he might ripelye and dillige~tlye consider of al thinges, namelye especiallye one the greatnes of the dissease, one the situatione, place of the same, not onlye, as the~ may give good instruone, but alsoe, one all occasio~s, on the praedictione fore sayinge of the vvoundes, vvithout havinge vnadvisedlye therin has+ted him selfe: for it is a harde and difficulte matter, to give a perfecte co~plet iudgement of the end of all vvou~des, or other sicke perso~nes, because of the accidentes vvhich might chaunce thervnto, for those vvou~des, vvhich vve doe not esteeme of so~times are occasione of death, co~trarylye those of the vvhich vve expected nothinge but death, are yet notvvith+standinge cured.
VVe knovve, that some ther are cured healed, notvvithstandinge althou+ghe they vveare vvounded in the Membrane or pellicle of the Braynes yea some vvhich vveare hevvede in the substa~ce of there Braynes: as alsoe remember some to have bin cured, vvhich vveare hurte in the luges, in the Middlereefe, in the Liver, in the smalle guttes or e~tralles, the Bladder, the Kidnyes, or in the Matrix or vvombe.
Althoughe vve accordin+ge to the iudgeme~t reason of the aunciente professors, esteeme such vvoundes to be deadlye incurable.
Contrarylye vve se some me~ men dye of smalle and vndiepe vvoundes: vve must therfore in such thinges make a distinction amonge the vvounded for some ther are vvhich are of soo goode a temperature, and state of bodye, that of a greate and large vvounde vvhich in anye other mans bodye vvear praesent dea the, they are cured: contralye there are others vvhich beinge vvounded in anye externalle partes, vvhich are nothinge noce~te or dau~gerous to the lyfe of the patient, vvithout anye penetratione, of the vvhich, notvvithstandinge they chaunce to dye, ether of the badde co~stellatione, or constitutione of the time, or by the refluxione of anye badd humors vnto the vvounded parte.
Althoughe therfore, that some vvoundes are curable, and alsoe of a good constitutio~ dispositione, vvithout anye badde or co~trarye signe therin to be marked, but for all that vve may not give anye absolute iudgement or reporte of the same, but muste onlye say that the vvounde is curable, soe farre forth as there be nothinge praetermittede, vvhich consisteth and belongeth as vvell in the patient as vnto the Chyrurgiane vvhich hathe him inhandes, it belongeth alsoe vnto the circu~stantes, and vnto other externall thinges.
VVe must thefore suspe~de our iudgeme~t, and keepe it in secrete for a season, vvithout givinge anye absolute reporte the first daye, because that the good or badde signes ca~ not soe sone reveale and disclose themselves: vve must alsoe co~sider that all vvoundes must have ther originalle, ther increasinge, and there estate, and duringe this time, seeke by all meanes possible to represse the vntemperatenes, vvhich is fallen into the vvounded parte, throughe the blovve, throughe the external ayre, vvhich striveth vvith nature, agaynst the vvhich nature strengthenethe and fortyfyeth her selfe, to expell and drive avvay the foresayed vntemperatenesse, duringe the vvhich time, vve can not certaynlye knovve, vvhich of the~ shall obtayne the victorye, the~ onlye some time therafter, vvhenas the foresayed vntemperatenesse maketh her selfe knovvne, throughe anye signes vvhich shee revealeth in the concurringhe humors because nature, throughe certayne sygnes, doth demonstrate that shee hath obtayned victorye, and is become the mistresse of that vnte~peratenesse.
These signes and toke~s are especiallye knovvne, by the matter afore ha~d: and because that the purulence or matter, is not engendred the first daye, it necessarilye follovveth that on the first daye, vve give not anye absolute reporte of a vvounde, but must first consider, vvhether it is bent, because that nature one the dayes of Crisis demonstrateth her selfe, by the vvhich vve may iudge of the end of the sicknes.
The first, and certanest daye of the Crisis is, the seventhe, for the fourth, is not indeede the day of the Crisis, but vvel the demonstratinge day of the seaventh, vvhich is the vpright and trevve day of the Crisis.
After the seventh, follovvethe the eleventh, of the vvhich the seaventh is the demonstratinge daye, then the fourteenth daye follovveth, after that the tvventithe, and then the last is the fortithe: For if that before the fortith daye, vve perceave noe badd signes, it is then evide~t and playne enoughe, that the vvounde vvilbe easylye cured.
It is best therfore that vve doe not reporte or give anye iudgement before the seaventh day be passed by, in vvhich time, the accide~tes beginne to reveale the~se her on as the~ vve must have a specia de and care, vvhether ther be more good, then badde accide~tes afore ha~des, or the contrarye, vve must consider one these signes, three manner of vvayes: For they reveale themselves ether in the qualitye of the bodye, of the vvounded parte, or in the livinge, and vitalle in the animaele, or naturalle actions: Or in the excreme~tes, vvhich are common, or in the vvhole bodye, alsoe in the particulare excrementes, vvhich the vvoundes reiecte and repelle from them.
The signes vvhich reveale themselves in the qvalitye of the bodye, are considered, vvhen vve regarde on the figure, and one her coloure: the animaele, and spirituale actions, consiste in the stirringe, in feelinge, and in reason.
The vitall, or the livinge actions, consist in the pulse: and the naturalle actions, co~siste, in the appetite, in the digestinge, and in the expellinge and drivinge forth of the excrementes.
The common excrements of the vvhole bodye are the filthynes of the Nose, the teares out of the Eyes, spittle out of the mouth, or the substa~ce and filthye matter of the guttes, the vrine, or that vvhich vve opvvards parbrake: The particulare excrementes, are filthe, matter, a~d the bloode: in vvhich excrementes, vve must marke and note the quantitye, the consistence, colour, smelle, and sometimes alsoe one the taste: seinge that if ther be more goode, that is soe much the better: vve must alsoe note, that throughe the actio~s vve may best iudge of the forces.
Havinge thus therfore togethere considerede and noted all these thinges, the Chyrurgiane shal be able to geve his sentence and reporte certaynlye, ether of lyfe, or of deathe, of lamnes or criplenes.
THE FIRSTE TREATISE OF THE OPERATIon of Chyrurgerye, wherin is discoursede and handelede of the meanes and vvay hovv te extracte and dravve forth anye alienate thinge out of the bodye contayninge five Chapters; Of the profite, and necessitye that commeth to dravve all alienate thinges out of the bodye.
Hovv the Chyrurgiane, convenientlye and fitlye extractinge and dravvinge forthe the bullet, ought to consider marcke theire diversityes, and in vvhat partes or places they lodgeor are collocated.
VVe ought to extracte and dravve forthe the pellet, or anye other thinges, if it by anye meanes, be possible, at the first dressinge.
And praemeditate, one the meanes, hovv vve shoulde best and convenientest effect the same.
After vvhat manner vve shal dravve forthe those bulletes, vvhich sticke faste in the bones.
Chap. That the Chyrurgiane ought not to be too curious, in extractinge or dravvinge forthe of the bullet.
[leaf motif] Of the necessitye, and vtilitye, of the extractione or drawinge forth of all strange thinges.
AMong&ste all operatio~s of Chirurgerye, the aunciente Chyrurgians of oulde times, have especiallye co~sidered, one the ha~dlinge, vvher vvith all vve most convenientlye, and aptlye, drevve forth out of ma~s bodye all ma~ner of straunge alienate thinges, as are Bullets, Arrovves, and all other sortes of vveapons, or all peeces of brokene bones, and many other such like things as beinge moste necessarye, for this foresayed operatione.
It is a Chyrurgiane full of crafte, That out of the bodye can plucke shafte.
And even as in the vvarrelike affayres, those Capitaynes are esteemed to be moste couragious and valiant, vvhich one the suddayne can beste discerne and knovve ther enimyes. and allure and as it vveare dravve them, forth to their ovvne furtherance, to battayle: oras in chasinge, those hunters are esteemed fittest and expertest, vvhich suddaynelye can discover, or disclose, the harboure of the persecuted deere, and knovveth hovv he may vvith al foresight chase the same: Even so have the Physitions alsoe, had those Chyrurgians in greate estimatio~, vvhich first of all, have founde out that parte of mans bodye, in the vvhich the bulletes, or Arrovves, or anye other alienate thinges have binne hidden and lodged, and vvhich have hadde knovvledge science fitlye convenientlye to dravve them therout: consideringe that throughe there continuance in the same, above al thinges they are cleane contrarye vnto vs vnsufferable, as that vvhich is deade, livinge: so it is a hinderance vnto vs, and especialye to that parte, vvherin the foresayede vveapon, stickethe, and that as vvel of it selfe because that it vvholye, hinderethe the curinge of the vvounde, or else because it bringethe to gether manye heavye accidentes, the vvhich is cause of lamnesse or criplenesse in the vvounded parte: or els causeth the health vvhich vve suppose to have gotten not to be perfecte, and sure, but is subiecte vnto a farre vvorse returne renueinge of the same.
Yet for all that knovve some vvhich are cured, in the vvhich the bullets as yet tarryae in some partes of ther bodye vvit hout beinge necessarye to have searched for the same to curiouslye, or to pluck it out althoughe that vve might easylye have attayned there vnto, touched it, because of the daunger that therof might ensue: as for example, a violent bleedinge throughe laceratione of some vayne, or arterye: anye great viole~t payne, throughe the stretchinge or dravvinge for the of some synnue, or Membranes: An especiallye it is not necessarye, curiouslye to search after such thinges, or to dravve them forthe, vvhich ca~ not rott, or corrupte, as that vvhich easylye, or in time can come to rotte.
But yet it is allvvayes better, that all vvhich is strange and alienate vnto mans bodye, and is contayned in the same, be dravvene therout, then to lett it tarrye therin, because that the health (as vve have al readye sayed) is farre surer, concerninge the dau~ger, that is then present, to cause the cured vvounde agayne to burst ope~, vvhe~ as the bullet, or any such like thinge, co~meth to repraese~t himselfe: or that vve shoulde not be co~strayned to make an apertione anye vvhe+re, vvhether the fore sayed bullet throughe his ponderousnes might chau~ce to be descended.
The Strange thinges of the vvhich in this place vve have spoken, are of tvvo manner of sortes, for they are, ether externall, as Iro~, vvoo+de, bullet, stone, or vvolle: or they are any substance of our bodyes, as anye splinters or parcells of bones, the co~gealed bloode, vvhich vve notvvithstandinge esteme it straunge, because they are separated from our bodyes, and are noe more partakers of our lyfe, or vitall spirites, as they vveare before vvhe~ they as yet vveare all one vvith them, vvherfore they are novve become strange.
My intente purpose is nothinge els, then to describe vnto the yonge Chyrurgiane, the practice, of all bullets, and of al other strange thinges, vvhich might thervvith enter mingle themselves, or thervvith might be crushed to peeces, hovv to dravve the~ out of the bodye: Because in thse our dayes heere in Fraunce ther is noe other shott vsed: seinge that the knovvledge of the extractinge of the same, may easylye leade vs vnto the knovvledge, hovve to dravve forth shaftes, Arrovves out of mans bodye, of the vvhich the aunciente professors have verye copiouslie vvritten. [leaf motif] Howe that a Chyrurgiane aptly fitlye to drawe a bullet out of the bodye, ought to consider their difference, the nature of the parte, in the which it is shot.
THe Chyrurgiane beinge requested and desired to dravve forth the bullet, havinge pearced penetrated some parte of the bodye vvith leaste trouble, hinderance to the patient fitlye, finelye to accomplish the same, because that sometimes they are dravvne forth vvith insufferable payne, shall first of all consider marke, that the daunger consistes, ether in that parte, in the vvhich such bullets are shot, or in the species forms, and difference, of the bullets: it is therfore firste of all necessarye, that he observe, and knovve, the nature and qvallityes of those partes, for some partes vvil more gentlye and softlye be handled, then others: vvherfore he must consider, on the substance, qvantitye, figure and forme, compositione, vnitinge, originalle, temperature, and one the necessitye vse of the same parte.
To the vvhich end purpose, he must note vvhat vvou~des, in the vvhich the bullets have binne shott, are incurable, or difficulte, or easye to be cured, because that vve may admonishe, the frendes, and kindrede of the patiente, of those accidentes vvhich might happen vnto the vvou~de, the bullet beinge dravvne therout, alsoe of the certayntye or feare, vvhich throughe the dau~ger, vve are to expecte, of the healinge of the same.
For first of all Celsus sayeth, that a prudente, and vvyse Chyrurgiane, shall not at anye time take in ha~de, such a patient, for vvhome it is impossible to be curede, escape death, because he administer noe occasione vnto others to suspecte, thincke, that he hath berefte the patient of lyfe, vvhich othervvyse throughe the bad fortune of his vvounds is disceased.
And seinge that the dau~ger is greate, but yet notvvithsta~dinge entermingled vvith some good hope, the~ he shal admonishe the frendes of the patiente, that the matter is heavye, and suspecte, because if so be the arte science, be suppressed, and overvvonne of the dissease, that they should not as then thincke, ether that he hath not knovvne therof, or els that he hath sought to abuse the frendes.
But that such is the office, and the dutye, of a vvyse and prudent Chyrurgiane, also is it the facte of a Runnagate Qvacksalver and deceaver, to make anye thinge, seeme to be verye daungerous, vvhich of it selfe is easye, and light, because vve shoulde thincke, more arte to be in him, then indeede theris.
It is alsoe seemlye, that the Chyrurgiane co~fessinge, the cure to be easye light, doe paune his credit, reputation, because as the~ he might the more vvillinge, thincke one that, vvhich might be most commodious and profitable, to the curinge and healinge of the patient, and that the dissease vvhich of it selfe is smalle, throughe the negligence of those, of the vvhich the patient is kepte, be made noe greater.
To this end Paulus Aegeneta counceleth vs, that if so be, the bullet continue, or tarrye, in anye of the vvorthyest partes of the bodye, as in the Braynes, Harte, Liver, or throte, in the kidnies, bladder, or Matrice, and the signes, tokens of death revealinge themselves vve ca~+not by anye meanes possible convenientlye vvithout greate paynes, dilaniatione of the vvounded parte dravve forth the foresayed bullet, that as the~ vve may not offer to touche it, because that vvithout doinge anye good or furtherance, vve doe not administer vnto the ignorant common poeple, anye occasion, of evell speakinge or blaminge vs.
But allthoughe the issue of the vvounde, be as yet vncertayne, havinge admonished and fortoulde the daunger, vve may vvith Gods helpe take the cure in hande: because that some havinge an Apostematione, in anye of the vvorthyest partes, agaynst the opinione certayntye of the Chyrurgiane, have as yet behelde praeserved ther lyfe: yea vve have alsoe seen behelde some, in the vvhich a par+cell of ther Liver, one parte of the Epiploon, the vvhole VVombe hath fro~ them binne separated, or hevved cutte of, the patient for all this hath binne cured, and praeserved to lyfe.
VVe have alsoe at some times in a veheme~te greate squinantie, perced made an apertione in the throte.
But if soe be that vve suffer the bullet to continue in the bodye, or in anye parte of the same, vvithout extractinge of the same, vvhen that easylye he may be dravvne forth, it necessarylye follovveth, that the patie~t must dye therofe, it might also brin+ge the Physicion, or Chyrurgiane into the name of bei~ge cruell, mercylesse, vvher other vvyse the bullet bei~ge dravvne forth, it might be that the patient might as yet be curede, vvherfore the Chyrurgiane must alvvayes endevoure doe the best he can, vvhen he hath forttoulde, admonished the frendes of the patient, of the daunger, because some times greate fearfull vvou~des beyo~de the expectatio~s of all me~ are cured, vvherfore vve ought not at anye, time to permit or suffer the patie~te vvithout helpe or succoure, vvhere ther is anye smalle hope of beinge cured.
And all thoughe that all thinges of this our operatione fall not out accordinge vnto oure minde, yet notvvithstandinge, must not vve leave to effecte that vvhich this arte science reqvireth, that vvhich our co~science vvitnesseth vnto vs. Above all that the Chyrurgiane must considere, on the vvounded parte, he must alsoe farther consider one the differe~ce, varietye of bulletes, vvhich consisteth, in the matter, forme, qvantitye, number, and facultye of the same.
As concerninge touchinge the matter, althoughe that the foresayed bulletes, most commonlye are of leade yet for all that sometimes the besieged, they that skermishe in the feelds are constrayned to vse tinne bullets, Copper, peeces of iron, steel, peasen, yea alsoe little stones or pebles.
As concerninge the figure or forme therof they are most commonlye rovvnde, although ther are some shotte vvith three corners, some foure corners, some of other fashons.
Touchinge the qvantitye, ther is great difference concerninge the greatenes of the peeces, by the vvhich the bullets are shott.
As for the nu~ber, constitutione of the foresayed bullets, ther are some vvhich shoote, vvith more.
the~ vvith one bullet, vvith some vvhich are fastened the one, vvith the other, vvith little chayned Bullets, vvith hayle shote, vvhich spreade the~selves, in the bodye of a man.
Speakinge of the forces or facultyes, of bullets have not as yet geven anye credite vnto them that sayed the bullets might be poysened, because as yet ther hath binne never a famous Chyrurgiane vvhich ever had a venomous shotte vvounde in hande in these our tymes vvhich hath made anye me~tione therofe, as is playnlye shevved, in the discourse of the disceased the right vvorshipfull Ambrosius Paré, chiefe Chyrurgiane to the kinge his maiestye vvhich hath verye learnedlye discussed as it vveare grovvnded this questione in his boockes of Chyrurgerye. [leaf motif] The bullets, all other straunge things ought in the first dressinge to be drawne forth, soe farre as it is possible to be done: of the meanes how to effecte the same.
WHen that the Chyrurgiane shall have co~sidered, one the parte, also a little observed, one the varietye, difference of bullets, he shall chuse, a cer+tayne nu~ber of instrumentes vvhich co~tinuallye he ought to have by him, especiallye those, vvich he supposeth to be most fittest to dravv forth the fore sayed bullet vvith most facilitye ease.
The vvhich he shall at the first dressinge, vvithout anye longer delaye, vnto the next daye, put in vre and practise: for the bullet beinge dravvne out, shall the patie~t, Chyrurgiane alsoe be freed from great daunger, the vvhich both of them vvith all right ought to desire and longe for.
The bullet may alsoe praesentlye, vvhile the vvounde is freshe greene, be felt vvith the finger, or most fitlye vvith the privet or searchinge iro~ vvithout tarryinge vntill the next daye, because that the vvounded parte, throughe anye concurringe humors, svvelleth out of ha~de, throughe the payne of the vvounde, by the vvhich the entrance of the vvounde co~meth to svvelle, as alsoe throughe the force of the bullet, anye of the Me~branes or Te~dones, beinge brused the foresayed entra~ce of the vvounde, stoppeth: because most co~monlye shotten vvoundes doe not enter right, or liniallye into the bodye, but turninge, alsoe vvith any Membranes, or tendones rovvnde about vvounde, euen ngled, as alsoe the bullet through his ponderousnes, runninge this vvay or that vvay, chaunceth to fall into some hollovve place, vvhich sometimes frustrateth, annihilateth the knovvledge of the Chyrurgiane, so that by anye meanes possible, he can nether touch nor finde him: above all this, the foresayed vvounde, is the seconde day more sensible, tender, then vvhen shee is freshe, as the patient allsoe vvhile that the vvounde is fresh vvarme, is better able to abide the sovvnding or searchinge iro~, or privett: that vvhich is more, the vvounded havinge obtayned noe time to thincke, consider of his vvou~de, his harte beinge as yet puffed vp vvith vayn glorye, is not as yet at the first dressinge, posessed vvith anye timorousnes or feare, as he is in the seconde or thirde dressinge: vvherfore in his frist dressi~ge, vvith more courage, patience, is able to beare the payne, and dravvinge forth of the bullet.
First of all therfore, if so be that by anye meanes vve ca~ nether finde nor feele the bullet, to acomplisshe effecte this vvorke, fitlye convenientlye, vvith the leaste trouble payne of the patient, vve are constrayned to cause the patient to sit or stande, in such a forme, posture, or, collocatione as he sate or stoode, vvhe~ as the bullet vvas shot into his bodye, yea alsoe vvith the same gesture, behavioure, vvhich he vsed: for the chainginge of the forme as vvhen vve fight, or vvhen vve are layed alo~ge, or vvhe~ vve sta~de vpright, or beinge sett dovvne, causeth a greate alteratione, in the beinge, and situatione, of these partes of the patiente, because the vaynes, arteryes, synnues, bones, muscles, may one so manye vvayes fashons be turnede vvou~de, as they have divers vses, actions vnto the vvhich they at fitt, it be ether in the erecti~ge, or in the stoupinge, or in the turni~ge: vvhich often times is the occasione, that altough vve search, feele for the bullet, any muscle lye anye other vvay turned, then it did, vvhen the foresayed muscle vvas pearcede vvith the bul+let, the vvou~de in that place most commo~lye beinge stopt, soe that for the most part the searchinge iron can not enter that place vvher the bullet lyeth: But vvhen vve shall have set the patient on such a manner, as he stoode, or sat, vvhe~ he vvas shot, the~ come all the partes into the same situatione, as they vveare vvhe~ he vvas shott, vvherfore, as the~ the proofe or searchge iron, may passe verye easylye, vvithout any let, eve~ into that place vvheras the bullet lyeth.
And soe farre forth as the patie~t, co~sideringe his greate imbicillitye vveake+nes, hath not the strengthe to sta~de in that ordre, vve must as the~ at the leaste, ether sittinge or lyinge, turne, vvinde him on such a ma~ner, vvhether he sitti~ge or lyinge, in as much as is possible, as he vvas vvhe~ he receaved the shott.
Novve beinge in such a situatione, vve are first of all counceled, if soe be the vvou~de be narrovve, as alsoe all auncie~te Chyrurgia~s teache 'vve must as the~ dilate the vvou~de, because the bullet, or that vvhich is therin, may have a free passage: for ther is nothinge, that causeth more in flammatione, then dilaceratione, or tearinge of the fleshe, vvhe~ as vvith violence vve seeke to dravve out anye thinge out of the vvou~de, vvherfore it is better to ma+ke the, dilatatione vvith a little rasore then vvith viole~ce to teare op the vvou~de: further vve must note, that in the dilati~ge of the vvou~+de, vve chaunce not to hurte anye synnues, vaynes, or arteryes: the vvhich if you perceave, you shall eschevve avoyde the~, or vvith a little blunte hoocke pluk them one the one syde, proceede betrvvixt them, as Celsus in his cap. of his seave~th booke teacheth vs. After that vve sufficie~tlye dilate the vvou~de vve must them search for the bullet or that vvhich is shot in the vvounde, feele first of all vvith your finger, if it be possible, as vvith out doubt it is, the beste searchinge iron in feelinge vve must co~sider vvhat vvay the bullet hath taken, if it be deeper the~ the length of your finger, as then vve must vse ther vnto the common searchinge iron, vvhich must be reasonable thick, and at the lovver end verye rovvnde, for if soe be, it be to sharpe pearceth, and goeth betvveene tvvo muscles, vvith out follovvinge that vvay vvhich the bullet vve~t.
VVhen as therfore vve have certaynlye fovvnde out the bullet, the thirde instructione is that vve dravve him forthe to the effectinge of the vvhich, ther is nothi~ge surer, the~ to dravve him throughe the same place, by vvhich he entered, especiallye vvhe~ he hath not penetrated to deepe, or passed throughe anye greate vayne, arterye, or synnue because the vvay is allreadye made, vvherfore vve neede not make any other inscisione.
Amongst all instrume~ts vvhich ever have vsed, have conte~ted my selfe best, vvith that instrume~te, vvhich vve call, the spoonevvyse, or spoonefashoned bullet dravver, because this instrument, may both be vsed fore a searge iron, a bullet extractor alsoe, soe that as soone as vve heervvith feele the bullet vve may alsoe at that time, plucke him out: but pe+arcinge verye deepe, one the co~trarye syde is little substa~ce, vvithout greate vaynes, vve vvith our fingers may feele the bullet, it is the~ better, rather cou~celed, ther to make an apertione, namelye, on the co~trary syde, of the entra~ce of the bullet, then to dravve the same by the vvay vvhich he entrede, consideringe the greate dista~ce, and space, throughe vvhich he beinge dravvne backvvardes, must of neces+sitye passe bye, as alsoe the payne is farre greaater, vvhe~ vvith the bullet, vvith the instrume~t, the vvou~de internallye co~meth to teare, bruse the Fleshe, the~ vvhe~ by inscisione vve dilate the vvou~de, by vvhich shee is alsoe sooner cured, because that vvhich is cutt, more re easier sooner is healed, then that vvhich through dilaniatione is vvounded: and if it be possible, the foresayed inscisione muste be made right vnder the bullet, but so~vvhat greater then the bullet, because the~ vve neede not dravve him forth vvith anye viole~ce, doe not chaunce to lacerate the vvou~de: This beinge in this sorte finished, vve shall finde the bullet a great deale neerer vnto vs, more easyer to be dravvne therout, vvithout passinge by to great tedious a vvaye, in the dravvinge forth, of that vvay by the vvhich he entered, yea vvhich is more, the vvounde vvil a greate deale sooner be cured, and vvith lesse daunger, the vvounde havinge tvvo issues, to vvit the one vnder, the other above, partlye because shee may receave the remedyes the better, as alsoe co~sideringe the matter, vvhich one both sydes hath her issue, vvhich othervvyse might be retayned, collect or gather it self together in the bottome of the vvounde.
As soone as the bullet is dravve~ forthe, vve must shevve it the patiente, because he may be ioy full gladde, to be released of that vvhich vvas such a molestatione trouble vnto him, and vvas cause of so greate payne, and by the vvhich he might have gone so lange a time vvith payne, vvithout beinge therof cured: vve must endevoure by all meanes, ether by dravvinge him forth, throughe his entra~ce, or else throughe the co~trarye syde of the vvounde, vvell knovvinge hovve to effecte this dravvinge, vvith all fitnes, convenie~ce, because vve shoulde not forsake the vvou~ded, nether discourage him, throughe our longe operatione, or vvorkinge: effecte that alsoe vvith the least payne possible, because that the payne of the vvounded patient therbye, vvhich is greate might not be encreased, for it is to greate a shame, to bringe a vvounded person vvhich bath enoughe to suffer, into greater suffera~ce payne: vve must alsoe dilligentlye note, that vve doe not bye anye meanes hurte anye particulare parte, and especiallye the greate vaynes, arteryes, or synnues, or anye other vitall partes, one the vvhich vve must have an especiall eye, and care: for it vvoulde be to greate a disgrace, shame, thinckinge to dravve forth the bullet to doe more harme, the~ if the bullet hadde stayed therin.
VVe are ofte~ times deceaved, nether ca~ vve alsoe finde the bullet, because he is clothed, vvith cotten, vvith vvolle, or vvith anye other parcells of apparrel, vvhich the fre sayed bul+let, carryeth into the bodye vvith him: or else because the fleshe, or the Membranes vvhich are brused, or vvith violence of the bullet have binne re~te, cover the foresayed bullet.
It is alsoe somtimes evident, that the foresayed bullet, erreth fro~ his right vvay, chaunceth to come somvvhether a syde, into some other parte, yet notvvithsta~dinge, havinge in the passage met vvith anye bone, is for all that removed into some other place, as betvveene anye muscles, betvveene any Me~branes, or betvvee~ anye ligame~tes, vvherfore the Chirurgiane not findinge of the same, searchinge for him accordi~ge to the rectitude of the vvou+de, must turne, vvinde the instrume~t one all sydes, feele vvith his ha~des one the out syde not onlye the vvou~ded parte, but alsoe the cir+cumiacent places, because therbye he might knovve vvhether that the bullet might be su~c+ke: vvhich he shall discerne, and marke, ether co~sideringe anye payne, spa~ninge of the skinne, hardnes, or throughe anye blevvnes or cerulitye, vvhich co~monlye, is noted seene aboute that vvou~ded parte, vvher, the bullet is co~vayed, suncke.
VVe must also dillige~tlye note, that vvhe~ as vve thincke to have founde the bullet, vve doe not rashelye make an insci+sion, before vvea are certifyed of the place of the bullet, and soe dravve him forth of the same: for that Chyrurgiane vveare vvorthye to be laughed to scorne, vvhich ca~ not acco~plishe his praetended purpose after that he hath soe intolleratlye tormented the patient.
Albove all this, vve must note, and marke, vvhether the bullet have trayled nothinge vvith him into the vvounde, as paper, vvoole, cotte~, linne~, or anye thinge els of the patients clothinge, or apparrell, or alsoe anye parcell of the patie~tes armour, or harnas, or anye peeces of vvoode, stones, or iron, vvhich the bullet mightby anye meanes have carryed vvith him into the vvound: as such a thinge might vvel chau~ce, vvhe~ the bullet anye vvhere agaynst a vval, or agaynst ons harnas, on the vvhich the fore sayed bullet chaunceth to rebounde, breakinge, receavinge some smalle parcell of that on the vvhich he plettered, carryeth it vvith him into the bodye: If soe be ther be anye such like thinge, carryed, into the vvou~de vvith the bullet, vve ought to have noe lesse care of that, yea rather more, the~ one the dravvinge forth of the bullet, for such thinges are vvholye co~trarye vnto nature, because they corrupte and rott in the vvounde, out of the vvhich needes, must follovv some great Infla~matio~s, or Apostematio~s, so conseqve~tlye, the vvounde in a lo~ge time ca~ not be cured, vvhich othervvyse might easylye be cured, much sooner, althoughe that the bullet as yet tarryed therine, especiallye if that the bullet be of leade, because that leade, vnitethe ma+keth it self all one vvith our nature.
And perfectlye to knovve, vvhether the bullet have carryed anye such thi~ges vvith him, vve must co~sider, one the harnas, if that be any vvheare torne, or broke~, if it be a mayled doublete, hovv manye mayles ther are vvantinge, the vvhich one that maketh mayle doublets easylye ca~ tell you: vve must alsoe note, the patie~tes apparrell, his shirte, vvhether ther be any greate or small peeces therof torne re~te: or vvhether ther be one, o~lye hole fovvnde ther. [leaf motif]How we ought to drawe forth those bullets which sticke fast in the bones, or in the iunctures or ioynetes of the same: alsoe what we ought to note whenas the foresayed bones are crushed, beaten to peeces.
THe greatest davnger that consisteth in dravvinge forth of a bullet is, vvhen the fore sayed bullet sticketh faste, in anyé bone, or in anye ioyncte betvveene the bones.
If soe be the bullet, sticke faste in anye bone, it is most convenient that as the~ vve dravve him forth, vvith that instrument vvhich vve call Extractor, or Grovvnde dravver vvherof vve must sett the poynt one the bullet, vvi~de it verye fast in the same, vvhe~ it is therin faste, vve must softlye easylye trye, if he vvill not follovve, turnige the handes, this vvay and that vvay, the better to make him loose, and stirre.
But if soe be that vve can not soe soone gett out the bullet vve must then suffer him, to co~tinue therin some certayne dayes, vvith in the vvhich time, the externall fleshe vvill beginne to rotte, throughe the vvhich the vvou~+de vvilbe somvvhat dilated, vvyder, and the bone vvill somvvhat disclose open, duringe the time, vve must everye day stirre the bullet, vvith the instrume~t lift him vp because that thus doinge, the foresayed bullet might by little little be removed Loosed: and if that vve perceave that the bullet sticketh to faste, can not by anye of the fofsayed meanes bedravvne out: then is this the last remedye, that vve quite, cleane pearce and boare throughe the bone, vvith the Extractor or elsi vvith the poynt orpiramide of a Trepane, pearce boare, agaynst, rovvnde aboute the bullet in divers places, because ther may be made some place for an Elevatorium, on that sorte to lift vp the bullet drevve him therout, if that vvith all gentlenes it may by anye meanes possible be brought to passe for vve are in noe vvyse counceled, vvith violence or vehemence to effect it.
And if it be a little and small bullet, that he stick in anye place fast, as in the middle of the greatest focile of the shinne bone, or in the middle of anye ribbe, or in the sternon, or in anye bones of the heade, vve are as then counceled, to trepane that bone, settinge the Trepane on the bullet, soe that the fore sayed bullet, be rovvnde about compassed vvithinthe circkle of the Trepane, and that then the trepane might abolishe and take avvay all that, vvhich retayned and helde fast the bullet.
But vvhen the bullet is any vvhere, in anye ioyncte pearced penetratede betvvene tvvo bones, as for example, in the knees, vve must then as easyely as it is possible, endevoure vvith the instrument to stirre the bullet hether, thether, hut allvvayes strayght forevvarde, novve tovvarde the hippe, and then tovvarde the legge because that therbye vve might the better, vnshutt make loose, vvith the leaste payne that may be, the ligame~tes, te~dones, vvhich co~tayne houlde the ioyncte soe close together: by the vvhich apertione, and dravvinge forth the space, distance be+tvveene the bones, vvilbe a little dilated, soe that at lengthe, vvith lesse payne trouble, vvith the little spoonevvyse bullet dravver, vve shalbe able to dravve forth the bullets.
But if vve feared, least vve shoulde put the patie~t to some intollerable payne, throughe the distendinge of the ligamentes, te~dones, my councell is as the~, that the yonge Chyrurgiane, endevoure, to follovve and vse the same, vvhich did or have vsed on my lorde of Floyon: vvhich in the skirmishe of Maestricht, got a shott in his knee, the bullet lyinge faste, occulte in the iovncte betvvee~ the bones, the vvhich nether I, nor anye chyrurgianes, of Do~ Ihon of the Eeaste, coulde finde, at the last it seemed good vnto me, agaynste the opinio~s of all the reste, vve shoulde shutt foulde together the knees of the patient: vvhich he doinge vvith some payne, the bullet, through the fouldi~ge of the Knees, the bones vvhich placed pressed the~selves together, vvas drive~ therout, revealed it selfe externallye, vnder the skinne, and one the sydes of the foresayed ioyncte, vvher havinge made a little in+scisione, my selfe have take~ the same forth of that place.
In like sorte, if soe be the bullet, have rebovvnded agaynst anye bone, and the bone throughe the viole~ce therof be broke, crushed to divers peeces, the bullet as yet remay+ninge therin, or else havinge pearced quite throughe, it is as then the surest vvay to dilate the vvounde, as farre forth as the vvounded parte is able to suffer, it, that ether in the en+trance, or issue of the vvounde, at the least if it have an issue: the vvhich beinge finished, vve strayghtvvayes vvith the finger, or vvith anye other instrume~te, must search for the spli~ter, and finelye dravve forth, those parcels vvhich vvholye are separated fro~ the bone, alsoe in like sorte, the bullet, if soe be as yet he sticketh therine: if that ther vveare anye greate peeces, or parcells of the bone, vvhich as yet are not vvholye separated fro~ the bone, but are yet fastened vvithe the Periostium, or the ligamentes, vve must not vvith anye viole~ce dravve the~ forthe, because throughe such viole~ce vve might vrge great payne convulsione of synnues, vvherfore it is farre beter to place situate them by the bone, on the vvhich as yet they are halfe fastened: For nature, expellethe them most co~monlye vvithe the matter forth of the vvounde, vvithout anye payne, they separate alsoe fro~ the bone, throughe the increasinghe of the nevve fleshe, the vvhich repelleth the same from him, or els in time they conioyne themselves together, and are soe agayne cured, as have of te~ times knovvne the same to chaunce, and as yet in freshe memorye, Monsr. de la Tour, ordinated and chosen gentleman of the kinges chamber of presence, vvhich in the Baricades, or Tre~ches of Parris, got a shot in his left legge, the entrance vvherof vvas in the oppermoste part of his shinne bone, breakinge the least focile, in divers peeces, of the vvhich also one peece of the same focile came forthe, through the aper+tione, vvhich the foresayed peece, throughe the violence, blovve of the bullet, had made himselfe, vvhich cleanlye pearced througe the Muscles called Gemini Solores, vvherfore m'Habricot, Barber Chyrurgia~ at Parris, made an inscisione in the foresayede muscles partlye to extracte dravve forth those splinters forth of the same, partlye, to restore agayne those broke~ peeces of bones, into the vvounde, vvhich as yet vveare not separated fro~ the Periostium and is in the space of tvvo moneths agayne cured, the foresayed peeces of bones beinge therin verye sovvndelye healed, and alsoe have treated him vntill such time as he vvas vvholye fullye cured.
So~times the bullet pearceth cleane throughe, som cartilage or grisselye parte, or throughe some Tendones, vvhich beinge softer the~ the bone, doth not breake, but onlye splitteth asunder or bendeth it selfe, as soone as the bullet is passed bye, erecteth it selfe agayne, occludeth, the passage, vvher vnder the bullet hide the himselfe, the vvhich, al thoughe vve endevoure to search for vvith our fingers or searchinge iron, it for al that is impossible vve shoulde finde him, vvhich co~monlye chaunceth in the vvou~des of the breste, vvhe~ as the brest bone is pearced.
As remember such to have chaunced, in my lorde of Malicorne beinge vvounded, hurte before Maillezes in Poittou. [leaf motif] How that the Chyrurgiane ought not be to curious in searchinge out the bullet.
ALlthoughe, the bullet be of anye strange, alienate, substance, yea alsoe as intollerable for nature, as is the livinge vvith the deade, the principalle intentione, to cure all vvoundes is, that vve must first separate that, from the vvounde vvhich oppugneth nature, yet notvvithstandinge ought not the Chyrurgiane be too curious, in seekinge all contrarye thinges in the vvound or to too boulde audacious, in dravvinge the~ out, except he lightlye or easylye, can finde them, vvithe small payne greefe to the patient ca~ dravve them out.
Because that often times, in the firste, vve can finde nothinge, but the vvou~de beinge come to good suppuratione, and matter, the brused fleshe rovvnde aboute the bullet corruptinge rottinge, at the last maketh him an apertione, throughe the vvhich nature in the end, expellethe the bullet vvithout anye pane, as is the nature qvallytye of the vitall livinge partes, to expell fro~ them the mortifyed and deade partes: the vvhich vve ought to vnderstande of all other contrarye thinges, vvhich are retayned in a vvounde: as sometimes beinge the surest best vvay, that vve recommende such thinges vnto Nature, follovve her instructions, then that vve in vayne tormente, and moleste the same, seinge that it is shee onlye, vvhich curethe the disseased, vvhe~ as she throughe the Chyrurgiane, as throughe her serva~t is opitulated helped: For have knovvn manye, and divers, vvhich beinge shott, the bullet hath co~tinued in the bodye, are yet for all that perfectlye cured, and that in short time alsoe, vvithout at anye time therafter to perceave anye impediment therof: vvhich especiallye chaunceth the bullet beinge of leade, the vvhich in time by little little commeth to vnite it selfe and vvith our nature agreeth: vvherfore for a renoumned example vvill alleadge, the vvounde of Mo~sieur of Chardon, the first gentleman, of my lorde the Cardinalle of Bourbo~, vvho beinge the Chapelayne, of my lorde of Angvie~, hath gotten a shot in the skirmishe of St. Laurent, in the middest of his legge, of the vvhich shot the bullet, remayned fast stickinge therin, the vvounde beinge vvholye, compleatlye cured, vvithout perceaving in yeare anye hi~derance or molestatione of the same, vvherfore he reqvested mr Pare, me, that vve shoul+de remove take a vvay the fore sayed bullet from his legge, fearinge least that the same, in time, might be anye hinderance or molestatione vnto him, the vvhich vve alsoe effected, findinge the bullet vnited and coalited together, as vvel vvith the bone, as vvith anye Me~branes, and soe fast grovvne, and ioyned together, as if the bone, the membrane, the bullet, had all of them binne but one substance.
It happeneth alsoe somtimes that the bullet through his ponderousenes, heavyenes by degrees, dessendethand sincketh dovvnvvardes, tovvardes the exterior skinne, that parte notvvithsta~dinge beinge cured, throughe the vyhich he desce~deth or sincketh, vvithout the perceavi~ge of the patie~t, vvher, vvithout anye greate trouble or molestatione of the patie~t, he may be cut out, vvhich one this manner is farre surer, the~ if in the firste vve hadd torme~ted him heervvith, brought him into daunger of his lyfe, consideringe the great dilaniatione or tearinge of vaynes, arteryes, and synnues, vvhich the hardnecked and obstinate Chyrstrgiane, in searchinge and in dravvinge forthe of the bullet, might be the cause of: vvherfore I, in all sortes doe councel, that vvhe~ the bullet, can not by anye meanes possible fitlye or convenientlye, vvithout anye great torment of the patie~t be dravvne forth, vve as then quietlye suffer him to tarrye therin: In thus doinge vve shal follovve the practise of the aunciente professors, yea alsoe of Hippocrates, vvhich reciteth to have cured a cer+tayne personage, vvhich had receaved a shot vvith an arrovve, in his flanckes, vvher of the heade, or iron, tarryed therin, and yet agaynst the opinione of all men, is therof cured hel+ped: vvhich foresayed arrovve heade or peece of iron, sixe yeares therafter he tooke from him.
Paulus Aegineta alleageth, that he hath of ten times seene, that the arrovves have binne lost in mens bodyes, that the same, in a longe time therafter, the vvounde beinge cured, are throughe apostematione of that parte come agayne to light revealed themselves.
Albucasis sayeth, that he alsoe hath seene one, vvhich vvas shott vvith an arrovve into his shoulder, of the vvhich shott, the foresayed arrovve, therin stucke fast, yet for all that is cured, but that the arrovve, seaven yeare therafter at the length throughe the bone Coccix is come forthe and taken out.
VVherfore vve must not be to curious, in dravvi~ge forth the bullet, vvith great daunger, torment to the patient, to our vtter shame disgrace.
THE SECONDE TREATISE OF THE OPEratione of Chyrurgerye, wherin is discoursed, of the meanes, hovve to Trepane the Cranium, of the Heade, Contayninge sixe Chapiters.
Of the signes tokens by the vvhich vve may knovve vvhen ther is a Fracture in the Heade.
Hovv longe, vve ought to tarrye, before vvee proceede vvith the trepane.
Hovv greate a quantitye of bone, vve ought to take therout.
[leaf motif]Of the tokens, throughe the which, we shal knowe the fractures, of the sculle.
THe operations of Chyrurgerye, vvhich vvith greate prudence, consideratione, vvilbe effected, vve must not all to rashlye or overbouldlye beginne them seinge, therfore that it is daungerous, to open the Cranium of the heade, before vve may attayne vnto the operatione, vve must dilligentlye and truelye consider, vvhether it be verye necessarye, or not, vvhich is revealed vnto vs, by those signes and tokens vvhich the auncient Chyrurgianes have beqveathed vnto vs: For the signe or token, is the demonstratione vnto vs, vvhich discovereth, that vvhich before laye occulte, hidden: The vvhich fore sayed tokens, of the vvounded parte, muste be taken, and observed, ether of the accidents vvhich chaunce vnto the vvounde, after the blovve, or fall, or allsoe of the instrume~t, vvhervvith the vvounde vvas made.
VVe must therfore first of all note, vvhich parte of the heade, hath receaved the strok namelye, vvhether the Cranium, one this place be thin, or tender, thicke or stronge, because the bones of the heade, are not in all places of aequalle crassitude, or of aequall tenuitye: ther vve must marke, vvhether the vveapo~s, vvhervvith the blovve vvas given, have allsoe cut of the hayre, that it shevveth it selfe right in the vvounde for if it be soe, it is to befeared, that the bone is bared or vncovered, out of the vvhich vve may easylye iudge, the Cranium to be hurte, because that it is all most impossible, the hayre to be cut throughe, the vvhich for the most parte slippeth asyde, vvith out hurtinge of the Cranium or breakinge ther of.
Havinge thus considered and noted all this vve must interrogate the patient, vvhether he have parbraked vomited anye Cholera, vvhe+ther he loste not his sight, and his eyes darckened, vvhether he lost not his speeche, or hath voyded anye bloode through his nose, throughe his eares, or throughe his mouthe, vvhether after the blovve he fell not dovvne to the earth, and ther lay still, vvithout anye reason, as if he hadd bi~ne one sleepe: For it is impossible that all these fore sayed signes chaunce vnlesse the scull vvere dilaniate, or broke~.
In like sorte if the patient, lye vvithout his memorye or reason, if he rage, if he be vexed vvith Paralisis, or vvith Spasmo, or vvith them both together, it is then credulous, that the Membrana called Dura Mater, is hurte, and suffereth greate payne.
And althoughe that none of these accidentes have happened vnto the patient, yet notvvithstandinge all vvayes theris somthinge doubtfull, vvhether the Cranium be hurte broken, or not: and to be therof certifyed vve are to note, vvith vvhat instrument the vvound vvas made, as ether vvith a stone, vvith a sticke, vvith an iron, or vvith anye other vveapons: also vvhether it vvear greate, or reasonable greate, light or heavye, smooth or rugged, vvhether the blovve vvas smitten violentlye, or easylye, vvith greath ire, furye, vpvvardes or dovvnevvardes: of all the vvhich vve may be certifyed of by the patie~te, vvhen as vve aske him on vvhat manner he vvas stroken, or from vvhence he is fallen, vvherone, to vvit on the earthe, or on the pavement, vvhether he have great payne, and in vvhat place, for hovv easyer the blovve hath bin stroken the lesse feare ther is of a broken scull: yet notvvithstandinge, there is nothinge surer, as Celsus sayeth, the~ that vve search the vvounde, give iudgement throughe a more surer signe, vvherfore, if soe be, the vvounde be greate enoughe, vve must as then search it vvith the finger, scrapi~ge the bone vvith your nayle, one that manner to perceave the re~te, and dilaceratione, and if soe be vve can not effect that vvith the finger, vve must as the~ trye it vvith the searchinge iron, vvhich must not be to grosse and thicke, nether to sharpe and thinne, because, if that per adventure vve perceaved anye naturall hollovvnes of the sculle, vve should not thincke esteeme it to be a dilaceratione, or fracture: nether must the privet or searchinge iron be to thicke, or grosse, because it should not praetermit overrune a little or smalle dilaceratione, vvithout perceavinge it, and stayinge ther at.
VVhen as therfore vve leade and perfricate the privet or searchinge iron over the sculle, perceave noe vnsmothnes, then all even, and smothe, then vve saye esteeme the sculle to be vvith out daunger, not dilacerated or torne.
But if so be vve perceave anye thinge, vvhich is rugged and vneven, and that the searchinge iron sta~deth therat faste, if soe be, it be not on the sutures or commissures, and ioyninge of the sculle, or anye naturall co~cavitye hollovv+nes of the Cranium, it is then a signe, that the heade is broken, or lacerated, and rent vvherfore the Chyrurgiane must dilligentlye marke, that he doe not in steede of the fracture, take the suture, because that those co~missures, often times doe deceave the sight of the Chyrurgiane in his iudgemente, and that as touchinge the similitude, vvhich the commissures, are participati~ge vvith the fractures: And vve are to note, that in some persons, the futures have no naturall situatione, or place, but to the contrarye vve must also note, vvhether that ther be any dilaceratione one the fracture, or not: for it might chaunce, that the naturall similitude of a suture, might vvel be a rent or dilaceratione, vvhich is not soe easylye to be perceaved, knovvne, because that a suture consideringe her nature is vnsmothe and rugged, even as a dilaceratione is vvonte to be.
VVherfore Hippocrates, acknovvledgeth to have binne deceaved, in the person of Antonomus, of Omilos, vvhoe beinge throvvne vvith a stone in the middest of his foreheade, and a boute the sutures, died vvithin the space of fifteene dayes therafter, because that he vvas not trepayned, and because alsoe the foresayed Hippocrates, thought and iudged the skull not to be dilaniated or torne.
VVherfore, it is the surest, and certaynest vvay, principallye, vvhen by, or in the vvounde ther are these foresayed accidentes, vvith agues, that as then vve denudate, and vncover the sculle, because the sutures sometimes have no certayne place, for sometimes vve espye the~, in the middest of anye bone, vvhich a man vvoulde thincke to be a fracture or dilaceratione: it might alsoe chau~ce that the foresayed sutures, or the next partes, vnto the same, might be dilacerated and torne, the vvhich vve can not certaynlye espye, vvithout makinge denudatione of the Cranium, and to our sight vncover it: vvhen as therfore vve doubt, vvhether ther be a fracture or fissure, and can not certaynlye espye it, because of the smallenes of the vvou~de, as then ther is lesse daunger, and the cure therof happeneth so much the sooner, the surer, vvhen as therin vve make a resonable vvyde apertione, rather then beinge therof vncertayne, vve as yet proceede vvith such a small apertione, in curinge of the same vvou~de, because that it is vvholye impossible, other+vvyse to knovve anye certayntye, of that vvhich thervnder lyeth hidden, as vve easylye see in the greate apertions, vvhich therafter, may verye easilye be cured.
It sometimes alsoe chaunceth, that the Cranium beinge sufficie~tlye denudated rovvnde about the fissure, yet for all that vvith the tacture, or vvith the searchinge iron, or vvith the eyes, vve can not by anye meanes possible espye the fissure or rente, because it is as subtile and fine, as a hayre, vvherfore it is allsoe called the hayrye fissure, or re~t: to the vvhich purpose vve must above on the sculle or bone, vvype a little incke, or anye other blacke medicamente, because that the nigreditye or blacknes, may imprint in the fissure some signe of his blackenes, if soe be that ther be anye, vvhich bare bone, vve muste ther after scrape vvith an exfoliative trepane: For that vvhich is burst or rent, notvvithstandinge retayneth his blackenes, by the vvhich meanes, vve shallbe certifyed of the largenes ther of and profunditye of the same.
[leaf motif] Of the counter fissure, in the bones of the heade.
THe auncient Doctours, and all soe certayne professors of our time, make mentione, that vve somtimes finde a counter teare or fissure in the sculle, as if vve had receaved a blovve in the occipitialle parte of the heade and had the teare or fissure in the antereore parte of the same and ther revealed it selfe, or in anye other parte of the heade also, vvheras the blovve did not alight.
The coniecture vvhich vve ought to have of a counter fissure, is, that vve surelye knovve vvhether the patient vveare roughlye stroken, and vvhether after the blovve, anye bad accide~tes have follovved, as if through the blovve he fell to the grovvnde, hath ther lien impotente, hath vomited Cholera, is full of agues, although it soe be that vve can finde noe fissure in the Cranium in the place of the vvounde, and ther vvher the scull is denudated.
VVe must alsoe farther note, and observe, vvether the patient often times lay his hande, on anye other place of his heade, then vvher the vvoun+de is, complayninge of anye payne or heavines of his heade: vve must one that place vvhich vve suspecte applye some Cephalicke plaster, vvhich vvhen vve remove, the same, vve must then note, vvhether anye one certayne place of the applicatiane, be moyster then in another place, or els any vvher vnder the payster, the skinne be softened and a little more svvollene, then the other, vvhich findinge it to be soe, it is the~ a signe, that in the sculle ther must needes be a fissure, that it is necessarye, there and in that place to denudate the Cranium for somtimes vve finde the bone ther to be broke~: The aunciente Chirurgians have beyonde all this vvritten, that although vve have inscided the skinne, vvithout anye reason or occasione, it easylye and lightlye vvilbe agayne curedand if soe be that the sculle be dilaniated torne, and vve havinge forgot to detecte denudate the same ther immediatlye follovveth a great imflammatione, vvhich verye difficuttlye can be cured.
But as yet coulde never attayne to the knovvledge of such a fracture, nether can perfectlye adhibite any credite thervnto that ther can by anye meanes chaunce to be such fissures shutt vp, and closed or ioyned on vvith the other and soe grovvne together, or beinge missinge of the broken bone vnto that, vvhich findeth it selfe in the fracture of the other syde, right over agaynst it.
have seene, that vvith the shott of a gunne, that the first table vvas vnhur+te, and yet not vvithstandinge the seconde vvas crushed and broken, vvhen perceaved that the patient, had gotten manye bad accidentes, namelye, that throughe the blovve he fell to the grovvnde, had vomited, forth at his nose voyded bloode, vvas vvholye abashed feelinge payne about the vvounde, havinge alsoe an ague: and fearinge least the patient might have dyed, trepaned him, vvheras vvhen had pearced the firste table founde, that the seconde vvas burst, yea and that reasonable vvyde: vvherfore therafter vvas vrged to beleeve that the counter teare or fissure, in the other syde of the sculle, vvhich by the aunciente professors vvas discribed, must be vnderstoode in the same bone, for the first table, is right agaynst the seconde situated.
It might alsoe chaunce that nether the first table nor the seconde shoulde be hurte, or broken, yet notvvithstanding the Diploe, that is the porositye vvhich is betvveene them bothe, vvas soe plettered crushed, that the little vaynes, vvhervvith it vvas, replenished, vveare broke burst and avoyded bloode from them vvhich in time corrupteth and rotteth and alsoe corrupteth the bone internallye, the vvhich in some time thereafter vve perceave, for the bone vvaxeth leadishe coloured, on the vvhich the Chirurgiane must vvell note.
It may allsoe chaunce, that the sculle, be safe and sounde, yet throughe the violence of the blovve, anye vaynes vvhich contayne that mem+brane vvhich is called Dura mater, as vvell of those vvhich passe throughe the sutures as througe anye of the other smalle holes internallye are situated vvith in the braynes, might come to bre+ake, out of the vvhich ther vvill issue bloode, vvhich therafter co~gealeth and vvith great payne changeth in to matter, vvith manye other fearfull accidents.
In this dissease theris all vvayes payne about that vayne vvhich is burst, and if soe be vve chaunce to open in this place the skinne, the bone there vnder hath a pale and deade Coloure: but it is a difficult matter to iudge, and knovve it, vvherfore consideringe often times of the impossibilitye, to doe anye remedye or cure therine by vvant of knovv+ledge, death suddaynlye ensueth theron.
The vvhich Hippocrates reciteth of the daughter of Nerius, vvhich vvas but
yeares oulde vvho in playinge beinge smitten on the bone Bregma, vvith an outstreched arme, of one of her playfellovves, strayghtvvayes vvithout anye respiringe is, fallen into a Vertiginem vvho as soone as she vvas brought into the house is fallen into a violent ague, vvith payne in the heade, and rednes of face: one the seaventh day she voyded a goblet fulle of reddishe matter filthylye stinckinge out of her right eare, by the vvhich she seemed to be somevvhat lighted and easyed but vvhen the ague agayne returned vnto her, she vvas then vvholye abashed, and allmost lay vvithout anye reason or vnderstandinge, vvith Spasmo, in her right cheeke, or syde of the face, vvithout beinge able to speake vvherone the foresayed Spasmus hath possessed the vvhole bodye, vvith shakinge, qviveringe, vvith the tonge tiede, and vvith irremoveable eyes, and dyed on the ninthe daye. [leaf motif] What Fractures of the heade we ought to trepane and wherfore we must trepane them.
ALthoughe that in all fractures and fissures of the sculle, the yo~ghe Chyrurgians take ther light or refuge strayght vnto trepaninge: it is notvvithsta~dinge better, that in the firste vve trye, vvith playsters, and vvith manye other remedyes, and inventions therto constituted, and ordayned: consideringe one the consequence and importa~ce, of the foresayed Fracture, vvhether, it be needfull or necessarye, to take avvay anye parcell or peece of bone, consideringe the excellentie, and vvorthines of the braynes, vvhich are such vvorthye partes: vvherfore vve must vviselye and dilligentlye consider and marke, vvhether the vvounde give a goode digestione forth of her, and purifieth her selfe, and vvhether there beginne in the vvounde to grovve, anye redde pomgronate Kernell vvise fleshe, or vvhether the ague vvhich consideringe the suppuratio+ne in the vvounde, be abated or asvvaged, or hath left him vvhich soe in tollerablye vexed and tormented him, vvhether his apetite be agayne restorede, and vvhether the patient reasonablye taketh rest or sleepe, vvithout havinge anye troublesome accidente chaunce vnto him, vvherbye vve might suspecte, that the membrane called Dura mater, or the braynes, are molested, affected, or suffer any payne, ether throughe a splinter, or throughe anye bloode, or throughe anye matter, vvhich might be come and situated it selfe therone: And the matter luckylye ominouslye procedinge, vve may continue the fore sayed remedyes, and the vse therofe, because that sometimes by this meanes the fissures, are reple+nished filled vp vvith some obdurate substance and callositye, vvhich agreeth and may be likened vnto the callositye or cicatrice of other bones.
Sometimes onlye the first table of the sculle breaketh and renteth vvithout pearcinge or penetrati~ge the Diploe: Some times allsoe is the fore sayed diploe crushed plettered, and broken yet the seconde table~ safe and illaese or vnburte, vvherfore as then it is not necessarye to detecte and make bare or to trepane the membrane Dura Mater, yea and as then vve may perceave the manner as it vveare of a splinter, of the sculle therin lyinge erected.
The fracture at sometimes alsoe is soe greate, vvith such a huge quantitye of massacred, and crushed bones, vvhich lye halfe, and halfe separated, or els for the most parte cleane beaten theroute, that vve may playnlye vvith our eyes behoulde the membrane Dura mater, soe that the bloode vvhich driveth therone, may verye easylye flovve out of the vvounde, in like forte allsoe may the remedies therin easy+ly be applyed: To the vvhich fractures, the tre+pane is nothi~ge behoovinge or nedefull: And if so be in anye sorte you perceave anye skilfers or splinters, by the vvhich that membrane might be pricked, or crushed, you must take them verye easylye therout.
It happeneth alsoe some times, not onlye in the little children but in aged poeple, alsoe in vvho me the bones are soe thinne and tender, that vvith anye rude blovve they are invvardlye bente, (as vve see a tinne or a copper potte to be brused) vvithout the externall skinne beinge anye vvhere externally hurte: To the vvhich disease of the bones, vve must onlye take our refuge flight vnto our extractive, dravvinge plasters, vvherbye that the depressede bone, might by anye meanes be elevated, and heaved agayne into his right place.
Hippocrates, comprehendethe in verye Shorte vvordes in his blooke De Locis in homene, the vvhole cure of the fractures of the sculle demonstratinge those vnto vs vvhich vve ought to trepane, or not.
As farre forthe ther+fore (sayeth he) as if the bone be broken, or massacred, ther is as the~ noe perrille, or daunger at all, vvith moysteninge medicamentes must it be cured and helped, vvhich quiet, and take a vvay the inflammatione, soften and mollyfye the bone, because that vvithout payne vve might take the broke~ peeces of bone therout: but insomuch as the bone onlye chau~cede to be burst, it is then verye daungerous, must of necessitye be trepaned, because that the matter vvhich distilleth throughe the rente, or fissure one the membrane, doe not in anye sorte corrupte and rott, the fore+sayed subiacent, or subiectede membrane: for as vvithout havi~nge anye issue agayne, shee come to sincke throughe this angustnes, and narrovvnes, as then she causeth an ague, and somtimes allsoe distemperatenes of minde: vvherfore vve must needes trepane, and make a large apertione because that the sanious matter may not onlye have an entrance, but an issue alsoe: vvhen as vve doe not in anye sorte suspecte that the membrane Dura mater, sufferethe any thinghe, or is in any sorte crushed, or pricked vvith anye peeces of the broke~ bones, that ther is noe matter runne therone, by the vvhich she might be troubled, it is not the~ necessarye that vve trepane, or open the sculle.
The Chyrurgiane is constrayned to vse the trepane for divers occasions, and take therout the broken bones: First of all to give an issue and passage to the congealed or not congealed bloode, vvhich was suncke on the membrane Dura mater, throughe the effluxione of those vaynes, vvhich are as vvell situated in the fleshe of the heade as betvvixt both the tables, vnder the sculle, vvhich as there doe restrayne that membrane fast vnto the sculle.
Secundaryly, because the matter, vvhich continuallye soacketh throughe the fissure on the membrane doe not chaunce to spoyle, or inflame the same, because that throughe such an anguste passage she can have noe issue, the vvhich in the end might be the cause of the pa+tient his death.
Thirdlye, to dravve forthe the broke~ bones splinters, through the vvhich the foresayed membrane might in anye sorte be pricked or lye crushed: Fourthlye, accordinge as the vvorke reqvireth, to applye convenient and necessarye remedyes into the vvounde: Fifthlye, because it might serve in steede of a repercussive, defensive ligature of inflammations, vvhich othervvyse may be vsed in all other broke~ partes and ioynctes, exceptinge onlye the heade, because that this, consideringe the rotunditye rovvndnes ther of can not by anye meanes possible therone be effected: for a ligature, vvhich must be stifflye fast vvou~de, rovvnde aboute the fracture, to praeserve and keepe the broken bones one by the other, might in the heade be the cause of paye, and inflammatione, it vvoulde alsoe hinder the agilitye of the arteryes, and the ascendinghe of the fuliginous excrementes, vvhich throughe the futures of the sculle, doe evaporate: it vvoulde alsoe repelle the externall bloode of the vvou~+de, sende it tovvarde the braynes, membranes therof, out of the vvhich might ensue verye bad accidentes.
How longe we ought to tarrye, before we beginne to trepane, and of the places which in trepaninge we must chuse, or eschewe.
HIppocrates chargeth the Chyrur+giane, in his booke concernin+ge the vvoundes of the heade, vvhen as in the first he hath binne theru~to fetched or havinge together noted, the fracture of the bone, vvith the molestinge and troublesome accidentes therof, that vvith+out anye longer delaye, he shall vvithin the space of thre dayes beginne to trepane, and especiallye the vvether beinge hotte, therby to prevent the inflammatione: but not to the membrane, least she lye bare, and soe the externall ayre chau~ce to distemper her, and cause therine some corruptione and rottinge, least also that in so doinge vve might chaunce to teare the membrane, in boaringe through the sculle vvhich cleaveth vnto the same, or anye of the other fasteninges of the membrane: or in placinge of the instrument theron, she might therby be hurt or vvou~ded.
VVher+fore, (as he sayeth) it is farre better, vvhen as ther is but a little more bone to pearce or boare throughe, the barede bone beginneth to stirre it selfe, that as then vve desiste, vntill such time as it of him selfe falleth out.
But if soe be that the Chyrurgian hath not in the first binne therat present, the patient hath of some idiote or ignora~t fellovv binne dressed, vvhich hath not knovve the fracture, and because ther vvas noe apertione made in the bone, to give ayre or light, vnto the matter, ther are chaunced thervnto (as is a fore recited) greate inflammations, and manye other fearfull accidentes: vve must then (if it be in the summer, and the putrifactione one the suddayne reveale it selfe) vvithin the seaventh day treparte the patie~t, before the braynes are vvholye infected, and chaunce to mortifye: But in the vvinter vvhen as the corruptione procedeth and goeth somvvhat tarder ofsloer forvvarde, vve must then effect it vvith in dayes: because these dayes beinge passed, as vvel consideringe the imbicillitye of his forces, as the greatnes of the dissease is incurable, although as then vve trepane the scull, it is then to late, vvherfore in noe vvyse must vve effect or doe it.
Avicenna vvil have that vve strayght vvayes beginne to trepane, and if so be vve must needes deferre it, that vve shoulde deferre it noe longer then tvvo or three dayes at the most, and that especiallye vvhen as the Dura mater is pricked or lyeth crushed, of anye broken bones.
Celsus sayeth, that he vvhich tarrieth anye longer from trepaninge then three dayes, are not to be excused, because that such delay causeth a concursione of humors, on the Dura mater vvhich findinge noe apertione, or issue, disordereth the foresayed membrane, and spoyleth it, out of the vvhich necessarylye must follovv greate inflammationes.
But our vse and practise in these dayes, is that as soone as vve are sent for, vvhether it be in time or out of time, earlye or late, and vve espye, ether through searching vvith our, fingers, through the searchinge iron, or by our sight, that the scull is broken, rente, or torne, and that the Dura mater suffereth anye thinge, vve out of hande proceede vvith the operatione, and that soe much the sooner, vvhen as vve note, that ther accidentes demonstrate themselves, vvithout anye longer delay and especiallye, in debile aegritudinous, or corpulent bodyes, because in them ther are revealed farre vvorse accidentes then in others, vvherfore to tarrye or deferre the trepaninge anye longer it vvould be smalle commoditye vnto vs, but better that altogether vve deferred it.
And althoughe the Chyrurgiane vveare not in the first sent for, and that the seaventh day of the sommer, and the of the vvinter vveare praetermitted, and let passe, he shall not therfore refuse to doe his vtter most ende+voure, vvith trepaninge, for it is yet better somvvhat to late them never, consideringe the goode hope vvhich vve must have of doin+ge the patient anye good, helpe, and comforte, vvhich othervvyse vvithout trepaninge of the broken bone, or the elevatione of the same, can by noe meanes be done, vvhich vve onlye vnderstande of those, vvhich are not cleane vvithout hope.
Seinge therfore that vve have the time day limited vnto vs, in the vvhich vve ougt to trepane, vve must co~sider vvhat places, or partes of the sculle are able to abide the trepaninge, and vvhich not.
VVe must first of all ther fore consider, that the bones vvhich vvholye are in peeces, or beinge crushed, or at the least a great parte of the same beinge separated, can not easylye be trepaned, because he might chaunce to crushe the trepane one the membranes, hovve easylye soever he leane theron.
VVe must alsoe note, that vve doe not chaunce to sett the trepane one any suture, because in soe doinge, vve should vvith great payne, and vvith great bloode sheddinge, cut of the vaynes, arteryes, and synnuish filamentes, vvhich have a vnitye and fasteninge, vvith the Pericranium, and the membrane Dura mater, vvhich have the free passage throughe the foresayed sutures, to retayne the Dura Mater, and administer life, and nurture vnto her.
But if it soe chaunced that the fracture chaunced to be one the suture, vve must then applye the trepane, on both the sydes of the suture, vvith out in the least touchinge of her: for if soe be vve trepane but on the one syde onlye and not at the other syde of the suture it vveare then impossible that the bloode or matter, should have at that hole anye issue or passage, the membrane beinge betvvixt them both: nether may vve trepane on the fontanelle, or openinge of the heade in yonge Children, because that ther tendere imbicillitye as yet is notable to suffer and abyde the trepane.
The inferior, or descending partes of the sculle, are not convenient or fitt to be trepaned, because the braynes throughe ther ponderousnes, might chau~ce to sincke therout, or the membranes throughe the apertione might chaunce to be extruded: But if soe be vve vveare vrged ther vnto, vve must make but a verye smalle apertione.
VVe ought in noe vvyse to trepane the temples of the heade, because vve shoulde not hurte the temporalle muscle, consideringe divers synnues, arteryes and vaynes, vvhich are therin divided and entermingled throughe the vvhich there might be caused to greate payne, fluxione of bloode, agues, Spasmus, and the patient might chaunce to dye: Because that ther vnder the bone called Os petrosum is situated, and that consideringe, the movinge and stirringe in the temporall muscle, vvhich happeneth in speakinge or eatinge, the vvou~de might be farre more daungerous, and Hippocrates alsoe sayeth, that the inscisione of the same muscle, might be cause of a greate, and villanouse distortione out of the vvhich one the same syde, a Paralisis on the other a co~vulsione of synnues might chaunce to ensue.
Nether ought vve to trepane that parte of the sculle, a little above the eye brouvves, because in this place ther is a greate concavitye, fylle of ayre, and vvhite slimye, mye, humiditye, of nature, in that place co~stituted ordayned, to paepare the ayre, vvhich asce~deth vp to the braynes, the vvhich indeed is vvorthye to be knovvne observed, becau+se that the Chyrurgiane, might not in anye sort be deceaved, takinge the foresayed concavitye to be, a depressione of the bone, vvhich needes must be trepaned: if it so chaunced, that anye of these foresayed partes vveare bro+ke~, as are the temples of the heade, vve ought then to applye the trepane, a little above the te~porall muscle: if soe be that the part or portione of the sculle, be broke a little above the eyebrovves, vve must as then make choyse of that parte of bone, vvhich boundeth on the fracture, as above in the fooreheade: it is right true, that if so be the foresayed bones, vveare depressed, and crushed, that as the~ vve ought to elevate them, and if they be cleane separated vve as then must plucke them out in like sorte as vve must doe in the sutures.
Yet consideringe all this, vve are ofte~times compelled constrayned, to trepane in all places of the scull: The vvhich a renoumned, experte Chyrurgiane called Andreas a cruce, confesseth often times to have done, vvithout anye daunger.
And dare my selfe bouldlye affirme, that in the yeares, of have my selfe trepaned, and have seene others trepane, in the foresayed prohibited places, as one the sutures, and one the temples of the heade.
Notvvitstandinge vvould councell the yonge Chyrurgiane, that in as much as is possible he avoyde eschevve, the trepaninge of these places, but rather make choyse of anye other parte, vvhich parte, may be a little descendinge, because havinge made the apertione, the bloode, the matter, all impuritye might therout have ther free passage.
Consideringe in the dayes vvhich goe before and vvhich conseqventlye follovve after the trepaninge, on the singularitye, and vvorthines of tvose partes, vve must commaunde the afflicted and vvounded persone, that in all thinges he vvilbe sober, and observe a good diet, both in etinge and drinckinge, abstayninge especiallye from vvine, and phlebotomye, as much as is needfull, because that the humors, shoulde not concurre vnto the vvou~ded parte, and that alsoe vve keepe his heade vvarme, vvith light coveringes of the heade, because coulde is a greate enymye vnto the braynes all synuis he partes. [leaf motif] What qvantitye, or vvhat bignes of the bone in trepaninge vve must take out Chap.
WE must in the firste, accordinge vnto the quantitye, and bignes of the bone vve purpose to take out make an apertioin the skinne denudate the foresayed sculle: Therfore if so be ther be noe vvounde nor anye apertione, and the skinne externallye as yet vnhurte, this shall as the~ be the convenientest apertione, vvhich vvith handes may be made, vvhich vve shall make vvith tvvo crossevvyse overthvvarte inscisiones, in such a forme as this in the margine, demonstrateth vnto you, or els in forme of a borghondiane crosse, vvhich in his middle praesenteth four corners.
In somuch therfore, as if the hurte, have made a vvounde, and inscisione, in the skinne, vve must suffise our selves thervvith, vvith such as it is, if soe be she be thervnto fit and apt, making an other transversall inscisione, namelye overthvvarte the vvounde, because these tvvo as then may present one.
But if soe be, the vvounde be verye ample, large, vve must as then onlye cutt the skinne one the one syde, begi~ninge the same in the middle of the vvounde, because soe the vvounde may present this letter T, in the vvhich vvilbe but tvvo corners.
But if soe be vve perceave the vvounde to be large enoughe to give place vnto the trepane, or anye other instrumente, vvhatsoever, vvhervvith vve might endevoure and seeke to elevate, and restore agayn the broken, or depressed bones, in so much as if ther be anye, vve must thervvith content our selves, exstendinge the foresayed vvounde at the first vvith linte, vvith little plumaceoles, therof being made and therin crushed, on allsydes, corners of the vvounde.
But in vvhat sorte or fashone soever, vve make our inscisione in the skinne, vve must allvvayes note that vve doe not suffer anye portione of the Pericranium to remayne one the sculle: vvhich vnder the skinne, decketh and covereth the vvhole sculle: because if so be the foresayed membrane Pericranium, vveare per happes, torne vvith the teeth of the trepane, might be the cause of greate inflammatione, payne, and agues, vvher fore it is better that vve cleane, and vvholye separate it from the sculle, vvhich beinge done, vve must then damme stoppe vp the vvounde vvith vvhite linte, by the vvhich the next day ensuinge vve shall finde the vvounde vvide open, if as yet ther vveare anye parcell of the skinne, or lippe of the vvound, vvhich might be a hin+derance vnto the trepane, the vvhich in the turninge about might chau~ce to touche, vve shall vvith the scissors clippe it of, vvithout deferringe it vntill the next day.
Vvhen as vve havinge considered, one the place vvher to set the trepane, vve must then note, hovv much, hovve broade, vve ought to boare the sculle.
First of all therfore, vve must vvholye take avvaye all the broken and crushed bones, vvhich vvholye are separated from the sovvnde parte, and alsoe from the Pericranium, consideringe that they can never thervvith be vnited ioyned agayn.
But vvhe~ as the broken bone is depressed, anye parte therof as yet theron vveare fastened, vvith the sovvnde partes therof, vvhich crushed the membranes of the braynes, or any acuitye of the same, as yet sticke theri~, vve must not therfor for all that cut it of, and vvholye take it avvaye.
But must by all meanes endevoure, easyly to lift elevate the same, situate it next vnto the borderinge bones, exemptinge only out of the same the small peeces, vvhich might hurte the membrane, pricke it, because by this curinge remedye, the bones agayne renevve, vnite, and ioyne themselves together vvith the circumiacent bones.
In soe much as if ther be anye more rentes or fissures before ha~des, vvhich fro~ the one syde, disperse themselves this vvay or that vvay, vve shall not nee+de to pursue the~ vnto theire end, but vve shall onlye take some parte therof avvay, because most commonlye they ioyne, saulder as it vveare together agayne, the vvhich is a farre more better opercle for the braynes, the~ that nevve incarnated fleshe, vvhich after the trepaninge grovveth therin, vvhere vve have taken the vvhole broken bone therout, vvherfore vve must take noe bones therout, then vvith greate discretione, then as fevve as is possible, soe that they doe not pricke, trouble the membrane, vvith ther acuitye edge, that ther remayne distance enoughe, to give passage vnto the bloode, and the matter vvhich is therone gatherede, to departe, for as vvel the membrane as the braynes, shalbe better defended, through the bone vvhich as yet they Keepe, vvhich is ther naturall defe~ce, as if vve qvite cleane toke it avvay, through vvhich discoveringe, the foresayed braynes might be hurte or hindered.
It chaunceth often times that the first table commeth to be broken, rente vnto the Diploe, yet for all that the seco~de table remayninge vntouched, vvherfore it is not the~ needfull to applye the vvhol trepane therone, to boare the bone qvite out, but in this case vve must o~lye vse the exfoliative trepane, therby to administer anye passage or apertione vnto the bloode, vvhich, beinge suncke betvve~ the foresayed Diploe, through continuance of time beginninge to corrupte, might in the same time chaunge aulter the seconde table alsoe, and cause anye accidentes therof to ensue.
If so be in the vvounde vve perceave any splinter, vvhich exalteth it selfe vvith some highe eminence, vve must not be soe curious, to take the same immediatlye a vvaye, or cut it out sei~ge that it is anye vvher fastened, but rather commit it vnto the vvorke of nature, vvhich vvil deminishe separate noe more therofe, then shalbe necessarye neede full, because she is vvise and prudent in all her vvorkes.
It might alsoe chaunce that the bone, not beinge broken or rente hath onlye binne above contunded, hurte, or externallye denudatede, vvhich bei~ge soe, vve must onlye above scrape it even, and grate it. [leaf motif] Of the ma~ner methode hovve to trepane vvell, and artificiallye.
SOe manye and divers species formes of fractures, as there are even soe are ther divers meanes vvher by vve may suc+coure the vvounded patient.
Vvhen as therfore the fracture, is nothinge els, then a right runninge fissure, vve must then consider vvhether it pearce or penetrate throughe both the tables: the vvhich me may knovve throughe the Raspatoriu~, or throughe the exfoliative trepane, vvher vvith vve must grate the first table, vnto the Diploe, if that the foresayed fissure, as there doth not departe or vanishe out of sight, nether the accidentes desist, findinge allsoe the fore sayed Diploe plettered crushed, or broke~, anye matter vvhich throughe the seconde table commeth to distille into this place, it is as then a signe that the foresayed fracture pearceth, vnto the seconde table, stretcheth it selfe one the Dura mater alsoe: vve are as then counceled to applye the vvhole trepane therone: ordinarylye to effecte this, as it is needefull to be done, vve must cause the patie~t to sitt, one such a manner as the parte vvhich is broken reqvireth: vve must stoppe his eares vvith cotten, decline and lay his head one a companye of pillovvebeares, vvhich must be indifferent harde, cause his head of one or tvvo men to be helde fast, because he stirre it nether this vvay nor that vvay: then vve must cover the lippes of the vvounde, vvith anye plasters spreade vppen fine linnen cloth, least that of the ayre, of the turninge rounde of the trepane they might be hurte or vvou~ded, beinge in such sorte fineshed, vve must situate and settle, the perforative trepane verye fast or stedfastly, on the broke~ bone, on such a place vvher as vve desire to have the acuitye or poynt of the trepane situated, ther to make a perforatione, vvhich beinge effected, vve must therone situate the vvhole trepane vvherof the poyncte, muste be set in the hole or perforatione, the vvhich before vvas made vvith the perforative trepane, and soe easilye turninge it, the bone first of all shall raceave the poyncte, by and by the crovvne, or the teeth of the trepane, vvithout ether glidinge this vvay or that vvay, or remove out of there circkle, because of the acuitye or poyncte of the trepane vvhich must restraygne the trepane, vvith out slippinge out of his place.
There is a certayne industrye in the depressione of the trepane, soe that it both turneth rounde, pearceth or cutteth alsoe: for if so be vve leane to lightlye therone, it then pearceth and cutteth litle, or nothi~ge at all: if it soe chau~ced that as then vve depressed is somvvhat to harde, it vvill not then turne rounde, vvherfore heerine vve muste vse a medium betvven them both, or mediocritye, lifte it some times out, to purifye, brushe it, and then annoynte it vvith oyle of roses, because that it might the betre pearce and enter in.
The trepane having novv made a reasonablve deeped circle, as then vve must take avvay the poynte out of the middle therof, for if it pearced deeper the~ the crovvne or teeth of the trepane, he shoulde be sooner passed by or throu+ghe the bone then the trepane vvith his teeth, by the vvhich the membrane called Dura Mater might chaunce to be hurte, the foresayed poyncte therfore beinge taken therout, vve must agayne sett the trepane in his hole, or circkle, and markinge that the trepane hath pearced the Diploe, and passed therbye, the vvhich me may perceave by the blood vvhich vvil issue therout, throughe those little vaynes vvhich there are openede, vve must then finnishe the trepaninge vvith more discretione and heede takinge ther vnto, vnto the concavitye of the sculle, turninge the foresayed trepane verye easylye vvyselye, layinge the left hand verye lightlye therone, that therbye vve may the better espye, vvhen that the sculle shalbe pearced qvite throughe, that vve doe not in anye sorte hurt the membrane: because therof might ensue, inflammatione, and the dau~ger of death.
Novv to marke this, vve must often times lift vp the trepane, to try the thicknes of the bone, through the vvhich the trepane hath passed, vvhich vve must vvith a little privette or searcher try, or vvith a propre instrument vvhich heere to fore is onlye for this intent discribed.
By vvhich meanes, vve must alsoe note, vvhether it be in noe pla+ce cleane perced, for althoughe vve rightlye aeqvallye turne the trepane, it may never the lesse happen, that the foresayed bone be one the one syde cleane througe, vnto the Dura Mater, and one other syde not soe deepe: vvhe~ vve therfore perceave this, vve muste proceede vvith turninge, depresse the trepane one the other syde vvhere the bone as yet is not throughe somevvhat more, because the bone may aeqvallye be pearced, or if it vvil not soe be, vve may then vvith the same turne of the trepane, pearce the bone one the one syde, denudate the Dura Mater one the other syde, vvhich somtimes have knovvne to be done.
Such an in aeqvallitye, co~meth partlye as vvel consideringe the heade, vvhich is rounde, as concerninge anye concavityes or furrovves vvhich are situated in the seco~de table, vvhich toucheth the Dura mater, vvherfore the bone is in one place thicker then in an other.
In like sorte vve must alsoe plante the little groundedravver in the perforatione, the vvhich in the first vvas made vvith the poyncte of the trepane: Or vve must, stick that Elevatorium vvhich is at the poyncte of the little foresayed grovvndedravver in that circkle, vvhich by the trepane is made, thervvith to lift out the little peece of bone, or make it loo+se, by the vvhich vve shall easylye espye, vvhe+ther it yet hould verye fast, vvhether it neede anye more to be boared, if vve see that it hath pearced vnto the Dura mater, vve shall then vvith the foresayed Elevatorium, or vvith the groundedravvere, vvholye lift it out, vvith out breakinge of it or doinge anye violence therone, because ther throughe vve doe not chaunce to hurte the membranes but give it rather one turne or tvvo, because that soe much the easyer vve might lift it out, at one
This beinge done and the rounde bone beinge taken therout, vve must then smoothe and make playne, the edges of the perforatione, and grate them, and take avvay all his acuitye and ruggednes, from him, for if soe be there remayne anye small splinter therone or anye other vnevennes, the vvhich not beinge clenlye taken therof, it might be agreat hinderance unto the membrane: and if soe be that through trepaninge ther chaunced anye of the poulder of the bone to fall one the membrane, vve must endevour by all meanes to get it out: If so be it is sufficient to remove the first table, vvithout touchinge of the seconde, vve shall not then playne and scrape the edges onlye of the pearced hole, but allsoe the vvhole bone, because that therafter vvithout any trou+ble to the patient the skinne may grovve therover: for if soe be that it come to grovve over the rugged and vnsmooth bone it vvil be a gre+at hinderance to the patiente, and cause a nue payne, because that the fleshe vvill not be soe goode, vvhervvhithe the rugged bone shal be covered.
And this is our practise, and manner of trepaninge vnto the membrane Dura mater, and the manner allsoe hovv immediatlye to lifte the bone out of the perforatione, althoughe that Hippocrates, in his booke of the vvoundes of the heade, strictlye prohibiteth to boare the hole vnto the membrane, and presentlye to take it therout, because the external ayre, suddaynlye alightinge one the same, might chau~ce to hurte the same, by the vvhich occasione she might therafter chau~ce to rotte: and more alsoe if that vve take the bone out of the same the vvhich as yet might be fastened vvith the foresayed membrane, vve might chaunce to teare the same, or anye smalle vaynes therone fastened: or if that vve stucke the trepane vnto the membrane, vve might hurte the same: it is therfore the surest vvaye, sayeth he, that vvhe~ as the bone is all moste cleane throughe, and beginneth to stirre, that vve then desiste, and tarrye vntill such time as it of it selfe falleth out: But our trepane vvith the crovvne, or teeth is such, that vnlesse the Chyrurgiane be verye ignorant, might in anye sorte thervvith, hurte or crushe dovvne the membrane.
We have inve~ted other formes of trepanes, vvhich vve have in this booke also set dovvne ther forme vvhich vve cal Terrebellum alatu~, the vvinged trepane, vvhich taketh noe peeces of bone vvith it but diminisheth, and con+sumeth them, vvhervvith by noe meanes vve may hurte the membrane: there are some vvhich havinge vsed them, finde them farre surer, and expediter in ther operationes, then those vvith the hoode.
But if soe be there be anye greate massacringe of bones, or depressinge of the same, the~ the membrane is there throughe depressed and crushed, and is alsoe sometimes pricked vvith the splinters, of the broken bone.
In these tvvo daungerous matters, vve must helpe, and succoure the patient or vvounded persone one some other sorte, that as soone as it may be possible, in the ex+tractinge of the same, if so be they be vvholye seperated: To vvhich purpose, it is oftentimes necessarye to trepane, cut avvay some parte of the sovvnde bone, vvhich bordereth and is situated next vnto the plettered bones, because that our Elevatorium, might in the elevating of that vvhich is depressed dovvnvvardes have sufficient place, rest it selfe one the sovvnde bone, vvith out in the elevatione to depres+se the brokene bones any more dovvnevvardes: for as Hippocrates sayeth, the bones vvhich are broken, and depressede, can not vvithout greate daunger be boared or perfotated, because that the depressinge of the trepane, or Elevatorij, by anye meanes of them can not be suffered.
It often times happeneth that the seconde table is more depressed the~ the first, vvherfore to that intent vve must let the Elevatorium passe throughe the perforatione of the trepane, betvveene the seconde table, and the membrane Dura mater, because in that sort vve might lift vp the broken bones and splinters agayne, and take them out if they lay loose or separated.
And if so be there vveare noe hole, above all this, the place of the fracture, could by noe meanes suffer, to have therin made a hole, it is as then my manner to take my grovvndedravvere vvith three feete or poynctes and set therone, then make choyse, of the greatest, vvhich is most fittest for me, consideringe the fracture vvhich is in the bone, to intrude the same therin, and easylye vvinde the same therin, houldinge your hande alvvayes hanginge, and not depresse the same to harde, because he vvil easylye enough enter therin, vvhen he hath a little pearced vve must as then vvith a certayntye, the easyest vvay possible endevoure, to lift vp the broken and crushed peeces of bones.
But if soe be, there be anye peece of bone soe farre shoved vnder the sculle, that it laye above the membrane, and the same consideringe his greatnes, and the angustnes of the apertione, coulde not by anye meanes be taken therout, ether by Elevatories, or Pincets, vve must the~ take our refuge, (if so be vve vvil not through the trepane make the apertione anye bigger) to the cuttinge pincers, to the Parrates bille, vvith the vvhich vve may cutt of as much bone as vve please, vvith out anye paynes, or daunger, makinge one this sorte the apertione somvvhat vvijder, to take out of the same the foresayed peece of bone, vvhich driveth one the Dura mater.
Touchinge the inflectione or bendinge invvardes, vvithout fracture, vvhich commonlye chaunceth in yonge children, or in these vvhich have a vveake tender sculle, vvhen this is crushed, or bendt invvardes, as is a copper or time potte, those ar better to be cured vvith extracti~ge plasters, then vvith the trepane or vvith the grovvndedravvere.
The Frenche Chirurgerye THE THIRDE TREATISE OF THE OPERATIon of Chyrurgerye, wherin is discoursede and handelede of the sovvinge or suture of vvoundes.
VVhat the suture, or sovvinge together of avvounde is and the vse therof.
VVherone vve must note in the sovvinge of a vvounde.
VVhat is needfulle, to the sovvinge, and of the meanes, hovv to doe the same.
Of the species, or differences of sovvinge, and of the time to remove the same.
Hovv vve ought to repose agayne the guttes, vvith the net, vvhenas they hange out of the body.
[leaf motif] What sowinge is, and the vse therof, and in what impedimentes she is necessarye, and in what partes.
THe Chyrurgiane ought to con+sider sixe especialle thinges, vvhich concerne the sovvinge of vvoundes: First the vse therof, that is, in vvhat impedime~ts it is necessarye, in vvhat partes: vvhat vve must therin consider: vvhat ther is vvantinge to effecte the foresayed sovvinge: after vvhat manner vve ought to doe it, hovve manye fashions, differences ther are of the same.
Therfore sovvinge of a vvounde is nothinge els, but a vnitinge, and couplinge to+gether of the dissevered partes: vvhich vveare contrarye to nature, separated and parted one fro~ the other, vvhich fore sayed vnitinge must be effected vvithe a threded needle.
The occasione, vvhy vve in anye vvounde, or separated parte, vse this sovvinge, is to vnite agayne, ioyne them together, vvherof the convenientest meanes is, this sovvinge, the vse of this combinatione, and that especiallye in all such partes, vvhich vve can not conveniently oraptlye binde together, even as vve may playnlye see, in the greate vvoundes of the armes, legges, vvhich are overthvvartlye vvounded, in like manner alsoe in the bodye vvvich happen in the length therof, for the lippes or edges of the same, are soe much separated one from the other and causeth the vvou~de soe to gape, that shee coulde not vvithout great daunger be cured, vnlesse that in anye place vve sovved it, to bring them together and vnition: because that all incarnate, or fleshye partes of the bodye, are dravvne throughe vvith certayne sinnuishe fibers or filame~tes, the vvhich beinge overthvvartlye, or contradictorylye separated the one, from the other, the one lippe of the vvou~de is dravven opvvarde, the other dovvnevvard or the one on the right syde, the other one the left, all accordinge as the vvou~de or the separatione is more or lesse, overthvvarte, co~tradictorye, lo~ge, deepe, or vndeepe.
In like sorte is the sovvinge, verye necessarye in a vvou~de, vvherin a peece or parcell of fleshe hangeth one the one syde, and one the other end as yet connexed, even as it commonlye chaunceth most commonlye, in a great hevve or slashe, throughe the vvhich the eare, hangeth by the heade, or in any other parte, as in the nose, the vvhich helde fast but at one end onlye.
It happeneth alsoe some times, that the vvhole parte is cleane cut of, vvherin the sovv+inge is nothinge profitable, vvherfore therin vve must not vse anye sovvinge at all, to cure the~ agayne, for then in the separated parte is noe more life, therfore can noe more be nourished of the bodye, by the vvhich the curinge ought to come.
And althoughe that all those partes, vvhich agaynst the course of nature are separated fro~ the other, might behove to be healed agayne, ca~ not beare or suffer to be vnited or coalited, even as are the synnues, Tendones, Cartilages or grissells, because after the opinione of aunciente professors, and as alsoe the vse and practise teacheth vs, ther must consequentlye follovve of one pricke, or thrust vvith a nedle, in the synnues, or tendones, great payne of all sortes, infla~matione, convulsione of synnues, and some times alsoe death it selfe, throughe the sympathye, or compassione, vvhich they have vvith there firste originalle, the vvhich Galenus, hath shevved vnto vs, in a vvou~de, belovve the Hockes in the vvhich, consideringe the greatnes therof, it vvas verye needefull that there shoulde be a profounde suture, that not onlye to bringe the supersituated places, together, but alsoe the profou~de lyinge partes of the vvounde: the vvhich he endevouri~ge to effecte, hath separated the te~dones fro~ the muscles: for because ther is great dau~ger consisteth in the hurtinge of the synnues, even in like sorte is ther daunger in hurtinge of the tendones, that consideringe the synnuishe fibers vvhervvith the muscles of the bellye are connectede, vvhich in time chau~ge themselves into a tendone, vvhich vve commonlye call the great synnue.
What we ought to consider in the suture, and so winge of a wounde.
WE must not at anye time sovve vp a vvounde, least in the first shee be vvell purifyed, cleansed, as vvell externallye, as internallye, if at the least vvith out any great daunger or perrill it may be effected: extractinge and takinge therout all that is contrarie vnto the sayed vvounde, as is congealed bloode, vvhich comminge to corruptione, might cause greate infla~matione, ofte~ times alsoe a convulsione in that parte, throughe vvhich the sovvinge breaketh, teareth, soe conseqventlye hinderethe the vnitinge healinge of the vvou~de: vvherfore in the resovvinge of a vvou~de, vve must deligentlye note, that vve doe not contracte dravve together on all sydes) the lippes or edges of the forsayed vvounde (except it vveare in the haremouth, in the cleaved or severed lippes of the mouth) but must leave some distance betvveene the one the other lippe or in anye place some or other apertione, because the matter which gathereth it selfe together, in the bottome of the vvounde, may issue therout, and by that meanes the medicamentes may be therone applied.
In like sorte the Chirurgiane must in sovv+inge consider, vse medicoritye, and not take to great a qvantitye, ether in the length, or in the depthe of the fleshe, and of the skine, throughe the vvhich there might ensue and follovve great payne, vvhich vve ought not to esteeme for smalle, therof allsoe vvoulde remayne an illfavored vnseemlye cicatrice or scarre: As to the contrarye the not deepe sovvinge of the vvounde, myght easylye breake and burst agayne, then in vayne it vveare sovvede.
For if soe be, that the needle, be to neere thrust throughe the edges of the vvou~de, the~ the threde because of his tenuitye teareth throughe the skinne or fleshe, vvhen as vve thruste the needle to deepe and farre, from the lippes or edges of the vvounde, then there resteth and remayneth a greate parte of the skinne, vvhich vvill not be vnited: vvherfore indifferentlye vve ought to pearce together as much of the skin as of the fleshe, because the fleshe farre sooner and easyer commeth to heale and cure, vvith the fleshe then the skinne vvith the skinne, and that is consideringe the naturall temperatenes of the foresayed fleshe, vvhich is vvarme, and moyste.
And as touchinge the distance of the stitches, and soovvinge, vve ought not to laye them to close one by the other, nether to farre separate sequestred one fro~ the other, as the~ they can not retayne the vvounde: And vvhen all to nye the other they are layed, cause payne, through all the stitches, and dravvinge together of the same, through the vvhich payne is caused a concursione of Humors vnto that place: vve must therfore vse a meane therine vvell consideringe, the largenes, and length of the vvounde: but above all vve must marke, that vve thrust not, throughe or in anye synnues or tendones, consideringe the payne, the Spasmus and manye other fearfull accidentes, vvhich therof might ensue, as allreadye vve have sayed.
Sovving of a vvounde may not be effected vvith anye violence, in those partes vvhich vve endevoure to vnite and bringe to+gether, but the~ is sovvinge laudable, vvhen as the skinne stretcheth it allmost together, of it ovvne accorde, vvheras in this sorte it vvill not be effected or brought to passe easylye, that the lippes of the vvound vvith violence must be ioyned, it is as then most convenient, that vve relay the stitches some dista~ce one fro~ the other, lettinge them be somvvhat looslye sovved: for if it chaunced vve drevve them somvvhat stiflye together, the skinne might then easylye rente or teare, soe burst a sunder throughe the tumefactione vvhich therof ensueth: If that therefore, vve disire perfectlye to cure a vvounde, vve ought as the~ soe to dispose of the sovvinge, because that in thus doin+ge, the humors, bloode, matter, and the externall ayre might be repelled, from the lippes, or edges of the vvou~de, because such thinges, may hinder, or at the leaste deferre, the curinge of the same: and in soe much, as the lippes of the vvounde are not vvell vnited the one vvith the other, and kept in that stature, vnitinge, the vvound can verve badlye hardlye be cured.
And alsoe if the lippes of the vvounde, doe greatlye chaunce to svvell, inflame, theye shrinck in themselves, or els if they be to much brused or plettered, vve must not the~ in anye sorte resovve it agayne: for the suture vvould strayght vvaye breake, and soe consequentlye the inflammatione increased, but must delay it soe longe vntill the foresayed inflammatione be seaced the vvounde be come to goode suppuratione and matter, and is prepared and readye, to be vnited brought together.
What is necessarye vnto the sowinge of a wounde, and howe we ought convenientlye to doe it Chap.
WHen as the Chyrurgiane desireth aptlye convenientlye to sovve a vvounde, he must first of all have in his hande a needle, therto a threde, and a canulle: Co~cerninge the needle, shee must be of a reasonable length, somtimes right, sometimes croocked, accordinge as the partes reqvire, nether must shee be made of to harde a steele or mettle, vvher of they easylye might chaunce to breake, but of gentle steele, because they might rather bende then breake: althoughe shee ought to be stiffe, smooth, infrangible, havi~ge a sharpe triangled poyncte, because that in her entringe she might both cut pricke, soe the easyer perce or goe ther through, because that in her govvinge throughe, she might make a longe little vvound or hole, not rounde, be+cause those little rovvndes, are more difficulte to be cured, then the longe holes.
In the heade she must be one both sydes hollovve, in form of a gutture, because the threde might therinne be hidden buried, not hinder the percinge or entrance of the needle, in the dravvi~ge throughe therof, because shee then toucheth the bodye in that sort more easyer and sof+ter: It vvill not alsoe hinder accordinge to the sayi~ge of Avicenna, that vve somvvhat anoynt the needle vvith oyle, vvherbye the payne of the pricke night be somvvhat easyed, the fo+resayed needle enter the easyer.
The threede must be smooth, soft rovvnde, and vvithout anye knott, all eqvivalent vvith the thicknes, greatnes of the needle, but not in any sorte to thinne, least he cha~ce to breake or cut through the lippes of the vvou~de.
VVe may rather take a threde, the~ silke, because the knott of the silke easylye vnlooseth, throughe his vveaknes: it is right true that the foresayed threde, must not be to harde, because there throughe he might hurt, the vvou~de, not to softe least he breake nor chau~ce to corrupte, before the time the vvounde be fullye healed, vvherthrough the lippes of the vvou~d, might agayne dissolve vvaxe loose yet notvvithsta~+dinge novve a dayes vve had rather vse a thred of carmosyne silke, the~ a hempen threde, or of flaxe, vvhich Galenus disprayseth misliketh, in his third booke of methode, vvhere he best liketh of a threde of vvollen vvhich may be likened vnto, a brovvne threde, or a vvhyte silke threde ravve, vvithout beinge dyede, or coloured: because that in the dyinge sometimes is entermingled poysen, as in the scarlet dye ther co~methe Arsenicu~.
The fore sayed Gale+nus vseth stringes made of smalle guttes, as are lutestringes, but co~sideringe there moysture, they quicklye beginne to svvell, rotte, vvher+fore vve had rather vse a stronge brovvne thre+de, vvhich vve must dravve throughe vvaxe vvaxe it because soe much the lesse he might corrupt rott, houlde the faster.
And to effect this surelye to sovvea vvou~de vve must have a Canulle vvhich one the one end must be rou~de, splitte, vvith a hole, partlye because the edge or lipp of the vvou~de, vvhich vvith the needle vve vvoulde pearce, because that the fore sayed lippe may stay, rest it selfe, on the pype, vvithout stirringe this vvay or that vvay, throughe the vvhole to espye, vvhen the needle is halfe perced throughe as then to dravve her through vvith her threde, vvithout ether the nedle, or the thred to dravve the lippes of the vvounde tovvard, them, because throughe the splitte of the pype, it might the the easyer fro~ thence be removed, to rest thero~ the other edge therafter, vvhe~ she allsoe must be thrust throughe.
And convenientlye to effect this sovvinge of a vvounde, vve must first thrust through the vpper lippe of the same, situatinge at the first the holed ende of the pype vvith the left hande, internallye vvithin the lippe of the foresayed vvounde, because she may rest therone, and not stirre this vvay or that vvay, then vvith the right hande vve must thruste the needle throughe the externalle par+te of the lippe, invvardes, then set the Canulle on the externall parte, of the nether lippe of the vvounde, thrust the needle internallye outvvardes, of the foresayed lippe, gentlye dravve throughe, the threde, because as then vve may couple ioyne agayne the lippe together: if it be needfull to lay more stit+ches, vve must lay them as is a fore sayed: some me~ hould the lippes vvith ther fingers in steede of a Canulle.
The kindes and differences of sowinge, or sutures, the the time, and the methode, or rule to take the~ away.
THe auncie~t Chyrurgianes have invented fovvnde out di+vers sundrye vvayes of sovv+inge of a vvounde, co~sideringe, markinge one the vvou~ded parte, nature or qvallytye of the disseases: for the vvoundes of the armes, or legges, as in those places vve may better vvith more co~venience vse the dry suture: the vvou~des of the bellye, are alsoe on an other fashone sevved, then the vvoundes of the guttes.
The profounde deepe vvoundes are sovved, on an other fashon, the~ the not deepe vvou~des: Alsoe are the debile imbicille perso~s sovved one an other fasho~, as are vvoeme~, the~ those vvhich are robuste stronge, by great paynes takinge and labour have a harde skine, ther in to eschevve flye the deformitye vvhich after the sovvinge vvilbe seene.
All auncient professors have vsed, have had in estee~, thre sortes of sovvinge of vvoundes, as naemelye, the incarnative, the bloode stoppinge, the conservative sovvinge.
The incarnative suture is soe called because that throughe her vnitinge, shee ioyneth together the separated partes, if soe be vvithout viole~ce co~venie~tlye they may be brought together: vve vse this ma~ner of suture in all freshe vvou~+des, or in these, vvhich are renued.
And this sovvi~ge is effected after five ma~ner of vvayes.
VVher of the first is called, the knotted suture or sovvinge, because that in evetye stitche, vvhich perceth throughe both the lippes of the vvou~d, is every time cutt of, vvith both the endes of the thred above the vvounde is knitte together: betvvixt the vvhich stitching, vve lay as yet other.
This suture is done vvith a vvaxed threde, as is all readye sayed, notinge that bothe the lippes must aeqvallye be ioyned the one vvith the other, vvith out that ether the one or the other, yelde it selfe more this vvay the~ that vvay, placinge the firste stich in the middle of the vvou~de, vvith a perforation of both the lippes of the vvou~d, by the vvhich the threde beinge passed, shall one the one syde of the lippe be dravven together, above dobblelye knitte to gether, cuttinge both endes of the threde shorte of, because they should be noe hindera~ce, vnto the remydyes vvhich vve shall applye: The vvhich in the renuinge of the dressinge might be the occasione of payne, or brekinge of the stitches, vvhe~ as vvith the plasters vve chaunced to plucke them.
If the vvou~de he greate, vve must as yet lay more stitches, in the middle of the Spaciu~, one both endes of the vvounde, so proceedinge forvvardes vntill the vvhole vvounde be layed vvith stitches or sutures, everye stich a fingers bredth the one fro~ the other, because at the least the lippes of the vvou~de might be brought close together, consideringe, duelye perpendinge the generall observatione above me~tioned, especiallye that the stitches be not layed the one to neere to the other, or the one to vvyde fro~ the other because as heer tofore vve have sayed, through the great multitude, and throughe soe many prickes, they bringe are cavse of veheme~t payne: co~tra+ryly they lyinge to fare the one fro~ the other, the vvou~de as the~ beinge not sufficientlye occluded, or shutt vp, doe little profite, co~moditye, therfore they may not be layed to close by on another, nether to farre separate the on fro~ the other, they alsoe vvhich are layed to looselye, suffer the vvou~de to gape to vvyde, they vvhich to fast, strictlye dravve together the vvounde, cause inflammations, co~pell the vvou~de burst open, vvherfore heerine vve ought te observe a mediocritye.
The seconde incarnative, or fleshe making suture, is done vvith one, or vvith more needles, as if soe be the vvounde be greate, deep, as the~ vve beginne to sticke thruste the needle in the lippe or edge of the vvou~de, vvithout dravvinge of the foresayed needle qvite through, althoughe shee be threded, but must suffer her to continue therine, and vvinde the threde about her, in form of an as the Taylers doe, vvhe~ as they are mynded safely to kee+pe there threeded needle, anye vvher one ther apparrell, as you may see in the figure or form of the haremouth: soe put as manye needles therin as shalbe needfull, accordinge to the greatnes of the vvounde, vvinde the threde ther about, and let them co~tinue therin vntill such time as the vvou~de shalbe healed ioyned agayne.
This sovvinge or suture is vsed, in such vvoundes as stande vvyde ope~, in those in the vvhich the lippes are separated the one so~vvhat vvydlye fro~ the other, they vvhich vvith the common stitchinge might not be contayned, or Kept together.
The thirde incarnative sovvinge, is called, the penned stitchinge, because most commo~lye it is done vvith little quilles, or shaftes of a penne, not that the foresaved qvilles, doe effecte the sovvinge, but because they contayne it, alsoe are a lett hindera~ce that the threde dothe not cut the lippes of the vvou~de cleane throughe, vvhich if vvith al expeditione vvith the least payne vve desire to make the~ vve must doe as heerafter follovvethe.
VVe shall first of all take a stronge double threde vvhich is separated in tvvo, at the end having a knotte, vvhich vvith the needle vve must thruste throughe both the lippes or edges of the vvounde, redoinge the same soe often, in divers places, as the greatnes of the vvou~de shall reqvire, allvvayes reme~bringe that everye stitch must be a fingers bredthe the one fro~ the other situated layed, or therabout.
This beinge in this sort finished we must as then one that syde of the vvound vvhere the knott lyeth of the threde, betvveen everye dubblethrede sticke a little shaft or qville, or els a little stick of vvoode, vvhich is vvounde in linnen clothe, must be as longe in the vvounde it selfe: vvhich aftervvardes vvith the threde, vve must dravve close vnto the lippe of the vvounde: and one the other lippe of the vvou~de, vve must through that same dubblethrede, in like sorte alsoe put a qville, or a little sticke, vvound about vvith linne~ vvhich in the first must be dravvn vvith one of the foresayed thredes, and vvith a dubble knott be knitted together, bringinge by this meanes the lippes of the vvounde as close together as is possible, in this vvyse proceedin+ge vvith dravvinge together and knittinge, all the thredes vvhich ther are, in such sorte as the first vvas dravven together knitte.
Such sovvinge, is vsed, in greate, deepe vvou~des in the vvhich vve feare least the co~mon sovvinge or stitchinge might chaunce to breake, cut through the edges of the vvounde.
The fourth is called the drye stich, or sovvinge, because this may be done vvithout pearcinge of the skinne or fleshe: vvhich vve are vvonte to doe vvith tvvo stro~ge peeces of linnen cloth, vvhich are cut of the syde or edge of the clothe, and vvhich in the endes are cut sharpe or picked, as heere before in the figure vve may see, on the vvhich other ende vve must spreade a verye dravvi~ge fast houldinge playster, vvhich qvicklye may be dryed, vvhich must thus be praepared, vve shall applye this same one both sydes of the vvound, a little higher then the foresayed vvounde, in such sort that bothe the sharpe endes of the peeces of cloth, may be situated close vnto the edges of the vvounde.
This beinge cleaved verye fast to the skinne, vve must as then sovve bothe ther endes close together, vvithout touchinge of the skinne, and dravve them together vvith the threde, through the vvhich meanes, vve may compacte the lippes of the vvounde as close together, os vve please.
Such a ma~ner of stitchinge is very vvillingelye vsed in the vvoundes of the face vvhe~as vve desire to have noe great cicatrice left therin.
The fifth incarnative sovvinge or stitchinge, is effected vvith iron hoockes, vvhich one both there endes vveare crooked, vvith the vvhich vve must hould both the lippes of the vvounde, bringinge the foresayed lippes close together: but because they co~tinuallye pricke are never vvithout causing of payne, moreover might chaunce to sticke in anye membrane, vvhich might suscitate cause payne, concurringe of humors, inflammatione, in the vvou~ded parte, it is novve a dayes noe mo+re in vse.
The seconde suture is, the suture, soe called, because she stencheth stoppeth bloode, and hindereth that the ayre can not enter into the vvou~de, vvhen as in manner of revolutione vve turne the needle, (as the furriers are vvo~te to doe, vvhen as they sovve together the skinnes, lay the stiches, reasonable close, harde, on by the other.
Some vse this suture, or stitchinge, vvhe~ as the great vaynes or arteryes, are hurt or cutt of, co~sideringe the great sheddinge of bloode, through the vvhich they are compelled to doe soe, soe the more easyer to ioyne bringe together and shutt the lippes of the vvounde.
But this stitchinge, is nothinge to certayne, because the one stitchbrekinghe, all the other breake goe loose, moreover the bloo+de vvhich is therin co~tayned causeth that part to svvell, and leeseth as it vveare himselfe betvveen the muscles, vvhich alsoe therafter by co~tinuance of time corrupt are mortifyed.
VVherfor vvoulde councell the yonge Chirurgiane, that he should rather tye or binde the mouth of the vayne or arterye, or vvith a Cauterium cauterize it together, the~ to vse such a stitchinge, vvhich is farre co~venienter, in the vvoundes of the small guttes, or entralles, of the blather, or in the vvou~des of the stomacke to be effected, if at the least in the tvvo last it may anye vvay possible be brought to passe.
The thirde sovvinge, or stitchinge vve call the conservative, or the praeservinge suture, because she praeserveth, Keepeth, the lippes op the vvounde vvhich are verye vvyde separated the one frome the other, or els because they are plettered, crushede, or els because ther is anye parte of them lost, throughe the vvhich they ca~ not by any meanes be brought ioyned agayne, the one vvith the other, reqviringe onlye to be defe~ded, mayntayned in that estate, till such time as the vvounde be come to a goode suppuratione incarnatione: vvher through the vvou~de, is soe much the the sooner cured cicatrised, vvithout anye greate, or deformed cicatrice, remayninge in the place.
This stitchinge is alsoe vsed vvhen vve suspecte, that ther is anye thinge co~trarye to nature in the vvou~de, vvhich vve vvillinglye vvould have therout vvherfore vve doe not bringe the lippes of the vvounde so close together, as in other sutures, contentinge our selves, that in such sorte vve may continue it.
Touchinge the time, vvhe~ vve ought to cut a sunder the stitchinges, ther is noe certayntye therof, because in some bodyes, the vvou~des are sooner cured, then in others, alsoe the one parte healeth sooner then the other, vvherfore vve ought not to cutt loose the stitches, before the vvounde be soe far come, that she hath noe more neede of the stitches, vvhich cuttinge, must alsoe be done one divers manners, as the stitchinges are divers: for the knot+ted stitchinge, must be done, by cuttinge everye stitche aparte, right at the knott, liftinge vp the threde vvith the privette or searchinge iron, havinge in this sorte cut of the knott of everye stitche, vve shall as then vvith the pincet or pinsinge iron dravve them out by there knot layinge the one finger one the stitch, to hould that fast that the one lippe of the vvou~de, be not dravve~ out vvardes.
That stitchinge vvhich happeneth to be done vvith one or more needles, as in the haremouthes, in these vve cut a sunder the vvhole threde, vvhich is vvou~de rou~de about the needle, the~ gentlelye taki~ge the same avvaye, therafter the needle alsoe.
The pe~ned suture, is take~ avvay through the discidinge or cuttinge avvaye, as is above sayed, that vve ought to cut everye stitche abo+ve the knotte, and ther gentlye dravve forth the thredes therout.
The drye stitch is taken avvay, vvhen as ether vvith vvater or vvith anye oyle vve moysten the same.
And the suture of the furriers fashone, is verye difficulte to be taken avvaye: in this stitchinge, vve must first of all beginne to cutt, the first stiche, and soe proceedinge forevvardes, vvith the scissors, or sheares, vnto the end, if at the least it be to be done, and then easylye and gentlelye take every stitch out apart, allvvayes houldinge fast the lippes of the vvoundes vvith pour finger, least that they in anye sorte lift vp them selves because if it soe chau~ced vve coul+de not easylye resovve them agayne. [leaf motif]How we ought to thrust in agayne the guttes, and the nett, which is suncke out of the bellye.
IN the great vvoundes of the bellye, vvhich enter into the concavitye of the same, therin is vsed an other ma~ner of sovv+inge, vvhich the auncient professors call Gastroraphia, that is as much to saye, as the bellye suture or sovvinge.
But because in such vvou~des, most commonlye the guttes the net come to sincke out, it is therfore first of all necessarye, that vve ha~dle of the meanes, throughe the vvhich vve might agayne restore in to ther former place the guttes, or the nett, for othervvyse can not the sovvinge be effected, or brought to passe.
VVhen as therfore it chaunceth, that the guttes are suncke out of the bellye, vve must then first of all dillygentlye consider, vvhether in noe place they are vvounded, or hurte, secondly, vvhether as yet they retayne the naturall coloure, for if soe be the small guttes are cleane cutt of, especiallye that emptye one, vvhich vve call Ieiunum, it is then impossible that he may be healed agayne, because of a great companye, and divers greate vaynes, vvhich are therin, allsoe consideringe his subtyle and synuishe tunicle or koate, and because he continuallye receaveth the Cholera, and is situated more neerer the liver, then anye other.
But the great guttes beinge hurte, vve may rightvvell sovve them, yet not vvithout a stedfast hope that vve are able to cure them, althoughe in respecte of the smalle guttes, by the great ones, vvhich are hurte, it is allvvayes better to have a doubtfull confidence then a certayne dispayre, as much as belongeth vnto ther curinge.
If soe be anye of the~ be blacke, or pale, (vvhich is a certayne signe they have lost ther feelinge) there is nothinge to be done vnto them, or at the least verye little.
But if soe be as yet they retayne the vitalle coloure, vve must by all meanes endevoure to brin+ge them in agayne, and that vvith all possible expeditione, because the externall ayre, in the vvhich they are not vvo~te to be, doth straight vvayes change and spoyle the~.
And first of all if they be vvounded, vve must stitch the~ vvith the furriers suture, vvhich above vve have discribed, vvhe~ they are sovved, bringe them into there naturall place or situatio~, dilligentlye notinge that vve doe not let the end of the threde hange in the vvou~de, because vvhen as they are cured, vve may dravve the threde ther out, not let it sincke into the bellye, for the vvhich occasione he ought be reasonable lon+ge, vvithout cutti~ge of him from the sovvi~ge.
But vvhen as vve vvill beginne or take such a thinge in hand, vve must as then convenie~tlye set, or lay the patient: even as if the vvounde vveare in the bottome of his bellye, vve then laye the patient one his backe, vvith his thighes his buttockes alofte: if soe be the vvounde vveare in the vpper parte of his bellye, the patie~t must lye one his backe hyghlye situated all most sittinghe, because that the vvou~ded partes may suspend hange in the bellye: if soe be the vvou~de be in the right syde, vve must the~ situat the patient one his left syde, and if in the left syde he be vvounded, he must then lye one his right syde: vvhen as the vvou~de is soe narrovve, soe smalle, that the svvolle~ gutt, vvhich ha~geth out, ca~not agayne be put therin, it is then necessarye, ether that by arte vve drive avvay, consume the vvyndes vvhich cause the tumefactione and svvellinge, or that vve dilate the vvounde: but it is allvvayes best that vve trye first of all to repell the svvellinghe of the guttes, vvhich must be effected vvith some resolvinge and strengtheninge medicamentes, amongst the vvhich must be entermingled some mollifyinge and softeninge medicamentes: as vvhen the guttes are to drye, vve must then bath the~, in vvarme vvater, in the vvhich must be done a little quantitye of oyle of roses, or els vvith some grosse blacke vvyne, because it strengtheneth and vvarmeth the guttes more then vvater: if soe be the guttes vvith these remedyes, vvill not as yet relaye ther svvellinge, tumefactione, it vvas then the vse of Mr Pare, chiefe Chyrurgiane to the kinge, in divers places to pricke them throughe, vvith a needle, through the vvhich the vvyndes as then departe.
Havinge thus finished all this, if soe be there be such a quantitye of guttes suncke out of the bellye, that they can not in anye sorte be put in agayne at the same entra~ce, or vvou~de, because shee is to little, vve must as then dilate it vvith a crooked La~cet, vvhich cutteth but one the on syde, dillige~tlye noti~ge that in any sort vve doe not hurt the entralls, vvhich beinge finished, a co~venie~t persone thervnto shall vvith his fingers, hould a sunder the edges of the vvou~de, the Chirurgiane impose foresayed guttes agayne into ther places, first of all intrudinge of those vvhich vveare last, in the comminge or sinckinge out, exactlye notinge, that everye circumvolutione of the guttes, or everye revolutione of the same, may obtayne ther ovvne place, intrudinge the same therin vvith the fingers, and one such a manner that the one may follovve the other: othervvyse that vvhich is allreadye thruste in, the finger beinge taken avvaye, might chaunce retire and come forth agayne, vnlesse that vvith anye other finger vve retayned the same, vvhylest that the other finger is finishinge his operatione or vvorke, vvith bringinge an other portione or parte, into his place, and vsinge this manner,they may easylye be redu+ced into ther former places.
VVhich beinge done, (imposing or layinge the hande one the vvounde) vve must as then a little stirre and iogge the bodye of the patient, vvhere throughe the entralles, vvill situate, settle, or place them selves everye one in his naturall propre place, even as they vveare, before they vveare removed out of the same.
If the net, issueth out of the vvounde, and the same be not hurt, or vvithout anye vvounde, and as yet sovvnde, vve must genttlelye cause it to sincke one the guttes, but if soe be anye parte ther of or portione is become blacke or leadishe coloured, vve must as the~ a little above the blackenes bynde it, to praevent the bleedinge, and cutt it of vnder the foresayed succincture, and immediatelye reduce that into the bellye agayne vvhich is not as yet blacke, is yet sou~de, layinge the end of the threde hanginge out of the vvounde, because therafter vve might easylye extracte and dravve it forth, vvhen as it shalbe therof loosened, and the vvounde be come te goode suppuratione and voydinge of matter.
[leaf motif] Of the stitchinge of the bellye which we call, Gastroraphia Chapter.
THe guttes or entralles, and the nett, beinge brought into ther severall places, vve must as the~ sovve, stitch vp the vvounde: but because such suture, accordinge vnto the opinions sayinges of divers, may not be done in that sorte, as other stitchinges, or sovvinges, to vvit the ioyninge together of that, vvhich is of one nature and dispositione, the one vvith the other, as the Peritoneum, vvith the Peritoneo, (& soe forth of the skinne and the muscles) but vve are vvilled and councelled that vve ioyne and stitch the Peritoneum, vvhich is a membrane, vvith the muscles, and vvith the skinne Epigastri, because the same beinge verye synuishe, vvill verye difficultlye be cured or healed, vvith the other parte Peritonei, vvhich oppositelye is situated agaynst it vvhich is allsoe of the same synnuishe substance.
In fine vve are councelled, to sovve vp the edges of the vvou~de vvhich is in the right syde Peritonei, vvith the muscles, vvhich are in the left lippe of the vvounde, soe that one this manner the muscu+lous fleshe, of the right lippe Peritonei, vvhich healeth vvith the left lippe of the foresayed Peritoneum, vvith the musculous fleshe one the one syde, and the muscvlous fleshe vvith the Peritoneo on the other syde.
Because that Peritoneum, vvith the Peritoneo, can not be healed, vvherthroughe the vvounde onlye above in the fleshye parte might chaunce to heale, out of the vvhich might ensue a tumefactione, as if it vveare a roushing, or issuinge forth of the navel, consideringe the foresayed Peritoneum, vvhich throughe erectione heavinge vp of the guttes, could not in anye sorte conioyne together: and such a meaninge muste be done one this manner.
The vvounde beinge greate, vve must have a convenient minister or serva~t, vvhich must vvith his hand one the exterior parte of the vvou~de depresse it dovvne, because as then shee may be shutt closed, nether the guttes, nor the nett, roush therout sufferinge only a small portione of the vvou~de vncovered for the Chyrurgian, vvho vvith his threded needle, must begi~ne his first stitch in the end of the one lippe of the vvounde, thrustinge through the externall skinne, and the musculous fleshe of the vvounde, vvithout touchinge the Peritoneum, vvhich is there vnder situated, dravvinge the needle fro~ outvvardes, invvardes vvith her threde, thrust the seco~de stitche, cleane throughe the vvhole lippe of the vvounde, vvhich oppositelye is situated agaynst the first stiche, to vvitte, the Peritoneum, the muscles and the skinne, first bringinge the stitch cleane through the Peritoneum, and dravvinge the foresayed needle, from invvarded, outvvardes: And the same beinge dravve~ out, vvith her threde, he must then lay his thirde stitche, as he did the first, beginninge the stitch in the skinne, in the musculous fleshe, of the first lippe, vvithout touchinge the musculous fleshe, of the first lippe, vvithout touchinge the Peritoneum, dravvinge the needle from out vvardes, invvardes, the~ he must bringe his fourth stitch, as he hath done the seconde, thrustinge cleane throughe the Peritoneum, all the musculous fleshe, the skinne, dravvinge out the needle from invvardes, outvvardes, in this sorte he must proceede, and goe forvvardes, vntill the vvhole vvounde from end to ende be cleane sovved vp, thrustinge throughe on the one syde, onlye the skinne the musculous fleshe, and one the other syde the Peritoneum, the musculous fleshe, the skinne: because the sovvinge of the Peritoneum onlye, vvith the other part Peritonei, is not sufficiente, nether the suture of the fleshe onlye, but this suture must as vvell be done in the one as in the other, endevouringe allvvayes to vnite the Peri+toneum vvith the musculous flesh.
Some there are vvhich effect this suture on this manner, follovvi~ge, beinge of opinione, that those partes, vvhich are of one nature propertye, verye easylye vnite them selves the one, vvith the other, as the skinne vvith the skinne, the fleshe vvith the fleshe, and the membranes vvith the membranes, vvherfore they bringe ther first stitch, quite, and cleane throughe the skinne and the musculous fleshe, from the first lipp, vvithout touchinge the Peritoneum, vvhich is thervnder situated, dravvinge there needle from outvvardes, invvardes, vvith her thred, layinge ther seconde stitche, in the lipp right opposite agaynst that, thrustinge then onlye throughe the Peritoneum, throughe a little fleshe, dravvinge the needle, from invvardes, outvvardes, the~ they bringe there thirde stitch, in the first lippe of the vvounde, thrustinge throughe the Peritoneum, a little fleshe, vvithout ether thrustinge through the muscles, or the skinne, dravvinge there needle from invvardes, outvvardes, then they bringe there fourth stitch in the opposite lyinge lippe, thrust throughe the skinne, and throughe the musculous fleshe, vvithout touchinge the Peritoneum, and in that sort proceede forevvardes, vntill the vvhole vvounde be sovved, soe that throughe one edge of the lippe, but yet at divers times they thrust throughe the skinne and the musous fleshe, and allsoe the Peritoneum.
Amonge all other sortes of sovvinge the vvoundes of the bellye, or stitchinge of them this vvhich vve have taken out of Celsus is the least daungerous and the best alsoe, easyest to be done.
That vve must have tvvo threded needles, vvith one threde, the one needle at the one end, and the other needle at the other end of the threde, vvher of vve must take the one needle in the right, the other in the left hande, vve must beginne in the end, of the superior parte of the vvounde one the left syde, first of all pearcinge throughe the Peritoneum, then the musculouse fleshe, and the skinne, dravvinge the needle vvith the threde out, vnto the one halfe, from invvardes, outvvardes, then vve must vvith the other needle of the left hande, make the seconde stitch, right opposite agaynst the first, in the right syde of the vvounde, beginninge vvith Peritoneo, as vve have sayed of the first stitch, on this sorte the acuitye or poyncte of the needle is farre enoughe fro~ the entralles or guttes, yet notvvithstandinge the heade close vnto the forasayed guttes: VVhen as therfore the needles have pearced passed throughe from the one syde to the other, vve must as the~ cha~ge ha~ds, in receavinge agayne of the needles aforesayed, take the needle, of the right hand, in the left hand, the needle of the left hand in the right this permutatione or changinge beinge in this sorte effected, vve must then agayne thruste throughe the lippes of the vvou~de, as al readye hath binne done, to vvitt, from the internall parte, tovvardes the externall, soe proceedinge forevvardes, as much as is sufficient, and allvvayes consideringe that the one stiche be allvvayes layed right opposyte agaynst the other, in this sort proceedinge, vntill the vvou~d be vvholye sevved vp, allvvayes remembringe to leave a little apertione, in the bottome of the vvou~de, throughe the vvhich the congealed bloode, and the threde may be avoyded, vvhich apertione, vve must alvvayes keepe aperte or open vvith a little leaden hollovve pipe, vvhich in the end must be tyede bovvnde vvith a threde, because that by chau~ce it doe not come to slippe into the bellye of the patient.
And vve must vvel and dilligentlye note, that this suture or sovving allvvayes bedone vvith a goode stro~ge threde, vvith a needle, somevvhat crooked at the poynct, layinge the stitches, somvvhat closer the one by other, then in other vvoundes of the bodye, because the stirri~ge of the bellye, farre sooner causeth the stitches to burst and breake a sunder, then in anye other partes of the bodye, because alsoe the vvoundes of the bellye, are not so subiecte vnto inflammation or incensions, as other althoughe that often times the bellye is thrust throughe.
Chirurgerye THE FOVRTH TREATISE OF THE OPERATIon of Chyrurgerye, wherin is discoursede and handelede of the openinges, and apertions of Apostemations, Contayninge five Chapters.
Hovve vve ought to cauterize, make any inscisione in the Apostemations of the brest.
Hovve vve ought to make the Paracentese, and take avvay the vvater from them vvhich have the Dropsye.
Hovve vve ought to cure the Hernias aquosas, or vvater burstinges.
WHen as vve endevoure to ope~ anye apostematio~s, to lett the matter ru~ne therout, vve must first of all before vve com to the inscisione, or apertione, consider, vvhether the matter might not in anye vvayes be resolved or consumed, throughe the forces of the naturall caliditye, or heate, or els vvhether needes and of necessitye be chaunged into matter.
VVhen as an Apostematione, must needes be brought to suppuratione of matter can by noe meanes possible be consumed or resolved, the signes therof are these, namelye a burninge heate, erecti~ge of the tumefactione, or svvellinge, more rednes, vvhich is also harder the~ befo+re, prickinge, knockinge, or beatinge payne, ponderousnes, as if there did hange anye heavye thinge at that ioynte: And if soe be this apostematione be situated in any principall parte, then there is a chillnes and shiveringe thervvith associated, the ague allsoe is more violent by day, then by night: sometimes alsoe the next kernells vvhich are in the bodye situated thervnto come or chaunce to svvel, be distempered.
But the suppuratione, or resolutione to matter bei~ge finished, or accomplished, the tumefactione as the~ diminished, vve the~ sensiblye feele prickinge, vvith a little itching therbye, alsoe a little deafnes or numnes, vvherbye alsoe some times is felte a great prickinge, especiallye the matter lyinge verye deepe: For the matter lyinge close vnder the skinne, there the~ demo~strateth it selfe a little heade vvhich in feelinge is softe, and vvhen as vve depresse vvith the finger it glideth a syde, vvher of the skinne, in the superior parte of the same heade openeth it selfe, separeteth it selfe from the inferior partes of the same.
VVhen as therfore all these signes reveale themselyes, vve may the~ bouldelye freelye, ope~ the Apostematione, vvith the la~cet, vvith out tatryinge anye longer, that it might of it selfe breake through, because the matter may the~ issve forth therat, because that through to lo~ge tarryinge, vvith the openinge therof, shee doe not come to diminishe into the circumiacent partes, make other concavityes.
Althoughe Celsus sayeth, that verye seldome vve ought to make anye inscisione, vnder the armepittes, or in the flanckes vvhen the matter is ripened, come to a full and good suppuratione, in like sorte alsoe, vvhen the Apostematione is not to greate is placed vnder the skinne, but that as the~ vve make the apertione vvith Cataplasmes, let them of themselves breake throughe, vnlesse throughe the intollerablenes, and greate dolor or payne of the patient, the Chyrurgiane vveare compelled, to open the same, because sayeth he, that if vvith out inscisione or cauterisatione vve make the apertione, noe deformed cicatrice, or signe, therof, may remayne.
VVhe~ the mat+ter lyeth deepe vve must the~ co~sider, vvhether the part be synnuishe, if soe be that it is soe vve must as then open the foresayed Apostematione vvith a hott Iron, vvhich is thervnto verye convenient, because that apertione, althoughe vve make it somvvhat smalle, it tarryeth a longe time ope~ to make issue vnto the matter, through the vvhich alsoe the cicatrice continueth verye little.
If soe be about the place of the apertione any synnues be situated, vve ought then to feare vvhen vve must make the apertione vvith a hott iro~ that then the patient might fall into Spasmo, or els the ioyncte might be criple, and tarrye lame, therfore vve ought rather to vse the lancet.
It happeneth alsoe sometimes, that although the apostematione be not yet ripe, vvithout greate store of matter, yet notvvithstanding reqvireth to be opened, especiallye, vvhe~ as it is situated by, or next vnto some vvorthy parte, the foresayed matter beinge venomous or pestile~tialle, vvhich if vve suffered them to continue vntil there complete ripenes maturitye, might dravve invvardes, throughe there venomous dampes, might infecte some of the vvorthyest partes, out of the vvhich, as then follovve most fearfull accidentes.
And althoughe Celsus counceleth vs, that vve must stay vntill such time as all apostemations, are come vnto an acco~plished maturitye, vvhich are situated in the synuuishe partes, because the skinne beinge grovven thinner, and the matter neerer approchi~g thervnto, vve might then the easyer neerer attayne therto, notvvithsta~dinge our best practisioners councell vs, that vve shoulde open such apostemations: as they alsoe councell vs, to open all apostemations, vvhich are situated close to the ioynctes, bones, synnues, tendones, and to the ligamentes, yea and before the time of the accomplished maturitye, because therin, they might not cause anye great rottennes, or corruptione of other partes.
In like sorte must the apostemations of the privityes be opened, before they be come to ther full maturitye, because there chau~ce noe corruptione in that parte, as all such partes throughe there greate, moystnes, are verye much inclined vnto corruptione rotte~nes, as allso beyonde this, the matter throughe to longe beinge therine continued, causeth the Intestinum rectu~, or the gutte of excreme~tes, to corrupte, rotte, vvhich is farr softer, the~ the externall skinne, vvherthrough the foresayed matter ofte~times internallye bursteth out, by the vvich co~monly follovveth a Fistle, vvhich is all most incurable.
VVhen therfore vve see that ther is anye matter in the Apostemation, vvhich hath noe issue, by her selfe can make or effect anye ether consideringe her crasitude, her crudetye viscositye, as therby not beinge possible for her to attayn vnto complete maturitye, or els because the skinne is harde, or that the foresayed matter lyeth to deep, through the vvhich there remayneth a great thicknes betvvee~ the skinne the matter, or els consideringe certayne inconveniences, vve may not delaye soe longe, vntill it be fully mature, and ripe, as are the Apostemations, vvhich are situated next vnto some vvorthye parte, as by anye greate vaynes, or synuishe partes, vvhich are inclined to great corruptione.
The Chyrurgiane must vvithout any lo~ger delay, make the apertione vvith his la~cet, rather the~ to expecte any of these dau~ngers above rehearsed.
The fittest time therfore first of all to doe an operatione, is in the morninge by time, co~sidering that in such a time, the persone is farre better qvieted better animated and incouraged, except the greate daunger reqvired othervvyse the co~trarye Secondly vve must note, that the apertion be made in a convenie~t place, vvhich co~venie~t place, is knovven by the tumefactione, of the parte, in the vvhich there revealeth it selfe a little heade, ther is greate vveakenes softenes founde therin, vvhich glideth vnder the feelinge of the finger, vvhere the skinne is thinneste: it is right true that such an apertio~ might bedone in the inferior partes of the tumefactione a foresayed, because the matter might the easyer issue out, vvith out dravving of the medicametes, or through the harde depressione of the same because all evacuations vvhich chaunce in the hanginge sores, ca~ farre better avoyde the matter, the~ any medicame~tes, especially in such partes, of the vvhich vve ca~ not chau~ge the situatione, as in the vvhole Chaos of the bodye: For although, in the armes, or legges, any apertione is made in the superiore partes of the tumefactione, throughe the situatione, such a faulte may be remediede.
The third conditione is, that vve must consider, one the rimpelinge of the skinne, one the fibres of the muscles, and because the muscles allmost runne throughe the length of the bodye, the apertione must the~ be made in the length of the bodye, and accordinge vnto the right concurringe of the muscles.
Notvvithstandinge althoughe, the rimples, or forefro~te of the heade lye thvvarte over, yet the inscisio~ must therin be made accordinge vnto the le~gthe, follovvi~ge the fleshye fibers, of the broad muscle: othervvyse the skinne beinge cutt accordinge to the ru~ninge of the rimples, might chaunce to fall on the eyes, In the heade vve must observe the grovvinge of the hayre.
Vnder the armepittes, in the flanckes, vve must consider the shuttinge, or one the rimples of the same places, because the deformitye of the cicatrice, vnder the fouldinge of that part may be hidde~, to praeve~t the imbicillytye, vvhich is an occasione, of the receavinge of the co~cur+ringe humors: The~ to praeve~t, that vve doe not cha~ce to touche, any synnues, Te~done, Vayne, Arterye, or any other partes of esteeme, that the apertion, may be done vvithout ane daunger, vve make novv the inscision in the length as the~ overthvvarte, accordinge as every parte reqvireth: vvhich ca~ not rightly be done then of those vvhich have a complete knovvledge of the Anatomye: othervvyse they ignora~tlye might chaunce to touch a synnue, or a vayne, or might chaunce to cut an arterye, vvherthroughe the Spasmus, the Paralisis, or any great sheddinge of bloode, yea alsoe at somtimes might because of his death.
The fourth conditione is, that vve must reme~ber dilligentlye to make as smalle an apertione as vve may, survayinge the apertione, vvith the magnitude of the Apostematione: For if so be it be little, vve may as then make therine a meane and reasonable inscisione, vvhich alsoe must not be deepe, but the aposte+matione beinge great, vve are the~ sometimes vrged, to make tvvo inscisions, or more then tvvo, beinge therin made, that one of them all vvayes, be in the inferior co~cavitye of the fore sayed Apostematione, because the humor doe not chau~ce heere or there to make any more co~cavityes, eve~ as the humors, allvvayes inter+nallye, corrupte eat through the circumiacent partes, and ther in diminishe.
And if soe be that any apostematione, vvith great concavityes cam into our handes, the skinne ther over might as yet becured agayne vvith the fleshe, vve must as then make but one apertio~ or inscisione, throughe the vvhich the matter may issve: but if soe be the fleshe in+ternally is eaten, corrupted avvay, vve must as then cutt throughe vvith a right cutte, the vvhole concavitye, accordinge vnto the lengthe therof, vvhich beinge done, the edge of the vvounde in all places beinge very skinne, bereft of all ther fleshe vve must clippe or cutt them cleane avvay: because such skinne restrayneth and keepeth backe the matter, vvhich causeth the circumiacent partes to cor+rupte, hindereth the applicatione of the me+dicamentes: but vvhen as vve cutt the skinne, vve must doe it tria~gle vvyse, or in forme of a mirtle lease, because the apertione soe much the sooner, might chau~ce to heale, because all rotu~ditye in vlceratio~s is difficult to be cured.
And touchinge all great apertions, vvhich may be made in the apostemations, must be made, accordinge to the abu~dance, or the qva~titye of the matter, accordi~ge as the subiecte partes therof require.
As alsoe vve must consider, on the depthe, marke that vve thrust not the lancet to deepe therin, but reasonable deepe: for vvhe~ as vve thrust to deepe, it is the~ great dolour, payne to the patie~t, causeth alsoe much bleedinge: thrustinge not deepe enoughe, vve effecte bri~ge nothi~ge to passe.
The fifth co~ditione, must be observede, accordinge to the apertio~ of all greate apostema+tio~s, that at one time vve suffer not all the mat+ter to ru~ne out, but rather by little, little, especiallye, the patient beinge debile, oulde, yonge, or any vvoma~ vvith child, because all suddayn evacuatio~s, doe cause great imbicillity fayntnes because ther through the vitall spirites, evaporate flye avvay, vvhich in the co~cavitye of the Apostemation vvith the matter vveare shutt therin, althoughe they are agaynste nature.
The apertione beinge done, vve must ha~dle the vvound, accordinge vnto the diversitye of those partes, vvherin the Apostematione vvas situated, alsoe accordinge vnto the time season of the yeare.
The Chyrurgiane ought especiallye to eschevve the great te~tes, vvhich Celsus prohibiteth to vse in the vlcerations of the arme pittes, flanckes, that because of the great vaynes, arteryes, synnues, vvhich in those places are situated, layinge onlye ther one a sponge vvhich is madefied, vvetted in vvyne.
VVe co~monlye lay theron a flatte plu+maciolle or tent made of linte, and therone a plaster, levinge soe the solutione apert, because that the remayninge matter might issue come forthe therat vvhich othervvyse throughe a great lo~ge thicke tente, might therin be retayned, kept backe.
This beinge done, vve must then dresse that parte, vvinde it beginninge to vvinde from the sovvnde parte, vnto the bottome of the co~cavitye if there be anye, endinge at the apertione because the matter may be pressed crushed therout, vvithout be+inge therin retayned, any longer, because by to longe tarryinge therine, it doe not cause a greate hollovve fistulous concavitye to come therin: then vve must lay that part in such a sort that the apertione may depend or hange, because soe the matter may the better issue out therat.
Of the tumefactions, or swellinges called, Ateromata, Steatomata, and Melicerides.
THe auncient professors, have allvvayes noted, onlye the spe+cies formes of vlcerations, that they onlye differed the one from the other, in the matter, vvhich is founde therine.
For in the vlceration Ateroma, is a kinde of matter like vnto thinne pappe: the vlceration Steatoma, a kinde of fatte matter, like suet.
In Melicerides, is a matter like vnto honnye: Soe that by the forme of coniecture vve may say, vvhat matter therin lyeth inclosed, but for a certayntye vve can not say it, before such time as vve have fetched some of the matter therout: and one this manner they are allvvayes knovvne the one fro~ the other.
vvhen as vve chau~ce to touch the vlceratio~ Ateroma, it spreadeth abroade, in that place vvhero~ vve chau~ce to depresse it, doth not so suddaynly, ioyne it selfe together.
The vlceration Meliceres, differeth fro~ the Ateroma, in his forme, substa~ce of his humors for his figure is much rou~+der, and the substance of the humor vvhich is therin, farre subtiler. soe that it spreadeth more abroade, then the Ateroma, vvhen vvith the finger vve depresse it, it separateth it selfe farre soener, alsoe ioyneth much sooner, vvhe~ vve take the fingers therof.
The vlceratione Steatoma, is much harder, then both the other, in the touchinge of it, it stirreth not, but resisteth the depressinge of the fingers, commo~lye in the bottome is it somvvhat broade, and verye seldome or never may vve se any vvhich are vnder narrovve broade above.
These foresayed vlcerations, are in ther beginninge allvvay little, but in continuance of time, they grovv to be greater, some are verye harde, vve finde sometimes therin vvondrous matter, as if it vveare little stones, bones, rovvled hayre, mixed vvith any matter vvhich is thicke.
Philexomus sayeth, he sometimes hath fovvn+de, in the matter vvhich therin lay inclosed, lit+tle creatures, as if it had bi~ne gnattes, vve must note that al those foresayed humors, al these vvonderfull thinges, are inclosed as it vveare in little blathers.
But as much as concernethe the apertione of the same, it hindereth nothinge vvhether the matter be like pappe, or like honnye, or like suet, or vvhat matter soever it might be: for vve have but one onlye intentione, to vvitt that vve extracte dravve out the blather, or little bagge, vvherin the matter is inclosed, for the manner hovve to open it is this.
VVe must first of all lift vp the skinne fro~ the bottome, then cutt it of, makinge inscisione accordinge to the greatenes of the vlceratione, dillige~tlye markinge least vve cut the blather or purse vvherin the the humor is inclosed, because the matter doe not chaunce to issue out: For the matter beinge issued, the vvhole remane~t operatio~ is perturbed, annihilated, because alsoe there by the operatio~ falleth flatte dovvne: soe that as then vve may or can verye difficultlye flea, peele or separate the foresayed membrane of the matter, from the fleshe, vvherthroughe the vvhole curatione, consisteth vvithout reciduitye.
VVhen as in this sorte, vve shall have cutt the skinne, the~ the little bagge demonstrateth it selfe vvhyte, and outstretched, vvhich vvith greate dilligence, vve must endevoure to separate thereof, vvith a Spatula, to vvitt, from the skinne, out of the fleshe, or vvith any other instrument, vvhich is thereto serviceable, vvher vvith vve must take it out, vvith all that vvhich is therin, vvithout sufferinge anye iott therof to remayne in the bottome, because it chaunce not to increase agayne: And is it soe happened that there chaunced to tarrye anye thinge therof in the vvounde, vve must not as the~ heale together the apertione verye soone, but vvith puryfyinge medicamentes, purifye that therout vvhich as yet remayneth therin.
VVe must alsoe heer note, that some of these vlcerations, are rotede betvveene anye vaynes, arteryes, synnues, te~dones, vvhich eradication, reqvireth a greate longe co~tinued convenient manuall, operation, because, thinckinge qvite and cleane to take avvay the little bagge or purse from thence, vve might chaunce to burst anye vayne, arterye, synnue or Te~done, therfore if so be therebe anye parte therone fastened it is then be~tter to desiste from our operation.
VVhe~ this operatione is thus finished, in anye smalle svvellinges, ther is as the~ noe more daunger, vvherfore there resteth no thinge for vs to doe, then vvith any curinge medicamentes, to heale op the inscisione, layinge therone a Compresse, madefied in some defensive or other, because that in the dressinge, all infla~mations may be praevented, the separated partes the on agayne conioyned vvith the other.
But if soe be the vvounde vveare great, coulde not be cured, one this manner, it vvill not then seeme discommodious, that vve stitch it vp, layinge the stitches somvvhat vvyde the one from the other, to let anye medicamemt or other droppe betvveen them, to give passage to the matter vvhich engendreth therin: then vve must vvholye cure these vlceratio~s as all other vlcerations.
Touchinge the curing of Quee~s evil vvhich is alsoe done through manuall operatione, is alsoe one this ma~ner effected, takinge the foresayed Queens evill vvholye therout, if soe be it be possible dilligentlye markinge, that vve chau~ce not to hurte anye vaynes situated ther about, especiallye of those vvhich are divided amongst the muscles, vvhich are serviceable to the speach, or voyce, as are the recurren+tes, or retrogradinge muscles, those vvhich are situated, abute the Laringa as vvell the prin+cipalls as commo~: For it hath ofte~ times happened that some have had this dissease of the Qveenes evill cut out about ther throt, vvhich all there life time therafter have remayned ho+arce vvithout speeche. [leaf motif]The manner how to cauterize, make an inscisione in the vleerations of the brest, called Empiema.
BEtvveene the ribbes, and betvveene the intercostalle mus+cles betvveene the me~brane Pleura, concurrethe gathereth sometimes certayne bloode together, vvhich chau~geth it selfe into matter, although the Physition, as vvel throughe Phlebotomye, throughe purgations, through fome~tations, or through any other appliclations, hath done his best, to resolve co~sume that.
This foresayed matter, sometimes externallye demostrateth her selfe causinge a tumefactione vnder the skinne of the brest.
Then the foresayed membrane Pleura, allvvayes most commo~lye breaketh, and bursteth a sunder, to give passage vnto the matter, vvhich therafter sincketh into the co~cavitye of the breste, is sometimes voyded throughe the vrine, or throughe the mouth, the longes dravvinge the same vnto them, and then throughe the throte is coughed vp.
The signes, if any matter be retayned in the brest, are these, to vvit, difficultnes in breathinge, stinckinge breath, heavines in the syde, a drye cough, vvith great prickinge in the brest, a co~tinualle ague, vvhich agaynst night redoubleth her forces, svvetinge in the ende of the digestione, little sleepe, noe appetyte at all.
Somtimes in the place of matter, there is vvater gathered in the brest, vvhich vve espy vvhen as the patient through great thirst, hath druncke great store of vvater: vvhen he continuallye cougheth, vvithout spittinge, vvith Shortnes of breth, vvith svvellinge in the feete, vvhen vve stirre the brest one the one syde, vvherin the vvater contayneth it selfe, vve heare a shogging, as vve ar vvo~te to heare in a pott half full of vvater: this dissease may be called, the Dropsye of the lo~ges of the brest.
VVhen anye of these disseases have continued any time, noe remedyes have helped, noe hope left, that the vvater, or the matter might by anye meanes be expelled out by the mouth, or els be purged throughe the vrine,
dayes beinge passed, vve must as then come to the manualle operatione, endevoure to ope~ the brest, make a passage for the matter to issue forth, because the longes doe not in anye sorte chaunce to corrupte, or rotte.
VVhich may bedone through the inscisione, or throughe a potentiall, or actuall Cauterium.
VVe must first of all co~sider, vvhether in anye partes of the brest, vve espye noe svvellinge or tumefactione: vvhich havi~ge espyed, vve must then make the apertione, vvith the lancet, or vvith the Cauterio, that in the fittest convenientest place vve can finde.
But our common vse is, to applye the potentiall Cauterium, because the apertio~, vvhich vve made therine, through the Cauteriu~, may the longer be kept ope~ and apert, vvithout troublinge of the patient, vvith the impositione or puttinge in of greate tentes, to keepe open the inscisione.
And if soe be vve perceave noe tumefactione, or svvellinge, externally in the brest, vve must then betvveene the thirde and the fourth true ribbe, beginninge to account from vnder, about the midest of the one syde, sixe, or seaven fingers bredthe from backebone, make an apertione vvith the crooked lancet, into the concavitye of the brest, not all at once, but by little and little, or by degrees, beginninge from vpvvardes, dovvnevvardes, thrustinge, the poyncte of the foresayed lancet, fro~ vnder the fourth ribbe, the cutti~ge syde of the same, reachi~ge, to the vpper end of the thirde ribbe, least that vve should cut in anye vayne, arterye, or synnue, vvhich lyeth occult and buriede vnder the inferior concavitye of the ribbe.
VVe may in the same place sett a Ruptorium, vvherof the Escara beinge made, vve must cut it throughe, into the concavitye of the brest, settinge agayne the foresayed Ruptoriu~, or corrosive thero~, if soe be at the first tim it had not made his operatione sufficient deepe enoughe.
This apertione may alsoe be made vvithe the actuall Cauterium, heer before discribed, vvhich vve may crus he as deepe therine, as is necessarye, to pearce the matter.
VVhen as therfore the apertione is in this sort effected, vve must not as then suffer the matter all at once to decurre out, because that to many of the vitall spirites, doe not chaunce to flye avvay, vvhich therin lye included, or in+closed: soe that vvhen as one parte of the fore+sayed matter is runne therout, vve must then put therin a tente, and lay therone a plaster of Gratia Dei, or of Betonica, Hippocrates cou~celeth, that vve should make the apertione, one the thirde ribbe, vvhen as vve have discovered, bared the ribb, of her skinne, membrane, vvhervvith externallye shee is clothed, settinge ther one, a Forret, or Trepane, vvhervvith vve must bore her cleane throughe the vvater vvhich is inclosed in the brest: the vvhich easy lye may be done, in those, vvhich have an vlce+ratione vnder the ribbes, the foresayed ribbes, beinge broade enoughe, to set a trepane therone, betvveene the Mediastinu~, vnder the brestbone, may also gather vvater, vvhich Columbus vvitnesseth, that vve trepaning throughe the selfe same bone, let forth the vvater therat.
But vve must note, that there are some auncient professors, vvhich houlde this apertione to be verye suspicious, because they pearcinge into the co~cavitye of the brest, might chaunce to cutt alsoe the membrane ther vnder situated: fearinge least the patie~t, immediatlye after the suddayne apertione, throughe the evacuatione of the animale and vitall spirites, might chaunce to dye, vvhich vvith the matter flye avvay, or alsoe consideringe the in curable fistles, vvhich might therof ensue: but novv a dayes vve finde the co~trarye because there throughe are cured, vvhithout havinge retayned anye fistle therof.
In steade of such an apertione, they place in the brest certayne actuall Cauteries, or potentialle, to the number of
times vvithout pearcinge anye deeper, making the Escara reasona+ble brood but not deep, vvherof they kept the vlceratione soe long ope~ vntill al the coughe and all other impedimentes are, cleane gone.
Howe that we must make the Paracentese, to drawe awaye the water out of the bellyes of those which are troubled with the dropsye.
THe Dropsye, is a tumefactione, or inflatione, agaynst nature, or Phlegma is engendred, or also of some certayne vvindes and ventosityes.
This svellinge sometimes alsoe, spreadeth herselfe throughe out the vvhole bodye: somtimes allsoe onlye in the inferior parte of the bellye.
The first kinde is enge~dred, of a phlegmaticke humor, the seco~de kinde of Dropsye, is enge~dred of vvater vvinde tohether: vvherfore the au~cie~t professors have thought that there have binne thre sortes of Dropsye.
VVherof the first is called, Anasarca, Hiposarcidios, Leucophlegmatias, vvhen as the vniversall bodye is through soaked vvith vvater, through the vvhich, everye parte of the bodye seemeth to be tender, or vveake softe, pale, vnseemlye to the sight, soe that crushinge therone, the printes of your fingers for a little continuance tarrye therin: The seconde, is called Tympanitas, and of Hippocrates the drye Dropsye. vvhen as the inferior parte of the bellye is full of inflation, or vvindes, and stiflye stretched out and spanned, soe that smitinge therone, it giveth from him a sovvnde like vnto a Dromme, it is right true that sometimes ther are alsoe a fevve humors mixed theramongst, because by continuance of time the vvindes come to condence them selves, and chaunge into some vvaterye substance.
The thirde kinde of Dropsye is called, Asites, vvhich is an inflation, and strectchinge out of the bellye, because of the aquositye vvhervvith it is replete, havinge vnparted her name of Ascos, vvhich is to saye, a lether vessell, vvherin in former and auncient times, they vsed to keepe anye moysture in, as vve doe in the hydes, in the buckes skinnes: vvhen this dissease increaseth, grovveth, sometimes the hippes, and the Scrotum beginne to sveelle, vvhich is a signe of Leucophlegmatica, as differinge, from the selfe same beinge or essence of Ascites as in the contrarye it is not soe, vvhe~ as anye aqvosytye ascendeth vp to the breste.
Amongst all these three species, and kindes, ther is but one of them subiect vnto our manuall operatione, to dravve forth therof all that vvater vvhich lyeth enclosed in the concavitye of the bellye: but before vve come to the apertione heerof, vve must first knovve, vvhich of the~ are curable or incurable, because in vayne, to the hinderance of the patie~t vve take it not in hande, in those vvhich throu+ghe age are grovve~ debile, and feeble, or in tho+se, vvhich are corrupt not sovvnde of bodye, the intestines or entralls, beinge verye ill disposed and ill at ease, vvithout anye hope of amendment, in those, vvhich vvholye are grovven impotent, or in those vvhich are ther vvithe borne, vve must not in anye vvyse through this operatione lay ha~des one them.
But in those vvhich as yet are yonge, stronge, are of a goode constitutione, nether have anye agues, havinge all there entralles sovvnde, and tempered, in these, in the vvhich the vvater as yet hath made noe co~cavityes, vvher+by the liver, the milte, and the guttes, might chaunce to be altered, in those remayneth as yet some hope, ominouslye to effect and bringe to passe this operatione: in this manner vve must vvith the same procede.
Namelye, and especiallye, if the Dropsye, resume his originall from the liver, the patient lyinge one his bedde, vve must gentelye lay him one his right syde because vve may make the inscisione one his le syde: is soe be this fore sayed Dropsye proceede, throughe anye dissease of the milte, vve must then turne him, one his left syde, to make the inscisione, in his right syde, soe that the inscisione, must allvvayes, be done one the contrarye syde, of that parte, from vvhence the Dropsye taketh her originall, that because the patiente must lye one that syde, fro~ vvhence the originall of the dissease commeth, for if soe be he lay othervvyse then soe then the obdurated parte, throughe the ponderousnes therof, might chaunce to sincke and descend dovvnevvardes, makinge internallye any solutione, migt ther throughe be the occasione of great payne and doloure.
And the patie~t lyinge one the obdurate liver or milte, might throughe the vvarmeth of the bedde, be eased and stengthened.
And if soe be, the patient chaunce to lye one the ope~ syde, the vvou~de vvould then be a great trouble hinderance vnto him, the vvhich he mervaylouslye might be debilitated, in feebled.
Morover it vveare inconvenie~t that the debilest syde of the obdurated liver, or milte, throughe inscisione, as yet shoulde be more vexed.
The patie~t beinge in this manner situated, vve must note, in vvhat place the inscisione might easyest vvith most convenie~ce be do ne, to vvitt thre fingers bredth vnder the navell, dravvinge ether tovvardes the left syde, or tovvarde the right, but not lineallye right forth, betvveene the navell, the privityes, be cause vve must eschevv, and avoyde, the vvhyt lyne vvhich in this place is situated, the endes, of the muscle Epigastri, alsoe the synnuis he te~donousnes, of the right muscle: because these vvou~ded or hurt, might suscitate, cause great payne, vvith manye other dau~gerous accide~tes, vvherfor they difficultlye vvilbe cu+red, vvhen as fayne vve vvould heale vp the vvounde.
Havinge noted all this, the Chirurgiane must vvith his left hande, his servant, vvhich assisteth him, nype in the length, the one, on the one syde, and the other, one the other syde, first of all the skinne, the incarnate or fleshye pa~nickle, of this syde, to lift it vp, cut it clean through overthvvarte, vnto the muscles, vvhich beinge effected, they must lett the foresayed elevated ski~ne, pannickle fall agayne: And to finnish the rest of our operatione convenientlye fitlye, after this first in scisione, (because the fore sayed skinne may fall agayne, one the inscisione, vvhich inscisione must alsoe bedone, in the muscles, and in the Peritoneo, to stoppe them, to prevent the runninge forth of the vvater, then vve shall lift vp the foresayed skinne) vve must agayne lift vp vvith the hande the skinne, the fleshye pannickle, and then as high as is possible follovve the fibers of the muscles, vve must easylye thruste in the crooked lancet, cut throughe the muscles, and Peritoneum, as broade as vve are vvonte to make the apertione in bloode lettinge, or phlebotomye, dilligentlye notinge, that vve nether touch anye vaynes, noe guttes, or any other parte vvhich is situated in the co~cavitye of the bellye.
Novv therfore to effect this, vve may vvith great co~venie~ce, dexteritye, in steade of the crooked lancet, vse our punctuall instrume~t, heere before discribed defigured, the inscision novv beinge done, vve must thrust cleane through the inscidede skinne, the fleshye pannickle, the muscles, and throughe the throughe cut Peritoneum, in to the concavitye of the bellye a goulden, or silver, pipe, as thicke as a qville or shaft, vvhich must have a broade end, that nothinge chau~ce to slippe betvveene into the concavitye of the bellye, and therone a little string, or threde tyed, by the vvhich foresayed pipe, the vvater must be tapped as it vveare, dravvn out, but not all at once, but by degrees not to superfluos at one time, but on divers dayes, to vvitt, so longe till nature, beinge released, lighted of her pack or butthe~, vvhich mitigatinge this evacuatione, governinge of the forces accordi~ge to the fortitude of the patient: vvhich vve may knovve, by feelinge of the Puls.
Because there are some, vvhich ha+vinge made to great an evacuatione at one time, have alsoe evacuated the vitall and livinge spirites, vvhich vveare therin inclosed, and finally have caused the patie~t his death.
VVhe~ as therfore vve shall have dravven vvater enoughe of at one time, vve must then stoppe the pipe, vvith a tente of linne~, or vvith a tent of sponge, to retayne the rest of the vvater, lay theron a great plaster of Diacalcitheos some there are vvhich dravve out the pipe, and let the vvounde vvhich is in the muscles and in the Peritoneo, the skinne, and the lippe of the vvou~de, vvhich before the inscisione vvas niped, and lifted vp, because that the foresayed vvounde, might thervv be stopped, and covered.
Novv certaynlye to retayne and keepe backe, the vvater Mr. Floris Phillippes, a verye renoumned Chyrurgiane, at Orleans, sticketh his needle qvite throughe both the lippes of the vvou~de, comprehendinge sufficient qva~titye of skinne, vvherin he letteth his needle sticke, as vve are vvonte to doe in the har mouthes, and vvindeth his threde rovvnde aboute the needle, vvhervvith he contayneth houldeth the lippes close together, soe that there may not one droppe of vvater passe forth, and vvhen he desireth to dravve, or tappe more vvater therout, he then vnvvyndeth his needle, openeth the lippes of the vvoun+de, vvithout dravving the threded needle ther out.
VVhilest that these thinges are this doinge, vve must strengthen the patient, vvith good cibaries and foode, vvhich easilye may be chaunged in to bloode, lett him soe rest vntill the next day: on vvhich day, if soe be he be stronge enoughe, vve must yet dravve of some more qvantitye of vvater, ether through the dravvinge out of the tente, vvher+vvith the pipe is stopped, vvhen as vve put the pipe therin, or vvith the elevatione of the skin+ne, vvhervvith the apertione is covered, vvith out puttinge the pipe anye more therin, if soe be there can issue anye vvater out, allvvayes egallinge or proportioninge the qvantitye of vvater, vvith the forces and strengthe of the patient, and in this manner must vve proceede in the dravving, or tappinge of, the vvater.
Others there are vvhich in the opening of the belly lay ther one a carrosive, vvher by the skinne is bitten corroded through, the~ they make an inscisione throughe the Escara, vnto the concavitye of the bellye, makinge a verye, smalle apertione, throughe the vvhich the vvater shall droppingly distill forth, havinge dravven therout sufficie~t vvater enoughe, the~ they stoppe it, vvith scraped linte, vvhich vvhen they are desirous to dravve more vvater therout, they the~ remove, take it of.
Yet ther are others, vvhich after the inscisione of the foresayed Escara, thrust therin a little pipe therebye to dravve the vvater out, as vve have above sayed.
Others set there on divers, and sundrye, corrosives, on the place of the liver, and of the milt, penetratinge nothinge deeper then the skin intatinge therin the doctrine of the auncie~t professors, vvhich vveare vvo~t sometime, to apply nine at once.
Others make small inscisions, like vnto little scarifications, one the sydes of the bellye, or els they lift vp the skinne, thrust there throughe a needle vvith a silke thred, vvhich threde they suffer to continue therin.
And consideringe that oftentimes, in those vvhich are troublede vvith the dropsy, there navell heaveth vp it selfe, yea and somtimes as bigge as an egge, vvhich standeth as cleere, as if it vveare a blather vvith vvater, there throughe have seene to be dravvne, a silke or vvotle~ threde, by the vvhich the patient perceaved great ease, consideringe the great qvantitye of vvater, vvhich through this apertione, is droppinge vvyse runne out.
Allsoe beyonde all this are the legges, the hippes, and the Scrotum often times, svvollen: for the vvhich there is noe better remedye, the~ that vve scarifye them throughe the skinne, once as broade, as the apertione is in phlebotomye: Some there be vvhich doe this by the innermost anckle or foure fingers above it.
have sometimes my selfe very luckylye ominouslye done the same, above the knees, and in the insyde of the hippes, in the bagge of the testicles, out of the vvhich first of all issueth a little vvaterye bloode, but immediatlye therafter the vvater superfluovslye issueth therout vvithout any inflammatione, soe that the foresayed scarifications, can not shutt, or heale, before all the vvater therof be issued, runne out, the patient all moste grovven smaller, the bellye evidentlye vvaxed thinner, vvhich in short time vvilbe effected, vvith out anye troublesome accidentes, happeninge thervnto, vvithout anye inflammatione in the foresayed partes.
More over vve are not to expecte anye daunger heerof as vve might vvel doe, vvhen as vve open the bellye of the Dropsy Ascites, because one this manner, the vvater vvith great qva~titye, at one time is not dravven of: and if soe be the patient, after that ther is a great qvantitye of vvater dravven of, beganne to be vveak, vve may as then restrayne the droppinge of the vvater, vvhe~ as vve cover the scarifications, vvith scraped linte, or vvith a fevve burned peeces of linnen, and soe stoppe it, binde it.
Out of the vvhich scarificatio~s, if soe be vve are disposed to dravve more vvater therout, vve as then vntye the foresayed place, take avvay the linte from the same cause the patie~t somvvhat to vvalke, or ride in a vvaggen or koache, if it be possible, vvith the legge hanginge out, To cause the vvater, verye superfluouslye to runne or issue out of the legges, Hippocrates commaeth vs, to rubbe the foresayed scarificatio~s vvith saulte, therafter stue them, vvith anye ferve~te or hott medicame~tes vve must allvvayes co~+tinually keep ope~ the same, to vvitt, vvith medicamentes vvhich are sharpe bitinge: because in such scarifications, the auncient professors, as Aetius, Asclepiades, Leonides, Hippocrates, and Archigenes, have allvvayes hadde great confidence therin.
But before vve must come to these scarifications, vve must consider one the strength, one the age. of the patie~t: for these apertions, are to noe vse, or co~modytye, to those, vvhich are vvholye overcome of the sicknes, nether those vvhich are very oulde, macile~te, becau+se that as vvell the one as the other, of these sca+rified partes, might easylye out of hande be mortifyed, vvithout beinge able in any sorte to retayne keepe backe the same, vvhero~ im+mediatlye follovveth death, by the vvhich ofte~ times, the Physicions, or the Chyrurgia~s, are iniuriouslye vvithout right blamed, and of all me~ hated had in little vvorthe, as my selfe have knovvne it happen vnto some, for the vvhich vvas not a little greeved.
How that we shall cure the water burst, called Hernia aquosa.
IN the Scrotum, vvhich vve call the bagg vvher in the testicles are contayned, is co~gregate gathered together a certayne, vvaterishe moysture, through the vvhich the fore sayed bagge commeth to svvel, vvhich tume factione, or inflatione, of the Greeckes is called Hydrocele, vvhich seemeth to be a particularre ki~de of Dropsye: must heere note that this svvellin+ge, sometimes co~meth but in one syde onlye: if soe be that this dissease proceedeth out of any antecedent or foregoinge occasions, it necessarilye follovveth, that the bloode, vvhich into all partes of the bodye is sent as nurriture, is permutated chaunged.
into some vvaterye substa~ce: if so be of any blovve, or fall, it produceth his originalle, then is conteyned in the svvellinge a blooddye kinde of moysture.
This aqvositye, remayneth not, in one cer+tayne place onlye because sometimes she is congreated situated betvveen the first seco~de membrane of the testicles: vve may knovve this, vvhen as vve depresse the svvellinge, because as then the foresayed moysture agayn by little little runneth therin: the bagge as then is more safter, nether can vve perceave anye hardenes, or tumefaction therin as the vvaterye moysture, vvhich is situated, vvithin the concavitye of the Scrotum, because the fore+sayed aqvositye, is not drive~ therin: yea also in the same syde, vvher the moystnes demonstra+teth her selfe, there lyeth the svvellinge in forme of an egge, or in an ovale figure, nether as then can vve ether throughe the sight perceave, or throughe the touchinge therof feele, any parte of the testicle, because the foresayed testicle lyeth therin hidden, and vvhen vve assemble liken them both together, he appeareth somvvhat greater, more svvollen, and vvhen as this svvellinge or inflation of the testicles is greate, the~ is the bagge of the testicles, vpvvardes somvvhat longe stretched out, and elevated, soe that the vpper end of the yarde, partlye alsoe vnder the tumefaction lyeth hidden, occulte.
Somtimes alsoe is this vvaterishe humidty secluded in a severall membrane, as in a little blather, the vvhich onlye for that purpose is constituted ordayned, as co~monlye chaunceth in the tumefactione Ateroma, and vvhen it is soe, then is the svvellinge rovvnde, closelye compacted together, soe that it seemeth to be a thirde testicle.
There is alsoe oftentimes, a ventosytye gathered together, in the bagge, or Scrotum, as if it vveare a vvaterye humiditye or moysture, vvhich rightlye to discerne knovve the one fro~ the other vve must consider that the vvindye Hernia, or burst, is partlye harde and light, and is at one time engendred, on the suddayn, subitlye ca~ it leese it selfe, departe: vvhere to the contrarye, the vvaterye Hernia, doth not vvholye departe, but vvaxeth somtimes a little smaller, consideringe anye smalle ague, or els consideringe the greate abstinence, that especiallye in yonge childrene.
If so be therfo+re that there be noe great qvantitye of moystu+re, or humiditye, then is the tumefaction soft, but if that there be greate qvantitye, it causeth then such a renitatione, or stretchinge out, as a bottle vvhich is full, and closelye stopped, is heavye in elevatinge, or liftinge vp: such a svvellinge by little little increaseth: the vaynes of the bagge of the testicles svvell, vvhe~ as vvith the fingers, vve thrust theron: the hume+ditye flyeth befor the finger, spreadethe her selfe rovvnde about the finger, that vvheron vve doe not crushe, beareth vp it selfe: and this vvaterishe humiditye, revealeth her selfe over thvvarte, as in a glasse, or in a blather: as easylye vve may espye, vvhen as vve houlde a ca~dle close thervnto, one the syde of the svvellinge, and looke then one the other syde: And soe farreforth as the humiditye, therin contay+ned, and occluded, be vvaterishe, then the inflatione or svvellinge glistenneth, is of such a colour, as the circumiacent partes therabout lyi~ge are: if soe be it be blodye, or like the vvine mother or dregges, and faeces of vvine, then is the svvellinge reddishe of coloure, or purple coloured: if soe be vve finde all these signes, and tokens, in both sydes of the Scrotum, or bagge of the testicles, it is then a signe of tvvo kindes of Hernia, to vvitt, in everye syde one.
All these svvelinges, of themselves, cause noe payne, vnles it vveare great spanninge, of that parte might chaunce, throughe the great tumefactions, and that especiallye, vvhereas the vvatery moysture lyeth inclosed, betvveen the membranes of the testicles.
Novve to abolishe such aqvositye, there is nothinge more profitable, and commodious, then to make an apertion therinne, on this manner as follovveth and succedeth.
Havinge shaved avvay the hayre, rovnde about the privityes (if soe bo the patient be noe childe) vve must then cause him to lye one his backe, ether one a bedde, or benche, beinge vvel stored of linne~, then vve must cause a servant, or helper, to stande one the one syde of the patient, on the other syde of the~ vvherin vve vvill make the apertione, vvhich foresayed servant, must dravve the yarde tovvarde him: then must the Chyrurgian vvith his left hande crushe, on the inferior parte of the bag+ge, because that parte vvhich he vvill thrust throughe might shevve it selfe the more stretched, and fuller of substance, and pricke vvith his right hande, vvherin he must have a stronge crooked lancett, from vpvvardes, dovvnevvardes, vnto the concavitye of the bagge of the testicles, because that the aqvosity may ru~ne out.
And if soe be the foresayed humiditye, lye inclosed in the me~branes of the testicles, vve must as then most gentlye, artificiallye, once agayne thrust therin, dilligentlye notinge, that vve chau~ce not to touch, the foresayed testicles, nether anye of the spermaticke vessels: and if the humiditye vveare inclosed in a blather, the Chyrurgiane must then vvith his left hande, crushe one the inferior parte of the bagge, on this manner to drive vpvvardes the svvellinge, and the svvellinge beinge there retayned kept, vve must co~tinue it in this place, least that she sincke dovvnevvardes agayne, and vvith the crooked lancet, cut in the nethermost part of the foresayed Scrotum vnto the blather, or bagge, vvherin the humiditye lyeth inclosed, let it runne therout, as muche as is possible: And if soe be, it be able to be done, vve must take therout, some parte of the bagge, or blather, because it should not heale agayne, other vvater therin be engendred: then vve must put therin a great tente made of linte, vvhich must not be to harde vvounde, thervvith to keepe open the vvou~de, and not so quicklye heal it: for if soe it come to be too soone healed, shutt ther might then chaunce to be an other collectione, and gatheringe together of vvater, soe that it might be right needfull, to be sure of the curinge of the same, that as much as vve ca~, vve cause the membranes, to be purified, and cleansed, of all the humiditye, and moysture vvhervvith they are throughlye soaked.
Some there are vvhich applye alsoe in the superior parte of the Scrotum, a potentiall cauterye, the operatione vvherof beinge done, they the~ make an inscisione in the Escara, vnto the concavitye of the Scrotum, vvherin the foresayed vvater lyeth inclosed, then suffer the foresayed Escara of her selfe to fall out and separate.
Such an apertione, vvhich is made vvith corrosive, can not soe easylye be cured, soe that in the meane season the vvater hath time enoughe to issue out therat.
Others, dravve through the svvellinge, vvith a strong needle, a silke~ threede, in steade of making an inscisione, or applyinge of the corrosive, in place of a Seto~, or transforatio~ vvher through the foresayed vvater by little little leaketh out.
But the apertione vvhich is least dau~gerous of these three foresayed, is, the inscisio~, vvherof noe, or at the least, verye small accidentes, can ensue, if soe be she be done expertlye, and one a convenie~t place.
It appeareth according as vve have above tought, in the openinge of Apostemations, that the apertion of the Scrotum, or bagge, reqvireth to be done in the infe+rior partes of the same: notvvithstandinge experie~ce teacheth vs, that ther happeneth farre more payne, inflammation, vnto it, vvhen the inscisione is made belovve, the~ vvhen she is done made above, tovvardes the fla~ckes: for ther is lesse dau~ger of hurtinge of the testicles above, or ther membrane, because it is situated more inferior, vvher all the fibers, of the foresayed Scrotu~, doe finishe end, vvherfore, they are verye sensible paynfull.
So that Celsus, Paulus, cou~cell vs, that vve should make the inscisio~ close by the flanckes.
VVhe~ as therfore this species, and kinde of Hernia, is double, vve must then make doe such an operation one both sydes, especiallye vvhen vve se, that they doe not in any sort assvvage.

SOme men there are, vvhich have a certayne excresce~ce, of fleshe in the nostrells, vvhich resumeth her originalle, out of the bone, Etmoidis, or Chribleus, out of the bones of the nose.
This excrescence happeneth or commeth to a man, by little little at once, and at the last, she vvaxeth soe bigge, huge in qva~titye, that she stoppeth the vvhole nostrells, sometimes alsoe hangeth dovvne to the lippes, by the vvhich the patient, is mervelouslye molested, as vvell in speakinge, as breathinge.
Sometimes also shee grovveth in the entra~ce, or conductione, through the vvhich the ayer, the breath, are dravvne into the throte, the vvhich vve may easilye see, vvhen as the patie~t openeth his mouthe, behinde the pallaet of the mouth, in such a greatnes somtimes, that she stoppeth the throate, vvherthroughe the patient co~meth in the end to be cho~aked, if that in time vve doe not prevent it, And because such an excresce~ce of fleshe, most commonlye is softe, and pale, havinge divers small sproutes, not mislike vnto the feet, of the fishe Purpura, it is therfore of the Greeckes called Polipus, allso in our langvage Polipus.
There are noe sortes of Polipus vvhich being venoumous, have neede of the operatione of Chyrurgerye, because vve may not touch the~, in like sorte vve may not touch those vvhich are infected vvith the Cancer, because ther nature is thervvith polluted, they ther through spoyled.
The yo~ge Chyrurgiane, may knovve them by there sensiblenes, because they are verye dolorous, full, of payne, extreame hard, beinge allmost purple coloured, vvith a very stincki~g odoure, or smelle, on the vvhich the Chyrurgiane shall doe nothinge, but must be handled as if it vveare the Cancker, to vvitt, throughe koolinge, dryinge, throughe mol+lifyinge medicamentes, throughe the vvhich her excrescence may be praevented.
That Polipus, vvhich is insensible, or vvhere there is little, or noe payne, vvhich is vveake, loose, tractable, vvithout bei~ge irritated, pale, or vvhich is of a reddishe coloure, those vve may throughe the operation of Chyrurgerye take in handes.
To the effectuatinge of vvhich, the auncie~te Chyrurgia~s, those vvhich have follovved there doctrine, have effected this operatione cruellye enoughe: for some there are vvhich vvith an instrument cutt rovvnde, or circkle vvyse this Polipum, vvhich to that end purpo+se, therto they have caused to be made, and is called in greeke Polyticon Pathion, vvithout touchinge of the cartilage, or grisle, vvhich beinge effected, they dravve forthe the foresayed descided Polipus, vvith an instrument much like vnto an eare picker, or els vvith some kinde of hoocke, then they cure heal the vlceratio~, as it reqvireth to be don.
And as co~monly there remayneth some little peece of roote, in the bones Etmoides, of the nose, the vvhich they scrape of, alsoe from the foresayed bones turninge, thrusti~ge therin, vvith an instrume~t, to fetche all therout, that by any meanes possible might tarrye, and remayne therein.
Others endevour to consume, annihilate the foresayed Polypum, vvith certayne causticke, or vstive medicame~tes, as vvith Aqva fortis, vvith oyle of vitrioll, or vvith the liqvefacted, moulten corrosive, in the vvhich they dippe, madefye little smalle tentes, vvhich they lay therone, vvith or throughe a little pipe, because they shoulde not hurte the nose one the internalle or inner syde.
Others ther are, vvhich vvith an actuall cauterye, cauterize it, vvhich throughe a pipe they thrust therin.
Others, after the exa~ple the four famous Chyrurgians, vvhich not beinge of opinion, that in noe vvyse, or in anye sorte vve vveare able to cauterize the Polipus, vnto his roote, because he is soe deepe ingraffed, they the~ make an inscisione, one the one syde, of the cartilage of the nose, vnto the bone of the same, havinge in this sort discovered, denudatede the Po+lipu~ vnto his roote or first ofspringe, originalle, then they there cutt, cauterise him, stitch together agayne the sayed inscisione, as vve are commonlye vsed to doe in the hare mouthes.
The vvise, Learned man Guido de Cauliaco, liketh commendeth this, or such like operatione, but in noe vvise, counceleth, to stitch vp the inscision, before the foresayed Polipus, be vvholy eradicated, rooted out, be+cause if soe be, that anye parcell therof remayne, it agayne increaseth, vvhich happening he, to be soe, all the trouble, paynes of the patient, hath binne done for nothinge, to noe purpose.
All vvhich operations, beinge as sufficiently and completlye effected as they possi+ble may be, yet for the patie~t they are tedious trouble some, as often times, vve have vvith our eyes behelde, vvhich to speake the very truthe indeede, they have never attayned vnto ther perfecte, and former health agayne, but rather farre vvorse, then better: vvherby vve vveare moved, to trye. make experiment of a far more ominous, and more convenient operatio~, to the curinge of this dissease, vvhich consistethe in the vvhole eradicatione of the same.
To the vvhich end and purpose it seemeth vnto vs convenient, that vve situate, dispose the patient, on the most convenient ma~ner vve may, in a seate, tovvardes the light, the Chyrurgian, vvith his left hande openin+ge the nostrell, vvherin the Polipus is situated, shall vvith his right hande, thrust therin the flat to~ges, as deepe as possibly he may, (vvhich tonges must be so~vvhat broade, like a Duckes) bil vvhervvith he must nipe the foresayed Polipu~, gentlelye vvith both his handes turne vvinde the same, thervvith alsoe dravve tovvardes him a little, not at one plucke, because the roote vvhich is fast setled in the foresayed bones, might alsoe follovve, the foresayed Polipus at one time be dravven forthe, and extirpated: vvhich my selfe may vvith the truthe alleadge to have done, vvith verye little payne.
Mr. Sourlin, a verye experte Chyrurgian, hath assured me, that he alsoe divers times hath done it one the same manner, vvithout anye inconvenience.
But the Chyrurgyane must consider, that he doe not adve~ture on such an operatione, then in that Polipus vvhich is tractable, and not canckerouse, vvhich is greate enough, to be griped, vvith out breakinge to be extirpated, vvherfore, if it be not great enoughe, vve as then let him grovve, increase.
And soe farre forth as the fore+sayed Polipus, drevve himselfe vpvvardes, avoydinge the nipinge, of the little to~ges, vve must the~ dravve it dovvnevvardes, vvith a little hoo+ke, because as then vve may the better, take houlde therone: the operatio~ beinge finished, ther ensueth an effluxio~ of bloode prese~tlye, therafter, vvhich vve shall permitte, suffer to bleed, because that parte may be therof released, vnburthened: vve must then cause the patie~t, through his nose to snufle vp redd vvyne, that as oftentimes a daye, vntill such time as it be internally cured, vvithout applyinge any pingveditye, or oyles thervnto. [leaf motif]Of the haremouthe, or splitted and cloven lippes.
THe cleavinge, or splittinge, vvhich daylye vve see, in the lippes, in the eares, and in the nose, is of Galen called Coloboma, in Lattin Curtum, vvhen as these partes throughe anye naturall dissease, are splitted, or clovene, as if there vveare a peece cutt out.
It is impossible, that vve should ingendre, anye other matter, restore, the substa~ce, vvhich therin is vvantinge, because it is the vvorke of nature not of the Chyrurgiane: but he may bringe the separated partes the one, by the other, and cause such a substa~ce, vvhich in that parte is deficie~t, vvantinge shall seeme as it vveare there in ingendred, soe that verye hardlye vve shall espye, marke such an vnseemlines, deformitye, especiallye if the slitte have binne but small: for these disseases might per adventure be soe greate, that they shoulde be incurable, and vveare not conveniente for vs to lay handes one them, if soe be vve endevoured to cure them, vve might chaunce to make them farre vvorse, more vnseemlye, then before they vveare.
VVherfore the Chyrurgiane ought dilligentlye to consider, that one such kindes of fissures or splittinges, he impose not his handes, and especiallye in those vvhich are to vvyde seperated the one from the other, vvhere there is to much substa~ce deficient or vvantinge, betvveene them bothe, for vvhen a Chyrurgian endevoureth to cure such a dissease, then must necessarylye the seiunged and separated partes, ether ioyn, heale together agayn, or els not: if soe be they grovve, ioyn together, the lippe the~ is merveylouslye stretched, lyeth close to the teethe, one the gu~+mes: And if soe be they ca~ not souder, ioyn the on vvith the other, the fissure, or splitting, vvilbe much greater, then before it vvas, because co~sideringe that, vvhich one both sydes vvas taken cutt avvaye, through vvhich occasione, the patiente, as then can farre and much more difficulter eate, and also speaketh vvorse, because that a co~plete, vvhole lippe, is verye co~venie~te, necessarye, as vvell to the commestione, as to the loquution, speeche.
This manuale operatione, is verye daungerous in aged persons, in those vvhich are vn+healthesame, of bodye, or in those, vvhich (as vve commonlye say) have noughtye healinge fleshe, because, that in ma~s bodye there is noe parte or place, vvhere in the Ca~cker ca~ sooner come, and beinge therin, vvherin he may be vvorse cured, vvith more difficulty healed.
The meanes to cure such a dissease, is on this manner: VVhe must first of all situate the patie~t tovvardes the light, vvith our left ha~de, lift vp the right syde of the cloven or splitted lippe, as then cut vvith the crooked lancett, in the middle or vpper end of the foresayed syde of the lippe, through the skinne, alsoe betvveene them both beginninge as highe, as neere the nose, as possible might be done, dravvi~ge the foresayed la~cett, vnto or tovvardes beneath or end of the lippe, because that the vvhole interiace~t skinne, might be cleane therof separated and severed: then vve must change handes, takinge in our right ha~de, the other syde of the clove~ lippe, vvhich is situated in the left syde, then vve must cut vvith the left hande, even as before vve have done vvith the right, because the clove~ lippe, may on all sydes be cut, on the edges be brought to ravv fleshe, vvithout leavinge the least parte thereof vntouched, vvhich is not cut, or ma+de ravv, ether in the infierior, or superior partes therof, that nothinge differinge from a greene, freshe, bloodye vvou~de, before vve assay to stitch them the one vvith the other.
This beinge one such a manner effected, and that parte havi~ge somevvhat bledde, vve must as then contracte ioyne together both the cut partes, as close, and as smoothe as by anye meanes possible vve may, and thrust a needle throughe both the foresayed revnited partes, thrustinge deepe enoughe through the fleshe, suffere the needle to remayne therin, one the vvhich vve must rovvnde about vvi~de the threde, as the Taylers are vvonte to doe, vvhe~ anye vvhere one there apparrell they sticke there needle there to keepe it: As farre as the fissure or splittinge be greate, vve may as then sticke tvvo needles there in, the one vnder, the other above.
If soe be the separated partes, of the foresayed lippe, can not vvith any facilitye, or ease be brought together, vve must the~ make tvvo inscisions, in eache syde of the lipp one, informe likenes of a halfemoone, both the korners therof tovvardes the vvou~d, as heer befor in the figure vve may see, vvhich inscisiones must onlye penetrate the vpper skinne, because that the edges of the vvounde beinge dravvne together, might the better ioyne the one vvith the other, for vvith anye violence they may not be compelled, but rather, vvith gentlenes, and vvithout any force, because that, they beinge brought and ioyned the one vvith the other, be not agayne vvithdravvne backvvardes.
It chaunceth alsoe sometimes, that the skinne one the on syde of the fissure, can not completlye vnite her selfe vvith the other, vvhere throughe, that place of the vvounde, is deformed mishape~, because it is not vvholye cooperte, coverede, seinge therfore that this soe chaunceth, vve must as then cut this sayed parte halfemoone vvyse, vvithout in anye sorte touchi~g the other syde.
If so be the acuitye or poyncte of the needle vvhich sticketh in the vvounde, or lippe, sticketh somevvhat lo~ge throughe the other syde, vve must nipe, or breake it of vvith certayne pinsers or tonges because it shoulde not pricke or hoocke in anye other place, vve must applye theron, a plaster of Betonica, in those inscisions vvhich are made in the forme of a halfemoone, vve must applye therone onlye drye linte, because the lippes, or edges therof, might not heale, because that the fleshe vvhich therin increaseth, doe not replenishe the vvounde, the lippe ther throughe be made broader.
The foresayed suture, is commonlye healed together the seaventh day, and soudered the one vvith the other, vvhen as therfore vve espye marke that it is soe, that they are ioyned the one vvith the other, vve must cut of the threde vvhich is vvounde rovvnde about the needle, plucke the needle therout, cure the remane~t of the vvou~de, alsoe the stitches of the needle, as necesitye reqvireth the same to be done, and effected.
The lippes are some times splitte, or cleft in tvvo sundrye, divers places, but thero~ is not soe much consistinge, if they be not soe farre separated the one fro~ the other, as if there vveare a noteable peeces cutt therout, because othervvyse it is as vvell easilye to be cured as the single fissure.
If soe be there be any excresse~ce of fleshe, or any cartilage, fovvnde aboute the lippes, or in anye place, vvhich necessarilye is to descided vve must alsoe cut that out, because, in all places it might be of an aequalle smoothenes.
As co~cerninge, touchinge the fissures, of the eares, or nostrelles, vve must therevvith proceede, on such a ma~ner, as heertofore vve have sayed of the splittinges and fissures of the lippes.
Of the vlceratione, and excrescence of the gummes, called Paroulis, and Epoulis.
AFter the inflammation, or inscensione of the gummes, com+mo~lye succede the follovve the an excrescence of fleshe, vvhich of the auncie~te professors vvas called Epoulis, that especiallye about the checke, or hindermost teethe.
Such a humor, excresce~ce encreseth by little, little, till at last it increaseth as bigge as a hennes egge, soe that sometimes the teeth there throughe fall out, and the patient not able to open his mouthe.
If soe be these excrescences be blacke, and Canckerouse, vve must not applye there one any sharpe, or corrodent medicamentes, nether vvith byndinge separate, roote them oute: but must entreate, handle them, in such sorte, as before vve have spoken of the Cancker, and like all palliative cures.
If soe be this excrescence be tender, soft, tractable, vve must vvhilest it is smalle, descyde cut it avvay, if soe be it be great, vve must the~ bynde it of, vvith a stronge threde, vvhich vve must alligate, and tye vnder at the roote therof, and by degrees knitt it closer, till that in thus doinge, the roote by the threde be cutt throughe, and the excrescence fall out of the mouthe.
Such a ligature or byndinge is farre surer, the~ the discidinge or cuttinge of, the same, because that therthroughe, vve neede feare noe superfluous bleedinge, the roote better one this manner be taken out, allsoe the patient have lesse payne, and feare to expecte, then of the inscisione, or cuttinge, and cauteri+satione, vvhich after the inscisione co~seqve~tlye follovvethe.
VVhen as therfore througe byndinge, vve have discided this carnositye, or excrescens, that she reverteth cometh agayne, as often times chaunceth, vve muste as then religate binde agayne the same, or cut it, and cauterize the roote therof, it be ether vvith a little actuall Cauterium, or vvith a little oyle of Vitroll, vvith Aqvafortis, or vvith anye other liqvefacted corrosive, vvhich vve finde thervnto most convenient.
parte of the aunciente professors, vveare vvo~te to applye therone, some or other corrosive poulder, on the same, vvhere of the excrescence might clean be corroded avvaye, vvhich in mye opinione is verye inco~veniente, especiallye in these partes.
There is as yet an other kinde of vlceration, or tumefactione incident vnto the gummes, vvhich of our praedicessors vvas called Paroulis vvhich perseavi~ge it to be come to his full maturation, ripnes, vve must immediatlye make therin an apertione, inscisione, vvith the crooked lancett, vvhich must be of an indiffeferent latitude, because it might not agayne chaunce, to cause a revlceratio~ or svvellinge, soe chaunce to chaunge it selfe into a fistle: beinge aperte, and open the patient must vvashe his mouth vvith some grosse redde vvyne, vvhich must be so~vvhat vvarme, to exsiccate, drye, to confort, to repelle, drive backe if neede soe reqvire to stoppe, and restayne bloode: the next day follovvi~ge he must vvashe his mouth vvithhonye vvater, to the purginge, and purifyinge of the dissease.
This vlceration, must immediatlye be openede, because the matter, chau~ce to make noe more concavitye, and the cheecke bone therthroughe chau~ce to be polluted.
If soe be ther chaunce any corruptinge, and rottenes in the gummes, vve must then annoynte them vvith a littie Aqvafortis, but vvith due consideratione, and discretione.
And because that oftentimes immediatlye after the disseases Paroulis, or Epoulis, there commonlye engendreth, and commeth a fistle in the gummes, vvhich pene+trateth, pearceth vnto the cheeckebon, vve must note, if the root of the tooth be not rotten, corrupt or altered, for if so be it vveare soe, (as ofte~times it happeneth) vve must dravve forth the toothe, and correcte the place, vvherin the tooth hath stoode ether vvith a cauterye, or vvith oyle of Vitriolle, and if soe be ther be any parte of the cheecke bone corrupt, by this meanes, nature vvill expell and drive from her the corrupted peece of bone, vvithout vvith violence to dravve forth the same.
[leaf motif]Of the retentione of the tu~ge, which of the Greeckes was called, Anciloglossum, and we nowe call it tungetyed: And of the vlceration vnder the tunge, which of the Greeckes is called Batrachos, of our moderne Physicions Ranula.
THe tunge in some persons, or children, is shorter then shee ought to be, vvhervvith they are borne, and by the vvhich occasio~, they must vvith difficulty vtter the vvordes vvhich they vvoulde speake, the tunge beinge intercepted, and hindred, by a certayne ligament, vvhich vve call the spa~ned vayn, vvherthroughe the to~ge, is restrayned, as it vveare, seemeth to be brydeled, or throughe any membrane thervnder situated, vvheron the tunge resteth, because shee can not soe move her selfe, and turne, as it vveare convenient, shee shoulde.
The children are verye longe time before they beginne to speake, vvhe~ as they beginne, they as the~ speake verye festivouslye hastilye, vvithout any hinderance, excepte in vtteringe of those vvordes, vvhich are difficulte to pronounce, as are those, in the vvhich manye R. R, R. and L. L. L. come.
This dissease, is alsoe sometimes accide~talle vnto a man, vvhen as after anye vlceratione vnder the tunge, there remayneth a harde callousnes, anguste cicatrice, vvherof the tu~ge sometimes, inspeaking must dubble redubble her selfe, they vvhich are troubled vvith this imperfection, doe speake vvith great paynes difficultye, vvherfore the auncient professors of foretimes, have called the~ Mogilaous.
The fore sayed dissease must be cured onlye throughe the manualle operatio~.
To vvhich ende purpose, vve must situate place the patiente as the matter is reqviringe, the serva~t of the Chyrurgiane havinge both his fingers vvounde vvith fine linne~ (to vvitt, the thumbe, the first finger) vvherevvith he must take the foresayde tu~ge by the end, lift her vp, tovvardes the roofe of the mouth: vvhich beinge done, if soe be the membranes vvherone the tunge is fastenede, be cause, of the difficultye of speech, the~ must the Chyrurgian vvitth a smalle hooke, as is before describede, houlde the same thervvith fast, vvith his left hande, vvhen indiffierentlye he shall have stretched out the same, he must as then ether vvith the poyncte of his scissors, or els vvith his crooked lancet, cutt, and discide it of.
If soe be the shortnes be caused because the ligament of the tunge, is to shorte, stretcheth it selfe more then is needefull tovvarde, the middle of the tunge, or els because of anye cicatrice: vve must then alsoe in like sorte take houlde on all that vvith the hooke, plucke or dravve it, cut it of, vvhich is obdurated harde, alsoe all that vvhich vvith the naturall fleshe of the tunge is not moved, or stirred.
This operatione then beinge effected, the patie~t must vvas he his mouthe, vvith a little vva+ter vineger, dilligentlye stirre the tunge, often times thruste her forth of his mouth, rubbe or vvipe his finger thervnder, ofte~ times vvith his teethe crushe her vp tovvardes the roofe of the mouth, because that the foresayed ligament, or me~brane, doe not chaunce to ioyne grovve fast agayne thero~: for as the stirringe, removinge vp dovvne, are a hin+dera~ce, vnto the healinge of the same, soe is all so qvietnes, stillnes, an occassion of the vnitinge, co~binatione of the same: yea he must alsoe in the night seaso~ lay a compresse vnder his tunge, there by to hinder, delay the curinge of the vvounde, vvhich easilye sleepinge might chau~ce come to passe, that because the tunge, nether by eatinge, nor by speakinge is in anye sorte stirred or moved.
Some of our auncie~t professors, to prevent the dau~ger, of bleedinge in such an operation, thruste through the membranous ligame~t, or through the cicatrice, vvherby the tu~ge is kept bou~de tyed, a needle vvith a threde, vvhich by degrees they dravve plucke together vntill such time the membrane heervvith be cut a sunder.
VVhen as vve vvould cut the tunge tyednes in yonge childre~, vvhich are nuely borne, vve must first of al vvith the finger lift vp the tu~ge, vvith the poyncte of the scissors, descide, and cutt of the membrane vvhich is situated vnder the tunge, the~ vvith the finger vvipe a little sault therin rubbe it, vvithout doinge anye thinge els there to, commaundinge the nourse, to doe the same once, or tvvice more.
It may alsoe chaunce that the speech is impedited hindered, by reason of some vlceratione, vvhich commeth vnder the tu~ge, called Batrachos, or Ranula, in vvhich vlceratione, ther lyeth a vvaterishe humiditye therin inclosed, vvhich often times is not dislikinge vnto the vvhyte of an egge, as vvell consideringe the consistence therof, as concerning the colour, allvvayes commonlye beinge included in a little membrane, like vnto the vlceratione Ateroma, manye other coulde vlcerations or svvellinges.
In have seene such manner of svvellinge, tumefactions soe greate and soe often times (after they have binne thruste through to lett out the matter) returne agayn, that the patie~t, by reaso~ of the greatnes coulde not speake, yea allsoe in davvnger ther throughe of styfelinge, or smotheringe, soe that have knovvne them to have binne opened foure times in one daye, and at everye season a ha~defull of matter to issue therout, like vnto slime, and the vvhyte of an egge.
The vvhich hath binn soe difficult to be cured, that in the end vve have binne compelled, to applye ther one an actualle Cauterium, in vvhich large and vvyde apertione, vve have imposed layed in linte, being madefyed and made vvett in oyle of vitriolle, by the vvhich at the last the patie~t is sovvndlye, and completlye cured.
Novv to cure this dissease, vve must first of all make an apertione, vvith the crooked lancet, accordinge to the length of that parte and not thvvart or crosseover, to give issue passage to the humiditye matter to runne out, vvhich is the occasione of this tumefactione, or vlceratione: and if soe be this svvelling returne, the surest remedye, as the~ is the actuall cauterye.
To vvhich intent, vve must vvel, and convenie~tly situate the patie~te, cause his heade to be stayed, helde by his servant, vvith the one hande one his heade, and the other vnder his chinne, there aboute vvhere the foresayed vlceration is situated, because partlye there throughe it may be elevated and lifted vp, for the Chyrurgiane vvith more ease facilitye to attayne to his purpose, vvhen as vvith the la~cet or vvith the cauterie vve vvill make ther in an apertione: For those partes beinge tender, softe, hovv little soever they be crushed yet notvvitsta~dinge yeeld the~selves invvardes vvher throughe the apertion might be hindered fayled, and all our laboure be lost, bestovved in vayne.
The patient therfore in this sorte beinge settled and disposed, and beinge by some serva~t helde faste, must ope~ his mouthe, then shall the Chyrurgiane vvith his left hande lay a peece of lattinne or a silver plate vnder the tunge of the patient, vvhich hath a hole in the middest therof right on the place, vvhere vve desire to make the apertione, then must the Chyrurgiane take in his right hande a glovvinge or redde hotte Cauterium, vvhich he must sittuate right one the hole of the fore+sayed peece of Lattinne thrust the same into the concavitye of the foresayed vlceration: in soe doinge are the circumiacent partes defended from all combustione or burninge, the vlceratione verye convenientlye opened.
This apertion beinge on such a manner effected, brought to passe, vve must cause the patient to vvash his mouthe, vvith a or gargrise, vvhich must be made of of Plantine, and of [leaf motif]Howe we ought to cauterize, cutt of, or bynde, and tye, the pallate, or Vvula of the mouth.
NAture hath in the posteriore partes of the mouth created, a spongiouse, carnall or fleshye dugge, as thick, rovvnd. as is the end of a shaft, or qvill as easilye vve may see, vvhen as vve open the mouth.
This reservinge his naturall proportione, the Greeckes as the~ call it Gargareon, the Latinistes, Gurgulio, vve the pallate of the mouthe: but the same beinge amplifyed, and grovven greater, then naturallye it is, through the discendinge of any superfluous humors, beinge of one crassitude above, beneath, it is as then of the Greeckes called Chiou, in Lattin Columella, as if vve vvoulde say, a little pillaer: but if soe be it be belovve rovvnder it is as then of the aunciente professors called Staphila, of the Lattines, Vva, and of vs, the sincking or fallinge of the pallate.
It hath sometimes such a longitude, depending one the tunge, that the patient allvvayes supposeth, to have somvvhat in the throt, vvhich verye vvillingly he vvoulde svvallovve.
That vvhich is blacke, vve must not in anye vvyse meddle vvith, or take in handes, in like sorte alsoe the same being vvholye inflamed, because as then vvith out daunger vve can by noe meanes possible, descide and cutt it of, because of the superfluous bleedinge vvhich conseqventlye follovveth, vvherfore as then vve ought rather to vse all such medicamentes as still, and assvvage payne, vvhich moysten and madefye, and gentlye fortifye strenghthen the patie~t.
But if soe be that there be noe inflammatione, the pallate be thoroughe soaked vvith humors, is vvaxed verye longe, vvhyte, pale, and sharpe, vve must as then cutt it of: as vve must alsoe doe vvhen it is above thinne, and belovve thicke.
This dissease may be cured, by takinge avvay that, vvhich in the pallate is oppugnant vnto nature, ether throughe dissectione, or throughe cauterizinge, or els throughe bindinge of the same.
If soe be vve feare anye superfluous bleedinge, it is then the surest, shortest, easiest vvaye, to discide it, because the patie~t ther throughe might be freede from manye more miseries, calamityes, mischau~ces, vvherine othervvyse he might in time chaunce to fall as is the cough, through the co~tinuallirritatio~ of the forefayed longe hangi~ge pallate, omissione, losse, of sleepe, somtimes alsoe the choackinge, soe that vve notinge observinge all these thinges, are of te~ times compelled, for the succoure of the patient, to effect our extreame, and laste remedye, to preserve and keepe him from greater daunger ensvinge.
And aptlye to bringe this to passe, vve must cause the patient to sit in a verye lucent and lightsome place, and alsoe to set apert vvide open his mouth, and depresse his tunge vvith the Speculum oris, then take houlde one the foresayed pallate, vvith a litte instrument, or to~ges made onlye for that purpose, leavinge as much hanginge of the pallate vnder the foresayed tonges, or instrumente, as is to longe, nought, as must be cutt of, pluckinge of the same a little tovvardes him, because that vvith the poynct of the scissors, he may convenientlye cutt of, that vvhich hangeth vnder the foresayed instrument or tonges but not that vvhich is above the foresayed instrument as easylye it may be done, for vven as this pallate, is tender, spongious, and covered vvith a me~brane, vve as the~ easylye take houlde theron vvhen as vve vvoulde plucke him, vvherfore some Chyrurgians have oftentimes binne deceaved, supposinge him to be much longer, vvherfore they have cutt him to shorte, allmost cleane avvay, vvhere throughe allsoe verye troublesome, and difficulte accidentes have follovved: because this bei~ge happened, al the pectorall partes, are haynouslye merveylouslye therthrough offended, vvith greate difficultye of vvel speakinge, yea sometimes allsoe vvith vvant of speech, or dumnes: vvherfore vve ought not onlye to leave the roote, vvheron that this dugge, or this pallate is fastened, but somvvhat more, and onlye cut of that, vvhich above his naturall constitutione seemeth to be toe longe.
Others there are vvhich take houlde on this pallate, vvith an in+strument called Staphilagres, vvhervvith they vvringe it rovvnde about, havinge vvrunge it rovvnde, it vvaxeth crooked, purple coloured, and in the sectione therof issveth little bloode therout.
Beinge novv descided cutt of, if soe be there follovved a greate effluxione of bloode, vve must as the~ cause the patient to gargrise his mouth vvith vvater and vineger, and then vvith some constringent decoctione vvhich hath bi~ boyled vvith grosse redde vvyne, or els touch the place, orvvype it vvith some stronge cauterisinge vvater, vvhervvith the opened vaynes might be seared together.
The seconde manner, of effectinge this same, is done vvith an actuall, or a pote~ciall cauterye: as concerninge the actuall cauterye, vve must therevnto have in a readines and praepared, a sylver, or copper pipe, vvhich in the one end therof must have a little apertione in sorme of a little vvindovve, to receave there in that parte of the pallate, vvhich you resolve to cauterize, then you shall put into the pipe your glovvinge actuall cauterye, vvhich vvith his end vvill abolishe and take avvay that, vvhich shall ha~ge there in as if it vveare vvith a little cheesell stroke~ of, and one this manner vve must cauterize, and cutt of the pallate eve~, and smothe.
Touchinge the potentiall cauterye, or corrosive, vve must first receave, into the apertio~ or vvindovve of the foresayed pipe, that parte of the pallate, vvhich vve desire to corrosive, and then vvith a privett or searchi~ge iro~ thrust into the foresayed pipe, a peece of corrosive, aganst the foresayed peece of pallate of the mouth, and continue the same therone a certayne time, dilligentlye consideringe, that not anye parte of the corrosive, fall one the tunge, or the throte, vvhen as throughe the humiditye of the pallate it beginneth to liqvefye.
And vvhe~ vve desire to take avvay the foresayed pipe, vve must the~ first of all lay the Speculum oris, one the tunge, because as the~ noe parte of the foresayed corrosive, chaunce to light or fall one any of the subteriace~t partes, nether touch any parte, but the pallate onlye because therby they might be indammaged, and hurte.
Thus havinge brought this to passe, vve must annoynt the pallate vvith a little oyle of roses, vvith a little cotten or linnen there in beinge madefied, and made fatt, then shall the patient vvashe his mouth vvith a little roosevvater.
sorte ther are vvhich doe not vse the fore+sayed pipe, but they dippe, moysten, a little cotten, or linnen, vvhich is tyed to the privet, or searchinge iron, in oyle of vitriol, or Aquafortis, vvith the vvhich they touche the pallate, and cauterize it, the tunge before beinge layed dovvne vvith the Speculo oris, the~ a little season follovvinge they vvashe it vvith Pla~tinevvater.
Others take a little kinde of spoone, (vvhich of our praedecessors vvas called Staphilocausto~ full implete vvith poulder, of corrosive, full Aquafortis, or oyle of Vitriolle, vvherin they cause the end of the pallate to depe~de, allvvay before havinge layed dovvne the tunge vvithe the Speculo oris, and by this meanes they cauterize, consume, the pallate vvhich before vvas to longe: it is right true, that some of this corrosive in the spoone might chau~ce to fall one the tunge, vvherfore vvoulde rather councell to vse that corrosive vvhich is thicke and of some crassitude, as that is vvhich may be pulverisated beaken to poulder, because vvithout beinge pulverizated it can not shevve his forces one the pallate.
VVhen as therfore, throughe the applicatione of anye of the fore sayed corrosives, or cauteryes, the place of the pallate beginneth to be blacke, it is then a signe that it is sufficie~tlye cauterised, and if soe be the coloure therof be not, as yet chaunged, vve must then yet once agayne applye the corrosive thervnto, then cause the patient to gargrise his mouth vvith Oxicrate or vvith vvarme redd vvyne.
have knovvne the suncken pallate to be lifted vp agayne, vvith a little povvnded pepper saulte, by a spoone, beinge therone fastened: others vse there to some astringe~t poulders.
The thirde meanes, to cure this dissease, is effected by ligature, because of the timorous+nes vvhich the patient conceaveth of the cuttinge of, or cauterizinge the same, or effluxion of bloode.
VVhich is effected and completlye brought to passe, vvhe~ as vvith a stronge threde vve tye the fore sayed pallate vnderneathe, in that place vvher it surpasseth his naturall lengthe: throughe vvhich ligature, the inferior parte can obtayne noe nouriture, because the vaynes by the threde are suffulced stopped vp, soe that in a short time the threde cuttethe of, and causeth to separate that vvhich hath binne bovvnde, the superior parte beinge allmost cicatrized, vvith out any feare of anye superfluous bleedi~ge.
The meanes hovve verye neatlye, and convenientlye to effect this operatione, and allsoe the instrument thervnto servinge, is described vnto you before amo~ge the figures of the instrumentes.
The vse of the foresayed pallate of the mouthe, shevveth vnto vs, that vve ought to observe a meane, in cuttinge of the same, vvhe~ as it surmountethe the naturalle longitude, or els the vse therof is brought to nought, and loste, because therthroughe, the voyce of ma~ is formed, and retayned, as the mouth or apertione of a Citerne, vvhen as vve touch the stringes therof, she as then geveth a sovvnde, even soe the breath of man, vvhich is the substance of the voyce, issuinge forth of the longes beinge divided, and spreade over, and throughout the vvhole roofe of the mouth, there and in that place to receave the articulatione, and by the tunge, teethe, lippes, and nostrelles, in the vtterance therof to be formed.
VVherfore those vvhich have the same surpassinge the naturalle length, or in any other sorte, troubleth them, have such a feeble, imbicille voyce, that verye difficultlye vve may heare them, or at the least speake throughe there noses: if soe be it be cleane cut of, they leese ther speeche, and vvaxe mute and dumme.
Above all this it hath as yet a tvvofoulde vse, viz the one to prohibite, the duste, and anye other substa~ce, to enter into the throte, by our breathe, vvhich constinuallye vve must dravve invvar+des, and hangeth as it vveare dilated and spreade abroade like vnto a tapistrye, over the throte.
The other, and second vse of this pallatis, that it vvarmeth, and temperethe, the coulde ayre vvhich vve dravve in throughe the nose and throughe the mouthe to the lunges, because throughe the extreame coulde therof, it might not chau~ce to indammage the foresayed tunge, vvherfore they vvhich have no pal+late, finde themselves allvvayes very much altered, changed, and a great coulde allvvayes one the brest.
Of the swellinge of the Almondes, and of the vlcerations of the same.
ONe both sydes of the pallate, and in the hi~der partes therof, in the angustnes of the throte, vvhich of the Greeckes is called Isthmos, hath nature created and formed, tvvo Almondes, the one right opposite agaynst the other, vvhich are therfore called Paristmia vvhich be cause of the forme, figure, and qvantitye therof, are vvholye likened to an Almonde, are for that occasione called Almo~des: ther functione, and office is, that they retayne in them, a certayne sputaminous humiditye, vvhich sincketh descendeth out of the heade, therbye not onlye to refreshe moyste~ the mouthe, the circumiacent partes of the same but alsoe the throte, and the entrance of the stomacke, because the tunge in speakinge might not vvholye be exsiccated and dryed, and that the co~tinuall speech might not therby be hindered, and interrupted.
These foresayed Almondes, are situated, in a moyste, and vvarme place, and consideringe ther spongious, nature, are subiected to all co~cursions of humors, and all inflammations, vvherthroughe ofte~times they vvaxe harder, and greater, the~ naturally theyought to be out of the vvhich, procedethe an vlceratio~ or tumefactione, called of vs Antiades, vvherthroughe the passage of eatinge, drinckinge, breathinge is stopped, interrupted, soe that those afflicted patientes, can not vvithout great difficultlye, svvollovve, or respire breathe, even as the patie~tes, heere throughe are come into great perill, daunger, soe they must immediatlye be succoured vvith excellent good remedyes.
The assuredest and most convenient remedye is, that vve cause the~ praesentlye to be phle+botomised, after that they shall at the first have vsed a glister: and the~ in like sort cause him to be lett bloode vnder the tu~ge: that vve boxe the~ behinde in the necke, that they vse gargrises, vvhich are indifferentlye frigifyinge, and astringent.
This tumefactione oftentimes is of such a magnitude, that it exvlcerateth: vvhich easilye vve may espye, vvhen as vve perceave it to be rumpeled, and vvhytishe, and vvhen as before ther hath binne any pricki~ge therin.
VVhich havinge espyed to be soe, vve must vvith an in+strument, vvhich onlye to that intent, purpose vvas made, open the foresayed vlceratio~, or els vvith a lancett, vvhich rounde about vnto the poyncte is vvounde vvith linnen.
The apertion must be reasonablye dilated, because theris noe especiall greate vayne situated in that place, vvhich vve might hurt, except it vveare in the bottome or roote of the foresayed Almondes.
VVe are sometimes co~strayned to ope~ this vlceratione, before it be fullye mature, and ripe, to vnburthen, and release that parte therof, because the bloode vvhich issueth out of the foresayed vlceratione, diminisheth intercepteth the payne, and inflamma+tione therof, adminestreth better passage vnto the meate, and drincke, and finallye, prolo~geth the breathe.
It is right true, that vve all+vvayes in the first, ought by all meanes endevoure to mitigate the payne, and coole the caliditye of the vlceratione as much as is possible.
If soe be these sayed Almo~des, are groovve~ soe longe harde, vvith out anye hope to reduce them agayne to ther former naturall estate, beinge, vve must as then vse the manuall of Chyrurgerye thervnto, ether by cuttinge of the same, or els throughe inscisione: if soe be there be nothinge to hinder or be a let heere vnto, then the ligature vveare most convenient thervnto, and especiallye, vvhe~ as vve feare anye superfluous bleedi~ge.
VVhich verye convenie~tlye may be done, vvith an instrument, one the same forme and fashon, as before vve have rehearsed, in the tyinge of the pallate, ever observinge, that vve cutt therof noe more, then is needfull, contentinge our selves thervvith, not to cut therof anye more, then that vvhich surpasseth his naturall magnitude, greatnes: because that throughe the largenes and romthe of the throte vvhich by this dissectione might chau~ce, there be not irritated and occasioned to follovve, all such accidentes and inconvenie~ces, as before vve have discribed, of the pallate vvhich is to shorte cut of, or anye daungerouse bleedinge, if soe vve descide and cutt it of vnto the naturall, sovvnde fleshe, of the forerehearsed almondes, because of the greate vaynes vvhich there vnder lye dispearsed.
But before vve proceede unto this operatione, vve must consider, vvhether they be not of some canckerouse nature, because those vvhich are canckerouse may not by the manualle, operation of Chyrurgerye be cured: they are most easyest knovvne, vvhen as they are harde, of a purple coloure, rugged, full of payne, and have a great roote.
But if they be pale rovvnde, tender, smoothe, and belovve thinne, vve may as then vvithout dau~ger tye, and cutt them of.
And in as much as concerneth this operatione, the historye of Albucasis shall at this time suffice, to instructe the yonger Chyrurgian, to imitate the same, vvhich affirmethe to have had a vvoman in handes, vvith such an vlceratione vvherbye her throate vvas allmost occluded and stopped, that vvith great difficultlye shee respired, breathed, nether coulde shee anye more eate, or drincke, beinge in greate perill, daunger of death, if soe be that in that estate she had continued but one day longer, in vvhome this vlceratione vvas soe extreamlye svvollen, that it had yet spreade it selfe abroade into tvvo branches more, into the nostrelles.
In vvhich greate necessitye, and perplexitye, vvith al expeditione he tooke, a little hooke, vvhervvith he layed houlde one the one branche therof, vvhich vvas come into the nostrelles, vvhervvith he drevve forth therof a reasonable qva~+titye, and then as deepe as he coulde, he cutt it of, havinge done the same, in the other nostrell allsoe he hath aperted and opened her mouth depressinge the tunge dovvnevvardes, hath taken houlde on the svvellinge and tumefactione, vvith a hooke, allsoe cutt a great qvantitye therofe, vvithout anye greate store of bloode issuinge out of it: This beinge finished, the miserable poore vvoma~ hath immediatlye opened her mouthe beganne to eate, drincke vvater.
At other seasons alsoe therafter he hath cut avvay ther fro~ other peeces, but yet notvvithsta~dinge, as ofte~ as much as he descided cut therof, is increased agayne grovvne thervnto: vvhich vvhe~ he had marked, he cauterised the same, by this meanes in the end hath praevented the excrescence of this tumefactione: but beinge constrayned to take his iourny to some other pla+ce, coulde never heare, or by any man vnderstande, hovv it happened therafter vvith her: it may right vvell be thought, that the cauterisinge of this dissease vnto his roote, could not in anye sorte increase agayne, as before it had done.
It happeneth allsoe sometimes, that the Almondes soe chau~ce to svvelle, that ther is noe hope left, that vve shoulde perforate, or thrust them throughe, or to binde tye the~, because somtimes it is impossible for the patient to open his mouthe, not bei~ge able in any sorte to respire, must of necessitye dye: vvhich perceavinge to be in such an estate, vve are then constrayned in our extreame necessitye, to take our last refuge, vnto the maki~ge of an inscisione in the throte, or Trachea arteria, rather the~ vvith our eyes behoulde the patie~t to smother choake.
VVhen as therfore vve vvoulde effect this, vve must cause the patient to lye, leane on his backe, and hange his heade backvvardes, because the throte, or Trachea arteria, may evidentlye shevve it selfe, then vve must vvith our fingers, take hould on the skinn, of the third, or fourth ringle of the throat, vvher vvith the foresayed, circles, or rovvndes of the throate are covered, lifted vp, novv this beinge, soe heaved vp, vve must accordinge vnto the lo~gitude therof make the inscisio~, vvhiche beinge cut throughe, agayn let fall, vve shal as then perceave the throte bared, if soe be therone vve espyed any vayn, vve must detrude it one the one syde eschevve, or avoyde the same.
VVhich beinge effected, vve must vvith the poyncte of a croocked lancet, make our inscisione thvvarte over, betvvee~ the thirde or fourth rotu~ditye or circle, qvite through the me~brane, vvhervvith both the foresayed cartilages, or circles are the one vvith in other vnited, holden together, of vvhich betvveen the~ both is situated, vvithout touchinge ether of both these cartilages, or rovvndes, into the concavitye of the foresayed Trachea arteria, or throate, vvhich easyly vve may perceave vvhe~ as the breath issueth forth of the vvounde: in the vvhich vvound, immediatlye therone, vve must impose a silvern, or goulde~ pipe, because ther throughe duringe some shorte space the patient may breathe.
This sayed pipe must in the one end be somvvhat broade, vvith a threde theron fastened, because that through the dravvinge of breath, it doe not chaunce to be dravvne into the throate.
Novve the daunger of choakinge beinge passed, vve must as then take it therout agayne, because that the vvou~de, vvith conve~nient remedyes may be cured.
Howe we ought to drawe, thrust out, and cut, of the teeth.
THere are divers disseases inscidente vnto the teeth, vvhich throughe the manuall operation of Chyrurgerye must be cured: as by cauterisinge, of the same, by dissipation of the gu~mes fro~ the toeth, by filinge, by cuttinge of, by dravvinge by settinge, by cuttinge in therofe, by allegation bindinge together of the teeth.
Those teeth vvhich are slimye, thero~, a blacke, yellovve or vvhyte tough matter, so~times like vnslissed lime, or as it vveare some putaminous substa~ce, chaunced to be thero~ obdurated, hardened, vve must vvith a little scraper, or instrument, for that purpose make the~ cleane purifye the~, vvithout hurtinge of the gu~mes, looseninge of the same, because that such teeth vvhich are heervvith polluted, are not most co~monlye very fast: the aged poeple, the rheumaticke, they vvhich are trovbled in the lu~ges, or vvhich have anye dissease in the stomack, vvhich in times passed have binne infected vvithe the poxe, are commo~ly subiect vnto disseases of ther teeth: vvhe~ as this incresce~s is not as yet obdurate or hard vve may then vvith more facilitye remove the same, in the first vve must vvashe the gu~mes as vvell of the one as the other vvith a little alume vvater vvherby the increasinge of this matter is so~vvhat praevented, retarded, it fasteneth allsoe the gummes vnto the teethe, vvhe~ as they ha~ge looselye thero~.
Some there are vvhich esteeme this a greate secrete vvhich heertofore my selfe have vsed, to vvitt, that vve take a little Aquafortis, and a little sticke, as thicke as a quille, the one end therof beinge dipped in this vvater, vvith vvhich end of the foresayed sticke, vve must vvel rubb the tooth thervvith, dillige~tly observi~ge, that noe droppe therof chau~ce to falle one the lippes or gu~mes, immediatly the tooth being heervvith rubbed, vve must as then vvith a linne~ cloute vvipe the toothe, the linne~ clothe beinge madefied in could vvater therbye to dissipate fro~ the tooth the tartenes therof, vvhich the Aqua+fortis hath left behinde it, causinge the patient immediatly to spitte, therby the toothe vvil be exceedinge vvhite as snovve.
If ther bee any tooth corrupted, foraminous, concavous stinkinge, that cavseth sometimes great doloure, payne, yet notvvithsta~dinge vve al+vvayes endevoure to praeserve him, ether because he is co~modious for chavving, or serviceable for the speech, or els is for a decoru~ or grace vnto the mouth: to the repelli~g of vvhich payne, vve must vse a little oyle of Sage, of rosemary, of cloves, or any other oyle, of aromaticalle spices.
And if soe be thervvith the payne, the corruptione be not seased, vve must as then vvith Aquafortis cauterise the teeth, or vvith oyle of vitroll vvherein vve must dippe and moyste~ a little cotten, vvhich neatlye vve must thrust into the co~cavity of the toothe: if so be all these remedyes be not sufficie~t, ther is as the~ noe surer, or better remedy, the~ is the vse of the actuall Cauteriu~, vvhich must be proportioned verye little, accordinge vnto the concavitye of the tooth.
Other Chyrurgians ther are vvhich hovvld in greate esteem the fili~ge of the teethe, vvher they be corrupted, vvhich alsoe esteeme to be commodious, vvhen as convenientlye it may be effected, vvhen the tooth is corrupted but on the one syde therof: for by this meanes vve shall intercept, hinder the corrup+tione of the next toothe ioyninge thervnto, that he be not thervvithe polluted above other commodityes, vvhich therthrough vve shal effect.
Ther grovveth oftentimes a tooth higher, then the other of the teeth, ether vpvvardes, outvvardes, or invvardes, the poyncte vvherof is soe accute, that in speakinge it ether hurteth the tunge or the lippes.
Alsoe sometimes the teethe ar rugged vnsmoth above, vvher+fore they, one the toppes summityes therof be filed, by this meanes to make them smoothe, as the other.
And convenientlye to vse the file theron, to cause that the toothe doe not chaunce to stirre in the filinge, vve must hould fast vvith our fingers the foresayed too the, layinge certayne peeces of linnen on the gummes, vnto the rootes of the toothe.
VVe must file of all such teeth vvhich extrud them selves externally, vvill not be co~tayned in the semicircle of the other teeth, or they vvhich are broke~, a little peece therof as yet remayninge in the place, least they might chaunce to hurte the tung, or the mouthe.
Conserninge the supernaturall teeth, because it vveare to great paynes labour to file the~, it is alsoe sometimes dau~gerous to dravve the~ because co~mo~lye they are grovven, sticke verye fast in the cheekebone, vve cut the~ of vvith our cutting pellicane, or instrume~ts vvhich onlye for that purpose are co~posed made, are before figured set dovvne in ther formes: vve all soe breack the~ sometimes place of cuttinge of the~, vvith such instrume~tes as heere before are praefigured vnto vs: but the best vvay is to cut the~ of, if by any meanes possible vve ca~ effecte it.
The payne of the teethe is at sometimes soe veheme~t in tollerable, because that the tooth, is corrupted vnto his synnue, pearced, is hollovved, that the persone, is almost phre~sye, co~sideringe that there is somtimes noe remedy to be hadde, for the quallifyinge of this payne, he is as then co~strayned to cause the sayed tooth to be dravvne, vvhich as then is the certaynst vvay.
VVhe~ as therfore vve vvoulde dravve forth a tooth vve must cause the patie~t to sit in such a sorte as is most co~venie~t, the~ make choyse of the corrupted rotten tooth, because vve doe not mistake the one for the other, vvhich vve must make loose fro~ the gumes, fill vp the co~cavity or hollovvnes of the tooth vvith a little peece of leade, or vvith a little lint, or cotte~ sticke it full, because in the Pellicane he chau~ce not to breake, through the harde shut+tinge of the same: havinge houlde theron, vve must ge~tly easyly crushe the tooth dravver together, least the tooth chau~ce to breake, and the~ dravvinge the foresayed tooth a little a syde plucke him out, because that if to rigorouslye vve vvaggle the tooth vp or dovvne that parte of the cheeke bone vvherin the roote stoode soe fast, might easylye be broke~, vvherefore he vvill not vvith to greate violence be dravvne out, as alsoe by to violent dravvinge, vve might disioyne, and plucke out of ioyncte the nethermost cheekebon, cause great per+turbation in the vppermost chavve eve~ to the eyes.
The tooth beinge dravven, vve must vvith both our fingers shutt, ioyn together agayn the gummes cause the patie~t to vvashe his mouth vvith a little Oxycrate, vvherin vve must also put in a little sault.
If soe be ther vveare any effluxio~ of bloode, vve ought not to esteeme it to be a small matter because have knovvne some to bleed the~selves to death.
The assuredest remedye vvhich ever have knovvne to be vsed, is this, that divers times, vve must thrust therin som cotte~, vvhich hath binne madefyed in iuyce of le~mones, vvhich allvvayes vve must put in that place, out of the vvhich the tooth vvas dravven.
And touchinge the convenie~ce of the ligatione, or tyinge of the teeth, to ioyn the~ together, to inserte set fast those teeth, vvhich are loose, grovve~ to be moveable may be vvaggled vp dovvne, alsoe to inserte anye therin vvhich by arte ar made, all this may verye convenie~tlye fitlye one this manner be effected, vvith a fyne goulde~ vvyer of fine orientall goulde, vvhich vve may easylye bende bovve, betvveen the foresayed teeth vvithout any violence.
First dubble the vvyer, laying the same vvith his duplication, betvvee+ne tvvo sovvnde teeth then bringe both the endes, to that tooth vvhich is loose, vvhether it be one or more, vntill such time as vve shall have dravvne vnto the seconde sounde tooth one the other syde, then vve must reduce the vvyer vnto that tooth vvhence vve tooke our originalle, gentlye dravvinge the foresayed vvyer together, close to the roote of the tooth least that he goe loose: This beinge done vve must vvith a pare of sheares cutt of both the endes of the foresayed vvyer vvhich are to lo~ge, vvinde the rest therof rovvnd about the sovvnd tooth, as close to the roote that the foresayed goulde~ vvyer, may very difficultlye be espyed, nether in anye sorte may perturbe, or hinder the tunge.
The teethe not onlye beinge loose but alsoe vvholye fallen out, vve may for all that inserte them in there place, tye them, vvith a goulde~ vvyer, as is before rehearsed, or els vve may set other teeth in ther pla+ces, vvhich are by art made of Ivory, or of any other matters, as here before vve have set dovvne the figures and discriptions therof.

Of that, vvherone vve must consider, before vve make an apertion in avayne.
VVhero~ vve ought to co~sider, after vve have opened the vayne, vvhe~ shee bleedeth.

Of Anevrisma, or broken arterye, hovve vve ought to make an inscisione therin, after vvhat manner vve ought to binde them.

Of horseleeches, and of ther vse, and hovv vve ought to applye them.
Of boxes, and hovve vve must applye, and vse them.
[leaf motif]Wheron we must consider, when as we desire to open a vayne, or phlebotomize.
MYe purpose, and intent, is not in this place to discrib vnto you, vvhat sicknesses reqvire phlebotomye, in vvhat age, in vvhat time or season of the yeare, in vvhat countrye, in vvhat co~stitutio~ of the body, it must be done, of vvhat occasione, namelye especiallye, vvhether it be for anye simple evacuation, or for anye deprivatione, or derivatione, or for any revulsione.
In like sorte alsoe in vvhat vayn vve ought to make the apertione, vvhat qvantitye of bloode vve ought to detracte out of the same, in vvhat sorte, and hovv much at one time, hovve often after the other or in vvhat time of the sicknes vve must make the apertione in the vayne.
But my purpose, and meaninge is, onlye to shevve, hovv vve ought to ope~ a vayne: vvher+on vve must thinck, dilligentlye consider, before vve make the apertione therin, after vve have opened her: vvherone vve ought to not, vvhe~ the blood issveth out of the same.
This doinge, shall the Chyrurgiane, be noe lesse vvorthye of prayses, because he ca~ verye excellentlye phlebotomize, then the physitione is prayse vvorthye, by his perfect knovvledge, vvhether the patie~t have neede of phlebotomy, or not: For although, that it seemeth to be a smalle scie~ce, to phlebotomize aright, very vvel, yet notvvithstandinge is it oftentimes, a difficulte matter verye dau~gerouse, because the vaynes, ar situated somtimes close to the Arteryes, yea alsoe thervppen, as alsoe are the synnues, the te~dones.
If soe be therfore vve chaunce, vvith the lancet to hurte a Tendone, therafter most commonlye issueth a Spasmus, or a Gangrene and mortificatione, vvherthroughe the patie~t pitifullye ruefullye, and vvith great torment endeth his lyfe.
If ther be then any arterye touched, opened, shee verye difficultlye vvil be cured, vvherby the patie~t bleedeth to death: vvhe~ as vve descide a vayne qvite asunder, both the endes therof are immediatlye retracted, and dravvne invvardes, the one end this vvay, the other end that vvaye, soe that vnder the fleshe both of the endes are lost, noe bloode ca~ possibly issve therout: if shee be then vvith to great timorousnes feare pricked, the skinne onlye vvhervvith shee is covered is as the~ inscided, the vayn not opened: or els if shee be onlye pricked vvith the poyncte of the lancet, the bloode as the~ issveth therout droppingevvyse and the subtilest bloode onlye cometh out, vvher co~seqvently therafter she exvlcerateth.
Sometimes alsoe lyeth the vayne occulted soe deepe in the fleshe, that vve can not vvith the la~cet finde the~, vvithout great paynes, yea also although vve espye them, yet throughe there perpusillitye, rotu~ditye, they avoyde, eschevve the poyncte of the la~cet, hovv accute subtile soever the same be.
Soe that ther are ofte~times divers occasions, vvherfore phlebotomye is difficulte, vvhich to an other vvhich never hath done it seemeth to be very easye.
Before the Chyrurgian maketh his apertio~ in the vayne, if soe be the patie~t be restringed bovvnde in his belly, hath in a lo~ge time not bi~ne at stool, vve must the~ first of all cause him to vse a Clistere, because throughe the phlebotomye, the vaynes bei~ge evacuated, emptied, doe not attracte, dravve vnto the~ out of the guttes or entralles, any corrupted, rotte~ humors, vvherbye anye of the vvorthyest partes might be offende, hindered.
Nether is phlebotomye expedie~t, vvhen as the stomacke, is burthened, ether vvith anye cruditye, of vndigested meat, or drincke, or vvith anye other viscositye vvhatsoever, as also it is vvholye dissvvaded to doe after anye greate evacuatione, or anye other occasione, vvherby the patient might be debilitated, as is superfluous parbrakinge, a great laske, great abstinence, continualle vigilatione, and great conversation vvith vvoemen.
VVhe~ as therfore the Chyrurgiane in the absence of the Physition, hath on all these foresayed thinges dilligentlye co~sidered, he must as then deferre the phlebotomye.
And if it soe chaunced, that anye persone to praevent any dissease desired to be phlebotomized, he must then cause it to be done, vvhe~ as he is best of courage, as beinge freede from all care, of sorrovve, of ire, and besyde all this, vve must not phlebotomize anye persone, vvhich is to timorouse, fearfull of phlebotomye, because the afrightednes, the feare, causeth the bloode to vvithdravve it selfe tovvardes the internall partes of the bodye.
And the patie~t as yet beinge lustye, stro~g, vve must then cause him to sit in a stoole, but if soe he be feeble debile, is subiected vnto fayntnes sovvndi~ge, as those are, vvhich are of a hott nature, vve must in the first let him suppe in a soft dressed egge, or a morsell of breade sopped in vvyne, then cause him to lye one the bedde, halfe sittinge vpright, stuff him vnder vvith cushe~s as if he sate.
And above all vve must dilligentlye note, that the light of the ayre, or shining of the candle, doe rightlye shine one the vayne, because that through the shaddovv therofe, the knovvledg of the vayne, of the place vvhere she must be pearced, be not vanished out of your sight: then must the Chyrurgiane, vvith his right hande, take the right hand of the patient, or vvith his left hande, the left ha~de of the patie~t, out of the vvhich he meaneth to dravve the blood out depressinge the arme so~vvat dovvn vvardes, and then vvith his left hand, or vvith a vvarmed table naptkinne, rubbe the insyde of the arme vvher he intendeth to make the apertione: And then binde the arme dubble a little above the elbovve, vvith a little narrovve liste of vvollen clothe, not to stiffe nor to loose, because to looselye bovvnde, or to stifflye tyed doe both of them hinder the bleedinge: the~ must the patie~t, shutt his hand close, vvherby as vvell throughe the binding, as throughe the closinge of the ha~de, the vaynes lye fast stedfastlye in the fleshe, and not move this vvay or that vvay vvhe~ vve should pearce them, vvherthroughe also they rayse themselves, and svvell the more, throughe the bloode, that by this meanes is dravve~ thether vvardes, by the vvhich alsoe vve may the easyer see, and feele them.
[leaf motif]How we ought convenientlye, to make an apertione in the vayne.
HAvinge dillige~tlye considered all these thinges if the Chyrur+giane, determine to phlebotomise in the right arm, he must then take houlde one the foresayed arme vvith his left hande, by the bendinge of the arm, or about that place, vvherin vve purpose tO make the apertione, lay his thumbe one the vayne, a little belovve the place, vvher vve vvil pricke, because that soe he may hovvlde the vayn stedefaste, vvithout glidinge this vvay or that vvay because sometimes the vayne beinge, spanned like a little cord, might chaunce to rovvle, glide vnder the lancet.
And because the foresayed vayne is oftentimes implete vvith vvinde, ve~tosityes, shee therefore yeeldeth, slideth avvay vnder the lancet, vvherthroughe vve can not fullye pearce her, by this meanes the apertione falleth to small: all this beinge in this sorte noted, vve must vvith the first finger of the right hand feele vvhere vvith most convenience vve might make the apertione, setting an impression on the skinne above the vayne vvhere vve purpose to pricke, vvith the nayle of your finger, then immediatlye, take the lancet in the right hande, vvhich betvveene our lippes vve must have in a readines, vvith the vvhich vve finelye must make our apertione, in the vayne, causinge the poyncte, and acuitye of the same, gentlye to enter into the concavitye of the vayne, not abruptly, and rudely, vvith a hastye thrust.
And to make this apertione vvith more certayntye, vvithout tremblinge of the handes, the Chyrurgiane must take the lancet in the middle, vvith his thumbe his first finger, sufferinge his hande vvith three of his fingers to rest on the arme, so lay his thumbe and his first finger vvhich hould the la~cet one the thumbe vvhich houldeth fast the vayne, on this sort to hould fast his hande, vvith out anye tremefactione to vse the same.
Some there are vvhich annoynt the place vvherin they intende to phlebotomise, vvith a little oyle, or vvith freshe butter, thervvith somvvhat to mollifye, soften the skinne, soe vvith more ease and vvith lesse payne, to pearce ther throughe.
Others annoynte the acuitye of ther lancet vvith oyle because shee might the easyer perforate the same, cause lesse payne, the perforatione, or vvounde might better contayne it selfe apert the blood if soe be it vvear grosse, might the subtiler, vvith more ease have his passage.
If soe be then that the apertio~ be made vvith one thruste, it is the~ good, but if not, vve must immediatly give an other pricke, ether a little belovve the same, or els a little above the sam, if the vayne sufficie~tly demo~strateth her selfe.
If therfore the apertio~ be to small, the blood issue out of the same to subtilelye, soe that vve feare that vve shall not dravve sufficie~t blood enough therout, then immediatlye vve must thrust into the same hole, or apertione agayn, a little dilate the same: because that oftentimes throughe to small an apertion, the grosse bloode congealeth before the apertione, and ther conseqventlye exvlceratethe.
Havinge convenientlye brought to passe this apertione, vve must then give the patie~t, in the hande of that arme vvherin he is phlebotomized, a rou~d staffe, partlye thero~ to rest his arme, as alsoe to turne rovvnde the foresayed staffe in his hande, because by this meanes the bloode might the better shoote out: the vvhich if it doe not rightlye issue out, vve must the~ marke, if the ligature be not the cause therof, as if it vveare to harde tyede, vvhich as then vve must a little districte and make it loose, vvithout vvholye looseninge of the same.
The Chyrurgiane must alsoe have divers lancets, vvherof the one must be a little broader then the other: The broade lancets are verye necessarye vvhen as the vaynes lye highe exalted, vvhen vve desire to make an ample apertion.
The smalle narrovve lancets are verye necessary, vvhe~ as the vaynes lye profou~dlye occulted in the fleshe, and also vvhen as in the highe exalted vayne, vve desyre to make a smalle apertion: because sometimes the sicke personne, reqvireth a great, festivous phlebotomy, to the vvhich end, vve must make an ample apertione, as vve must alsoe doe, if vve coniecture the bloode to be grosse, de~ce, vvhen the patient is lustye, and stronge.
Contrarilye, if soe be vve retract, dravve back the bloode, vvhich supernaturallye hath issued out of any parte of our bodye, as in those vvhich, spitt bloode, or those vvhich bleede much out of the nose, as then vve must make our apertion smalle, because that great evacuation of blood is not necessarye for them, because through there noses they have avoyded sufficient, then onlye in such accide~tes, vvher in is onlye reqvired a regressione of bloode.
Besydes, it is necessarye expedie~t, that in the foresayed evacuatione, and sicknes, vve suffer the bloode to issve longe enoughe out of the apertione of the vayne, vvhich the patient shoulde not be able to suffer, if the foresayed apertione vveare ample, because ther vvould issue to much blood othervvise therout.
VVe are also in phlebotomye vrged to make a small inscisio~, in those, vvhich are troubled vvith Phrenesye, in those vvhich are grovvne madde, because that little vvounde might vvith all expedition be cured agayne, because that such raginge· franticke persons vvill all vvayes make loose the ligature or dressing before vvear therof avvare, vvherof they might com in daunger of bleedinge to death, but the apertione being smalle, although they loosen the arme, yet notvvithstandinge they can not violently bleede because in such a small apertione, the bloode congealeth, occludeth, stoppeth the vvounde.
VVe ought to make in smalle vaynes, a smalle apertione, in greate vaynes an ample apertione: for if so be vve make in a greate vavne a smalle apertion, the~ shoulde necessaryly follovve, that the blood, vvhich coagulateth in the small vaynes, be a hindera~ce vnto the issuinge or runninge out of the bloode.
Touchinge the forme, figure of the inscisione, it is effected in three sundrye sortes, and fashons: vvherof the first is made overthvvarte, the seco~d accordinge vnto the length of the vayne, vvherthroughe the vayne is cleft or splitted, not pricked: the thirde is the meane betvveene them both, vvhich vve may vvell call the contradictorye apertione, because co~tradictorilye shee is made.
VVe make the apertione overthvvarte, vvhen as vve are not minded to reiterate the phlebotomy: for vvhe~ vve bende the ellbovve, the~ both the endes of the vayne ioyne together agayne, This figure or forme is necessarye, vvhen as vve desire to make a large apertione.
VVe must make the apertione sydelonge or contradictorye, vvhen vve purpose to iterate the phlebotomye: and vve makinge the apertione in this manner, verye seldome or never misse the vayne: and vvhich is more, it is better for the circumstantes, and standers by, vvhen the bloode in this manner issueth therout.
That inscisione, vvhich is made accordinge to the le~gth of the vayne, is verye expedient, vvhen vve intende to renue the bloode lettinge, that not onlye the same day, but one the next day alsoe, because that vvhen vve bende the elbovve, both the labia, or lippes of the vayn, do separate devide themselves.
But in vvhat forme soever vve make the inscisione, yet notvvithsta~dinge the vayne must be pearced in the middle, vvithout vvholye cuttinge a sunder of the same.
Because her lippes, might chaunce to be inverted invvardes, and the bloode could not resulte out of the apertione, but runne dovvn a longe by the arme, or both the endes of the vayne, are dravve~ invvardes, vvithout delivera~ce of anye blood from her, or at the least, in the first very little.
[leaf motif]Wheron we ought to marke, after the thruste, apertione of the vayne, and when the bloode issueth therout.
WE may knovve, that the vayne most commo~lye is vvell opened, as easily vve may perceave by the bloode, vvhen as in the firste, it rousheth and as it vveare leapeth out in great haste, but immediatly altereth vnto droppinge, vvhich throughe the afrightinge of the patient is caused, for vvhich reason the bloode is dravven invvardes.
VVhich vvhen it chaunceth vnto vs, vve must vvith patie~ce abyde, and vnbinde it somvvhat, and incourage the patient, causinge him to move his fingers, turne, and crush the same in his hande.
The apertione in the vayne is sometimes ample enoughe, but because the bloode is grosse, it can not issue out therat, to the vvhich end vve must put a little oyle therine, vvhich to that purpose is verye profitable.
If soe be therfore the Chyrurgyane, in absence of the physitione, findeth the patie~t verye feeble, and yet notvvithstandinge, follovvinge the rule, ordinance of the physitione, is verye necessarye to be vvell phlebotomized, vve must them doe it providentlye, that althoughe, at the first vve have not dravvne soe much blood as the sicknes or dissease reqvireth, vve must then, some certayne hovvres therafter agayn renue the phlebotomye for the seconde time, and if it be needfull yet once agayne, for the thirde time, vvithout over charginge of the patient vvith to great phlebotomye at one time.
It might alsoe chau~ce, that before vve could detracte such a qvantitye of the patie~t as vvas ordayned, and reqvired, the patient might chaunce to be debilitated, and in daunger to fall in great fayntnes, sovvndinge, vvheron the Chyrurgiane must dilligentlye consider: as he may easyly perceave it, vvhen the patie~t vvaxeth pale, and oppressed at his harte, his puls diminishinge, vvhen the bloode runneth dovvne by his arme.
VVhich vvhen it chaunceth, the Chyrurgian must then immediatlye sease the bleedinge, layinge his thumbe, one the apertione of the vayne, lay the patiente on his backe, vvith his heade one a cushen, sprincklinge could vvater in his face, and give him a little vvyne in his mouth, and cause him to smell at some vineger, and then have a little patience, vntill that agayne he reviveth, comme to himselfe: for as soone as he shalbe come to his former strength agayne, vve may as the~ finishe the phlebotomye.
Some ther are vvhich in anye sorte can not indure phlebotomye, hovv lovve soever they sitt, althoughe it vveare on the bed, or althoughe vve co~tinually helde vineger before ther nose, or gave them vvyne to drincke, yet notvvithstandinge they lyinge prostrate on the bedd, vvith ther heade reasonable highe, they can as the~ verye vvell suffer and abyde the foresayed phlebotomye, althoughe vve dravve a goode qvantitye of blood from them: As of late my selfe have knovvne to happen, in an honorable, and coragious gentleman.
After that vve have detractede a reasonable qvantitye of blood out, vve must then dissolve and make loose the ligature, and crush out the bloode of the vayne, least that the bloode chaunce to congeale therine, and coagulate, and soe exulcerate: and if soe be ther appeerede anye little parcell of pingvedity, or fat, vve must the~ gentlye thrust it in agayne vvith the heade of a pinne, and not cutt it of, and then vvipe of the blood vvhich cleaveth is dryed or exciccated to the arme, lay a little co~presse, one the apertion, vvhich is madefyed in coulde vvater, and vvinde the ligature, tvvice or thrice aboute the elbovve, like a borgondian crosse, vvithout tyinge both the endes fast, be+fore you have caused the patient to bende his arme, to laye the ligature therafter.
This ligatione may not be to stiflye bovvnde, because the cicatrice by this meanes, may qvicklye be sitvatede on the apertione of the vayne.
The arme beinge thus fouldede together if so be the patiente be able to vvalke he must vveare his arme before on his breste in a scarfe if so be he lye on his bedde, he must gently lay the same besyde him, vvith out much movinge of the foresayed arme, nether must he lye therone: for ther have binne some, vvhich in ther sleepe have hadde ther armes violentlye to bleede, vvith great daunger of ther lives.
The bloode issueth sometimes vvith such violence out of some partes of our bodye, that vvith noe co~presses or ligatures vve can restraygne the same: vvhich happeninge, vve are the~ constrayned to lay above one the toppe of the apertione, the one halfe of a greate beane, and the compresse therone, and in this sort bind it together, Ther remayneth somtimes a nigreditye or blacknes, viriditye or greenes about the apertione, but therof ensueth noe evell, vnles anye other accident chaunced thervnto.
VVhen as therfore vve desire to renue the phlebotomy, vve must then lay one the inscisione saulted oyle, because that hindereth the curinge of the vvounde, and the sault keepeth the blood from coagulation, vvherthroughe the apertione of the vvounde is stopped, And if soe be the vvounde vveare soe stopped, that the bloode vvould difficultlye issue therout, vve must not then rigerously stretch out the arme, vvhich the patient hath carried on his brest dubbed, nether depresse the vayn vvith to great violence, to get the bloode therout: Because such viole~ce might cause great payn, and inflammatione, but vve must rather vvith a small privett or searching iron, remove that blood vvhich therin is exciccated dryed, or rather once agayne make an inscisione, after that vve have bovvnde the arm somvvhat higher, then the elbovve, as before vve have sayed.
VVhen as vve desire to make an apertione in the vaynes or arteryes of the temples of the head, of the foreheade or vnder the tunge, vve must then cause the patient gentlye to vvring about his neck a table naptki~ne, or a tovvell, therby to cause the bloode to asce~de, on high, the vaynes to svvel, vvhich vve intend to open.
And vvhen as vve desire to open the vaynes of the handes or feete vve must bath them in vvarme vvater, because throughe caliditye vvarmethe of the vvater, the foresayed vaynes might erect themselves, the bloode, the vayne beinge opened, might the better issue out therof. [leaf motif]Of the number of vaynes, arteryes, which com+monlye, vse to be opened in mans bodye.
THe auncie~te professors of Chy+rurgerye, have observed, certayne vaynes, vvhich in mans bodye must be opened, accordinge as everye divers dissease shall reqvir: vvherof the Chyrurgiane must not onlye knovve ther situatione, ther divisione or separatione, but alsoe the names of the sam, because that he doe not mistake the one from the other.
vvherof ther are in the heade een: the first vvherof is called the vayne of the foreheade, vvhich is situated in the middest of the foreheade, and is opened vvhen as vve have anye inveterated payn in the occipitialle partes of the heade to trouble, molest vs.
The seconde is called Vena Pupis, vvhich is situated right in the middest of the occipitialle, or hinder partes of the heade: this vayne is opened, agaynst the soporiferousnes, payne of the heade, vvhich is situated in the foreheade.
The thirde is called the temporalle, or vayne of the te~ples, vvherof in each syde ther is on, vvhich in divers bra~ches asce~deth in the temples of the heade: vve open those vaynes agaynst the superfluous lachrimation of the eyes, agaynst veheme~t payne in the eares, agaynst the Hemicrania, vvhich onlye commeth in on syde of the heade.
The fourth is called the eare vayne, one eache syde one, have ther place, situatione behinde the eares: this vayne is opened agaynst surditye, payne, vlceration of the eares.
The fifth is the eye vayne, the vvhich in the greate corner of the eye, close by the nose, vve may perfectlye see: shee is opened, agaynst all disseases of the eyes, eyeliddes.
The sixt is, the nosevayne vvhich hath her place in the middest of the end of the nose, betvveene the tvvo grisles or cartilages: shee is opened, agaynst the heavines of the head, agaynst all reumes, of the eyes, eyeliddes.
The seaventh, is the lippe vayne, vvherof one each syde are, tvvo, in the internall partes of the opermost, and nethermost lippe: vve ope~ them agaynst all tumors, excrescenses of fleshe, agaynst all vlceratio~s of the mouth, agaynst the vehement rednes of the face.
The eight is called Ranularis vena, vvhich is situated vnder the tunge, one each syde on, vve make therin an apertion, agaynst the Sqvinantie, agaynst the incensione of the Almondes, of the pallate, more other disseases of the throte.
The ninth is very publique, lyinge in the necke, and is called the Iugularis, vayne, of the Arabians Gvides, on each syde of the necke one.
Shee may very convenie~tlye be opened, agaynst tht Sqvinantye, agaynst all rheumes of the throte, vvhich bringe vs into greate angustnes, and trouble.
In the armes are sixe, in every arme three vvhich in the fouldinge of the armes are phlebotomized.
The first is the head vayn, vvhich is situated highest most outvvardlye, in the arme, vvhich vve ope~ agaynst the payn of the heade, eyes, eares, payne svvellinge of the throte.
The second is the nethermost in the in+syde of the arme, is called Basilica, being the foundatione of both the other vaynes, and is also called Hepatica, or liver vayne: VVe open this vayn, agaynst the stoppinge of the Liver, agaynst all infla~mations of the vvhole bodye, all disseases, vvhich are situated vnder the heade.
The thirde, is the Mediane, as vvell concerninge her situatione, as originall, because shee taketh her beginninge out of the Heade Liver vaynes, as also considering her conditions, because vve open her as vvell for all disseases, vvhich are situated in the vpper, as vndermost partes of our vvhole body, and ther trouble, and molest vs.
In the handes, vve have sixe, in each hande three.
The first descendeth a longest the Metacarpion of the hande, and passethe betvvixt the thumbe, the first finger, vve call her allsoe the heade vayne, or the eye vayne.
VVherfore shee is onelye opened agaynste payne in the heade, eyes.
The seconde is called Salvatella, or Liver vayn, betvvixt the little, thirde finger, shee is phlebotomized, agaynst the yellovve gaundise, in all disseases of the liver, on the right hande, and one the left agaynst all disseases of the milte, vvherfore of som in the left hande shee is called the miltvayne.
The thirde, is alsoe called the Mediane, Blacke, and Common vayne, descendeth by the finger called Medicus, or thirde finger, vvhich vayne vve may open, vvhen vve can finde nether of the other tvvo.
In the belly are tvvo in each syde of the bellye one, vvhich vve call Venam Illiacam, or Titillarem, demonstratethe her selfe betvveen the hippes, the flanckes.
She vvhich is opened in the right syde, agaynst the Dropsye, and other disseases of the Liver: shee vvhich lyeth in the left syde, agaynst the disseases of the Milt.
In the fundament, or privityes of a ma~, are one each syde tvvo, the one vvherof vve calle the Hemorrhoidalle vayne, is onlye opened in melanckolye disseases.
In the legges are eight, in each legge four: vvherof the first is called Vena poplitis, situated in the hockes, or fovldinge of the knees, is opened agaynst all disseases of the nethermost part of the bellye.
The second Saphena, or mother vayne, vvhich vve ope~ one the insyde of the legge vnder the anckle, in all disseases of the kidnies, of the vvombe, to provoacke in the vvoemen ther monthlye sicknes, or mestruousnes, in all runninge of the raygnes, and in Venus botches, or as vve call them in lattin Bubones.
The third is the Schiaticke vayn, vvhich externallye demonstrateth her selfe, above the a~ckle, vvhich is only opened agynst the dissease called Sciatica, agaynst all payne, and doloure of the hippes, and flanckes.
The fourth is the mediane, or kidnyevayne, situated belovve the foote, and is phlebotomized agaynst all disseases of the kidnyes.
Amongst all the other vvhich are most co~monlye opened, are those three vvhich in the foulding of the arme are phlebotomized: to vvit the head vayn Basilica the media~.
VVe must dillige~tlye co~sider that vvhen vve make an inscisio~ theri~ that vnder the Basilica or Liver vayne lyeth an artery or great harte vayne: vnder the Median a synnue or tendone of the muscle Biceps or both of these together, but vnder the Cephalica is nether synnue artery or tendone sitvated, vvherfore amo~gst all other vaynes, ther is none vvhich vvith lesse perril dau~ger may be opened.
If so be that through mischau~ce in opening of the vayne Basilica vve chau~ced to hurte the artery vvhich ther vnder is sitvated as have knoovvne to have chau~ced, vve must praese~tlye for the stoppinge and restrayninge of the bloode, and to the curing of the arterye, vvithout leavinge anye Aneurisma, cleave a bean in tvvo peeces, laye the one halfe of the beane, one the apertione of the vayne, vvith a co~presse therone, gentlye tyed, vvithout visitinge of the same in thre or foure dayes, or once offer to touch it.
If so be in the apertion of the mediane, vve chaunced to pricke the subter situated synnue, or tendone, vve must then immediatly phlebotomize the patient in the other arme: and vve must droppe in the vvounde of the pricked synnue, a little hott oyle of Terpentin, and a little vvoolle, beinge dipped therin vppon the same, therby to keepe the apertione aperte, then lay a playster of Diacalcitheos, rovvnde aboute the vvounded parte of the vvhole arme, vvhich hath bi~ne liquefacted, vvith oyle of roses, and vineger.
Of the Arteriotomia, or apertion of the Arterys, or hartvaynes.
COncerning the Arteriotomia, or apertione of the Arteryes, the praedicessors auncient professors vveare vvont to effect it especialle behinde the eares, in the temples of the heade, agaynst all continuall, rebellious fluxions, Rheumes of the eyes, in like sort alsoe, agaynst all diseases of the heade, vvhich have take~ ther originall, fro~ hotte, dampishe, or subtile rheumes: as yet novv a dayes vve doe, but not vvho lye as they vveare vvonte to doe, in openinge of the same: for soe farre forth as if the Arterye be small they then cut her cleane a sunder, they also cut a peece therof avvay, both the endes are dravven invvardes, vvher by shee as then bleedeth noe more.
And if the Arterye, be greate, violentlye beateth, it is the surest vvay, that vve tye her vnder above and then betvveen both those ligations cut her of, but the thredes vvhervvith vve binde her, must be stro~g closly tyed because that through the continvall beatinge of the arterye, the thredes loose~, the arterye openeth, if so be it be not stiflye bovvnde: because that she should not chaunce to cor+rupt, before the inscision be replete grovve~ full of flesh: vvher through the mouth of the foresayed artery is stopped.
But novv a dayes vve only make a simple inscision in the artery in such a manner as vve make an apertion in the vaynes, vvithout cutting of the same clean of having dravven as much blood therout as vve desire, vve the~ lay a litle playster of masticke on the apertion, a litle compresse tyed theron rovvnd abovt the vvhole head as close as is possible.
knovve right vvell that ther are some vvhich houlde this apertione of the arteryes verye suspecte, because it ca~ hardlye be stopped agayne, and in doinge this, ther remayneth a cicatrice, in those partes vvhich are situated rovvnde about the foresayed arterye, before the same is fullye cured, and ther throughe often times an Aneurisma caused, vvhich is verye troublesome, and daungerous for the patient.
But may vvith verity affirme it to be true, that oftentimes have seene opened the arteryes of the temples of the heade, vvithout any of the foresayed accidentes beinge happened thervnto, the vvhich cou~cel the yonge Chyrurgiane to doe it onlye in this place, because such an inscisione, is more fitter, lesse daungerouse, the~ the vvhole cuttings of, and ligature of the same.
[leaf motif] Of the swellinge Aneurisma, and of the meanes howe to binde, and cut of the same.
THis tumefactione Aneurisma, is caused most commonlye, throughe the dilatation of an arterye, vvhich only vve must vnderstande of the smalle Aneurismata, beinge impossible, that the arterye, shoulde so dilate, as it vveare vnshutt in the greate Aneurismata vvhich of+tentimes vve see: vvherfor vve vvill rather say, and houlde vvith the opinione, of the auncie~t professors, that Aneurisma is then caused, vvhe~ as the bloode, and the vitall spirites, are repulsed out of the arteryes, throughe the apertion, or orificia of the same, vvhich vve call Anastomosin, or els vvhen as the tunicle of the arterye is burst, it be ether throughe a vvounde, or by anye other occasione: as vve may se, vvhen as the Chyrurgiane, purposinge to opene the vayne in the elbovve by chau~ce prickethe the arterye vvhich is theru~der sitvated the ski~ne vvhich is thero~ lyinge, cicatrizeth it selfe and the perforatio~ of the artery, through her co~tinvalle reverberatio~e, tarrieth vncured, ope~ is not stopt, or vvith anye carnall substance replete, as beinge vnprofitable for anye vse in noe sorte can be bound so close as the arterye of the temples of the heade, but throughe the blood vitalle spirites, vvhich by degrees issue therout, are congregatede vnder the skinne, soe conseqventlye cause the svvelli~g supposinge they verye vvell did knovve, therin to be matter, or any other slimye substance, or viscositye, for vvhich reason, they have made an apertione therin, vvhervppon a little time therafter death hath follovved, because of the bloode, and of the vitall spirites, vvhich in great hast have rushed therout, vvithout anye remedy hovve to restraygne them.
Novv perfectlye to knovve such a svvellinge, and to discerne it from other tumefactio~s, vve must observe, that in this tumefactione ther is, a continuall reverberatio~, the foresayed tumor, beinge of one coloure vvith the skinne, hovve great or smalle, the inflatione be, it is alsoe te~der, and soft in the touchinge of the same, glidinge avvay vnder the finger vvhen as vve de+presse it, yea and almost throughe the foresayed depressione vvholye vanisheth out of our sight, considering the bloode of the vitall spirites, vvhich through the foresayed depressio~, are crushed in the arterye, vvherfore they alsoe, as passinge throughe a little apertio~ vvhich violence, do make a noyse, or sovvnde, vvhich havinge taken avvay, and removed the finger immediatlye shoote agayne in ther foresayed concavitye, as alsoe agayne in ther forth comminge, of the foresayed angust apertione, vve may heare a certayne sovvnde: vvhich co~mon+lye chaunceth vvhen as this Aneurisma, is caused throughe an Anastomosis, and not of anye vvounde, because, the Orificium beinge apert, the vitall spirites, as being most subtile, are before the bloode driven out, soe that the vvhole tumefaction, is almost replete vvith vitall spirites.
But if soe be the Arterye be burste, there as then issueth much bloode therout, vvhich bringeth in the tumefaction more blood, the~ vitall spirites, vvherfore alsoe it is more obdurate, and harder, and the sayed bloode coagulateth, and therin rotteth, and corrupteth.
As much as concerneth the curatione of this tumefactione, it consisteth onlye, in the bindinge of the foresayed arterye, and especiallye the same bei~ge somvvhat thicke, for they vvhich are greate, and especiallye the arteryes of the necke, the arme pittes, or of the flanckes, may or can in noe sorte be tyed, because it is impossible to finde them, make them bare, and if vve allsoe make an inscisione therin ther then follovveth such a quantitye of bloode, and of the vitall spirites, that most commo~lye the patient, dieth vnder the handes of the Chyrurgiane.
That arterie, vvhich is situated in the bendinge of the arme may easilye be cured, as out af this subsequent historye vve may note.
My lorde of Maintenon, desired me to visite the sonne, of my lorde, of Belleville, vvhich throughe phlebotomy in the bendinge of his arme, had gotten a little Aneurisma, vvhich through continuance of time, is grovven as greate as a fiste, vvherin, in the ende the bloode vvhich therin vvas included, coagulated: so that in the foresayed tumefaction Aneurisma, ther came a corrupting and rottennes, vvhich he one the out syde of the foresayed skinne, of the svvellinge he espyede, vvhich from the vitall and livinge coloure vvas chaunged into a blacke, and purple coloure, vvherebye alsoe ther vvas an apertione caused in the skinne: To the remedyinge, and curinge of the vvhich, especiallye the superfluous effluxione of bloede, vvhich might therof ensue, the losse alsoe of the vitall spirites, if soe be the apertio~ as yet vveare dilated: as then councelled, the Physitions, and Chyrurgians, to praevent farther evells, that vve ought to tye, binde the Arterye, (vvhich vvas situated, and his place in the bending of the arme) somvvhat higher then the Aneurisma, to the vvhich opinion, propositione, in the end they all consented, agreed: The vvhich alsoe vvith happye successione of all causes vvas brought to passe, in the praesence of the vvorpshipfull master Drovet, Doctour of Physicke, at Beauvais, and of the Chyrurgiane dvvellinge at Avet, vvhich vveare come thether to cure him.
First of all, co~sidered, on the arterye, in the vppermost, and inner parte of the fore arme, as shee from above desce~deth vnder the armpittes, vnto the be~dinge of the arme, three fingers bredth therabove, on the vvhich place vvhen had seene, and fixede myne eyes therone, made an inscisione, in the skinne according to the length therofe, vvhich lay opened right above the Arterye vvhere by tacture vve might feele her, vvhich vvhen had found, and discovered her, thrust a crooked needle thervnder, vvherin vvas a stro~g threde, vvhere vvith tyed the foresaeyde Arterye, vvith a dubble knott: this beinge done, took avvay, and purifyed, all the congealed, or coagulated bloode, all other impuritye out of the vvounde or svvellinge, and have vvashed the same vvith Aqvavitae, in the vvhich mixed a little Aegyptiacum, by this means to cleanse it the better from all putrefactions: and the patient, is vvithin a moneth therafter ensuinge, vvholye cured, and grovvne sovvnde, vvith out retayninge any lamnes in his arm: vvherin my selfe have vvondered.
If soe be that in anye other externall parte, there chaunced to come any Aneurisma into the Chyrurgians handes, he must then knovv, that allvvayes for certayntye, he shall finde the arterye in her vppermost parte, or discover, and bare her, soe bynde, and tye her vvith out anye more ceremonies.
[leaf motif]Of the Cirsotomia, that is, of the manner, howe we ought to cutt of the varices.
VArices, or burstene vaynes, are troublesome, because of ther greatnes, their extracting, thicknes, and their gibbositye above ther nature, property.
VVherfor, ether because they cause payne, and hinder the actione of that parte, or els because they soacke in some certayne vlceratione, vvith some humiditye, (vvherby she can not be cured) vve are vrged to open them, and cut themof, or els vvith some actuall cauterye, to cauterize them, soe consume, and bringe them to nought.
To vvhich purpose, the auncient professors, have ordayned, that vve should cut out, and cleane take avvay, those vvhich lye croockedlye and dubbelye foulded, in divers rovvnde revolutions, or els lye intangled the one vvith the other.
But before vve proceede to such an operatione, it is necessarye, that first of all, vve bath that part vvith hott vvater, to cause the grosse bloode somvvhat to separate, and vvexe or grovve subtile, and the vaynes to svvel and exalt themselves.
But the most gentlelest remedye, is that vvhich daylye vve vse vvhich is the simple apertione, and inscisione of the foresayed Varices, at one, tvvo, or thre places, as if vve intended to phlebotomize, makinge the apertion somvvhat greater and larger therin because of the grosse, melancholicke bloode, vvhich vve desire to let therout: Throughe vvhich foresayed apertione, vve extracte as much bloode, as vve suppose to be goode, and sufficient, or els as much as the patient ca~ abide, one vvhich foresayed apertione, vve must lay compresses, vvhich therone vve must binde, as vve are commonlye vsed to doe one the vaynes, vvhe~ as vve have phlebotomised, prohibitinge the patient, not to stirre, or goe, vvhich sayed Varices, if so be they chaunced to svvell agayn vve must as before a little distance ther after make therin an other apertione.
But if soe be vve intende vvholy to discide, and cutt them out, vve must first of all, denotate the same vvith incke, one the skinne, vvhich is placed one the Varice or burste~ vayne, the skinne bei~ge annotated, vve must vvith tvvo fingers of both the handes, lift vp the same, the one this vvay and the other that vvay, vvhen vve have fast houlde therone, then vve must make an inscision, in the middest of the elevated skinn, on the selfe same place, vvhich before vve had denotated vvith incke, of such a magnitude, and greatnes, as is reqvired necessarye: the inscisio~ beinge effected, vve must suffer the skinne agayne to descende, through vvhich inscisione, the Varice, or bursten vayne vvhich is theru~der situated, shalbe discovered, an denudatede of the skinne: VVhervnder, as then vve must thrust, a crooked needle: because therafter vve may vvith both the endes of the foresayed threde, dravve the one vpvvardes, and the other dovvnvvardes.
This beinge effected, vve must make an apertione in the varice, accordinge the length, of the same betvvixt both the thredes, vvhich must be separate aparte the one from the other a thu~bcs bredthe, throughe vvhich apertione, vve may dravve as much bloode, as vve please: and the~ dravve binde together verye fast the foresayed thredes, the~ alsoe cut, the foresayed varice, or bursten vayne, cleane avvay, vvhich is situated betvveen both the thredes, if soe be it seeme expedient vnto you, sufferinge the thredes, by continuance of time, putrifye and rott out of themselves, vvithout vvith viole~ce to dravve them out, because that nature, may have some respite, time, to close, and replenishe the cutt, and ligated vaynes.
That bursten vayne, vvhich runneth right, althoughe she lye overthvvarte, if she be simple, smalle, vve vveare better tye her then to cauterize her: But first of all vve must purge the patient, phlebotomize him ether in the arme, or in the varice, or els in both places at once.
Our praediscesors auncient Chyrurgians, make me~tione of the actuall Cauterye, but before they applyed the same, they first in scyded the skinne, vvhervvith the varice is cooperted, covered, in such ma~ner, form, as vve doe vvhe~ vve binde the same: the varice therefore beinge bared, they then imposed theron, a smalle stamped Cauterye, vvhich vvas vvell glovvinge, redd hott, vvhich reasonable stifflye they impressed theron, but yet not soe violently that the advstione penetrated any deeper, the~ throughe the vayne, vvith out touchinge the lippes, or edges, in cauterizinge, of the foresayed inscisione, vvherfore they vvith vvett, madefyed cloutes or vvith some certayn playsters, recincted, defended them.
This operatione beinge after this sorte finished they applyed therone, some certayn remedyes, to the qvallifyinge of the payne doloure, and profitable for the combustione.
And because it is incident vnto all me~, to feare the hott iron, and alsoe the inscisione of the skinne, vvhich first of all must be done.
Our vse therfore novv a dayes is, that vve (vvithout makinge any inscisione in the skinne) applye on the selfe same place of the varice, a great, stronge pote~tiall Cauterye, because it should not only combure qvite throughe the skinn, but alsoe throughe the vvhole varice, or bursten vayne: but vve may not in any sorte touche the Escara, but gentlelye of her selfe suffer het to separate, vsinge at this season those remedyes, vvhich for that vse expresslye amongest the cauteryes, vve have discribed.

THe Horseleeches are little, and perpucill creatures, like vvormes, of the longitude of a finger, or theraboute, nether are they of anye great crassitude, or thicknes, vnles, it be vvhen they vvith suckinge of bloode are grouvven thicke.
The end of ther head hath a rovvnde hole, much like vnto a litle lamprell, vvherin are to be behelde, and seene thre stinges, or acuityes, proceedinge out of three corners, vvhich soe violentlye, stronglye pricke, that thervvith they can pearce the hides skinnes of all creatures vvhatsoever, vvherone they depe~de faste hanginge, vntill such time as they have sucked themselves rovvnde, and fall of vvith ther one accorde.
They live, are inge~dred in the vvater, especiallye in all stagnes, standinge vvaters, because they delight, and are solaced, in filthye, and muddye places.
esteeme, suppose, that ther is noe Chyrurgiane, but verye vvell knovveth them because of all men they are knovven, but everye one doth not knovve vvhich are the venoumous, or not venoumous, vvhich notvvithstanding, is verye necessarve to be knovvn, considering the accidentes, mischaunces, vvhich might therof insue, and follovve, as in example, great tumors, Inflammations, venoumous vlcerations, through ther venoumous momorsiones bitinges, yea also death it selfe, as the historie of him, vvhich of a venoumous one, vvas bitten in his knee, dyed therof, is vvitnessinge vnto vs.
The vonoumous, are as vvel knovvne, discerned by ther greatnes, as ther colour, and alsoe by the place vvher they are caught.
For those vvhich are thicke, and have a thicker head then the rest of ther vvhole bodye, shininge, like vnto glistninge vvormes, and are greenish, and vvhich have on ther backe, blevve, or blacke strokes, or lines, and vveare caught in standinge pooles, vvher all manner of foetide, stinckinge Carrions, vvith more other filthines is throvvne in, they are all venoumous, vvherfore in anye sorte vve must not vse them.
But those, vvhich are small, rovvnd, have a little heade, are of coloure much like vnto a liver a rovvnde belly, the backe stripped, stroked vvith gouldeyellovv strokes, vvhich live in cleane runninge vvaters, they are not venoumous, vve may safelye, and vvith all securitye vse them.
And yet notvvithsta~ding, those vvhich ar soe as is before sayed, may vve as soone, as vve have caught them, applye them to the bodye, but must first of all, keepe them tvvo, or three vveekes in a glasse of fayre vvater, because therin they may avoyd the viscositye, impurenes, refreshi~ge the foresayed vvater everye three dayes once, vvashinge the sayed horseleeches, vvith your handes from all ther viscositye slimishnes.

Before therfore vve apply them, because they might be hungrye, nether retayne anye thinge in ther bodyes, because they shoulde the sooner take houlde, vve must take the~ out of the vvater, suffer the~ thre or foure dayes before vve vse them to lye in a nue little vvodden boxe.
VVhich beinge in this sorte praepared, to apply one the body, vve must first vvashe that place vvher vve purpose to applye the~ verye cleane, if so be the place, by reason of of anye salve or plaster, vvear fattye, vve must alsoe vvashe that place vvype it very cleane, because they are enimyes vnto all pingveditye fatnes: this being effected, vve must the~ take them the one after the other, in ther middles vvith a vvhyte cleane clothe, (for if soe be vve touch them vvith bare fingers, they as the~ vvil not bite) praese~t, or place ther heades to that place vvher vve desire to have them sucke.
If so be the Horseleech vvill no~t at the first byte, take houlde, vve must then annoynt the sayed place vvith pigeons bloode, or hennes blood, or cause the place ether vvith the poyncte of a lancet, or vvith a pinn, to bleed, vvherthrough immediatlye she vvill beginne to sucke.
And soe far forth as she sucketh not stronge enoughe, or if soe be vve desire to have her to sucke violentlye, before she leave, is not vvholye full, satisfied, vve must vyith a payre of scissors clippe her a sunder, about the thirde part of her bodye: vvher by, she beginneth to sucke farre stronger vvith more violence, and the bloode as fast as she sucketh de parteth fro~ her through the hindermost partes vvhich are cut avvaye.
As soone as the one Horseleeche is falle~ of, if vve please, vve may applye an other theron: for they being replete satisfied, praesently of themselves, fall of: if soe be vve desyre to have them fall of, before they be satisfied, vve as then stravve a little saulte, or ashes of vvoode on ther heades immediatlye they fall of.
Ther as yet droppeth blood out of the bitt vvhen as they are fallen of, vvhich is a signe token, that they have dravven suckede the blood from farre, vvhich blood, vve must not one the suddayne restraygne, stoppe, be+cause that parte may the better purge, purifye it selfe, from all venoumous humors, if soe be there be any at hande: vvherfore some ther be vvhich to that end, apply some small boxes, on the bitinge of the Horseleech, or els they vvashe that parte vvith hott vvater, bei~ge saulted, cause it to bleed somvvhat longer, if soe be that parte require the same, the patie~t be able to suffer the same: If soe be the blood runne therout somvvhat to longe, vvil difficultlye be restraygned, throughe anye compresses, vve must then apply theron a little adusted, or burned linne~, or a splitted or cloven beane, retayninge the same vvith his finger soe longe therone, vntill such time as she cleaveth fast theron, vvheron therafter vve must lay a small compresse, binde the same therone, if soe by anye meanes possible it may be done.
Boxe, is an instrume~te, of Chy+rurgery, the magnitude vvher of, must aeqvallye be proportioned, accordinge to the greatnes of that parte, vvheron vve purpose, and intende to apply them, alsoe divers formes, figures: for some ther are vvhich are shorte, thicke, others vvhich have a longe necke, belovve vvyde, vvhich co~monly dravve better the~ any other.
Others are of divers substance, for ther are some of Copper, others of Horne, of Tinne, and of glasse, vvhich vve most commonlye vse, because throughe the glasse vve might see, vvhether they dravve much bloode or not.
Ther are alsoe some vvhich are made of vvoode, and some baked of earthe: yea for vvant of Boxes, vve may vse little vvoodde~ dishes, or little earthen pottes.
Touchinge ther forme, they must have a vvyde mouth, and a reasonable broade bellye, thicke rovvnde edges, because in the applyinge therof they should not chaunce to hurte.
And if soe be they are very greate, they must the~ have a little hoale on the one syde, vvhich vvith vvaxe must be occluded, befor vve apply the~ that vve may give the~ ayr, vvhe~ vve vvill ta+ke of the same, some ther are, vvhich lay a little sticke, crosse over in the mouth therof, on the vvhich they impose a little peece, or inche of a candle, vvhich in the application therof they incende, and light.
That vve first of all, perfricate, and rubbe the place Vvherone vve intend to applye the~ situatinge that parte of applicatione, in the right forme therof, because the muscles, may lye in ther right situatione, and places, and not be recurved this vvay, or that vvaye, because the boxes beinge theron fastened, might not vvithe the reflection of the parte, or ioyncte, fall therof, vvhen as the foresayed recurved muscles, shoulde reverte agayne to there accustomed locationes, and places.
This beinge done, vve must impose therone a counter or any other peece of coine, vvith a little, flocke of flexe, or tovve incended in the middest of that place, vvherone vve desire to applye the Boxes, least that the fyer chaunce to touche the skinne, vvheron immediatlye, vve must vvhelve the Boxes, turninge the same a little rovvnde, because he shoulde the better fasten theron: the vvhich as then vve must cover, vvith a dubble vvarmed cloute.
Some there are vvhich in the bottome of the Boxes applye and laye a plaster, and therone a little tovve, in place of an inche of candle, vvhich in the applicatio~, theyt set one fire, vvith a candle.
As touchinghe the hornes, they are vvyde above, and narrovve belovve, havinge a little perforatione in ther middest, and internally, a little leatherne tu~ge, vvhich is very thinne, vvhich stoppeth the foresayed hoales.
To vvitt vvith a little pipe, or vvith a quille, vvhich vve impose in the foresayed perforation, vvhervvith the foresayde tunge is thruste backevvardes, vvhich stoppeth the horne, vvhen it hath dravven and sucked sufficient, dravvinge the pipe therout, the foresayed tunge, internally shutteth, cleaveth it selfe soe close to the hole, as vve may see in a kind of ballon, vvhen he is blovven vp.
Those vvhich are ignorant of this secrete, stoppe, occlude the hole vvith a little vvaxe, vvhich in deede is not so necessarye, and needfulle.
Those little Boxes vvhich are layed in vvarme vvater, are aplyed, after that vve have putt the flame of the candle, therin and must then vvith all expeditione be theron im+posed.
The vse of these small Boxes, is thre fould: Namely thervvith to vvithdravve, and repell, the blood, and humors, vvhich are concursed to anye place: to dravve forth any particulare thinge vvhich nature ca~ not expell from her: to dravve, out or cause to consume, any occluded ventosityes, in any partes of our body: vvherfore vve applye them one divers, sundrye places: they are very goode and commodious to be placed behi~d in the necke, agaynst all rheumes vvich are incident vnto the eyes: behinde in the middest of the necke are they necessarye to be applyed, for those vvhich are shorte of respiratione, and troubled vvith the cough: one both the shoulder blades, agaynst payne, and doloure in the heade agaynst Hemicraniam, agaynst ophthalmye, and payne in the teeth: vve apply the~ alsoe in place of phlebotomye one the right hippe, agaynst bleedi~ge at the nose: in like sorte alsoe close to vvoemens brestes, vvhen as there menstruositye, too superfluouslye flovveth from them, and vvhen there lye included anye ventosityes in the Liver: on the left syde, vvhen as ther is any vvynde retayned in the Milte: on the Navelle aganst the vvynde colicke: on the Vreteres, to cause the gravell to desce~de, vvhich is contayned, in the kidnyes: on the rumpe, agaynst the vlcerations, and the Hemorrhodes of the fundament: on the hippes, agaynst all vesicall disseases, and of the vvombe, and provocation the monethlye sicknes, or menstruositye.
To conclude, vve may applye them, on all partes of mans bodye, yea allsoe one the selfe same place vvhere the payn is, vvhich vve endevoure to cure, to retract and dravve therout all humors, vvhich are theri~ secluded, as vvhe~ vve desire to dravve any humors outvvardes, vvhich lye profoundlye deepelye occulted, and hidde~, or els alsoe, any ventositye, vvhich in the foresayed parte lyeth inclosed, as on anye bitt, or pricke, of any venoumous creature, least that the venoume might chaunce to penetrate and pearce, into some of the vvorthyest partes: one the Venus botches, or Bubones, one the venoumouse, Pestilentialle Parotides.
But desiringe to applye them agaynst anye superfluous efluxione of bloode, vve must then situate them on the contrarye syde consideringe the allyance, communitye of the vaynes vvhich is betvveene them, throughe the vvhich the bloode is retracted, dravven backe.
It chaunceth also somtimes, that vve nether applye the Boxes, on the disseased, or dolorouse place, nether one the contrarye syde therof, but one that parte vvhich nexte, and proximately thervnto is situated: as vvhe~ vve desire to suscitate and provoacke, the retayned and kept backe mestruosityes, vve as then place the Boxes, one the bone Pubis in the flanckes, and allsoe one the flatnes of the hippes.
The Boxes, or hornes, are so~times applyed vvith scarificationes, and somtimes vvithout: If soe be vve applye them vvithout scarificationes, they then onlye dravve certayn dampes vnto them: but if ther be anye badde humors, in those partes, vve as then scarifye it: And the dissease proceedinge out of vvindes, and ventosityes, vve then applye them vvithout scarifications, but vvhen vve are minded to scarifye anye parte, vve first sett the Boxes therone, and havinge agayne removed, and taken the same of, vve the~ pricke, or scarify therin, ether vvith a lancet, or vvith the poyncte of a rasor, vvhether it be deepe, or not deep, accordinge as vve suppose, and iudge the bloode, to be grosse, or subtile, but allvvayes vve must note not to scarifye deeper then the skinne: touchinge the number of the foresayed scarificatio~s, if soe be vve are not inte~ded to dravve much blood ther out, vve may not as then make manye scarificatio~s: but if vve intend to dravve much blood therout vve must then make many scarifications: vvhero~ vve must agayn applye the boxes, soe that vvhe~ vve desire to dravve much blood therout, vve must applye the foresayed boxes tvvo, or three times theron, everye time scarifye the place, especially vvhen ther is contayned in that part anye venoumouse ventositye, or grosse, and corrupt bloode.
In delicate, and dayntye persons, vvhich are tender of fleshe, and have an aperte or open skinne, in such persons vve must scarifye but once, notvvithstandinge must apply the boxes tvvo, or three times after other theron: vvhich beinge finished, and havinge vviped, and dryed the parte, vve must then apply one the scarlficatione, the Cerotum Galeni, or els the Vnguentum Rosarum.
THE SEAVENTH TREATISE OF THE OPEratione of Chyrurgerye, Contayninge sixe Chapters.
Of the Caries, or of the corruptione rottinge of bones.
Hovv vve ought to dravve forth Childrene out of their mothers bodye, vvhich of themselves can not be borne.
VVherfore the externalle partes or ioynctes of the bodye, must be extirpatede, as Armes and Legges vvheraboutes the same must in the fore sayed ioynct be done.
Hovv vve ought to effect, the extirpation, or dissection of any ioynct, restraynge the bloode after vve shalle have layed dovvne the patient.
Hovv vve ought to extirpate the spoylede, superflvous fingers, hovv vve shall separat those fingers vvhich are combinede, grovven together.
THe bones, not being spoylede corrupt, are of natur vvhyt smooth, solide.
They are accordinge to the sayinges of aunciente Chyrurgianes and our dayly experience, subiected vnto all evell dispositions, vvhich the flesh is subiected vnto, yea allso vnto apostematio~s.
Celsus avouchethe, that all bones vvhich have any impedime~t, are ether hurte, corrodede, corrupted, burst, broken, crushed, plettered, or out of ioyncte.
VVe may praeiudice the bones to be altered, or polluted, throughe our sight feelinge, matter, and impuritye, vvhich therout issueth: vvhe~ vve perceave it to be yellovv or purple, and at the last blacke, as verye learned lye, discretlye the sayed Author, vvriteth, first the corrupted bone vvaxeth fattye then blacke, or putilaginous, that is corroded: vvhen as in touchinge vvith the privet or searchinge iro~, vve feele the bone to be rugged, and not playn, and the privet, entereth therin, as if it vveare a peece of corrupted, vvorme eaten vvoode, especially vve knovvinge the same not to have binn bared of his fleshe, nether hath binn of the ayre illuminated: because that sometimes the altered bone, for that it hath a longe vvhile lyen bare, is grovve~ to be soe harde, thicke, thar vvithout greate paynes, vve can not fasten thero~ vvith the grating iron, through the matter, vvhich is thinne, subtile, cleere, faetide, stinckinge, blackishe: vvhen as rovvnd aboute the vlceration especiallye, is regenerated a tender viscouse flesh vvher through the vlceration can not, be cicatrized, although shee be cicatrized, therafter redubleth herforces, breacketh open agayne.
Such alteration procedeth of some co~curre~t humors, that desce~de on the bared bones, as appeareth vvhen they are through soackede vvith any pestiferouse humors, or els because they are of their flesh pellicle, or me~brane Periostio, denudatede and barede vvherthrough they corrupte vvaxe drye for vvant of blood vvhervvith they shoulde be nourished, or els because they are to full of humiditye, moysture, throughe the purule~t matter, vvhich co~tinuallye theron distilleth, corrodeth: ether because they are to much a~noyncted vvith oyle, to much fatty salves thero~ applyed, vvherby the vlceration is corrupted, putrified: Or because she is polluted, vvith the matter of the vlceratione, vvhich supernaturallye, from above is desce~ded theron distilled.
VVhe~as therfore for certaynty vve knovve that ther is putrefactio~, rotte~nes in the bone vve must then doe our devoyr to knovv hovv lardge, profovvnd the same is, because therby vve may the surer knovv, hovv vvith moste convenie~ce vve shoulde remove abolishe the same cause therin a separatione, because it is necessarye that the vivifice~t parte, expelle drive from it the mortified, or els the mortifiede allso cause mortificatione in the vivificent partes.
Concerninge the magnitude thereof, vve may discerne it through the sight, vnlesse it be operted vvith any viscoufe or slimye flesh, vve supposing doubtinge to be more putrefactione of bones, that is patefiede evidente vnto vs, throughe the circumiacent partes of the vlceraration, vvhich as then are purple coloured through the spongiouse flesh, through the elevatione of the edges of the vlceratione throughe the diuturnalle continua~ce of the same in one estate: For as Hippocrates affirmeth: In the venomouse vlcerations, vvhich for the space of a yeare have continuede, or longer, it can not othervvise be, but necessarilye in the bone vnder the fleshe of the vlceratione, must needes be a corruptione, putrefaction a corrosione, some peeces therof come out, the Cicatrises also vvill continually be co~cavouse, hollovve.
VVe therfore certaynlye knovvinge this, vve muste as then dilate the vlceratio~ denudate the bone, dilligentlye marck hovv large the foresayede putfactio~ is: vvhich muste be effectede vvith causticke medicamentes, by the vvhich the spongiouse fleshe, mvst be co~sumede, accordinge as the foresayede vlceratio~ reqvireth.
Celsus councelleth vs that firste vve make an inscisione in the ski~ne, to denudate the bone, if so be the putrefaction of the bone, be greater then the vlceratione, discidinge cuttinge of all the flesh rovvnde aboute, vnto the sovvnde bone: touchinge the depth of the putrefactione of the bone, vve may knovve it throughe the privet or searchinge iron, vvhen as vve feele theron, the vvhich pearcinge deep or not deep in the same, shevveth vnto vs that the foresayede corruptione of bone is great or smalle.
But if vv see the bone to be blacke dry as it happeneth bereft of blood the privet the~ vvill not enter therin, vvherfore the depth of such a corruptione, can so certaynly be knovven, as through the perforative Trepane, or els through the little grou~d dravver, vvherevvith vve must perforate the foresayede bone through vvhich perforatione of bone, vve easily shalle perceave, vvhether the bone be blacke, vvhyte, or redde, vvhether ther issuethe bloode out or not if it be so, it is then a signe that the putrefaction, of the bone is not deep.
And if so be vve perceave, the perforated bone to be blacke, it is then a token, that the putrefactione is deepe, because the corruptione of the bone, pearceth so deepe, vvhen vve perceave that the bone is vvhyte, redde, so farre is it then incorruptede.
To the vvhich Caries, or corrupting of bo~es vve muste vse the actualle Cauterye, or els allso the potentialle or the Raspatorium If so be the corruptione of the bone penetrateth not verye deepe, vve muste then grate the foresayed bone vvith a peculiare Raspatorye, in raspinge of the same, stifly crush thero~, that vve may qvicklye penetrate through the corruptione, the operatione, vvih all festinatione be effectede done.
All dau~ger beinge novv passed, vve perceavinge the bone to be vvhyte, smooth pure, solide, it is then sufficient: For it is impossible, that the foresayede corruptione of bones may have an end, as long as vve doe not liberat, free the same, by one mea~s or other, from all dau~ger, corruptio~.
VVhen vve perceave, in raspinge the bone to give bloode from it, it is then a signe that all corruptione is therout, and that the bone is vvell disposed, because that no corrupte or alterede bones vvill give from the~ any bloode.
This beinge done, vve as then vse the poulder of Aristolochiae of Mirrha of Ireas of Aloe to liberate the foresayed bone fro~ al cor+ruption praevente the same to be anye more putrefacted and corrupted.
If vve suppose, that the Raspatorium, be not sufficient enough, to remove the foresayed corruption, as vvhe~ she is deeply corroded invvardes, vvhen as ther is a peculiare corruptio~ imprinted in the bone, the same alsoe being fatt, oylye, if so be the patient vveare not timorouse of the fyer, the afsuredest remedye as then is, that vve cauterize the foresayed coruption, vvith an actuall Cauterye, vvhich conforteth that parte, and consumeth all venoumouse humors, vvith all festinatione causeth the corrupted bones to separate, causeth little, or noe payn at all, because the foresayed bone is insensible, and doth not communicate his vnhemence vnto the other circumiacent partes.
VVhen as therfore, vve desire to vse it accordinge to the depthe, greatnes of the coruption, or Caries, vve must therin vse a meane, of applyinge the foresayed Cauteriu~ on the bone, to vvitt vntill through the porositye of the bone ther commeth out, a frothye matter, noe lo~ger: for if vve helde it lo~ger theron, it should through his great callidity, throughe the exsiccatinge vertues therof, not onlye consume, the humeditye of the putrefaction of the bone but alsoe the naturall humiditye, moysture through vvhich occasio~, the fleshe ingendreth increaseth betvveene the sovvnde the corrupte bones: This doinge, nature in a certayne time therafter, vvill separate the corrupted bone, fro~ the sovvndebone, engendringe betvvee~ them bothe, a tenerouse fleshe, vvhich by little little hardeneth, as if it vveare vvhich foresayed fleshe, vve oftentimes may see, grovve cleane throughe the corrupted bone, that in such sorte, as the smalle tender grasse, grovveth through the grovvnde, as the~ is the suppuration, matter goode laudable, vvhyte, or reddishe coloured, and vvithout stincke.
And vve must heere alsoe farther note, that the Chyrurgian, may somtimes gentlely move, the corrupted bone being cauterized, stirre it, because nature ther through may be opitulated, vnto the separatione of the cauterised bone, and the foresayed bone lyinge so~vvhat raysed, may be lifted on highe, because as the~ it houldeth fast noevvhere, but vve may not vvith any viole~ce take the same therof, for in soe doing, the sovvnde, bone, before co~pletlye it be covered vvith fleshe might chaunce of the ayre, to be agayne infected, and corrupted.
Nether is it sufficie~t, that once vve apply the Cauterye theron, but must divers sundrye times doe the same, nether must it be glovvinge or red hott, but reasonable hott, removinge of the forsayed cautery fro~ one place of the bone to the other, or houldi~g of the same in one place, vntill the place be throughlye vvarmed.
The corruptio~, therfore or Caries being very deep, vve must them trepane or boare it vvith a perforative Trepane, vnto the sovvnd bone, or vvith the small grounde dravver, make divers hoales therin, the one close to the other, of an aeqvall depth also, as the corruption of the bone is, in vvhich trepaned hoales, vve must as the~ apply some little hott actuall cauteryes because the foresayed bone, ther by may be throughlye dryed: By this operation, the corrupted bone vvill separate it selfe fro~ the sovvnde bone, as heertofore vve have sayed.
If soe be that the vvhole substa~ce of the bone be corrupted, corroded, vve must then vvholye remove, take the same a vvay.
As Albucasis, to this purpose, reciteth a memorable history of on vvhome at three su~dry times he tooke avvay allmost the vvhole shinne bone, dividing also the operation, in thre sundrye aeqvall times, because the patient vvas not able, to tollerate soe greate payne, because of his great imbicillitye, alsoe because Albucasis feared least that vnder his ha~des he should have diede, because through certayne evacuations, he allvvayes fell into great fayntnes, but in the end vvas perfectlye cured: and in place of bone, ther ingendred in the place, a harde carnositye, vvhich so miraculouslye fortifyed from day to day, that he during some continuance of time therafter, coulde agayne couragiouslye goe one that legge.
VVhe~ as therfore it is reqvisite, to applye the foresayed actuall Cauterye one anye certayne place, vve must dilligentlye consider, hovv vve might liberate, defende, the circumiace~t partes of the Vlceratione, least they be touched of the cautery, vvhich vve may vvith most convenie~ce doe, vvith some certayne plasters, becaus nether the fatt nor any other ebullient humiditye, vvhich through the calliditye or heate of the cauterye might chaunce to runne therout, one the selfe same circumiace~t partes, of the vlceratio~, that therby they chaunced not to be burned, seared, vvhich vvould be the cause of greate payne and doloure.
Novv therfore to correct cure the Caries, or corruptio~ of bones, ther are divers Chyrurgianes of our times age, in place of the actuall Cauterye vse the potentialle: amongest the vvhich the oyle of vitrioll is in the most cheefest, in like sort alsoe the oyle of franckinse~ce, vvhich of divers Chyrurgians is highlye commended, and esteemed.
ANd because vve have not heer intended generally to vvrite of al fistles, to discours of theire matter, conditions, vvhat partes be therof polluted, of their occasiones, signes, prognosticationes, of the remedyes, of theire cures, it seemed expedient vnto me, breefelye to shevve, the meanes, to cure those vvhich reveale, demo~strate the~selves in the Fundament, that especiallye through a convenient handlinge, or operatione of Chyrurgerye vvhen as shortlye and breeflye shall have taught, in vvhat sorte vve may best and easyest knovve them.
Those Fistles vvhich are inge~dred in the fundament, are of divers sundry sortes: for some of the~ are occulte, others patefyede, the occulted are soe called, because vve noe vvher externally espye them, and internally in the foresayed fundament, or excrementall gutt have theire apertio~, issue in the muscle Sphincter, vvhether they be situated vpvvardes or dovvnvvardes, or any vvher one the syde, adioninge vnto any of the tvvo buttockes.
VVhich allthoughe vve can not evidentlye perceave them, yet may iudge, that the foresayed partes, are hurte or hi~dered, throughe the payne and throughe the stinckinge matter, and humiditye, vvhich issueth out of the foresayed fundament, through the vvhich commonlye, the shirtes of the patient are polluted, throughe certayne vlcerations also, vvhich before times in that parte they have hadde, or through certayne internall hemorrhodes, or through any inveterate vvou~d, vvhich vvas badly cured.
VVe may also somtimes see them vvithe our eyes, through the Speculum Ani.
The patefyed Fistles, are therfore soe called, because immediatlye vvithout any dau~ger vve may evidentlye see them: Of the vvhich ther are some vvhich lye croocked, and curved, although they have but one apertion, vvhich visiblye vve may see, yet they have divers vvayes, branches, or cubicles, like Conyeburrovves, vvhich of theire patent Orificium, in the bodye, runne this vvay and that vvay, vvhich vvith the searchinge iron somtimes vve may finde, vvhe~ as vve thrust it this vvay or that vvay, vvher vve feele it of his ovvne accorde to enter, together also, out of the great qvantity of matter, vvhich daylye issueth therout, vve may easylye iudge, that the foresayed Fistle, must needes have more concavityes, then by the externall fistulouse apertione vve can iudge, vvhich at somtimes is not greate.
Ther are alsoe some Fistles, vvhich externallye have but one issue, and doe not passe throughe the concavitye of the externall, or arsegutt, or through the muscle Sphincter, as easyly throughe the privet or searchinge vve may perceave vvhen vve thrusting the same therin, vve ca~ not anye vvher perceave it agaynst our fingers, to the vvhich intent vve must thrust the same middle finger of the left hand in the fundame~t, for if it soe be that vve betvveen our finger, and the privet feele anye thinge it is then a signe that it doth not pearce throughe but if vve feele it agaynst our finger, it the pearceth throughe.
And novv as concerning the curation of the same, vve vvill not heere treate of anye thinges belonging vnto the medicamentes, but onlye speake of the Chyrurgerye to the curing of this dissease: the vvhich on a threefoulde manner is taught vnto vs, as vvell in the curatione of the internalle, as externalle Fistles: to vvitt, ether throughe ligature, inscisione, or through Cauterye.
Although Avicenna, vvith more others are of opinione, that vvith anye of these foresayed remedyes vve ought in noe sort to meddle ther vvith vnles, they vveare too intollerable, and molestiouse vnto the patie~t, but that vvith cleane linnen, vvith Cotten, and vvith decent and convenient lavamentes, vve ought to sustayne them.
But for all this not vvithstanding, vvill heere discribe vnto you, our vse and customes of the auncient Chyrugians.
Novv therfore as vvell to cure the publiqve, and patent Fistles, as the occult and hidden, vve must cause the patient conveniently to lye, namelye that the patient must lye one his backe, vvith his legges on highe, retayning and houldinge the foresayed legges, close vnto his belly, and this is the maner, and customes of ayncient Chyrurgians.
But vve novve a dayes, cause the patie~t to stande on both his legges, vvith his heade, lyinge on a bedde, disioyninge separati~ge the foresayed legges vvyde the one fro~ the other, vvhich alsoe of tvvo servantes or sta~ders by must soe be helde, least that he agayne might chaunce to shut them.
The patient being thus situated, tovvardes the light, vve shall then thrust the middlemost finger of the left hande into the fundamente, havinge vvith some certayne oyle anoyncted your finger, and pared close your nayles: and in our right hande vve must have a privet or searchinge iro~, in forme of a needle, in the vvhich at the on end ther of must be a threde, vvhich foresayed needle, or Privet vve must thrust into the Orificium of the Fistle vntill vve sensibly feele the same on our finger, and then vvith our finger recurvate, the end of the foresayed needle, neatlye, conveniently reduce the same vnto the fundame~t, and then dravve the same therout, dilligentlye observinge, that internally vve hurte or vvou~de nothinge, and the threde alsoe beinge passed throughe the fundament vve must then cut of the foresayed needle from the threde, tye the endes of the foresayed threde both together, dravvinge the same reasonable fast, and close together, and vvith a slidinge knott binde the same together, because daylye vve might knitt the same closer, and continuinge this same soe longe in this sorte, vntill such time as vve shall have cutt avvay all the thred vvhich vvas remayninghe betvveene, both the Orificia, and both the apertions become to one, and the threde conseqventlye, vvithout anye more dissectione of the same, shalbe taken thereout.
But vve perceavinge the Fistle to have no issue in the concavitye the arsegutt, and the needle doth not come out agaynst our finger beinge in the foresayed arsegutt, and that ther as yet is some pellicle, or membrane betvveene them both, the needle havinge a reasonable sharpe acuitye or poyncte, vve must thrust the foresayed threded needle, or Privett, bouldlye, and audaciouselye therthroughe, into the foresayed concavitye of the Arsegutt, because vve might also dravv the foresayed thred therout, as alreadye above vve have me~tioned.
VVe must alsoe heere farther note, that this privet, or needle, must ether be of goulde or silver, because shee may the easyer internallye in the foresayed gutt be recurved.
VVe vse heervnto a silver plate, vvhich thervnto expressely, vve caused to be made, as this same plate, the foresayed Privett, or needle, before amo~gst the figures of the instrumentes, are also defigured, and sett dovvne vnto vs.
The threde must be of course thred, the same being tvvisted thre or foure times dubble.
And because that vnto some, the dissectione of this simple threde, falleth somvvhat tediouse, they annoyncte the same vvith some Causticke medicame~tes.
Gvido, effecteth this dissection, vvith a rescindent actuall Cauterye, to praevent the same that it pearce noe deeper, then it ought, he thrusteth in the fiistle a hollovv Privett, on the vvhich concavitye, he vvith the foresayed Cauterye pearceth the skinne, and in like sort alsoe cutteth throughe the fistle, bringeth, dirimateth avvay vvith it the callositye, praeventeth also the fluxione of bloode.
Others vvil not in anye sorte, have the fistle cauterized, nor bovvnde, tyed, but vvill only have that same to be inscided vvith a croocked lancett, vvhich is betvveene both the Orisicia, to vvitt of the fistle, and the excrementall, or arsegutt, that alsoe vvhich internallye is grovven callouse, they vvill have it to be crudifyed and made ravv, or excoriated, as vve are vsed to doe in the haremouthes: yet daylye experience teacheth vs, that the ligature is more certayne, the~ the inscisione, vvherin vve neede not to take avvaye the callosity, because it ofte~times chau~ceth, that vve endevoringe to remove, and take avvay this callositye, vve discide, and cutt of any of the Fibres, of the muscle Spincter, vvhich beinge vvounded, or hurte, the patient ther after can in no sorte restraygne his stooles, or excrementes.
It may seeme admiraculouse, strange vnto some, that vvrite that, the fistle may be cured throughe the ligature onlye, vvithout removinge the callositye, because it seemeth oppugnant vnto reason, because all combinatione, healinge together, is caused throughe the ioyninge or touching of vveake thinges together: yet dare affirme, that all those, vvhich have seen tyed, have bin perfectlye and sovvndlye cured vvithout in any sort to have touched, or removed the callositye.
Novv to come to the operation of the hidden fistles, havinge situated the patient as before is sayed, vve must then applye therin, the Speculum Ani, opening the fundame~t thervvith, vvith the least payn vve ca~, as vvyde as is possible, allvvayes annoynctinge the foresayed Speculum vvith oyle, throughe the vvhich sayed apertione, the Orisicium, of the vlceratione may appeare be appare~t vnto vs, vvhich concavityes or braunches, vve must thrust in a privet, vvhich must be of a reasonable thickenes, or crasitude, like vnto a small little needle vvherevvith vve are vvonted to make our stitches, vvhich must be blunte, in the one end must vvith a threede be threded, vvhich foresayed needle, or privet, vve must thrust vnto the bottome, or grovvnde of the fistle, vvhich penetrateth vnto the skinne, as vve easily may feele vvith our finger, on the vvhich, vvith the croocked lancet vve must make an inscision, the needle beinge in this sorte passed through, the Speculu~ Ani beinge taken avvay, vve must then dravve out the needle, and cutt her from the thred, and tye bothe the endes therof together.
Other say vve ought besides the privett, internallye to make an inscisione throughe the vvhol Fistle, vnto the other hole, vvhich is made on the other syde: but there is most certayntye in the ligatione, to avoyde the effluxion of bloode, vvhenas ther is sufficient flosh enough betvveene.
Ther have binne certayn auntient Chyrurgianes, vvhich coulde not agree vnto the Speculum Ani, but have onlye thrust there finger into the fundament, to dilate the same, and besydes the same a thinne and pusille privett, vvhervvith they have soe longe felt thervvith this vvay and that vvay vp, and dovvne, till such time as they have fovvnde the Orificium, of the fistle, vvhich is felt as if it vveare a thinge rent, or torne, and novv hauinge fovvnde the foresayed Orificium, they then close to ther finger thrust in the privett, conducinge the same alonge the finger supernallye, or vpvvardes, or thether vvher they suppose the bottome, or ground of the fistle to desiste, and end: vvhich throughe feelinge of the finger of the other hand vve may easylye discerne: and havinge fovvnde the end therof, and perceavinge the skinne or the fleshe not to be verye thicke, in stede of ligatione, vve violentlye thrust the privett ther throughe, vpvvardes, the privett beinge passed therthroughe, they then cutt open all that vvhich is situated betvveen the tvvo Orificia of the Vlceration, or els they thrust a threde ther throughe, and soe binde it throughe.
Amongst those vvhich are of opinione, that vve ought to cure the fistle throughe an actuall Cauterye Albucasis discribeth vnto vs the meanes, vvillinge vs to vse a Cauterye of iron thervnto, vvhich must be verye subtile, and glovvinge, or redhott, and that it be proportioned accordinge to the greatnes of the fistle, thrustinge the same tvvice, or thrice therin, vntill such time as all the callositye is taken avvay ther from, laudinge the fervent, glovvinge Cauterye, above the cuttinge or rescindent Cauterye, because the glovvinge Cautery, as he sayeth correcteth and amendeth the vnte~peratnes of that parte ther follovveth noe effluxione of blood the callosity therof is burned avvay, the superfluouse humidity is exsiccated, vvhich vvas concursed, and assembled together vnto that patte. [leaf motif]How we ought to extracte, drawe forthe little infantes out of theire mothers bodye, which of themselves can not be borne.
BEfore vve offer to imploy our ha~des, on such on operatione: it seemed expedie~t vnto me to admonishe the Chyrurgiane vvhat vvoeme~ may escape this dau~ger, because vve should ob+tayne great blame and discredite, vnto our selves, if so be the vvoman being in childebearth, should chaunce vnder our handes to dye, she supposinge, by our helpe, councell to be released out of this daunger, VVherefore those vvhich vve suppose to be in daunger of death, vve must not in any sorte laye ha~des on them· because the countenance and cheare of those vvoemen vvhich are in laboure, or childebearthe and also ther face, administreth sufficient knovvledge vnto vs, vvhat event, or successe the matter shall have: for those vvhich are in any great dau~ger, of their lives, have a strau~ge vvonderfull behaviour over them, to vvitt that shee troubleth, or molesteth her self vvith nothing, hath a fearfull sight, vvhich is cleane contrarye to her naturalle beinge, is debilitated, hath hollovve eyes, a sharpe nose, a feeble Puls, vvhich beateth obscurely, and vvithout time: Shee is vvholy co~victed, as if she hadde the soporiferouse dissease, vvith out all stre~gth, cleane layed alonge, although vve speake vnto her, yet vve can not avvake~ her, if vve doe lo~g trouble, plucke her, shee speaketh verye feeblelye, vvith noe strength, and then agayne lyeth, as it vveare in a great sleep: the ayre alsoe flyeth out of her throte.
Those in the vvhich is anye strength left, they fall into Spasmo, or convulsion of synnues.
Others after they haye con+tinued a long time in theire labors, as are those vvhich have bin troubled molested thervvith the space of five, or sixe monethes, they are vvholye decayed, grovve~ leane, vvholy consumed, for vvant of foode, because alsoe that vvhich shee hath eaten, is not chau~ged into any nouriture, the vvhol boodye beinge thorough soacked vvith humidity, especiallye the face, vvherof her svveat most commonlye, is fattye, axungiouse, and smearye.
But those vvhich can suffer the manuall operatione, are fitt, to have the child dravven out of their bodye, have none of these fore rehearsed accidentes, vvherfore vvithall festinatio~ alsoe they must be opitulated, helped, on this ma~ner as heerafter follovveth notvvitsta~nding vvithout rashlye, or temorously to beginne the same, vvithout beinge certifyede, of the Midvvyfe, vvhat the reason or occasione might be, vvhye the vvoman can not be delivered, or bringe forth her childe, beinge certifyed heereof, as vvell of the parturinge vvoma~, as of the Midvvyfe, in as much as is possible, dilligge~tly considering the same, having vvell perpe~ded it, therout to knovve the iust occasione of this heavines sorrovv, considering, vvhether it taketh his occasion of the parturie~t vvomen, or els out of the childe, because therby vve might knovv hovv to rule, govern our selves If so be this dau~ger consisteth in the mother, it happeneth then, ether because of her mistruste or smalle hope, or because shee is fearfulle, and fayntharted, havinge the vvombe, and the necke or entrance of the sam, small anguste, because shee is yonge small of body, tender, and delicate: Or els because the entrance of the foresayed VVombe, lyeth recurved, or is occlu+ded vvith some tumor, or els there is som Apostematione vlceration, or any Carnositye ther in, vvhich oppugne themselves agaynst the bearth of the infant: Ether because that the mother, hath a stone in her Bladder, vvhich therin alsoe beinge oppressed, seeketh by all meanes possible to come therout, and beinge come into the mouth, or entrance of the Bladder, crusheth there the entrance of the VVombe, vvher throughe she is angust, or els because therin is som cicatrice, vvher through she is narrovver, then she ought to be, vvher through she ca~ not in any sorte stretch forth her selfe.
Childe bearth alsoe in some vvoeme~ is hindered above all these foresayed accidentes, because they ar to fearfull, are to much affrighted, of the parture, or Childbirth, as yet not beinge vsed vnto the labouring of childe, doe not yet knovve therafter to governe the~selves, as vveare condecent, and needfulle.
Others are grovvne impotent, throughe anye praecedente sicknesses, and having noe strength at all to deliver the conceptione or fruicte from them.
The childe alsoe may be occasion heerof, because it is to feeble, and ca~ not helpe it selfe, in the deliverance of his mothers labors, and that especiallye vvhen it is deade, and svvolle~: in like sorte also the same beinge to grosse, and greate, ether in any parte of his body, as havinge tvvo heades, four armes, beinge dubble, or els if ther be moe, then one, to vvitt, tvvo, three, or four, vvherof the one might praesent his arme, an other his legge, or anye other part, all at one time.
Afther the infa~t praesenteth himselfe, the childebirth falleth easye, or difficulte: because, that follovvinge the naturall Childebirth, the childe allvvayes praesenteth first his heade, havinge his armes stretched out alo~gest both his sydes: or vvhe~ it praese~teth it selfe vvith both the legges forvvarde, vvherby it may easylye be plucked dravven out: vvhen it praesenteth him one anye other manner, it is as then not naturall, but verye daungerouse, vvherin vve must vse our remedyes as herafter shalbe shevved.
Touchinge the externall occasiones, they are viole~t heate, vvherthrough the strengthe forces of our bodyes are convicted: contrarilye, ther is great could, vvherthrough, all the conduictes are stopped as allsoe are those persons vvhich vve feare, or hate.
The childe alsoe as longe as it lyeth drye, the vvater as yet is not broke~ out, vvherthroughe it can have no passage, because the vvayes passages are drye, not slippery, not smoothe, as in the vvater streames vve may see, that the stones, through the slipperishenesse of the vvater, are carryed avvay.
In like sort alsoe all sorrovve, tribulatio~, stoppeth occludeth the entrance of the vvombe: as co~trarilye the meane, reasonable iucunditye, openeth the same.
All these foresayed occasions, must be co~pared, vnto ther co~traryes, as if soe be that throughe the imbicilitye of the mother it be occasioned, she must the~ be conforted, givinge her a little vvyne, or Hipocras, conforting, ioyinge her in her necessitye, as much as is possible: if soe farr forth as the passage, be to narrovve, or anguste, to exsiccate, or dry, or els to much shru~cke, vve must then, endevore vvith decoctiones, vvith vvarme infusions, vvith pingvefactio~s, to soften, moyste~, make supple the same: If then ther be anye carnositye, vvhich in terrupteth the passage therofe, vve must depose, detrude the same one the one syde: or if ther be a stone in the entra~ce of the bladder, vve must thrust the same on highe: if soe be the Childe othervvise praesent it selfe the~ it should, as first vvith the heade, vve must then turne it in the best sorte vve maye: or if it thrust one arme, or legge out, vve must not thervvith dravve it out, but must gentlelye retrude it backe agayne, agayne bringe it into his place: or if ther, be more the~ one child, vve must dilligently consider hovve vve ought to take hould therone, notinge that vve doe not take the one by the foote and the other by the foote, soe both at once plucke the~, vvherfore vve must thrust one foote on highe, dravve tovvardes him the foote of that vvhich is next, most rediest vnto the passage.
But before vve come to the manuall operatio~, vve must first of al situate the vvoma~ convenientlye: although ther be divers ma~ners of situationes, (for some sett the~ in a stoole, others set the~ leani~ge, on a table, or one the edge of a bedd, vvith the legges separated the one from the other: others set them one theire knees) yet the best fittest vvay is one a bedde, causinge the vvoma~ to lye one her backe, thvvarte over the bedde, close to the edge ther of, vvith cushe~s or pillovves vnder her backe, to rest her heade thero~, layinge her heeles close to her buttockes, vvhich must lye alsoe som+vvhat exalted, and the hippes spanned the one fro~ the other, vvhich of tvvo vvoeme~ must so in that sorte be helde, least that she doe not chau~ce to dravve, shutt them together: the vvoma~ lyinge in this sorte, the Chirurgian as then may the easyer obtayn his vvill, and com close vnto her, to drive, detrud the child tovvarde the entrance of the vvombe.
The vvoma~ beinge thus setled, or layed, the Chyrurgia~ must lay one the knees, one the belly of the vvoma~ a cleane linne~ clothe, partly to be an opercle, or coveringe to the vvoman, partlye ther through to be freed from the externall ayre: the~ he must gentlely thrust his hande being annoyncted vvith freshe butter vvith Sallatoyle, or vvith hogges suct, in to the entrance of the vvombe, first of all co~sideringe vvhether the childe be alive, or deade, hovv it is therei~ disposed, or turned, vvhether also ther be more the~ one, tvvo, or thre children a fore ha~des: hovve soever it be situated, or disposed, ether alive, or deade, curved, or croocked, if it be possible vve must dravve the heade first out, but if not, vvith both the legges, dravvinge the same aeqvally dovvnevvardes, cause, one of the armes, to be stretched out, alo~gest the syde of the heade, because ther throughe may be hindered, that the bodye beinge therout the vvombe doe not chaunce to shutt, the necke of the Childe be not therin inclosed, vvhich through the arme vvhich lyeth stretched out by his heade shalbe praevented hindered.
If so be the one foote praesenteth it selfe, the other tarrye theri~, vve must tye the foresayed foote vvith a ribbon gentlye thrust in agayn the foresayed foote, sufferinge the end of the ribbon to hange out, and inqvire, seeke after the other foot, thrustinge the hande, alongst by the foresayed foote, legge vntill such time, as vve feele the buttocke of the other foote, then reducinge your hande close to the buttok shall immediatlye finde the other foote, vvhich ge~tlely you must bring forevvardes, dravvinge by the ribbo~, the other foote, vvil come forth agayn, vvhich having the~ both aeqvally together must ge~tly dravve~ the~ out vvith, the rest of the vvhole bo+dye of the child: by this means vve may knovv vvhether they be both the legges of one child, on this ma~ner dravving out the same, first the one then the other.
But if so be the Childe be deade, it vvill not as then stirre it selfe, in the feelinge also therof it vvill be coulde, vvhenas vve thrust the fi~ger in the mouth therof, it stirreth nether lippes, nor tunge to suck: The mother as then hath a stinckinge breath, hollovve eyes, and a svvollen bellye: vve therfore out of all these foresayed tokens, perceavinge the Childe to be dead, vve must then dravve it out as already vve have sayed vvith the feet forvvardes: As farre forth therfore as if the Childe had one arme or one Legge hanging forth of the vvo~be it vveare impossibleto reduce the same agayne into his former sitvation, because that throughe the bodye of the Childe, the entrance of the vvombe is stopped, vve must then plucke the foresayed arme or legge dravve it to the ioyncte of the shoulder, or of the hippe: then discide, cut of the same in the fore+sayed ioncte.
And if so be the heade did first repraesent it selfe, vve must then thrust both our fingers into the mouth therof in place of a hoocke, tovvardes the roofe, and so as gentlye as is possible dravve the same tovvardes you.
If soe be the belly therof be svvollene, or hath to greate a heade, and the same fulle of vvater, vve must then vvith our finger, a little crush theron, because the aquosity might soacke therout, and the svvollen partes by this meanes be diminished and vnsvvollen: if soe be that our handes vveare not sufficient to dravve out the Childe, or to finde the belly, to let out the sayed Aquosity, vvhich ether is retayned, in the heade, in the Brest, or in the bellye, vve must then gently vvith our right hande bringe therin, a little curved and croocked knife, vvhich vvithin the curvednes therof is sharpe, and cutttinge, the acuitye or povncte therof being closely inclosed betvvixt his fingers, vvhich he must houlde verye close together, vvhervvith vve must make an inscisione ether in the Heade, in the Breste, or els in the Belly, by this meanes to dravve forth the vvater vvhich is therin co~tayned: And then vve must take, a hook, vvhich on the same fashon as is afore sayed vve must bring therin, vvherof vve must fasten the poyncte, ether in the eyes, or in the mouth, or in the Clavicles, vvheron vve must then dravve as violentlye as the cause reqvireth to be done, dilligentlye co~sideringe that the hooke breack not through let his houlde goe, through the violente pluckinge of the same doe not chau~ce to ha~ge take houlde in the VVombe, to the vvhich inte~t vve must vvith as much iudgeme~t, co~si+deration, dravve the same as is possible, onlye vvith one hande vvhich muste be vvithin the VVombe.
Novv if the Childe, be so thick, so grosse, that vvholy to dravv it out is impo+ssible for vs or els if it be a Monster, or tvvo Childrene faste together, vve must as then by parcels dravve them out, cuttinge the Heade thereof in peeces, then plucke out first the the one peece, then the other, then the Brest the Armes, and the legges, allvvayes makinge that it be cut in the ioynctes, vvithout breakinge any bones: for although they be tender, yet the splinters therof might chaunce to hurte the vvombe, soe that it is allvvayes the surest vvay vve cutt of the Armes, and legges in their ioynctes.
It chau~ceth also so~times, that vve dravvinge forthe the Childe by the legges, that onlye the head tarrieth therin vvhich therafter vvithout great difficulty vve ca~ not get it out, the~ vvith extreame daunger, because the same rovvleth vp and dovvne in the concavitye of the vvo~be: this therfor being happened, ther must as then a servant, or one of the stande~rs bye vvhich is experimented in such affayers, sitti~g one the left syde of the vvoman, crushe vvith both his handes one the bellye of the vvoma~, beinge covered vvith a vvarme cloth on this manner to depresse dovvnevvardes the heade of the childe, and ther in that place to contayne, and keepe the same.
And the Chyrurgiane vvhich sitteth on the right syde of the vvoman must vvith his light hande bringe the hoocke therin, as is already sayed, vvhich he must fafte~ in the heade, ether in the eyes, in the mouth or in the apertione of the heade, dravve the same by little, little therout, as if, as yet the vvhole bodye remayend therin: If soe be the foresayed head vveare to great, vve must then in like sorte alsoe cutt the same in peeces, and dravv therout the peeces first the one, then the other.
The Childe beinge dravven therout, vve must dilligentlye consider, that vve doe not breake a sunder the navell, because it may serve for a conductor, leader, vvhich vve must allvvayes feelinge the same, and suffering it to glide throughe our right hande must follovve vntill vve be come to the matrice vvhervvith the Childe vvas covered in the foresayed vvo~be: hauinge found the same, vve must gentlye rovvnde about separate her vvher vve finde her to befastened, then dravve her forth vvith al the co~gregrated blood theri~, if therbe anye, least that there it might chaunce to putrifye: havinge thus finished all this, the vvoman as then shall ioyne, and shutt her hippes together agayne, and must then circumligate the bellye, as is required, and necessarye.
In this forerehearsed daunger, is oftentimes incident vnto the vvoman a farre more lamentable and pitiful accident, to vvitt, a discendinge, and sinckinge do vvnvvardes of the vvombe, vvhich betvveen the hippes sincketh out, throughe the vvhich the vvoman, can not goe.
If soe be therfore this chaunced, vve must gentlye, and easilye by degrees thrust in agayn the same, as vve have sayed of the guttes, or entralles being sunck out, vvherof vve must cause the disseased and sicke vvoman to keepe her bedde some certayn co~tinuance of time, vvith her buttockes a little exalted, and if soe be the Matrice in her risinge chaunced agayn to sincke out, vve must then agayn, thrust in the same.
And to praevent her that she doe not agayne sincke out of the bodye, vve must the~ thrust in the Matrice a Pessarium, like a rovvnde Apple, vvhich must have a hole in the middle therofe, as heer before amongest the instrumentes vve may see it defigured vnto vs vvher vve shall alsoe finde, the forme, the figure, the manner of vsinge the same.
[leaf motif]VPpon what occasione, the externall partes as Armes, and legges are, and must be extirpated, or cutt of and in what place it must be done.
THe externalle membres of ma~s bodye, as are Armes, legges, are cutt, or savved of, vvhen as they are sqvised, plettered, and broke~, the Vaynes, Arteryes, Synues, vvholy be lacerated, cutt of: Or els vvhen they concerninge any externalle occasione are hurte, or indammaged, vvherby they so~times vvholy come to be mortifyed, that suddaynlye, or els somtimes alsoe by degrees, so that somtimes ther ensueth such a Gangraena, or mortification, that not only the fleshe, all the other mollifyed partes, of the foresayed ioyncte, doe mortify corrupte, but alsoe the Bones themselves, soe that ther is noe hope at all, of any health, then onlye throughe the extirpatione of the same, fearinge least that the foresayed Gangraena, shoulde farther infect pollute all the circumiacent partes, vvherethroughe the patient might suddaynlye chau~ce to dye. Notvvithstandinge the Chyrurgiane may not in anye forte aproch vnto his exstreame, last remedye, before he have tryed all other remedyes, to ease appease this forsayed mortificatione, to save the ioyncte: because that such an operatione, can not be done, then throughe extreame daunger, as oftentimes the patientes themselves, doe dye vnder our ha~des, because of the great effluxione of bloode, or els some greate fayntnes.
Others immediatly after the extirpatione fall into a Phrensye, in extreame, intollerable payne, in Spasmo, in a coulde svveat, vvheron praesentlye, follovveth death.
VVherfore first of all vve ought to admonishe the frendes, kinsfolke of the patient, certifye vnto them that this operatio~ is full of dau~ger, and is as vvell lamentable for the Chyrurgiane as for to patient: and that vve ought not therof the make anye greate matter of vvorth, or estimation, seinge ther is no other hope, nor anye other successe to be expected, that it seemeth more convenient, and necessarye, to extirpate the mortifyed ioyncte, and soe to avoyde flye death, vvhich is more terrible, and fearfull, then the losse onlye of one ioyncte.
And before vve beginne this operatione, that vve must extirpate, the foresayed ioyncte, it is necessary that first of al vve knovv, the place vvher it must be done, because of divers opinions vvhich are hadde therof: for some are of opinione, that in the ioyncte vve ought to doe it, because in this place it vvoulde fall easyer for the Chyrurgiane to execute the same, is alsoe more tollerable and easyer for the patient, bebecause ther it may be done vvith more festinatione, vvith a simple inscision of a vvell rescindent and cuttinge knife, if onlye the Chyrurgiane be agile, and experte, in findinge of the ioyncte.
Novv as touchinge those vvhich suppose all vvou~des of the ioynctes, to be more subiected, vnto deadly, and dolorouse accidentes, the~ those vvhich happe~ to be thre fingers above, or vn+der the same, yet for all that they are noe lesse davngerouse, because of the Tendones, and al other sunnuish partes, vvhich as then are alsoe cutt of, vvhich are rounde more thicker there then in the ioynctes themselves: VVherfor vve neede not to feare, that ther vvill follovve more payne, or convulsione, althoughe the extirpatione vvhich is done, three, or foure fingers belovve, or above the same, because the Te~dones, and the synnues are as vvell in the on place as in the other aequallye cutt of.
And vvhich is more, if vve extirpate a membre in the ioync+te, the marrovve, of the pipe as the~ is not denudated, because of the Epiphysis, vvhervvith it is covered, and contayned: But contrarilye if vve savve throughe the focille, or pipe, the marrovve as the~ is denudated, for the praeservatione of vvhich Nature vvith greate difficultye, must have a longe time, to enge~dre a Callum thervnto, and to cover it, because nature must separate that end of the savved bone: And besydes all this, ther follovveth noe superfluous effluxion of bloode, as Hippocrates in his boocke of Hemorrhoidibus, vvitnesseth vnto vs. Althoughe that all these foresayed reasons, are sufficient enoughe, to persvvade the yonge Chyrurgian, to extirpate the members in their ioynctes and Hippocrates, allsoe commaundeth councelleth the same, yet al PractisionerS of Chyrurgerye, doe heere in agree, vnite their opinions together, that vve ought to extirpate the membre, three, or four fingers vnder, or above the ioyncte, accordinge to the dispositio~e reqviringe of the motified ioynct: For first of all the opratione is done vvith such festination so certayn, because of the facility therof, for vve may righte vvell knovve that the vvhole infectede, spoylede parte, most commonlye svvelleth, the finitimate partes also thervnto lyinge, that vvithout greate daunger difficultye, vve can not knovve the ioyncte or the place therof in the vvhich vve ought very vvarily to enscide: Farther allso the ioynctes are most co~monlye verye difficulte, cleane to cutt them of, or extirpate them, because of the bones, vvhich are placed the one in the orher.
Touchinge therfore the certayntye therof experience teacheth vs, that an inconvenience may as vvell come of the one, as of the other: And such vvoundes, are noe lesse mortalle, then the vvoundes of the ioynctcs.
Secondlye, ther much sooner follovveth a cicatrice, becau+se of the greate qvantitye of fleshe, vvhervvith the bone on all sydes is circumcinglede, covered vvhich in that place is not of such a crassitude, spongiousnes, as in the ioyncte.
And althoughe the Cicatrice can not so soone be effectede, the patient neverthelesse needes not abstayne from going, that vvithout payne allso, layinge his knee in a stilte, vvhervvith he shall as then abyde the time of his complet sanatione: The vvhich he in that sorte shoulde not be able to doe, before that the cicatrice vve are vvholye curede, obduratede, if so be his legge hadde binne extirpatede in the ioyncte, because the vvhole body resting theron, throu+ghe the confricatione, or rubbinge together of the same might chaunce to breacke open agayne.
As touching my selfe, have allvvayes fou~de that the cicatrice hath ever binne very difficulte, yea allmost impossible to be curede effectede in the ioynct, but i~mediatlye therafter is openede agayn, hovv little soever the bodye restede therone.
VVherfore also am of the same minde, opinione, vvith all other common Chyrurgianes that as vvell consideringe the festinatione, facilitye of the operatione, as allso the brevitye of the generatione of the cicatrice, that vve ought to doe our extirpation or savvinge of, of anye membre, three, or foure fingers breadth above, or vnder the ioynct, to vvitt, of the Legge, if it be vnder the knee: For allthoughe the Gangraena, or mortificatione of the Legge, vveare onlye belovv in the foresayed Legge, the middle of the Legge as yet illaef vnhurt, sound, vvherfor it is all vvayes better to make the stumpe short, then longe, because vvithe his length, it is associated vvith a certayne deformitye, might cause greate impediment vnto the patiente, vvith thrustinge of the same, heer agaynste this thinge, ther agaynste somvvhat els. VVhich in the Arme is contrary because ther it is better, that vve suffer him keepe as longe a parte therof, as is possible to be by any meanes done, It is right true, if so be the Gangraena, or mortificatione of the Legge, doe end in the ioynct or, close thervnto, noe higher then to the beginninge of the hippe vve must then allvvayes rather doe the extirpatione in the ioyncte, then above the same, especiallye in the hippe: Because the accidentes might allvvayes be vvorse, consideringe the greate Vaynes, Arteryes, Synnues, vvhich by hovv much the more vve plucke, dravve them vpvvardes, so much the greater vve finde them: And then the cicatrized parte, shoulde be constraynede to reste on the artificiall, fayned legge, as if vve extirpatede the same in the ioyncte: Be it therfore vvhat place you vvill chuse, vve must note, that allvvayes vve rather take avvay some of the sovvnde parte allso, then leave anye of the corruptede, or mortifiede parte behinde.
Because that such a parte of mortificatione, might allso corrupte, mortify, the finitimate sovvnde part, so that the patient, should have suffered all the davvnger, payne in vayne, for nought, to continue his lyfe, vve shoulde be constrayned to make an other extirpatione.
How we ought to doe the extirpatione, or sawinge of, of a ioyncte and how we may stopp the bloode, after we shall have layed downe the Patient.
HAvinge noted the place, vvhere vve intende to doe the extirpatione, vve muste situat the patient as it is reqvirede, not onlye consideringe the nature, disposition qvallitye of the parte, vvhich vve intende to extirpate, but allso one the Chyrurgiane his co~modity, that the patient sitt not agaynst the day, ligt of the Chyrurgian, not to highe, nor to lovve, nor on a place vvher he might slippe as it oftentimes hath chaunced, the patient sittinge to farre in the bedde.
Some are of minde that vve ought to sett the patient on a stoole because he may sitt the faster, convenienter: Others effect this operation, the patie~t sittinge on the edge of a bedde, fearing least he should grovv faynt, or syncopize, might the~ vvith more ease be gotte~ into his bedde resti~g place the extirpatione beingedone..
But my vse is, to cause the patie~t to itt in a resonable lovve chayre, because all beddes are not of one hight, nether are soe readye, and fitt for our purposes nether so vvell tovvardes the day, vvheras vve may set the chayre vvheare vve our selves liste: farther the patient is more surer in such a place, may alsoe better, vvith more convenience be held, and better tovvardes the Chyrurgians hande, as vvell to cutt throughe the fleshe, as to savve of the bone and restraygne the bloode: the servantes allsoe shall have more better oportvnity to houlde the patient fast in more safetye.
Therfore to effect and finishe this operatione, the Chyrurgyne must stande betvveene the legges of the patient, and must cause a servant, or sta~der bye as much as is possible vvith both his handes to strippe vp the skinne the muscles vvhich are situated above the extirpatione, after he shall have caused the patient to bende the ioyncte, that as vvell for the longatione of the skinne, as lengtheninge of the Vaynes, and Arteryes, vvhich after the extirpation of the Ioyncte, the ligature being taken avvay, vvill more easyer as then demonstrate them selves, be more easyer taken houlde of vvithe the Crovvesblil, and they tyen or cauterized: Then vve must immediatly one the place, vvher vve intend to make our extirpation, lay a stronge ligatvre of stronge linnen, the same being reasonable closelye dravvne together and that because of divers occasions: First of all because the Ioynct may be praese~ted the stedyer and faster to the Operator, and because the fleshe should the better beare, and receave the inscione of the croocked, or curved knife: Secondlye, because the sensibilitye of the foresayed Ioynct, in the scissure, might partlye be therthrough benummed, and somvvhat mitigated: Thirdlye, because after the inscision, in sovvinge of the bone, the bloode might be soe longe throughe the foresayed ligature restraygned, kept backe.
Farther more, by this meanes vve keepe the skinn muscles on highe, vvhich after the operatio~, the ligature beinge dissolved, made loose, sinck agayne dovvnvvardes, and cover the savved bone, by vvhich meanes the Cicatrice the sooner grovveth therover, and serveth the foresayed bone therafter, in steede of a Cushone.
All vvhich beinge finished, vve must then vvith a croocked knife, vvhich is very sharp, cut through the fleshe close vnto the ligature rou~de abovvte, vnto the bare bone, vvithout leavi~g any thinge betvvee~ the bones vncutt, if ther be tvvo, scrapinge of vvith the backe of the knife the membrane Periostium, vvhervvith the bone is covered, because vve doe not chaunce to teare the same, vvith the teeth of the savve, vvhich vvoulde cause an intollerable payne vnto the patient, also in serratinge, or savvinge might be some hinderance: In like sorte also vve must remove the fleshe as much out of the vvay as is possible, then vvith a vvell cuttinge savve, savve of the vvhole legge as close to the fleshe as may be, dilligentlye notinge, that vvith the teeth of the savve vve doe not in any sort touch the foresayed fleshe.
The legge novv beinge extirpated, vve must the~ dissolve make loose the ligame~ts, vvhich vveare tyed above the vvound, strippe dovvnevvardes the skinne, and the muscles, because the bone of al sydes may be vvel covred: vvhich beinge done, if soe be there be but little bloode issued therout, vve must not then (especiallye vvhere there is a Gangraena, so soone restraygne the same, but as yet let it a little more bleede, that as longe, as you suppose it may vvithout anye davnger to the Patie~t be done, because that parte there throughe might the better ease her selfe, and be disburthened, and soe much the lesse be subiect vnto anye inflamationes.
The bloode havinge indifferentlye and reasonably issued therout according to the stre~gth of the Patient, vve must as then stoppe, and restraygne it, vvhich vve must doe throughe the imposition of the fingers one the mouthes, or apertio~s of the Vaynes, vvhich vve must ether bind or els cauterise the one or the other accor+ding as the same shalbe needfull, and requisite, it be ether through binding, or cauterizinge, as the auncient Chyrurgians of former times have done, vve have co~mitted it to the memory, of those of our times.
For as in example, if ther be anye member corrupted, and mortified, vvhich must be extirpated, after vvhich extirpatione, the fluxion of bloode, must be farre more stopped, throughe the applicatione of glovvinge cauteryes, on the appertio~, or mouthes of the vaynes, the~ throughe the ligation, or binding of the same, because the glovvinge cauteryes, make one the foresayed Orificia of the vaynes an Escara, vvherthrough the foresayed Orificia of the vaynes are occluded and the bloode stenched, because it ca~ noe more issue out, by vvhich meanes it dravveth vnto it selfe, also consumeth al the venoumouse evaporations, dampes, and bringeth the~ to nought, vvhich as yet throughe the foresayed vaynes, have bi~ne retayned in the supersituated partes, although, it semeth not that the foresayed parte is in any sorte corrupted, or putrifyed, then onlye soacked throughe vvith some certayne venoumousenes, vvhertroughe sometimes that parte hath binne prepared as it vveare to some mortificatione, or Gangraenatione: that vve supposing to take houlde one the vaynes vvith the Crovvesbill, and soe to bind them, doe most commonlye chaunce to breake betvveene the Crovvesbill, or els hovv gentlelye soever vve knit the threde together, one that sorte to tye them, are throughe the tyinge of the threde notvvithastndinge cutt a sunder: vvherthroughe vve are in the end constrayned to vse the actuall Cauterye.
And not vvithout occasione, Galenus testifyeth vnto vs, to be a thinge verye expediente, necessarye, to stench, and restraygne the bloode throughe actualle Cauteryes, vvhich throughe anye corruptione, hath corroded throughe the vaynes, because they, nether are able to suffer the Crovvesbill, therby to be dravvne out, nether the tyinge, bindinge.
It is also the most surest vvay, to cauterize all that, vvhich throughe the Gangraena is corrupted, or els, that vve applye theron any Causticke medicamentes, as vve are vsed to doe one the originalle of al corruptions.
VVherfore if so soe be the Chyrurgian have anye suspicione, of anye venoumousenes, vvhich after the extirpation, might be dravven invvardes tovvardes the finitimate partes theraboute, it is as then the surest remedye, that to the restraygninge, and stenchinge of the blood, he have in praeparatione, and readines, three, or fovr fervent, glovvinge cauteryes, vyhich he must applye on the Orificia of the descided vaynes, vvithout houlding, or depressing the same to harde theron, because thus doinge ther may be left behinde a goode Escara And if it chaunced that the bloode throughe the applicatione of one cautery vveare stenched, it is then sufficiently cauterized, nether must vve anye more cauterize the same Vayne, prosecutinge of the same, on the other vaynes.
Contrarilye, vve beinge constrayned to extirpate anye membre, beinge verye much plettered, and broken, vvhich throughe noe Gangraena, or corruptione is putrified, it is as then most convenie~t, to restraygne the blood, throughe takinge hould of the Vaynes, or Arteryes, vvith the Crovvesbill, compraehendinge allsoe some parte of fleshe thervvith, vvhich vvith a good stronge threede vve must binde together, as allsoe the fleshe, vvhich vvith the threde is tyed, is an occasione, that the ligature must be the more certayner, and surer.
And as Galen findeth it goode, to stench the bloode, throughe actuall cauteryes, vvherby is anye corruptione, or putrefactione, in like sorte alsoe he commendeth the ligature in the effluxione of bloode, vvherby is noe corruptione, or anye venoumousnes.
VVhich right vvel may be an agreeme~t betvvixt to great personages of our time, vvher of the on is a Physicione, and the other a Chyrurgiane, because of a certayne dispute, vvhich they had, concerninge this matter, of the meanes, vvhich vve ought to vse, in the restraygninge of bloode, as they have agitated most inmicisiously this disputatione the one agaynst the other vvithout the one, vnderstandinge the other.
The bloode therfore throughe the foresayed meanes beinge stenched, restraygned, vve must as then strovve some restringe~t poulder one that parte, and applye therone divers drye plumaciolles, or flatt tentes, and therone an ordinarye restringent, or defensive plaster, layinge rovvnde about the stumpe, a plaster of Refrigerans Galeni, because that the foresayed defensive, shoulde not chaunce to cleave too fast therone, and soe binde the parte, as it requireth, and then curinge the same as a simple vvounde, allvvayes dilligentlye consideringe that vve doe not take avvay the Escara, vvhich throughe the foresayed Cauteryes is made, nether the threedes allsoe vvher vvith the Vaynes have binne tyed, if soe be at least ther be anye.
It happeneth allsoe sometimes, that the Vaynes after that they have binne cutt of doe dravve themselves invvardes, soe that vvith the Crovvesbill in noe sorte vve can take houlde therone: It might allsoe chaunce, that the tyed Vayne, might chaunce to vntye, vvherthrough the patiente is charged vvith a nevve effluxion, of bloode.
If soe be anye of these accidentes chaunced, and come vnto your handes, and it seemed best vnto you, to Cauterize the Vayne, then to binde her, or els rather to binde, then to Cauterize her, and such a mischaunce, or accident happened into your handes vnexpected, and not beinge therone provided, vvithout havinge anye Cauteryes in are adines, the right vvorshipfull Mr. Pare councelleth vs very fitlye to stench the bloode.
The vvhich if in tvvo or thre or four Vaynes it chaunced, or Arteryes, at one time then must the servant, of one of the circumstantes, lay the endes of his fingers, one each vayne one, gentlelye crushinge the same, one the Orificia of the Vaynes, because as Galen sayeth the Chyrurgiane may have time, to restraygne the bloode: And then take a needle of a fingers length, or longer, and of a reasonable crassitude, vvhich is very sharpe, and rescindent, as heere before is defigured vnto vs, beinge threded vvith a stronge threde, vvhervvith the vayne after this sort follovvinge must be tyed.
Havinge first of al considered, vvhere the bleeding Vayne is situated, you must the~ thrust your needle therthroughe, beginninge on the skinne a good fingers bredth higher then the vvounde, one the syde of the Vayne, makinge the same to come contradictorilye out of the vvou~de, to vvitt one the syde, alsoe somvvhat lovver then the Orificium of the Vayne, because the threde may be thervnder, ther to circumcin+gle the same, sufferinge the end of the threde to hange one the skinne, vvithout extractinge, or vvholye dravvinge out of the same: Then you must agayne, thrust the same needle inter nallye in the vvounde, one the other syde of the vayne, because in soe doinge, the threde, vvhich vvith both his endes is come forth externallye on the skinne may take houlde on the foresayed vayne, vvith some certayne portione of fleshe, soe through both the stitches of the needle, passages of the threde, may stifflye be bovvnde together, throughe both the endes of the foresayede threde, layinge betvveen the thredes a little compresse of lether, tvvice, or thrice dubbled, as thick as a little finger, becaus ther through the payne might be praeventede, vvhich through the foresayed stiffe bindinge, might be caused, because the knott, through the continuance of time should not cut throughe the skinne.
VVhen as this ligature is convenietlye done, shee as then is verye certayne, vvhich allso may be done in all partes of the bodye, vvher ther is anye fluxione of bloode, as in greate vvoundes of the Armes, of the Hippes, or of the Throte.
Heere before amongste my Instrumentes of Chyrurgerie, you shall finde them defigurede vnto you.
How we shoulde extirpate, the superfluous, corruptede fingers, separate those which are growen, conioynede together Chap.
THe hande, vvhich is an instrumente, of instrumentes, is dividede in five fingers: And it som+times allso chaunceth, that besydes the thumbe, or the little finger, ther grovveth a sixte finger, vvhich is all carnall, or fleshye, or els composede of some smalle bones: Yet is nether the one nor the other complet, vvhether ye consider ether their figure, or their magnitud, greatnes, as beinge agaynst the course of nature, vvherthroughe they are an impediment to the actiones of the hand.
It may allso vvell chau~ce, the one finger of the hande to be pletterede, vvithout beinge able to keepe the same from Gangraenatione.
Besydes this ther commethe in the endes of the fingers, somtimes a certayn vlceratione, vvhich is callede Panaris, or Paronichia The vvhich cause such vehemente payne, throughe the venoumouse matter, that therthroughe the bone corrupteth, rotteth, yea the inflammatione allso beginneth moste commonlye in the bone: The vvhich to remedye, before that the bone be corruptede, vve muste make an inscision in the end of the finger according to the length therof, begi~ning at the extreameste end of the ioyncte, vnto the bare bone, because the venoumouse matter, vvhich lyeth inclosede betvvene the bone, and the pellicle, vvhich covereth the same, mighte have some or other issve.
The inscisione bei~g done, vve muste suffer it to bleede as longe, till it of it selfe restraygneth stoppeth, the~ thrust the finger in good Aqvavitae, vvherin vve must before dissolve a little Treackle: And if so be notvvithstandi~ge all these remedyes the finger as yet corrupted farther, and must be extirpated, vve may the~ verye aptlye effecte the same vvith our rescindent, or cutting pinsers, vvhervvith, vvithout great payne, vve may vvith, one nipe clippe it of.
Ther are other, vvhich lay the finger on a little blocke of vvoode, as the~ vvith a rasor hevv it of.
On this manner also vve may extirpate the superfluouse finger vvherin ther is anye bone.
And soe farre forth as if the fingers, vveare from the nativitye, and birth, or through combustione, or els throughe anye vlceratione, healed and ioyned together, vve must then vvith a rasor, separate them the one from the other, and accordinge to the length ther of cutt them asunder, and then vvith an exsiccating plaster, being separated cure the~, and soe skinne them, by vvhich meanes every finger vvill separatlye heale.
If soe be that there came anye vlceration in the finger, after the vvhich there follovveth a deformed Cicatrice, vvherthroughe the finger, grovveth croocked: VVe must then trye theron some mollifying remedyes, to cause the finger thervvith to rectifye, grovve straight: And if soe be by noe meanes it vvilbe soe, as it sometimes chaunceth, vvhen the foresayed Cicatrice is great, and inveterated, ether the sinnues, tendones or skinne have binne hurt, vve must not therfore proceede vvith the same as a thinge vvhich is incurable, for if soe be vve cutt, ether the one or the other, the finger therafter should nether be able to bende, nor stretch out, yet is it necessary that the bendinge, proceede before the stretchinge out, and the stretching out, or rectifying of the same, before the recurvatione, soe that he shoulde allvvayes be right, and verye inconvenient, as beinge better that he be reasonable croocked, then right, because of the inconvenience, vvhich ther throughe vve receave: For vve supposinge to shut, close the hande, and to fasten on any thing, this finger as then should stand right out: But vvhe~ it is onlye the skinne vvhich maketh the Cicatrice, throughe the vvhich the finger is recurved, vve must then cleane cutt of the same for as it beinge harde, callouse, can not be throughe the finger erected, and stretched forth.
Havinge therfor novv rectified this finger, by this meanes, vve as the~ make a nve Cicatrice therone, must note that in the generation of the foresayed Cicatrice, the finger doe not chaunce to be agayn recurved, or shrincke vp agayne: to the praeve~ti~g of the vvhich, knovve noe better meanes, after he be cured, that ther one vve vveare a finger case, of lattinne, or of silver, one the plaster, one the combustion.
This fingercase must be covered vvith Taffatye, or vvith anye other decent substance, conveniently, vvith a bande, fastened above on the hande, vvhich fingercase shall doe more commoditye, helpe, the~ all the splintes vvhich vve might applye theron.
Ther happeneth alsoe a dissease, cleane contrarye, vnto all other disseases of the fingers, especiallye in the thumbe, having receaved therone a blovve on the Tendones, vvherby the same is erected, agayne the foresayed Tendones beinge cutt of, can in noe sort be agayne elevated, nether stretched forth, vvherthroughe he lyeth in the hande immoveable, and can not be stirred.
The same chaunceth alsoe in the hande, havinge receaved anye vvounde in the hande one the Tendones, or alsoe above the hande, vvhere throughe the hande hangethe falleth dovvnevvardes, as is she vveare paraliticke, and of her selfe is not able to be lifted vp.
As touchi~g therfore the thumbe, the fingers: vve must ether have a thumbcase, or a finger case vvherthroughe they must be heaved vp: And for the hande, a glove, vvherthroughe the hand may be helde vp. VVhich in the boocke of Mr. Pare, are discribed.
THE EIGHT TREATISE OF THE OPERATIone of Chyrurgerye, wherin is discoursede and handelede of the Cauteryes, and of the Setonne Contayninge five Chapiters.
Of the inventione vse of the Cauteryes, in vvhat disseases, and one vvhat places vve may applye them.
Of the Potentialle Cauteryes, and hovv vve should make them.
On vvhat manner vve ought to applye the Potentialle Cauteryes.
[leaf motif]What a Cauterye is, of the Kindes, differences therof.
HAvinge vvith my selfe resolved purposed, to vvrite so~vvhat, of the Cauteryes, it is first expedient and necessarye that vve knovve, vvhat a Cauterye is, hovve manye kindes, and Species therbe therof: vvhat theire vse is, on vvhat bodyes, on vvhat disseases vve ought to applye them, and the manner hovve vve shall applye the same.
Therfore to vnderstande theire na+ture, vve must first knovve, vvhat vve by the name Cauterium vnderstande: For it may be vnderstoode one tvvo sortes or vvayes, Simplely, and not Simplelye: Symplely, consideringe the instrument, the Causticke matter, vvhich adureth in anye parte, as Galen, in his sixt of the simples in his Chap. describeth: Not because of the signe vvhich remayneth in the Cauterized parte, that is because of the little Vlceratione, vvhich remayneth, therin, vvhen as the Escara is fallen therout: Soe that this vvorde Cauterium, in properlye being vnderstoode, can noe othervvise be vnderstoode, then a little Vlceratione, in anye externall parte of the bodye, vvhich throughe the art of the Chyrurgiane, is made therin, throughe some comburent, adustive medicamentes, to give issve, passage to some certayne matter, of some dissease.
VVherfor the differe~ces, of these Cauteryes, or Vlcerationes, are as it vveare dravvne, from their place, being, vvheron they are applyed, also from theire efficient cause.
The essence, beinge of these Cauteryes, co~sisteth in theire forme, figure, vvherfor some ther are vvhich be rovvnde, some contradictorye, others right, great, smalle, deepe, or not deed: All the vvhich have but one onlye apertio~, or sometimes also tvvo, is the~ called a transforatione, or Seton: And also of all other places, vvheron they may be possiblelye applyed, as on the Heade, in the Necke, Armes, Legges, finally in all partes of the bodye, vvherone they might be applyed, vvhe~ onlye the agilitye, or actione of the parte can not ther through be hindered, or hurte: Of their efficie~t cause, vvhich is take~ out of the diversitye of the matter, vvhich is applyed one anye parte of the bodye, or ingendred in the same.
The matter vvhich continuallye is applyed on the bodye, actuallye combureth, or potentiallye, vvherfore they are called actuall, or potentialle Cauteryes: That vvhich in our body is ingendred, can come through any sharpe, corrodent, or bitinge humors, vvherthroughe the skinne is corroded, bitten throughe, exulcerated, of vvhich vlceratione, may be effected made a Cautery, or fontanelle, vvhich may be called actuall Cauterye.
Heere of vve may coniecture and suppose, that the Cauteryes, fontanelles, vveare invented, follovving nature therin, ther throughe to give passage, to that vvhich is contrary, opposite vnto her, vvherof she is perturbated, molested, it be ether in quallity, or in qvantitye, as heerafter vve vvill farther speake of.
And as touchi~g the Cauteryes, vvhich vve call instrumentes, their principalle, especiall difference, is taken, of theire substance, forme, figure, of theire tarditye slovvnes, or festinatione, of adustion, of theire depth, shallovvnes, of the manner of theire applicatione: touching theire matter, or substance, because they actually, in deede doe combure, burne, or potenciallye, they are therfore called actuall, or potencialle Cauteryes.
The forme of those vvhich actuallye burne is almost innumerable, vvhich are made hott, glovvinge.
The antique auncient Chyrurgians, have commonlye made theire Cauteryes of mettles, as of gould, of siver, of Iron, of copper.
Archigenes hath cauterised the lachrimall fistles vvith liquefacted leade, vvhich through a little pipe he dropped therin.
They vveare of opinion, that the cauteryes of gould caused lesse payne, vveare farre more easyer to be suffered, that alsoe the Cauterized place, shoulde not avoyde soe much matter, and the adustio~ is not soe daungerouse, because gould amongest all other mettles is the moste temperate, vvherfore it burneth not so violently, as Iron, because it is not soe co~densated of sub+stance: vvherfore in like sorte alsoe the Cauteryes vvhich are made of Copper, doe not soe closely burne, or cauterize, as those vvhich are made of Iron, because the copper, is not so solide of matter, vvherfore vve desiring stro~gelye, violentlye to cauterize vve must take such cauteryes, vvhich are made of the conde~sest, most firmest matter, substance.
Somtimes have also the auncie~te professors as Hippocrates, recited, to have cauterized, vvith tentes, vvhich they dipped in ebullient, seethi~ge oyle, or vvith drye incended puffes as vve call them or vvith the root Aristolochiae, being madefyed in seething oyle, or vvith the rootes of Strutium, as Caelius Aurelianus, Dioscorides, and Attilus, vvhich have cauterized vvith incended Goates dunge.
Aetius hath cauterised the corrupted gummes, vvith ebullient oyle, vvhich he applyed theron vvith vvolle beinge therin madefyed.
Albucasis in like sorte, hath cauterized the hollovve, and concavouse teeth vvith seethinge butter.
Guido hath cauterised the bones, vvith liquefacted Brimstone, to vvitt of the Caries.
Soe that out of all these vve may sufficientlye vnderstande, that vve may make as manye sortes of cauteryes, as there are substances, vvhich may be incended.
The foresayed cauteryes, especiallye those, vvhich are made, composed of any mettle, are also differinge in their figures the one from the other: For everye cauterye must be proportioned, accordinge to the dissease, and that vvheron vve vvill apply the same: so that some are like heades of great nayles, triangled, others rovvnde, like vnto a butto~, others cutting, some not dislike vnto a halfe moone, and others circlevvyse: As vve may behoulde, and see, the circles of Albucasis, other in forme of a rapersblade, as Celsus discribeth, ther vvith to cauterize the fissures in the lippes.
They are alsoe differinge the one from the other in theire depthe, or shallovvnes: for vve neede somtimes to cauterize the skinn only, as Hippocrates vvilleth vs to doe, in the paynes of the shoulders: VVe must alsoe sometimes cauterize the fleshe, as in the Sciatica Some times also to the bone, and crushe the same reasonable close thervnto as vve must doe, vvhen as vve must cauterise above on the heade, vve must sometimes cauterize, into the concavity of the bodye, as vvhen vve must cauterise into the brest, to let ther out any matter, somtimes vve doe but only scorche or singe above one the place.
And because that amongest the cauteryes, (considering the matter vvherof they are com+posed) ther be some vvhich are quicly heated) and some vvhich continue longer hott, then others even soe ther are some, vvhich consideringe theire po~derousnes, or levitye, tarditye, or festinatio~, ether in violence, or payn of theire operation, are differinge the one from the other.
The Cauteryes are alsoe differing, in theire numbre, for at somtimes vve applye but one, somtimes tvvo, thre, four, yea alsoe fifteen at one time, as Aetius co~mandeth vs, to the curing of the vlcerations of the Brest.
They differ alsoe in theire manner of applicatione, for some are applyed alone, others in little pipes, vvhich at one ende are aperte, and ope~, or have any appertio~s, or vvindovves in the sydes therof.
Of the Invention, and of the vse of the Cauteryes, and to what disseases, and one what places, they must be applyed.
IT may rightvvell be sayed that nature hath shevved vnto vs, the inventione, of the Cauteryes, fo~tanelles: For as so~times the partes being overlade~ vvith to manye humors ether theire tartnes, or venoumousnes are troubled, they in the end, discharge, vnburthen themselves, in some parte of the body, of that vvhich molesteth the~, as in one of the Armes, or legges, causinge ther to ther solace, and ease, some excoriatione, or apertione.
So that the Physitiones, Chyrurgianes, to helpe heerin the nature, have there throughe fovvnde out the vse of the Cauteryes, Fontanelles, effectinge by their arte, that vvhich nature oftentimes, throughe her ovvne commotione thervnto endevoreth to doe, vvherfore vve alsoe vse the Cauteryes, as oftentimes as vve desire to make any derivatione, revulsione, interceptione, or evacuatione, of anye matter, the vvhich ether consideringe her qvantitye, or qvallitye, or vvith both of them together, might in anye sorte be occasione of any harme.
VVe alsoe vse them, not onlye vvhen as vve desire, to transpire, and cause to evaporate any venoumouse vapours, but also, vvhen vve vvould cause anye concurrent matter to exsiccate, consume, endevoringe to dravve the same from vvithine externally, as vvell through the extractione, vvhich it heer maketh, as through the vlceratio~, vvhich therafter remayneth, as throughe certayn little open fistles, or small ru~ninge issues vvhervvith vve dravv the matter from invvardes, outvvardes, ther to evacuate the same, and cause to digresse from the one place to the other.
Cauteryes are profitable sayeth Galen, Hippocrates, in all corrosive, ambulative vlcerationes, agaynst fluxions of the eyes, in the tumor Aegylops, vvhen as the fore arme, is suncke and discended vnder the Armepittes: In the Sciatica, payne of the hippes, for they retracte dravve backe the humors, vvhich trouble in that place hinder those partes: In the Gangraena in the extirpatione of the me~bres, to stench, stoppe the bloode, soe forth in all fluxions of blood, in all other internal disseases vvhat soever, as in the Consumptione, in vlcerations of the Breste, and in the Dropsye.
Abucasis avoucheth the Cauteryes generallye, to be profitable, in all disseases, and sicknesses, vvhich take their originall, of any matter, or vvithout matter.
They are also profitable, and commodiouse, for all bitinges, stinginges of anye venoumouse creature, in the Carbuncles and Venus botches, becaus through theire heat, they consume the venoumousnes of the humors, annihilate them and out of the depth dravve the~ vpvvardes.
They are alsoe verye profitable, in al criticke Apostemations, vvhich are could, vvaterye, and vvhich are verye slovve in maturatione because that throughe theire caliditye, they opitulate, and helpe to ripen, the could, toughe humors, vvhich are in that parte.
They are alsoe goode, agaynst all corruptione of bones, because they exsiccate the venoumousnes of the same, and consume it, and cause the corrupted bones to separate from the sovvnde.
VVe may applye the~ on all partes of our bodye, and especiallye, beinge needfulle, to make anye apertione, to give issue and passage, to any matter, or vapoure, vvhich therine is assembled.
Ther are some vvhich have applyed the cauteryes one the vpper part of the head, about the sagittal suture, vvher she ioyneth her self vvith the Coronalle suture: VVhich vvith great and good successe have see~ to be done of Mr. Pare, agaynst the Hemicraniam, or payn of the one syde of the heade, and agaynst manye other sortes of inveterated paynes of the heade, because that through such an apeatione, manye and divers humours, vapours, vvhich are congregated in the heade, by this meanes are exhalated: allso agaynst the fallinge sicknes, to give transpiratione to some venoumouse humor, vapoure, vvhich are often times the occasion of this dissease: Agaynst shortnes of breath, and difficultye of breathinge, vvhich have take~ their originall, of the superfluitye of humors, and descende out of the heade dovvnevvardes to the brest ther hinder molest the partes of the brest, and bringe vvith them the shortnes of breath, and oftentimes allsoe are cause of vlceratio~s in the brest through corruptio~, and putrifyinge of some pituitous humours: also in the Ophthalmia, or inflammation of the eyes, vvhich is ther throughe caused, through any fluxio~, vvhich is se~t through the vaynes, vvhich lye scattered in the Pericranio, soe runne to the externall tunickle of the Eye: Agaynst reddnes of the face: Agaynst payne in the teeth, of the Eyes, in the Sqvinancie, in manye other disseases, vvhich come in the mouth, and in the throte.
VVe Cauterize alsoe the Eyeliddes, vvhich are relaxated, in like sorte also the Cilia vvhich sticke in the Eyes, and allso in those vvhich in number are to manye: Alsoe in the Arteryes of the temples of the Heade: The tumefactio~ Aegylops, the Polipus, and Ozena, the cleaved lippes, the Ranula, the Teeth, and the pallate of the mouth vvhen it hangeth to lo~ge, also the Almo~des: The Thorax, or Brest, on divers places, somtimes shallovvly, so~times to the co~cavity of the fores. yed Brest: the inferior parte of the Belly: the Scrotum, or genitalles, especiallye the hippe agaynst the Sciatica the bone, vnder the knees, on the insyde of the legge.
Some ther are vvhich sett five cauteryes one the heade of those vvhich vve suppose to be infected vvith the lazarye.
VVherof vve must set the first cautery, one the Coniunctio~, of the sagitalle suture vvith the Coronalle: The seco~de above the forheade, vvheare the hayre ceaseth: The third in the Necke: The other tvvo the Ossa Petrosa above the eares, somvvhate aftervvarde, tovvarde the end of the Lamdoidalle Suture, to avoyde the end of the temporalle muscle: to vvitt one, one the right syde; an other, on the left syde: All vvhich Cauteryes are applyed, to separate those humors, vvhich cause the nose to exulcerate, and the internalle part of the mouth, in those vvhich have the lazarye, and vvhich externallye have theire face corroded, deformed, fearfull to behoulde.
These Cauteryes are applyed one some, because vve shoulde not see that they have binne cauteriyed, onlye behinde in the necke, and one both the Armes. [leaf motif]Of the Potentialle Cauteryes, how we ought to make them.
THe pote~tiall Cauteryes are those, vvhich through theire intol+lerable, extream heate, being vvith their forces set to vvorke together vvith the benefites of our naturall caliditye, burne as it vveare a fyer in that parte, vvherone they are applyed, leavinge behinde them an Escara, or crust: Of the vvhich the matter of the Corrosive is in great number, and hot, vnto the fourth degree: Amo~gst the vvhich ther ar som, vvhich are extreame hott, a little gentler, accordinge as their operatione is tardive.
Amongst them are numbred, the Cantharides, the Tartre, the common Vitrioll, or the calcined, the vnslissed lims, the Auripigment, the Arsenicvm, the sublimate, the Aqvafortis, the Oyle of Vitriolle vvith more others) the vvhich vve novvadayes, doe seldome vse, in such sorte as they are, vvith out praeparinge, or mixinge of them, to make any Fontanelles, because that experience, hath taught vs some, vvhich are farre more convenient, lesse daungerouse.
The actuall Cauterye, is much convenie~ter· then the Potentiall, vvhether it be vve consider on the nature substa~ce, on the healthfullnes festinatione, and certayntye, in operatione: for the fyer, is a simple element, havinge noe other forces then by the heate therof, exsiccation, vvithout havi~ge associated vnto it anye venoumousnes, vvherfore the operatione therof is festivous, certayne, healthfull, pearcing deeper therine vvhen vve please, vvithout causing anye accidentes in the circumiacent partes, althoughe, that thervvith vve chaunce to touch them, that because of the subtilenes therof, and consideringe the virtues of his substance.
It is an enimye vnto all corruption, vvherfor, it freethe alsoe from all covruptione, putrefactione, yea it consumeth all venoumouse matter, qvallityes, vvhich in that parte might lye occulted, and hidden, consumeth also all superfluouse humidityes, and correcteth alsoe all vntemperate coulde, and moysture.
VVher on the contrarye, the matter, vvherof the Potentiall cauteryes are made, are oftentimes venoumouse: And hovv soever they be praepared, yet ther operatione, actione, is vncertayne, retardate, and slovve, and sometimes alsoe dau~gerouse, vvithout simplye knovvinge the vittues therofe, hovve to limite his operatione: Because somtimes it spreadeth it selfe broader, then our meaninge is it shoulde, and causeth more detriment, and harme in corrosione, then vvillinglye vve vvoulde, it shoulde, because it doth not only combure burne the place vvhereone it is applyed: But beinge vnited, vvith our naturalle caliditye, it extendeth, and pearceth alsoe deeper in the fleshe then is necessarye it shovlde, vvherthroughe that parte beinge by little, and little calefyed, and vvarmed, it imprinteth not onlye one that place his venoumouse nature, but extendeth it self farther, throughe the circumiacent vaynes, Arteryes, Synnues, in the vvorthye partes, spoylinge, oftentimes burninge, the good, vvel disposed complexion of that parte, out of the vvhich commonlye follovve verye badde accidentes, and vlcerations, vvhich therafter verye difficultlye vvilbe cured, yea also some times a Gangraena.
Notvvithstandinge althoughe the Chyrurgians novveadayes, are boulde enoughe in the application of actuall Cauteryes, novvithstandinge most commo~lye they vse the potentialle consideringe the feare, affrightednes, vvhich the Patientes conceave therofe, soe that the actuall Cauteryes are allmost therthroughe relapsede into oblivione: It is right true, that the Potentiall Cauteryes vvhich novve adayes vve vse are indeede of velvet, verye excelle~t, vvhere of never as yet knevve anye badde accident to follovve, throughe the longe vse vvherof, vve have learned the certayntye hovve to make them.
VVe must note, that in the Potentiall Cauteryes, or Ruptoryes, vve adde nothinge, vvhich hath any venoumouse nature or qvallitye: Because they, co~sidering their virtues, are through our naturall calliditye compelled to doe their operation, vvhich by little, little suscitateth, the redormitinge, soporiferouse forces therof, soe that it is not possible, but that of necessitye, this venoumouse nature, must imprint some parcell of her venoumousnes in that parte, if soe be at the least ther be any venoumousnes mixed thervvith: vvherfore most commonlye one this sorte vve praepare it, that immediatlye it might shevve forth his operatione.
VVe make novve adayes Cauteryes in form of Trociskes, of divers ki~des of Ashes, Saultes, limes.
The ashes are made of Oacke~ vvood, of Figgetreevvoode, of VineBranches, of Beanestravve, of Cabbage stalkes, and of Titimallo The saultes are Alcali, Salpeter, Armoniac, Sault of glasse, Vitrioll, Tartare, or Pottashes, vvherof vve, ether of anye partes of the same make lye, out of the vvhich vve extracte a Corrosive sault, vvhich may be made strong, debile, or extreame stronge, and acute, accordinge vvith all that vvhich commeth in the foresayed lye. Amo~gst all Cauteryes vvhich are made that is one of the best, vvhich Mr. Paré, calleth the Cauterye of Velvet, vvhen it is only sodden, made, as it reqvireth to be done: notvvithstandinge it seemed convenient vnto me, heere to discribe certayn other Cauteryes, vvherof my selfe have seene divers goode operations.
Take sault of glasse, Potashes, vnflist lime, of each a povvnde, ashes vvhich are burned of the inveterate sydes of a vvynepipe, tvvo povvnde: Put all these together in a great earthen pott, infuse theron or povvnd of cleere vvater, and let it so stande soackinge
or dayes, or as longe, till one your tunge you feele, the lye to be verye sharpe, and tarte, or vntill that ther may drive an egge theron, vvith a sticke daylye stirringe of the same, and then vve must lett it to clarifye, sincke, vvherof you must defuse the vppermost therof, and ether straygne it throughe a thicke close cloute, or els throughe a Felt, vvithout stirringe of the bottom or foeces therof, of vvhich aeqvall parte, you must ma+ke Trociskes, as heer after vve vvill demonstrate.
Take sault of glasse halfe a povvnd, Sal gemmae six ovvnces, Sublimate vvhich is smally per+fricated, halfe an ovvnce, Ashes of Vinebranches halfe a povvnde, povvnde of common vvater, let all this stande and soacke, as is above sayed, and therof make trociskes, addinge in the end thervnto tvvo dragmes of Opiu~, vvhich is liqvefacted in Aqvavitae.
Take tvvo povvnde of potashes, Saul glass and Sal alcali, of each halfe a povvnd povvnde of common vvater, heerof make a Lixivye, as is above rehearsed, and alsoe make therof Trociskes, An other of Mr. Iaqves de Vile neufve, a great practisioner at Mompeliers, as have in the same cittye seene him make.
Take Sopemakers lye tvvo pounde, Vitriol three ovvnces, Sublimate one ovvnce, make heerof Trociskes addinge in the end thervnto tvvo dragmes of Opium.
VVe may also make goode Lixivye, onlye of Oacke~ ashes, or of Ashes of Vinebranches, vvhe~ as the same is vvel sodde~, vvith potashes, and of Beanestravve, addinge thervnto a little vnslissed lime, vvherof vve may make verye excellent goode Cauteryes.
VVe may in one day make verye goode Cauteries taking therto a povvnde of vnslissed lime, halfe a povvnde of Potashes, Sal alcali pulverizated very smalle, foure ovvnces, commone ashes of vvoode tvvo povvnde, infuse heer in povvnde of common vvater, let it stande soacke three or foure hovvres, then seeth it a little, if you take it to be convenient, and then let it stande purifye, or sincke, and then let is straygne throughe a Felte, heerof you may make goode Cauteryes.
Allthoughe that vve have all these foresayed thinges in a readines, therof to make a lye or lixivye, vnles that you ebulliate your sault, verye short, drye, it vvill as then have noe great forces, vvill qvicklye be liqvefacted, agayn dissolved.
Therfor to seeth a right your lye you shall infuse it in a Basen, let her there seethe, and ebulliat, or evaporate, till such time as shee be verye thicke, like vnto honye, mixe, stirre it vvell together, vvith an iron Spatula, and then the foresayed sault, vvill somtimes present divers colours, as blevve, by little little, vvill grovv thicker, yet not vvithstandinge, vve must yet make greater fyer thervnder, vvith violente flames, as if it vvear a liqvefacti~ge fyer, because the foresayed sault might be melted and liqvefacted, as Butter, chaunged into vvater, of the vvhich you must take a little on your Spatula, lay it on a stone, if soe be it immediatly vvex harde, it is the~ a signe that it is sufficientlye sodden: For if soe be as then you keepe it longer one the fyer it vvill as then burne, agayne be chaunged into ashes, as beinge needfull that there be some humiditye therby to keepe it in his vvonted thicknes: vvhich beinge done, you must then remove your Basen from the fyer, vvith the Spatula, take out the sault, or your Cau+terye therout, vvhilest as yet it be hott, least that it cleave therone to harde, vvherof yon must then make great or little Trociskes, vvhich immediatly you must put, into divers little glasses violles, least that through the ayre they chaunce to be altered, and chaunged, and stoppe the same very close, vse the~ vvhensoever it shall please you.
And to praevent, that the Escara, of the cauteryes, or ruptoryes, be not to harde, a certayne frende of mine for certayntye imparted vnto me, that in the end of the ebullitione of your lixivye, vvhen shee is aboute the thicknes of hony, vve infuse thervnto a little Aquavitae, or spanishe vvyne, or els anye other stronge vvyne, as Malmasye.
And to make them soe, that they shoulde not cause anye great payne, vve must as the~ adde vnto it a little Opium, vvhich is liqvefacted in Aquavitae, but never tryed it.
NOvv therefore condecentlye to applye all cauteryes as vvell actuall, as Potentiall, vvithout expectinge therin anye reproche, vve must first of all co~sider, one those, vvhich are able to tollerate them: In vvhat places they may be best sett, and applyed: one vvhat manner vve may applye them: for commonlye, the vvithered, leane personnes, can not tollerate them, vnles it vveare one the heade, because their bodyes, are nothing els then Membranes, Vaynes, Synnues, vvherthrough so~times greate payn might be caused, or anye vayn, or Artery might chau~ce to be through corroded, one al vvhich thinges vve must note, vvhen as vve must applye anye Cauteryes: vve must also consider, one the nature of the Patient: for a strong grosse bodye as a Labourers, or countrye clovvne, may farre more easyer tollerate, suffer a Cauterye, then a tender delicate bodye, or of a vvoman: nether can anye obdurate parte, as is the skinne of the heade, soe easylye be corroded through, as anye other soft or tender parte, vvherfore vve must houlde the Cauterye longer one the one place, then one the other.
little actuall Cautery, or a little parcell of a pote~tiall Cautery, vvil vvorke as forciblye, one a tender, softe bodye, as a great cauterye vvould doe, one a strong grosse, and obdurate bodye.
If soe be, it be a replete, corpule~t bodye, or an vnhealthsame bodye, vve must then first of al Phlebotomize, or purge the same, because in the cauterized partes ther chau~ce not to come, anye concursione of humors.
VVhen vve desire to applye anye Cauteryes, or make any Fontanelles, vve must consider that vve apply them not one any synnuishe parte, nether on the endes, or beginninges, of any muscles, nether any greate Vayne, Arterye, or Synnue.
VVe applye them most commonlye on the Heade, one the Armes, and one the legges, be+tvvixte all corners of the heade, for the curinge of divers disseases, vvhich heere before vve have recited, the aunciente Chyrurgia~s have made theire choyse of that place, vvhere the Sagittalle suture, ioyneth and vniteth her selfe vvith the Coronalle, vvhich place is like vnto a threfould vvay of the heade: the vvhich plase because vve should not misse of the same, is shevved vnto vs, of Albucasis: To vvitt, that vve cause the Patient, to put forth the one of his handes, and lay the end therof, (vvhich is the vvriste, or be~dinge of the hande) one the originall, beginninge of his Nose, betvveene both his Eyes, and the~ stretch forth his middlemost, or longest finger, tovvardes the crovvne, or superior parte of his heade, one that place vvhere as the foresayed finger shall have his endi~g, ther vve must apply the Cautery, because that ther is the place vvhere the sagitall suture vniteth her selfe vvith the Coronall suture: if so be throughe the applicatio~ of this cauterye, vve desire to doe anye vtilitye, profite, vve must the~ suffer the same to penetrate vnto the bone: for by this me+anes the bone being denudated, it vvill exfoliate, peele, through the vvhich, the apertione continueth the longer open.
VVherfore, divers, after they have applyed the pote~ciall cautery, the next day follovvinge have cutt of the Escara, doe applye theron an actuall cautery, vvithout any daunger, as oftentimes have seene to be done of Mr. Paré.
VVe may applye alsoe cauteryes, of corrosives, in the posterior partes of the Heade, in the end of the suture lambdoide, behind vnder the Eare, therthroughe to avoyde the muscle Crotaphite To the surer findinge of the vvhich place therfore, vve must cause the patiente to ope~, shut his mouth, and soe to feele the motion of the sayed muscle.
Martel chosen, ordinarye Chyrurgian to the kinge, vvhich vvas an experte man, he applyed cauteryes behinde the Eares, in the co~cavity vvhich is situated behinde the little flappe of the Eare, called Fibra, and that agaynst all inveterate disseases of the Eyes, vvherof he certifyed me, to have allvvayes had ominouse and happye successe, vve allsoe sometimes applye the Cauteryes in the Necke, in the hollovvnes, or concavousnes therof, but vve must consider that they doe not penetrate to deep least that vve chaunce to adust, or corrode, the eight small musckles, of the Heade, vvhich are in this place situated, vvhich might cause daungerouse accidentes, as oftentimes have knovvne to chaunce.
The most commonest novve in vse, is to apply the Cauteryes, one the armes, vvhere most curiouslye, vvith greate care vve must make electione of the place: the most fittest place is in the middest of the arm, tovvardes the inner syde therof, right betvvee~ the brachialle musckle, the musckle Biceps close to the syde of the heade vayne.
And convenientlye to make choyse of this place, vve must lay the first finger one that place, stiffelye crushinge the same, vvith the other hande, foulde shutt the elbovve, agayne strech him out, allso lift vp the Arme, because through this motione of the Arme vve might perceave, vvhether there be noe synnue or Tendone situated thervnder, to vvitt vnder your finger, vvhether you finde in that place noe concavity, or interstitiu~ of muscles, vvhich is verye fitt, for a Pease or little pellet to be therine, to keepe open, apert the foresayed Cauterye: havinge novv vvith your finger fovvnde out the most fittest place vve must there applye the Cauterye.
And touchinge the same vvhich vve desire to apply one the legges, the most co~venie~test place ther vnto is tvvo, or thre fingers breadth belovve the knees, vvhere vve are vsed to tye our garters, vvhether it be internallye, or externallye one the legge: But those that are much vsed to ride on horsebacke, also to cause better abscessione of humors, vvherthrough the Sciatica is caused, for the~ it is better to apply them in the externall partes of the legges, in like sorte alsoe for vvoemen.
Havinge therfore vvell, dilligentlye considered on the fittest places, and those vvhich are also the surest, you must the~ first race avvay the hayre, if at the least ther be any.
VVhich being finished, vve must then situate the Patient on a convenient place, beinge helde of some other persone, if soe be it be needfull, the~ you shall take your Cautery, vvhich must be proportioned, fashoned according alsoe vnto that parte vvhich you intende to cauterise, and must be glovvinge, redd hott, or at the least as hott as is required, because your operatione may at one time be finished, if it by anye meanes be possible, vvhich accordinge as shalbe required, you must imprint the same deepe, or shallovve in that parte, consideringe, taking heede, that in noe sorte you chaunce to hurte the circumiacent, or finitimate parte thervnto, to the praeventing vvherof, ther are invented, founde out divers defensions for the foresayed Cautery, as certayn pipes, little cases being composed, and made of Iron, least that vve shoulde chau~ce to combure, the finitimate, approximate partes, vvhether it vveare throughe the faulte of the patient, or els throughe temerousnes, timorousnes of the Chyrurgian, as in other places vve more at large have spoke~ of, alsoe therby have placed the discriptione of the foresayed Cauteryes.
Beinge therfore necessary, oftentimes to reiterate the Cauterye, as in any great Gangraena, or in any Carie of legges, vve must then cover, the approximate places thervnto vvher vve intend to Cauterize, vvith Compresses, beinge madefyed in or anye other humiditye, yea also vestite the edges of the vlcerationes, vvith plasters of Infrigidans Galeni, or els vvith some linnen cloutes, beinge madefyed, and dipped in anye distilled Aquosityes, or vvaters.
Novv beinge sufficientlye Cauterized, vve must then by all meanes indevoure to qualifye ease the payne, and doloure therof, to cause the Escara to separate: vvhich must be effected throughe anye vvarme, and moyst remedyes, vvhich is aequallye proportioned vvith our humiditye, calidity, because through the humiditye, or moyster therof it may soacke through the Escara, and also the finitimate partes therof, vvhich are obdurated, drye, because throughe the caliditye therof, it might suscitate, and dravve vnto him, the naturalle caliditye, out of the internall partes of the body into the externall partes of the same, by this meanes expel that fro~ him vvhich is mortifyed combured.
Amongst all remedyes there is none better, the~ that vvhich is made of Oyle of Egges, of insulsed, and freshe Butter, of Venetiane Terebebentine, addi~g in the end thervnto a little poulder of Ireas, Aristolochiae, and a little Beanemeale, vvherthroughe alsoe all the purulente matter, vvhich hangeth therone as lime, and an Escara is purifyed.
Some vse a Digestive made of yolckes of Egges, of oyle of Roses, of Terebi~tine: But that is not soe necessary, as the formest, because it doth not soe califye, coagulating as the yolcke of an Egge is vvonted to doe, and alsoe immediatlye vvaxeth drye, and exsiccated.
The potentiall Cauterye, vvhich maketh an Escara, or scabbe, being as it vveare a Vicarius, of the actvall, is in this manner follovvinge applyed.
VVe must first of all make a playster, of Diacalcitheos, or some such like, as greate as a large peece of tvvelve pence, in the middest vvher of vve must cut a little hole, as great as the nayle of ones little finger, or a little greater, accordinge to the bignes as vve desire to have the apertione: and if you desire to have the apertion somvvhat longe you must then alsoe make the hole in the plaster somvvhat longe, then lay the same on that place vvhich vve desire to open: And in the hole of the foresayed plaster, vvherthroughe vve perceave the skinn denudated, lay your potenciall Cauterye, or Corrosive, vvhether it be greate, or smalle accordinge as you desire to make the apertion great, or little deepe, or shallovv: VVhich being done, vve must lay thero~, a smalle dubbled clovte, vvhich must be so~vvhat greater the~ the Cautery, thervvith to cover the same, and theron as yet an other playster, vvhich must be a little broader then the firste, and one this plaster an other co~presse, vvhich must be of tvvo fingers breadthe and agayn theron an other vvhich must be yet greather, and then tyinge the same vvith a ligature, acordi~g as the parte shal the~ be requiring.
The Cauterye therfore having done his operatio~, vvhich most commonlye in the space of tvvo hovvres is finished, if so be the sayed cauterye be stronge, violent enoughe, vve must as then take it of: and presently to cause the Escara to separate, vve must make a crossevvise in scisione therin: Other suffer her, of her selfe to separate, vvithout inscisioue: Some inscide her rovvnde, and then lift her vp, so cut her loose from vnder.
But vve desiringe through the application of a Cauterye, to make an apertio~, for the evacuating of any matter, vve must not onlye the~ inscide the foresayed Escara, but also pearce somvvhat deeper therin, vntil such time as vve have sovvnded the matter, to give her passage.
If soe be the Cauterye be applyed to make a fo~tanelle, vve must then cause the Escara throughe the sayed remedves to separate, and keep open the hole, or the foresayed vlceratio~, as greate as the rotunditye of a bullet: to the effectuatinge of vvhich, some vse a great Pease, vvhich throughe the great humiditye vvhervvith shee is soacked svvelleth as thick as bigge agayn, as she vvas before, by the vvhich meanes vve may keep open the apertione, as longe as pleaseth vs: others make little pellets of elder pithe, of Rhabarber, of Agarico, of the blacke neesinge roote, of a Gallenut, of Ge~tian, some of goulde, or of sylver beinge hollovve, concavoyse, but the most convenient, fittest vvhich have experime~ted, are made of vvhyte vvaxe, amongst the vvhich is mixed, verdegriece, Cantharides, hermodactilles, a little auripigment, adding thervnto a little pirosin.
Hubert, Chyrurgiane to the kinge, one of the most expert Chyrurgians of our times.
Touchinge the time, of keepinge open these Fo~tanelles: Celsus teacheth vs, in his fourth boocke and
Chap. that it is oftentimes necessarye for the Chyrurgiane, to exvlcerate the partes of the bodye, vvith a glovvinge Cautery beinge, as it vveare, an aeternall prohibitione, that vve should not suffer such vlceratio~s so quicklye to close agayn, as of themselves they vvoulde, but that vve must sustayn and keepe them apert ope~, till such time as the dissease, vvhich throughe this apertione vve intend to cure, be vvholye finished, and cured.
Of the transforation, or seton, and of the manner how we ought to apply it.
THe transforation, or the Seton, may in tvvo sortes be vnderstoode, properlye, and improperly, vve simplely vnderstand it, co~sidering the threde vvhich vve dravve cleane through the skinne, vvith the needle, vvhich threde in auncie~t time, vvas made of, course hayre, as of horsehayre, or any other such like, vvhich of the latinistes is called Seta But vve novv a dayes make our threde of silcke, of Cotten, or of Course yarne.
Improperly, vve vnderstand by the Seto~, a logestretchinge vlceration, in anye externall parte of the body, vvhich is clean thrust throughe the dubble skinne, and that throughe agilitye, and dexteritye vvith a glovvinge Cauterye.
VVe apply especiallye the transforatio~, or the Seton, in thre partes of the body: to vvitt behinde cleane through the Necke, although some to follovv, the direct concurrence of the fibers, applye the same in the length therofe: In the Navle, and in the Scrotum, vvhen as it is full of matter, ventosity, as it oftentimes is vvonte to happen in the Dropsye.
This transforatione, is vsed, ether for any regressione of humoures, or for an evacuation, or expulsione of the same: For vve applyinge the foresayed transforatione behinde in the necke, it then revelleth, and dravve the backe agayne those humors vvhich concurre tovvardes the Eyes vvith those allsoe vvhich runne tovvarde the Mouth, and the Brest, and retayneth allsoe those humours, vvhich descende, and sinck, behinde in the Backebone, and in the Hippes: He beinge dravven through the Navle, or Scrotum, he then dravveth ther throughe all the Aquositye, and ventositye vvhich is therin contayned.
It is novve adayes also applyed on tvvo manner of vvayes, namelye vvith Pinsers, and vvith an actuall Cauterye, or through the Needle onlye.
The transforation vvhich onlye is layed in the Necke, must be applyed betvvixt the seconde the third Vertebram.
VVhich conveniently to effecte, vve must cause the patient to sit on a little stoole, and least that the transforatione should co~praehend more one the one syde then one the other vve must denotate a line vvith Inck in the middle of his neck, or els on the same parte vvher vve vvill apply the tranforatio~, causing the patie~t to hould his heade on highe, and leene backevvardes over, because therby, the skinne might be the looser, and stretch the farther commaunding then one of the servantes, or standers by, that vvith one of his handes he take hould one the skinn, close by the hayre, as deep as he ca~, ether according the lengthe, or thvvarte over the skinn, follovving the line vvhich theri~ is made, lifti~g the same in the middle on highe, vvhich the~ the Chyrurgian, vvith his lefte hand shall take hould one in the middest of the same, and elevate it, because that he vvith his right hande, vvith a rounde, vvell cuttinge threded needle vvhich must be threded vvith a thicke threde, may thrust cleane throughe the same, the foresayed thred beinge in this sorte thrust therthroughe vve must cutt him of close to the Needle.
But if rather you desired, to effecte the foresayed transforatione vvith a hott Iron, the skinne beinge lift vp on both sydes, through some servant, or through the Chyrurgiane vvith his Pinsers, vvhich he must houlde fast in his left hande, dilligentlye consideringe least he take houlde thervvith of anye Muscles of the Necke, vvhich are situated vnder the foresayed skinne, as to that purpose, intent he must cause the Patient to bende his necke, hould his heade vp, or on highe, right by this meanes to knovve, vvhether anye of the foresayed, Muscles are compraehended of the Pinsers or not.
VVhich beinge done the Chyrurgyane must nipe, shut close together the foresayed pinsers theron applyed, therby to benumme dissipate the senses feeli~g vvhich through the hott iron might be caused, as the~ vvith a tria~gled glovving cautery thrust throughe the hole of the pinsers soe throughe the elevated skinne alsoe: The vvhich foresayed skinne being in this sorte perforated, immediatlye agayn being dravven therout, vvithout suffering the skinn to fal, vve must thrust throughe the perforatione, a needle vvith a thicke dubble threede vvhich threde must be soacked in the remedyes above rehearsed for the Cauteryes, or els at the leaste being made fatt in some Digestive, then the sayed threde being dissected, and cutt of, vve must suffer him to remayne therin, as is above rehearsed, applye therone a Playster of Refrigerans Galeni, for the first or seconde daye, and then a Playster of Betonica.
This foresayed threde, or Seton, vve must suffer it to continue therin, as longe as it shalbe needfull, as vve have sayed of the Fontanelles.
As concerninge the transforation, vvhich in the navle, or in the Scrotu~ may be applyed it vvil be sufficient vvhen vve take the Scrotum, the extreamest end of the navle, so perforate the skinn being doubled, vvith a reasonable greate or grosse needle, vvhich must be threded vvith a vvoollen, cotten, or silcke thred, and applyinge therone, the selfe same remedyes, of the vvhich vve have in the transforatione of the necke rehearsed.
THE NINTHE TREATISE OF THE OPERATIone of Chyrurgerye, wherin is discoursede and handelede of the Ligatures, or vvindinges, circumvolutions, of the convenience or the situation of the partes, Contayning sixe Chapiters.
VVhat the Ligamentes, or Circumvolutiones are, theire matter, qualitye, forme, and quantitye.
Rules, and generall instructions, vvherone vve must consider, in all circumvolutiones, and Ligamentes.
Hovve vve ought to tye the Ligament, and agayne make loose the same.
Hovve vve must ligate, and tye, the broken Armes, Legges, and Hippes.
Of the placinge, and situatione of those partes, one the vvhich the operatione, is set one vvorke. and imployed.
[leaf motif] What the Ligamentes or Circumvolutiones are their matter, quallitye, forme, and quantitye.
HAvinge therfor spoken, treaated of the combinationes, and sutures, vvherthrough al vvou~des, divisione, or separatio~ of the vvhole is inserted combined together agayne, and the lippes or edges of the foresayed vvoundes are kept close together shutt, vve vvil novve treacte, and handle of the Ligamentes, or bindinges, of the vvounded partes vvherin vve ought to consider, vvhat their matter, theire qualitye, forme, quantitye, differences are, hovve vve ought to vvind, and agayne vnvvinde the same.
The vvindinge therfore, or dressinge of a vvounde is nothing els, then a vvindinge aboute, or circumvolution, of the Ligatures, vvhich is as much to say, vvith a broade and longe ligame~t, vvhervvith not onlye, the vvounded parte, butt allsoe the fin itimate, and circumiacent partes, are involved, and circumvestede by this meanes to restore them to theire Former estate, and naturall beinge.
Those Ligame~tes accordinge to the affirmations of auncie~t Chyrurgia~s, are of divers matter, as of Linnen, vvoolle, or Lether: the linnen Ligamentes are the most commonest of all the other, vvhich at that time they vsed, vvhen as they vvoulde stifflye compresse, bringe close together anye parte: they vsed vvoollen rovvlers, in the fractures vvith vvoundes, gentlye in that sort to retayne together the broken bones, to cause noe payne, or inflammatione at all.
Hippocrates vsed the Ligamentes of lether, in the fractures of the Nose, the nethermost chavv bone: But of vvhat matter soever vve make the~ they must not be too much vvorne out, because that they may be stro~ge enough, to be dravvn close together, stretche stifflye out: Farther more they must be even and smoothe, nether must they have any silvages, nether must it have anye harde seames, must be cut aright the threde, accordinge the length of the linnen, not co~tradictorily: because they may tye smoothe and evenlye, vvithout the one syde beinge hardre tyed then the other, as oftentimes it chaunceth, vvhen the rovvler is cutt contradictorryelye: It is right trevve, that the ligature vvhervvithe after Phlebotomye vve tye the arme, yeeldeth it selfe better beinge so cutt, but it chaunceth heerin, because in that place it yeeldeth it selfe better for the bending of the arme.
Touching their qvallity, they must be cleane vvhyte, leaste that throughe their impuritye they be a hinderance, or interruption vnto the parte, because by that meanes they may the better receave the humidityes, as Oxicrate, vvyne, or any such like, vvherin vve chaunce to madifye, vvett them.
They must allso be fine light because throughe their ponderousnes, they doe not overburthen the parte, suscitate, provoke payne, cause infla~mation.
Thirdly they must be softe, flexible because through the obduratnes therof, they might chaunce to hurte that parte.
Fourthlye, of li~nen, vvhich must be verye vvhyte, not to closely vveaved because so they ar more better to be placede, the matter, the evaporationes might the easi+er therthroughe transpire, vvhich being therin occluded, cause infla~matione, itchinge.
Concerning their forme, figure, vve muste knovve, that these foresaede Ligamentes, or rovvlers, are ether rovvled vp, or involved, si~plelye, or dubblelye, vnto the middest of the foresayed ligature of an aeqvalle latitude in all places, as are those vvhich vve vse in the frac+tures of the Armes, Hippes, Legges: In like sorte allso in the vvoundes, vlcerations of the same partes.
The dubble ligament or rovvler is ether of on peece of linnen, on the endes beinge diverselye cutte, or on an other place, in other endes, as are the ligame~ts of the Head, vvhich are cutte into foure, or sixe endes: And in foure endes for the Scrotum Or in the ligament, vvhich is sovved together, made of divers peeces, as are those vvhich are vsed for the flancks, for the Brestes, for the Testicles, for the Fundament, that especiallye vve desiri~ge to spare, be chairye of the linnen.
And as much as concerneth their longitude, latitud that cosisteth on the consideratione, iudgement of the Chyrurgiane, vvhich before hand must see the figure, knovve it, must therby allso be able to knovve, the conformatione, sitvatione of the parte, the diversitye of the dissease: for vvhen as vve are vrgede to make a greate circumvolutione, vve must then consider on the length, make it as long as is reqvired: co~sideringe the breadth, vve must make the~ accordinge to the longitude, latitude of the dissease, so that the foresayde ligament must be greater the~ the dissease, because vvith on circu~volutione doe not onlye involve the vvounde but allso both the endes therof as vvell on the one syde as the other: for if so be the ligamente vveare smalle, he must the~ crushe the dissease, vvherthrough greate payne, and inflammatione might becausede.
And to speake of the qvantitye of the foresayed ligamentes, that is nothinge els then the meane, and measure vvhich vve must vse and observe ether in stifly or loosely bynding, as in respect, of the persone.
For as the one man is grosser more corpulent then the other, so ther are also disseases, vvherof the one is more paynfull then the other, vvherfore vve muste consider, that the ligament be nether too stifly nor loosely tyed, for all ligatures vvhich are too stiflye bovvnde, cause payne, concursione of humors, vvith infla~mations, yea somtimes allso a Gangraena And those ligamentes vvhich are too loose, they are profitable for nothinge, cause that the restauratede partes, vvhich are sitvatede, move therout, as the broken Legges the dislocatede membres, yea allso the lippes of the vvoundes vvhich are insertede, and brought together throughe the loose ligature doe agayne separate the one from the other.
And finallye in one vvorde to conclude, the mediocritye of ligatione, is a greate solace, and comforte to the Patient, as he vvill then vvith his ovvne mouth testifye.
VVe must note that all ligatures muste not in a vvou~d so faste be ligatede, as in a Fracture lesse in a Fracture vvhich is vvithout a vvounde, then in a simple vvounde: VVe must allso harder, more violenter binde ligate on the vulneratede parte, one the fracture, the~ on any of the approximate, nexte adioyni~g partes, therby to repell, drive back agayn the humors, vvhich doe theron sinck and allso crushe out, those vvhich are suncke into the fi+nitimate partes, vvhich is leaste shutte: for in so doinge, vve keepe those partes occludede, liberate, free from all inflammations.
Farther more in the end of the ligatione vve espye a te~der tumefactione, out of vvhich vve may iudge that the parte is reasonablye shutte: if so be the tumor be harde, obduratede, blackishe, it is then a signe that the parte is too stiflye tyed.
And vvheras at all vve perceave anye tumefaction, it is a signe that the ligament is too looselye tyede. [leaf motif]Of the kindes, differences of the ligamentes.
HIppocrates gennerally hath made tvvo sortes of Ligame~ts: vvher of the firste is, that vvhich of it selfe, by his virtues did prosper, opitulate the curinge of the disseases, and vvithout the vvhich they can not be cured becaus that vvith out the same, the parte can not be contaynede in his statione, or forme, vvherin shee must be contayned, to be cured, to be praevented that ther happen noe fluxione vnto the parte, nether the matter beinge therin congregatede, vvithout the sayede ligature coulde not be driven, expellede therout.
As vve may note on the ligamentes, vvhich in the vvoundes of the Heade vve vse, vvhich allso in all concavouse vlcerations vve vse, in Fractures, in dislocatio~s, recurvatione of Ioynctes, in the separatinge of those partes, vvhich agaynst nature lye the one above the other, in the reductione of the separatede partes, in the apertione of the partes, vvhich are to closelye occludede, shutte agaynste the minde of the Chyrurgiane, vvill combine themselves together.
The seconde ligament, is that vvhich is ordaynede, not onlye because of it selfe it is commodiouse, profitable, but Per accidens, bye chaunce, it is but onlye vsed, to contayne, keepe the remedyes, compresses, on the disseasede parte, as on a great, dolorouse inflammatione, on a greate Apostematione, or on any other dolorouse parte.
And touchinge the ligature vvhich of it selfe is profitable, commodiouse, ther of ther are tvvo kindes, vvhich of the vse, vvher vnto they are ordaynede, are taken: vvhich is ether to co~tayne the partes as close in their naturall being because therthroughe they may be combinede vnitede, vvherfore this ligatione is called, the agglutinative, or incarnative ligatione: Or els to praevente, the fluxione vvhich might chau~ce to come to that parte, expell the same therout, vvhich is molestiouse, troublesom vnto him, vvherfore he is called the expulsive, or repellinge ligature.
The incarnative or conglutinating ligation, is commo~ly vsed in this form on the vvounds.
To vvitt, that vve roule vp the rovvler, or ligature on both his endes, vnto the middest therof, vvherof in each ha~de vve must take the one end beinge rovvled vp: laying that parte of the ligame~t vvhich is not rovvled vp, on the other syde of the vvounde, reducinge both the endes of the ligatione, vvhich vve have in our hands above on the vvounde, that ther throughe, vve might adioyne, bringe together, the separated partes, lippes of the vvounde, crossinge the foresayed ligature, in forme of a Burgundiane crosse, or in forme as in the margine is set dovvne vnto you: Then vve must reduce both the endes to the parte, bringinge one end, tovvardes the superiour parte of the membre, be+cause therby the fluxione may be praevented, the other end, on the inferior parte, that the bloode therthrough, vvhich is suncke, and discended into that parte, might be depressed, and crushed out: and the fore sayed Ligature must be of such a breadthe, that vvhen as he is rovvled vp, applyed on the vvounded parte, may not onlye compraehende the vvounde but alsoe both the endes, of the same.
If soe be the vvou~de vveare ample, greate, and the ligature, co~sidering his latitude, coulde not be accommodated, vve must as then compraehende but the one halfe of the vvounde, the other halfe therafter.
Such a Ligament therfore must be reasonable closelye vvounde, but allvvayes a little stiffer one the vvounded parte, as Hippocrates vvilleth vs to doe, yea also, in the vvoundes vvith Fracture, because there throughe might be expressed, and crushed out, the bloode, vvhich in that parte is suncke, least that there shoulde happen anye inflammatione thervnto, then an Apostematione.
The expulsive, or repellinge ligamente, is verye much vsed in Fistles, in concavouse vlcerations, thervvith to expell the matter, vvhich is discending to the grovvnde or bottome of the same, vvhich throughe the longe retentione, internallye corrodeth that part.
This ligature is allso verye commoeiouse in the Varices or bursten vaynes, in tumefacted Legges, but vve may not vse it in Fistles, nor in any concavouse vlcerationes, vnlesse first of all they be putrifyede, their callositye taken therout, nether in inflammationes: This ligamente is imposed, vvith the one end being revolvede, rovvled vp, begi~ning vvith the sovvnde part, vvhich is sitvated close to the bottome of the Sinus, vvhere he muste be somvvhat more dravven together, shutt, then is reduced agayne tovvard the vvounded parte, tovvarde the mouth, or apertion of the concavitye, vvith out bindinge the same to stiffe, consideratione, of the inferiour parte.
As if the Sinus be in the legge, the bottome of the same vnder the Knees, is alsoe higher, hath his issu in the crassitude of the calfe, vve must them beginne to binde, one the Knees, finishe in the inferiore partes therof.
Contrarilye if soe be the inferior parte of the Legge, the issue therof be by the Knees, vve must the~ beginn the ligatio~ by the foote, end the same close to the Knees.
But if vve desire to vse this Ligature in greate Armes, and great Legges, vvhich are Varicouse, vve must then beginne from belovv the legge, or Arme, vpvvardes, vvhich is the most farthest, from the originall of the Vaynes and supernallye end the same, to vvitt, about the Harte, the Liver, vvhich are the originalls of all Vaynes, Arteryes, heerby to repell the humors vvhich are in that parte, to praevent that there concurre noe more vnto that place.
As farre forth therfore, as if that parte be rug+ged, and vnsmoothe, as is that Legge, vvhich is farre more thicker in the Calfe therof, then in the lovvermost partes therof, vve must the~ fro~ palme, to Palmebreadthe, a little more the~ half throughe cutt the same, and fovvlde both sydes co~tradictorilye the one to the other, soe looslye sovve the same, by vvhich meanes the sayed Ligament, is made to be recurvated, and croockedlye vvounde, like a Bovve.
Having therfore stifflye rovvled op this foresayed ligature, or rovvler, vve may thervvith as smoothlye vvind involve a Legge, vvithout makinge, therin anye inaeqvalitye, or furrovves causing that syde vvhich vvas cut of, the~ agayn sovved, aeqvallye to agree vvith the thi~nest parte: the vvhol parte vvhich is the longest, to agree vvith the greatest parte.
Above these tvvo foresayed Kindes, differe~ces of Ligamentes, vve may as yet adde thervnto a thirde Kinde: The vvhich vve call an attractive Ligame~t, vvhich vve may vse vvhen vve desire to retracte, anye bloode, nourishment, or anye other vitall Spirites into that parte, the vvhich, the parte of it selfe can not dravve, attracte vnto it, because her attractive forces are debilitated, very much feebled.
VVe vvill somvvhat alsoe speake of that ligament, vvhich of it selfe is for noe vse profitable but accidentallye cureth, throughe his continua~ce of the remedyes, vvhich are applyed vnto the dissease, vvherfore vve may call it the retentive Ligament: vvherin vve must consider thre especiall thinges.
First in vvhat disseases it is commodious: Secondly on hovve manye fashones, it may be composed, made: Thirdly, lastelye, hovve vve ought to vse the same.
Touchinge the first, vve ether vse the same, consideringe the parte, or the Dissease, vvhich can tollerate noe other: Consideringe the Dissease, as anye vvounde, or vlceratione, accompanied associated, vvith anye great payne, or inflammatione, or vvhen vve disire an Apostematione to be matured: Consideringe the parte, as vvhen a vvounde is in the Heade, in the Necke, in the Bellye, or in the Testicles, vvhich partes ca~ not indur to be stiffly tyed, or bovvnd, therfore neede noe ligatione, but only to retayne the remedyes therone, because that the other stiffe ligatures, bringe vvith them great discommoditye.
Concerninge the seconde poyncte: The retentive Ligame~t, must have tvvo, three, or four endes, accordinge to the forme, situatione of the parte vvhich vve vvoulde dresse.
Touching the thirde poyncte, that must be begunne in the dissease, ended on the other syde of the same.
[leaf motif] Of the Rules, generall Instructions, wheron we must consider, in all Rowles, Ligatures Chap.
THerfore convenientlye, decentlye to vvinde, or involve anye parte, or me~bre, vve must note, co~sider on tvvo especiall thinges, vvherof the first is, the vvounded parte, vvhich vve vvill vvinde: the seconde is the aegritude, or dissease.
Touching therfore the disseased parte, vve take this for a generall Rule, that shee must be tyed, that in such a forme, figure, as vve vvil have her to co~tinue, lye: For if soe be vve vvind a foulded, curvated parte, vvhich therafter must be situated right, and extented, ther vvill as then conseqventlye insue such or the like Accidentes: to vvitt, that the Ligature vvill dissolve, loosen, that ther vvilbe caused great payn, doloure in the parte, because the Muscles, Vaynes, Arteryes Synnues, the verye bones alsoe have an other situatione, beinge erected, extended, then vvhen as they are recurved, and croocked.
As in exa~ple: If soe be a broken Legge, being recurved, soe on that manner be circumligated, vvounde vvhich ought othervvyse to be tyed, beinge stretched extended right forthe, vvithout doubte all the Ligature vvill goe loose, vvhen as vve desire to extende the same, out of the vvhich vvill follovve great payn, because the brocke~ Bones, Vaynes, Arteryes, Synnues, Muscles, doe not as the~ keepe the same place, as they have done, the parte beinge bovvnde, tyed.
Contrarilye, vve desiringe to dresse a fracture in an Arme, he must then be shutt, foulded together, for if soe be vve dresse him beinge extended, vvhe~ as therafter he shalbe recurved bended, then the Bones in therre lyinge, vvith the other partes, be turned into some other fashone, vvherthroughe the Ligature, vvil in one place be loosened, in another spa~ned, vvhich also suscitateth payne in that parte: For it must necessarilye follovve, that vvhen as a tyed parte be chaunged, and then ether shutt bended, or extended, the~ there are some of the Muscles extended, crushed, as in the rotunditye, in the abbreviatione, others vveackened, vnited: And vvhe~ they are exrected, they must needes then be crushed throughe the Ligature, out of the vvhich must necessarily follovve intollerable payne, because of the Compresse, vvhich in ferreth vvith it in that parte great fluxiones, other accidentes, mischaunces.
Novv for as much as co~cerneth the dissease, vve must circumligate, involve an Arme or a broken Legge vvith a vvounde, on an other manner, and fashon, then a Fracture vvith out vvou~de: on an other fashon a Legge, vvhich hath but a simple Vlceratione, then a Legge, vvhich hath a concavouse, or Fistulouse vlceratione: And a Ioyncte vvhich is full of payne, must one an other manner be tyed, then that vvherin is noe payne.
Therfore co~venientlye, decentlye to ligate or vvinde, the Ligature must be right, closely rovvled vp, because vve may houlde him the faster, stedyer in the ha~de, vvithout stirring, or glidinge this vvay or that vvaye, as he might chaunce to doe the same not being stiffly rovvled vp, because that throughe his hardenes he may the better be handled, conduced, so that all ligationes, farre co~venienter, more dece~t to more contentment of the Patient, and the circumstantes, or standers by may be effected, then other vvyse, vvhe~ as the Ligature is layed dubble, croocked, curved, vneven. [leaf motif]Howe we ought to tye the Ligament agayne make loose the same.
THe Chyrurgiane must co~sider, note, that ther be no seames knottes, or anye vnevennes, in the Ligament, vvhich might chau~ce to crushe the vvound: and the Ligatione alsoe being finished, consideringe that the end of the Ligature, be not fastened, one the vvounde, nether one anye place vvher ther is any payne, for vnles vvith a pinne, vve fasten it, or els vvith a Needle sovve it, it allvvayes inferreth payne vvith it: vvherfore vve must faste~ the sayed Ligature, ether higher, or lovver, or one the syde of the same, one the end of the rovvler, one such a place of the Ligature, vvherone the Patient doth not lye, as behinde one the Heade, in the Temples of the Heade, one the Backe, on the Buttockes, nether one the Flanckes, or Armepittes, And concerninge the dissolutione, or vntyinge, therine vve must co~sider tvvo thinges: Namelye one the time, vvhen the Patient must be dressed, one the co~venience of doinge the same: and heerin disagreethe the practise of the aunciente Chyrurgianes, from vs: For touching the dressinge of vvoundes Celsus vvilleth) that vve ought not to dresse the vvou~de, but in thre dayes once, suffering it tvvo dayes· to continue vvithout dressing: And then vvilleth he vs, that vve dresse it but once in five dayes.
And as touchinge the simple fractures, Hippocrates councelleth vs, that in thre dayes once vve dresse the~ But novve adayes, vve doe not observe this ma~nes, for vve dresse the Patie~t after the first dressinge hovvres, vnles vve feared anye greate fluxione of bloode, vvherfore vve suffered the Patient to lye lo~ger vvith out dressing, to vvitt, tvvo, three, foure, or five dayes longe: It is right true, that vve sometimes make loose the ligame~t in tvvo, or three dayes once, vvithout touchinge of the playster, onlye to give ayre to the parte, to note, vvhether there be nether Infla~matione, nor any other Accident come ther vnto: But vvhen as the vvounde is come to verye great suppuratio~, that ther is much matter, payne, or Inflammatione at hande, vve as then dresse the vvounde tvvo, or three times in the space of houres, to vvitt, all eight hovveres once, if it be possible.
And touching the simple Fractures, vve keep the~ sometimes, sixe, or seaven dayes vndressed, vnles that ther vveare anye Accidentes, at ha~d, but allvvayes vve tarrye as longe as is possible: for hovv little soever vve touch a broke~ legge, the endes of the bones, of the fracture are neverthelesse, stirred, dislocated, the on rubbed agaynst the other, vvherthroughe is caused payne, and the combinatione, or together healinge is hindered, because that all conglutinatione, can not be vvith out co~tinuall coniunctione of the one parte vvith the other.
The redressinge, or dressinge, must be done one this manner: to vvitt, that vve easilye make loose the bande, or rovvler, novv vvith the one hande and then vvith the other looseninge of the same, alvvayes houldinge the vvhole Ligament in the hande.
But because most commo~lye the first dressinge of the vvounde, cleaveth soe fast, as if vvith glevve it vveare theron fastened, because of the bloode matter, vvhich is therone dryed, and baked, vve must first of all therfore, madefye, moysten the same vvith a little vvarmed vvyne, and thervvith soacke the same because the ligament may be taken, revolved therof vvithout payne, yea or els also in the vvindinge of, of the same comming on the vvounde, vve might ther everye time cutt it of, because in soe doing, vve might by peecemeale take avvay the same, vvithout in any sorte hurtinge of the Patient. [leaf motif]How we shall dresse the broken Armes, hippes, and legges.
AL thoughe that our common practise, of the dressinge of all broken Legges, seemeth to be alienate, and to differ, from the manner of doinge, of the antique, auncient professors, Chyrurgia~s, it is notvvithstanding in such sorte, that vve easyly can compare them together.
All the auncient physitions, Chyrurgianes, have binne of opinio~ that in the Fractures vve ought to vse a dubble kinde of Ligament: Namelye inferiore ligamentes, vvhich they called Hypodesmidas, superior ligatures, vvhich they called Hypodesmous they have these names because of their situatione, because some of them are tyed, and bovvnd vnder some agayn above.
And as touchinge the inferioure ligame~tes, Hippocrates maketh mention of tvvo sortes.
VVherof the first, the shortest, beginneth one the fracture, layinge alvvayes the one end contradictorilye therone because it should not vvholy lye, on the place of the payn, vvhich ligament must be tyed round about the fracture, then be reduced vpvvardes, vvhere he as the~ endeth: This ligament must closelye be vvounde together, because so the fluxio~, vvhich might chau~ce to sincke into the disseased parte, might the better be kept therout.
The seconde ligament, vvhich allmost, must be as longe agayne as the first, is allso begunne one the same manner, to vvitt, on the fracture, layinge onlye therone, a turne, or tvvo, vvinding dovvnevvardes, to crushe therout the bloode vvhich might chaunce to sincke into the fracture, vvith circumvolutio~s, vvhich must be layed a little more a parte the one fro~ the other, then in the first ligament they vveare: for vve must take heede of makinge to greate expressiones of bloode, in the endes of the Armes, or legges, that vvithout imflammatio~ they can not receave much therof, and the ligament being come dovvne, must vvinde the same vpvvardes agayne, to come agayn to that place vvher vve did beginn, because both these ligamentes might hould fast, and the muscles be brought into theire naturall situation, vvhich through the tvvo formost ligationes might be brought therout.
Other auncient Chyrurgianes make of this nethermost ligature, tvvo ligationes, vvherof the one is the surest the seconde for the fractures, vvhich beginneth one the broke~ parte: having therafter, made one, or tvvo circumvolutiones, then is the foresaved ligature reduced dovvnevvardes.
The other vvhich may be the thirde for the fractures, must be begunne, on the beginning of the parte, endinge supernally vvher the first ligatio~ is ended passing over the Fracture: Soe that they impose therone thre ligationes all vvhich three vve may call inferior ligame~tes.
The first vvhich ascendeth from the fracture one highe, as from the middle of the legge tovvarde the knee.
The seconde vvhich desce~deth from the fracture dovvnevvardes, as from the middle of the legg tovvardes the foote.
The third, vvhich from the extreameste part of the Ioyncte, ascendeth superiorlye as fro~ the the soule of the foote tovvardes the knees.
But novveadayes folovving our common practise, vvhich vve vse before these three ligamentes, vve applye first of all, one the place of the fracture an astringent Plaster, vvhich is made of Bolus, of flovver, or volatill meale, of vvhytes of Egges, of Oyle of Roses of a little Terebentine, (in steade of Cerotu~ Galeni, vvhich the auncie~t Chyrurgians vsed:) After the first dressing vve vse the Plaster of Diacalcitheos, or of Diapalma, liquefacted in oyle of Roses, vvith vineger.
The ligature novv being dece~tly vvou~d, because the legges, the hippes the Armes, are thinner belovve then above they are, vve must therfore one such slendernes apply some certayn co~presses because the foresayed ioyncte may be in all places of an aequall crassitude, thickenes, the splinter, vvhich must be made of stiffe paper, of lattinn, or of any other substance, be verye evenlye, smoothlye applyed therone, tyed vnder the inferior ligatures, or rovvlers.
These splinters must be three in numbre, vvhich must be excavated like a gutter, vvherof the first must be a little broader, then the other to by applyed vnder the fracture, to compraehende all that, vvhich is belovve the fracture, be as it vveare a fundament, or foundatio~ thervnto.
The other tvvo one both the sydes of the fracture, being somvvhat separated the one fro~ the other, least that in the ligatio~ they chau~ced to glide the one over the other.
They must also be of such a longitude, as the broken parte requireth.
These thre foresayed splintes being thus imposed, one the inferior rovvlers, vve must then tye the fracture that it may lye fast and steadye the part be co~tayned in a goode quallitye disposione.
VVith the first of these tvvo ligatures, vve must beginn, at the extreamest parte of the membre, fro~ vnder vpvvardes.
The seconde must beginn fro~ above end belovv: vve must allsoe note that the one of those rovvlers, must take his beginninge internally in the membre, must proceed from the left to the right syde, becaus they may crosse the one over the other, in such a forme as in the margine you may see, or in forme of a St. Andrevves Crosse, because it may be involved verye closelye theron.
It seemeth that Hippocrates hath vsed noe other ligature, in the Fractures vvith vvounde, but that he rovvled the same somvvhat loose.
But in those fractures vvhich vveare shott, or vvith anye other such like instrument, or engine, be done, vvherin is great crushinge of bones, because vve should little neede to handle this parte, vvhich is thus broken, and crushed, least the acute, and sharpe ossicles, or bones, frustles, the vvhich in the pertractatione of the same, might chaunce to pricke the Flohe, Te~dones, Synnues the Peritoneum, vve must ther fore vse heervnto great Co~presses, beinge foulded three, or foure on the other, and soe sovved together in the midle, beinge in tvvo places cut throughe, the compresse beinge of the bredth of a palme, of ones ha~de, or theraboute, vvhich vve revolve the one tovvardes the other parte, as if vve desired to circumligate the parte.
These, or such like Compresses, vve must by little little shove vnder the crushed parte, or me~bre: the same being immu~difyed, impure, and vve desire to lay an other thervnder, vve as then sovve a cleane vvhite Compresse, one the impured Compresse, as then vve dravv avvay the impure compresse from vnder the Fracture then subseqve~tly follovveth the mundifyed, cleane compresse thervnder, in the steade of the immundifyed.
have constituted the defiguratione, of these Compresses, heere before amongest the figures of the Instrumentes, in the table of the Glossocomium, vvhich of Hippocratis is called Ambi, on vvhich place, in the forsayed leafe, is defigured vnto you, a broken legge, vvith the Ligamentes of the same.
Of the situation, and of the constitutione or collocatione of those partes, one the which the forsayed Operatione must be effected.
NOe man is ignora~t, hovv necessarye, requisite these operationes are, to the resanatio~, of the disseases, vvhervvith ma~s body is daylye, continually oppugned opressed: and indeed, this operation shoulde in vayn be vsed, if so be that not onlye the vvhole body, but also the forsayed disseased partes, vvhero~ vve effecte our Operation, vveare not therafter, constituted situated, and vvith most convenience collocated.
Therfore decentlye, vvith most couvenience to collocate the same, the Patie~t must first of all lye on his bedde, (if soe be at the least the magnitude, and largenes of the dissease require the same,) that in such a form, that the vvou~ded, or vulnerated parte; may be vvith most ease, co~venie~ce collocated, as it is reqvisite, for they are not al together situated in one fasho~, manner: It is right true, that there are some certayne rules, as are in the ligatures, vvhich must only be vsed one disseases.
First of al therfore, generally, to collocate rightlye situate al vvounded partes, vve must consider thre especiall thinges: to vvitt, that the situation, be Softe, Smooth Highe: Softe, because a hard situatio~, somtimes might chaunce to disturbe, and irrequiate, not only the vulnerated part, but also the approximate partes ther vnto, by the vvhich meanes great payn, inflammation, consequentlye also an attractione, a fluxion must necessarily follovve in that parte: vvhich is more, the Patient is constrayned not being able to tollerate the obdurate collocatio~, to ease and yeelde solace to that parte, by oftentimes turninge, and revertinge of himselfe, vvhich is very vnprofitable for him, because that parte, requireth nothinge els then quietude, vvithout beinge much disturbed, and molested.
Even, and smooth, becavse that the vneve~, implanitude collocation, inferreth payn recurvatio~ in the Ioyncte, to vvitt, the one parte resting on somvvhat, the other parte, dependinge vvithout restinge one anye thinge.
On Highe, because that therbye, al concursione of humors is praevented, vvhich othervvise through the lovv situatio~ of the Iovncte, might be therthervvardes dravvne.
Considering this occasion, have the Chyrurgians alvvayes caused the broken or vvounded Arme to be dependently vvorne one the breste the legg to be collocated on highe, to vvit so~vvhat higher then the bodye, the Patient lyinge on bedde, because he may nether be erected, nor sitt.
Nether is it onlye necessarye that the membre, or parte be collocated softlye, smoothly, highlye, but it is also requisite, (if soe be ther be anye vvounde, or vlceration, vvhich especially is fistulouse) that the apertio~ therof, if so be it is possible, recurvate it selfe dovvnevvardes, because that the matter, might have the liberater a passage, to enter forth at, vvithout makinge any greater co~cavityes, doe not chaunce to ince~ce, or inflame the approximate partes, nether to corrode them, vvhich vvould bringe vvith it divers, sundry accidentes: praeposterate the resanatione of the same.
Secondarilye, the Ioyncte must be situated in such a forme, and fashone, vvhich is agreinge vvith the naturalle disposione of the Ioyncte, and alienated from all payne: vvhich tvvo observationes, are vvell agreinge the one vvith the other: For all fashons vvhich cause noe payne, that is the naturalle, and accustomed figure, and collocatione therof: Euen as the paynefull, and vnnaccustomed figure is agaynst nature, so that the naturall, and accustomed figure, or fasho~, is vvholy vvithout payn: vvhich happeninge, the Patient must a longe continuance keepe his Ioyncte in that beinge, because soe he shall feele noe, or at the least verye small payne at all vvhich is verye co~modiouse, to the resanation of all vvoundes, vlceratio~s, Fractures also for all dislocatio~s, as it is in like sort profitable for all other disseases vvhatsoever, The aunciente Chyrurgians, have called, this forme of situatione, the right and true collocatione, because all the Vaynes, Arteryes, Synnues, muscles, as then are right, nether are they extended, nether lye they recurved.
And althoughe that the Arme have binn anglevvyse collocated, notvvithsta~ding vve esteeme it as then to lye right, because that all the foresayed partes, are accounted to lye right, not extended, nether recurved, that this collocation of the Arme is naturalle, as heere after vve vvill more largelye speake of.
And by degrees to specifye, the situatione of each, sundry parte, vve vvil heere discribe some of them for an example: vvhe~ as ther is any vvounde, Apostemation, or dislocation in any Ioyncte, vve must then vvith all dilligence note the situation there of: for through a badde situatione, not onlye immediatly are caused many accidentes, but after the sanatione therof, the Ioynct sometimes tarryeth right out extended, vvhich ought to have binne croocked, or els abideth croocked vvher it oughte to be exte~ded or els combineth it selfe, ioyneth vvith some other thinge, vvhich ought to have binn separated, seioyncte.
VVherfore if the vvounde be in the vppermost parte of the shoulder, vve must then impose vnder the Armepites of the Patient, a great linne~ balle, hange the arme one the Brest, somvvhat beare, out his elbovve, because that the heade of the arme, may be somvvhat elevated, the separated partes, may agayne be inserted the one vvith the other and so much the better be cured together agayne: The contrarye vvherof must be observed, if soe be that in the inferior parte be anye vvounde, as vnder the Armepittes: for the vvound beinge cured, vve doe not lift vp somtimes, the Arme let him fall dovvne agayn, stirre him othervvayes, vvithout causinge any payne, and that the Arme is not helde from the Breste, the Patient therafter, because of the Cicatrice shall not be able to lift vp his Arme because through the same the Arme is grovven stiffe.
As therof vve have an example, exemplifyed vnto vs of the throte, in the Necke also of many and divers, vvhich beinge vvounded, or burned, the cicatrice hath remayned so obdurated, that they ther through have ether helde their Heades, to much on high or to much stoupinge, or ha~ging backvvarde, or to much dependinge ether on the right, or one the Leftsyde.
If so be that ther be an Apostemation, in the Elbovve, or els that the same be dislocated, or vvounded, vve must the~ situat the Elbovve angle, or cornervvyse: for such aforme is very necessarye for the same, natural, accustomed vnto hi~: although, the cornervvyse figure is that vvhich maketh an accute corner, notvvith+sta~ding vve meane therby through the anguled figure· vvith the auncient Chyrurgians, that vvhich hath his corner right but yet not so cleane, and vvholy erected, but that vvhich attaygneth somvvhat tovvard the rectitude, so that it commeth somvvhat bluntlye, and such a figure is not as yet truelye the meane, betvveene the inflexione, and the extensione, but is the same vvhich yeeldeth her selfe, tovvarde the extensione: If soe be the Arme be inserted and combined, vvith being able to be recurved, or exte~ded vve may yet as then better, and vvith more facilitye helpe him selfe, then if he vveare vvholye recurved, or vvholye extended.
VVe may alsoe observe the same in the hande, for vve must keepe the fingers shutt, halfe bended, and if soe be the dissease vveare in one finger only, it vveare then better that the same continued ether inflected, or incurved, the~ that he vveare strayght, for the property of the hande is to gripe and take houlde, the vvhich shee can not effecte, and bringe to passe, then throughe the recurvatione of the same.
If soe be above in the Hippe ther chaunce to come, an Apostemation, or vvovnde, vve must then in the consolidatinge of the same, observe that vvhich in the shoulder vve have seene, as beinge necessarye to stirre the foresayed parte, on divers fashons, because the heade of the bone, doe not insert it selfe, and grovve fast in the panne.
VVe observe in the Ioyncture of the knees the contrarye, for if so be, that ther be a vvounde, or an Apostemation, or els in the finitimate parte, the Patie~t must the~ hould his legge right, vvithout havinge the heeles dravven in tovvardes his buttockes, as it in divers persons happeneth, and that to the hinderance of the Patientes, vvhen they are cured.
And vve must dilligentlye note, that the legge be collocated as right, as is possible, and if so be by chaunce it laye recurved, vve must then as gentlelye, as is possible stretche and extende the same agayne, othervvyse the patient beinge cured, might chaunce to be mutilate, and vvithout greate indecoru~, or deformity should not be able to goe, as vve have knovvene the sa+me to happe~ vnto tvvo great personages, of our times.
Novv as concerninge the foote, the Toes, they must allsoe be extended, and not recurved, or inflected, as vve have spoken of the ha~d, fingers: For if soe be they co~tinued soe crooc+ked, the bodye as then shoulde not be able to rest, or stayede theron: Soe that the situation of the Arme, is co~trarye to the Hande, to the Legge, and to the Foote: because the one must be recurvede, or croocked, and the other extended right out.
The end of the Frenche Chyrurgerye, contayninge the manuall Operations.
Methodicalle discourse, or rehearsall, of the Originalles, occasiones, Signes, Tokens, Accidentes, chaunces, Prognosticationes, and Remedyes, agaynst the Bloodyeflixe, or Dysenterye.
BY all other miserable and pitifulle disseases vvhich doe com+monlye vexe, and trouble the Entralles, and runne through the same, as is the Cholicke, the restrictione, or constipatione, Ileus, Lyenteria, Diarrhea, Tenasmus, the vvormes, many other such like yet me thincketh the Dysenteria, or the Bloodye flixe, of all these to be most intollerable, and most mortall: And also amongst the Commonaltye, amongst our Frenche Martiallistes or vvorriours, amongst the Svvitsers, Countryemen, Englishemen, farther amongst all sortes, and Kindes of vvarriours, it is soe commo~, that it seemeth this dissease, as soon as they are gone out of their houses, that there nothinge els follovveth them, the~ the shaddovv of their body, vvherthrough in all leagers throughe this dessease at sometimes ther are more poeple deprived of their lives, then throughe all the inqvietude, through all povertye, throughe the Plague, yea more alsoe then of the enimye are Killede: And touchinge my opinione heerein, take this sickenes to be a pestilentialle spirit, and a certayne essence of the Plague: Soe that necessarilye ther vnder must be occulted, hidden, a secreate, ineffable venoume, or poyson, vvhich through defilinge, and infectione, spreadeth it selfe from the one bodye into the other, Because the intestines or entralles, of a sovvnde, and vvelfaring man, throughe some inclinatione, or Sympathye, are made partakers of such venoumouse vapours, of him vvhose guttes are polluted vvith this dissease, and by that meanes also are imparted vvith the bloodyeflixe: As in the co~sumptione vve may see, vvhich proceedeth out of some vlceratione of the Lunges, and also in the Ophthalmye of the Eyes, the same to be as infectiouse, that the on body, may obtayne the same of an other: VVhich commeth to passe, as Aristotle sayeth, because that the Lunges, the Eyes, are continuallye contayned in a perpetualle motion, vvherthrough the venoumousnes is the easyer imparted to an other body: Health beinge, as it vveare a continuall rest, and an assured estate.
And as the entralles, have also their perpetualle motione, the vvhich in Greeke vve call Peristaltica, in like sorte alsoe may they imparte theire dissease vnto other entralles, as the eyes vnto the eyes and the Lunges doe vnto the lunges.
Of the Causes, Signes, Accidentes, prognosticationes, and remedyes, vvill somvvhat discourse, consideringe more the necessitye therof, therby to instructe the yonge Chyrvrgian, the~ because of any pleasure, vvhich take therin, or anye ostentatione.
The Dysenteria, or bloodyeflixe, is a sangvinolent excrement of the Bellye, vvith greate doloure, and as it vveare scissure vvhich the Latinistes, call Tormina And this dissease may be taken properlye, or improperlye.
The improper Dysenteria, or Bloodyeflixe, is a fluxione of bloode, vvith out any greate paynes, or travayle, vvherof ther are tvvo sortes, or Kindes, ether vvhen vve avoyde pure, cleane blood, vvhich vve call Sangvinolenta, Cruenta or els vvhen vve avoyde vncleane bloode, and impure.
The pure cleare bloode issveth forth of the Mesenterium, vvheare a longe time it hath lyen occulted, co~gregated, as it oftentimes chaunced, in those vvhich are grosse of Belly.
And sometimes alsoe it procedeth out of the Liver, of the Milte, of the Hemorrhodes, and sometimes also out of some great vaynes, and out of other partes, yea and also out of the vvhole habitude of the bodye: All vvhich differe~ces, must throughe their ovvne signes be knovvne, because the resanatione of the same may be the surer.
As for example it happeneth commonlye, throughe anye greate superfluitye of bleeding, in those vvhich have lost an Arme, or a legge, that on certayne times they have the bloodye+flixe· In vvhich kinde of Mysenteria, vve neede not much to feare, nether neede vve to vse those remedyes heervnder discribed: But must restraygne such Patientes, from great comestiones, and superfluouse drinckinge of VVyne, and cause him to be vvell phlebotomised: vvherof vve in this place endevoure to advertice, and instructe the yonge Chyrurgiane, be,cause that vvithout making any great delaye, he might be adiuvable helpefull to the patient vvith these remedyes vvhich consequently follovve: the vvhich in passinge by, it seemed convenient vnto me to rehearse: Because it is not my intent, in this place, onlye to speake, of the improper Dysenteria, curatione therof, but of the true, proper bloodyeflixe, or Dysenteria, vvhich in all Leagers is common, familiare, and infectiouse.
The impure Bloodyeflixe, is the truest, assuredst, and is assimilated vnto vvater, vvherin nue slaughtered fleshe, hath binn vvashed: the vvaterye Bloodyeflixe, is called Fluxus Hepaticus, the Liver laske, vvhich is caused, throughe the imbicillitye, of the retentive forces of the liver, through the vvhich the vitall spirites the naturalle calliditye doe exhalate, the personne, is vvholye bereft of all his forces therthroughe also the stomacke is feebled, that it can not any more compraehend, any meate, or drincke, to feede one, nether digest the same, soe that by this meanes the vvhole bodye consumeth and vvithereth.
The black, heavye, thick bloodyeflixe, proceedeth especially out of the Milte, vvhich is, as it vveare a Poole, or receptacte, of al melancholicke, thicke, and blackebloode.
But that vvhich properly, or vprightly is called Dysenteria, or Bloodyeflixe, that is a commo~ vlceration of the entralles, out of vvhich first of all the viscositye of the same is driven, expelled out, then the Axvngiousenes therofe, vvith a little redde blood intermingled: Thirdly, the internalle membrane of the intestines, of the vvhich the pellicles, and the little fibres are in the stooles seen, thervnder to be mixed: finallye the vlcerrtio~ as yet proceeding, more, more grovving vvorse, as the~ consequently follovveth the carnositye, the verye substance, of the corroded, corrupted guttes: all vvhich ki~des, are acco~panied, associated vvith those co~mon accidentes, to vvitt, vvith bitinge, or mordicante payn, vvith continuall punctio~s, vvith continualle concupiscence of goinge to stoole, vvith intollerabilitye, vvith a continuall co~motio~.
VVhich foresayed Dysenteria, or Bloodyeflixe, ether happeneth to the small entralles or to the great intestines, the vvhich vve first espye out of the situatione of the payne, out of the diversitye, and mixture of the matter, VVhen as therfore the vpright Bloodyeflixe is in the smalle guttes, as then vve see blood, certayne membranouse pellicles, intermixed vvith the excrementes, ther is also great payn above on the Navle the time betvvixte the payn the deiection is slovve, and ther associateth it most commonlye a vomitinge, and a greate oppressione of the harte, and the Hick coughe, in the entrance of the stomacke, through community vvhich the forsayed entralles have ther+vvith: For as Galen sayeth, the Harmony, coniunctione, vvhich the partes of the bodye have the one vvith the other, is vvonderfull, to be admired, because as soone as the actione of one parte is hindered, or suffereth any thinge, al the other partes of the body doe thervvithe co~spire, and sympathise.
If soe be the sayed vlceratio~ be in the greate guttes, or entralles, ther as the~ driveth one the deiectiones, or excrementes certayne droppes of bloode, and some little parcels of fleshe, and the dolour of the vvounded, or hurte entralies, not so pungent and sharp, but somvvhat more surde, and benumde.
The occasione of the bloodyeflixe is the venoumouse puissance and force, Dynamis of the acute, saulte, and mordicant humoures, vvhich beinge as it vveare on the iournye, to descende right to the guttes, but they come recurvared, in form of this lettre S. as in the situatione, they must passe by manye recurvationes, co~cavityes· vvher they cleaving fast, first of al crudifye, and excoriate the foresayed guttes, in the end throughe theire acuitye corrode the same: as is the cholericke humiditye, the melancholycke humors, and the saulte Petuita, the vvhich is ether inge~dred internally in the guttes, or els congregate together in other place are soe driven that vvay, as it happeneth commonlye in the Pestilentialle agues, in Causo colliqvanti, Phthisi, Athrophia, in the Cacochimia, in the inflammatione, and in the colliquation, of the vvorthyest partes.
The humors are also irritated, and provoacked, through causticke and venoumouse medicamentes, as throughe the Coloquintida Scammonia, or throughe the Sublimated poulder of a Diamante.
Also through anye viciouse, acute grosse cibaryes and those vvhich are apte vnto corruptione, or els is not sufficientlye dressed: Alsoe throughe any fruicte, as by cherryes, Blackecherryes, Plumbes, Peatches, Coucoumbres, Milions, such like, vvhich vve call Hotatij Fructus, vvhich more, throughe the constitutione of the ayre, vvhich ether is to moyste, and pluviouse, or raynye, to coulde, or to hott, in others through intemperature, and other inordinate victitatione, or debacchatione, by the vvhich it inseparablelye happeneth as vvell in the VVinter, as in the Summer, that this dissease of the bloodyeflixe, afflicteth man kinde.
It is right true, that this dissease, oftentimes reagneth in the Prime, or vernall time of the yeare, and especially in the Harvest, or Autumne, in the vvhich time the humors, doe most impeach, hurt vs vvith the qvallityes.
Havinge observed all these thinges, vve must consider one the quantitye and quallitye of the dissease, as on the greatnes of the vlceratio~, and the superfluitye of bloode, and one the greate corrosione, and one the violence of the dissease, therbye to iudge, vvhether the dissease vvith anye facilitye, difficulty, or impossibilitye may be repelled, and cured.
VVe esteeme the cure of the Dysenterya to be of more facilitye, the same beinge in the great guttes, or intestines Caecum, Colon, Rectum, the~ it being in the smalle entralles, Duodenum, Ieiunum and Ileum.
VVe take also the same to be lesse daungerouse, in yonge persons, and in the men, then in yonge children, and vvoemen.
In a longevalle, or longe continuing Dysenterye, it is a badde signe vvhe~ the appetite is departed, yet a farre more vvorse signe, vvhe~ as ther are associated vnto the same Agues, or Imflammationes.
As is that vvhich is caused, out of anye Apostemation, beinge burst out of the Liver, or of the Milte, vvhich verye rarelye happeneth, and yet more rare out of the pulmonicalle Apostemationes, vvherof the matter disgorgeth it selfe in the left ventricle of the Harte, and soe into the Artery called Aorta, the truncke, or body of all other Arteryes, fro~ thence into the Vaynes of the Mesentery, vvhich are exte~ded to the entralles, the vvhich passage or vvay vve can not then throughe imagination compraehend, and vvhich is very obscure.
And if soe be ther follovved any peculiare thinge therout, besides the causticke, and venoumouse matter it might the~ inferre fearefull, daungerouse accidentes, to the hart of the Patie~t, (vvhich is the vvelspring of lyfe) the onlye originall, of vitall spirites, vvhich are diffused over the vvhole body, are occasione of the actione, motione, also all other agilityes of the bodye.
The evomitio~ of the choloricke humors, in the beginning of the dissease, doe beare vvitnes alsoe of the daunger follovvinge.
The bloody flixe, vvhich is caused out of any mela~cholicke humors, is esteemed to be vvithout anye hope.
The convulsio~ of synnues, the Hickough, the parbraking, are forerunners, as it vveare, embassadoures of death.
In like sorte allsoe vvhen vve espye, a blacke spott behinde the left eare, as bigge as a Vetche, vvherbye is great alteratione, that allso is a signe of Death, as Hippocrates vvithnesseth vnto vs.
If soe be this dissease, through neglige~ce, or through malice, or aulteration, or by any other meanes, came to be inveterated, the Patient as then vvill vvholye consume, vvexe so feeble, that vvithout great difficultye he shall not be victor therof.
This therfor is the cause, or occasio~, the species, kindes of this dissease, the afflicted, opressed parte beinge aperte, and knovvne, vve must novv proceede to the resanatione of the same.
The finall end of the curatione, is ether generalle, or specialle.
The generall end is to be noted, ether on the dissease, or on the Physitione, as on both the especiallist, most principall personages, vvhich acte and sett forth the Historye of this dissease.
In all the kindes of Dysenteria, the patient must keepe himselfe reposed, and quiet, because all vlcerationes, desire to be quietlye kepte, and in ease: Notvvithstandinge, Hippocrates in his third boocke de Diaeta councelleth, that vve shoulde cause the Patient vvhich hath the bloodye flixe to vvalke, alsoe cause him to stirre his bodye, vvherby he meaneth, that vve ought to doe the same, before the foresayed Dysenteria become, because of the Prophylactica, therthroughe to prevent, the procreatio~ of all badde humors, to defend the same out of the intestines, cause them to vvithdravve themselves into other externall partes of the bodye.
Farthermore the patient must allvvayes retayne his stooles as longe as he possibly may or can, vvithout constraygninge himselfe thervnto, The Chyrurgian must first of al consider on the vse of the astringent medicamentes, vvhich before repast, or comestion are vsed: for he co~tayninge the viandes, or cibaryes, they helpe also to the digestio~ of the same: but by the astringent thinges vnderstande, meane, vvhich are reasonablelye fortifyinge, and confortative, and those vvhich are helpefulle to the concoctione: For it vveare the greatest, absurdest error of the vvorlde, if soe be in the first, especiallye in an vnhealthfulle bodye, to vse violent stopping astringent medicame~tes, for it vveare nothinge els, the~ to shutt keepe our enimye or theefe vvithin doores.
VVherfore his viandes, or meate drincke, must onlye be Diureticke, astringent causinge to voyde vrine, because through the vrine especially, all aquositye of the blood is evacuated: but if so be you perceave, that the great toughenes of the acute sharp adusted Pituita, or aquosity, vvhich is verye retardatelye expelled conglutinateth vvith the guttes, or entralles, is a cause of the bloody flixe, vvith payn vvith corrosio~, you must the~ vvith discretio~ vse the urine expulsors, or vrine provoki~g remedyes because through the vse therof, it expelleth the aaquosity throgh the vvhich othervvyse the forsayed viscouse tough Pituita, might by chau~ce have binne driven out, so that thervvith it is made more viscouse and tougher, then before for by hovv much the lesse any thick viscouse matter, hath adioyned vnto it anye thinne humiditye, by soe much it is the vvorse.
VVe permit some consideringe the imbicillitye of their stomackes, to vse drincke a little astringent vvyne.
Farthermore vve must bevvare, and take heede, of all sharpe, mordicant medicamentes, as Arsenicum, Auripigmentum, Antimonium Sal Gemmae, manie other such like thinges, that because of their, to great, suddayne evacuationes, because they irritate provoacke the dissease.
Thirdlye vve must consider on the Liver, especiallye on the stomacke, because all those vvhich are afflicted vvith the bloodye flixe, can digest noe viandes.
The specialle end must be the fluxione, or the dissease it selfe.
The Scopus of the fluxione is, to stoppe, to diverte the concurrent humors, but vve must in the first gentlely, easilye reserate the same, vvith such, consideration, as before vve have sayed, least that in reseratinge of the same you increase the ague, the vvhich vvith reason, and experience may chaunce.
The remedyes vvhich may be taken out of the reason, are ether externall, or internalle.
Simple, as Covvemilcke, nue Egges, vvith Masticke, or vvith Ambergreece, Poulder of sovver Mulberryes, flovvers of Peatches, fine Bolus, Terra sigillata, confited Nuttes, Nuttmegges, beinge thervvith intermixed: Rhabarbarum so acked in is alsoe hadde in greate estimatione, or in the decoctione of Mirobalanes, Syrope of dryed Roses, Iulep, of Roses.
Amongst the compounde Remedyes are the Trociskes of Diacorallum, Dialectrum, De Spodio, vvith the iuyce of Endive, of Cicorye, more other.
VVe must alsoe content our selves, in this dissease vvith sudoriferouse medicaments, and vvith easye vomites: because throughe diversityes, vve may reserate, retayne the fluxione.
This subseqvent poulder, is oftentimes vvith great successe administred, vsed, the vvayght of a Crovvne, vvith the yolcke of an Egge. {rum} Boli Armeni, terrae sigillatae, lapidis Haematites, ana drachmas duas, picis navalis vnciam semis, Coralli rub.
cornu Cervi vsti loti in aqva Plantaginis, ana scrup. duas, Sacchari rosati vncias duas, fiat omniu~ pulvis subtilis: capiat drachmam semis, vel scrupulos duos mane.
But to commit noe error at all, vve must before the reseratione, or before the vse of this poulder, administer an ounce of Cassie, by it selfe, or vvith halfe a dragme of Rabarber: or vvith an ovvnce of the double Catholicon, vvith a decoctione of Plantine, of Agrimonye, Flovvers of Nenufarre, vvith Tamariscus, to the refrenatione, or bridlinge, of this furiouse humoure.
Or els vve must take, a gentle infusione, or expressione of Rubarbe, made vvith Rosevvater, addinge thervnto sixe dragmes, or an ounce, of Catholicon.
But besydes all this, vve may not reserate, restraygne this laske at the first, as the common poeple suppose.
But amongst the externall remedyes, Phlebotomye is verye commodiouse for the same, but must alvvayes be effected vvith Knovvledge of the cause, for that sometimes is more necessarye then all the other remedyes, especilye, vvhen as the intemperature beinge caused out of the Liver, vrgeth vs thervnto but not heerby to debilitate the forces stre~gth of the Patient, vvhich in this dissease reqvire to be firmed, co~forted, the sayed phlebotomye must vvith all discretione be done, because the Patient, throughe the deprivatione of to greate a qvantitye of Bloode at one time, might chau~ce to be vvholye superated, overcome, and fall dovvne deade vnder his packe, or burthen: For it is knovvn vnto all men, that the blood is the treasure of lyfe or the domicille, habitatione of the soule: Secondly vve may not in Phlebotomizatione be to timorouse fearfull, for in place of Phlebotomye, yeeldinge ayre to the Vaynes, the ague chaunceth sometimes to co~tinue, increase alsoe, the bloode also gettinge noe ayre, is the~ polluted vvith some sharpenes, or venoumousnes, vvhich therafter corrodeth, consumeth the entralles.
The Patient is praeserved by his strengthe, throughe goode nouriture, feedinge, vvhich is easye of digestione, throughe the Cordialle corroboratinge medicamentes.
Amongst the astringent Medicame~tes, ther are the oyles of Quinces, of Roses, of Masticke, oyle of Mirtles, beinge intermingled vvith a little astringent poulder, in like sorte ther are also confortative Playsters, amongst the rest, is the co~fortative Plaster of Vigo, vvhich vvith co~sideratione, must be vsed, as before vve have sayed.
VVe may in this dissease alsoe vse some certayne fumigationes, exsiccating Lavame~tes.
Those thinges vvhich are most belonginge, to the dissease, are the mundificationes, and the co~solidationes of the vlcerationes: For the mu~difyinge of all vlcerationes is nothinge els, the~ to cure, to exsicte, to co~solidate the~.
VVher fore first of all vve must elavate the vlceratione vvith a clisterye, and if the same be profovvnde, deepe, a little absterge the same, mixinge thervnder some confortative thinges, to fortifye, strengthen the intestines.
VVhervnto as the~ vve may vse, mellifyed, or vvith the yolkes of Egges, Suger, Honye of Roses, vvith many other such like thinges beinge mixed thervnder: and if soe be vve as yet desire more to mundifye the same, vve must then vse the decoctione of vvheaten branne, of Vetches: and if soe be ther be calidity adioyned theru~to, vve must the~ adde thervnto Sap of Roses, of Plantine, or iuyce of Night shade, or Solatri.
Touchinge the co~solidatione, that is effected throughe the providence of nature, or vvith any incarnatinge medicame~tes, vvhich vve call Sarcotica.
Vnto co~solidatione are foure thinges necessarye, to vvitt, the clisteryes of Plantine, of Hogges grasse, and of VVillovvleaves, vnto the vvhich vve adde Goates suet, Butter, oyle of Ro+ses, or oyle of svveet Almondes, vvhervvith the vlceratio~s be internally annoyneted, the punctione, acuitye of the vlceration is somvvhat diminished, vvhich co~tinually soacketh theri~.
VVe may also verye fitlye mixe theramo~gst, the sealed earth, Franckinsence, Sangvis Draconis, amongst manye other this one incarnateth very much, to vvitt the Lachrima Thuris, but vve must note that all these Poulders, be verye diminutlye pulverisated, least that in the vlcerationes of the entralles, they chaunce to corrode, bite.
As touchinge the Clisteryes, vve must at the first vse, payne assvvaginge clisteryes, as ther are those, vvhich are made of freshe milcke, vvher in vve must contunde some yolckes of Egges, oftentimes reiteratinge of the same: and the~ vsinge the absterginge clisteryes, vvhich gentlelye vvil purifye the intestines.
VVe make also divers other of divers fashons, formes: vvher vnto this shall serve, for an example of one. {rum} Rosar. rub.

VVe may vse this clister, reiterate the same as often as vve perceave it to be necessarye: but vvhen vve must vse some astringent Clisterye, vvhich vve may not doe, vnles that the repecca+ting humors, be cleanlye purged out, and then vve may vse this subseqvent clisterye, or anye other such like.

VVe may also co~stitute, exordinate, to this end divers Sundrye potiones, Electuaryes, also the Kindes of Diacorallum, nature of a Harte fine Bolus, sealed earth, iuyce of Berberis, Ribes, conserve of Roses.
The Empiricke medicame~tes, vvhich the Me+thodicall Physiciones, doe so disdayne, esteeme of little vvorth, are those vvhich vve throughe experience, throughe the divturnall vse have fovvnde to be most excelle~t, vvhich being vsed vvith iudgeme~t, are not vvholye to be disdayned, seinge that Galen testifyeth, that the Phy+sition, must be established one tvvo fundame~tes or foundations, to vvitt, on the reason, on the experie~ce, vvherof the Reason is, as it vveare the Soule of the same, vvhich measureth, ponderateth all thinges: and the Experience the body, as a provide~t, tutor Schoolmaster.
Experie~ce teacheth vs, that the Rubarbe, on vvhat manner soever vve administre the same, (but especiallye the infusione therof) is verye commodious profitable in this dissease, as in like sorte also is the Spiritus Vitrioli, vvith Rosevvater, vvithe Plantinevvater, also beinge administred vvith Cynamomevvater.
Ther is a sugerye dulcor, or svveetnes, extracted out of Leade, vvhich never deceaved the hope of the right vvorshipfull Mr. Duion, vvhich is a verye experte, learned Physition, vvherof have attayned the best, of this discours.
The Tincture of Coralle, and of yellovve Ambre, extractede vvith Aquavitae is in his operation admirable, also Crocus Martis, Flos sulfuris being administred vvith co~serves of the betryes of the Cornus, Co~serve of Roses, Marmalade, Citronpeelinges, vvith manye other such like thinges, are all together verye commodiouse.
Because amongst naturall thinges, knovv nothing that exsiccateth more, oppugneth it selfe more agaynst all corruptiones: And to conclude ther are an innumerable sortes of remedyes, vvhich vve must so compounde, that they may have one similitude, or one Analogye vvith the dissease.
Finallye, vve must in an extreame Dysenteria, for the last remedye, endevoure to mitigate the payne, vvith Narcoticall thinges, as is the Oleum Iusqviami, Mandragora, the could seedes, the Philounium.
Reqvies Nicolai, manye othes such like compositiones, vvhich are vnto this dissease vsed, vvhich may not be administred the~ vvith great iudgment and advice had therone.
The end of this Treatise of the Dysenteria, or Bloodyeflixe.
An Apologye, for the Chirurgians, wher throughe is apparantlye, evidentlye demonstrated, shewed, which be the occasions, or causes of death, in divers sundry, wounded Persons, although notwithstandinge, their woundes weare smalle: wher by the Chyrurgians may be liberated, excused, from all calumnes, sclaunders wher with falsely they are accused, reproched.
THe common discourses of Chyrurgery, are novve adayes farre more meane, idle, more fabulouse, vncertayne, the~ the Nativityes of the Goddes, the Historyes of the Giantes or the doctrines of the Philosophicall stone yea a thousand other phantasticall sommationes, dreames.
There is novvadayes in all Fraunce, but one expert Chyrurgiane, vvhome everye potentate and great Lorde, endevoureth to retayn by them, vvherthrough they are vvont to say have the best expertest Chyrurgian vvhich is living, vvherfore they also laude, extoll him, to have a million of knackes vvhich vveare never before herde, or knovvne.
The one boasteth that his Chyrurgia~, in a verye shorte time, hath cured one vvhich hath binn shott clean throughe his head althoughe the very substa~ce of the Braynes, issued therout: the other stedfastlye affirmeth, that his Chyrurgiane, hath agayn imposed the Eye of a man, vvhich fro~ the earth he tooke vp, vvithout beinge deprived of his sight in that Eye, or els that he cut of a peece of ones Liver, or Milte, yet hath praeserved the life of the man.
Farthermore an other vvill bouldlye periure himselfe, say, that they are but nugationes, Childrens play for his Chyrurgian to cure, a harqueboushed, or shotten vvounde of the Harte, the Liver, the Milte, the Blather, and the stomacke, and the Intestins and of the great vaynes, yea is noe more molested thervvith, the~ vveare the Sould lours of Iulius Caesar, vvhich never interrogated hovv forcible, strong theire enimies vveare, but vvheare they vveare: nether one vvhat place of the Citye the breach vvas bartered but vvhether i~deed it vve are shott or not.
So that novvadayes, the Chyrurgianes also doe not anye more aske, nether doe any more endevoure, to knovv the nature, the conditio~, the necessity, the vse, or the vvorthines, or excellencye of the vvounded partes, but aske only vvhether the man be vvouded, althoughe all the ossicles of his Legge, vveare crushed, yet vvithi~ the space of
dayes, at the farthest, vvith theire vvater of shotte~ vvoundes they are able to cure them, although my selfe doe not disdayne the same, the same beinge ad+ministred, vsed vvith discretton.
And breefly to co~clude each lord supposeth that he hath by him an Hippocrates, an Aesculapius, a Podalirus, a Machaon.
Out of vvhich ignora~ce, persuasion, as not to knovve, vvhat vvoundes are mortalle or curable, vvhat vvou~des are little, or greate, vvhich are of an easy, or difficulte resanation, ther must then necessarilye heerout follovve, that vvhe~as any body seemeth to be little hurt dyeth vnder the ha~des of a most expert Chyrurgia~ ether because of the greatnes of the vvound, through any vnhealthfullnes of the bodye, through any concursione of humours, or els because of any vnexpected accidentes, he is then vvithout all compassione, blamed, disdayned and diffamed, notvvithstandinge all his greate paynes or dilligence, accordinge to the arte he in curinge of the foresayed Patient hath done that, because they are ignorant of the causes of his deathe, allvvayes persuade themselves, that if the Patie~t had binne in handes of theire Chyrurgiane, he vvithout al doubte had not dyed, although that theire Chyrurgian, have experimented tried little or nothinge at all and is vvholy inexperte so that by continuance of time vve finde the~ to doe, or vvorck noe more miracles the~ a com+mon or lay man, and also vvith noe more certayntye, doctrine, nor experience and oftentimes in their practise, beinge at theire vvittes, or councels end, are constrayned to sue for succou+re, ayde of their companions, or partakers.
Because therfore that in conseqvente times heerafter, these fellovves, should not vndeservedlye reape such honoure, the aunciente Chyrurgianes might liberate, free the~selves from all calumnes, of beinge ignora~t vvhich is layed to their charge, and to reqvite, and resolve the opinions of those mighty, and pote~tat Lordes vvith reason, because therafter they doe no more blame, and sclaunder the Chyrur+gianes, vvill heere breeflye recite, the occasions of Death, causinge them playnlye, and evidently, to vndersta~de that ther are some vvhich of a vvou~d, vvhich vve esteeme to be but small, and of little regarde, doe notvvithstanding dye, yet of expert, learnede men the same vvas esteemed, and accounted for a perillouse vvounde.
And contrarilye, some are cured of great vvoundes, vvhich indeede vve esteeme to be but smalle, and of little regarde, and vvhich vvith all facilitye may be cured.
Notvvithstandinge beinge impossible for the Chyrurgiane, hovv erudite, experte, soever he be, to cure all men, althoughe at sometimes they be vvoundede vvith verye smalle vvoundes.
Novv therfore to returne to our discourse, vve must first of all knovve, that to cure a vvo+undede parte, to restore agayne that into his former, accustomed estate of health thervnto are many thinges reqvired, vvhich heere normallye, rightlye vvill prosecute.
First of all ther is the integrity, force, vigore of the vulneratede, hurte parte, or membre: As evidentlye doe demonstrat vnto vs, the aucthoritye, reasone, and experience: For accordi~g to the opinione, and sentence, of divine Hippocrates, It is nature vvhich cureth all sicknesses, and disseases sect.
The vvounded partes are infeebled, ether co~sidering the nature of their first conformation or throughe any accidentes, chauncinge to the dissease, or els because of any hurtes, or shottes vvhich happen vnto the same: vve may throughe their nature knovve the~ vvhen as the head is to little, for as then it is vvhole inconvenie~t: Or els to grosse and so vaste, and ponderouse, that becaus of the dissease, the patie~t is not able to beare vp the same right on his shoulders: If so be it be perfectlye, and completly rounde for in such a Heade is ether vvanting, the anterioure, or the posterioure future, or both of the~ together vvhich are the suspiracles, through the vvhich nature disburseth her selfe, of all superfluityes, vvhich beinge therin contaynede, they retardate the curatione of the vvounde.
And if it soe chaunced, that the Heade of your vvounded, vveare indecently formed, the vvound seeminge to be small, (allthough indeede noe Capitalle vvoundes are to be esteemed smalle) and the curation therof be tardife, and the Patiente chaunce to dye therof, vve ought not as then in anye sorte to attribute the faulte vnto the Chyrurgiane but to the badde formatione of that parte vvhich is hurte, or vvounded.
VVe must alsoe vnderstande the same of the Breaste, vvhich being anguste, stricte, sufficiently demonstrateth vnto vs, that the harte and the naturall calor of the same are very feeble be cause the domicille of the harte, the Lu~ges is to angustlye formed: vvhich might be the cause that if any body, being vvounded in such an angust stricte breaste, shall vvith great difficulty receave agayn his health, because the natural caliditye, being in these partes feeble, la~guide shall not be able to surmount the Accidentes vvhich ordinarilye happen vnto such partes, as difficulty of respiratio~, through the oppression of the effuded blood in that part, vvhich ca~ not be digested, nor expelled, ether by the Mouthe, or through the vvou~d, that for vvante of naturall caloure, vvhich co~monly in such a stricte anguste Breast is very smalle.
The like may also be sayed of the Back, of the Spina Dorsi or Backebone, vvhich being so~vvhat to lo~g as those vvhich co~tumeliouslye, diridingly vve call Elevenribbes, because they have such huge and vaste long sydes vvherof vve neede not doubt, but that such a Back or Backcbone, is farre more debile then others, therfore more apte, and prone to receave anye vnnaturall humiditye, vvherfor also in such vvou~des there happe~ great fluxio~s betvveen the Muscles, the skinn betvvixte the dista~ces of the same, becaus of the great qua~tity of excreme~tes, vvhich have theire accourse out of the Braynes, other partes of the body, vvherby, betvvee~ the Muscles the di+sta~ces of the same, there sincke manye superfluous humors, vvhich by conseque~ce of time are chau~ged into some venoumouse humiditye, matter, through the vvhich vve are so~times co~strayned, to make some great apertione, vvhich require a long continuance of time to the mu~difyinge therof, vvholy to be cured, yea so~times also aulter chau~g into fistles, becaus of the tendernes softenes of the part, vvhich ca~ not be shut, nether through ligamentes reserated, or co~pressede, as an arme or legg.
Hippocrates hath observed, noted that betvvixte feeble, diseased fleshe ther alvvayes desce~deth si~cketh a vvaterishe humudity, vvhich easily can corrupt.
The small, thinne, Hern fashoned hippes legges, vvherof vve commonlye say they goe one VVayghtes, are vnder, and above all most of aequall crassititude and thicknes, co~trary to those vvhich vve saye, to be hipped, legged, or have a payere of goode, stedfast stiltes vnder the~, vvhich are vvel proportioned, vvher of daylye experience teacheth vs, that to our greate greefe, and sorrovve, that such persons, ether being vvou~ded in hippes, in the legges or in the feete, are subiecte vnto many, and divers accidentes, the vvoundes alsoe difficult to be cured mu~difyed, in the vvhich ofte~times abo+ve the ordinary fluxio~s therin enge~dreth proude fleshe: novve being as it vveare almost readye to be Cicatrizede, can very difficultely be brought thervnto, being cicatrized, through anye small occasion bursteth open agayn.
And if so be the bones be offended, or broke~, as then the Ioyncte most commonlye consumeth, and vvithereth the health very retardately can be agayne restored.
Novv all this vvhich hath binn sayed, is sufficientlye knovvne, vvith all the diseases of all other partes.
But vve must generallye note, that the most assuredst signe, of the imbicilitye of anye parte, chaunceth through, the vntemperatnes, and badde formatio~ of the same: for if so be that the Temperamente, had binne goode, and by consequence, the formative virtue had binn stronge, she should as then exactlye have formed that parte: for by the operation is the operator therof knovvne.
VVherfofe Aristotle is of opinion, that the incomplete creation, hath her deformity, through the vvante of the frigide, could nature, and the imbicillity of the Sperma for even as vve see, that the Mechanicall operatours, or handyecraftes men, can not make any peece of vvorke so perfect, so neate, of a badd peece of stuffe as, they might vvell easily doe, of a good, and apt and tractable peece of stuffe, vvhich is not spoyled, nor corrupted.
All vvhich is before approvede by the thirde rule, sect.
of the sixte Epidemioru~ Hippocratis, founded, on an excelle~t Axioma in the comme~taries of Gale~, vvhere be sayeth, Imbicilla membra multum pravumque excrementum colligere consueverunt.
Such a congregatio~, excrescence of venou~ous excrementes vvhich chaunce to congregate themselves together in such deformed partes doe drounde, choacke, oftentimes corrupte the naturalle caloure, first of all of the diseased parte, and then of the vvhole bodye, after the vvhich must necessarilye follovve death, vvithout the Chyrurgiane being able to remedy the same or vvith any aequitye might therof be blamed although notvvithstanding ofte~times the Princes great Lordes, vvhich of these matters have smalle knovvledge, vvithout occasio~ doe blame, reproache theire Chyrurgians: yea some times also accuse them, require of the magistrate to have punished, themselves also vndeservedlye punishe theire Chyrurgians.
Touching the accide~talle imbicillity, vvhich hath binne from the beginning of the first creation, it is certayn, that as vve have sayed of the momorsions, or Bittes, even so in like sorte vve may saye of the diseases, that the first are verye nocent, vnto the last: For Quae non possunt singula, multa nocent: a little therafter, Gutta cavat lapidem, non vi, sed saepe cadendo.
VVe doe not throughe sicknes a mende, the pitcher goeth so often to the vvell, till that in the end he returne broken home agayne.
For all diseases are of so venoumous a nature that although they are cle+ane cured, yet they relinquishe some badde reliques in the parte, vvherthrough they may the easyer returne agayne, vvherfore of our Divine Hippocrates it is called Philostrophes, vvhich signifyeth, noe return agayn or at the least, such partes are as then most subiected to receave some nue disease: also the sayed Hippocrates sayeth farther, in his Booke of internall diseases, that all aegritudes, vvhich follovv any other disease, are allvvayes most co~monlye mortall: because shee findeth the naturall forces debilitated: vvhich vve allsoe must vnderstande of the vvoundes, vvhich are receaved in anye partes of the body, vvhich before have once binn vvounded.
These dispositiones are of oure Physiciones called Diatheses and are esteemed to have great forces, for the generatione of diseases or for an incurable confirmation of the same: In like sorte allso relinquesheth an Empirema after her, vvher by that Personne is made more subicte to receave more agues, that in such a sorte as a hott ove~, vvhich hath once binne heated, is more apte agayn to receave the heat: as in exa~ple, ther be any on vvhich hath once binn vvounded, agayn being vvounded, especiallye in the same place, vvher before he vvas vvou~ded it is impossible that the sayed parte shoulde have, the same force, virtue, or vigour, to repugme and to resiste for the curatio~ vvhich before shee hath hadde, before ever shee vvas vvounded: and that in such sorte as in a Corselet or harnas, vvherone hath binne a shott, and having gotten a crushe, or bendinge in, allthoughe the same be beaten, and malleated smothe agayne, yet it vvill never be beate~ so smoothe, nether so playne strong as it vvas before it hadde the shott.
Nether can can heer praetermit, to recite those vvhich have itenerated, and travelled throughe the Sudatorye regione, and passede, throughe the drive+ling, or sputaminouse climate, beinge agayn ready to travell the same vvay, being grevouslye vvounded, vvher there is one vvhich is safelye returned from the iournye vvith good fortune, there are three, yea foure vvhich by the vvay doe faynte and so dye: vvherfor as the~ vve admire, vvhy they are not cured, or vvhye their resanation is so tardife, not considering that the vvounded vvas halfe before corrupted, that his humors have vvholy binne aultered throughe the venoumousnes of the foresayed disease: or havinge binne cured therof, have as yet retayned any aulteratione in the Liver, or in anye other internalle partes, vvhich gathereth continuallye many venoumous excrementes, vvhich the foresayed parte vvithout anye cessation, dischargeth into the vvounded parte.
And soe most commonlye the occasione of death commeth throughe the inordinate state of life, in eatinge, and drinckinge vvithout observinge anye rule of victitation, hauntinge also of vvoemen, and not suffering themselves to be handled, of the handes of the Chyrurgian, as the cause requireth, it be ether in tenting of the vvounde, by inscisione, by cauterisatian, by keepinge himselfe quiet vvhich all aunciente Chyrurgians so highly and exactlye commau~de, to the furthera~ce of the curatio~ of the vvou~de, follovvinge the sayinges of Celsus, that Optimum Medicamentum, quies, abstinentia, is: Soe that am intended, as of a thinge that is of all men knovvne, not much in this place to speake therof althoughe notvvithstanding, it is oftentimes the occasione of death, hovv lightly soever they be vvounded: yea allsoe and of greate vvoundes, being cleane out of daunger throughe theire inordinate manner of lyfe, especiallye in eatinge, and drinckinge, doe agayne fall therin, and come to a farre more vvorse estate then ever before they vveare, yea and sometimes allsoe dye therof: for it is most certayne that.
More ther are which of Gluttonye dye heere, Then of blowes, or shottes to death come neere.
So that vve vvill novve, handle, or treacte, of the times of the yeare.
There is nothi~g more manifest, then that many vvounded personnes might of theire vvoundes be cured, if soe be the time of the year, vveare such, as it vveare requisite it should, that is, if soe be the foure seasons of the yeare, reserved their naturall temperature quallity: It is also apparent that the intemperature of the ayr, the disordre of the time, the astrolicalle venoume, other funestall influences, doe make the vvoundes incurable, or els verye difficulte to be cured, and chaungeth the habitude, and complexione of men, throughe the chaunginge of the time, through the Astronomicall constellation, vvhich over vs is praedominating.
As if so be the vvinter, vvhich ought indeede to be coulde, vveare vvarme, the summer vvhich ought to be vvarm, is coulde: Also vvhen it is novv hott, the~ could, novv drye, the~ moyste, vvithout the time of the yeare requiringe the same to be othervvyse then he ought to be: vvhoe ca~ doubte therof but the same must be preiudiciall, to the vvou~ded patie~t? because our bodyes, heere bye receave mervaylouse, suddayne alterations chaunginges, vvherthrough out vitall spirites, humors, are vvondrouslye, vvith great daunger aultered, observinge the sayinge of Hippocrates, vvhich avoucheth that all repentine subite permutatio~, hovv soever the same may be are vnto our bodyes very preiudicialle.
The divrnalle experience demo~strateth the same vnto vs, for if so be in the vvinter, in stede of a drye coulde vvinde, there respire a southvvest vvind, vvith vvarmishe shovvres of rayne, ther then co~monlye follovve greate corruptiones in our humors, vvherthroughe the vvoundes doe putrifye, and gangraenize.
The infected ayre, may also be an occasion, of the death of manye vvounded persons, hovv little soever they so~times are vvounded: because vvithout ayre vve can not Live, vvhich allvvayes such as it is vve must receave, that not o~ly through the mouth, through all the conductes of our bodye, porotyes of our skinne, through our Arteryes, vvhich are situated vnder the porosityes of our skinne, fro~ vvhence the foresayed ayre doth dravve tovvardes our Lunges, so~vvhat to cool the harte, refreshe it be as it vveare a nouriture vnto the same, fro~ vvhence the sayed ayer is farther spreade devided throughe our vvhole bodye, vvherby it the~ chaunceth, that if so be the same be corrupted, infected, consequently also the foresayed Harte, vvith some other of the noble vvorthiest partes are polluted, in steade of be+inge praeserved, mayntayned, in theire forme virtue.
Galen in the ninth of his Methodes, attributeth so much to the ayr, that he sayeth that the especiallist, principalist demonstratio~ to cure anye dissease, must be observed out of the ayre: because vve ca~ in noe sorte, be vvanting or missinge the communitye, and vse therof.
Besydes al these occasiones, there are yet certayne times of the yeare, vvhich are irreprehe~dable, yet cleane contrarye to certayn disseases: for vvhoe is he that doubteth that the starre Canicula doth not disturbe the vvynes, causethe the same to boyle, vvhere he lyeth in the fellers? as by experie~ce vve finde in Plinio vve may reade, that the same also causeth our blood to boyle vvithin our vaynes, that so~times there follovveth such a superfluous sangvinatio~, that by noe meanes it can be restaygned, by the vvhich meanes the same also flovveth tovvard the vvounded parte, vvhich before vvas torme~ted vvith sufficient payne enoughe.
In like sorte also vve perceave the Autumne, or Hurvest to be an enimye to all vvoundes of the Lunges, as is appare~t by the
of the Aphorismes, becavse they oftentimes chaunge into fistles or into pectorall Apostemationes.
The penetrable coulde is allsoe a sore enimye to all vvou~des in the Heade, Aphor.
Farthermore Hippocrates dissuadeth vs, Lib. de aere, aquis locis to administer any physicke vnto the patientes in the greate constellation of the starres vnder the Solsticium, nor vnder the Aequinoctialles, because of the greate perturbations, alterations, vvhich as then are in our bodyes, by the vvhich meanes the vvoundes as the~ are farre more molestious mortalle: vvhich must al so be vnderstode of the greate vvyndes thunderinges, the effectes vvherof are so admirable, tirrible, in inanimate thinges, vvherbye vve may the lesse admire at the greate alterationes, vvhich they doe cause in the vvoundes, disseases of mens bodyes, vvhich bodye is the most sensiblest, and the most dilicatest, amongst all the animate bodyes.
Besydes this vve have spoken of the times saysons of the yeare, vve may also adde heeru~to that the Carpenters, the Architectors, doe alsoe observe a choyse of the fellede, cut dovvne vvoode, vvhich at this time, or at that saysone of the moone hath binne felled: esteeminge the vvoode, to be more moyste, replete vvith vvormes, more subiecte to corruptio~, vvhich is felled in the ful Moone, that more durable yea all most incorruptible, vvhich is felled in the decreace of the Moone, as in Palladio vve may reade, in his Treatise of Ianuary, Nove~bre, Caesar also sayeth the same, in his commentaryes, on Arat: that the Moone hath not onlye povver over that vvhich hath receaved se~sibilitye, but that alsoe the stones, the bones, and the VVoode doe perceave the effectes of the Moone, vvhich being of the Moo~infected, vvexeth full of vvormes: vvherfor the common phraise of the Lavvyers, or Iuristes is as yet observed, de Lignis sua Luna caesis: vvhich being soe vvherfore shoulde not vve also esteeme a vvounde, to be more moyste in a fulle Moone, more subiected to putrefactione, then in the decreace of the Moone, seinge that man is tender of fleshe farre more subiected vnder the domination, subiectione of the Moone, the influences therof, then those thinges, vvhich are inanimate have nether life, nor sensation: Above all these praecedente, reasons, and experiences it is manifest, a commo~ axiome, that all terrestrialle corps, are ruled, governed by the caelestiall, or supernall influences.
Through all vvhich foresayed occasions, the humors oftentimes being so corrupted, polluted, after death ther are certayn apostematio~s foure in divers places of the body, yea somtimes allso, in some of the vvorthyest partes of the body, as in the Liver, in the Braynes, in the Milte, in the Lunges, or in any ioynctes, accordinge vnto the imbicillitye of any of the partes of the body, vvhich have binne debile, apt to receave such impurity of the bodye, vvhich beinge thervvith, out of all measure charged, expellethe fro~ him the forsayed impure humors, in anye of the sayed feeble partes, vvhich therafter is chau~ged into purule~t matter, the vvhich there possessinge more place, makinge more concavitye, the~ is requisite, doe expell fro~ them certayne faetide venoumous vapours, participate the same vnto all the other vvorthiest partes, out of the vvhich insueth, Inquietude, Agues, Convulsio~s, or Spasmus, Phrenesye in the end necessarily must follovve death perceaving the vvou~des to vvaxe blacke dry, vvithout being able to iudge therof, or to knovve the occasio~, vvherof this might proceed, notvvithsta~ding hovv erudite, experte soever the Chy+rurgia~ be, nether being possible for him hovve small soever the vvounde be to save the Patie~t, havi~g noe signe vvherbye he may knovv, vvhether that venoumouse matter, hath implanted it selfe in any of the sayed vvorthyest partes, or not.
Can the physicione cure all those, Which are incurable, and without repose.
Let vs therfore novv consider, serche out the pecvliare, co~stitutio~s of the vvounded: some ther are vvhich have little blood, tovvardes the resanatio~ of their vvoundes: others have to much vvhich notvvithsta~ding, is nether to the curation goode enoughe, nor pure enoughe.
Hippocrates speakinge of those vvhich have to little bloode, in the
rule of the fourthe section, in the sixt Epid: sayeth that those vvhich have theire entralls hott, as it vveare burninge, theire fleshe could have binn badlye nourished, vvhich commonly vve call vnhealthsame poeple, vvho having receaved in theire bodyes some great vvou~d, are most co~monly alvvayes very difficulte to be cured, for vvant of materialles: vvhich also vve may see to be in aged persons, vvhe~ as they are any vvhear vvounded, or by chaunce breake their legges.
VVe have also an excellent rule in Hippocrate vvhich is, the
Aphorisme, of the sixte sectione vvhere he sayeth Hydropicorum, lentiginorum on other places he addethe theru~to Vlcera non facile sanantur: of those vvhich are troubled vvith the Dropsy, because theire bloode is to cleere, vvaterishe: of the lentiginouse, because theire bloode is to sharpe, or tarte, for that occasione can make noe goode combinatione, or healinge: vvhereby this might be occasion, to vvit, vvhether it be through nature, or by the inordinate ma~ner of life, of eating, or drincking, it becaused, as by the drincking of stronge vvynes, or by eatinge of garlick, of Onions, of Porrhy, of pouldred, or saulted meate, or of spices, as the suldiours vveare vvonte to doe, that is little belo~ging to our purpose.
Nether can heer praetermit to speke, of the perturba~ce of the minde vvherthroughe most commonlye the Martialistes are very much afflicted, vvhich through the generosity of their courage, if so be that in any assault, battayle or skirmishe, they have not valia~te enoughe born the~selves, or at the least not to the co~tentatio~ of their Capitayne, have not as Caesaristes behaved the~selves, fought are therfore blamed, of those vvhich are their, enviours such as hate the~, vvheri~ they doe so veheme~tlye vexe, greeve themselves, that it ircketh the~, doe so melancholize themselves therin, that they doe vvholy neglect the~selves, desiring vociferatinge for death rather the~ to live soe miserablelye in dishonoure.
VVherfore also it may happen in the same, (beinge greevouslye vvou~ded) that vvhich happened to the Lord of Aussun, vvhich vvas one of the most valiant, most magnanimouse, gentlemen of all Frau~ce, of vvhome it vvas co~monly for a proverbe sayed, the hardines, and valoure d'Aussun, causeth vs to adhibite credite thervnto, vvho, throughe knovve not vvhat mischaunce, suddayn astonishme~t in the first charge of the battayle at dreux, ther arrived as it vvear overvvhelmed him such a disgrace, for the vvhich he so greeved him selfe, and sorrovved that vvithin fevv dayes therafter vvith sorrovve he died: havinge solemlye svvorne, that he vvould never anye more eate, or drincke, vvith vvhich resolution hedyed.
Contrarily the souldiors so~times, doe so valiauntly co~bate, by the vvhich they vvexe so couragious, doe so ioy the~selves therin, therby doe so exalt the~selves, that their harte of te~times is inflamed, puffed vp vvith pride of their victory, honoure vvhich they reape, enioy.
VVhich causeth great alteratio~, chau~ge as vvel in the body of the one as of the other.
And to speake truth, such motio~s turbatio~ of the minde, are of great forces, in the body of man, they cause therin ether great aegritudes disseases, or els death: for if to be the motions, and perturbations of the minde, have pover to increace the naturall caloure, or to diminis he the same, of causing the same to dravve in vvardes, or to expell the same outvvardes to spreade it selfe by the vvhole bodye: such motio~s of the naturall calour, vvhich doe reduce vvith the~ the vitall spirites, the blood, is an occasio~ of all disseases, of health: ther must then certaynlye subseqvute, that the sayed motions, and perturbationes of the soule, and minde, have all povver in their handes of our healthe.
So that it is even as Aristotle, Lib. de motu animalis Chap.
sayeth, that the motions, and turbations of the minde, doe cause such a remotio~ and alteration of the naturall caloure: as Hippocrates also testifieth the same vnto vs sect.
of the seconde of Methodes; vvhere he demo~strateth, that ther are manye vvhich throughe motione, and perturbatione of the mindes have died: VVherfore Galen also, on the
section, of the sixt Epidemiorum, those vvhich internallye, have a sharpe corrodent caloure, (vvherfore by by soe much the more vve must prohibite the vvounded) to abstayn from ire, and choler, and from all turbations of the minde, vvherbye the humors might be moved.
The sayed Galen in his booke de sanitate tuenda demonstrateth, that all turbations of the soule all motions of the minde, do ingendre greate quantitye of Cholera vvherby are caused great infla~matio~s fluxions in the vvounded parte and per conseqvence a Gangraena, and somtimes in the end a suddayne death.
Amongst all other turbations of the spirites, Ioy is that vvhich ought to cause the least accidentes vnto our bodyes, notvvithstanding vvas the same so immoderate, and violent in Chilonio lacedemonico, in Diagero Rhodiano, both the vvhich soe ioyed themselves, perceavinge their children victoriouslye to returne over theire enimies, that of ioy they both immediatlye, and suddaynlye died: for through such immoderate ioy, the bloode and the vitall spirites of the Harte, are vvith such veheme~cy reverted from the Harte, and diffused and disperced, throughe the vniversall bodye that the Harte, is vvholye destitute of his naturall caloure, the persone must necessarilye fall into syncopizatione, or fayntnes, out of vvhich commonly follovveth death: But if the ioy be moderate, it fortifyeth, and strengtheneth the animale, the naturalle virtues, stirreth vp the vitall spirites, suggerateth the digestione, and is consequently commodious for all the constitutione of mans bodye, vvherthrough the Ioynctes, are throughely soacked, moystened, because of the humiditye vvhich is disperced throughe the vvhole massa of the bloode, soe that by this meanes, the vvoundes are better mundified, and incarnated and those partes doe increace, and pingvifye.
In like sort alsoe doth Cholera, or anger, and yet also more, then the immoderate ioy: because heerby, besydes all this that in the spirites humors of the bodye is caused greate corrvptione and they throughe theire greate heat, caloure chaunce to inflame, and by this meanes consequently, the vvhole habitvde of the body is replete vvith putride agues, hovv little sicke soever the persone be, vvhich foresayed agues, if they chaunce to afflict the patient vnto death as it oftentimes happeneth, vve most commo~lye then attribute the same vnto his vvound, as if of the Chyrurgiane he had not binne vvell handled, and not to the ague.
Is it not evidente enoughe vnto vs, vvhat accidentes are caused throughe sorrovv, and greefe, hovv healthfull, sovnd soever the personne be vvhich is thervvith intrapped? for she soe reserateth, and as it vveare strictly occludeth the Harte, that by noe meanes there can engendre anye vitall spirites, and hovv fevv soever ther are, yet they may not be dispercede vvith the bloode throughe the vvhole body, because the same is grosse, and tenebrous, by the vvhich the vitall virtues, and al theire acco~plices, are debilitated: so that in the end a man is in his minde vexed, hebede, the Harte omitteth all ioy, pleasure, he odiously hateth himselfe, fallinge into desperatione, and raginge, havinge lost his livelye coloure in his face, consuming the body, vvherby oftentimes must follovv death.
It vvill not also be alienate vnto our purpose, to the a poroving of my sayinges, that heere recite that vvhich the father of eloquence hath vvritte~ ad Atticum, the vvordes vvherof are these: It vveare an excellent matter my good frend Atticus, that man could live, vvithout meate, or drincke: but yet a farre more excellelle~ter matter if so be vvithout anye envie, and hate vve coulde Live: because those viandes vvhich vve eate, doe corrupt nothi~g els the~ our humours, but the trayterous envie, and sorrovv, doe consume vs eve~ vnto the bones: Envye, malice consume the bones, corrode the entralls, as vve playnlye may behoulde: for man sickeneth, through some certayne envye, malice, of the vvhich he by continuance of time dieth.
Doest thou not knovv by experience, that tvvo torturors, vvhich vvill deprive a ma~ of life, that the torturer of greefe, and sorrovve is the most cruellest, yea then of the Gluttonye? Nether may vve heere omitt to recense, and speake of the obstupesce~ce, feare, vvhervvith the covvardes, faynte harted are oftentimes touched, and taken: This stupor causeth in vs, the same accide~tes vvhich the sorrovve causeth but somvvhat greater for the time: for this fore sayed stupefactione, and feare, expulseth from him, retracteth tovvarde the harte (but vvith more festination, more raptnes, then the sorrovv) the bloode the vitall spirites, vvherfor vve may perceave, that the face in the time of stupefactione, feare, vvaxeth pale, and the externall partes coulde, vvith tremblinge of the vvhole body: the Belly relaxateth, the speech fayleth, vvith a greate reverberation of the harte, because that throughe the greate quantity of bloode, of the spirites, vvhich suddaynly doe retire thethervvardes, being allmost suffocated can verye difficultlye move it selfe, but greatly desireth to be refreshed, and discharged of such a sarcinatione, so that oftentimes ther follovveth death, because the bloode being dravvne tovvardes the Harte, suffocateth it selfe there, by that meanes the naturall calor and the vitall spirites bei~g extingvished, vvithout the vvhich the life of man can not be preserved.
If so be that anye bodye beinge vvounded, through perturbatio~s of the mind doe chau~ce to dye, the vulgare commo~ poeple, vvill not attribute the occasio~ of death vnto chose praecedent, or praenominated occasions, but farre more to the negligence, and ignorance, of the Chyrurgian, vvhich hath not intreacted him, as it vveare convenient he had done, although that those vvhich have a more sovvnder iudgement of such occasions, vvill iudge clane contrarye thervnto, and others.
The like also may be sayed of those, vvhich vvill not allovv of the vvill, and intente of the Chyrurgian, nether of anye other remedyes vvhich vveare commodious, and proffitable for his health, beinge ether to timorous, or delicate, to suffer any apertion, vvhich for his disease had binne necessarye, to administre issue, passage to some corrodent matter, or parcells of bones, that lye there praepared readye to be taken out, vvhich by theire remansione in that place, doe also corrupte the finitimate partes, doe alter permutate the remanent part of bone, and corrupt the Marrovve, vvherby the health, can not suddaynlye follovve, as the Chyrurgiane is exoptatinge, vvishinge for the same, yea also by this meanes oftentimes remayne incurable, by vvhich occasione the Chyrurgiane, vvith his Patient must hope for that vvhich his Patient vvill not suffer, and yet notvvithstandinge is required of his disease.
And to this end Du Bellay, reciteth in his memoryes, that the Duke d'Aumall, sonne to the Duke a Gvyse, being mortally vvou~ded, vvith a spli~ter of a lau~ce, vvhich pearced his Eye, sayed to the Chyrurgians, intreate, or handle not my sonne as a Prince, or mightye Lord, but as a Pioner, or servant: vvhich vvas alsoe an occasione of his resanation, because he suffered, that the tronchone of the Launce, vvhich stucke clean through his heade, to be vvith force, and violence dravvne therout.
And if therfore vve desire to enter into the conte~platio~ of the diversityes of instrumeme~tes vvhervvith the vvou~des are made, vve shall then finde sufficient occasion, to establishe the vnexspected death considering onlye the matter vvherof the vvoundes are receaved, as vvell of the small, as greate vvoundes.
Those vvhich have vvritten of Agriculture, or tillage, Gardening, as Cato Plinius, Columella say, that theris greate difference, vvhether a tree be vvith an Iron knife engraffed, or vvith a knife of Bone.
And vve make little or noe differe~ce, vvhether our bodyes are vvounded vvith Leade, Iron or Brasse, seing that brasse being mixed vvithe the matter of our vvoundes resolveth it selfe into viriditye, vvhich corrodeth the fleshe, and causeth somtimes such an inflammatio~, that death therafter follovveth.
Nether is it sufficie~t, that in shorte time, vve have accommodated this mettle vnto our ruine, but novv by little and little vve make it four cornerde, vvhich is farre more daungerouse, the~ if it vveare rounde, because throughe the quadrangulatenes therof, it rescindeth, cutteth breaketh in peeces al that vvhero~ it glaunceth, vvithout any smalle hope of resanatione: as also somtimes the bullets are fastened together vvith coppervvyer by vvhich meanes they cutt a sundre all fleshe, vaynes, arteryes and Synnues, vvhich are in that parte.
And becaus that those men, vvhich co~monlye vve must give account of our cures, ar farre more stirred vp through exa~ples the~ vvith any reason, vvhat example is it of the daughter of Nerio vvhich is discribed in the fifte booke of Epidem: Hippocratis, vvhich being but of the age of
yeares, and beinge smitten iestingly, of one of her playfellovves, and frendes, vvith the palme of the hand, on her forehead, is therof grovven mute, asthmaticke, or shorte of respiratio~ and fallen into a convulsione, and tremblinge, and so the ninthe day therafter died.
True vvill the backbiter or sclaunderer say that chaunced throughe the commotio~ of the braynes: vvhat ansvver? of such a little blovv, vvhich vvith the palme of the hand vvas done, and of a mayden, frende and playfellovve, iestinglye strikinge a mayde of tvventye yeares? VVhye shoulde not then the same commotione of a varice, or bursted vayne, not onlye in the Braynes, but in the Breste also, vvhich happeneth to a souldioure, vvho hath ridden the space of ten, or tvvelve hovvres longe on a harde trottinge Horse, and vvho before hath taken greate paynes, and travayle, hath led an inordinate manner of victitatione, the vaynes of the Lunges, the Harte spanned, extended, or svvollen, vvith vvyne vvhich is as it vveare a corselet vnto them, vvhervvithe they adorne, arme themselves, vvhen as they assault their enimies, and especially in Battayle, vvher they doe straygne themselves vvith lovvde clamors and scritchinges, vvith fightinge, and furiouslye assaultinge, not dallyinge, or playinge vvith their enimyes, but bouldlye incountring them vvith Launces, on theire bodyes, and thvvacking the on the other vvith courtelasses, and vvith Pistolls, and Muskettes, shootinge each, at other, by that meanes to murdre on another, yea and they also vvhich are completelye harnassed, beinge lifted out of theire saddles lye one the earthe for the other Horses, to trample one vvhich not only one or tvvo dayes have binn in greate trouble but the vvhole before vvinter have suffered in tollerable coulde, and marched through, rayne, vvind hayle, and Snovve, or els have travayled the vvhole sommer, through extreame heat of the sunne, and have received all the iniuryes of time have bin hardlye lodged yea and sometimes vnder the resplende~t starres, living on his pray vvhich he hath gotten, somtimes halfe dressed, or ravve, hott or coulde not tarryinge the time, of the meales sometimes beinge replete vvith, filthye, stinckinge and corrupt viandes, and for his drinck harshe, noughty tappi~ges of vvyne, or els foule and impure puddle, yea stinckinge vvater, havinge consumed most of his time vvith nocturnall vigilations, laboure, feare, stupor, anger, melancholye.
Others dye because in time they are not dressed and succoured, vvhich as yet not long a goe is happened, vnto our great sorrovv, lamentatione, to Capitayne Roux, vvho vvas shott in his cheeke, rising, to avoyde a clistery, vvhich vvas administred vnto him, had such a fluxione of bloode out of his vvounde, during the space of eight hovvres, vvithout finding any Chyrurgiane vvhich coulde restraygne the bloode, soe that in the end he vvas co~strayned to yealde his spirite, my partakers, or compagnions, Ponget, le Gendre, and Hubert, and I, beinge charged to tarry vvith the King that night in the trenches: therfore the Chyrurgians ought noe more to be blamed, then vvhen the disease is so deeplye rooted, that ther is noe more remedye or cure for the same, for as vve say by the commo~ proverbe, or oulde adagye.
To serotine doth Doctour then beginne, When the disease to deepe is rooted in.
Ther are othervvyse many thinges vvanting by the vvou~ded, vvhervvith vve might succoure the~, solace the~ as it is requisite vve should.
VVe see oftentimes greate Lordes lodged in an aperte place vvher the vvyndes blovve on al sydes, beinge destitute of oulde linnen to dresse them vvith, have very small store of victualles, and drinck, heere omitt the poore souldiours, vvho being vvounded must lodge on the earth.
Therto may novve be ansvvered: confesse that sometimes of the yeare are intemperate, vnordinate, that the ayre also is infected, corrupted that the vvounded also have vvant, are destitute of manye thinges, breefly to co~clude, that manye of the above rehearsed thinges doe fayle: notvvithstandinge ther are many cured vvithout anye accidentes chauncinge to theire vvoundes, and for vvhose sake take little paynes, have noe great expenses, althoughe they are verye sorelye vvounded contrarily, other of little shallovv vvou~des doe dye.
To this obiect ansvvere, that all vvoundes vvhich seeme to be larg ample, are not therfor mortall or perillous, as are the great carnall or fleshye dissolutions or vvoundes, vvherin none of the vvorthiest partes are touched vvhich are ne+cessarye to the life of man, vvherin are nether hurte great Vaynes, Arteryes or synnues, but vvhich are onlye greate, cutt in the fleshe, as in the Buttocke, in the calfe of the Legges or in an Arme and yet notvvithstandinge be called a great vvounde, not being so daungerous, as the least punctio~ of a synnue is, or the hurt of a greate Vayne or Arterye, or els a little fissure of the Cranium, or any small thrust in the Brest, or the inferior parte of the Bellye, percinge into the concavitye of the same.
And if so be there vveare any vvhich of such vvoundes vveare cured, beinge great vvoundes, not consideringe the apertione, but because of the vvou~ded parte they ought to be vvell disposed, to buste strong, to resiste such an evell, impeach the accidentes vvhich happen thervnto, that they must also be rightlye disposed& tempered vvithout anye of the vvorthye partes, or those vvhich are necessary vnto life being thervvithe polluted or corrupted, and such may easilye be cured: Soe that those vvhich are not vvholye sovvnde of body havinge receaved such a vvounde, are in great daunger of death, as others considering the difference of the time and of the difference of the bodye, and body, and of partes therof: there are some, vvhich are of so good a temperature, that they vvith great facility are cured of such vvou~des, the vvhich in others bodyes vvear mortal: Contrarily ther are some persons, vvhich have receaved a vvound in some abiecte and not necessarye parte or Ioyncte, vvithout profoundly penetrating the same, vvherof notvvithsta~ding they died, ether through the constitutio~ of the time or throughe the disposition of the bodye, the humours vvher of have their deflue~ces tovvards the vvounded parte or els through any other occasions, heere before alleged: but the vulgare poeple, can not compraehend all these circumstances, and considirations, as the Chyrurgians doe in such persons.
For to speake truth vve looke on the time, one the yeare, daye, numbre of poeple, all vvhich have binne the one as sorelye hurte, or vvoundede as the other, yet for all that, those vvhich vve esteeme most daungerously vvou~dede, vve iudge to be out of all hope, are so~times first of all cured: VVher of vve doe not so muche admire, after vve have after death anotomizede the deade corpes: for besydes ther vvounde vve finde, an other apparente occasione of death.
As it is as yet in freshe memory happened to the Lorde of Bellay Barron of Tovarce, King at d'Ivetot, vvho having receaved a shott before Rove~, or Roane in his left Arme, vvher of the focille of the Elbovve vvas broken the vvounde beinge in good suppuatio~, yelding goode matter, and the fleshe verye rubicund, grayned as vve vvoulde desire, the Arme remayninge in his naturall dispositione, as vvell above, as beneathe, vvithout anye payne, or inflammatione, verye fevv, or noe agues at all adioyninge thervnto, notvvithstanding al vvhich beinge brought to his house, tvventy dayes after his vvound receaved, is he fallen into a hot, venoumous, or furious ague, vvhich accompagniede him vnto the thirtith day, in vvhich day he died, hovv greate paynes, and laboure soever the expertest Doctors of Physicke, Chyrurgians and amongst other the right vvorshipfull Mr. Amboyse Dr. of Physicke, an ordinary Physicione to the Kinge, have therin taken, vvhose experience is sufficientlye knovve~, the foresayed Arme vvith the vvou~d allvvayes remayninge is his former estate, disposition.
Novv the corps beinge Anotomized, vve perceaved his Lunges to be cleane corrupt, and replete vvith obdurate schirrouse vlcerations, his right Kidney also vvholy polluted much matter in his blather: vvhich vvas the occasione of his death, not the vvounde it is a thinge therfore most certayne, that if so be his entralls had binn sou~de vvithout doubte he might have binne cured of his vvounde, because the same nether of it selfe, nor of anye other accidentes vvas mortall.
The contrarye heerof chaunced, to the great contentation of all the Nobility, to my Lord of Gyuri vvho having receaved, a terrible shot, in his sinistre shoulder, the entra~ce vvherof vvas right in the ioyncture, the bullet havinge touched a great parte of the apophysis of the bone of the Arme, pearcinge a longe the Omoplate, remayning, in the inferiore angle of the foresayed Omoplate, vvhich bullet vvas happely extracted dravvne out by Mr. Lavenot, svvoren Chyrurgiane to the Kinge, vvhich verye excellently hath dressed him the first time: notvvithstandinge, he is of this greate vvound (I say greate vvounde consideringe that parte of the bodye) vvholy cured, vvithout perceaving therin any bad accidents.
The vvhich vve must attribute, partely to the good Temperature compositione, and nature, (vvhich must cure all diseases,) vvhen as shee is evel intreated of experte, and learnede Physicions, and Chyrurgians, and therof ayded, as verye excellentlye hath done amongst others, the right vvorshipfull Mr. Portaile, Counceller, chiefe Chyrurgian to the King, vvhich as novv is chiefe amo~gst vs: of Mr. Gillis des Rus, his Chyrurgiane, vvhich dressed him: and vve are heer farther to note, and observe, that ther may be an other vvhich being vvou~ded in the same place of his body,& shalbe treacted of the selfe same Chyrurgians, and shall yet for all that dye.
And for the confirmatione, of al that vvhich is before rehearced, vvill conclude this my Apologie, throughe my Lordes heerevnder nominated, beginning vvith my Lorde de Hallot de Montmorency, vvho beinge on Horsbacke by the Citye of Rovan, receaved a shott of a canon, of the vvhich his Horse died, he beinge prostrated on the earthe, his Legge being in dives peeces broke~ right vnder the Ioyncte of the Knee, notvvithstandinge all vvhich, vvith his good dispositio~ nature hath co~bated agaynst all the malice of time, magnitude of the vvounde, beinge verye successivelye cured of the right vvorshipfull Mr. Martel, Chyrurgiane to the Kinge, vvho is verye experte in all the operations of Chyrurgerye.
Contrarilye, my Lord the Baron of Salignac, beinge vvounded onlye vvith a simple shott of a handgunn, vvithout anye fracture of bones, in the end dyed therof, al thoughe notvvithstandinge he vvas assisted by the right vvorshipfull Mr. Pouget, alsoe one of the Kinges Chyrurgians and chieffe in Montpelliers havinge seene the houre, in the vvhich the Gangraena chaunced to his vvounde, manye fluxions oppressed him, by vvhich meanes he verye difficultlye coulde be cured: VVhich vve must only attribute u~to his te~perature, vvhich vvas not soe good as in deede it vveare to be ex+optated it had.
The most happye cure vvhich Mr. des Hayes hath effected, one also of the Kinges Chyrurgians, vvhich is a verye vvyse man in the arte of Chyrurgerye on my Lorde de Vic, gouvernoure for the Kinge in St. Denis, vvho vvith divers vvoundes vvas vvounded, especiallye in his heade by the crovvne of the heade, and one the sagittalle suture vvhich vvas rescided cleane overthvvarte, is therof very ominously cured vvherby is demo~strated vnto vs, vvhat the goode dispositione of the body can doe, vvhich co~bated agaynst the iniuryes, and malice of time, and many other more, inquietudes, vveare cleane contrarye vnto him: vvherin the foresayed Mr. des Hayes, hath vsed great consideration, to his perfecte resanatione.
The same allsoe happened, in my Lorde the Duke of esperno~, vvho beinge vvounded vvith a greateshott, vvhich dilaniated a parte of his inferiour lippe, had deprived him of certayn of his teeth, and a part of his chavvbone, penetratinge, takinge his issue close by the vayne Iugularis, vvas cured of Monst. le Gendre, Surlin, Chyrurgians to the foresayed Duke: out of the vvhich vve may playnly note, that not onlye the iunioritye, or youth and good temperature, are not onlye profitable vnto the resanatione of vvoundes, but alsoe the goode constitutione of the time: For a little before (vvhich vvas about the besieging of Chartres) the~ died most of all the vvou~ded, hovv sound notvvithstanding soever they vveare, hovv little soever they vveare vvounded: vvhich partlye vve must attribute to the badde constitution of the time, as in deede at that time it vvas a disordred vveather: because in a shorte time therafter, all the vvounded vveare of their vvoundes cured: amongst others my Lorde the Earle of Flex, vvhoe in the end of the besieginge, receaved a short of a Canon in the inferiour parte of his Bellye, vvherof it vvas vvholye plettered even vnto the Peritoneum, the vvound being allmost the length of a foote, in longitude, of halfe a foot, in latitude, as Mr. Portayle Samboyse can vvitnes, vvhich a longe time administred helpe vnto them.
On the same time, my Lorde of Favolle vvas cured, of a shott, vvhich brake bothe the focilles of his Legg, a little above the anckle, vvhich allsoe vvas cured of the right vvorshipfulle Mr. Portaile, d'Amboyse, of the most ominouse, dextrous ha~d of Mr. Billarde, ordinarye Chyrurgiane to the King, and of Mr. Biron.
And for an inventio~, or practice, vvhich vve might say to be vvholy agaynst reason, amo~gst manye others more vvhich chaunced at Chartres: ther vvas the Chamberlayne of my Lord the Earle of Chiverny, called the Pietmontois, vvho vvas vvou~ded, on his heade vvith a raper, vvherby his Parietale vvas clea~ rescided throughe, yea clean through the Dura, Pia mater also, pearcing the depth of ones finger into the substa~ce of the Braynes: vvherof in the second dressinge, cleane throughe the dissolutione of the Craniu~, ther issued out as much of his Braynes, as the qua~tity of the little finger in lo~gitude, crassitude therof: notvvithstanding al this is he in the presence of the right vvorshipfull Mr. Le Febure, Duret, svvorne Physicions to the Kinge, other Doctours of this profession out of Paris, vvhich are verye experte in Chyrurgerye, vvhich vveare alsoe assistantes in this disease, vvas of me completelye cured, vvithout havinge retayned any accidente, or impedimente therof: Divers Chyrurgians of the citye of Chartres stoode heerby, amongst the rest vvas Mr. Fransoys Cheaureau, Michel Fauveau.
At the same time trepanede Gabriell du Tertre, a verye experte Chyrurgiane in all his operationes, a certayne vvomane vvhich vvas threescore yeare of age, or more, vvhoe hadde a fracture in her occipitalle partes of the heade: he hadde besides her a little page, or lackye in handes, vvhoe hadde his Os Petrosum brokene splitte, and some parte of the Parietale.
In like sorte also trepaned Mr. Gillis Pillier, a most expert Chyrurgiane, a Tripeseller, called Mr. Laurence, vvho had his membrane Dura matter cleft a sunder: all vvhich foresayed patientes have receaved theire complete resanatione: vve must heer also farther note, that vvithin the space of tvvo moneths therbefore all those vvhich vveare vvounded in the Heade died, notvvithstandinge all the secourse vve coulde doe them yet for all that they dyed suddaynlye.
All vvhich beinge noted, vve must attribute the deaths of soe manye valiant Capitaynes, vvorthy Lordes, and brave souldiours, on such occasions, and disorders, and not on the fault as if they vveare inconvenientlye treacted, sollicited, vvhether ether it vveare throughe yonge, or oulde Chyrurgians.
Or els vve vvill conclude it rightlye, vvith the Aphorisme, commo~ proverbe, it is allvvayes good Lucke, as lo~ge as a man falleth not and breaketh his Necke.
As Hesiodus sayed, sometimes is the day our mother, and sometims our stepmother.

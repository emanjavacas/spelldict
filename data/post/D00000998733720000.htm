worthy cozen

know you expect a relation of what we did in our late proceedings against the rebells in these parts am now returned from the field where we have sufficiently dispersed the rogues and where out of a curiosity to see what people did might as well have put a period to my life as any amongst them but being as was an eye witnesse of all can the more truely enforme you thereof the particulars of our successe in briefe was this first· we commoned martin castle and they yeelded but marcht off without their armes it had good store of corne but was not very strong then we marched by and the rogues appeared and shot at us from a farre but hurt none of us
that night we marched by where they by defied us and some horsemen being drunke came out in a bravado but captaine treswell snapped one of them and the rest retired into the castle wee tooke this castle upon the it being manned by very desperate fellowes of which some scorned to aske quarter of parliament rogues as they

cal'd us those maintained a steeple by themselves till it was all battered to the ground they buried in the ruines such as asked quarter were promised
it by the common souldiers which knocked them on the head as fast as they came downe for their cloathes such as had quarter given by officers had it observed there were few of those think about foure we killed here two hundred and in the rage of the souldiers some women and children were killed was hartily sorry to see it
the souldiers cme to be so enraged for the death of lievetenant oliver a very gallant man slaine by a stone from the battlements· we lost here ten men and had many hurt
at this time we tooke in a paltry castle at moone there they went without armes also then we marched thence having staid before tinmolin two daies and on the way captaine hrmn met us who told us how neere carlo he had notice of some of the rogues which were gathered together and marching to generall preston they were about foure hundred of which he killed two hundred and tooke one captaine and twenty prisoners he lost never a man in the businesse

thence we marched onward as generall preston might judge by our course to washford and in the way tooke a captaine of horse of the enemies one mosterson captaine pollard tooke him but the next morning about two of the clocke we couzined his expectation and went to rosse they never expected us that way for we saw them runne out of their townes just as we came to the townesside

and all the way till then we found the townes empty
we tooke early in the morning two or three spies who told us that generall preston quartered that night behind the next hill which was but two miles off our forlorne hope rode up to the wals of rosse and were heartily bid welcome by them that kept the fort for they tooke them for some of generall prestons horse they might easily have kept the port till fresh horse had relieved them and so have tooke the towne without losse of time or men if they had knowne so much
this opportunity missed made the lord lile and sir chafe inwardly it was so long ere the foot came up and the ordnance were planted that generall preston from the other side of the water presently filled it with men when we had made a breach we could not enter we had left both our hand grenadoes and scaling ladders at home which was a foule fault
we had two majors shot two or three gentlemen of companies killed and or
common men above
shot
this made us al very melanchollique but the marquesse of ormond hearing that generall preston lay very neer us raysed the siedge and we marched from rosse to old rosse that night to looke for him we saw many of his horse but they would not stand as soone as we were risen from rosse the men within the towne quit the towne and joyned with generall preston

the next day we marched all the morning within sight of one another but could not come together

for a great bogge but about three of the clock we ioyned
the enemy made five thousand shotte upon the forlorne hope led on by captaine
atkins and at the horse which stood in order behind them and killed not one man in this time our ordnance were drawne up which by the assistance of some seamen which were forced to leave their ships in the river and gunns also were so well plied that they made great slaughter
then they marched with as much resolution as men could possible up toward the ordnance but so many fell by the way that they began to rout then the lord lile with his horse encountred their horse which advanced also to meete him and truly he and sir richard greenevile behaved themselves so that many of them fell in the skirmish a great many of their prime men were taken prisoners they fought gallantly for an houre and halfe their horse till this instant having never done any thing remarkable fought bravely their nobility and chiefe gentry rode as volunteers in troops and like men they fought but it pleased god not to prosper their endeavours there were killed in this fight colonell thomas butler captaine edward butler and divers other of the butlers sir beverly britton was slaine and sir morgan cavanah captaine scarlough captaine of horse and to be short about thirty of their prime men cullein the lievetenant generall of the field serjant major butler lieutenant butler captaine fitzgerald and three or

foure more of their captaines taken prisoners they never met such a counter buffe since the rebellion
we were indifferent well revenged for rosse the force of the enemy is judged and confessed to be about seven thousand the slaine in the place scarce two hundred
viewed the field from one end to the other but they were above sixscore of them gentlemen and prime men that scorned to runne away a great many died as they marched away as we in our next dayes march found upon the wa and in hedges we lost never an officer and had but one hurt that was sir thomas lucas a privie councellour we lost about
men but many were wounded
the next day at night generall preston quartered within halfe a mile of us but he had a great river betwixt us and him he could not get
together the next day had he not cut of the bridge we had beene with him againe as we understood by such as runne from him to us so great a feare had possessed his souldiers that he could scarce keepe the few he had together
had omitted one thing as sir james dilhon was bringing his forces to joyne with generall preston major pigot
weene did as much for him as captaine harman had done for those at tullo neere carlo he killed above
of them
that dilhon is a puppie he hath ever beene beaten by all that have fought with him most strangely
now we marched homewards and in our returne did nothing save taking in two castles

nor had any hurt done to us save seven or eight oxen stole one night and another night they fell upon the horse quarter and killed one cope a gentleman and tooke two or three horses
you have the totall surely

have done with william robinson and shall make an end with you to if you faile me one posh
if my brother be not able to returne me of his own money he is in slender condition and am for a trick that know in much worse
see plainty ireland will be wonne if we can get any mony to subsist by it is pitty so brave an army should be starved
thanke god the best people here valew me beyond my desert farre and find much civility from all and doubt not cousin but very shortly shall be able to requite those curtesies which you have shewed

your poore friend and kinsman doctor in physicke

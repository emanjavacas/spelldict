the true interest of nations impartially stated in a sermon preached at the lent assizes at chelmesford in essex march

proving that the promoting universal righteousness piety justice and honesty is the sure means to exalt a nation its inhabitants and government in honour safety and prosperity
by anthony walker d.d ezech

if thou warn the wicked and he turn not from his wickedness nor from his wicked way he shall die in his iniquity but thou hast delivered thy soul
verse
if thou warn the righteous that the righteous sin not and he doth not sin he shall surely live because he is warned also thou hast delivered thy soul

much and most deservedly honoured

how stale and suspected soever the pretence be of extorting importunity to inforce it as an excuse of appearing in print yet no man of sense nay prejudice it self than which nothing is more senseless can judge me so far lost to all sentiments of truth modesty and common prudence as to appeal

to such unexceptionable witnesses in a case that would not bear it
the truth is was with so much reluctancy brought to let this sermon see more light which unavoidable late going to church forc'd me to deliver in the dark that rather need to beg pardon for it
but when had almost to rudeness withstood requests a person of quality turned intreating into arguing and inforc'd some passages in the sermon with which he judged my denials not well to consist then as the eagle pierced with an arrow feathered from its own wing my obstinacy was vanquished by my own weapons and with unwilling willingness yielded to run the risk of its losing by the eye what it had beyond expectation gain'd by the ear

heartily bless god that have liv'd to see judges in england who cannot only bear but approve such honest plain preaching and

desire it may be made publick with hope that it will do some service to the nation
and if may touch so small a thing for cannot own it needs apology my citing so many scriptures suspect will be styled nimiam diligentiam and but a solemn trifling be it so yet did not run into this error blindfold
had my business been only with men's ears and fancies should have used other tools but having to do with their hearts and consciences and to cut down sin and build up righteousness knew nothing so fit for my purpose as the sword of the spirit the word of god which is quick and powerful and the only weapon fit to pull down the strong holds of sin and satan
god will be god whether sinners will or no and his word will retain an awe upon men's minds how unmodish soever it seem to urge so much of it and will be a golden sceptre to convince and rule or else a rod of iron to condemn and to break in pieces
and here present it to your honours and the unprejudiced honest readers and if it may prove useful to the publick and acceptable to men of such a character it shall suffice for a plea for righteousness cannot be to unrighteous men till it convince them to forsake it and though it should fall more short of acceptance from the press than it exceeded my hopes from the pulpit shall rest satisfy'd in this act of obedience to my betters and kindness to my equals and shall study to approve my self more readily your honours most humble and most obedient servant

a sermon preached at the assizes held at chelmsford march the
epigraph on proverbs
righteousness exalteth a nation but sin is a reproach to any people
though these words have no dependence on the context nor coherence with it yet they have a secret aspect on and a tacit regard to a supposed truth which is the basis on which they are built and the hidden source and spring from whence they flow and issue to wit

that noble principle which nature hath imprinted on mankind with characters as legible as indelible viz
that every man should and every wise and good man

will desire and endeavour to promote the honour safety and welfare of his native countrey the nation of which he is a member for as the first and greatest law of nature is to love our selves to preserve our being and to advance our own the second is like unto it to love our countrey and promote its happiness and for our brethren and companions sake to seek its good psal
and this being supposed as a sulstratum the text directs the method and the means in and by which that end may be attained viz by following after righteousness and avoiding preventing and suppressing sin to the utmost of our power both in our selves and others for righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a reproach to any people
which divine aphorism contains an excellent and infallible receipt and direction for the health of the body politick prescribed by the ablest and the wisest who acceptably begg'd and successfully obtain'd his skill from god himself kings

and to render it as intelligible and practicable and my discourse upon it as suitable and seasonable as can to the present occasion will first set the parts of the text in their due order
secondly explain them briefly in that order
thirdly set before you a proposition resulting from that explication comprehending the scope and meaning of them
in the text are evidently three parts

a subject about which somewhat is affirmed a nation any people
ii
two very different causes affecting and influencing that subject righteousness sin
iii
the effects produced by these causes exaltation repreach
which are as contrary to each other as were the causes from which they do proceed so that there is an evident antithesis or opposition between the two entire sentences and every word in either of them
and as contraries set by one another set off and illustrate one the other the text carries its own commentary with it and might help to explain it self
but will wave and deny my self that advantage and to husband time confine my self to the former branch righteousness exalts a nation every word of which without wresting or offering the least violence to them may bear a threefold signification
first the subject nation may signifie
the countrey or place inhabited as take away our place and nation john

the people inhabiting in such a place people nations languages dan

acts
but this is so common it needs no proof and the very text expounds it making any people in the latter branch parallel to nation in the former

the government and polity by which such a people are governed in such a country defended from their enemies secur'd in their rights restrain'd from doing ill encourag'd to do well by wise and righteous laws and just execution of them by rewards and punishments for if house may be put for the master of it as luke
this day is salvation come to this house to zacheus as find it expounded and church for the ruling part in the church matth

tell it to the church
tis not less proper to expound nation for the government of a nation
secondly the cause righteousness with respect to nations may be considered as threefold for evangelical righteousness respects persons singly not nations complexly which we may call religious civil moral righteousness
religious righteousness is godliness or piety which gives to god the worship and service he expects the glory due unto his name psal
which is the scope of the first table

civil legal political righteousness which is justice and equity consisting in due administration of judgment by just distribution of rewards and punishments according to the true design and intent of the wise and righteous laws of every nation and society of men defending and rewarding those who observe and keep them and restraining and punishing those who transgress and break them that the administration of justice may be really the terrer of evil doers and to the praise of them who do well rom

moral righteousness is honesty and probity fair and upright dealing by private persons betwixt man and man the source of which is to love our neighbour as our selves mat
and that golden rule of our saviour to do to others as we would they should do to us luke
and the whole amounts to walking in all capacities with all good conscience void of offence towards god and men acts
thirdly
the effect exalteth this also may imply three things honour safety plenty

to exalt signifies to set up on high in honour renown and fame to make thee high above all nations which he hath made in praise in name and honour deut
and the very text intimates this in opposing reproach to being exalted

safety
to be set on high oft signifies to be placed out of the reach of danger to set him on high from him that puffeth at him
he shall dwell on high his place of defence shall be the munition of rocks isa
he is my shield and my salvation my high tower and my refuge my saviour thou savest me from violence sam


plenty and prosperity when it is with a notion as david pray'd it might be with his psal
that our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth our daughters as polished after the similitude of a palace that our garners may be full affording all manner of store that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in our streets that our oxen may be strong to labour that there be no breaking in nor going out that there be no complaining in our streets happy is the people that is in such a case
happy here is consignificant to being exalted
and that enlarged promise of exceeding plenty deut
the lord shall make thee plenteous in goods in the fruit of thy ground
the lord shall open to thee his good treasure
ends thus
and the lord shall make thee the head and not the tail and thou shalt be above only and thou shalt not be beneath
so that plenty and prosperity properly exalts in and account
thus from this genuine explication of the words you may please to take a comprehensive view of this excellent text and grasp the strength and substance of it into one proposition viz
that religion and piety justice and equity probity and honesty exalt into honour and renown safety and peace plenty and prosperity a nation the land in which they are found the people by whom they are practised the government by which they are defended and promoted
in the handling which proposition shall set these limits and bounds to my discourse as the method and measures of it

to confirm its truth that they do it

to shew the season and circumstances when they do it

to demonstrate the reasons why or shew the means by which they do it
all which shall pursue as distinctly as can
begin with the first to confirm this truth viz that piety justice honesty exalt countries people governments in honour safety plenty
there cannot be a more full and comprehensive confirmation given of any truth than what may be drawn to confirm this from deut
in the first verses in all the branches of it which must refer you to being too long to transcribe and point at the particulars
when it goeth well with the righteous the city rejoiceth
by the blessing of the upright the city is exalted prov
religion and justice are like the two pillars solomon erected before the porch of the temple jakin and bouz establishment and strength kings
justice with religion as a great man hath observed is the strong foundation and the steddy prop of states and kingdoms therefore good men are as elisha call'd elijah the chariots of israel and the horsemen thereof kings
what a blessing had ten righteous men been to sodom for the sake of so small a number god would not have destroyed them gen
peace is the skin of a nation but religion and justice are its soul and spirits the rubbing off the skin may make it sore but the loss of soul and spirits bring death without remedy
golden christians are truly the brazen walls and which secure cities
wisdom that is goodness or piety in solomon stile is better than weapons of war and strengthneth more than ten a number of perfection that is very many mighty men that are in the city eccl

but shall confirm the truth of this sentence righteousness exalts a nation according to the more enlarged sense

of it given in the explication and proposition
by arguments drawn from
god's promises

observation and experience

the aptitude and tendency of such causes to produce such effects
begin with the first god hath made good promises that it shall be so
the text is express and speaks in the present tense for greater assurance it exalteth to prove it shall so do
at present take the promises for granted and shall by and by produce them and on that supposition argue
they being made shall be made good or else either god cannot do it or he will not do it
not the first for he is almighty he can do all things job

nothing is too hard for him
his arm is not shortned nor his hand weakned jer
with god nothing shall be impossible luke
he made heaven and earth with a word and nothing can withstand or resist his power he doth whatever he pleases in the armies of heaven and amongst the inhabitants of the earth
not the second for he is faithful that hath promised heb
they are the promises of him that cannot lie tit
not only will not but cannot and may as soon cease to be god as to be true
he is not a man that he should lie or the son of man that he should repent numb
hath he said it and shall he not do it hath he spoken it and shall he not make it good see sam

now the promises are so many of this kind inopem me copia fecit the abundance of them distracts my choice and indeed it is the scope and drift of all the promises to encourage righteousness both personal and national and of the threatnings to discourage and restrain unrighteousness
see at leisure lev
deut
but to touch a few he withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous yea he establisheth them for ever and they are exalted job

he shall judge the people with righteousness and the poor with judgment then the mountains shall bring peace a comprehensive word for all prosperity and the little hills by righteousness psal
righteousness and peace kiss each other as is said of melchisedec king of salem first king of righteousness then king of peace heb
righteous kings shall inherit peace to themselves and people for the throne is established by righteousness prov to them that sit upon it and over whom it is set
the work of righteousness shall be peace and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever
and my people shall dwell in peaceable habitations and in sure dwellings and in quiet resting places isa
he that walketh righteously and speaketh uprightly that despiseth the gain of oppression and shaketh his hands from holding of bribes and stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood and shutteth his eyes from seeing of evil he shall dwell on high isa
see farther jer execute judgment and if you do this indeed then shall there enter in by these gates kings sitting upon the throne of david secondly experience confirms the same the most religious just and vertuous nations have generally speaking been most flourishing and the most righteous governments the most renown'd and prosperous

tis a good observation of st augustin that god gave that prosperous success to the romans by which they obtained the dominion of so great a part of the then known world for their justice fidelity temperance and chastity and their love and practice of moral vertues and punishing of vice in which they exceeded and may justly rise up in judgment against most christian nations who under so much clearer light and stricter obligations came so much short of them time would fail me to instance in particular persons
how religiously tender

were they of the publick faith when albanus was rent in pieces by four chariots for violating of it when given to an enemy
and be men never so impatient to hear of it twas those that made the reign of elizabeth so flourishing and her memory so dear to
and the sacred story from the time of the jews beginning to be a people through all their judges and kings till they ceas'd to be so is a constant exemplification of this truth how righteousness set them up and unrighteousness pull'd them down
shalt thou reign because thou inclosest thy self in cedar did not thy father eat and drink and do judgment and justice and then it was well with him
he judged the cause of the poor and needy then it was well with him
was not this to know me saith the lord jer
and tis a method worthy of god to proceed thus to make himself known and to teach the stupid world this lesson that the righteous lord loveth righteousness but them who do iniquity and love violence his soul hateth
tis righteousness which keeps destruction far off or prevents it when threatned and approaching
what sav'd judah and jehosophat from that mighty host which came against them but faith and prayer and reformation chron

what delivered jerusalem from senacharib host consisting of hundreds of thousands but the prayer of isaiah the prophet and hezekiah the king the ministers of religion and justice yea routed his army in a night by an angel slaying isa

what sav'd nineveh from god's peremptory threatned ruine within forty days but their crying mightily to god turning every one from his evil and ceasing from the violence that was in their hands jonah
where we

may easily take notice of all the three branches of righteousness in our proposition
they cried mightily to god there's piety they ceased from the violence of their hands there's justice they turned every one from the evil of their ways there's moral honesty or probity

this truth may be confirm'd from the relation there is between causes and their effects
we easily believe the production of effects when we see causes prepared apt and fit to bring them forth as that things shall be burnt when we see them cast into the fire that men's hunger and thirst shall be satisfied and slaked when we see them eat and drink what's wholesome in both kinds
now piety equity honesty are causes as fit to bring forth honour safety and prosperity as any causes can be to produce their proper effects and that first with respect to god the righteous judge of all the earth who will as certainly encourage and reward them as punish the contraries
mark abraham plea for sodom gen
to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right and so abimelech pleaded his innocency for his safety gen
wilt thou slay also a righteous nation the righteous lord loveth righteousness and he will act so that a man any man that takes notice of his providences shall say doubtless there is a reward for the righteous doubtless there is a god that judgeth in the earth psal
every man may see it man may behold it afar off job
he that runs may read it

confess as to particular persons god's proceedings with them are not always so obvious because he hath another place and time to reckon with them and reward them and on purpose forbears present payment sometimes to prove there is a future judgment
but for nations as nations this is the proper season for rewards or

punishments the nations of the world ceasing to be nations when the world shall cease to be
secondly with respect to the things themselves they have an apt tendency to produce such effects they are as seed which brings forth fruit of its own kind as wheat bears wheat so righteousness bears honour and safety
as grace is the seed of glory future to persons so these vertues are the seed of glory present to a nation
his salvation is nigh to them that fear him that glory may dwell in our land psal
light is sown for the righteous and gladness for the upright in heart psal
these light and gladness are comprehensive words including all we speak of to make a people happy and as they are sown for the righteous so righteousness is the seed sown from whence they spring glory to the righteous was the prophet's song isa
we oft meet this expression tendeth righteousness tendeth to life prov
religion and justice they have a propense tendency to the production of these things and we may thence conclude they will infallibly produce them
these are those waters of the sanctuary which heal all to which they flow and give life to every thing whither the river cometh ezek

when do they do it in what season and circumstances answer when religion and justice become national vertues are in esteem and reputation and tis men's interest to own and practise them

as there is no temptation greater than for men to find or think it their interest to be wicked for few escape that snare so no conjuncture is happier than when tis men's interest to be good and vertuous for that encourages many to be truly so and invites more to appear such when a nation exalts these they will exalt that nation
exalt her and she shall promote thee she shall bring thee to honour

when thou dost embrace her she shall give to thine head an ornament of grace a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee prov
but some may farther ask when may righteousness be esteemed national that we may expect and hope for these effects from it to which let me first say without offence heartily wish that we knew this so well by a gusty relishing and sweet experience that it were needless to be taught it by dry and more insipid speculations and that we had not known it by its contraries more feelingly than by it self and by the vexations wherewith god did vex us with adversity for our unrighteousness as azariah spake to asa chron

and first i'll tell you in a word when it will not do it when it is discountenanced look'd upon askew with a suspicious and a jealous eye reproach'd ridicul'd scorn'd hated persecuted that men are made ashamed and affraid to own it
the righteous god will not exalt that nation which thus treats righteousness unless for some little time ut graviori lapsu ruant that the higher they are lift up their fall may be more conspicuous to others and more painful to themselves
but secondly religion and justice then become and are to be esteemed national
when they are practised and encouraged by the greatest whose special province and peculiar duty it is to do it
great is the influence of example but the example of great men it of greatest influence
the court sets the fashion and is the standard to city and country not only of garbs but manners for as when a ruler hearkens to lies all his servants are wicked prov
so a wise king which sits on the throne of judgment whose throne is a throne of righteous judgment scattereth all evil with his eyes and bringeth the wheel over the wicked prov
if a sun of righteousness shine in that orb give me leave to use that phrase in an inferiour secondary sense he heals the nations of their impiety and oppression but if it be eclipsed or turned into bloud thick darkness covers all the nation
there shines the moon which governs the tides of vertue and vice and they rise and fall ebb and flow as influenced thence
tis almost constant in the sacred histories to give account of the jewish nation as to religion or wickedness according to the disposition of their great men
when the great men were rulers of sodom the inferiours are people of gomorrah isa

when piety and honesty and fidelity and ability are esteemed the best qualifications for publick employment and the next steps to preferment and no diminishing terms are not a bar or stainant colours in a man's
unrighteous governments must have tools suitable to their designs and work and honest men will not do dishonest things and therefore are not for their turn and tis well if they can scape with only being neglected
bonus vir cajus seius sed christianus so such and such are able men honest men but they are too precise too zealous and
tis the ruine of nations when ambitious men court high places and are admitted to them for favour or for money for they that buy must sell first themselves to do wickedly next the righteous and their cause because they scorn to purchase what the laws of god and men had given them so just a claim and title to
but happy the land where jethro counsel is canonical to place able men fearing god men of truth and hating covetousness over the people exod
when the righteous are in authority the people rejoyce saith solomon prov
and reason good they should for then piety equity and probity are like to be promoted

when tis approved by most and practised by many good looks and good company are two great advantages to make piety and honesty thrive and spread these are like the solum and caelum to a plant good soil and good sun and rain fertile earth and kind heaven when tis not dash'd out of countenance with a wrinkled scowling brow nor forc'd into the stable as joseph and the blessed virgin when there was no room for them in the inn luk
or like a speckled bird must fly into the wilderness because the birds of the forest are all against it jer
and constrain'd to sigh out david option that had the wings of a dove to fly away to be at rest psal
or to sit as a sparrow alone upon the because in the opening of the gates and concourse of the people none will regard her
how can righteousness be counted national when a nation abhors it and its own mother's children account it a stranger and an alien but when they who ask the way to zion with their faces thitherward jer
go as the tribes went to jerusalem in troops and with musick then weak hands and feeble knees weary legs and fainting hearts renew their strength and mount up as eagles and religion spreads amain like the vine which god brought out of egypt which when his hand planted fill'd the land psal


when tis scorn'd by few persecuted and suppress'd by none then as the gospel when it hath a free course runs and is glorified thes
when the stream of righteousness hath no dams in its chanel to obstruct its flowing it will like jordan in the time of harvest overflow its banks and water the land as nilus doth aegypt to make it fertile when neither the sword of the mouth nor the mouth of the sword are whet against it when no arrows of invenom'd bitter words dipp'd in the poison of asps are shot against it tis not stigmatized or branded with opprobious names which blast it as the burning eastwind

nips the tender buds and when the foot of violence cannot approach to hurt it but those dogs who delight to worry and to suck the blood of the lambs of christ are so muzzled or chain'd up that though they may grin and show their teeth they cannot tear and rend them
but men may be as good as they will and the grace of god excites and enables them to be and the voice of providence say to them even in this life present what christ spoke with relation to the life to come fear not little flock luke
and what our lord speak in a vision to paul be not affraid but speak and hold not thy peace for am with thee and none shall set upon thee to hurt thee acts
and righteousness obtains that privilege with which st luke concludes the history of the acts in relation to st paul
he received all that came into him preaching the kingdom of god and teaching the things which concern the lord jesus christ with all confidence no man forbidding him
when the children of god are not at the proud and cruel mercy of the slaves of satan nor at the will of them who hate them for their father's sake
when a nation is an holy safe and quiet habitation to righteous men
when under kings and those in
authority we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty tim

as st paul directs us to pray and as our own liturgy excellently teacheth us with fervency to beg for our king and queen that in all their thoughts words and actions they may ever seek god's honour and glory and study to preserve the people committed to their charge in wealth peace and godliness
in such a season piety equity and honesty are in a hopeful way to be exalted in a nation and then they will exalt that country people government in honour safety plenty which was the second head of discourse to shew when or in what circumstances of time it doth it
proceed to the third head to be discoursed on viz
to demonstrate the reasons why and shew the means by which piety equity probity thus exalt a nation
and though they are many time will allow me to insist upon but few of them
the first and principal is because they engage god to be god of such a nation and to own them and bless them as his people to demonstrate this might supersede the rest as needless or leave them but as grains to be cast into the balance which add but little to the main weight
may say of this as the great statesman who being ask'd what was the wisest and safest way to govern a kingdom wrote in the top the middle and foot of the page moderation moderation moderation or as the rhetorician who was ask'd what was the chief excellency of an orator reply'd pronunciation pronunciation pronunciation
so may we truly answer him who asks what exalts a nation with redoubled repetition god's presence with them this is the first the second and the third this is truly all in all
twas a bold motto that king us'd cui adhaereo praeest he prevails whose part take
but it is certainly so with those on whose side god vouchsafes to be isa
fear not for am with thee is full security
if god be for us who can be against us rom
let who will let who dare kick against the pricks they are like to have a hard task and they are sure to be
the lord is on my side will not fear what man can do unto me psal

when david spent many verses in recounting what makes nations flourish in men's esteem and concluded happy is the people which are in such a case he corrects himself in the last words yea happy is that people whose god is the lord psal
ult
they chiefly nay they only will be found so
in his hand is power and might so that none is able to withstand him chron

as jehosophat strengthned his own faith and the faith of his people
and david as fully as excellently thine lord is the greatness and the power and the glory and the victory and the majesty for all that is in heaven and in earth is thine
thine is the kingdom lord and thou art exalted as head above all
both riches and honour come of thee and thou reignest over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thine hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all chron

safety is of the lord as the holy father david psal
and the wise solomon prov
both assure us
yea how oft and fully doth nebuchadnezar an heathen acknowledge god's absolute dominion as god of gods and lord of kings dan

his dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom from generation to generation
all the inhabitants of the earth are as nothing he doth according to his will in the armies of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth none can stay his hand or say what doest thou dan

how oft doth david call him his strength and when tis said of sampson his strength departed from him the next verse explains it telling us god was departed from him judg
excuse my overdoing in so plain a case must suppose they have no bibles or use them not or believe them not to be god's word that need more

now to have this god to be with us and to be our sun and shield we must walk before him and be perfect which look upon not as spoken to persons only but to nations because to abraham to whom god said upon the changing of his name and the reason of his doing it a father of many nations have made thee and will make thee exceeding fruitful and will make nations of thee

and kings shall come out of thee gen
he was to be the father of the faithful and all nations were to be blessed in him tis spoke to the nations then in his loins
the lord will be with them that are with him

the lord is with you while you are with him
if you seek him he will be found of you if you forsake him he will forsake you
yea what god himself saith sam

him that honoureth me will honour but he that despiseth me shall be lightly esteemed
the lord will do good to them that are good and upright in their hearts
he will be with the good magistrate as jehoshaphat told his judges chron

and with a good people as all his words assure them
will urge one scripture more tis jer
at what instant shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to pluck up and to pull down and to destroy it if that nation against whom have pronounced turn from their evil will repent of the evil thought to do unto them
and at what instant shall speak concerning a nation and concerning a kingdom to build and to plant it if it do evil in my sight that it obey not my voice then will repent of the good wherewith said would benefit them
let us pause here
confess my infirmity this scripture strikes me with horror and amazement
never did the voice of providence speak more audibly more distinctly more intelligibly and more encouragingly concerning a nation to build and to plant it than in the late revolution and opportunity not only afford it self but even press'd upon us to make us a righteous nation and an happy people and it may be never was a work in it self so hard rendered so easie to have been accomplish'd had it not been our own fault and whether it be recoverable and not past remedy god only knows and the things of our peace hidden from us because we would not know them in the day of our visitation
there are many texts of scripture have a black a melancholy saturnine aspect upon our circumstances a few of which i'll point to
ezek
in thy filthiness is lewdness because have purged thee and thou wast not purged thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till have caused my fury to rest upon thee
when god's call is entertained with a deaf ear and his manifested expectation frustrated and disappointed which is our case if ever it were the case of any nation under heaven then surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you till you die saith the lord god of hosts isa

though most are so blind they know it not and none so blind as those who will not see that it be not to us according to the folly of our provocations

righteousness makes nations flourish removendo prohibens by putting a stop to and rooting out those vices which blast and make them wither which it effects partly by prevailing upon men's consciences to see the evil of them and to hate and loath them be ashamed of them and cast them off with detestation saying to them get you hence which is the first best
partly while the honest zealous magistrate restrains by due execution of justice such flagitious offenders from polluting the land and infecting others which is the next best
that those whom the love of god themselves and country will not constrain to be good the fear of the sword of justice may restrain from being at least openly so bad as their unbridled lusts would hurry them to be were that coercive curb removed

sin shall bring them under reproach but righteousness promoted prevents and roots out at least restrains these and so exalts a nation by removing what hinders it out of the way

it doth it promovendo adjuvans by promoting what greatly contributes to it
all that beautiful train of vertues which are the ornament and establishment of nations are the issue and the offspring of righteousness brought forth or brought up by it
to instance in a few diligence and industry which make families and kingdoms rich
but who will be diligent when the more he acquires the fairer mark and prey he is to oppressive violence from which there is no justice to secure and defend him honesty and fidelity the great allurement to trade and commerce for who will deal with treachery and falshood where nothing is to be expected but cozenage and fraud so courage and valour which nothing raises like a good conscience which is murus aheneus or guards so well as the whole armour of god a chief piece of which is a breastplate of righteousness eph
the righteous are bold as a lion but the wicked fly when none pursue them prov
and at best can be but for not considering their danger
wisdom and consideration which are drowned in excess and riot vice insatuates men and befools them

publick spiritedness and a natural kindness to our native land
the motto of which is sustine abstine bear and forbear
what is said of charity it beareth all things hopeth all things endureth all things cor
is true of a generous love of our country it will make us bear the burthens necessary for its preservation without murmuring and repining and will forbear selfish satisfactions which are not consistent with the publick good as particular nature yields and gives place to universal nature for its preservation
so unity and concord
piety and probity are the centre and bands which fasten men together
see how they love one another used the very heathens to say of the primitive christians
there may be conspiracy amongst thieves and traytors but true concord only amongst righteous men
the philosopher observed long since that friendship is only amongst good men
tis a promise of the covenant of grace by which is conveyed all that makes us good that god will give them one heart and one way jer
and then it is added will establish them assuredly with my whole heart and my whole soul
a kingdom divided cannot stand the emblem of the sheaf of arrows is lively every single one a child may snap insunder but bound up together the strongest arms cannot break them
religion hath its name religando from binding us to god and one another where the soul and substance of righteousness is duly minded men have no leisure to quarrel about its shadow and trimming

the time would fail me to enumerate half the vertues which secure and beautifie or vices which destroy and blot a nation with reproach
must leave them both to be suggested by your own thoughts all which prevailing

piety and probity plant or root out lift up the face of one and make the others hide their heads

righteousness exalts a nation by furnishing it with able men fit for the trusts and employments in which they are engaged than which nothing can be desired or conceived more conducive to so noble an end
how can that ship escape a wreck at the helm of which is an unskilful or unfaithful hand especially in stormy weather or amongst the rocks religion extends to all relations and will make men conscientious in discharge of their relative duties with the utmost care
they will not dare to undertake them without at least competent abilities nor continue in them without faithful improving those abilities yea when righteousness is the air and prevailing element of a nation the youth will suck it in in the nurseries of learning which furnisheth it with worthy men in church and state which proves an inestimable blessing

by rendring the subjects quiet and obedient and ready to support the government for conscience sake to god and gratitude to men and from a sense of their own happiness they enjoy under it and an awful veneration with which that government affects them which is managed with piety and equity
for as an harsh and tyrannous rigour renders it hateful and an over remiss facility renders it despicable and an encouraging of wickedness and vice renders it abominable to god and to the consciences of all men so countenancing religion and distributing justice impartially and yet with moderation fills a nation with admiration veneration love and which under god is the best security of thrones and those which sit upon them and therefore machiavel would have rulers to be righteous or at least to seem so to charm the people to that esteem of them which is necessary for the safety of themselves and countries

as righteousness renders the government easie and belov'd at home so secure from abroad which two fill both the pages of a people's wishes
now it secures a nation by preventing unjust quarrels and provoking needless troubles from neighbouring nations
those governments which have extinguished all differences of good and evil right and wrong who are under no law of god or nations but their own will and power who are always watching advantages to prey upon their weaker or less suspicious neighbours such in god's just judgment oft bring ruine or sore troubles upon their countrey
they that travel with iniquity conceive mischief and bring forth falshood dig and make pits for others fall into the ditch that they made their mischief returns upon their own heads and their violent dealing upon their own pate psal
the unrighteous aggressors meddle to their own hurt and reap nothing but the shame of being treacherous and the vengeance with which a just god repays it
we might give abundance of instances from history and not a few of recent date besides what roar'd so loud from vienna and since upon the turks in invading the empire during the not expired truce
but the of ahab who might have liv'd quietly at home but at ramoth gilead where he was the aggressor died by an arrow of god's own guiding kings
and especially of amasiah who had ruled well and prosperously when he fell into idolatry chron

and despised admonition
god left him to himself to pick an unjust quarrel with his neighbour joash king of israel
to whose wise and friendly counsels of peace when he had proudly and obstinately refused to hearken he routed his army took him himself prisoner broke down the walls of jerusalem and brought his kingdom to such distress as was scarcely ever known to overwhelm it all which had been prevented had righteousness prevail'd to keep him quiet

lastly to pass by many more advantages it gives a nation reputation that all their neighbours are affraid to molest them
if thou wilt keep the commandments of the lord thy god and walk in his ways all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by the name of the lord and they shall be afraid of thee deut
yea make them court their friendship and seek their alliance when a man's ways please the lord he maketh his enemies to be at peace with him prov
and that sutable passage zech
ten men a number of perfection that is very many of all languages of the nations shall take hold of the skirt of one that is a jew saying we will go with you for we have heard that god is with you
these are a few of the reasons why and means by which righteousness exalts a nation makes it flourish and sets it up in honour safety plenty and in all desirable prosperity and are in truth comparatively but a taste and sprinkling but one cluster of grapes such as the spies brought from the brook of eshcol numb to shew what fruits a land of righteousness brings forth for its inhabitants
but on the contrary unrighteousness iniquity and sin pull down upon any people all god's curses and where they prevail the vine of that land is the vine of sodom and of the fields of gomorrah the grapes are grapes of gall their clusters are bitter their wine is the poison of dragons and the cruel venom of asps
and now right honourable much honoured and in our lord humbly beg your leave that may and your patience whilst endeavour to make a free impartial improvement of what hath been delivered in a seasonable application
shall dispatch it in two uses
information

exhortation
first by way of information
if piety equity and honesty exalt a land its people and government in honour safety plenty render it prosperous and slourishing
let me draw these four instructive inferences

let us learn hence who are the most faithful to their country's interest and the truest friends to government righteous religious just sober upright honest men or profane godless unjust debauch'd fraudulent dishonest ones
a man would think it impossible to err in making judgment in so plain a case for surely they are better friends who do it good than they that do it mischief they that hold it up than they that pull it down they that engage god to be its defender than those who provoke him to become its enemy they that serve it than those who serve themselves of it
and yet however it comes to pass never was poison'd weapon so constantly made use of as this say as this against the best and honestest of men that they were not friends to caesar true to their country's interest and government
that it should be thus very frequently is not unaccountable nor need it seem strange if we consider that most governments have been idolatrous licentious wicked and as the most are the worst the community too ready to comply with them and applaud them as being like them and making their corrupt advantage of them
those who could not do so but shewed the most innocent dislike and most modestly bewailed or reproved what they saw amiss were stigmatized and branded with this hateful character as enemies to the publick as the most swinging revenge they could take of them as exposing them to the greatest hate and danger
thus it fared with noah in the old world

and thus was lot treated in sodom because his righteous soul was vexed with their abominations and could

not comply and because he dissuaded them from an abomination not to be named as modestly and kindly as the oyliest words could express it pray you brethren do not so wickedly gen
they reproach him as a busie malepert assuming fellow which must needs be forsooth a sodom this fellow came in to be a sojourner and he will needs be a judge therefore will we deal worse with thee than with them
gen
thus it fared with david amongst saul sycophants though he ventured his life far and wrought such great salvations for his people and was so innocent beyond exception that saul was constrained more than once to acknowledge him more righteous than himself
the land of israel was too hot for him and he found more shelter amongst the philistins whose champion he had slain than in his own countrey for the sake of which he put his life in his hand and ventured the combat in which he slew him
eliah was the troubler of israel though in truth the chariots and horsemen and jesabel must have his head
and holy jeremiah the best man then alive must dye as one who sought not the welfare of his people but their hurt jer
and king zedekiah himself had much ado to save him

the time would fail me to tell you of zacharias the son of jehojadah of isaiah daniel amos whose words the land could not bear and of all the prophets and old testament saints of which hebrews the gives so large an account and they of the new testament sped no better tis more than petty treason in john baptist to tell herod twas unlawful to have his brother's wife and his head must pay for it
our blessed lord himself was accused for speaking against caesar perverting the nation and forbidding to give tribute to caesar st luke
so impudent was their malice to lie in a matter of fact when he had vindicated caesar right in set conference with them

and bid them give to caesar the things which were caesars mark

and wrought a complicated miracle to pay him tribute mat
nay pilate himself was bugbear'd into the murther of the lord of glory by this weapon if thou let this man go thou art not caesar's friend
joh
when tertullus the orator was hired to accuse st paul that elect vessel he could find no ranker poison in which to dip his venal tongue than we found this man a pestilent fellow and a mover of sedition acts
and his fellows the holy apostles were shot at with the like invenom'd arrows
and the primitive christians because they could not swear by caesar genius or offer incense to his statue though they prayed for him most zealously obeyed him most loyally in all things consistent with their obeying god and lived most innocently and usefully among their yet were esteemed no better than traytors and rebels and common enemies of mankind but hope better things now
the second inference if righteousness exalt and sin reproach a nation they take wrong measures and give others false aim who think the carnal policy of conniving at men's unrighteousness and humouring them in their lusts and winning them by laying the reins of their wickedness loose upon their necks lest they grow turbulent and kick if they feel the curb or spur is the only way to settle a nation and secure its interest in honour safety peace
surely this is to build with untempered mortar and the wall so built will fall and overwhelm those who vainly hoped to be sheltred and defended by it for god hath said let favour be shewed to the wicked yet will he not learn righteousness in the land of uprightness will he deal unjustly and will not behold the majesty of the lord
isa

we may hence conjecture yea foresee what is like to be the fate of nations according to the prevalency of righteousness or sin in the midst of them tis in proportion like to be with people as with persons
say to the righteous it shall be well with them for they shall eat the fruit of their doings
say to the wicked it shall be ill with them for the reward of his hands shall be given him
isa
the words of micah are so apposite and so very awakening that cannot forbear transcribing them hoping you will consider from so great a prophet what you would not mind from so mean a speaker
am full of power by the spirit of the lord and of judgment and of might to declare unto jacob his transgressions and to israel his sin
micah
hear this pray you ye heads of the house of jacob and princes of the house of israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equity
they build up zion with blood and jerusalem with iniquity
the heads thereof judge for reward and the priests thereof teach for hire and the prophets thereof divine for money yet will they lean upon the lord and say is not the lord among us none evil can come among us
now comes their doom therefore shall zion for your sakes be plowed as a field and jerusalem shall become heaps and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest
such vengeance will a righteous god sooner or later cause to overtake unrighteous nations

see what an infinite advantage it is to have righteousness flourish and righteous men advanced into authority who may by their example bring it into reputation and by their power encourage and protect it and contra when the righteous are in authority the people rejoice but when the wicked beareth rule the people mourn and good reason they have to do so if they love their countrey and my text be scripture
secondly for exhortation
in general to all

in particular to those concern'd on this solemn occasion

in general beseech you all in the bowels of christ who shed his bloud to redeem us from iniquity and to purchase to himself a peculiar people zealous of good works tit

which he hath appointed us to walk in yea require and charge you in the name of the great the righteous and the dreadful judge of quick and dead to whom we must all shortly give an account yea adjure you by all that's dear to you and may be moving with you as men as parents as as christians as reformed christians as you love and desire the prosperity of your souls your families your native country the government under which you enjoy so many comforts your church your holy religion which is our glory by all these and by whatever else may be named or thought on that you love practise and promote with your utmost industry and zeal in your persons families neighbourhood and nation universal unreserved righteousness piety equity honesty every one in your places and capacities this is totum hominis the summ of your duty business happiness abstain from all evil name and thing act and appearance

cease to do evil learn to do well awake to righteousness and sin not isa
yea die to sin and live to righteousness cor
deny all ungodliness and worldly lusts and walk righteously soberly and godly in this present world tit
giving to god thy neighbour and thy self what's due to every of them with a conscience void of offence to all
and this is the way the only sure way to save thy soul from the wrath to come and your selves and dear posterity your dearer countrey your church and religion which should be dearest of them all from the threatning dangers and impending storm which our mighty sins have gathered into so dark a cloud so ready to break and

to discharge it self upon our guilty heads without this all will succeed ill were our armies as numerous as those of xerxes or senacherib and all as valiant and daring as their royal leader our fleet as gallant as that which conquered at lepanto our sinews of war a fund as inexhaustible as the ocean and the arm of flesh as strong as hercules or samson or you can wish or fansie all will dwindle and melt and vanish into nothing if god blow upon us or hide his face
and the prophet isaiah hath told you isa
that your iniquities persisted in and sins unrepented of will make him do it
but some will say what would you have us do the flouds of ungodly men make us affraid psal
he that departeth from evil makes himself a prey isa
our very remedy is turned into our disease religion which should help us is turn'd against it self and the form of it combats against the power almost as dangerously as an open enemy
omnia cùm liceant non licet impunè esse pium
if the foundations be removed what can the righteous do psal
i'll tell you as plainly as can
first take heed of hypocrisie and overweening affectation of singularity
pharisaical censuring and despising others luke
and saying stand by thy self am holier than thou isa make not things worse than they are nor brand every one thou fansiest not to be thy friend as an enemy of god nor the sincere devotions of others to be meer formalities because they would be so in thy self if thou shouldst use them with thy present principles and prejudices

secondly be not discouraged to do thy duty because others neglect theirs not scar'd from promoting righteousness by the reproach of singularity
tis better to be righteous alone than wicked with the greatest company or in company of the greatest
consider what our lord's interrogatory implies what do ye more than others mat
remember there is a as well as a

affected singularity
if others will not do their duty to save a nation let not that hinder thee from doing thine let them return to thee but return not thou to them jer
there is nothing of which the scripture gives more signal instances than the best men standing single and alone in their places and generaaions

the second branch of the exhortation shall direct to all concerned in the solemn business of the day plaintiffs and defendants counsellers and pleaders jurors and witnesses
beseech and warn you to do all you do say all you say as in the sight and hearing of him who judgeth righteously and will render to every man according to his deeds all whose ways are judgment a god of truth and without iniquity just and right is he deut
and if we must give an account for every idle word at the day of judgment mat
how much more for every false malicious scornful word spoken before a sacred tribunal of judgment briefly
do to others as you would others should do to you
none of you would be falsly witnessed against sworn out of your estates lives liberties by a false oath or have advantage taken of your ignorance or weakness to oppress you in judgment or be run down by noise and clamour do not serve others so

do as conscience will do by you at that tribunal whither you are hastning that will then speak the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
let that guide you not favour nor affection love or hatred faction or partiality expectation of reward or fear of revenge
lastly let me without imputation of indecent rudeness or immodest boldness
my right honourable lords the reverend judges be your remembrancer not to instruct you in your duty which you know much better than can teach it but to encourage you to persist in the performance of it
as the nations happiness absolutely depends upon the flourishing of righteousness and its flowing down as a mighty stream so the promoting of godliness and piety justice and equity honesty and probity doth much depend upon your love to them zeal for them and courage to execute true judgment with impartiality and truth
the motives to it are so many and so cogent have neither need nor time to reckon them up only beseech you always to carry them with you and often to reflect upon them
one is instead of all which shall repeat in the words of the good and great jehoshaphat chron

take heed what you do for you judge not for man but for the lord who is with you in judgment
ver
wherefore now let the fear of the lord be upon you take heed and do it for there is no iniquity with the lord nor respect of persons nor taking of gifts thus shall you do faithfully and with a perfect heart
ver
and what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren between bloud and bloud law and commandments statutes and judgments you shall warn them that they trespass not against the lord and so wrath come upon you and upon your brethren this do and you shall not trespass
ver
deal courageously and the lord shall be with the good
franciscus alverius writes of some aethiopian judges who sate upon the of their chairs leaving the seat empty for god or angels to sit in
and plato tells us that judgment used to be administred near the temples that the reverence of the deity might bend the judges mind to the doing of justice and humbly hope this taking the pulpit in the way to the bench may have the like effect amen

figure memento mori an elegy upon the unfortunate death of captain william bedloe who departed this life on fryday the twentieth of august


how fickle is the state of all mankind and how are all our joys with grief combin'd scarce can one say he lives and doth enjoy the blessings of this world without allay but some unhappy chance disturbs our peace and all our pleasures in a moment cease
the truth of which great captain bedloe fate confirms more than a thousand instances of late
he who through various ways hath boldly ran boggled at nothing cou'd be done by man at first misguided by his popish zeal to serve his holiness in any ill on which the jesuits put a gloss of good and whose perniciousness wan't understood
how eager was his bold endeavour still by any means the protestants to kill until at last being by heav'n inspir'd he wisely from his former ills retir'd and as a second saul he fiercely strove as once his hate to manifest his love to's native country and religion too which former mists wou'd never let him do and when converted all that e're he knew he boldly told and nought but what was true
to him our english nation much does owe who vent'ring all he had at one great throw valued not his dear life so he might save the kingdom's ruine and the king from's grave
he was the man who many plots reveal'd gainst the king's life which else had been conceal'd he was the man gainst bribes so armour proof that to be false thought no price great enough
in vain the romish zealots gainst him say that hopes of wealth made him their plots betray for cou'd he have been tempted by them to prove false to his king and gainst his country move their proffers large wou'd not have been in vain if he wou'd for some person's sake refrain to give in evidence but he withstood all the temptations to a seeming good

having at last been blest with a kind wife the only solid comfort of man's life and hoping now to live at peace and rest and be for ever by his country blest was strangely seiz'd with a dire malady and by a strange unheard of prophesy he fanci'd all along that he should dye by that disease yet then he persever'd in what he had said and not one tittle err'd as he was then even in a dying state from what he ever did oth plot relate and before witnesses at's parting breath the truth of depositions seal'd with death now at his loss let this sad nation mourn and drop with grief some tears upon his urn let us his sudden death justly bemoan had he liv'd longer he had more made known

dear dr oates must digression make and beg you wou'd in this great loss partake
you've lost a friend that much did value you because like him all you have said is true
go on good doctor and whilst here you live and this the nations loss you do survive
witness the truth and be not you dismai'd by threatning papists neither be afraid of popish plots against you for ther's one that sits upon the bright celestial throne will guard you and this nation will protect from all the plots of the proud romish sect
